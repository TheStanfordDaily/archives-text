# RIVAL VARSITIES CLASH ON DIAMOND TOMORROW
## PROSPECTS OF VICTORY FOR CARDINAL ARE BRIGHT Six Stanford Veterans Will Take Field in First Game of California Series. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon a throng of j
enthusiastic fans will witness the two ;
rival nines of Stanford and Califor
nia take the field in their bright now
uniforms to contend for the first game
of the twenty-third annual iutercol- 1
legiate baseball series. The contest ;
will be called promptly at three
o'clock by umpires Hildebrand and j
Dasliwood, providing the weather :
gods do not interfere.
Yesterday's game with Pomona, I
wiili resulted in a 5 to 0 victory for
Stanford, gave good evidence that the
members of the, team are in flue fet
tle for the clash with California. The 1
Cardinal batsmen scored a total of
twelve clean bingles, which is the
heaviest stiekwork they have done
this season. McCloskey proved to be
a regular demon with the hickory
club, making four pretty hits in as
many times- at bat, one of them going
for a triple.
The pitching of Hayes was one of
the bright features of the game, the
Ca twivler shutting out the
CI a rem out aggregation with four
scratch hits. Stanford scored the
first run of the game on a long triple
:
a Texas Leaguer of Hayes, bringing |
the third baseman across the rubber. |
The contest was cinched in the sev- j
enth inning when a melee of four sue- j
ocssive hits scored as many Stanford
runs.
The Cardinal batteries are a great
source of comfort to the adherents
of the team, since It is composed of
the same players that carried Stan
ford to a brilliant victory last spring.
Maple may be expected to work out.
with all bis old time skill >and speed,
while Dent on the receiving end will
put. forth his usual class of sterling
bull.
Captain Zeb Terry, one of the keen
est and steadiest ballplayers that-
Stanford has boasted of in many a
year, assisted by Tom Workman,
Wabbles Stafford and Pete McClos- 1
key will form an infield that has nev- !
er been surpassed in the history of j
Stanford. This quartette forms the j
backbone of the team with its bril- !
Hant fielding and timely hitting.
Halm, Day and Noonan, who will
cavort about in the outer pastures,
j make up a fast trio of outfielders.
Facb is ;i d(.;>endabe "hitter when a.l
bingle means a run, and moreover
they are sure fielders and fast on the j
bases.
In Haves, Slovens, Dooling and}
Landers, Stanford has four players
who can hold down any position with j
veteran ability.
"Doc" .Moskiman, advisory coach, j
when asked for his opinion in regard \
to Stanford's chances for winning the
contest, said: "The way the boys have
been going all season certainly makes
things look bright for tomorrow's
game. They have worked hard and i
improved wonderfully during the last.
IVw week:;. May the lest ream win,
and ' am suiv that t am is Stanford."

Captain Zeb Terry, one of the keen

Stanford has boasted of in many a

Stanford. This quartette forms the j

when asked for his opinion in regard \

Tomorrow afternoon a throng of j
enthusiastic fans will witness the two ;
rival nines of Stanford and Califor
nia take the field in their bright now
uniforms to contend for the first game
of the twenty-third annual iutercol- 1
legiate baseball series. The contest ;
will be called promptly at three
o'clock by umpires Hildebrand and j
Dasliwood, providing the weather :
gods do not interfere.
Yesterday's game with Pomona, I
wiili resulted in a 5 to 0 victory for
Stanford, gave good evidence that the
members of the, team are in flue fet
tle for the clash with California. The 1
Cardinal batsmen scored a total of
twelve clean bingles, which is the
heaviest stiekwork they have done
this season. McCloskey proved to be
a regular demon with the hickory
club, making four pretty hits in as
many times- at bat, one of them going
for a triple.
The pitching of Hayes was one of
the bright features of the game, the
Ca twivler shutting out the
CI a rem out aggregation with four
scratch hits. Stanford scored the
first run of the game on a long triple
:
a Texas Leaguer of Hayes, bringing |
the third baseman across the rubber. |
The contest was cinched in the sev- j
enth inning when a melee of four sue- j
ocssive hits scored as many Stanford
runs.
The Cardinal batteries are a great
source of comfort to the adherents
of the team, since It is composed of
the same players that carried Stan
ford to a brilliant victory last spring.
Maple may be expected to work out.
