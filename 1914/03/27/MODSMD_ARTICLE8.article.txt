# CELEBRATION AND APPRECIATION
## 
### 
A glance at the Stanford calendar this week-end is provocative of
rare delight. Following closely upon the heels of this gala Junior Week
will come the long-delayed spring vacation, which has been a source of
pleasant anticipation to each of us since the very first days of the semes
ter. The present freedom and entertainment provided for us by the
Juniors increase our foretaste of the coming holiday-time and lend it a
double zest, which is as effective as the exhilaration produced by a post
prandial "small black" when it tops an epicurean meal.
As Seventeeners. who have never before shared in the joys of a real
Junior Week, we find difficulty in ''believing our eyes" as we see the
Assembly Hall gay with mirth and merriment ves, and pretty girlsâ€”
on a Thursday night and our 1 Aid ay and Saturday date-lists crowded
with exciting events far out of the realm of the professor.
The Juniors have already proved themselves hosts par cxccllcucc,
while the thought of what is in store for us on the morrow increases
the depth of our appreciation and indebtedness'to them. Let every Sev
entecner demonstrate his gratitude to the resourceful class of TOl5 by
being ''anions* those present" when the final roll-call is called at the very
close of the Junior festivities. Let each of us contribute his share, in
significant though it may be, toward making the final success of the
1015 celebration a motive for permanent and mutual congratulation!
That any one of us should lie willing to relinquish the unique and varied
entertainment furnished for him this week-end on the campus by his
Junior hosts, in favor of reaching home a day or two in advance of the
ninety and nine one-hundredths of his fellows, is quite inconceivable.
May there be 110 evidences of l r reshmen selfishness and ingratitude in
this respect!
