# VARSITY NINE WINS FIRST CONTEST FROM CALIFORNIA
## 6 TO 5 VICTORY RESULTS FROM ERRATIC BASEBALL Second Game of Series Will Be Played On Berkeley Diamond Next Saturday Afternoon. 
### 
In a game featured by slipshod
baseball and interrupted by rain and
the changing of uniforms, Stanford
took the opening contest of the Inter
collegiate baseball series with Cal
ifornia on the home diamond March
28 by a 6 to 5 score.
The series is still undecided with
the postponement of the second game
which was scheduled lor last Satur
day on the Berkeley diamond. The
contest is now slated for next Sat
urday.
The Varsity's six runs in the first
game were made off an equal number
of hits, while ten hits by their oppo
nents only netted five tallies. This is
largely accounted for by the fact that
only two out of the total ten errors
for the game were committed by Car
dinal players. Of the eight California
errors fopr were made at shortstop.
Noonan proved to be the most con
sistent hitter for the Varsity with
three safeties out of four times at bat.
For the visitors Adair made three
bingles out of five times up. McClos
key and Young each hit the ball for
tliree-baggers, and the latter is also
credited with the only doub'c of the
day.
Maple went the whole nine innings
in the box for Stanford. He pitched
excellent ball, striking out ten oppo
nents in the first five innings. Only
once did he weaken before the Blue
and Gold batsmen, when he allowed
three hits and a couple of walks in
the seventh. These together with a
pair of errors permitted four run
ners to cross the plate.
Dodge was sent to the mound for
California at the outset. He was do
ing nicely until the third inning when
a single and two walks, coupled
with numerous errors by his team
mates, allowed three Cardinal tallies.
When in their half of the same inning
the bases were filled with two outs
