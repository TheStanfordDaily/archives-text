# BONNETT EQUALS COAST RECORD IN HALF MILE
## CARDINAL CAPTURES 97 POINTS IN OCCIDENTAL MEET Wilson Springs Surprise by Breaking Stanford Track Record in the Mile. 
### 
Record breaking performances on
the track were a common occurrence
rather than an unusual happening in
the meeting between Occidental and
Stanford on Friday. E. M. Bonnett,
'15, eclipsed his own mark of 1:58 in
the half mile run, and equalled the
Pacific Coast record for the distance
of 1:55:1. This time was made by
Edmonson at Seattle in 1909. Bon
nett's running stands out as one of
the best races in the half mile that
has been witnessed in this country for
several years. His mark was just
two seconds faster than the record
of the P. A. A. held by J. O. Miller, '08,
and R. L. Murray, '13.
P. R. Wilson sprang a surprise in
the mile run when he broke the Stan
ford record in this event. His time
was 4:24:3. Wilson took the lead at
the first from Annin and gradually
increased the distance until at the
finish he was seventy-five yards to the
good.
After the quarter mile race had been
run in competition with Occidental
four of the Stanford runners entered
a special 440 yard dash. Coach Camp
bell got the pole at start and ran his
own race, breaking the tape in 49-4.
This equals the P. A. A. record held
by Macauley and establishes a new
Stanford record. Captain McKee, on
the same afternoon negotiated the
century in 10 seconds flat, equaling
his own Stanford record. This was
the first race that he has run in com
petition this spring.
Ninety-seven to sixteen in Stan
ford's favor was the final score of the
meet. Points were not scored in the
broad jump as Occidental had no en
try in the event.
