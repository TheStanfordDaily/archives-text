# AMERICAN JAVELIN RECORD MADE IN A.A.L. MEET
## Harry Liversedge Hurls Javelin 161 Feet, Making Interscholastic Record at Stanford. 
### 
The Stanford oval was the scene of
a new world's interscholastic record
and at the same time American rec
ord last Saturday afternoon in the
annual A. A. L. meet. Harry Liver
sedge, of the San Francisco Polytecn
nic High School, hurled the javelin in
exhibition competition the phenom
enal distance of IPI feet 3 1-4 inches.
The former world's interscholastic
record was 134 feet 10 inches. The
American record was 169 feet 4
inches. It was practically the first
attempt of the lad's athletic career in
this event. There is doubt, however,
if the record will be accepted, as the
wind was at Liversedge's back when
the throw was made, although no
breeze was noticeable at the time of
the throw. Liversedge will be a com
petitor in the Stanford Interscholastic
meet next Saturday.
