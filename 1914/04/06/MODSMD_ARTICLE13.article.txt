# HOSPITALITY

### 
All of us have left this semester one more chance to do something
big for Stanford. No one of 11s is so indifferent to the welfare of his
alma mater as to fail to realize the supreme importance of the Inter
scholastic â€”the one time in the year when Stanford is at home to the finest
products of the preparatory schools of the West. Yet we have become
so accustomed to an invariably excellent Interscholastic that the rank
and file of us tend to take upon ourselves 110 responsibility for it. but
to leave all to those few unthanked and self-sacrificing men, the officials
of the Interscholastic Board.
Now, however, the time has come when our cooperation is urgent
ly required. We are to be hosts next Saturday to 275 guests whom we
have invited. Two hundred and twenty-five of these will remain .with
us over night. To date the numerous fraternities and clubs which boast
of loyalty to Stanford have not signified their willingness to care for
as many as one-half of this number. This sad condition surely must be
remedied tomorrow, when a meeting of representatives has been called
to discuss the problem. For the remainder of the week let us strain
every nerve in preparing for the "preps"; let us suffer some discom
forts if necessary; but let us not see Stanford's fine reputation for hos
pitality lowered in the eves of a single guest.
