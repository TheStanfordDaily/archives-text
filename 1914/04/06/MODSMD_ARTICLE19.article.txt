# SNAPPY SONGS AND SKITS TO FILL FRESHMAN SHOW
## 
### 
A varied and lively program, to
gether with the energy and natural
ability to be found in the 1917 class,
will do much to make a success of
the Freshman Vaudeville Show which
is slated for April 17, the evening be
fore the intercollegiate track meet.
On this auspicious occasion the fears
and hopes alike of the Stanford track
"fans" may be forgotten for a while
in the medley of lively music and
snappy dialogue which will charac
terize the performance. There will
be something doing all the time â€”of
that we are assured.
There will be eight numbers in the
program, the lirst of which will be a
male quartet composed of F. O. Hose,
H. M. Stanley, O. G. Lachmund and
H. 1.3. Fletcher. A tumbling and trap
eze stunt by It. L. Owen, It. M. Price
and J. \V. Templeton will furnish a
few thrills, while a take-off on the
Junior opera, written by the Fresh
men, promises to be a mirth provok
er. Music and songs will be followed
by a coon dialugue by C. L. Hunter
and L. E. Cole, a dance and song skit
by J. 11. itusseii and J. C. Cross, and
a violin solo by D. E. Shepardsou.
As a grand finale guaranteed to leave
pleasant memories, a Stanford play
entitled "The Makeup Gill" will be
staged, the roles of which will be
taken by G. K. Howard, K. A. Shel
don, P. W. Patterson and A. S. Boe
zinger.
Two performances will be given at
the Varsity Theatre, beginning at
7:30 and 9:00 o'clock. An admission
price of twenty-five cents will be
charged.
