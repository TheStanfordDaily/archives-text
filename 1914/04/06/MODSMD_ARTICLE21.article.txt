# Varsity Nine Experiences An Off-Day
## 
### 
The Varsity nine experienced an off
day when they met defeat at the
hands of the Occidental balltossers
last Thursday by a score of 6 to 4.
Nine errors were committed by the
Cardinals, while four belong to the
southerners. Hayes pitched through
the whole game, striking out ten op
ponents.
