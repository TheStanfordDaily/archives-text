# SECOND VARSITY DEFEATS SOUTH END BOAT CLUB MEN
## Cardinals Gain Load of Five Lengths in Race of Mile and One-Half. 
### 
The Stanford second Varsity crew
decisively defeated the South End
Boat Club in an exciting mile and a
half race on the waters of the Oak
laud estuary Saturday afternoon. Be
ginning with a 3G to the minute
stroke, the Cardinal rowers jumped
into a one length lead at the start of
the race, and gradually increased the
distance between the two shells to
five boat lengths before the conclu
sion of the contest. The time of the
winning crew for the course was 7
minutes 15 seconds, a very creditable
performance, as the entire race was
in direct opposition to a strong tide.
The Stanford shell contained the
following oarsmen: Worth, stroke;
Green, 7; Haggart, G; Bloeser, 5;
Branner, 4; Long, 3; Betterton, 2;
Kester, bow; Goodman, coxswain.
Coach Stephenson of the California
crew acted as starter.
