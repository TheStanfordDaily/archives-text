# BASKETBALL TEAM TAKES THREE GAMES IN SOUTH
## Cardinal Players Lose to Whittier Athletic Club and to Los Angeles Athletic Club. 
### 
Winning three games out of five,
the Stanford basketball five played a
most successful and an exceedingly
strenuous scnedule in the Southland
during the spring vacation. The
team met the best aggregations of
the South and performed creditably
on every occasion. The fact that the
games followed rapidly on each other
may have made a difference in the
later showing of the team. Three
contests were staged within twenty
four hours at one time and the men
were somewhat disabled by injuries
and exhaustion for the last games.
The Stanford men defeated Hunting
ton Beach High School, Long Beach
Y. M. C. A., and Orange Athletic Club.
They were defeated by Wliittier Ath
letic Club and Los Angeles Athletic
Club.
Under the management of Captain
A. E. Worthy, '15, the trip was a finan
cial success. Good crowds attended
most of the games.
This trip concludes the most suc
cessful season that the team has ex
perienced. Aside from the defeats by
California, the team lost but one
game previous to its southern sched
ule. As an incentive for a stronger
tea--. -iext year and a reward to the
present men, minor letters were
awarded them by the Executive Com
mittee.
Stanford players are: A. E. Worthy,
'15 (captain), W. B. Blodgett, '15, .T.
R. Davis, '15, forwards; E. T. Dutton,
'15, center; I. E. Farrar, '15, L. R.
Reynolds, '15, guards.
