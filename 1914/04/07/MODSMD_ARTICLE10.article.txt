# TALENTED ARTISTS ENGAGED FOR GLEE CLUB PROGRAM
## Frederick Preston Search, Cellist, and Robert Raymond Lippitt, Pianist, Will Appear in Concert. 
### 
Frederick Preston Search, violon
cellist, and Robert Raymond Lippitt,
pianist, will give a concert in the As
senibly Hall Wednesday evening,
April 15, under the auspices of the
Stanford Glee Club.
They have recently returned to this
country for a concert tour of fifty
performances after an absence of a
long period of study and public ap
pearance abroad. Mr. Search has
studied at the chief musical conserva
tories of Europe. It is Julius Klengel,
perhaps the greatest violoncellist
known, who has given the polish and
refinement to this artist's playing.
Perhaps no cellist in the world has
had greater technical preparation
than Mr. Search, who for years has
given from ten to fourteen hours
daily of the most vigorous applica
tion to his instrument.
The Salt Lake Herald-Republican
says of him: "Tn arrangement, tech
nique and interpretation the program
was unsurpassingly fine. All num
bers were executed with fine display
of musicianship. The entire program
was characterized by a willingness to
please and utmost ease in portraying
the masters."
