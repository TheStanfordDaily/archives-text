Stanford Varsity and Freshman
crews to meet California and Wash
ington on the morning of April 11
were announced today by Coach F. L.
Guerena, Ml. In addition to the eigh
teen men in the two shells, tiva sub
stitutes, three for the Varsity and
two for the Freshmen, have been se
lected to till any positions vacated at
the last moment. Six veterans, Huls
man, Rehm, Jacomini, Clover, Olm
stfad, and Jeffers, appear in the Var
sity lineup. The list is completed by
the names of two recruits, Woiford
and Orme. Reir email is at his old
berth at the tiller, and will be evei*
ready on the days of the race with a
taplu .... of directions and words of
encouragement.
The first year rowers outweigh the
Varsity, 173 and 17;" being the respec
tive average weights. A large squ id
of Freshmen signed up at the begin
ning oi the season, and the resulting
close competition has developed a
very fast aggregation—one which may
prove to lie a great surprise in the
contest with the much touted baby
eights of California and Washington.
■ ]xjm rieneed .Machine Developed
The Varsity boat practically con
tains the same personnel that so suc
cessfully defended the reputation of
the Cardinal last year. A new season
of rigorous training has whipped into
shape a formidable fighting machine,
well versed in the smooth Eastern
stroke, and capable of putting up a
stubborn bid for first honors.
Coach Guerena, without a peer in
the long list of Stanford coxswains,
has endeared himself to the squad of
men under his care by a display of
impartial judgment at all times and
an intense desire to spare no effort
in turning out a winning crew, de
spite the lack of facilities at the Red
wood estuary. His work has been
ably supplemented by the endeavors
of the coaching committee, consisting
of Captain Clover, Jacomini, and
Reineman.
Two Pouglikcepsie Veterans
Tn P. P. Clover, the crew candidates
have found a leader who is a good
.judge of men and a splendid oarsman.
He rowed in the Poughkeepsie regat
ta and appeared last year in Number
2 position.
Woiford, another Poughkeepsie vet
eran. has demonstrated a marked su
periority at stroke. The men respond
to his guidance with great ease, and

the improvement made by the Stan
ford shell this season largely reflects
the etiiciency of his cuul, even stroke.
Hulsman, Rehm, Jacomini, Olm
stead, and Jeffers are serving their
third year on Stanford crew lineups.
Each filled a place on the 1915 baby
eight, which was captained by 01m
stead, and were the mainstay of the
Varsity last season. Orme is the only
one of last year's Freshmen to qualify
for Varsity honors. His powerful
sweep is one of the strongest factors
in the shell, and a gradual improve
ment in his stroke has entitled him
to a place among the eight best oars
nun in the University.
Freshmen Insjuro Comidcwe
Captain Clover expresses his opin
ion that the Freshman boat is well
able to cope with the first year repre
sentatives of the IJlue and Gold. In
preliminary practice the baby shell
has furnished adequate competition
for the Varsity, and it is with confi
dence that Clover predicts another
victory for them over the California
"Frosh." The presence of Washing
ton in the preliminary contest adds a
sharp spice to the event. The north
ern baby eight is named as follows:
Simons, stroke; McConihe, No. 7; Al
len, No. 0; Poison, No. 5; I-Toss, No. 4;
Goodall, No. 3; Hardie, No. 2; Ander
son, bow; Thomas, coxswain.
Coach Conibear pins his faith on
the following men to represent the
Washington Varsity: Frankland,
stroke; Callow, No. 7; Carlin, No. 0;
Walske, No. 5; Schumaker, No. 4;
Rose, No. 3; Kunim, No. 2; Brokay,
bow; Captain Dunbar, coxswain. Of
these, four oarsmen are veterans of
last year's victorious eight. The
northern crews are undergoing daily
workouts on the Oakland estuary, and
expect, to be in fine fettle on Ihe di\
of the race. Announcement of the
California crews has not been made
as yet.
Cornell Stroke Adopted
Guerena has employed a stroke
which emphasizes a hard catch and
a slow recovery, making for a smooth,
continuous movement. The Varsity is
using this system with great success,
and is attaining the form displayed
by Cornell at the Poughkeepsie re
gatta, of 1912. In fact, the Stanford
stroke is a modified adaptation of the
method used by the Cornell crew at
that time.
