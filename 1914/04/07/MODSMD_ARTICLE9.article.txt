The Daily Palo Alto wishes to extend hearty congratulations to
the regular and substitute players chosen for the \ arsity and bresh
men crews. No more penetrating test of a man could be asked than
the training season in which they have proven their superiority—a
training season more strenuous and gruelling than that required for
any other sport. Especial honor is due to the men who secured places
in "the boats of this particular year, when the contest for honors was
so hard-fought that many places were won only by the narrowest mar
gins. Yet it is to these other men —the men who almost made it —the
men who in another sport arc known as "the twilight squad . that
we wish to pay especial tribute. They should know that the I niversity
community, rather than regarding them with pity for having lost in
the competition, regards them with the highest honor for having tried,
and considers them as men no less highly than those who will be hon
ored by the big "S." 1
