# RARE OPPORTUNITIES

Again a word of appreciation is called for by the efforts of those
who are endeavoring to bring to Stanford the finest offerings of music
and the drama. In the past the comparatively small number of oppor
tunities to attend productions of this nature lias been the one factor
tending to offset the countless advantages which the University enjoys
because of its semi-isolated location. Next week, however, we are to
have on Monday the excellent Stratford players in "Twelfth Night,"
and on Wednesday, Frederick Preston Search, the world's greatest
'cellist. The enthusiasm of the audience at the recent Krcisler recital
indicated fairly enough the appreciation tendered by the community to
the Faculty Committee on Public Entertainment for its endeavors in
bringing such attractions to Stanford. For the concert by Professor
Search we also bespeak hearty support, not only because he is an artist
of real distinction but because the financial success of the evening will
aid the Glee Club in its efforts to become an organization of greater
strength.
