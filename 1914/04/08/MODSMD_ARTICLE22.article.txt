# WASHINGTONâ€™S EIGHT HAS STRONGER PULL THIS YEAR
## Coach Conibear Believes That Any Slower Time Will Be Due to Poorer Stroking. 
### 
Coach Conibear, of the Washington
crew, whose members visited on the
campus yesterday, states that there is
more pure strength in the boat this
year than last, and that had Zimmer
man, who is out of athletics because
of poor studies, been in his former
place at stroke, he would have every
confidence that Washington would be
the victor in the race next Saturday.
As it is, Prankland, who rowed No. 2
last year, is setting the pace, and in
the opinion of Conibear, Washing
ton's chances under him are not quite
as hopeful.
Two other veterans beside Frank
land will sit in the boat. These are
Walske and Catlin, at 5 and 6 respec
tively. Walske, who was chosen for
the Ail-American crew when at
Poughkeepsie last year, is considered
to have the ideal build for an oars
man. Catlin Vent East to compete
against Wisconsin four years ago. All
other oarsmen except Kumm at No. 3,
and Rose at No. 2. have had more
than one year's experience in the
shells.
For the baby eight Conibear says
that the set of oarsmen in the boat is
the best that has ever represented a
Freshman class for Washington.
