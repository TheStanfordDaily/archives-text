# FAMED STRATFORD TROUPE TO PLAY “TWELFTH NIGHT”
## Benson’s Company of Shakespearean Artists Engaged for Matinee Performance Next Monday. 
### 
Shakespeare's dramatic comedy
'Twelfth Night," one of the richest
tributes to the genius of the Hard of
Avon, will be played in the Assembly
Hall Monday afternoon by the Strat
ford players. The matinee curtain
will rise at two o'clock.
Efforts of the faculty committee on
public exercises to bring Frederick R.
Benson and His remarkable troupe of
artists to Stanford have been justified
by local approval. Many had hoped
that in case the English players were
brought here, the campus audience
might see "The Merry Wives of Wind
sor." On account of fear that cos
tumes and scenery might not be
moved in time for the performance
at San Jose Monday evening, Mr. Ben
son was unable to meet the request.
The leader of the company is weil
remembered by his address at Stan
ford last year, when he plead for ac
tive interest in a great pageant to he
performed at the Panama-Pacific Ex
position. Mr. Benson has been a life
lons lover of Shakespeare's plays, and
is directing his efforts to endear them
to the English speaking world. That
ambition has cost him an independent
fortune. The eminent English actor
is a rare example of the idealised
artist who follows art for its own
sake.
Tickets for the performance will be
on sale Friday at the Bookstore and
at Weingartner's in Palo Alto.
