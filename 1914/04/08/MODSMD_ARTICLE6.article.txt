Next Friday evening, April 10, the
two trios of debaters representing
Stanford and California will contest

al, given annually to the speaker who
presents the best argument on some
phase of the French government. The
debate will take place at eight o'clock
in the Harmon Gymnasium, Berkeley,
with President Benjamin Ide Wheeler
of California as the presiding officer.
For the past six weeks, the Stan
ford team, consisting of K. E. Leib,
'14, A. F. Coyle, '15, A. J. Hettinger,
'16, and their alternate, P. L. Hig
gins, 'in, have been working up all
the possible phases of the general
question. This afternoon they will
hold their last preparation for the
contest in the form of a trial debate
in the chapel. By Friday they will
have attained a stage of perfection
which will insure Stanford a splendid
showing in the greatest classic on the
forensic program of the year. The
Blue and Gold will be represented by
A. W. Drury, '14, K. E. Sturgis, '15,
|and John Levy, '15. T. G. Chamber
| lain, 'lfi, will act as their alternate.
The general question of the Carnot
I debate which the six speakers have
been studying is the "Foreign Rela
tions of France." A specific topic for
discussion will be chosen by a com
mittee of four from the faculty of
both Stanford and California the af
ternoon of the debate, and then an
nounced to the contestants at six
o'clock, two hours before the contest
begins. Professor L. E. Rassett and
Instructor R. J. Miller, both of the
English department, represent Stan
ford on the committee.
The side upon which each debater
will speak and the order in which he
will come on the program will be de
cided by the drawing of lots if the
contestants can not agree among
themselves. Each speaker will be al
lowed to talk ten minutes, seven of
which will bo devoted to his main
speech and three minutes for rebut
tal. The judges for the debate are
yet to be selected by California from
the list presented by Stanford.
