# SENIORS PLAN GAIETIES FOR THEIR FINAL WEEK
## NOVELTIES WILL DISTINGUISH COMMENCEMENT HOLIDAYS Festivities Will Culminate in Elaborate Ball at Hotel Vendome, May 18. 
### 
Plans for a superior Senior Week,
abounding in amusements and reflect
ing a true holiday spirit, are being
rapidly formulated by the Senior
Week committee under the chairman
ship of F. 13. Watkins, '14.
Members of the Alumni Association
have promised a hearty co-operation
this year and undoubtedly several
graduate attractions of great interest
will be included in the final program.
Efforts are being made to secure the
best musical organizations of the Pen
insula to aid in making the carnival
a success. Notable among these will
be the Australian orchestra of San
Francisco, which will furnish the mu
sic for the promenade concert to be
held Friday evening in the Memorial
Court.
A pleasing innovation in the Class
Day program consists of a musical
entertainment at the Lake from 2 to
3:30 p.m., at which occasion the vari
ous musical clubs of the campus will
contribute a program of song and in
strumental pieces.
Instead of planting the ivy on Sun
day afternoon, the last informal get
together of the graduating class will
be held at Lagunita in the shape of a
Senior Supper.
The graduation will take place on
Monday, May 18, and Senior Week will
close with the annual Ball at the Ven
dome Hotel in San Jose.
