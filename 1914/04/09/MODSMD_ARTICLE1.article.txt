Although the final announcement of
the University of California crews liaf
been reserved for the last moment,
information received today from the
rival university .nives an authoritative
estimate of the lineup. Four veter
ans, Sutton, Georgeson, Captain Shaw,
and Merritt appear on the list, evenly
distributed throughout the boat. Mer
ritt is promoted to the position of
stroke, he having rowed No. 3 last
year, and Sutton is again found at
bow. As at Stanford, the California
Freshmen outweigh the Varsity by a
single pound to the man, the respec
tive weights being 173 and 172. The
California coxswain is a veritable
featherweight, tipping the scales at
101 pounds.
Following is a statement of the pro
visional lineup, with age, height, and
weight of each oarsman:

The only contested positions on the
Varsity are No. 2, for which Augur,
who rowed No. 4 on last year's Fres i
