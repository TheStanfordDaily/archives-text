# STRAW VOTES
## 
### 
The week beginning April 20 will follow closely after the two
high-pressure points of athletic excitement for the semester. Ihe Inter
scholastic, the crew races, and the ball game of next Saturday, and the
Intercollegiate track meet of the following Saturday will be things of
the past. During this lull after the storm there will come a demand
that the attention of Stanford men and women be given to critical prob
lems of student government and affairs. On Monday, April 20. in rec
ognition of the general interest in the Honor System, Chancellor J. Li.
Kirklaud, an authority on that subject, will come from Yanderbilt Uni
versity to speak on "Student 1 lonor." At this time a pamphlet explain
ing fully the principles and rulings of student government will also be
distributed. On the following Wednesday 9:15 assemblies will be
held for the discussion of questions raised by this pamphlet, and for
the taking of straw ballots regarding the substitute to be adopted for
the Plug-Ugly and the advisability of requesting the adoption of the
Honor System in this University.
"Straw ballots," says O. Henry, "show which way the hot air
blows." The hope of those interested in this policy of bringing im
portant problems directly affecting the students before them for their
consideration is that sufficient attention may be given to these questions
before the Wednesday assemblies that the straw votes will represent
several grains of thought as well as much hot air. It is not now too
early to begin to think.
