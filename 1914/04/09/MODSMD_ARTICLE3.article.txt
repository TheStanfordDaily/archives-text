# SHADES OF HAVERLY, PRIMROSE AND WEST! SEE THE TRACK SHOW
## 
### 
At last, after live years! Here
; comes a chance for a Stanford aud
' ience to smell burnt cork and grease
I paint, and see an honest-to-gracious
j crew of black-lace troubadours in
j action. The Track Show squad is
; training 10 prolong the joys of vic
' tory the evening of the Intercollegiate
meet on April 18.
Maybe some favored members of
i the community have sat in the front
row of nigger heaven back in the Po
|dunk opera house, and picked the
high notes of A1 Jolson's harmony
festival off the rafters, or turned a
j bifocal lens on the cavorting glee of
Mclntyre and Heath's Beauty Carni
' val. But three generations of Sia
' mese Twins, and a union of Buffalo
i Bill's genuine article, Little Georgie
from Broadway, and the Follies Ber
' gere haven't even a feather-edge on
the live vaudeville turns that the
Track Show is about to turn ram pa it.
During all these dead years the
local dramatic magnates have slept
on the job. Now for the first time |
j we are to learn of the existence of a
prize package of coal heavers that is
going to plink-plang sobs out of ban
jos, and squeeze the comedy out of
those unadulterated sugar-cane and
cotton songs they used to sing down
on the bayous "bet'o' de wah." The
coons in this show are going to pass
out the real sort, â€”the kind they used
to dispense long before there wa- any
need for a pure food law to guar
antee the brand of Mason-Dixon Line
songs of common acquaintance.
Besides the minstrelsy there will be
four or five other "big time" acts.
Proceeds will be turned into the
fund that will send the Stanford
track team east in May. The ticket
sale will be held Wednesday, at 1:10,
at the Bookstore and at Weingart
ner's.
