# "OUR WIVES" CAST WILL BE DETERMINED FRIDAY
## Senior Play Tryouts Afford Splendid Opportunity for New Dra-matic Talent. 
### 
Eight leads and a butler compose,
the cast of the Senior play. TryottU
held yesterday brought forth much o! j
the old standard material. Some fiii :
new material showed to good ad- j
vantage. The trials have been so j
i
close that another meeting of t!r
committee is called for Friday n !
order finally to determine the cast.
"Our Wives" has but lately been re- :
leased. The Alcazar company of San
'Francisco played it during the las:
year. The principal reason for choo -
ing it is its irrepressible snap. Not
only the lines but the action are lively
all the way through. It is distinctly
a modern play.
Although the parts of Frank Bow
lers and Emily Wilson are considered
the leads yet the other parts are sj
closely intermingled that they can
hardly be considered minor parts. j
The part of the butler offers unusual
opportunities.
