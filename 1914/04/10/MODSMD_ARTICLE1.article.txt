###

centage of the Stanford student body
will leave the campus to witness the
double crew and baseball attraction

uate Manager Wilcox has made ar
rangements with the Southern Pa
cific Company to handle the crowd of
sightseers.
A special car is scheduled to leave
the Bookstore at 6:40 a.m., and will
connect with the 6:58 train from Palo
Alto. This train arrives at San Fran
cisco about 8 o'clock, and will give
spectators ample time to reach the

the 9:05 observation train will start.
Tickets may still be obtained from
Manager Wilcox or at the Bookstore.
The Freshman crew race will start
a mile below the Webster Street
bridge at 9:30 a.m., and those who do
not. take seats in the observation
trains which follow the progress of

finish line of the race. Many specta
tors will also take advantage of the
situation of the Alameda pier, which
fronts the course for over a mile.
The Webster Street bridge may be
reached by taking the Alameda elec
tric interurban from the Oakland
Mole. From this point a good view
of the start of the Varsity race may
be had. The most convenient way of
reaching the starting point is to take
the Creek ferry.
The first year race will begin exact
ly at 9:30. Stanford baby crews have
only been vanquished once by Blue
and Gold Freshmen, this occurring in

to add another to the long string of
victories over its rivals.
The three Varsities will lie started
las soon as the Freshman shells have
reached their destination. The course

ticing daily on the course under the

.noted in the stroke, particularly in
| the Freshman eight, under the leader
ship of Captain A. H. McEuen.
