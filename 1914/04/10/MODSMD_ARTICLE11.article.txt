The Daily Palo Alto extends a most hearty welcome to those who
will compete in the interscholastic track, field and tennis events. We
are glad to have with us the finest young - men from the most enterpris
ing- preparatory schools of the West. We appreciate the opportunity
to make the acquaintance of these interesting fellows, and also take a
selfish pleasure, as one always does in displaying that of which he is
very proud, in showing them the University. Those of us who know
Stanford so well are prompted in all modesty to venture that these
visitors will find here infinitely more to praise than to criticise.
