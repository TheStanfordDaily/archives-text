# STRATFORD TROUPE PLAYS ALL-STAR SHAKESPEARE
## Tickets May Be Procured at the Bookstore, or at Weingartnerâ€™s Pharmacy. 
### 
Shakespeare without a star, as
played by the Stratford troupe which
will appear here Monday, has proved
in their able hands to be an all-star
presentation of the master's works.
It will be the best-rounded and most
complete performance of Shakespeare
that has been seen here. "Twelfth
Night," a play which calls for equal
ly competent handling of five or six
roles, will prove a most suitable ve
hicle for the admirable team work
of this star-less aggregation. Their
productions are characterized by the
artistic conception and thoughtful in
terpretation of important and minor
parts.
Tickets at' 75 cents and a dollar
are on sale at the Bookstore and at
Weingartner's in Palo Alto.
