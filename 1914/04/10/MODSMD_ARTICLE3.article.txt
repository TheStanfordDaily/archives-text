With the arrival of over 250 prepar

in the track and field meet and twen
ty-four more are engaged in tennis
competition, according to the official
program, which was run off the press

I Owing to the timely cessation of
rain, the track will be in excellent
j condition for the races tomorrow
j morning, and several records of long
: standing are expected to fall before
■ the prowess of the young athletes.
Among the most favored men in
the sprints are Sloman of San Fran
j cisco Poly, .Toehnck of Oxnard, and
Johnson of Palo Alio, all of whom
i have approached even time in the cen
| tury and 23 seconds in the 220-yard
dash. The record of 50 3-5 in the 440
i will probably not be touched, the best
time handed in this year being 51 1-5.
