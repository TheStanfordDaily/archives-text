# RIVAL NINES CLASH IN SECOND GAME TOMORROW
## CARDINAL LINE-UP REMAINS UNCHANGED Scene of Play Depends on Weather Conditions.â€”Game Will Re Called at Three O'clock. 
### 
The Stanford and California Vai
sity nines will meet tomorrow on the
latter's field for what may be the de
ciding game of the 1914 intercolleg
iate series. This will be the second
contest between the rival teams. On
the former occasion the Cardinals
triumphed by a 6 to 5 score in a rath
er haphazard game played on the?
home diamond.
A second consecutive win tomorrow
following the precedent of last year
would terminate the series at once
in favor of Stanford. A defeat would
place the teams on an even footing,
and the third game would be required.
Captain Terry will be backed by
the same combination that took the
field in the opening contest. Maple
and Dent constitute the battery,
while Workman, Stafford, McCloskey,
Terry, Halm, Day and Noonan will be
in their accustomed positions.
California will be materially streng
thened by the presence of Captain
Rubke in the game. He will play
shortstop, and Young will probably
appear in the outfield. It is uncertain
whether Dodge or Gefkin will open
in the box for the State University.
The outcome of tomorrow's play
can hardly lie forecasted, but the
Cardinal supporters are confident de
spite the reversal of form experienced
by the Varsity in their one perform
ance since the first intercollegiate. It
is hoped that this is but the natural
reaction after the first big contest.
The truth of this theory can only bo
known tomorrow, as rains have pre
vented all games since the Occidental
reverse.
If the weather permits the game
will be staged on the diamond at Cali
fornia Field, but the California man
agement has arranged to transfer the
scene of play to the Oakland Coast
League park in case of rain. Final
announcement, on which the fans may
depend, will be made in the morning
papers. The game is scheduled to
start at 3 o'clock with umpires Brady
and Earl presiding.
