# A 						GLORIOUS DAY

It has been a wonderful clay.
The defeat of the Blue and Gold Varsity crew insures that the
Cardinal claim to rowing supremacy in California will remain undis
puted. The defeat of both the Washington and California Freshmen
eights by our first-year oarsmen presages a day when Stanford will be
without a peer on the water not only in California but in the West.
The defeat of Stanford in baseball by our opponents across the
Hay proves them to be no mean rivals; and to their great ball team,
the winner from our own nine of which we are so proud, we extend
enthusiastic appreciation. To our own athletes of the water and of the
diamond, who have justified in unmeasured degree the confidence
which we reposed in them, goes our heartfelt thanks.
Let us not allow our interest in our own affairs to prevent a word
of congratulation to our visitors. The ninth Interscholastic we believe
to have been the most successful ever held. l»y their excellent perform
ances on the track and in the field and on the courts, as well as by their
thoroughly gentlemanly conduct, the entrants in these events have taken
front rank among the great company of splendid fellows who have at
tended Stanford Interscholastics.
