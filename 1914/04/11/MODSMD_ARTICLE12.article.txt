Engineers and Wearing \pp;irei.
Everyone knows that engineering
students have certain rights and
privileges that do .not belong to the
rest of the college public. They, ap
parently as a matter of divine right,
have the privilege of wearing greasy
cords that would disgrace a self
respecting tramp, they have the right
to let their razors rust with disuse
for a week at a time, and they are
privileged to congregate around that
particular portion of the Quad which
they have proudly designated "Rough
Neck Corner" and insolently stare the
women of the university out of coun
tenance as they pass on their way to
classes, and pass noticeably inaudible
remarks about their appearance. No
one wishes to deny them these rights,
powers and privileges. They are
among the choicest traditions of the
university, and it is not allowable for
the common herd of non-engineers to
question them.
Another of the privileges of en
gineers is to enjoy the juicy quid and
to send forth great brown streams
that settle the dust on the road and
spatter on the feet of the innocent
passer-by. Since this is the surest
test by which an engineer can be dis
tinguished from one of the rabble, no
idea could be further from our mind
than to try to discourage this prac
tice, and we are willing to uncom
plainingly buy new shoes and medi
tate on the wonders of higher edu

cation. But when the Chosen Few
sit in their drafting room on the sec
ond floor and revel in the joys of
"Star" and "Piper Heidsiek" and spit
out of the windows onto the path
where almost all of the men of the
university are accustomed to walk
back and forth to their despised
"pipe courses" it would seem that
even the engineers had gone too far.
We say this only after careful con
sideration and with no desire what
ever to be guiltv of the crime of lose
I
| majeste, but someone must say some
j thing. It is indeed disconcerting to
jhave tobacco juice descend on one
I as from the very heavens as he wends
I his way peacefully along in the
shadow of the Quad on a sunny after
noon. Mats and shoes and suits of
I clothes cost money these days, and it
; would look absurd to see a man with
'an umbrella over his head when the
sun was shining and there was not a
cloud in the sky.
! Engineers, we look up to you with
veneration and awe. We are willing
to have our shoes ruined to keep you
in your high place, but can't you, we
beg of you, do something to save our
caps and coats! ECON. MAJOR.

have the privilege of wearing greasy
cords that would disgrace a self
respecting tramp, they have the right
to let their razors rust with disuse
for a week at a time, and they are
privileged to congregate around that
particular portion of the Quad which
they have proudly designated "Rough
Neck Corner" and insolently stare the
women of the university out of coun
tenance as they pass on their way to
classes, and pass noticeably inaudible
remarks about their appearance. No
one wishes to deny them these rights,
powers and privileges. They are
among the choicest traditions of the
university, and it is not allowable for
the common herd of non-engineers to
question them.
Another of the privileges of en
gineers is to enjoy the juicy quid and
to send forth great brown streams
that settle the dust on the road and
spatter on the feet of the innocent
passer-by. Since this is the surest
test by which an engineer can be dis
tinguished from one of the rabble, no
idea could be further from our mind
than to try to discourage this prac
tice, and we are willing to uncom
plainingly buy new shoes and medi
tate on the wonders of higher edu

cation. But when the Chosen Few
sit in their drafting room on the sec
ond floor and revel in the joys of
"Star" and "Piper Heidsiek" and spit
out of the windows onto the path
where almost all of the men of the
university are accustomed to walk
back and forth to their despised
"pipe courses" it would seem that
even the engineers had gone too far.
We say this only after careful con
sideration and with no desire what
ever to be guiltv of the crime of lose
I
| majeste, but someone must say some
j thing. It is indeed disconcerting to
jhave tobacco juice descend on one
I as from the very heavens as he wends
I his way peacefully along in the
shadow of the Quad on a sunny after
noon. Mats and shoes and suits of
I clothes cost money these days, and it
; would look absurd to see a man with
'an umbrella over his head when the
sun was shining and there was not a
cloud in the sky.
! Engineers, we look up to you with
veneration and awe. We are willing
to have our shoes ruined to keep you
in your high place, but can't you, we
beg of you, do something to save our
caps and coats! ECON. MAJOR.
