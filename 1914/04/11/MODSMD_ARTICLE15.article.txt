# CARNOT DEBATE MEDAL AWARDED TO JOHN LEVY
## California Orator Wins Coveted Foren-sic Prize in Excellent Contest Last Evening. 
### 
For the fifth consecutive year a
Hlue and Gold speaker was named
winner of the Carnot Medal, when
John Levy, '15, attained the highest
honors in the Stanford-California de
bating circles by receiving the unani
mous decision of the judges. Levy
won from a field of three Stanford
and three California speakers, each
one of whom delivered addresses of
the highest merit. The question of
the debate, which was announced two
hours before the discussion to the
contestants was "Resolved, That
France should abandon her alliance
with Russia in favor of an offensive
and defensive alliance with England."
Levy's two speeches of the evening
were excellent in substance and were
presented in unusual style, marked by
clear enunciation and forceful de
livery. The Blue and Gold speakers
each upheld the negative side of the
question, while the Cardinal orators
supported the affirmative. K. B. Leib,
'14, A. F. Coyle, '15, and A. J. Het
tinger, 'IG, were the Stanford speak
ers. The two other California do
haters were A. W. Drury, '14, and E.
K. Sturgis, '15. The alternates of the
two rival teams, E. T. Chamberlain,
'15, and P. L. Higgins, '15, acted as
timekeepers.
The judges for the contest were F
N. Angelotti of the Supreme Court,
Frank 11. Kerrigan of the Appellate
Court, and G. A. Sturtevant, presiding
judge of the Superior Court. Presi
dent Benjamin Ide Wheeler of Cali
fornia acted as the presiding officer.
