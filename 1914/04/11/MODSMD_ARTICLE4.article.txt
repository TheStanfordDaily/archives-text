OAKLAND ESTUARY, April 11.—
White and red and blue for the Var
sity, red and white and blue for the
Freshmen! Eight white blades flash
ing in perfect rhythm swept the
Washington Varsity into first place in
the three mile race of this morning's
triangular regatta, with Stanford a
good second and California a hard
fighting third. It was undoubtedly
i the finest race, from the standpoint
lof close competition, ever seen 011 the
! bay waters, and the position of the
i shells at the finish confirmed Coach
jConibear's expressed opinion that the
Varsity contest would be a race, not a
procession.
In the three-cornered Freshman
race, the Cardinal eight swept the
field, outdistancing the Washington
eight by four lengths, and leaving the
California shell far in the rear. The
1917 oarsmen rowed in perfect form,
far superior to the oarswork of the
Varsity, and took the race handily.
Crowded Ciirs
The day was perfect. From smil
ing blue skies the sun flashed warm
greeting on pleasure launches and
observation trains, crowded with the
vari-colored throng of college folk out
to cheer their favorites. Two long
trains on the Alameda Pier paced the
I shells the last half of their stretch,
j while a dozen tugs jockeyed behind
| the all-controlling revenue cutter.
Freshman Kace
The three Freshman eights left the
j two-mile starting line at 9:25, the
; Stanford crew taking the lead from a
!free start. At the power line towers
! Coach Guerena's men were hitting the
j water 34 times a minute, a pace that
i pulled their shell to the front.
Washington made a spirited spurt
at the end of the first mile, but Stan
ford was pulling well, and their mar
gin of clear water was not endangered.
The Freshmen had a clear lead of
four lengths at (he finish, covering
the two miles in 13:19.
The Varsity
Jockeying at the start delayed the
Varsity race for some fifteen minutes,
but the three crews hit the water for
a fair start. California on the left in
the stream, Stanford in the middle
course, and Washington in the favored
path near the bank. Stanford held a
slight lead for three-quarters of a
mile, but at this point Washington's
superiority became evident, their per
fect rhythmical body swing and long
stroke pulling the "Seattle Spirit I"
to the fore.
At fhe turn of the Estuary the three
crews were hitting the same pace, 34
to fhe minute. Washington crept
closer and closer to the bank, with
Stanford and California edging into
the stream. The northern shell
crossed the finish line just thirteen
strokes before the Stanford coxswain
could megaphone "let her run," while
California was eleven strokes behind
Stanford.
The winning time was 18:5G,
a minute slower than the time of last
year, the difference being due to tide
conditions.
Guorena's Statement
Coach "Husky" Guerena made the
following statement in regard to the
performance of the Cardinal crews:
"I am very well satisfied with the
Varsity, taking all things in consider
ation. Of course, in the last half cf
the race, the work was ragged. They
lost their stride, and began to shoot
their slides. I think that contributed
to their making second place. Reine
man steered a good course; he made
the best of the race. Allowing for
tide conditions, the race should be
very satisfactory to us. The Fresh
men deserved to win—they certainly
are a good crew."
Coach Conibear was frank in say
ing that he was disappointed in the
work of the Freshmen, but was proud
of his Varsity eight. Plans are being
laid in the northern city to send the
crew to Poughkeepsie.
Coach Stephenson of California was
noncommital, merely saying that the
improved showing made by the Var
sity was encouraging. The Blue and
Gold Varsity were going strong at the
finish, which is greatly in contrast
to their condition last year.
Captain Elected
G. A. Jacomini was elected 1915
crew captain by his fellow oarsmen
after lunch at the Hotel St. Mark.
Jacomini was a member of his Fresh
man class crew, rowed number 6 in
last year's Varsity, and was in the
fourth slide this morning. He regis
ters in the Mechanical Engineering
department from Pasadena, and is a
member of Encina Club.
