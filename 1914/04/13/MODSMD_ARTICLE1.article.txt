# TENNIS TRIP EAST RESTS ON RAISING OF FUNDS
## TWO MAN TEAM TO COMPETE IN LONGWOOD TOURNAMENT Play With Six Eastern Colleges Al-ready Scheduled and Others Are Likely. 
### 
Stanford will probably be repre
sented by a two man tennis team at
the national tournament at Longwootl
in the latter part of May tliis year,
and in dual meets with several of the
eastern colleges. The trip was sanc
tioned by the Executive Committee at
a recent meeting. Some difficulty has
been experienced in raising sufficient
funds for the trip, but it seems now
that this will be overcome. Five
hundred dollars are needed and two
hundred and fifty of this has been
guaranteed by six eastern institu
tions with whom a tentative schedule
of matches has already been ar
ranged. Fifty dollars has been al
lowed the team by the Executive Com
mittee and it is hoped that part of the
remainder of the sum will be guaran
teed by a half-dozen other colleges
from whom definite answers have not
been received.
The universities with whom matches
have been arranged are Cornell, Yale,
Harvard, Chicago, Missouri and Illi
nois.
R. L. Murray, '13, will be one of
the men on the team if the tour is
made. Murray is recognized as the
leader of Stanford tennis players and
can enter the eastern matches because
the men will not fall under any strict
eligibility rules. H. L. Hahn, '16, who
ranks as number one on this year' 3
Varsity, will probably be the other
member, but a definite tryout will be
held for places.
Letters have been received from na
tional champion McLaughlin and from
Johnson, the California sensation in
the East last year, strongly urging
the trip. They state that Stanford
would have a clean sweep in the Mid
dle West and an even break with the
Eastern teams.
The team will start on May Ift, and
will meet all the colleges on the way
East, arriving in Boston, where the
Longwood tournament is held, on
May 27.
