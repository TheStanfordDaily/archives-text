"'The Golden Age of Stanford Athletics" has formed a topic for
many more fluent pens; yet we beg leave to point out the signs which
seem to us to indicate its near approach. Not alone because this has
been a victorious year for Stanford do athletics here seem to be reach
ing their Golden Age, but chiefly for the reason that the year has seen
a very large and a very loyal body of men out for all the sports. "()ne
hundred and seventy-five men have trained for track faithfully and
well for the entire season. It was with great regret that we were forced
to cut the squad down at the beginning of this week." '"Ins was the
appreciative statement made today by Captain P. B. McKee, 14. Ihe
Daily Palo Alto gladly takes this opportunity to express the thanks
not onlv of Captain McKee and Coach Campbell but of the entire stu
dent body to these men who are prevented from winning athletic fame
by mere inches or seconds or fifths of seconds. We venture to repeat
a previous statement that when it comes to estimating an athlete as a
man, the University public does not inquire whether or 110 he wears a
big "S," but whether or not he has trained honestly, and given all he
has in the endeavor.
