# Council Takes Action
## 
### 
The following letter has been sent
to six men students by the Stanford
Council.
University Conference,
Student Council.
Dear Sir:
I am instructed by the Student
Council of the University Conference
to write you this letter disapproving
of your late action in shaving Mr.
Ray. The fact that Mr. Ray is a grad
uate student in the University, re
moved in class six years from the men
who engaged in the proceeding against
him should have rendered him im
mune from any such treatment. Also,
the fact that some of those who en
gaged in the matter were not on the
best terms with Mr. Ray should have
prompted them to keep out of the af
fair entirely.
No action will be taken in this mat
ter beyond the sending to you of this
letter, because we are convinced from
yesterday's investigation that no ill
feeling entered the episode, and that
the steps were taken without due
thought of all the circumstances, in
the belief that the whole matter
would be passed off by Mr. Ray as a
joke. This belief appears to have
been without good foundation, and the
protestations of Mr. Ray to have been
made in all sincerity.
Trusting that in the future, in all
departments of the University, due re
gard will be had for the personal
rights of others, and that such ac
tions will not be entered upon against
the will of the party concerned;
Sincerely,
L. D. SUMMERI'TELD,
President University Conference.
