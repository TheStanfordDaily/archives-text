# City Street Arabs Will Enjoy Picnic on Farm Tomorrow
## 
### 
Sunshine, lunch on the campus, a
glorious splash in Lagunita, and a
happy day in the frien out-of-doors
for twenty-five little ragamuffins from
San Francisco will be provided to
morrow by the local auxiliary of the
Stanford Clinic.
Through the agency of a student or
ganization these ragged urchins of the
city, culled by the Lane hospital au
thorities from destitute homes and
the streets, will be given a peep into
a new order of things. The experience
of many of them is bounded by the
walls of tenement shacks, saloon doors
and charity wards in the hospitals.
Even the ride up to Palo Alto, with all
its stops at way stations which are
such a dreary part of the travel of
many people, will lie a joyous excur
sion.
Glowing from contact with the
scrub-brush and suds, and resplendent
in their clean gingham finery or over
alls, the host of picnickers will swoop
down on the campus at about 10
o'clock in charge of two members of
I the Auxiliary. The girls will be
jtreated to a lunch by the sororities
iand the male element will be given a
"square" at some of the fraternity
houses.
Besides a splashing party at Lagu
nita, the picnic program includes a
baseball game and all sorts of outdoor
I fun. .
