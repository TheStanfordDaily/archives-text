# "THE COLLEGE QUINCE" WILL BE PRESENTED BY FRESHMEN COMEDIANS
## 
### 
Eight big acts, each one a feature in
itself, is the brief summary of the
Freshman vaudeville show which the
Class of 1917 will stage next Friday
evening at the Varsity Theatre. For
the past two weeks the first year ac
tors have been rehearsing daily their
various comedy and musical acts, and
a well-performed show may be antici
pated.
The proceeds from the performance
next Friday evening in all probability
will go to the defraying of the ex
penses of the Stanford tennis team on
its intended trip East this summer.
Definite action will be taken by the
Freshmen tomorrow at their class
meeting.
The latest addition to the program
is a side-splitting take-off on the Jun
ior Opera entitled "The College
Quince." There are seven parts of
equal strength in the performance.
The men's roles will be handled by F.
J. Leard, R. D. Lillie, M. E. Tedford
and D. M. Frank, while the female im
personators are G. K. Howard, W. 11.
Bonnett and W. F. Dingley. The skit
promises to be one of the bright spots
of the evening, and will be the first
act on the program.
A male quartette, composed of F. O.
Rose. H. M. Stanley, O. G. Lachmurid
and 11. I!. Fletcher, will follow with
some original and humorous songs.
The third act will be a tumbling
and trapeze stunt by L. W. Owen
and G. N. Whiting. L. E. Cole
and C. L. Hunter will next afford
amusement with a startling artillery
of coon jokes and songs of the char
acteristic Alabama type. The fifth
number on the program will be taken
care of by G. N. Whiting and J. G.
Cross, who will present a dramatic
dance tinged with burlesque. D.
E. Shepardson, one of the stunt
men on the glee club tour, will render
violin selections. The seventh num
ber will be the very latest popular airs
by a band of first year musicians play
ing on mandolins, ukeleles, guitars and
banjos.
The grand finale of the evening, a
clever little Stanford comedy en
twined with romance and humor, en
titled "The Make Up Girl," will com
plete the evening's entertainment. The
leading roles will be assumed by J. S.
Higley, It. L. Johnston and G. C. Col
lins, Misses K. A. Sheldon and A. S.
Boezinger.
Two performances will be given, one
at 7:30 and another at 8:45. An ad
mission price of 25 cents will be
charged.
