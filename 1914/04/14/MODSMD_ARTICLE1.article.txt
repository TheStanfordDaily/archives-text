# STRATFORD TROUPE PLAYS TO APPRECIATIVE HOUSE
## SHAKESPEAREAN SPIRIT REVIVED IN "TWELFTH NIGHT" Large Audience Greets Efforts of Frederick Benson Company With Enthusiastic Applause. 
### Anita Allen 
"Twelfth Night," played as Shakes
peare must have intended it to be
played, was presented yesterday in the
Assembly Hail by the Stratford-upon-
Avon troupe, appearing under the
auspices of the faculty committee on
public entertainment.
Accustomed as we are to the use of
Shakespearean dramas for the ex
ploitation of an individual actor, the
method pursued by these earnest
Stratford folk comes as a surprise.
Here we have no star surrounded by
mediocre support, but a well-rounded
and satisfying production in which
each role is presented with force and
finish. Their treatment of the bard's
work is free but not irreverent, and
is marked by insight and artistic per
ception.
Miss Dorothy Green certainly gave
a most truly Shakespearean interpre
tation of the part of Viola, seeking,
as we are sure Viola must have done,
to look and act the boy as success
fully as possible without continual
display cf self-conscious girliohncs3.
Mr. Benson's characterization of M;tl
volio was drawn with broad and tell
ing strokes, making a humorously
grotesque figure of the strutting, sell
satisfied official. The effect of the de
lineation was marred only by a re
grettable tendency toward indistinct
ness in delivery.
The Feste of Frank Cochrane was
a delight, and his Old English songs
increased the atmosphere of poetic
fantasy which so strangely alternates
■with broadest comedy in "Twelfth
Night." Murray Carrington made the
most of that interesting romantic,
Orsino, which part, however, gave
him small opportunity to show the
qualities which have elsewhere won
such praise for his superb acting.
Sir Toby Belch and Sir Andrew
Aguecheek, in the bands of Randle
Ayrton and Alfred Harris, introduced
the broadly farcical element of the
play. These characters indeed tended
rather too much toward caricature,
making it hard to realize that Sir
Toby, as a relation of the Lady Olivi i,
is a gentleman by birth, and that Sir
Andrew is any more than a fit candi
date for the asylum. The part of
Olivia as enacted by Miss Marion
Foreman, carried less conviction than
most of the other portrayals, but this
may be explained by the illness ol
Miss Ethel McDowall who was to have
assumed the role. The Maria of Miss
Rosa Burgess and the Antonio of Ru
pert Conrick were both admirably
handled.
The scenery belonging to the As
sembly Hall stage was perhaps not
all that might have been wished as a
setting for such a performance, but the
nine changes necessary were made so
quickly as to do away with any ted
iously long pauses.
