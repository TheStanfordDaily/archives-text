# A 						WORTHY CAUSE

Conscious of the dignity of its twenty-two years at Stanford, the
Daily Palo Alto believes in keeping Freshmen in their place, and seldom
risks enlarging their bumps of self-esteem by praise. \et we cannot
refrain from remarking that in voting to devote the proceeds of their
vaudeville show to the eastern trip of the tennis team the Freshmen
have done exactly the right thing.
Since tennis at Stanford was made a minor rather than a major
sport —an action which we believe to have been advisable —the sport
has been fighting heavy odds. Lured by the prospect of a \ arsity let
ter and with the knowledge that in number of courts and character of
tennis equipment Stanford is excelled by many institutions of inferior
size, the better tennis players are naturally attracted to other colleges.
By sheer luck, however, Stanford has had a band of loyal and expert
racket wielders who have kept the game on its feet. It will be a pleasure
to see a couple of these players and the sport which they represent re
ceive due recognition in the form of an eastern trip.
Moreover, because of the intense interest in tennis in the East,
and because of the advertising and honor which Stanford would receive
through the almost assured success of our men in a majority of their
matches, the trip would in all probability prove an impetus to tennis on
the campus. Those who feel that the example of the Freshmen in vot
ing to support this Eastern tour is worthy of emulation, and who may
have suggestions or aid of a more substantial character to offer, are
asked to"note that the fund necessary to insure the trip has not yet been
entirely raised.
