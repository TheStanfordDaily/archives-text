# ARMY MANEUVERS SITE MAY BE SELECTED HERE
## Presidio Officers Thought to Be Considering Location in Hills Near Campus. 
### 
j A location in the hills back of the
campus may be used as the site for
annual military maneuvers. This
morning a party of army officers from
the San Francisco Presidio arrived in
Palo Alto, and later passed the cam
pus on their way to the hills beyond
Lagunita.
Though the object of their mission
was not disclosed, it is thought that
they were commissioned to make sur
veys of the land for a possible prac
tice ground and encampment plot.
