# STANFORD OVAL IN IDEAL SHAPE FOR SATURDAY MEET
## Shelter Erected for 220-Dash Men.— Four Are Added to Training Table. 
### 
An excellent track for the Inter
collegiate meet of next Saturday af
ternoon is the result of many months
of careful attention of the genial
"Sam" and his corps of assistants.
The cinder path has been repeatedly
plowed and dragged until it is in that
prime condition that could harm no
athletes, and which presages fast
times in the competition against Cali
fornia. The jumping pits have re
ceived attention, as have the hammer
cape and the shot-put site, and all
are in an equally excellent condition.
An iron fence has been placed be
tween the inner turf and the pole
vault standards to prevent interfer
ence from the track.
A new addition to the equipment of
the Oval is the shelter at the head of
the 220 yard straightaway. A cool
! place yet sheltered from the wind has
long been the want of the men who
hav« been compelled to wait at the
[head of the stretch for their event.
! A small structure containing benches
jhas been erected in the past weeks to
meet this want.
The training bouse has been re
arranged. placing Trainer Malonev's
headquarters at hand. He will thus
be able to give immediate attention
to any injuries that should happen
during the meet.
Since the first posting of the list.
;of the men who were to eat at the

j added because of the improvement of
I their showing at the oval. These men
are A. R. Edwards, '14. H. B. Wolcott,
