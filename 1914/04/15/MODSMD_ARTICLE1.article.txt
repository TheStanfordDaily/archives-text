# VARSITY SHOWS IMPROVED FORM IN MIDWEEK GAME
## STANFORD WORSTS IRELAND'S MEN BY 4-1 SCORE Maple, Hayes, and Halm Receive Twirling Workout; Each Nine Totals Six Safeties. 
### 
Terry's men took the long end of a
4 to 1 score in yesterday's game with
Ireland's Independents. The play was
rather slow and featureless, the Var
sity taking a lead of three runs in
the second inning and annexing an
other in the following frame. It was
not until the final inning that the visi
tors made an impression on the sco-e
board. Isoth sides broke even in the
hitting column with six each.
The nine innings were divided evenly
between the three Stanford pitchers.
Maple opened for three innnings and
was relieved by Hayes, who was in
turn succeeded by Halm for the la.it
three frames. Two bingles were
gleaned off Maple's service, but they
were sufficiently separated for safety.
During his term Hayes pitched shut
out ball, allowing only three men to
bat in each inning.
The visitors' lone tally came in the
ninth. With two outs Pourroy found
Halm's delivery for a triple and was
brought home on a single by Selig.
Dent was first to score for Stanford
in the second inning and was followed
soon by Maple and Terry. In the
next inning Noonan registered the
fourth tally. Score:
The only double play occurred in
the eighth. With Cullen on lirst Per
kins drove a hot one into Halm's
glove. Halm's throw to Terry cut off
Cullen at second. Terry then doubled
to Workman, intercepting Perkins at
first base.
