# GENTLEMEN, BE SEATED!

I low the compelling and veracious advertising which has been
emanating 1 from the pens of the advance agents for the I rack Show
could have failed to make necessary the S. R. O. sign today passeth
understanding. Yet we are informed on credible authority that, as the
good old proverb has it.a few choice seats still remain unsold. All
joking aside, these "shades" of Haverly, Primrose and West (so de
nominated by the press agent )—these gutter-snipes whom the manage
ment, like another Campus Auxiliary, has gathered from the dreary
tenements along the Row —are going to give us The One Real Show.
If it were not so we would not print it on this pure white space. \\ ith
due regard to Frederick R. Benson we declare that for the guy who
wears an honest-to-goodness flannel shirt on weekdays this show holds
more promise of keen delight than any which has been staged at Stan
ford in many a moon. Not a soul in the University would begrudge
fifty cents to send our track team East. Why he should he so skittish
about giving the fifty cents and getting back two hours of fun and frolic
for himself is hard to figure. Sam Macdonald in song and story is
alone worth the price of admission. When the curtain rises and the
"Stanford Wins Again" banner drops on Saturday evening not a scat
in the house should be unsold.
