# JUDGE BEASLEY LECTURES ON CALIFORNIA PRACTICE
## San Jose Authority Gives Practical Advice on Problems of California Lawyers. 
### 
Judge Beasley, of the Superior
Court of San Jose, gave an informal
talk last evening before the students
of the Law Department on the sub
ject of "California Practice."
He addressed especially the class in
California Practice, and touched on
some of the problems which arise for
a young lawyer. In regard to choos
ing a location for the practice of law
in this state, his advice was to start
in either some very large city, or in
one of the growing interior towns.
He also discussed the attitude to be
assumed in the court room, the rela
tion of attorney and client, and
warned the men to "serve only the
one jealous mistress, the law," and
not to divide their interests anions
other pursuits.
