The Stanford baseball tans wtl'l
have the last opportunity of sizing
up his hopes when the Varsity nine
faces Ireland's Independents for the
second midweek game tomorrow af
ternoon at 4 : in. This will be the Inst
action for the Cardinal players before
they enter the deciding contest of the
intercollegiate series on Saturday
morning, and the Varsity's perform
ance, especially in the hitting depart
ment, will be anxiously watched.
For tomorrow's play "Cap" Ireland
will strengthen his aggregation in an
attempt to reverse the result of yes
terday's contest between the two
teams. It is probable thslt Forker,
veteran twirler of former California
Varsities, will again do service on the
mound against Stanford batsmen.
The presence of Clif Ireland tossing
off choice "bon mots" for every play
will be an enlivening feature of the
game.
Halm will start the twirling for the
Varsity, although it is planned to use
both Maple and Hayes during the
course of the play. The rest of the
line-up will be the same that has
played in the two California games.
