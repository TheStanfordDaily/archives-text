# VARIETY PERVADES MINSTREL FROLIC
## 
### 
Most anybody will admit that it is
nice to go to the Assembly Hall sev
eral times a year and try to figure
some of the curves that these dramatic
highbrows 1 il<e to lob across the foot
lights. But for five years the public
has longed for something different.
And here it comes, a funfest full of
jokes that will get over without a dic
tionary.
This Track Show which is going to
hold the boards next Saturday even
ing is a big assortment of pre-digested
comedy and tuneful music.
The second half of the program will
j be a minstrel jubilee of specialties
and song hits. There are some coons
! in the show, both real and artificial,
jwho will make their first appearance
'on any stage. The campus has never
known that they could act, and neither
| did they until the management started
a roundup of talent. The cast ranges
all the way from athletic stars to the
veriest "drys" in any culture depart
ment.
Take a look at the following songs,
which will be sprinkled through the
first half of the performance: "Good
bye, Boys," "I'll Lend You Anything
Except My Wife," "Pullman Porters
'on Parade," "Mary, You're a Little
Bit Old-Fashioned," "This Is the
1 Life," "All Aboard for Dixie," "Con
-1 stantly," and then some more.
| Variety, and plenty of it, is the idea
I back of the Track Show program.
I The first half will be monopolized by
a league of vaudeville specialists.

Take a look at the names of the enter
tainers. Then buy your tickets be
fore they are all gone.
Dick Morgan and Miss Jean Long
are going to clasp hands and tread
a joy path through one of the filmiest
song and dance romances which has
ever delighted a local audience. "Cu- ;
pid's Special" is a fast train, and
when it starts will carry a quartet
chorus composed of Misses Frances
Akin, Maude Lowell, Katrina John
son and Lorena Wilcox.
The qualities of that well-known
quartet composed of Karl Levy, E. H.
Hall, Chauncey Keefer, and Sid Walk
er need not be boosted. Their har
mony concerts have too often perco
lated through the moonlight of La
gunita shores to require description.
The one big surprise of the whole
show will be the appearance of the
"grand old phrenologist." Positively
new before the Stanford footlights,
and yet he has been known in May
field stage history for years! He has
as good a line as the best of them,
and can find knowledge bumps on a
billiard ball. When he clog-foots on
to the stage and says "Ladies and
gentlemen, we have witli us tonight,"
you will recognize good old Sam Mc-
Donald.
