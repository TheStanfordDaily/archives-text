# Playing of Frederick Preston Search Is Lacking in Finish of Technique.
## By Anita Allen. 
### Anita Allen 
Frederick Preston Search, violon
cellist, assisted by Robert Raymond
Lippit, pianist, gave his first recital
here yesterday evening in the Assem
bly Hall under the auspices of the
Stanford (ilee Club. Mr. Search has
a superb instrument and attains re
markable purity of tone, but his work
decidedly lacks finish of technique.
His most successful numbers proved
to be the Schumann "Adagio" and his
own "Traumerei am Garda-See," both
legato in style. He was on the whole
at his best in the legato numbers, ex
cept when he tended to carry over the
legato between the phrases, as in the
Beethoven Minuet, a selection rather
to light for his instrument.
Beethoven's Sonata in A Major was
perhaps the most difficult number of
the evening and received prolonged
applause. In the second movement the
'cellist slighted his stacatto notes,
failing as throughout the program, to
make them clear and true, and show
ing some inaccuracy in reaching his
upper notes. Mr. Lippit's playing, like
Mr. Search's, lacks magnetism. His
accompaniments proved rather more
sympathetic than his solo work.
Mrs. Sara Bibby-Brown's singing
was a treat and her sparkling group
of songs called forther their merited
aplause. Mendelssohn's brililant
"Fruhlingslied" was followed by Max
Reger's charming "Waldeinsamkeit,"
and"A Birthday," by Woodman. As
an encore the artist rendered Harris's
exquisite "Madrigal." Mrs. Bibby-
Brown has a soprano voice of lyric
quality, very clear and flexible. She
takes her high notes brilliantly and
with apparent ease.
