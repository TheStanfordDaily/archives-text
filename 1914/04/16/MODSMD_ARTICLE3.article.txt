# CLOSE SCORE IS PREDICTED IN SATURDAY’S TRACK MEET

### F.C. Hamilton, ’15 
The Stanford and the California
camps report their men in prime con
dition for what promises to be one 01'
the most evenly contested track meets
held between the rival institutions.
The representatives of the Blue and
Gold and of the Cardinal will contest
on the Stanford oval on Saturday.
The first race will be started at 2:30
o'clock, while the hammer throw will
precede the firing of the first pistol
by half an hour.
Just who will win the big meet is
the question uppermost in the minds
of all track enthusiasts. The eyes of
all college men up and down the coast,
will be focused on the Stanford cam
pus on Saturday until the final re
turns are received. To dope a track
meet is impossible. Experience shows
the fallacy of trying to pick the win
ner of the meet, let alone picking the
men who will place in each event.
Never before in the history of the two
universities have the teams been so
evenly matched on the eve of battle.
Surprises are bound to be sprung on
Saturday as they have been in twenty
meets prior to this. Stanford ha..s
come to realize that Walter Christie's
proteges are always a certain per cent
better in competition against Stanford
than they are any other time of the
season. Just who are the dark hors s
wearing the blue and gold remains a
mystery.
Stanford's strength rests in a vet
eran team. Last year tit > Cardinal de
pended to a greater d< re? on the
showing of the first-year stars. . i

the meet on Saturday not more than
five Freshmen are counted on for
places, and they will be second or
third place men.
Followers of both squads have pre
dicted various results as possible
scores in the meet. But even the
most ardent Cardinal fan is far from
certain of victory. It will be a race
from start to finish, but the team that
wins out will probably do so before
the relay race is won. Whether the
winner is our friend the enemy or the
red-striped runners remains to be
seen. Stanford has lost several sure
first place men during the past se
mester and these points may lose the
meet. One certain fact remains su
preme, and that is, the Cardinal track
enthusiasts are far from being over
confident, for they realize that results
depend on many eleventh hour sur
prises that always feature a meet.
The Mile
The close races promised this year
lias caused the interest in the meet
to be directed to individual events.
Competition in the mile run is certain
to bring forth first class results.
Stanford will base her hopes on
"Skin" Wilson, Aupperle, Mosher,
Swiggart, Irwin and Worthy. The
Blue and Gold lias placed confidence
in Harry Wood, E. Wright, E. Davis,
Vedder, Manley and Burgess. Last
year Wilson broke the tape in 4:2(1; 3,
establishing a new Stanford-California
record. Although Wood ran second
in the race, his form has improved
much this year and he is reported to
have been clocked in close to 4:17.
Several of California's milers can do
close to 4:30, while Stanford has two
comers in Mosher and Aupperle.
In the sprints Coach Campbell, Cap
tain McKee, Grant, Brown, Needham
and Nikalson will pit their strength
and skill against the cream of Berk
eley. Threikeld, Stanton, Bradwav
and Hazeltinc must be reckoned with
in the results. Stanton is reported
to have recovered his old time form,
and if this is the correct dope, the
California veteran may be counted on
at the tape. McKee and Needham
have done very little running in com
petition this year, although the Stan
ford captain has been timed in 10 flat
in the only meet that he has entered
tliis season. Campbell made a new
Stanford mark of : 21:4 seconds in the
furlong early in the semester.
Preble, Maker and Knapp are the
mainstays of California in the high
hurdles. Murray and Norton will be
forced to extend themselves for bet
ter time than has been made this sea
son in the high sticks to defeat Preble,
the best of the trio from across the
bay. He is credited with :15:3 in
competition and will probably do bet
ter on the Stanford track.
The Quarter
Each team has entered six men in
the quarter mile rnn. Against Camp
bell. Chace, Richdale and Card, Wal
ter Christie has entered Meyer, Clark,
Woodruff and Wadsworth. Clark has
come through with a rash this season,
with Meyer as an able teammate.
Campbell has a better record to his
crodit than either of the opponents,
while Chace may be counted on by

the Cardinal adherents to give an ac
count of himself on the borne stretch
against his opponents.
Zeille, Stovvitts, Swain, Vedder and
Spindts have been picked as the Cali
fornia representatives in the two mile
grind. Poster, who made a new Stan
ford record of 9:58:3 a week ago,
should make the wearers of the Blue
and Gold extend themselves to win
all three places. As teammates to
Foster, Cox, Wilson, Field, Wright
and Branner have been entered. Cox
will be remembered for the good race
which he put up in the cross country
run last fall. It is hardly probable
that Wood of California will run the
two mile after entering the four lan
events.
In the low hurdles Maclise of Cali
fornia will don spikes against Stan
ford for the first time since 1012. Hi?
has been on the sick list until a few
weeks ago, and if in condition on Sat
urday, is sure to make the Stanford
jtimber toppers hustle.
Great interest in the meet has cen
tered around the results in the haif
mile run. Bonnett is the central flg
i ure of the Stanford entries on ac
j count of his recent remarkable per
formance in the 18S0, when he equaled
! the Coast record of 1:55:1. Wilson,
TTawley, Boomershire, Irwin and West
have been picked as his teammates.
Several of these men are capable of
2:00 flat or better. Captain Earl
Crabbe of the visiting team has nnlv
been entered in one event, the half
mile. With Crabbe, Cuendett and El
mendorf all doing better than even
time, and Tteisen as a dark horse i/i
the Blue and Gold squad, the pros
pects are for a nip and tuck tug to
the finish, with Stanford a shade the
better on paper.
The team that wins the relay will
not necessarily win the meet. On the
other hand it looks as if the meet
would be won before the final event,
arid tho relay go to the losing aggre
gation. .lust who will represent Stan
ford in the four lap event depends
largely on the personnel of the other
events. Among the probabilities are
Campbell, Wolcott, West, Murray,
Card, Rich dale, Edwards and Fithian.
Field Events
Stanford can expect to win few
points in either the hammer throw
or high jump. With such men as Wi
ley, Coolidge and ITadley as oppo
nents the Stanford quartet of King,
Endersby, Miller and Wolford will
have to do close to 150 feet to place,
and this is highly improbable from
past performances of Cardinal ham
mer throwers. For the first time in
several years the Cardinal will lack
first class high jumpers. Stanford
will rely on Lachmund, Campbell and
West in the high jump. Five feet 10
inches is the highest mark reached
by any of the trio. The Blue and Gold
jumpers will depend on Nichols for
first place. The Freshman from Po
mona. leappd over fi feet 4 inches less
than a week ago, while McFie and
Airola are doing considerably over
the six foot mark.
The pole vault and shot put seem
an advantage to the Stanford team.
In the vaulting event Saylor appears
the most likely contestant and will
compete under the Cardinal colors for

the first time this year. With Bob
Krohn and Phillips clearing over
twelve feet, and Macomber in condi
tion, Stanford will probably have the
bulge on the points in this event.
Nichols, Frisbie, Gaven, Gibbs, Bangs,
Smith and Graves must be reckoned
with as they have cleared the bar
close to the twelve foot mark several
times. Bedeau, Bihlman, Campbell,
Murray and Kohner will toss the shot
for Stanford. The results are very
uncertain because it is rumored th.it
one of the California heavers is put
ting the weight close to 43 feet. The
California entries are Doyle, Chatoin,
Moulux, Lee, Coolidge and McFie.
California will send into the field a
strong list of entries in the broad
jump. The Blue and Gold places re
liance 011 Maker, Bradway, Duque,
Basye, Bogardus, Airola and Nichols.
The first named has leaped close to
the 23 foot mark recently, and will
have to extend himself to boat out
two of his teammates who are jump
ing well over 22 feet. Sisson, Knight,
O. Lachmund, Dingley and Chapman
constitute the Cardinal athletes who
will contest in the event.
