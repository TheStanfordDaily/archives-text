The Stanford and the California
camps report their men in prime con
dition for what promises to be one 01'
the most evenly contested track meets
held between the rival institutions.
The representatives of the Blue and
Gold and of the Cardinal will contest
on the Stanford oval on Saturday.
The first race will be started at 2:30
o'clock, while the hammer throw will
precede the firing of the first pistol
by half an hour.
Just who will win the big meet is
the question uppermost in the minds
of all track enthusiasts. The eyes of
all college men up and down the coast,
will be focused on the Stanford cam
pus on Saturday until the final re
turns are received. To dope a track
meet is impossible. Experience shows
the fallacy of trying to pick the win
ner of the meet, let alone picking the
men who will place in each event.
Never before in the history of the two
universities have the teams been so
evenly matched on the eve of battle.
Surprises are bound to be sprung on
Saturday as they have been in twenty
meets prior to this. Stanford ha..s
come to realize that Walter Christie's
proteges are always a certain per cent
better in competition against Stanford
than they are any other time of the
season. Just who are the dark hors s
wearing the blue and gold remains a
mystery.
Stanford's strength rests in a vet
eran team. Last year tit > Cardinal de
pended to a greater d< re? on the
showing of the first-year stars. . i

the meet on Saturday not more than
five Freshmen are counted on for
places, and they will be second or
third place men.
Followers of both squads have pre
dicted various results as possible
scores in the meet. But even the
most ardent Cardinal fan is far from
certain of victory. It will be a race
from start to finish, but the team that
wins out will probably do so before
the relay race is won. Whether the
winner is our friend the enemy or the
red-striped runners remains to be
seen. Stanford has lost several sure
first place men during the past se
mester and these points may lose the
meet. One certain fact remains su
preme, and that is, the Cardinal track
enthusiasts are far from being over
confident, for they realize that results
depend on many eleventh hour sur
prises that always feature a meet.
The Mile
The close races promised this year
lias caused the interest in the meet
to be directed to individual events.
Competition in the mile run is certain
to bring forth first class results.
Stanford will base her hopes on
"Skin" Wilson, Aupperle, Mosher,
Swiggart, Irwin and Worthy. The
Blue and Gold lias placed confidence
in Harry Wood, E. Wright, E. Davis,
Vedder, Manley and Burgess. Last
year Wilson broke the tape in 4:2(1; 3,
establishing a new Stanford-California
record. Although Wood ran second
in the race, his form has improved
much this year and he is reported to
