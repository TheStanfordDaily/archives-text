# GIVE ’EM THE AXE!
## 
### 
For variety's sake we wish that something- original could be said
to inspire and encourage our men on the eve of battle. Yet, after all,
these athletes of many sports do not need the encouragement of mere
words. Every one of them possesses the quiet confidence which comes
from sound physical condition, from the knowledge that he has done
everything in his power as a man to make himself supreme in his par
ticular event, and from the realization that on him rest the hopes and
trust of the students, who will support him with an echo of his own
Stanford Fighting Spirit to the end.
We have previously had occasion to express our supreme confi
dence in Stanford's great little ball team. This confidence is now great
er than before. The fans hope to sec Zeb's men register the fourth vic
tory of the week-end against the Blue and Gold—the other three being
won by our chess players, our women fencers and our tennis men. From
the first two teams much is expected; the tennis players, whether their
crown be thorns or laurels, will beyond the shadow of a doubt fight the
game fight till "point, set, match and tournament" is called.
To sink the Stanford Axe deeper "right in the neck" of the Golden
Bear—this is the job of the trackmen. On these blue-bloods of the ath
letic world centers a peculiar interest. Destined, as they are, to meet
opponents of might and mettle, over-confidence should be the last hoo
doo to overtake them. But nothing can shake the faith of those who
know these track men. They have a captain who is the friend of his
men and always master of the situation; their coaching has been in the
highest degree practical and effective; their physical conditioning has
been perfect; and as an athlete and as a man every entrant tomorrow
is above reproach. When this, which promises to be the most mem
orable of Stanford-California meets, has become history, we believe it
will be pleasant history for the Cardinal.
