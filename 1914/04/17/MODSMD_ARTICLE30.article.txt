### 
The twelfth United States infantry
regiment, under the leadership of
Colonel Blatchford, lias taken up defi
nite quarters within a mile of the
campus for the purpose of maneuver
ing. The regiment, some seven hun
dred and thirty strong, arrived in
Palo Alto last Wednesday. Thirty of
these are commissioned officers and
the remainder enlisted men.
The United States government has
rented an extensive portion of ground
from the Stanford estate for the pur
pose of drilling the soldiers in field
work and mimic warfare practice.
The Presidio grounds, where this de
tachment is stationed, are too small
for satisfactory maneuvers as re
quired by the War Department.
At present the regiment is in charge
of Major Rosem of San Francisco.
This morning the entire body marched
from their temporary quarters in Pa':o
Alto, up University avenue, and oul
Lasuen street to the foothills, where
they will establish permanent camp.
The government plans to keep the
troops for at least four or five weeks
on the estate, engaged in extensive
drills. The students are welcome to
witness these field maneuvers of f Tie
soldiers, which are sure to be of great
interest.
Lieutenant A. L. itockwood, '11,
is among the officers on the trip.
Rockwood was a member of the Delta
Tan Delta fraternity.
