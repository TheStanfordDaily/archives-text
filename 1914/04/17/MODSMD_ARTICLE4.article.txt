ter than even time in both the cen

of 6 feet 3 7-S inches in the high jump
will be another record to go by the
boards. Nichols of California is do
ing a trifle higher than this in prac
tice. The pole vault record, held by
Lcland Stanford Scott, and the mark
of 2") seconds flat in the low hurdles
are two other events to be figured in

estimating the probable number of
new records.
Special trains will be run from the

crowds which will attend the ball
game in the morning and the meet in

for the dual contest will be $1.
Coach Campbell when asl;ed l:is
