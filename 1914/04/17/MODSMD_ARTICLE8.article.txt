# RIVAL VARSITIES CLASH ON DIAMOND TOMORROW
## DECIDING MA ME IS SCHEDULED FOR TEN-THIRTY Art Halm Will Work in Box for Stanford, With Dooling in Left. 
### 
Tomorrow morning the Stanford
and California nines meet on the
Stanford diamond in the third and
deciding struggle for the 1914 inter
collegiate series. In the first two
games victory rested first with one,
then with the other, thus necessitat
ing the third game to determine the
championship.
Both line-ups will be slightly alt
ered for the final contest. The Cardi
nal nine which lias served through
the first two games without change
will have one shift and a substitu
tion. Halm will give up bis regular
position in the left lield to open the
game in the pitcher's box, while Dool
ing is slated to fill the resulting out
field vacancy.
Halm and Dent have worked as the
Cardinal battery in a number of the
pre-season games and should prove
effective tomorrow. Halm is a left
hander, which may prove to his ad
vantage against the Blue and Gold
sluggers. Maple, Hayes and Hoever
will form the pitching staff from
which substitutions may be made.
Dooling has served a long appren
ticeship on Stanford baseball squads,
and this season lias developed, espe
cially in the fielding department, into
worthy timber for a Varsity berth.
Workman at first, Stafford at sec
ond, McCloskey at third, and Captain
Terry at short constitutes the regular
infield. Day will fill his customary
position at center, while Noonan will
cover the right field.
Th? only uncertainty on the Blue
and Gold line-up seems to be the
pitcher. Final choice lies between
Gefkin and Dodge. "Dope" would
seem to favor as the probable
(wirier to open. Captain Rubke will
play the shortstop position. Ilis ab
sence in the first game was a weak
spot in the California Varsity, and
bis playing in the second game was
ncticeably effective.
With the improved hitting ability
shown by the Stanford hopes in yes
terday's game, confidence in the re
sult of Saturday's play has returned
by leaps and bounds. An important
factor in the outcome will be the
ability of the Stanford pitching staff
to hold down the hard-biting bats
men of the State team.
The game will be called on tbe
Stanford baseball diamond at 10:30
tomorrow morning. Admission will be
50 cents.
