# STANFORD MEN BEST THEIR RIVALS IN TRACK MEET; SCORE 66 5-6 TO 55 1-6 CALIFORNIA NINE TAKES THIRD BASEBALL GAME AND SERIES; SCORE 5-3
## BLUE AND GOLD OBTAINS THREE-RUN LEAD IN FIRST INNING--TIMELY HITTING SPELLS VICTORY 
### 
California won the intercollegiate
baseball series by taking this morn
ing's game by a 5 to 3 score. Play
did not begin until 11:15, due to the I
tardy arrival of the California play- |
ers, and resembled the first game i
played here in the frequent interrup- j
tions that caused the game to run to
2 o'clock. An overflow crowd from '
the baseball bleachers covered all '
advantageous standing room and the j
top of the football bleachers.
Hoth teams secured ten hits, but the I
Cardinal runners were unable to con
vert hits into runs. Tight playing in
pinches by the Blue and Gold fielders, ;
misjudgment on the part of Stanford
runners, and the misfortune of mere i
hairsbreadths prevented a number of ;
near scores. On the other hand the j
California batsmen bunched their hit
ting to advantage, and were assisted
by untimely walks off the Cardinal
twirlers.
California started the damage in the
first inning, when three runs were
piled up on the strength of a pair of
hits and two walks. Again in the next
two frames the Hlue and Gold run
ners crossed the plate for scores j
bringing their total to five at the end j
of the third inning. It remained at |
this point throughout the rest of the |
game. Stanford scored one run each
inning for three innings beginning
with the third, but the California lead
was not. to be overcome.
Two pitchers were used by both ;
sides, llalm, who started for Stan-,
ford, was replaced in the first after a j
poor start by Hayes, who completed •
the play. Dodge for California went
out in the third inning for Gefkin.
Hoth of the Cardinal twirlers were
handled hard by their opponents ai
times, and were all too liberal with
their walks to first, one run being
forced on a walk.

STANFORD—Terry flew out to
O'Hara, and Stafford hit safe but went
out at second on Workman's drive to
