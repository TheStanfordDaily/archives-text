# BERKELEY RACQUET MEN WIN ON LOCAL COURTS
## DAVIS AND LIPMAN VICTORS IN SINGLES MATCHES Breck and Breeden Are Winning Combination.—Cardinal Players Force Opponents in Fast Play. 
### 
By capturing two singles matches
yesterday afternoon and the second
doubles today, California made a
clean sweep of the intercollegiate ten
nis tournament. Although going
down to defeat, the Cardinal racket
wielders played brilliantly and forced
their opponents to their utmost.
These three victories, combined with
the defeat of the Stanford first dou
bles team and their win in the third
singles two weeks ago, gives Califor
nia all five matches.
The first singles on Friday went to
Willis Davis, who defeated H. L.
Hahn, '16, in the feature match of the
tournament 6-3, 7-">. Captain L. Sloss,
'15, forced Robert Lipman to a three
let match in the second singles be
fore he was finally vanquished. The
scores were 6-8, 6-4, 6-3. This after
noon the Blue and Gold pair, Breeden
and Breck, took the final contest, the
second doubles, from F. S. Pratt, '13,
and J. S. Hutchinson, '16.
In the Davis-Halm match each man
started by taking his service until it
was three all, when Davis broke
through on the Stanford player's
serve. He followed his advantage np
by taking the next two games, which
rave him the set.
In the sixth game of the second set
the California racket wielder again
took Hahn's service, giving him a 4 to
2 lead. It was at this stage of the
match that the Stanford Sophomore
•ilayed his best game, breaking
through Davis's service for the first
time. After taking his own, he won
igain on his opponent's serve, placing
him ahead, 5 to 3. Davis then took
a brace and ran out the set, winning
7-f>, giving him the match.
A chance shot practically gave the
second singles to California. Slo-.s
needed but one point to make tl e
score four all in the deciding ser,
when one of Lipman's returns hit the
■let. he-Uated and then slid over. Li] -
man then proceeded to annex the next
•wo points, which gave him the game,
lie followed this by winning Sloss's
service, making him the victor.
Sloss won the first, set 8 to 6, each
"(layer taking his service until the
Stanford captain finally broke through
on bis opponent and captured the set.
Strangely enough, the striker won the
majority of games in the last, two sets,
a great many of which games went tc;
deuce before being decided. Sloss
played his opponent's back line in
-olendid fashion, and put more pace
on his strokes than did Lipman, but
the Blue and Gold racket wielder's
conservative and steady playing won
out for him.
