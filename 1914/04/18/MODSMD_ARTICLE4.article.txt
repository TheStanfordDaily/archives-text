## 
### 
Victory was Stanford's at the ernl
of the first race of the afternoon and
at the end of the meet. The most
well-balanced team that has repre
sented the Cardinal on the track re
turned an overwhelming victory over
the Blue and Gold, and the loss of the
baseball game of the morning was
forgotten when the final score of
G6 5-6 to 55 1-6 was announced. Not
since 1910 has Stanford turned the
trick on the team from across the
bay with such a large score.
0:;e Pacific Coast record, and five
Stanford -California Intercollegiate
records broken and two Intercolleg
iate records of the day equalled is a
part of the results of the meet. And
all these new marks were established
by members of the Stanford team.
As was expected "Skin" Wilson out
ran the entire field in the mile run,
winning from Wood, the California
hope, and establishing the first rec
ord of the day. The Stanford miler
broke the tape in 4:20 1-5, running
faster by more than four saco .ds than
he ever did before.
California dope was shattered in the
880 yard run. Bonnett of Stanford
reserved himself until the home
stretch in the second lap. Coming
down the straightaway lie passed
Cuendett. on whom California relied
for first place, and broke the Coast
record in 1:54 3-5. This also betters
the Stanford-California mark for the
distance by .1 3-5 seconds.
"Fro;" Murray ran the low hurdles
in :24 4-5 seconds, breaking the
Stanford-California record, hold bv
Beeson, by 1-5 of a second.
"Bob" Krohn placed himself on the
list of record holders when he cleared
the bar at 12 feet S 1-2 inches, mark
ing up a new record between the con
testants of the two universities.
Again in the relay Stanford broke
into the column of new times. Gard
Wolcott, Murray and Chace proved
themselves to be the fastest four-man
relay quarttet Stanford has yet
turned out. 3:21 3-5 is the new rec
ord established as an intercollegiate
mark for the mile relay.
Captain McKee equalled the record
time for the century held by Cadogan
and Abadie, both of California, when
he negotiated the distance in 10 sec
onds fiat. Coach Campbell also
equalled Coleman's intercollegiate
mark in the 220 by running the fur
long in 22 seconds flat. This was a
remarkable performance from the
fact that Campbell had already placed
third in the 100 and won the 440 in
50 1-5 seconds.
"Feg" Murray was the high point
winner of the day, totalling 12 1-4
noints to his credit. After winning
both hurdle races and taking third in
the shotput, he ran the third lap on
the winning relay team. Coach Camp
bell scored 11 points, the second

lii'-ihesit. number totalled by an indi
vidual. Stanford took ten first places
out of fourteen events, California
winning the hammer throw, broad
jump, high jump and two mile run.
Ten of the Stanford point winners
received their block "S" for the first
tife in track, including Norton, Bihl
raan, King, Foster, Otto Lachmund,
Sisson, Savior, Chace, Grant and Wol
cott. Four of these are Freshmen.
Hundreds of people were turned
away at the gates and could not gain
admission at any price. Before the
starter called the entries to the mark
in the mile every available seat in
the bleachers was taken, accommodat
ing 5,000 fans. The day was ideal,
with no wind and a hot sun beating
down on the best cinder track on the
Coast.
