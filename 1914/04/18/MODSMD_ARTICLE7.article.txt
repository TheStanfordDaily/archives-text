# SUNSHINE AND SHADOW

### 
We are proud to be Stanford men and women; but we are equally
proud of the opportunity to meet strong and spirited opponents in
triendly combat. Jt is indeed fortunate that the two great I niversities
of the state may oppose each other every year upon the field of sport
with forces so even as to insure close and thrilling contests in every
event in the athletic curriculum.
We said yesterday that we had boundless faith in Stanford's ball
team. That faith is still unshaken. This morning a good team was
beaten by a better one. To our chess players, our women fencers, and
our tennis men goes also naught but praise, with congratulations equally
hearty to the rivals who tied or vanquished them.
For us the palms of victory in track; but for our opponents of the
Blue and Gold surely no weeping willows! Stanford has not only ,i
brilliant track team but a dependable one. No falling down, no elev
enth-hour reversals of form, shattered the hopes of the Cardinal en
thusiasts. We are not so proud of the winning of the meet, considered
as a single event, but rather of that which it connotes. It shows that
Stanford has athletes of natural ability who have learned readily, have
done their work well in the long grind of training, and have thus ar
rived at superiority of which victory in today's meet, the final examina
tion of the training season, is an indication. Our hearty hand-clasp to
McKee and Campbell and their Merry Men!
