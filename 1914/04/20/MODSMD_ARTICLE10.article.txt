With the advent of the examination
schedules, those white-winged har
bingers of spring, conies the an
nouncement of the Senior farce, the
purpose of which is to relieve the
minds of the strain imposed by the
end-semester tests.
"Our Wives" concerns itself with
the adventures of four bachelors,
three of whom become married and
try to resurrect their bachelor joys
with their wives included. The action
centers around the inability of the
wives to mix.
The fourth bachelor views the
various contentions from the view
point of a woman-hater. However, he
is finally brought to see things in a
new light by means of the women
with whom he has been collaborating
as a mere machine.
