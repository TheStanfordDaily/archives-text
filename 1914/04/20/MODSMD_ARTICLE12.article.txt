Many generations of Stanford students have felt vaguely that there
was something in the proctor system of conducting examinations which
did not appeal to the highest in their natures. This feeling became par
ticularly acute in all who had had experience both in those departments
where it was apparently assumed that they possessed the desire to cheat,
and their ability to do so was challenged, and also in those departments
where they were treated as honorable gentlemen. In the first-mentioned
departments they found cheating rife; in the latter, a phenomenon
whose occurrence was as rare as it was abhorred. The Daily Palo Alto
is pleased that this feeling found early if very clumsy expression in
ihese columns. It is more pleased, however, that the logical basis and
philosophical background of this longing for a state of affairs in which
cheating in examinations shall be regarded as an offence against self
and student body rather than as a mere triumph over the instructor
have been splendidly set forth by an eloquent and high-bred gentleman
from the South. To attempt to enlarge upon Chancellor Kirkland's
arguments would be to paint the lily.
We believe that conditions arc ripe for the adoption of the honor
principle at Stanford. We have here a solidarity of undergraduate life
well adapted to the generation of that strong sentiment which must
attend the operation of the system. In our Conference and Council we
have at hand all the machinery needed for such a plan. And for the
honor principle we have surely a great need. May Chancellor Kirk
land's work of this morning bear fruit in a thoughtful and well-con
sidered vote on Wednesday in favor of the honor principle in exam
inations !
