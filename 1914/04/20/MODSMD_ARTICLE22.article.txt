## "Except a Man Be Born Anew He Can Not See the Kingdom of God" Is Text. 
### 
Choosing for his text "Except a
man be born anew he can not see the
kingdom of God," Bishop F. J. McCon
nell gave a strong sermon in the
Memorial Church yesterday morning.
"To explain the term 'anew' having it
mean 'from above' was the message of
these words. Conversion can not be
brought about by the use of strictly
theological terms. Boys may catch
butterflies better by the cocoon than
with the net; so it is in human experi
ence. Nothing good can come forth
unless there is warmth without anil
life within. These two points are all
that are necessary for an understand
ing of the term 'from above.' "
"The kingdom of God is a kingdom
of unfolding power. Even when the
individual is out of the habit of do
ing the will of God there comes a new
response. Man may go through this
world and be of another world—a nor
mal influence turns his steps.
"After all it rests almost entirely
with the will. A friend may be ill, his
strength sapped, but with his intellec
tual faculties alert, and the best of
care everything depends on the patient
—he must will to get well. The
forces around us do their best, but the
matter is always a question of the
will. Whosoever will may come.
Christ, said, 'I am come that ye may
have life more abundantly,' and lie
taught us to respond to our own lives."
The anthem, rendered by the choir
and a quartet, was "Consider and
Hear Me."
