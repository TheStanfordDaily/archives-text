# BRASS TAG TAKEN FOR GOLD PIECE AT TRACK SHOW
## 
### 
A shiny brass "Durham" tobacco
check unwittingly passed in by a stu
dent as a twenty-dollar gold piece for
admission to the Track Show caused
the box office much agitation until an
announcement before the house
brought the innocent perpetrator back
with the real twenty which upon in
vestigation of the inner regions of his
purse was found resting with the
nineteen and a half dollars change
from the tobacco check. Such was
the gratitude of the management that
they then offered back the fifty cents
admission price.
