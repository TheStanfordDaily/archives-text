# PLEA FOR HONOR SYSTEM BY CHANCELLOR KIRKLAND MAKES POWERFUL APPEAL
## 
### 
One of the most wholesome ad- j
dresses which has been heard at Stan
ford in a long time was the one given
before the assembled faculty and stu
dent body members this morning by
Chancellor J. H. Kirkland of Vander- j
Lilt University.
Chancellor Kirkland struck the key- !
note of bis lecture when he said, "I
believe in the honor system among
college students. My experience is
that it works, not universally well,
but better than any method under
which the faculty act as spies in the
examination room, and under which
students say that deceit is not a
crime. The honor system appeals to j
the better nature in men."
In beginning, the speaker stated, !
"There is one universal problem com
mon to every institution of learning.
In consideration of one common '
problem this morning we may find
something to occupy our attention to
our mutual benefit.
"College life is full of honors and
honor. By honors in college life we
mean diplomas, certificates, golden
keys, positions of leadership and re- I
sponsibility which have been dis- i
charged with credit. Back of the i
.honors lies the inner principle which
we designate as honor.
"A diploma stands for attainment
in the past and promise in the fu
ture. Without these qualities a diplo
ma is worth nothing more than its
market value."
Chancellor Kirkland continued to i
say that honor may be considered in
two senses, the first implying attain
ment, and the second the idea of re
paration for personal injury or insult.
After admitting the accusation that
student life is in a degree artificial,
and that student ideas of right and
wrong are arbitrary, the visitor de
clar ', "Hut the same holds true of
social life in general. The old cus
tom of loving friends and hating our
enemies remains with us.
"The struggle between honor and
dishonor takes place in every institu
tion. The rule holds good especially j
in matters of financial obligations. I
have known students who would pay
debts contracted from gambling, when
they wouldn't pay their board bills.
"Then there is the struggle in social
life and fraternity life. Organized so
ciety life is, 1 think, constantly striv
ing toward higher ideals.
"We have also to consider the field
of college athletics, that great field
where a struggle has been going on
for centuries between honor and dis

honor. Cooperation between students,
faculty and alumni is raising athletic
ideals.
"There is also the field of scholar
si ip, which calls for the same co
operation between the members of
college society. If there is one battle
I have engaged in all my life it is
for a right standard of scholarship.
Universities must call things by their
right names, and work for the highest
ends. It takes a faculty of strong
men to make a real university. And
that is not all. There must be a
working student body,â€”one which
will strive upward.
"The temptation which the student
faces when he goes to the examina
tion is a great one. That examination
will decide whether he shall graduate
or come back for another year. The
professor isn't looking. Shall he open
the book, or face the crisis and go
down to defeat like a man? If not
the latter, your diploma isn't worth
more than its market value.
"It isn't a very great crime to steal
five dollars. But suppose that instead
of stealing five dollars you make a
counterfeit and put it in circulation.
The punishment will bo great, and
will pass from the hands of the state
law to that of the United States. Why?
Because by counterfeiting one strikes
at the root of all values. So of the
ud >nt who counterfeits his diploma.
He is striking at the life of the uni
versity.
"The honor system is of great im
portance. The members are bound by
a compact. Control doesn't belong to
the faculty alone. It must be shared
with the students. I have been asso
ciated all my life with the honor sys
tem. That isn't a good term. One
can't have a prescription for making
honor. Honor is really a principle, a
question of social agreement that we
will be governed in greater problems
by the principles of daily honor.
The Chancellor spoke of the success
of the honor system at the University
of Virginia since its establishment in
1542, and of its prosperity at Van
derbilt; and made the declaration of
faith in the system which is quoted
in the second paragraph.
Manuals of student control were
distributed. Wednesday morning a
mass meeting of men students will
be held in the Assembly Hall during
the 9:15 period, for the purpose rf
discussing matters of common inter
est. Special consideration of Chan
cellor Kirkland's remarks will be in
order.
