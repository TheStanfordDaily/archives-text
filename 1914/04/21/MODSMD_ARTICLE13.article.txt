# THE 						BUSINESS BEFORE THE MEETING
## 
### 
Time will be short and business will be much at tomorrow's student
assemblies. This being the case, each one as he comes to the place of
meeting should have well in mind the nature of the problems to be dis
cussed, in order that the most vital matters may be approached without
delay.
The women have important questions awaiting consideration, the
character of which they themselves best understand. Each of the men,
it is to be hoped, will prepare to crystallize his ideas upon these definite
problems: Shall we adopt the Honor Principle in examinations? If
so, what shall be the nature of the "system"? In whom shall be vested
the power of disciplining offenders? Shall or shall not each student
be required to sign a pledge of honesty as a reminder of the existence
of the "system"? What shall be done about the Plug Ugly? Are there
any statements in the recently published Manual of Student Control
which require explanation or criticism ? Has Student Control as now
in operation any glaring faults? If so, how may these faults be over
come ? I
These queries serve to indicate in a broad way the many and critical
matters which demand attention tomorrow. They also indicate the
already self-evident fact that the attendance at this assembly of cvery
loyal citizen of our little Stanford democracy is imperative. The cir
circumstance of their large number would seem still further to indicate
that an assembly of this character at least once a semester would not
only keep the machinery of government running more smoothly and
rapidly, but would obviate the necessity of considering such a vast mass
of business in so short a time when a meeting is at last held.
