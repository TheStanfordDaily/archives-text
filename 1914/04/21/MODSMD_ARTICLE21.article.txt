# ONE-TENTH OF STANFORD MEN SELF-SUPPORTING
## 
### 
Stanford is not a rich man's univer
sity, as a few recent statistics from
the employment department of the
Y. M. C. A. will serve to prove. Over
one-tenth of the men students have
earned a part or all of their expenses
by work secured from this depart
ment. A conservative estimate places
the total sum earned by these 135
students this year at $8315.30, without
including money earned by temporary
employment. The fact that many of
our leading men in athletics, foren
sics, dramatics and scholarship are
men who have worked their way
through college shows that they lose
no prestige by so doing, as is often
the case at other universities. One
Senior will graduate this year who
started on his college course with a
capital of sixty-five cents, and many
others have begun with little more.
The character of the employment
has varied widely. Oue of the most
unusual and unique jobs which lias
offered itself to a Stanford man is
caring for the babies of women in
Palo Alto and on the campus while
the mothers went to the theater or
attended a party. One student gave
piano lessons in his room, while still
another played for the "movies" in
Palo Alto. Work as stenographers,
gardeners, "hashers," drivers, clerks,
chauffeurs, janitors, clothes pressers,
soda fountain dispensers, day labor
ers, telephone operators, bill collec
tors and solicitors lias enabled many
men to obtain an education without
the help of remittances from home.
As these statistics show, the Y. M.
C. A. is taking advantage of every op
portunity to help the students along,
and is succeeding admirably in the
effort.
