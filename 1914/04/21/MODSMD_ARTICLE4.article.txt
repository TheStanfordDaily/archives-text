# TRANS-ROCKY MEETS ARE NEXT GOAL OF TRACKMEN
## PERSONNEL OF EASTERN TEAM REMAINS UNCERTAIN Santa Clara and Pacific Coast Conference Events Dated for April 29 and May 2. 
### 
With the intercollegiate meet a mat
ter of history and only reminiscences
of the remarkable victory scored by
the Cardinal over the Golden Bear left,
the attention of the student body is
centered on the eastern invasion by
the Stanford track team the middle of
next month. A dual contest with the
University of Santa Clara is scheduled
for April 29 and the Conference meet
at Berkeley for May 2.
Speculation is rife as to the person
nel of the squad which is to be sent to
the middle western states. In all
probability eight or ten men will make
the trip, but the exact number will re
main a mystery until after the Con
ference meet.
The Conference competition is held
annually on the California field and lias
become more of an invitational affair
than an open meet. Eacli institution
on the Coast sends in a list of entries
and these lists are submitted to a com
mittee which passes upon the quali
fications of the contestants.
It is not known whether Coach
Campbell and Captain McKee will be
able to make the trip to the Missouri
Conference meet. Certain regulations
and rules are adhered to among e-.o
colleges of the middle west in this par
ticular meet which would make the
two Stanford athletes ineligible to
compete. Campbell may be ruled out
on the ground that he has competed
for a club track team. There is an
other ruling which specifies that ath
letes may compete under college col
ors for three years, but that the three
years must be in succession. This may
bar Captain McKee, as he first was a
member of a Stanford team as a
Freshman, then was forced to discon
tinue running during 1912 on account
of a strained tendon, and has com
peted during the past two years.
Freshmen arc not allowed to com
pete in several of the meets in which
the Stanford team has entered. This
will probably bar any of the 1917 men
from being included in the team which
will go east.
