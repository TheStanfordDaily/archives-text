# "CHARGE, BAYONETS!" THE TROOPS ADVANCE. DEAD SOLDIERS RESULT
## 
### 
The Twelfth Infantry, stationed in
the adjacent foothills, has already
done some active campaigning. Late
yesterday evening Lieutenant Rock
wood, ex-'l.'}, was dispatched with a
squad of soldiers fifty strong to sur
round and capture a party of dis
obedient men who were gathered in
the pine covered bill just back of the
Sigma Nu house, imbibing the joys of
a "keg party." Rockwood was com
missioned on the service bccause of
his knowledge of the country due to
his former stay here. The attacking 1
soldiers marched to the spot and sur- !
rounded their victims. With bayonet '
to the front and sharp yells, the troops '
closed in on the malefactors. The ex- ;
pected "keg party" was found to be a
group of men and women students
enjoying a quiet evening's entertain- j
ment around a fire, eating sandwiches
and consuming harmless soda water.
It is not known which party was the
most surprised.
Colonel Blatchford, in charge of the
command, gave out some interesting
information in regard to the probable
movements of his regiment in the fu
ture. As yet no orders have come
from the War Department to move to
the front. The entire camp, however,
is in momentary expectation of com
mands to break camp and proceed to
the border. If the Twelfth Infantry
is ordered into action, another regi
ment from the Presidio will take its
place.
