# EPOCH MAKING
## 
### 
The action of the students in assembly this morning may lead to a
result which when the last page of Stanford history is written will be
printed in larger type than even a series of track or football victories.
The splendid vote in favor of the honor principle, if it meets with the
response from the faculty which it deserves, may fairly be called epoch
making. The particular form of "honor system favored, moreover,
is one which strikes the very highest chord in a man's nature, and is
the kind which would in natural course find favor with high-spirited
students.
The next point to be won is the recognition of this "system by the
faculty in the various departments. For our part, we see no reason
why the plan should not be recognized. It is primarily character
building. It is workable. It is working now in the Law department, in
the Chemistry department, and in some Engineering courses. The ulti
mate success of any scheme will depend upon the building up of a power
ful sentiment in its favor. This will come through constant harping
upon the necessity for integrity in examinations, and by the constant
maintenance of the proper attitude by upper classmen in particular. To
start it off on the right foot, however, the plan must be more definite
than it now is in the minds of many. To this end The Daily Palo Alto
will welcome short and pointed communications expressing concrete
ideas on the subject.
