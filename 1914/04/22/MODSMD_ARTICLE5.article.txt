# HONOR SYSTEM ENDORSED AT ASSEMBLY OF WOMEN
## REPORTING OF DELINQUENTS IS MET WITH DISAPPROVAL Eight Constitutional Amendments Are Adopted by Conference After Spirited Discussion. 
### 
A "straw" ballot at the Women's
Assembly this morning following a
discussion of the proposed introduc
tion of the "honor system," showed
an overwhelming sentiment in favor
of the system. Many of the women
stated on their ballots that they dis
approved including as a part of the
honor system the obligation to report
fellow students for cheating. No defi
nite action was taken.
The women polled 187 straw bal
lots. Of this number, 101 were in
favor of the honor system uncondi
tionally, 3 were opposed, 38 were for
the system with the reporting system
in cases of cheating, and 45 favored
the honor system with no reporting.
The women gathered at the 9:15
hour in the Chapel, Miss E. Everett,
president of the Women's League, in
the chair. Members of the Women's
Conference led a spirited discussion
of several amendments to the consti
tution. following the ballot on the
honor system. The following were
the measures that were adopted:
Art. VII. sec. 4, shall be amended
to read: There shall he ten Senior or
Post Graduate women having a mini
mum of S4 hours, on the Conference,
elected by department representation.
Art. VII, sec. 5, shall be amended
to read: There shall be five upper
class women on the Conference elect
ed at large from the eligible list of
women who will have Junior standing
the following year.
Art. VII, sec. 7, shall be amended
to read: In case of a vacancy occur
ring in ihe department representation
such a vacancy shall be filled by a
special election in the department
where such vacancy occurs. For a
vacancy among the women elected at
large such a vacancy shall be filled
by a special election from the eligiblo
Junior list.
Art. VII. sec. S, shall be inserted:
Any woman elected to the Confer
ence during her Junior year shall ful
fil 11 the required minimum of 84 hours
in order to hold her seat as a Senior
member.
Art. VITI shall he amended to read:
The Conference shall hold office from
(he time of its election through two
academic years.
Art. TX, sec. 1, shall be amended to
read: Within a week after the Spring
election of the Conference the retir
ing President of Women's League
shall call the first meeting of the new
Conference.
Art. XTT, sec. 3, shall be inserted:

She (the Vice-president) shall be a
member of the Women's Student
Council.
Art. XVII. sec. 1. shall be amended
to read: One social meeting of the
League shall be held in the beginning
of each semester to welcome the in
coming women. Further meetings
I shall be called at the discretion of tlie
i Conference.
i The result of these changes will be
that elections to the Women's Confer
ence will be held late in the spring
! instead of the fall semester, that the
tenure of ofTice will be two years, and
that representation will be almost ex
clusively "departmental" and "at
large" rather than by classes. It is
hoped in this way to place the re
' sponsibility for student government
largely in the hands of Seniors and
post-graduates, leaving the Juniors to
be leaders in other college activities.
Because of the inadequate discussion
of the amendments, another meeting
will probably be called to put them
again before the women of the Uni
versity.
