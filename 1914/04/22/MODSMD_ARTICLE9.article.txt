# MEN STUDENTS VOTE FOR STRAIGHT HONOR SYSTEM
## THREE PLANS FOR NEW SYSTEM ARE PROPOSED Retention of Plug Ugly in Modified Form Is Favored by Large Majority. 
### 
Men students in assembly this
morning cast 317 votes in favor of a
"straight honor system" in examina
tions. If the proposed departure
from established practice is approved
by the faculty, students who take ad
vantage of opportunities to cheat will
be responsible only to themselves and
to the opinion of their classmates.
There will be no prescribed penalty
imposed.
Three forms of honor system were
proposed and discussed at the meet
ing. Eighteen voters favored a meth
od by which a student who found an
other cheating would have an option
of either reporting him to student
authorities, or speaking only to the
offender.
Nineteen students wished to secure
an honor system under which cheat
ing students must be reported for
punishment.
In accordance with the overwhelm
ing sentiment against reporting way
ward students, President A. G. Halm,
'11, of the Associated Students, will
submit the chosen form of honor sys
tem to the faculty for approval. Men
who spoke for the "no spies" honor
ystem this morning stated that it
would he the only real honor system.
Objections were made against a neces
?ity of keeping an absolute check on
the honesty of the students, and the
point was maintained that a private
reprimand of cheaters would serve
more fairly and effectively.
Since President Branner has not
been on the campus today it is impos
sible to state what the attitude of the
faculty toward the student proposal
will be. Statements from other mem
bers of the facility who are in close
touch with student affairs could not
be obtained this afternoon.
The action of the Stanford student
: body in departing from the more com
mon character of the honor system as
lit is employed at other universities
will probably be unexpected by the
faculty. Student oflieers are of the
opinion, however, that the rigid ap
peal to personal honesty made by the
: proposed method will meet approval.
Abolishment of the Plug-Ugly con
jlest, was endorsed on OS ballots, and
' its retention in some modified form
was favored by 22fi votes.
