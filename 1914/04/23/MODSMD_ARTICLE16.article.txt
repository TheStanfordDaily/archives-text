# COMMUNICATION

Editor Daily Palo Altoâ€”
When the student body was consid
ering the honor system during the as
sembly yesterday morning it seems
that two "systems" were in the minds
ol' speakers from the floor. In one
of them there was to be no informing
upon any student seen cheating. The
person who saw the cheating was to
go to the guilty party and inform him
that he was violating the rules of the
university and that he should not do
it. The other view was that anyone
who saw cheating was to report to a
committee and let that committee
take such action as it saw fit.
It is the purpose of this communi
cation to present a third system
which is a compromise of both of the
others, and which appears to be one
which would satisfy the demands of
those who desire a system which is
truly an "honor" system.
Each student is supposed to do all
he can to promote the success of the
system. He is to use his own judg
ment as to what he should do. If he
sees a man cheating he naturally
wants to do what he can to prevent
it. If he thinks that it would be best,
let him go to the person and speak
to him about it in the way he sees fit.
If he sees repeated cheating by that
person and is convinced that talking
will do no good he should know that
the cheater is not a desirable member
of our student body. Under those cir
cumstances the only thing for him to
do is to take the responsibility of re
porting to the proper authorities in
order to have that man dealt with.
The point is, each man is the judge
of his own actions. He is duty bound
to do what he can to promote the good
name of the university, and a man
who would not report a man he thinks
should be reported is no man at all.
But he is not bound to report every

case of cheating he sees and subject
a man to the humiliation of being
called before a committee unless he
honestly thinks the good name of the
university demands it.
It is believed by the writer that this
is the system we have in the Law de
partment. It is surely a true "honor
system." It does not make us "spies"
upon the actions of our fellow stu
dents. It puts upon us the duty of
reporting some men, but it gives us
the privilege of exercising our judg
ment. It does not necessitate any ad
dition to the governing body of the
students. P. D. NOWELL, '13.
