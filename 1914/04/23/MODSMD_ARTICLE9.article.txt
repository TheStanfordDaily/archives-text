# FOR A BIGGER "DAILY"
## 
### 
Believing that the greatest success in student body affairs goes hand in
hand with the fullest publicity to such matters, we take this opportunity to
indicate the significance of the resolution adopted by the Executive Com
mittee last evening, and printed today, relative to the business managership
of The Daily Palo Alto.
Except for a few lean weeks out of the year, the worry of the editorial
staff of this paper is not to find material with which to fill it, but to find
space wherein to put the matter at hand. Even during those rare periods
when news is scarce, a larger sheet could easily be filled by the exercise of
a reasonable amount of foresight and ingenuity. In other words, the paper
is now self-evidently and pitifully small.
The fondest dream of every man elected to the editorial chair of the
Daily has been that he might put out a larger sheet. Every editor has been
rudely awakened from this dream by the bright daylight of the business man
ager's financial report. Owing to the fact that Stanford is not favorably lo
cated for the securing of advertisements, the able business managers of the
paper have not been able, while attending to the innumerable duties of their
position and attempting at the same time to glean a few hours from the tree
of knowledge, to secure enough advertising to make possible a paper of a
fcize befitting the official representative of Stanford before the high schools
of the state and the colleges of the country. With this perfectly accurate
ambitious editors have had to be content.
This semester, However, certain iacts indicate that the diminu
tive size of the paper, far from being due to incompetent business niaua.su
ment or to the unkindness of Fate, was merely due to a poor managerial
system. Out of twenty-eight college exchanges coming to this office, it was
found that only one is smaller than the Daily. Of the twenty-seven which
are larger, eleven are published in institutions smaller than Stanford, and
five of these colleges are located as well in communities as small or smaller
than Palo Alto and farther away from a metropolis.
With these figures to indicate that schools less favorably situated than
ours are able to support much more pretentious papers, it was resolved to
hunt out. some system which would ultimately make possible a Daily Palo
Alto of more generous proportions. The scheme adopted by the Executive
Committee last evening is the result of this investigation. It is. with modifi
cations to fit local conditions, the one in use by the most successful college
dailies, such as the Daily Californian, and, notably, The Cornell Daily Sun,
perhaps the best college paper in the country. The editor of The Daily Palo
Alto is in receipt of letters from the editor of the Daily Sun outlining the
system used there and recommending it most highly.
In brief, the hoped-for results of this method will be three: First, to
secure for the Daily a large body of advertising brought in by the energetic
men who will try out for the position of assistant business manager, with
the probability that they will be chosen business manager if they win the
assistantship, and so to make possible the increase in size. Second, to give
the business manager an able assistant to take care of the many details
which now, for lack of time, must often go uncared for. Third, to secure the
probable election as business manager of the most experienced and capable
man.
The sole object of tlie resolution, which was adopted last evening by the
Executive Committee with the idea that it might become a constitutional
amendment after a year's trial, is, then, to make possible a larger and better
Daily Palo Alto. We would recommend that as soon as this system makes
it possible the paper be enlarged to five columns. With the attendant in
crease in length this would make room for an addition of half the present
amount of reading matter and half the present amount of advertising at an
increase of four-elevenths in cost of publication. Thus the increased expense
would be more than taken care of by the increased advertising, could the
advertising be secured; and it is the opinion of every authority consulted
that under the new system this additional advertising could easily be obtained.
