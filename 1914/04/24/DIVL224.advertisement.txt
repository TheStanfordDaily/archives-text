sold in the college towns —and you
agreed with us that they were good.
Then we put out for the big race,
to make Fatimas of nation-wide rep-
utation, and today more are sold than
No purer, or more carefully chosen
tobacco grows than that in Fatirnas. | v™
We purposely put them in a plain "irT* r7r~ C7D
inexpensive wrapper —in-this way j|vl Jfjl jf || II
we can afford quality tobacco, and ] ( III) 1 i f
twenty of the smokes for 1 5 cents. |l||| ■ I
Now your college crew is of utmost U= »U9 »
importance to you —so is a good
cigarette, and it's your aim in UrTm
to keep Fatimas in the lead —right Turkish blew
