# GRADUATES PLAN FOR A RECORD-BREAKING PROM
## FAIRYLAND OF DANCING LIGHTS TO TRANSFORM COURT Dainty Booths, Attractive Music, and Brilliant Chinese Lanterns to Distinguish Luxurious Scene. 
### 
Elaborate plans for a gay Senior
Prom, such as hitherto has never
been attempted at Stanford, are being
formulated under the leadership of
E. R. Hall, chairman of the commit
tee. Musical entertainment of an
unusual order, supplemented by ex
tensive decorations and refreshments,
will be provided for those who re
main on the campus to bid a last fare
well to tjie departing graduates.
The celebrated Hawaiian orchestra
of San Francisco has been engaged to
furnish the musical program. Attrac
tive booths —seven of them —will grace
the nooks and corners of Memorial
Court, and sorority girls and those
from Roble Hall will vie in dispens
ing salads, chicken patties, ice cream
and punch to the strollers. During
the intermissions the Hawaiians will
visit the booths, and add a tinge of
informal gayety to the affair with
sweet melodies on their quaint gui
tars and mandolins.
Chinese lanterns of variegated hue
will illumine the court. Four rows of j
brilliant glow will connect the four
corners of the square with the central
statue, and the arches fronting on the I
Inner Quad will be strung with a
"waving bank of lanterns of differentj
lengths. A huge class numeral is be
ing planned for the great North Arch,
and the idea will probably be carried j
into effect.
Lights of all descriptions will be
festooned from the palms and dra
caenas, and small touches of color
will glow from the ivy pedestals,
transforming them into veritable
Christmas trees.
A maze of potted plants and shrubs
will enclose the central monument,
around which the Hawaiian orchestra
will be stationed.
As may be seen, the committee is
sparing no effort to make lin unprece
dented success of the event, which
promises to be one of the most pop
ular attractions during Senior Week.
