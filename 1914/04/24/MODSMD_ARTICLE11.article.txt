# PALO ALTO MILITIAMEN CAN MOVE AT ANY TIME
## COMPANY L COULD ENTRAIN IN THREE HOURS Twenty-Eight Stanford Men Are Regularly Enrolled in Local National Guard Organization. 
### 
Company L, Fifth Regiment, Cali
fornia National Guard, has received
no other orders since the outbreak of
the present trouble in Mexico than
those it has been under for the past
year and a half, according to the
statement of Captain C. C. Anthony,
ex-'O9, of that company this after
noon.
Dr. O. L. Elliott, in the absence of
Dr. Branner from the campus this
forenoon, stated that, in his opinion,
men going to the front would be al
lowed their hours subject to the
decision of their individual instruc
tors and to their previous standing.
Should any orders be received, they
would undoubtedly be for the com
pany to go to Sacramento, its mili
tary base. There the organization
would be sworn in as a volunteer
company, tliose individuals not desir
ing to go having the option of drop
ping out at that time. At the same
place, the company would receive
such campaign equipment as it does
not now possess.
Company L could entrain with all
equipment three hours after orders
to move, is the opinion of Captain An
thony.
The Palo Alto organization has now
enrolled sixty-six men, four less than
the law allows a National Guard
Company. Until orders to recruit to
full war strength, which is about 114
or 118, only four more men can be
enlisted. However, a provisional list
of those who would go in case such
an order should be received is now
being formed. The Kappa Sigma
fraternity has promised eight men. If.
Burrows, '15, W. P. Wing, 'IG, and W.
G. Cooper, '14, have left their names
with the local organization, with the
promise that they will enlist if war
is declared. Many others have signi
fied their intention of going to the
front if volunteers are called for, but
have not given their names.
The following Stanford men are
regularly enlisted in Company L: F.
C. McCulloch, '17, First Sergeant;
Sergeants, C. F. Williams, '15, C. T.
