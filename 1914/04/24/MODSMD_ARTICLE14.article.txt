Lack of space but not lack of inclination has prevented us until
now from expressing' our hearty congratulations to track captain-elect
Bonnett. Already known as a peerless athlete, Bonnett should develop
under the responsibilities of his position into an exceptional leader of
men. He has the confidence of all of us.
