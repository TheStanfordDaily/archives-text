During the last week members of
the Stanford Women's Club made a
systematic canvass of the University
women to receive pledges for the club

Contrary to the original plan, work
on the club house was commenced
before all the money was collected.
The workmen have been able to shift
from the Stanford Union building to
the clubhouse, a most economical
method.
Thirteen hundred dollars have al
ready been paid for work done on the
building. Although the club women
still have about thirteen thousand on
hand they find that in order to com
plete the contract it will be necessary
to have two thousand dollars more
