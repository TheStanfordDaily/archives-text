# VARSITY DEFEATS KEIO IN LAST GAME OF SEASON
## SUPERIOR STICK WORK RESULTS IN 4 TO 1 SCORE. Japanese Ball Players Succumb to Splendid Pitching of Hayes and Halm. 
### 
The Cardinal nine closed its season
yesterday afternoon with a 4 to 1 vic
tory over the Keio team in a fast ex
hibition of the national pastime at the
Recreation Park grounds, San Fran
cisco. The airtight pitching of Halm
and Hayes, who let down the visitors
with 'our scattered hits, combined
with the slugging abilities of the Var
sity, were in main part responsible
for the defeat of the Japanese team.
Stanford was first to score in the
opening inning when two runs were
brought, across the pan. Captain
Terry walked and was sacrificed to
second by Stafford. Tshikawa, the
Japanese pitcher, in his attempt to
throw Stafford out at first, hit the
runner with the ball, allowing Terry
to come home and Stafford to reach
third. A moment later after Work
man flew out to center, Dent brought
Stafford in with the second run on a
single to left.
The Keio nine scored their lone run
in the third frame. Mori walked and
reached third on a wild throw of
Hirai's bunt to first. After Tshikawa
had popped out to Terry for the first
out, the squeeze play was attempted.
Mori, although cleverly trapped be
tween third base and the home plate,
Mas allowed to score when Dent
dropped McCloskey's peg.
The final scoring was done in the
fifth inning when the Varsity bats
men drove Tshikawa from the mound.
Terry and Stafford opened up with
singles to left and right. Workman
followed with a long double to cen
j ter that, brought Terry home. Dent's
I liner over third base scored Stafford
with the last, run of the game. At
this point Tshikawa was relieved by
| Sugasi, and the star twirler of the
visitors held the Varsity safe during
the remainder of the contest.
