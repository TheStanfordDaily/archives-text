# TRANSFERS FILL MAJORITY OF SENIOR PLAY PARTS
## Six Roles Taken by Stars Who Received Their Dramatic Training Elsewhere. 
### 
The Senior play committee lias
chosen a cast for "Our Wives" which
is for the most part new to the Stan
ford stage, but is experienced in col
lege dramatics. Six of the nine parts
in the comedy will he carried by
transfer students.
11. L. Loud, '13, has taken part in
numerous productions in Southern
California. The evident acting ability
of E. L. House, '14, commended itself
to the coaches at the first tryouts. He
has the role of an artist with plenty
of pictures to sell, but no one to buy
them.
In the women's lead, Miss Margaret
Linnane, '14, will have to cope with a
character of sympathetic and humor
ous nature. The vigorous character
of a self-assertive Irish model will be
interpreted by Miss Rose Neth, '14.
A "cry-baby" wife will be the part
essayed by Miss Louisette Aubert,
'16. Attractive presence and former
dramatic work at the University of
the Pacific recommend her success.
As the type of wife who never tires
of inflicting the virtues of her rela
tives on her husband, Miss Edna
Stearns, '11, is proving to be talented
and adaptable.
