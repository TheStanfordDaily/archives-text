# $75,000 INCREASE MADE IN PRESIDENT'S BUDGET FOR THE ENSUING YEAR
## New Library and Museum Promised--- H.R. Stolz Is Appointed Gymnasium Director 
### 
The announcements of the Board of
Trustees a year ago and more recent
ly, foreshadowing increased funds for
academic purposes and new buildings
on the campus, have been substan
tiated by information given out by the
president's office concerning board
action last Friday. An increase in
the president's budget for next year,
an appropriation for a new museum,
and the appointment of H. R. Stolz,
'09, as director of Encina Gymnasium
and medical adviser to men, are
among the most important provisions.
The president's budget for next
gregating in the neighborhood of $75,-
year has been increased by sums ag
-000. Of this amount, $33,000 has been
added to the salaries of the present
teaching staff, and $30,000 to the de
partmental equipment allotment, $10,-
000 of which is to take the place of
funds that were available to the presi
dent this year from various sources,
chiefly on savings on sabbatical leaves,
for which there is no corresponding
saving for next year in sight. In ad
dition the appropriation and obliga
tions of the church, aggregating $10,-
000, are added to the budget. This
makes a total of about $75,000 added
to the salaries and equipment budget
for next year, over and above the
amount granted for these purposes
during the present year.
It is announced also that the east
ern half of the front of the proposed
new quadrangle will be occupied by a
new museum building. This building,
however, will not be commenced for
:at least two or three years. The new
library building, which will form the
western half of the new quadrangle,
across the road from the history
building, will be erected first. The
wings of the present museum build
ing, which were wrecked by the
earthquake, and have been unoccupied
sincc, will be demolished at once,
leaving the original central portion of
the museum and the portions at the
rear which have been repaired and
are used as laboratories.
The fifty thousand dollars which
Trustee Thomas Welton Stanford has
| dvon to the University to be used in
museum restoration, will be used in
equipping special galleris in the new
museum building for the collections
of valuable paintings which he has
given to the University at various
times. Placing the museum in the
new quadrangle meets President
Branner's suggestion in his inaugural
address that the art collections of the
University ought to be made more
available for the students than they
are in the present building.
The $33,370 added to the salaries of
the faculty is distributed among the
various grades as follows: professors,
$11,950; associate professors, $6,350;
assistant professors, $10,700; instruc
tors, $4,370.

Assistant Professor E. P. Lesley.
'96, who has been on leave this year,
lias been promoted to be associate
professor of Mechanical Engineering.
Professor Lesley has been studying
scientific management in big estab
lishments in the East in connection
with the course ho will give in Shop
Administration. Instructors R. E.
Pellissier and W. H. Sloan have been
promoted to be assistant professors of
French and Chemistry respectively.
H. R. Stolz, '09, is to be the new
director of Encina Gymnasium and
medical adviser to men. Stolz was a
Rhodes scholar, and is now complet
ing his medical education in the Stan
ford medical department, from which
he will receive his M. D. this com
mencement. He was a track man at
Stanford and was a varsity track man
and rugby player at Oxford. He
played on the Olympic team this year.
In performing the duties of medical
adviser to men, Stolz will undertake
functions which have not hitherto
been discharged by the gymnasium
The Department of Graphic Arts on
August 1 will become a division of the
Department of Education, the present
faculty of the art department retain
ing their present academic ranks.
This action is taken in view of the
fact that the major part of the art
department, work is in training teach
ers of drawing.
The board has authorized the re
moval of the gravel in the inner quad
rangle and the paving of the court
with cement. The details of this work
may be revised upon the suggestions
of the landscape architects now at
work on plans for the beautification
and planting of all the grounds around
the quadrangles, but at any rate, the
inner court will be made easily tra
versible in any direction.
The petition of the Senior class to
be given authority to plant a tree in
the neighborhood of the church dur
ing Commencement Week has been
granted, the exact location and the
variety of tree to be determined in
consultation with the president of the
University and the president of the
Hoard of Trustees.
