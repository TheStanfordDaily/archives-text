# BIG JOBS FOR BIG MEN
## 
### 
Offices involving a responsibility not realized by those unfamiliar
with student body affairs are to be filled tomorrow. Each successful
candidate will receive, not a college honor, but a man's job. The Presi
dent of the Associated Students, the Graduate Manager, and the Ex
ecutive Committeemen will formulate Stanford's policy in intercol
legiate relations for a year, and will direct the expenditure of thousands
of dollars of money. The Business Manager and Editor of The Daily
Palo Alto are to till especially exacting positions requiring energy,
ceaseless work, and a certain amount of executive and business exper
ience or ability. In view of these facts, we urge, first, that every quali
fied voter cast his ballot tomorrow; and, second, that in casting his
ballot his thought may be. not to do a good turn for a friend or to pre
sent any man with a laurel wreath, but after careful consideration to
vote for those men who, he believes, would most faithfully discharge
the trust reposed in them of caring for Stanford's policies and insti
tutions.
