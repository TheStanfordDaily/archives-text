# Humorists Choose Hagen Chappie Head, Oliver Art Editor
## 
### 
M. A. Hagen, '15, was elected editor
of The Chaparral for the ensuing year
of 1914-15 at the last meeting of Ham
mer and Collin Society held in San
Francisco recently. M. A. Oliver, '15,
was chosen art editor, R. E. Anderson,
'13, has been re-elected business man
ager, with H. R. Harvey, '16, as his
assistant.
Hagen is one of the cleverest con
tributors to the Stanford comic, hav
ing exhibited equal facility in writing
either prose or verse. With Hagen
as the editorial wielder of "Chappie's"
hammer, the next volume of the Chap
arral promises to reflect the high
standard set by his predecessor.
Hagen was co-author of the 1915
junior opera, "The College Prince,"
and is a member of Encina Club. He
registers in the department of Eng
lish from Los Angeles.
M. A. Oliver, '15, the newly elected
art editor, has held a similar position
on the 1915 "Quad." He majors in
Graphic Art, and comes from Mon
terey. He is also a member of En
cina Club.
Editor L. D. Summerfield will close
his 1913-14 volume of the Chaparral
with the Commencement number.
