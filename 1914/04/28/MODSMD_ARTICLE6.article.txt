# New Postoffice Plans Ready For Contractors' Bids
## 
### 
Designs have been drawn, and the
architects have called for contractors'
bids for the construction of a new
Stanford postofflce, which will be set
back a short distance from the pres
ent site, and further removed from
the Women's Clubhouse.
The new postoffice is considered
necessary because of demand for more
modern equipment and for a wider
passageway between it and the club
building. The brick construction of
the standing structure makes move
ment impracticable.
Either brick or concrete will be
used in the new building. The ex
pense is not to exceed $20,000, ac
cording to information from President
Timothy Hopkins of the Board of
Trustees received this afternoon. The
drawings call for a one-story edifice
with doors at both ends.
In the youth of the University, the
campus public got its mail in a frame
building which stood on the ground
now occupied by the Memorial Church.
Miss Bushnell, the postmistress, was
credited with knowing everyone at
Stanford, and gave quick service at
the delivery window.
