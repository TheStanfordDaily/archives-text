# PALO ALTO LEASES LAND FROM STANFORD ESTATE
## 
### 
The city council of Palo Alto last
evening authorized a fifty-year lease
of twenty-five acres of land belonging
to the University, which extends
along the Southern Pacific track from
the Palo Alto tree to the O'Brien
place.
A rate of $1500 per year is the ap
proximate rental. A proposition has
been under way for some time to es
tablish a city playground on the tract,
and that plan will likely be carried
out.
There is little doubt that the city
will also cut a road through to the
depot from the estate, in order to re
lieve the congestion on University
avenue.
