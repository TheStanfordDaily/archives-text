# GAY CARNIVAL TO USHER IN GALA SENIOR WEEK
## FRATERNITIES AND CLUBS ASK FOR CONCESSIONS Original Sideshows, Nickel Crawls, Entertainments and Refreshment Booths to Line Row. 
### 
Senior Week will be ushered into
the calendar of 1914 events by a
carnival of unusual proportions. A
number of clubs and fraternities have
already applied for concession sites,
and are planning a series of original
sideshows and entertainments. In
order that preparations may be start
ed at once, C. W. Knight, '14, chair
man of the Carnival Committee, has
requested that all organizations which
desire to be represented on the pro
gram hand their names to him before
the end of the week.
The committee has decided to re
strict the limits of the carnival to the
west side of Lasuen Street, between
the Delta Kappa Epsilon and Delta
Gamma houses. This step has been
taken with the idea of making a com
pact carnival which will keep the
crowds around a central spot, thus
adding a greater spirit of enthusiasm
and excitement to the celebration.
Three nickel crawls will be held
in as many houses, and will probably
furnish the greatest attraction for the
throng of pleasure seekers. Numer
ous tents and refreshment booths will ,
line the lawns between the various i
fraternity houses, which will shelter
snappy vaudeville shows and musical
programs.
Lighting effects such as hitherto
have never been attempted, will serve
as a brilliant setting for the conces
sions. Long lines of electric bulbs
will connect the numerous booths, and
will reflect a shower of light upon
the "gay white way."
The enclosure will be crowded to
the boards with attractions, and so
cieties are again urged to report im
mediately to the committee in charge. |
Agitation for a Senior Week which
will interest undergraduates and
alumni as well as the Seniors seems j
to be finding realization in the plans
for this year's final jubilee on the
campus, and all those who remain will
undoubtedly be recompensed fully for
staying. A running fire of novel
entertainments, games, dances, and
picnics is scheduled on the already
crowded program, and "roughs" as
well as those who court the society
of the gentler sex will find plenty to
occupy their attention during the
closing week of festivities.
