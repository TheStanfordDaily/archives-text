The Daily Palo Alto wishes to address a word to the many who
have expressed themselves as impatient to see particular items of news
or communicated articles appear in these columns. This word is a re
quest to glance at the size of the paper and then to consider three fac
tors : First, that in order to support the Daily and insure a moderate
return to the business manager considerable space must necessarily be
given over to advertising. Second, that the iron "forms" which bound
our four small pages cannot be stretched by any human power. Third,
that you can't squeeze type. It is thus evident that our space available
for reading matter has rigid physical limitations. It becomes necessary
then for the editorial staff day by day to select from the many news
items available those which in their judgment will be of interest to the
greatest number of readers; and in this process of picking and choos
ing many stories of interest to smaller groups must either go entirely
bv the board or be considerably delayed in publication. No Daily man
will be so bigoted as to claim infallibility in this matter of selecting the
most important items; but the fact remains that this choice, however
faulty, is made honestly and advisedly.
We have gone into this subject both as a word of explanation to
those who feel naturally disappointed in not seeing matter of particular
interest to them published in the Daily, and also to make evident one of
the causes which have prompted the fight for a larger Daily Palo Alto.
We believe that with proper public sentiment and cooperation aroused,
and with a managerial competition to begin at once finally assured, this
needed reform will be a thing of the near future.
