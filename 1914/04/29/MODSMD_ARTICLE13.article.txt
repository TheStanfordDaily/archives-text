# CLUB TO AID WOMEN IN CHOICE OF A LIFE WORK
## 
### 
The Vocational Opportunities Club
is working to obtain certain informa
tion in regard to profitable and avail
able vocations for women. With this
purpose in view, a set of questions
will be mailed to every woman in the
University, which each student will be
requested to answer and return
promptly to the club. In this way, an
effort will be made to guide women
into other lines than teaching and it
is hoped that they will be aided ma
terially in their choice of a life work.
The club is working in conjunction
with the Social Service committee of
the Y. M. C. A.and also with Miss
Susan M. Bristol, appointment secre
tary of the University, who keeps a
complete list of applicants and posi
tions.
