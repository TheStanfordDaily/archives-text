coaching committee to represent Stan
ford on the Eastern trip. Murray and
Hahn will meet the racket wielders
of nine leading universities during the
trip, Wisconsin having been added to

Murray is recognized as the best
player in the University, and cap
tained the tennis team in 1912. He
has twice won the singles title, and
was prevented from representing the
Cardinal against California in the in
tercollegiate tournament this spring
owing to the fact that he had already
played four times. During the past
week Murray won the coast intercol
legiate single championship at Nord
hoff, by defeating Willis Davis and
Emery Rogers, both of California, in
the semi-final and final rounds. The
Cardinal player was placed among
the first five tennis players on the

mittee.

made the choice of these two players,
