Editor The Daily Palo Alto —
After my various talks against war
and against the War System of "light
ing the devil with fire" (twenty-seven
in England, nine in Scotland, five in
Germany, two in France and one in
Belgium), I naturally went down to
the south of France, with Mrs. Jordan
and Eric, for a month of rest and to
keep out of the cold. This time was
spent at Beaulien-sur-mer, Hyeres-le-
Palmiers and Cannes. The cold came
after us, even down there, for this
has been the snowiest winter in
Europe for fifty years. So I took the
North German Lloyd steamer Kleist
to Ceylon, where I spent a week col
lecting fishes and other sea-things
with our Professor Fisher.
At Colombo I took the next German
steamer, equally excellent, the Fried
rich der Grosse. In the bazar at Co
lombo I secured a monkey for the
company, and the laws of "White Aus
tralia" forbidding the entrance of one
of his race, I had some trouble in get
ting rid of him. At last, however, he
was landed in the Sydney Zoo, where
he is much appreciated.
In Melbourne, I had a most delight
ful two weeks with one of the Uni
versity's best friends, and my recep
tion has convinced me that my time
was well spent. I gave seven lec
tures in Melbourne, three in Sydney,
and one in Adelaide. This tended to
break up the hot weather of a most
hot and dry march, and I left the
scenery of Australia in the enjoyment
of the most profound pence.
It takes five weeks of the warm and
washy Indian Ocean, with a dash of
the hot Red Sea and the gusty and
tempestuous wind off Greece—which
St. Paul says is called Euroclydon—
before reaching Genoa.
After that, I hope, Greece, Bulgaria,
Servia, Rumania and Ulster, sailing
on the Minneapolis August 8 and
touching Palo Alto —let us say August
25.
The year has been a bit strenuous,
but I have met many people and
learned a few things from them.
"Wenn .lemand einc Reisi thut, so
kann er was erziihlen."
Sincerely yours.
