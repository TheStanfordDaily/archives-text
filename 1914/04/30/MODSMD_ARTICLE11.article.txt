Go after the main chance and go after it hard! Phis is a homely
phrasing of a very important rule for achieving success. 'I his year
Stanford is attempting to follow this maxim in sending its track team
Hast. We have one of the best teams in our athletic annals. In its
ranks are at least ten men who might justly feel confident of winning
places in their various events in the Missouri \ alley and Intercollegiate
meets. The difference between sending eight men without a trainer
and sending ten men with a trainer —the difference entering upon a
project in a just-good-enough way and going after the main chance
hard —might also spell the difference between defeat and victory.
.• Energetic efforts of a few interested workers have assured the
sending of the eight men. It is now definitely up to the student body
to make it possible for ten men and a trainer to journey to the meets.
It is assumed that during tomorrow's game of "tag" every man con
fronted by the persuasive though often wordless arguments of the tag
sellers will buy at least one simply because he can't help himself. This
is to suggest that he then buy another—and another!—to help Stan
ford win the Conference meets.
