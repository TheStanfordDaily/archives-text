# Stanford Loses Close Game
## 
### 
Stanford lost tlie final baseball
game of the season to Santa Clara
yesterday afternoon by the close score
of 2-1. The contest was a pitchers'
battle, with Stanford playing errorless
ball. Hayes was in the box for the
Cardinal team, and Lenard twirled for
the Catholics.
