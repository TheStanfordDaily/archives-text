I am strongly opposed to any sys
tem of "spying," but in what respect
is the reporting of students who cheat
"spying"? Every one of us is aware
of the fact that our national govern
ment lias laws for the punishment of
theft. When one goes downtown, is
lie on the constant watch for rob
bery? Does he regard all whom he
meets with suspicion? Of course not;
lie trusts his neighbors and believes
that they are honest. But if he se<-s
a person break into a store he nat
urally reports the case to the proper
authorities. Why? Because theft is
a crime against society, not merely
because the individual has a low code
of morals. The person who reports
the case feels no stigma of "tattling"
or "spying"; he feels justified because
he is protecting the best interests of
society.
Let us look upon the honor prin
ciple in this light. Trust our fellows
and believe that they arc honest. Go
to our examinations without the
thought that we are a set of policc to
watch one another. Let each one of
us make it his business to see that he
himself is going to do the square
thing with the hope and belief that
everyone else is doing the same. But
if a person is seen cheating, report
the case to the proper authorities.
Why? Because cheating is a crime
against our Stanford society. The
person who cheats his or her way to
a diploma cheapens the diploma of
every other Stanford student and sul
lies Stanford's fair name. Up to this
point the responsibility remains an in
dividual matter: let each student de
cide for himself whether or not he
will cheat without feeling that he is
once committed, the matter becomes
one not of individual but collective
under surveillance. But the offense
responsibility. The offense is made
not against the individual alone, but
against us all collectively.
Viewed in this spirit, the person
who reports the case does not feel
the stigma of "tattling" or "spying,"
but feels that he is doing the square
thing, because he is protecting our
Stanford society.
