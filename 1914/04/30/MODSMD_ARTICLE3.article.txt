# MONEY WILL BE RAISED BY TAG DAY TOMORROW TO SEND TRACK TEAM EAST
## 
### 
Tomorrow will bo "Tag Day" for
the purpose of sending the victorious
track team East this spring. The
scheme was inaugurated last evening
by the Executive Committee, and since
that time the committee in charge has
been perfecting the details in order
lo insure sufficient funds to finance
the trip.
It is estimated that the cost will
approximate $2000 for a team of ten
men and the graduate manager. Eight
men at the present time are certain of
competing with the colleges of the
Middle West, and it will depend large
ly on the funds which are provided by
the Student Body tomorrow whether
or not the two men will be added to
the personnel of the team.
Every man and woman in the Uni
versity including students, faculty
and visitors will be asked to help out.
A tag will cost twenty-five cents.
Miss Jean Garver, '14, will have
charge of the committee of women,
who will be in every nook and corner
of the University selling the little
pasteboards. She will be assisted by
a bevy of underclass girls.
The Stanford track team will leave
the campus on May 24. At the pres
ent time eight men are slated to make
the trip, with the possibility of at
least one and maybe two more being
added to the squad. Those who have
been selected to date are: Captain P.
B. McKee, '14, E. P. Campbell, 13,
Captain-elect E. M. Bonnett, *15, G.
W. Bedeau, '15, F. S. Murray, 'IG, D.
Chace, '16, P. It. Wilson, '16, and R.
Krohn, 'IG. All of these men won
first places in the Stanford-California
intercollegiate meet with excellent
records to their credit. It is expected

I from the results of previous meets in
the Middle West that each man will
j be a point winner in the two meets
in which Stanford will compete.
The men will go direct to St. Louis,
noL stopping off at Salt Lake City and
Boulder, Colorado, as was previously
planned. They will arrive at the Mis
souri capital on the night of May -7.
The Stanford team will compete in
the Missouri Valley Conference meet.
Trial heats will be run off on May 29
and the finals on the next day.
From St. Louis the team will go to
Chicago about the first of June and
make their headquarters at a hotel
near the track oval of the University
of Chicago. Here they will round in
shape for the Intercollegiate Confer
ence meet, commonly known as the
| Western Conference meet, which will
|be held on June 6. This meet is con
trolled by nine colleges of the Middle
West, but draws from the whole coun
try between the Appalachian moun
tains on the East to the Pacific Coast
on the West. Stanford will have an
opportunity to whip the Golden Bear
again at the Intercollegiate meet, as
the University of California is plan
ning on sending a team of fourteen or
fifteen men.
In 1910, under the leadership of Le
land Stanford Scott, '10, Stanford tied
with Notre Dame for first place in
the Intercollegiate Conference meet
held at Champaign, Illinois, and at
i that time made a new record for the
four-man mile relay, which has never
been equalled.
The committee in charge of raising
the funds for the trips reports that
$750 has been provided and that $1250
j more is needed to pay for the trip.
