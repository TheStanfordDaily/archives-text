# 1915 CARDINAL NINE WILL PRESENT STRONG LINE-UP
## CAPTAIN WORKMAN WITH EIGHT VETERANS ON DECK ”Ave” Howe, ’15, Former Varsity Hurler Announces Intention of Returning to College. 
### 
With a nucleus of nine seasoned
veterans and three substitutes to form
the baseball season for the coming
season, as strong a nine as has ever
represented the Cardinal is practical
ly assured.
The greatest loss to the team will
be the absence of this year's premier
leader, Z. A. Terry, '14, who for four
seasons has held down the position
of shortstop on the Varsity. His clev
er fielding and timely hitting have al
ways been a source of great strength
to the nine. Two other valuable play
ers will also be lost through gradua
tion, namely A. CJ. Halm, '14, pitcher
and left fielder, and C. W. Dooling,
'13, left fielder. All of the other men
have announced their definite inten
tion of returning to college next fail.
Next year's battery will be a capa
ble and veteran one, with Dent on the
receiving end, and Maple and Hayes
to perform in the box. Dent has
caught a steady and consistent game
for two seasons, while Hayes twirled
in splendid form in the third contest
with California. Since Maple is an
exceedingly versatile performer on
the diamond, and a good hitter, he
may be used either in the shortstop
position or the outfield, instead of the
pitcher's box. Avery Howe, '15, who
twirled two creditable games in the
1911 intercollegiate series, has also
signified his intention of returning to
college next year, so that no fears
may be entertained as to the strength
of the Varsity in the battery depart
ment.
Three of the four remaining infield
positions will be filled by this year's
veterans. Tom Workman, who will
captain the 1915 nine, may be depend
ed upon to hold down the first sack
in his usual big league style. No
more capable leader could have been
secured than this versatile ball play
er. McCloskey and Stafford will lend
their invaluable support to the team
by covering third and second base re
spectively. Another possibility for
the berth of shortstop is Stevens, who
acted as substitute infielder on this
year's Varsity.
With two of this season's players in
line for the outfield, Day in center
and Noonan in right, that department
of the team looms up strong. Much
improvement may be expected in their
work next year. The other outfield
position, left field, is open through
the graduation of Halm and Dooling.
The return of such players as
O'Neil, Stevens and Landers, substi
tutes on this year's Varsity, affords
strong material for the position that
will be open.
The selection of a coach for next
year's baseball team is as yet unde
cided.
