It is expected that the last regular issue of The Daily Palo Alto
will appear 011 Tuesday, May 5. This will give the members of the
staff one day of grace before the beginning of the end. The Com
mencement Edition of the paper, consisting of twelve pages with 110
advertising, will be out Monday, May 18. This issue will be profusely
illustrated and will contain an unusual variety of interesting special
articles. It will sell for ten cents. Orders should be sent to this office
in advance.

The above announcement, prophetic harbinger that it is of the
completion of another volume of the Daily, brings to mind a duty which
we have hitherto neglected to perform. Ever since this publication
was born, away back in the grey dawn of Stanford history, there has
been one subject the very thought of which has prompted editors to un
cork the vials of their righteous wrath. So well established has become
the habit of pouring out editorial invective, irony, argument and plead
ing at least oncc a semester on this poor defenceless topic, that the cus
tom richly merits a place as the one hundred and forty-first Stanford
tradition in the last of the Red Row 011 the Shelf. Not knowing why
we do it, therefore, but with blind faith in the wisdom of our predeces
sors assuring us that there must be method in our madness, we hasten
to discharge this trust: In compliance with the duty imposed upon it,
The Daily Palo Alto gives solemn warning to all who may have occa
sion to sprinkle Searsville's Best upon lawn or garden: Don't get tlic
sidewalks wet!
