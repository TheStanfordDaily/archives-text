# FLONZALEY QUARTET WILL PLAY IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## 
### 
Under the auspices of the Penin
sula Musical Association, the Flon
zaley quartet, consisting of two vio
lins, a viola and violoncello, will give
a concert in the Assembly Hall to
morrow evening.
This attraction comes with the high
est recommendation, as the personnel
of the organization is remarkable.
The musicians devote all their time
to chamber-music, eliminating all in
dividual engagements, and this single
ness of purpose is responsible to a
great extent for their unequalled suc
cess in quartet work. Their concerts
are unique in that no solos are ren
dered, and all orchestral accompani
ment is excluded.
