# NEW PLUG UGLY PLANS ADOPTED BY CONFERENCE
## CHOOSE COUNCIL TO ACT UNTIL REORGANIZATION Comparative Scholarship Reports of Various Organizations Will Be Published in Daily. 
### 
The adoption of a resolution to
publish the scholarship reports of the
organizations on the campus, the se
lection of a Council and president to
serve until the reorganization of the
Conference next semester, and the
adoption of a new plan for conduct
ing the Plug Ugly, was the chief work
transacted by the University Confer
ence last evening.
O. H. Castle, '14, is the president
chosen, and he with F. L. Foster, '13,
F. B. Watkins, '14, and E. 13. Mall, '14,
will be the other members of the
Council. E. C. Behrens, '14, will con
tinue as a Council member.
The scholarship reports will be
made up in the Registrar's office dur
ing the summer and will be published
in The Daily Palo Alto at the begin
ning of the fall semester. Separate
groups of records will be drawn up
so that comparison can be made be
tween standings of the different fra
ternities and clubs, the honor so
cieties, the athletic teams, and the or
ganizations representing other cam
pus activities.
The new Plug Ugly is the sugges
tion of A. M. Standish, '14. The Plug
Ugly show will be discontinued, but
the rush and the distribution cf
posters will be retained, although in
a modified form. The rush will be
held on the football turf under the
supervision of a committee appointed
by the Conference. The poster will
be prepared by a committee from the
Junior class, but will be given over
to a Conference committee, which will
distribute them to the members of
the class just before the rush. At the
signal the third year men will attempt
to go through the Senior line on the
opposite side of the field and distrib
ute their dodgers to the spectators in
the bleachers. The details of the plan
are yet to be worked out. The Jun
iors will probably be allowed to carry
their "plugs" in the rush.
F. L. Foster, '13, was appointed a
student member of the board of direc
tors of the Bookstore.
