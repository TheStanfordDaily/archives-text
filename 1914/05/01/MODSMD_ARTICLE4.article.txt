# “TAG DAY” SPIRIT RUNS HIGH ON STANFORD FARM
## 
### 
The men of the University gener
ously fell in line with + he "Tag Day"
spirit this morning, and willingly
succumbed to the pleading persua
sions of a group of charming solici
tors stationed at advantageous points
near the library and the polls. A
sum of $132.98 has been turned in to
Miss Jean Garver, and will help con
siderably in defraying the Stanford
track team's expenses in the East.
