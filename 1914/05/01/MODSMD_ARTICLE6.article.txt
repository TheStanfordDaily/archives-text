## 
### 
H. Appleton, '15, son of L. E. Apple
ton, a retired capitalist of San Jose,
was struck by an automobile about
ten o'clock last evening, on the road
between Palo Alto and the campus,
sustaining injuries which may prove
fatal.
The accident was unavoidable as
Appleton, who was walking toward
the campus with J. P. Dunnagan,
'14, became blinded and confused by
the glare from the lights of a ma
chine going to Palo Alto, and jumped
in front of the campus-bound ma
chine, which was driven by M. P. De
tels, '14, who was traveling at a mod
erate rate of speed. The injured man
was immediately carried by Detels to
the Peninsula Hospital, where he is
suffering from a fractured skull and
internal injuries. Although some
what improved, his condition is ex
tremely critical.
Appleton is a member of Encina
Club, and is registered in the Chem
istry department.
