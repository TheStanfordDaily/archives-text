# NEW YEARBOOK ATTAINS HIGH ORDER OF MERIT
## 1915 QUAD ENJOYS BRISK SALE AT THE LAW STEPS All Phases of Undergraduate Activity Well Chronicled.â€”Volume Contains Attractive Pages. 
### 
Complete in its chronicle ol' the col
lege year in every phase of Stanford
activity, and brightened with scores
of photographs and drawings, the
1915 Quad has joined the red row of
volumes on the shelf.
The brisk sale of the book at the
Law Steps this morning was justified,
and purchasers received good value
for their two dollars and a half. The
current issue of the yearbook stands
well in the first rank of Quads, and
may even be considered the best work
which has yet been achieved by an
undergraduate staff. Both as a his
tory and as an artistic triumph in
printing, arrangement, and illustra
tion, the 1915 annual can claim praise.
The first glance at the panel-draw
ing on the cover gives promise of a
good book. All the departments con
tained in 496 pages make good that
promise.
Credit is due the editorial staff for
a number of successful new depart
ures from former Quad schemes. The
cream-cameo tone paper, and brown
ink are a tribute to both the staff and
to the printers. The prevailing color
scheme throws photographs in much
more effective relief than can be ob
tained with black and white. By the
use of heavy red-paper lining on the
inside of the front and back covers,
and fly-leaves, a valuable effect is ob
tained.
The group of Stanford traditions
meets a need which has been long
neglected, and answers common daily
questions about the Farm which have
been a troublesome puzzle.
The physical appearance of the
book may be classed apart from any
past attempt.
Art work throughout reaches a
high standard which is not destroyed
by a very few mediocre drawings
which appear on one or two pages.
The drawings made by M. A. Oliver,
the art editor, are excellent. He suc
ceeded also in maintaining a uniform
style in the work of most all the con
tributors.
All the departments are handled
completely and accurately. Slight
omissions or errors in such a mass
of varied material as that in the Quau
are almost inevitable. The present
issue will bear close inspection by
members of organizations and others
who turn to see their names in print.
