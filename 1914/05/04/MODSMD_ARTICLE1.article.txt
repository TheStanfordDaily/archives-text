# FOURTEEN VARSITY MEN AMONG RUGBY ELIGIBLES
## RETURN OF VETERANS PROMISES POWERFUL 1914 TEAM Varsity Substitutes and Other Seasoned Players Offer Rich Choice; Wylie Is Bright Star. 
### 
Fourteen members of the Cardinal
Rugby team which defeated California
in the 1913 turf battle will report to
Coach Floyd Brown, '11, for practice
next September.
Veteran claimants for positions in
the 1914 scrum who contributed to
the victory last November will be
Watkins, Wines, Clover, Gard, Hall,
and Blase. The only men missing
from the forward division will be
"Stogie" Peck, the sturdy front
ranker, and Field-Captain "Bill" Dar
sie, the speed-burning breakaway,
who will both leave college this se
mester. The present illness of "Tiny"
Wines, front-ranker, will not inter
fere with his studies, and is not ex
pected to render him physically unfit
for service on the 1914 squad.
A new candidate for a berth in the
scrum will be Wylie, of New Zealand,
premier side-rank star with the
Australian Waratahs and with the
All-Blacks, who made a clean sweep
in Pacific Coast rugby last fall. Wylie
is considered the biggest single lind
which any Stanford team has had to
start a season with.
Six substitute scrum-men who
watched the last Big Game from the
bench, and who received a thorough
training throughout the preliminary
season are counted on for close bids
in the race for positions on the 1914
team. They are Soper, Dubendorf,
Braden, Ogden, Knight and Pettingill.
With the exception of "Cy" David
son, a full complement of Varsity
backs will appear on the firing-line.
"S" winners in the last intercollegiate
struggle who will be in the running
for backfield positions are Tilton,
Reeves, Austin, Lacliniund, Carroll,
Andrews, Urban, and Erb. C. K.
King, '14. a transfer from Santa Clara
who was not eligible for the team last
fall, will contest heartily for a job
behind the scrum. Burns and Patter
son, veteran second-string players,
will both be seen in the fight for back
field positions also.
Captain-elect "Deke" Gard lias a
hopeful prospect for a winning team
next November. An almost unprece
dented number of Varsity players will
be available as a nucleus for the fight
ing machine. Valuable new material
is an assured fact. Both the North
ern and Southern Interscholastic
teams will contribute candidates.
Considering a further source of sup
ply in the "17" team, the next season
of competition on the turf promises a
grim struggle from the time of the
first preliminary game until the 1914
Varsity is named, with a powerful
playing combination as a result.
