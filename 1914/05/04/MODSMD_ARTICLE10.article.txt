Langworthy Club was threatened by
a real, live "smoke-up" in the wee
sma' hours this morning, until a pa
jama "i)ee-rade" appeared upon the
scene of the near-fire and frightened
the ambitious clouds of smoke away.
After cries of "Fire! Help!" had
pierced the air, gowns, hats and
cloaks began to pour forth from the
upper windows of the clubhouse on
Lasuen Street, and several hundred
"pajamarinos" began sorting the gay
costumes for use in the coming Sen
ior Week carnival.
It was found that the smoke was
caused by a couple of eager logs
which had rolled out of the fireplace.
No damage resulted, and the fire
brigade reluctantly departed.
