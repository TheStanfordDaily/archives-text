Stanford University,
April 29, 1914.
Hundreds of cameras are used at all
j the athletic events in which the Uni
versity takes part, and the snapshots
thus taken are generally treasured as
souvenirs of college days. I feel a
personal interest in the individual ef
fort of every Stanford student, and
I would like to obtain before the
semester closes as many of these
snapshots as possible, in order to
complete my album of Stanford ath
letes.
1 would, therefore, appreciate it as
a personal favor should students hav
ing such photographs of this year's
events and tryouts—or of individual
athletes—give unmounted copies to
me. I would appreciate it further if
the donors would write in pencil on
the back of the photograph the date,
the event, the place, and the name
and class of the one taking the photo
graph.
Let me assure all who thus help me
to make this pictorial record that I
shall lie sincerely grateful.
IT. W. MA LONE Y,
Box 90. Trainer.
