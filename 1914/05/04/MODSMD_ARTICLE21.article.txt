# UNITY CHARACTERIZES ART OF FLONZALEY QUARTETTE
## Peninsula Musical Association Offers Fitting Close to Successful Concert Season. 
### 
As a fitting close to a most success
ful concert season here the Flonzaley
Quartet played in the Assembly Hall
Saturday evening under the auspices
of the Peninsula Musical Association.
The work of the Flonzaleys is a
revelation in ensemble playing, and
their attainments seem nothing short
of perfection in tonal beauty and sin
cerity of musicianship. A perfect
unity characterizes their playing. It
possesses harmony at once in ideal
and execution. Blending as one in
strument and yet at times attaining
almost orchestral force of effect, this
quartet realizes to the fullest the pos
sibilities of chamber-music.
Beethoven's quartet in C Minor
opened the program, the graceful
well received, and as an encore the
artists rendered Rubenstein's "Music
of the Spheres." Breathing out peace,
it was perhaps the most impressive
selection of the evening. A number
rich in interest was the Leclaire So
nata a tre, with its stately largo and
brilliant finale. This was followed
by the exquisite variations of the
adagio from Schubert's "Death and
the Maiden" quartet. The artists gave
as an encore a delicately shaded ren
dering of the sunny Menuetto from
Hayden's U Major quartet.
The andante cantabile from Tschai
kowsky's Quartet in D Major, with
its haunting folk song theme, was fol
lowed by Borodine's Scherzo. The
last encore was the finely-rhythmed
Glazounow Courante.
