fifteen inches in height, but its slen
der outline and extremely smooth

it is much taller. Three delicate sil
ver oars, resting on a plain base of
the same metal, support an exquisite
cup of hammered silver. The oars
cross the perpendicular midway be
tween the base and the upper recep
tacle, giving the entire object the ap
pearance of an hourglass. The oars
project beyond the rim of the cup,
and the extremities are engraved in
the colors of the rival universities—
one being cardinal for Stanford, the
blue foi California, and the
third, a rich cream for the University
of Washington. Each of the three
spaces between the oars will contain
the name of some one of the three
universities, and this portion will be
reserved for the achievements of the
winning crew of the year.
As stipulated by the donor, the
trophy shall become the permanent
property of the Freshman crew which
first wins the annual race on three
occasions.
