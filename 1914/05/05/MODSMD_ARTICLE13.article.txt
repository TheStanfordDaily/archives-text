# A 						LAST WORD—AND YET ANOTHER
## 
### 
On the occasion of the last issue custom lias come to prompt a
glance over the history of the paper for the past semester and at its
prospects for the future. The members of the staff for the vear kji.V
14 have been fortunate in being privileged to chronicle a time which
has seen the Board of Trustees announce and pursue a policy which
means a new era of progress and constructive activity for Stanford; a
time which has seen but few lapses from that consistent assumption of
responsibility by the students which is required of them under Student
Control, which after all is only self-control; and a time which has seen
the administration of student affairs and the general undergraduate
attitude so excellent as to make it possible to say without appearance of
conceit that the type of Stanford men and women is not retrograding.
If the usual petty worries have arisen during the semester —the need
for more businesslike reorganization in certain departments of under
graduate affairs, the difficulty of maintaining peace (
ideals of honor and clean sportsmanship in some i"**'!-
tions—we will throw these troubles to the winds. The h
the general high standards, the greater cooperation bet
Elements of Stanford life, evidenced just now by the appreciated gift
of a beautiful Crew Trophy by Treasurer Charles G. Lathrop—these
things we will chronicle in enduring memory.
On the Daily itself the semester has of course seen manifold disap
pointments and plans gone askew. The fact that the work has been
an unmitigated pleasure to those in charge is due entirely to the cheer
ful aid of the members of the staff—men whom the writer honestly be
lieves to be the most self-sacrificing and hardest-worked in college. The
Daily has primarily endeavored to report important affairs soberly and
correctly. In this effort the usual mistakes of omission and commis
sion have been made; and in addition another serious handicap has
been encountered. This is lack of space. The considerations making a
larger Daily seem almost imperative have been previously set forth.
Our only apology for again harping upon this subject is to arouse the

united insistence and cooperation of the student body in the attaining
of this end.
If this cooperation can be secured and this enlargement made, the
men who will have charge of the paper next year can bring it to the
high-water-mark of its history. Editor-elect Simonson is experienced
arid able, the best man in his class for the position. F. L. Foster has
energetic qualities which will make him an exceptional Business Man
ager. Both men will sacrifice individual interests for those of the paper.
The present staff is remarkably efficient. Due to the courtesy of the
1915 Quad a large assortment of interesting cuts will be available here
after; and if a paper of proper size is secured lack of space will not
make necessary their elimination, as has been the case with the few at
this semester. Circumstances should also make possible the
