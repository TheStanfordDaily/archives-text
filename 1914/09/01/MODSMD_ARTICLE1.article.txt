### 
The Eastern invasion of the Stan
ford tennis team, composed of R. Lind
ley Murray, *13, and Herbert L. Hahn,
'16, which commenced at the close of
college last semester and continued
practically throughout the summer,
has met with almost unparalleled suc
cess. Out of a series of eight matches
contested with the strongest university
teams of the country, the Cardinal duo
were victorious In every instance. The
later career of Murray on the East
ern courts was well nigh meteoric in
its brilliancy, the tennis world being
set agog by the sensational playing of
a new and unheralded star.
The University of Colorado team
were the first to fall before the play of
the Stanford racquet wielders in the
opening play on May 14. Murray de
feated Axelrod in straight sets, 6-1, 6-1,
while Hahn overcame Scott by a 6-2,
6-3 score. The doubles also fell to the
Cardinal players in easy fashion.
On May 18 Missouri University lost
to the Stanford, winning only eight
games out of a total of seven sets. The
following day the players from the
Illinois* institution became the vic
tims of Murray and Hahn again, with
out even the loss of a set. On May 21
and 24, respectively, 'he universities
or botn cmcago am Wisconsin v ji-e
forced to acknowledge defeat at the
hands of the visiting tennis experts.
The last three college contests en
gaged in by the Stanford pair were
with able and well-known Eastern
teams, namely Harvard, Amherst and
Yale. Yale, managed to annex the
doubles, but both Murray and I-lahn
won their singles matches, thereby
gaining the victory. With Harvard,
on May 27, it was the same story, Stan
ford winning both singles, but losing
the doubles. The day following, the
schedule of play with the university
teams closed, when Amherst, repre
sented by the state champions of
Massachusetts, were forced to bow in
superiority to the Cardinal duo, not
being credited with a match.
On account of their splendid show
ing against college teams of ability,
both Murray and Hahn were invited
to enter several of the big Eastern
tournaments, the first of which, last
ing from June 5 to 9, was the Sleepy
Hollow Tournament, in New York.
Murray upset all predictions of likely
winners by gaining a well-earned vic
tory in the finals. Inside of one day
he overcame Hall, an Eastern cham
pion, who ranks among the ten best
players in the country; Behr, the
third man on the American Davis cup
team, and Alexander, five-time na
tional doubles champion. The accom
plishment of this feat brought Murray
instant recognition as a new and for
midable tennis star from critics all
over the United States. In addition to
the singles. Murray and Hahn also won
the doubles' title.
The New England championship at
Hartford, Connecticut, from June 11 to
13, were the next laurels to fall to the
lot of the Cardinal players. Murray be
came the singles victor and also the
doubles with his partner Hahn. Lynn
Murray continued his sensational
spurt by" annexing the championship
of the Metropolitan Tournament held
on Ixrng Island a week later, when
again he defeated the veteran Alex
ander. The Stanford player met his
first, defeat in the Delaware State
Championships on July 7, at the hands
of Church, a Princeton racquet wield
er.
The semi-finals of the Seabright
Tournament, New Jersey, July 16, pit
ted Murray against R. Norris Williams,
second man 011 the United States Davis
Cup team. In the third set, with the
score reading exactly even, 6-4, 4-6,
5-5, Murray became prostrated by the
heat, and was forced to default the
match. His game fight against a
player of such ability increased his
eve.r-growing reputation as a new ten
nis wonder.
Murray displayed his best form
of the summer in the finals of the Long
wood singles, when he fought Maurice
McLaughlin, the international cham
pion, and offered him the severest com
petition of the present season, accord
ing to the San Francisco star's own
statement. Murray again played Mc-
Laughlin on August 20 in the finals of
the New York State Championship,
when he was defeated after a hard
match. The last tournament of the
season in which Murray entered was
the National Championships, at New
port. Dope was slightly upset when
just previous to the semi-finals he
was eliminated by Behr, the Davis
Cup player, whom earlier in the sum
mer he had defeated.
Newspapers throughout the country
have praised the rise of the latest star
in tennis circles, some of which treat
ed not only his skill with the racquet
in glowing terms, but also his sports
manship. The Boston Post, In a long
article upon Murray's success in the
issue of July 13, made the following
noteworthy statement: "Despite very
faulty refereeing, that seemed to .rob
Murray of his match yesterday, yet he
won, and so handsomely as to awaken
an admiration which will be more last
ing than if he were only a marvellous
ly perfect tennis machine, and the
thing ended there."
The cups and prizes which Murray
and Hahn became the posessors of, by
their victories, are valuable and nu
merous in number. Both students were
elated with the success of their trip.
Hahn has already arrived on the cam
pus, but Murray is not expected to
reach California before the latter part
of the week.
