# Changes on the Board
## 
### 
We have lost the President of the
Board of Trustees, and gained another.
Timothy Hopkins, for six years the
head of the Board of Directors of this
institution, has resigned his position,
and W. Mayo Newhall has been chosen
his successor. Mr. Hopkins has re
signed the presidency, and probably
will not be the familiar Saturday morn
ing figure that we have come to know
in the last year, but his is a personality
that is not forgotten. Our apprecia
tion of his service is real, we lack only
the means of expression.
Tt takes an unusual man to fill such
a vacancy, but in the immediate selec
tion of W. Mayo Newhall it is felt that
the Board has taken a step that will
win general approbation. Mr. New
hall has shown in his two years' work
as Trustee that he takes an intense in
terest. in the University, and in his new
official capacity we have no doubt his
activity will increase. His was the
guiding hand in the completely success
ful inauguration service of October,
1913 ,and his influence has been pre
dominate in the management of the es
tate during the last two years.
Since his election as Board Presi
dent, Mr. Newhall has spent some
months in the Eastern states, studying
the business administration of the larg
er universities. This hints of careful
and scientific management.
Vanderlynn Stow has been the act
ing Treasurer since the resignation of
the late Charles G. Lathrop early in
the spring. He was the logical man for
the position, and his known desire to
simplify the machinery of the business
management is a prediction of in
creased efficiency.
