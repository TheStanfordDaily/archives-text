# "Beyond the Mountains"
## 
### 
Again we have cause to glow with
pride over the worthy achievements of
Stanford men. Two Cardinal teams
"looked heyond the mountains for com
petition" this summer, and they have
returned with laurels to spare. The
meteoric flight of our tennis duo across
the continent is unmatched in the his
tory of the Stanford game. The East

has again been prodded into a realiza
tion that the Cardinal hat is still in the
ring for athletic honors, and, better
still, they have made further acquaint
ance with Stanford sportsmanship.
The little band of trackmen won no
mean laurels when they captured sec
ond place honors in the Missouri and
Mississippi Valley, they were small in
number, but great in accomplishment.
In the enemy's territory, far from the
base of supplies, they fought against
great odds, and vanquished on the cin
der path many a larger university. All
credit to them!
