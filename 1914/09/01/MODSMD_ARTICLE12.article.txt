The grim Spectre stalks with us al
ways, the hand of Death sometimes
chills us in our play. In June Charles
G. Lathrop, for many years Treasurer
of this University, was called, and
Stanford had lost a man who had been
devoting his entire interest to the af
fairs of the University, the last direct
link that bound the Leland Stanford
family to the present day. Mr. Lathrop
was a man whom few of the undergrad
uates were privileged to know, but his
lively interest in campus life was
always manifest, and in late years
his support was of a material
characterâ€”the massive silver "Charles
G. Lathrop Trophy" for interfra
ternal and interclub rugby, and
the trophy for winning freshmen crews,
attest his personal concern in things
collegiate.
Tn the untimely death of Crayton L.
Long the undergraduates suffered a
shock that leaves a hurt. His life
thread was cut after two years of col
lege work, and his sterling qualities
had found recognition in so many of
his acquaintances, that the tragedy of
August twelfth causes a widespread
sorrow. He was a man with many
friends.
