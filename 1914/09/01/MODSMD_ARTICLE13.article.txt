Heigho! We've forgotten something.
Here we are to sail our dreadnaught
type of Flatbed Press into the six
months' fray with adversity, with no
standard nailed to our topmast. So we
put about, dodge behind Change for
temporary shelter, and emerge with
the same bit of punting lashed to the
halliards that was flaunted to ill
winds and favoring breezes on Sep
tember, 1, 1891, the first issue of the
Stanford daily:"The Daily will be
to the students what the metropolitan
paper is to the business man, the me
dium through which all items of in
terest may be published to the Univer
sity community. It will contain items
of interest from other colleges of the
country, and thus span the distance
between this and other universities."
Contrary to all rules of strategy, we
open a channel for foreign invasion
close to the home port, and mark it
'Communications.' On that side we
will always; welcome broadsides of
criticism, usually return them, some
times join forces, rarely surrender.
