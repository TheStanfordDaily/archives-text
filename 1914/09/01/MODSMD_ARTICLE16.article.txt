## Mine Disaster Near Bakersfield Claims Life of Popular Under classman. 
### 
Stanford students were shocked to
hear on August 12 of the tragic fate of
Cray ton Long, '16, who was the victim
of a mine disaster.
C.rayton was employed during the
summer months in the Big Blue Gold
Mine, at Kernville, sixty-five miles
north of Bakersfield, California. The
mine is the property of the Kern De
velopment Co., in which C. S. Long, of
Hayward, the father of Crayton, has
an interest.
On August 12 the people living in
the vicinity of the mine noticed a thin
wreath of smoke curling out of the
mouth of the shaft. Crayton Long, Wil
liam G. Long, his uncle, and William
Wharton, a graduate of the University
of California, determined to investi
gate the cause of the fire. They en
tered the main passageway, after tak
ing leave of the fourth member of the
party, an employe.
The smoke soon grew so dense that
further entrance was impossible. A
rescue party from the Bakersfield
fire department arrived on the scene
afte.r several hours, but failed to ac
complish the recovery of the lost
miners. Robert Long, another uncle
of Crayton, was the first to find the
bodies—two thousand feet from the
mouth. It is believed that the men dis
covered their plight too late and
were overcome by the fumes before
they had time to run to safety. The
fumes were generated by smoldering
powder.
While at college, Crayton Long was
actively engaged in lower class mat
ters. He was awarded a block "1G"
for Freshman crew, and his name ap
peared on the football squad. He was
twenty years of age at the time of the
accident. Long was a member of the
