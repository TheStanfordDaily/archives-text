## 
### 
A number of important changes in
the personnel of the officers of the
Hoard of Trustees have been made
during the past month. W. Mayo New
hail has been chosen President to
succeed Timothy Hopkins, resigned.
Vanderlynn Stow, Busness Manager of
the University, has been elected Treas
urer to fill the vacancy left by the
death of the late Charles G. Lathrop.
Leon Sloss is the new Secretary of the
Board of Trustees. Frank Miller, as
Assistant Treasurer and Charles P.
Eells, as Vice-President, retain their
former offices.
After six years as President of the
Board, Mr. Hopkins expressed the de-

;iire t> ic«lic fvoi.. hid official on
pacity. During his term of office the
President has worked hard for the
best interests of the University, and
it was with great reluctance that his
resignation was accepted. He will
remain an active member of the Board,
and has been chosen chairman of the
University Committee, one of the two
important committees of the Board.
Mr. Hopkins is one of the two sur
viving members of the original Board
selected by Senator Stanford, the other
being the Honorable Horace Davis. He
has contributed very generously to the
various departments o? the University,
being the donor of the Seaside Labora
tory at Pacific Grove and the valuable
Hopkins Library. He has also been
intensely interested in the Stanford
Medical School.
W. Mayo Newhall, one of the recent
appointees to the Board of Trustees,
is the newly-elected President. He
was placed on the Board to aid in the
management of the ranches, but has
shown a deep interest in the Univer
sity and campus affairs, and in the
work of beautifying the grounds of
the University. Mr. Newhall is one of
the most successful managers of
ranches in California, and carries on
a large import and export business. He
is a graduate of Yale University, re
ceiving his B. S. in Tfi, and also the
Columbia Law School. After prac
ticing law for several years in San
Francisco he dropped practice to man
age the extensive Newhall family es
tates, and has continued in that busi
ness.
It was decided most, efficient to
place the work of Treasurer and Busi
ness Manager in the hands of one man.
The plan of having a trust company as
Treasurer of the University has been
under consideration, but this idea was
not deemed advisable for efficent
management,, and the office was.
therefore, kept in the Board. Vander
lynn Stow, who was made Business
Manager last year, was chosen Treas
urer. He has done much to simplify
and make more direct the business
methods of the University.
The business office has been re
moved to San Francisco, where it is
now in the Nevada building.. Mr.
Stow maintains an office on the cam
pus.

Several changes have been made in
the business department. A. M. Wol
ferden resigned and is teaching a com
mercial course in one of the bay
cities. D. Monasch, mrchasing agent
was promoted to off.ee manager. P.
K. Funk, '06, and graduate of the Har
vard Law School, hat been made pur
chasng agent for the University.
W. E. Caldwell, Secietary of Board of
Trustees, tendered his resignation,
and Leon Sloan was elected to
serve in that capacity. However,
Monasch will act as clerk of the Board,
and take the minutes of the meetings.
Under the new administration the

The plan of having a trust company as
Treasurer of the University has been
under consideration, but this idea was
not deemed advisable for efficent
management,, and the office was.
therefore, kept in the Board. Vander
lynn Stow, who was made Business
Manager last year, was chosen Treas
urer. He has done much to simplify
and make more direct the business
methods of the University.
The business office has been re
moved to San Francisco, where it is
now in the Nevada building.. Mr.
Stow maintains an office on the cam
pus.

Several changes have been made in
the business department. A. M. Wol
ferden resigned and is teaching a com
mercial course in one of the bay
cities. D. Monasch, mrchasing agent
was promoted to off.ee manager. P.
K. Funk, '06, and graduate of the Har
vard Law School, hat been made pur
chasng agent for the University.
W. E. Caldwell, Secietary of Board of
Trustees, tendered his resignation,
and Leon Sloan was elected to
serve in that capacity. However,
Monasch will act as clerk of the Board,
and take the minutes of the meetings.
Under the new administration the
President of the Board has named two

larp-p. pnmmitteps.. bp has the com
mittees pick their own chairmen.
These committees select sub-commit
teees, and they, in turn, choose their
chairmen.
