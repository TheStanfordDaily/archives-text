# SUMMER WORK ON ESTATE RESULTS IN NOTICEABLE AND VARIED IMPROVEMENTS
## 
### 
Beside the work which has been done
on the Stanford Union, the Women's
Clubhouse and the Memorial church,
many improvements and changes have
been made on the Stanford Campus
during the summer. Superintendent J.
E. Hewston, in charge of the Campus,
has had a large force of men at work
during the entire vacation, cleaning,
remodeling and improving.
Roads have been oiled and repaired,
the automobile road leading up to the
arboretum having been worked over
so that slow driving is not impeded.
Reckless racing, however, has been
done away with by the numerous
bumps in the highway. No new roads
have been opened during the summer.
Superintendent Hewston has moved
one large barn from the old farm to a
new location back of the forge and
shop buildings, in order to center all
equipment. Several sheds in that vi
cinity have been torn down. On the
whole the supervision of the grounds
will be much facilitated by these

changes. Much work was done on the
Campus houses during the summer, by
order of the University authorities.
The wo.rk of removing the debris
caused by the earthquake several years
ago proceeded rapidly during the sum
mer. All of the useless wreckage
around the old gymnasium and library
has been removed and the good bricks
have been cleaned and stacked ready
for sale. Work of cleaning away the
debris from the wings of the museum
has been nearly completed.
Superintendent Hewston now has
been at work installing a new pumping
plant in the arboretum, which will be
used as an auxiliary station for pump
ing domestic water supply. The old
pumping plant has been severely taxed
at times to meet the demand for do
mestic water on the campus.
Buildings about the Campus, and the
Campus grounds are in better shape
this fall than for several seasons, yet
Mr. Hewston reports that he still has
plenty of wo.rk to do during the fall.
