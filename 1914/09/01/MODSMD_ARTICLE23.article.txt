# EDITOR HAGEN WIELDS CHAPPIE'S HAMMER IN FIRST ISSUE OF COMIC
## 
### 
Editor M. A. Hagen, '15, issued his
first Chappie of the semester this
morning. From the suggestive green
of the cartooned cover to the startling
story-feature which closes the issue,
this Freshman number is brimful of
novel and cleve.r surprises. It is an
entirely new Chappie with the spirit
of the old Stanford comic—a combina
tion that augurs well for an unusually
successful year.
Hammer and Coffin Society an
nounces newly-elected members and
and additions to the Chaparral staff
in this issue—J. C. Cross, '17; H. S.
Marshutz, '17; R. A. Griffin, '17, and L.
McDermott, '17, being the successful
contributors of the past year.
The first page is illuminated by ad
vice, in which Chappie puts the Fresh
man "on the boat." The frontispiece
is a full-page halftone depicting the
lovely "Miss Eighteen" with an appro
priate bit of verse. M. A. Oliver, '15,
the new art editor, has outdone him
self in this contribution, which is un
usually artistic.
The front-page poem, "The Song of
Six-Pence—and Then Some," reflects
the clever rhythms of H. M. Levy, '16.
The new editorial page design is the
work of R. N. Wenzel, '16. The ref
erence to the editor as "Chappie XIX,"
signifying that the present editor-in
chief is the nineteenth man to swing
the Chappie's sledge is the result of a
suggestion by B,ris||jow Adams. '00,
"the father of the Chaparral." Tn his
"Now That's," Editor Milt Hagen, '15,
expresses himself in the refreshing
style of the new school of American
journalists. He comments on the joys
of returning to college; outlines his
general editorial views; deals with
"local option" at Stanford, and wel
comes the new staff and the return of
P. Levy, '12.
The Dilettante deals with the trials
and difficulties of a Dilettante writer.
It. is written by the mysterious H. A.
C., '06, who also contributes a short
novel and the before-mentioned page
of Freshman advice.
F. S. Murray, '16, has furnished a
full-page cut entitled "College Opens,"
while L. McDermott, '17, pictures a
novel way of selecting the popular
"500" in a clever drawing captioned
"Why Not?"
"Rough's Corner" is a new depar-'
ture, made up of sparkling light verse
and patter. "The Perils of Paul Lean,
Frosh," is the title of a full-page film,
in which Chappie competes with the
eminent publisher, W. R. Hearst, and
with him deserts the legitimate field
of Journalism to enter the motion
picture industry.
"Three Weeps," a daring and start
ling novel of present-day conditions in
three splashes, closes the number. Tt
is from the pen of Miss Helen Orr
Grin, with "scenery" by R. N. Wenzel,
'16.
Other art invasions are from the
brush of Miss Margery Bailey, '14; ,T.
Olsen, '15; R. N. Wenzel, '16; F. S.
Murray, *16, and L. McDermott. '17.
