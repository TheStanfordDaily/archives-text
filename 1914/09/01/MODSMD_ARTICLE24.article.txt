# BURNING GLUE TESTS CAMPUS FIRE BRIGADE
## 
### 
An electric glue pot was the origin
of a small blaze in the Bookstore last
Tuesday evening, which was quickly
put out by the volunteer fire brigade.
The alarm was given by a passerby,
and the scattered residents of the
campus responded with such prompt
ness that practically no damage was
done.
No advance in the price of books has
been noticed.
