# ANNUAL TAX NOW SECURES SEASON TICKETS FOR YEAR
## New Method of Collecting Student Assessment Removes Trouble of Payment Each Semester. 
### 
Payment of five dollars will obtain
student body privileges and admission
to athletic meets at Stanford during
the entire college year of 1914-15. The
change from the former practice of
collecting funds at the beginning of
each semester was made by Gradu
ate Manager R. W. Wilcox for the con
venience of both students and student
body.
Three dollars of the total charge is
a student body assessment intended
for permanent improvement of ath
letic fields and equipment, and other
student interests. The remaining two
dollars, the cost of a season ticket to
games and meets, is used to defray the
expenses of athletic teams.
Holders of season tickets will be
aumitted to all athletic contests on
Stanford field, track and diamond, ex
cept the annual contests with Califor
nia, and other meets in which extra
ordinary expense is involved.
Possession of a student body re
ceipt is the only condition which will
allow advance pur.rchase of two tick
ets to the Stanford-California rugby
game.
On payment of the dues, each stu
dent will receive a red button of en
dorsement. The amount is now pay
able at the Registrar's office.
