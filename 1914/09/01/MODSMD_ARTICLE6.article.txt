Treasurer of the University, and up
to January of this year business man
ager, died at his home on the Campus
after his Gsth birthc'ay.
Mr. Lathrop's health had been fa
ing for a number of years, and f< • ■
some time before his death had be<
critical. On the Wednesday mornii "
following his death, funeral services
were held in Memorial Church.
Mr. Lathrop was connected with the
University from its foundation. The
youngest brother of Mrs. Stanford, he
was born in Albany, N. Y., May 11,
1849. At the age of 28, after several
years of banking experience in his na
tive city, he came to California, and
was employed in the passenger depart-

ment of the Southern Pacific Railway.
In 1879 he joined his brother Ariel La
throp, in the management of Governor
Stanford's business affairs, and when
the University was founded, their du
ties were enlarged to include its busi
ness management. Tn 1892 Ariel L-a
throp returned to the East, and Charles
Lathrop assumed full control of the
duties which the two brothers had pre
viously exercised. After Governor
Stanford's death in June, 1893, Mrs.
Stanford retained her brother in the
same position, appointing him a mem
ber of the Hoard of Trustees, and in
1898 making him business manager of
the University.
Tn 1899, Mrs. Stanford, in an ad-

dress to the Boa.rd of Trustees, directed
that Mr. Lathrop should be retained in
these positions upon her death, and
the Board followed her wishes, when
it came into full control of the Uni
versity in 1905. Last June Mr. La
throp retired from the business man
agership of the University on account
of his failing health, which prevented
his active discharge of the duties of the
position. He was retained, however,
as Treasurer.
Charles Gardner Lathrop's attitude
towards the University was marked by
his zealous regard for the purposes
and wishes of his sister, as he un
derstood them. As a trustee, he
stanchly supported enterprises which,
in his opinion, were in harmony with
her plans, and firmly opposed every
thing that he considered a deviation.
On the Campus Mr. Lathrop was par
ticularly interested in the reconstruc
tion of the Church and in the Library.
For years he has maintained a fund
for the purpose of books relating to
California, particularly its early his
tory, and since the establishment of
the Medical Department he has con
tributed to the support of its library.
By his will, among other bequests to
hospitals and charitable organizations
in San Francisco, he left $10,000 to
Lane Hospital.

to January of this year business man
ager, died at his home on the Campus
after his Gsth birthc'ay.
Mr. Lathrop's health had been fa
ing for a number of years, and f< • ■
some time before his death had be<
critical. On the Wednesday mornii "
following his death, funeral services
were held in Memorial Church.
Mr. Lathrop was connected with the
University from its foundation. The
youngest brother of Mrs. Stanford, he
was born in Albany, N. Y., May 11,
1849. At the age of 28, after several
years of banking experience in his na
tive city, he came to California, and
was employed in the passenger depart-

ment of the Southern Pacific Railway.
In 1879 he joined his brother Ariel La
throp, in the management of Governor
Stanford's business affairs, and when
the University was founded, their du
ties were enlarged to include its busi
ness management. Tn 1892 Ariel L-a
throp returned to the East, and Charles
Lathrop assumed full control of the
duties which the two brothers had pre
viously exercised. After Governor
Stanford's death in June, 1893, Mrs.
Stanford retained her brother in the
same position, appointing him a mem
ber of the Hoard of Trustees, and in
1898 making him business manager of
the University.
Tn 1899, Mrs. Stanford, in an ad-

dress to the Boa.rd of Trustees, directed
that Mr. Lathrop should be retained in
these positions upon her death, and
the Board followed her wishes, when
it came into full control of the Uni
versity in 1905. Last June Mr. La
throp retired from the business man
agership of the University on account
of his failing health, which prevented
his active discharge of the duties of the
position. He was retained, however,
as Treasurer.
Charles Gardner Lathrop's attitude
towards the University was marked by
his zealous regard for the purposes
and wishes of his sister, as he un
derstood them. As a trustee, he
stanchly supported enterprises which,
in his opinion, were in harmony with
her plans, and firmly opposed every
thing that he considered a deviation.
On the Campus Mr. Lathrop was par
ticularly interested in the reconstruc
tion of the Church and in the Library.
For years he has maintained a fund
for the purpose of books relating to
California, particularly its early his
tory, and since the establishment of
the Medical Department he has con
tributed to the support of its library.
By his will, among other bequests to
hospitals and charitable organizations
in San Francisco, he left $10,000 to
Lane Hospital.
