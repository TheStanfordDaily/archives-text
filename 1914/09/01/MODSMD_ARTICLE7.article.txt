Washington—Diplomats state that if
the United States should purchase Ger
man merchantmen lying in American
ports they would be liable to seizure by
the French and British. They say that
when found on the high seas they
would doubtless be seized by the allies
and would be held by them until the
prize courts should decide whether
(heir purchase had violated neutrality.
Washington—lt is reported here that
a proposal has been made in the House
of Representatives to levy a five per
cent war tax on railroads.
Vienna, via Rome—A statement from
the Austrian war office calls the bat
tle now raging on the Austrian-Rus
sian-Prussian frontier the "Greatest in
the World's History." It asserts that
three million men are actually engaged
in fighting, and that every branch of
the service is represented. The tide
of battle ebbs and flows and the result
is at present entirely undecided. The
announcement stated that, as a result
of the extreme concentration of the
troops along a portion of the line of
battle, sixty miles wide between Lublin
on the west and Grubieszow on the
east, two towns of Russian Poland, the
fighting has become almost

in Northern France, although it is ad
mitted that the front of the allies has
been pushed back again. At the last
report the Germans had assaulted the
center of the forces of the allies, and
the battle is still raging. The Ger
mans are anxious to signalize the anni
versary of the surrender of Napoleon
111 at Sedan on September 2, 1870, in
the F.ranco-Prussian War with a not
able triumph in the campaign now rag
ing. The fighting about La Fere, only
a scant fifty miles from Sedan, is the
most ferocious of the war to
date. The cabinet has decided that it
is unnecessary to fear an immediate
siege of Paris, though all precautions
would continue to be taken.
Berlin—Via The Hague—The Ger
man war office makes the statement
that the advance of their Army of the
North continues, and the French and
British have been repulsed with heavy
losses near La Fere, a small town in
France, midway between Paris and the
Belgian bo.rdor. Operations are every
where satisfactory and all the at
tempted advances of the Crown Prince
have been successful.
Rome—Great crowds of people in
Rome have gathered in St. Peter's
Square, watching the Sistine Chapel,
and awaiting developments. The doors
of the chapel, which were sealed yes
terday when the conclave went into
session, will be opened by workmen to
admit Cardinal Gibbons and Cardinal
O'Connell when they arrive. The pas
sages leading to the apartments of the
cardinals will then be searched again
and the doors resealed, not to be
opened until a new pontiff has been
chosen.
Paris—Four German armies under
Grand Duke Alhreeht and Generals
Vonklug, Van Buelow. and Von Hansen
are pounding the left wing of the
French army. The forces of the allies
are retiring intact. The Germans have
