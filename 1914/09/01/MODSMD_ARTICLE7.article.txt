Washington—Diplomats state that if
the United States should purchase Ger
man merchantmen lying in American
ports they would be liable to seizure by
the French and British. They say that
when found on the high seas they
would doubtless be seized by the allies
and would be held by them until the
prize courts should decide whether
(heir purchase had violated neutrality.
Washington—lt is reported here that
a proposal has been made in the House
of Representatives to levy a five per
cent war tax on railroads.
Vienna, via Rome—A statement from
the Austrian war office calls the bat
tle now raging on the Austrian-Rus
sian-Prussian frontier the "Greatest in
the World's History." It asserts that
three million men are actually engaged
in fighting, and that every branch of
the service is represented. The tide
of battle ebbs and flows and the result
is at present entirely undecided. The
announcement stated that, as a result
of the extreme concentration of the
troops along a portion of the line of
battle, sixty miles wide between Lublin
on the west and Grubieszow on the
east, two towns of Russian Poland, the
fighting has become almost

in Northern France, although it is ad
mitted that the front of the allies has
been pushed back again. At the last
report the Germans had assaulted the
center of the forces of the allies, and
the battle is still raging. The Ger
mans are anxious to signalize the anni
versary of the surrender of Napoleon
111 at Sedan on September 2, 1870, in
the F.ranco-Prussian War with a not
able triumph in the campaign now rag
ing. The fighting about La Fere, only
a scant fifty miles from Sedan, is the
most ferocious of the war to
date. The cabinet has decided that it
is unnecessary to fear an immediate
siege of Paris, though all precautions
would continue to be taken.
Berlin—Via The Hague—The Ger
man war office makes the statement
that the advance of their Army of the
North continues, and the French and
British have been repulsed with heavy
losses near La Fere, a small town in
France, midway between Paris and the
Belgian bo.rdor. Operations are every
where satisfactory and all the at
tempted advances of the Crown Prince
have been successful.
Rome—Great crowds of people in
Rome have gathered in St. Peter's
Square, watching the Sistine Chapel,
and awaiting developments. The doors
of the chapel, which were sealed yes
terday when the conclave went into
session, will be opened by workmen to
admit Cardinal Gibbons and Cardinal
O'Connell when they arrive. The pas
sages leading to the apartments of the
cardinals will then be searched again
and the doors resealed, not to be
opened until a new pontiff has been
chosen.
Paris—Four German armies under
Grand Duke Alhreeht and Generals
Vonklug, Van Buelow. and Von Hansen
are pounding the left wing of the
French army. The forces of the allies
are retiring intact. The Germans have
mounted their heavy artillery and are
Shqlling the French entrenchments
about Sedan, near the Belgian border
line in 'France, where one of the de
cisive battles of the Franco-Prussian
war was fought in 1870, and to the
south of that point. The French army
in Lorraine continues on the offensive.
Paris — Millerand, the French
Minister of War, states that General
Joffre and the other French generals
agree that the German assaults are
weakening. M. Malvy, Minister of the
Interior, says: "We are making many
sacrifices, and may have to make more,
but France will win in the end. The
nations of the world are now passing a
supreme crisis. Everything has been
made ready for a long war, and the
spirit of the people is unconquerable."
St. Petersburg —The government, an
nounces that the entire active portion
of the Austrian army is in Galicia, the
northern province of Austria-Hungary,
near the Russian border, but that the
Russian army continues to advance
against them. The Russians are now
only a day's match from Lemberg,
the capital of the Province of Galicia.
The Russian lines are extending for
miles on both sides of Lember from
Kamenka to Brozozdovitza. The gov
ernment has issued the following state
ment: "The German defence is stif
fening. We are sustaining heavy
losses, but the German loss is far
heavier and they will be unable to
withstand our assault. In Galicia the
Russians have been victorious. The
Austrians invading Russian Poland
have been repulsed with enormous
losses and are falling back."
Paris—M. Millerand, French Minister
of War, announces that he has issued a
call for reservists in the French terri
torial army enlisting from the North
and Northeast of France.

the F.ranco-Prussian War with a not

a scant fifty miles from Sedan, is the
most ferocious of the war to

Berlin—Via The Hague—The Ger
man war office makes the statement
that the advance of their Army of the
North continues, and the French and
British have been repulsed with heavy
losses near La Fere, a small town in
France, midway between Paris and the
Belgian bo.rdor. Operations are every

have been successful.
Rome—Great crowds of people in
Rome have gathered in St. Peter's
Square, watching the Sistine Chapel,
and awaiting developments. The doors
of the chapel, which were sealed yes
terday when the conclave went into
session, will be opened by workmen to
admit Cardinal Gibbons and Cardinal
O'Connell when they arrive. The pas

chosen.
Paris—Four German armies under
Grand Duke Alhreeht and Generals
Vonklug, Van Buelow. and Von Hansen

south of that point. The French army
in Lorraine continues on the offensive.
Paris — Millerand, the French
Minister of War, states that General
Joffre and the other French generals
agree that the German assaults are
weakening. M. Malvy, Minister of the
Interior, says: "We are making many
sacrifices, and may have to make more,
but France will win in the end. The
nations of the world are now passing a
supreme crisis. Everything has been
made ready for a long war, and the
spirit of the people is unconquerable."
St. Petersburg —The government, an
nounces that the entire active portion
of the Austrian army is in Galicia, the
northern province of Austria-Hungary,
near the Russian border, but that the
Russian army continues to advance
against them. The Russians are now
only a day's match from Lemberg,
the capital of the Province of Galicia.
The Russian lines are extending for
miles on both sides of Lember from
Kamenka to Brozozdovitza. The gov
ernment has issued the following state
ment: "The German defence is stif
fening. We are sustaining heavy
losses, but the German loss is far
heavier and they will be unable to
withstand our assault. In Galicia the
Russians have been victorious. The
Austrians invading Russian Poland
have been repulsed with enormous
losses and are falling back."
Paris—M. Millerand, French Minister
of War, announces that he has issued a
call for reservists in the French terri

the service is represented. The tide
