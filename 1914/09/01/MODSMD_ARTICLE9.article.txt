# Eighteen!
## 
### 
We're back again, and we're glad to
be here. For during these first days
of registration, in these times of hear
ty greeting for all our college friends,
we know the strength of associations
formed, the depth of our loyalty to our
Alma Mater, the joyous flood of feel
ing that comes in the return to well
loved scenes, as we do at no other
time. Our appreciation of the privi
leges offered us is quickened—we de
termine to rise equal to every oppor
tunity. We are glad to be back.
And on our return from work and
play to the semester's tussle with the
higher branches of learning, we find
that additions have been made to the
Stanford Family—another class de
mands recognition as part of the whole.
'Eighteen' is with us, and with boyish
confidence compels our notice, whatev
er form our greetings may take.
Greetings, Freshmen! We are glad to
see you, glad that it is our portion to
welcome such a body of men and wo
men. We know that there is room for
you here, a place in the scheme of
things that we expect you to fill. The
University is worthy of you—shall you
be a worthy product four years hence?
The four years begin today.
