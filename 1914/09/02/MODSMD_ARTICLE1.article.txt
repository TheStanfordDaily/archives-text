# TRACK MEN ESTABLISH FAME BEYOND ROCKIES
## TEN ATHLETES PROVE VALUE TO STANFORD ON SUMMER TRAVELS. FUN AND WORK ARE COMBINED HOSPITABLE CARE ALONG THE WAY INCREASES GOOD FEELING. 
### 
Ten Stanford athletes, the cream of
the Cardinal track squad, left the
campus on May 24 for the Mid
dle West, en route to the con
ference track meets of the Mississippi
Valley Universities. Coach E. P.
Campbell, '13; Captain P. B. McKee,
'14; Captain-elect E. M. Bonnett, '15;
G. W. Bedeau, '15; H. B. Wolcott, '14;
R. Krohn, '16; J. D. Chace, '16; F. S.
Murray, '16; J. K. Norton, '16, and P.
Wilson, '16, constituted the personnel
of the team, which was accompanied
by H. W. Maloney, in the capacity of
trainer and rub-down fan. Three stu
dents, S. F. Pellas, '13; R. R. Parkin
son, '15, and H. C. Houghton, '16, of
fered their services as a self-appointed
Stanford rooting section.
The travelers spent three hours in
Denver, where they were met by Grad
uate Manager R. W. Wilcox, '13, who
took charge of the financial end of the
trip from that time on. A brother of
J. F. Lauagen, a former Stanford foot
ball coach, met the boys at the station
and treated them to a two-hour spin
in automobiles through the city.. An
hour's workout on the Denver track
followed this diversion. At an altitude
of five thousand feet, the runners ex
perienced extreme difficulty in sav
ing their wind, and it was found es
pecially hard to negotiate the longer
distances in good time.
St. Louis Thoroughly Explored.
On the afternoon of May 27, the
team arrived in St. Louis. Harry L.
Borders, a former Stanford law man,
immediately took charge of their en
tertainment, and throughout their stay
in the metropolis did more to make
life pleasant than any entire alumni
association could have done. The men
were first taken in a Ford parade all
over the city, and later they were con
ducted through the Budweiser brewery
—an interesting experience for all of
them. Then the Stanford athletes
"broke into society," making a visit to
all of the best St. Louis country clubs.
The heat oppressed the men at this
stage of the journey, and strongly af
fected their showing on the field. The
local newspapers lauded the athletic
accomplishments of the visitors, and,
to use the words of one of the team,
"It gave us too much to live up to."
The St. Louis track was a very good
one, three laps to the mile, with a 220-
yard panhandle. In the preliminaries,
held on May 29, every man qualified in
his heat, all winning the events except
one.
Chicago Outruns Cardinals.
But the unforseen happened, and
the University of Chicago won the
meet by 10V2 points. McKee, who was
counted on to fatten the total consid-
erably, strained a tendon, and, al
though he had won his heat in a fast
10:1, was forced to drop out of the
race. Campbell's efforts in the stren
uous quarter incapacitated him for
the 220. In the light hurdles, F. S.
Murray hit a starting hole of the 100-
yard dash and fell flat. Stanford had,
in fact, seven men against Chicago's
thirty-five—and here is the story of
the fight they put up against odds:
Campbell second and Chace third in
quarter to Cowman of Holla's record
time of .48 2-5; Bonnettfirst in the 880
in 1:56, breaking the conference rec
ord; Wilson first in the mile in
4:22 2-5; Norton third in the high
hurdles; Murray first and Norton sec
ond in the low hurdles, time. 24 4-5
seconds, breaking the record; Bedeau
fiirst in the shot, with a heave of 42
feet, 3 3-8 inches; Campbell third in
the broad jumps, and Krohn tied for
second in the pole vault at 11 feet, 6
inches. The total of the successes
was 34 points, giving the Cardinals
second place to the University of Chi
cago's 44 1-2 points. Colorado was
third with 15 points.
On the following day the team left
for Chicago.
Team Trains on Midway.
The conditions for training were
very favorable, large lawn areas lying
about tile Midway, a spur of Jack
son Park, which passed in front of the
hotel iv • ! ,;>■ Wilcox arranged a
trip through the famous stock yards
for his charges, and also treated them
to an evening at the Majestic Theatre.
The team also witnessed a baseball
game between the New York and Chi
cago Americans.
Coach Campbell was barred out of
the meet by the four-year rule, and,
much to the disappointment of the
Stanford supporters, Captain McKee
met the same fate, a year's oompetition
against U. S. C. in his first season at
college making him ineligible.
Stanford Agnin Uumicr-up.
Here again Stanford came in for a
silve.r medal. Illinois lead with 45 7-12
points. Chicago placed third. A thun
derstorm during the two-mile event
caused some trouble in conducting the
meet, but that came at the end of the
program. Chace failed to place in the
quarter, as he was boxed and was too
far in the rear at the turn to place.
Bonnett got off to a poor start in the
half-mile, and on the last turn was
roughly jolted. He received third
place to Henderson of lilinois's record
time of 1:55.3. Wilson again came in
for first honors in the mile. He ran a
heady race, allowed a man to pass him
in the last lap, but recovered his lead
in a final spurt, netting him a 15-yard
margin over his nearest opponent. His
time was 4:23 4-5.
Murray won the low hurdles in.25
flat, with Norton fourth. Norton beat
out Murray for second place in the
high sticks, his teammate taking third.
Bedeau again took the shot put, with
a remarkable heave of 44 feet, 3 3-4
inches. Krohn tied for fourth place in
the pole vault. A loss of thirty yards
in the first lap of the relay race
proved to be too large a handicap to
overcome, and our men lost out.
After the meet, the members of the
team scattered to the fou.r winds, re
turning to California by various routes.
