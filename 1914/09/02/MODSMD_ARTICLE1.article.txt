# TRACK MEN ESTABLISH FAME BEYOND ROCKIES
## TEN ATHLETES PROVE VALUE TO STANFORD ON SUMMER TRAVELS. FUN AND WORK ARE COMBINED HOSPITABLE CARE ALONG THE WAY INCREASES GOOD FEELING. 
### 
Ten Stanford athletes, the cream of
the Cardinal track squad, left the
campus on May 24 for the Mid
dle West, en route to the con
ference track meets of the Mississippi
Valley Universities. Coach E. P.
Campbell, '13; Captain P. B. McKee,
'14; Captain-elect E. M. Bonnett, '15;
G. W. Bedeau, '15; H. B. Wolcott, '14;
R. Krohn, '16; J. D. Chace, '16; F. S.
Murray, '16; J. K. Norton, '16, and P.
Wilson, '16, constituted the personnel
of the team, which was accompanied
by H. W. Maloney, in the capacity of
trainer and rub-down fan. Three stu
dents, S. F. Pellas, '13; R. R. Parkin
son, '15, and H. C. Houghton, '16, of
fered their services as a self-appointed
Stanford rooting section.
The travelers spent three hours in
Denver, where they were met by Grad
uate Manager R. W. Wilcox, '13, who
took charge of the financial end of the
trip from that time on. A brother of
J. F. Lauagen, a former Stanford foot
ball coach, met the boys at the station
and treated them to a two-hour spin
in automobiles through the city.. An
hour's workout on the Denver track
followed this diversion. At an altitude
of five thousand feet, the runners ex
perienced extreme difficulty in sav
ing their wind, and it was found es
pecially hard to negotiate the longer
distances in good time.
St. Louis Thoroughly Explored.
On the afternoon of May 27, the
team arrived in St. Louis. Harry L.
Borders, a former Stanford law man,
immediately took charge of their en
tertainment, and throughout their stay
in the metropolis did more to make
life pleasant than any entire alumni
association could have done. The men
were first taken in a Ford parade all
over the city, and later they were con
ducted through the Budweiser brewery
â€”an interesting experience for all of
them. Then the Stanford athletes
"broke into society," making a visit to
all of the best St. Louis country clubs.
The heat oppressed the men at this
stage of the journey, and strongly af
fected their showing on the field. The
local newspapers lauded the athletic
accomplishments of the visitors, and,
to use the words of one of the team,
"It gave us too much to live up to."
The St. Louis track was a very good
one, three laps to the mile, with a 220-
yard panhandle. In the preliminaries,
held on May 29, every man qualified in
his heat, all winning the events except
one.
Chicago Outruns Cardinals.
But the unforseen happened, and
the University of Chicago won the
meet by 10V2 points. McKee, who was
counted on to fatten the total consid-
