# An Important Change
## 
### 
Of more than ordinary interest to
the University community is the per
sonnel of the Faculty Student Affairs
Committee, announced today. This
small group of men exercise a more
potent influence on the trend of af
fairs in our college circle than is given
to any other body. The membership
is of supreme importance to all of us.
Since the establishment of student
control over a year ago, the adminis
tration of student government has not
rested in the faculty committee, as it
had since the founding of the Univer
sity. The machinery of government
was transferred to the Student Coun
cil, but the faculty body was not dis
solved, and remained a passive spec
tator of developments. In the new
committee appointed by President
Branner, Professor F. C. Woodward
takes the chairmanship. It would
seem impossible to suggest another
name that would meet with more uni
versal approval.
At the head of a department enroll
ing a goodly percentage of the upper
class students, Professor Woodward
is in intimate touch with the feeling
of the men working under him, and an
acquaintance with the department
means an insight into the reasons for
his personal popularity. It was under
his direction that the departmental
honor system was developed to its
present efficiency. With such a fac
ulty representative as the silent pard
ne,r of the Student Council, it would
seem time to hoist the fair weather
signals fo.r student control.
Professor Woodward has indicated
that it will be the aim of the commit
tee to encourage the council in its
solution of student government prob
lems, to bend its energies to the at
tainment of the goal of perfected self
government. While the system re
mains in the experimental stage, the
attitude of the committee is the pas
siveness of the competent adviser.
The assistants of Professor Wood
ward on the committee embraces the
teaching staff of four departments,
Professor Folsom, of Geology and
Mining; Professor Townley, of Applied
Mathematics; Professor Wildman, of
the Economics Department; Professor
Huston, of the Law Department. The
wisdom of this selection is evident, for
the men named are prominent in their
section of the Quad; their knowledge
of the students under them is not su
perficial. Favoring breezes and smil
ing skies for the stun dent ship of
state!
