# The 						Last Battle
## 
### 
Tomorrow's tussle on the turf of
Stanford Field, under the watchful eye
of upper-class inspector, is the last
and the decisive battle of the Sopho
more campaign against the first year
men. And it is right and proper that
it should be so. Class rivalry is very
good in its proper place, but there is
a time for all things, and, with the
crisis reached in the annual tie-up, the
conflict should cease and the rivals
meet in solemn peace conclave. There
are big things ahead of us, and the
University will demand all the surplus
energy of the erstwhile enemies.
So let us be sure that, no shrill "sev
enteen!" disturbs the slumbers of
weary non-combatants tomorrow night.
