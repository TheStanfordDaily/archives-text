# An English Barracks Song

### 
Rudyard Kipling was born in Bom
bay, December 30, 1865, and has spent
most of his life in India and England,
where he is now living. Some of the
greatest attributes to his fame are his
well-known war ballads, favorites
among the soldiery of England. The
following poem is taken from his Bar
rack Room Ballads:
Sliillin 9 a Day.
My name is O'Kelly, I've heard the
Revel ly
From Birr to Bareilly, from Leeds to
Lahore,
Hong-Kong and Peshawar,
Lucknow and Etawah,
And fifty more all ending in "pore."
Black Death and his quickness, the
depth and the thickness,
Of sorrow and sickness I've known on
my way,
But I'm old and T'm nervis,
I'm cast from the service,
And all I deserve is a shillin' a day.
Oh, it drives me half crazy to think of
the days I
Went slap for the Ghazi, my sword at
my side,
When we rode Tlell-for-leather
Both squadrons together.
That didn't care whether we lived or
we died.
But it's no use dispairin', my wife
mnst. go charin'.
An' me commissarin' the pay bills to
better,
So if you be'old
Tn the wet and the cold,
By the grand Metropold, won't you
give me a letter?
