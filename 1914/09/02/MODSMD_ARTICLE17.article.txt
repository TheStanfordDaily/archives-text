# Letter From a Self-Made Merchant to His Freshman Son
## 
### 
Dear Pierrepont: Your Ma got back
safe this morning, and she wants me to
be sure and tell you not to over-study,
and I want to tell you not to under
study. What we're really sending you
to Harvard for is to get a little of the
education that is so good and plenty
there. When it's passed around you
don't want to be bashful, but reach
right out and take a big helping every
time, for I want you to get your share.
You'll find that education is about the
only thing lying around loose in this
world, and that it's about the only thing
a fellow can have as much of as he is
willing to haul away. Everything else
is screwed down tight, and the screw
driver lost.
When a boy's had a good mother, he's
got a good conscience, and when he's
; got a good conscience he don't need to
have right and wrong labeled for him.
J Now that your Ma's left, and the apron
| strings are cut, you're naturally run-
I ning up against a new sensation every
| minute, but if you simply use a little
conscience as a tryer, and probe into
a thing that looks sweet and sound on
the skin, to see if you can't fetch up a
sour smell from the bone, you'll be all
right.
George Horace Lorimer.
