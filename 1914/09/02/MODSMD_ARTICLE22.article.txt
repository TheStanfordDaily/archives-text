Washington, Sept. 2. —The war in
Europe has acted as almost a total
eclipse on the proceedings of Congress
and our own affairs of government.
Members themselves have almost for
gotten about proceedings. They have
lost much of their desire for debate,
and are not showing their usual in
terest in politics, in the face of what
they regard the greatest crisis in the
world's history.
The Mexican trouble, the five per
cent advance rate case, the coming
fall campaign ,trust legislation, the
Columbia and Nicaraguan treaties, and
the Federal Reserve Board have been
discarded as subjects for argument,
while members discuss the latest war
bulletins. They gather in the cloak
rooms and corridors to eagerly de
vour information that reaches them.
Sympathies of Congressmen and Sen
ators aro divided between the various
nations, but all of them are refraining
from expressions because of their de
sire to carefully p,reserve the neutrali
ty of the United States.
The prolonged sessions of Congress
broke up the plans of many members
to go abroad this year. Now most of
them are glad that there was legisla
tion to keep them at home. Senator
Lodge, of Massachusetts, and Senator
Fletcher, of Florida, were the only
senators abroad when the trouble be
gan.
