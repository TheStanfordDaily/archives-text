Berlin, (via The Hague)— Sept. 2. —
The German war office claims succeses
in the East and in the West, asserts
that the Germans are steadily over
coming the resistance of France; that
the Russian invasion of Prussia has
been checked; and that the enemy has
sustained enormous losses in killed
and wounded, and lost thousands of
prisoners.
