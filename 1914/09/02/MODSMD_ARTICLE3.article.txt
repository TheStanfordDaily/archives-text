"I feel the need of the University
for the men of the faculty who com
pose its teaching staff, and I appreci
ate my duty toward the University, but
I hear the call of my country in the
hou,r when she needs men, and I am
going to her."
Instructor Robert Eduoard Pellissier,
of the Romanic Language department,
is now in New York awaiting the first
opportunity to secure passage to his
native France, to enlist in her cause
against the threatened Germanic inva
sion. Immediately on his hearing the
first news. Pellissier hastened to the
office of the French Consul in San
Francisco and offered his services. He
is a reservist, but was informed there
that no attempt was being made yet to
return the reserves in the United
States to the war.
Pellissier returned to the Campus to
await further developments, but the
call of France was strong, and he has
embarked on a voyage upon his own
initiative to volunteer in the army of
France. Pellissier has not resigned
from the faculty of the University, but
is absent on leave. It was while talk
ing to a friend, just before his depar
ture, that he uttered the patriotic
phrase quoted above.
Before leaving he attempted to se
cure the aid of the French Consul in
securing a regiment of Frenchmen res
ident in California to accompany him.
Co-operation was refused, however, be
cause the enlistment would savor too
strongly of recruiting on neutral ter
ritory, which is forbidden by Interna
tional law. Pellissier has been at
Stanford since 1911. His place will be
taken by Gabrielle Grojian, of the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania.
