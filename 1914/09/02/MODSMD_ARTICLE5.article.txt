# Thoroughbred Goes the Gasoline Way.
## 
### 
Again horseflesh has given away to
mechanically driven vehicles. Mon
bells, the last of the Stanford thor
oughbred horses, which made the
Stanford stables world-famous a quar
ter of a century ago, was sold during
the summer by Superintendent .T. E.
Hewston and was replaced by a Ford
Roadster. For the last few years M.r.
Hewston has driven Monbells about
the Campus in his work of supervision,
but during the summer months he sold
the horse to Vandervort, Brothers, of
Palo Alto, and purchased the Ford.
None of the famous Stanford racers,
bred by Electioneer, are now on the
Campus.
