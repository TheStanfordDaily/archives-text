Rome, Sept. 3. —Cardinal Delia Chie
sa was elected pope today on the ninth
ballot. He has chosen the name Ben
edictus XV, and will set the date of
his coronation at some later time.
The conclave of cardinals sat be
hind closed doors in the Vatican until
a decision was made. The only indi
cation to the public that the cardinals
were balloting was the issuance of
smoke from the chimney of the Sistine
chapel, whenever the undeciding bal
lots were burned.
Thirty-one Italian and twenty-six
foreign cardinals were present. These
were divided into the conservative and
liberal Italian elements, the Austrians
and Germans throwing their strength
with the latter.
The fact that Cardinal Delia Chiesa
was not mentioned upon the ballots
during the original contest of the con
servatives and liberals seems to indi
cate that there was a deadlock. How
ever, the present selection is a victory
for the conservatives, as Delia Chiesa
is a strong foe of "Modernism."
As Archbishop of Bologne, the suc
cessful candidate, early in the present
year, issued a denunciation of the
tango and other modern dances. Pope
Benedictus XIV, elected in 1740, was
also Archbishop of Bologne.
Berlin, via Rome—Not knowing
that the Pope had been elected, the
German Catholic representatives met
today and adopted resolutions ad
dressed to the Pontifical Conclave at
Rome, justifying Germany's stand in
the present war.
