strategic advantage, in that it will

forces in order to move against places
of great natural strength. All angles
of the line will rest upon strongly for
tified positions, and the French are
taking advantage of the delay to en
trench about these positions more ex
tesively than they have heretofore hen
able to do at any point. Martial law
has beene proclaimed throughout the
entire northern portion of the coun
