# Procrastination

There is a better time for the mak
ing of a college man's resolutions
than New Years Day; that time is to
day. This morning the work of the
scholastic year started, and we ac
cepted or rejected the opportunities
offered us for our benefit. Tomorrow
there will be more opportunities, and
on the next class day still more.
Time is our most precious posses
sion, and it exists for us only in the
actual moment in which we live. An
hour wasted is an hour lost—an ex
travagance that none of us can afford.
With our mind on the past and on the
future the present slips by unmarked,
and the possibility of achievement in
that moment is gone.
The general scholastic average of
all the students, for the semester just
past, is seventy-seven per cent, a
rather low mark as compared to rec
ords of eastern universities.
An hour spent on a good book
would be a distinct profit; an hour
spent in healthful exercise means in
creased mental efficiency.
The greatest factor in poor scholar
ship is procrastination.
Make your resolutions today.
