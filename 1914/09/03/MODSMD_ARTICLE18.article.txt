# Selfishness

### 
It is our boast that Stanford is dem
ocratic, that here no lines of class or
wealth distinction are found. And so
it is that a great many earnest stu
dents come to this University each
year, dependent for their livelihood,
their very existence, on the product
of their own labor while in college. A
large percentage of these men find
employment through the local Y. M.
C. A. and through members of the fac
ulty, whose efforts are based on the
applicant's statement of poverty. The
present financial crisis has brought
an unusual number of these workers
to us this year.
The increase in applications is met
by a paucity of positions, many will be
disappointed. At this crisis it is found
that some of the number are not in ac
tual need of financial assistance,
which does not agree with statements
made in the search fo.r work. Such a
procedure is selfish, unworthy of
Stanford gentlemenâ€”pocket money
for one man might be the straw that
would keep another worthy student in
college.
