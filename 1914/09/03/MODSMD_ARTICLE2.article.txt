# New Soccer League Is Formed With Five Clubs
## H.W. Maloney is President of Organization, Which Will Compete for Spalding Trophy. 
### 
Stanford socceritos will play this
season in a newly-formed soccer
league of five clubs, which includes
the following elevens: Stanford, Uni
versity of California, Olympic Club,
Barbarian Club and Celtic Club. The
organization, for which a season of
ten weeks is scheduled, will be known
as the Exposition Football League.
Trainey H. W. Maloney, of Stanford,
has been elected to the presidency of
the league.
The teams of the organization will
compete for a trophy which has been
offered by Spalding Brothers, of San
Francisco. It will be in the form of a
silver soccer football mounted on a
pedestal. Most of the games this fall
have been arranged away from the
campus, to avoid turning the local ir
terest from the preliminary Rugby
games of the season. Many veterans
will return to line up for both of the
rival universities, but the personnel of
the Cardinal squad will not be defi
nitely known until the first practice
Monday shows how many Stanford
veterans come back to don their soc
cer tons. It is already certain, how
ever, that ex-Captain Pcilas and Half
back Steinhart will be missing from
the line-up.
