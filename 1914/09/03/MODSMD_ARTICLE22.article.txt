# The 						Burial of Sir John Moore
## 
### 
General Sir John Moore commanded
the British troops which were sent to
reinforce the armies of Spain in the
gigantic struggle with Napoleon Bona
parte. Moore's Spanish campaign cul
minated in the famous victory of Co.r
unna, which occurred January 16, 1809.
In this battle Moore was mortally
wounded, and according to a request
made before his death, the body of the
General was laid to rest beneath the
ruins of Corunna.
"The Burial of Sir John Moore," by
Reverend Charles Wolfe, was written
as a memorial to the great hero's
death.
The Burial of Sir John Moore at
Corunna.
Not a drum was heard, not a funeral
note,
As his corse to the rampart we hur
ried;
Not a soldier discharged his farewell
shot
O'er the grave where our hero we
buried.
We buried him darkly at dead of night,
The sods with our bayonets turning;
By the struggling moonbeam's misty
•light,
And the lantern dimly bu.rning.
No useless coffin inclosed his breast,
Nor in sheet nor in shroud we wound
him;
But he lay like a warrior taking his
rest,
With his martial cloak around him.
Few and short were the prayers we
said,
And we spoke not a word of so.rrow;
But we steadfastly gazed on the face
of the dead.
And we bitterly thought of the mor
row.
We thought, as we hollowed his narrow
bed,
And smoothed down his lonely pil
low,
That the foe and the stranger would
tread o'er his head,
And we far away on the billow!
Lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's
gone,
And o'er his cold ashes upbraid
him;
But little he'll reck, if they let him
sleep on
In the grave where a Briton has laid
him.
But half of our heavy task was done,
When the clock tolled the hour for
retiring;
And we heard the distant and random
gun
That the foes were sullenly firing.
Slowly and sadly we laid him down,
From the field of his fame fresh and
gory;
We carved not a line, and we raised
not a stone,
But we left him alone in his glory!
—Charles Wolfo.
