# President Wheeler Gives Freshmen Advice
## 
### 
Dr. Benjamin Ide Wheeler, presi
dent of the University of California,
recommended the careful study of the
following ten commandments to the
freshmen in his annual address:
Leave your automobile at home.
Avoid the terrible modern short
story.
Read solid literature.
Do not procrastinate.
Cultivate the refigious side of your
life.
Take daily exercise.
Make friends, and keep them.
Avoid tobacco and alcohol.
Avoid over-exercising the telephone.
Improve your scholarship.
Quoting from his address in part:
"Avoid too much dancing and other
things that direct nerve energy in the
wrong channels. Real solid matter

instead of the terrible modern short
story; leave your automobile at home..
"Automobiles are elements of super
luxury. Can't you walk and be one
among us? Somehow automobiles
show a discrepancy in purses.
"Cultivate the religious side of your
life. My best advice to you is to con
tinue to belong to the church here
with which you were connected at
home.
"When I visited a sorority one night
I was greatly impressed by the lack
of quietude. There were plenty of tel
ephone calls taking the girls from
their supper table. One girl was called
away three times. Once a week is
enough for that."
