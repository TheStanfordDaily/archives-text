# CHANGES OF DATE MADE FOR FRESHMAN RECEPTIONS
## Welcoming Party Will Be Given Jointly by Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. Next Saturday Evening. 
### 
A change of dates for the freshman
.reception to be given jointly by the
campus organization of the Y. M. C. A.
and the stag party given each year for
the men of the entering class by the
Men's Association was announced last
night after a meeting of the committee
in charge of the affairs.
The two receptions will change
places on the University calendar. The
freshman stag has been postponed to
Friday evening, September 11, instead
of being held on next Saturday even
ing, as was originally announced, and
the joint reception will occupy this
latter date.
Encina club room has been secured
for both evenings.
As usual, the .reception next Satur
day evening will be informal, this
year's program giving promise of
even less formality than in the past.
A group of faculty people have been
asked to be in the reception line to
welcome the first year students, and
upperclassmen in abundance will be
present to introduce the freshmen and
make the evening an enjoyable one.
The affair is under the direction or a
committee headed by F. S. Mur.ray, '16.
An invitation to be present is open to
all members of the University com
munity, and the Freshmen in partic
ular are urged to be present.
