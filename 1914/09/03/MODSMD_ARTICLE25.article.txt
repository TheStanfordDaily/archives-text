## Outbreak of Great War Finds Him in Franceâ€”Watches Conflict's Progress. 
### 
Most recent dispatches from Dr.
David Starr Jordan state that he will
not return to the United States until
November 18.
Dr. Jordan was in France when the
first indications of trouble between
Austria and Servia appeared. He left
Mrs. Jordan and Eric in Prance and
hastened into Servia to watch develop
ments there. Returning to London
about the middle of July he expected to
be in America at the present time, but
has stayed in London longer than was
at first planned, in order to watch the
progress of the war at the best point
of vantage. When his passage, which
he had engaged on a British line steam
er, was cancelled, because the boat was
drafted by the government as a trans
port, Dr. Jordan decided to postpone
sailing. He is comfortably lodged in
London, and will not return to America
until about November 18, when he will
attend a conference of the Carnegie
Foundation in New York.
