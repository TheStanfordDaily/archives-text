United Press Telegraphfc Report. Sept. 3, 1914
New York, Sept. 3.—With the sea
son but a little more than a month to
run, Connie Mack's wonderful ball
club —the Athletes —seem to have the
American league pennant lashed to
their mast. Only the greatest kind of
a miracle could prevent the Mackian
phalanx from annexing another flag.
The Athletics are so far ahead of their
nearest rivals that the fans around the
circuit have lost interest. They are
spending their time now figuring who
will oppose Mack's team in the big
series this fall.
