third place in the Pugsley prize essay
contest on "International Arbitration."
"The Evolutionary Aspects of Inter

Johnson's essay, one of the forty sub

The Pugsley prize is given each year
by Chester DeWitt Pugsley, of Peek

the United States and Canada are

Johnson is the first student from
Stanford University who has ever won
a place in the annual contest. He in
