# PRESSMAN LOSES ESTATES TO MAINTAIN CITIZENSHIP
## Former German Subject Trades Lands in Fatherland for His Naturalization Pap 's. 
### 
No sooner had the European war ut,
come a reality than the Stanford Uni
versity Press was threatened with the
loss of one of its valued pressmen. It
was only fifteen months ago that Her
mann Borsdamm, a native of Minden,
Germany, came to America, after serv
ing seven years as a reservist in the
German army.
Although Borsdamm has received his
first naturalization papers, the regular
term of five years must elapse before
his American citizenship is granted.
However, his application makes it im
possible for him to claim allegiance
under the German flag, even if he
should care to do so during the pres
ent crisis.
He reported to the German consul
in San Francisco at the time of the
first declaration of war, but was im
mediately advised not to leave the
United States. Even if Borsdamm
should succeed in sailing from the
Atlantic coast, he would find it im
possible to reach the German frontier
at present, owing to the necessity of
landing on hostile territory.
In the meantime, on the German side
of the waters, Borsdamm's estates are
being confiscated because he has not
.returned to the war.
