# VETERAN MEN OF MIGHT FORM RUGBY BACKBONE
## Fourteen Members of 1913 Team, Substitutes and Valuable New Students Will Be Source of Supply 
### 
Fourteen of the glorious seventeen
who fought California to a 13-8 vic
tory on Stanford Field last Novem
ber will apply for towel tickets, suits
and a rubdown next Saturday after
noon, when the first Rugby practice
is called. At least nine of the men who
won their German letters as substi
tutes will sign up in answer to the
call at the football rally tomorrow ev
ening.
Only three of last season's point
winners will not be entered in the
1914 squad. They are Bill Darsie,
field captain and breakaway; Stogie
Peck, front ranker, and Jumbo Blase,
the powerful lock who held the scrum
together.
Darsie and Peck were eliminated
from the running last semester, when
it was generally known that neither
would return to college. Hopes for
the late appearance of Blase have
been at ebb and flow until today. A
letter written to Coach Floyd Brown
gives definite assurance that he will
remain in the oil country near Taft.
A glance at the list of last year's
veterans shows the following wearers
of the "S," and the positions for which
they will likely be candidates: In
the backfield, Andrews, full; Urban,
right wing; Carroll, center three
quarters; Reeves, left wing; Lach
mund and Austin, five-eighths; Erb
and Tilton, half. Forwards, Gard,
breakaway; Clover and Watkins, side
rank; Hall and Wines, front rank.
Second string men who will be in
the running and their probable posi
tions are: Patterson, five-eightli3;
Burns, half; Ogden and Knight, break
aways; Pettingill and Sandstrom, lock;
Braden and Dubendorff, side rank;
Soper, front rank. Many of the var
sity substitutes of last year were

strong bidders for place, and will make
a lively struggle either in the berths
assigned above or others.
The enrollment of Jim Wylie as a
freshman student has already been
recorded as a lucky strike. The addi
tion of the New Zealand forward is due
cause for optimism. New candidates
from the halls of preparatory school
fame are many and promising. A pub
lished list at this time would neither
be available or advisable.
Trainer Harry Maloney will have
his staff of assistants and his equip
ment in good shape to take care of the
turf athletes. Better facilities have
been installed in the training house,
which will permit of almost instanta
neous water heating fo.r baths. No
change of consequence from the suc
cessful training methods of the last
two seasons will be made.
All Rugby followers are interested
in proposed changes to scoring rules,
which may be putin force by the Cal
ifornia Rugby Union. The first sug
gestion made by the rules committee
of the Union is that the position of
wing forward be done away with, and
a fourteen-man team used exclusively.
The second change recommended is
that scoring a try shall count for four
points, instead of three, and that a
goal shall be worth one tally, instead
of two. The object of the change will
be to subordinate to a greater extent
the value of field goals, which are
partly a matter of chance, to that of
hard earned touchdowns.
The suggestions will be voted on at
the next meeting of the Union on Sep
tember 10. Tn case the new departure
is made, material changes will result
in coaching work. California and the
Olympic club will try out the fourteen
man team in their first match, sched
uled for Saturday, September 5.
