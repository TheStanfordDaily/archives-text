# ATHLETIC BODIES MAY COOPERATE IN INTERSCHOLASTIC
## Board of Governors Discuss Plans With the Federation Committee to Assist in the 1915 Exposition Track Meet DECISION HANGS IN BALANCE 
### 
The question has arisen whether or
not Stanford will co-operate with the
California Interscholastic Federation
and the University of California in
holding an interscholastic meet in con
nection with the Panama-Pacific Epo
sition. A committee .representing the
State organization met with the Board
of Governors of the Stanford Inter
scholastic Association yesterday after
noon to consider the advisability of
such a plan. The visiting committee
consisted of A. M. Simmons, principal
of Visalia High School; J. C. Temple
ton, secretary of the Federation, and
principal of the Palo Alto High School,
and C. L. Biedenbach, principal of
Berkeley High School.
The California Interscholastic Fed
eration has been organized during the
past six months, and includes prac
tically all the scholars in the State
which participate in athletics, with the
exception of the San Francisco schools.
This organization will control and pro
poses to conduct all athletic contests
between schools in the various parts
of the State, and to unite in an annual
Interscholastic meet once a year.
The Panama-Pacific Exposition Com
mittee has asked the Federation to
conduct the State meet in San Francis
co this year. Beginning with the spring
of 1916, it is proposed to alternate the
meets each year between Northern and
Southern California, holding the meet
at Stanford every four years, and at
California every four years.
Rules of the Federation provide that
the members of the organization will
not be allowed to send athletes to any
Interscholastie meet, other than the
annual one conducted by the State As
sociation. This ruling went into ef
fect after due consideration. Mr. Tem
pleton explained his action on the
grounds that more than one meet was
demoralizing to the athletes and the
best interests of the schools. The
fact remains, however, that no team
competed in both the Stanford and the
California Interscholastic meets last
year that come over a distance of one
hundred miles.
The California Interscholastic Com
mittee desires Stanford to unite with
the University of California in con
ducting the Panama-Pacific meet and
arranging for the details. The Feder
ation will retain entire control of the
meet and management of the Inter
scholastic gathering.
The Stanford Board of Governors
has called a meeting for tomorrow af
ternoon in Dr. Frank Angell's office to
consider the feasibility of a joint un
dertaking, and to discuss every detail
of the plan before giving the Federa
tion a final decision.
