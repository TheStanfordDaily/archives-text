Congress asking for legislation creat

one hundred million dollars will be

past month are maintained.
The president said that the condition
would be dangerous if the present cir

to the strength and sufficiency of the
American treasury, and its ability to
steadily assist and sustain financial
operations and the country's business.
Washington, Sept. 4. —Speaker Un

by President Wilson. A tentative bill
has been prepared, but the details are

that those best able to meet the tax
own automobiles. Some suggest a tax
of a cent a gallon.
