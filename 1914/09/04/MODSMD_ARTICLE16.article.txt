# Matriculation Service
## 
### 
On Sunday morning, the first service
of the scholastic year will be held in
the Memorial Church. As the work of
the chaplain in the first days is pri
marily for the new students, the ser
mon on Sunday will be the Matricula
tion Service, addressed to the class of
1918.
The Matriculation Service should be
to the freshman what the Baccalau
reate is to the graduate, a religious
service that is an integral part of his
college career. Then, if at no other
time, should we take stock of our short
comings, and carefully catalogue them
for future reparation.
The profit of an education is the ac
quired ability to use our mindsâ€”a
brain trained to think. And one pow
er of the brain is the study of our own
weaknesses and shortcomings, with the
possibility of correcting them.
What is more important than a start
in the right direction?
