The Literary Digest describes this a&
"one of the best anti-war poems that
has appeared in many a year. Mr.
G.riffin's energetic diction makes his
splendidly sustained poem a work uf
art, as well as an argument."
Suppose 'twere done!
The lanyard pulled on every shotted
gun;
Into the wheeling death-clutch sent,
Each inillioned armament,
To grapple there
On land, on sea, and under, and in
air!
Suppose at last 'twere come—
Now, while each bourse and shop and
mill is dumb,
And arsenals and dockyards hum —
Now all complete, supreme,
That vast Satanic dream!
Each field were trampled, soaked,
Each stream dyed, choked,
Each leaguered city and blockaded
port
Made famine's sport.
In deathlike trance
Lay industry, finance;
Two thousand years'
Bequest, achievement, savings, disap
pears
In blood and tears
In widowed woe
That slum and palace equal know
In civilization's suicide—
What served thereby, what satisfied?
For justice, freedom, right, what
wrought?
Naught!
Save after the great cataclysm perliap
On the world's shaken map
New lines, more near o.r far,
Binding to king or czar
In festering hate
Some newly vassaled state;
And passion, lust and pride made
satiate,
And just a trace
Of lingering smile on Satan's face!
