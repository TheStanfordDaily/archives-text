United Press Telegraphic Report
Paris, Sept. 4. â€”The French losses at
Amiens, sixty miles north of Paris, on
the allies' left wing, were enormous
yesterday. The officers were unable
to control their men, who insisted up
on charging. The result of their in
subordination was terrible and thou
sands were mowed down. As a conse
quence of the heavy losses, the French
were forced to retreat to Piequigny,
eight miles south. They destroyed the
roads as they retreated; but the Ger
mans are reported to be replacing the
bridges swiftly, and it is believed they
will be within twenty-five miles of the
outer forts of the city of Paris by to
night. It is reported that the French
aviators in this district are numerical
ly superior and are doing the most effi
cient work.
