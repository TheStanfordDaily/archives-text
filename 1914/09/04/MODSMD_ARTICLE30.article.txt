# WORK IS AGAIN STARTED ON STANFORD CLUB-HOUSES
## Disagreement Over Specifications Is Decided Favorably For Stanford by the Arbitration Board 
### 
Work on the Stanford Union has
been held up for over a month pend
ing the arbitration of a disagreement
over the specifications between C. F.
Whittelsey, the architect who designed
the building, and the contractors who
are responsible for its construction.
The three men who formed the Arbi
tration Hoard were David Coleman,
representative of the contractors; W.
L. Huber, Whittelsey's appointee,
and a prominent San Francisco struc
tural engineer, and D. B. Farquharson,
an authority on construction cases.
They made a satisfactory report early
last week, and active operations were
at once commenced.
It is safe to make the statement that
the building will be completed within
sixty days. The structural work is
virtually finished, and the chief parts
yet to be built are the concrete floors
and basement. The exterior is to be
decorated in stucco.
The controversy was over the two
large fireplaces in the main hall of the
Union, and the materials to be used
in the corner towers. These cupolas
were first made partly of wood, but
the specifications call for concrete
throughout. These will have to be re
made, and some time will be consumed
in re-erecting the scaffolding for the
concrete work. The fireplaces in the
main hall, which together form the

most attractive feature of the interior
portion of the building, are to be
twelve feet long and eight feet in
height, constructed of buff Bedford
sandstone, decorated with ornamental
carving.
The plan of the Union is exceptional
in its completeness. Every facility of
fered by a modern clubhouse has been
supplied by the designers. A cosy
library occupies the front of the build
ing at the top of the main stair. This
room will be equipped with writing
desks, latest books and periodicals,
and will open onto a roof garden,
which is to be fitted up to accommo
date loungers.
The immense fireplaces ave the main
attraction of the social hall. Off this
room is a smaller one, designed as a
meeting place for clubs and societies.
A special chamber next to the library
will be convenient for committee gath
erings. A dumb-waiter is handy near
by, making possible the serving of re
freshments or even course dinners at
these affairs.
Below the social hall is a large room
which is to be eventually converted in
to a cafe.
Seven comfortable bedrooms, with
connecting baths, are arranged on the
top story. A small office, near the en
trance, completes the list; a counter
and telephone booth form the equip
ment.

fered by a modern clubhouse has been
supplied by the designers. A cosy
library occupies the front of the build
ing at the top of the main stair. This
room will be equipped with writing
desks, latest books and periodicals,
and will open onto a roof garden,
which is to be fitted up to accommo
date loungers.
The immense fireplaces ave the main
attraction of the social hall. Off this
room is a smaller one, designed as a
meeting place for clubs and societies.
A special chamber next to the library
will be convenient for committee gath
erings. A dumb-waiter is handy near
by, making possible the serving of re
freshments or even course dinners at
these affairs.
Below the social hall is a large room
which is to be eventually converted in
to a cafe.
Seven comfortable bedrooms, with
connecting baths, are arranged on the
top story. A small office, near the en
trance, completes the list; a counter
and telephone booth form the equip
ment.
