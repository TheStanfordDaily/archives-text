# INFORMALITY FEATURED AT FRESHMAN RECEPTION
## Faculty Members Will Form Receiving Line Tomorrow Evening in Encina Clubroom. 
### 
First year students of the University
will be given their first official wel
come to the campus tomorrow even
ing, when the Y. M. C. A. and the Y.
W. C. A. will join in receiving them in
Encitia clubrooms. The affair has
been receiving almost the entire atten
tion of both organizations for the past
few days, and every effort is being ex
tended to make this year's reception
one of moment.
The holding of a Freshman Recep
tion at the opening of the fall semester
is an old custom on the campus, and
it has always been attended by prac
tically the entire body of the first
year men and women. It is the first
opportunity of the year for the fresh
men to become acquainted with their
classmates, and the members of the
faculty, in a social way. To make this
possible a la,rge reception committee
of upperclassmen, representing all the
organizations on the campus will be
on hand to aid in introducing the first
year people.
A large number of faculty members
have been asked to attend, and will be
present in different parts of the club
rooms, in order to meet the freshmen.
The following will be in the receiving
line to welcome them: President and
Mrs. John Casper Branner, Vice-
President and Mrs. John Maxson Still
man, Professor and Mrs. R. L. Green,
Dr. and Mrs. D. Charles Gardner, Miss
Eileen Everett, campus secretary of
the Y. W. C. A., and Secretary E. H.
Lockwood, of the Y. M. C. A.
Informality will hold fo.rth supreme
tomorrow evening, and even the cus
tomary address of welcome will be
omitted. The joint committee in
charge of the reception, under the
leadership of F. S. Murray, '16, has
planned to keep things moving during
the evening without arranging for a
set program.
