# WELCOME EXTENDED TO STANFORD FOLK AT FIRST ASSEMBLY
## Instructors and Students Gather to Receive Cordial Greeting From Dr. Branner and Other Representatives of University ADVICE OFFERED FRESHMEN 
### 
Voicing the cordial feeling of both
Faculty and Student Body, the speak
ers at the annual Welcome Assembly
this morning created a spirit of union
by use of narratives and epigram. A
homelike welcome was extended to
new faculty members, freshmen and
returning students. Real pleasure and
valuable advice were contributed by
President Branner, Mrs. Allen, the
Dean of Women, and Chaplain D.
Charles Gardiner.
As a preface to his greeting to the
recently acquired professors and in
st.ructors.Dr. Branner remarked in a
pleasing, personal way.

You usually want to
know what has hap
pened since you
went away in May. I
have recently re
ceived a letter from
Dr. Jordan. He ex
pected to start home
in August, but on
account of disturb
ance in sailing ar
rangements he has
remained in London.

However, he will return to New York
in October in time to meet with the
Board of Control of the Carnegie
Foundation."
The choice of Mr. Mayo Newhall as
president of the Board of Trustees,
work accomplished during the summer,
and proposed improvement for the fu
ture was briefly sketched.
"The trustees have made plans for
many improvements, which will be un
dertaken as soon as practicable. A
new men's gymnasium will be built
north of Encina Hall, near the power
house, and a woman's gymnasium will
be erected across from the Metallurgy
building. There is also a proposition
to put a new library opposite the His
tory building, which will form part of
the new quadrangle. A new museum
will also be made part of the new
quadrangle to make room for gifts
from Thomas Welton Stanford. A new
postoffice will be built just back of
the present postoffice.
"At the time I acepted the office of
President, it was with the understand
ing that the trustees should cause im
provement and cleaning work to be
done on the campus. They have not
lost sight of the improvements, and the
work will be done as fast as means al
low."
President Branner extended wel
come to the ten new faculty members
who have taken up work at Stanford.
Tn his remarks to the freshmen, the
President said in part:
"1 want to commend to you some in
dividuals who are particularly inter
ested in you—the members of the fac
ulty, and your major professors. Let
me insist that your major professors
are your best friends at every time.
"We are all you.r friends. Become
part of Stanford society, and interest
yourselves in student self-government.
Remember that every force under con
trol is a good thing for man."
Mrs. Allen addressed herself to the
freshmen. Her advice, very attractive
ly sugar-coated, was in part as fol
lows:
"T am here to bid you welcome this
morning, all members of the class of
1918. Specially 1 wish to welcomo
those of you who come from other uni
versities. We realize that you are


Dr. Kmniter.
bringing with yon a richness of expe
rience which will be of value to us.
"That aspirationwhlch made you seek
Stanford, rather than any other univer
sity, is that which makes you kin with
us. The University lias been, up to
this time, in the distance of your ex
perience—its professors, courses,
schools of medicine and law. Now all
is changed, and objects loom up in
great proportion. I want to know what
impresses you most.
"Have fraternities and sororities,
dances, athletics, and gay visions of
social life obscured the University?
Have they blunted your vision? We
urge you, I urge you to reflect on the
ideals that brought you here. Exam
ine the friends with whom you find
yourselves. Ask if they, too, have lost
their vision.
"And so I say, .reflect, recall those
early, distant visions, and determine
to have the best that Stanford affords
you. We have adopted every one of
you as one of us. We trust you with
all we have. It takes every one of us
t ) keep the honor of the Stanford name.
One of us can humble it in disgrace."
Dr. Gardner urged the new students
to accomplish three alms during their
life at Stanford, to strive fo.r friend
ship, work and worship.
"I should be inclined to say 'amen'
to President Rranner's plea to make
friends with your professors. T have
wandered through these cloisters for
sixteen years, and I have learned that
the men and women of the faculty are
dominated by a strange paternal
friendship.
"The name and fame of the Univer
sity have been made by work. There
is no place for loafers at Stanford. A
student who stays here has got to
work.
"Stanford does not breed a smug
brand of young men, or young women
of an emotional religious strain. Stan
ford breeds young men and women of
happy dispositions and clean minds.
"Remember that the University calls
you not only to friendship and work,
but also to worship."
