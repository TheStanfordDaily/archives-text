# WELCOME EXTENDED TO STANFORD FOLK AT FIRST ASSEMBLY
## Instructors and Students Gather to Receive Cordial Greeting From Dr. Branner and Other Representatives of University ADVICE OFFERED FRESHMEN 
### 
Voicing the cordial feeling of both
Faculty and Student Body, the speak
ers at the annual Welcome Assembly
this morning created a spirit of union
by use of narratives and epigram. A
homelike welcome was extended to
new faculty members, freshmen and
returning students. Real pleasure and
valuable advice were contributed by
President Branner, Mrs. Allen, the
Dean of Women, and Chaplain D.
Charles Gardiner.
As a preface to his greeting to the
recently acquired professors and in
st.ructors.Dr. Branner remarked in a
pleasing, personal way.

You usually want to
know what has hap
pened since you
went away in May. I
have recently re
ceived a letter from
Dr. Jordan. He ex
pected to start home
in August, but on
account of disturb
ance in sailing ar
rangements he has
remained in London.

However, he will return to New York
in October in time to meet with the
Board of Control of the Carnegie
Foundation."
The choice of Mr. Mayo Newhall as
president of the Board of Trustees,
work accomplished during the summer,
and proposed improvement for the fu
ture was briefly sketched.
"The trustees have made plans for
many improvements, which will be un
dertaken as soon as practicable. A
new men's gymnasium will be built
north of Encina Hall, near the power
house, and a woman's gymnasium will
be erected across from the Metallurgy
building. There is also a proposition
to put a new library opposite the His
tory building, which will form part of
the new quadrangle. A new museum
will also be made part of the new
quadrangle to make room for gifts
from Thomas Welton Stanford. A new
postoffice will be built just back of
the present postoffice.
"At the time I acepted the office of
President, it was with the understand
ing that the trustees should cause im
provement and cleaning work to be
done on the campus. They have not
lost sight of the improvements, and the
work will be done as fast as means al
low."
President Branner extended wel
come to the ten new faculty members
who have taken up work at Stanford.
Tn his remarks to the freshmen, the
President said in part:
"1 want to commend to you some in
dividuals who are particularly inter
ested in youâ€”the members of the fac
ulty, and your major professors. Let
me insist that your major professors
are your best friends at every time.
"We are all you.r friends. Become
part of Stanford society, and interest
yourselves in student self-government.
Remember that every force under con
trol is a good thing for man."
Mrs. Allen addressed herself to the
freshmen. Her advice, very attractive
ly sugar-coated, was in part as fol
lows:
"T am here to bid you welcome this
morning, all members of the class of
1918. Specially 1 wish to welcomo
those of you who come from other uni
versities. We realize that you are


Dr. Kmniter.
