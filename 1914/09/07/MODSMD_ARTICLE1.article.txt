# HOLLAND'S SITUATION INTIMATELY DESCRIBED
## Record Breaking Mobilization of the Dutch Troops May Explain Country's Freedom From an Immediate Invasion FOOD FAMINE IS AVERTED

All Economic and Industrial
Stress Being Suffered at
Present, Although Country
Is Not Engaged in Cattle
Professor J. A. de Haas, of the De
partment of Economics, who returned
this week from Europe, described the
war situation in Holland, from his per
sonal experience in an interview today.
He was traveling this summer for the
California Immigration Commission,
and was visiting in Holland during the
first mobilization of troops.
The mobilization started on a Fri
day night, when the drummers went
through the country announcing the
news. All men between the ages of
nineteen and thirty-five responded,
forming an army of half a million men.
This tremendous force presented itself
at the barracks Saturday, where the
men were furnished with uniforms and
the necessary supplies. The entire
train service was immediately claimed
for the movement of the army, which
was ready for operations on the fron
tier the following Sunday morning. The
German papers were greatly impressed
with this reco.rd-breaking mobilization
of Holland, which good showing in
this respect was probably instrumental
in saving the country from invasion.
Although Holland was not engaged
in actual strife, the country suffered
all the economic and industrial stress
incident to war times. All the indus
tries were stopped, and the banks
were closed, and there was a decided
lack of workmen. Holland can only
obtain coal through the operation of a
small government mine in the south
ern part of the country. This mine
was unable to supply even the principal
cities with enough to keep their pub
lic service going. The government,
therefore, confiscated all coal to be
found in Holland.
Very limited train schedules were
maintained. Instead of the customary
twenty-minute service between Rot
terdam and Amsterdam, only three
trains are now running daily in any
direction. The electric street cars are
also on half-schedule time. Gas and
electric lights are turned off very ear
ly at night, and only every other one is
now lighted.
Holland is safe, so far as the food
problem is concerned. The closing of
the foreign market is affecting the
domestic market. Food stuffs are
extremely low, through lack of sup
port. The starvation of the individ
ual, therefore, is only threatened
through lack of support. The govern
ment is paying a weekly allowance,
however, to the families of the men
called to war.
Men in the employ of the govern
ment. and the larger companies are re
ceiving three-fourths of their usual
wages. Moreover, although no debts
have actually been canceled, therp a->
unofficial agreement among merchants
not to press their obligations too far.
On the Saturday during the mobiliza
tion, the prices of groceries increased
very rapidly, as a matter of angula
tion, not of necessity. The government
published a list of prices, and made it
obligatory for all merchants not to
exceed the price quotations. Except
ing a few merchants in Rotterdam and
Amsterdam, no one tried to deviate
from the fixed prices. Those who did
