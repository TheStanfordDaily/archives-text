# A 						California Victory
## 
### 
In the first Rugby practice of the fall
semester in 1910, two hundred and six
ty men signed up for practice, and each
class was represented on the field by
at least three full teams. The Stanford
team had not been defeated for five
years, and love of the game soon drew
so many veterans of past days into the
fold that it was admitted that compe
tition for positions was limited to those
who had seeen service. The freshman
fifteen was victorious with a 5-0 score,
and their strength went to swell the
rising tide of confidence in the varsi
ty's prowess. Minor injuries played
their part in the season's scores, but on
the Big Day the team was in good
shape, and was accounted the finest
fifteen in Stanford's history.
The score was 13 to 19, and Califor
nia had beaten us with a better team.
The present season hardly presents
a parallel case, as there are no such
grounds for unthinking trust in our
football squad as those of 1910. Yet
the return of good players, and reli
ance placed in the coach, tends to give
the great body of sideline fans undue
confidence, and to minimize the
strength of California. Nothing could
be more inimical to our success in ath
letics than this, for lassitude and indif
ference follow close on the heels of
over-confidence.
Former Coach Presley struck the
true note of Friday's rally, when he
said that veterans, a good coach and a
captain did not mean that the work
would be done when the time came. It
will take hard work and unquestioning
loyalty from bleacherites and players,
from the first practice to the last rally.
The Big Game is distant a long day's
journey: just now a little less predic
tion and more 'on the ball!'
