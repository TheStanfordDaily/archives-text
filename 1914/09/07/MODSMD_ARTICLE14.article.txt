# Sometime

### 
Miss Irene Hardy, the authoress of
the following poem, was for some time
a member of the faculty of the English
Department at Stanford. She has pub
lished a volume of her verse and, more
recently, her autobiography:
There is a ship named Sometime;
Men dream of it and wait;
One on the shore impatient,
One at the household gate,
Thinking: "If it come not in tin
morn.
Then in the evening it may."
But one I knew, not thinking of ships,
Worked till the close of day,
Lifting his eyes at evening time, â€”
Thert his ship at anchor lay.
