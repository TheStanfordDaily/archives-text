### 
in the entrance examination in
English, which was held for the fresh
men last Saturday, the students were
asked to choose one topic from the fol
lowing group and write 300 words on
the subject chosen:
1. The First Adventure of My Life.
2. How I Cared for the Baby.
3. When the .Joke Was on Me.
4. The Bravest Deed I Ever Saw.
One of the eighteeners evolved this
facetious essay:
The first adventure of my life was
how I cared for the baby. The joke
was on me, and it surely was the
bravest deed I ever saw.
