# RUGBY SEASON OPENED BY ANIMATED RALLY--- BIG SQUAD TAKES FIELD
## 
### 
Out of the speech-making and cheer
ing which drew Stanford men together
in Encina clubroom Friday evening,
came the signing up of 239 candidates
for honors on the turf. That number
sets a new record, being seconded by
210 in both 1911 and 1913.
The rally was a soul-stirring betray
al of feeling, which, under the direct
ing arms of Yell-leader Carey Nixon,
was expressed in the old cheers which
have ushered in former football sea
sons.
All of the speakers, five of them,
struck the old chords of reason and
enthusiasm. Some new advice crept
in. Over-confidence in an ability to
win from California was branded an
evil by former Coach Presley, Trainer
Maloney and others.
Dr. Angell Throws a Stone.
Dr. Frank Angell was the first one
introduced to the throng. His re
marks in part were:
"Since we met here before we have
had a great many good things happen.
We have had a track team go across
the country and win honors, both as
sportsmen and courteous gentlemen.
"And we have had a team of two
men go east to play tennis. I tell
you, you may say what you like, but
Murray and Halin have put Stanford
on the map in the east. Everywhere
they were heralded by the newspapers
as courteous, chivalrous gentlemen
and sportsmen.
"Now, so much for the good things;
let me cast a few stones.
"It happened in the last baseball
game that there was a little jeering.
You cant have good rctfereeing if you
don't support the referee, and I am go
ing to ask that there shall be no base
ball game on the campus in which the
umpire doesn't have the same authori
ty as a refereee. If the umpire says to
turn out in a pea-g.reen necktie, pea
green necktie it must be.
"Now then, we've got a good foot
ball field, good men, Sam, a good cap
tain, and a good coach. Let's make
the best use of them."
Trainer Maloney followed on the
table. He said:
"Gentlemen, I remarked last year in
this very room that it was going to be
a golden year for Stanford athletics.
The banner year was brought about by
a number of conditions. One of thorn
was loyalty, blended with confidence
in those called upon to carry Stan
ford colors.-
"However, we are now face to face
with a new year, and the same spirit
of loyalty, coupled with confidence in
those men who may be called upon to
represent their Alma Mater.
Cnlifornians Hetrny Over-Confidence.
"They had at California, a few days
ago, a football rally, one of the moot
enthusiastic in history. But tney were
over-confident of a victory in 1914.
We must guard against that feeling.
The fact stands out that Berkeley will
have a decided advantage in playing
on her own field."
Former Coach George Presley, who
was the next to address the men, said
in part:
"Fellows, you are fortunate in start
ing out this year with everything that
should be a winning football team. We
have back most of the men who fought
last year against California, and be
sides them a lot of the second-string
men.
"You've got a captain, who, though
rated as a star throughout his expe
rience on the football field, has also
been known as a hard and a consistent

worker. You have a trainer who knows
his work, and who has the best inter
ests of the team in liim. You have a
coach who is capable of turning out a
winning team, and who is eminently
fair.
Presley Taboos "Sure Tiling" Spirit.
"I can't say enough about the evils
of over-confidence. Don't think that
because you have the coach, and the
captain, and the veterans you have,
that they will do the work when the
time comes. That never has been
doue, and never will be done.
"If you allow a feeling of over-con
fidence that they will win, just so sure
they will be beaten. It is awfully
hard to make the fellows believe that
they can lose when they have a string
of veterans, and things look good. But
just remember, that whenever you beat
Berkeley in anything you have the
stiffest proposition you ever ran in
to."
Coach Floyd Brown, who next
mounted the stand said:
"The first practice will be held to
morrow afternoon at 3:30. On week
days it will begin at 4:45, sharp, each
afternoon. The names of the men on
various teams will be posted outside
the training house every day. Don't
come on the field until you know what
your plans are.
Team Will Accommodate Fifteen.
"There will be just fifteen places
open this year on Captain Gard's team.
No one will play against California
this year unless he has proved that he
is a worker, and is willing to listen
to instructions. Unless you have de
termined to work, don't come out.
"In closing, I want to say that un
less the spirit of over-confidence is
killed in the student body, we are go
ing to .run into one of the most dis
graceful defeats this year that a Stan
ford team has ever had."
Captain "Deke" Gard was the last of
the list of speakers. He remarked:
"We have all been warned against
over-confidence. I don't think any of
the old fellows have that feeling. The
men who have been around here
awhile know that when we meet Cal
ifornia in anything we know that we
have been in a scrap.
"A good many of the freshmen say
that they haven't any chance to make
the varsity. Well, maybe they haven't
the first year, but this year there will
be a big share of the older men going
out, and if the sophomores and fresh
men don't show, there won't be any
one to take their places.
The following are the candidates
who signed up for football at the rally
Friday evening:
Preliminary football practice Sat
urday afternoon served the purpose of
giving Coach Brown's 239 charges a
good warming up. The squad was put
through calisthenics, and then divided
for special training under assistant
coaches.
Danny Carroll and John 0. Miller
worked with backfield and forward
divisions on the inner turf. Captain
Gard and Jim Wylie drilled the fresh
men in lineup formations on the aux
iliary field.
During the last half hour of the
workout, Coach Brown directed prac
tice of the various teams in getting
the ball out from the serum and carry
ing it down on the field.
As announced at the Friday rally,
the squad will report on weekdays at
4:4T>, and receive instructions at the
bulletin board outside the training
house.

doue, and never will be done.
"If you allow a feeling of over-con
fidence that they will win, just so sure
they will be beaten. It is awfully
hard to make the fellows believe that
they can lose when they have a string
of veterans, and things look good. But
just remember, that whenever you beat
Berkeley in anything you have the
stiffest proposition you ever ran in
to."
Coach Floyd Brown, who next
mounted the stand said:
"The first practice will be held to
morrow afternoon at 3:30. On week
days it will begin at 4:45, sharp, each
afternoon. The names of the men on
various teams will be posted outside
the training house every day. Don't
come on the field until you know what
your plans are.
Team Will Accommodate Fifteen.
"There will be just fifteen places
open this year on Captain Gard's team.
No one will play against California
this year unless he has proved that he
is a worker, and is willing to listen
to instructions. Unless you have de
termined to work, don't come out.
"In closing, I want to say that un
less the spirit of over-confidence is
killed in the student body, we are go
ing to .run into one of the most dis
graceful defeats this year that a Stan
ford team has ever had."
Captain "Deke" Gard was the last of
the list of speakers. He remarked:
"We have all been warned against
over-confidence. I don't think any of
the old fellows have that feeling. The
men who have been around here
awhile know that when we meet Cal
ifornia in anything we know that we
have been in a scrap.
"A good many of the freshmen say
that they haven't any chance to make
the varsity. Well, maybe they haven't
the first year, but this year there will
be a big share of the older men going
out, and if the sophomores and fresh
men don't show, there won't be any
one to take their places.
The following are the candidates
who signed up for football at the rally
Friday evening:
Preliminary football practice Sat
urday afternoon served the purpose of
giving Coach Brown's 239 charges a
good warming up. The squad was put
through calisthenics, and then divided
for special training under assistant
coaches.
Danny Carroll and John 0. Miller
worked with backfield and forward
divisions on the inner turf. Captain
Gard and Jim Wylie drilled the fresh
men in lineup formations on the aux
iliary field.
During the last half hour of the
workout, Coach Brown directed prac
tice of the various teams in getting
the ball out from the serum and carry
ing it down on the field.
As announced at the Friday rally,
the squad will report on weekdays at
4:4T>, and receive instructions at the
bulletin board outside the training
house.
Out of the speech-making and cheer
ing which drew Stanford men together
in Encina clubroom Friday evening,
came the signing up of 239 candidates
for honors on the turf. That number
sets a new record, being seconded by
210 in both 1911 and 1913.
The rally was a soul-stirring betray
al of feeling, which, under the direct
ing arms of Yell-leader Carey Nixon,
was expressed in the old cheers which
have ushered in former football sea
sons.
All of the speakers, five of them,
struck the old chords of reason and
enthusiasm. Some new advice crept
in. Over-confidence in an ability to
win from California was branded an
evil by former Coach Presley, Trainer
Maloney and others.
Dr. Angell Throws a Stone.
Dr. Frank Angell was the first one
introduced to the throng. His re
marks in part were:
"Since we met here before we have
had a great many good things happen.
We have had a track team go across
the country and win honors, both as
sportsmen and courteous gentlemen.
"And we have had a team of two
men go east to play tennis. I tell
you, you may say what you like, but
Murray and Halin have put Stanford
on the map in the east. Everywhere
they were heralded by the newspapers
as courteous, chivalrous gentlemen
and sportsmen.
"Now, so much for the good things;
let me cast a few stones.
"It happened in the last baseball
game that there was a little jeering.
You cant have good rctfereeing if you
don't support the referee, and I am go
ing to ask that there shall be no base
ball game on the campus in which the
umpire doesn't have the same authori
ty as a refereee. If the umpire says to
turn out in a pea-g.reen necktie, pea
green necktie it must be.
"Now then, we've got a good foot
ball field, good men, Sam, a good cap
tain, and a good coach. Let's make
the best use of them."
Trainer Maloney followed on the
table. He said:
"Gentlemen, I remarked last year in
this very room that it was going to be
a golden year for Stanford athletics.
The banner year was brought about by
a number of conditions. One of thorn
was loyalty, blended with confidence
in those called upon to carry Stan
ford colors.-
"However, we are now face to face
with a new year, and the same spirit
of loyalty, coupled with confidence in
those men who may be called upon to
represent their Alma Mater.
Cnlifornians Hetrny Over-Confidence.
"They had at California, a few days
ago, a football rally, one of the moot
enthusiastic in history. But tney were
over-confident of a victory in 1914.
We must guard against that feeling.
The fact stands out that Berkeley will
have a decided advantage in playing
on her own field."
Former Coach George Presley, who
was the next to address the men, said
in part:
"Fellows, you are fortunate in start
ing out this year with everything that
should be a winning football team. We
have back most of the men who fought
last year against California, and be
sides them a lot of the second-string
men.
"You've got a captain, who, though
rated as a star throughout his expe
rience on the football field, has also
been known as a hard and a consistent

worker. You have a trainer who knows
his work, and who has the best inter
ests of the team in liim. You have a
coach who is capable of turning out a
winning team, and who is eminently
fair.
Presley Taboos "Sure Tiling" Spirit.
"I can't say enough about the evils
of over-confidence. Don't think that
because you have the coach, and the
captain, and the veterans you have,
that they will do the work when the
time comes. That never has been
doue, and never will be done.
"If you allow a feeling of over-con

you, you may say what you like, but
Murray and Halin have put Stanford
on the map in the east. Everywhere
they were heralded by the newspapers
as courteous, chivalrous gentlemen
and sportsmen.
"Now, so much for the good things;
let me cast a few stones.
"It happened in the last baseball
game that there was a little jeering.
You cant have good rctfereeing if you
don't support the referee, and I am go
ing to ask that there shall be no base
ball game on the campus in which the
umpire doesn't have the same authori
ty as a refereee. If the umpire says to
turn out in a pea-g.reen necktie, pea
green necktie it must be.
"Now then, we've got a good foot
ball field, good men, Sam, a good cap
tain, and a good coach. Let's make
the best use of them."
Trainer Maloney followed on the
table. He said:
"Gentlemen, I remarked last year in
this very room that it was going to be
a golden year for Stanford athletics.
The banner year was brought about by
a number of conditions. One of thorn
was loyalty, blended with confidence
in those called upon to carry Stan
ford colors.-
"However, we are now face to face
with a new year, and the same spirit
of loyalty, coupled with confidence in
those men who may be called upon to
represent their Alma Mater.
Cnlifornians Hetrny Over-Confidence.
"They had at California, a few days
ago, a football rally, one of the moot
enthusiastic in history. But tney were
over-confident of a victory in 1914.
We must guard against that feeling.
The fact stands out that Berkeley will
have a decided advantage in playing
on her own field."
Former Coach George Presley, who
was the next to address the men, said
in part:
"Fellows, you are fortunate in start
ing out this year with everything that
should be a winning football team. We
have back most of the men who fought
last year against California, and be
sides them a lot of the second-string
men.
"You've got a captain, who, though
rated as a star throughout his expe
rience on the football field, has also
been known as a hard and a consistent

worker. You have a trainer who knows
his work, and who has the best inter
ests of the team in liim. You have a
coach who is capable of turning out a
winning team, and who is eminently
fair.
Presley Taboos "Sure Tiling" Spirit.
"I can't say enough about the evils
of over-confidence. Don't think that
because you have the coach, and the
captain, and the veterans you have,
that they will do the work when the
time comes. That never has been
doue, and never will be done.
"If you allow a feeling of over-con
fidence that they will win, just so sure
they will be beaten. It is awfully
hard to make the fellows believe that
they can lose when they have a string
of veterans, and things look good. But
just remember, that whenever you beat
Berkeley in anything you have the
stiffest proposition you ever ran in
to."
Coach Floyd Brown, who next
mounted the stand said:
"The first practice will be held to
morrow afternoon at 3:30. On week
days it will begin at 4:45, sharp, each
afternoon. The names of the men on
various teams will be posted outside
the training house every day. Don't
come on the field until you know what
your plans are.
Team Will Accommodate Fifteen.
"There will be just fifteen places
open this year on Captain Gard's team.
No one will play against California
this year unless he has proved that he
is a worker, and is willing to listen
to instructions. Unless you have de
termined to work, don't come out.
"In closing, I want to say that un
less the spirit of over-confidence is
killed in the student body, we are go
ing to .run into one of the most dis
graceful defeats this year that a Stan
ford team has ever had."
Captain "Deke" Gard was the last of
the list of speakers. He remarked:
"We have all been warned against
over-confidence. I don't think any of
the old fellows have that feeling. The
men who have been around here
awhile know that when we meet Cal
ifornia in anything we know that we
have been in a scrap.
"A good many of the freshmen say
that they haven't any chance to make
the varsity. Well, maybe they haven't
the first year, but this year there will
be a big share of the older men going
out, and if the sophomores and fresh
men don't show, there won't be any
one to take their places.
The following are the candidates
who signed up for football at the rally
Friday evening:
Preliminary football practice Sat
urday afternoon served the purpose of
giving Coach Brown's 239 charges a
good warming up. The squad was put
through calisthenics, and then divided
for special training under assistant
coaches.
Danny Carroll and John 0. Miller
worked with backfield and forward
divisions on the inner turf. Captain
Gard and Jim Wylie drilled the fresh
men in lineup formations on the aux
iliary field.
During the last half hour of the
workout, Coach Brown directed prac
tice of the various teams in getting
the ball out from the serum and carry
ing it down on the field.
As announced at the Friday rally,
the squad will report on weekdays at
4:4T>, and receive instructions at the
bulletin board outside the training
house.
Out of the speech-making and cheer
ing which drew Stanford men together
in Encina clubroom Friday evening,
came the signing up of 239 candidates
for honors on the turf. That number
sets a new record, being seconded by
210 in both 1911 and 1913.
The rally was a soul-stirring betray
al of feeling, which, under the direct
ing arms of Yell-leader Carey Nixon,
was expressed in the old cheers which
have ushered in former football sea
sons.
All of the speakers, five of them,
struck the old chords of reason and
enthusiasm. Some new advice crept
in. Over-confidence in an ability to
win from California was branded an
evil by former Coach Presley, Trainer
Maloney and others.
Dr. Angell Throws a Stone.
Dr. Frank Angell was the first one
introduced to the throng. His re
marks in part were:
"Since we met here before we have
had a great many good things happen.
We have had a track team go across
the country and win honors, both as
sportsmen and courteous gentlemen.
"And we have had a team of two
men go east to play tennis. I tell
