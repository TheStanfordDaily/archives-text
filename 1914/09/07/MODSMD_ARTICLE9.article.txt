London, Sept. 7. —Germany is staking
everything on one battle. The first
line of the army has been strengthened
until it has become a solid phalanx one
hundred and fifty miles long. General
von Kluk's army which has heretofore
composed a part of the German right
flank, is moving southeast from Nan
teuil toward the army of General von
-leerinton on the extra left, passing five
Teutonic armies on its march. Gener
al von Heerinton commands the Ger
man armies, which have forced their
way through Alsace. Experts say that
the object of the German leaders is
to annihilate the mobile army of the
allies, in order that the Germans may
divide their forces, leaving one army to
take Paris, and the balance to hurry to
Prussia to oppose the Russians.
The British war office is feverishly
preparing a new army. All retired ser
geants have been recalled to drill re
cruits, as it is believed that England
may be forced to bear the brunt of the
fighting in the west.

Austrian invaders of Russian Poland
have been so hard pressed by their

everything on one battle. The first
line of the army has been strengthened
until it has become a solid phalanx one
hundred and fifty miles long. General
von Kluk's army which has heretofore
composed a part of the German right
flank, is moving southeast from Nan
teuil toward the army of General von
-leerinton on the extra left, passing five
Teutonic armies on its march. Gener
al von Heerinton commands the Ger
man armies, which have forced their
way through Alsace. Experts say that
the object of the German leaders is
to annihilate the mobile army of the
allies, in order that the Germans may
divide their forces, leaving one army to
take Paris, and the balance to hurry to
Prussia to oppose the Russians.
The British war office is feverishly
preparing a new army. All retired ser
geants have been recalled to drill re
cruits, as it is believed that England
may be forced to bear the brunt of the
fighting in the west.
