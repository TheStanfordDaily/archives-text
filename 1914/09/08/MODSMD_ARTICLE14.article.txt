# Sideshows and the Big Tent
## 
### 
Barnum & Bailey's, the biggest and
best, is under canvas in a neighboring
city today, and from noon until mid
night all .roads lead to the Main En
trance. There the sideshow's raucous
spieler entices the unwary and the idle,
and vies with the attractions of the big
tent in sharp pursuit of dime and
nickel.
All of which may remind us that on
the campus we have a circus with big
tent ancj sideshows, too. True to the
best accepted practice, the sideshows'
barkers are in the foreground, and en
trance may be purchased for a farth
ing. Under the big top, in the back
ground, is the main three-ringed at
traction, with its galaxy of stars for
our education and entertainment —
harder to reach and dearer to purchase,
but infinitely more worth while.
Qp page four of this issue, discretely
in the background, we publish the first
compilation of scholarship statistics
issued by the Registrar. Their accuracy
is aboye question, their completeness
a matter of observation.. The Regis
trar is not on uncharted seas in the
publication of a clear index to the
worth of our scholastic endeavor, for
such a thermometer of application is
published annually in a large per
centage of eastern universities. Michi
gan, Kansas, Cornell, Chicago, Colum
bia, all believe in the efficacy of the«
searchlight of public opinion.
We believe that examinations and the
grades given by our instructors are an
index to one particular ability only,
and that perhaps not the most im
portant; but we also believe that they
are the best register we have of our
efforts, since the years of university
life are to train us especially in class
room work. A glance at the page will
answer the question, "Are we getting
what we came fo,r?"
Don't let the spielers get all your
nickels —don't let the sideshows swal
low the circus!
