### Robert \V. Service 
One of the most popular of the mod
ern poets is Robert W. Service. He 's
to the land of the Yukon and the North
what Kipling is to India and 'the Far
East. He wrote here of ideals, un
reachable, always in the "Land of Be
yond." The verse is included in the
volume "Rhymes of a Rolling Stone."
Have you ever heard of the Land of
Beyond,
That dreams at the gates of the day?
Alluring it lies at the skirts of the
skies,
And ever so far away;
Alluring it calls: Aye the yoke galls,
And ye of the trail overfond,
With saddle and pack, by paddle and
track,
Let's go to the Land of Beyond.
Have ever you stood where the silences
brood,
And vast the horizon begin,
At the dawn of the day to behold far
away
The goal you would strive for and
win?
Yet ah! in the night when you gain to
the height,
With the vast pool of heaven star
spawned.
Afar and agleam, like a valley of
dream,
Still mocks you a Land of Beyond.
Thank God there is always a Land of
Beyond.
Fo.r us who are true to the trail;
A vision to seek, a beckoning peak,
A farness that never will fail;
A pride in our soul that mocks at a
goal,
A manhood that irks at a bond,
And try how we will, unattainable
still,
Behold it, our Land of Beyond.
