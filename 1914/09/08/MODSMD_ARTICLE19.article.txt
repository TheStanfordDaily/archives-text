# "Exams" —and After
## 
### 
The reprint appearing below was ex
tracted from the editorial columns of
"The Independent," a weekly journal
devoted for sixty-five years to the "for
ward-looking" movement. The general
sentiment of the paper and the articles
to be found in its pages are charac
terized by a tone of progressiveness
and originality, and the following bit
of comment is marked in its saneness
and lack of stand-pat college tradition.
It is the work of Edwin E. Slosson,
managing and literary editor of "The
Independent," a man in close touch
with college affairs, he having been
a professor in a Western University for
some years. His best-known book,
"Great American Universities," shows
an intimate knowledge and understand
ing of the problems confronting the
American college of today.
Watch for witchery in the full of the
moon; look for the departed at All-
Hallows; but for intellectual orgies
remember June, the month of examin
ations. Since the latter days of May,
allowing four courses to each of the
million and a half American students
in colleges and professional schools,
high schools and academies, there
have been written, signed, sealed and
delivered by desperate students to
more desperate readers some six mil
lion examination papers. A mighty
precipitation of information —and mis
information!
What is to come of it? What, that is
beyond diplomas and degrees, heart
burnings and tutors' fees, and a long
holiday, the happier by contrast with
the times that try men's souls? The
typical college graduate insists al
most to the point of boastfulncss that
he has shaken off nearly every fact
that clung to the fingers of his mind
long enough to be buried in pink or
yellow or green examination books.
It is the custom of nature, by the way,
to deck in bright colors that which is
soon to wither and fall away. But few
of these denuded scholars would deny
that there remained something—a
group of salient facts, or a handful of
unlocalized but healthy ideas. Crys
tallization has taken place, though

meagerly, and there is a genuine and
treasured residue.
There is a challenge here to the
college curriculum that some of the
professional scholars —notably those
of journalism—are beginning to accept.
If out of an abundance of pulpy detail
only the nucleus remains, why not dis
regard the mass of protoplasm and cul
tivate only nuclei in the first place?
So there are high-potential courses in
science and law and economics, in
which all the things that are taught
are meant to be remembered, because
no more is taught that needs to be re
membered.
Will they work? Will the mind ac
cept the big things and hold them with
out faltering? Or is it an ineradicable
habit of the brain to make its own se
lection from the material fed to it?
Perhaps there is an index of memory,
a co-efficient of assimilation, which
governs the cerebral processes so that
all but a certain percentage of incom
ing knowledge, no matter how skill
fully predigested, is always excluded
from permanent preservation. In
which case the eclectic student will be
in the unhappy position of having ig
nored the flesh and blood of his
courses only to find the skeleton
itself minus very desirable members.
The question is one for the psychol
ogists. But in any case the experi
ment is worth watching, and might
well be tested for ultimate effects —
had not a merciful Providence ar
ranged that our "final exams" should
be postponed to a place beyond the
reach of pedagogs.
