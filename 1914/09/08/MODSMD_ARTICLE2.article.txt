## Confident Upperclassmen Purchasing Sombreros Dealt Severe Blow by Palo Alto Merchant. 
### 
Pete McCloskey and Don Davy—you
know them—spent the summer antici
pating the well-fitting sombs that
would become them upon their return
to the campus. The other day Pete
and Don 'breezed' into Wideman's
smacking their lips in pleasant pre
enjoyment. Pete already felt the tight,
real Russian leather sweat band nest
ling snug 'pon his well-made brow.
And Don—well, Don's head was ach
ing from the weight of the stiff hat, and
his purse felt thin from the absence of
the four bucks.
Wideman was busy underselling his
competitors, and hardly noticed Pete
and Don. Don grew impatient—he
wanted that hat while the queening
was still young on the campus, and it
was almost closing time for Wideman.
So he shuffled his feet, thus indicating
a fidgety disposition and a hard cus
tomer. Wideman meant business, so
he walked up to the fellows.
"What can I do for you, gentlemen?"
he asked.
Pete was always good at repartee.
"We're looking for some hats," he an
swered, right off the bat.
Then the other customer got the St.
Vitus dance and started to leave for
other stores. Wideman felt a tinge of
defeat. He yanked a box from behind
the counter, th,rew it at Pete and
yelled, "Just a moment, gentlemen. I
believe you'll find your size in here."
Then Wideman darted down the street
after the fleeing customer.
Pete opened the box.
Senior hats?
Nope, frosh caps.
Pete and Don bought their som
breros in San Jose, where everybody
knows them.
