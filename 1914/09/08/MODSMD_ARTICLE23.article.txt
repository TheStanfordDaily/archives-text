# Correspondents Deny Rumors of Atrocities
## Long-Delayed Wireless From Aix-la-Chapelle Brands Prevalent Reports as Groundless. 
### 
The following message has been re
ceived by the Associated Press by wire
less from Aix-la-Chapelle. The authors
] are well-known newspaper men, who
were originally assigned to Brussels,
and are now marooned at Aix-la-Cha
pelle, unable to reach London. The
telegram was partly mutilated in trans
mission, but the text of it follows:
"In spirit we unite in rendering (sic)
German atrocities groundless, as fur as
we are able to. After spending two
weeks with and accompanying the
troops upward of one hundred miles,
we are unable to report a single in
stance unprovoked. We are also un
able to confirm rumors of mistreat
ment of prisoners or of non-combat
ants with the German columns. This
is true of Louvaine, Brussels, Lune
ville and Nancy, while in Prussian
hands. We visited Chateau Soldre,
Sambre and Beaumont without sus- i
taining a single wanton brutality.
Numerous investigated rumors proved
groundless. Everywhere we have seen
Germans paying for purchases and re
specting property .rights, as well as ac
cording civilians every consideration.
"After the battle of Blass (probably
Barse), a suburb of Namur, we found
Belgian women and children moving
comfortably about. The day after the
Germans had captured the town of
Merbes Chateau, we found one citizen
killed, but we were unable to confirm
lack of provocation. Refugees with
stories of atrocities we.re unable to
supply direct evidence. Belgians in
the Sambre Valley discounted reports
of cruelty in the surrounding coun
tries. The discipline of the German
soldier is excellent as we observed.
To the truth of these statements we
pledge our professional and personal
jvord.
