# Fourteen Vacancies Exist in Depleted Glee Club Ranks
## Tryout Is Called to Add to Membership â€”Christmas Tour of South Planned. 
### 
Upon the completion of the Glee Club
try-outs, which will be held at seven
o'clock tonight in room 84, the club
will practically undergo a reorganiza
tion. Over half of the old members
have not returned to sing with the
club this year, and their places must
be filled by new talent. About four
teeen new members will be chosen
from those who try-out, and one or
two substitutes will be selected for
each part.
The club is to be conducted strictly
on the merit system, and members who
do not give good service or who are
not faithful in their attendance will
lose their places to substitutes.
The management is working toward
week-end trips in the near future to
San Jose, San Mateo and Fremont. The
mid-year trip for this year will prob
ably be in the nature of a trip through
the southern part of the state. The
annual home performance will prob
ably be staged about November fi. The
first regular practice will be held at
seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
Members of the Glee Club will act as
hosts at a dance to be held in the Ar
mory Saturday evening, September 12.
Sixteen dances and two extras compose
the program, which will be divided in
such a way as to give both the pro
gressive dancers and the "old-style
steppers" an opportunity to enjoy
themselves. Hlumcnthal's orchestra
of five pieces has been secured for the
evening.
