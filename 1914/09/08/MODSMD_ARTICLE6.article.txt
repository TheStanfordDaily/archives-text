# HOLBROOK BLINN APPEARS IN ONE-ACT THRILLERS
## Former Stanford Man Devotes Talent to Popularizing Shorter Playsâ€” Now in San Francisco. 
### 
Holbrook Blinn, ex-'9. r >, who has been
presenting a series of one-act thrillers
at the Columbia Theatre in San Fran
cisco during the last month, is an old
Stanford man, having entered with
the pioneer ninety-fivers. He is a na
tive of San Francisco, but is playing
here for the first time in several years
Though Blinn's first appearance on
the stage was at the age of six, and he
is still in the limelight, he did not do
much in the dramatic line while at
college, as organized dramatics had
not yet made their appearance in the
lists of college activities.
Leaving college in the early nineties,
Blinn played in New York for two
years, after that appearing in London
in Beerbohm Tree's troupe. More re
cently he has assumed the leading
roles opposite Mrs. Fiske in her mem
orable production of "Salvation Nell"
and "Becky Sharp."
His latest and most radical venture
was the organization of the Princess
Players in New Yo.rk last year for the
presentation of one-act plays with a
tang. Mr. Blinn considers the one-act
play a worthy vehicle for artistic ef
fort. and in sponsoring that "step
child of the theatrical world" has done
much to popularize it as a dramatic
form. This week he appears in a di
versified and gripping program of his
one-act "shockers" as a farewell to
San Francisco, leaving at the end of
the week for his opening in the Prin
cess Theatre, New York, where his
company will play throughout the
winter.
