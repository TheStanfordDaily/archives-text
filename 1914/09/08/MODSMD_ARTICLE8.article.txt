# FIRST YEAR MEN TO BE ENTERTAINED AT STAG FRIDAY EVENING
## Y. M. C. A. Arranges Program of Speeches on Campus Activities by Prominent Men. 
### 
First year men will be entertained
by the Y. M. C. A. in the annual Fresh
man Stag on Friday evening in
Encina Gymnasium. This place of
meeting has been chosen because it
will give greater opportunity fo.r free
dom of action than Encina clubrooms,
where it was originally planned to
hold the gathering.
A short program is being arranged
in the nature of a series of talks by
men prominent in the various activi
ties on the campus. The intention of
the committee is to assist the fresh
man in his efforts to post himself on
college affairs. The men who will
speak are Trainer Harry Maloney, who
will cover the field of athletics; S. S.
Simonson, '15, editor of the Daily Palo
Alto, who will talk on University pub
lications; W. B. Owens, '14, intercolle
giate debater, who will explain activi
ties, and W. C. Lynch, '15, president of
the Glee Club, who will summarize the
opportunities offered by work on the
musical clubs. These men are all emi
nently able to talk on the subjects as
signed them for Friday evening.
F. S. Murray, '16, to whom credit is
largely due for the success of the
P'reshman Reception last Saturday ev
ening, is chairman of the committee in
charge. The refreshments will be in
the usual nature of stag "feeds," con
sisting of hot dogs, buns and peanuts.
Besides the Freshman Stag on Fri
day evening, given by the Campus Y.
M. C. A., to which all first-year men
