# Stanford Enthusiasts Plan "Debating Interscholastic"
## Majority of Schools Regard Proposal With Favor; Former Leagues Will Still Exist. 
### 
A movement is on foot among the
debating enthusiasts of Stanford to
form the state high schools into a se
ries of debating leagues, each of which
will send a representative or represen
tatives to Stanford at some appointed
time during the year. Competition in
debating will be held among these
men, and the league is expected to
stimulate the interest in high school
debate and oratory, much as the in
terscholastic has encouraged effort in
athletic events.
Furthermore, these new leagues will
not interfere in any way with debat
ing as it may be organized at present
in the high schools, as any existing
league will be utilized in forming this
new organization.

of the preparatory schools of the state
to sound the sentiment among them in
regard to a movement of this kind, and
he has received favorable answers in
nine cases out of ten, so that it. is not
at all improbable that some definite
steps will soon be taken to carry ou f
this idea.
