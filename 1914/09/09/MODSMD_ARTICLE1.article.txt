# FALL TRAINING ENDORSED
## LARGE NUMBER SIGN UP FOR SPRING SPORTS Intercollegiate Cross – Country May Be Introduced—Large Number of Vacancies Exist in Line-Up of Soccer Team 
### 
Two important points were brought
out by the fall track, baseball and
socce,r rally last evening in the Encina
clubrooms, at which time 68 signed up
for track and 55 for baseball. One was
the possibility of holding an intercol
legiate cross-country run with the
University of California, if the event
received sufficient backing from the
student body this semester; the other
was the statement by Coach E. P.
Campbell, '13, that fall training on the
oval is essential to the development oi
a winning team in the spring.
C. H. Nixon, '15, introduced the
speakers and led the yelling of the
enthusiastic crowd assembled.
Coach Campbell headed the list of
speakers. He argued that the only
way to have a successful track team
is to come out in the fall, as waa
proven when 120 men signed up at
this time last year.
"It is the best way to keep in con
dition," Campbell stated, and Is es
pecially valuable for the new men."
The coach then announced that train
ing would commence Friday afternoon.
Trainer Maloney followed with a
well-balanced speech. "Two nights
ago we held a most successful football
rally. We are very fortunate in hav
ing such facilities for play—our ath
letic equipment is not equalled by that
of any other university west of Chica
go. It is up to us to make use of
these facilities. Track and baseball
are out of season, but fall training af
fords excellent opportunity for the
captain to get in close touch with his
men. Try to find the sport for which
you are best fitted. Last year's suc
cess we may attribute to this fall
training. The best way to keep your
head clear is to exercise; so sign up,
and if you do not like the sport, you
can change to one for which you are
better fitted."
Track Captain .E M. Bonnett, '15,
said: "Fall track is designed especial
ly for freshmen. Many men who have
never worn a spike before have devel
oped into point-winners.
"California wishes a cross-country
meet this winter. Whether the plan
is practical or not depends on the in
terest taken by the students them
selves."
T. E. Workman, '14, baseball cap
tain, issued a call for candidates, and
stated that a cup had been offered for
the non-varsity man with the highest
batting average at the conclusion of
the season, as an inducement for new
men to turn out. Practice will start
Monday afternoon, and games will be
played each week.
The last speaker, Captain W. H.
Blodgett, '15, of the soccer eleven ap
pealed to the men to come out for the
team, as but four veterans remain In
college. This, combined with the fact
that the soccer team is to play threo
games a month in the Exposition
League, gives an excellent opportuni
ty for the development of new mate
rial.
