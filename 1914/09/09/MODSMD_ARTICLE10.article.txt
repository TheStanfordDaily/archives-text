# ORIGIN OF BASEBALL MITT EXPLAINED BY "OLD-TIMER"
## University Bookbinder Tells How Spalding Got the Idea to Make Gloves. 
### 
Do you know why baseball players
came to use finger mitts?
No?
Well, there is one man on the cam
pus who knows, and he is "Dad" Phil
lips, the binder for the University
Press. "Dad" claims to have seen the
first finger mitt in action.
Forty or fifty years ago "Dad" was
one of the crack Rockton nine, which
defeated every big team in the state of
Illinois, and then showed the New York
Red Sox what good baseball was. A
number of the men with whom "Dad"
played became national figures since
that time, particularly Al. G. Spald
ing, the millionaire sporting goods
magnate.
Here is the story that "Dad" tells of
the origin of the baseball mitt:
"In one of the games that our Rock
ton squad played we were attracted
by the sound of the ball as it clapped
into the hands of the man on first base
for our opponents. Of course, none of
us wore mitts in those days, and we
never thought that such a thing would
be practical. But this man on first
always caught the ball with a loud
pop, and several of us noticed it,
though we could see nothing unusual
about his hands.
"However, after he caught the ball
each time, he pressed something into
his left hand. After the game Spald
ing and I went over to see what he had
in his hand. After some protest he
showed us. It was nothing but a piece
of bent metal around which he had
sewed some leather. It seemed he had
injured his hand, and did not want to
be kept out of this game, which was for
the championship of the state. So he
had made this mitt.
"T think that was where Spalding
first got his idea for a finger mitt,
though it was many years later before
he began to manufacture them for com
mercial trade."
Hunting ought to be tabooed, accord
ing to "Dad." He says that the team
on which he played originated the
bunting stunt, but he does not think
that it is legitimate baseball. In his
early days a bunt was called a "fair
foul," and was not looked on with
much favor by the fans of the time.
