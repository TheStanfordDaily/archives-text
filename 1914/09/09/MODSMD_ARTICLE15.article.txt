United Press Telegraphic Report
Bordeaux, Sept. 9.—The statement
given out by the war office today says
that the general battle begun Sunday
continues throughout the territory
northeast of Paris, and to the eastern
frontier. French successes are report
ed in the main, and the German attack
on the French right wing has been
weakened for the first time. The
French right is now said to be advanc
ing. The defensive arm of the capital,
now co-operating with the French and
British armies, has engaged the Ger
mans near the .river Ourco, north of
Paris, and has gained a decisive vic
tory, pressing the Teutons back many
miles. Severe fighting is reported in
the vicinity of Sezanne and Victry-le
Francois, sixty miles east of the capi
tal, where the Germans have poured
forward heavy reinforcements onto the
fortifications in order to b.reak the
French lines. The strength of the Ger
man assault was broken today, so that
the French were able to charge, driv
ing the Teutons back onto their re
serve lines with the cold steel. Tt is
thought that the dreaded German of
fense has been effectively broken. The
allies have taken the offensive, and it is
said that General Joffre's strategy is
everywhere successful.
Powerful French Fortress Taken.
Berlin (wireless via Sayville), Sept.
9.—Announcements from the German
army headquarters are to the effect
that Maubeuge, a powerful French
fortress, protecting the advance of the
invaders upon Paris, has been cap
tured by the Germans. Many military
experts claim it is the greatest German
victory of the war, since prisoners
and supplies amounting to four gen
erals, forty thousand troops and four
hundred guns is the estimated French
loss with the surrender of Mauberg.

was seriously wounded in the attack.
"Successes Continue, * Say Qallieni.
Paris, Sept. 9. —Gallieni, military
governor of Paris in an interview,
states: "Our successes continue." The
I iench commander's belief is that the
army now defending Paris can safely
leave the capital and proceed at once
to the aid of the allies' left wing. The
French center is at present holding
firm, while the right and left wings of
the army are gradually driving the
Germans back. The result is that the
German center must eventually retire.
For the first time since the outbreak
of the conflict the German forces are
outnumbered.
