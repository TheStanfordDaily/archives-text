# The
						Little White Book
## 
### 
The very clear and definite exposi
tion of thecontentsof those little white
pamphlets, which President Worthy
afforded us this morning in his talk on
past performance and fundamental
principles, should startle us at once
into a sense of duty in one regard, long
dormant and neglected.
It is a matter of record that in the
past year the conference elections were
given practically no attention by the
students at large, and that on more
than one occasion the lack of interest
indefinitely postponed the choice of
representatives. In other words, it
was an expression of indifference as to
the personnel of what is practically the
most important student organization.
Editorials were written and speeches
made, and still the interest of the av
erage upperclassman in his depart
mental election remained a negligible
quantity.
In the little paper booklet on stu
dent control distributed this morning
for the third or fourth time, is the so
lution. A .reading of that sketch of
student self-government is instructive,
it brings home a consciousness of duty
to the student body. The names of the
qualified electors, to be listed within a
few days, should be carefully checked
â€”on election day the voter will be
capable of intelligent choice.
Don't throw away the little white
book!
