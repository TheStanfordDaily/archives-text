Woodrow Wilson is the western col

tistics taken by Professor Robinson, in
his Western Movement course, are rep
resentative of general collegian views.
One of the questions asked by Pro
fessor Robinson of the members of the
class was."Name a national figure."
Wilson received 22 votes, Roosevelt IS,
Bryan 15, Johnson 4, Jane Adams 4,
Taft 3, and scattering men 18.
In answer to the question, "Name a
representative of the West," Governor
Johnson was the strong leader with 14
votes, while Roosevelt was second with
five ballots. The balance of the votes
were scattered.
"Name a Western issue," was one of
the questions. From the answers, the
Japanese question was named thirteen
times, the tariff question four times,
and conservation was mentioned six
times. The balance of the western is
sues were not so unanimous.
