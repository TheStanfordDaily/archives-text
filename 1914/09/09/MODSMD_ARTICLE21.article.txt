# Sixty-Four Years Old September Ninth, 1914

### 
Long ago a Spanish novelist wrote
of an island of untold wealth "on the
right hand of the Indies." He called
this island, as he gave his imagination
full sway, "California." Later, when
bold Spanish explorers discovered un
chartered land "on the right hand of
the Indies," they named it California
from the novel.
The period of exploration passed,
and there came the dreamy days of
Spanish occupation and Franciscan
Missions. It was an era of luxury, dis
sipation, and illiteracy—soon to pass
away.
In the year 1796 a vessel from Bos
ton, flying the United States flag, an
chored in a California harbor. It was
the first ship of the United States to
enter a port of California. This marked
the beginning of trade with the United
States by sea. Meantime, settlers be
gan to wander ac.ross the continent to
the western coast. They established
their headquarters near the present
site of Sacramento, at Sutter's Fort. By
1840 they nearly equaled the Spanish
in number.
Land squabbles and more petty inci
dents caused a feeling of bitterness be
tween the Spaniards and the Ameri
cans. In 1846 the squabbles grew into
armed conflict. The American set
tlers banded together and set up the
famous Bear Flag Republic. A short
time later Fremont and his troops
joined the settlers, and thenceforth the
flag of the United States succeeded the
Bear Flag.
Soon came the discovery of gold, and
the quick-following stampede of forty
niners from all parts of the world. The
population grew rapidly, and as a re
sult California sought statehood.
A constitutional convention, consist
ing of forty-eight members, met at
Monterey in 1849. The convention drew
up an anti-slavery constitution, and
elected Fremont and Dr. Gwin sena
tors.
In 1850 Senators Gwin and Fremont
presented the constitution of Califor
nia to Congress for approval. The
Southern representatives opposed with
all their strength and bitterness the
admittance of the new free state to the
Union. Nevertheless the opposition
was overcome, and on September 9,
1850. sixty-four years ago today, Cali
fornia became a State.
