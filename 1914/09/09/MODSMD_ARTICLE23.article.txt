French Niiy Germans Art' Prostrated.
Bordeaux, Sept. 9. —The French min
ister, Delcasse, today gave out the fol
lowing statement: "Despite the ef
forts of the German government to
stimulate enthusiasm by the news of
victories, the people of Berlin, and
throughout German, are plunged in
grief. Business is prostrated, and the
cost of living is rising."
Russians lfeport Austriuns in Panic.
Petrograd, Sept. 9.—This city's for
eign office states that the Austrian na
tion is on the verge of an extensive
panic. Anti-war riots have already oc
curred in many places. The Austrian
Slav troops, who are fighting in a half
hearted manner against kindred, are
surrendering everywhere an opportu
nity is afforded them.
Paris, Sept. 9. —The allies a.re now
taking the offensive in the west. The
reserves have been brought up to re
inforce General D'Amade's army and
are co-operating with the British in an
attempt to turn the German right wing.
General von Kluk's Germans are now
outnumbered, and are reported to be
slowly retiring. The French are
fiercely attacking von Bulow in the
center, as they will soon be out-num
bered when that general receives rein
forcements now on the way.
Antwerp, Sept. 9. —The Germans to
day turned their artillery upon the Bel
gians in the vicinity of Saint Armand,
and followed by a general assault.
Masked Belgian guns opened upon
them at close range, mowing them
down, and putting them to .route. A
courier, who arrived today, says that
the Germans have forbidden the Bel
gians in Liege to leave their houses
for three days. It is believed that this
indicates a movement of German troops
eastward.
Dublin, Sept. 9. —"Kaiser Wilhelm
has proven himself Ireland's greatest
friend," said Lord Meath, addressing a
meeting here in behalf of the Prince
of Wale's War Relief Fund. "If any
money can be spared, we should erect
a monument to him here in Dublin. He
has done what no government or par
ty in British history ever succeedcd in
doing, namely, united Irishmen of all
sections, classes and creeds in one
common cause."
Paris, Sept. 9. —German names for
Paris streets are no longer tolerated.
"Rue de Berlin" has become "Rue de
Liege," and the "Avenue d'Alle
magne" is changed to "Avenue Jean
Jaures." A new street, hitherto un
named, is to be called "Rue Alexis Sa
main," in memory of the president of
the Souvenir Francais, who was shot
by the Germans at the beginning of the
war.
London, (by Mail to New York) Sept.
9. —Tn the great arena of the Olympia
that monstrous stadium in Kensington,
where only a few weeks ago the Fred
die Welsh-Willie Ritchie and Gunboat
Smith-George Carpentier prize fights
were held, strange scenes are being
enacted daily now. Some two hun
dred odd men and youths—-.ranging all
the way from 20 to C>0—every after
noon at a set hour go through odd an
tics, such as running up and down the
arena, jumping, rolling on the ground
and other like stunts. These youths
and men are Germans —held prisoners
by the government of England. Their
strange antics are the only exercise
they are allowed to take for a little
while each afternoon. A thin line of
Trish guards, grim and silent, khaki
clad men, stand guard, while the Ger
mans go through their daily exercise.

Bordeaux, Sept. 9. —The French min
ister, Delcasse, today gave out the fol
lowing statement: "Despite the ef
forts of the German government to
stimulate enthusiasm by the news of
victories, the people of Berlin, and
throughout German, are plunged in
grief. Business is prostrated, and the
cost of living is rising."
Russians lfeport Austriuns in Panic.
Petrograd, Sept. 9.—This city's for
eign office states that the Austrian na
tion is on the verge of an extensive
panic. Anti-war riots have already oc
curred in many places. The Austrian
Slav troops, who are fighting in a half
hearted manner against kindred, are
surrendering everywhere an opportu
nity is afforded them.
Paris, Sept. 9. —The allies a.re now
taking the offensive in the west. The
reserves have been brought up to re
inforce General D'Amade's army and
are co-operating with the British in an
attempt to turn the German right wing.
General von Kluk's Germans are now
outnumbered, and are reported to be
slowly retiring. The French are
fiercely attacking von Bulow in the
center, as they will soon be out-num
bered when that general receives rein
forcements now on the way.
Antwerp, Sept. 9. —The Germans to
day turned their artillery upon the Bel
gians in the vicinity of Saint Armand,
and followed by a general assault.
Masked Belgian guns opened upon
them at close range, mowing them
down, and putting them to .route. A
courier, who arrived today, says that
the Germans have forbidden the Bel
gians in Liege to leave their houses
for three days. It is believed that this
indicates a movement of German troops
eastward.
Dublin, Sept. 9. —"Kaiser Wilhelm
has proven himself Ireland's greatest
friend," said Lord Meath, addressing a
meeting here in behalf of the Prince
of Wale's War Relief Fund. "If any
money can be spared, we should erect
a monument to him here in Dublin. He
has done what no government or par
ty in British history ever succeedcd in
doing, namely, united Irishmen of all
sections, classes and creeds in one
common cause."
Paris, Sept. 9. —German names for
Paris streets are no longer tolerated.
"Rue de Berlin" has become "Rue de
Liege," and the "Avenue d'Alle
magne" is changed to "Avenue Jean
Jaures." A new street, hitherto un
named, is to be called "Rue Alexis Sa
main," in memory of the president of
the Souvenir Francais, who was shot
by the Germans at the beginning of the
war.
London, (by Mail to New York) Sept.

that monstrous stadium in Kensington,
where only a few weeks ago the Fred
die Welsh-Willie Ritchie and Gunboat
Smith-George Carpentier prize fights
were held, strange scenes are being
enacted daily now. Some two hun
