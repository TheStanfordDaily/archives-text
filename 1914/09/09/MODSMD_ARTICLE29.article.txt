United Press Telegraphic Report
Paris, Sept. 9.—Reports here state
that within the territory now held by
the allied troops thousands of German
dead and wounded have been left to
their fate. The indication points to a
general German retreat, instead of a
mere stragetic move on the part of the
Germans. In the past two days thou
sands of men have been sacrificed by
the German officers in a vain effort to
break the allied lines. General von
Kluk, in command of the German
flank has made repeated unsuccessful
attacks against the British artillery
situated en masse on the southern
river bank, being finally forced to re
treat with great losses. The British
infantry pursued the retreating Ger
mans , using their bayonets to good
advantage. Of the two armies the
Germans were by far the most tired.
German prisoners state that few of
their troops have averaged more than
three hours sleep daily in the past
three weeks, on account of continu
ous night marches. The Pournier
news agency .reports that the French
cruisers Conde and Descart, co-oper
ating with a British cruiser, sank two
German merchantmen operating in the
Northern Atlantic. The names of the
steamers are not divulged.
