# GRAY JERSIED RUGGERS ROLL UP TOP-HEAVY SCORE
## First Scrimmage on Turf Marked by Pretty Passing and Dribbling. 
### 
Two full Rugby teams in line of ac
tion on the turf yesterday afternoon
brought back the spirit of endeavor
and competition in earnest. The Grays
opposed the black jersied athletes
with considerable success, and con
tinued to roll up tallies until the side
lines ceased to count.
Coach Brown held the remainder of
the squad on the benches to watch the
first scrimmage of the season, and
used frequent changes of men, so that
nearly three full shifts were made.
Beautiful passing was an outstand
ing feature of the contest. Veterans
of the 1913 team in the backfield of
the Grays quickly recovered the art of
hustling the ball along. Numerous
advances were made down a good por
tion of the field, in which dribbling in
the ruck and combination work of the
backs was a joy to behold.
H. R. Stolz, '09, former varsity man
and present physical director, refereed
the match. The play was rushed along
in lively fashion for an hour, with
time taken out only for changes in the
lineups.
The backs of the Black team may
be credited with several instances of
good packing in the defence of their
goal. Accurate goal kicking was re
sponsible for conversion in most at
tempts.
