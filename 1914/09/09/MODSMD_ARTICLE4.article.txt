# CHANCELLOR JORDAN TO BE HOME THIS MONTH
## Plans Are Changed on Account of Improved Transportation Facilities. 
### 
The information that Chancellor
David Starr Jordan will return the
latter part of this month, instead of in
November, as previously announced,
was given out today by Academic Sec
retary G. A. Clark, who is in receipt of
a letter from the chancellor. The lack
of transportation facilities from Eng
land, due to the war, has evidently
been overcome, for Chancellor Jordan
writes that he will sail on September
12, and will reach Montreal about Sep
tember 22. He expects to be in Cali
fornia by the 29th, seven weeks ahead
of his former schedule, which would
not have brought him home until No
vember 18.
