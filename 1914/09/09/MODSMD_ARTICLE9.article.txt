# OLD PROBLEMS ARE FACED
## WORTHY LEADS ASSEMBLY OF STUDENTS "Do" and "Don't" Are Keywords at Morning Assembly. Ideal of Self-Government Is Revealed to the Freshmen 
### 
Men and women of the University
assembled this morning to give first
consideration of the year to problems
of student interest and importance.
The meeting was addressed by A. E.
Worthy, '15, president of the Asso
ciated Students; Miss Marjorie Tis
dale, head of the Women's Conference,
and A. W. Anderson, student adviser.

The introduc
tory sketch of
student self-gov
ernment, and re
view of work
done on the
Stanford Union
was a credit to
Worthy. Funda
mental principles
in the structure
and operation of

government were presented so clearly
as to illumine not only the freshmen,
but also the older students who have
been lax in studying their manuals.
A part of Worthy's remarks follows:
"Stanford University is noted for
many things, and among them, for its
traditions. I am sorry that one oi
them has been broken twice in the last
week. The seniors still fail to occupy
the front seats reserved for them.
"The purpose of this assemblage is
two-fold. We want to extend a further
welcome to the freshmen, and to start
the year with a more complete under
standing of the machinery by which
we are governed."
The speaker continued by naming
the duties of the Executive Commit
tee, the Board of Control, and the Uni
versity Conference, and their person
nel.

Concerning in
tercollegiate re
lations with Cal
ifornia, he stated
that "in Janu
ary, 19 10, an
agreement was
drawn with Cal
ifornia which
dealt with all
sports recorded
at Stanford and

California, the rules to exist five
years. That term will expire on
the twenty-second of next January. It
will be left to either institution to
change or discard the old rules."
Purposes and value of the intercol
legiate football agreement in regu
lating the annual Rugby contest were
briefly mentioned.

The present relations of Stanford
debating teams with rival institutions
was explained as follows:
"In that the old regulations for ora
torical contests between this Universi
ty and California expired last semester,
it will be the duty of a conference to
establish new rules this semester. The
University of Southern California is
very anxious to enter platform com
petition with Stanford and California
in a triangular debate. The application
will be seriously considered, and if ac
cepted will replace the existing tri
state debates between Stanford. Ore
gon and Washington."
Lack of progress on the Stanford
Union building was a topic for expla
nation: "We left the campus last
spring with a hope that our return
would find a complete Union. Disa
greement between the trustees and the
contractor over shoddy materials used
in the towers, and failure to hold to
