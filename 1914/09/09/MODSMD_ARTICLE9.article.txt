# OLD PROBLEMS ARE FACED
## WORTHY LEADS ASSEMBLY OF STUDENTS "Do" and "Don't" Are Keywords at Morning Assembly. Ideal of Self-Government Is Revealed to the Freshmen 
### 
Men and women of the University
assembled this morning to give first
consideration of the year to problems
of student interest and importance.
The meeting was addressed by A. E.
Worthy, '15, president of the Asso
ciated Students; Miss Marjorie Tis
dale, head of the Women's Conference,
and A. W. Anderson, student adviser.

The introduc
tory sketch of
student self-gov
ernment, and re
view of work
done on the
Stanford Union
was a credit to
Worthy. Funda
mental principles
in the structure
and operation of

government were presented so clearly
as to illumine not only the freshmen,
but also the older students who have
been lax in studying their manuals.
A part of Worthy's remarks follows:
"Stanford University is noted for
many things, and among them, for its
traditions. I am sorry that one oi
them has been broken twice in the last
week. The seniors still fail to occupy
the front seats reserved for them.
"The purpose of this assemblage is
two-fold. We want to extend a further
welcome to the freshmen, and to start
the year with a more complete under
standing of the machinery by which
we are governed."
The speaker continued by naming
the duties of the Executive Commit
tee, the Board of Control, and the Uni
versity Conference, and their person
nel.

Concerning in
tercollegiate re
lations with Cal
ifornia, he stated
that "in Janu
ary, 19 10, an
agreement was
drawn with Cal
ifornia which
dealt with all
sports recorded
at Stanford and

California, the rules to exist five
years. That term will expire on
the twenty-second of next January. It
will be left to either institution to
change or discard the old rules."
Purposes and value of the intercol
legiate football agreement in regu
lating the annual Rugby contest were
briefly mentioned.

The present relations of Stanford
debating teams with rival institutions
was explained as follows:
"In that the old regulations for ora
torical contests between this Universi
ty and California expired last semester,
it will be the duty of a conference to
establish new rules this semester. The
University of Southern California is
very anxious to enter platform com
petition with Stanford and California
in a triangular debate. The application
will be seriously considered, and if ac
cepted will replace the existing tri
state debates between Stanford. Ore
gon and Washington."
Lack of progress on the Stanford
Union building was a topic for expla
nation: "We left the campus last
spring with a hope that our return
would find a complete Union. Disa
greement between the trustees and the
contractor over shoddy materials used
in the towers, and failure to hold to

the contract caused a break. The mat
ter was submitted to an arbitration
board, with the result that the trustees
were upheld. Work on the structure
will be finished the last of this month
or the first of next month."
3Iis.s Tisdale Reviews Dances.
Miss Tisdale introduced herself
through the use of humorous anecdotes
before giving a judgment on the much
mooted "dance situation." Her remarks
in brief were:
"The dance situation has been
forced on us by civilization, and in
permitting the new dances on the cam
pus the women of the Conference are
simply leaving to the students the op
tion of accepting them or not. We
come to the University to learn to
choose our line of conduct, not to have
it chosen for us.
"The Glee Club is striking the right
note in announcing for its next dance
a program of both old and new dances.
"Women in athletics are at a disad
vantage in lacking the incentive of
competition with other universities. If
competition is the life of trade, it cer
tainly is the life of athletics, and it
requires a degree of sportsmanship
for the women to uphold year after
year the standard of Stanford athlet
ics."
Student Adviser Addresses Freshmen.
The first of Student Adviser Am
brose's remarks were addressed to the
freshmen. They outlined the duties of
his office, and pitfalls which might
hold up the uncautious student. Par
ticular stress was laid on the necessi
ty of abiding by contracts signed for
room and board on the campus. Soph
omores were warned against hazing of
any kind, including tubbing.
By way of leading to a discussion of
the proposed honor system in exam
inations the speaker mentioned the
discipline used on students found guil
ty of cheating. He continued, address
ing the men:
"One thing of great interest to the
University is the honor system. In
order to acquaint us with its phases,
Chancellor Kirklandof Vanderbilt came
to address us last semester. Later in
the same week the men and women
met separately to obtain a sentiment
on the adoption of an honor system.
The vote showed that 317 of the men
favored a method by which students j
found cheating should not lie reported;
eighteen preferred to make reporting
optional with the individual; some de- 1
eided that a report should be given to j
the student conference in every case.
"Personally I favor the second meth
od named. The late date caused furth-1
er action to he deferred until this se-'
mester, and it will be the duty of the !
Conference to reach a settlement with
the Faculty."
Explanation of the duties of various!
student committees, warning against \
the use of liquor on the campus and
abuse of it elsewhere, and reference t >l

progressive dancing concluded Am
brose's address.
With regard to dancing, he said:
"This year, as well as last, we have th(
dance situation before us. The mei:
have thought that the women should
dispose of the problem, and it is noi
improbable that the Conference wil
think so, too."
Excellent music by the Stanfori
Band entertained the audience during
the first ten minutes of the period.
