# From Five to Six
## 
### 
A simple matter of arithmetic: Ap
proximately two hundred and thirty
men answer Coach Brown's whistle on
the football field each afternoon, one
hundred and sixty-two take physical
training work at the gymnasium from
five to six, one hundred and twenty
are included in the fall track and base
ball rolls. The total is five hundred
and twelve, which is less than half the
enrollment of men in the University.
What are the rest of us doing at that
hour?
Over on Stanford Field the candi
dates for Rugby honors are being put
through their paces by the Coach and
his assistants. An hour of hard play
and of tiring work, with the one object
in viewâ€”the development of clean
mind and sound body, with the selec
tion of a team from the number that
will best represent the university in
one branch of athletics, football. And
in this every member of this college
community has a deep interest.
And how do we show that interest?
Evidently not by vociferous encourage
ment from sidelines and bleachers, for
the fans of the first week's practice are
but a handful, lost in the great loneli
ness of those tiers of seats. Whatever
this slight attendance at practice
scrimmages and daily workouts may
mean, whether it. be overconfidence in
the season's outcome, indifference, o.r
just pure laziness, it is a reflection on
the good spirit of the students and a
deterrent to the efforts of coach and
players.
If you are one of that larger half of
the student body, come join the side
line rooters at the football field.
