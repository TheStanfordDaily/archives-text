Pennsylvania, is now a resident of
California. His has been a varied ca
reer, his occupation running the gamut,
of newspaper work, army service,
preaching, and literary pursuits. The
following verse is characteristic of his
lighter style:
Homely phrase of our Southland
bright—
Keep steady step to the flam of the
drum;
Touch to the left —eyes to the right—
Sing with the soul though the lips be
dumb.
Hard to be good when the wind's in
the east;
Hard to be gay when the heart is
down;
When "they that trouble you are in
creased,"
When you look for a smile and see a
f.rown
But
"Keep sweet and keep movin'."
Hard to be sweet when the throng is
dense,
When elbows jostle and shoulders
crowd
Easy to give and take offense
When the touch is rough and the voice
is loud.
"Keep to the right" in the city's
throng,
"Divide the road" on the broad high
way.
There's one way right when every
thing's wrong,
Easy and fair goes far in a day.
Just
"Keep sweet and keep movin'."
