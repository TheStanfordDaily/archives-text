# MAN OF NARROW ESCAPES WILL VISIT UNIVERSITY
## Jose Escobar, a Mexican Refugee, Will Be Guest of Y.M. C.A. 
### 
A realization of the cruelties of the
revolution in Mexico is brought home
by the experiences of Jose Escobar,
who will be a visitor on the campus
over the week-end.
Escobar, who was physical director
of the Y. M. C. A. at Chihuahua, Mexi
co, has had experiences which serve to
give him a first-hand knowledge of the
atrocities which have been perpetu
ated in the war-infested country. In
the first days of the revolution he w<is
called before an officer, and was told
that trouble was brewing, and that
they might need to call on him to help
control the situation, on account of his
leadership among the young men of
the town. His next call was to the ex
ecution place to be murdered, because
his brothers, owners of a large bank
ing house in Chihuahua, had refused
to give to the resources of the oppos
ing side. Through the aid of a Japan
ese boy he escaped execution, and fled
to the mountains.
His home and a 4000-volume library
we.re burned, and his mother and sis
ter driven into the streets.
In Japanese disguise, with shaven
eyebrows, he slowly made his way to
ward Texas, driving mules as a means
of support. After twenty-three days
he reached the Rio Grande River,
which he swam under cover of dark
ness. Dripping wet and haggard, he
knocked for admission at the Y. M. C.
A. at El Paso, and begged for lodging.
Due to his disguise, he was with re
luctance given even a bench in the lob
by by the night-watchman, who would
not believe him to be other than a Jap
anese mule driver.
Escobar is now making a tour of the
American universities, and is tremend
ously stirring the Latin-American stu
dents by his appeals for a Christian
devotion that shall send them back to
their own people to save the country
by saving its men. He will be a guest
of the local Y. M. C. A. on the campus,
and talk at a number of club and fra
ternity houses.
