### 
Ram's Head will produce its annual
musical fun show October 23 in the
Assembly Hall. The title of this year's
comedy is not yet selected, but the
production will be fully up to the high
standard set by this popular organiza
tion of entertainers.
Burlesque will .reign supreme in the
new offering, which will be modeled
after the popular New York Gaiety
shows. Clever specialties will be in
troduced, and elaborate scenery and
costumes will be used.
The book and lyrics are from the pen
of M. A. Hagen, '15, whose clever
junior opera, "The College Prince," is
fresh in the minds of the Stanford pub
lic. Hagen is editor of the Chapar.ral
this year, a member of English Club,
Hammer and Coffin, Ram's Head, and
was on the 1915 Quad staff. During
the past summer Ram's Head sent Ha
gen on a special expedition to Mexico,
in order that he might glean local col
or for the coming show. The plot is
essentially Mexican in character, and
affords the society a rare opportunity
for picturesque costuming.
The music is contributed by M. Blu
menthal, '16, who made a name for
himself with his compositions in the
1915 junior opera; W. S. Wilson, '13,
librettist for many Ram's Head shows;
M. A. Hagen, '15, and VV. G. Paul, '15.
The leading comedy role will be
played by B. H. Lasky, '12. Lasky's
portrayal of a nondescript tragedian,
"A Humdinger Booth," in the first
Ram's Head show, "Rambling Rame
ses," stamped him as a comedian of
rare gifts. His present part offers
him unlimited opportunities as a fun
maker.
W. B. Forbes, '15, and.1. R. Morgan,
'16, who will also have leading roles,
need no introduction to the Stanford
play-goe.rs. Forbes, who distinguished
himself in previous Ram's Head shows
as an unusually clever female imper
sonator, will have a splendid chance to
show his versatility in a straight man's
role.
The successes of J. R. Morgan, '16,
are too numerous to mention. Morgan
made his debut at Stanford as a
French aristocrat in"The Only Way,"
when lie scored a decided personal bit.
He appeared successfully in several
Glee Club and track shows, and star
red in both "Rambling Rameses" and
"Wooing Wohlma," the two previous
Ram's Head offerings. Morgan's gift
in female impersonations places him
in tbe Julian Eltinge class.
The juvenile lead will be played by
R. Krohn, '16, who proved his worth in
tbe junior opera last spring.
The time for the try-outs for chorus
parts will be announced in the future.

Ram's Head will produce its annual
musical fun show October 23 in the
Assembly Hall. The title of this year's
comedy is not yet selected, but the
production will be fully up to the high
standard set by this popular organiza
tion of entertainers.
Burlesque will .reign supreme in the
new offering, which will be modeled
after the popular New York Gaiety
shows. Clever specialties will be in
troduced, and elaborate scenery and
costumes will be used.
The book and lyrics are from the pen
of M. A. Hagen, '15, whose clever
junior opera, "The College Prince," is
fresh in the minds of the Stanford pub
lic. Hagen is editor of the Chapar.ral
this year, a member of English Club,
Hammer and Coffin, Ram's Head, and
was on the 1915 Quad staff. During
the past summer Ram's Head sent Ha
gen on a special expedition to Mexico,
in order that he might glean local col
or for the coming show. The plot is
essentially Mexican in character, and
affords the society a rare opportunity
for picturesque costuming.
The music is contributed by M. Blu
menthal, '16, who made a name for
himself with his compositions in the
1915 junior opera; W. S. Wilson, '13,
librettist for many Ram's Head shows;
M. A. Hagen, '15, and VV. G. Paul, '15.
The leading comedy role will be
played by B. H. Lasky, '12. Lasky's
portrayal of a nondescript tragedian,
"A Humdinger Booth," in the first
Ram's Head show, "Rambling Rame
ses," stamped him as a comedian of
rare gifts. His present part offers
him unlimited opportunities as a fun
maker.
W. B. Forbes, '15, and.1. R. Morgan,
'16, who will also have leading roles,
need no introduction to the Stanford
play-goe.rs. Forbes, who distinguished
himself in previous Ram's Head shows
as an unusually clever female imper
sonator, will have a splendid chance to
show his versatility in a straight man's
role.
The successes of J. R. Morgan, '16,
are too numerous to mention. Morgan
made his debut at Stanford as a
French aristocrat in"The Only Way,"
when lie scored a decided personal bit.
He appeared successfully in several
Glee Club and track shows, and star
red in both "Rambling Rameses" and
"Wooing Wohlma," the two previous
Ram's Head offerings. Morgan's gift
in female impersonations places him
in tbe Julian Eltinge class.
The juvenile lead will be played by
R. Krohn, '16, who proved his worth in
tbe junior opera last spring.
The time for the try-outs for chorus
parts will be announced in the future.
