# CALIFORNIA RUGBY UNION TO MAKE RULES TONIGHT
## Chief Business Will Be Action on Committee's Report Concerning Fourteen-Man Team. 
### 
The California Rugby Union meets
tonight in San Francisco, to accept or
reject the report of the rules commit
tee, composed of George J. Presley,
James Schacffer and James Lanagan.
The main feature of the committee's
report are to adopt rules which would
compel members to use fourteen men
on a team. Another important proposi
tion is to allow four points for a try
and one for a conversion, instead of
three for a try and two for a kick.
Judging from an unofficial caucus, it
is unlikely that the fourteen-man prop
osition will be accepted. It is said the
Olympic Club, Titans and Barbarians
do not look favorably on the change,
and it has not been accepted at Stan
ford.
Coach Floyd Brown made the fol
lowing statement today: "The four
teen-man team will not be accepted at
Stanford. Under no conditions will
we agree to play with a curtailed team.
The .reason is simple;â€”to change the
line-up would spoil the game of Rug
by, as it was originally Intended." This
dispels any possibility of a fourteen
man combination wearing the Car
dinal. The decision of the Rugby
Union tonight will not affect condi
tions under which the annual Califor
nia-Stanford game will be played.
The general attitude of the Rugby
world is that it is poor policy for the
teams playing Rugby in California to
form rules which would or might en
tail a severance with the rest of the
Rugby public.
