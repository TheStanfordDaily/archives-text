# ALLIES STILL ADVANCING WAR FEVER IS ANALYZED
## DR. MARTIN PICTURES GERMAN MOBILIZATION. Psychologist Attributes War to Constant Preparation—Teuton Women Praised. 
### 
A viewpoint of the present titanic
European struggle, which is complete
ly original to the great majority of
students interested in the war, is pre
sented here in an interview with Pro
fessor Lillien J. Martin, Ph. D„ of the
Psychology Department, who trav
eled through the countries of Germany,
Belgium and England during the
period of mobilization and early fight
ing. For the past twenty years Dr.
Martin has spent much time in making
psychological investigations in Eu
rope, and particularly in Germany.
Her description of actual war scenes
and psychological discussions follow:
German students at the universities
were the first to display patriotic
fervor or desire for war. On the
Thursday before the actual outbreak
of hostilities, they were everywhere in
evidence during the evening, singing
national airs &nd holding energetic

discussions about the coming conflict.
At Munich, Bonn and all the other uni
versities, war was the one thought
among the students. The young gen
eration, as a whole, all over the Em
pire were filled with a keen patriotic
zeal. The older and wiser heads were
not far behind in their desire for dec
laration of hostilities. Their belief is
that a conflict with Russia is neces
sary and unavoidable, if the interests
of civilization are to be safeguarded.
On the following morning, Friday,
although sentiment in general desired
war. there was really no special alarm
felt in Europe as to an immediate dec
laration of hostilities. An illustration
of this is shown by the fact that the
American consul at Southampton, Eng
land, allowed his daughters to depart
for Paris on a week's visit. On the
afternoon of the next day, however, an
order for mobilization was posted
throughout Germany. Even before the
order, all the bridges along the Rhine
were placed under strict surveillance.
At the city of Ronn, for instance, the
entire bridge was dotted with soldiers.
No wagons or automobiles were al
lowed to pass over unless accompanied
by an official, for fear that the bridge
might be blown up with dynamite.
Down below on the river, boats could
be seen everywhere patrolling the
course. Away up on the high build
ings soldiers were stationed with spe
cial guns to guard against any danger
that, might arise from aeroplanes.
These bridges a.re of the utmost im
portance, since their preservation was
essential if the Hermans were going
to maintain easy access to France.
