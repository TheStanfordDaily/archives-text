# ALLIES STILL ADVANCING WAR FEVER IS ANALYZED
## DR. MARTIN PICTURES GERMAN MOBILIZATION. Psychologist Attributes War to Constant Preparation—Teuton Women Praised. 
### 
A viewpoint of the present titanic
European struggle, which is complete
ly original to the great majority of
students interested in the war, is pre
sented here in an interview with Pro
fessor Lillien J. Martin, Ph. D„ of the
Psychology Department, who trav
eled through the countries of Germany,
Belgium and England during the
period of mobilization and early fight
ing. For the past twenty years Dr.
Martin has spent much time in making
psychological investigations in Eu
rope, and particularly in Germany.
Her description of actual war scenes
and psychological discussions follow:
German students at the universities
were the first to display patriotic
fervor or desire for war. On the
Thursday before the actual outbreak
of hostilities, they were everywhere in
evidence during the evening, singing
national airs &nd holding energetic

discussions about the coming conflict.
At Munich, Bonn and all the other uni
versities, war was the one thought
among the students. The young gen
eration, as a whole, all over the Em
pire were filled with a keen patriotic
zeal. The older and wiser heads were
not far behind in their desire for dec
laration of hostilities. Their belief is
that a conflict with Russia is neces
sary and unavoidable, if the interests
of civilization are to be safeguarded.
On the following morning, Friday,
although sentiment in general desired
war. there was really no special alarm
felt in Europe as to an immediate dec
laration of hostilities. An illustration
of this is shown by the fact that the
American consul at Southampton, Eng
land, allowed his daughters to depart
for Paris on a week's visit. On the
afternoon of the next day, however, an
order for mobilization was posted
throughout Germany. Even before the
order, all the bridges along the Rhine
were placed under strict surveillance.
At the city of Ronn, for instance, the
entire bridge was dotted with soldiers.
No wagons or automobiles were al
lowed to pass over unless accompanied
by an official, for fear that the bridge
might be blown up with dynamite.
Down below on the river, boats could
be seen everywhere patrolling the
course. Away up on the high build
ings soldiers were stationed with spe
cial guns to guard against any danger
that, might arise from aeroplanes.
These bridges a.re of the utmost im
portance, since their preservation was
essential if the Hermans were going
to maintain easy access to France.


Dr. Lillien Jane Martin.
The wonderful organization of the
German army and the celerity of mobil
ization appears an amazing feat to us
Americans. There seemed to be so lit
tle confusion or hasty commands. Re
fore the actual order of mobilization,
every man eligible for duty in the Ger
man army had received a private notice
through the mail from the army office,
notifying him where his command
would meet in case mobilization should
occur at any time. When bulletins
were posted throughout the empire on
Saturday afternoon that mobilization
was ordered, every man had his noti
fication where to enroll, and that was
all that was necessary. The letter re
ceived from the war department, upon
presentation to the proper railroad
conductor, allowed the recruit free
passage to his destination.
Not only the men enjoy this won
derful organization, but also the wo
men, who are heart and soul in the
cause of their country. Hundreds of
German women have been training
themselves to fill the position of
nurses in times of war or emergency,
and furthermore have organized relief
societies to care for wounded soldiers.
At the railroad stations there are
hospitals, under the supervision of
these volunteer nurses. The Red Cross
Society of Ame.rica has been requested
to send aid to the nations of Europe,
but no such urgent appeal has as yet
been heard from Germany as from
the other countries. The credit be
longs to the women of that nation.
The spirit of the German people,
taken as a body, was marvelous to be
hold. The customary weeping and
wailing that is expected in such times
of stress, was entirely lacking. The
shedding of tears by mothers about to
be deserted was practically never seen.
A dogged determination that meant
st.rictly business was alone exhibited.
With fortitude and brave spirit the
people felt they had a serious duty to
perform, which, at all cost, must be
properly attended to.
When walking up and down the
streets, and coming in contact with
hundreds of people, one did not run
across citizens who censured the war.
Even the Socialists believed the con
flict to be a necessary one, and placed
their entire support with the coming
struggle.
On Saturday morning in Cologne, tlv>
scene was one of no mo.re than ordin
ary activity, except for the fact thai
crowds of people wore eagerly watch
ing the bulletin boards for news of a
possible declaration of war. The sol
diers up in the spires of great cathe
drals caused considerable comment,
but, aside from these facts, a normal
atmosphere seemed to reign. At three
o'clock in the afternoon of that same
day, when announcements of a declar
ation of hostilities we.re posted all
about the town, the life of the inhabi
tants seemed changed as if by magic.

Every one was moving, going some
where. Trunks and baggage were in
evidence in all parts of the city. On
questioning a passerby about the cause
of all this commotion, the reply was
given that every one was returning to
his home, since in a few hours the
trains would be closed to all other traf
fic except that of transporting troops.
When comparing England and Ger
many from a close military standpoint,
we discover that that intimate per
sonal participation in the war is not
noticeable in Great Britain as it is in
Germany. This condition is well ex
plained by a quotation from one of the
leading London papers: "We pay peo
ple to fight for us."
When questioned as to what was the
cause of the present European war,
Doctor Martin made the following
unique, yet logical answer:
For the past twenty years I have
been going to Germany, and each time
what impressed me was the growing
sentiment that a general European wa.r
was imminent. That is to say, there
are certain psychological factors that
must be considered in answering a
question about the cause of the war.
With the continual repetition of the
words that there is going to be a war,
the people of Europe had come to be
lieve that a war was inevitable, and
therefore they did not offer the opposi
tion to the struggle that otherwise
they would have offered. Again they
have been building up in these years a
certain ideal, an ideal that they must
arm themselves against a near future
attack. Now then, having that ideal
in mind, and knowing themselves to
be prepared for war, when a slight in
sult was offered the nation, the logical
conclusion of all the preparation was
an immediate declaration of war.
In this connection I can offer what 1
have personally brought home for my
own use from this experience. I shall
never vote for any one who believes in
arming this nation. We have gotten
along well without such an armament,
and it is a psychological axiom that
we are going to end in a conflict with
some other nation if we should con
stantly prepare ourselves for war.
When asked about the outcome of
the war, Professor Martin said:
"You ask what country I hope will
triumph. I hope no conquering will
be necessary. I hope some form of
compromise will be finally effected.
But if any country is to conquer the
others, I hope it will be the one that is
farthest advanced, and that is Ger
many.
"Germany stands first in science—
discovery and invention, and it has
dealt with its social problems, such
as the labor agitation, the movement
towards Socialism, the animosities be
tween Catholics and Protestants with
less friction than any other nation in
Europe."
