I nitcd Press Telegraphic Report
Paris, Sept. 11.—Germans are heav
ily reinforcing the center in a supreme
effort to break through the French
center in order to deal with the right
and left wings separately. The indica
tions are that the critical part of the
allies' line is from Vitry, one hundred
miles east of Paris, thence northeast
ward through Genicourt to Verdun,
fifty miles northeast of Vitry. It is ru
mored that a British force may be
sent to aid the French center. If the
Germans break through the center the
menace to France will be grave. The
left of the allied line continues to
sweep the enemy northward.
If the French can crush the German
center and the British movement on
the left continues successful, the Ger
mans will be cleared from all Western
France.
Note—Should the Germans succeed
in cutting through the French center,
while the relative positions of the
armies are such as they are at pres
ent, they will be able to surround the
entire French right wing, which now
occupies Alsace and Lorraine, cut it
off from supplies, concentrate supe
rior forces upon it and crush it. This
whole portion of the French army
would thereby be lost to the allies, and
the Teutons could thereafter concen
trate their entire forces upon the bal
ance of the allied army.
Paris, Sept. 11.—Gallieni, military
governor of Paris, announced today
that the offensive movement of the
allies in the north continues unchecked
and that the enemy is still retreating.
He says that the battle in the center
continues indecisive.
Austrian's Want, Peace.
Vienna (via Rome), Sept. 11. —The
feeling against the Germans is in
creasing, and the demand for peace is
almost universal. The government is
daily criticised because it has been
compelled to meet Russia alone, and
has been crushed, while Germany is
concentrating her attention to the in
vasion of France. It is believed the
losses of this country are much greater
than has been admitted. The people
confidently expect that their attitude
will force the government to yield,
and unless peace is soon concluded, it
it will be difficult for the government
to avoid trouble here and throughout
the empire.
Wounded Overflow Austrian Hospitals.
Vienna, Sept. 11.—It is admitted that
the railroads are unable to transport
the wounded. All hospitals and halls
are filled, and private houses are now
being utilized. The presence at the
front of Archduke Karl Franz and
Archduke Francis Frederick indicates
that the government realizes that an
other Russian victory may force peace
immediately.
T.riesta, Sept. 11.—An Austrian tor
pedo boat today struck a mine off Fa
sana, south of here, and sank, but
most of the crew were saved. The Aus
trian fleet is cruising the Austrian
coast, but has met no enemy. It finds
that there is much suffering because
of the food shortage and the discon
tinuance of business.

are filled, and private houses are now
being utilized. The presence at the
front of Archduke Karl Franz and
Archduke Francis Frederick indicates
that the government realizes that an
other Russian victory may force peace
immediately.
T.riesta, Sept. 11.—An Austrian tor
pedo boat today struck a mine off Fa
sana, south of here, and sank, but
most of the crew were saved. The Aus
trian fleet is cruising the Austrian
coast, but has met no enemy. It finds
that there is much suffering because
of the food shortage and the discon
tinuance of business.
I nitcd Press Telegraphic Report
Paris, Sept. 11.—Germans are heav
ily reinforcing the center in a supreme
effort to break through the French
center in order to deal with the right
and left wings separately. The indica
tions are that the critical part of the
allies' line is from Vitry, one hundred
miles east of Paris, thence northeast
ward through Genicourt to Verdun,
fifty miles northeast of Vitry. It is ru
mored that a British force may be
sent to aid the French center. If the
Germans break through the center the
menace to France will be grave. The
left of the allied line continues to
sweep the enemy northward.
If the French can crush the German
center and the British movement on
the left continues successful, the Ger
mans will be cleared from all Western
France.
Note—Should the Germans succeed
in cutting through the French center,
while the relative positions of the
armies are such as they are at pres
ent, they will be able to surround the
entire French right wing, which now
occupies Alsace and Lorraine, cut it
off from supplies, concentrate supe
rior forces upon it and crush it. This
whole portion of the French army
would thereby be lost to the allies, and
the Teutons could thereafter concen
trate their entire forces upon the bal
ance of the allied army.
Paris, Sept. 11.—Gallieni, military
governor of Paris, announced today
that the offensive movement of the
allies in the north continues unchecked
and that the enemy is still retreating.
He says that the battle in the center
continues indecisive.
Austrian's Want, Peace.
Vienna (via Rome), Sept. 11. —The
feeling against the Germans is in
creasing, and the demand for peace is
almost universal. The government is
daily criticised because it has been
compelled to meet Russia alone, and
has been crushed, while Germany is
concentrating her attention to the in
vasion of France. It is believed the
losses of this country are much greater
than has been admitted. The people
confidently expect that their attitude
will force the government to yield,
and unless peace is soon concluded, it
it will be difficult for the government
to avoid trouble here and throughout
the empire.
Wounded Overflow Austrian Hospitals.
Vienna, Sept. 11.—It is admitted that
the railroads are unable to transport
the wounded. All hospitals and halls
are filled, and private houses are now
being utilized. The presence at the
