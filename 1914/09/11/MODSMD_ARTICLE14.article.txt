# The
						Good Old Cob

The corncob pipe is neglected; the
cigarette is still supreme! Truly a
tribute to the culture of the Freshmen,
that the rugged, self-reliant class who
already have discarded the homely
pipe and now affect the more elegant
'tailor-made.'
But somewhere, way down deep,
there is a current that is to affect the
placid surface of the Freshman's
course to man's estate.
Last semester, following a general
discussion of the evils of the no-pipe
rule for first year men, the upper
classes, the University Conference,
Skull and Snakes, and other bodies of
influence formally decried the time
honored custom of boosting the ciga
rette trust, and resolved that the corn
cob pipe was to be substituted as the
mode of smoking permitted to Fresh
men. This applied only to the court
ing of Lady Nicotine on the campus,
and was not necessarily to affect per
sonal habits.
But we are forgetful, and the corn
cob pipe is rarely seen with the little
grey cap. The way seems smooth
butâ€”better reef your sails. Freshmen,
and hie for Cob Haven. There's a
squall blowing up!
