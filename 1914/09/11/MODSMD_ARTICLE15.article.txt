A writer of prose sketches and nov
els, as well as poetry, Miss Alice Cary
is .remembered for her contributions to
literature in collaboration with her sis
ter, Miss Phoebe Cary. The following
verse is characteristic of her deep,
thoughtful style:
[ hold that Christian grace abounds,
Where charity is seen; that when
We climb to heaven, 'tis on the rounds
Of love of men.
I hold all else, named piety,
A selfish scheme, a vain pretence;
Where center is not, can there be
Circumstance?
This I moreover hold and dare
Affirm where'er my rhyme may go:
Whatever things be sweet or fair,
Love makes them so.
Whether it be the sickle's rush
Through wheat fields, or the fall of
showers,
Or by some cabin door a bush
Of rugged flowers.
'Tis not the wide phylactery,
Nor stubborn fast, nor stated
prayers,
That makes us saints; we judge the
tree
By what it bears.
And when a man can live apart
From works on theologic trust,
T know the blood about his heart
Is dry as dust.
