# LIBRARY ANNOUNCES NEW SYSTEM FOR HOUR BOOKS
## 
### 
Stanford Library wishes to announce
that in the future all books may bp
signed up for two-hour periods during
the afternoon and evening, as follows:
12:15 to 2:oft; 2:oft to 4:00; 4:00 to
fi: 00; 6:00 to 8:00; 8: Oft to 9:50.
In this way students will be given
more opportunity to finish their work

at one reading. Assignments in many
departments have been lengthened this
semester, and some references are
found too long to be completed in one
hour; as a result, readings are left
unfinished, and the loan desk is over
crowded at the beginning of each hour.
The new method will facilitate circu
lation and aid the library assistants.
