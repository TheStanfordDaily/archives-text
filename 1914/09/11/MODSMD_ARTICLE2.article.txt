# FOURTEEN-MAN RULE IS KILLED BY UNION
## Change in Manner of Scoring Tries and Conversions Votedâ€”Offside Play Made Difficult. 
### 
Fifteen men will continue to be a
Rugby team, according to the vote of
the California Rugby Union in San
Francisco last evening. The proposi
tion of the rules committee to cut the
scrum to seven men and abolish a
possible wing forward received poor
support.
Stanford football leaders favor con
tinuance of the fifteen-man team, and
there seems little cause to fear future
controversy. The Stanford-California
football agreement provides that fif
teen players constitute a team, and in
the light of the Union's action a sug
gestion by either university to change
the clause at the time of the Big Game
is improbable.
Two changes in rules were voted at
the suggestion of the rules committee,
and are expected to .receive welcome
by all Rugby players on the coast. The
first change provides that a try sh-ill
be valued at four points, and a goal
conversion at one point, to replace the
old proposition of three and two. The
new way of counting is eminently more
fair.
The second new rule draws an im
aginary line between the opposing
scrums, which cannot be crossed by
players of either side until the ball
has been heeled out to the backs. Off
side play will be checked in great de
gree, to the benefit of the game. Gener
al approval of both rules has already
been expressed.
