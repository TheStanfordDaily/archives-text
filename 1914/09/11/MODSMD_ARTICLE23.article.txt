The fall baseball season, under the
direction of Captain Tom Workman,
will open next Monday afternoon, when
four strong teams of the Peanut
League will officially commence on
their pennant struggle, scheduled over
a period of five weeks' play. Diamond
activities bid fair to surpass by far in
both interest and quality the baseball
exhibited in any previous semester.

Captain Work
man's plan for the
autumn season is
entirely original
to Stanford base
ball followers, fol
lowing to a great
degree the style
of the profession
al leagues. Four
clubs, one under
the leadership of
"Pete" McClos
ke y, nicknamed
the "Pups," an
other captained by
"Babe" Dent, sur
named the "Colts"
a third team, led
by Captain Work
man, styled the

Birds," and a fourth nine called the
"Federals," under the direction of
Ray Maple, should offer a hotly con
tested race for the pennant.
The schedule calls for four games a
week, to be played on each Monday,
Tuesday, Thursday and Friday after
noons. The games will commence

promptly at 4:45. Each of the four
clubs will play the other a series of
nine contests. The season's play in
cludes twenty-seven games, and will
close at the end of the fifth week, on
October 29.
In the opening game next Monday,
the Federals will engage the Pups on
the Auxiliary diamond, while the Colts
and Birds will contest on the Faculty
field. Owing to the new coat of grass
on the outfield of the varsity diamond,
it will not be used for fall practice.
In the list of the team line-ups be
low, Captain Workman has placed an
average of fourteen men on each nine,
thereby giving every one of the fifty
six candidates for baseball honors am
ple opportunity for practice.
