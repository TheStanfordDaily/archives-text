A grass fire broke out at 9:15 this
morning in the arboretum, near the
state highway, between the car tracks
running to the University and Embar
cadero Road. No harm was done by
the flames. Farm superintendent J. E.

and that of the Hoard of Trustees by
the way the students responded to the
call to extinguish the conflagration.
