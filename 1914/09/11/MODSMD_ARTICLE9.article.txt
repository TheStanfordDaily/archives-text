# INTERCOLLEGIATE RULES COMMITTEE WILL CONFER
## 
### 
The football rules committees of
Stanford and California will confer at
the Palace Hotel tomorrow evening to
adopt regulations which will govern
the 1914 intercollegiate Rugby game.
George J. Presley, Rugby Captain
Frank J. Gard and President Worthy
will represent Stanford. The Presi
dent of the Associated Students of the
University of California, Victor Doyle,
Football Captain Joseph McKim and
one other, yet to be announced, will
represent California.
The intercollegiate committee will be
composed of three persons, to be ap
pointed by President Worthy. As the
agreement committee will not meet un
til January twenty-second, at which
time the present five-year agreement
expires, this conference is still some
what removed. President Worthy
states the only possible change to be
desired, from the Stanford point of
view, will be a proposed change in the
time of day that the intercollegiate
crew race is conducted. It is said that
the present hour works a hardship on
the men of both crews. This idea is
tentative, however.
