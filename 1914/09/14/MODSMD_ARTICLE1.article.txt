"We had a wonderful time at the col
leges of the country," he said today to
a representative of the Daily Palo Alto,
just before he boarded the train for
San Francisco. "I did everything imag
inable, from eating dinner on board a
submarine to being a guest on a trip
in an aeroplane. However, I missed
the aeroplane trip by about two min
utes, though the aviator waited for
some time fo.r me.
"On the trip I used up seventy-five
tennis racquets. I call it seventy-five
because I took twenty-five racquets
and had to have all of them restrung
three times. I played ninety-six
matches In eighty days. I was beaten
five times, but I couldn't help it. We
had to play on lawns all the time there
and it took us some time to get onto
the soft courts.
Princeton Similar to Stanford.
"The college I liked best of all was
Princeton. It was more like Stanford
than any other place we visited. There
all of the fellows wore old clothes, and
they had a spirit that was great. It is
also a thoroughly democratic place.
"Among the Middle Western colleges.
I liked Colorado State University best.
However, there the only unfortunate
incident of the trip occurred. They
got up a rally for us, and both Herb
and I had to make speeches. That was
serious for us, but we got through it
all right.
Missourians Chiefly Queeners.
"Missouri College gave us a fine
time, but we were surprised at the
place. The fellows don't do anything
there but queen. There are more girls
than men there, and the latter forget
all about studies, and queen all the
time. They are always with the wo
men.
"Yale and Harvard disappointed us.
The men there are too stuck up. They
are always careful whom they speak
to. I had to ask ten fellows who the
track captain was before I could find
out. No one seems to be on the boat
at Yale and Harvard. However, they
gave us a mighty good time.
Stanford Alumni Splendid Hosts.
"The finest thing about the whole
trip was that in every town we found
a Stanford man to welcome us at the
depot. It did us good to see such
spirit among the alumni. In New York
I spent an evening with Tom Dunham
and another with Billy Erb, the old
Stanford varsity man. While there 1
took dinner with the Vanderbilts.
"While at Harvard I rooted for Cali
fornia for the first time in my life. Tt
was at the Intercollegiate A. A. A. A.
track meet, where the Berkeley men
were competing. Stanford didn't have
a team there, and so I had to root for
California."

were competing. Stanford didn't have
a team there, and so I had to root for
California."
Lynn Murray, who, with Captain
Herb Hahn, "put Stanford on the map"
in tennis this summer, left Palo Alto
this morning for San Francisco, where
he intends to enter a business house.
Murray says that he had the finest va
cation ever in his trip through the east
and is now ready to go to work. Every
where on his eastern trip he was treat
ed with the greatest courtesy, and en
joyed the finest kind of entertainment.

"We had a wonderful time at the col
leges of the country," he said today to
a representative of the Daily Palo Alto,
just before he boarded the train for
San Francisco. "I did everything imag
inable, from eating dinner on board a
submarine to being a guest on a trip
in an aeroplane. However, I missed
the aeroplane trip by about two min
utes, though the aviator waited for
some time fo.r me.
"On the trip I used up seventy-five
tennis racquets. I call it seventy-five
because I took twenty-five racquets
and had to have all of them restrung
three times. I played ninety-six
matches In eighty days. I was beaten
five times, but I couldn't help it. We
had to play on lawns all the time there
and it took us some time to get onto
the soft courts.
Princeton Similar to Stanford.
"The college I liked best of all was
Princeton. It was more like Stanford
than any other place we visited. There
all of the fellows wore old clothes, and
they had a spirit that was great. It is
also a thoroughly democratic place.
"Among the Middle Western colleges.
I liked Colorado State University best.
However, there the only unfortunate
incident of the trip occurred. They
got up a rally for us, and both Herb
and I had to make speeches. That was
serious for us, but we got through it
all right.
Missourians Chiefly Queeners.
"Missouri College gave us a fine
time, but we were surprised at the
place. The fellows don't do anything
there but queen. There are more girls
than men there, and the latter forget
all about studies, and queen all the
time. They are always with the wo
men.
"Yale and Harvard disappointed us.
The men there are too stuck up. They
are always careful whom they speak
to. I had to ask ten fellows who the
track captain was before I could find
out. No one seems to be on the boat
at Yale and Harvard. However, they
gave us a mighty good time.
Stanford Alumni Splendid Hosts.
"The finest thing about the whole
trip was that in every town we found
a Stanford man to welcome us at the
depot. It did us good to see such
spirit among the alumni. In New York
I spent an evening with Tom Dunham
and another with Billy Erb, the old
Stanford varsity man. While there 1
took dinner with the Vanderbilts.
"While at Harvard I rooted for Cali
fornia for the first time in my life. Tt
was at the Intercollegiate A. A. A. A.
track meet, where the Berkeley men
were competing. Stanford didn't have
a team there, and so I had to root for
