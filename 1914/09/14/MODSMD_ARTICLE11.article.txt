United Press Telegraphic Report
Germany Claims Retreat Is Strategy.
Berlin, (via Sayville), Sept. 14.—The
German war office declares that the
Paris and London reports of German
defeats in France are based upon a
misconception of the situation. The
dispatch states that favorable news is
being received from France, but that it.
is unpublishable for strategic reasons.
General Hinderberg reports the cap
ture of a hundred and fifty guns, and
from twenty to thirty thousand prison
ers. Prince Earnest, of Saxony, when
fatally wounded, handed a soldier a
paper expressing the wish that he be
buried, not in the ducal mausoleum,
but in a grave with the comrades who
died with him. He died with the words
upon his lips, "I salute my emperor."
Germans Pressed at Point of Bayonets.
Paris, Sept. 14.—At three o'clock this
afternoon, the war office at Bordeaux
telegraphed the statement that the Ger
man retreat continues everywhere. The
dispatch stated that the Germans pre
pared a line of defense northeast of
Paris, and attempted to make a stand
in order to reform their badly demor
alized army, but that the overwhelm
ing strength of the French forced their
retirement.
Germans Are Going Home.
Paris, Sept. 14. —The Germans today
evacuated Amiens, sixty miles north
of here, on the left wing of the allies,
and are now retreating in the direction
of Personne and St. Quentin, to the
eastward, which shows that they are
withdrawing their troops not merely
out of France, but directly toward Ger
many. The retreat of the enemy from
Nancy, near the border of Alsace, to
ward the Vosges mountains is general,
and all French territory in this vicinity
has been evacuated.
Fast Campaign Overtaxes Teutons.
London, Sept. 14.—Overconfidence
in their ability to march through
France, and overwork in their stren
uous campaign of the past month, cost
the Teutons the battle of Ilarne, whicli
has been raging fifty miles east of
Paris for the last few days, says the
war office, in a review of the general
operations of the war.
German Line in Chaos.
Bordeaux, Sept. 14.—Minister Mil
lerand said today at noon that he does
not expect the Germans to again suc
ceed in establishing an effective line of
resistance in France. He said, in ad
dition, that the defeat of the Germans
along the Marne, northeast of Paris,
was complete, and that the least part
of the danger of the Germans is that
of being cut off. a danger generally
considered serious. The torrential
rains have turned the roads into quag
mires, and only the German guns
drawn by traction engines can be
saved. The others are mired immov
ably, and have been abandoned to the
French.
Advancing Servians Spread Terror.
Nish, Sept. 14.—The Servian attack
ing army is making its advance
through Pettedwardein. Hungary,
about forty miles from the border, on
to Budapest. The Russian army staff
is co-operating with their movements.
Austrian troops in Serajevo, located
in the southermost part of Austria,
are panic stricken, owing to the rapid
advance of the enemv.
