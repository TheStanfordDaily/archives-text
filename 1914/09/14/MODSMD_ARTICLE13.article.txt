# The 						Interclass Games
## 
### 
Class rivalry is again in the field;
this time the struggle for supremacy is
through selected fifteens which are to
match team work and individual ability
on the Rugby turf. No healthier out
let for surplus enthusiasm could be
found, and the effort that is expended
with those class numerals as a goal is
strength for the varsity squad in the
months of training. For tonight's set
to Coach Brown named the best foot
ball talent in the lower classes, and
the lucky players gave their best to
the game. On Thursday afternoon the
Seniors and Juniors will match for the
privilege of playing in the finals.
Were you at the football field this af
ternoon? What are the rest of us do
ing these fine afternoons, while the two
hundred and thirty are pounding the
turf on Stanford Field? The interclass
games are a reality once more, and ac
tual contests are doing their share to
develop a perfect whole. You are of
fered nearly an hour's excitement for a
five-minute walk to the prettiest plot
of grass in the countryâ€”isn't it worth
while?
To a large proportion of the men
who sign ui) at the football rally, the
class games are the one hope of win
ning some material recognition of their
striving. To these second and third
line players, the struggle of class
against class takes second place only
to the Big Game, and in this series ev
ery ounce of their power is put into the
play. Appreciation is due them, and
there is no encouragement quite so
telling as well-filled bleachers.
