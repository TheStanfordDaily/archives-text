# California Verse For "America"
## 
### 
In an address, delivered in 1906, Dr.
Henry Van Dyke is quoted as saying:
"When I look at California and then
think of the lines of our National
Hymn,
'I love thy rocks and rills,
Thy woods and templed hills'
I am constrained to think that 'Ameri
ca' was for New England. For Cali
fornia you must write another verso:
"I love thy inland seas,
Thy capes and giant trees
Thy rolling plains;
Thy canons wild and deep,
Thy prairies* boundless sweep,
Thy fertile mains;
Thy domes, thy silver strands,
Thy Golden Gate that stands
Affront the West;
Thy sweet and chrystal air,
Thy sunlight eve.rywhere,
O, Land beyond compare
I love thee best."
