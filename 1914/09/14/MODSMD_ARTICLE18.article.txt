# Critics of the Colleges

### 
An article in the September num
ber of the Atlantic Monthly, on "Crit
ics of the Colleges," is attracting at
tention among educators. The author
is Henry Smith Pritchett, a writer of
note on educational subjects. Dr.
Pritchett is a graduate of Pritchett
College, and received his Ph. D. in
Munich in 1904. He is a noted astron
omer and a writer of scientific papers,
and is president of the Carnegie Foun
dation for the Advancement of Teach
ing.
Among other things:
The serious critics of the college fall
into three groups: the college teach
ers, students of the social order, and
the business men. To state the mat
ter in a different way, the college is
being criticized today from three points
of view: that of the college teacher,
that of the social reformer, and that
of the business man.
The college, as it is conducted to
day, provides intellectual offerings of
great variety and of high intrinsic
value, but fails to create an atmos
phere in which these opportunities ap
peal to students. Scholarly enthusi
asm among undergraduates is absent
save in rare cases, and scholarly at
tainment commands no reward and
little attention.
The criticisms directed against the
college f.rom the point of view of the
social reformer run along two lines.
One has to do with the ideal of de
mocracy and the other with that of re
ligion.
There is a strong tendency in the
college, say these critics to forget
that ideal of democracy which we call
American, to segregate rich and poor
into different groups, to increase class
distinctions in our society rathe,r than
to diminish them, to make the groups
of students who attend the colleges
rather more conscious of class than
less so.
The third criticism comes from the
business world, and is directed both
against the college as an organization
and against the quality of the product
which the college turns out. As an
organization, say the business men,
the college is expensive, uncritical of
its own processes, and grows contin
ually by accretion. Notwithstanding
the very great expenditures of the col
lege, the men it turns out are on the
whole ill-trained, are able to rlo noth
ing well, as a class are not fond of
work, and need in most cases a thor
ough breaking-in and additional dis
cipline before they are available for
serious occupations.—Critics of Col
leges.

Among other things:
The serious critics of the college fall
into three groups: the college teach
ers, students of the social order, and
the business men. To state the mat
ter in a different way, the college is
being criticized today from three points
of view: that of the college teacher,
that of the social reformer, and that
of the business man.
The college, as it is conducted to
day, provides intellectual offerings of
great variety and of high intrinsic
value, but fails to create an atmos
phere in which these opportunities ap
peal to students. Scholarly enthusi
asm among undergraduates is absent
save in rare cases, and scholarly at
tainment commands no reward and
little attention.
The criticisms directed against the
college f.rom the point of view of the
social reformer run along two lines.
One has to do with the ideal of de
mocracy and the other with that of re
ligion.
There is a strong tendency in the
college, say these critics to forget
that ideal of democracy which we call
American, to segregate rich and poor
into different groups, to increase class
distinctions in our society rathe,r than
to diminish them, to make the groups
of students who attend the colleges
rather more conscious of class than
less so.
The third criticism comes from the
business world, and is directed both
against the college as an organization
and against the quality of the product
which the college turns out. As an
organization, say the business men,
the college is expensive, uncritical of
its own processes, and grows contin
ually by accretion. Notwithstanding
the very great expenditures of the col
lege, the men it turns out are on the
whole ill-trained, are able to rlo noth
ing well, as a class are not fond of
work, and need in most cases a thor
ough breaking-in and additional dis
cipline before they are available for
serious occupations.—Critics of Col
leges.
