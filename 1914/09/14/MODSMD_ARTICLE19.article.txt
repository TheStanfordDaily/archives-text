London, Sept. 14. —The war baroau
announced at 5:15 this afternoon that
the German Crown Prince's army, in
tiie vicinity of Verdun, was driven
across the Aire river, as a result of
tiie French assault. The prince was
compelled to move his headquarters
from Saint Henchould, twenty-three
miles south of Ve.rdun, to Montfauson,
fifteen miles northwest of Verdun. Of
ficials say that the German attack in
the vicinity of Verdun must cease soon
or the Crown Prince's forces will lie in
danger of being cut off and captured.
The indications are that the Germans
are making a hasty retreat toward
Stenaygap. If the allies could reach
this place before the Germans the army
of the prince would be cut off from Ger
many and from its supplies.
French Are Enthusiastic.
Washington, Sept. 14. —A cablegram
from Bordeaux to the French embassy
here says: "Joffre tells the govern
ment that our victory is becoming more
and more complete and brilliant. The
enemy is in full retreat. It is said
that the Austrians are retiring along
their entire front."
German Resistance Gains Ardor.
Paris, Sept. 14.—Indications from
the front point to a general attempt
on the part of the German army staff
to reorganize their forces, which are
.retreating slowly all along the battle
line. Northern France and Belgium
have been practically evacuated in the
last two days by the enemy, who are
concentrating en masse on the eastern
French border. The fighting now rag
ing between the allied and Teuton
troops is hourly becoming more severe,
as the German resistance is gradually
gaining more strength.
Troops of Czar and Kaiser in Deadlock
Petrograd, Sept. 14.—An overwhelm
ing German attack upon the Russian
left wing in Russian Poland, has
forced them to give way, but positions
equally as strong have been taken. On
