# WELL-STOCKED NURSERY IS MART FOR GREENERY
## 
### 
J. E. Hewston, farm superintendent,
calls the attention of campus dwellers
to the Stanford nursery, which is sit
uated behind the museum building.
Hewston says that the nursery was
not appreciated last year by students
of the University, many of whom were
not aware that the place was there.
Anyone can get potted flowers or
bouquets by seeing Hewston at the busi
ness office. This year the gardeners
in charge of the nursery will arrange
to have all kinds of flowers, shrubs
and ferns growing in season for the
benefit of the people on the campus.
"The nursery is run by the Univer
sity," said Ilewston today, "and stu
dents should make use of it."
