# PRESIDENT WILSON CALLS CITIZENS AND OFFICIALS TO DUTY
## 
### 
President Wilson's letter, in which
he refuses to make an active campaign
in the next presidential contest, is
more than a partisan document—it is
a call to duty to every public official
and to every citizen of the United
States. Paragraphs extracted from the
letter are printed below:
"In view of the unlooked-for interna
tional situation, our duty has taken on
an unexpected aspect. Every patriotic
man ought to 'stay on his job,' until
the crisis is passed, and ought to stay
where his job can best be done. We
must do what is necessary and forego
whatever is necessary to keep us in
close and active concert, in order to re
lieve in every possible way the stress
and strain put upon our people during
the continuance of the extraordinary
conditions. My job, I now know, can
be done best only if I devote my whole
thought and attention to it, and think
of nothing but the duties of the hour.
"America is greater than any party.
America cannot be properly served by
any man who for a moment measures
his interest against her advantages.
The time has come for great things.
These are days big for destiny for the
United States as for the other nations
of the world. A little wisdom, a little
courage, a little self-forgetful devotion
may, under God, turn that destiny this
way or that. Great hearts, great na
tures will .respond. Even little men will
rejoice to be stimulated and guided and
set an heroic example. Parties will faro
well enough without nursing if the
men who make them up and the men
who lead them forget themselves to
serve a cause and set a great people
forward on the path of liberty and
peace."
