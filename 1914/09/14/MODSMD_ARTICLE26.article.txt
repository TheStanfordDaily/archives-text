# TOURNEY FOR REGENT CUP TO START SEPTEMBER 19
## 
### 
The annual tennis tournament for
the Regent handicap trophy will be
held on the Encina courts September
19. Entries for the contest can lie
made with IT. L. Hahn, '16, captain of
the tennis team; L. Sloss, '15, or K.
B. Uhls, '16. Hahn and Sloss can be
seen at Encina Hall and Uhls at the
Sigma Chi House. Entries must be in
by the Friday before the tournament.
The Regent tourney will be the first
of the yea.r. Starting this season
racquet-wielders entering the contest
will play for a new cup. The former
trophy offered by The Regent was cap
tured last year by R. L. Murray, '13,
who won it three successive times. The
new Regent cup must be won four
times before it becomes the permanent
property of any player.
Tennis prospects for Stanford during
the coming year loom brighter than at
any time in the history of the Univer
sity, according to H. L. Hahn, '16, cap
tain of the Cardinal squad. From the
old team that represented Stanford
last year but one man is missing, F. S.
Pratt, '13, who graduated last year.
This leaves L. Sloss, '15; J. S. Hutch
inson, '16, K. B. Uhls, '16, and Hahn as
a nucleus of veterans for the 1915 team.
