### 
Reverend Caleb S. Dutton. of the First
Unitarian Church of San Francisco, in
his morning sermon Sunday morning,
gave three principles'on which to base
Christian life, in six short words:
Know thyself; control thyself; deny
thyself. The first means knowledge,
the second chivalry, and the third ser
vice. Upon these three maxims, taken,
respectively f.rom the Greek, Socrates,
the Roman, Marcus Aurelius, and the
Christian, Jesus Christ, depend the
mastery of every need which comes to
human experience.
Miss Agnes Maloney sang "O, Di
vine Redeemer," by Gounod. Bennett's
"God Is a Spirit," was rendered by the
choir.
