# CARDINAL TEAMS APPLY WHITEWASH TO VISITORS
## Varsity and Freshmen Attain High Scores in First Matchesâ€”New Rules Used in Game 
### 
High score victories for the Car
dinal's varsity and freshmen fifteen
attended the first turf battles of the
season, fought on Stanford Field Sat
urday afternoon. The story in figures
reveals a 17-zero score in the Varsity-
Olympic match, and a whitewash win
of sixty points for the babies in their
romp with the boys from Mission High.
Both Stanford squads displayed a de
gree of team unity that was gratifying
to behold in the first formal lineup of
1911. A mainstay of veterans in the
varsity line-up explained the behavior
of the older ruggers, but the game of
the freshmen, who were gathered un
der fire for the first time, held a true
element of surprise.
None of which should be taken to
mean that there were not ragged holes
in the play of both teams, or that the
visitors displayed more than the cleats
on their shoes. The fact remains that
the Stanford backs got away with
numerous pretty passing runs and
open play, while our forwards smoth
ered most attempts of the opponents
to get the ball out of the pack.
New Rules Are Tested.
It was of interest to see the new
scoring method of four points for tries
and one point for conversions in oper
ation. The imaginary line of inter
ference between the opposing scrums
was also drawn by the referee.
Within seven minutes after the
Olympics took the kick at 2:10, Erb
cut through the scrum for a twenty
yard gain, and yielded the ball to Sar
gent, who passed to Reeves for the
first try. Austin failed to convert, and
the new scoring system of four and
one chalked a quartet of tallies on the
board.
After the dropout, Erb, Austin, Lacli
muiul and Carroll joined forces to
cleave the way for a second try from
the twenty-five yard scrum. Second
failure at conversion held the score
at 8-0.
The Winged O rallied, and made
their first offensive fighting, which
carried the action to Stanford's twen
ty-yard mark. The loss of ground was
soon retrieved, and Austin wriggled
through the defending forwards, pass
ing to Lachmund at the five-yard limit
for a score. The performance of the
first five recalled visions of Dugle
McGregor's feat in the second walk

over by All Blacks last fall. Austin's
kick found the right lane for a conver
sion, and half-time caught the score
at 13 to nothing.
Olympics Rally in Second Half.
Erb's kickoff opened the second
period. The Olympic forwards swept
the field in a fierce rally under the
guidance of "Doc" Schaupp and "Stub
by" Stolz, and only Andrews' coolness
fended off a score. He found touch at
Stanford's thirty, and again turned the
tide. During a spell of easy advance
under the shadow of the opponents'
goal post Coach Brown sent in his sub
stitutes. Patterson relieved Lachmuiul
at second five, Blase succeeded Pettin
gill at lock.
The final score resulted from a try
made by Austin, who rushed the field
from a thirty-yard lineout. Score 17-
0.
During the last fifteen minutes the
remaining substitutes were sent in.
Ogden took Captain Gard's place as
right breakaway, Tilton followed Erb
at half, and Crary took Reeves' left
wing.
The Olympics were going strong at
the last. Andrews kept the club men's
slate clean by downing Hawkes, the
opposing center, on the twenty-yard
mark. Later a fumble at center al
lowed an invasion of Stanford's ten
yard zone.
Referee, Fuller; touch judges, Read
ing and Miller. Time of halves, twenty
five and twenty.
Freshmen Hammer Mission Goal.
From first to last the freshmen
hammered gaily at Mission's goal.
Stafford received the kickoff, and the
ball ricocheted across the center line
for several minutes before the oppo
nents got their bearings. Then the
excitement swept on to a scrum at
Mission's ten-yard line, where Fresh
man Walker took the ball and passed
to Greve, the first five. The ball was
lost, and Stafford followed it across
the line, covering for the preliminary
four points, which were raised one by
Fisher's conversion.
After Piercy kicked for the visitors,
Greve made a clean swoop across the
line from scrum at twenty. Failure of
the kick for goal held score at 9-0.
Stafford intercepted a pass after a
five-yard scrum, and the ball was
