the forests of La Aigle and Craonnc,
between Rheims and Loan, twenty
five miles northwest and between
Rheims and Chalons, thirty miles

northeast of Paris. This is the first

since the Germans began retreating
that the enemy is returning to the at
tack. It is believed that the Germans

viously prepared, and that a battle is
imminent. This shows that the retreat
of the Teutons has stopped.
