# Duty Owed Your College
## 
### 
The election of eighteen men to
membership in the University Confer
ence on Thursday will mean a change
in the personnel of that body so vital
as at once to affect the character and its
present high plane of endeavor, if the
electors chosen by the men of the va
rious departments are not fit in every
way to occupy the places on the com
mittee governing student affairs. Eigh
teen new men in a group of thirty;
since that group is the legislature of
this college community, what is so im
portant as the choosing of the depart
mental representatives?
In later years we shall come face to
face with the duty of citizenship, the
duty we owe our state, and at that time
few will look on the choice of their
representative with indifference, car
ing not enough to question the qualifi
cations of the electors. And how much
more important the problems of your
student government are, how much
nearer home the worth or the ineffi
ciency of the legislative body strikes!
The men elected to the University
Conference are given the expression of
your own opinions, and the power to
rule for the good of the majority. The
judgment of every upperclassman is to
be reflected in the result of the elec
tion; if you are a factor in the trend
of student affairs in this University
study the lists published today, and .Â»e
prepared to cast an intelligent vote.
