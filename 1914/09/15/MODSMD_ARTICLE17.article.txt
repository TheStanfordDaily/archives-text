# "A Song For the New Age "
## 
### 
The following bit of verse is a selec
tion from "Songs for the New Age,"
written by James Oppenheim. The col
lected series may be found in the Sep
tember number of the Century Maga
zine :
Though I am little as all little
things,
Though the stars that pass over my
tininess are as the sands of the
sea,
Though the garment of the night was
made for a sky-giant and does
not fit me,
Though even in a city of men i am as
nothing,
Yet at times the gift of life is almost
more than I can bear.
1 laugh with joyousness. The morning
is a blithe holiday;
And in the overrunning of my hardy
bliss rises for the very breath
i breathe.
How soaked the universe is with life!
Not a cranny but is drenched;
And not even I was overlooked!
