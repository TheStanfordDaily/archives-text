# Letter From a Self-Made Merchant to His Freshman Son

### 
Dear Pierrepont—
The first thing that any education
ought to give a man is character, and
the second thing education. That is
where I'm a little skittish about this
college business. I'm not starting in
to preach to you, because I know that
a young fellow, with the right sort of
stuff in him, preaches to himself hard
er than anyone else can, and that he
is mighty often switched off the right
path by having it pointed out to him in
the wrong way.
There are two parts of a college ed
ucation—the part that you get in the
schoolroom from the professors, and
the part you get outside of it from the
boys. That's the really important part.
For the first can only make you a
scholar, while the second can make
you a man.
A good, strong boy will turn out a
bright, strong man, whether he's worn
smooth in the grab-what-you-want
and-eat-standing-with-one eye-skinned
for-the-dog school of the streets and
stores, or polished up slick in the
ive-you.r-order-to-the-waiter-and get-a
sixteen-course-dinner school of the
professors. But while the lack of an
education can't keep No. 1 down, hav
ing it boosts up No. 2.
—George Horace Lorimer.
