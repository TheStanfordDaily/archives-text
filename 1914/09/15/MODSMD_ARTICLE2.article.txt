The locale of "Men and Women" ; s
Washington, D. C., in 1890, during a
time of financial stringency in Wall
street. Valuable securities are found
missing from the Jefferson National
Bank, of which Israel Cohen (P. E.
Leland, '15) is president, and William
Prescott (Buford Williams, '16) is
cashier. The loss is credited to Ed
ward Seabury, (W. J. Gross, '16) as
sistant cashier, who is known to have
speculated heavily with one Arnold
Kirk, a rash broker of the street. After
the death of Kirk, Seabury is unable to
prove his innocence, and Prescott, who
is the real culprit, continues to hide
the truth. Prescott had taken the se
curities to invest with Kirk, expecting
to return them as soon as he had re
ceived the hoped-for returns.
The third act is the scene of an im
portant meeting of the bank directors,
who are endeavoring to put the bank
on a firm basis. Both Prescott and Sea
bury are present, as well as Governor
Rodman, the father of the former's
fiancee, and the play rises to a splen
did climax in this act.
Miss Terese Dorroh, '16, and Miss
Trma Rayburn, '16, will have unusual
dramatic opportunities as "Agnes Rod
man and "Dora Prescott," whose pres
ence lends great charm to the drama.
