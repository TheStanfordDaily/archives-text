# BAND STARTS YEAR WITH COMPLETE ORGANIZATION
## Four Sunday Afternoon Concerts to Be Given in Inner Quad During Semester. 
### 
With a larger, better balanced and
more complete organization than ever
before, the Stanford band has started
upon its twenty-fourth year. Ten new,
but experienced players bring the total
membership to forty-five—five more
than ever before. The addition of oboes
and bassoons, perfectly balanced reeds
and brass sections, and the retainment
of last year's three able soloists, are
the assurance for a band of the finest
caliber.
W. M. Bradford, '15, will serve as
student leader, with J. A. Gibbs, '15, as
manager. Regular instruction will
again be given by Professor E. W.
Martin, of the Greek Department. Pro
fessor Martin has been director of the
band for five years. Former leader, G.
P. Ross, '14. cornetist; D. P. Carleton,
'14, clarionetist, and J. H. Williams, '13,
baritone, will be the soloists for the en
suing year.
In reply to queries from several uni
versities regarding the Stanford band,
Professor Martin has written an article
for The Metronome, a leading musical
publication.
Band men are looking forward to an
extended tour during the early part
of next summer, hoping to travel as far
south as the San Diego Exposition.
Nothing has been done in regard to a
Christmas trip, but during the spring
vacation, the band will either journey
north or repeat its recent, tour to
Southern California.
Four Sunday afternoon concerts will
be given in the inner Quad this semes
ter, the first of which will take place
