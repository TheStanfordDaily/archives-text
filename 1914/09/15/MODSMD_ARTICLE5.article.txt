Fifteen Ruggers, representing Palo

Stanford rooting section tomorrow af
ternoon, when they will contest with
the freshmen in the first of a series
of games to be played on the turf field.
During the past football seasons each
year the Palo Alto players have af
forded the Stanford freshmen excellent
competition. Last fall the Ruggers
from the near-by town were victors in
three out of four contests with the baby

baby team by a score of 21 to 0. The
game throughout was characterized
by individual play, and lack of team
work on the part of both teams. Fail

to hold the fast 1917 backfield is large
ly responsible for the unexpected
score.
Following Neuner's kickoff for 1918

sophomore forwards, where it was cov

picked the ball up from the loose on
his own thirty-yard line, and ran
through a scattered field for a sensa
