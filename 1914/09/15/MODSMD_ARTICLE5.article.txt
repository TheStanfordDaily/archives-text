# PALO ALTO TO MEET FRESHMEN AT RUGBY IN MIDWEEK GAME
## First Contest of Interclass Series Results in Victory For Sophomores Over Babes—Game Is Characterized by Loose Play 1917 BACKFIELD AGGRESSIVE 
### 
Fifteen Ruggers, representing Palo
Alto High School, will make their first
appearance of the season before a
Stanford rooting section tomorrow af
ternoon, when they will contest with
the freshmen in the first of a series
of games to be played on the turf field.
During the past football seasons each
year the Palo Alto players have af
forded the Stanford freshmen excellent
competition. Last fall the Ruggers
from the near-by town were victors in
three out of four contests with the baby
aggregation. In view of these facts
a close and exciting struggle may be
anticipated. Tomorrow's game will
commence promptly at 4:45 with "Ric"
Templeton blowing the whistle.
The line-ups for the two teams are
as follows:
Palo Alto —Flugel, Evans, Kirksey,
Braunschweiger, Phippen, O'Laine,
Loder, Gibson, forwards: Risling, half;
C.Green, Ist five; G. Green, 2d five;
Morris, center three-quarters; Nagel,
left wing; Pratt, right wing, Angell,
fullback.
Freshmen—Stevick, Slocum, Henry,
Cole, Hough, Card, McArthur, Fisher,
forwards; Walker, half; Greve, Ist
five; Stafford, 2d five; Chandler, cen
ter three-quarters; Weeks, left wing;
Johnson, right wing; Neuner, fullback.
The sophomore fifteen won the right
to contest in the finals of the inter
class Rugby championship yesterday
afternoon, when they overwhelmed the
baby team by a score of 21 to 0. The
game throughout was characterized
by individual play, and lack of team
work on the part of both teams. Fail
ure of the freshman forwards to get
behind the ball and of their backfield
to hold the fast 1917 backfield is large
ly responsible for the unexpected
score.
Following Neuner's kickoff for 1918
the play shifted back and forth for five
minutes, until the ball was finally
kicked out on the freshman's twenty
yard line. After the throw-in the pig
skin was dribbled to the line by the
sophomore forwards, where it was cov
ered by Tedford for the first try of the
game. Austin failed to convert. The
play was then situated in 1917 terri
tory for several minutes, when Austin
picked the ball up from the loose on
his own thirty-yard line, and ran
through a scattered field for a sensa
tional touchdown. He failed to con-
vert a difficult goal. Mayberry scored
the next try for the sophomores, when
shortly after the drop-out he received
the ball on the inside wing, and skirted
Ihe sidelines for a quarter length of
j the field for the third goal. Austin
j again failed in his attempt at conver
sion, leaving the score at the end of
the first half twelve to ze.ro in favor
of the 1917 aggregation.
Patterson kicked off for the sopho
mores in the second period, the ball
finally going out on their own twenty
yard line. For some time following
the 1917 goal line was with great dif
ficulty defended from the repeated at
tacks of the freshman forwards. West
put the ball out of the danger zone
when he booted for a forty-yard gain
into 1918 territory. From the line-out
a passing rush, Austin, Lachmund to
Patterson, resulted in the first try of
the second half. Austin failed to con
vert for the fourth time. Immediate
ly following the drop-out Lachmund
scooped up the ball from the opposing
dribblers on the babes' thirty-yard line
and zigzagged through the opposition
for the last touchdown of the game.
Austin converted an easy goal, raising
the total to 21 to 0.

forded the Stanford freshmen excellent
competition. Last fall the Ruggers
from the near-by town were victors in
three out of four contests with the baby
aggregation. In view of these facts
a close and exciting struggle may be
anticipated. Tomorrow's game will
commence promptly at 4:45 with "Ric"
Templeton blowing the whistle.
The line-ups for the two teams are
as follows:
Palo Alto —Flugel, Evans, Kirksey,
Braunschweiger, Phippen, O'Laine,
Loder, Gibson, forwards: Risling, half;
C.Green, Ist five; G. Green, 2d five;

The sophomore fifteen won the right
to contest in the finals of the inter
class Rugby championship yesterday
afternoon, when they overwhelmed the
baby team by a score of 21 to 0. The
game throughout was characterized
by individual play, and lack of team
work on the part of both teams. Fail
ure of the freshman forwards to get
behind the ball and of their backfield
to hold the fast 1917 backfield is large
ly responsible for the unexpected
score.
Following Neuner's kickoff for 1918
the play shifted back and forth for five
minutes, until the ball was finally
kicked out on the freshman's twenty
yard line. After the throw-in the pig
skin was dribbled to the line by the
sophomore forwards, where it was cov
ered by Tedford for the first try of the
game. Austin failed to convert. The
play was then situated in 1917 terri
tory for several minutes, when Austin
picked the ball up from the loose on
his own thirty-yard line, and ran
through a scattered field for a sensa
tional touchdown. He failed to con-
vert a difficult goal. Mayberry scored
the next try for the sophomores, when
shortly after the drop-out he received
the ball on the inside wing, and skirted
Ihe sidelines for a quarter length of
j the field for the third goal. Austin
j again failed in his attempt at conver
sion, leaving the score at the end of
the first half twelve to ze.ro in favor
of the 1917 aggregation.
Patterson kicked off for the sopho
mores in the second period, the ball
finally going out on their own twenty
yard line. For some time following
the 1917 goal line was with great dif
ficulty defended from the repeated at
tacks of the freshman forwards. West
put the ball out of the danger zone
when he booted for a forty-yard gain
into 1918 territory. From the line-out
a passing rush, Austin, Lachmund to
Patterson, resulted in the first try of
the second half. Austin failed to con
vert for the fourth time. Immediate
ly following the drop-out Lachmund
scooped up the ball from the opposing
dribblers on the babes' thirty-yard line
and zigzagged through the opposition
for the last touchdown of the game.
Austin converted an easy goal, raising
the total to 21 to 0.
