# DEBATERS WILL HOLD RALLY AT ENCINA HALL
## MANY CONTESTANTS ARE WANTED TO TRY FOR INTERCOLLEGIATE HONORS. FORMER FORENSIC STARS TO SPEAK ATTRACTIVE PROGRAM HAS BEEN ARRANGED BY COMMITTEE IN CHARGE. 
### 
"More men fox- the Intercollegiate
Debate," is the cry of the debating en
thusiasts of Stanford. Both men and
women will be urged to try-out for this
forensic contest with California at the
big debating rally which will be held at
Encina Hall this evening.
S. W. Charles, '98, E. Cunah, '07, and
Alexander Sheriffs, '06, members of
former Stanford Intercollegiate and
Carnot teams, and W. P. Herron, '08,
who also took part in the Carnot De
bate while at Stanford, will be present
at this rally. They have been asked
to speak, and will present some argu
ments fo.r the cause of debating, as
well as for the importance of securing
freshman entries in the try-outs for
the various contests to be staged dur
ing the year.
It is the opinion of the intercollegi
ate committee that at least forty or
fifty men are needed to try-out for the
debate with California, if a team rep
resentative of Stanford's ability is to
be secured. Heretofore all Cardinal
debating teams have been picked from
a field of not more than a dozen con
testants.
Details and plans for the rally were
discussed at a joint meeting of Nes
toria and Euphronia Debating Societies
last evening, and an entertainment well
worth while is promised those who at
tend. The program will begin at 7:30.
