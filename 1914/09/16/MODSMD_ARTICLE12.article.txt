# NO DEBATING LEAGUE WILL BE FORMED WITH U. S. C.
## 
### 
The debaters of Stanford and Cali
fornia have decided not. to enter into
an agreement with the University of
Southern California for the formation
of a three-cornered debating league.
The chief reason for this action is
the refusal on the part of California to
abolish the Intercollegiate Debate,
which would necessitate the formation
of an entirely separate league, if the
southern university was admitted.
Thus will the tri-state agreement in
force, the attention of our debaters
would be too much divided for them
to do justice to any one contest. It
is thought more desirable to retain the
Tri-state League than to form a new
one.
