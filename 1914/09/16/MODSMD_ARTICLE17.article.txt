Paris, Sept. 16.—Indications from
the front point to a renewal of fight
ing on the part of the rear guard of

lies. The entire German line is being
reorganized. Teuton forces are now
entrenching on the low foothills north
of the river Aisne, twenty-five miles
from the Belgian border, where it is
acknowledged they will inake a pow
erful stand. Bridges crossing the riv
er have been destroyed by the Ger
mans, and all the pontoons used for
transporting troops have been with
drawn by the defenders. On account
of the heavy rains, the roads every
where are mires, in many places ford
ing being necessary. Rivers hereto
fore shallow have become raging tor
rents.
Position of Teutons Strong Yet.

five miles within the F,ranco-Belgian
border, extending seventy miles along
the north bank of the river Aisne,
among low hills admirably located for

this district have been heavily .rein
forced.

ties. The population of Paris, how
ever, have confidence in the numerical
superiority of the allies to defeat the
enemy."
