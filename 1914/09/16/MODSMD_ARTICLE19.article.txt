# Tomorrow Afternoon
## 
### 
We're glad that tomorrow is the
day, for there is a good deal of satis
faction in looking forward to a snap
py Rugby game. May not be football
of the highest grade, of course, but
an interclass match is rarely one
sided and 'pep' is never lacking. The
Sophomores played to a small crowd
on Monday, yet a good thing is quickly
advertised, and tomorrow will find
rooting sections worthy of the name
backing their respective teams. There
is never the sure touch, the stunning
shock in the underclass struggle that
is evident in the Junior-Senior match.
Sombreros against the new clean
cord'sâ€”on which side are you sitting?
