# Off to a Good Start
## 
### 
Tonight a new rally will be intro
duced to the college public, a new
chapter opened in Stanford's debating
history. A rally is to be held in En
cina clubrooms, a strenuous effort
made to interest a large number in
the competition for the hono,rs of the
intercollegiate debate. No better step
has been taken for many a day, and
the interest shown tonight should re
pay the work of the committee in
placing forensic activities on a firmer
basis.
Few in this community realize that
on the occasion of the last intercolle
giate meeting, twenty-five hundred
people heard the arguments of the
representative speakers. The grand
finale of their long and tiresome pre
paratory season was worth the effort,
the game proved worth the candle. It
is to create an interest in those who
have heretofore held aloof, to spread
the gospel of the worth of public
speaking, that the meeting has been
arranged for tonight. The speakers
are of known calibre, the program
short and interesting. The rally will
be worth while.
