### 
The following bit of humorous verse
is contributed by Miss Morgan in a
collection of poems in"The Speaker:"
I was mighty good lookin' when I was
young,
Peart, an' black-eyed, an' slim,
With fellows a-courtin' me Sunday
nights,
'Specially Jim.
The likeliest one of 'em all was he;
Chipper an' handsome an' trim;
But I tossed up my head an' made fun
of the crowd,
'Specially Jim.
I said I hadn't no 'pinion o' men,
An' I wouldn't take stock in him!
But they kep' on a-comin' in spite o'
my talk,
'Specially Jim.
I got so tired o' havin' 'em round,
('Spacially Jim)
I made up my mind I'd settle down
An' take up with im.
So we was married one Sunday in
church,
'Twas crowded full to the brim;
'Twas the only way to get rid of 'em
all,
'Spacially Jim.
