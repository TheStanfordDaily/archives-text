United Press Telegraphic Report
Allies' Offense Cheeked.
Berlin, Sept. 16.—The war office
announces that the German troops
have checked the allies' offensive
movement in France by a general re
pulse of the French forces all along the
front. The army staff reports claim
the new plans for meeting the allies to
be working out most satisfactorily. It
is believed that on account of the con
tinual repulse of the Russians in North
ern Prussia, that they will turn their
attention to an invasion of Russian
Poland.
German Garrisons Needed at Front.
Berlin (via Rome),An official state
ment from the German war office
states that the Germans have aban
doned Liege. No reason for this ac
tion is known, and the dispatch is un
confirmed. It has been .reported that
the communication of the German army
with Germany has been threatened, but
statements from London and Paris do
not intimate that any operations, other
than those of the Belgians, are being
carried on in the German rear. Pos
sibly the troops in Liege have been sent
sout"h to aid German armies in France.
Aiistrians Deny Further Reverses.
Vienna( via Rome), Sept. 16. —The
Austrian war office this afternoon de
nied that the army of General Dankle,
in Austrian Galicia, had surrendered.
The dispatch said that the Russians
surrounded Dankle's troops, but that
they succeeded in cutting their way out
and effecting a junction with the main
Austrian forces. The losses of the ar
mies of Franz Joseph are admittedly
heavy. It is denied that the Russians
have invested Prezemysl.
Kaiser's Troops Make Foreed March.
Antwerp, Sept. 16. —Sixty thousand
fresh German reinforcements are en
gaged in making a forced march
through Belgium to Aix-la-Chapelle. Tt
is unknown whether they will assist
General von Kluk, stationed there, or
will continue further south, to fill the
gaps occasioned by the heavy losses
that have befallen the Germans during
the last ten days of fighting.
Italy May Join Allies.
London, Sept. 16.—There is a grow
ing belief here that Italy will soon
cast her lot with the allies. Confiden
tial diplomatic reports state that the
anti-Austrian feeling has increased
twofold, owing to the announcement
that many Italians placed forcibly in
the front ranks of the Austrians were
slaughtered during the fighting in the
Adriatic -Tyrol regions.
