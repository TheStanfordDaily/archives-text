It happened in front of the "Zete"
house.
"Is that one of the ruins of the
earthquake?" asked the frosh with half
uncovered head, as he gazed at the
unfinished Union building.
"Yes," murmured the wise and woolly
sophomore. "That's one of the ruins
now being repaired."
Enter a junior.
"What's that you're giving that
frosh?" he asked, authoritively.
"I was saying that over yonder
stands a 'ruing' which now is being
fixed up. Am I right?"
"You're wrong," replied the junior,
"that's the new postoffice."
Whereupon out of the dust of Lasuen
arose an argument.
"It isn't!" said the one.
'"Tis, too" said tuther.
"It isn't!" answered back the one,
Ente.r a senior.
Junior and soph together: "What's
that building over there?"
"Search me," replied the senior. "Ask
that frosh coming up the line."
Junior and soph together: "Hey,
frosh, what's that building over in the
lot?"
"The Union," replied the freshman.
"What's delaying it?" asked the de
feated sophomore.
"The contractor's a southerner," the
first year man answered, "and he re
fuses to work on a Union building."
Chorus of fellow studes, "Kill him!"
Exit frosh, followed by puff of smoke
from the nickel cob.
