# NEW EQUIPMENT RECEIVED BY MECHANICAL ENGINEERS
## 
### 
Three new machines for experiments
in the Engineering Department arrived
at Stanford during the summer, and
will enable students in mechanical en
gineering to do more advanced work
this year than has ever been accom
plished here before.
The new equipment consists of one
Mueller Water Meter Tester, one
"Shone" and one "Priestman" Sewage
Ejector, and a twelve horsepower Gen
eral Electric induction motor. The
latter has been constructed to run at
foil'- different speeds, and will be used
for centrifugal pump testing.
Professor W. R. Eckart, who has
charge of the department in which the
new machine will be used, says that the
equipment is valued at more than fif
teen hundred dollars, and that the
work which students of the Engineer
ing Department can do with it will
place Stanford one step higher among
the engineering schools of the country.
