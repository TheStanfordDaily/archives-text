of the Rugby season it was announced
that he would be unable to practice ow
ing to the pressure of studies.
An hour's scrimmage between the
Greys and Blacks on the turf was the
feature of yesterday's practice. The
two fifteens played an almost even

was superior in team work over thai
of the varsity Grey's. Coach Brown
acted as referee.

but none of them are of a serious na
ture. Trainer Harry Maloney states
that hs has the men well in hand, and
it will be only a matter of a few days
before they will be ready for a hard
contest.
