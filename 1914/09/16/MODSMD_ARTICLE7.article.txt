# PALO ALTANS BAFFLED BY FRESHMAN ATTACK
## 1918 SHUTS OUT VISITORS WITH FOUR TO NOTHING SCORE GAME IS WON IN THE FIRST HALF LIGHT WEIGHT FIFTEEN MAKES PLUCKY DEFENSE AGAINST HEAVIER FIRST YEAR MEN 
### 
Stanford Freshmen came into poss
ession of a four point shutout over
Palo Alto High this afternoon. When
time was called they knew they had
been in a hard struggle.
The black jersied players from town
were the lightest men who have repre
sented Palo Alto in several seasons.
Their team play was well organized
and their willingness to dispute the
outcome to the last gun was admirable.
As a spectacle, t ie match was dull.
Most of the game was held to the
ground. Palo Alto contributed some
fast passing runs which were a feature
of the second half.
Card took Phippen's kickoff at the
Freshman twenty-five and found touch
well beyond center. The first fifteen
minutes found play continuously in
Palo Alto's close quarters. Superior
work of the 1918 forwards caused an
interesting series of dribbling runs.
The ball never left the ground except
for occasional pretty touch kicking by
Neuner and Stafford, Freshmen full
and five eights, and C. Green, Palo Alto
first five.
As a result of the imaginary line rule
between the scrums, Fisher, Stanford
breakaway, had three chances at pen
alty goal from the field.
After twenty minutes of fighting
Walker, Freshman half, took the ball
from a ten yard ruck and passed to
Green, who crashed through the de
fense for the initial four points.
Fisher failed of conversion. Score,
4-0.
The high school forwards settled
down to hard defense in the last two
minutes of the half, and drove the cen
ter of play from thei.r five yard zone
to well beyond the center.
Second llalf
Neuner's kick opened the second
period for the Freshmen. Action was
at once carried to the region of the
opponents' twenty-five where the play
remained most of the half.
Palo Alto's backfield took a number
of neat excursions downfield. Their
onslaughts were steadily checked, and
seldom threatened more than momen
tary danger.
The whistle caught play in Palo Alto
ground, with the forward fighting hard.
Final score, 4-0.
