# Rally Finds Fifteen Debating Aspirants
## INTERCOLLEGIATE TRY-OUT SET FOR SEPTEMBER 30. Elimination System Will Be Used to Choose Team for California Contest. 
### 
Fifteen men representative of the
four undergraduate classes of the Uni
versity, signed up to try-out for the
intercollegiate debating team at the
rally in Encina last evening. This
number does not include several de
baters who were unable to be present,
so that the total of those trying for
positions on the team will be con
siderably greater when all the names
are received.
F. W. Herron, '08, an intercollegi
ate and Carnot debater, was the first
speaker of the evening. He told of
the greater advantages that debating
gives to a man, compared with those
derived from other activities. "The
impression we receive by what a man
says, and how he says it, often out
lives the glamour of what he accom
plished in athletics," he said. "There
is nothing like debating to give a
man poise and assurance."
Ed. Cunah, '07, who was the Student
Body president, and a successful de
bater while at Stanford, was the next
speaker. Tie emphasized the fact that
experience in speaking before the pub
lic enables a man to "put a thing
over'' when he is on the firing line.
Cunah is an assistant district attor
ney in San Francisco, and spoke from
experience on this point.
The method which will he followed
in choosing the Intercollegiate De
bating Team this year was outlined
by W. 11. Owens, '14, in a short talk.
"Two weeks from tonight," he said,
"on Wednesday, September 30, the tr.v
outs will be held. The team will not
be picked by the Judges at that time,
but two squads will be choosen from
the best men present. These squads
will engage in practice debates until
the day before the intercollegiate,
when the team will be chosen. This
system is expected to eliminate the
possibility of a man making the team
on the strength of mere eloquence."
Alexander Sheriffs, '06, another old
debater, and a Carnot medalist, who
is superintendent of schools in San
.Tose, was the last speaker of the ral
ly. He said that even if a man doesn't
make the team benefit will come to
him if he tries hard.
The question which will be debated
with California is, "Resolved, that
California should abolish state-wide
initiative and referendum." Stanford
will have the privilege this year of
choosing which side of the proposi
tion they will uphold.

number does not include several de
baters who were unable to be present,
so that the total of those trying for
positions on the team will be con
siderably greater when all the names
are received.
F. W. Herron, '08, an intercollegi
ate and Carnot debater, was the first
speaker of the evening. He told of
the greater advantages that debating
gives to a man, compared with those
derived from other activities. "The
impression we receive by what a man
says, and how he says it, often out
lives the glamour of what he accom
plished in athletics," he said. "There
is nothing like debating to give a
man poise and assurance."
Ed. Cunah, '07, who was the Student
Body president, and a successful de
bater while at Stanford, was the next
speaker. Tie emphasized the fact that
experience in speaking before the pub
lic enables a man to "put a thing
over'' when he is on the firing line.
Cunah is an assistant district attor
ney in San Francisco, and spoke from
experience on this point.
The method which will he followed
in choosing the Intercollegiate De
bating Team this year was outlined
by W. 11. Owens, '14, in a short talk.
"Two weeks from tonight," he said,
"on Wednesday, September 30, the tr.v
outs will be held. The team will not
be picked by the Judges at that time,
but two squads will be choosen from
the best men present. These squads
will engage in practice debates until
the day before the intercollegiate,
when the team will be chosen. This
system is expected to eliminate the
possibility of a man making the team
on the strength of mere eloquence."
Alexander Sheriffs, '06, another old
debater, and a Carnot medalist, who
is superintendent of schools in San
.Tose, was the last speaker of the ral
ly. He said that even if a man doesn't
make the team benefit will come to
him if he tries hard.
The question which will be debated
with California is, "Resolved, that
California should abolish state-wide
initiative and referendum." Stanford
will have the privilege this year of
choosing which side of the proposi
tion they will uphold.
