United Press Telegraphic Report
Berlin (via The Hague), Sept. 17. —
The German general staff claims
that the French have spent themselves
and that the German positions are be
ing maintained. The student com
manders explain that the rapid inva
sion of France tired the troops, and
that it was deemed best to retire to
some strong position to rest. The
Teutons are now concentrating sup
plies during the present lull in their
advance in order to be ready for a
long, hard campaign when the troops
have recuperated. The defensive po
sition of the Germans is announced
here as unthreatened at any point
along the line. It is insisted that
Paris will be invested before the cam
paign is ended.
Italians Ordered to Report < *8.
London, Sept. 17. —Dispatch
Paris state that all Italian rest
have been ordered to report to the
ors on September 28. If true, it Ui
doubtedly means complete Italian mo
bilization to participate In the war.
Allies Reports of Victories Unfounded.
Washington, Sept. 17.—A wireless
from Berlin to the German embassy
follows: "The French and English re
ports of victories in France are un
true. The retreat of the German west
wing was a practical manuever unaf
fecting the strategical position. The
attempt of the French to break through
the German center has been vigorous
ly repulsed."
French Spirit Result of Confidence.
Paris, Sept. 17.—Fighting along the
line of the river Aisne continues un
changed today. Government officials
expect the Germans to withdraw to a
new base, probably along the Meuse,
near the border of Lorraine, because
of the failure of the German counter
attack. The losses of the allies have
been the heaviest during the last two
days of any time during the war
on account of the admirable location
of the Germans on hills commanding
the swollen river Aisne, which the al
lies were forced to bridge and cross in
the face of a terrible artillery fire. Al
though the German artillery has been
more deadly than at any time yet, Gal
lieni, military governor of Paris,
states that the spirit of the French has
been the finest.
German Right Attempts Advance.
Paris, Sept. 17. —The French center
is driving back the armies of the Ger
man Crown Prince and the Duke of
Wurtemburg, on the river Meuse, just
west of Lorraine. The right wing of
the Teutons, composed of the armies
of Generals von Kluk and von Huelow,
recently reinforced, is endeavoring to
assume the offensive. As a result, the
pressure upon the allies' left is most
serious, and .reinforcements have been
hurried from the defensive army of
Paris and from the center.
Reserves for Gerninn Left.
Paris, Sept. 17.—1t is announced that
the Crown Prince has again been com
pelled to retire. It is believed that the
Germans have been forced to raise the
siege of Verdun. Everywhere else,
however, it is reported that the lines
of the Teutons are holding. The war
office admits that the enemy has been
heavily reinforced, and is standing de
terminedly.
