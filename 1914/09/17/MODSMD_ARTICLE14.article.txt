'Every man a Rugby player this
would seem the millennium—yet the
first step toward such a state of affairs
was taken today when Coach Brown an
nounced that all candidates ior foot
ball honors would be in the squad from
first game to last practice. This means
that Rugby has taken on a wider scope,
it becomes a mean to an end eminently
worth while—the development of the
instinct for clean, hard play. If we arc
to be a unit in the love of sport, we
must share in its progress, for partici
pation means vital interest. A large
aquad is the first requisite for a good
team.
