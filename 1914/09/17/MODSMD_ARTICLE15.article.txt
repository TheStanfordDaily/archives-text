# Seventeen Men
## 
### 
The roll of the University Conference
is now complete, save for the five rep
resentatives-at-large, .to be elected at
a meeting of the students of all depart
ments. The men named today are the
choice of the voters sufficiently inter
ested in the departmental delegation to
cast a ballot, and as members of our
governing committee they should be
accorded loyal support. Their tasks
are difficult, their responsibilities a,re
many, their privileges are great. The
best will be demanded, to prove them
worthy of the place.
