I.
For all we have and are,
For all ou,r children's fate
Stand up and meet the war;
The Hun is at the gate.
Our world has passed away,
In wantoness o'erthrown
There's nothing left today
But steel and fire and stone.
Though all we knew depart,
The old commandments stand
In courage keep your heart;
In strength lift up your hand.
11.
Once more we hear the word
That sickened earth of old—
"No law except the sword,
Unsheathed and uncontrolled.
Once more it knits mankind;
Once more the nations go
To meet and break and bind
A crazed and driven foe.
111.
Comfort, content, delight,
The ages' slow-bought gain—
They shriveled in a night;
Only ourselves remain
To face the naked days
In silent fortitude,
Through perils and dismays
Renewed and re-renewed.
Though all we made depart,
The old commandments stand.
In patience keep you,r heart;
In strength lift up your hand.
IV.
No easy hopes nor lies
Shall bring us to our goal,
But iron sacrifice
Of body, will and soul.
There's but one task for all,
For each one life to live
Who stands if Freedom fall?
Who dies if England live?
