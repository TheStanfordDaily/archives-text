The San Francisco Chronicle's re
cent article on "Stanford's F.rench
man" brings the career of that inter
esting individual again before the mind
of the public.
In 1910 a little book, "The First
Year at Stanford," containing many
interesting articles on the beginning of
the University, was published by the
Stanford English Club. The French
man receives attention in this collec
tion, and a rather definite account is
given of his career. The facts con
tained add to the interest of this re
cluse even more than they detract from
the mystery surrounding him. Extracts
from that article, which was written Ijy
B. S. Allen, '07, now a well-known
newspaper man, follow:
In 1880, Peter Coutts, after confid
ing to the superintendent of his stock
farm his hope of speedily settling his
troubles with the French government,
packed himself off to London, where
he remained for a year. During that
period the difficulty with France was
evidently adjusted to the satisfaction
of both parties, for the exile visited his
old home before returning to America,
and was not molested by the police,
who had been searching for him for al
most a decade. Just before his return,
the manager of Matadero Ranch re
ceived a letter from his employer con
taining the tidings that his troubles
with his home government had been
compromised through the efforts of
his brother and his famous cousin, the
Baroness Burdette-Coutts.
Returning to his beloved adopted
home in 18S1 the pardoned exile re
sumed his life as a country gentleman,
and again began work on the struc
tures which will stand as mute wit
nesses of his eccentricities.

In 1882 Coutts started for France
with his family for a visit to the moth
er country. He never returned to
America. It is thought that his invalid
wife had induced him to remain :n
France for the remainder of his life.
In the fall of 1882, through his agent,
the Anglo-California Bank, Peter
Coutts disposed of his fair domain,
and all of its livestock to Senator Le
land Stanford.
The final years of the Frenchman's
life are shrouded in mystery. It is said
that he invested the remainder of his
fortune in a Parisian manufacturing
concern, but this has never been veri
fied. M. Peter Coutts died in 1894, in
Marseilles, France, and the sole heir oi
the family is a son, who resides some
where in France.
Whatever may have been the French
man's wrongdoing, it is not for this
that he will be longest remembered,
but for building the picturesque ruins
which give to the University a wealth
of associations, usually acquired only
after long years of existence.

Returning to his beloved adopted
home in 18S1 the pardoned exile re
sumed his life as a country gentleman,
and again began work on the struc
tures which will stand as mute wit
nesses of his eccentricities.

In 1882 Coutts started for France
with his family for a visit to the moth
er country. He never returned to
America. It is thought that his invalid
wife had induced him to remain :n
France for the remainder of his life.
In the fall of 1882, through his agent,
the Anglo-California Bank, Peter
Coutts disposed of his fair domain,
and all of its livestock to Senator Le
land Stanford.
The final years of the Frenchman's
life are shrouded in mystery. It is said
that he invested the remainder of his
fortune in a Parisian manufacturing
concern, but this has never been veri
fied. M. Peter Coutts died in 1894, in
Marseilles, France, and the sole heir oi
the family is a son, who resides some
where in France.
Whatever may have been the French
man's wrongdoing, it is not for this
that he will be longest remembered,
but for building the picturesque ruins
which give to the University a wealth
of associations, usually acquired only
after long years of existence.
The San Francisco Chronicle's re
cent article on "Stanford's F.rench
man" brings the career of that inter
esting individual again before the mind
of the public.
In 1910 a little book, "The First
Year at Stanford," containing many
interesting articles on the beginning of
the University, was published by the
Stanford English Club. The French
man receives attention in this collec
tion, and a rather definite account is
given of his career. The facts con
tained add to the interest of this re
cluse even more than they detract from
the mystery surrounding him. Extracts
from that article, which was written Ijy
B. S. Allen, '07, now a well-known
newspaper man, follow:
In 1880, Peter Coutts, after confid
ing to the superintendent of his stock
farm his hope of speedily settling his
troubles with the French government,
packed himself off to London, where
he remained for a year. During that
period the difficulty with France was
evidently adjusted to the satisfaction
of both parties, for the exile visited his
old home before returning to America,
and was not molested by the police,
who had been searching for him for al
most a decade. Just before his return,
the manager of Matadero Ranch re
ceived a letter from his employer con
taining the tidings that his troubles
with his home government had been
compromised through the efforts of
his brother and his famous cousin, the
Baroness Burdette-Coutts.
