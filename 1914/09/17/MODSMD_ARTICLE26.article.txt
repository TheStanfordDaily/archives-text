Without a doubt the Union is slow.
But remember it was Old Mother Hub
bard who said "Haste Makes Waste."
There was a John O. Miller, who
lived on the River Dee. Said John "I
know I'm slow, as slow can be. But
my manly, manly character, which re
sisted Speed's lure, has another char
acteristic —although it's slow, it's
sure."
There's nothing in the'rumor that we
are to have a billboard nuisance. That's
entirely too up-to-date. All the useless
placards and posters are to be torn
down very shortly. There is some one
around whose business it is to attend
to such things.
Come to think of it. oh where, oh
where is Waldo, our little sorority
duck? No more do we hear him chuckle
and quack, or cluck. And no one
it round here —even the darling soph
quartet—knows where little Waldo
went, and if he's out there yet.
What d'ye mean, debating? That
used to be almost a big word for ora
tory around these parts. But since that
rally last night, even that good old fa
vorite, "forensic activities," seems to
trip and fall short of the mark.
