Kaiser's Hold on Germans at Stake.
Bordeaux, Sept. 17.—The French
minister, Millerand, says that the
French are winning the third great
battle of the war. The first battle was
the battle of the Meuse and the Sam
bre, after which the allies retreated;
the second great contest was the re
cent battle of the Marne, which forced
the Germans back to their present po
sition on the Aisne. Millerand states
that the advantage to date is with
the French, that the most of the fight
ing is in the open, and that the indi
cations are that the German positions
are being forced. The French say that
if the German army, which the Ger
man populace regards with awe, is
routed, the Kaiser will face a revolu
tion. It will mean the abandonment
of the militaristic idea as a mistaken
one.
