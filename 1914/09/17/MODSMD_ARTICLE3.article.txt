# TWENTY-FIVE PER CENT OF STANFORD MEN WORK WAY
## College Students Play Nurse and Spiel for Movies in Quest of Money.

Twenty-five per cent of the men at
Stanford are doing work to help sup
port themselves, according to an esti
mate made today by E. H. Lockwood,
secretary of the Y. M. C. A., who has
charge of the student employment bu
reau.
This work embraces every line, from
"a man to care for the baby in the
evenings," to acting as "barker for the
movies." One student partially pays
his way through Stanford by taking
daily walks with an elderly Palo Alto
man, who desired a companion.
Figures show that students at Stan
ford earned more than $8300 last year
through work provided by the student
employment bureau. This was only a
part of the amount earned by stu
dents, as many kinds of work were se
cured without the help of the agency.
