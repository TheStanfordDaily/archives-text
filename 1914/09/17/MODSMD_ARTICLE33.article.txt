# Stanford Supports Free Clinic and Social Worker
## Stanford Undergraduates and Alumni Aid in Great Humanitarian Work. 
### 
Reports from the clinic of the Lane
Hospital, in San Francisco, show Stan
ford and the alumni to be engaged in
a very worthy charitable work, suc
cessful in spite of many handicaps.
The steady growth of the Stanford
Medical School Clinics promises to
eliminate many of these hardships, and
make further and more widely dissem
inated charities possible. The beauti
ful new San Francisco Hospital, which
has cost about $2,000,000, will be
opened on January 1. A number of the
wards in this institution are under con
trol of Stanford.
Dr. Harold Hill, '9S, who has charge
of the medical service, has recently
been joined by Dr. W. W. Rehlow, '07,
who has recently returned from a hos
pital service in Boston. Dr. Frank
Hinman, '02, a graduate of Johns Hop
kins Medical School, will soon return
from Baltimore to have charge of a
portion of the surgical work.
The upper classes of the Medical
School have reached the limit of their
capacity, which is twenty-five mem
bers. A larger number could not be
accommodated, without crowding, and
the aim is to keep to this limit until
added facilities for clinical and labor
atory work can be provided.
The alumni arc maintaining the ser
vices of Mrs. Hammond, a capable so
cial worker, and. up to the present
time, members of the Stanford Student
Body have, by means of subscriptions,
furnished Mrs. Hammond the where
withal to carry on this work. A cam
paign to raise funds to perpetuate the
humane work is now being planned,
and will be given publicity very soon.
The University maintains the free
clinic in conjunction with the medical
school in San Francisco, but the work
which the alumni and Stanford stu
dents are carrying on through Mrs.
Hammond is of a different nature. The
plan has been to Rive relief to patients
of the free clinic who are unable to
support or care for themselves during
their convalescent periods. Sometimes
the relief consists merely in the ad
vancement of carfare or trivial sums
of money, other cases have been assist
ed by the purchase of glasses for pa
tients unable to procure them for them
selves, or the rental of wheel chairs
or crutches.
This work deserves the support of
Stanford students. It is decidedly a
worthy undertaking, of which Stanford
students may well be proud. The plans
for the future campaign are in the
hands of Miss Eugenia Burns, '15, and
Miss Marjory Tlsdale, '15, president of
the Women's Conference.

cial worker, and. up to the present
time, members of the Stanford Student
Body have, by means of subscriptions,
furnished Mrs. Hammond the where
withal to carry on this work. A cam
paign to raise funds to perpetuate the
humane work is now being planned,
and will be given publicity very soon.
The University maintains the free
clinic in conjunction with the medical
school in San Francisco, but the work
which the alumni and Stanford stu
dents are carrying on through Mrs.
Hammond is of a different nature. The
plan has been to Rive relief to patients
of the free clinic who are unable to
support or care for themselves during
their convalescent periods. Sometimes
the relief consists merely in the ad
vancement of carfare or trivial sums
of money, other cases have been assist
ed by the purchase of glasses for pa
tients unable to procure them for them
selves, or the rental of wheel chairs
or crutches.
This work deserves the support of
Stanford students. It is decidedly a
worthy undertaking, of which Stanford
students may well be proud. The plans
for the future campaign are in the
hands of Miss Eugenia Burns, '15, and
Miss Marjory Tlsdale, '15, president of
the Women's Conference.
Reports from the clinic of the Lane
Hospital, in San Francisco, show Stan
ford and the alumni to be engaged in
a very worthy charitable work, suc
cessful in spite of many handicaps.
The steady growth of the Stanford
Medical School Clinics promises to
eliminate many of these hardships, and
make further and more widely dissem
inated charities possible. The beauti
ful new San Francisco Hospital, which
has cost about $2,000,000, will be
opened on January 1. A number of the
wards in this institution are under con
trol of Stanford.
Dr. Harold Hill, '9S, who has charge
of the medical service, has recently
been joined by Dr. W. W. Rehlow, '07,
who has recently returned from a hos
pital service in Boston. Dr. Frank
Hinman, '02, a graduate of Johns Hop
kins Medical School, will soon return
from Baltimore to have charge of a
portion of the surgical work.
The upper classes of the Medical
School have reached the limit of their
capacity, which is twenty-five mem
bers. A larger number could not be
accommodated, without crowding, and
the aim is to keep to this limit until
added facilities for clinical and labor
atory work can be provided.
