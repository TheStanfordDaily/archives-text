# BROWN STARTS NEW MODE OF COACHING RUGBY FOOTBALLERS
## Believes Players Should Have Opportunity to Show Ability Till After Big Game—Stolz and Thoburn to Handle Men GIVES CHANCE FOR SPORT 
### 
That every man now signed up for
football should he allowed to remain
out for the entire season, and also
should he given a chance to demon
strate his ability on either the varsity
or second team, was the emphatic dec
laration made today by Coach Brown,
in answer to many inquiries. The an
nounced policy is one new to football
dom, as it has been the consistent pol
icy previous to this time to gradually
thin, out the ranks until only men of
varsity or near-varsity caliber re
mained.
The aim of Brown is to have as many
men interested in the sport as possible,
rt will be his desire to develop not only
a powerful first team, but to permit ev
ery man to stay on the squad until the
Big Game, to profit by the practice.
Jimmy Thoburn, '13, last year's cap
tain, and Stubby Stolz, '10, who won his
Oxford Blue on the famous English
university's fifteen, will take complete
charge of all players who are not as
yet up to the standard • 112 play for the
irst or second teams. Besides the gen
eral routine of practice every day, it is
planned to stage four games a week
among the players themselves, that
they may master the finer points of
the game. In addition several contests
with outside teams are now being ar
ranged.
During the last few days of practice,
it has been impossible to give
the entire squad a thorough work-out,
owing to the poor condition of the dirt
field back of the oval, and on account
of the interclass series. Manager Wil
cox has already given orders that the
field should be plowed and watered.
As soon as the men under the direc
tion of Thoburn and Stolz display any
improvement, so as to warrant their
being given a chance on either the var
sity or second team, they will be sent
inside to Brown, who will grant them
an opportunity to prove their ability.
Saturday afternoon will present full
value to the holders of season tickets,
when the football fans will be treated
to three games with outside teams, in
adidtion to contests in the morning
between teams A and B, and C and D.
It is a matter of some doubt wheth
er "Tiny" Wines will be eligible for
football this season, since he was kept
from his college work for several
weeks last semester on account of an
attack of typhoid fever.
Numerous cases of oharley horses,
sprained ankles, bad kicks, and
strained ligaments are still bothering
Trainer Maloney. Owing to the fact
of minor injuries, a number of players
will be kept out of the interclass and
Saturday's games.
