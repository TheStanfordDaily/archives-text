# PLAY NEARS PERFECTION
## ELABORATE SCENES READY FOR "MEN AND WOMEN" Sword and Sandals Sets Seat Sale For Tuesday Afternoon—Four Acts Serve Gripping Theme of Belasco and De Mille Fancy 
### 
The seat sale for the Sword and
Sandals play, "Men and Women," will
be held next Tuesday afternoon at the
Bookstore, on the campus and in Palo
Alto.
Rehearsals are being held daily un
der the expert direction of F. L.
Mathieu, of San Francisco, who staged
"The Tyranny of Tears," "The Only
Way," and many other Sword and San
dals successes.
With the play scheduled for the ev
ening of September 25, a week from to
night, the entire cast is now letter
perfect, which augurs well far the ar
tistic success of the production.
The action of the play transpires in
New York City in 1890, opening at the
close of St. Valentine's Day. The
first act pictures a richly furnished
room of unique decoration in the home
of "Mrs. Prescott," (Miss Nellita
Choate, '17). It is here that one makes

the acquaintance of the "Men and Wo
men" of Belasco and DeMille's fancy
—real men and women, who attract
immediate interest and sympathy.
Here, too, develops the first hint of ro
mance in the lives of "William P.res
cott" (Buford Williams, '16), cashier
of the Jefferson National Bank, and
"Agnes Rodman" (Miss Terese Dorroh,
'16), the governor's daughter. The
love interest, however, is by no means
confined to these two, for "Dora" (Miss
Irma Rayburn, '16), Prescott's little
sister, soon confesses her interest in
"Edward Seabury" (W. .1. Gross, '16).
The Alhambra Corridor adjoining
the parlor and picture gallery of "Mrs.
Kate Delafield" (Miss Marion Vaughan,
'16), is the scene of the second act.
The apartment is patterned after a
room in the Alhambra, and is marked
by simplicity and Oriental splendor.
Through a Moorish window is seen a
night view of New York City, after a
