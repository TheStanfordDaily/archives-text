*****
The senior fifteen won the right to
meet the sophomores for the interclass
Rugby championship, when the 1916
team was overwhelmingly defeated by
the one-sided score of 48 to 3 in one
of the fastest games of the present
season. The play of the 1915 forwards
was the feature of the contest, to
them belonging in great measure the
credit of victory. Not only in drib
bling and heeling the ball did the
senior scrum excel 1, but their passing
was equally skillful. The goal kicking
of Templeton for the winners, who
converted eight times out of ten at
tempts, was one of the brightest spots
of the game. The junior fifteen at all
times fought hard, but could not with
stand the powerful attack of the op
position.
Two minutes following the kick-off
by Cass for 191fi, Burns registered the
first try for the seniors with a sensa
tional forty-yard run down the field.
Templeton converted a difficult goal.
