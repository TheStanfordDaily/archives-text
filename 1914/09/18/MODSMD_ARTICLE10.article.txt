*****
The senior fifteen won the right to
meet the sophomores for the interclass
Rugby championship, when the 1916
team was overwhelmingly defeated by
the one-sided score of 48 to 3 in one
of the fastest games of the present
season. The play of the 1915 forwards
was the feature of the contest, to
them belonging in great measure the
credit of victory. Not only in drib
bling and heeling the ball did the
senior scrum excel 1, but their passing
was equally skillful. The goal kicking
of Templeton for the winners, who
converted eight times out of ten at
tempts, was one of the brightest spots
of the game. The junior fifteen at all
times fought hard, but could not with
stand the powerful attack of the op
position.
Two minutes following the kick-off
by Cass for 191fi, Burns registered the
first try for the seniors with a sensa
tional forty-yard run down the field.
Templeton converted a difficult goal.
The ball was scarcely in play again
before a passing rush from Burns to
Erb to Wines, allowed the latter to
place the pigskin between the posts.
Templeton failed to convert. A five
yard scrum after the drop-out permit
tod Erb at half to dash around the
forwards for the third try. Templeton
converted. Danny Carroll saved the
junior team in the next few minutes of
play many times by clever boots to
touch. The only score of the losers
was made by Cass, who kicked a field
goal, after being awarded a penalty on
the senior twenty-five yard line. A
passing rush from Card to Davis to
Templeton scored the last try of the
half. Templeton's conversion left the
total standing 19-3.
Almost directly after the kick-off in
the second half by Erb, Blase took the
ball from a line-out and went ten yards
for fifth try of the game. Templeton
converted a most difficult attempt.
During the next fifteen minutes of
play Gard scored three times and
Wynne twice in almost rapid succes
sion. Templeton converted all except
one goal. Though there remained yet
ten minutes before the second half
should have been called, Coach Brown
and Referee Stolz decided to put an end
to the contest.
