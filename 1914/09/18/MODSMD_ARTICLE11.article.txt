# SOCCER TEAM OPENS SEASON
## 
### 
Cardinal soccer men will lineup
against the Olympics next Saturday
at Recreation Park for the opening
game of the season. Stanford is now
one of the five units in the newly
formed Exposition Football League,
and is scheduled to play a ten-weeks'
series with the league, including two
contests against California.
The Cardinal line-up will embrace
few of last year's players, but the new
material is expected to show up well
in the coming matches. Captain Blod
gett, Cass, Button, and Butcher will
probably be the only veterans on Sat
urday's team.
The Olympic aggregation will be de
cidedly strengthened by the presence
of former Stanford players in their
ranks. Ex-Captain Higgins, '13, whose
loss will weaken the Cardinal squad ma
terially this year, will wear the
winged-0 in Saturday's match. Other
Stanford exponents of the English
game who will line up against their
former team-mates, will be .1. L. Duff,
'13, and F. S. Pratt, '13.
Owing to the large number of Rugby
candidates this fall, the soccer field,
near the track, has been turned over
to the major sport aspirants, and the
soccer men are at present working out
on the field by Enclna Gymnasium.

There are now two full elevens out
regularly for soccer practice, but it is
expected that the numbers will in
crease materially after the Rugby sea
son closes. After the big game sev
eral men of varsity caliber will prob
ably join the soccer ranks. Carroll
and Erb are already wearers of the
Circle-S, and Wylie is also expected to
strengthen the line-up later in the
season.
Trainer Maloney, who is president of
the newly-formed soccer league, has
been asked by some of the officials of
the A. A. L. to aid in the introduction
of soccer as a spring sport in the pre
paratory schools. It is argued that
this game will augment the shorter
Rugby season, and will prove good
training for the Rugby aspirants. In
terest in soccer is growing in the high
schools, and the sport will probably
be installed on a regular basis.
Stanford's line-up for tomorrow's
game as follows:
Outside left, A. J. Vail, '15; inside
left, H. Henderson, '14; outside for
ward. A. \V. Higgins, '13; inside right.
W. B. Blodget, '15; outside right, J. E.
Mead, '15; left half, C. E. Boyle, '15;
