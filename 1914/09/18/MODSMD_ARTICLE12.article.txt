Washington, Sept. 18. —President
Wilson today expressed himself as "ex
tremely hopeful of peace." According
to high authority, real progress to
ward peace has been made as a result
of informal sounding of the combating
nations. It is understood through of
ficial, though private sources, that
President Wilson has reason, as a re
sult of careful and slow discussion, to
hope that definite peace overtures may
be presented soon. It is authorita
tively stated that Germany's foreign
minister, Bethman-Hollweg, has held
conversations with America's minister
to Germany regarding peace, but that
there was no discussion of terms, nor
was the possible acceptance of over
tures suggested. All negotiations have
been of the most secret nature.
Action of Italy May Force Peace.
Petrograd, Sept. 18.—All newspa
pers here are demanding that Italy
join the allies. They say that if she does
Austria will be compelled to sue for
peace immediately, and as a result of
this, the Germans, realizing the futili
ty of continuing the war single-hand
ed against the whole of Europe, will
join with her ally in asking a cessa
tion of hostilities. It is said that the
German government has led her peo
ple to believe that Italy will soon join
the Germans.
Germans Soon Expect to Advance.
Berlin, (via Paris), Sept. 18.—The
general staff today announced: The
battle between the rivers Oise and
Meuse, extending through the entire
northeastern portion of France, a dis
tance of 110 miles, continues at all
points indecisive, although the indica
tions a.re that the resistance of the
enemy is beginning to decline. All
efforts of the French to penetrate the
German right, in the western part of
France, have failed, even though they
were made with great bravery. The
German center is slowly advancing, al
though it has encountered desperate
resistance."
Terrible Losses on Aisne in Vain.
Paris, Sept. 18.—The military head

statement: "The battle continues.
Our lines are holding everywhere."

Washington, Sept. 18. —President
Wilson today expressed himself as "ex
tremely hopeful of peace." According
to high authority, real progress to
ward peace has been made as a result
of informal sounding of the combating
nations. It is understood through of
ficial, though private sources, that
President Wilson has reason, as a re
sult of careful and slow discussion, to
hope that definite peace overtures may
be presented soon. It is authorita
tively stated that Germany's foreign
minister, Bethman-Hollweg, has held
conversations with America's minister
to Germany regarding peace, but that
there was no discussion of terms, nor
was the possible acceptance of over
tures suggested. All negotiations have
been of the most secret nature.

this, the Germans, realizing the futili
ty of continuing the war single-hand
ed against the whole of Europe, will
join with her ally in asking a cessa
tion of hostilities. It is said that the
German government has led her peo
ple to believe that Italy will soon join
the Germans.
Germans Soon Expect to Advance.

points indecisive, although the indica

enemy is beginning to decline. All
efforts of the French to penetrate the
German right, in the western part of

were made with great bravery. The
German center is slowly advancing, al
though it has encountered desperate
resistance."
