# Men With a Red Bow Tie
## 
### 
Tomororw's Rugby match will give
the yell leader candidates another op
portunity to stir the passive body of
bleacherites into vocal evidence of in
terest in the game on the field. A half
hearted response was their portion on
Wednesday, and that impels this ex
pression of opinion on the yell lead
er tryouts:
The spirit in the rooters that finds
expression in the amused tolerance of
the efforts of these men, is not the
spirit that wins games or finds outlet
in the enthusiastic support of the play
ers in slump and winning streak. Rath
er the attitude seems one of indiffer
ence as to the outcome, annoyance at
their position, amusement at their con
tortions—seven men in tight-rope arm
swinging on a six-inch plank.
Whatever may be the attitude to
ward organized rooting or cheering,
whatever indifference may be felt to
ward the command to cheer at certain
times, 4t must be acknowledged that
the yell leader's position is an im
portant one, his place one to be filled
by men of ability. To this one observ
er, and his assistants, is entrusted the
operation of that simple but all-im
portant code, the rooters'expression of
loyalty and unswerving support to the
team on the field. A leader that is in
sensible to the moods of those banked
bleachers of eager humanity is as
much a clog in the rooters' share of
the game as a hesitant player would be
in the smooth working fifteen. The
man chosen for the place must be of
keen perception, of quick thought, a
leader confident in the knowledge of
human nature, and withal one who is
not without a spark of humor and a
sense for tone. Unusual requisites, a
difficult place to fill—then the striv
ing is the more worth while.
We have another opportunity tomor
row; willing support from the rooters,
no hint of apathy in those who cheer,
and on November fourteenth there'll
be confidence in the men with the red
bow tie.
