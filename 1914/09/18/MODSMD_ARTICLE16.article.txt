# Wanted at the Front
## 
### 
An increase of more than fifty per
cent in both news and advertising
space over issues of past years affords
those interested in journalistic work
an opportunity hardly equalled in the
history of the Daily Palo Alto. The
enlarged paper means increased effort
in news-gathering and ad-getting, and
it is to fill the places of graduates
and to properly distribute the rush of
work that the try-outs for repertorial

and managerial positions are an
nounced.
On the editorial side of the parti
tion there is room for a number of
embryonic newspaper men; in the
managerial department a try-out pe
riod, beginning with today, open to all
who wish to apply.
In the first case the competition
started two weeks ago, and Monday
is the last day of the 'open season."
While other literary aspirants will be
welcomed on that day, it is manifestly
impossible to accept a candidacy after
that date. The staff will be an
nounced in a month's time, approxi
mately.
The details of the managerial try
outs may be learned from one of the
committee, named in Thursday's issue.
Trial of the workers in this depart
ment will be over an indeterminate
period.
