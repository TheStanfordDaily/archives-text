# Lone Dog
## 
### Rutherford McLeod 
I'm a lean dog, a keen dog, a wild dog,
and lone,
I'm a rough dog, a tough dog, hunting
my own,
I'm a bad dog, a mad dog, teasing silly
sheep,
I love to sit and bay the moon, to keep
fat souls from sleep.
I'll never be lap dog, licking dirty
feet,
A sleek dog, a meek dog, cringing for
my meat,
Not for me the fireside, the well-filled
plate,
But shut door, and sharp stone, and
cuffs and kicks and hate.
Not for me the other dogs running by
my side,
Some have run a short while, but none
of them would bide,
O mine is still the lone trail, the hard
trail, the best.
Wide wind, and wild stars, and the
hunger of the quest.
