Come to think of it, you might as
well know for whom you are voting
for yell leader. Here they are:
"Buffalo Bill' Cody—Wears new
"cords;" rather gruff looking; square
jaw; light colored pompadour.
"Indian" Fisher —Perpetual grin all
over his face; tall and stately build.
"Sic 'em" Goldsmith —Four eyes, two
light, and two dark. Almost black
hair.
"Coxie" Goodman —Short but cute;
not quite skinny; dark hair; varsity
jaw.
"Corn Flakes" Kellogg—Sorta hus
ky; light colored pomp; the shortest
candidate.
"Doc" Jordan —Handsome; occasion
al, well-placed smile; medium short
and stout (about 36); chestnut hair.
"Date" Palm—Light hair; short and
light pomp; wears an occasional
scared expression.
Vote for the best two.
Without a doubt, the best uncon
firmed rumor of the year is that we are
to have a swimming organization.
There's plenty of material, both raw
and otherwise, and there's a good tank
somewhere in the vicinity. Confirm
that rumor, mere men.
It is not true that college spirit is
shown by how long you can wear the
little red button with the white "S."
That simply indicates that you paid
your student body dues, and we all
did that. Time limit for wearing the
button—September 29. Show your
perseverance and unforgetfulness some
other way. Button, button, who's
wearing a button? Off with it!
