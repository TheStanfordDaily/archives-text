# ONE OF THREE CONTESTS ATTACHED BY CARDINAL
## Senior Fifteen Will Vie With 1917 For Interclass Rugby Title Tomorrow Afternoon on Turf. 
### 
Three football teams were rolled on
to the turf out of the Cardinal war bag
Saturday afternoon, and a little be
fore dinner time the bleacher enthusi
asts pocketed their single victory and
went home to talk it over.
The Varsity team followed custom
and won from the Barbarians, getting
a safe option in the early stages, and
increasing their lead to a sure thing
of eighteen points before they were
scored on. The visitors finally did
manage to cut their initials on the
score board late in the second stage,
when a dribbling spurt by their for
wards gave Gladstone a chance to
cross.
Joy unbounded was brought to the
hearts of the spectators by the way in
which the Varsity men jumped into
the game, and for ten minutes shoot
ing stars were too plural to keep track
of. From that period on the game was
listless, and a bit of passing now and
then was hailed as a sensation.
In their match with the Titan play
ers, the Second Varsity fought hard
and seemed to have cinched the out
come as a four to nothing victory until
the last time was called. While the
fans were commencing to leave their
seats, and were sniffing the smoke
from the timer's gun, the ball was
shoved across the line, and Forbes.
Titan first five, proceeded to convert.
Result, 5 to 4, with the tables turned.
The contest with the Titans was a
gruelling fight, but beyond that, was
of little interest. Open play was ab
sent. The onlookers spent a good part,
of the time speculating on the prob
able outcome of a match between the
Barbarians, composed mostly of Palo
Altans, and the Titans, who were
gleaned mostly from Berkeley High.
The bout between Oakland High and
the Freshmen was the bright attrac
tion of the afternoon. There was as
much resourceful Rugby uncorked in
the fifty-five minutes of that game as
one could well hope to see. The man
running with the ball usually had
someone to pass to in a pinch, which
accounts for the amount of open play,
the high score of 26-17, and the fact

that most of the boys on both teams
figured directly in scoring at some
time.
L. S. Reading, of Palo Alto, was ref
eree in the Varsity and Second Varsi
ty matches; "Stubby" Stolz held the
whistle over the Freshmen. The new
offside rule proved a stumbling block
to all concerned:

Fifteens representing the Senior ana
Sophomore classes will vie on the turf
tomorrow afternoon in the final strug
gle fo.r the honor of claiming the inter
class Rugby championship. A battle
royal may be anticipated.
The game looms up as a very even
one, with the older team slightly the
favorite, on account of the big score
they rolled up against the Juniors last
Thursday, when they scored ten tries
in all. The 1915 forwards make up as
