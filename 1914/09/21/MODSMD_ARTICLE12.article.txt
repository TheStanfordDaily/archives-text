# ONE OF THREE CONTESTS ATTACHED BY CARDINAL
## Senior Fifteen Will Vie With 1917 For Interclass Rugby Title Tomorrow Afternoon on Turf. 
### 
Three football teams were rolled on
to the turf out of the Cardinal war bag
Saturday afternoon, and a little be
fore dinner time the bleacher enthusi
asts pocketed their single victory and
went home to talk it over.
The Varsity team followed custom
and won from the Barbarians, getting
a safe option in the early stages, and
increasing their lead to a sure thing
of eighteen points before they were
scored on. The visitors finally did
manage to cut their initials on the
score board late in the second stage,
when a dribbling spurt by their for
wards gave Gladstone a chance to
cross.
Joy unbounded was brought to the
hearts of the spectators by the way in
which the Varsity men jumped into
the game, and for ten minutes shoot
ing stars were too plural to keep track
of. From that period on the game was
listless, and a bit of passing now and
then was hailed as a sensation.
In their match with the Titan play
ers, the Second Varsity fought hard
and seemed to have cinched the out
come as a four to nothing victory until
the last time was called. While the
fans were commencing to leave their
seats, and were sniffing the smoke
from the timer's gun, the ball was
shoved across the line, and Forbes.
Titan first five, proceeded to convert.
Result, 5 to 4, with the tables turned.
The contest with the Titans was a
gruelling fight, but beyond that, was
of little interest. Open play was ab
sent. The onlookers spent a good part,
of the time speculating on the prob
able outcome of a match between the
Barbarians, composed mostly of Palo
Altans, and the Titans, who were
gleaned mostly from Berkeley High.
The bout between Oakland High and
the Freshmen was the bright attrac
tion of the afternoon. There was as
much resourceful Rugby uncorked in
the fifty-five minutes of that game as
one could well hope to see. The man
running with the ball usually had
someone to pass to in a pinch, which
accounts for the amount of open play,
the high score of 26-17, and the fact

that most of the boys on both teams
figured directly in scoring at some
time.
L. S. Reading, of Palo Alto, was ref
eree in the Varsity and Second Varsi
ty matches; "Stubby" Stolz held the
whistle over the Freshmen. The new
offside rule proved a stumbling block
to all concerned:
The lineups follow:
Varsity—Hall, Bihlman (Wines),
Clark (Kester), Clover, Pettingill
(Braden), Card, Blase (Pettingill), Og
den, forwards; Erb, half; Austin,
Lachmund, five-eighths; Carroll, cen
ter; Reeves, Urban, wings: Andrews,
full.

vel, Halsted, Rehm, Scott, Jacomini,
Bloeser, forwards; Tilton, half; Davis,
Dickey, five-eighths; Hammon, center;

ner, full.

stone, Cashel, Mathewson, Boulware,

Fifteens representing the Senior ana
Sophomore classes will vie on the turf
tomorrow afternoon in the final strug
gle fo.r the honor of claiming the inter
class Rugby championship. A battle
royal may be anticipated.
The game looms up as a very even
one, with the older team slightly the
favorite, on account of the big score
they rolled up against the Juniors last
Thursday, when they scored ten tries
in all. The 1915 forwards make up as
strong a scrum formation as has ever
heeled the ball for any class team. The
same may be said, however, for the
1917 backfield, which boasts of prac
tically a varsity combination.
Stubby Stolz has been chosen by
Coach Drown to blow the whistle.
The game will commence promptly at
1:45 on the turf field. The line-ups
announced below are subject to
changes on account of numerous minor
injuries which many of the players of
both teams have been suffering from.
1915—Hall, Clark, Soper (Bloeser),
Clover, Rehm, Card (Wright), Blase,
Ogden, forwards; Erb, half; Davis Ist
five; Andrews, 2d five; Templeton,
center three quarters; Reeves,
Wynne), left wing; Burns, right wing;
Tilton, fullback.
1917—Kester, Koerner, Scovel, Hal
sted, Pettingill, Swigart, McEuen,
Scott, forwards; Tedford, half; Austin,
Ist five; Lachmund, 2d five; Patterson,
(Hammon), center three-quarters;
Mayberry, left wing; Dievendorf,
(Crary), right wing; Chapman, (West),
fullback.

Team A, the Grays, was victorious
over Team B, the Blacks, to the tune
of 4 to 3 on the inside field Saturday
morning. Both squads put up a rag
ged exhibition of football, but they
provided a whole-hearted fight.
The score of 12 to 4, registers the
victory of Team C over D in a loose
game of Rugby played on the auxiliary
field Saturday morning. The majority
of the players were representatives of
the freshman squad. Jimmy Thoburn
acted as referee.
The Freshmen showed a decided im
provement ove.r their previous form.
The season is still young and the Car
dinal babies have time to settle down
and get used to playing beside one an
other.
The sensational try of the Titans was
hard on the Second Varsity players,
but one of those incidents that go to
make the game interesting from the
bleachers. The game's not over till
the last gun is fired, and then some.
The Titans gave the impression that
they were off form Saturday. Many
fans would like to see them at top
speed. Five-eighths Kuowles was out
of the game, which crippled the back
field.
The Oakland High School boys are
eing coached by Bill Von Mondershierl,
who plays with and helps coach the
Olympic Club fifteen. "Von" is a warm
admirer of Stanford. He made favor
able comment of the Cardinal fresh
man material after Saturday's contest,
There is no gainsaying the remark that
the Oakland boys are a credit to their
coach.
Jim Wylie, who has had an enforced
lay-off because of a rib-strain, as well
as a sprained wrist, will don his Rug
by togs again this week.
