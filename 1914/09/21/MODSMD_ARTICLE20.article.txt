# A 						Good Habit
## 
### 
Tomorrow will find the floodtide of
interclass Rugby rivalry at the high
water mark, and those fortunate
enough to spend the last hour of the
afternoon at Stanford Field, will see
the broad turf swept from training
house to score board in the rush if
Senior and Sophomore play.
Always a good game; if not from
the coach's point of view, then from
the class critic's seat in the bleachers.
For when science fails and training
is forgotten, the blind partizanship of
the spectators saves the day.
A good habit, this afternoon's gath
ering of the Rugby fans to clock the
paces of the football favorites. Better
things they could do, and others are
doing them —a hundred in the gymna
sium, half that many on the baseball
field, a score at soccer—but since so
many lack initiative, these mid-week
games offer an easy habit that has not
the dullavd's joylessness. If the inter
class finals are a pleasing draught,
take another on Wednesday.
