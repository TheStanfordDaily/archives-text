# A 						Bureau of Accuracy
## 
### 
We might use "Mortal is prone to
error" as a straw on which to lean, but
that would be poor newspaper policy.
It could be said that it takes years of
striving for accuracy to acquire the art
of being inaccurate on occasions, and
that would invite criticism whenever
the loophole appeared. So since frank
ness is a quality usually commended,
we have adopted honesty as the best
policy far our revised rules of proced
ure.
A new department of the Daily Palo
Alto is hereby created: a department
without editor or assistant or fixed
head, yet one that is to be an inte
gral part. It is the "Bureau of Ac
curacy and Fair Play."
No reporter shall direct it, yet all
will be held responsible, and the ser
vice of the reading public will be its
excuse for existence; errors are to be
corrected as soon as discovered, and
the correction given due prominence.
News matesial at fault will be printed
again to correct erroneous impressions.
The part of the public is the checking
of our accuracy; to quote from our
first issue: "We will always welcome
broadsides of criticism, usually return
them, sometimes join forces, rarely
surrender."
