# Prince of Peace
## 
### George S. Viereck 
While the poets of America are
penning eulogies of peace and the
burds of the warring nations are more
occupied with guns than with verse
making, this poem, written in the heat
of partizanship, shrieks an unusual
note. The writer has been criticized
for his heat in describing great nations
as "wanton" and "serpent," and for
applying to the Kaiser a title generally
given to no temporal ruler; but his
motives are unquestionably sincere
and his style is direct and compelling.
O Prince of Peace, O Lord of War,
Unsheathe thy blade without a stain,
Thy holy wrath shall scatter far
The bloodhounds from thy country's
fane.
Into thy hand the sword is forced
By traitor friend and traitor foe,
On foot, on sea, and winged and horsed,
The Prince of Darkness strikes his
blow.
Crush thou the Cossack arms that
reach,
To plunge the world into the night!
Save Goethe's vision, Luther's speech,
Thou art the keeper of the Light!
May thy victorious armies rout
The savage tribes against thee
hurled,
The Czar whose scepter is the knout,
And France, the wanton of the
world.
But thy great task will not be done
Until thou vanquish utterly
The Norman brother of the Hun,
England, the Serpent of the Sea.
Against the fell barbarian horde
Thy people stand, a living wall,
Now fight for God's peace with thy
sword,
For if thou fail, a world shall fall!
