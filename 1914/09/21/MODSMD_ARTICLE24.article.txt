# BEAUTIFUL SERVICE HELD FOR CHARLES G. LATHROP
## Judge Leib Tells of High Esteem in Which Former Treasurer Was Held. 
### 
A memorial service to the memory
of the late Charles G. Lathrop was held
Sunday in Memorial Church. Mrs.
Leonard Ely opened the service with
a solo, "I Know That My Redeemer
Liveth." Judge Samuel F. Leib, a life-
Jong friend of Mr. Lathrop, gave a short
address and expressed the high esteem
in which Mr. Lathrop was held.
"Much of the burden of financial af
fairs rested upon Mr. Lathrop. He had
the entire confidence and warmest love
of his sister, and was made treasurer
of the University, and actual custodian
of all its securities.
"His heart was right. And a more
conscientious man I never knew. His
family life was a poem. He was a man
of keen sensibilities.
"It has been said that an honest man
is the noblest work of God. I fully be
lieve in the truth of that saying. And
such a man was Mr. Lathrop."
Mr. Samuel Savannah accompanied
Mrs. Ely upon the violin in "Ave
Maria." "God Shall Wipe Away All
Their Tears" was rendered by a quar
tette from San Francisco, which also,
in connection with the choir, sang
"Hlest A.re the Departed."
