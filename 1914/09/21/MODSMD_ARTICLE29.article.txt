London, Sept. 21.â€”The war office
does not comment on the condition of
the battle on the Aisne, except to say
that it is unchanged, and that the al
lies are holding. The advance of the
French to Lassignay revives the belief
that the effort to envelop von Kluk, in
Western France, may succeed. Should
this be done the right flank of the Ger
mans, now fighting on the river Aisne,
would be uncovered, forcing the retire
ment of a great portion of the German
center. The German offensive has
been smothered everywhere. The ob
ject of the German right wing, under
von Kluk, is believed to be Compiegne,
the western end of the present bat
tle.
