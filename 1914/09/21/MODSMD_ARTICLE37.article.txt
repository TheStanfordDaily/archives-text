# STANFORD PASSENGERS TELL THEIR PERSONAL HOLD-UP EXPERIENCES
## 
### 
A thrilling tale of the hold-up of last
night's Southern Pacific Lark is told
today by Professor R. W. Doane, of the
Entomology Department, and L. M.
Maurer, '13. Roth were passengers on
the train. Professor Doane said this
afternoon: "[ was standing by the
desk in the observation car, which was
the first to be entered by the masked
men. In the confusion caused by the
'hands-up' I was able to drop my watch
and purse in the waste basket by which
1 was standing.
"Maurer was relieved of the currency
in his possesison, but his watch, with
a Stanford fob, was left untouched.
The highwaymen were very amateur
ish, and extremely nervous. One of
the men saw his reflection in the mir
ror, and excitedly shouted: "Down
with that gun," to his image. This bit
of humor I did not appreciate until
later, however.
"It is interesting to think of now,
but I was standing too close to the ban
dit's gun for it to be interesting then."
