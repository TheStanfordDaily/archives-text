# MURRAY AND NORTON TAKE HURDLE HONORS IN P.A.A.
## Olympic Club Wins Interesting Meet; Murray Ties Snedigar for Individual First Place. 
### 
F. S. Murray, '16, and J. K. Norton,
'IG, two Stanford hurdlers totalled 16
points for the Cardinal in the nine
teenth annual meeting of the P. A. A.,
held on the University of California
track Saturday afternoon. Murray
placed first in both hurdle events, and
took third in the 16-pound shot put.
His team-mate, Norton, won second in
the low hurdles and finished fourth in
the high hurdles. Murray tied with
"Ollie" Snedigar, of the Olympic Club
for individual honors, with 12 points
to his credit.
The athletes bearing the winged "O"
captured first place with 66 1-2 points.
The Caledonian Club sco.red 50 points,
while the University of California
placed third with 47. Oliver Millard, of
the Olmpics, lowered the record for
the five-mile event from 26 minutes,
28 2-5 seconds, to 26 minutes, 3-5 sec
onds, and finished almost a lap ahead
of his competitors.
George Horine, ex-'l3, surpassed his
rival, Beeson, and won the running
high jump with a leap of six feet, two
inches. Nichols, of the University of
California placed second, Maker, of
California, tying Beeson for third hon
ors. George Parker, Olympic Club,
who brought Stockton High School in
to the Stanford interscholastic lime
light several years ago, won both
sprints. His time of 22 seconds flat
in the 220-yard dash equals the P. A. A.
record, held by E. P. Campbell, '13, and
T. L. Coleman, 12, former Stanford
track captains.
Murray and Norton have been train
ing earnestly ever since the opening of
college, and their condition in the meet
was such as to baffle the more experi
enced members of the club teams. The
times, 14 4-5 seconds for the 120-yard
hurdles and 26 3-5 for the longer hur
dle event, are not remarkable on first
sight, but the registering of such
marks in the autumn is very creditable,
and two wearers of the "S" lived up to
their reputations of excellence.
