## 
### 
California Freshmen bested the
Berkeley High fifteen Saturday, 16 to

who broke javelin records in both in
terscholastics last spring, opened the
game by blocking Berkeley's kick-off
and carrying the ball over for the ini
tial try in a spectacular sixty-yard run.
On the whole the game fell below
the standard set in the mid-week con
test between the first year men and St.
Ignatius, when a picked Freshman
squad secured the long end of a 16 to
4 score.
Showing mediocre form, the Califor
nia varsity downed a team composed
of the combined alumni of California
and Stanford by a 17 to 5 score. The
playing of the Berkeley Ruggers was
marred by the absence of Captain
"Chalky" McKim from the fray. Mc-
Kim watched the game from the side
lines. The following Stanford men
played: A. E. Worthy, '15; J. H. Tho
burn, '13; L. D. Sweet, '13; H. A. Hine,
