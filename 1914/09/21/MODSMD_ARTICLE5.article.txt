A letter received by Dr. Frank An
gell from "Reggie" Woodward, the
father of Rugby football on the Pacific
Coast, says: "So many of the local
players have gone to war that no
game can be arranged between Stan
ford and Vancouver this year. The
Rowing Club,"he writes, "has been
turned into a barracks, where the oars
men and football players are being
drilled for the army. Stanford men
who who have been in Vancouver
would hardly recognize the place now.
Oceanic commerce is practically
closed; the ocean steamers having
been taken by the admiralty for trans
ports. Guns, men, bugle calls, and
military bands fill the streets."
