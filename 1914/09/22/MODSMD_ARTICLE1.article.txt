# FOOTBALL RULES TO REMAIN UNCHANGED FOR COMING SEASON
## Intercollegiate Committee Refuses to Accept New Regulations Proposed by the Rugby Union, Athletic Club Concurs OLD SCORING SYSTEM HOLDS 
### 
The football rules committees, rep
resenting Stanford and California, met
Monday evening and decided that the
present intercollegiate Rugby rules
should be allowed to stand, the
changes adopted by the Rugby Union
being voted down. The new method
of scoring, four points for a try and
one for a conversion, though perhaps
reflecting the relatives values of the
two plays more accurately than the
prevalent usage, has been discarded
in favor of the standard 3 and 2-point
system. The .rule providing for an
imaginary line passing through the
center of the scrum, which must not
be passed until the ball has been
heeled out, was also voted down.
Although the Rugby Union has ap
proved the above changes, the Olympic
and Barbarian Clubs have signified
their intention of following whatever
rules the intercollegiate committee
should adopt. This prevents any
trouble about the preliminary games
scheduled with these clubs this sea
son.
It was also moved and carried that
a copy of the intercollegiate rules be
filed at each university, and that, to
prevent any misunderstandings during
the big intercollegiate contest, this
copy of the rules be submitted to the
referee a few days prior to the Big
Game. It was further decided that
any question of the interpretation of
intercollegiate rulings should be de
cided fin the grounds by the coaches
and referee.
