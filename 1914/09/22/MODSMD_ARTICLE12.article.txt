# On the Tennis Courts

In another column we print an ar
ticle on the condition and the manage
ment of the University tennis courts,
written by a man evidently interested
in the game. This verjuiced criticism
of things as they are, this stinging re
buke to the powers that handle the
purse strings, has one redeeming fea
ture—its perusal may bring home
sharply a fact long recognized by the
followers of the court game;the sport
of tennis at Stanford has far outgrown
the equipment provided.
The article in question will not bear
critical study: Six courts are now
ready for use, with nets and posts in
fair shape. For the three newer courts
first-class nets have been purchased
and are now in position, while on the
second courts the old nets are still
used for play. However, these are soon
to be replaced by new equipment,
which has been ordered, and the six
courts will then be fairly well equip
ped.
But the lesson of the game outgrow
ing the facilities is one taught each
afternoon, when the courts are all in
use and the Lilliputian bleachers are
crowded with would-be players wait
ing their turn for a set. The tennis
captain estimates that three new
courts, constructed in the best pos
sible style, would take care of the
overflow, and allow more of the white
flanneled speedsters to practice on
cuts and lobs and backhand strokes.
The expenditure of a few dollars would
provide another referee's stand for im
portant matches, would replace faulty
net ratchets, and would extend the
seating accommodations.
The actual control of the courts is
at present in the hands of the tennis
captain for the year, and on his should
ers rests the responsibility of caring
for nets in wet weather, and of paint
ing the court lines. While the direc
tion of the courts and their equipment
should be in the hands of a varsity
player as the man best qualified, the
labor involved in the upkeep should be
done by an employee of the Associated
Students, as is the case on track and
football field. It is stated that the ben
efits derived from a few days' labor
would be out of all proportion to the
negligible amount of repairs required
each month.
There should he a proper apportion
ment of funds to provide better facili
ties for the scores of students interest
ed in the game of tennis.
