# The 						Unexpected
## 
### 
These autumn days hold no sugges
tion of holiday season, yet the news of
the afternoon pictures Santa Claus, St.
Nicholas, a Lady Bountiful and a
beneficent philanthropist all rolled in
to one august body, the Honorable the
Board of Trustees. Long- promised
and long-delayed, and finally reaching
the reality of contractors' estimates,
the new gymnasium is too great a con
tribution to our collection of good
things is to be appreciated in one day.
But the actual construction will give
opportunity for all the criticism, sharp
discussion and close observation that
go to make up appreciation of a
great boon.
Here's hoping that the contractor
and the architect are not racially in
volved in the Great War, and that the
rapidity of construction is in pleasing
contrast to the slow growth of other
campus buildings.
