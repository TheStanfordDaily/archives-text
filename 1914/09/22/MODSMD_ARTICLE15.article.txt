Henry Van Dyke, professor, diplo
mat, preacher, and poet, is as well
known and well-loved throughout our
country as any living writer. He will
be remembered at Stanford by the im
pressive address which he delivered
here last year upon the occasion of
Founders' Day. The Daily Palo Alto
prints one of the most impressive of
his short poems:
Not to the swift, the race;
Not to the strong, the fight;
Not to the righteous, perfect grace;
Not to the wise, the light.
But often faltering feet
Come surest to the goal;
And they who walk in darkness meet
The sunrise of the soul.
Not from my torch the gleam,
But from the stars above;
Not from my heart, life's crystal
stream,
But from the depths of love.
