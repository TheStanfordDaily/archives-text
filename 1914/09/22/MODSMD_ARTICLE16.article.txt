To the Editor:
I wish to call your attention to a
very conspicuous failure of student
government at Stanford, and ask you
and other independent men of the Uni
versity to help create a sentiment in
the mass of the student body that will
rectify this matter.
I refer to the mismanagement of the
tennis equipment, courts, nets, etc.
Last year only three of the courts
were fit to be used —and the entire
tennis contingent had to take turns in
waiting for a court. Even the girl
members of the tennis team had to use
these three courts, because theirs were
too poor for good practice.
During the summer the three pseudo
courts were resurfaced with cheap tar
and gravel, so they are now playable,
tho considerably below par as Uni
versity courts. But now that we have
six courts we can only use three of
them—the reason being that there are
no nets for the other three. The old
nets used on the first three are so badly
worn that it is difficult to tell wheth

er a ball goes through or over. But
where are the nets for the remainder?
About a week ago one of the players
went to Manager Wilcox to see if some
thing couldn't be done. He admitted
that he had one net on hand, which he
was apparently holding for safekeeping
—but he refused to put it out unless
he had some guarantee that it would
be taken care of. Such an idea is as
absurd and ridiculous as to ask the
users of the gymnasium to keep all
the chest weights or other apparatus
or the furnace in order. It is as fool
ish as to require the Itugby players to
keep up the turf or the grand stand.
I talked with Mr. Uhls, a member of
the team, and he said the situation was
hopeless, and that individual kicks
would do no good.
Ex-Captain Sloss had the same feel
ing.
The reason I assert that this situa
tion is a conspicious failure of student
government is that a Graduate Manag
er, who is merely an employe of the
Associated Students, on a salary, is al
lowed to act like a dictator. The ques
tion is: Is the hired manager or the
Student Body in control of minor ath
letics. It seems the prevailing opinion
that the hundred or so tennis men are
to pay their student body dues and get
no voice whatever in the expenditure
of their money in tfieir own interest.
I propose, therefore, that men inter
ested in fair play, as well as tennis,
urge on the leaders of the Student
Body:
1. That tennis be represented on the
Executive Committee.
2. That replacement of worn net
equipment be not at the discretion of
the Graduate Manager—to be replaced
or not as the whim strikes him —but
be made a definite program.
3. That new tennis nets be put on all
six courts at once, and the pulleys re
newed.
4. That all tennis enthusiasts refuse
to pay student body dues until some
improvement is made.

keep up the turf or the grand stand.
I talked with Mr. Uhls, a member of
the team, and he said the situation was
hopeless, and that individual kicks
would do no good.
Ex-Captain Sloss had the same feel
ing.
The reason I assert that this situa
tion is a conspicious failure of student
government is that a Graduate Manag
er, who is merely an employe of the
Associated Students, on a salary, is al
lowed to act like a dictator. The ques
tion is: Is the hired manager or the
Student Body in control of minor ath
letics. It seems the prevailing opinion
that the hundred or so tennis men are
to pay their student body dues and get
no voice whatever in the expenditure
of their money in tfieir own interest.
I propose, therefore, that men inter
ested in fair play, as well as tennis,
urge on the leaders of the Student
Body:
1. That tennis be represented on the
Executive Committee.
2. That replacement of worn net
equipment be not at the discretion of
the Graduate Manager—to be replaced
or not as the whim strikes him —but
be made a definite program.
3. That new tennis nets be put on all
six courts at once, and the pulleys re
newed.
4. That all tennis enthusiasts refuse
to pay student body dues until some
improvement is made.

I wish to call your attention to a
very conspicuous failure of student
government at Stanford, and ask you
and other independent men of the Uni
versity to help create a sentiment in
the mass of the student body that will
rectify this matter.
I refer to the mismanagement of the
tennis equipment, courts, nets, etc.
Last year only three of the courts
were fit to be used —and the entire
tennis contingent had to take turns in
waiting for a court. Even the girl
members of the tennis team had to use
these three courts, because theirs were
too poor for good practice.
During the summer the three pseudo
courts were resurfaced with cheap tar
and gravel, so they are now playable,
tho considerably below par as Uni
versity courts. But now that we have
six courts we can only use three of
them—the reason being that there are
no nets for the other three. The old
nets used on the first three are so badly
worn that it is difficult to tell wheth

er a ball goes through or over. But
where are the nets for the remainder?
About a week ago one of the players
went to Manager Wilcox to see if some
thing couldn't be done. He admitted
that he had one net on hand, which he
was apparently holding for safekeeping
—but he refused to put it out unless
he had some guarantee that it would
be taken care of. Such an idea is as
absurd and ridiculous as to ask the
users of the gymnasium to keep all
the chest weights or other apparatus
or the furnace in order. It is as fool
ish as to require the Itugby players to
keep up the turf or the grand stand.
