## 
### 
Washington, Sept. 22.â€”1t is learned
that the delay of the evacuation of Vera
Cruz is caused by French claims of
part of the customs General Funston
collected while in charge of the port.
The American troops will not evacuate
until the matter is settled. French
financiers are making this claim for
security on their loan to Huerta.
