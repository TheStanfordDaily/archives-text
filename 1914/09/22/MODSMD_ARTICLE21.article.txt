Under the direction of Captain Deke
Gard, the forwards, consisting of the
Greys and Blacks and the First and
Second Freshman teams, were afforded
excellent practice yesterday afternoon.
Particular attention was paid to drib
bling, lineouts and heeling the ball.
Coach Floyd Brown took the backs
representing the same fifteens and put
them through a stiff workout. Especial
heed was given to teaching the various
methods of attack. Snappy passing
and accurate cross-kicking received
the greatest attention.
Teams A and B played an improved
game on the Auxiliary field, with Stub
by Stolz and Jimmy Thoburn teaching
them the finer points of Rugby. The
score was 10 to 0 in favor of the play
ers representing Team A.
A number of the varsity men were
kept out of the regular workout yester
tay on account of minor injuries. Those
limited to light practice were Wiley,
Soper, Clover, Rehm, Sargent, and
Hall.
