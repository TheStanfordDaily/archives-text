# RUNLESS HITS SCORED BY HARPS AND BIRDS
## 
### 
The Colts ended their first series of
games with the Birds with a strong
kick yesterday afternoon, corraling
three out of the five contests. The
sco.re was 7-3, although hits were six
for the Birds and four for the Colts.
Tight fielding on the part of the latter
team, and Cram's pitching in the
pinches, kept the score down.
A tale of three runs and two hits
for the Feds and two runs and four
hits for the Harps, would indicate
that there must be some strings loose
in the latter's fielding machine. Mattei
struck out ten men for the Feds.
The standing of the teams follows:
Team. Won. Lost. Pc.t
Colts 3 2 .GOO
Feds 3 2 .600
Harps 2 3 .400
Birds 2 3 .400
