# Gymnasium Field Cleared for Soccer.
## 
### 
The old Gymnasium field has been
the varsity track, has been thoroughly
cleaned of its summer growth of weeds,
in addition to being carefully scraped
and leveled. It is now in shape for the
fall soccer practice, and will be used
for the out-of-door gymnasium work
throughout the year.
