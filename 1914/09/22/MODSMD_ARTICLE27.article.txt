# ST. IGNATIUS MEETS 1918 IN WEDNESDAY CONTEST
## FRESHMAN LINEUP PRACTICALLY UNCHANGED. Visiting Fifteen Will Make Its Debut Before Stanford Rugby Fans Tomorrow. 
### 
The freshman players are slated to
play their fourth game of the season
with the St. Ignatius team on the turf
tomorrow afternoon at 4:45. On ac
count of their defeat last Saturday at
the hands of the Oakland High School
team, the baby aggregation may be
expected to put up a much better
game of Rugby.
St. Ignatius will introduce its foot
ball team for the first time to Stan
ford Rugby enthusiasts. For this rea
son it is entirely a matter of conjec
ture as to how strong a fifteen they
will put into the field.
Only one change has been made in
the 1918 line-up from that of last Sat
urday. Henry, who has been on the
sick list for the past few days, will re
sume his old position at front .rank.
The referee for tomorrow's contest
has not as yet been definitely selected,
but the burden of awarding the pen
alties will doubtless fall on either
Stubby Stolz or Ric Templeton.
The line-up for the 1918 team fol
lows :
Henry, Slocum, Stevick (Hains),
Cole (McCloskey), Eaton (Ford), Fish
er (Hoever), McArthur (Boyd), Card
