# BIDS FOR NEW GYMNASIUM TO BE ENTERED TOMORROW
## Start of Building Now Matter of Weeks. Dr. Stolz Estimates Value of Structure to Physical Welfare 
### 
The Board of Trustees has made ev
ery effort in planning for the new gym
nasium to make it suit tiie climatic
conditions of this peculiar latitude and
longitude. The emphasis is placed up
on indoor games and exercises ami
upon comfortable and hygienic dress
ing rooms and shower baths.
It is difficult to prophecy how great
will lie the impetus which the new
gymnasium will give to outdoor and in
door sport. It will he the center of all
physical training, and the ample show
er and locker accommodations should
attract many men who are not accus
tomed to stretch their legs and their
lungs of an afternoon.—H. It. Stolz.
Contractors' bids for construction of
the new Stanford gymnasium will be
submitted at the business office at San
Francisco tomorrow. Consideration of
he offers received will ocupy the meet
ing of the Board of Trustees next Fri
day evening, .lust how soon actual
construction will be commenced will
depend on the time necessary for let
ting contracts to the greatest ad
vantage. Quite likely a committee in
charge of construction will be appoint
ed Friday, and will be empowered to
supervise the building.
On the long distance telephone this
morning Vanderlyn Stow, business
manager of the University, confirmed
the report that offers would soon be
made. Further information has been
ecured by wire from.1. J. Bakewell, Jr.,
senior member of the firm of Bakewell

& Brown, architects. Mr. Bakewell
made the following definite statement
concerning progress which will lie
gained in the construction work:
"Wednesday is the day set for con
tractors to submit their offers. Pro
posals will be considered for all de
partments of the structure, except
plumbing, heating, electrical equip
ment, and tile roofing. Acceptance of
the most suitable bids will, of course,
occupy the earliest attention of the
Trustees."
Treasurer Stow stated this morning
that the drawings and specifications
last submitted by Bakewell & Brown
are satisfactory, and will be closely
followed in building.
Considerable delay has been caused
by the fact that specifications formerly
figured by the architects exceeded the
maximum expenditure of $100,000,
which was set early in May. Other
wise work would have been started
last month.
The drawings which are now ac
cepted by the Trustees avoid an extra
expense of $40,000 without material
curtailment of form or convenience of
the gymnasium. Brown brick will be
the material used. An extra reinforced
steel frame will support the walls of
the building, which will occupy one
story space The architectural plans
call for a structure in keeping with
other campus buildings, which will be
typically Californian.
The structure will occupy the tri
angular space to the right of the power
house, in front of the football turf,
and will face the bleachers. Besides
administrative offices for members of
the department, and probably for the
graduate manager, the building will
contain many advantages unique on the
coast.
There will be locker accommodations
for eve.ry man in the University, and
fifty shower baths, located at each end
of the rectangular main building.
Leading off at the rear toward En
cina, will be a roofed drill hall, which
may be opened on all sides. Further
back will be placed a large open drill
court.
Spacious halls will cut the structure
from all sides, and interior arrange
ments will fit the gymnasium to be
what it is intended to be—a center of
active athletic life.
There will be abundant space for
basketball courts at one end of the en
closed drill room. Space at the other
end will be reserved for a swimming
pool, which it is hoped will be an add
ed benefit.

cina, will be a roofed drill hall, which
may be opened on all sides. Further
back will be placed a large open drill
court.
Spacious halls will cut the structure
from all sides, and interior arrange
ments will fit the gymnasium to be
what it is intended to be—a center of
active athletic life.
There will be abundant space for
basketball courts at one end of the en
closed drill room. Space at the other
end will be reserved for a swimming
pool, which it is hoped will be an add
ed benefit.
The Board of Trustees has made ev
ery effort in planning for the new gym
nasium to make it suit tiie climatic
conditions of this peculiar latitude and
longitude. The emphasis is placed up
on indoor games and exercises ami
upon comfortable and hygienic dress
ing rooms and shower baths.
It is difficult to prophecy how great
will lie the impetus which the new
gymnasium will give to outdoor and in
door sport. It will he the center of all
physical training, and the ample show
er and locker accommodations should
attract many men who are not accus
tomed to stretch their legs and their
lungs of an afternoon.—H. It. Stolz.
Contractors' bids for construction of
the new Stanford gymnasium will be
submitted at the business office at San
Francisco tomorrow. Consideration of
he offers received will ocupy the meet
ing of the Board of Trustees next Fri
day evening, .lust how soon actual
construction will be commenced will
depend on the time necessary for let
ting contracts to the greatest ad
vantage. Quite likely a committee in
charge of construction will be appoint
ed Friday, and will be empowered to
supervise the building.
On the long distance telephone this
morning Vanderlyn Stow, business
manager of the University, confirmed
the report that offers would soon be
made. Further information has been
ecured by wire from.1. J. Bakewell, Jr.,
senior member of the firm of Bakewell

& Brown, architects. Mr. Bakewell
made the following definite statement
concerning progress which will lie
gained in the construction work:
"Wednesday is the day set for con
tractors to submit their offers. Pro
posals will be considered for all de
partments of the structure, except
plumbing, heating, electrical equip
ment, and tile roofing. Acceptance of
the most suitable bids will, of course,
occupy the earliest attention of the
Trustees."
Treasurer Stow stated this morning
that the drawings and specifications
last submitted by Bakewell & Brown
are satisfactory, and will be closely
followed in building.
Considerable delay has been caused
by the fact that specifications formerly
figured by the architects exceeded the
maximum expenditure of $100,000,
which was set early in May. Other
wise work would have been started
last month.
The drawings which are now ac
cepted by the Trustees avoid an extra
expense of $40,000 without material
curtailment of form or convenience of
the gymnasium. Brown brick will be
the material used. An extra reinforced
steel frame will support the walls of
the building, which will occupy one
story space The architectural plans
call for a structure in keeping with
other campus buildings, which will be
typically Californian.
The structure will occupy the tri
angular space to the right of the power
house, in front of the football turf,
and will face the bleachers. Besides
administrative offices for members of
the department, and probably for the
graduate manager, the building will
contain many advantages unique on the
coast.
There will be locker accommodations
for eve.ry man in the University, and
fifty shower baths, located at each end
of the rectangular main building.
Leading off at the rear toward En
cina, will be a roofed drill hall, which
may be opened on all sides. Further
back will be placed a large open drill
court.
