tickets to the Sword and Sandals play,
"Men and Women." insures the finan
cial success of the production. The

F. L. Mathieu will put the finishing
touches on the production. New scen
ery has been placed on the Assembly
Hall stage, which will elaborately pic

drama. The players have now mas

Each part offers opportunities for
clever acting, and the members of
Sword and Sandals may be counted nit
on to use them to the greatest ad
vantage.
Whether stirred to the depths of
emotion o.r moved by the sheer joy of
living, Helasco's characters are the
types in whom one immediately feels a
personal interest. The men are the
type whom one meets in any large
American city, while few more delight

ful women have been characterized in
any drama than those in "Men and Wo
men."
Helasco expresses the same rare
sense of the dramatic in this play that
distinguishes his later successes, "The
Girl of the Golden West," "The Darling
of the Gods," and"The Music Mas
ter."
The Alhambra Corridor, adjoining
the art. gallery and parlor of "Mrs.
Kate Delafield" presents an artistic
background for the second act, where
a reception and dance ate in full sway.
The women of the cast will have an ex
cellent opportunity to display their
