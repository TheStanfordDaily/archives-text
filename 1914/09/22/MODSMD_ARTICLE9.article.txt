United Press Telegraphic Report
Berlin (via Rome), Sept. 22. —All tel
egraphic connection with Breslau has
suddenly ceased. It is feared that the
Russian center may possibly have ad
vanced, attacking Breslau, but it seems
incredible that the Russians should
have gotten as far into Germany as
Breslau, which is sixty miles from the
border, because Breslau is the second
fortified city the enemy would have to
encounter, and is a link in the chain
of the forts of the river Oder district.
Turning Movement Succeeding.
Paris, Sept. 22. —Indications are that
the German right, under von Kluk, has
been forced to assume a nearly north
and south position, to prevent the Teu
ton right center, in the vicinity of
Noyon and Soissons, the right of the
army participating in the battle of the
Aisne, from being crumpled by flank
attacks. Von Kluk has been forced to
use all the reinforcements obtainable
to slow up the turning movement of
the allies. Had the movement suc
ceeded earlier it would have forced the
surrender of von Kluk's forces, and
also those under von Buelow, operat
ing from Rheims to Noyon. Weather
conditions are much improved.
Kaiser Nenr End of String.
London, Sept. 22.—Military experts
believe that the German lines are
crumbling under the hammering of the
guns of the allies. They think that
the failure of reinforcements to reach
von Kluk, in the west, upon whose
ability to hold depends the outcome of
the present battle on the Aisne, which
eight days of direct frontal attack has
failed to decide, shows that the Teu
tons are "near the end of their string."
It is announced that the German right
is being pushed back at the rate of
fou.r miles per day.
Three British Cruisers Sunk.
London, Sept. 22. —England lost three
cruisers today as the result of their
encounter with a German submarine.
The cruiser Aboukir, patrolling in the
North Sea, was struck by a torpedo
sent by a German submarine. The
cruisers Hogue and C.ressy began to
rescue the survivors floating in the
water. These men-of-war were lower
ing boats when the submarine launched
more torpedos and sank the remaining
cruisers. The cruisers were almost
blown to pieces, but many destroyers
and trawlers nearby rescued the crews.
The approximate cost of the cruisers
is four million dollars each.
Verdun Now Being Bombarded.
Berlin (via The Hague), Sept. 22. —
The war office says that the,re have
been only unimportant changes in the
west; that the German movement to
take Rheims continues; and that the
Germans have taken the heights of
Craonne, about the city of Verdun on
the river Meuse, near Lorraine, and
that that city is isolated and is being
bombarded.
