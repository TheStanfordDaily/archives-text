### 
The announcement of plans for three
important functions to be staged dur
ing the next two months, namely, the
annual sophomore play, the co
tillion and the jolly-up, has start
ed the 1917 festive ball a-rolling.
Committees who will have charge
of each of these attractions, have
been appointed by President F.
O. Rose. Since several meet
ings of the various committees have
already been held, much progress has
been made toward completion of the
3 917 activities.
"Ready Money," a comedy full of life
and startling situations, by James
Montgomery, which is at present meet
ing with splendid success in stock, is
the play selected by those in charge of
the dramatic aspirations of the class.
The production, which is of three acts
duration, is continually bubbling over
with humor and surprises. The com
mittee chosen to superintend the play
is composed of L. \V. Miller, chairman,
O. O. Lachmund, M. C. McGilvray, E. H.
Evans, and Misses Esther Live.rsidge,
Florence Knapp and Dorothy Hume.
November 20 has been announced as
the date for staging the production.
Try-outs for parts in the cast will
take place next Tuesday and Wednes
day afternoon, beginning at 1:10, and
continuing throughout the afternoon,
at Alpha Phi house. F. L. Mathieu,
who has had charge of so many Stan
ford productions, has been secured as
coach.
The Sophomore Cotillion is sched
uled to take place on November 25, the
Wednesday previous to Thanksgiving
vacation. Encina Hall will again be
used for the annual dance. The com
mittee appointed by President Rose to
take charge consists of A. H. McEuen,
chairman, G. K. Scovel, W. H.
Pennett, N. R. Jensen, Misses
Margaret Evans, Nana Stevick, and
Dorothy Metz. The prices of tick
ets will not be definitely settled upon
by the committee until the total ex
penditure necessary is known.
Two weeks from next Friday even
ing, October 9, has been set for the
date of the jolly-up. Several rather
unique stunts have been arranged to
.muse the dancers during the intermis
sion, one feature of the entertainment
planned being a dramatic sketch by P.
M. Melvin, '17, and M. P. Detels, '11.
The following sophomores will have
charge of the informal: E. R. Beal,
chairman, W. F. Swett, J. S. Higley,
Ullsses Anita Allen. Phyllis Ellison, and
Katherine Leonard.
This afternoon the sophomore class
met to receive reports of the play, co
tillion and jolly-up committees. The
play committee has already wired for
manuscripts, and these are on the way
from New York. The class voted one
hundred dollars to be used in getting
plans for the play under way. Because
of the paucity of sophomore women, it
was decided to invite all freshmen and
transfer women to the jolly-up. A com
mittee was appointed to select the
class pipes.
