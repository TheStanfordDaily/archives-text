United Press Telegraphic Report
Paris, Sept. 23. —Military experts
here announce that as the forces under
von Kluk have been pushed back out
of alignment with the rest of the Ger
man troops, the balance of the German
army must retire o,r take chances of
being enveloped.
London, Sept. 23.—Experts here are
awaiting the announcement that the
enemy has withdrawn its lines just in
side the northern border of France, al
though it is admitted that the battle
may last for as much as two days more.
It is believed that, at least part of the
Germans have retired to new positions
along the Sanib.re on the Belgian bor
der.
Teuton ltetreat Expected Soon.
Paris, Sept. 23.—A statement from
the war office follows: "The left
wing of the allies is steadily advancing
against the Germans commanded by
General von Kluk. This portion of our
line, by determined, and sometimes
even by hand-to-hand fighting, suc
ceeded in gaining ten miles along the
right bank of the river Oise, which has
heretofore shielded the right flank of
the enemy engaged in the battle of the
Aisne. The movement at this point,
which is enveloping and flanking the
right of the enemy, is progressing as
planned by the commander-in-chief.
The Germans again attacked in force
today the French line to the northeast
i of Verdun, but the French, by a series
| of brilliant counter attacks, finally re
pulsed them.
Circle Closes on von Kluk.
Bordeaux, Sept. 23. —The French war
office makes the positive declaration
that von Kluk's army is in momentary
danger of isolation, due to the turning
of the German right flank. Reinforce
ments rushing to his succor via Bel
gium are now unable to prevent von
Kluk's retreat, sines his forces are now
well nigh encircled by the attacking
I allies. The combined armies of both
the French and British outnumber the
enemy two to one, as there are over a
million allies engaged on the battle
line along the Aisno, and a half million
| mo,re hold in reserve.
