"Increased service means increased
expense;" while the modern efficiency
engineer may question this statement,
the fact remains that in the present
case—that of the Daily Palo Alto —the
monthly expense total is in exact pro
portion to the 'run' of the issue and to
the amount of type set. It follows that
the cost of each issue is greatly in
creased, and, in addition, the outlay
for telegraphic reports is ten per cent
of the total per diem.
To offset this balance on the wrong
side of the ledger an effort is being
made to lengthen the circulation lists,
to add several hundred names to the
roll of subscribers. On the campus the
proportion of papers delivered to En
cina Hall, Roble and Madrono, is one
copy for every two students —a larger
subscription list could neither be asked
nor desired. But in the fraternity and
sorority chapter houses the delivery
for the past year has averaged one
copy to every six students, with one
subscription mailed to tne University
of California chapter. It is to these
last readers, then, that we appeal for
subscriptions.
Each chapter house has been asked
to increase the number of copies deliv
ered each evening by fifty per cent,
making the average six papers to each
group of approximately twenty-four
students. The business management
believes that this a fair and reasonable
request, and rests the case on its
merits.
