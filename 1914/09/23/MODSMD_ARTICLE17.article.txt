# Keep Sweet

### 
The following verses of optimism are
voiced by Mr. Gilliland in"The Speak
er," a collection of modern and classic
poems:
Don't be foolish and get sour when
things don't just come your way.
Don't be a pampered baby and declare,
"Now, I won't play."
Just go grinning on and bear it;
Have you heartache? Millions share
it;
If you earn a crown, you'll wear it;
Keep sweet.
Don't go handing out your trouble to
your busy fellow-men —
'112 you whine around they'll try to keep
from meeting you again,
Don't declare the world's "agin"
you,
Don't let pessimism win you,
Prove there's lots of good stuff in
you—
Keep sweet.
If your dearest hopes seem blighted
and despair looms into view,
Set your jaws and whisper grimly,
"Though they're false, yet I'll be
true."
Never let your heart grow bitter;
With your lips to Hope's transmit
ter,
Hear Love's songbirds bravely twit
ter,
"Keep sweet."
Bless your heart, this world's a good
one, and will always help a
man;
Mate, misanthropy, and malice have no
place in Nature's plan.
Help your brother there who's sigh
ing;
Keep his flag of courage flying;
Help him try—'twill keep you try
ing.
Keep sweet.
—Strickland W. Gillilan.
