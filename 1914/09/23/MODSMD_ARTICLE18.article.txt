# Educator Urges Broader View in Choice of Study

### 
Albert Duncan Yokum, professor of
Educational Research and Practice at
the University of Pennsylvania, is well
known in scholastic circles as an au
thor and writer of repute .In the Sep
tember number of The Educational Re
view he deals in an interesting article
with determination of the course of
study. His remarks in part a.re as fol
lows:
The most serious weakness of pres
ent-day education on the side of neu
tral training is its failure to compel
what is most useful; its lack of per
sistency in the development or tastes
and ideals through cumulative impres
sion, its lack of the drill and continuity
adequate to the building up of a per
manently essential habit and system,
its failure to ensure the conditions fa
vorable to general application.
The fundamental distinction neces
sary to course-of-study-making is be
tween mental training, general knowl
edge, discipline o.r culture, and direct
and definite preparation for life. While
direct preparation for life consists in
mental training, mental training does
not necessarily prepare for the various
phases of life. Indeed the more learned
and intelligent he is, the greater the
menace he may be to the community
and the state.
Nothing, then, can be more obvious
than the inconceivable folly of sub
stituting the exhaustive study of a few
branches as elementary wholes, with
thei.r great mass of relatively useless
details, for the partial study of all
branches in general. A fallacious seek
ing after thoroughness in the sense of
exhaustive detail, for the sake of dis
cipline, has defeated its own purpose.
