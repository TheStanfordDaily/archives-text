# FOREIGN LABORERS WISH TO LEARN ENGLISH TONGUE
## Stanford Students to Aid Y. M. C. A. in Plans of Industrial Service Movement. 
### 
Italian and Greek laborers in the
tannery industries at Redwood have
petitioned Stanford students to teach
them English. There are nearly two
hundred of these foreigners, many of
whom speak nothing but their native
tongue, and it is this class who desire to
be aided. The appeal was sent in to
Alexander Davis, '14, acting extension
secretary of the Y. M. C. A., and defi
nite plans are already under way to
grant their petition.
The laborers first sent in a request
to the Board of Education for a public
night school. This was refused, but
the board has offered them the use of
the public school buildings for then
classes, provided they can obtain their
own teachers. This offer will be taken
advantage of. All students who are
interested are requested to communi
cate with Davis or with Secretary E.
H. Lockwood, of the Y. M. C. A.
The Roberts system of teaching will
be used. This system requires no
knowledge of the foreigners' native
language, in order to be an efficient
instructor for them.
This work is a part of the industrial
service movement in which students of
practically all of the universities of
the world are participating. Last year
over 150 students at Yale alone were
engaged in it .
