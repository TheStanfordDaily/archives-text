God bless the new gym!
Come to think of it, that makes two
wins for 1914. Congrats, seniors, and
the linesmen were of 1917 at that!
Without a doubt, a few things were
mentioned about tennis in last even
ing's Daily. Now for net results.
To be frank with you, everybody,
'tisn't 'tall nice to walk on the football
turf after games. And it's terribly
hard on the grass, and sets a bad ex
ample to the blackbirds. Don't do it,
anybody.
It. would seem that there is good
motive back of the action,or rather non
action, taken by the football rules
committee regarding the proposed
changes in scoring. At any rate, it'll
make things lots easier on November
14 for the army of amateur Archie
Rices which'll swarm 'pon the big
Berkeley lawn.
F/om all appearances the Berkeley
bunch will surprise us one o' these
days with the changes which have
taken place on their hillside, and the
changes which are contemplated.
There's that muchly-heralded turf field,
and it wasn't transplated, either. Home
grown, they call it. And the tennis
courts have been torn up to make room
for the new track. And work on the
new courts is progressing rapidly.
It'll be an interesting journey next No
vember, if only for the scenery.
God bless the new gym!
