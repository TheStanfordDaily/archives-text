# MANDOLIN CLUB CHOOSES SEVENTEEN NEW MEMBERS
## Unusual Array of Talent Augurs a Successful Year for Campus Harmonizers. 
### 
Much new talent was on hand at the
initial try-out of the Mandolin Club
last evening. From these a tentative list
of seventeen men was chosen. Owing
to the fact that the club will be larger
than ever this year, men who were not
present last night are u.rged to come
out as soon as possible.
The unusual interest shown in the
club this year is partly due to the fact
that several attractive trips are sched
uled and that, for the first time in
years, a long eastward journey seems
certain to be taken next summer.
