## FINAL INTERCLASS MATCH IS GRUELLING FIGHT. Sophomore Defense Proves Hard to Pass—Strong Partisan Spirit Added Attraction. 
### 
During a tumult of class enthusiasm,
the Senior Rugby team climbed to the
top side of a 21 to 5 score over 1917
yesterday afternoon, and won the in
terclass championship.
No one doubts that the teams played
hard, and that some incidents of the
game were the brand of good Rugby.
All phases of the contest were inter
esting, because the joy of conflict
was enough value in itself, all football
aside.
The seniors had a good delegation
from the ranks of the varsity to de
pend on, and though the underclass
men were not without aid f.roni the
same source, their exhibition was none
the less creditable to the fighting
spirit of a forlorne hope.
Dievendorf, sophomore wing, made
the first move of the defensive game
by saving early in the half, and a sec
ond danger was averted when the
second-year forwards dribbled sixty
yards and held play at center.
For seven minutes there was little
to choose. Then West, 1917 fullback,
dropped a kick, and the ball was swept
away by Davis, who passed to Gard
for try after a thirty-five yard sprint.
Templeton failed to convert, making
the score 4 to 0.
Davis* forehead was badly cut by a
misplaced kick when covering the ball
alter a scrum near center field. Reeves
took his place at first five, and was re
placed by Wynne at left wing.
The second score resulted from a
passing run in close territory, in
which Templeton, Burns and Andrews
figured. Templeton failed to convert
from a sharp angle.
First half scoring ended when
Wynne threw in to Rehm at a fifteen
yard lineout, and the forward returned
to him for the try. Templeton found
the lane between the bars, and left
the record at 13-0.
Numerous changes in the Sopho
more line at the first of the second
half gave 1917 a fresh spurt. The con
test was fairly even until Templeton
surprised the bleachers with a little of
"that New Zealand stuff," by dropping
over from thirty-five yards. Score 17-
0.
Lachmund achieved the only try
made against the seniors late in the
second period. A fifty-yard series of
short dribbling kicks carried him safe
ly past Tilton's defense for four points.
West added one tally by conversion.
Scoring ended when Andrews went
over for his second try. after a pass
ing rush, in which Templeton and
Wynne handled the ball. Templeton's
kick went wide, leaving the final score
at 21 to 5.
