# STANFORD WILL UPHOLD AFFIRMATIVE IN DEBATE
## Intercollegiate Aspirants Choose Side of Question to Be Argued With California. 
### 
Stanford debaters have chosen the
affirmative side of the question to be
debated with California on the Friday
afte.r the Big Game. This decision was
reached last evening at a meeting of
all the men who are trying-out for the
Intercollegiate debating team. The dis
cussion was hsld after the regular
meeting of the Nestoria and Euphronia
Debating Societies.
The Intercollegiate question: "Re
solved, that California should abolish
state-wide initiative and referendum,"
was decided negatively by Nestoria in
a somewhat informal debate at the
regular meeting of that body. Never
theless, it is the opinion of a majority
of the debaters that the affirmative
side of the proposition may be upheld
to the best advantage.
