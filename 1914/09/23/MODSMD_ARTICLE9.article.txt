# ST. IGNATIUS NO MATCH FOR EIGHTEEN RUGGERS.
## BEAUTIFUL PASSING RUSHES BY FRESHMEN BACKFIELD FEATURE CONTEST SCORE BOARD REGISTERS 13 TO 0 CLASS OF 1918 PROVES ABILITY TO PUT UP CONSISTENT GAME OF RUGBY. 
### 
The Freshman team proved today
that it can serve us a good game of
rugby rather consistently by stealing,
St. Ignatius' option to a 13-0 victory.
In both the forward and backfield de
partments the Freshmen had a good
margin of skill though their oppo
nents would tip the scales on them
almost man fo.r man.
The early game was kept slow by a
tendency to engage in kicking duels.
Taken all in all the match was a
good opportunity for 1918 to display
rugby ability.
The Stanford backs were fast in the
open, while the forwards did a little
better than hold their own.
Chandler opened the first period.
St. Ignatius' propensity for marking
and touch-finding slowed the game for
five minutes. Wolters, Freshman cen
ter, caused a flurry in center field by
dishing up the kick of his team mate
Fisher, and speeding to the visitors'
five-yard line, where he passed to
Kyle for the first t.rv of the game.
Fisher's boot went wide.
Eighteen's second chance at goal re
sulted from a twenty yard kick down
field by Walker, which was recovered
by Cole. His success in breaking
through gave Fisher his second chance
at conversion, which was successful.
The Catholic team hammered Stan
ford's line at half time, and Chandler
barely kept the other half of the slate
clean by a lucky fall. The score at
the end of the first period stood 9-0,
with the Cardinal babies to the fore.
Second Half
Roth fifteens settled into harness
with consistent speed, St. Ignatius'
team urged by the sting of disappoint
ment over thei.r near-try at the close
of the first half.
The opponents opened their defense
long enough for a dribbling rush start
ed at forty yards to gathe.r force and
shoot Kyle over on top the ball.
Chandler's failure at the cross bar
held the score at 13-0.
Final time caught play on the visi
tors' five yard line. Two excursions
to St. Ignatius territory in the last
stage gave the standing bleacheritos
the best interest of the match. Pass
ing between the Freshman backs
reached the starring point, but good
luck sided with the losers and held
the story at 13-0.
