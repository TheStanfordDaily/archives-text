# MARTIN WRITES LETTER
## DEPICTS WAR EXCITEMENT IN SWITZERLAND Stanford Professor Temporarily Exiled While Compiling History of Brazil in Extensive Libraries of London and Paris 
### 
Another first-hand account of the
frightful condition of affaire in Europe
has reached the campus in a letter that
has just been received at President
Branner's office from Assistant Profes
sor P. A. Martin, who has spent the
summe.r in European travel. The pro
fessor and his wife were established in
Meiringen, near Berne, the capital of
Switzerland, at the time of writing, but
expected to move into Italy during the
following week:
Martin had intended to reach Paris
by September 1, for the purpose of con
tinuing work on his "History of Bra
zil" in the National Library. This plan
has been, of necessity, abandoned, and
it is even uncertain whether he will be
able to obtain passage to London.
The ho.rrors of war add a peculiar
tang to Professor Martin's experiences,
and he states that Americans every
where are protected and treated with
the utmost courtesy. Following are
extracts from his letter:
"This frightful European war has
caught Mrs. Martin and me here in
Switzerland, just at the end of our va
cation. I had expected to be in Paris
by the first of September hard at work
in the National Library on my 'History
Of Brazil.' I had further expected to
cross to London about the middle of
October and work six weeks in Dr.
Lima's private library. But France is
hermetically sealed, and the possibili
ties of reaching -England are just now
very remote. We shall, for the time
being, remain in Switzerland and Italy,
waiting for developments * * *
"While the majority of Americans
here in Europe are nervous and hyster
ical, we are trying not to let this ter
rible war get on our nerves any more
than possible. Ten days ago Switzer
land was teeming with foreigners, the
h t•-">]s were jammed, and the railroads
■•'.-pre crowded. Now the hotels are
empty, the French and Germans are all
gore, and most of the train? have
ceased to run, while all the able-bodied
men are on the frontier, guarding
Switzerland's precious neutrality. We
are going to Italy next week, and as
soon as possible shall try to reach
either London or Paris. Needless to
say, we are in no possible danger, and
the war is, of course, of thrilling in
terest. In a way, it is all grist to my
mill, and yet the horrors of it all rests
like an incubus upon us."
