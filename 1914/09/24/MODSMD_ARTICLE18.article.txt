# Stopping the Leaks

### 
Efficiency's the word —a straight
line may lie the shortest distance be
tween two points, but it's rarely the
most efficient route to follow. The di
rect path from student body treasure
box to the disbursing pocket of the or
ganization manager may be the line of
least resistance, yet few would start
their private funds on such a greased
toboggan slide as unchecked expendi
ture proves in the majority of cases.
On the fourth page we chart the
new channel for the financial ships of
the various student activities, the
buoys and lights that Graduate Man
ager Wilcox has planned for the safe
guidance of funds apportioned from
the Associated Students' gold chest.
This light pressure of the close check
and final accounting should prove a
distinct benefit to the activities in
cluded, as for the students it is a
great stride in the direction of effi
ciency in expenditure.
A detailed system of accounting
means greater purchasing power in the
budget for the particular activity, a
penny saved is a penny earned. Other
than the cheek on disbursements there
are no strings pinned to the organiza
tion manager.
To the students the adoption of the
system should give the satisfaction
that comes to the man whose books
balance at the first trial. Who does
not begrudge the nickel that slips be
tween the boards more than the dollar
that goes for luxury?
A small leak will sink a great ship—
modern accounting is good caulking
for the leaks.
