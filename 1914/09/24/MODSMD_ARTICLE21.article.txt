Robert Service came over the trail
with the Bonanza rush in 1898, and has
since worked as prospector and bank
cashier in Dawson City, while inter
preting the life of the dwellers of the
North through his poetry. The follow
ing is a part of his collection of verse,
"Rhymes of a Rolling Stone:"
When you're lost in the Wild, ard
you're scared as a child,
And death looks you bang in the eys,
And you're sore as a boil, its according
to Hoyle
To cock your revolver and —die
But the Code of a Man says: "Fight all
you can,"
And self-dissolution is barred.
In hunger and woe it's easy to blow —
It's hell-served-for-breakfast that's
hard.
"You're sick of the game!" Well now
that's a shame.
You're young and you're brave and
you're bright.
"You've had a raw deal!" I know—
but don't squeal,
Buck up, do your damndest and fight,
It's the plugging away that will win
you the day,
So don't be a piker, old pard!
Just draw on your grit; it's so easy to
quit:
It's the keeping-your-chin-up that's
hard.
It's easy to cry that your beaten and —
die;
It's easy to crawfish and crawl
But to fight and to fight when hope's
out of sight—
Why, that's the best game of them
all!
And though you come out of each gru
elling bout,
All broken and beaten and scarred,
.Tust have one mo,re try—it's dead easy
to die,
It's the keeping-on-living that's hard.
