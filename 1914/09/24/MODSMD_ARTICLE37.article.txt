# UNIFORM ACCOUNTING TO GOVERN ALL ACTIVITIES
## 
### 
To facilitate the managerial work
ings of all Student Body activities
that are not under the actual super
vision of Graduate Manager R. W.
Wilcox, '13, a detailed system of hook
keeping has been advised and ap
proved by the Executive Committee. In
former years, appropriations of three
to five hundred dollars were made at
the first semester, and the Graduate
Manager was not in a position to
follow up the uses made of these
funds, owing to the very general na
ture of the reports that were turned in
at irregular intervals. Often the
amount provided for in the budget was
exhausted in the middle of the semes
ter, and incompetent managers ran up
large bills on credit, which were trans
ferred as a heavy burden to their suc
cessors in office.
This danger has been entirely obvi
ated by the adoption of the new meth
od. Expenditures must be accounted
for at the tenth of each month by the
various managers, and all purchases
must he placed in the list of bills pay
able. By this method, the Graduate
Manager has a check upon the buying
power of aÂ»i managers, and no bills
can be contracted beyond the amount
stipulated in the budget allowed by
the Executive Committee. Moreover,
succeeding managers will have an in
valuable record of all transactions
made in former years, and their du
ties will be simplified.
Organizations Affected.
The new ruling will apply especially
to the Band, the Intercollegiate Debat
ing Committee, Big Game business
(which will he conducted as a separate
activity this year), the Stunt Commit
tee, Crew and The Daily Palo Alto.
Following is a reprint of the resolu
tion as drawn up by R. W. Wilcox, and
approved by the Executive Committee:
Instructions to student organiza
tions, covering the handling of finan
cial transactions for money appro
priated by the Associated Students:
The Associated Students will pro
vide each organization with the fol
lowing equipment:
(1) Small cash book.
(2) Voucher checks in duplicate.
(3) Requisition book for purchasing.
(4) Monthly report form.
(5) One letter file.
Receipts.
(1) All moneys received by the or
ganization shall be first entered in the
cash book, stating from whom and for
what purpose received, and then im
mediately deposited in the hank. The
bank deposit must correspond with
the total receipts. No account can be
carried in the name of any officer of
the organization, but always in the

name of the organization itself.
Disbursements.
(2) All disbursements must be made
by check upon the bank in which the
funds are deposited. These checks
must be filled out in duplicate upon
the numbered forms furnished by the
Associated Students. On the left of
the voucher check is a ruled space
in which should be entered in detail
the items which total should agree
with the amount for which the check
is drawn. Each check must be signed
and countersigned by two members of
the organization, who shall be so au
thorized to do so, and whose specimen
signatures must be on file at the bank.
(3) The requisition book furnished
to the manager of the organization
contains duplicated forms numbered 1
to 50. The original is to go to the
supplier, the duplicate to the Graduate
Manager, and the triplicate remains
in the book for the purpose of audit
ing. The number and the total of the
requisition should agree in its items
and amount, with the check which is
drawn in payment of same. As soon as
a requisition is made out it is request
ed that the duplicate be immediately
placed in the possession of the Grad
uate Manager. In cases where it is the
opinion of the Graduate Manager that
an organization is purchasing beyond
the amount of the appropriation he
reserves the right to cancel the orde.r.
On the monthly report each requisition
must show as a paid bill, as indicated
by the voucher check or as a bill pay
able. A small copy of the requisition
should be signed by the people who do
the purchasing, and sent to the re
spective houses with whom business is
carried on. with instructions that no
item can be charged to the account of
the organization unless such a requisi
tion, signed and countersigned by the
parties who signed the voucher checks,
is presented with the order.
(4) Upon the monthly report form
supplied by the Associated Students,
the manager of the organization must
make out in detail the disbursements
for each month, and file same with the
Graduate Manager before the tenth of
each month. Particular care must be
used so that all moneys owing to, as
well as moneys owing by, the organiza
tion are correctly showing at the end
of each month. The form for this is
shown on the back of the monthly re
port under the head of accounts re
ceivable and accounts payable, respec
tively. Acounts payable should coin
cide with the requisition duplicates,
which are kept, by the Graduate Man
ager for comparison.
(.">) A letter file is to lie given
each organization with instructions
that all correspondence and business
pertaining to said organization be filed
in alphabetical order, and at the end
of each semester deposited at the of
fice of the Graduate Manager so the
same can be turned over to the right
officers for the ensuing semester.
All the above equipment satisfactor
ily balanced shall be deposited with
the Graduate Manager.
