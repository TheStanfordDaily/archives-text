# PLAYERS ARE NOW READY
## "MEN AND WOMEN" AWAIT CURTAIN CALL Elaborate Sets of Scenery Will Form Artistic Background For Sword and Sandals Tomorrow Evening in the Assembly Hall 
### 
The "Men and Women" of Belasco
and DeMille's fancy are ready for the
curtain to rise tomorrow evening and
reveal the rich interior of "Mrs. Pres
cott's" New York home, which will pic
ture the opening scene of one of the
most brilliant plays ever produced at
Stanford. The Sword and Sandals
players held their dress rehearsal on
the Assembly Hall stage last evening,
under the direction of F. L. Mathieu.
Three artistic new sets of scenery
have been painted for this production.
They are the work of E. S. Williams,
of the Alcazar Theatre studio, in San
Francisco. Williams modeled the sets
after those used in the Alcazar during
the last production of "Men and Wo
men," when David Belasco acted as
director of his brother's stock com
pany. Elaborate scenery and lighting
effects will add no small amount to the
artistic ensemble of the Sword and
Sandles production.
The lgading characters are particu
larly well cast in this production, each
player having a role suited to his in
dividual talents. P. E. Leland, '16, as
"Israel Cohen," president of the Jeffer
son National Bank, has remarkable
ability for interpreting this character,
reflecting dignity, nobility and busines
integrity. He meets the financial cri
sis in the affairs of his bank with
strength and self-control that com
mand admiration. Buford Williams,
'16,has a role of certain dramatic appeal
in "William Prescott," cashier of' the
Cohen bank, whom Belasco has char
acterized with unusual skill. Torn be
tween the conflicting emotions of love
for the Governor's daughter and duty
to bis employer and himself, "William
Prescott" is a character that will live
long in the memory of Stanford play
goers.
The leading feminine role, "Agnes
Rodman," offers Mips Terese Dorroh,
'10, a character of rare feminine
charm. Miss Neilita Choate, '17, and
Miss Frances Akin, '15, have opportu
nities to portray the strength and wo
manliness of "Mrs. Prescott" and
"Mrs. Kirke."
No more delightful juvenile roles
have been created by any dramatist
than those of "Dora Prescott" and
"Margery Knox," who play opposite
"Edward Seabury" and "Sam Dela
field." respectively. Miss Trma Ray
burn. 1f>, Miss Florence Stewart, '1(1,
W. ,T. Gross, '16, and F. V. Campbell.
'10, will interpret these attractive
parts.
The vivacity of "Mrs. Kate Dela
field," a young widow of rich attrac
tion. will be portrayed by Miss Marion
Vaughan, *16. W. G. Paul. '15, will
play the jovial bank examiner, "Colo
nel Zachary T. Kip," whose heart is
won by the charms of "Mrs. Dela
field." His .role will afford him unusu
al comedy chances.
L. A. Dayton, '10, has a forceful part
as "Governor Rodman," while R. N.
Wenzel, '10, and L. E. Cole. '17, will
portray the interesting personalities
of "Stendman" and "Pendleton." re
spectively. Sherwood Chapman. '10.
has a dramatic bit as "Arnold Kirke."
r I hose who will appear in minor
roles are Miss Beatrice Russell, '17. S.
A. Cundiff, '15, H. C. Buffum, 18, Alvin I
Pruett., '10. and P. 11. Dowling, '10

The "Men and Women" of Belasco
and DeMille's fancy are ready for the
curtain to rise tomorrow evening and
reveal the rich interior of "Mrs. Pres
cott's" New York home, which will pic
ture the opening scene of one of the
most brilliant plays ever produced at
Stanford. The Sword and Sandals
players held their dress rehearsal on
the Assembly Hall stage last evening,
under the direction of F. L. Mathieu.
Three artistic new sets of scenery
have been painted for this production.
They are the work of E. S. Williams,
of the Alcazar Theatre studio, in San
Francisco. Williams modeled the sets
after those used in the Alcazar during
the last production of "Men and Wo
men," when David Belasco acted as
director of his brother's stock com
pany. Elaborate scenery and lighting
effects will add no small amount to the
artistic ensemble of the Sword and
Sandles production.
The lgading characters are particu
larly well cast in this production, each
player having a role suited to his in
dividual talents. P. E. Leland, '16, as
"Israel Cohen," president of the Jeffer
son National Bank, has remarkable
ability for interpreting this character,
reflecting dignity, nobility and busines
integrity. He meets the financial cri
sis in the affairs of his bank with
strength and self-control that com
mand admiration. Buford Williams,
'16,has a role of certain dramatic appeal
in "William Prescott," cashier of' the
Cohen bank, whom Belasco has char
acterized with unusual skill. Torn be
tween the conflicting emotions of love
for the Governor's daughter and duty
to bis employer and himself, "William
Prescott" is a character that will live
long in the memory of Stanford play
goers.
The leading feminine role, "Agnes
Rodman," offers Mips Terese Dorroh,
'10, a character of rare feminine
charm. Miss Neilita Choate, '17, and
Miss Frances Akin, '15, have opportu
nities to portray the strength and wo
manliness of "Mrs. Prescott" and
"Mrs. Kirke."
No more delightful juvenile roles
have been created by any dramatist
than those of "Dora Prescott" and
"Margery Knox," who play opposite
"Edward Seabury" and "Sam Dela
field." respectively. Miss Trma Ray
burn. 1f>, Miss Florence Stewart, '1(1,
W. ,T. Gross, '16, and F. V. Campbell.
'10, will interpret these attractive
parts.
The vivacity of "Mrs. Kate Dela
field," a young widow of rich attrac
tion. will be portrayed by Miss Marion
Vaughan, *16. W. G. Paul. '15, will
play the jovial bank examiner, "Colo
nel Zachary T. Kip," whose heart is
won by the charms of "Mrs. Dela
field." His .role will afford him unusu
al comedy chances.
L. A. Dayton, '10, has a forceful part
as "Governor Rodman," while R. N.
Wenzel, '10, and L. E. Cole. '17, will
portray the interesting personalities
of "Stendman" and "Pendleton." re
spectively. Sherwood Chapman. '10.
has a dramatic bit as "Arnold Kirke."
