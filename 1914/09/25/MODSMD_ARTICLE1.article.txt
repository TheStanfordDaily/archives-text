# "MEN AND WOMEN" TO TREAD BOARDS TONIGHT

### 
W. B. Owens, '14, will appear in an
important role in "Men and Women"
this evening, on only twelve hours'
notice. Owens has accepted the role
of "Calvin Steadman," counsel for the
Jefterson National Bank, in order to
assist Sword and Sandals in an emer
gency. R. N. Wenzel, '16, who was
originally cast as "Steadman," was
called to St. Louis, Missouri, last ev
ening by the serious illness of his fath
er.
Owens has played leading roles in
Stanford dramatic productions for the
past th.ree years. He appeared as
"Paste" in the senior farce, "Our
Wives," last May, and in John Drew's
former role in"The Tyranny of
Tears," which was produced by Sword

David Belasco's dramatic story of
New York life in 1890 is scheduled
for production this evening in the As
sembly Hall. Sword and Sandals So
ciety has selected a play whose worth
has been tried and proved, and will
offer a cast of sterling excellence to
interpret the various phases of the
popular comedy-drama.
Since the time of its original pro
duction by the famous Lyceum Thea
ter stock company of New York, in
whose brilliant career the Belasco-
DeMille dramas played no small part,
"Men and Women" has presented many
of the foremost American players.
The present cast has been selected
with great care by Sword and San
dals, each character being assigned
to one whose ability has been shown
in previous performances.
The climax of the play is reached in
the third act in the library of Israel
Cohen, president of the Jefferson Na
tional Bank (P. E. Leland,' 16). Dur
ing this scene a midnight meeting of
the directors is held to determine the
identity of the thief of certain valu
able securities from the bank.
Coincident with the development of
dramatic action is a conspicious
thread of romance in which Buford
Williams, '16, and Miss Terese Dor
rob, '16, are the leading figures.
The entire production is under the
direction of F. L. Mathieu, whose su
pervision assures not only an a.rtistic
presentation, but also careful atten
tion to the infinite details that play
such an important part in the success
of all Belasco dramas.
The musical program for the even
ing has been selected in order to be
in keeping with the atmosphere and
spirit of the play. The following se
lections will be rendered by the Uni
versity orchestra:
1. "Jocosity," overture A,rmand
2. "A Toi," selection Waldtenfel
3. (a) "The First Heart Throbs".,

(b) "OBelle Nuit" Offenbach
4. "Thousand and One Nights,"

W. B. Owens, '14, will appear in an
important role in "Men and Women"
this evening, on only twelve hours'
notice. Owens has accepted the role
of "Calvin Steadman," counsel for the
Jefterson National Bank, in order to
assist Sword and Sandals in an emer
gency. R. N. Wenzel, '16, who was
originally cast as "Steadman," was
called to St. Louis, Missouri, last ev
ening by the serious illness of his fath
er.
Owens has played leading roles in
Stanford dramatic productions for the
past th.ree years. He appeared as
"Paste" in the senior farce, "Our
Wives," last May, and in John Drew's
former role in"The Tyranny of
Tears," which was produced by Sword
and Sandals last fall. Owens also
played in"The "Admirable Crich
ton" and in"The Only Way" as "Syd
ney Carton," which is possibly his
greatest triumph.
David Belasco's dramatic story of
New York life in 1890 is scheduled
for production this evening in the As
sembly Hall. Sword and Sandals So
ciety has selected a play whose worth
has been tried and proved, and will
offer a cast of sterling excellence to
interpret the various phases of the
popular comedy-drama.
Since the time of its original pro
duction by the famous Lyceum Thea
ter stock company of New York, in
whose brilliant career the Belasco-
DeMille dramas played no small part,
"Men and Women" has presented many
of the foremost American players.
The present cast has been selected
with great care by Sword and San
dals, each character being assigned
to one whose ability has been shown
in previous performances.
The climax of the play is reached in
the third act in the library of Israel
Cohen, president of the Jefferson Na
tional Bank (P. E. Leland,' 16). Dur
ing this scene a midnight meeting of
the directors is held to determine the
identity of the thief of certain valu
able securities from the bank.
Coincident with the development of
dramatic action is a conspicious
thread of romance in which Buford
Williams, '16, and Miss Terese Dor
rob, '16, are the leading figures.
The entire production is under the
direction of F. L. Mathieu, whose su
pervision assures not only an a.rtistic
presentation, but also careful atten
tion to the infinite details that play
such an important part in the success
of all Belasco dramas.
The musical program for the even
ing has been selected in order to be
in keeping with the atmosphere and
spirit of the play. The following se
lections will be rendered by the Uni
versity orchestra:
