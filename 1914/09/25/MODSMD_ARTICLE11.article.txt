# WEDGE OF ALLIES MAY FORCE GERMAN RETREAT
## Turning Movement of French Around Enemies' Right Succeeding. —Allies Landing in Belgium May Isolate Invaders HARDSHIPS SICKEN KAISER Teuton General Alleged to Have Commanded "No Quarter," in Rheims Attack 
### 
Paris, Sept. 25. —The position of the
allied left is gradually changing. The
allies are constantly bombarding tho
German trenches along the Aisne and
Oise, but are not now attempting as
saults along these lines. While using
their artillery against the main lines
of battle, they are simultaneously driv
ing a wedge around the Teuton right
flank against its communication in
the rear. If the movement is success
ful von Kluk, commanding the ex
treme German right, will be cut off
from reinforcements under von Boehm
coming from Belgium, thus forcing
von Kluk on von Buelow, in command
of the right of the forces along the
Aisne. If he does not choose to fall
back on von Buelow, a chorus of ac
tion very dangerous to the entire Ger
man army, he will be compelled to
give battle surrounded on three sides.
If he does fall back, the entire left
wing of the army of invasion will be
partially surrounded, necessitating an
immediate retirement to the Sambre,
fifty miles in the rear, the next strong
military position which the Germans
may be able to hold. All of these ac
tions will result, if the French are
successful, in driving the wedge
around von Kink's right flank. This
wedge will also endanger German
communication with their base of sup
plies.

Teutons Accused of Itnrhnrism.
Bordeaux. Sept. 25—Further details of
the much-discussed bombardment of
the Rheims cathedral have beoM re
ceived. The French foreign office
charges General Stongor, in command
of the fifty-third German infantry of
issuing the order to kill all French
men. whether wounded, armed or un
armed. Alleges the order read: "The
Germans must not leave n single
Frenchman behind them."
Paris, Sept. 25. —The position of the
allied left is gradually changing. The
allies are constantly bombarding tho
German trenches along the Aisne and
Oise, but are not now attempting as
saults along these lines. While using
their artillery against the main lines
of battle, they are simultaneously driv
ing a wedge around the Teuton right
flank against its communication in
the rear. If the movement is success
ful von Kluk, commanding the ex
treme German right, will be cut off
from reinforcements under von Boehm
coming from Belgium, thus forcing
von Kluk on von Buelow, in command
of the right of the forces along the
Aisne. If he does not choose to fall
back on von Buelow, a chorus of ac
tion very dangerous to the entire Ger
man army, he will be compelled to
give battle surrounded on three sides.
If he does fall back, the entire left
wing of the army of invasion will be
partially surrounded, necessitating an
immediate retirement to the Sambre,
fifty miles in the rear, the next strong
military position which the Germans
may be able to hold. All of these ac
tions will result, if the French are
successful, in driving the wedge
around von Kink's right flank. This
wedge will also endanger German
communication with their base of sup
plies.

New York, Sept. 25.—Carnegie re
turned on the Mauretania today. Mr.
Ca.rnegie is personally acquainted with
the Kaiser, and says that he knows
what the German Emperor has done
for Germany. He states further that
it was not the Kaiser who brought on
the war, but that it was the Prussian
military machine which forced him
into it.
Zeppelin Feared by Itritish.
Ostend, Sept. 25. —Tt is feared that
the Zeppelin manuevers taking place
here forecast a raid upon London
within the next few days. British avi

of armored biplanes to attack the dir
igibles, in case any such attempt is
the part of Germany.
