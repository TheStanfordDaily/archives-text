# On the Bleachers

Why do we go to the football games?
The profit or pleasure that we find in
watching the hard play of thirty men
for two hours or more must be an ap
preciable quantity, the incentive to at
tend the game a strong one, for as
suredly there are other things to do.
A close analysis of the many motives
uppermost in the minds of the specta
tors would doubtless sift their reasons
for attendance down to two or three
influences —the love of startling action
and of the dramatic, the sporting in
terest in the outcome and the desire to
'back the team,' the lack of some
thing better to do.
One of these things must be lacking
this year, for the profit the rugby
games offer is being outweighed by
other considerations. The gate count
for the first Saturday game this sea
son was fifteen per cent below that of
the first match for the 1913 season,
while on Saturday last the cash re
ceipts were sixty-five dollars short of
the total of last year's second game. A
serious falling off, for the game and
for the students .
Three matches are on the calendar
for tomo.t'row, each game of more than
usual interest, for we know the mettle
of our opponents. There is action on
the turf—plenty of it —what is lack
ing in the bleachers?
The fifteens may play as hard and
fight as willingly before empty bleach
ers as before a crowd —they are out
for the game and are deaf to the
'railroad' and 'siren' of the sidelines.
But is past attendance the measure of
our interest in the outcome, the true
index to our sporting faith in their
skill? Will not apathy and indiffer
ence in the bleachers leave their
mark on the team by the November day
when Stanford meets the best that
California has to offer—the best that's
always good?
What psychological effect enthusi
astic support may have is a matter for
debate—we'll not admit that it has no
influence. The rooters' share is small
but highly important. Come join the
band!

Repeated requests have been made
to leave the bleachers by the regular
exits, and not by the broad path of
turf to training house and field exit.
The football coach and the graduate
manager join in asking this courtesy.
