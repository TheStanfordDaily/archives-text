# The 						Philosophy of Pablo
## 
### 
In her easy-going, almost child-like
way, Grace Hazard Conkling is able to
say what others think, but are unable
to express. The following verse is
taken from the September issue of
Everybody's Magazine:
Sometimes Pablo teaches me
How he thinks the world should be.
These are things I hear him say
All the world and every day.
"Never do what can be done
'Neath tomorrow's sky and sun;
Many things both great and small
May never need be done at all.
"Eat what beans you have today
Others must be on the way.
When and how they come, who knows?
That tomorrow only shows.
"Say what grief, hovvever deep,
Hurts the man who is asleep?
Things are kinder than they seem.
He who sleeps may also dream!"
When he gets as far as this,
Oh, how tired he always is,
Lays his spade down wearily
Goes to sleep beneath the tree.
â€”Everybody's Magazine, September,
1914.
