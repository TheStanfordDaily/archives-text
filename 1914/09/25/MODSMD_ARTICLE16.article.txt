To the Editor:
At two assemblies so far this semes
ter the new body of entering students
have heard the meant-to-be-inspiring,
"Hail, Stanford, Hail." Have they been
truly inspired, or have they been de
pressed by the manner in which we
rendered our once beautiful hymn?
Much was written and spoken last
year about the way our hymn was
sung. Nearly everybody has noticed
how it has deteriorated into a near
funeral dirge, because of the sleepy
manner in which we sing it. At the
Big Game, or after inspiring athletic
events, our hymn is sung more enthu
siastically than at other times, prob
ably because of the stimulation the
singers have been aroused to by the
game. But yet, how we all were
thrilled by the way the Glee Club sang
our anthem at the concert last year.
Why can't it be sung that way by the
entire Student Body all the time? We
think that it can, if the students can
learn the hymn as it was written, and
we can do this if part of the Glee
Club will co-operate with the yell
leader, and lead us to the right time
as we sing this. A .A. G., '16.
