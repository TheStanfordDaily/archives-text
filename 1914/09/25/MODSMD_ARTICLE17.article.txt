## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon will be the last
opportunity to see in action the men
trying out for the position of assistant
yell-leaders, when the contestants will
woxk-out once more before the bleach
ers during the football game. As has
been the previous custom, a straw vote
will be taken to determine the choice
of the student body.
The Executive Committee, at their
meeting next Wednesday evening, will
officially announce the names of the
two contestants chosen to lead the
Stanford rooting section for the re
mainer of the year. The seven
juniors eligible for the position are M.
J. Cody, A. B. Fisher, J. H. Goodman,
A. A .Goldsmith, B. B. Kellogg, C. W.
Jordan and A. F. Palm.
