# Fire Destroys College Building.
## 
### 
Central Hall, the men's dormitory
and dining hall of the College of the
Pacific, was completely destroyed by
flames yesterday evening. The fire
broke out shortly after the evening
meal, and was held in check for some
time by the students themselves. When
It was found that the destruction of
the building was inevitable, all ef
forts were devoted to saving the fur
nishings. The women students assisted
the men in this work. For the present
the men will eat in the gymnasium.
