Oh where are the mosquitoes of
yesteryear?
After all, it's not keeping on the
boat that is so hard. It's trying to
keep from rocking it; that's difficult.
Without a doubt, the only time to
toot your own horn is when .riding in
your own front seat.
Strange, isn't it, how some fresh
men insist on misinterpreting their
class caps, and try to wear them as
helmets.
Come to think of it, isn't it time for
the fall crop of nuts to sprout on the
Quad, provide entertainment 'tween
classes and then desecrate Uncle
Sam's front porch at noon?
