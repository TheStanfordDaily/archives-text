# RAM'S HEAD TRY-OUTS TO BE HELD SATURDAY
## Both Principals and Chorus Parts Open for Competition in Society's New Show. 
### 
Try-outs for parts in the coming
Ram's Head show, "Routing Razma
taz," will be held Saturday morning,
September 26, in the basement of the
Engineering building.
A number of prominent speaking
parts will be open for competition
this year, in addition to those of the
chorus. Ram's Head's former policy
of recruiting the principals of the cast
from its own membership, leaving
only chorus pa.rts open to musical
comedy aspirants, has been abandoned
in favor of the new plan. The society
hopes to find a wealth of new material
for the coming production.
"Routing Razmataz," is an original
musical burlesque by the members of
Rani's Head Society, and is modeled
upon the plan of the popular New
York Gaiety productions. W. S. Wil
son, '13, has contributed a sensational
song hit, entitled "Along the Dykes of
Amsterdam," which has already been
accepted for publication by J. H. Rem
ick & Company.
The date of the Ram's Head show is
set for Friday evening, October 23.
