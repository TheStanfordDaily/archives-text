# STRONG APPEAL MADE FOR RED CROSS FUND
## 
### 
Evidence of the great peace and hu
manitarian movement spreading over
the United States was shown last ev
ening in the mass meeting held at the
Armory in Palo Alto. It was a dem
ocratic and cosmopolitan crowd that
listened to the appeal fo.r aid of suffer
ing Europe.
Judge S. W. Charles, as chairman for
the evening, reminded his audience of
the two-hundred-mile battle line in
France, and the part in the conflict
that the United States should play in
alleviating suffering. Professo.r E. B.
Krehbiel, of the History Department,
was the first speaker. He felt that
the chief result of the great battles
is the diversion of the armies into two
classes, namely, the well and the dead,
wounded, and dying. "The Red Cross,"
he said, "takes care of those men whom
it will not pay the army to rescue.
Its physicians, nurses, first-aid men
and supplies are all used impartially
on the wounded of both sides. The sys
tem is largely dependent on the dona
tions of individuals, and money given.
Mr. C. J. O'Conner, of the Red Cross
Society, and Rev. Father Gleason, both
of whom have had experience in war,
strengthened Professor Krehbiel's ap
peal for the relief of suffering and
destitute men, women and children.
Material financial support was added
to the movement last evening with the
collection of $92.60 from among the
audience. A number of Palo Alto wo
men will buttonhole the passerbys on
University Avenue tomorrow in an at
tempt to increase the amount already
contributed.
