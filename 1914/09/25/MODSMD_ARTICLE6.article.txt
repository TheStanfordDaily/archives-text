Carey Nixon wants a good
crowd lit.the bleachers to look
over the niay-be yell leaders. .loin
the baRRd.

Hostilities on the football Held will
commence tomorrow afternoon at 1:30
with the Freshmen-Lowell game, reach
a high mark when the Varsity engages
the Alumni at 2:30, and end after the
second string men have sampled Santa
Clara's 1914 offering.
The Varsity team which will be pit
ted against the Stanford and Califor
nia men, who form the Alumni Club,
jvill have no changes in personnel from
the one which romped with the Bar
barians last week. This premier ap
pearance of the Alumni on Stanford
Field will be a welcome novelty. Their
speed is attested by the fact that Cali
fornia tallied only seventeen points
against them last Saturday, and was
not able to fend off one try.
Santa Clara always sends a team
which offers good value for the ad
mission price, and seldom fails to
make the game a feather-edge proposi
tion until the last.
1918 has displayed considerable merit
in the earlier matches of the season,
and the game with Lowell High tomor
row has all the advance prospects of
being lively.
Secretary Molineaux, of the Seaman's
Institute, in San Francisco, will be
referee in the Varsity and Second Var
sity games. W. D. Fletcher, '11. has
been asked to supervise the Fresh
man match.
