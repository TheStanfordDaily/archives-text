# Soccer Team to Clash With Barbs on Saturday
## Cardinal Lineup of Last Saturday Materially Strengthened by Week of Hard Practice. 
### 
The Stanford soccer team will line
tip against the Barbarian Club aggre
gation next Saturday at Recreation
Park. This is the second game on
Stanford's schedule in the Exposition
League series, which is being played
for the possession of the silver soccer
trophy offered by Spalding Brothers,
of San Francisco.
The Barbarians will put a strong
eleven on the field for Saturday's con
test, and the Cardinal players are ex
pecting a hard-fought game. The-
Stanford line-up will be made up ot
the same eleven that met the Olympics
in the 3 to 1 winged-0 victory of last
Saturday. A week's practice has great
ly improved the team work of the col
lege players, whose weakness last
week lay particularly in their lack of
combination. The Stanford squad has
been decidedly strengthened by the
presence of ex-Captain A. W. Higgins,
'13, who was thought fo.r a time to
have signed up with the Olympics for
this season. His fast play on the for
ward line was a feature of last Satur
day's game.
Stanford's line-up for tomorrow's
game follows: Outside left, A. J.
Vail, '15; inside left, H. Henderson,
'14; outside forward, A. W. Higgins,
'13; inside right, W. B. Blodget, '15;
outside right, .1. E. Mead. 'Ifi; left half

derburg, '15; right half. E. T. Button.
