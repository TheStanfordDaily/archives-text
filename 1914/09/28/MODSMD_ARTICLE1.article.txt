## SUCCEED IN OLD DRAMA CLIMAX OF "MEN AND WOMEN" THRILLS, BUT LAST ACT OF PLAY IS WEAK. CAST SCORES HIT INDIVIDUALLY 
### J. C. Cross, '17 
The "Men and Women," whose ac
quaintance we made on the Assembly
Hall Stage Friday evening, owe their
life and being to the abilities of the
Sword and Sandals cast and the inde
finable Belasco touch, which is evi
dent throughout the play.
The weakness of the drama, if
weakness it has, lies in the melo
dramatic tensity of its situations. If
the spectator does not submit quickly
to the swSy of the action, he is lost,
for he will remembe.r that it is only
pictured action. The tenseness of
Belasco and De Mille's story, however,
is made palatable by the brightness of
the dialogue, the cleverness of the sit
uations, and the skill of the players.
Although the piece is a bit stilted,
and affected for this age, "Men and
Women" is gripping in itself, irre
spective of interpretation. The plot
moves satisfactorily up to the stirring
climax of the third act. The fourth
act, however, shows tendencies of
dragging, and, had it not been for the
author's skill in writing agreeable
dialogue, the introduction of several
"padding" scenes might have resulted
in disaster.
P. E. Leland, '16, as "Israel Co
hen," president of the Jefferson Na
tional Hank, presented the most clear
cut portrayal of the evening. He was
admirable, making his presence felt
in every move. In this role, the au
thors have depicted the type of Jew
rarely portrayed on the stage. Noble,
widely sympathetic and cultured, "Co
hen" was at once a devoted friend, a
capable director, and something of a
philosopher. Leland played surely,
naturally and quietly, and as he is re
ally a fine actor, his delineation had
force, variety and sincerity.
The role of Buford Williams, '1(i,
called for little action, and often re
quired that most difficult art of doing
nothing with the greatest evidence of
interest. The silent actor is the hard
est-working actor. Williams made a
convincing "William Prescott," pic
turing the man's anguish and fear at
the threatening discovery of his guilt
and his subsequent recovery, with
much artistry. In such moments as
that in the first act, where he receives
news of Kirke's suicide, his success
was notable.
The work of Miss Terese Dorroh,
'Ifi, as "Agnes Rodman," leaves the im
pression that she acts carefully, wise
ly, conscientiously, and successfully.
She played the strong scene of the
third act in a key of splendid modera
tion, and was always natural and free
from theatrical affectations or studied
poses.
Interest centered in the appear
