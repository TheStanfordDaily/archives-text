### 
United Press Telegraphic Report
Paris, Sept. 28. —All military author
ities are silent. The three o'clock state
ment of the war office was absolutely
non-committal as far as important
news was concerned. Experts are dis
posed to believe the reports that the
allies have raided Mons, in Belgium,
far north of and to the rear of the
iernian right, where the Germans were
entrenching a position to fall back.
It is believed that the allies have driv
en the enemy from the city as it is
burning. The authorities admit pri
vately that an important battle near
that town is close, and that the allies
are bending every effort to hold their
lines intact, while they crumple the
German right. The evidences are that
thousands of troops are in action, and
both sides are sacrificing heavily.
Austrian Motives Suspected.
Rome, Sept. 28.—1t has been learned
here that the Austrians are concen
trating upon the Italian frontier. All
troops of Italian birth have been trans
ferred from the front, in Galicia and
Hungarian and Slavic regiments have
been substituted for them. German and
Austrian diplomats believe that there
is little doubt but that Italy will even
tually participate.
Slavs Hold Carpathian Passes.
Petrograd, Sept. 28.—1t is announced
that the Russians control all of the six
passes through the Carpathian moun
tains connecting Galicia with Hungary.
It is predicted that the Russians will
enter Berlin by January first. The en
tire Russian aVmy is on the move.
Husso-German Buttle Imminent.
Petrograd, Sept. 28. —If, is announced
tliat a great battle has apparently
commenced between the Russians and
Germans along the rail.road just in
side of the extreme eastern portion of
East Prussia. The fighting is along a
forty-mile front between Goldap on
the north to Lyck on the south. The
line of battle is seventy-five miles
southeast of Konigsberg. The Ger
mans are strongly intrenched, and
have been heavily reinforced. Action
will probably last for several days
The weather is very bad.
Antwerp liuked by Artillery.
Antwerp, Sept. 28.—German artil
lery is shelling the outer forifications
of this city. It is reported that the
forts below Vaelem and Wavre and
the chain of works connecting them
have been somewhat damaged. All
Belgian forts are responding vigorous
ly.
