Shades of the dusty path! The last
relic of the old days, of the seasons
before the occupation of the campus
by the progressive forces, is to go the
way of all deterrents to reform. Gen
eral Hewston's army of cement arti
zans moves on the old dust walk from
the Postoffice to the Engineering build
ing within the week. The fears of the
campus dwellers for their safety in
the daily hop, skip and jump through
the quagmires of winter are alleviated,
and the all-enveloping clouds that
mark the approach of a pedestrian are
the last whirls of dust before the
storm.
The news that the lower part of
Lasuen is to be widened and curbed,
and that a sidewalk of some width is to
take the place of the well-beaten trail,
is an announcement that will rival the
news of the gymnasium contracts in
public interest. It is the thing that
comes into our daily routine that takes
precedence, and so the glorious reality
of the Stanford Union and the Club
House has been dimmed by the condi
tion of the walk we were rorcecl io uat.
This last improvement is one of
many contemplated in the new policy
of the grounds committee, and the day
when the campus is to be well side
walked and well paved is no longer
beyond thought. The use of the new
walk to the exclusion of the east side
will prove a living mark of appreciation
'All things come to him who waits,'and
the community is well-trained in wait
ing. Our fear now is that the cement
workers will emulate the record for
rapid progress set by the Union con
tractor, and that the rains of winter
will join forces with the director
whose best-known trait is painstaking
slowness.
