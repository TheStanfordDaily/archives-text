The singing of "Hail, Stanford,
Hail!" lias been the excuse fo.r flow
of ink from many an editorial pen,
and its erasure from the list of sec
ond page possibilities leaves white
space that's hard to fill. Yell Lead
er Nixon succeeded in getting a new
rhythm into the hymn on Saturday
last, and to the few on the bleachers
the singing was the near-realization ol
a long-cherished hope. It is acknowl
edged that the song of the University
was not written 'larghissimo,' and the
attempt to correct the meter is not at.
its initial trial.
The next step involves the giving of
valuable minutes of time to the sing
ing of our hymn after the game's last
whistle. Since the hurried exit of the
rooters from the blcachers, while oth
ers doff hats in reverence, is but a

mute tribute to the call of the evening
meal, there would seem no possibility
of outweighing the claims of "Hail,
Stanford, Hail!" to a few precious sec
onds of time.
