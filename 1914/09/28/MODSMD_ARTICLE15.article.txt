"Carolus Ager," the pen-name used
by Charles K. Field, '95, when his
present literary success was only an
undergraduate vision, appears above
some of the best verse-stories of life
on the farm. Much of his poetry ap
peared in"The Four-Leafed Clover,"
an enterprise of the early years which
was fed by the talent of Field, the
Irwins, and other campus scribes.
The poem printed below is a fair
type:
I took my books the other day,
And studied in the Quad alone;
But no professor came my way,
I wasn't called on the next day,
That work was never known.
Upon the road beside the brook.
One little hour we two beguiled;
I never looked inside a book,
But I met each prof whose work I
took,
And when I flunked he smiled.
