# IMPROVEMENT OF LASUEN STREET COMMENCED TODAY
## 
### 
Active work was begun today toward
laying a new six-foot cement side
walk to extend from the Engineering
corner of the Quad to the postoffice.
The old dirt path, with its bumps and
ruts, is to be torn up and the street
widened to that point, making a four
teen-foot widening of Lasuen. This
will necessitate having all the trees
cut down now growing in the parkway
to the postoffice, and the plowing up
and remodeling of the street.
The old Engineering corner, which
has long been the favorite rendezvous
of the men of that department, must
either go absolutely or be put back
twenty feet. It is estimated by the con
tractor, 11. A. Morey, of Menlo, that the
sidewalk will bo finished in the course
of two weeks. Mr. Hewston, General
Superintendent of the Business Office,
will then himself direct the work of
widening the street.
