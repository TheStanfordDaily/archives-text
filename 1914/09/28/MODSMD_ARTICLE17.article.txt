# PIGSKIN ECHOES.
## 
### 
The third varsity team, or team A,
defeated the Belmont high school ag
gregation in a game marked by fast
play and good rugby to the tune of 13
to .0 Three tries and goal kick made
up the total. The military school en
tertained the Stanford players with a
dinner and an initiation following the
contest.
Rev. Molineaux, secretary of the
Seaman's Institute, of San Francisco,
acted as referee for the Varsity and a
part of the Santa Cla.ra game. Rev.
Molineaux played on the Cambridge
team in England at half, and is recog
nized as a star in Rugby circles. Low
ell has been fortunate enough to secure
him for the season as coach.
