### 
United Press Telegraphic Report
Washington, Sept. 28. â€”Special Rep
resentative of the State Department
Catrothers today telegraphed that the
representatives of Carranza and Villa
are to meet at Zatateeas in an effort
to patch up their differences. He does
not state whether or not he suggested
the conference. It is believed that the
majority of the Mexicans, whom the
United States government has been
holding as prisoners during the war,
and who were recently released, have
enlisted in Villa's army. Unconfirmed
reports state that the Villistas have
taken Zatateeas and San Luis Potosi.
