### 
London, Sept. 28. â€”Military officials
here declare that the end of the battle
is in sight. They say that behind the
strict censorship a new and decisive
move is being developed fo.r the early
defeat of the Germans. The war office
is exceedingly optimistic. There is
much speculation as to the movement
of new troops, and it is reported that
British troops from India are in action.
Rumor has it that the French and Brit
ish general staffs have disagreed upon
the proper plan of action.
