# Extra! Peanut League Goes On the Rocks
## Federals Victorious in Fight Against Organized Baseball; Capt. Workman Flans Reorganization. 
### 
The Peanut League is a thing of the
past, but this does not mean that there
will be no more fall baseball. The
Colts, Birds, Harps, and Feds have
been split up, mixed around, and .re
arranged into four new teams, and
two leagues, which will be known as
League A and League B. The change
was thought necessary because in
playing experienced men with those
newer to the game, neither received
the practice most needed to develop
their ability . Players who made the
best showing in the Peanut League
will consequently be placed on teams
A or AA.
The other ex-Peanut Leaguers will
be on one of the B league teams. How
ever, Captain Workman wants it dis
tinctly understood that no man's posi
tion will necessarily be permanent in
either league.
Former varsity men will handle the
B teams every afternoon, and men will
be moved into the A league as fast as
their playing justifies the change. In
the same way, "big league" players
who fall down, will be shoved back to
B league.
Beginning this afternoon, a twenty
game series will be played, with four
games a week, as before. The silver
cup will go to the non-varsity squad
man in the A league having the high
est batting average, providing he com
petes in ten games.
Before the Peanut League was raid
ed by the new leagues, the teams were
playing as follows:
The moulting season was not yet
ove.r for the Birds, judging from the
way they dropped games to the Feds
during the last week's play in the
Peanut League. They secured a fairly
firm foothold on last place Friday by
losing a 5-3 game to the latter team.
Hits were five for the Feds and four
for the Birds.
The Colts were branded 2-1 by the
Harps, dropping to third place for
pennant honors. Nine hits were
chalked up for the Harps, to five for
the Colts .
The final standing of the clubs was:
Club. Won. Lost.Pet.
Feds 5 3 .625
Harps 4 3 .571
Colts 3 4 .428
Birds 3 5 .375
