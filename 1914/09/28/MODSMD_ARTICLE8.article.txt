# PLANS FOR MEN'S GYMNASIUM ARE IN CONTRACTOR'S HANDS
## Board of Trustees Appropriates Two Hundred Thousand Dollars For Construction of Men's and Women's Athletic Buildings. Active Operations Are to Begin at Once FUNDS FOR METALLURGY ADDITION 
### 
The Board of Trustees of Stanford
University voted $100,000 Friday even
ing for the erection of a new men's
gymnasium, and approved the design
submitted by Bakewell & Brown, of
San Francisco. Larson & Lamson re
ceived the contract for the new build
ing, and will begin operations within
a week's time.
A like amount was appropriated at
the same meeting fo.r a new women's
gymnasium, and immediate action will
be taken in regard to the drawing of
plans and the letting of the contract.
The Mining Department was also pre
sented with funds for an extension to
the Metallurgy building.
The new structure will be completed
by March 1, 1915, according to a very
optimistic estimate, but it can hardly
be hoped that the buildings will be
fully equipped and ready for use be
fore the end of the second semester.
The location of the men's gymna
sium was chosen with a view toward
convenience. 7'ht r.ite is opposite the
Power House, a few rods f.rom the ath
letic fields. The building will fill the
position of athletic headquarters of
the University, and will serve to at
tract many students who have hitherto
lacked interest in gymnasium work.
The gymnasium will be constructed
of face brick, agreeing with the gen
eral color scheme of the University
buildings. Two divisions of the struc
ture appear on the plans. The largest
is 330 feet in length, with an entrance
at each end, designed to give .room to

shower baths, accommodations for vis
iting athletic teams, lockers for an un
limited number of gymnasium stu
dents, and offices for the instructors
and their assistants.
A court ten feet wide separates this
first part from the second, which runs
parallel to the main division, although
not as many feet in length.
This portion holds the immense drill
hall, 120 by 65 feet, with a hard maple
floor. It is expected that this room
will be the setting of all future cam
pus dances. Special rooms for boxing,
wrestling, and fencing, and laundry
and store space are provided at the
ends of this building. The baths will
be furnished with Searsville water,
which can be pumped by filtering pro
cesses and a chemical treatment. Hot
water will be provided by a special ap
paratus to be installed.
Bakewell & Brown, the architects
who drew up the plans for the men's
building, are now engaged in design
ing the women's gymnasium. The
building will occuny a more advan
tageous position than the present
Roble gymnasiumâ€”the site chosen is
a large field west of the Quadrangle.
A 125 by 46-foot wing is to be added
to the Metallurgy building, and will be
devoted to laboratory space and di
visions of the subjects which have
hithe.rto been neglected for lack of
sufficient room.
The building will not be constructed
of brick, but in all probability stone,
like that used in building the Quad
rangle will be employed.
