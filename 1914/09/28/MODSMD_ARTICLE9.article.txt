# Cheering Throngs Witness Three Wins For Cardinal
## 
### 
Any one who delights in cold figures
would be pleased to set hand to an
adding machine and show that, three
Stanford football teams massed 82
points against their opponents Satur
day, and allowed only an even dozen
to be entered in their own debit col
umn. But more romance may be
gleaned from other pages of the rec
ord.
The ball was kept in the open in
stead of under foot, which is proper
according to Hovle and W. W. Hill, of
the Australian Rugby Union. There
was pretty passing among the backs,
skillful dribbling by the forwards, and
accurate touch-finding.
To begin at the end of the program,
the Varsity men taught the "Alumni"
in all friendliness, that they had bet
ter report back to their respective
coaches for a post-graduate course in
Rugby. The first division team had a
romp, a walkover, and the crowd was a
little tired from the other games. The
Second Varsity and Freshmen earned
all they got from Santa Clara and Low
ell High, and there are those who claim
that they were handed a present or
two even at that.
Erb's sure work at the receiving end,
in taking the ball from the scrum ac
counts for much of the speed shown
by the Varsity backs. The old reliable
units of the backfield scoring; machine
were in evidence throughout, and the
story of their effort is too long for a
detailed account. The .aggression of
the forwards was always effective, and
their defence at the few times of need
was splendid.

Jim Wylie, breakaway, scored his
first try .for the Cardinal, when after
a forty-yard scrum he hacked up Erh
and Austin in a sweeping run down
field. Individual aud combined effort
were seldom lacking, and there was no
suggestion of the listless victory over
the Barbarians of last week.
Referee Molineaux. Time of halves
thirty minutes.
Santa Clara's second division men
had the lust of victory strong in their
blood from first to last, and were a
hard problem for the Stanford team to
solve. They pounded at the home goal
line consistently, and had a four-point
lead at half- time. Schultz, first five,
received from the ruck at center, ne
gotiated the difficulties of a scattered
defense in his beautiful forty-yard run,
and passed to Genocchio, breakaway,
who released the ball to Thomas
wing, fo.r the try.
.Tacomini, Second Varsity lock, re
ceived a broken nose in the first half,
and was replaced by Dubendorf.
In the second period, the visitors'
forwards early dribbled well into Stan
ford's territory, and threatened the line
twice with five-yard scrums. Splen
did defence, kicks to touch, clean
tackling fended off disaster.
Hanimon brought the onlookers to
their feet by breaking through at mid
field with a dribbling run, scooping
the ball at thirty-five yards, and pass
ing to Wynne for a score near the
touch flag. The final score was regis
tered after a twenty-five-yard lineotit
when Hayes passed to Wynne, who
made another successful journey over
the line, after a splendid elusion of the
defenders. West failed a second time
to convert.
Referees, Molineaux and Fitzpatrick.
Time of halves, twenty-five minutes.
The match with Santa Clara was the
most pleasing of the trio. In the open
ing game between 191 Sand Lowell
there was a considerable amount of
loose play, and the spectators were
surfeited with Rugby when the time for
the Varsity game drew around.
The Freshmen ave,raged a good fight
against Lowell, though there were
many ragged edges in the play. They
kept the substantial rules of the game
pretty well in mind, however, and
atoned for mediocre playing with some
that was good. Two ciphers dotted the
score board at half-time, with the ball
in touch at Lowel's thirty, after a
twenty-five minute session, in which
the two fifteens pretty evenly divided
honors, with a shade in Stanford's fa
vor.
A lucky dive by Graham, wing, avert
ed Lowell's near-try early in the sec
ond half, and turned the tide of battle
from home ground. With their game
won, time found the Freshmen sturdily
opposed at center, where the ball was
kept in the thick of dribbling duels.

Santa Clara's second division men
had the lust of victory strong in their

hard problem for the Stanford team to

line consistently, and had a four-point

there was a considerable amount of
loose play, and the spectators were

The Freshmen ave,raged a good fight
against Lowell, though there were
many ragged edges in the play. They
kept the substantial rules of the game
pretty well in mind, however, and
atoned for mediocre playing with some

accurate touch-finding.
To begin at the end of the program,
the Varsity men taught the "Alumni"
in all friendliness, that they had bet
ter report back to their respective
coaches for a post-graduate course in
Rugby. The first division team had a
romp, a walkover, and the crowd was a
little tired from the other games. The
Second Varsity and Freshmen earned
all they got from Santa Clara and Low
ell High, and there are those who claim
that they were handed a present or
two even at that.
Erb's sure work at the receiving end,
in taking the ball from the scrum ac
counts for much of the speed shown
by the Varsity backs. The old reliable
units of the backfield scoring; machine
were in evidence throughout, and the
story of their effort is too long for a
detailed account. The .aggression of
the forwards was always effective, and
their defence at the few times of need
was splendid.

Jim Wylie, breakaway, scored his
first try .for the Cardinal, when after
a forty-yard scrum he hacked up Erh
and Austin in a sweeping run down
field. Individual aud combined effort
were seldom lacking, and there was no
suggestion of the listless victory over
the Barbarians of last week.
Referee Molineaux. Time of halves
thirty minutes.
Santa Clara's second division men
had the lust of victory strong in their
blood from first to last, and were a
hard problem for the Stanford team to
solve. They pounded at the home goal
line consistently, and had a four-point
lead at half- time. Schultz, first five,
received from the ruck at center, ne
gotiated the difficulties of a scattered
defense in his beautiful forty-yard run,
and passed to Genocchio, breakaway,
who released the ball to Thomas
wing, fo.r the try.
.Tacomini, Second Varsity lock, re
ceived a broken nose in the first half,
and was replaced by Dubendorf.
In the second period, the visitors'
forwards early dribbled well into Stan
ford's territory, and threatened the line
twice with five-yard scrums. Splen
did defence, kicks to touch, clean
tackling fended off disaster.
Hanimon brought the onlookers to
their feet by breaking through at mid
field with a dribbling run, scooping
the ball at thirty-five yards, and pass
ing to Wynne for a score near the
touch flag. The final score was regis
tered after a twenty-five-yard lineotit
when Hayes passed to Wynne, who
made another successful journey over
the line, after a splendid elusion of the
defenders. West failed a second time
to convert.
Referees, Molineaux and Fitzpatrick.
Time of halves, twenty-five minutes.
The match with Santa Clara was the
most pleasing of the trio. In the open
ing game between 191 Sand Lowell
there was a considerable amount of
loose play, and the spectators were
surfeited with Rugby when the time for
the Varsity game drew around.
The Freshmen ave,raged a good fight
against Lowell, though there were
many ragged edges in the play. They
kept the substantial rules of the game
pretty well in mind, however, and
atoned for mediocre playing with some
that was good. Two ciphers dotted the
score board at half-time, with the ball
in touch at Lowel's thirty, after a
twenty-five minute session, in which
the two fifteens pretty evenly divided
honors, with a shade in Stanford's fa
vor.
A lucky dive by Graham, wing, avert
ed Lowell's near-try early in the sec
ond half, and turned the tide of battle
from home ground. With their game
won, time found the Freshmen sturdily
opposed at center, where the ball was
kept in the thick of dribbling duels.
