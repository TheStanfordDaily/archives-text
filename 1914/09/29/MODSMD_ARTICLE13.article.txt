# CONTRACTOR'S WORK ON UNION IS IN FINAL STAGE
## Welcome to Dr. Jordan on His Return May Feature House Warming. 
### 
The return of Chancellor David Starr
Jordan may be contemporaneous with
the official opening of the Stanford
Union. If it is possible this event will
be made a housewarming in honor of
the Chancellor's return.
The work of finishing up will require
some time yet, however, and since no
definite word has been received on the
campus concerning the date of Dr.
Jordan's return, it is impossible to
state definitely that the two functions
of welcoming him and opening the
Union will be combined.
The construction of the Stanford
Union, under the supervision of F. IT.
Fowler, is now being pushed vigorous
ly. Mr. Fowler believes the Union may
be completed soon after Dr. Jordan's
return. The concrete work on the
building is already finished, only the
interior decorating and minor improve
ments to the towers remaining undone.
Work on the Woman's Clubhouse is
also rapidly progressing, and the con
tractor has announced that he will
finish his work by the first of next
week. Considerable will remain to be
done to make the building ready for
occupancy, even after the actual con
struction is finished, so not even an
approximate date for the formal open*
ing has been set. The women have one
month after the contractor ends his
work in which to accept the building.
