# WAR MOST BITTER IN HISTORY, SAY GERMANS
## MORALE OF MODERN TROOPS HAS INCREASED DESPERATE CHARACTER OF WARFARE. DISEASE APPEARS AT THE FRONT BRUSSELS' BURGOMEISTER ATTEMPTS TO PAY WAR TAX IN HERMAN BONDS. 
### 
United Press Telegraphic Report
Berlin (via wireless), Sept. 29.—Re
ports say that Teutons in charge of
the German campaign in F.vance pre
dict that the allied lines will break
within a week. Their resistance is
slacking. It is declared that condi
tions at the front are frightful, and
that fighting is the most hitter in his
tory, continuing both day and night.
The day's fighting usually begins with
an artillery duel, and is followed by
an attempted charge by one side or the
other, which is generally checked by
machine guns, or sometimes even bay
onets. Shells are continuously ex
ploding in the trenches. The slightest
movement anywhere along the line
provokes shelling. The groans of the
wounded are disheartening.
Combatants Shift Troops During Lull.
London, Sept. 29.—Advices indi
cate that the Germans are shifting
their troops. The ninth German army,
with General von Boehm in command,

has again been reinforced. This indi
cates that the Germans realize that
their success depends upon their abil
ity to hold the right under von Kluk
until the French forts along the Meuse,
in the east of France, are demolished.
Tn order to prevent this, the French
have drained their troops from the line
south of Belfort, in Lorraine, twenty
miles north of the Swiss border. These
men are being sent to the armies of
the Meuse, between Nancy and Toul.
Military Sanitary Conditions Problem.
London, Sept. 29.—Army men here
are admittedly concerned about the
sanitary conditions at the front. It is
constantly reported that Asiatic chol
era has made its appearance among the
wounded in Vienna and at Budapest, on
the firing line in Galicia and certain
parts of Russia. Typhoid and dys
entery troubles are said to be raging
in the ranks of the Germans. Many
French and British are suffering from
milder diseases. The recent rains have
brought about an epidemic of rheuma
tism among the British.
Teutons Refuse German Bonds.
Ostend, Sept. 29.—Burgomaster Max
of the city of Brussels, has insisted
upon paying the first installment of
the war tax in German bonds instead
of in gold. The Teutons have im
prisoned him until the municipality
pays six millions in gold.
Germans Claim "No Change."
Berlin, (via The Hague), Sept. 29. —
A statement of the German war office
follows: "The fighting is general, al
though it is not apparent that the con
flict has entered its deciding stage.
Pressure is great on the German right,
but every attempt of the enemy to
penetrate has been repulsed with
great loss to the attackers. There are
no changes along the center, although
fighting has continued there for a
week. Our forces are gaining along
the Meuse."
Belgians Move Forward.
Amsterdam, Sept. 29.—It is reported
that twenty thousand Germans have
occupied Alost, between Antwerp and
Brussels. The Belgians advancing from
the former city toward the latter are
now engaging the enemy.

wounded in Vienna and at Budapest, on
the firing line in Galicia and certain
parts of Russia. Typhoid and dys
entery troubles are said to be raging
in the ranks of the Germans. Many
French and British are suffering from
milder diseases. The recent rains have
brought about an epidemic of rheuma
tism among the British.
Teutons Refuse German Bonds.
Ostend, Sept. 29.—Burgomaster Max
of the city of Brussels, has insisted
upon paying the first installment of
the war tax in German bonds instead
of in gold. The Teutons have im
prisoned him until the municipality
pays six millions in gold.
Germans Claim "No Change."
Berlin, (via The Hague), Sept. 29. —
A statement of the German war office
follows: "The fighting is general, al
though it is not apparent that the con
flict has entered its deciding stage.
Pressure is great on the German right,
but every attempt of the enemy to
penetrate has been repulsed with
great loss to the attackers. There are
no changes along the center, although
fighting has continued there for a
week. Our forces are gaining along
the Meuse."
Belgians Move Forward.
Amsterdam, Sept. 29.—It is reported
that twenty thousand Germans have
occupied Alost, between Antwerp and
Brussels. The Belgians advancing from
the former city toward the latter are
now engaging the enemy.
United Press Telegraphic Report
Berlin (via wireless), Sept. 29.—Re
ports say that Teutons in charge of
the German campaign in F.vance pre
dict that the allied lines will break
within a week. Their resistance is
slacking. It is declared that condi
tions at the front are frightful, and
that fighting is the most hitter in his
tory, continuing both day and night.
The day's fighting usually begins with
an artillery duel, and is followed by
an attempted charge by one side or the
other, which is generally checked by
machine guns, or sometimes even bay
onets. Shells are continuously ex
ploding in the trenches. The slightest
movement anywhere along the line
provokes shelling. The groans of the
wounded are disheartening.
Combatants Shift Troops During Lull.
London, Sept. 29.—Advices indi
cate that the Germans are shifting
their troops. The ninth German army,
with General von Boehm in command,

has again been reinforced. This indi
cates that the Germans realize that
their success depends upon their abil
ity to hold the right under von Kluk
until the French forts along the Meuse,
in the east of France, are demolished.
Tn order to prevent this, the French
have drained their troops from the line
south of Belfort, in Lorraine, twenty
miles north of the Swiss border. These
men are being sent to the armies of
the Meuse, between Nancy and Toul.
Military Sanitary Conditions Problem.
London, Sept. 29.—Army men here
are admittedly concerned about the
sanitary conditions at the front. It is
constantly reported that Asiatic chol
era has made its appearance among the
wounded in Vienna and at Budapest, on
the firing line in Galicia and certain
parts of Russia. Typhoid and dys
entery troubles are said to be raging
in the ranks of the Germans. Many
