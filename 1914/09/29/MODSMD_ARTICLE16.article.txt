# Watching the Battle Line

Sticking pins in the map of Europe,
marking the advances and retreats
of the battling hosts with tiny flags,
and listing the official dispatches may
be interesting and instructive to a por
tion of the college community, who
have an idle hour, but we doubt wheth
er the radius of influence be wide or
the number attracted to notice be more
than negligible. However, a better
plan has been evolved, and the first
■steps taken to form a course in Cur
rent Events that bids fair to crowd the
lecture hall.
Professor E. B. Krehbiel will give
an analysis of the Great War on Wed
nesday evening in Encina Clubrooms,
including a resume of the events lead
ing to the almost universal declara
tion of hostilities, and a prediction as
to probable results. This is the first
lecture on the European situation giv
en this semester, and as the daily re
ports of the conflict cannot but place
the scenes described several thousand
miles nearer home than they have ap
peared in the past, the subject is of
intense interest.
The University Extension Division of
the University of California has insti
tuted such a series of lectures on the
immediate past, present, and futnrcV of
the nations at war, reaching thousands
of people in all portions of the staie.
While the duplication of such an ex
tensive system is not only impossible
but unnecessary, the plan for a de
tailed exposition on the campus of the
why and the wherefore, is to be com
mended.
