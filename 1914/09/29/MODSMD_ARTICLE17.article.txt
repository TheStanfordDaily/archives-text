Team A of the bush rugger squad
defeated Team B yesterday afternoon
in an even game by the score of 4 to 0
on the auxiliary field. The contest was
marked by loose and ragged play.
The Varsity men were put through
only light practice by Coach Brown.
The backfield, under the direction of
Danny Carroll, were given instruction
in offensive play against an imaginary
defense. Passing and cross-kicking
were paid decided attention. Captain
Deke Card and Coach Brown put the
forwards through a stiff work-out in
dribbling, heeling the ball, and line
out play.
After a consultation this morning be
tween Manager Wilcox, Coach Brown
and Captain Card, it was decided to
postpone the opening of the training
table until October 15. It is believed
that a six-weeks' period of diet would
cause the players to become over
trained.
