Last night you were with me, oh, little
dream girl,
In a world that is not today,
And your hand clasped mine, oh, little
dream girl,
As we wandered away, away,
Till we came to a field where daffo
dils blow —
A marvelous field and fair,
Where star flowers twinkled and
poppies glow,
And we tarried together there.
Oh, little dream girl, your eyes Wwre
blue,
As blue as the summer sea, —
All the sweet, lingering dream hours
through,
You danced and laughed with me.
And when you had wearied of frolic at
last,
And stilled was your elfin glee,
I cuddled you warm and pressed you
close,
My little dream girl to me.
Oh, little dream girl, pray where no
you go,
When you left me standing there.
Alone in the fields where the daffodils
blow,
In the marvelous field and fair?
Perhaps you will come to me, sweer.
tonight,
And laugh with me once again,—
Or have you departed, my little dream
girl,
To a realm that lies not in my ken"}
