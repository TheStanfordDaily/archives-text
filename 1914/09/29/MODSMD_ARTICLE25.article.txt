# Von kluk's Communications Cut.
## 
### 
London, Sept. 92. â€”Paris dispatches
say that it is reported that the Ger
mans are retreating from their forti
fied positions between the Aisne and
the Meuse. It is also reported that the
allies have succeeded in cutting the
German line of communication and
that von Kluk's army on the German
right is in danger. The war bureau
will not confirm either of these re
ports, and will add nothing to its own
statements, which declare that the
Germans are still attacking the
French left.
