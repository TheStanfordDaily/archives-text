# Breslau Believed Russian Objective.

### 
Petrograd, Sept. 29. â€”Apparently the
campaign in Galicia is the main of
fensive movement of the Russians.
Grand Duke Nicholas is there with a
million men. Two columns are pro
ceeding westward on parallel rail
roads, and strong forces are advanc
ing between them and on both sides
to prevent any flanking movement. It
is believed that nothing can retard the
Slav invasion.
It is the Russian intention not to
halt until they have reached Cracow,
and made an attempt to capture that
city, although this movement is merely
a mask, as they will then proceed to
Breslau, their main objective.
