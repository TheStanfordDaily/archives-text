# BERKELEY BRIEFS
## 
### 
The Berkeley track, which has been
the scene of many memorable per
formances and meetings to followers
of cinder path activities hereabout, is
now being destroyed. Next season
the trans-bay university will have its
new oval with its 220-yard straight
away, if present plans materialize. At
least one person who will be made
happy by the change is Fred Kelly,
world-famous hurdler, who sustained
two bad injuries in trying to negotiate
the banked curve in the low hurdles.
It is interesting to note that Parke.r,
the speedy Olympic Club athlete, is
the only sprinter who has ever run
the 220-yard dash in 22 seconds flat
around the dangerous turn. This per
formance was chalked up in the recent
P. A. A. meet.
The California football bleachers
will have their capacity increased by
6000 this week, when the new seats at
the edge of the field will be thrown
open. The greater seating capacity
will increase the Big Game receipts by
about $15,000.
California's annual outburst of
frivolity—the Pajamarino Rally—is
scheduled for Thursday. An innova
tion is promised, in that the seniors
will don "just plain nighties," instead
of pajamas, as has been customary.
The California Glee Club will give a
concert in conjunction with the regu
lar program at the Oakland Orpheum
tonight.
