# Finish Athletic Field Improvements.
## 
### 
With the cleaning off of the Stan
ford soccer field, and the repair of the
ISncina tennis courts, the athletic field
repairs of the University have been
completed, according to Graduate Man
ager Wilcox. These improvements,
with the ones made during the sum
mer, will put the athletic fields in con
dition for the year's wear. According
to Wilcox, no additions will be made
to any of the bleachers. The only im
provement of any consequence is the
turfing of the baseball diamond, which
will be ready for spring games.
