## SKILLED HIGH SCHOOL RUGGERS WILL VIE WITH BABY FIFTEEN FOR SECOND TIME. BROWN SHIFTS THE 1918 LINEUP EVENLY MATCHED TEAMS SHOULD AFFORD FAST AND EXCITING CONTEST FOR LUGBY FANS 
### 
The Freshman fifteen will oppose
the ruggers from Palo Alto High
School for the second time this season
in a clash on the ti. rf tomorrow af
ternoon. The brand of good Rugby
and fast play that is always displayed
by the nearby school team, should af
ford the bleachers excellent entertain
ment.
In the mid-week contest, two weeks
ago, the 1918 fifteen scored a close vic
tory over the Palo Alto players, when
they whitewashed them with a 4 to 0
score. The game should give the Rug
by fans an excellent opportunity for
observation of improvement in the
baby team over their early-season
play.
Last Satui day the Blue and Gold
Freshmen swamped the Palo Alto
players 49 to 0. This large score is
due in great measure to the absence
of five men from the high school line
up, and to the overwhelming prepond
erance of weight in the Freshman
scrum. Tomorrow PtJo Alto will pre
sent the strongest possible front by us
ing several men who were declared
ineligible by the State High School
Federation into the game. The Fresh
men will display a much rearranged
line-up, as Coach Brown has an
nounced numerous changes in posi
tions. Two 1918 wings, Weeks and
Johnson, are still on the sick list, and
will be unable to don suits.
The Freshman team will line-up as
follows:
Henry, Slocum, Stevlck (Hams'),
Cole, Ford (Hough), (Eaton), R.
Johnson (Fisher), Boyd (McArthur),
Card (Sherman), forwards; Walker,
half; Greve (McAdams), Ist five; Staf
ford (Winters), 2d five; Chandler,
center three-quarters; Jeffers (Wal
ters), left wing; Graham (Kyle), right
wing; Neuner, fullback.
