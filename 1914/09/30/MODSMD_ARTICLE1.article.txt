"Chappie" will positively appear on
the Quad tomorrow morning in an en
tirely new garb. "The One-Step Num
ber" is the interesting caption of this
special issue. From cover to cover
the comic is filled with gay and novel
surprises, well in keeping with the
spirit of the periodical, which satirizes
the modern dances in a clever and
original way.
The new tango shade, blended with
black and white, forms the color
scheme of the artistic cover design,
which is an unusual creation by M. A.
Oliver, '15.
The frontispiece is a full-page car
toon by N. Douglas, '18, picturing a
remark made at a recent assembly in
regard to dancing.
"The One-Step" is the title of a se
ries of satirical verses by Jimmy Duff,
'13, which composes the front page
poem.
The Dillettante deals with a man
who thought lie understood women,
with the woman in the case a one
stepping heroine. Hud Stewart, '16, is
the author.
A double-page art feature, "As
Chappie Sees the So-Called One-Step
at Stanford," is from the brush of F.
S. Murray, '16.
The mysterious H. A. C., '06, proves
his versatility in an unusually clever
drawing with a subtle significance. He
also views the publishing of statistics
from the standpoint of an old "grad"
in a caustic manner.
"A Technicality," or "Within the
Law," is the heading of several verses
in which Hud Stewart, '16, expresses
a decided preference fo.r the one-step.
The second reel of Chappie's famous
film, "The Perils of Paul Lean,
Frosh," is a full-page half-tone relat
ing several new and thrilling perils
of the popular hero. McDermott, '17,
is the artist. Though passed by the
National Board of Censorship, these
"movies" are guaranteed for a laugh.
R. N. Wenzel, '16, pictures his views
of the college method of dancing in a
clever sketch, "A Difference."
