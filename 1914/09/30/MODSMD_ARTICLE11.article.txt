# INTERCOLLEGIATE SOCCER PROMISES HARD CONTEST
## Eleven Games Scheduled With Outside Teamsâ€”Two Contests With California This Semester. 
### 
Intercollegiate soccer will swing to
the head of the interest column after
November 14. California has decidedly
augmented the equipment and squad
for the English game, and this year
will have, for the first time, a paid
coach. They will undoubtedly put out
the strongest team in their soccer his
tory. Their line-up, showing a strong
array of veterans, will be decidedly
strengthened by the presence of three
Canadian exponents of association
football, who will also aid in training
the squad in the finer points of the
game. California's increased interest
in soccer is shown by the fact that the
Rugby field has been turned over to
the soccer teams for most of their
practice.
Stanford has few veterans in the
soccer squad, and will have a fight
ahead to keep the string of Cardinal
victories unbroken this year. There
will, as heretofore, be three inter
collegiate games during the soccer sea
son. two in November and the third
on February 22, 1915. The first con
test will be staged at Berkeley on the
morning of November 14, the second
taking place on the 2Sth on Stanford
field. This will be the first game on
the Exposition League Schedule to be
played at Stanford, in order that there
may be no conflict with the prelim
inary Rugby contests.
Although the Stanford line-up shows
at present only fou.r veterans of former
intercollegiate soccer, the end of the
Rugby season will mark an influx of
good material into the ranks of the
soccerites. Erb, Carroll, and Wylie will
be among the most prominent of the
players who will report for soccer
practice after the Big Game has be
come history. Erb and Car,roll have
already won the circle-"S" against Cal
ifornia, but Wylie, though a seasoned
soccer player, will compete for the
first time on the Stanford soccer field.

Stanford eleven this semester is as fol

victories unbroken this year. There
will, as heretofore, be three inter
collegiate games during the soccer sea
son. two in November and the third
on February 22, 1915. The first con
test will be staged at Berkeley on the
morning of November 14, the second
taking place on the 2Sth on Stanford
field. This will be the first game on
the Exposition League Schedule to be
played at Stanford, in order that there
may be no conflict with the prelim
inary Rugby contests.
Although the Stanford line-up shows
at present only fou.r veterans of former
intercollegiate soccer, the end of the
Rugby season will mark an influx of
good material into the ranks of the
soccerites. Erb, Carroll, and Wylie will
be among the most prominent of the
players who will report for soccer
practice after the Big Game has be
come history. Erb and Car,roll have
already won the circle-"S" against Cal
ifornia, but Wylie, though a seasoned
soccer player, will compete for the
first time on the Stanford soccer field.
