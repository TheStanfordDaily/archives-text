## Rugby Squad Will Be Guests at Reception Skull and Snakes Plan Royal Entertainment for Football Players October S. 
### 
An old-time rousing reception will
be tendered the football squad of over
two hundred and fifty men October 8,
a week from Thursday evening, under
the auspices of the Skull and Snakes
society, at Encina Hall. The date is
tentative, since satisfactory arrange
ments have as yet not been made with
all the speakers. The get-together was
instituted at the suggestion of Coach
Floyd Brown, who believes that the
benefits therefrom will be invaluable
to the best interests of Stanford.
The committee in charge of the en
tertainment consists of Chairman G. W.
Rcdeau, E. B. Hall, T. E. Workman, W.
S. Burns, and D. Cass. The evening's
program has not as yet been definitely
arranged. It is planned to stage the
affair as informally as possible, with
plenty of wholesome refreshments and
lively amusement for the guests.
The motive of the reception is two
fold—to increase the knowledge of
rugby among the players and to
strengthen the spirit of good feeling
among the men of the squad. A ballot
box will be placed in the campus posr
office, which will be used for receiv
ing all the questions that any player
may desire to be informed upon. It is
expected scores of queries will be
dropped in the box. These will be an
swered fully by a rugby expert, yet to
be chosen by the committee—in all
probability either Palmer Fuller or
Rev. Mullineaux, who refereed Satur
day's varsity game with the alumni.
