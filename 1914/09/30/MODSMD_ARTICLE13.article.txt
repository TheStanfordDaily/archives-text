# "BIG LEAGUERS‚Äù GIVE POOR EXHIBITION OK BASEBALL
## 
### 
The game yesterday afternoon be
tween teams A A and A of the A
League, was a comedy of errors, end
ing in 4-1 victory for the former team.
In the last half of the fifth inning all
attempts to play good ball were
thrown to the winds, the chief aim
of the AA's seeming to be to allow
their opponents to sco.re. The victors
secured four hits to the A's two.
