United Press Telegraphic Report
Hague, Sept. 30.—The heavy siege
artillery, which almost completely de
molished the towns of Namur and
Liege, has been placed in favorable
positions before Antwerp. Hundreds
of inhabitants are fleeing from the
scene of warfare. The Antwerp rail
way communications have already been
cut. It is reported that the Germans
are determined to capture the be
leaguered city, since they desire to use
Antwerp as a temporary base for their
airships, proceeding a Zeppelin attack
upon the British coast. The new ar
mored air fleet is understood already
equipped for immediate action.
Irish Still Rebellious.
New York, Sept. 30. —Irish papers
arriving here indicate that Ireland is
far from united with Great Britain in
her war against Germany, but the
censorship has prevented the facts be
ing cabled. Irish papers say that Ire
land is placarded with seditious post
ers, and that all attempts to persuade
the Irish to forget their troubles for
the time being have failed.
War Offices Issue Conflicting Reports.
Paris, Sept. 30. —Conflicting reports
of allied successes are arriving from
the front. Rumors are circulating to
the effect that the German right has
at last broken. French military experts
refuse to confirm this report, but
state that the fighting is the fiercest
of the present battle, with the German
resistance continuing strong. Un
doubtedly a break in the Teuton line
is hourly anticipated. Bordeaux war
headquarters will make no comment
on allied advance previous to an offi
cial declaration.
London, Sept. 30. —Allied successes
in the turning movement of the Ger
man right continue unabated. Eng
lish newspapers are printing with re
serve the Parisian rumors concerning
the complete route of the Teuton flank.
An unconfirmed dispatch stating that
General vou Kluk has asked for terms
of surrender is causing no end of com
ment. An Ostend advice reports the
surrender of the German commander
as already taken place, but is generally
denied by military authorities.
Petrograd, Sept. 30.—The Germans,
heavily reinforced, are engaged in a
decisive battle with the Russian invad
ers under General Rennenkampf be
tween the Niemen river and the cast
Prussian frontier. The fighting is most
desperate in the vicinity of the Rus
sian cities of Ossewetz and Augustow,
located within a few miles of the bor
der line. The Teuton invaders are
making decided gains in every direc
tion, especially into Galicia.
Berlin (via Hague),The war office
issued the statement today that the
right wing under General von Kluk re
mains intact with the repulse of the
.repeated allies' attack. The left center
along the river Meuse continues to
make slow but sure gains. In the east

hordes are being forced back with loss
not only of ground but of numerous
prisoners and guns. The Teutons are
advancing eastward upon the main
