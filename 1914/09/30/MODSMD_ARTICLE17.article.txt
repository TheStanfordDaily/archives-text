# Wanted—Noise!
## 
### 
Dormant bleachers, passive bleach
ers, quiescent bleachers, bleachers
that rouse into half interest when the
action is startling, lapse into lazy con
tentment when play is normal —they
yell not, neither do they sing. The
situation is paradoxical—the ruggers
play to win, the rooters wait in silence
as if to chee.r a losing game. If that
last be true, then their apathy is far
sightedness, for a losing team will
need their reminder of Stanford Spirit.
But there is a better mark of ap
preciation and confidence than is
silence—silence that curbs, chills,
checks the last gasping effort of the
player. And that tribute to unselfish
effort, clean play and hard going, is
Noise—song, yell, cheer, blare, and
whistle—noise that cheers and noise
that strengthens.
Noise seems harder to make than it
did last year, much harder than it did
two years ago. Our system of noise
making may be at fault, our repertoire
of songs and yells worn by over-use,
exhausted. The selection of dinning
sounds at the call of the yell leader
seems adequate for all purposes, the
lack must be that of a good, rousing
bleacher song. We need one that is as
good as 'Sons of the Stanford Red,'
better than others, equal to any choice
ballad that is shouted to the skies
and the opposite bleachers from the
California camp—for the truth to tell,
the Cardinal has been outsung of late.
The year is not too far gone for
achievement—novelty may prove the
key to the bleacher music box. Grasp
Opportunity, ye opera-makers and
ballad-mongers!
