# New Specimens Reach Zoology Museum
## 
### 
A number of rare specimens for the
zoology museum have been brought to
Stanford by Professor E. C. Starks,
who secured the invertebrates in
Naples, Italy. The greater part of the
collection consists of varieties of Med
iterranean fish.
The specimens are so delicate that
they can be prepared only by scientists
at the Naples Zoological Station, who
have invented a new system for curing
them. The invertebrates are beautiful
specimens, and will make a splendid
addition to the Stanford Zoology Mu
seum. A new case will be constructed
for them, and they will be placed in
large glass jars to be inspected by
students of the University.
