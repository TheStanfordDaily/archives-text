### 
Mrs. Mary Stewart Quelle, the wife
of the manager of the University Press,
expressed the thoughts and emotions
of the mothers personally interested
in the present European crisis in the
following verses:
Sons in the battle's fray,
Sons on the cruisers gray,
Who offers more than they?
Mother of men.
Proudly they bid them go;
Bravely they hide their woe;
Send them to meet the foe: —
Mothers of men.
Then their long vigils keep;
Cease not to pray nor weep;
Tho' the tired soldiers sleep: —
Mothers of men.
On ev'ry war-racked shore,
Over the cannon's roar,
Hear they that cry for "More!": —
Mothers of men.
Turn to their youngest son;
Hand him his father's gun;
Now they've sent every one: —
Mothers of men.
While the grim War-god gloats,
Where his black banner floats,
Clutch to their aching throats:—
Mothers of men.
"Be brave my sons and strong;
Fierce tho' the strife and long!"
Hark! 'Tis their battle-song: —
Mothers of men.
—MARY STEWART QUELLE.
