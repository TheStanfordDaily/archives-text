The Varsity Grays defeated the Sec
ond Varsity Blacks in a skirmish on
the football field yesterday afternoon.
The Blacks were totally unable to cope
with the Grays' backfield, the final
score showing a 38 to 0 victory for
the Varsity. The fast work of Austin
and Urban was a feature of the game.
Tiny Wines and E. B. Hall were out
for light practice on the Rugby turf
yesterday afternoon.
Coach Brown gave the Freshman
squad a light work-out on the football
field yesterday afternoon after the
Varsity game.
