# Austro-Italian Breach Widening.

### 
Rome, Sept. 30. â€”The first step lead
ing toward an almost unpreventable
declaration of hostilities between Aus
tria and Italy became known today,
when the Vienna ambassador was in
structed by his government to protest
against the mining of the Adriatic
sea by the Austrians. Austria is ex
pected to refuse the request. Italy
may at last be forced to throw in her
lot with the allies. If such a step la
brought about, the results will be most
isastrous to the Austro-German cause.
