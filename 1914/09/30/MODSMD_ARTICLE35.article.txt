# Saturday, October tenth.
## On the Quiet 
### 
Without a doubt, charity begins at
home. And with some people it never
gets any further.
From all appearances, the Alumni
Club is treading the downward path.
They WERE a match for the Varsity.
They ARE a match for the second var
sity. Freshmen, next!
Freshman's Song to a Sophomore.
Morning.
1 wonder, often wonder
How in holy thunder
You tell me when water
Comes from Searsville or not?
Noon.
I've been thinking, often thinking,
And though this water's stinking,
How can I tell whether it
Comes from Searsville or not?
Midnight.
I've been bubbling, often bubbling,
I'm a tubbling, I'm a tubbling;
And I don't give a hang if this water
Comes from Searsville or not!
