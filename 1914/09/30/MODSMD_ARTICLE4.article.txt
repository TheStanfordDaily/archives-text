# KAISER FEARED TO BE AMONG THE MISSING!
## 
### 
Foul play is feared on the Farm!
"Kaiser," the alligator pet of the S.
E. house, is missing and a search insti
tuted at 8 o'clock this morning has
failed to locate the runaway.
"Kaiser," who is of old Teutonic
stock, slipped silently away yesterday
without a goodbye, contrary to the cus
tom of pets on the Farm, and break
ing all precedents in the S.A.E. house.
The happy rambles of "Waldo," the
Alpha Phi duck, about the campus were
always heralded by loud quacks which
never failed to announce the approach
of the soro.rity pet. The Zete's dog,
"Girlie," has always reported a griev
ance in unmistakable terms, if grazed
by a passing automobile, but "Kaiser"
is handicapped, for he is voiceless, and
has certainly never swallowed an
alarm clock to help him tick-tack his
approach.
An artificial pool at the rear of the
S. A. E. house, on Salvatierra street,
has been the "Kaiser's" home. One
explanation of the crocodile's fastidi
ous disdain fo,r this pond is suggested
in the fact that the water comes from
Searsville. With this consideration in
view, a squad of freshmen, under the
direction of Art Erb, "Kaiser's" former
custodian, dragged the odorless D. U.
swimming pool next door, but with
out a trace of "Kaiser."
A recent rumor hints that the Theta
chef has achieved undreamed-of fame
lately in the concoction of delicious
southern dishes with "Russian sea
soning."
"Kaiser" is two feet, six inches
has a short, broad snout, very large
teeth in tno lower jaw, and is highly
carnivorous. He is known not to be
partial to the allies.
