# RUGBY MATINEE IS DISASTROUS AFFAIR FOR FRESHMAN TEAM
## Stanford Freshmen Display Little Ability Against Fast Palo Alto Backfield in Loose Exhibition on the Turf This Afternoon SCORE BOARD READS 6-3 
### 
Six and three was the sum of Palo
Alto's triumph over 'IS's best this af
ternoon on Stanford Field. From the
dazing trick the high school ruggers
unbottled in the first half the score
should have mounted to higher regions.
The Freshman forwards rallied in the
last ten minutes, and played a credit
able game, keeping within touching
distance of the town team's line, and
threatening several excursions across
it.
Rugby is a poor word to apply to the
exhibition. There was a very thin
worn thread of rugby in the entire fifty
minutes of play. "Smearing" was the
order of the afternoon, with odds a
good deal against 1918.
Stanford's backs were lost in the
whirl of the game from first to last.
What open play they did manage to
turn loose had the appearance of being
mistakes.
ThePalo Alto team was a big smoke.
There was little chance for it to play
good ball without the stimulus of a
real argument.
First Half.
Palo Alto received, and with a
sweeping stride her forwards cleaned
the field in steady spurts to a try in
the first two minutes. Angell nipped
the ball from a twenty-five yard ruck,
and released to Morris, who passed to
Gillette, wing, for the score. Con
version failed. Score, 3-0.
The Freshmen failed to find them
selves in the first half, and thei.r efforts
to get hold of the ball were smothered
effectively. The play was kept dis
couragingly in Stanford ground, and
the high school backs were shot at the
goal line, in volleys. Only splendid
defensive work of 1918's forwards in
the pinches held the score down.
The rush of the town boys was given
three point windup by means of Phip
pen's well placed free kick, resulting
from Walter's attempt to take the
ball from a five yard ruck. Score, G-0.
Second Half.
The Freshmen walked from Coach
Brown's intermission lecture to a try
afler one minute of play. Slocum and
Henry dribbled from center to the five
yard line, where Cole got the ball for
his run across the line.
A new show of Freshman spirit late
in the second half rushed the play to
the opponent's defense zone.
Concerted effort of Palo Alto's fore
wards drove the play in passing and
dribbling runs to center field and
averted an eleventh hour try.
