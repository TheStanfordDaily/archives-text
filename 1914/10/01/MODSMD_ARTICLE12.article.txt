The following poem was read by
Charles K. Field, '95, at the end of his
speech, representing the facility at the
installation services of Dr. Branner:
Here, on the milestone by the way,
Let us sit down together
There have been skies of heavy gray,
But no such shadow dims today
And this is resting weather;
We have come up so long a way,
Let us sit down together.
See how along the road behind
The other milestones lie;
Some on the hill-tops in the wind,
And one we had no heart to find
But passed in silence by—
Today, how strangely close behind
The other milestones lie!
Our road turns sharply, just ahead —
Let us keep on together;
Perchance through shining uplands led
Or through some valley of the dead —
It will not matter whether
That road be rough or smooth ahead
So we may keep together!
