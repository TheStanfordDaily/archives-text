## 
### 
The January Bulletin of the 1914
Pan-American Union comments upon
the election of Dr. Branner to the
presidency of Stanford University in
the following tribute:
"The elevation of Dr. John C. Bran
ner, of the Leland Stanford, Jr., Uni
versity, to the presidency of that in
stitution is a fitting tribute to the
ability and scientific attainments of
this well-known scholar. Dr. Bran
ner's work in geology and other
branches of science has not been con
fined to his native country, as he per
formed important services as a mem
ber of the Imperial Geological Com
mission of Brazil in 1874-1877. Upon
his .return to his native country in
1883, after acting as agent of the
United States Department of Agricul
ture in Brazil, he was appointed to a
position with the geological survey of
the State of Pennsylvania, which he
held until chosen professor of geology
in Indiana University in 1885. From
18S7 to 1893 Mr. Branner was geologist
of the State of Arkansas, which posi
tion he left to accept the chair of geol
oy in Stanford University, with which
he has been connected until elected
head of the institution."
