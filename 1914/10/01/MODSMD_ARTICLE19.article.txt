Old question—What is so rare as a
day in June?
New answer—W. Randolph Hearst
preaching for peace.
Tomorrow night the band dance,
When joy knows no bounds;
Queeners dance to beat the band,
Houghs band to beat the dance, —
Umm, how one-steppy that music
sounds!
We note with mangled feelings of
pride and satisfaction that the great
Daily Cal's most original and clever
column of comment, the Naked Truth,
has at last stooped so low as to notice
the existence of this infant industry.
We might as well stop right now. Fame
is ours. The great are always criti
cized until dead. We've been criti
cized and everybody knows we're dead.
Hence fame. Thanks, O Naked Truth
ful One.
