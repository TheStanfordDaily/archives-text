# GERMANY ACTUATED BY MILITARY NECESSITIES
## PROFESSOR KREHBIEL GIVES REASON FOR ACTION. Thinks the Allies Would Have Occupied Belgium if kaiser Had Hesitated. 
### 
"German violation of Belgium neu
trality was a military necessity," said
Professo.r E. B. Krehbiel, of the His
tory Department, during his lecture on
the European war at Encina Hall last
evening. "I do not justify it from a
moral standpoint," he continued, "but
it was essential to the safety of the
Germans, that they occupy the only
open passage into France, before
France and England could do so. The
temptation was so great for the allies
to sieze this neutral territory, that
Germany could not afford to keep out.
If England could have occupied Bel
gium, it would have been possible for
her to cut off the German naval posts
on the shores of the Baltic from their
base of supplies, eventually reduce
these posts and thus drive the Kaiser's
fleet from the Baltic Sea. Also the
great Krupp gun works, at Essen, so
essential to the Germans, would have
been in danger of capture.
"Two other ways of entering France
might have been taken by the Kaiser's
troops, one by way of Strasburg, the
other through Metz. These passes,
however, were almost impregnably for
tified by the French. This made such
routes impassible, without great loss
es."
Professor Krehbiel gave a brief ac
count of the advance and retreat of
the German forces in France, showing
just why they had to retire before the
French flank movement. He then took
up the Russian and Austrian cam
paigns in the East, accounting and ex
plaining the Czar's successes, and his
failure to take Konigsberg.
A large crowd was present to hear
the lecture, after which a motion was
passed to ask Professor Krehbiel to
speak again on the war. He has con
sented to do so at 7:15 next Wednes
day evening, at Encina.

to carry forward the spirit and ideals
of Stanford so well as he who through
long service had helped to make them
what they are. While the year lias
brought a full measure of the progress
which ought to be expected in a grow

startling innovations, no breaking
down of cherished traditions.
Whatever have been the problems of
the executive office nothing has been
allowed to impede the work of instruc
tion or to disturb the departments
either internally or in their relations
with each other. In these relations his
attitude has always been that of a
generous friend and adviser. From the
outset both faculty members and stu
dents have seemed to feel sure of a
patient and considerate hearing. They
have found him helpful, direct, sincere.

votion of all elements in the Universi

Professor Krehbiel gave a brief ac
count of the advance and retreat of
the German forces in France, showing
just why they had to retire before the
French flank movement. He then took
up the Russian and Austrian cam
paigns in the East, accounting and ex
plaining the Czar's successes, and his
failure to take Konigsberg.
A large crowd was present to hear
the lecture, after which a motion was
passed to ask Professor Krehbiel to
speak again on the war. He has con
sented to do so at 7:15 next Wednes
day evening, at Encina.

"German violation of Belgium neu
trality was a military necessity," said
Professo.r E. B. Krehbiel, of the His
tory Department, during his lecture on
the European war at Encina Hall last
evening. "I do not justify it from a
moral standpoint," he continued, "but
it was essential to the safety of the
Germans, that they occupy the only
open passage into France, before
France and England could do so. The
temptation was so great for the allies
to sieze this neutral territory, that
Germany could not afford to keep out.
If England could have occupied Bel
gium, it would have been possible for
her to cut off the German naval posts
on the shores of the Baltic from their
base of supplies, eventually reduce
these posts and thus drive the Kaiser's
fleet from the Baltic Sea. Also the
great Krupp gun works, at Essen, so
essential to the Germans, would have
been in danger of capture.
"Two other ways of entering France
might have been taken by the Kaiser's
troops, one by way of Strasburg, the
other through Metz. These passes,
however, were almost impregnably for
tified by the French. This made such
routes impassible, without great loss
