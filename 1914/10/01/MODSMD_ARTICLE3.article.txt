.1. It. Morgan, '16, will have a splen
did opportunity to display his gifts for
female impersonation as "Senorita
Ysabel," a dark-eyed beauty of rare
attraction. Morgan's work in previous
Rani's Head shows insures another ar
tistic creation, for he excells not only
as a singer and dancer, but as an ac
tor as well.
W. B. Forbes, '15, who has also dis
tinguished himself in numerous Ram's
Head productions, will have a role en
tirely different than any in which he

dy role as "Tanialio De Nutt," an in
triguing chef. Melvin has a splendid
baritone voice, and is an actor of ex
perience and ability.
J. A. Gibb, '15, who sco.red one of the
individual successes of "The College
Prince," as an Oriental, will have a
similar part with another opportunity
to exhibit his talent for caricature.
H. L. Alford, 'IS, whom Ram's Head
considers a dramatic "find," will play
the juvenile lea*},•"Jerry Remington,"
Alford has an unusually fine voice and
personality, whioh will aid him to win
success.
"Mayme Razmataz," militant, will be
characterized by M. J. Streeter, 'IS,
who is destined to become a decided
comedy sta.r in campus dramatics. He
is suited physically and temperamen
tally for this important role.
"Fifi De Vine," the lively accomplice
to the villain, will be in the capable
hands of H. H. Dievendorf, '17.
W.G. Paul, '15, will direct the or
chestra. Among the other musicians
