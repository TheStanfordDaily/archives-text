the faculty have not only given me
their cordial support, but they have
even credited me with all their own

October I, lilll.
Today marks the close of the first
year's administration of Dr. John Cas

per Rranner as President ot ! Stanford.
One year ago today in the Inner
Quadrangle, the four elements of the
University—'trustees, faculty, alumni,
and students—through their represen
tatives expressed faith in Dr. Bran
ner at his installation. During the
past year that faith has boon justi
fied and deepened.
The first year of President Branner's
incumbency is past, and there remains
hut a short eight months within the
two-year limit which he set for his
term of office. Today the president re
iterated his statement of October 1.
1913, '"Here and now 1 beg to remind
you that I shall be <>5 years of age in
July, 191.', nml I recommend that I be
retired at the end of that academic
year. In spite of the protests on th-<
part of some of my friends it. seems
best for the University to fix that limit
to my tenure now, while 1 have the
strength of mind to seo what is best
for the University."
In speaking of bis retirement at. the
end of the present academic year, Pres
| ident Brainier said til's morning:


President John Casper Brainier.
