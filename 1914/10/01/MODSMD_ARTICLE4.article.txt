JOHN CASPER Bit A.'WE 11.
October I, lilll.
Today marks the close of the first
year's administration of Dr. John Cas

per Rranner as President ot ! Stanford.
One year ago today in the Inner
Quadrangle, the four elements of the
University—'trustees, faculty, alumni,
and students—through their represen
tatives expressed faith in Dr. Bran
ner at his installation. During the
past year that faith has boon justi
fied and deepened.
The first year of President Branner's
incumbency is past, and there remains
hut a short eight months within the
two-year limit which he set for his
term of office. Today the president re
iterated his statement of October 1.
1913, '"Here and now 1 beg to remind
you that I shall be <>5 years of age in
July, 191.', nml I recommend that I be
retired at the end of that academic
year. In spite of the protests on th-<
part of some of my friends it. seems
best for the University to fix that limit
to my tenure now, while 1 have the
strength of mind to seo what is best
for the University."
In speaking of bis retirement at. the
end of the present academic year, Pres
| ident Brainier said til's morning:


President John Casper Brainier.
"I can only call your attention
to a provision in the trustees' manual,
which provides that the president shall
annually recommend to the Board of
Trustees the retirement of all members
of the teaching or executive staff who
shall be over 65 years of age on the
first day of the following academic
year. I shall carry out this provision
to the letter, and assuredly will not be
mo,re lenient with myself than with
others."
The appreciation which the faculty
feel for the results of his administra
tion was expressed on April 25 at their
last meeting of the past semester,
when they passed resolutions warmly
praising Dr. Branner for the achieve
ments of his first year as President.
A few days later the alumni en
dorsed the resolutions.
California's President Pays Tribute.
Immediately upon the return of Dr.
Benjamin Ide Wheeler from his trip
abroad the cordial relations which
have always existed between the Uni
versity of California and Stanford
were further cemented by an exchange
of addresses by the presidents of the
two universities. The heartiest good
will was shown by the student bodies
of the university in their reception
of the speakers.
In his address at Stanford on Feb
ruary 4, President Wheeler paid the
following tribute to Dr. Branner: "It
is hard to believe that I am at Stan
ford without Dr. Jordan here to wel
come me. But I feel at home to be
with the man who has been putin the
chair—a sturdy rock. It is great to
have somebody you can tie to, —who
tells you the truth, even when it isn't
agreeable to you or to himself."
President Advocates Honor System.
The President's interest in student
government at Stanford has been
manifested on many occasions. The
leaders in student affairs have always
felt at liberty to go to him with their
most petty or most weighty problems,
and they have received his careful con
sideration and wise counsel. It was
largely at Dr. Branner's suggestion,
and through his personal invitation,
that Chancellor Kirkland, of Vander
bilt, was brought here to speak on the
honor system before the men of the
University in an assembly. Other as
semblies were allowed for the purpose
of discussing the different forms of
this system. Dr. Branner has always
been in hearty accord with the system.
Dr. Branner's disinterested wishes
for the students and faculty of the
University are further shown in tne
free use he lias allowed of his private
libraries. I lis collection of books on

Brazilian history and civilization and
on Latin America generally, which is
more nearly complete than any other
such collection outside of Brazil, was
placed in the new library study room
in the History building during the
past semester.
New Policy Announced.
Immediately after the accession of
Dr. Branner to his new position, a
policy new to Stanford, and to the
entire educational world of the Uni
versity, was announced by the board
of trustees, after a consultation with
President Branner and Chancellor Jor
dan. The most notable features of
tliis new policy were the limitation of
the number of departments to those
already existing, and the formulation
of definite plans to elevate the work
of these departments, rather than to
enlarge the curriculum by the addi
tion of new ones.
Before any expansion is made in the
number of departments of the Univer
sity every existing department, and
particularly the professional courses,
will lie built up to class with the best
in the country. Progress has already
been made toward this end.
On April 24 the announcement was
made of an increase of $75,000 in the
President's budget, a large part of
which is to be devoted to increase sal
aries for the teaching staff of the Uni
versity and for new departmental
equipment. In particular, the an
nouncement of the increased faculty
salaries received comment in all ed
ucational circles, and in the press of
the country for it is the beginning of
a policy which will make Stanford in
structors among the highest paid men
in the teaching profession.
New Building Plans.
The effects of the new building pol
icy at Stanford are already being seen.
Simultaneously with the call for bids
for the men's gymnasium, which will
be erected at the approximate cost of
$100,000, on last Friday, came the an
nouncement as a complete surprise
that a new gymnasium and new athlet
ic field for the women of the Univer
sity will also be constructed, at about
the same expense. The wo,rk on both
of these buildings will be rushed to an
immediate completion.
Plans for the beautification of the
Quadrangle are now under the consid
eration of the board of trustees, but
the expense entailed in this work will
probably require that it be deferred
until the present building operations
are completed.
One of the largest additions to the
University buildings which remains to
be completed is the new wing to be
added to the hospital of the Medical
Department in San F.rancisco—an ad
dition which will practically double
the capacity of that building. Large
sums have already been granted for
new equipment for this department.
The largest buildings which will be
added on the campus in the near fu
ture are the museum and the library,
which will form one side of the new
quadrangle. How soon ground will be
broken fo,r the library cannot be defi
nitely determined, and it will be a
matter of two years before the museum
is started. In the meantime the wings
of the old museum, which are wrecked,
are being removed at an expense of
$10,000.
During the year the high tension lab
oratory of the Electrical Engineering
Department was completed. This new
laboratory affords the best opportunity
fo.r experiments in the West. Stanford
Memorial Church was reopened on In
stallation Day last year, but since that
time the organ has been reinstalled,
and great progress made in the work
of restoring the mosaics. The Min
ing and Metallurgy Department has
moved into more commodious quarters,
and their building will be still further
enlarged by the addition of a new
wing, fo,r which funds have already
been granted.
