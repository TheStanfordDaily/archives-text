### 
Vice-President John Maxson Still
man, professor of chemistry, and col
league of Dr. Bvanner since the found
ing of the University through nearly a
generation, has the following expres
sion :
A year ago President Branner as

sumed the responsi
bilities of the of
fice vacated by Dr.
Jordan upon his
promotion to the
chancel 1 or s hi p.
Those who best
know him had no
doubts but that his
adminis t r a t i on
would worth il y
succeed the ad

ministration of liis distinguished and
beloved predecessor.
In his installation address a year
ago today President Timothy Hopkins
of the Hoard of Trustees used these

words: "The Trustees have chosen
for his (Dr. Jordan's) successor a man
whose worth has been tested by long
years of experience, a man who is
loved, honored and respected by alum
ni, Faculty and students. Eminent in
bis profession and distinguished as a
scholar, bis strength of character,
sound judgment and executive ability
combine to promise success for his
administration." it was a tribute as
just as it was graceful.
At the dinner given to President
Brainier a couple of days later in Sail
Francisco by Stanford men i took oc
casion to say (among many others)
these words: "All of you are Stan
ford men and knowing Stanford, you
know D,r. Branner. Therefore I may
safely omit on this occasion any at
tempt at personal characterization and
simply remind you that fwenty-two
years of loyal, devoted and distin
guished service to Stanford University,
a life-time of sound scholarship,â€”hon
ored and appreciated nationally and
internationally, a life-time of high
ideals, of integrity and puritv of life.
