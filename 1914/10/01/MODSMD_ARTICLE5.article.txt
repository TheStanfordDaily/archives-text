## Loyalty and Unselfish Interest in Welfare of University Calls Forth Appreciation.

Vice-President John Maxson Still
man, professor of chemistry, and col
league of Dr. Bvanner since the found
ing of the University through nearly a
generation, has the following expres
sion :
A year ago President Branner as

sumed the responsi
bilities of the of
fice vacated by Dr.
Jordan upon his
promotion to the
chancel 1 or s hi p.
Those who best
know him had no
doubts but that his
adminis t r a t i on
would worth il y
succeed the ad

ministration of liis distinguished and
beloved predecessor.
In his installation address a year
ago today President Timothy Hopkins
of the Hoard of Trustees used these

words: "The Trustees have chosen
for his (Dr. Jordan's) successor a man
whose worth has been tested by long
years of experience, a man who is
loved, honored and respected by alum
ni, Faculty and students. Eminent in
bis profession and distinguished as a
scholar, bis strength of character,
sound judgment and executive ability
combine to promise success for his
administration." it was a tribute as
just as it was graceful.
At the dinner given to President
Brainier a couple of days later in Sail
Francisco by Stanford men i took oc
casion to say (among many others)
these words: "All of you are Stan
ford men and knowing Stanford, you
know D,r. Branner. Therefore I may
safely omit on this occasion any at
tempt at personal characterization and
simply remind you that fwenty-two
years of loyal, devoted and distin
guished service to Stanford University,
a life-time of sound scholarship,—hon
ored and appreciated nationally and
internationally, a life-time of high
ideals, of integrity and puritv of life.

Charles D. Marx, the executive head
of tlie Department of Civil Engineer
ing, member of The Old Guard, and
long tune friend of Dr. Branner adds
tlie bit of appreciation printed below:
What can be said after one year of
Dr. Brauner's administration, except
that he has met in every way the ex
pectations of his faculty as a wise ad
ministrator and a helpful friend.
lie has listened patiently to the
ciaiins which we put before him for
the development of our departments.
Some of them he granted, some Ue
had to refuse; but the department feels
that the demands were refused, be
cause of greater needs for devlopmeut
of the University in other lines. We
know that Dr. Branner has carefully
studied and wisely balanced these
needs, and we feel that everything has
been done that couid be done to de
velop the work of our department.
We would be glad, indeed, if Dr.
Branner's presidency, which he has
himself limited to the short period of
two years, were to be continued fo.r a
much longer time.
CHAS. D. MARX,
Professor Frederic C. Woodward,
head of the Law Department, and
chairman of the Students' Affairs Com
mittee, has worded the following esti
mate of President Branner, as a man
and an executive:
It is difficult to realize that a year

has passed since
Dr. Branner's in
stallation — so
quietly the
stream of Uni
versity life has
flowed along,
From the facul
ty viewpoint, I
believe that it
llias been one of

the best years in the history of the
institution. In his inaugural address
the President imbued us all with a
quiet confidence in his wisdom, his in
dependence, his understanding sympa
thy, his perfect fairness and reliabili
ty. That confidence has deepened, with
the passing months, into an abiding
faith. And because we have faith in
the man and in his leadership, we find
it easier to forget our troubles, we
bear more cheerfully disappointment
and delay, we take infinitely greater
pleasure in our work. It would bo
difficult to over-estimate the effect of
such an influence upon the efficiency
of a University faculty and the happi
ness of its members.
FREDERIC C. WOODWARD.
The clear vision and loyalty of Dr.
Rranner are feelingly acknowledged
by Professor W. F. Durand, head of the
Mechanical Engineering Department,
and president of the Advisory Board:
To those familiar with the history of
Stanford University the announcement
that President. Rranner was to relieve

Chancellor Jordan of the active ad
ministration of University affairs
brought no feeling of apprehension as
though the hand were untried or un
known. On many occasions during the
temporary absences of the President,
Dr. Branner as Vice-President had
wisely guided the affairs of the Uni
versity and it was therefore with a
practised hand that he assumed defi
nite charge in September of last year.
The keynote of his purpose was
clearly sounded in his inaugural ad
dress and he has, with absolute loyalty
to the highest traditions of University
life and without thought *of self, la
bored toward the realization of these
ideals and purposes.
President Branner has realized by
long service as a member of the in
structing body that the sum total of
university life comprises a multitude
of small things as well as a surround
ing range of lofty ideals, and he has
with patience and rare insight set to
himself the task of improving the inci
dentals and accidentals of university
life which count so large in determin
ing the conditions for happy and ef
fective work on the part of both fac
ulty and student body.
President Branner has the love and
confidence of the entire University
community and could he realize the
appreciation in which his efforts are
held by those who have benefitted
thereby, he would have good ground
for a feeling of deep and lasting sat
isfaction in his work of the past year.

The tribute of Professor M. S. Wild
man, head of the Economics Depart
ment, follows:
The beginning of a new administra
tion in any institution is generally an
occasion for anxiety. New men, new
policies, new methods, often provoke
opposition or bring about hesitation
and friction if from no other cause
than the uncertainty that must attend
a change.
Dr. Rranner's first year as president
of the University has been marked on
the contrary by confidence and assur-
