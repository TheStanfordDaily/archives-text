# Another Milestone
## 
### 
October first—the twenty-third an
niversary of the founding of the Uni
versity, and the first anniversary of
the inauguration of Stanford's second
president. Just one year ago today the
four elements that make up the Stan
ford Family, the four representative
factors in our University life, met to
welcome John Casper Branne.r to the
presidential chair. Trustees, faculty,
alumni and undergraduates united in
paying tribute to the man who was to
shoulder the duties and responsibilities
of the University's administration.
And the tribute was the highest that
lay in their giving, for less would not
have done justice to the man.
A year has passed, and we have
reached another milestone. There is
time for a glance backward at the
broad smooth road of progress, time
for a glimpse at the way of the year to
come.
The history of the past year is elo
quent in its praise of the pilot at the
wheel of our ship; our trust in the
man precludes any thought of fear for
the future—if we ignore the part we
have to play.
"The students have done thei,r work
faithfully, have played enthusiastical
ly and have used their liberty with
moderation": the past is secure, the
future rests with ourselves.
The advice of a year ago is ap
plicable today: "I want you to real
ize that it is one of the inexorable
laws of life that when we abuse our
privileges we are on the road to lose
them. A man's work lies before every
one of you. May you so live your stu
dent life that you will get nothing but
pleasure and good out of it here and
hereafter."
