# NEWS REACHES CAMPUS FROM WARRING EUROPE
## CENSORED LETTER RECEIVED BY DR. MARTIN FROM TEACHER AT ANSPACH, GERMANY. TEUTON MIND APTLY PICTURED LOYAL FRAULEIN UPHOLDS THE ACTION OF HER BELLIGERENT FATHERLAND. 
### 
Dr. Liliien J. Martin, professor of
psychology, has received from Frau
lein Marie Kaiser, teacher of English
in the Gymnasium at Achen, Germany,
one of the most interesting letters to
reach Stanford University from war
torn Europe. Achen is located in the
direct line of the Teuton march to
ward France, and for this reason in
formation arriving from this source is
invaluable.
The letter, which was written on
September 1, did not arrive on the
campus until last Saturday. Before it
was permitted to leave the empire,
the epistle was opened and censored
by the German government officials.
After being approved, the letter was
stamped with the government seal in
red wax, closed and sent on its jour
ney. It follows:
"The news of the declaration of war
was received by everyone, by all the
political parties, with the same ear
nestness and resolution to fight to the
last. There was not one who thought
otherwise. The historian of 1813
says: 'The king called, and they all
came.' Now in 1914 they all came be
fore the king called. The nation rose
like one man; there was but one voice,
one resolution heard: 'We have borne
too long with our enemies who envy
us; it is time to shake them off.
English newspapers said that the sol
diers had to be driven to the garrison,
that the Emperor ordered one hundred
Social Democrats shot. On the con
trary, all parties unanimously con
sented to everything the government
demanded. All the representatives of
all the political parties vowed to stand
up for the honor of the Fatherland.
Social Democrats beyond the age of
military service even offered their
help. Our soldiers! You should have
seen them! Young and old, men of
the line, as well as of the reserves,
how, in the highest spirits, singing pa
triotic songs, they went off, glad to
have an opportunity of thrashing the
enemy. They all pressed forward to
join the army.
"We have two million volunteers be
sides the regular army, boys of seven
teen and men over forty-five. An of
ficer, who had taken seven hundred
j of them to another town found at the
end of the journey that he had eleven
more, who had secretly joined his
troop en route. Today there was posted
a notice on the town hall that the mil
itary administration did not want any
I more volunteers.
"As to the progress of the war, the
English and French nations are en
tirely deceived by their military ad
ministrations, and sn are the other
nations. The poor French have been
driven into the war by some ambitious
generals and statesmen, and some oth
er people, who make them believe that
the population of Lothringen want to
be rejoined to France, which is not the
case. Many of the French prisoners
whom we took are very embittered
against their government, which did
not properly equip or prepare them for
the war and deceived the population
concerning the defeats they had al
ready suffered in other parts of the
country.
"The common love for their country
has effaced the differences between
the classes of society. All are ap
proving of the wise arrangements and
preparations of our military staff, es
pecially of the practical equipment of
our soldiers, so advantageously com
pared to that of other nations. The
Emperor is more popular than ever.
He, himself, is in the war with most of
the other kings and dukes, and furth
ermore his six sons are fighting at
the front.
"Our harvest has been exceptional
ly good, and we are well provided with
food, besides those supplies which we
can get through Holland and Den
i mark.
"There is one point which I must
: make. The German soldiers are by
nature humane and well disciplined,
and taught to fight their opponents
face to face; and they have been fol
lowing this rule, the telling of the
most horrible cruelties committed by
our soldiers being absolutely false.
Our army takes care of the woundsd of
all nations."
