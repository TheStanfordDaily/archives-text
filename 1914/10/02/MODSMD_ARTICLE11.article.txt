# E.M. Bonnett Calls For Cross Country Runners
## Squad of Fifteen Must Be Assembled Before Interclass Race Can Be Held. 
### 
Captain E. M. Bonnett, '15, reports
that little interest has been shown so
far in cross-country running. Only
six or seven men have reported for
training in this new branch of athlet
ics. From present prospects it looks
as though the idea of a meet with Cal
ifornia must be abandoned, unless a
larger squad turns out.
The training to be derived from
such exercise is highly beneficial, ac
cording to trainer Harry Maloney, and
all those desirous of developing them
selves physically should profit by the
opportunity. It. is not too late to reg
ister, and Captain Bonnett states that
he will be glad to confer with any
who may desire to try-out. Fifteen
names must be received before any ac
tion regarding an interclass country
meet can be taken.
The original idea of encouraging
cross-country running was to get new
material interested in long distance
events. John Paul Jones and Burna
discovered their ability in their fresh
man days through the avenue of cross
country racing. And, to bring it near
er home, Captain Bonnett himself had
never donned a pair of spikes until ho
took up long distance running here on
the Farm.
