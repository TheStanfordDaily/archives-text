United Press Telegraphic Report
Paris, Oct. 2. —The Germans are
partly flanked and their communica
tions are in danger, although they are
resisting desperately. It is declared
the desperate character of their fight
ing proves that they fear that the
part of their forces in the triangle of
the Aisne and the Oise are in danger
of being cut off. The Teutons are
striving to drive the line of battle
farther west in order to clear a way
for these troops to retire when it is
necessary. Both sides are sacrificing
hundreds at this point. Practically
the entire defensive army of the city
of Paris, heretofore held in reserve,
has been hurled into the conflict, and
the Germans have heavily reinforced
from the Rhine forts and from Alsine
in the hope of turning the tide.
German Dispatches Look Optimistic.
Perlin (via The Hague), Oct. 2.—lt
is announced that the allies' left is at
tempting to flank our right, but steps
have been taken to frustrate their
movement. Fighting west of the Oise
just north of its junction with the
Aisne, and along the Somme, forty
miles north, has been fiercest today
and the enemy has repeatedly tried to
break our lines at these points. The
French operating from Nancy to Toul,
in the east of France, determinedly
assaulted several German positions
and captured them at the cost of many
lives, but the Germans later recap
tured them.
Capital of Dual Monarchy May Change.
Vienna (via Rome), Oct. 2. —In an
ticipation of a siege, the Emperor and
his cabinet this afternoon decided to
move the capital from Vienna to
Prague, in Bohemia, one hundred and
fifty miles north of here and forty
miles from the German border. The
date of removal has been undecided,
and will be ordered as soon as it Is ap
parent that the Russians intend to ad
vance on Vienna. The military coun
cil has ordered the immediate forti
fication of the suburbs of the cap
ital.
liussiu Reports Successes.
Petrograd, Oct. 2. —It is announced
that the Germans are in full retreat
from the Russian province of Suwalki.
just east of German East Prussia. The
entire fo.rce was demoralized when the
center was broken. The most violent
fighting took place today west of Sim
no, southeast of the town of Suwalki.
The main body of Germans are concen
trating still further west near Pet.ro
kow and Kielce. where they have
thrown up entrenchments. The Rus
sian cavalry has cut German communi
cations at many points, and reports
the capture of a large number of pris
oners. These captured Teutons say
that they are veterans of the earlier
campaign in France. The main Russian
armies operating against the Germans
and Austrians in Galicia today crossed
the Nida river in Poland and some of
the armies crossed to the wes! of Hie
river Donakec, in Galicia, after the
capture yesterday of Tarnow, midway
between Przemvsl, which they have
just left, and Cracow, their immediate
objective.
