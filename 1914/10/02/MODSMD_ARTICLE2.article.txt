# FRESHMEN TO JOLLY-UP TOMORROW AT ARMORY
## 
### 
The first semi-annual jolly-up of the
class of 1018 will be held tomorrow
evening in the Armory at eight o'clock.
It is expected that, owing to the size
of the present freshman class, the
jolly-up will be one of the largest ev
er held at Stanford.
A lively program has been planned
by tlie freshman entertainment com
mittee. This will include a number of
original stunts and dances by mem
bers of the class. One of the features
of the jolly-up will be a fight, between
two ghosts of Stanford and Berkeley
football men. A freshman quintet
will provide music, both vocal and in
strumental.
At a meeting of the class yesterday
it was decirled to invite all women
transfers from other colleges to the
jolly-up. The jolly-up will be, as usu
al. "a la roughneck and soft shirt." At
the same meeting R. L. Kinney was
elected class treasurer.
