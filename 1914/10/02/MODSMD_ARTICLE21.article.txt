William Ernest Henley is an English
poet of the last generation. The fol
lowing verse, dedicated to a friend, is
one of his most popular poems:
Out of the night that covers me,
I Slack as the Pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.
In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced or cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.
Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of years
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.
It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the
scroll,
I am the master of my fate;
I am captain of my soul.
