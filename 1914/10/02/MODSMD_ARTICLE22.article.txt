Editor, The Daily Palo Alto:
Your reporter is quite right in say
ing that, in my Encina talk, 1 disap
proved of Germany's invasion of Bel
gium as immoral. But he errs, and
your headline errs doubly, in letting it
appear that I think the allies would
have occupied Belgium had Germany
not done so; and that therefore I con
sider Germany's action justified. I was
not presenting my own opinion, but
merely stating a German viewpoint,
that of Bernhardi, who says: "If the
war then declared be waged against us
in combination with England, it may
be assumed that the allied great pow
ers would attempt to turn our strate
gical right flank through Belgium and
Holland, and penetrate into the heart
of Germany through the great gap
in the fortresses between Wesel and
Flushing."
Let me add that no one deprecates
the violation of treaties more than I do.
Very truly yours,
EDWARD B. KREHBIEL.
