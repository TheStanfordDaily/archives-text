Tokio, Oct. 2. —It is reported that
Kiao Chan is afire at several points.
The British and Japanese are shelling
the works from land and sea both day
and night, but have not yet attempted
to storm tlio fortifications. The Ger
man cruisers arc shelling the land
forces most effectively, but the land
forts are deadly. The German aviators
are efficient.
