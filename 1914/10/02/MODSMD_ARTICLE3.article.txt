# EXTRA!! FATHER TIME. SLIPS UP ON DAILY TASK
## Campus on the Quiet at Twelve-Fifteen for First Time in Years. 
### 
It all depends where you were at
12:15. Of course, you heard it, that is
â€”didn't hea.r it, if you were wait
ing for it. Because it never blew at
all. No, never blew at all, and it
"ain't going to blow no more."
Farm Superintendent J. E. Hewston
announced today that the power house
whistle again would never be blown at
12:15, as has been customary for many
years. Better set your watch by Big
Ren.
