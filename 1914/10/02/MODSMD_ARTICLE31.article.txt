# Carranza Determined Claim.

Washington, Oct. 2. â€”The war de
partment today announced the post
ponement of the evacuation of Vera
Cruz until the tenth at the earliest,
but it is improbable that the port shall
be evacuated so soon. Constitutional
ists here are confident that the breach
between the disputants may be healed,
but state department dispatches from
Mexico City cause the belief that Car
ranza will not quietly withdraw to
make way for Villa.
