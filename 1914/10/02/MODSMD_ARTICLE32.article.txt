# On the Quiet
## 
### 
The lid is on: rushing season is
closed. The free lunch is no longer
extant in Santa Clara County. After to
morrow, when the timid little biddies
or rushees (call them what you will)
fall into their future sisters' open
arms, all will be quiet on the Row. At
present, however, the eight sororities
are up to their nocks in the River of
Doubt, sighing, "Gee. this susnense is
awful!"
Seriously speaking, congrats new
assistant yell-leaders. We're for you,
and with you to a man. Make us hol
ler, make it loud, make it linger. And
bow about some new yells, somebody?
