# "Busy" Office Vs. Student Wallets Pitching Shut-Out Game
## 
### 
Batteries for today—The Stanford
pocketbook versus the Busy Office.
Batteries for Friday—the same. Bat
teries for Saturday—the same. Same
for Monday, too. Last day of series.
What does it all mean?
Syllabus fees are due today, and
every day now until they are paid.
Monday is the last day that they can
be paid without an additional "swat"
of two dollars.
