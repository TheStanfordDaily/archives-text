The Greys and Blacks indulged in a
fast thirty-minute scrimmage yester
day afternoon on the turf. Eight tries,
chiefly the result of good work on the
part of the varsity forwards, were
scored against the second team. The
defense of the Blacks seemed to give
way before the onslaught of the su
perior skill and weight of the Greys.
Captain Dcke Gard and front ranker,
E. B. Hall, played the positions of
center three-quarters and left wing,
respectively, instead of their usual
scrum positions. Coach Brown, who
acted as referee for yesterday's con
test, is attempting to inject a knowl
edge of passing into the play of the
forwards.
The third varsity, under the charge
of A. W. Ambrose, will journey to San
Jose tomorrow to play the University
of Pacific fifteen at College Park.
Teams A and B will contest on the
turf tomorrow morning at ten o'clock,
previous to the Freshman-Berkeley
High School game. "Stubby" Stolz will
act as referee.
