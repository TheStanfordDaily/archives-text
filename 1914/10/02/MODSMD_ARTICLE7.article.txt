# RUGBY MATCHES FOR MORN AND EVENING
## VARSITY AND BLACK JERSEYS WILL OPPOSE BARBS AND ALUMNI IN AFTERNOON. FRESHMEN FACE BRISK ROUND BERKELEY COMES FOR DISPUTE WITH 1918 FATTENED ON WIN AT CALIFORNIA. 
### 
A morning preamble to the week-end
sports calendar will be found in the
Freshman-Berkeley High rugby game,
timed to start at eleven o'clock tomor
row morning. The Varsity and second
string men have been assigned to
matches with the Barbarians and
Alumni, which will be called by Pal
mer Fuller '10, at three and four
o'clock, respectively.
Following the suggestion that a
three-act football performance in one
afternoon is a bit hard on the rooting
section, Graduate Manager Wilcox sub
mits the new departure for approval.
Twenty-five cents or a season ticket
will admit to the morning game. Four
bits or a ticket will buy an afternoon
seat.
No change appears in the varsity
lineup over the one used by Coach
Brown last week. Jim Wylie will be
in condition to take the field as break
away in the fi.rst formation. Hall,
Sopor, and Clark, seconded by Kester,
are picked for the front rank. Clover
and Pettingill, Braaen substituting,
fill the middle rank. Breakaways Card
and Wylie, with Bloeser and Ogden
on the call sheet, will be used in the
rear with Blase at lock.
Backfield tactics have been entrust
ed to the same combination which has
lived up to a good record since the first
of the season. Erb will direct the man
euvers of the scrum at half. Austin
and Lachmund, as first and second
five, will be relieved in emergency by
Andrews and Patterson. Danny Car
roll is commissioned again for center
three. Reeves and Urban, substituted
by Templeton and Burns, are named
as wings. Andrews at full may be re
lieved by Neuner in the event that he
is run in at. his old five-eighths posi
tion to .replace Austin.
A glance at the season's perform
ances of the teams which will visit the
campus tomorrow gives promise of
safe going with the Barbarians and
Alumni. In the second match of the
year, played September 21. the Varsity
succeeded in picking the Barbs off the
bargain counter by a score of 18-4
On September 14, the black-jersied
men took the small end of a 12 to 5
result from California.
The Alumni have been unmercifully
flayed by the varsity men of both Cal
ifornia and Stanfo.rd, but will take
lively issue with the second varsity.
Berkeley High has not yet given a
sample of its worth here, but, in view
of the fact that it humbled DO Blue
and Cold freshmen on September 8 by
a seventeen-point shutout, l'JIS may
look forward to a tussle.

Freshman lineups, and probable state
ment of the Barbarian and Alumni

burn will not appear at center for the
Alumni, and his substitute is not
named. Fleming and Hine, of Cali
