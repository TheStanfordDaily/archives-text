# STANFORD VARSITIES RUN UP BIG TOTALS ON VISITING TEAMS
## Enthusiastic Rooting Section Offered Good Brand of Rugby in Two Exciting Exhibitions on the Turf Saturday Afternoon 1918 LOSES SLOW CONTEST 
### 
The varsity and second varsity teams
laid both the Saturday afternoon
games away on the shelf, and inci
dentally provided two hours of good
sport for the enthusiastic new rooting
section.
When the Harlmrians took their po
sition they showed creditable strength,
and met the varsity half way for fif
teen minutes. From that time on the
strength of the Stanford forwards
bore continually toward the score line.
Throughout the Cardinal scrum
worked like a well assembled machine.
Individual stars blossomed brilliantly
in the backfleld, and there were as
many thrill-makers as men behind the
scrum. The great disadvantage of an
individual game was evident when, af
ter pretty runs,too baffling for the eye
to follow,the star performers repeatedly
passed to empty air, or worse, allowed
themselves to be smothered without
releasing.
Charley Austin made a record of
five goal conversions out of seven
attempts. There was little emphasis
placed on touch kicking by Stanford
The visitors were relieved frequently
by Davidson's long drives.
Murray, the Barbarian center from
New Zealand, released a series of
puzzling runs through tight fields,
and Huttman, last year's freshman
five-eighths figured in several near
scores.
Davidson erased the cipher from the
Barbs' score board and left the score
at 31 to 3 by a pretty thirty-five
yard drop kick in the last two min
utes.
Second Varsity Serves Good Rugby.
The alumni players, who were pum
meled last week by the first team, of
fered keen .resistance to the second
varsity, making tight football the re
sult. in spite of a 2. r >-0 score.
Tilton, Lane, and Mayberry made the
first try in a close passing run from a
fifteen-yard lineout. Wright tallied
the second score by a surf-riding dive
011 the shoulders of Taylor, the de
fending fullback, after receiving from
Swigart on the ton-ya.vd mark.
Scoring in the second half was the
result of weakened resistance from the
alumni forwards. Rehm captured the
ball from a ten-yard ruck and passed
to Single for three points near the
touch line. West's cross-kick to Davis
following the dropout resulted in the
startling second try of the half. West
converted. Score, 14-0.
Outstanding as a spectacle was
Wynne's .run downfield. and short boot
over the defenders' heads, which he
recovered and swept on to the five
yard limit. From a scrum called there
he received Tilton's pass and struggled
through to a try.
The final score was raised to 25-0
before time was called.
Freshman Offer Meaner Showing.
The freshmen again went to defeat
in the morning game, this time at the
hands of Berkeley High School by the
sco,re of Ifi to (i. The play of the 191S
baekfield men was miserable, their
poor tackling and passing resulted in
most nf the scores for the visiting
team.
The first half was fairly even, the
score board reading r> to 3 in favor of
the Berkeley fifteen. The high school

players tallied first in a passing rush
which sent Stevens over for the first
try. Muldoon converted. The count
was nearly evened up when Henry
picked from the loose for 1918 and reg
istered their first try. Neuner failed
at conversion.
In the second period Berkeley ran
away from the baby team. Grass, Stev
ens, and Nevin all crossed the fresh
men line for added points. Muldoon
converting one of the three chances
A passing rush from Walters to Staf
ford to Weeks resulted in the last
freshman tally.
