# Divine Intervention Sought in Prayer of Sunday Worshippers
## 
### 
lii answer to President Wilson's call
for a Sunday of prayer, Dr. Gardner,
in liis sermon yesterday morning,
made clear the spiritual situation and
relation between the warring nations
overseas.
A part of his .remarks were: "In
spite of the fact that each nation is
praying for victory, believing itself
to be in the right, we dare to pray to
God for peace because we are con
vinced of the conserving, creating, and
uplifting power of peace. War brings
to mankind sorrow, suffering, death,
and destruction.
"Again, it is our duty to pray for
the sake of the many, who, far apart
from their God, are unable to pray,
because the lust of battle, the spirit
of revenge, and the desire for victory
hangs too heavily upon them. Our
Master turned to prayer in times of
greatest stress, and we are only fol
lowing His example when we pray
at tliis time,that through the love of
God, His peace may be established
throughout the world."
An anthem, "Out of Darkness," by
Gounod, was rendered by the choir,
and Mr. J. Francis Jones sang Kip
ling's "Recessional."
