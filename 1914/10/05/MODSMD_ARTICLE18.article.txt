to drain fighting units from all along
the line to reinforce von Boehm and
von Kluk on their right. They are

governor of Paris, and others high in
authority, are confident that as a re
sult of this strain, when the German
army is forced to retreat, it will find
it necessary to evacuate France entire
ly. it is stated that there have been
reference in the recent reports of the
Commique to the effect that the allies
have heen forced to retreat at several
points. This probably means merely
that they withdrew to prevent un
necessary sacrifice.
