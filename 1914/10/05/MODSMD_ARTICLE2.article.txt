# Government Car Will Demonstrate Method of Rescuing Miners
## 
### 
Bureau of Mines car No. 5 arrived in
Palto Alto Saturday night. Apparatus
is on the campus and instruction of
mining students is in progress.
This government car, in charge of E.
Stridler, junior mining engineer, and
G. W. Riggs, instructor of the first aid
to the injured, makes its headquarters
in Billings, Montana, from which it
covers a wide scope of Northwest terri
tory.
Instruction embraces a study of what
is known as "Self-contained oxygen
breathing apparatus, its principles, use
and practicability in connection with
mining work."
Rescue work will occupy four after
noons of three hours each; first aid to
the injured and five periods of two
hours each. Men completing both
courses will be awarded mine rescue
certificates by the Bureau of Mines
at Washington.
The car will remain here this week,
and then go to Berkeley.
