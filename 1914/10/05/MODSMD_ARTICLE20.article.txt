# Getting Into the Stride
## 
### 
There is a vague hint of frost in the
air these mornings, the leaves have a
crinkly curl that betokens Autumn,
the keen, bracing air has a sting that
is a .reminder of the short winter days.
And in these climatic changes, per
haps, lies the explanation of things
seen Saturday, on the turf and in the
bleachers.
First, the crowd, which was of con
siderably greater proportions than the
scattered gathering to which we have
been accustomed; then the life, the go,
vigor and vim, that startled staid on
lookers by sharp cheer and excited yell
from bleachers and sidelines. The
spirit was contagious, and the men in
football togs played with the snap that
enthusiasm adds to skill.
Faint rumors come of a cross-coun
try club that will bring out the best of
the long distance runners; the re
juvenated peanut league claims its
quota of devotees each afternoon; an
octet of enthusiastic oarsmen plan
regular visits to the waters of the
Redwood slough, a two hours' jaunt
for exercise and a better crew; the
soccerites kick up dust and the ball in
their effort to gain the mastery of the
teams in their league, and incidentally
to add to the total score checked
against California in the game; the
racqueters are loth to lay aside the
scores of the Regent tourney, and in
disputing each point drive the ball a
little harder against the Blue and Gold
service line of past victories. An aero
plane view of the campus would show
almost countless detachments on the
sports skirmish line, and the ranks of
that "larger half" of passive specta
tors being sadly depleted.
All hail Jack Frost, the best man of
us all!
