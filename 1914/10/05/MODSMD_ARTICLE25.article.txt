Charles K. Field, '95, is the author
of today's verses. They first appeared
in"The First Year at Stanford," at
the top of an article by Field, entitled
"Letters Home or an Account of Life
in the Dormitories During the First
Year."
Dear Chum of mine, do you recall
When college had begun,
The gladness of that glorious fall,
And how we spent the "mon?"
The days of cheer, the days of beer,
The days of '91.
Dear Maid of mine, do you recall
When first my heart you won,
There were no lights in Roble Hall,
Hut oh, such loads of fun?
The days of dark, the days of spark,
The days of '91.
Dear Major Prof, do you .recall
The night at set of sun,
We met when each had made his haul
Where vineyard pathways run?
The days of scrapes, the days of grapes.
The days of '91.
Dear Pioneers, today, when all
The four years' thread is spun,
The freshman follies we recall
We would not have undone,
Those days when youth came seeking
truth.
The days of '91.
