# Literature Is Analyzed By Indiana Professor
## 
### 
F.rank Adyelotte is a professor of
English at Indiana, who has devoted
much time to making English litera
ture understood, instead of merely "ap
preciated." The following is from an
article in the September Atlantic
Monthly:
We talk about the "style" of this
author and that, paying scantiest at
tention to his ideas, omitting the sub
stance to contemplate the form. The
one treatment of English literature
which would give the study of it liter
ary value or make it a part of a liber
al education is that treatment which
lays emphasis primarily on what Eng
lish authors have to say about life,
what were the problems of life which
they were trying to solve, what to them
were its mysteries and its meaning.
To talk frankly and thoughtfully about
these questions, to get to the bottom,
to make our teaching the expression
of what we really believe about the
deepest things of life —the things
about which the poets are talking—to
do this most of us are either too lazy
or too blase.
What are the more humane and what
the less humane aspects of English
letters?
We must face literature squarely,
recognize in it a .record of the weav
ing of our civilization, anrl, without
confusing it for a moment with his
tory or philosophy, give full weight
to its historical and philosophical
bearings.
If English literature were really
made a thoughtful study with the ma
jority, many of its votaries who seek in
it merely a graceful accomplishment
or the means of being wafted up to a
degree on flowery beds of ease, would
be driven away. In the survivors we
might look for results which we do not
find at present: an adequate mastery
of a few books and a few questions.
Some real comprehension of the sig
nificance of literature,some genuine in
tellectual thought interests, and, above
all, capacity for thought which, as it is
the one result of education really to
he called practical, is also the one lit
erary quality.
