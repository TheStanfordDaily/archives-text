# HOOSIERS HOLD UNIQUE HOLIDAY TO FIGHT DISEASE
## 
### 
Indianapolis, Ind., Oct. 5. â€”More
than 2,000,000 Hoosier men, women
and children are today celebrating
what is probably the most unique holi
day ever given the people of this state.
By proclamation of Governor Samuel
M. Ralston, all Indiana has for this
one day focused its attention in a new
way to prevent diseases. Cities are
decorated, factories are closed down,
merchants have suspended business,
and in scores of communities with
populations running from 3000 to
300,000 spectacular parades were to be
a feature of the day's proceedings.
