for college students will be held dur
ing the Christmas vacation this year
instead of in March, as in the past few
years. While Stanford students were
not hindered in attending, on account
of the date in the spring, California
students were prevented by the fact
that they have no vacation at that time
of year. Furthermore, all track aspi
rants found it impossible to break ac
tive training to attend the conference
when in the middle of the season. It
is for the benefit of these people that
the date has been changed.
