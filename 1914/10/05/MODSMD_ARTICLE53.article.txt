# Stanford Hurdlers Star
## FOURTEEN POINTS TALLIED BY MURRAY AND NORTON FOR CARDINAL AT FRESNO. 
### 
F. S. Murray, '16, lived up to his usu
al form last Friday afternoon at the
Fresno County meet. He won his fa
vorite event, the low hurdles, in 25
seconds flat, and took second in the
high sticks to Fred Kelly, of the U. S.
C. p the world's champion, who nego
tiated the 120-yard barrier race in
15 3-4 seconds. It is interesting to
note that both Murray and Kelly won
their respective heats in 15 2-4 sec
onds, most excellent performances for
fall running. Murray added three
more points to the Stanford total of
14 by taking second in the 16-pound
shot put to Caughey with a heave of 41
feet, 4 inches. J. K. Norton, '16, fin
ished second to Murray in the low
hurdles, beating out Case and Beeson,
of the Olympic Club.
The Olympic Club easily won first
honors in the meet with a total of
fifty-five points, and its ti-ack stars
registered two coast records that will
long stand in the P. A. A books.
Norton failed to reach the finals of
the high hurdle event, as he was pit
ted in the preliminary heat against
Case and Kelly, and only two men
qualified. His chances of taking fourth
in the final round would have been
very bright, if the heats had been ar
ranged more favorably.
George Parker, running against
Howard P. Drew, the IT. S. C. speed
marvel, beat his rival to the tape over
the 220-ya.nl straightaway in the re
markable time of 21 1-5 seconds. This
mark equals the performances of
Craig, Dan Kelly, and Wefers, and
adds Parker's name to the list of
world's record holders. In the century
race the tables were turned and Drew
took the measure of Parker in 10 sec
onds flat.
Hoenisch, also wea.ring the Winged
"O," broke the coast record in the 440-
yard dash, consuming but 49 2-5 sec
onds from gunshot to tape. F. E. Mc-
Clure, ex-'l5, wearing the colors of the
Los Angeles Athletic Club, placed sec
ond in this event.. 0. L. Ilorine, ex-'l5,
gleaned five points for the Olympics by
annexing first place in the high jump
with a leap of 6 feet, 1 1-2 inches.
The field was a fast one, many rec
ord-holders being present, and the
meet will probably stand as the most
successful of the fall contests held un
der the auspices of the P. A. U.
