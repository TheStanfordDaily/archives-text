ing minus several of their star players,

playing second five-eighths, Bender is
a star scrum man, and Liversedge is

of his star freshman fifteen into the

the camp of the regulars.

against the U. C. varsity Saturday, and
showed many signs of class A work.
The Forbes brothers showed to partic
ular advantage.
