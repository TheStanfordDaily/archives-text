the campus lias likewise been kept se
cret.
Dr. Jordan's journey throughout the
Eastern states was conducted with
great rapidity, and the doctor has
earned for himself the sobriquet of the
"Man of Mystery," owing to the dearth
of news regarding the events of his
trip which h:is reached the campus.
Academic Secretary Geo.rge Clark
stated today, however, that it would lie
necessary for the Chancellor to return
to New York about November 1, in
order to attend a number of meetings,
including the session of the World's
Peace Foundation, at Boston.
Arrangements are being made to
hold an assembly later in the week to
welcome Dr. Jordan home. The cxact.
day and hour has not yet been an
