Chancellor David Starr Jordan ar
rived this afternoon on the campus af
ter a year and a half absence, and re
ceived a hearty welcome on the part
of the faculty and the students. Dr.
Jordan motored down from San Fran
cisco with his family, where he en
joyed lunch with friends.
When interviewed this afternoon his
conversation at once and almost ah- j
ruptly turned to the scene of warfare
in Europe. His discussion is of intense j
interest. Dr. Jordan seemed to be in
splendid health, although he suffered
a temporary illness while in Greece.
"I have traveled some forty thousand
miles during my absence from Stan
ford, and have come in close contact
with the people of all the belligerent
nations. Yet I am still non-partisan in
the most abominable conflict of the i
history of the world.
"Very few of them really know what
all the fighting is about. The war be
gan chiefly because Europe has been
an armed camp, and fights at the very
drop of the hat. An immediate cause
was that the only honorable alterna- j
tive to prevent dishonorable war, was ;
wa.r.
"T do not think anyone can prophecy
over how long a period this conflict
will extend. Germany, Austria,
France, England, and Russia are '
each spending ten millions of dollars j
daily to maintain the struggle for very j
existence, if the United States were
divided into nine provinces, each one
wealthier than Austria, the property
and money of each would not cover the
cost of the present war for a year.
"No nation in the world has ever
been so tortured as Belgium has been
by the German invasion. Three great
mistaken policies have been adopted by
the Kaiser. The neutrality rights of
nations have been broken. The inter
national laws and rules have been vio
lated. Private citizens and property
have been outraged.
"Any movement toward cessation of
the present conflict through the me
dium of peace is premature, and nec
essarily unsuccessful. There have
been three schemes brought forward,
the one advocated by Bryan being the
most feasible. Bryan desires to force
all countries to wait one year before
continuing hostilities, and in the mean- |
time let a neutral nation make inves
tigations and an attempt at reconcilia
tion of the warring powers. 1 repeat,
as long as Europe is armed every op
portunity will be seized to produce an
active state of war.
There prevails a policy among the
German army staff officers, that a
nation can become powerful only
through war. They should force their
superior might upon other countries,
it being their divine duty to adopt such
arbitrary measures. Germany is
swollen with the idea of world power.
"Finance, fear of consequences, that
is absolute failure, and socialism can
make no headway against war, while
nations still maintain such huge ar
maments. The great body of (he Ger
man people dreaded the outbreak of
hostilities more than any misfortune
that, could possibly befall them. They,
however, had no say in the matter
whatsoever, for the decision was made
by the government.
