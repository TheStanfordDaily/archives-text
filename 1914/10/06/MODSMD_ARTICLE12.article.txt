Paris, Oct. G.—The Comique this af
ternoon said: "On our left the fronts
are becoming more and more extended.
Some German cavalry forces of large
size are reported to have been seen in
the environs of Lillie, thirty miles
north of Arras, beyond which the heav
ier forces hae not recently extended.
The horsemen are advancing before
large bodies of infantry, who are maK
ing a movement northward toward
Tourcioine, thirty miles northeast of
Lille, and toward Armentieres, fifteen
miles north. This movement indicates
that the Teutons are not only deter
mined that their flank shall not be
turned,but even are putting forth every
i effort to push back the allied left
' wing. Around Arras, on the right
bank of the Somme, the situation is
unchanged. Between Somme and the
Oise there have been alternate ad
: vantages and retirements. Near Las
signy the enemy today attempted a
fierce attack, but failed. On the right
bank of the Aisne, north of Soissons.
we have advanced slightly in co-opera
j tion with the British."
