# What of the Plug Ugly?
## 
### 
The last days of October are within
earshot, and the distant clash of up
perclass conflict is in the air. The
Ping Ugly turns uneasily in its grave,
and the substitute adopted during the
last spring trembles on its pedestal.
The quake that may send the new
Plug Ugly crashing into oblivion is
the dissatisfaction of the probable
contestants with the present scheme
for affording amusement to under
class spectators. The fate of the
Senior-Junior rush is in the hands of
the University Conference —thei.r de
cision is largely a reflection of the
wishes of the upperclass students, and
is to be given within a fortnight.
Should the Plug be rejuvenated, or
should the attempts of the revival
committee be thrown to the winds, and
the Plug Ugly allowed to slip into the
realm of lost traditions?
The experience of fifteen years with
the ever-changing forms of plug
christening is a record of constant de
viation from the ideals and purposes
of the founders. First the rush and
the smashing of plugs became the
main feature of the evening's enter
tainment, then the farce and poster
worked into the limelight of public
odium. The Plug Ugly had sunk into
degeneracy.
On December 1, 19111, the University
Conference resolved "that the Plug
Ugly rush, which now includes the
farce and the pasting of posters about
the campus, be abolished, and a com
mittee be appointed to look up some
method of substitution." This action
of the Conference was the aftermath
of the imbroglio following the last
Plug Ugly, with its attendant en
tanglements.
The revival committee reported the
next semester, and their plan for the
continuance of the Plug Ugly was
briefly this: The show to be omitted
and the rush staged on the football
turf. The Seniors and the Juniors are
to be lined up on opposite sides of the
field, and at a given signal the Juniors
were to attempt to break through the
cordan of Senior defenders, and dis
tribute posters among the spectators
in the bleachers. The plug wearers
were not to be maltreated, once they
passed the line of defense.
This is a weak substitute for the tra
ditional hat-smashing affair, given for
the first time in 1898 "to arouse class
enthusiasm and to revive the custom
of wearing Junior Plugs, encouraging
members to wear them throughout the
year!"
If the purpose is solely to afford a
diversion to .relieve the ennui of the
unemployed, the proposed poster rush
might fill the void. Hut in the whirl
of college activities there would seem
little space for such an artificial con
test between bored upperclassmen
The thrill of the night fights, the long
vigils, is gone—there is no romance
in the glare of the day.

If there is no better substitute, the
Plug Ugly should join the ranks of
outgrown traditions.

committee be thrown to the winds, and
the Plug Ugly allowed to slip into the
realm of lost traditions?
The experience of fifteen years with
the ever-changing forms of plug
christening is a record of constant de
viation from the ideals and purposes
of the founders. First the rush and
the smashing of plugs became the
main feature of the evening's enter
tainment, then the farce and poster
worked into the limelight of public
odium. The Plug Ugly had sunk into
degeneracy.
On December 1, 19111, the University
Conference resolved "that the Plug
Ugly rush, which now includes the
farce and the pasting of posters about
the campus, be abolished, and a com
mittee be appointed to look up some
method of substitution." This action
of the Conference was the aftermath
of the imbroglio following the last
Plug Ugly, with its attendant en
tanglements.
The revival committee reported the
next semester, and their plan for the
continuance of the Plug Ugly was
briefly this: The show to be omitted
and the rush staged on the football
turf. The Seniors and the Juniors are
to be lined up on opposite sides of the
field, and at a given signal the Juniors
were to attempt to break through the
cordan of Senior defenders, and dis
tribute posters among the spectators
in the bleachers. The plug wearers
were not to be maltreated, once they
passed the line of defense.
This is a weak substitute for the tra
ditional hat-smashing affair, given for
the first time in 1898 "to arouse class
enthusiasm and to revive the custom
of wearing Junior Plugs, encouraging
members to wear them throughout the
year!"
If the purpose is solely to afford a
diversion to .relieve the ennui of the
unemployed, the proposed poster rush
might fill the void. Hut in the whirl
of college activities there would seem
little space for such an artificial con
test between bored upperclassmen
The thrill of the night fights, the long
vigils, is gone—there is no romance
in the glare of the day.

If there is no better substitute, the
Plug Ugly should join the ranks of
outgrown traditions.
The last days of October are within
earshot, and the distant clash of up
perclass conflict is in the air. The
Ping Ugly turns uneasily in its grave,
and the substitute adopted during the
last spring trembles on its pedestal.
The quake that may send the new
Plug Ugly crashing into oblivion is
the dissatisfaction of the probable
contestants with the present scheme
for affording amusement to under
class spectators. The fate of the
Senior-Junior rush is in the hands of
the University Conference —thei.r de
cision is largely a reflection of the
wishes of the upperclass students, and
is to be given within a fortnight.
Should the Plug be rejuvenated, or
should the attempts of the revival
committee be thrown to the winds, and
the Plug Ugly allowed to slip into the
realm of lost traditions?
