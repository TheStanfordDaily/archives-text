# Our Chancellor
## 
### 
There was a familiar figure on the
Quad this afternoon, a great figure
with the slow walk, the dark clothes,
the soft black hat, and all the other
characteristics that mark the man in
delibly as our Chancellor. Dr. Jor
dan is with us again, and the knowl
edge of his return after more than a
year's absence is enough to quicken
many a heartbeat in welcome.
We are to have the privilege on
Thursday of hearing this great ex
ponent of world understanding tell of
the situation in war-torn Europe.
His knowledge of the situation is
more intimate than that of any one
man to be named, his impartial judg
ment one to be quoted nation-wide.
We are sorry that his stay on the
campus is to be a short one, sorry that
the nature of the man precludes the
possibility of his throwing off the bur
dens of war-stricken humanity, but
we are glad of this glimpse and appre
ciative of his intense interest in our
welfare.
