The following poem was written by
Dr. William Herbert Carruth, head of
the Stanford English Department, in
1892, and published in the New Eng
land Magazine in October, 1895. At the
time of its composition, Dr. Carruth
was a member of the faculty of the
University of Kansas, from which in
stitution he graduated with the class of
1880.
A fire mist and a planet;
A crystal and a cell,
A jelly-fish and a saurian,
And caves where the cave-men dwell:
Then a sense of law and beauty,
And a face turned from the clod —
Some call it Evolution,
And others call it God.
A haze on the horizon,
The infinite, tender sky,
The ripe, rich tint of the cornfields,
And the wild geese sailing high—
And all over upland and lowland
The glow of the goldenrod—
Some call it Autumn,
And others call it God.
Like tides on a crescent sea beach,
When the moon is new and thin.
Into our hearts high yearnings
Come welling and surging in—
Come from the mystic ocean
Whose rim no foot, has trod—
Some of us call it. Longing,
And others call it God.
A picket frozen on duty,
A mother starved for her brood,
Socrates drinking the hemlock,
And Jesus on the rood;
And thousands who, humble and name
less.
The straight, hard pathway trod—
Some call it Consecration,
And others call it God.
