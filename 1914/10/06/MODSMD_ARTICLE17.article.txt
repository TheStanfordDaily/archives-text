# Education For Women Is Broadened to Meet Demand
## 
### 
"What can von do?" This is the in
terrogation of the Age. And every wo
man's college is now being forced by
the yonng women who come within its
walls for enlightenment to answer the
most vital question: "What do you
prepare us to do?"
Therefore, during the last decade the
American colleges for women have
been hard pressed by these modern de
mands. and.in orde.r to maintain pres
tige, are being compelled to meet the
needs of the progressive woman.
When in 1855 the regents of New
York state for the first time gave char
ter rights to a woman's college where

by it might offer degrees and give
courses of study similar to those given
to men, the presidents of other col
leges threw up their hands in lior.ror.
The ramparts of their man-made edu
cational system were being besieged by
female insurgents.
One college professor wrote: "A
few dreamers I understand are trying
to develop ;i college for women in the
village of Elmira. The idea of giving
women a man's education is too ridic
ulous to appear credible." While de
livering a public address a professor of
philosophy in a well-known eastern
college said: "I am informed that a
charter has just been issued in New
York state for the forming of a wo
man's college and that a foolish effort
is being made to place young women
on the platform before an audience.
To my mind this borders on the vul
gar." Dr. M. P. .lewett, who in 1861
was organizing for Mr. Vassar the now
famous college which bears the lat
ter's name, also received criticisms
similar to those quoted.
Nevertheless, against colossal odds
of ridicule and ostracism, women have
made good: they have proven conclu
sively their right to a college edu
cation. Though closely restricted in
the past to certain prescribed and
narrow fields, they have, without a
doubt, demonstrated that they possess
the inate power to achieve.
Here are the courses of study out
lined in a woman's college catalog
dated 1855:
Theology Greek
Philosophy Latin
English Mathematics
What a contrast when we read the
new catalog of the same institution?
Now, in answer to the important
question that must come to every col
lege woman, "what can you do?" the
institution that is abreast of the times
offers preparation for five distinct
avenues of activity.
First, the professions in which we
find women employed as teachers, ar
tists, musicians, and trained nurses.
Even the legal and medical professions
have received women as worthy mem
bers.
Second, social service; third, secre
tarial and commercial positions;
fourth, literary work, and fifth, scien
tific home management.
In view of the world-wide feminist
movement and the universal growth of
democracy and social consciousness,
this trend of the women's colleges to
ward vocational and social emphasis
is most natural.
