I do not pine for human gore,
Yet boldly 1 assert
I'd like to slap the brainless yap,
Who calls a girl a "skirt."
—Peoria Journal.
1 pine not to bring others woe—
I trust I'm not so mean
Hut I would like to swat the bo
Who calls a girl a "queen."
—Houston Post.
1 pine to see no injured gink.
Clutch at himself and wail:
But I'd like to boot the crude galoot.
Who calls a girl a "frail."
N. Y. Evening Sun.
I am not prone to violence,
But I should like to maul
And kick and cuss the inane cuss
Who calls a girl "some doll."
—Judge.
I wouldn't hurt the harmful fly—
Some people think I'm queer;
Hut gee. I'd like to smear the guy,
Who calls a girl a "shear."
—Daily Californian.
I am not bent on evil intent,
But I would like to maim
The high-falootin', high-brow gent
Who calls no girl a "dame."
