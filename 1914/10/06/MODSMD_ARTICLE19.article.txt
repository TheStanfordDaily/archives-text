# SOPHOMORES PLAN LIVE JOLLY-UP FRIDAY EVENING
## 
### 
Stunts of a varied and amusing na
ture are on the program to entertain
the dancers at the sophomore jolly-up,
which is slated for next Friday even
ing at the Armory. Two well-known
fun-makers, B. J. Melvin, '17, and W.
G. Paul, '15, will stage a humorous
piano and song dialogue concoction.
No admission fee will he charged
those attending, but it is expected
that sophomores will have paid their
class dues of one dollar. The invita
tion recently extended to all transfer
women, should swell the total number,
and provide a more even division of
couples than has been the rule in the
past.
