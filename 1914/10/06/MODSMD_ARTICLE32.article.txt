# French Admit German Offensive.
## 
### 
Paris, Oct. 6.â€”The Germans, who
have received reinforcements, have
gained slightly at some points, and
have been repulsed at others. It is an
nounced that the fighting continues
unabated on the left, but that nowhere
has our line been penetrated. Our
general flanking movement is still ex
tending northward, fresh troops being
used where the pressure of the Ger
man resistance is greatest. The Teu
tons are endeavoring to develop a new
offensive movement along the Mouse,
in the East, and their day and night at
tacks continue.
