# BREATHING UNNECESSARY FOR LIFE AT STANFORD
## Conservation of Campus Ozone Tried for Two Hours by Ten Mining Majors. 
### 
Ten healthy representatives of the
Stanford community wandered over
the farm for twenty-four minutes this
afternoon without Inhaling a breath.
Then, to show how little they cared
for the pure free ozone of the campus,
they entered a room filled with
smoke and deadly fumes and remained
for an hour, enjoying the gases.
The secret of this "stunt" was the
self-contained oxygen breathing appa
ratus that they were trying out. These
instruments are used in mines which
have bad air and dangerous gases, and
hereafter mining students will learn
the use of them at Stanford.
Professor Folsom. of the Mining De
partment. has engaged F. Steidle and
CI. W. Rings to Instruct stndents in the
uso of Iho instruments and in first aid
to tho injured in mines.
The men who underwent today's ex
periment were P. P. Carlton. '14; V.
F. Kinir. '1f»; F. Nays. '14; P. Temple
