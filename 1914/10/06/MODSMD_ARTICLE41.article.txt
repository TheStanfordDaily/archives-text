# Y.M.C.A. STARTS CLASSES IN ENGLISH FOR ALIENS
## Seven Students Volunteer to Instruct Redwood Foreigners in Rudiments of Language. 
### 
In answer to the call sounded
through the columns of The Daily Palo
Alto for volunteer teachers, seven Stan
ford men are now conducting classes
in English at Redwood City grammar
school for the Greek and Italian labor
ers, who work in the tannery there.
Two classes have been formed, and
more will be organized to meet the
demand. Instruction is given on Mon
day and Friday evenings, the classes
beginning shortly after seven o'clock,
that the student-teachers may get back
to the campus early.
The work is in charge of A. W.
Davies, '14. He is assisted by J. F.
Elden, '16; W. C. Anspach, '17; S. W.
Oberg, '17; L. A. Pier, 'IG, R. A. Don
aldson, '17, and J. L. Gibson, '17. Eacli
man gives one evening a week to
teaching.
The Roberts system of teaching
English is used. Each sentence that
is given the pupils to learn is illus
trated by the teacher.
According to the student-instructors,
who have been teaching the classes for
two weeks, the pupils, about twenty
five in number at present, are enthu
siastic, and learn rapidly. It is ex
pected that inside of a month the
i number of pupils taking work in the
classes will be doubled. The work is
entirely voluntary on the part of the
Stanford students.
