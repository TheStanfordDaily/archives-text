# CALIFORNIA TO ABANDON INTERSCHOLASTIC MEET.
## Owing to Plans of Exposition Officials, Big C Society Will Drop Annual Event. 
### 
Owing to the plans announced by the
I San Francisco Exposition officials of
j conducting the 1!>1 rÂ» interscholastic
! track meet upon a specially construct
| cd oval on the fair grounds, the Big
j C Society, representing all athletic en
-1 terprise at the University of Califor
nia, lias abandoned the idea of giving
the annual meet upon the Berkeley
track.
The reason for the attitude taken is
given in"The Daily Californian."
"Realizing that the new organization
(meaning the High School Teachers'
Federation) would be handicapped if
the University maintained a hostile at
i titude. and sympathizing thoroughly
with the federation's plans, the society
decided to step aside and offer free
rein to the new regime."
It is evident that this sentiment ap
plies to years after 1915, inasmuch as
the Teachers' Federation has turned
over the affairs of next year's inter
scholastic meet to the Fair officials.
The usual Sirkus will be held in the
spring semester, serving as entertain
ment. for visitors from the Exposition
grounds.
