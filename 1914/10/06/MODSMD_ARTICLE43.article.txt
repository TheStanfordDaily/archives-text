# INVINCIBLE ALL-BLACKS WIN INTERNATIONAL GAME
## Eight New Zealanders Who Visited the Campus Last Year Again Distinguish Themselves. 
### 
Campus friends of the All-Black
ruggers will be interested to hear of
their victory in the international game
with New South Wales by the score of
27 to G. Among the members of the
team are found the names of eight of
the "All-Blacks" who visited Stanford'
last year. Murray, Cain, Bruce and
Downing played in the scrum; E. Rob
erts played half; Lynch center three
quarters, and R. Roberts and Lover
idge, wings.
The game was held at the Sydney
Sports ground, where fifteen thousand
people made up the great audience.
The black-jersied warriors scored
eight tries, none of which were con
verted, and one penalty goal to the
single try and penalty goal of the
"Blues."
After an unfortunate injury to Lov
eridge, the only mishap of the game,
Taylor, the substitute wing, who dis
tinguished himself with the All-Blacks
at Stanford last year, played a great
game. E. Roberts, at half, was the
king-pin on which the New Zealand
machinery turned. Time and again,
he set the five-eighths going with a
quick run and snappy pass, which re
sulted in scores.
