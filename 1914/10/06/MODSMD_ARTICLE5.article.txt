# SHAKEUP OF FRESHMAN TEAM PRECEDES GAME
## SANTA CLARA JUNIOR COLLEGE WILL SEND STURDY FIFTEEN INTO ACTION. NEW LINEUP AN IMPROVEMENT WEAK APPEARANCE OF 1918 BACKS IN RECENT MATCHES CAUSES SWEEPING REVISION. 
### 
The fifteen of Santa Clara Junior
College, a team of near varsity cali
ber, will furnish mid-week diversion to
the rugby fans, when they meet the
Stanford freshmen on the turf to
morrow afternoon. The season's sched
ule originally called for a third game
with the ruggers of Palo Alto, but the
local high school authorities notified
Manager Wilcox of their inability to
play, since their team has been weak
ened by injuries and eligibility rulings.
Santa Clara high school is mo.re or
less of an unknown quantity to cam
pus rugby followers, as this will be
their initial appearance on the Stan
ford turf. Tn the A. A. L., the federa
tion of San Francisco schools, howev
er, the team is regarded as a state
championship contender.
The fresnmen line-up has been com
pletely shaken u,Â» and rearranged by
Coach Tlrown. During the past four
games, the baby backfiekl had dis
played miserable form as regards
teamwork, passing or attacking play.
Neither a scoring machine could be
developed, or a strong defensive back
field. and as a result a complete shake
up was necessary.
Greve. who for the past two weeks
has been on the sick list, will again
receive the passes of Halfback Walker,
in his old position at, first five. The
second position will be filled by Kirk
sey, who has been substituting L,ach
mund on the varsity in the same ca
pac'ty. Stafford has been shifted over
to center three-quarters, where his of
fensive style of play will work to
greater advantage. Winters, who
shows great promise, but has yet to
learn the game, will hold down a wing
position opposite Weeks. Neuner
will substitute Walters at fullback.
Among the forwards. Coach Tl.rown an
nounces only two changes. R. Johnson
and Earl will start at middle rank and
breakaway, respectively.
The contest will be made up of two
twenty-five-minute periods, and will
commence promptly at 4:4. r >. Ric Tom
pleton, '15, will hold the whistle. The
1018 fifteen will line-upas follows:
