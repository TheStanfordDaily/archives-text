# HILL IS BEYOND REACH AS BIG GAME REFEREE
## LOCAL MAN WILL BE SECURED TO JUDGE CONTEST. Expense of Bringing Australian Rugby Export to California Considered Prohibitive. 
### 
i Present indications are that local
talent will have to be placed in charge
i of the field at the intercollegiate rugby
. game in November. Conferences be
_ tween Graduate Managers Wilcox and
. Stroud of Stanford and California, re- j
r spectively, have .resulted in practical
. abandonment of the attempt to im
port W. W. Hill from Australia.
The managers have both been hope
-) fill that they would be able to bear j
r the expense of Hill's trip to California, :
r in order that the teams might be as- |
sured of the most expert rulings pos- !
_ sible. ,
1 A minimum outlay of one thousand
dollars would be required for the ven
ture. The executive committee at
Stanford recently voted to meet half
i the expense of bringing a referee from
Australia, with the purpose that Hill
p should send a substitute, in case he
could not come himself. Heavy ex
penses in the athletic department at
California have made Graduate Man
r ager Stroud hesitant in assuming the
. other half of the cost.
Mutual disappointment has been ex
pressed that a substitute will be nec
essary in place of the Australian au
, thority. W. W. Hill visited California
in 1912 with the Australian Waratahs,
and came as referee in the Stanford- i
California game last vca.r.
