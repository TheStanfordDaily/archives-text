and cordially welcomed home to Stan
ford tomorrow at after an ab
sence of fifteen months. All classes

A curious phase of the meeting will
be that Dr. Jo.rdan is scheduled to af
ford the entertainment with a lecture,
which he styles "Confessions of a
Peacemaker." What the nature of the
address will be cannot be stated, but
the fact remains that it will have a
rich background of personal contact
and keen observation of the warring
nations.
During the period which he has spent
roving through all the countries of
Europe and the East, Dr. Jo.rdan has
analyzed the war fever which saturates
the people of the belligerent nations.
Tt is interesting to note that his expla
nation of the present strife turns on
the same psychological point which
was drawn by Professor Lillien J.
Martin in an article printed in the
Daily Palo Alto several weeks ago.
Roth believe the war is the outcome ol
preparedness, and the fact that all Eu
rope has been an armed camp.
There has been little opportunity for

since the outbreak of the war, and a
block of interesting figures may be
expected in his address.
Anecdotes and relation of personal
experiences will be important factors.
Since Dr. Jordan went to Europe in
the summer of 1013 to study the af
termath of the Balkan war, there is a
story to be told about the shifting of
scenes and interest on the battlefield.
