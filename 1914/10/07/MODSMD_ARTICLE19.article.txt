In striving to reach a high plane of
efficiency in journalism, the considera
tion of the advertising columns follows
close on the work of the editorial room,
for the future of any publishing busi
ness—except those with endowments—
is in the development of advertising effi
ciency. The display notices are printed
each day for a purpose, and if they do
not accomplish that purpose then their
worth is nil. "Advertising that draws
trade"—there is room for no other,
either in the expense books of the mer
chant or the columns of the journal.
The monotony of charity advertising
is wearisome, yet it is in the small pa
per, with few advertisements, that the
never-ending sameness is most, notice
able. There is little opportunity for
choice in such a paper, yet we realize
that if the power of choice in buying
is developed, the first step toward
prosperity is taken by publisher and
by merchant. An attractive ad is the
solution.
Responsive circulation is what you
want —working to that end is our task,
as well as yours. Three things we can
guarantee you: the circulation is more
than twelve hundred and fifty copies
per issue, exclusive of waste and ex
tras; the class of .readers is far above
the average stratum of newspaper
public; the readers are interested in
your advertisements, and are willing
to give patronage to the men worth
the trade. There is no possibility of
your card being carried on a level with
patent medicine advertisement, a li
quor advertisement, or the display of
any fraud.
The best weapon with which to fight
the outside firm and mail order house
is Truthful Advertising; others are
after your share in money's distribu
tion—where is your bid for business?
