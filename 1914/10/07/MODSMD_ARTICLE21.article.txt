Bliss Cannon, the author of the fol
lowing poem, is a native of New Bruns
wick, and was at one time editor of the
New York Independent. His poems
ave well known, and have been pub
lished in a number of the popular mag
azines. "Roadside Flowers" is char
acteristic of his style:
We are the .roadside flowers,
Straying from garden grounds;
Lovers of idle hours,
Breakers of ordered bounds.
If only the earth will feed us,
If only the wind be kind.
We blossom for those who need us,
The stragglers left behind.
And 10, the Lord of the Garden,
He makes His sun to rise,
And His rain to fall like pardon
On our dusty paradise.
On us He has laid one duty—
The task of the wandering breed —
To better the world with beauty,
Wherever the way may lead.
Who shall inquire of the season,
Or question the wind when it blows?
We blossom and ask no reason,
The Lord of the Garden knows.
"■ —Bliss Carmon.
