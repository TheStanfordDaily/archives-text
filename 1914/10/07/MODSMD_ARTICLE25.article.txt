United Press Telegraphic Report
Washington, Oct. 7. â€”The most bitter
contest over the war tax in both the
Senate and the House is anticipated
over the question of whether the tax
on whiskey and beer should be heavier,
and whether they should bear the bur
den of the tax. The liquor question
has entirely overshadowed the tax sit
uation. Many of the representatives
are strongly opposed to an increase of
the tax on beer to a dollar and seven
ty-five. The Democratic Senate cau
cus met this morning to hasten the
completion of the report.
