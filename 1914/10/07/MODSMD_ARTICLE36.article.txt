# Sophomore Cast Not Yet Selected.
## 
### 
Owing to the unprecedented compe
tition for parts in "Ready Money," the
sophomore play, the committee an
nounces that the complete cast has not
yet been selected. An exceptional
number of experienced and talented
thespians are striving for the various
roles in the 1917 comedy, which offers
an unusual assortment of strong parts.
F. L. Mathleu, of San Francisco, has
been directing the try-outs, both af
ternoon and evening, for the past three
days.
