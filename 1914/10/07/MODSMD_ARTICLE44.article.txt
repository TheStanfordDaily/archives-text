# LARGE FILM COMPANY LOCATES IN PALO ALTO
## STUDENTS WILL HAVE CHANCE TO APPEAR ON SCREEN. Romantic and Educational Subjects Announced for Production in Near Future. 
### 
Between five and six hundred Stan
j I'ord men and women will have an op
portunity to star as motion picture ac
tors and actresses in the near future.
The Exactus Company, which has lo
; cated at Palo Alto, intends to use
Stanford talent in an immense $15,000
I pageant film of ancient history. Ac
tual work on this immense produc
tion will not commence for several
months. Those wlio show ability in
the work will have chances in other
more important parts. The company
has two regular companies, a Spanish
and a Chinese company. Vacancies in
the latter will probably be filled by
local talent.
Active work has already commenced,
a comedy film having been taken Sun
day, September 27 th, at Red
wood City. The plot was woven
around the hall game between the
married men and bachelors of that
city. The motif of the plot is the de
sire to get away from friend wife and
happy home for one night. And this
in Redwood! The company's actors
came down from the city to Redwood,
where they were met by H. C. Peter
son, curator of the museum, and a di
rector of the company; T. K. Peters,
president and manager of the com
pany, and A. Simpson, ex-'l2, publicity
agent of the concern. At present the
camera men are engaged in taking a
scenic film for the town of Palo Alto.
The name of the motion picture con
cern is the Exactus Photo-Film Cor
poration. Although an independent or
ganization, with its own companies of
actors, and producing its own films, it
also acts as the agent for the Pathe-
Freres Company, to secure material
for I'athe's Weekly. :t has taken the
company over a month to get their
plant into working order ,but they have
transformed the old C'astilleja school,
Bryant street, into a complete moving
picture studio, with all the details of
camera construction shop, developing
and printing laboratories, offices and
dressing rooms carefully arranged.
They have now reached the stage
where actual camera work ran begin.
Their first work will he the produc
tion of several Spanish films for the
English market, where the demand for

j films is great, owing to the shortage
| in the European market, caused by the
war. Their company of Spanish ac
| tors and actresses will arrive within a
I few days.
Pictures have been taken of the fall-
I ing of the wall demolished by the
workers engaged in tearing down the
portion of the museum rendered use
less by the earthquake. Pictures of
Stanford events, such as the Plug Ugly
and the bonfire will be taken from
time to time to make up a story of
Stanford life for the screens. Other
films will he made to show the sccnie
beauty of Stanford LTniversity and Palo
Alto.
But the c hief object of the company
lis to produce educational films. With
this end in view, members of the Stan
ford faculty are co-operating in the
work. On Sunday, September 20,
eleven professors met with the heads
of the Palo Alto schools and other in
fluential citizens to consider the edu
cational possibilities of the motion pic
ture. A. 11. Chamberlain, editor of the
Sierra Educational News, who is in
charge of preparations for the Model
School to be exhibited at the Exposi
tion, spoke to tiie gathering on this
subject. 11. C. Peterson, curator of the
museum, and also a director of the
film corporation, talked on the origin
of the motion picture, and illustrated
his lecture with slides and films which
were taken chiefly on the Stanford
stock farm.
The possibilities of motion pictures
was first suggested by a series of pho
tographs of horses in motion, taken
some thirty years ago on the stock
farm. Pictures of Leland Stanford, Jr.,
on horseback, and of many of the fa
mous racetrack champions owned by
the Stanfords were flashed on the
screen. T. K. Peters, president and
manager of the company, told about
the technical side of the educational
film producing business. Professor
Boone, of the University of California,
also spoke. Following an informal dis
cussion of the subject in its local ap
plication, the visitors were shown
through the plant, which contains
many time-saving devices and other
improvements, which are the patented
nventions of Peters himself.
The Stanford faculty members pres
ent were: Professors F. Angell, E. P.
Cubberley, A. B. Show, J. P. Elmore, C.
I). Marx, ,T. B. Sears, .T. P. Smith, C. H.
I Clevenger, L. E. Bassett, 11. W. Young,
E. P. Leslie, Curator H. C. Peterson.
Curator Peterson has charge of the
campus subscription to the stock of the
corporation.

ford faculty are co-operating in the
work. On Sunday, September 20,
eleven professors met with the heads
of the Palo Alto schools and other in
fluential citizens to consider the edu
cational possibilities of the motion pic
ture. A. 11. Chamberlain, editor of the
Sierra Educational News, who is in
charge of preparations for the Model
School to be exhibited at the Exposi
tion, spoke to tiie gathering on this
subject. 11. C. Peterson, curator of the
museum, and also a director of the
film corporation, talked on the origin
of the motion picture, and illustrated
his lecture with slides and films which
were taken chiefly on the Stanford
stock farm.
The possibilities of motion pictures
was first suggested by a series of pho
tographs of horses in motion, taken
some thirty years ago on the stock
farm. Pictures of Leland Stanford, Jr.,
on horseback, and of many of the fa
mous racetrack champions owned by
the Stanfords were flashed on the
screen. T. K. Peters, president and
manager of the company, told about
the technical side of the educational
film producing business. Professor
Boone, of the University of California,
also spoke. Following an informal dis
cussion of the subject in its local ap
plication, the visitors were shown
through the plant, which contains
many time-saving devices and other
improvements, which are the patented
nventions of Peters himself.
The Stanford faculty members pres
ent were: Professors F. Angell, E. P.
Cubberley, A. B. Show, J. P. Elmore, C.
I). Marx, ,T. B. Sears, .T. P. Smith, C. H.
I Clevenger, L. E. Bassett, 11. W. Young,
E. P. Leslie, Curator H. C. Peterson.
Curator Peterson has charge of the
campus subscription to the stock of the
corporation.
Between five and six hundred Stan
j I'ord men and women will have an op
portunity to star as motion picture ac
tors and actresses in the near future.
The Exactus Company, which has lo
; cated at Palo Alto, intends to use
Stanford talent in an immense $15,000
I pageant film of ancient history. Ac
tual work on this immense produc
tion will not commence for several
months. Those wlio show ability in
the work will have chances in other
more important parts. The company
has two regular companies, a Spanish
and a Chinese company. Vacancies in
the latter will probably be filled by
local talent.
Active work has already commenced,
a comedy film having been taken Sun
day, September 27 th, at Red
wood City. The plot was woven
around the hall game between the
married men and bachelors of that
city. The motif of the plot is the de
sire to get away from friend wife and
happy home for one night. And this
in Redwood! The company's actors
came down from the city to Redwood,
where they were met by H. C. Peter
son, curator of the museum, and a di
rector of the company; T. K. Peters,
president and manager of the com
pany, and A. Simpson, ex-'l2, publicity
agent of the concern. At present the
camera men are engaged in taking a
scenic film for the town of Palo Alto.
The name of the motion picture con
cern is the Exactus Photo-Film Cor
poration. Although an independent or
ganization, with its own companies of
actors, and producing its own films, it
also acts as the agent for the Pathe-
Freres Company, to secure material
for I'athe's Weekly. :t has taken the
company over a month to get their
plant into working order ,but they have
transformed the old C'astilleja school,
Bryant street, into a complete moving
picture studio, with all the details of
camera construction shop, developing
and printing laboratories, offices and
dressing rooms carefully arranged.
They have now reached the stage
where actual camera work ran begin.
Their first work will he the produc
tion of several Spanish films for the
English market, where the demand for

j films is great, owing to the shortage
| in the European market, caused by the
war. Their company of Spanish ac
| tors and actresses will arrive within a
I few days.
Pictures have been taken of the fall-
I ing of the wall demolished by the
workers engaged in tearing down the
portion of the museum rendered use
less by the earthquake. Pictures of
Stanford events, such as the Plug Ugly
and the bonfire will be taken from
time to time to make up a story of
Stanford life for the screens. Other
films will he made to show the sccnie
beauty of Stanford LTniversity and Palo
Alto.

son, curator of the museum, and a di
rector of the company; T. K. Peters,
president and manager of the com
pany, and A. Simpson, ex-'l2, publicity
agent of the concern. At present the
camera men are engaged in taking a
scenic film for the town of Palo Alto.
The name of the motion picture con
cern is the Exactus Photo-Film Cor
poration. Although an independent or
ganization, with its own companies of
actors, and producing its own films, it
also acts as the agent for the Pathe-
Freres Company, to secure material
for I'athe's Weekly. :t has taken the
company over a month to get their
plant into working order ,but they have
transformed the old C'astilleja school,
Bryant street, into a complete moving
picture studio, with all the details of
camera construction shop, developing
and printing laboratories, offices and
dressing rooms carefully arranged.
They have now reached the stage
where actual camera work ran begin.
Their first work will he the produc
tion of several Spanish films for the
English market, where the demand for

j films is great, owing to the shortage
| in the European market, caused by the
war. Their company of Spanish ac
| tors and actresses will arrive within a
I few days.
Pictures have been taken of the fall-
I ing of the wall demolished by the
workers engaged in tearing down the
portion of the museum rendered use
less by the earthquake. Pictures of
Stanford events, such as the Plug Ugly
and the bonfire will be taken from
time to time to make up a story of
Stanford life for the screens. Other
films will he made to show the sccnie
beauty of Stanford LTniversity and Palo
Alto.
But the c hief object of the company
lis to produce educational films. With
this end in view, members of the Stan
ford faculty are co-operating in the
work. On Sunday, September 20,
eleven professors met with the heads
of the Palo Alto schools and other in
fluential citizens to consider the edu
cational possibilities of the motion pic
ture. A. 11. Chamberlain, editor of the
Sierra Educational News, who is in
charge of preparations for the Model
School to be exhibited at the Exposi
tion, spoke to tiie gathering on this
subject. 11. C. Peterson, curator of the
museum, and also a director of the
film corporation, talked on the origin
of the motion picture, and illustrated
his lecture with slides and films which
were taken chiefly on the Stanford
stock farm.
The possibilities of motion pictures
was first suggested by a series of pho
tographs of horses in motion, taken
some thirty years ago on the stock
farm. Pictures of Leland Stanford, Jr.,
on horseback, and of many of the fa
mous racetrack champions owned by
the Stanfords were flashed on the
screen. T. K. Peters, president and
manager of the company, told about
the technical side of the educational
film producing business. Professor
Boone, of the University of California,
also spoke. Following an informal dis
cussion of the subject in its local ap
plication, the visitors were shown
through the plant, which contains
many time-saving devices and other
improvements, which are the patented
nventions of Peters himself.
The Stanford faculty members pres
ent were: Professors F. Angell, E. P.
Cubberley, A. B. Show, J. P. Elmore, C.
I). Marx, ,T. B. Sears, .T. P. Smith, C. H.
