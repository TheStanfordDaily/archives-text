## H.J. Packard, '11, Describes Battle and Personal Experiences in South American Revolution. 
### 
Word has just been received from H.
J. Packard, '11, in Venezuela, relating
his exciting experiences in a revolu
tion, which is now going on tlie.re.
Packard, who is a geologist for the
Mar her Asphalt Company, under the
supervision of R. Arnold, '00, left
Guanoco on a small steamer, which
neglected to take out clearance papers.
The vessel was captured hy a federal
gunboat, and all the the crew and pas
sengers made captives. After being
taken to a government fortress, they
were released and succeeded in getting
to Trinidad.
From Trinidad, Packard returned to
Guanoco on a ship flying the United
States flag. Soon after he landed, the
city, which was held by revolutionists,
was attacked by government troops.
The federal soldiers, who endeavored
to make a landing from rafts, were re
pulsed with terrible loss by the revolu
tionists, about four hundred of them
being killed before Packard's eyes.
In a week the city changed hands sev
eral times.
"Work in the asphalt lakes," writes
Packard, " is now practically at a
standstill, owing to the European
war."
