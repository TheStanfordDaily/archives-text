# FRESHMEN TIE GAME WITH JUNIOR TEAM IN HARD SCRIMMAGE
## Rearranged 1918 Backfield Displays Improved Form With Brilliant Passing Rushes and Snappy Play on Stanford Turf SCORE BOARD READS 0 TO 0 
### 
The Freshmen came back this
evening somewhere in the region of
5:45 o'clock. Santa Clara's Junior
team of near-varsity calibre failed to
discount the skill of Eighteen, and
dusk settled over two zeros on the
record.
With the single exception of Schultz,
the Mission fifteen was the one which
held the Blacks to an 8 to 4 victory.
There was open play throughout,
and the game held the sympathies of
the bleachers. Frequent muffs and
fumbles were due to too good a will,
so much can be forgiven.
The last fifteen minutes displayed
a strength and pluck in defense
against the heavy visitors which goes
far to redeem past performances.
First Half
Neuner's kick at 4:45 sent the ball
into a ten minute forward battle at
center between the opposing scrums.
Early in the game, the Freshman
backs displayed a keen interest in fol
lowing the ball, and open play was
frequent, but over-eager.
A passing excursion downfield from
center, effected by Walker, Ureve and
Kirksey, removed the game from neu
tral teritory for most of the remainder
of the half.
A chance at a penalty kick at twen
ty-five yard l : ne was not negotiated
by Neuner. Cyphers decorated the
score board at half time.
Under the urgent skill of Diez, and
Thomas, second five and right wing
respectively for the Mission team, a
last minute battery of Santa Clara
was turned on the Stanford goal.
Walker, Greve, Kirksey, and Weeks,
who covered all the field brilliantly,
encouraged passing gains which turn
ed the play back into a safe neighbor
hood.
Second Half
Floyd Brown turned loose a revised
back field in an effort to cancel the
uncertain passing which marred an
otherwise pretty combination in the
first period.
Santa Clara opened a surprise pack
age early in the second frame by show
'ng that her backfield had a good
brand of rugby in .reserve.
Time after time the Catholic boys
hammered for a hole in the Cardinal
defense. The fighting called forth a
splendid spirit of play during the last
fifteen minutes.
The tactics of the visiting backs were
splendid, but the 1018 defense filled all
holes. A spurt after gun sound placed
the ball at center.
The two teams lined up as follows:
Santa Clara —Amaral O'Neill, Mar
tin, Korte, Christy, Hickey, Winston,
Donahue, forwards; Aurrecochio, half;
Tinocchio, Diaz, flv»- eights; Hearns,
center; Emerson, Thomas, wings;

fifteen minutes.
The tactics of the visiting backs were
splendid, but the 1018 defense filled all
holes. A spurt after gun sound placed
the ball at center.
The two teams lined up as follows:
Santa Clara —Amaral O'Neill, Mar
tin, Korte, Christy, Hickey, Winston,
Donahue, forwards; Aurrecochio, half;
Tinocchio, Diaz, flv»- eights; Hearns,
center; Emerson, Thomas, wings;
Jackson, full.
Freshman—C.reer (Bihlman), Hain
es, Stevick, Cole (Ford), R. Johnson,
Earl (Fisher), McArthur, Card, for
wards: Walker, half: Greve (Jeffers),
Kirksey, five eights; Neuner (Staf
ord). center; Weeks, Winters (C. John
son), wings; Walters, full.
The Freshmen came back this
evening somewhere in the region of
5:45 o'clock. Santa Clara's Junior
team of near-varsity calibre failed to
discount the skill of Eighteen, and
dusk settled over two zeros on the
record.
With the single exception of Schultz,
the Mission fifteen was the one which
held the Blacks to an 8 to 4 victory.
There was open play throughout,
and the game held the sympathies of
the bleachers. Frequent muffs and
fumbles were due to too good a will,
so much can be forgiven.
The last fifteen minutes displayed
a strength and pluck in defense
against the heavy visitors which goes
far to redeem past performances.
First Half
Neuner's kick at 4:45 sent the ball
into a ten minute forward battle at
center between the opposing scrums.
Early in the game, the Freshman
backs displayed a keen interest in fol
lowing the ball, and open play was
frequent, but over-eager.
A passing excursion downfield from
center, effected by Walker, Ureve and
Kirksey, removed the game from neu
tral teritory for most of the remainder
of the half.
A chance at a penalty kick at twen
ty-five yard l : ne was not negotiated
by Neuner. Cyphers decorated the
score board at half time.
Under the urgent skill of Diez, and
Thomas, second five and right wing
respectively for the Mission team, a
last minute battery of Santa Clara
was turned on the Stanford goal.
Walker, Greve, Kirksey, and Weeks,
who covered all the field brilliantly,
encouraged passing gains which turn
ed the play back into a safe neighbor
hood.
Second Half
Floyd Brown turned loose a revised
back field in an effort to cancel the
uncertain passing which marred an
otherwise pretty combination in the
first period.
Santa Clara opened a surprise pack
age early in the second frame by show
'ng that her backfield had a good
brand of rugby in .reserve.
Time after time the Catholic boys
hammered for a hole in the Cardinal
defense. The fighting called forth a
splendid spirit of play during the last
fifteen minutes.
