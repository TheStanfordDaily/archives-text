direct the rehearsals.
"Ready Money" is from the pen of
James Montgomery, a young New York
actor, who jumped into fame over
night with this brilliant comedy. While
romance is by no means a dead issue
in the play, love interest is decidedly
secondary to that of the farcical ele
ment. Money is the main theme of
the comedy, as the title suggests, and
the ways and means by which the va
rious characters become absorbed in
its pursuit fairly sweeps the specta
tor off his feet in a riot of wholesome
farce.
All of the parts are rich in acting
values, even the bits offering rare op
portunities for individual character
ization.
"Stephen Baird," the leading role,
in which William Courtenay starred in
New York, will be interpreted by F. B.
Johnston, while "Jackson Ives," tlie
senior lead, will be played by F. C.
McColloch. Both are suited physically
as well as temperamentally to these
strong parts.
