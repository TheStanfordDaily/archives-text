# On the Outside Looking In

It's the unexpected, sudden strain
that finds the flaw in the casting—this
morning's assembly of the culture of
nearby towns and of the few fortunate
students was the sudden strain, the
relation of the Business Office, as im
personated by Mr. Vanderlynn Stow, to
the academic administration, was the
flaw; and the miserable mismanage
ment of the welcome-home gathering
for Chancellor Jordan is the surface
indication of the flaw —the inability of
the business management to place au
thority in its proper sphere.
As evidence of mismanagement this
morning there were countless mis
haps; the futile attempts of students
and instructors, just released from
class, to gain admittance; the sharp
ness with which the no-crowding or
der was enforced on women and men
alike: the insistence of doorkeepers
for those elusive slips of red paste
board that spelled "Open Sesame."
The crux of the situation is the de
lay of the San Francisco office in send
ing instructions regarding use of ad
mission tickets to the proper authori
ty. The first direct word to any per
son in authority in respect to general
academic affairs, was received at a late
hour last night, too late to devise any
scheme of distribution. The Presi
dent's office had no official word of
such intent on the part of the Busi
ness Manager, in whose hands is the
control of all campus buildings, and
it follows that the Faculty Committee
on Public Exercises is entirely blame
less.
The action of the local representa
tive of the Business Office in carrying
out the orders for the distribution of
admission tickcts followed the deter
mination of the very evident inability
of the President's Office to handle the
situation at a moment's notice. For
obeying the orders of his superiors to
the letter, a man may not be censured,
though over-zeal in the performance
of duty may be ground for criticism.
In May, 1914, the graduate manager
of the Associated Students was noti
fied of the necessity of limiting at
tendance to the seating capacity of
the hall, sixteen hundred and twenty.
As this matter was very evidently
not within the jurisdiction of
such an agent, a reply asking for the
source of the authorization was made
to Vanderlynn Stow. No official no
tice was received.
The limiting of the number of au
ditors to the seating capacity is a
step taken by the Board of Trustees to
lessen danger in case of fire or panic,
and as a precaution against personal
liability for accidents of overcrowd
ing. The first rights of students and
faculty for admittance were to be pro
tected by issuance of tickets.

This was a good plan in cases where
the crowd was expected to be unusual,
tho certainly unnecessary for the av
erage assembly. But the distribution
of such cards of privilege should be
at the discretion of the President of
the University, whose knowledge of lo
cal conditions is accurate, whose sense
of the .relative importance of things
is a mobile one. It would seem that
being on the spot was the first requi
site for management of student or ac
ademic affairs.
A second trial may prove a fairer
test of the plan, but today's start was
not propitious.

the academic administration, was the
flaw; and the miserable mismanage
ment of the welcome-home gathering
for Chancellor Jordan is the surface
indication of the flaw —the inability of
the business management to place au
thority in its proper sphere.
As evidence of mismanagement this
morning there were countless mis
haps; the futile attempts of students
and instructors, just released from
class, to gain admittance; the sharp
ness with which the no-crowding or
der was enforced on women and men
alike: the insistence of doorkeepers
for those elusive slips of red paste
board that spelled "Open Sesame."
The crux of the situation is the de
lay of the San Francisco office in send
ing instructions regarding use of ad
mission tickets to the proper authori
ty. The first direct word to any per
son in authority in respect to general
academic affairs, was received at a late
hour last night, too late to devise any
scheme of distribution. The Presi
dent's office had no official word of
such intent on the part of the Busi
ness Manager, in whose hands is the
control of all campus buildings, and
it follows that the Faculty Committee
on Public Exercises is entirely blame
less.
The action of the local representa
tive of the Business Office in carrying
out the orders for the distribution of
admission tickcts followed the deter
mination of the very evident inability
of the President's Office to handle the
situation at a moment's notice. For
obeying the orders of his superiors to
the letter, a man may not be censured,
though over-zeal in the performance
of duty may be ground for criticism.
In May, 1914, the graduate manager
of the Associated Students was noti
fied of the necessity of limiting at
tendance to the seating capacity of
the hall, sixteen hundred and twenty.
As this matter was very evidently
not within the jurisdiction of
such an agent, a reply asking for the
source of the authorization was made
to Vanderlynn Stow. No official no
tice was received.
The limiting of the number of au
ditors to the seating capacity is a
step taken by the Board of Trustees to
lessen danger in case of fire or panic,
and as a precaution against personal
liability for accidents of overcrowd
ing. The first rights of students and
faculty for admittance were to be pro
tected by issuance of tickets.

This was a good plan in cases where
the crowd was expected to be unusual,
tho certainly unnecessary for the av
erage assembly. But the distribution
of such cards of privilege should be
at the discretion of the President of
the University, whose knowledge of lo
cal conditions is accurate, whose sense
of the .relative importance of things
is a mobile one. It would seem that
being on the spot was the first requi
site for management of student or ac
ademic affairs.
A second trial may prove a fairer
test of the plan, but today's start was
not propitious.
It's the unexpected, sudden strain
that finds the flaw in the casting—this
morning's assembly of the culture of
nearby towns and of the few fortunate
students was the sudden strain, the
relation of the Business Office, as im
personated by Mr. Vanderlynn Stow, to
the academic administration, was the
flaw; and the miserable mismanage
ment of the welcome-home gathering
for Chancellor Jordan is the surface
indication of the flaw —the inability of
