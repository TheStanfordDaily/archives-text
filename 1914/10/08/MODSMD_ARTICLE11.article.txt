# The 						God of War

Israel Zangwill, journalist and edi
tor, may fittingly be called a "man of
letters." Perhaps the best known of
his dramas is "The Melting Pot," al
though since then he has written "The
War God" and"The Next Religion."
His attitude toward war is in direct
opposition to that recently taken by
Roosevelt, who stated that the United
States, in order to keep peace, must be
well prepared for war.
"To safeguard peace we must prepare
for war"—
I know that maxim; it was forged in
hell.
This wealth of ships and guns in
flames the vulgar
And makes the very war it guards
against.
The God of War is now a man of busi
ness,
With vested interests.
So much sunk Capital, such countless
callings,
The Army, Navy, Medicine, the
Church—
To bless and bury—Music, Engineer
ing,
Red-tape Departments, Commissariats,
Stores, Transports, Ammunition, Coal
ing Stations,
Fortifications. Cannon-foundries, Ship
yards,
Arsenals, Ranges, Drill-Halls, Float
ing docks,
War-loan Promoters. Military Tailors,
Camp-followers, Canteens, War Corre
spondents,
T-Torse-breeders, Armourers, Torpedo
builders,
Pipeclay and Medical Vendors, Pig
Drum Makers,
Gold Lace Embroiderers, Opticians,
Buglers,
Tent-makers, Banner-weavers, Powder
mixers.
Crutches and Cork Limb Manufactur
ers,
Balloonists. Mappists, T-Teliographers,
Inventors. Flying Men, and Diving De
mons,
Beelzebub, and all his hosts, who,
whethe.r
In Water, Earth, or Air, among them
pocket
When Trade is brisk a million pounds
a week!
