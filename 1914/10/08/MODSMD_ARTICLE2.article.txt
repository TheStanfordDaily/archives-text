# Kolb and Dill May Again Be Attraction For Football Show
## 
### 
Kolh and 13111 and their company at
the Gaiety Theatre will probably be
the football show entertainers on the
evening of November 14, after the Big
Game. It was planned by the Execu
tive Committee last evening to secure
San Francisco's newest theatre, featur
ing the old favorites, for the occa
sion.
Having gained a reputation for good,
live productions all over the Pacific
coast, Kolb and Dill do not require
any introduction to Stanford theatre
goers. In 1912 the tie game played
with California was celebrated at the
old Savoy theatre with the amiable
Dutchmen in the leading roles, and
that affair was one of the most suc
cessful football shows ever held in
San Francisco. The celebration of last
year's victory was held in the Assem
bly hall with a Ram's Head production
on the boards.
Kolb and Dill have been playing at
the Gaiety for over a month with "Peck
o' Pickles" as their vehicle of merri
ment, drawing packed houses every
evening. Beginning next Monday, their
program changes and"The Rollicking
Girl" will be produced.
A lengthy discussion of the choice
of a big game referee and the matter of
holding the football rally on the turf
instead of in the Assembly Hall, re
sulted in no decision being reached.
Minutes of the Executive Committee
meeting, October 6, 1914:

proposition to have the football rally
