Upturning Santa Clnrmi Meets Death.
Edward L. Byrcl, ex'll, a teach
er of manual training at the
Santa Clara High School, met in
stant death last evening when the
motorcycle on which he was re
turning to his home in Santa Clara
from the freshman football game,
plunged into the rear end of a slow
moving hay wagon. By.rd, who was a
spectator at the Santa Clara-Freshman
game in the afternoon, had just round
ed a sharp turn near the Barron estate
on the road to San .Tose. when a large,
heavily-laden wagon loomed out of the
darkness. Byrd attempted to stop the
the speed at which he was going, and
the short distance between the wagon
prevented him from evading the ve
hicle. and the motorcycle carried him
at a rate of twenty-five miles an hour
to his doom.
