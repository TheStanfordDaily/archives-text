### 
The October "Sequoia" is ready for
sale on the Quad Friday morning, and
a heavy demand is assured by the
j timely interest and quality of the con
j tents. The leading article of the issue,
"The Tennis Team in the East,"
written by R. L. Murray, '13, gives an
account of the trip east during the
past summer of the Stanford duo, who
were successful in defeating the rep
resentatives of the large eastern
schools, and emphasizes the signifi
cance of these victories regarding the
future of tennis at Stanford. The
article is of especial interest at this
time to campus people, in that the
author makes an appeal for raising
tennis to the rank of major sports at
this institution. This proposition is
being agitated among the students at
present.
"One of Our Unappreciated Opportu
nities" is a seasonable article written
by Miss Anita Allen, '17, in which it is
shown that Stanford people, as &
whole, fail to realize thoroughly, the
value of the art college in the museum.
The fiction department is well cared
for by writers who are favorably
known by their past work. J. W.
Bennett, '15, is the author of "The In
terference of John," a story of good
literary merit, and made doubly inter
esting by its campus setting. "Leary"
is a newspaper story by H. M. Levy,
'16, whose name insures the readers
an interesting narrative.
Harry Franz, '17, departs from the
usual form of story in"The Untutored
Ear," in which he portrays an inter
esting psychological situation, arising
from the first visit to grand opera of
an untutored man, whose conceptions
and ideas of it had been gained at sec
ond hand.
The verse is from the pens of Glenn
Hughes, '16, whose poetical efforts
have been well received in the past,
and Miss Dare Stark. '17 whose work
in this line is of high grade. Hughes'
contribution bears the single title of
"Vagabond," while Miss Stark has
! headed her stanzas the "Song of Young
l Psyche." Clippings of deserving verso
j taken from contemporary publications
j will he found among the advertise
! nients in the back of the book.
Editorial comment is up-to-date, and
will give the reader new viewpoints to
consider in matters of interest on the
campus. Editor E. H. Ford. '14, an
! nounces his policy of publishing one
j or two articles each month on subjects !
of current interest to Stanford. The
following of this policy in the cur
rent issue lias resulted in a representa
tive publication, which is of interest to
University students.
