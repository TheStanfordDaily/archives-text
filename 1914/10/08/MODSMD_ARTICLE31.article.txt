# BOTANY LIBRARY TURNED INTO GARDEN OF FLOWERS
## 
### 
The botany library was turned into
a veritable flower garden yesterday
afternoon, when dahlias of every kind
and color were placed there on exhibi
tion. The purpose of the exhibition
was to impress those interested in
plant evolution with the remarkable
change which has come to this partic
ular kind of plant life during the last
forty years.
The dahlia was originally found in
Mexico, and until after the Civil War,
the stiff, conventional dahlia of the
native type was the only species. From
1870 the change and development of
the dahlia has continued, until at the
present time there is no flower which
possesses mo.re shades of color, nor a
greater variety of curious and beau
tiful forms than the dahlia.
