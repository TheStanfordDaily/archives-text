# UNSUCCESSFUL BUT RIGHT CONFESSES PEACEMAKER
## Blind Folly of Conflict Pictured by Chancellor Jordan After Travel in Warring Countries. 
### 
Chancellor Jordan's "Confessions of
a Peacemaker" were heard eagerly this
morning by the students and instruct
ors who won in the scramble for seats
after an outside populace had been
accommodated.
The address given by Dr. Jordan as
a greeting to Stanford after sixteen
months' absence, was a bird's-eye es
timate of the European conflict from
its inception. He began and ended
the hour with Norman Angell's re
marks concerning the efficiency of the
last peace conference: "We were not
successful. We were merely right.''
From the beginning the remarks
were illuminated with shades of per
sonal contact and experience which
appealed with the force of first-hand
information.

"There is nothing 'n all history tc
compare with the horror of Europe to
day. Wc can only look at the news-

papers, and see accounts of battles as
groat as Waterloo, Sedan--battl e in
which nothing is done except to fill
nine-mile tranches of dead, or to eff-u (
a two-mile advance."
I laving so evented a backgvound of
hopelessness and massive horro • for
his "confessions," I)r. Jordan contin
ued:

The great, nations involved have been
building over a volcano during bite

to set it off, war was the inevitable re

Ktiurii" Paradox Kx plained.
"We v,lie worke ' fn.r papee last year
are accused of stating a paradox, in
saying first, that war was inevitable,
and second, that there would be no
war. There was no paradox. We
knew thai if (lie armament race were

| not ended, war was inevitable, but we
! considered that there would not be
! war, because we were sure that the
nations would shy off in an extremity.
"We counted on the common sense,
; common decency, common honesty, and

i wealthy enough to finance the war.

"The war-torn nations are now

! $40,000 for everv man killed.
"We counted on labor to fend off the
j calamity, and on international right.
I Its true, as I heard in England, that
If those who make wars had to fight
them, there would be no wars.' The
people don't want war.
"I have been among eighteen peoples
of Europe since I left you, and by talk
in.; to them I have learned pretty well
what they think. Even in the mangled

and fevered Balkans the people have
had enough.
"Hut when the band begins to play
the excitement and visions of glory
spring into being, the people fall in
with the music.
"We were not successful. Even
though financial, industrial, and com
mercial interests were against the
war. The business houses of Europe
fought the war. We have learned in
our study that lack of money and re
sources will not keep nations out oi
the mesh of conflict.
"If the United States were divided in
nine districts, all the property of one
district might sustain Ibe expense ol
(lie warring nations for one year. Hut
expense in money and life does not

much around the obligations of the
Triple MPance and the Triple Entente;
