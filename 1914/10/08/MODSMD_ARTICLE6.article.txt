# UNSUCCESSFUL BUT RIGHT CONFESSES PEACEMAKER
## Blind Folly of Conflict Pictured by Chancellor Jordan After Travel in Warring Countries. 
### 
Chancellor Jordan's "Confessions of
a Peacemaker" were heard eagerly this
morning by the students and instruct
ors who won in the scramble for seats
after an outside populace had been
accommodated.
The address given by Dr. Jordan as
a greeting to Stanford after sixteen
months' absence, was a bird's-eye es
timate of the European conflict from
its inception. He began and ended
the hour with Norman Angell's re
marks concerning the efficiency of the
last peace conference: "We were not
successful. We were merely right.''
From the beginning the remarks
were illuminated with shades of per
sonal contact and experience which
appealed with the force of first-hand
information.
