"The President's office had its first
notice of the intended use of tickets
for admission to the assembly after
nine o'clock last night. It was then too
late to have the tickets distributed to
students and faculty through the Reg
istrar's office, as they would have been,
if we had known of their use three or
four days in advance of the assembly.
The difficulty is not likely to occur
again." JOHN C. RRANNER.
