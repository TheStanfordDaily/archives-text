Rooters' Day! Tomorrow afternoon
when the Varsity and second lineup
trot on the field and engage the
Winged "0" and Oakland High for the
benefit of the biggest bleacher con
gregation of the year, Yell-Leader Nix
on and his cohorts will spring their
surprises.
The second appearance of the
Olympic clnb men will be made at
three-thirty. The Cardinal team re
tains the combination of men which
has been rounded into strength in the
earliest games. More substitutes have
been provided than ever before, and
Coach Brown expects to give them all
a workout in fast company.
One month ago the Olympics carried
away the small end of a big score, and
have not been given a chance to take
their .revenge since that time. Califor
nia played them a 13-3 match on Sep
tember 2fi, the score showing an evi
dent growth of skill.
Oakland will send a worthy opponent
to test the merits of the Second Varsi
ty fifteen at 2:30. The Mole City boys
have won a high .rating in preparatory
school rugby circles, and will be re
membered for the trouncing they ad
ministered to the Sumford F.reshmen.
Opening the season with a tie game
against Lowell, the high school play
ers have maintained their winning
streak.
Varsity runners-up, who have de
veloped a habit of displaying good
football every Saturday afternoon will
be placed at their regular positions on
the second team.
The Freshmen have been matched
with San Jose, and will show their
paces at 11 o'clock. After several
weeks' slump, 1918 went a long way to
ward winning back the respect of the
campus by holding a Strong Santa
Clara team to no score last Wednes
day.
