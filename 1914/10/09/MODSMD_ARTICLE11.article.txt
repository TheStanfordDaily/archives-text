Shibe Park, Philadelphia, Oct. 9.—
The Braves took the first game of the
World's Baseball Series this afternoon
at Philadelphia, by a score of 7 to t.
Rudolph and Gowdy constituted the
battery for the victors, while Bender
and Schang started the game for Phil
adelphia. Bender was hit so consist
ently that Wychoff was sent in to pitch
in the sixth inning. Schang was re
placed by Lapp in the seventh. A total
of eleven hits were made from the
Philadelphia pitchers, while only five
were gleaned from Rudolph.
A line of baseball enthusiasts over
six blocks long, containing more than
three thousand diamond fans, extend
ed from Shibe Park at early daybreak
this morning. The great majority spent
the entire evening there, either sitting
on boxes or leaning against the walls
of the park in an attempt to sleep.
The gates to the grounds were opened
at ten o'clock this morning. The best
places in the line were purchasable at
a dollar and a half, a number of boys
endeavoring to sell out. Weather Fore
caster George Bliss made the predic
tion this morning of "Favorable weath
er for the first game." Since the storm
coming from the direction of the Miss
issippi valley had changed its course,
the indications confirmed a clear day.
The game tomorrow will be played at
Philadelphia, in accordance with the
newly-inaugurated policy of limiting
one-day stands. The third and fourth
games will lie at Boston, while Phila
delphia will take the fifth and Boston
the sixth. The place of the seventh
game, in case it is necessary to play it.
will be determined by tossing a. coin.
This first game seems to discredit
the "dope ' which has been compiled
regarding the relatiw merits of the
two teams. Statistics have it that the
Braves are the weaker in stick work,
and stronger in fielding. Boston's two
errors and eleven hits tend to .reverse
these decisions.
