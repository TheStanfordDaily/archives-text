Eye-Witness of Battle.
The following dispatch was sent
from Wirballen, on the east border of
East Prussia, eighty-five miles east of
Konigsberg, Wednesday, by Carl von
Weigand.
Wirballen. via Berlin and wireless
from Nauen to Sayville, Oct. 7.—"I am
accompanying German troops into
Russia as the first English-speaking
correspondent on the Russian fron
tier. T witnessed a terrific battle
wherein the Russians cannonaded the
German positions with their field ar
tillery. The ground shook and the
roar of the guns was like thunder, but
the Germans stood, returning the fire
slowly and deliberately. The Russians
failed in their attempt to roll up the
German left wing, but yesterday this
part of the German battlefront was
hard pressed. During last night, how
ever, strong reinforcements were
rushed to the German left, enabling it
to hold its positions."
Rattle Waxes Fierce on Teuton Right
Paris. Oct. 9.—The allied forces arc
engaged in a fierce and powerful ad
vance against the Teuton right flank.
The fighting is continuous about the
southwest angle of the Aisne battle
line, where the combined armies of von
Kluk and von Boehm turn sharply
northward. Gallieni, French military
governor of Paris, states: "Situation
satisfactory." The bulk of the fight
ing is apparently confined to the two
wings of the opposing armies. The
French are making a concerted at
tempt to pierce the German line above
Camp Desromans, the extreme point
of the enemy's loft wing. The west
ern line of the allied forces now ex
tends nearly to the frontier of Hol
land.
Gunners Only Needed in Antwerp.
London, Oct. 9.—Experts are opti
mistic and expect that the defense of
Antwerp will continue. The guns of
the forts are superbly served, and
the grounds thereabouts are accurate
ly mapped. As a result the artillery
fire upon the attackers is deadly. The
German stormers are compelled to
mass their troops, while the Belgians
require only enough in the forts to
serve the guns. The defenders are
confident of victory, and their morale
is excellent. A news agency dispatch
claims that a large German force at
tempted to pierce the allied line south
of Antwerp, but was decoyed into a
trap and annihilated.
