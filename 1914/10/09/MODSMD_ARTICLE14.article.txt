Rooters day—the biggest crowd of
the season out to see what promises to
be the best rugby of the season. Thir
ty-five sheets remain to be torn from
the daily calendar before the Day of
days is reached, and the one-game
series is opened that in California col
lege circles completely eclipses in im
portance the struggle of the Athletics
and Braves for world honors. Five
week-end games remain for the varsi
ty, five times the bleacher athletes
will turn out to clock the paces of
their favorites.
All of which reminds us that there
is a definite need of new bleacher
songs, and possibly for a new yell,
a need that will have to be filled be
fore the season is older. Cognizant of
this fact, the Executive Committee ap
pointed a committee to order a new
supply of tuneful melodies for the
high-perched warblers, the report to be
made at an early date. As original col
lege songs worth while are not ground
out of any nickel-in-the-slot song fac
tory, the problem is one to be solved
by co-operation with those acquainted
with the intricacies of five-lines and
four spaces. A good song may need
inspiration, but as a serious effort
would it not be worth the while of
some of our talent now devoted to bur
lesque?
The Stanford Band will be the big
red blot in the bleachers again tomor
row ; the inclusion of some of the old
songs, worth the breath expended, in
the program would be appreciated.
"Down in the Country of the Car
dinal" was oft sung in other years,
and it would seem well to try it out
on the present generation. That com
position deserves a niche in the hall
for good 'old songs.'

The leader of the Glee Club, which
performed so creditably at Thursday's
assembly, evidently had a metronome
of some proportions within hearing,
with the pendulum set at 'short and
snappy.' The happy medium for the
mete.rand expression would seem to
be an ideal impossible to attain.
