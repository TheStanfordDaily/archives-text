Paul Laurence Dunbar was a negro
write.v of short stories and verse, be
ing specially noted for his dialect
work. His writing portrays the sen
timent of the colored people, and his
poetry has won for him the name of
"the most eminent poet of his race in
America." He lived from 1S72-1906.
Today's verse is a sample of his short
er lyrics.
The trees bend down along the stream,
Where anchored swings my tiny boat.
The day is one to drowse and dream
And list to the thrush's throttling note.
When music from his bosom bleeds
Among the river's rustling reeds.
No ripple stirs the placid pool,
When my adventurous line is cast,
A truce to sport, while clear and cool,
The mirrored clouds slide softly past.
The sky gives back a blue divine.
And all the world's wide wealth is
mine.
A pickerel leaps, a bow of light,
The minnows shine from side to side.
The first faint breeze comes up tide —
I pause with uplifted oar,
While night drifts down to claim the
shore.
—Paul Laurence Dunbar.
