# Antwerp Holds Only Small Garrison.

### 
Ghent, Oct. 9. â€”Antwerp still holds.
The bombardment of the forts contin
ued all night, and occasionally a shell
dropped in the city. Scores of aviators
are signalling the German range. Ref
ugees say that the Belgian troops are
leaving, and that the King left only
sufficient troops to man the forts. The
censors withhold the news of where
the Belgians are concentrating. It is
unofficially reported that the King and
staff have reached Zelsaele, southwest
of here.
