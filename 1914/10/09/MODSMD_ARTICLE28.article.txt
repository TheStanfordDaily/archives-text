Simple Simon wants to know: IE
all the Germans go to war, who's go
ing to wind the watch on the Rhine?
News item: "War Cuts Off Supply
of Apollinaris and Hunyadi Yanos."
Here's an opportunity for local en

Many a man objects to "setting-up"
exercises in the gym, but along toward
midnight in a neighboring county with
his foot on a rail, he'll find great pleas
ure in the same sort of thing.
The roughs of the Engineering cor
ner have expressed little interest in
the modern dances up to now, but
rumor has it that the new steps are
creating no little comment.
Come to think of it, this is a pitiful
cry: "Wanted, substitute for room on
Lasuen." We suggest a tent in the
center of the Midway.
The trees of Lasuen are down and
ont—they who, with an interest equal
to a hanger-on of roughs' corner,
have watched Stanford generations
come and go. Members of the Stanford
Aviary, past neophytes of Press Club
will now sing that delightful little bal

Success batted .1000 at the inaugu

Hot Direct Leased Wire Reports of
the World's Series, which this noon

howling mob of 500 (more or loss—
probably less) blew around in front
of the office, pushing, squirming,
groaning, grunting, and even swear
ing, to gain a glimpse of the bulletins.
Many of the multitude were up half
the night, (we're not saying where) to
assure themselves of orchestra seats
this morning.
