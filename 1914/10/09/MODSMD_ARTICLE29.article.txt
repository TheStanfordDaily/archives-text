# "DAD" MOULTON BUILDS EXPOSITION TRACK OVAL
## Veteran Stanford Trainer Using Many Innovations for Panama-Pacific Athletic Field. 
### 
"Dad" Moulton, former Stanford
athletic trainer for many years, is
building the athletic field and third-of
a-mile oval cinde.r track of the Pana
ma Pacific International Exposition.
"Dad" is one of the best track build
ers in the country, and he is using
some new ideas and innovations in
track construction, and in laying out
the field for the various national and
international events.
Moulton built the cinder tracks for
Wisconsin and Notre Dame, and had
charge of the athletic track at the
Chicago Exposition, for the Lewis and
Clark Exposition, and the Astoria,
Oregon Centennial.
The entire depth of the track on
the straightaway is nine inches, and
at the turns the banks are twelve
inches. The oval track is twenty feet
wide on the back stretch and thirty
feet wide on the straightaway. Al
though the oval is practically com
pleted, it will not be used until the
exposition games, and this will give it
almost a year to set. The field is well
drained, and after a long soaking with
streams of water the track shows no
signs of mud, and is no softer than
before the water is applied.
The field for the jumps, pole vault,
weights, javelin, and other events is
one of the finest to be found. Saw
dust pits for the broad jump and pole
vaults have been built 33x22 feet.
There is a 160-foot runaway eight feet
wide between the pits, so that trials
may be laid at either end. There are
four pits and two runaways.
The entire field and track is with
in the western half of the mile clay
track for the harness horse events
sons, is directly opposite the cinder
track, and will give a close and clear
view of all the field and track events.
Provision is being made unde.r the
grandstand for dressing rooms and
shower baths for 400 athletes. There
will also be office and lounging rooms.
The track and field are in a wonder
ful location. They face the Golden
Gate and lie unde.r the hills of the
Presidio and Fort Winfield Scott.
