# WAR ZONE TRANSFERRED TO PHILADELPHIA PARK
## Struggle for Pennant Lies Between Veterans and Dashing: Young Blood. 
### Hal Sheridan 
(Written fo.r the United Press.)
The courier sped on wings of flame
As he dashed away to the throne,.
With a message of terror, woe and
shame
That brought from his heart a moan.
He trembled in fear as his tale he
told,
He quaked at the great Zeus' feet,
He fainted away as he managed to
say,
"The War God's off his beat."
"The deuce," said Zeus, as he lamped
the date,
Then called for a paper or two
And nervously thumped and scratched
his pate
As he hurriedly .read them through.
It was then Zeus saw why Mars had
fled,
He ordered his fastest steed,
And taking a tack toward Stallings and
Mack,
He scorched the air with speed.
Philadelphia, Oct. 9.—lf the gods of
war were looking fo.r a real scrap,their
stamping ground was Philadelphia to
day. After blazing their way through
the National league, performing the
unprecedented feat of jumping from
last place to the top, and then nailing
the pennant to their mast, the Boston
Hraves today took up the task of rout
ing the Mackmen.
The series started today presents a
struggle between a seasoned, highly
organized, hard-hitting machine as op
posed to a dashing new outfit, untried
in such a conflict as they entered
today, but full of confidence. Stall
ing's main reliance is in his pitchers
and the dash and confidence of his
men. The great strategist, Mack, pre
sents the same array which has turned
back the Cubs and Giants in defeat.
His batsmen, the terror of their league,
and the wreckers of all who have
faced them in World's series, his in
field, the greatest in the world, a
steady, but not sensational pitching
staff —the mainstays of which accom
plish as much with their brains as
with their arms—are his assets.
Mack is sending his great machine
after the world's title for the fifth
time. Every man is a veterans of at
least one struggle. In the line-up of
the Braves there are but two men who
have ever before smelled the smoke of
the big battle. They are Johnny Evers,
who aided the Cubs in their fights for
the title, and Josh Devore. a former
New York Giant.
Of the Athletic's veterans, Bender
has been under fire in four of the big
league combats; Plank, Collins, Baker,
Strunk, Lai)]), and Barry have been
through three. Oldring, Mclnnes,
Thomas, and Coombs have taken part
in two series, while Schang, Bush and
Eddie Murphy received their baptism
of fire a year ago.
