# FRESHMEN DEVISE PLAN OF EQUALIZING BONFIRE WORK
## 
### 
The freshmen in charge of piling up
the annual "bonfire" have devised a
very efficient method of getting their
classmates to putin a fair share of
work on the structure. Each first year
man will be given a ticket, and will be
credited for the number of hours' work
by punches on the card.
At 8 a. m. tomorrow the first loads
of wood will be carted to the site for
the big pile, north of Encina Gymna
sium. A bonfire rally was held yester
day, and A. E. Worthy, '15, gave the
freshmen an idea of what would be
expected of them.
