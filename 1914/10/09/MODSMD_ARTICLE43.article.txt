# SOCCER TO HAVE PLACE ON SCHOOL CALENDARS
## High School Representatives Will Organize League at Meeting in San Francisco Tomorrow. 
### 
That soccer will find its place in
the high school athletic curriculum is
now practically assured. A meeting
of representatives from several prom
inent preparatory schools has been
arranged for Saturday, October 10th,
at the Olympic Club headquarters in
San Francisco. The purpose of the
meeting is to lie the formation of the
Junior Exposition Soccer League. This
league will be a branch of the newly
formed Exposition Soccer League of
five clubs, of which Trainer Harry
Maloney is president.
Trainer Maloney will attend the
meeting in the capacity of president
of the league, and also as the repre
sentative of Palo Alto High School.
Delegates will be present from Bel
mont, Berkeley, Hitchcock, Fremont,
San Jose, and Palo Alto preparatory
schools, while more of the near-by
high school may join the league at a
later date.
The junior leaguers are assured of
the support and aid of the clubs in the
senior aggregation, and they will re
ceive free instruction by experienced
soccerites drawn from the veteran
ranks of the California and Stanford
soccer elevens. A San Francisco sport
ing goods firm has offered a trophy
to be competed for in the junior league.
The high school soccer season will not
begin until the rugby schedule has
been finished, in order that a suffi
cient number of men can turn out for
the English game. Palo Alto High
School played a short season of soc
cer last year, staging several contests
against the Cardinal players, and rec
ognized the sport as excellent train
ing to supplement the short rugby sea
son.
