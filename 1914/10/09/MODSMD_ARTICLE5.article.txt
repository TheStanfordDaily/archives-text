# Ram's Head Rehearsing For "Routing Razmataz"
## Artistic Creation of Dark-Eyed Mexican Senorita Promised by J.R. Morgan, '16. 
### 
.T. R. Morgan. '16, in the role of
"Ysabel Adagal," a dark-eved Mexican
senorita, in "Routing Razmataz," the
big fun show which Ram's Head will
produce on Friday evening, October
23, promises to excel his greatest ar
tistic success when he appeared as the
"Princess Zuleika," in "Rambling
Rameses" in 1912. Morgan, in several
clever songs and specialties, will dis
play and elaborate abundance of beau-

tiful gowns, which are being created
for this new role.
Among the many song successes to
lie featured in "Routing Razmataz,"
Weston Wilson's "Salvation Army
Glide," as taught to the dark-eyed
senorita by the ambassador, upon the
occasion of their first meeting, prom
ises to he a riotous specialty, and a
saver of gloom-killed souls.
