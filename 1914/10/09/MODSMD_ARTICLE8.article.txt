# SUBURBAN HOME SITES MAY GRACE THE FARM
## FIFTY-YEAR LEASES TO BUILDERS CONSIDERED BY TRUSTEES AS PROFITABLE FEATURE. NEW GYM READY IN SIX MONTHS TREASURER NOW DENIES RUMOR THAT WAR WILL STOP WORK ON ATHLETIC BUILDING 
### 
New methods of raising revenue fo,r
the maintenance of the University are
being considered by the administration,
which will make a decided change in
the appearance of the estate surround
ing the caniims, when adopted.
If the plans now contemplated by
(he board of trustees are carried out,
Palo Alto Farm will become the scene
of numerous country homes, and the
center of as beautiful a residence dis
trict as San Mateo or the La Honda
Valley country now are. These plans
consist in dividing the estate into
small tracts, and letting these for long
terms to prospective home-builders.
These tracts will be of one hundred
acres and fifty acres in size, with
smaller sites of ten and twenty acres.
The land will be rented on the same
basis as a number of organizations
and private persons now hold property
on the campus. It. has been leased to
them for a term of fifty years, usu
ally, at an annual rental, and the im
provements have been erected by the
lessees.
The board of trustees has definitely
decided to so rent the land, providing
that a sufficient supply of water can
be obtained.
To meet the needs of a colony or
homes for house use and the upkeep
of the gardens and lawns alone a large
quantity will have to be assured before
any definite action toward leasing the
estate can be undertaken. The mem
bers of the board believe that they are
assured of this supply through an
agreement with the Spring Valley
Water Company, whereby water will
be brought in from Portola Valley.
Definite action has already been taken
to make sure of this source of supply.
In case it does not materialize the
practicability of other means of get
ting water will be investigated,
among them pumping it here, though
it is felt, that the expense of this lat
ter undertaking would make it im
practicable.
This move has been decided on by
the board as the means of obtaining
the most revenue fium the estate, to
be used for the maintenance of the
University. During the past ten years,
when it. has been farmed, no profit
has been derived. To rent, out the
Farm for home sites has been decided
on as the best means of making it; a
paying business proposition.
The other ranch properties of th<-
Fniversity, including the big Durham
and Vina holdings in the Sacramento
valley, will still be farmed. Two
years ago these places were put un
der the control of a special committee
of the board for a period of four years.
Mr. William Mayo Nevvhall, president
of the board of trustees, is the chair
man of this committee. During this
period no money is being taken from
the ranches for the general University
fund, but all the income from them is
turned back again in the form of im
provements. They are now yielding a
profit over the cost of maintenance,
and, as a result, improvements on
them are progressing rapidly.
It has been found impracticable to
maintain the large vineyards on the
Vina ranch, and the vines are all being
removed, and alfalfa substituted as the
chief crop of the place. When alfalfa
begins to yield a good crop cows will
be purchased, and one of the largest
dairies in the state will be maintained
there by the University.
A rumor purporting that work on
the new gymnasium had been indefi
nitely postponed on account of the
war, was absolutely refuted today by
Mr. Vanderlyn Stow, treasurer of the
University. The bonds have been ac
cepted. the contract signed, and the
money necessary for the erection of
the building is available at the present
time. Direction stakes have already
been set on the men's gymnasium site,
and yesterday afternoon the contractor
and architect visited the ground in
person, making all the preparations
for immediate commencement of op
erations. Tt, is the opinion of Mr. Stow
that the structure will be ready for
occupancy in six months, and every ef
fort will be made to accomplish this
result.
