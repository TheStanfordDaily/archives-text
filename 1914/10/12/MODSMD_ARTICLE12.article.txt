# CARDINAL RUGGERS REGISTER THREE BRILLIANT VICTORIES
## Rooters Treated to Fastest Exhibitions of the English Game Yet Displayed on the Stanford Turf 
### 
The rooters rooted with joyous en
thusiasm, and the Varsity and Second
Varsity both played the best football
that has been seen on Stanford field
this season. Maybe the.ve is something
in this psychological sympathy be
tween the bleachers and the team
after all.
The Cardinal and Olympic players
sat tight on the score until well along
in the second half of their contest.
There has seldom been such a splen
did fight between forwards and backs
as Saturday's game developed. A
shade more improvement in team play
in the later stages enabled Stanford
to walk away with hands 011 the 19
to 5 score.
Late in the first half the Varsity
players took the offensive, but the
Winged "O" backs repeatedly saved.
One of the best worked tactics of
the match resulted in Stanford's first
score. Reeves secured the ball at the
Stanford fifty-yard line, and, after
a dodging run down field, kick and
recovery, he lost the ball. Erb re
covered, and shot to Lachmund for
the try.
Braden made a neat try between
the goal posts after snatching from
the loose and running twenty-five
yards. Austin converted.
Nothing short of an All-Black back
field could have stopped the passing
rush and score achieved by Wines,Gard
and Urban from a twenty-five-yard
lineout. Austin's boot again found the
mark.
Lachmund had no sooner got set
tled at Reeves' wing, where he had
been transferred from second five,
than he saw an opening in the de
fense, and cleaved a way for his sec
ond try, which raised the score to
16-0.

Hawks, the brawny center three
of the Olympics was responsible for
the only successful attack on the
Stanford line. His play was indi
vidual, starting from the loose 011 the
ten-yard mark. Montgomery, full
back, converted, giving the visitors a
full hand of tallies.
Wylie nipped the ball on the three
yard line for the last score of the
game, raising the record to 19-5.
Second Varsity Is Sensation.
The high water mark of the season
for the Second Varsity was surely
reached Saturday. The bleacher fans
have been used to seeing the Blacks
play dashing ball, but this demonstra
tion even exceeded all hopes.
Due credit must" be given Oakland
High for the resistance it offered
which made the game the spectacle
it was.
Up to the present Ave have been
willing to accept a lot of ragged play
if we could only be given a few snap
py passing runs and good footwork
as atonement. This week-end we had
the pretty plays with very little hole
in the game.
Time and again the ball was started
by Walker at half and made the full
run out to one wing or the other, end
ing up in the hands of Wynne at left,
or Mayberry at right. So most of the
scoring was done, and the combina
tion was usually the same, passing
through the bands of Davis and Pat
terson at first and second five, Laine
at center. 16-0 was the windup score
for the first period.
Fow.ler and Krohn, first and sec
ond fives of the Oakland team, made
a clean run to try early in the sec
ond half. A placement later by Black,
breakaway, totaled the six points
which were the lot of the visitors.
The Freshmen whitewashed the rug
gers from San Jose high school in the
morning game by the score of 35 to 0.
The 191S team redeemed itself for past
performances by putting up a con
sistent game of attack.
Three tries and a free kick featured
the first half. Fisher made one con
version and failed two, making the
score read 14 to 0 at half-time. Neun
er, Card and Greve scored for the
Freshmen.
in the second half. Kirksey, Greve,
Earl, Winters, and Ford crossed the
San .lose line for additional tries. Fish

The rooters rooted with joyous en
thusiasm, and the Varsity and Second
Varsity both played the best football
that has been seen on Stanford field
this season. Maybe the.ve is something
in this psychological sympathy be
tween the bleachers and the team
after all.
The Cardinal and Olympic players
sat tight on the score until well along
in the second half of their contest.
There has seldom been such a splen

as Saturday's game developed. A
shade more improvement in team play
in the later stages enabled Stanford
to walk away with hands 011 the 19

Late in the first half the Varsity
players took the offensive, but the
Winged "O" backs repeatedly saved.
One of the best worked tactics of
the match resulted in Stanford's first
score. Reeves secured the ball at the
Stanford fifty-yard line, and, after
a dodging run down field, kick and
recovery, he lost the ball. Erb re
covered, and shot to Lachmund for
the try.
Braden made a neat try between
the goal posts after snatching from
the loose and running twenty-five
yards. Austin converted.
Nothing short of an All-Black back
field could have stopped the passing
rush and score achieved by Wines,Gard
and Urban from a twenty-five-yard
lineout. Austin's boot again found the
mark.
Lachmund had no sooner got set
tled at Reeves' wing, where he had
been transferred from second five,
than he saw an opening in the de
fense, and cleaved a way for his sec
ond try, which raised the score to
16-0.

Hawks, the brawny center three
of the Olympics was responsible for
the only successful attack on the
Stanford line. His play was indi
vidual, starting from the loose 011 the
ten-yard mark. Montgomery, full
back, converted, giving the visitors a
full hand of tallies.
Wylie nipped the ball on the three
yard line for the last score of the
game, raising the record to 19-5.
Second Varsity Is Sensation.

for the Second Varsity was surely
reached Saturday. The bleacher fans

play dashing ball, but this demonstra

Due credit must" be given Oakland
High for the resistance it offered
which made the game the spectacle
it was.
Up to the present Ave have been
willing to accept a lot of ragged play
if we could only be given a few snap
py passing runs and good footwork
as atonement. This week-end we had
the pretty plays with very little hole
in the game.
Time and again the ball was started
by Walker at half and made the full
run out to one wing or the other, end
ing up in the hands of Wynne at left,
or Mayberry at right. So most of the
scoring was done, and the combina
tion was usually the same, passing
through the bands of Davis and Pat
terson at first and second five, Laine
at center. 16-0 was the windup score
for the first period.
Fow.ler and Krohn, first and sec
ond fives of the Oakland team, made
a clean run to try early in the sec

breakaway, totaled the six points

Lachmund had no sooner got set
tled at Reeves' wing, where he had
been transferred from second five,
than he saw an opening in the de
fense, and cleaved a way for his sec
ond try, which raised the score to
16-0.

Hawks, the brawny center three
of the Olympics was responsible for
the only successful attack on the
Stanford line. His play was indi
vidual, starting from the loose 011 the
ten-yard mark. Montgomery, full
back, converted, giving the visitors a
full hand of tallies.
Wylie nipped the ball on the three
yard line for the last score of the
game, raising the record to 19-5.
Second Varsity Is Sensation.
The high water mark of the season
for the Second Varsity was surely
reached Saturday. The bleacher fans
have been used to seeing the Blacks
play dashing ball, but this demonstra
tion even exceeded all hopes.
Due credit must" be given Oakland
High for the resistance it offered
which made the game the spectacle
it was.
Up to the present Ave have been
willing to accept a lot of ragged play
if we could only be given a few snap
py passing runs and good footwork
as atonement. This week-end we had
the pretty plays with very little hole
in the game.
Time and again the ball was started
by Walker at half and made the full
run out to one wing or the other, end
ing up in the hands of Wynne at left,
or Mayberry at right. So most of the
scoring was done, and the combina
tion was usually the same, passing
through the bands of Davis and Pat
terson at first and second five, Laine
at center. 16-0 was the windup score
for the first period.
Fow.ler and Krohn, first and sec
ond fives of the Oakland team, made
a clean run to try early in the sec
ond half. A placement later by Black,
breakaway, totaled the six points
which were the lot of the visitors.
The Freshmen whitewashed the rug
gers from San Jose high school in the
morning game by the score of 35 to 0.
The 191S team redeemed itself for past
performances by putting up a con
sistent game of attack.
Three tries and a free kick featured
the first half. Fisher made one con
version and failed two, making the
score read 14 to 0 at half-time. Neun
er, Card and Greve scored for the
Freshmen.
in the second half. Kirksey, Greve,
Earl, Winters, and Ford crossed the
San .lose line for additional tries. Fish
er converted three out of five at
tempts. Greve, Card, and Winters star
red for the 1918 team.

The rooters rooted with joyous en
thusiasm, and the Varsity and Second
Varsity both played the best football
that has been seen on Stanford field
this season. Maybe the.ve is something
in this psychological sympathy be
tween the bleachers and the team
after all.
The Cardinal and Olympic players
sat tight on the score until well along
in the second half of their contest.
There has seldom been such a splen
did fight between forwards and backs
as Saturday's game developed. A
shade more improvement in team play
in the later stages enabled Stanford
to walk away with hands 011 the 19
to 5 score.
Late in the first half the Varsity
players took the offensive, but the
Winged "O" backs repeatedly saved.
One of the best worked tactics of
the match resulted in Stanford's first
score. Reeves secured the ball at the
Stanford fifty-yard line, and, after
a dodging run down field, kick and
recovery, he lost the ball. Erb re
covered, and shot to Lachmund for
the try.
Braden made a neat try between
the goal posts after snatching from
the loose and running twenty-five
yards. Austin converted.
Nothing short of an All-Black back
field could have stopped the passing
rush and score achieved by Wines,Gard
and Urban from a twenty-five-yard
lineout. Austin's boot again found the
mark.
Lachmund had no sooner got set
