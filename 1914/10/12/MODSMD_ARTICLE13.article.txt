# Wily Mackmen Again Take Count at Hands of Braves
## 
### 
Led by Hank Gowdy, the tall catch
er of the Braves, the Bostonians today
,-tiiged the most thrilling comeback ev
er recorded in World's Series history,
tying the score in the tenth when the
tally was 4-2 in their opponent's favor,
and winding up the game with a whirl
wind finish in the twelfth frame, win
ning the the third contest from the
Philadelphia Athletics, .">-4.
Joe Hush, who pitched the entire
game for the American leaguers, was
outclassed by the veteran Tyler, but it
is doubtful if any one of Connie Mack's
staff could have withstood the terrific
onslaught of the Boston batters.
Gowdy, Evans, and Maranville head
ed the list of Stalling's stickmcn. Out
of five times at bat, the lanky catcher
egistered a home run and two doubles,
and was well seconded by the veteran
Evers, who picked three singles off
Bush.
Tyler's work in the box was not of
stellar quality, but be succeeded in
keeping the Athletics' hits well scat
tered, and held on doggedly in the
tenth inning, when all looked very
hazy for his teammates. Tyler and
Bush each fanned four of the enemy,
but the hundred-thousand-dollar in
field failed to give Connie Mack his
money's worth.

Led by Hank Gowdy, the tall catch
er of the Braves, the Bostonians today
,-tiiged the most thrilling comeback ev
er recorded in World's Series history,
tying the score in the tenth when the
tally was 4-2 in their opponent's favor,
and winding up the game with a whirl
wind finish in the twelfth frame, win
ning the the third contest from the
Philadelphia Athletics, .">-4.
Joe Hush, who pitched the entire
game for the American leaguers, was
outclassed by the veteran Tyler, but it
is doubtful if any one of Connie Mack's
staff could have withstood the terrific
onslaught of the Boston batters.
Gowdy, Evans, and Maranville head
ed the list of Stalling's stickmcn. Out
of five times at bat, the lanky catcher
egistered a home run and two doubles,
and was well seconded by the veteran
Evers, who picked three singles off
Bush.
Tyler's work in the box was not of
stellar quality, but be succeeded in
keeping the Athletics' hits well scat
tered, and held on doggedly in the
tenth inning, when all looked very
hazy for his teammates. Tyler and
Bush each fanned four of the enemy,
but the hundred-thousand-dollar in
field failed to give Connie Mack his
money's worth.

Led by Hank Gowdy, the tall catch
er of the Braves, the Bostonians today
,-tiiged the most thrilling comeback ev
er recorded in World's Series history,
tying the score in the tenth when the
tally was 4-2 in their opponent's favor,
and winding up the game with a whirl
wind finish in the twelfth frame, win
ning the the third contest from the
Philadelphia Athletics, .">-4.
Joe Hush, who pitched the entire
game for the American leaguers, was
outclassed by the veteran Tyler, but it
is doubtful if any one of Connie Mack's
staff could have withstood the terrific
onslaught of the Boston batters.
Gowdy, Evans, and Maranville head
ed the list of Stalling's stickmcn. Out
of five times at bat, the lanky catcher
egistered a home run and two doubles,
and was well seconded by the veteran
Evers, who picked three singles off
Bush.
Tyler's work in the box was not of
stellar quality, but be succeeded in
keeping the Athletics' hits well scat
tered, and held on doggedly in the
tenth inning, when all looked very
hazy for his teammates. Tyler and
Bush each fanned four of the enemy,
but the hundred-thousand-dollar in
field failed to give Connie Mack his
money's worth.

Led by Hank Gowdy, the tall catch
er of the Braves, the Bostonians today
,-tiiged the most thrilling comeback ev
er recorded in World's Series history,
tying the score in the tenth when the
tally was 4-2 in their opponent's favor,
and winding up the game with a whirl
wind finish in the twelfth frame, win
ning the the third contest from the
Philadelphia Athletics, .">-4.
Joe Hush, who pitched the entire
game for the American leaguers, was
outclassed by the veteran Tyler, but it
is doubtful if any one of Connie Mack's
staff could have withstood the terrific
onslaught of the Boston batters.
Gowdy, Evans, and Maranville head
ed the list of Stalling's stickmcn. Out
of five times at bat, the lanky catcher
egistered a home run and two doubles,
and was well seconded by the veteran
Evers, who picked three singles off
Bush.
Tyler's work in the box was not of
stellar quality, but be succeeded in
keeping the Athletics' hits well scat
tered, and held on doggedly in the
tenth inning, when all looked very
hazy for his teammates. Tyler and
Bush each fanned four of the enemy,
but the hundred-thousand-dollar in
field failed to give Connie Mack his
money's worth.

Led by Hank Gowdy, the tall catch
er of the Braves, the Bostonians today
,-tiiged the most thrilling comeback ev
er recorded in World's Series history,
tying the score in the tenth when the
tally was 4-2 in their opponent's favor,
and winding up the game with a whirl
wind finish in the twelfth frame, win
ning the the third contest from the
Philadelphia Athletics, .">-4.
Joe Hush, who pitched the entire
game for the American leaguers, was
outclassed by the veteran Tyler, but it
is doubtful if any one of Connie Mack's
staff could have withstood the terrific
onslaught of the Boston batters.
Gowdy, Evans, and Maranville head
ed the list of Stalling's stickmcn. Out
of five times at bat, the lanky catcher
egistered a home run and two doubles,
and was well seconded by the veteran
Evers, who picked three singles off
Bush.
Tyler's work in the box was not of
stellar quality, but be succeeded in
keeping the Athletics' hits well scat
tered, and held on doggedly in the
tenth inning, when all looked very
hazy for his teammates. Tyler and
Bush each fanned four of the enemy,
but the hundred-thousand-dollar in
field failed to give Connie Mack his
money's worth.
