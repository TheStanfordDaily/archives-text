United Press Telegraphic Report
Paris, Oct. 12. —A renewal of the
German attack on the allies' center is
considered imminent, after a week's
lull, which was a natural accompani
ment of need for concerted action be
fore Antwerp, rtigid censorship cur
tails publication of French plans. Re
ports are rife concerning a heavy
British reinforcement at Ostend. The
French, British, and Belgians are
massing for an assault on tbe extreme
northwestern wing of the German
army.
Hi»<tie in Center Renewed.
Paris, Oct. 12.—Strategists believe
that the Germans are about to resume
the offensive on their three-hundred
mile front. This move is probably
undertaken to keep the allies so busy
that they will be unable to send rein
forcements to the west to encircle the
German lines near Lille. The French
and British long ago anticipated the
fall of Antwerp, and began concen
trating at Ostend. It is understood
that the new British troops, including
the Canadians, are at Ostend. Paris
is opt'mistic, the morale of the
troops is good, and the weathe.r is bet
ter.
Phe-Hundrcd-Milc Battle Line.
London, Oct. 11. —Germany's new
activity in the west has gradually
lengthened the battle line. Antwerp
Is considered the northwest starting
point of the line now extending in a
zigzag 512 miles to Saint Die, in Al
sace. The lines extend from Antwerp,
sixty miles southwest, to Courtrai, in
Belgium, near the border of France,
thence forty miles west to Haze
brouck, in France, thence thirty-five
miles south to Arras, twenty
miles in an easterly direction to Cam
brai, thirty-five miles south to Las
signy, ten miles west of the Oise,
thence fifty miles southeast to
Rheims, fifty-five miles east to Ver
dun, and finally one hundred miles
southeast to Saint Die, in Alsace.
Przemysl Too Strong for Russians.
Berlin, Oct. 12.—Vienna reports that
in the face of heavy opposition the
Russians have abandoned their at
tempt to take Przemysl, the great Aus
trian stronghold in the center of Ga
licia. The Austrians claim to have de
feated six Russian divisions near Lan
eut. and to have routed one Cossack
division east of Nymae.
French Sen Front Assailed.
Paris. Oct. 12.- —The Commique, in
a report issued early this morning,
stated that the German western line
since Saturday afternoon has been en
gaged in an attempted advance along
the French coast off the Straits of
Dover. The allied army officials are

along the line of Teuton offense to re
sist any such attach. Vigorous cav
