# A 						Reversion To Type
## 
### 
The quake comes, the substitute falls
from its pedestal, and the plans of the
Plug Ugly revival committee are worth
no more than the scrap of paper. To
day the resolutions of the Senior and
Junior classes protesting against the
adoption of the 'poster rush,' and urg
ing the retention of the old Plug Ugly
were filed with the secretary of the
University Conference.
The fate of the proposed substitute
for the Plug Ugly is sealed, for to ac
cept the plan again*t the expressed
disapproval of the two classes in
volved would be worse than useless.
The question for decision is—would
the worth of the rejuvenated Plug jus
tify its place on the month's calen
dar, two nights marked "guerrilla-war
fare" and "organized attack?"
The time for decision is short, no
eleventh-hour changes of plans would
seem practicable; the Conference must
decide for or against reversion to the
old type.
But in this consideration one factor
must be considered eliminated, the
staging of the farce. It is agreed that
there is no room in the year's program
for anything of low degree—the farce
for years lias been worse than that.
And there seems no possibility of rais
ing the standard, for the presentation
of farcical burlesque requires dramatic
talent, and in such a performance
there is little incentive for its appear
ance. The Plug Ugly then would in
clude the decoration of the country
side with posters questioning the
worth of members of the Senior class,
and the plug battering fest of the fol
lowing evening, staged in the corridors
of the Quad.
A far cry from this situation to the
original ideals and purposes of the
Plug Ugly founders—"to arouse class
enthusiasm and to revive the custom
of wearing Junior Plugs!" Yet the
plan is strong enough to link the best
of the past to the possibilities of the
future. There is a vast field open to
the molder of traditions.
As a stop for the threatened break in
years of upperclass conflict, the two
features of the old Plug Ugly for
which the classes petition, should be
adopted for the delectation of the cor
duroyed combatants. The future should
hold promise of better.
