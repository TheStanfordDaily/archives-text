# OAKLAND PASTOR PREACHES ON MAN'S INNER SELF
## 
### 
Rev. Albert W. Palmer, pastor of
the Plymouth Congregational Church,
of Oakland, preached at the eleven
o'clock service at Memorial Church.
Choosing for his text "Seek Ye Those
Things Which Are Above," Rev. Pal
mer said: "According to President
Bateman, of the British Association of
Science, the newer idea of evolution
is not so much the addition of capaci
ties from without as the release o 1
latent capacities. Within every man
and woman is a 'better self' of won
derful latent possibilities. To find the
secret of releasing these would trans
form character and make for health
and efficiency.
'"It is impossible to prescribe any
certain mechanical routine by which
this may be brought out.
"The one way that is absolutely in
dispensible to bring out the latent ca
pabilities is the giving of one's self
unselfishly."
