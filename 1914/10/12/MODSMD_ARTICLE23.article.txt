# Great Significance of Discovery Day Urged
## 
### 
Columbus Day is, to the popular
mind, usually relegated to a compar
atively unimportant place among ou.r j
holidays, but the following article from ]
a recent number of the Bulletin of the |
Pan-American Union, puts the observ- j
ance of Columbus Day in a new light. 1
The author seeks to remind us that
Columbus Day is an international, |
rather than a national holiday, the i
celebration of an epoch-making event
in world history, rather than an inci
dent in the annals of our country.
The article reads in part:
"The celebration of October 12th as
Columbus Day is becoming a move
ment of importance. There are in- j
creasing hopes that the goal of a Pan- j
American day—an international fes
tival in which the entire Western Hem- ,
isphere will join.
Discovery Day, the anniversary of:
October 12, 1492, it has been called.!
and it. would be difficult to select a ;
more appropriate name. No one part |
of America is more interested than j
any other. None of the great divisions
—North, Central, or South America — '
has a larger interest than any of the j
others, although the West Indies would
naturally have the more alluring field ]
for local celebrations.
When Columbus Day, Discovery Day, j
is set aside as a legal holiday from i
one end of America to the other—and |
all the nations should recognize the
merit of celebrating this way one of
the greatest events in history—it will
add still another factor of sentiment
to our growing internationalism."
