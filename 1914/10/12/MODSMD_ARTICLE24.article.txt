Bill Shakespeare didn't say: All's
swell that spends well.
Four hundred and twenty-two years
ago today Chris Columbo started the
ball rolling, and crossed the line. The
Pilgrims converted.
Without a doubt, Saturday was a
siood old-fashioned Sabbath —a fight
in the rooters' section, a yelling solo,
a co-ed's sc.ream when hit in the
bleachers, and a football star queen
ing. And Sim pie Simon was heard to
ask, "Which one's the drum?"
Frankly speaking, Duck Swing, the
Chinese phenom from Oakland wasn't
so awful* And the almost All-Blacks
were there like a duck. Which re
minds us that:
The rare combination of an east
wind and a hot sun brought about the
discovery recently that Waldo, the
sorority ducklet, is no more. He caught
the football fever and passed out.

A Spring Song Already.
A story, scout, T fain would tell,
But donot da.re, I fear,
For it's about a diving board,
And I cannot spring it here.
—The Tllini.
Mellow Dniyiiin.
A joke, old boy, I'd like to tell,
You know that I know how,
But it's about some new made cheese,
And isn't ripe for now.
—On the Quiet.
Punk Pun.
"Have you a 10:15?"
"Nope; nothing smaller than a twen
ty."
