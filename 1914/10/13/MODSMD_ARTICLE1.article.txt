## BRAVES DOWN ATHLETICS IN FOURTH STRAIGHT GAME Connie Mack's All-Stars Glean Seven Hits Off Rudolph. American Leaguers Make Lone Run in Fifth Inning 
### 
United Press Telegraphic Report
Fenway Park, Boston, October 13—
—Three to one! Collins, Maker, and
Mclnnis faced Rudolph in the ninth
inning—the Athletics' last chance to
spoil Boston's four straight record —
and one by one they were baffled by
the veteran pitcher's collection of
curves. With the last grounder
knocked by Mclnnis into Schmidt's
hands, the Braves had done in four
games what the Giants could not do
in seven—they had conquered Connie
Mack's all-star aggregation, and hum
bled his pitchers, Bender, Wyckoff,
Plank, Bush, Shawkey, and Pennock,
one by one.
Rudolph's steady twirling did much
to produce the final result today. The
Athletics gleaned seven hits off his
delivery, one more than the Braves
tallied, but the veteran worked well
in the pinches and was ably backed
up by a cool-headed infield. Schmidt
ai. first, Field Captain Evers at sec
ond, and Maranville at shortstop and
Deal at third.
The fifth inning spelled defeat for
the American leaguers. With two out,
Rudolph singled, Moran doubled, and
Evers singled, bringing in the two
runs that won the game, and the
series.
The Athletics' lone run came in the
fifth inning, when Barry reached home
on Shawkey's double. Besides these
two, Baker, Mclnnis, Collins, Walsh,
and Oldring found Rudolph for safe
ties, but the Athletics could not bunch
their hits.
Rudolph is credited with two of the
victories, and his team-mate, James,
with the other two. Tyler left yester
day's game with the score tied, and
it was left for the veteran James to
pull his team through the hole, and
establish a basis for today's success.
Ty Cobb predicted the final outcome
this morn'.ng, explaining that in the
first two games the Braves took the
Americans by surprise, and in the last
outplayed, out-pitched, and out-classed
the Athletics.
