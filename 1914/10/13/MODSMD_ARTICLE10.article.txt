# BOERS BEGIN REBELLION
## NATIONS GATHER HOSTS ON BELGIAN BORDER Germans Weaken Left and Center to Reinforce the Turning Movement on Extreme Right. Fall of Antwerp Unimportant 
### 
London, Oct. 13. —The war office
states that there has been a certain
amount of dissatisfaction in South Af
rica ever since the resignation of Com
mandant General Beyers, whom the
South African government had finally
chosen to supersede Colonel Maritz
in the command of Northwest Cape
P.rovince. Maritz is defiant and has
sent an ultimatum to the Capetown au
thorities that he will invade the union
unless he is permitted to consult with
Generals Beyers, Dewet, and Hertzog.
Maritz has arrested all loyal troops
in his command, and has made them
prisoners in German Southwest Afri
ca. He now heads not only his own
rebels, but also a German force, armed
with German guns. The war office says
that the German government of South
west Africa agreed not only to sup
port Maritz, but to guarantee the inde
pendence of the new republic and to
cede it Walfish Bay, and other Ger
man ports.
Disaffection Among Boer Leaders.
London, Oct. 13.—Officials do not at
tempt to disguise the gravity of the
Boer situation. The disaffection dates
to the time when the Boers resigned
rather than fight the Germans. General
Maritz, commandant of one of the thir
teen military districts of the O.range
river, has also joined the movement.
Battle Centers in Itelgiuin.
London, Oct. 13.—The allies have
heavily reinforced the northwest wing
of their line of battle to oppose Ger
man encirclement, and are preparing
for a general engagement on the banks
of the Lys, in Belgium. There is no
doubt that the Germans now occupy
Ghent, although the war department
does not confirm the rumors to that
effect. There is no news from the
front, but it is believed that Belgium is
the center of activity.
