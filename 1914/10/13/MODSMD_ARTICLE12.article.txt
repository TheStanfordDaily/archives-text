A great, white-tiled plunge of cool,
clear, filtered water, out in the air yet
protected from the vagaries of weath
er, easily accessible to all the men of
the University, and managed for their
exclusive benefit —that is the alluring
picture that may become a .reality if
the students interested in amphibious
sports succeed in grasping the oppor
tunity afforded by the building of the
new gymnasium. After years of wait
ing, that through successive disap
pointments lost its watchful quality,
the students have been swept at last
to a vantage ground nearer their goal
than a campaign of months would car
ry them.
In apportioning one hundred thou
sand dollars for a new gymnasium
the Board of Trustees wisely made
provision for possible additions to the
original plan, and on one side of the
structure there is space for handball
courts and outdoor swimming pool.
For the showers of the gymnasium,
a filtration plant will render in
nocuous the waters of Searsville, and
as the supply is unlimited the im
portant question of water supply
seems solved.
There remains only the final con
sideration. the cost of materials and
installation. And in this respect, the
project does not seem beyond the
range of campus enterprise.
According to the estimates of resi
dent engineers, a tank measuring
thirty by one hundred feet might be
constructed and equipped for approx
imately twenty-five hundred dollars.
This would be the initial expense
only, but as in the case of othe.r ath
letic equipment the cost of mainte
nance would be borne by the Univer
sity, while the right of control would
rest with the students. Such an en
terprise would seem feasible, and if
there is a demand for facilities for
water sports, there is no reason for
delay in furtherance of the plan.
