A new partition is being constructed
in the English Department to provide
a corridor from the side entrance to
the door opening onto the outer Quad
rangle. The change will do away with
the practice of using the office en
trance and room 20"> for passage ways
to and from classes. The new di
vision of the space will provide an ad
ditional office for the English Depart
ment, as well as a small class room in
the place of 205. The work is rapidly
nearing completion, and the new rooms
will soon be in use.
