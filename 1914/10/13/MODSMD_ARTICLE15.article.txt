While our bards are dedicating their
songs to Mars, the following verses
from the versatile pen of Arthur Guit
erman strike a new note in the univer
sal chorus of poets glorifying and de
ploring war. Guiterman is a magazine
writer of decided popularity, well
known as the contributor of the wide
ly-read Rhymed Reviews in "Life."
She goes amid the maddened press
Of Teuton, Briton, Slav, and Gaul
Our Nation's White Ambassadress,
The foe of none, the friend of all.
Above the guns, above the cheers
For Flag or Kaiser, Folk or King,
The common cry alone she hears —
The cry of human suffering.
Still men will play the devil's game
Though all must lose, and none may
win,
And still a foolish world's acclaim
Exalts the sworded paladin.
But tears will fall and lips will pray
And hearts beat warm in every land
For her who serves while heroes slay,
Oh, valiant soul; oh, gentle hand.
