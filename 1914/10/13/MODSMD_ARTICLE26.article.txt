### 
London, Oct. 13. —It is the general
opinion here that the Kaiser will not
attempt to use Antwerp as a naval
base. This would violate the neutrali
ty of Holland, as shipping must follow
the river Scheldt through Dutch terri
tory to reach the Belgian port. Naval
experts hold that if Germany attempts
to concentrate a navy at Antwerp it
will aid the allies, by forcing the Ger
man cruisers and battleships to leave
their shelter at Wilhelmshaven, and
give battle near Heligoland to the
British and French fleets, which far
outnumber the Kaiser's sea warriors.
It is asserted that if the German war
ships do reach Antwerp, it will be an
easy matter for the allies to blockade
the mouth of the Scheldt.
