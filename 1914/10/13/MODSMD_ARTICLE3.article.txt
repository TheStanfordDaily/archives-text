# Juniors and Seniors Offer Revised Plug-Ugly Plans
## Objectionable Features of Former Upperclass Struggles Eliminated in New Arrangement. 
### 
The Plug Ugly question will be
definitely settled at the regular meet
ing of the University Conference this
evening. Although the Plug Ugly was
abolished last spring, with the under
standing that a suitable substitute
would be provided in its place, the
present junior and senior classes ex
pect to have the Plug Ugly and its
time-honored traditions reinstated,
with modifications.
With this in view, committees from
the two classes met jointly yesterday
afternoon and drew up a petition,
which will be presented to the Con
ference tonight. The petition calls for
a Plug Pgly with new limitations, and
without the usual Plug Ugly show.
The petition follows:
To the Student Conference of Asso
ciated Students of Leland Stanford,
Junior, University:
During the spring semester of this
year the Student Conference abolished
the Plug Ugly, as we understand, on
account, of certain objectionable fea
tures. The Plug Ugly has always oc
cupied a prominent part in the student
life of the University as a means of
promoting upperclass rivalry. We be
lieve that this spirit should be encour
aged by all reasonable means, and
further believe that a Plug Ugly with
the objectionable elements eliminated
would serve as the best method of fos
tering class rivalry.
The features of former Plug Uglies
most objected to were the use of ob
jectionable language in show and post
er, and the unrestrained rowdyism,
due to use of liquors.
To eliminate these we propose the
following plan:
That there shall be a Plug Ugly,
with the following limitations:
Poster —Senior and junior completed
posters to be submitted to a commit
tee of censorship, appointed by the
Conference,
Rush—To be conducted as in pre
vious Plug Uglies.
Shows—To be eliminated,
ff the Conference sees fit to ap
prove the aforegoing plan, we, the
classes of 1915 and will, and do
hereby pledge ourselves to use all
reasonable means to prevent any un
desirable conduct during the Plug
Ugly, such as:
I—lndulgence in liquors.
2—Obscene language.
—Any acts of rowdyism.
We hereby petition you that the
Plug Ugly be re-established on this
modified basis.
Respectfully submitted,
