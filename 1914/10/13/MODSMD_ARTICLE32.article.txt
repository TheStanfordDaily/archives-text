G. Reed, instructor of chemistry,
states that stormy weather in Novem
ber usually comes at the first and last
part of the month, and that since the
normal number of rainy days in that
month are only seven, there is great
probability of the 14th being a clear,
sunshiny day.

Walter Ives Christie, 2nd, made his

yet decided whether he will make him
a 220 record-breaker or a 16-pound

St. Mary's Varsity held the Califor

Varsity and Freshmen crews en
gaged in active competition at the Co
