# ANTI-GERMAN SYMPATHY OF AMERICA IS DECRIED
## PROFESSOR HILMER DISPARAGES IRON FIST THEORY. Loyal Son of Fatherland Declares Present War Was Sought by Revengeful France. 
### 
The views of a native German in re
gard to the European war, from the
events that led up to the first hostili
ties down to the present day, were ex
pressed today by Assisstant Professor
Herman J. Hilme.r, of the German De
partment.
Professor Hilman was born and
raised in the Fatherland, and his views
are those of one familiar with past ann
present conditions in Europe. In addi
tion, he has made a thorough study of
all events of the war, both from the
American press reports and from the
European point of view. Professor Hil
mer spent the past semester in p]u
rope, where he made observations that
now enable him to grasp comprehen
sively the significance of all move
ments made by the hostile nations.
Hilmer has been impressed with the
antagonistic partiality of the American
press, and their views regarding Ger
man's attitude toward war and peace.
He said: "It is false to say that Ger
many wants war. She does not want
war, and cannot afford it. I believe
that the Germans, from the Emperor
down to the people the Social Dem
ocrats, do not want war. It is an ab
surdity to maintain that Germany is
anxious to conquer new territory.
Such a desire would be in vain, for
there is no territory in Europe open
for the conquerer. As for Switzerland,
Germany doesn't want it, or need it.
"The war was brought about, first,
by the desire of France for revenge.
Certain Alsatians have raised the cry
for France to retake Alsace-Lorraine.
To show the sentiment of these people
it is only necessary to note that 90,000
German volunteers were recruited
from this region.
"A second cause was the desire of
Russia to reach Constantinople. This
may sound strange, but it is a fact,
that through the medium of Austria-
Hunga.ry, Germany has stood in Rus
sia's way. I believe Austria's ulti
matum to Servia to have been the most
brutal in history. But it was of ne
cessity.
"A third cause was England's jeal
ousy of German's commerce and navy.
England wants to control the seas.
When England demanded that, the
Kaiser recognize Belgium neutrality,
Germany asked if England would guar
antee French recognition of neutrality.
Great Britain did not reply to this.
"The nations have been preparing
for considerable time. Russia was
ready in 1907. Her peace army con
sisted of 1,500,000 men. France's
peace army called upon one and one
half per cent of her population. Ger
many's standing amy was but 700,000
strong.
"When we speak of German militar
ism, we mean discipline, which is the
basis for German efficiency in every
field and phase of life. The Germans
are more democratic than we usually
believe. I believe it is the pressure
of the surroundings that has kept the
country under one-man rule.
"My view is that the Germans never
intended to capture Paris. The in
vading army was no larger than that
of the defenders. The Kaiser wanted
to deliver a crushing blow. The Ger
mans have never been defeated any
where. I think that what the press
called a ret.reat was but a retirement
to previously selected positions. The
siege of Liege was a delay used to cov
er Germany's movements in prepara
tion of the march into France.
"A new army is now being organ
ized. The Germans will resist to the
utmost. The one thought of the peo
ple is that Germany and German cul
ture must not go down. It is not a
question of numbers, but of equipment
and training. I do not know how long
war will last. Unless new allies join
the opposing forces. Germany will be
victorious.

The views of a native German in re
gard to the European war, from the
events that led up to the first hostili
ties down to the present day, were ex
pressed today by Assisstant Professor
Herman J. Hilme.r, of the German De
partment.
Professor Hilman was born and
raised in the Fatherland, and his views
are those of one familiar with past ann
present conditions in Europe. In addi
tion, he has made a thorough study of
all events of the war, both from the
American press reports and from the
European point of view. Professor Hil
mer spent the past semester in p]u
rope, where he made observations that
now enable him to grasp comprehen
sively the significance of all move
ments made by the hostile nations.
Hilmer has been impressed with the
antagonistic partiality of the American
press, and their views regarding Ger
man's attitude toward war and peace.
He said: "It is false to say that Ger
many wants war. She does not want
war, and cannot afford it. I believe
that the Germans, from the Emperor
down to the people the Social Dem
ocrats, do not want war. It is an ab
surdity to maintain that Germany is
