# Nestoria Shortens Program.
## 
### 
Due to the conflicting meeting of
the University Conference, Nestoria
Debating Society will not hold the pro
gram scheduled for this evening. In
stead of a set debate, there will be an
extemporaneous discussion on the
short ballot system.
The meeting will be held as usual in
room 228, at 7:30.
