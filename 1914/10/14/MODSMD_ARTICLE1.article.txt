# CONFERENCE APPROVES MODIFIED PLUG-UGLY
## OBJECTIONABLE FEATURES ARE, REMOVED FROM HISTORIC UPPERCLASS RUSH. NEW HONOR SYSTEM ENDORSED FACULTY CHAPERONES MUST BE PRESENT AT FUTURE OFF-CAMPUS DANCES. 
### 
The Plug Ugly rush in its original
form was reinstated last night by the
University Conference, and as a re
sult the Quad will again be the scene
of class struggle so prominent in the
calendar of Stanford events.
Following the petition presented
yesterday afternoon by representa
tives of the senior and junior classes,
provisions were made to .re-establish
the Plug Ugly as outlined in that pe
tition. The main features of the new
rules are that the rush will be con
ducted as in the past, the show will be
eliminated and the completed poster
in its final form ready to be put down
will be presented to the Student Coun
cil for censorship.
Besides these changes, which will
eliminate the objectionable features of
past struggles, the members of the two
classes interested this year have
pledged themselves to do their best to
prevent any disorderly conduct on the
night of the rush or during the plac
ing of posters.
A committee was appointed to con
fer with representatives of the two up
per classes to draw up specific rules
for governing this year's rush. The
committee follows: R. G. Adams, 14;
A. E. Worthy,'ls, and F. N. Worth, '16.
The matter of adopting the honor
system in the University came up be
fore the Conference last night for
further consideration. The general
belief was that there is not sufficient
unanimity of opinion to warrant a rec
ommendation to the facility that the
system should he universally adopted
in all departments. A motion was
passed, however, to request the in
structors to install the personal honor
system in particular classes where
they think it is feasible at the pres
ent time. This will probably apply
particularly to the professional courses
and to the higher classes in other de
partments.
The personal honor system is that
in which each man in the class is
put on his honor alone not to get out
side help during an examination. It
does not carry with it the requirement
of reporting dishonesty to the faculty,
when seen. A better name for it is
probably the personal honor principle
.rather than the honor system.
In case continued dishonesty is
noted it is expected that the members
of the class will deal with it rather
than the faculty. This is the principle
which prevailed in the Law Department
of the University ever since its foun
dation.
The University Conference passed a
motion last evening in support of that
already taken by the Woman's Con
ference, requiring the presence of the
faculty chaperones at all off-campus
dances given by University organiza
tions. The action is meant to apply
particularly to all campus dances giv
en in Palo Alto.
The minutes follow:
O. H. Castle presiding.
Moved and carried that the Plug
Ugly, with modified form, as suggest
ed by the two upper classes, be

Moved and carried that the Confer
ence recommend to the Faculty that
they adopt the personal honor system
in such classes as each professor
