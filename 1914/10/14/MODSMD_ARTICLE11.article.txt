# WILCOX URGES PROMPTNESS IN BIG GAME SEAT ORDERS
## Only Two More Days Remain in Which to File Reserve Applications. 
### 
Applications for Big Game tickets
by Student Body members are coming
in very slowly, according to a state
ment made by Graduate Manager Wil
cox today. Students are evidently with
holding their orders until the last min
ute, and these tardy individuals will
very likely be disappointed on Friday,
which is the last day exclusively re
served for student order.
The time each day that applications
will be accepted is definitely limited,
and the window at the Bookstore will
be closed at the precise time set, re
gardless of the number of applicants
in line.
But two mo.re days remain in which
to file these orders, and the graduate
manager earnestly requests that as
many students as possibly can enter
their applications tomorrow, in order
to avoid a rush at the last day.
After Friday, the applicants will re
ceive preference in the order of .re
quests registered.
