United Press Telegraphic Report
Paris, Oct. 14. —It is not denied here
that von Boehm is menacing the
French left. Germany could not select
a better field in Europe fo.r an attempt
to bottle up the allies. The Belgians
narrowly escaped isolation in their re
treat from Antwerp. The Germans,
who were released from the assault of
Antwerp, are now advancing south and
west toward the coast. The north
western column of the German army
detached from von Boehm's forces, is
also marching toward the Channel. It
is swinging northwesterly into posi
tion in an arc. The country along the
Channel is flat and unsuited to de
fense against assault. On the north
lies Holland, a neutral country, and
on the west the Channel. The extreme
left wing of the allies backs up to the
Channel, and might very easily be cut
off from the balance of the allied
army by a powerful column of Teu
tons breaking through near Lille or
Arras. The logical move fo,r the
French, British, and Belgians to do
now is to order a retreat southward
until they reach a battlefied more ad
vantageous to themselves.
Titanic Battle Along Aisne Impending.
Dunkirk, Oct. 14.—With the contin
uance of the Teuton advance along the
Aisne front and through the newly
acquired territory of Belgium, all in
dications point to the near approach
of an inevitable titanic conflict. Skirm
ishes between the allied and German
forces, chiefly carried on by troops on
bicycles and cavalry brigades, are now
being encountered for scores of miles
along almost the entire battle front.
The allied troops are being massed
with the utmost haste along the prob
able line of Teuton attack. Casualties
within the next few days of fighting
are expected to total to an enormous
figure. The country upon which the
impending conflict is certain to occu.r,
is of a flat, low and uncovered nature.
The French and British soldiers are
already situated in entrenchments,
which have been thrown up over i
score of miles in length during the
past few hours. Censorship forbids
the transmission of the exact location
of the allied battle ground.

London. Oct. 14. —A statement has
reached he,re to the effect that the
great majority of the South African
Boers have pledged opposition to the
rebel leader Maritz. The English au
thorities at Cape Town are unable to
estimate the strength of Maritz's
forces, but. believe that without doubv
they are banded together in for
midable numbers. To what extent the
revolutionists have received aid from
the Germans is unknown. The prov
inces of Meyers, Dewet. and Hartzog are
thought to be unaffected by the upris
ing.
