# Action on the Field

The swift rush and the sharp shock
of a legion of mad-hatters against the
walls of Senior resistance will again
sweep the corridors of the Quad, the
indefinable thrill of night conflict will
gather the wearers of plug and som
brero from the four corners of the
campus. The tamed and toned Plug
Ugly is a reality, there is to be no
break in the years of upperclass hat
swingingand head-breaking revels. And
there are no restrictions imposed, no
strings tied to the dangerous plaything
that is to bring joy for a day to the
warrior lovers of pristine combat. No
restraint —except the word of the
classes, given through their represen
tatives, that the objectionable ele
ments of past Plug Uglies would be
eliminated.
But with the granting of the petition
addressed to the University Confer
ence, the two classes shoulder a re
sponsibility that cannot be regarded
lightly. "We, the classes of 1915 and
1916, do hereby pledge ourselves to use
all reasonable meavis to prevent any
undesirable conduct during the Plug
Ugly." "Unrestrained rowdyism, due
to the use of liquors"—there's the rub
and the task is for the individual.
Guarantees of good conduct and sol
emn treaties are not respected today
as they were in other years, the judg
ment of neutrals is determined by ac
tion under stress of circumstances and
by behavior on the field.
The plans of the class committees to
be appointed, must pass the censorship
of neutral parties, the discipline of
their commands must leave no loop
hole for future criticism—a breach of
conduct will mean disarmament before
the next struggle.
