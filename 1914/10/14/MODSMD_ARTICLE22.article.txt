# When Love Thee Most
## 
### 
Alice Mary Richardson, '05, is the
author of this sonnet, which appeared
in the Sequoia in May, 1905. After leav
ing college Miss Richards taught in
the Salem High School, and later in
the History Department of the Castil
leja school, in Palo Alto:
When love thee most, oh, little world of
mine?
At noon-tide, when the darting swal
lows fly,
When red roofs stand against a bril
liant sky,
And oak tree shadows trace a full de
sign?
Or when at dusk, from deepening
gloom, outshine
The campus lights; when evening
shadows lie
Along the dim arcades, —when ecnoes
die,
And dying, all the Quad to calm re
sign?
When love thee most? The coming
years will tell,
When we have slipped beyond the well
loved sight
Of chapel spire against the foothills
low, —
Those years when only memory's kind
ly spell
Cast round about us in the quiet night
Can bring us back to thee —then shall
we know.
