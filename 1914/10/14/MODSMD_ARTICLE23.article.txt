"Science" for February 4, 1910,
printed an article to prove the waste
experience of a college education by
showing the small earning capacity
of college men ten years after gradu
ation. The Dartmouth class of '99
was used as an example. Tn "Science"
for October 2, 1914, that article is an
swered by Professor H. A. Miller, of
Oberlin College, who, at the quinde
cennial reunion last .Tune, recorded the
net incomes of the graduates of the
same class. By a chart he proves that
a college education does pay finan
cially.
He says:"The present figures show
that there is a very rapid rise in this
capacity after ten years. Five years
ago there were nineteen men get
ting fifteen hundred or less —this
year only four. Then only sev
enteen per cent had more than th.ree
thousand dollars, and last year a lit
tle over fifty per cent were in this
class. Five years ago the highest man
had seven thousand dollars, and this
time the highest was twelve thousand,
with two tens. Five years ago the
average was $2,097, and this time $2,-
729, with the men at present much
more closely massed about the aver
age."
