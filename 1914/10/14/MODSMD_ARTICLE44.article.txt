# MAY SIGN A FOOTBALL PACT WITH SANTA CLARA
## WILCOX BARES TENTATIVE PLAN TO MAKE GAME ON 24TH GALA EVENT. 
### 
"Stanford and Santa Clara may even
tually he put on the same basis of
football relations as California and
Stanford," is a statement made yes
terday by Graduate Manager Wilcox.
"No agreement has been signed, as all
of the details are not settled upon."
Wilcox went on to say: "In fact, a
written agreement may not be at
tempted until next year."
The graduate manager's statement
will doubtless bring the Santa Clara
game, which will be played with Stan
ford a week from Saturday, before the
public eye to a position of greater im
portance than it has occupied previ
ously.
Special trains will be run between
San Jose and Stanford, bearing foot
ball fans from San Jose and Santa
Clara. Half cards will lie freely dis
tributed over the business section of
San Francisco. Steps will be taken to
bring the contest to the attention of
the Stanford alumni. Along this line
it is expected that bulletins will be
posted in the Press Club, as well as
other San Francisco organizations,
where they will reach the graduates.
A special section will be set aside
for the rooters, as the contest will
furnish an excellent chance for the
trying-out of new yells, stunts and
songs, which are liable to .be used for
the Stanford-California game.
