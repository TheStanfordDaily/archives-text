# TRAINER MALONEY FATHER OF JUNIOR SOCCER LEAGUE
## Five High Schools Respond to Call for Organization of New Football Association. 
### 
Through the efforts of Trainer Ma
loney, the Junior Exposition Soccer
League has been formed as a branch
of the recently-organized five-club
league, of which Maloney is president.
The junior organization will introduce
soccer in the leading high schools on
a regular sports basis.
The new high school league was
formed at a meeting of prominent soc
cer authorities at the Olympic Club
headquarters last Saturday, and has
been placed under the administration
of the Exposition League. The high
schools represented by delegates at
Saturday's meeting were Palo Alto,
Berkeley, San Jose, Alameda, and
Hitchcock.
It has been decided that the junior
league schedule will begin the second
semester of this term, in order that it
may not interfere with the rugby sea
son of the high schools in the league.
Although formal cup competition has
been deferred until after the Christmas
vacation, there will he a number of
games staged through this semester by
the schools that put their soccer teams
on the field this fall. It is hoped that
by giving an impetus to soccer in the
preparatory schools, the sport will
swing into greater prominence at Stan
ford and California.
