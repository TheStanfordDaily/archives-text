## 
### 
Arthur Row, of the company now
playing "Milestones" in San F.rancisco.
gave a reading of Maurice Maeter
linck's "Aglavaine and Sellysette" be
fore a large audience in the Chapel
yesterday afternoon. The reading was
greatly reduced from the original, thus
obviating much of the repetition so
common in Maeterlinck's works. The
reading was given under the auspices
of the English Club.
