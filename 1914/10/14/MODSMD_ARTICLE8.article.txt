# FRESHMEN WIN VICTORY BY A DECISIVE SCORE
## COLLEGE OF PACIFIC FIFTEEN IS ON SHORT END OF 21-0 CONTEST. 1918 PLAYS AN IMPROVED GAME STANFORD FIRST-YEAR TEAM REGISTERS THIRTEEN POINTS IN FIRST HALF. 
### 
Playing their best game of the
season, the freshmen ruggers out
fought and outclassed the College of
the Pacific fifteen in a fast exhibition
on the turf this afternoon. The score
board registered a 21 to 0 white
wash victory for the 1918 players.
After the first ten minutes of play
in the first half, the game was at all
times close and exciting. Clever
team work and hard playing alone al
lowed the baby team to show super
iority. For almost the first time this
season, the 1918 backfield tackled
clean and often.
First Half.
Fisher opened up for the Freshmen.
For five minutes the ball drifted back
and forth at the feet of the forwards
of both teams. Afte.r a scrum at mid
field, the 1918 pack dribbled to the
fifteen-yard line. Walker took the
ball from a ruck and passed to Greve
for a try. Fisher failed at conversion.
From a line-out on the ten-yard line
almost immediately following the
dropout, Walker snapped the ball to
Weeks for the second score. Fisher
converted.
At this stage of the game, the plac
ing became much harder fought and
well nigh even. Timely boots by
Fisher and Walker averted several
near Pacific scores. When the gun
was about to announce the end of the
first half, Walker received from the
fifteen-yard line-out, and passed to
Greve. The ball changed hands
quickly from Greve to Stafford to
Kirksey for the last try of the period.
Fisher's conversion raised the total
to 13 to 0.
Second Half.
Captain Hansen kicked off for the
College of the Pacific. Freshmen
forwards kept the play in the visitors'
territory for three minutes. Then a
cross kick by Stafford to Weeks, at.
wing, resulted in the first try of the
second period. Neuner added two
points with a kick between the posts.
Pacific scored a near try when
Springsten, the fast wing of the Ti
gers, got away for a dashing forty
yard run to the 1918 ten-yard line,
where a clever tackle by Chandler
saved.
Weeks scored the last try of th">
game after the baby forwards had
dribbled to the Tigers' ten-yard line,
when he picked up from the loose
and dashed over the line. Neuner
missed a difficult goal. Score 21-0.
