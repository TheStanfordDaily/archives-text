# ORR TO COACH VARSITY
## MAJOR LEAGUER TO TRAIN BASEBALL SQUAD Gaiety Theatre Will House the Football Show; I.E. Farrar, '15 Is Given the Appointment to Manage The Daily Palo Alto 
### 
The selection of Billy Orr as coach
for next year's varsity baseball squad
was sanctioned last evening by the
Executive Committee. Graduate Man
ager R. W. Wilcox, '13, was authorized
to conclude satisfactory terms with
him. Orr is well-known in major
league circles as utility infielde.r of
the Philadelphia Americans, and to
the baseball fans of the coast as the
brilliant shortstop of the Sacramento
Wolves, now the San Francisco Mis
sions. He has also visited the campus
with several teams, notably Ireland's
all-star aggregation, and his sensa
tional stickwork and tight fielding
have gained him an enviable reputa
tion among Stanford baseball enthusi
asts. Orr has expressed his willing
ness to accept the position offered
him, and the signing of the contract
seems to be the only step necessary to
secure his services as Stanford's next
coach.
I. E. Farrar, '15, was appointed busi
ness manager of The Daily Palo Alto, to
succeed F. E. Foster, '13, resigned.
Farrar has acted as Foster's assistant
during the present semester, and has
proved his ability to cope with the
present situation.
It was definitely decided to secure
the Gaiety Theater, in San Francisco,
Kolb and Dill's official stage, for the
Football Show on the night of the Dig
Game. The particular play which will
be produced by these two historic fun
makers is yet to be decided, but Wil
cox has been instructed to buy out the
entire house for Stanford students for
the night of November 14.
A five-dollar prize will be given to
any student who hands in a yell to
Deader C. H. Nixon, '15, which is suit
able for use in the bleachers on the
day of the intercollegiate game. Two
new songs were accepted on the .rec
ommendation of the special committee
