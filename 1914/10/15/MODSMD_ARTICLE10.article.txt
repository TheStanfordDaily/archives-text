## Captain R.P. Hobson, U.S.N. Addresses Informal Assemblage of Men on "Prohibition.” 
### 
Three hundred Stanford men stood
at attention on lower Lasuen for near
ly an hour last night, while Captain
Richmond P. Hobson, U. S. N., writer
and statesman, addressed them in the
interests of prohibition. An invita
tion to "Come Join the Band" proved
alluring, and the musicians, in their
march to Captain Hobson's headquar
ters at the Delta Chi fraternity and
then back to the front steps of 2
Lasuen, gathered in their wake a host
of followers.
Captain Hobson endeavored to im
press upon his audience the destruc
tive qualities of alcohol, as evidenced
by science. "Alcohol," be declared,
"is the millstone around the neck of
the people that is retarding evolution."
One very interesting statement made
by Captain Hobson, as the result of
personal investigation in the Congres
sional Library, follows:
"Hut 700,000 men have been authen
tically reported as killed in the history
of all wars since 300 B. C., while mo,re
than that number are killed indirectly
through the use of alcohol in the
United States each year." Other points
brought up were:
"You can't reform old drinkers.
Rescue work is not scientific, it is
significant that a drinking man will
never teach a youth to drink. Tt is
organized liquor that teaches; the sa
loon is its rendezvous.
"At last we have discovered the
serum deadly to alcoholism —the truth
about it. The city and county or state
system of prohibition is worth little.
Prohibition must be nation-wide—
world-wide."
When interrupted by the manager of
his Palo Alto meeting, because the
time of that gathering was past due
Captain Hobson said: "I would rath
er speak to these young men than to
20,000 grown-up voters." He continued
speaking fo.r fifteen minutes.
During the talk Captain Hobson de
scribed fully, but graphically, the con
duct of bis men In the blowing up of
the Merrimac in Santiago harbor.
