# Rubaiyat of a "Dippy" Tryoutee
## 
### 
A plaintive, sympathetic note is de
lightfully expressed in the following
appeal of a tryoutee endeavoring to
win a place upon the staff of The Daily
Palo Alto. Miss Stark, who is a mem
ber of the Stanford English Club,
voices the feelings of the average re
porter during the try-out period with
excellent understanding, though she
is not a "tryoutee" herself. The
verses follow:
When we were small and scared, and
lacked much proper information,
Our betters pointed out each siariy
constellation.
And out of all the shining throng that
overhead we saw,
The Dipper 'twas that most o'er
whelmed our childish souls with
awe.
And since that sight, one haunting
thought has troubled and per
plexed us,
Hath made us lose our youthful sleep,
by day and night hath vexed us.
And as the fateful weeks flit by, we
shiver in our slippers—
Which of the struggling, shooting stars
will turn to Little Dippers?
—Dare Stark, '17.
