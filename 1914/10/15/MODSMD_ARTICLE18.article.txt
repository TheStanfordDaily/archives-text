# America Will Demand Change in Her Colleges

### 
"What is wrong with the college?"
is a question that has repeatedly
found a place on the pages of ou.r peri
odicals. The query is put very forci
bly in an article by Joseph A. Reed, in
a recent number of the Forum, where
he asks, "Does the college send out in
to the world men who are abler in in
tellect, purer in heart, stronger in
right living and right thinking as a
.result of the four years' influence?"
Mr. Reed feels that the reasons for
the failure of the college are three
fold; firstly, that there are far too
many men in college with no purpose
at all in view; secondly, that the "side
shows" of college life, fraternities, ath
letics, dramatic and musical clubs, are
given undue importance in the under
graduate mind; thirdly, that the col
lege professor does not "size-up" his
promising material and seek to develop
it in the manner in which an athletic
coach makes the most of his men's
ability.
In summing up his observations, Mr.
Reed says:"The public and the parent
are investing funds in a venture which
brings 110 suitable return, but which,
for some reason, they do not appear
willingly to abandon or to reorganize.
"The boy is being placed in a posi
tion where, at the very outset
he is often absorbed by the wrong
group, and hence looks at college from
the wrong point of view.
"President Wilson has said: '1
know that the colleges of this coun
try must be reconstructed from top to
bottom, and 1 know that America is
going to demand it.' Consensus of
opinion in the educational world would
lay emphasis on this prophecy and
hasten the day of its fulfillment."
