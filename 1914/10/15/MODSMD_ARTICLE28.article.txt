Advocates Greater American Navy.
I Washington, Oct. 15.â€”Representa
tive Gardner, of Massachusetts, today
ignored President Wilson's neutrality
proclamation. He said: "It is true
that I do not stand for neutrality In
the present war. I am entirely con
vinced that the German cause is un
holy, menacing the principles of de
| mocracy. Furthermore, I believe that
the God of battles will visit defeat
upon the Germans. But no matter who
wins, we must remember that, since
the beginning of time, victorious na
tions have proved headstrong and
hi'j;h-handed.. We must begin immedi
ately to reorganize our military
strength, if we expect to be able to re
sist this high-handedness when the
day of necessity arrives."
The representative proposed a reso
lution providing a commission of three
senators and three congressmen and
three others to investigate America's
preparedness for war.
