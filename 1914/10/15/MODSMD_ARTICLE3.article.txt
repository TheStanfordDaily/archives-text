# NEW BLEACHER SONG WILL BE TRIED ON SATURDAY
## 
### 
The new bleacher song, by W. G.
Paul, '15, will be given its initial trial
in the bleachers at the game Saturday.
The song has a rousing swing and good
words, and seems destined to wear for
some seasons.
Copies of the song in blueprint have
been passed around to all the houses
on the campus, affording an oppor
tunity for everyone to familiarize him
self with the air and words. A few
moments given to study of these will
materially aid the yell-leaders, when
they try it out on Saturday, and will
insure its success when presented in
the California bleachers, November 14.
