### 
Washington, Oct. 15.â€”The public
health service says that leprosy may
yield to the ministrations of science.
This statement is based on the ap
parent successes of a new treatment, of
which the basic element is chaulmoo
gra oil, a tropical product. The de
partment states: 'It produces ap
parent cures in some cases, greatly im
proving many others, and arrests the
progress of the disease in almost every
instance."
