# STABLES REMOVED TO OLD CAMP SITE
## Buildings Are Located on Spot Which Served as Home For Many Prominent Alumni 
### 
The Stanford stables have been
moved within striking distance of the
Quad, and now occupy the plot of
ground on which the historic "Camp"
was located in early days. The fa
mous old barn which was originally
the center of so much racing activity
on the Stanford estate has been moved
up to a position near the forge and
foundry and faces the terminus of the
highway which runs along the western
side of the Quad.
A number of wagon sheds have also
been transferred from their original
position on the estate to a more handy
place near the barn. These changes
have been brought about through the
influence of Farm Superintendent J.
E. Hewston, whose activities have hith
erto been hampered by the scattered
position of the main buildings under
his care. This concentration of all
these structures about a central spot
near the Quad greatly assists him in
his work.
Hewston's ultimate aim is the con
struction of another large building,
just back of the Stanford Union lot,
which will contain room for black
smith and carpenter shops. At present
the foundry work is done in the brick
house, near the old racing course, too
far away for convenience.
The road which at present cuts
Lasuen street between the postoffice
and the new women's clubhouse will
be extended back to meet the high
way near the foreman's house. The
road which lies between the Hydraulic
Laboratory and the Forge is likewise
being lengthened past the highway.
This will be turned at right angles on
the eastern side of the lumber yard
and Electr'cal Engineering Labora
tories, and will run into the highway.
This leaves a triangular space which
will be converted into an attractive
little park.
Hedges of Lady Hanksia roses are
being planted around the lot which
forms the site of these buildings, and
will soften the barnlilce aspect of the
structures.
The barn and its outhouses occupy
the site of the old "Camp," which was
a lively center of student activities in
the early days. This name was ap
plied to several flimsy buildings which
were erected for the use of the work
men who constructed the Quad.
After the task was completed, the
workmen evacuated the buildings, and
the University authorities let out the
rooms at a very nominal rent to a
number of the students who were
working their way through college. A
long corridor .ran the length of the
main building, and was separated from
the rooms, if such they might be
called, by a frail partition, which was
so thin that even whispered under
tones reachcd every nook and corner
of the house.
Notwithstanding the unsubstantial
nature of the building, some very
prominent students made their homes
there. Bristow Adams, '00, the fath
er of the Chaparral, evolved his plans
for a Stanford comic amid these hum
ble surroundings. Ike Russell, who
edited the Quad of the 1904 class,
founded the basis for his newspaper
success in one of the rooms. Russell
is now on the staff of the New York
Times.
The old shacks also sheltered Will
and Wallace Irwin, whose post-college
activities need no explanation. Will
Irwin. '99, edited The Daily Palo Alto,
and his brother was editor of the 1900
Quad.
Dane Coolidge, '98, the well-known
author, one time editor of the Se
quoia. is another celebrity who
began his humble career in the Camp.
These and many other familiar figures
in the early history of the Farm,
helped to perpetuate the fame of these
old buildingsâ€”giving them a place in
the University community of the pion
eer day, quite as significant as Eneina
Hall in the present generation.
