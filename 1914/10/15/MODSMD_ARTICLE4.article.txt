# Rival Accepted Obvious Relief From Difficulty
## Action of California Committee in Lifting Ban on Freshmen in Athletics Causes no Surprise. 
### 
The action of the executive commit
tee at California last night indicates
that the Cardinal Varsity may be ex
pected to face several of the Fresh
men who have developed rugby talent
under Coach Schaeffer this season.
No great element of surprise enters
the discussion which has been roused
among Stanford sport gossips by the
lifting of the ban on Freshmen ath
letes at Berkeley. A natural interest
attaches to the news simply because
it points to a new departure or more
specifically a .reversion in policy.
There is nothing occult or mysteri
ous in the decision reached by the
chiefs at the rival athletic camp. Be
yond meaning that California's mis
fortune in losing a number of her vet
erans will be partly offset by drafting
new men, no significance ts to De at
tached.
An unavoidable loss of old timber
had to be made good. Several of the
1918 forwards and backs have dis
played undisputable flashes of Varsi
ty quality in preliminary games. Stu
dent sentiment caused the obvious and
sensible thing to be done, which was
to cancel the rules adopted in 1913,
which proscribed Freshman participa
tion in any form of intercollegiate
athletics.
Of course, the fact that there are
lean years, as well as fat years, caused
the change to be made at this partic
ular time. The natural causes leading
to the result are evident.
Stanford has always operated under
the rules which California has decided
to go back to. Many of the best of the
Cardinal football stars, as well as
those in other sports, have been devel
oped by placing Freshmen under Cali
fornia's fire-test.
The revised portions of the resolu
tion are:
Whereas, it was the expectation
of the Executive Committee on the 7th
day of May, 1913, that the adoption
of the said resolution (ineligibility of
Freshmen for Varsity teams) would
be followed by the adoption of a like
resolution by other colleges and uni
versities with which California main
tains athletic relations, and
Whereas, her expectations In This
regard were not fulfilled, and
Whereas, it is the sense of this com
mittee that Freshmen should not be
permitted to compete as members of
intercollegiate Varsity teams, but
that question of such competition is
not a matter for internal regulation
but a matter for mutual agreement
between the representatives of com
peting colleges and universities.
Now, therefore, be it resolved, that
said resolution of said 7th day of
May, 1913, be and is hereby repealed,
excepting where applied to those
cases where embodied in intracolle
giate agreements.

There is nothing occult or mysteri
ous in the decision reached by the
chiefs at the rival athletic camp. Be
yond meaning that California's mis
fortune in losing a number of her vet
erans will be partly offset by drafting
new men, no significance ts to De at
tached.
An unavoidable loss of old timber
had to be made good. Several of the
1918 forwards and backs have dis
played undisputable flashes of Varsi
ty quality in preliminary games. Stu
dent sentiment caused the obvious and
sensible thing to be done, which was
to cancel the rules adopted in 1913,
which proscribed Freshman participa
tion in any form of intercollegiate
athletics.
Of course, the fact that there are
lean years, as well as fat years, caused
the change to be made at this partic
ular time. The natural causes leading
to the result are evident.
Stanford has always operated under
the rules which California has decided
to go back to. Many of the best of the
Cardinal football stars, as well as
those in other sports, have been devel
oped by placing Freshmen under Cali
fornia's fire-test.
The revised portions of the resolu
tion are:
Whereas, it was the expectation
of the Executive Committee on the 7th
day of May, 1913, that the adoption
of the said resolution (ineligibility of
Freshmen for Varsity teams) would
be followed by the adoption of a like
resolution by other colleges and uni
versities with which California main
tains athletic relations, and
Whereas, her expectations In This
regard were not fulfilled, and
Whereas, it is the sense of this com
mittee that Freshmen should not be
permitted to compete as members of
intercollegiate Varsity teams, but
that question of such competition is
not a matter for internal regulation
but a matter for mutual agreement
between the representatives of com
peting colleges and universities.
Now, therefore, be it resolved, that
said resolution of said 7th day of
May, 1913, be and is hereby repealed,
excepting where applied to those
cases where embodied in intracolle
giate agreements.
The action of the executive commit
tee at California last night indicates
that the Cardinal Varsity may be ex
pected to face several of the Fresh
men who have developed rugby talent
under Coach Schaeffer this season.
No great element of surprise enters
the discussion which has been roused
among Stanford sport gossips by the
lifting of the ban on Freshmen ath
letes at Berkeley. A natural interest
attaches to the news simply because
it points to a new departure or more
specifically a .reversion in policy.
