# SEAT SALE ANNOUNCED
## RAM'S HEAD WILL ISSUE TICKETS TUESDAY Delightful Burlesque Promised by Clever Talent in Satire on Troublous Political Situation in the Republic of Mexico 
### 
Ram's Head announces that the tick
ets for "Routing Razmataz," which will
be staged a week from tomorrow ev
ening, will be placed on sale next
Tuesday afternoon at the campus
Bookstore, and at Weingartner's drug
store, in Palo Alto.
The most prominent features of the
Mexican revolution have been treated
in the plot of the new burlesque by M.
A. Hagen, '15, and not one detail wor
thy of satire has been omitted. The ro
mantic element, which lends the bur
letta its chief charm, is based upon
fact. Much of the local color was se
cured from a young Spanish girl whom
Hagen met during the past summer in
Monterey, and who furnished him a
model fo.r the creation of the role of
"Senorita Ysabel Adagal." J. R. Mor
gan, '16, who will characterize
"Senorita Ysabel" in the coming pro
duction, will endeavor to portray the
charming personality of this young
Spanish girl, who is a descendant of
one of the first governors of California.
"Mayme Razmataz," as impersonated
by M. ,T. Streeter, '18, is a character pe
culiar unto herself. She is a militant
suffragette, who comes to conquer
Mexico, not with weapons, Put with an
appeal to the gallantry of the rulers
there, demanding that they relinquish
the throne to her, if they are worthy
the names of gentlemen. Her desire
is that she may establish a nation of
militant suffragettes.
A very interesting character is rep
resented by B. H. Lasky, '12, who will
portry "John Linde," the Mexican rep
resentative of Bryan's grape-juice and
Hearst's moving picture company. His
nr'ssion is to gain the exclusive privi
lege of pedling grape-juice among the
soldiers, and to secure exclusive film
rights for the various battles.
Ram's Head is fortunate in securing
the services of H. H. Dievendorf, '17,
for the soubrette role of "Fifi Devine."
The other members of the cast will ap
pear to excellent advantage from
"Frijole Poriforio Diaz" (W. B. Forbes,
'15), "Tamalio De Nutt" (B. M. Mel
vin, '17), and "Mashmuro Togo" (.T. A.
Gibb, '15). to the three generals of the
Mexican army.
Effective scenery is in preparation
for the production, and the costumes
will be elaborate and lavish. The silks
and laces of the Mexican flower girls
and the velvet trousers and felt som
breros of the caballeros offer a rare
opportunity for vivid coloring.
Additional contributions to the book
and lyrics, by M. A. Hagen, '15. and to
the mbsic, composed by M. Blumenthal,
'16, have been made by W. S. Wilson,
'13. W. B. Forbes, '15, W. G. Paul. '15,
J. R. Morgan, '16, andC. Barker, '18.
