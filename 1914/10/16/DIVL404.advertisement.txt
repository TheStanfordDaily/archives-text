The Perfccl Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
Tuxedo grew rapidly in public
favor, and without advertising
reached the stupendous total of fifty
or sixty million packages a year. Not
until the past few months could Tux

increased facilities permit every man
to smoke this best of tobaccos.
Tuxedo is fine, ripened Burley
tobacco of the highest grade —aged
until thoroughly mild and mellow.

delicious Burley fragrance and flavor.
