## "We Were Not Successful; We Were Merely Right" Is Keynote of Lecture. 
### 
"We are not successful; we were
merely right" was for the second time
the keynote of the "Confessions of a
Peacemaker," delivered by Chancellor
David Starr Jordan before an apprecia
tive audience in the Assembly Hall last
night.
The Chancellor told of his obser
vations in the war-stricken countries,
where lie became firmly convinced
that the people did not desire war.
The fact that the government wanted
war was the dominant fact, he de
clared, for the people are but chat
tels of their rulers.
Dr. Jordan said:
"There are two ways to spread the
culture of a nation —by farce of arms
and by force of brains.
"The war debt of the world before
the war began was $5,000,000,000. How
much that will be increased by the
present conflict is hard to say.
"There is but one way for Americans
to aid in bringing about peace. That
is by backing President Wilson when
he sees a way out of the crisis.
"The Balkan war paid the French
war implement manufacturers a divi
dend of 21%, and the German Krupp
people a 14% dividend.
"Victory and defeat in the present
war will be very much alike, for the
distress of both winner and loser will
be equally terrible.
"Some war must be the last war, the
present war will probably be final, un
less minor struggles follow it."
