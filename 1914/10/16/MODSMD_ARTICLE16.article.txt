# To Those Not Called
## 
### 
An hour's hard play tomorrow will
bring joy to perhaps a score of Fresh
men whose rugby caliber makes them
worthy of the block '18'—that same
hour will mean bitter disappointment
for others who are not so strong or so
fleet, yet have given of their best in
the weeks of training in the play. A
big crowd will gather in the bleach
ers to check and criticise the result of
expert coaching in the intricacies of
rugby football. The freshmen select
ed will put their best foot forward be
fore a crowd that is prepared to be
generous in approval. It should be a
good game, and not one of us will hes
itate to give praise where it is due, to
stamp the 1918 team with our ap
proval.
What shall we say of the men on the
sidelines and in the bleachers, the
many that have no standing place in
the strong light of public criticism?
Shall it be said only that their quality
had been tested and they were found
wanting? The man who puts the
champion to his best pace for a record
is t'..e runner-up—to the "unsuccess
ful" second is due a full share of the
honors. To the victor belongs the
spoils, but there is reflected glory for
the vanquished.
The substitutes who are not called
from the sidelines tomorrow are the
runners-up—the team that opposes
St. Mary's is in its true sportsmanship
and clean play the best tribute to their
worth.
