# CHANCELLOR WILL SPEAK AT SECOND MEN'S MEETING
## "A College Man's Belief" Is to Be Topic of Informal Talk at Encina Hall. 
### 
"A College Man's Relief" will be the
subject of Doctor David Star.r Jor
dan's second informal talk to the men
of Stanford Sunday evening. This was
the topic of a similar talk by the
Chancellor two years ago, as the old
er men of the University may remem
ber. However, the extemporaneous
nature of these talks insures a fresh
ness of ideas and expression which
will make it well worth the while of
every man to attend this meeting.
Doctor Jordan has foregone the
pleasure of a week-end trip to Carmel
with his family, in order to speak
Sunday evening.
The meeting will be at Enclna Hall,
as usual, and will begin at 7:30.
