strength and power behind his writ
ings. He has been a contributor to

with poems, short stories and articles
for a numbe.r of years. The following
verse is one of his most popular snori
er poems:
Did you tackle the trouble that came
your way
With a resolute heart and cheerful?
Or hide your face from the light of
day
With a craven soul and fearful?
Oh, a trouble's a ton, or a trouble's an
ounce,
Or a trouble is what you make it,
And it isn't the fact that you'.re hurt
that counts,
But only how did you take it?
You are beaten to earth? Well, well,
what's that?
Come up with a smiling face.
It's nothing against you to fall down
flat.
But to lie there —that's disgrace.
The harder you're thrown, why the
higher you bounce;
Be proud of your blackened eye!
It isn't the fact that you're licked that
counts;
Tt's how did you fight—and why?
And though you be done to the death,
what then ?
If you battled the best you could,
If you played your part in the wo.rld of
men,
Why, the Critic will call it good.
Death comes with a crawl, or comes
with a pounce,
And whether he's slow or spry,
It isn't the fact that you're dead that
counts,
But only how did you die?
—Edmund Vance Cook.
