# Summer School Factor in Modern Universities
## 
### 
There can be no denying the im
pressiveness of the registration
figures of Columbia University. Twelve
thousand students constitute a schol
astic body whose numbers are unap
proached by those of any other uni
versity in this country or by many
abroad. At the same time, certain
qualifications must be made in com
parison of this number with that of
even a few decades ago at Columbia
o.r any other American university:
No one will suppose that all of these
twelve thousand are looking forward
to a bachelor's degree in either arts
or science. But how many persons
realize that half of this twelve thou
sand are only summer school stu
dents, who would not have figured at
all a few years ago? Some of these
are doubtless men and women who go
to summer school year after year, un
til they reach the goal at which others
arrive more rapidly, but this can
hardly be said of the great mass of
them. Just as the Ph. D. is a fetish in
some quarters, so is even the brief
est attendance at a university in oth
ers. A teacher who feels the compe
tition of younger and better-prepared
rivals, circumvents them by spending
six weeks at some well-known sum
mer school.
