### 
Scoring on a passed ball just be
fore the game was called, because of
darkness, team AA nosed out a 1-0
victory on the Auxiliary diamond yes
terday afternoon. The batteries for
both teams worked effectively. The
AA batsmen were held to three hits,
while the "big stickers" for A were
only able to connect fo.r two measly
bingles.
