Washington, Oct. 16. â€”Secretary Red
field writes Senator Simmons that the
commercial situation throughout the
country is promising. He commented:
"It is clear our imports reached their
low points during the latter part of
August. Since then they have risen
and the tendency is to increase." The
secretary admitted that commerce suf
fered from the shock of the first few
weeks of the war, but declared that
both the neutral and belligerent na
tions are now turning to America for
supplies, especially for shoes, textiles,
and iron.
