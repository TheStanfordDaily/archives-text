## 
### 
Boston, Oct. 1G. â€”Within a few clays
there will be installed 011 the new bat
tleship Nevada, at the Fore River ship
yards, the first three-gun turrets ev
er placed on an American battleship.
They will be the best protected of any
in the world, and will be the heaviest
ever set up, weighing on average about
eighty tons, or some eleven tons heav
ier than the turrets on the Argentine
battleship Rivadavia, which was con
sidered the "last word" in naval con
struction.
Each of the Nevada's turrets will
have three fourteen-inch guns, the
most powerful on any United States
battleship, and rivalled only by a few
in the British and German navy. They
will weigh about 147,. r >oo pounds each,
will be fifty-three feet long, and will
throw a projectile weighing 140 ft
pounds. The latter will carry a much
larger amount of high explosives than
the STJS-pound projectiles of the twelve
inch pieces.
