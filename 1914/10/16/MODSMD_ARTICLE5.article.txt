Thirty golf enthusiasts met in the
Vestry last evening to reorganize and
revive the Stanford Golf Club. Dr. H.
S. Stoltz was elected president and L.
Sloss, '15, secretary.
The new club considered the build
ing of a permanent golf links on the
estate. A committee composed of
Professors R. E. Allardice and V. L.
Kellogg, and Miss Marie de Forest, '15,
and A. Baldwin, 'IS, was appointed to
appear before the Board of Trustees in
the near future in regard to obtaining
a site for links.
Until the course is constructed,
members of the club will play on one
of the nearby links. A. Edwards, '14,
R. Reineman, '15, and L. Sloss, '15,
were appointed to make arrangements
to this effect with one of the clubs in

the University who were unable to at
tend the first meeting will hand their
names either to the president o,r the
secretary right away. About thirty
became members at the first meeting,
but all the golf fans are wanted in the
club.
With golf coming into its own
throughout the country, and it being
a major sport in the large eastern
universities, for which a major letter
is given, the re-advent, of golf into
Stanford activities should excite the
interest and support of the entire Uni
versity.
Twice before. Stanford golf fiends
have constructed links, only to have
their course appropriated fo.r other
purposes. The last links was con
structed on the hillsides by the reser
voir, but so many homes were con

abandoned.
