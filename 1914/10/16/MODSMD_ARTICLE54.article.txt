# STICKWORK BY TERRY IS PROFITABLE TO ANGELS
## Former Stanford Baseball Skipper Is Making Good in Field of Professional Baseball 
### 
"Zeb" Terry, four-star man on the
Stanford diamond, and skipper of the
nine during the past two years, is
making good in the professional field
of baseball, according to the opinion
of experts at the game. Since last
August, Terry has been holding down
the utility berth of infielder on the
Los Angeles Coast League team.
in yesterday's contest with San
Francisco, the former Cardinal captain
registered three singles in as many
times at bat off Williams, one of the
leading pitchers of the league, and, in
addition, came through with one putout
and five assists without an error. The
sporting editor of the San Francisco
Call, in Thursday evening's issue, paid
the following compliment to Terry's
ability and prospects in the baseball
world.
"Terry played a nailing game at sec
ond for the Angels yesterday. He
looks like a brilliant fielde.r, and has
a good chance to be the Angel's regu
lar second baseman next year. While
he only managed to get one hit in five
times up (Wednesday's game), he
landed squarely on the ball, and was
unlucky in not placing his drives in
safe territory."
For the last ten days Terry has been
making his headquarters on the Stan
ford campus, during his playing sea
son at San Francisco.
