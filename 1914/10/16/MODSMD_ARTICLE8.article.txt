# FRESHMEN DON SUITS TO MEET ST. MARY'S IN FINALE TOMORROW
## Titan Club Players on Calling List of Varsity—Santa Clara Will Be Scene of Contest With Second Varsity Squad IMPORTANT FINISH FOR 1918 
### 
St. Mary's fast ruggers will give
the Freshmen a chance to raise their
season percentage in the last game of
the schedule, which is posted for 2:45
tomorrow afternoon.
After the workout of 1918 the Var
sity will take the field against the
Titan Club. The second team will
visit Santa Clara for an afternoon
match.
The Freshmen have a worthy oppo
nent, and a hard problem in the St.
Mary combination. The twenty first
year men who are eligible for class
team honors will be given a gruelling
workout, in the light of prophecy that
may be gathered from the reputation
of the Catholic boys. Though they
have not played on the local turf this
season, they will bring the record of
having lost to the best f.reshman squad
the Blue and Gold has ever mustered
by a score of G to 0.
The fifteen men named for places in
the first formation and their substi
tutes represent all the possible run
ners-up for 1918 sweaters and numer
als. The players who will enter the
first scrimmage have played together
through most of the season, and have
tightened thei.r work to such a degree
in the last handful of games that the
disapproval of the campus has been
appeased.
The Titan Club is a well-known
quantity, and will produce incentive
for a lusty bleacher practice. One
month ago the club scored a try and
converted against the Second Varsity
after time was called, turning the
tables, and winning by a single tally.
Their last coup was achieved Saturday,
when they held the California varsity,
augmented by star freshmen, to a 17-5
result. With tomorrow's match out of
the way, the season's wo.rk will con
sist of only three preliminary games.
The absence of Charley Austin from
first five, has caused Andrews to be
moved from his fullback position.
Templeton will guard the Stanford
line. Pettingill is named as "Jumbo"
Blase's proxy at lock. Tn other details
the lineup is familiar.
One of the strongest second teams
that has ever been developed at Stan
ford will make the trip to Santa Clara
to try conclusions with the Mission
squad. The Cardinal players took the
measure of their opponents three
weeks ago by a narrow margin. The
fight which Santa Clara never fails to
offer will have greater effect on home
ground, and the outcome is not as
sured. Several of the backs have been
in the running for 1914 Varsity berths,
and the team combination of both di
visions of the squad has been working
like oiled machinery.
Coach Fletcher, of the University of
the Pacific fifteen, will bring his
charges to Stanford Field for a game
with the third team at 11 o'clock to
morrow morning.
Following are the Stanford line-ups:
Varsity—Hall, Soper, Clover (Sin

Freshmen—Henry (Ford), Bihlman
(Haines), Slocum (Stevick), Coleman
(Eaton), R. Johnson (Alderton), Earl
(Wylie), McArthux (Boyd), Card
(Sherman), Steinbeck), forwards;
Walker (Walters), half; Greve, Staf
ford (Jeffers), five-eighths, Kirksey
(Neuner), center; Weeks (Kyle), Wint
ers (C. Johnson), (Graham), wings;
Fisher (Chandler), full.
St. Mary's fast ruggers will give
the Freshmen a chance to raise their
season percentage in the last game of
the schedule, which is posted for 2:45
tomorrow afternoon.
After the workout of 1918 the Var
sity will take the field against the
Titan Club. The second team will
visit Santa Clara for an afternoon
match.
The Freshmen have a worthy oppo
nent, and a hard problem in the St.
Mary combination. The twenty first
year men who are eligible for class
team honors will be given a gruelling
workout, in the light of prophecy that
may be gathered from the reputation
of the Catholic boys. Though they
have not played on the local turf this
season, they will bring the record of
having lost to the best f.reshman squad
the Blue and Gold has ever mustered
by a score of G to 0.
The fifteen men named for places in
the first formation and their substi
tutes represent all the possible run
ners-up for 1918 sweaters and numer
als. The players who will enter the
first scrimmage have played together
through most of the season, and have
tightened thei.r work to such a degree
in the last handful of games that the
disapproval of the campus has been
appeased.
The Titan Club is a well-known
quantity, and will produce incentive
for a lusty bleacher practice. One
month ago the club scored a try and
converted against the Second Varsity
after time was called, turning the
tables, and winning by a single tally.
Their last coup was achieved Saturday,
when they held the California varsity,
augmented by star freshmen, to a 17-5
result. With tomorrow's match out of
the way, the season's wo.rk will con
sist of only three preliminary games.
The absence of Charley Austin from
first five, has caused Andrews to be
moved from his fullback position.
Templeton will guard the Stanford
line. Pettingill is named as "Jumbo"
Blase's proxy at lock. Tn other details
the lineup is familiar.
One of the strongest second teams
that has ever been developed at Stan
ford will make the trip to Santa Clara
to try conclusions with the Mission
squad. The Cardinal players took the
measure of their opponents three
weeks ago by a narrow margin. The
fight which Santa Clara never fails to
offer will have greater effect on home
ground, and the outcome is not as
sured. Several of the backs have been
in the running for 1914 Varsity berths,
and the team combination of both di
visions of the squad has been working
like oiled machinery.
Coach Fletcher, of the University of
the Pacific fifteen, will bring his
charges to Stanford Field for a game
with the third team at 11 o'clock to
morrow morning.
Following are the Stanford line-ups:
Varsity—Hall, Soper, Clover (Sin

(Wright), Pettingill (Halsted), Wylie
