United Press Telegraphic Report
Paris, Oct. 19. —The German inva
sion of France, through Southern Bel
gium, has been checked, according to
this afternoon's statement of the Com
munique. Headquarters is most opti
mistic, and believes that the Teutonic
offensive machine has again failed. It
is expected that the proposed advance
on Paris via the sea coast will soon be
abandoned, and some even predict that
the Germans will retire from all north
ern France in the near future. They
may be premature, but the tide of bat
tle for the past seventy-two hours has
undoubtedly been distinctly in the al
lies' favor. They are reported to dom
inate the north, repelling the Ger
mans everywhere.
Berlin Reports Situation Unchanged.
Berlin, Oct. 19. —Advices report the
general situation in both France and
Belgium as unchanged, with few ex
ceptions. Details have been withheld
as to the re-arrangements of the
troops. South of Ostend on the Ger
man light the fighting is continuous,
but nowhere decisive. A garrison mere
ly sufficient to hold the captured forts
has been left at Ostend by the Ger
mans, the remainder of the army mov
ing farther south.
Allies Claim Slow Advance.
Paris, Oct. 19. —The Communique
states that the allies have repulsed
the Germans on the north, while the
Belgians, who have been concentrated
along the new line inside the Belgian
frontier, have driven the Teutons back
to Roulers, thirteen miles northwest of
Coutrai, situated almost directly on the
border line: The allied left wing,
which is making a slow advance to
ward Lille, is encountering severe
fighting in the neighborhood of La
basse, and the villages of Ablain and
St. Nazaire. The German opposition in
this section of the battlefield is very
formidable, as the allies are compelled
to advance literally "from house to
house."
German Arc Is Flattened.
London, Oct. 19. —It is confirmed
here that the British and French lines
have straightened out considerably as
a result of hard fighting. This is the
meaning applied to last night's an
nouncement that the German forces
had been driven back thirty miles bv
the allied army. A series of heavy en
gagements have prevented General von
Boehm from attacking Dunkirk by way
of a southern route. The Teutons, who
have been reinforced, are advancing on
their .right upon Lille, a city of con
siderable population, whence the Brit
ish are slowly retiring.

Dunkirk in Pafli of (Jeminns.
London, Oct. 19.—The Rotterdam
Daily Mail reports the success of the
Teuton invasion across the Belgian
frontier into France near the coast,
within ten miles reach of Dunkirk.
Since the heavy siege guns, which have
figured so prominently in the war thus
far. have been taken along, an attack
upon Dunkirk is anticipated. Confir
mation of the report from official
sources has not been attained.
United Press Telegraphic Report
Paris, Oct. 19. —The German inva
sion of France, through Southern Bel
gium, has been checked, according to
this afternoon's statement of the Com
munique. Headquarters is most opti
mistic, and believes that the Teutonic
offensive machine has again failed. It
is expected that the proposed advance
on Paris via the sea coast will soon be
abandoned, and some even predict that
the Germans will retire from all north
ern France in the near future. They
may be premature, but the tide of bat
tle for the past seventy-two hours has
undoubtedly been distinctly in the al
lies' favor. They are reported to dom
inate the north, repelling the Ger
mans everywhere.
Berlin Reports Situation Unchanged.
Berlin, Oct. 19. —Advices report the
general situation in both France and
Belgium as unchanged, with few ex
ceptions. Details have been withheld
as to the re-arrangements of the
troops. South of Ostend on the Ger
man light the fighting is continuous,
but nowhere decisive. A garrison mere
ly sufficient to hold the captured forts
has been left at Ostend by the Ger
mans, the remainder of the army mov
ing farther south.
Allies Claim Slow Advance.
Paris, Oct. 19. —The Communique
states that the allies have repulsed
the Germans on the north, while the
Belgians, who have been concentrated
along the new line inside the Belgian
frontier, have driven the Teutons back
to Roulers, thirteen miles northwest of
Coutrai, situated almost directly on the
border line: The allied left wing,
which is making a slow advance to
ward Lille, is encountering severe
fighting in the neighborhood of La
basse, and the villages of Ablain and
St. Nazaire. The German opposition in
this section of the battlefield is very
formidable, as the allies are compelled
to advance literally "from house to
house."
