# California's "White Book"
## 
### 
White Books, Orange Books, Red
Books, Yellow Books —official state
ments in justification of past action —
have become as numerous as declara
tions of war in the last ten weeks, and
as commonplace. Responsible parties
in the governments of the nations in
volved in the European debacle spent
days in mental gymnastics, interpret
ing and misinterpreting the moves of
their opponents and expatiating on
their own meritorious conduct. Now
a Blue and Gold Book is added to the
list, the University of California lines
up with the slandered autocrats, and
we are allowed an insight into the
mysterious reasonings of 'those' at
Berkeley. At least a review of the
editorials in the daily publication of
the State University would seem to af
ford the nucleus for the most complete
of "White Books," for there is found
the supposedly official explanation of
rulings and reversions that appear
perfectly simple on the face of things.
In May, 1913, a rule was passed by
the executive committee eliminating
Freshmen from varsity competition,
the regulation to take effect a year
from date. To excerpt from an article
written this semester: "The danger
had long been rising that California
should become a place where promi
nent athletes should gather, not for
purposes of education, but merely that
they might gain fame by playing on a
California team. * * * The rule would
not take effect for a year, and that
was a time too far away to worry
about * * *. All the other colleges of
the state have done so (passed a sim
ilar rule) but Stanford has not, * * *
and now comes the football season
and the test of the ideals of Califor
nia. They (the next three months)
will show whether she cares more for
winning, or for playing the game the
way she thinks is right* *
Following two months' trial of this
scheme, the ruling was rescinded, and
Freshmen were made eligible for in
tercollegiate competition. This revok
ing was evidently in accord with the
opinion of the majority of California
students, though it has been main
tained that the reversal of the rule is
but to offer a breathing spell. At the
same time the statement was made
that a demand was to be made in Jan
uary. or before, that the Freshmen
should be barred from the varsity
teams of both universities.
The ruling has traveled a rutted
road, and its journey has been

watched with interest. But the reach
ing of its destination will not affect
Stanford —the route of one unit of the
collegiate group to a given end will
not alter the course of the second. It
is granted that both have the one
goal in view, intercollegiate competi
tion under ideal conditions —clean
sportsmanship, freedom from taint of
professionalism, high scholastic stand
ards. The first condition is rightly ex
pected in play of college men, profes
sionalism has niver been a bug-bear
in California-Stanford relations, and
the California Freshman ruling is a
step in the direction of the third that
parallels the probation rule passed
at this University years ago. The re
gard of California for the morale of the
first-year men is laudable, the en
forced quiet for a year would prom
ise the same effect in a scholastic way
that the Damoclean sword of possible
probation has on the scholarship of
the Cardinal babes.
If the dilemma is ticklish for the
sponsors of the California Freshmen,
the fact does not involve outsiders in
the purely internal worries of our
friendly rivals. Whatever their ac
tion may be, the decision is immateri
al to Stanford.

in the governments of the nations in
volved in the European debacle spent
days in mental gymnastics, interpret

their opponents and expatiating on

a Blue and Gold Book is added to the

up with the slandered autocrats, and
we are allowed an insight into the

Berkeley. At least a review of the
editorials in the daily publication of
the State University would seem to af
ford the nucleus for the most complete
of "White Books," for there is found
the supposedly official explanation of
rulings and reversions that appear
perfectly simple on the face of things.
In May, 1913, a rule was passed by
the executive committee eliminating
Freshmen from varsity competition,
the regulation to take effect a year
from date. To excerpt from an article
written this semester: "The danger
had long been rising that California
should become a place where promi
nent athletes should gather, not for
purposes of education, but merely that
they might gain fame by playing on a
California team. * * * The rule would
not take effect for a year, and that
was a time too far away to worry
about * * *. All the other colleges of
the state have done so (passed a sim
ilar rule) but Stanford has not, * * *
and now comes the football season
and the test of the ideals of Califor
nia. They (the next three months)
will show whether she cares more for
winning, or for playing the game the
way she thinks is right* *
Following two months' trial of this
scheme, the ruling was rescinded, and
Freshmen were made eligible for in
tercollegiate competition. This revok
ing was evidently in accord with the
opinion of the majority of California
students, though it has been main
tained that the reversal of the rule is
but to offer a breathing spell. At the
same time the statement was made
that a demand was to be made in Jan
uary. or before, that the Freshmen
should be barred from the varsity
teams of both universities.
The ruling has traveled a rutted
road, and its journey has been

watched with interest. But the reach
ing of its destination will not affect
Stanford —the route of one unit of the
collegiate group to a given end will
not alter the course of the second. It
is granted that both have the one
goal in view, intercollegiate competi
tion under ideal conditions —clean
sportsmanship, freedom from taint of
professionalism, high scholastic stand
ards. The first condition is rightly ex
pected in play of college men, profes
sionalism has niver been a bug-bear
in California-Stanford relations, and
the California Freshman ruling is a
step in the direction of the third that
parallels the probation rule passed
at this University years ago. The re
gard of California for the morale of the
first-year men is laudable, the en
forced quiet for a year would prom
ise the same effect in a scholastic way
that the Damoclean sword of possible
probation has on the scholarship of
the Cardinal babes.
If the dilemma is ticklish for the
sponsors of the California Freshmen,
the fact does not involve outsiders in
the purely internal worries of our
friendly rivals. Whatever their ac
tion may be, the decision is immateri
al to Stanford.
