# "What's the Score?"
## 
### 
Amos R. Wells has w.ritten the fol
lowing estimate of the game of life,
which recently appeared in "Life:"
In hut and palace, field and mart,
From mountain top to ocean shore,
One query flutters every heart,
One eager question—"What's the
score?"
It may be tennis, golf or chess,
Or baseball, football, basketball,
Billiards or bowling, still we press
The same inquiry for them all.
Not how they played, well or ill.
And not the spirit they displayed,
Nor how they proved their strength
and skill —
But only this, the score they made.
And thoughtful men and silly fools,
And underfed and overfed,
And banks and courts and learned
schools
Are asking merely, "Who's ahead?"
And isn't this the thing we ask
On every matter, o'er and o'er,
Not how men do the varied task.
But "Who's ahead?" and "What's the
score?"
