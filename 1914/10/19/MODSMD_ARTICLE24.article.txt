Cloudy today—perhaps tomorrow.

He (excitedly)— Hooray. That's drib

She (regretfully)—And Frederick,
we haven't an umbrella.
Five seeds for a new yell! A chance
for everybody to acquire fame and to
devolp that yeller streak.
Five stones, —count 'em! Five
dances! Five taxis both ways! A
section at the nig Game! Two front
ones for Mayme Razzledazzle and
"Ready Money," and all you and sho

faint one.
