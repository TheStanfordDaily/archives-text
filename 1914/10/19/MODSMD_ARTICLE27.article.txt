Transfers to Stanford from other
colleges can now see papers from
their former alma maters at the Y. M.
C. A. reading room.
More than fifty exchanges are now
received by the Daily Palo Alto and
are placed in the Y. M. C. A. reading
room fo.r the benefit of the student
body.
The exchanges will be kept in a
special set of files, where papers from
any college may be easily found.
