# Fourteen Freshmen Kept on Varsity Rugby Squad
## Coach Brown's Policy and Football Program for the Remainder of Season Announced. 
### 
With only four more weeks remain
ing before the annual Stanford-Cali
fornia clasli on November 14, Coach
Brown has made several cuts and ad
ditions in the personnel of the Varsity
Squad. Nineteen men, who up to this
time during the season, have been
playing on the inside field as first
team candidates, have been banished to
the Auxiliary field, where they will be
under the supervision of Athletic Di
rector H. R. Stolz. Fourteen of the
most promising Freshmen of the 1918
squad have been selected to remain on
the turf with Coach Brown, while the
remainder will be sent outside.
The first-year players who were an
nounced eligible for Varsity honors
may only remain with the older men
for a short while, since it is the inten
tion of Brown to thin out the players
of Varsity and non-Varsity caliber as
soon as weaknesses are apparent. The
following Freshmen have been chosen
to compete on an equal basis with the
Varsity squad: Henry. Stevick, R.
Johnson, Cole, Card, Steinbeck, Slo
cum, Earl, Neuner, G.reve, Winters,
Kirksey, Chandler, and Walker.
The Varsity squad, which is at pres
ent composed of sixty-eight men, will
be divided into three teams with their
substitutes. On each Tuesday and
Thursday the greys and blacks or first
and second teams will line-up against
each other. Since there remain no
more mid-week games, the Third Var
sity will oppose the pick of the out
side players o.r Team A each Wednes
day. Regular practice will be held
on Mondays and Fridays. This weekly
schedule will be in order for the re
mainder of the season .
Three more contests with outside
fifteens are yet to be played by the
Varsity before the Big Game. Next
Saturday Santa Clara will offer the
most severe competition of the sea
son to the Cardinal ruggers. Alumni
team will be on deck for the next
week-end. On the Saturday previous
to the Big Game, the Olympic Club
will be used to put the final polish on
the Varsity's play.
