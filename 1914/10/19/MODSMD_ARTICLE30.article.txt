# DR. GARDNER PREACHES ON EVILS OF GAMBLING
## "Enough Uncertainty in Athletics Without Adding Unhealthy Excitemen of a Bet," Says Chaplain. 
### 
Rev. D, Charles Gardner, in his ser
mon at the Memorial unurcn at eleven
o'clock spoke with reference to gam
bling. He said: "I conclude that
gambling is immoral for these reasons.
1. Because it seeks personal gain
through another's loss. It is a viola
tion of the Golden Rule. 2. Because it
is not useful socially. It is disruptive
and demoralizing in business and so
cial relations. 3. Because it destroys
the foundation of personal character.
4. Because it determines the owner
ship of property by an appeal to
chance." As applied to betting on in
tercollegiate games, he argued, "There
is surely enough fun. enough uncer
tainty, enough excitement in the na
ture of the game of football o.r base
ball or a track meet without adding
the unhealthy excitement of a bet."
