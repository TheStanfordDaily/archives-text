# DR. JORDAN RECOMMENDS RELIGION OF DEEDS TO GATHERING AT ENCINA
## Chancellor Represents Church Membership as Mere Basis of a Virtuous Life. 
### 
"Wisdom is knowing what to do
next. Virtue is doing it," said Doctor
David Starr Jordan in his talk on "A
College Alan's Religion" to the men of
Stanford at Encina last evening.
"Merely placing yourself on a pedes
tal and doing nothing is not virtue,"
he continued. "Doing right is working
along the lines that make society pos
sible. Our religion is the motive
which makes us prefer virtue to vice
—that which harmonizes us with the
outside world.
"This is our own religion, and is not
restricted to creeds or sects. Being
a Methodist, or the member of any oth
er church, is not being religious.
Neither will you become religious by
attending church. You may in this
way put yourself in a position to do
good work, but the mere sitting down
and listening to the sermon or music,
and looking at the girls, will not make
you any better. Religion is not a
theory. It is not a question of wheth
er you will or will not be saved here
after. The big thing is to save your
self now.
"Elaborate ceremonies are not pious
nor religious. They may be of help to
some, just as going to church; but
they are not essential. Neither is dis
cipline a part of religion. Nothing dis
agreeable is necessary, but rather the
essential thing is harmony.
"It is not necessary to believe that
the whale swallowed Jonah and
gave him up again, nor indeed to think
about the Bible at all. The teachings
of Christ would have come down to us
in other ways, if the Bible had been
lost to present generations. Things
are not true because Jesus said them;
but rather Jesus said them because
they were true. These things are not
essential to the religion in you, but
they influence your life and motives.
Literally Jesus is not our saviour. You
will not be made better by merely
calling on his name. But in the broad
sense, through the influence of his
teachings, you will be saved."
