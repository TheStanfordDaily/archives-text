# SATURDAY'S RUGBY CALENDAR REVEALS A WIN AND LOSE TIE
## Freshmen Meet Defeat in Finale With Mission Fifteen in Close and Hard-Fought Struggle—Varsity Is Victor Over Titan Club in Game Featured by Back Field Play SECOND VARSITIES IN A 6-6 DRAW 
### 
The rugby fans took home with them
considerably more than fifty cents
worth of value after seeing the Var
sity and Freshmen perform Saturday
afternoon. That may be said, despite
the fact that 19 IS had to swallow a
14 to 9 defeat, which was dealt by St.
Mary's in the final match of the sea
son.
In order to mass thirty-five points
while the Titans were achieving six,
the Varsity had to work its shattered
backfield overtime. The absence of
both Austin and Lachniund from their
live-eighths caused a makeshift or
ganization, which worked admirably at
a disadvantage.
Dribbling and individual dashes
across the chalk line were the order
of the afternoon. The ball was sel
dom swung out into the passing rushes
which have distinguished the regular
combination of backs, but the emergen
cy men crowded their opponents with
out mercy, and repeatedly broke
through to smother attempts to get the
Titan's play from under foot.
One of the specially bright parts of
the game came at the end or the first
half, when Wylie, Wines, and Braden,
of the forwards, took a twenty-yard
trip to a score, passing accurately, and
dodging at curious angles. Others
who contributed directly to the four
teen points registered in the first thir
ty-five minutes were Gard, Andrews,
and Templeton.
M. Forbes, right wing, attached three
tallies for the Titans, by a well-direct
ed kick from placement.
The club players plunged into the
second half with spirit, and early
broke the Cardinal defense with the
only effective backfield attack of the
contest. The ball was started by N.
Slater, at half, and followed the line
out to Lazar, who tried, concluding the
scoring for the opposition.
Occasionally the Varsity gave a sam
ple of good passing, and open work
was fairly sprinkled through the re
mainder of the game. Tilton, Temple
ton, Braden, Wylie, and Soper formed
the scoring combination of the sec
ond period.
Referee. Lafferty; time of halves,
thirty-five minutes.
Freshmen l-ose (Gracefully.
Misfortune shadowed (lie first year
men in their last chance to return a
victory. The eighteen men who won
block "18b" displayed pluck and
Hashes of clast;. Anybody might have
taken the game until the last few min
utes. A fighting attack by the Catholic

team turned the trick, and the Fresh
men had to fall off the fence the
wrong way.
The four and one scoring system
was used in the Freshman game.
There was marked similarity of play
in the Freshman-St. Mary's game,
with that of the Varsity, which fol
lowed. The game stayed on the ground,
and the ball had a chance to become
well smeared with grass green.
Winters' twenty-yard run through
the defence of the visitors served as a
curtain-raiser, and roused the bleach
ers to hopes of victory. In the scrum,
however, the opponents soon proved
that they could a little more than hold
their own, and both Fisher and Card
had opportunity to save by long
drives to touch.
The thriller of the match was Kirk
sey's seventy-five-yard run to a try,
after getting a ragged pass on the 33-
yard mark. A few jolts cleared his
path, and the play resolved itself into
a race.
St. Mary's three tries all broke in
the second half, and were made by
Moy, first five; Robertson, center
three, and Guisto, breakaway. Robert
son converted two goals out of three
attempts.
Fisher's change from the scrum to
fullback may be regarded as unfortu
nate. The backs of the Freshman team
played in sufficient slump to sell the
game in the second half.

Second Team Plays <>-<! Tie.
The Santa Clara second team, on
their home grounds, struggled to a
G-G tie with the second string Stanford
players. The game was a forward bat
tle, the ball appearing but seldom in
the backfield on either side.
The Blacks kept the ball in tn«
Santa Clara danger zone the greater
part of the first half, but were unable
to get over for tries, excepting on two
occasions. Both scores were registered
by Clark, who touched down after the
ball had been dribbled over the line for
the initial three points, and scored
the second try when McGilvray passed
to him after a forty-yard run. Neither
try was converted.
In the second half the red and white
jersied ruggers held the Cardinal play
ers from scoring and went over the
line for two tries themselves in the
closing minutes of the game. Both
attempts at goal-kicking were wild. In
each case the ruling of the .referee was
questioned, but the tries were allowed
to count.
