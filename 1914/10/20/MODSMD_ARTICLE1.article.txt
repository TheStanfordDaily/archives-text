The Eight Hundred Dollar Mystery,
promising to rival in thrills that mir
acle of movie mysteries, sky-rocketed
into the limelight this noon when a
peerade of one hundred and one fem
inists wound its way from the Quad to
Wilson's shop. With red badges flying
and headed by a scarlet and white
banner, on which was blazoned the slo
gan "The $SOO Mystery, or the 101st
Crusade," the long line trudged singing
along the Quad. At Wilson's, whence
'ill but the mysterious 101 had been ex
cluded, ensued a hilarious secret ses
sion, the .results of which will not be
divulged until this evening at the ral
ly of the Five Hundred, to be staged in
the Assembly Hall at 7:Bft.
For the first time in history the fem
inine contingent will occupy the main
floor in a body, and feminine yell
leaders from five hundred feminine
throats.
It is further promised that the Band
and Schubert Club will be out in force
for the occasion. Miss Marjorie Tis
dale, '15, president of the Women'.-*
Conference, will conduct the meeting.
The speakers of the evening are as fol
lows: Mrs. E. W. Allan, dean of wo
men: Mrs. T. P. Russell, of the Eng
lish Department: Miss Gladys La Fet
ra, '15. leader of the 101: Miss Eileen
Everett. '11. Y. W. C. A. secretary, and
Miss Margaret Locke. '15.
The whole Five Hundred is expected
to turn out for the rally at which the
feminine curiosity of those not al
ready in the secret will be satisfied.
Inasmuch as Ram's Head will hold
a rehearsal in the Assembly Hall this
evening the mystery thickens as to the
probable place of meeting of the elu
sive crusade.
