# Conference to Consider "Roughing" at Dances
## Action Will Be Taken Thursday Evening on Ruling Passed in February, 1913. 
### 
Definite action will be taken by the
University Conference next Thursday
evening regarding the status of
"roughing" at any of the University
dances. A ruling passed by the con
ference a year and a half ago pro
hibits "roughing" at all functions.
Numerous complaints of hoodlumism
prompted the governing body to take
such action. The minutes of the Uni
versity Conference of February 20,
1913, stated: "Moved, seconded, and
carried that 'roughing' at University
functions be absolutely prohibited, and
that the council be instructed to rigid
ly enforce the ruling."
The Conference brought up the sta
tus of "roughing* at its last meeting,
but, owing to lack of definite infor
mation, action was postponed. Opinion
is divided as to whether the ruling per
tains to campus affairs alone, or in
cludes Palo Alto dances as well.
Student Advisor A. W. Ambrose to
day expressed the opinion that the
Conference ruling refers to all dances,
including Palo Alto affairs. Ambrose
declares that, contrary to the Con
ference rule, "roughing" has again
been in evidence at campus dances.
Miss Marjorie Tisdale. '15, president
of the Women's Conference, today
said:
"I am in favor of enforcing every
Conference ruling, and if there is one
prohibiting 'roughing' at all dances, it
should certainly be enforced. 1 do not
know how true it is that certain soror
ities have refused to attend Palo Alto
dances, but if such is the case, 1 do
not blame them. The Women's Con
ference will not take action regarding
I the question of 'roughing.' "
