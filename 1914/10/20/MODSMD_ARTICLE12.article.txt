forces near Ostend under the protec
tion of the guns of the English fleet. If
the reports are true the Germans will
be menaced from the rear. Persons

and French fleets are strongest near
the French and Belgian sea coast
towns, and that an allied force, either
a naval brigade or an army detach
ment, could easily operate under the
guns of the fleet.

considers Dunkirk, oil the coast, safe,
because reinforcements have been
sent to that place and to the Belgians
along the Yser, on the Franco-Belgian
border, interest now centers on the
right. The Germans have renewed
their assaults on the Meuse line but
have been .repulsed at many points.

invasion of Alsace-Lorraine, with
Metz as the objective, is gaining form.

this afternoon announced that the al
lies had made material progress at
many points along the line. The Bel

and Dixmunde along the river Yser,
on the Belgian border, and are de
clared to be maintaining their posi
tions in face of the German assaults.

ly entrenched positions near Lille, fif
teen miles to the eastward, but there
is little change in that section. The
Germans have vainly endeavored to
check the French offensive on the
right bank of the Meuse, in eastern
France. The general situation is an
nounced as "eminently satisfactory"
for the allies.
