# Twenty-Five Hundred

### 
The first stakes are down, and the
knights of the pick and shovel are
cutting into Mother Earth, preparing
for the foundation of the new men's
gymnasium. The great rectangular
space for the building itself is marked,
but there is not the splinter of a stake
or blow of pick in the ground appor
tioned to the proposed swimming
tank. The delay in aquarium con
struction is not due to the bitter ra
cial prejudices of the contractors on
the job, no.r is it due to the slow turn
ing of the wheels in the architect's
office—it's much simpler to remedy
than either of these, for the question
is merely one of money.
Twenty-five hundred dollars, in
round figures, would be the cost of
constructing an open air plunge, thirty
by one hundred feet. The provision
made by the Hoard of Trustees for
possible additions to the gymnasium
allots sufficient space for the tank
close to the showers and dressing
rooms of the main building, the tank
being in reality an annex to the gym
nasium. Practically all of the expense
for the engineering work, and for
architects' plans, is eliminated by the
offer of instructors in the engineering
departments to donate their services.
The estimate of initial cost is made
with the understanding that construc
tion would parallel progress 011 the
building nearby—the opportunity to
secure swimming facilities is obvious
ly one to be grasped at once.
If the Executive Committee will
grant necessary funds for the swim
ming pool, the Board of Trustees can
be counted upon to make the slight
changes necessary in the filtration
plant that renders harmless the wa
ters of Searsville. Popular sentiment
would seem to be overwhelmingly in
favor of the big plunge of filtered
water—will the funds be voted from
the treasury of the Associated Stu
dents, or will it lie necessary to form
a swimming club to campaign for the
twenty-five hundred?
