A spirit of revery and fantasy lurks
in the following poem, "Viverols," by
Chancellor David Star.r Jordan. It is
less serious in tone but perhaps more
appealing than most of his verse. The
poem was first published in the Se
quoia for October, 189G:
Beyond the sea, 1 know not where,
There is a town called Viverols;
I know not if 'tis near o.r far,
I know not what its features are,
I only know 'tis Viverols.
I know not if its ancient walls
By vines and moss be overgrown;
I know not if the night owl calls
From feudal battlements of stone,
Inhabited by him alone.
Perhaps among the clouds it lies,
Mid vapors out from Dreamland blown,
Built up from vague remembrances,
That never yet had form in stone,
The castles built of clouds alone.
I only know, should you and I
Through its old walls of crumbling
stone
With moss and ivy overgrown
Together wander all alone,
No spot on earth would be more fair
Than ivy-covered Viverols;
No grass be greener anywhere,
No bluer sky nor softer air
Than we should find in Viverols,—
Together find in Viverols.
Love, we may wander far or near;
The sun shines bright o'er Viv
erols,
Green is the grass, the skies are clear;
No clouds obscure our pathway, dear.
Where love is, there is Viverols,
There is no other Viverols.
—David Starr Jordan.
