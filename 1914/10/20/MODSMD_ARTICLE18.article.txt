# Newer Culture Displays Quality of Acquisition

### 
Randolph S. Bourne has an article
011 "Our Cultural Humility" in the last
Atlantic Monthly that sets forth a new
idea of culture. In part, he says:
"It was Matthew Arnold, read and
reverenced by the generation imme
diately preceding our own, who set to
our eyes a definition and goal of cul
ture which has become the common
property of all our world. To know
the best that had been thought and
said, to appreciate the mater-wo.rks
which the previous civilization had
produced, to put our minds and appre
ciations in contact with one great of
all ages,—here was a clear ideal which
dissolved the mists in which the
vagueness of culture had been lost.
"And it was an ideal that appealed
with peculiar force to Americans. For
it was a democratic ideal, everyone
who had the energy and perseverance
could reasonably expect to acquire by
taking thought that orientation of soul
to which Arnold gave the magic name
of culture.
"And it was a quantitative ideal; cul
ture was ajnatter of acquisition—with
appreciation and prayerfulness per
haps, but still a matter of adding little
by little to one's store until one
should have a vision of that radiant
limit, when one knew all the best that
had been thought and said and pic
tured in the world."
