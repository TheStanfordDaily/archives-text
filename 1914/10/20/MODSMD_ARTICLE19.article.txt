Several years ago a project was set
on foot at. Stanford to erect a Union
building, and in furtherance of such a
laudable undertaking contributions
and pledges were made by alumni, fac
ulty, and students which resulted in a
sum, cash and promised, large enough
to assure the building. A large part
of this sum was secured from the stu
dents in fifty-dollar pledges, upon pay
ment of which they were entitled to
life membership in the Union. I hap
pened to be one of the many to sign
such a pledge and to work for the suc
cess of the good cause. Last semester,
therefore, T paid over to E. C. Rehrens
$35.00, which was by him, as an au

thorized collector, turned ill to Pro
fessor E. VV .Smith, who was at tho
head of the department of collections
for the Union. At the same time I re
quested a receipt for the sum, merely
as a matter of business principle. I
was told that the receipt would be
mailed to me in a day or so. But such
was not done. On four separate oc
casions after this, through E. C. lieli
rens, I renewed by request for a re
ceipt, received the promise that it
would be mailed in a day or Wo by
Mr. Smith, —and the semester ended
without the promise ever being ful
filled.
This summer I received a long let
ter from the Union requesting further
funds, and in reply wrote Mr. E. W.
Smith that I would be glad to forward
the remaining $15.00 due upon my
pledge as soon as he would mail me
the promised receipt for the $35,000
previously paid! Here then was an
opportunity to write out a receipt—
which would probably .require the
great period of twenty-five seconds
and the forced exertion of lifting a
fountain pen—and collect fifteen dol
lars for the Union. Surely if Funds
are so badly needed an energetic col
lector would not fail to grasp such an
opportunity as that merely because of
the obstacle of performing an act of
business courtesy, which should have
been done long before. Rut, as has
consistently been the case, I received
no answer, and concluded my money
was not needed after all.
As a last step, several weeks ago, T
again wrote and requested the receipt,
but have had no answer—as usual —
from Mr. Smith. My letters had .return
addresses upon them, so I know that
they reached their destination. Tired
of being ignored in this matter, I now
write you in the hopes that this may
catch the eyes of the proper authori
ties, who will see that at least ordin
ary commercial civility is extended to
the alumni, who are interested in Stan
ford institutions and are doing their
small share in furthering them, as I
am informed on good authority that
mine is not the only case to which lit
tle attention has been paid by the sec
retary. Very sincerely,
ALUMNUS.

fountain pen—and collect fifteen dol
lars for the Union. Surely if Funds
are so badly needed an energetic col
lector would not fail to grasp such an
opportunity as that merely because of
the obstacle of performing an act of
business courtesy, which should have
been done long before. Rut, as has
consistently been the case, I received
no answer, and concluded my money
was not needed after all.
As a last step, several weeks ago, T
again wrote and requested the receipt,

from Mr. Smith. My letters had .return
addresses upon them, so I know that
they reached their destination. Tired
of being ignored in this matter, I now
write you in the hopes that this may
catch the eyes of the proper authori
ties, who will see that at least ordin
ary commercial civility is extended to
the alumni, who are interested in Stan

small share in furthering them, as I
am informed on good authority that
mine is not the only case to which lit

Several years ago a project was set
on foot at. Stanford to erect a Union
building, and in furtherance of such a
laudable undertaking contributions
and pledges were made by alumni, fac
ulty, and students which resulted in a
sum, cash and promised, large enough
to assure the building. A large part
of this sum was secured from the stu
dents in fifty-dollar pledges, upon pay
ment of which they were entitled to
life membership in the Union. I hap
pened to be one of the many to sign
such a pledge and to work for the suc
cess of the good cause. Last semester,
therefore, T paid over to E. C. Rehrens
$35.00, which was by him, as an au

thorized collector, turned ill to Pro
fessor E. VV .Smith, who was at tho
head of the department of collections
for the Union. At the same time I re
quested a receipt for the sum, merely
as a matter of business principle. I
was told that the receipt would be
mailed to me in a day or so. But such
was not done. On four separate oc
casions after this, through E. C. lieli
rens, I renewed by request for a re
ceipt, received the promise that it
would be mailed in a day or Wo by
Mr. Smith, —and the semester ended
without the promise ever being ful
filled.
This summer I received a long let
ter from the Union requesting further
funds, and in reply wrote Mr. E. W.
Smith that I would be glad to forward
the remaining $15.00 due upon my
pledge as soon as he would mail me
the promised receipt for the $35,000
previously paid! Here then was an
opportunity to write out a receipt—
which would probably .require the
great period of twenty-five seconds
and the forced exertion of lifting a
fountain pen—and collect fifteen dol
lars for the Union. Surely if Funds
are so badly needed an energetic col
lector would not fail to grasp such an
opportunity as that merely because of
