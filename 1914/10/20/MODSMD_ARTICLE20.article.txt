# Team AA Wins Three-Inning Game.
## 
### 
A three-inning game played on the
Auxiliary diamond yesterday after
noon resulted in another victory for
the AA team over the A nine, the
score being 3-0. Crum's pitching was
greatly responsible for the fact that
the double letter organization took the
long end of the score. He held his op
ponents hitless, and fanned seven out
of ten men at bat.
