# RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS TABOO MILEAGE INCREASE
## Request of Espee to Raise Tariff for One-Way Bides in Alameda County Refused. 
### 
A request of the Southern Pacific
Company for an increase in commuta
tion rates between Alameda county
points and San Francisco, together
with an advance in one-way fares
within the city of Oakland and between
points in Alameda county, was denied
recently by the State Railroad Com
mission.
In connection with the opinion ren
dered the commission declared, how
ever, that the company should be re
quired in building future extensions to
grant the 10-cent rate or the $?. com
mutation rate to such added territory.
The Southern Pacific Company
asked for an increase of from 10 to
15 cents on the one-way rate between
certain points and from 5 to 10 cents
between other points, as well as an ad
vance over the present $3 commutation
rate to San Francisco.
