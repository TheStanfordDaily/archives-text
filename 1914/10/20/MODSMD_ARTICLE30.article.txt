# Conference Petitions For Modified Honor System
## Governing Body Formally Requests Faculty to Follow Course Previously Outlined. 
### 
Following the action taken by the
University Conference last Tuesday
evening, regarding installing the hon
or principle in the classes at Stan
ford, a petition has been drawn up by
the president of the Conference and
presented to the faculty.
The opinion of the Conference is
that there is not sufficient desire for
any one sort or honor system at Stan
ford to warrant its universal adoption
at the present time. The faculty are
requested, however, by the governing
body of student control to install the
personal honor principle in such
courses as they deem feasible. The fol
lowing petition was presented to the
faculty:
To the President and Members of the
Faculty of Leland Stanford Junior
University:
On October 13, 1914, the University
Conference formulated an expression
of sentiment in regard to the so
called "Honor System."
It was determined that it is not pos
sible at this time to recommend a
workable plan for the universal adop
tion of the Honor System throughout
the University. In view of this the
Conference voted to request respect
fully that individual instructors adopt
the personal honor principle in such
classes as in their judgment would
prove desirable. While the conference
did not attempt a further dfefinition of
this "principle," it was intended that
it should operate similarly to that now
used in Law and some English
courses, and should be put into effect
in classes of a composition some
what similar to these.
Respectfully submitted,
THE UNIVERSITY CONFERENCE.
Otis H. Castle, President.
