Sophomores at the University of
Pennsylvania locked forty freshmen in
corncribs of the college estate for half
a day.
Wasps were turned loose in the
cribs to give the freshmen "pep." The
latter escaped by knocking down the
sides of the cribs.
Several of the sophomores were ar
rested by municipal authorities, held
in jail for a time, and finally fined.
Later they were expelled from the
university.
