# J. D. GALLOWAY ADDRESSES ASSEMBLY OF ENGINEERS
## HYDRO-ELECTRICITY IS THEME OF EXPERT'S LECTURE Development of Power by Water from Mountains Is Well Illustrated 
### 
J. D. Galloway, an expert consult
ing engineer of San Francisco, spoke
at the assembly of engineering stu
dents this afternoon. The subject of
his talk was"The Development of
Hydro-electricity."
Mr. Galloway is a man who has had
great practical experience along this
line.
"A man should be grounded in the
things he learns at school," he said,
"so that he can say without hesita
tion whether it is possible to accomp
lish any particular work of engineer
ing or not. Although this is an age
of specialization in all professions, it
is necessary that the electrical engi
neer have some idea of the civil and
mechanical engineering, and vice
versa."
Mr. Galloway explained the method
of developing electricity by water
from the mountains, illustrating his
talk by some excellent stereoptican
views.
"1 have been chiefly interested in
construction in California," he said,
"and as the work in this state is repre
sentative of anything that has been
done along the line in any part of the
world, it will serve to illustrate.
Mr. Galloway then traced the wa
ter from the great storage reservoirs
in the mountains, through diverting
dams and conduits into the regulating
reservoirs, where the supply may be
governed according to the demand.
From here the final process was de
scribed, taking the water through
pipes to generators, and thence to
consumers.
