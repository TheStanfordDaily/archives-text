# Memorial Mosaic Work Is But Half Completed
## Difficulty in Procuring Material From Europe May Delay Progress of Signor Zampato. 
### 
The task of renovating the mosaics
on the Memorial Church is just half
completed. It has taken a few days
less than a year to reach this stage.
It is expected that, within a week, the
decoration on the exterior facade, will
be finished. This decoration, the Ser
mon on the Mount, is a very beautiful
and difficult piece of mosaic work, and
has required the utmost skill on the
part of the master worker, Lorenzo
Zampato, and his two assistants. The
interior decoration of the church, it is
estimated, will take at least a year for
completion,. and perhaps even more.
Difficulty in transporting the mosaics
from Italy to this country, on account
of the European war, is one factor that
may delay progress.
Mosaics are manufactured in on'y
one place in the world, Venice, Ita!y.
Several firms are engaged in their
manufacture, the one which is carry
ing on the renovation here at Stan
ford employing as many as forty men.
The tiny pieces of mosaic are finished
up and pasted on sheets of paper in
the European workshop of this firm.
They are then shipped to this country,
still in the large sheet, and numbered
as to design. Zampato maintains a
workshop in the basement of the ves
try, where these large sheets are laid
out and cut and trimmed. This lat
ter operation is seldom necessary, so
accurately is the artistry of the Ital
ian workmen.
Zampato takes these curiously
shaped sheets and plasters them, paper
side out, in their relative positions on
the stone wall of the church. This
stone must first be smoothed to a su
perlative degree by the master mason
who is one of Zapato's assistants. The
pasting operation completed, the finer
details are then in order, and the Ital
ian artist, with all his years of labor
produced skill, puts on the finishing
touches.
