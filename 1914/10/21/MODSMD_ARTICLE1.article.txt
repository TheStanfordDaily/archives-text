# MANAGER WILCOX PLANS A SECOND DRAWING FOR BIG GAME TICKETS
## ROOTERS' SEATS REMAIN Students Can Hand in Further Applications at the Campus Bookstore on Friday Afternoon 
### 
More tickets are available to Stan
ford students for Big Game seats and
a further drawing of orders received
will he made on Friday afternoon. The
surplus is due to the larger consign
ment of tickets that Graduate Manager
Wilcox has than in any previous year.
The addition of the new bleachers on
the south side of the California turf
has increased the seating capacity by
nearly one-fourth, and allows more
tickets to Manager Wilcox fo,r distri
bution to Stanford people than ever
before, even when the game has been
held at Stanford.
A representative of the Associated
Students will be in the Bookstore at
the Bank of Palo Alto window from
1:30 to 2:30. All students still desir
ing seats under the name of alumni,
ex-students or registered students
should make their application to him
at that time. A drawing w'ill be
made from all orders received imme
diately after 2:30. Application for
seats in the rooters' section can be
made at the same hour, and the two
drawings will take place together.
About one hundred tickets remain in
the rooters' section, and they are in the
finest part of the bleachers, for as
usual the rooters of the two universi
ties will occupy the portion of the
field on either side of the turf directly
opposite the center.
Though he expected only 7400 seats
for the game. Manager Wilcox's allot
ment is 7500, and the result is addi
tional scats in the Stanford rooting
ncclion. Besides these seats 2000 tick
et:* remair. for general section seats.
Every mail to the campus brings
orders to the graduate manager's of
fice from alumni and ex-students, and
the remaining tickets will be disposed
of long before the day of the game.
Bearing this in mind students desir
ing more tickets should not delay be
yond the season's second drawing on
Friday to hand in their applications.
Tickets in any of the Stanford sec
tions of the bleachers may be applied
for at the Bookstore between 1:30 and
2:30. No orders will be taken at the
graduate manager's office in the mean
time.
