# WOMEN ON CRUSADE TO RAISE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR FUND
## 
### 
The Eight Hundred Dollar Mystery
or 101st Crusade has now resolved
itself into a campaign for four hun
dred fifty dollars on the part of one
hundred and one women working for
the Y. W. C. A. The campaign was
ushered in yesterday noon with a pee
rade from the Quad to Wilson's, where
plans were discussed at the secret
gathering of the 101.
The Eight Hundred Dollar Mystery
was then divulged to the remaining
399 at a strictly feminine .rally, held
yesterday evening in the chapel. Al
though the hand and the flashlight
photographers, who were on the
ground to usher in the women's rally
with blare and flare, deserted at the
first, flicker of the Freshmen bonfire,
their presence was scarcely missed in
the enthusiasm of the women's gath
ering in the chapel.

The campaign thus inaugurated has
been planned to .raise the necessary
$800 to carry on the work of the Y. W.
C. A. at Stanford, and to augment the
Women's Conference Loan Fund.
This loan fund was recently estab
lished for the purpose of lending mon

unable to go to college. The money
thus lent is returned after graduation
by those borrowing it. This fund i3
at present entirely depleted, and, un
less money is tu.rned in at once, it may
be necessary for several women who
are depending on the fund for living
expenses to leave college.
The raising of the money has been
turned over to ten teams of ten women
each, the whole being under the lead
ership of Gladys La Fetra, '15. Three
hundred and fifty dollars was con
