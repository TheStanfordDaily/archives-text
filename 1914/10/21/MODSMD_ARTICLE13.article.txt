# Coup d'état
## 
### 
A match—that wasaal and the very
air is different today. If yesterday we
sensed the soft languorous breeze of In
dian Summer, today we breathe the
pungent snuff of Autumn with the
very shock of coming conflict in the
air. To our friendly rivals across the
Bay goes the credit, if eyewitnesses
are to be given credence.
The hand that struck the phosphor
tipped firestick against rough surface
did more than whirl the hungry flames
licking at the stars, accomplished
more than the mere demolition of the
Freshman py.re, half completed, for the
pre-game rugby rally. His hand fan
ned the .red coals of spirited partizan
ship into steady flame, loosed energy
that had been smothered, stifled for
months. The real thrill of intercolle
giate meeting pulses in every man, the
draught of the unexpected makes com
monplace grey glow to red.
November fourteenth is red letter
day in the Fall calendar —last night's
rally double-circled the '14' with lines
of determination.

College spirit is worth while if well
directed —danger lies in impulsive
action. Collegiate knights errant
should ever bear in mind the sharp
line of demarcation between good fun
and hoodlumism.

A cause that will not find empty
pockets, the campus rule, is the fund
for the relief of the destitute Fresh
men, out of cash and burdened with
work by reason of last night's coup
d'etat. The new woodpile should
grow amazingly.
