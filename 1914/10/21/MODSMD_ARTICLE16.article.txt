# Light of the East
## 
### 
Rudyard Kipling was born in Bom
bay, India, in 1864. His power of hu
man understanding and interpretation
brought him to the attention of the
English reading world, and he has
earned the name of "Light of the
East." The following are among his
more recent lines:
If you can keep your head when all
about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on
you;
If you can trust yourself when all men
doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubt
ing too:
If you can wait and not be tired by
waiting,
Or being lied about, don't deal in
lies,
Or being hated don't give way to hat
ing,
And yet don't look too good, or talk
too wise;
If you can dream —and not make
dreams your master;
If you can think —and not make
thoughts your aim,
If you can meet with Triumph and Dis
aster
And treat those two imposters just
the same:
If you can bear to hear the truth
you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap
for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life
to, broken,
And stoop and build 'em up with
worn-out tools;
If you can make one heap of all your
winnings
And risk it at one turn of pitch-and
toss,
And lose, and start again at your be
ginnings
And never breathe a word about your
loss:
If you can force your heart and nerve
and sinew
To serve your turn long after they
are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing
in you
Except the Will which says to them:
"Hold on!"
If you can talk with crowds and keep
your virtue,
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the
common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can
hurt you,
Tf all men count with you, but none
too much:
Tf you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds worth of distance
run,
Yours is the Earth and everything
that's in it.
And—which is mo,re —you'll be a Man,
my son!
