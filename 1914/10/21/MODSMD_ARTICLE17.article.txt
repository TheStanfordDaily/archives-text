To the Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
A word from me is perhaps desir
able in connection with the communi
cation from an incensed subscriber to
the Stanford Union in your issue of
last night. Silence might be inter
preted as a more disastrous confession
than the undefended admission of the
truth of his charges, which T have to
make. Moreover, emphasis ought to
be laid upon the truth of the assump
tion he makes —that the fault he com
plains of is wholly my own, and is
not typical of the other officers of the
Union.
As an indication that the situation
even in my own department is not
quite so bad as might be inferred from
his communication, T may be permit
ted to remark that as soon as my eye
caught the item, before T read it,1
knew its contents and its author—
which indicates that your correspond
ent's predicament is at least not gen

eral among the subscribers.
However, I have 110 desire to seem t.'>
excuse myself in a single case of the
sort. I merely want to make sure that
the blame comes on me alone. There
is no excuse, of course. There is,
equally, of course, an explanation, in
volving an endeavor to do some work
on a vacation trip and an unsent letter,
but it is all aside from the point. The
subscriber, merely as a matter of busi
ness principle,, as he says, ought to
have received the official receipt, and
he did not.
