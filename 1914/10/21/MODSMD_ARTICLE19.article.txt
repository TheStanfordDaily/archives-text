Paris, Oct. 21.â€”Despite the desper
ate fighting in the north, the feeling is
growing that the real German objective
is not the line just east of Dunkirk.
However, it is expected that attempts
to take that city will proceed and it is
admitted that the Germans are rein
forcing at that part of the line. Head
quarters say that the German general
staff must realize that von Boehm and
von Kluk, 011 their right, cannot pene
trate the allied lines. The Teutons
are developing a new offensive move
ment at Verdun.
