# TRAINING TABLE LIFE PICTURED BY MALONEY
## FOOTBALL EDUCATION AND GOOD TIMES INTERMINGLE. Wholesome and Carefully Chosen Menu Makes for Good Condition of Varsity Ruggers. 
### 
With the completion of the fresh
men season and the cuts made in the
varsity squad, the interest of the foot
ball dopeste.rs centers in the remain
ing likely candidates for Big Game
honors. Trainer Harry Maloney, who
has acquired an enviable reputation
as a conditioner of Stanford teams,
presents some interesting information
concerning the training table, as to
the life of the men and the menu, in
an interview today.
"The object in feeding the men at
the training table is to give them as
balanced a diet as possible, or in
othe.r words a mixed diet, containing
the four elements necessary to proper
nourishment of the body. In the mat
ter of vegetables, desserts and soups.
Manager Shaw and I endeavor to
change the menu as much as possible
so as to keep the fellows in surprise
as to what they are going to get to
eat.
"The breakfast consists of some
form of cooked fruit, such as pre
served peaches or apple sauce, fol
lowed by eggs, usually in omelet form
with crisp bacon. The early repast is
concluded with whole wheat muffins
and toast, and either a cup of coffee
or cocoa.
"Lunch is of a very simple nature.
The boys are first served with some
form of broth such as barley or beef.
The main part of the meal is made
up of a cold meat, usually roast beef,
or lamb, with jelly, one baked potato,
and a fresh vegetable, today carrots
being given their turn. The desserts
are generally a pudding, such as tapi
oca, custard, or rice, with some harm
less cookies. The usual time of 12:30
has been set for lunch.
"Owing to the distance away from
the football field, and the hard prac
tice just experienced, dinner, the
heaviest meal, is not served until a
quarter to seven. The meal com
mences with a salad, usually of the
combination fruit variety. The meat
is either hot or cold roasts of beef,
lamb or veal, or else chops. Only
following a game are the fellows giv
en steaks. Baked potatoes again are
the rule, Irish and sweet variety being
alternated. A vegetable creamed on
toast, such as asparagus, completes
the second course. Toast is supplied
in plenty at all meals. Dessert con
sists of some wholesome cooked fruit;
tonight, for instance, prunes stuffed
with walnuts. Small black closes the
meal.
"The spirit of the men on the train
ing table and the general attitude they
display is wonderful. They show a
remarkable consciousness in the way
they go about their work. Each fel
low realizes that he is but a part of
a machine, and he may he depended
upon to do nothing whatsoever which
will prevent the team from accomp
lishing what they are after.
"After eleven o'clock all the boys
must be in bed. TTp to eight-thirty the
men may play around the piano or
whatever they desire, but after that
time every one must be at work study
ing. Seven o'clock is the hour set for
arising. A quartet composed of "Tiny"
Wines. "Andy" Andrews, "Oft" Lach
mund and "Jumho" Blase has been
the source of much worry.
"At the dinner table football is spoken
of in a ceneral way from the stand
point. of information. The Big Oame
is never mentioned."

"The spirit of the men on the train

With the completion of the fresh

varsity squad, the interest of the foot

honors. Trainer Harry Maloney, who
has acquired an enviable reputation
as a conditioner of Stanford teams,
presents some interesting information
concerning the training table, as to
the life of the men and the menu, in
an interview today.
"The object in feeding the men at
the training table is to give them as
balanced a diet as possible, or in
othe.r words a mixed diet, containing
the four elements necessary to proper
nourishment of the body. In the mat
ter of vegetables, desserts and soups.
Manager Shaw and I endeavor to
change the menu as much as possible
so as to keep the fellows in surprise
as to what they are going to get to
eat.
"The breakfast consists of some
form of cooked fruit, such as pre
served peaches or apple sauce, fol
lowed by eggs, usually in omelet form
with crisp bacon. The early repast is
concluded with whole wheat muffins
and toast, and either a cup of coffee
or cocoa.
"Lunch is of a very simple nature.
The boys are first served with some
form of broth such as barley or beef.
The main part of the meal is made
up of a cold meat, usually roast beef,
or lamb, with jelly, one baked potato,
and a fresh vegetable, today carrots
being given their turn. The desserts
are generally a pudding, such as tapi
oca, custard, or rice, with some harm
less cookies. The usual time of 12:30
has been set for lunch.
"Owing to the distance away from
the football field, and the hard prac
tice just experienced, dinner, the
heaviest meal, is not served until a
quarter to seven. The meal com
mences with a salad, usually of the
combination fruit variety. The meat
is either hot or cold roasts of beef,
lamb or veal, or else chops. Only
