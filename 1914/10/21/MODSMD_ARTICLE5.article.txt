# Work on Big Bonfire Resumed by Freshman
## Committee Will Receive Funds From the Students to Provide New Fuel for Pyre. 
### 
A bigger and better bonfire will re
place the one kindled last night by the
good Samaritan who applied the gas
oline torch. Payment for the struc
ture will be made by joint subscription
from members of the student body.
President A. E. Worthy has named a
committee of twenty-two men who will
receive contributions.
Donations will be voluntary. The
committee will not canvass for funds,
and has been appointed merely in
order that all members of the commu
nity will have a convenient opportunity
to subscribe.
The new pyre is now in course of
construction, and Freshmen have been
assigned to guard duty, which will be
in force from now until the night of
the .rally. The large corner posts of
the big woodpile were not destroyed in
the blaze last night, and will be used
as a framework.
Forage parties are now raking the
estate for available timbers. Farm Su
perintendent Hewston has offered nu
merous boxes and odds and ends of
wood waste.
The following are the members of
the committee which has been appoint
ed to accept donations for the rebuild
