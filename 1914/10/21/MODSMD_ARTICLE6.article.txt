# SCHOOL CHILDREN TO BE RUGBY GUESTS NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
Corresponding to the entertainment
fo,r the school children of San Fran
cisco and Oakland at California Field
next week. Graduate Manager Wilcox
will stage a rugby picnic here on Sat
urday, October thirty-first, to which
all grammar school children of this
end of the bay are invited.
In the interval between the Varsity-
Alumni game and the second Varsity-
Titan game, rugby teams from Palo
Alto grammar and the Manzanita low
e.r school will contest on the turf. Sup
ported by cohorts of loyal rooters from
their respective schools, the little fel
lows will exemplify the development of
rugby in junior America.
The importance of these juvenile
contests cannot be overlooked. The
ability of the Australian ruggers is
credited to the fact that they are
practically raised in a rugby atmos
phere, playing it and seeing it from
boyhood on.
