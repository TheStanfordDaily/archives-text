# PRACTICE SCRIMMAGE IS MOST SPIRITED OF SEASON
## 
### 
The few spectators at the scrimmage
yesterday afternoon between the Var
sity Grays and Rlacks were treated to
the best slashing practice of the sea
son.
Five tries were totaled by the first
division, and their opponents failed
to cross the line, but tense moments
were so numerous that they formed
a continuous thrill.
Work in the pack was uniformly
good, and the ball took numerous ex
cursions along the entire line of both
backfields. Speed and fight were the
outstanding attractions of the match.
Coach Drown kept his men ham
mering during the best part of fifty
minutes, and made experiments in
baekfleld changes.
