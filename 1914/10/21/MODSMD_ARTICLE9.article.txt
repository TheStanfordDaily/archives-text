# DARING INCENDIARIES FAN SMOULDERING PEP OF CARDINAL ROOTERS
## Vengeful Students Pledge Loyalty to Team at Training House After Serpentine in Bonfire's Glare 
### 
Kindled by the premature flames of
the Freshmen bonfire, the long smoul
dering spirit of the Stanford student
body blazed last night into a wild and
enthusiastic rally before the steps of
the Phi Gamma Delta house, the loca
tion of the Varsity training table. The
anger caused by the predatory action
of incendiaries, combined with the
pent-up ardor backing the Cardinal
Varsity for a victory November 14,
incited the greatest outburst of feel
ing that has been exhibited on the
campus this fall.
A few minutes before eight o'clock,
six fire-bugs stepped out of a powerful
machine with gallon cans of kerosene
and torches. After pouring the oil up
on all four corners of the Freshmen's
semi-erected Pyre of the Berkeley
Bear, they set fire to the structure
and dashed away. Previous to their
departure they gave the well-known
"Oski-wow-wow" yell, and sent a num
ber of revolver shots into the early
evening air.
The Encina men, perceiving the
flames from the Hall, quickly aroused
the remainder of the campus, and with
them gathered about the burning bon
fire.
Hose was connected to the nearby
hydrants, but, as the flames were al
ready well under way, only a small
portion of the material for the fire
was saved. Turning their chagrin to
a rally, the several hundred students,
who by this time had, gathered about
the blaze, led by Yell Leaders Nixon
and Goodman, and the Stanford Band,
serpentined around the conflagra
tion.
At the suggestion of Coach Camp
bell, the surging throng swept up
Lasuen street singing "Come Join
the Band." Eleven hundred spirited
students swarmed the entire width of
the road and sidewalks, stretching in
length between the Bookstore and
Postoffice. Every house on the cam
pus was empty and deserted. Not even
the dryest dry was at home, but could
be found wildly shrieking with the
rest.
The aroused students en niasse
marched farther up the Row singing
Cardinal airs. By the time the ral
lying men had reached the Phi Gamma
Delta house the great majority of the
members of the training table had fled.
Persistent calls and yells, however,
brought Coach Floyd Brown to the
balcony, above the heads of the shout
ing rooters.

Like a veritable skyrocket in their
midst, the coach began, "It's a shame
the way the fellows have been getting
behind the team thus far during the
season. We've got a tough proposi
tion on our hands on next November
14. It will take the hardest kind of
a fight to win that game. Every man
at Berkeley is heart and soul for the
California Varsity and has been out
at all games. Now, back the team
from now on until the day of the Big
Game, and show that you want them
to win. You've got to do this much if
you expect to beat California."
Captain "Deke" Gard. smiling at the
ovation accorded him, spoke next. "It
will be one continual fight to win the
Big Game, and the bleachers must
support the men in the field. Tonight
is the first sign of 'pep' yet displayed
by the fellows. If you gents get be
hind the team, we'll do the work."
Traine.r Maloney was called to the
balcony following Gard, and earnestly
said: "More men have come out for
football this season than ever before.
One thing, however, has been absent
—that is spirit,—that something which
leaves itself wherever Stanford men
may be. We have had our troubles
with injuries, but they are nearly over.
Each and every one ought faithful
ly to back his team. I promise equal
ly as faithfully that you will not be
disappointed in your fifteen on No
vember 14."
"Jumbo" Blase, after much persua
sion. managed to say, "It certainly
seems great to see all this spirit." Jim
Wylie, in a good-natured manner, add
ed, "If you will stick to us, then we'll
come through all right." Joe Braden,
when forced out upon the orator's
platform, concurred with the other
speakers, and hastily retired.
Art Erb also voiced these senti
ments when his team mates forced him
out before the crowd.
Joe Urban, the last man on the
training table to speak, said: "The
team feels as though California has
put a stick on our shoulder. If you
gents feel like this on November 14,
it will be a sad day for California."
At the conclusion of the speeches,
Track Coach Campbell and Yell Lead
er Nixon urged the men to root hard
at all the games, and support the team
from now until the Big Game is over.
The singing of "Hail, Stanford. Hail"
and a rousing "Varsity" concluded the
evening's rally.

Big Game, and the bleachers must
support the men in the field. Tonight
is the first sign of 'pep' yet displayed
by the fellows. If you gents get be
hind the team, we'll do the work."
Traine.r Maloney was called to the
balcony following Gard, and earnestly
said: "More men have come out for
football this season than ever before.
One thing, however, has been absent
—that is spirit,—that something which
leaves itself wherever Stanford men
may be. We have had our troubles
with injuries, but they are nearly over.
Each and every one ought faithful
ly to back his team. I promise equal
ly as faithfully that you will not be
disappointed in your fifteen on No
vember 14."
"Jumbo" Blase, after much persua
sion. managed to say, "It certainly
seems great to see all this spirit." Jim
Wylie, in a good-natured manner, add
ed, "If you will stick to us, then we'll
come through all right." Joe Braden,
when forced out upon the orator's
platform, concurred with the other
speakers, and hastily retired.
Art Erb also voiced these senti
ments when his team mates forced him
out before the crowd.
Joe Urban, the last man on the
training table to speak, said: "The
team feels as though California has
put a stick on our shoulder. If you
gents feel like this on November 14,
it will be a sad day for California."
At the conclusion of the speeches,
Track Coach Campbell and Yell Lead
er Nixon urged the men to root hard
at all the games, and support the team
from now until the Big Game is over.
The singing of "Hail, Stanford. Hail"
and a rousing "Varsity" concluded the
evening's rally.
Kindled by the premature flames of
the Freshmen bonfire, the long smoul
dering spirit of the Stanford student
body blazed last night into a wild and
enthusiastic rally before the steps of
the Phi Gamma Delta house, the loca
tion of the Varsity training table. The
anger caused by the predatory action
of incendiaries, combined with the
pent-up ardor backing the Cardinal
Varsity for a victory November 14,
incited the greatest outburst of feel
ing that has been exhibited on the
campus this fall.
A few minutes before eight o'clock,
six fire-bugs stepped out of a powerful
machine with gallon cans of kerosene
and torches. After pouring the oil up
on all four corners of the Freshmen's
semi-erected Pyre of the Berkeley
Bear, they set fire to the structure
and dashed away. Previous to their
departure they gave the well-known
"Oski-wow-wow" yell, and sent a num
ber of revolver shots into the early
evening air.
The Encina men, perceiving the
flames from the Hall, quickly aroused
the remainder of the campus, and with
them gathered about the burning bon
fire.
Hose was connected to the nearby
hydrants, but, as the flames were al
ready well under way, only a small
portion of the material for the fire
was saved. Turning their chagrin to
a rally, the several hundred students,
who by this time had, gathered about
the blaze, led by Yell Leaders Nixon
and Goodman, and the Stanford Band,
serpentined around the conflagra
tion.
At the suggestion of Coach Camp
bell, the surging throng swept up
Lasuen street singing "Come Join
the Band." Eleven hundred spirited
students swarmed the entire width of
the road and sidewalks, stretching in
length between the Bookstore and
Postoffice. Every house on the cam
pus was empty and deserted. Not even
the dryest dry was at home, but could
be found wildly shrieking with the
rest.
The aroused students en niasse
marched farther up the Row singing
Cardinal airs. By the time the ral
lying men had reached the Phi Gamma
Delta house the great majority of the
members of the training table had fled.
Persistent calls and yells, however,
brought Coach Floyd Brown to the
balcony, above the heads of the shout
ing rooters.

Like a veritable skyrocket in their
midst, the coach began, "It's a shame
the way the fellows have been getting
behind the team thus far during the
season. We've got a tough proposi
tion on our hands on next November
14. It will take the hardest kind of
a fight to win that game. Every man
at Berkeley is heart and soul for the
California Varsity and has been out
at all games. Now, back the team
from now on until the day of the Big
Game, and show that you want them
to win. You've got to do this much if
you expect to beat California."
Captain "Deke" Gard. smiling at the
ovation accorded him, spoke next. "It
will be one continual fight to win the

who by this time had, gathered about
the blaze, led by Yell Leaders Nixon
and Goodman, and the Stanford Band,
serpentined around the conflagra
tion.
At the suggestion of Coach Camp
bell, the surging throng swept up
Lasuen street singing "Come Join
the Band." Eleven hundred spirited
students swarmed the entire width of
the road and sidewalks, stretching in
length between the Bookstore and
Postoffice. Every house on the cam
pus was empty and deserted. Not even
the dryest dry was at home, but could
be found wildly shrieking with the
rest.
The aroused students en niasse
marched farther up the Row singing
Cardinal airs. By the time the ral
lying men had reached the Phi Gamma
Delta house the great majority of the
members of the training table had fled.
Persistent calls and yells, however,
brought Coach Floyd Brown to the
balcony, above the heads of the shout
ing rooters.

Like a veritable skyrocket in their
midst, the coach began, "It's a shame
the way the fellows have been getting
behind the team thus far during the
season. We've got a tough proposi
tion on our hands on next November
14. It will take the hardest kind of
a fight to win that game. Every man
at Berkeley is heart and soul for the
California Varsity and has been out
at all games. Now, back the team
from now on until the day of the Big
Game, and show that you want them
to win. You've got to do this much if
you expect to beat California."
Captain "Deke" Gard. smiling at the
ovation accorded him, spoke next. "It
will be one continual fight to win the
Big Game, and the bleachers must
support the men in the field. Tonight
is the first sign of 'pep' yet displayed
by the fellows. If you gents get be
hind the team, we'll do the work."
Traine.r Maloney was called to the
balcony following Gard, and earnestly
said: "More men have come out for
football this season than ever before.
One thing, however, has been absent
—that is spirit,—that something which
leaves itself wherever Stanford men
may be. We have had our troubles
with injuries, but they are nearly over.
Each and every one ought faithful
ly to back his team. I promise equal
ly as faithfully that you will not be
disappointed in your fifteen on No
vember 14."
"Jumbo" Blase, after much persua
sion. managed to say, "It certainly
seems great to see all this spirit." Jim
Wylie, in a good-natured manner, add
ed, "If you will stick to us, then we'll
come through all right." Joe Braden,
when forced out upon the orator's
platform, concurred with the other
speakers, and hastily retired.
Art Erb also voiced these senti
ments when his team mates forced him
out before the crowd.
Joe Urban, the last man on the
training table to speak, said: "The
team feels as though California has
put a stick on our shoulder. If you
gents feel like this on November 14,
it will be a sad day for California."
At the conclusion of the speeches,
Track Coach Campbell and Yell Lead
er Nixon urged the men to root hard
at all the games, and support the team
from now until the Big Game is over.
The singing of "Hail, Stanford. Hail"
and a rousing "Varsity" concluded the
evening's rally.
