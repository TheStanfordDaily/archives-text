Tuxedo—the Most
Enjoyable and the Most
Healthful Smoke
HPHE most enjoyable smoke is a
-■-pipe. But many men deny them
selves this pleasure because they
have had unhappy experiences with
pipe tobaccos.
Likely you have paid 35 cents to
50 cents for a tin of "fancy mix
ture," and it burned your mouth or
throat, or was unpleasantly strong.
Too bad —but you got the wrong
tobacco. The hundreds of thou
sands of men who have tried
The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
have found the answer to their
smoke problems. Tuxedo is the
mildest tobacco made. It cannot
bite the tongue or dry the throat.
You can't get any better tobacco
because nothing better grows than
the mellow, perfectly aged Burley
leaf used in Tuxedo.
If you try Tuxedo for a month
and cut out other smokes, you will
not only have had the best month of
smoking you have ever had in your
life, but you will have made a mighty
big saving in your pocket money!

smoke problems. Tuxedo is the
mildest tobacco made. It cannot
bite the tongue or dry the throat.
You can't get any better tobacco
because nothing better grows than
the mellow, perfectly aged Burley
leaf used in Tuxedo.
If you try Tuxedo for a month
and cut out other smokes, you will
not only have had the best month of
smoking you have ever had in your
life, but you will have made a mighty
big saving in your pocket money!
