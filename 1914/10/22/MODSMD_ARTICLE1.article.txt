# LARGE SWIMMING TANK MAY BE CONSTRUCTED
## Executive Committee Instructs Manager Wilcox to Get Information About Probable Cost SITE NEAR NEW GYMNASIUM Eighteen Freshmen Who Played Against St. Mary's Are Awarded Block Numerals 
### 
First steps toward the securing of
a new out-door plunge for the men of
the University were taken at last
night's meeting of the Executive Com
mittee. To this end Graduate Man
ager Wilcox was instructed to obtain
information about the proper size and
the approximate cost from the Univer
sity of California, where such a tank
is situated, and from other sources.
The graduate manager was also in
structed to communicate with Vander
lynn Stow, treasurer of the Board of
Trustees, in regard to doubling the
size of the filtration plant, which will
be erected for gymnasium use. This
will be necessary to take care of the
Searsville water, and make it suitable
for bathing.
The position of the swimming tank
will be in close proximity to the new
men's gymnasium. The approximate
size of this last addition to athletic
equipment will be about thirty by
one hundred feet. Sufficient space
has already been assigned by the
Boai'd of Trustees to locate a tank
of this size near the gymnasium, so
that in reality it will become an an
nex of that structure.
It has been estimated by local en
gineers that the cost of the tank will
be twenty-five hundred dollars. The
offer of instructors in the engineering
departments to donate thei.r services,
with regard to engineering plans and
architect's work, will lower this sum
to a certain extent.
"Watch the yell-leader's arms when
singing 'Hail, Stanford, Hail,'" was
the recommendation of the Executive
Committee to the students. It is de
sired that the selection be sung as a
hymn, and it is requested that a hap
py medium be struck between the
rapid style in which it has been sung
this year and the funereal man
ner in which it has been sung
previously. The yell-leade.rs have se
lected the rate at which they want
the hymn sting, and it is only neces
sary to follow them in order to get
the full musical worth from the selec
tion.
Block "18's" were granted to the
freshmen who played in the final
game against St. Mary's College of
Oakland, last Saturday. Two inter
esting features of this award are, that
just eighteen men received the covet
ed numerals and that two varsity
"S" men, Stafford and Bihlman, and
a member of this year's varsity football
squad, Wylie. are included. The
following men were awarded their
numerals: O. H. Bihlman. W. FT.

Discussion was held on the subject
of the Big Came referee, and several
names were considered, but no defi
nite action was taken. This matter
will be settled in the near future as
far as deciding who the Stanford fa
vorites for the important post are.
No decision was .reached about giv
ing financial assistance to Cap and
Gown in publishing a song book. The
woman's honor society is planning to
produce a volume, containing not only
the many old Stanford songs, but also
the new bleacher songs which have
been composed this year.
