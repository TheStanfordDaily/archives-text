Editor The Daily Palo Alto:
This is to protest against the petty
thievery that is so prevalent on the
Quad this semester. The lawless dis
regard of property rights has reached
a point where some vigorous action
must be taken either by the University
authorities or by the Student Body,
and I greatly prefer that the initiative
be taken by the students.
It seems a shame that a student can
not leave his books lying on a window
sill on the Quad for a few minutes
without having some petty larceny
crook purloin them. I suppose it must
be comparatively easy for a sneak
thief to associate with his class
mates, worm himself into their confi
dence, and then the minute their backs
are turned to pounce upon some text
books. But isn't it a contemptable
thing to do? What a low degree of
moral development is thus displayed!
Such expertness in "shop lifting" could
be expected—perhaps—in a grammar
school child, but speaks ill for the pro
ficiency of a college crook. We have
no room at Stanford for such defec
tives; the state provides an institution
where the mentally deficient can
amuse themselves at trades, that, at
ther places, are considered criminal.
The Librarian is also complaining, I
understand, of students taking books
and failing to return them. Think of
such a mean, contemptible thing as
stealing from the bounty of those who
provide us with a place and means of
obtaining an education —surely they
are moral Such creatures
of selfishness are deserving of no sym
pathy, but have an absolute right to be
ostracized from decent society.
1 have lost no books so far, but in
the interest of those who have suf
fered, and to prevent others losing

property, I hope you will see fit to de
vote space in your columns to
this much-needed reform. Why not
have a detective see if he cannot dis
suade our friends—the enemy—by hav
ing a few sent up for, say ninety days.
