### 
San Francisco theatres offer a di
versified list of attractions this week
end. Comedy, drama, musical come
dy and vaudeville are included in the
program of amusements awaiting the
visitors from the campus.
George Arliss is presenting his mar
velous characterization of "Disraeli"
at the Columbia. Louis N. Parker has
provided this brilliant actor with one
of the most interesting dramas of the
day, and the San F.rancisco engage
ment is drawing capacity houses.
Performances are given every evening
except Sunday, and the regular Satur
day matinee is announced.
"Kitty MacKay" is in the last week
of her merry visit at the Cort, where
the engagement will come to a close
after the Saturday matinee and even
ing performance. This clever Scotch
comedy is pronounced a worthy suc
cessor to "Bunty Pulls the Strings."
The much-heralded Drury Lane pro
duction of "The Whip" is billed to
open on Sunday evening at the Cort.
This master melodrama has a record
of exceptional success in both London
and New York
"The Governor's Lady," David Be
lasco's great American play, is the in
teresting offering of the Alcazar Play
ers this week. Florence Malone, the
new leading woman of the stock com
pany, is making her San Francisco
debut in this production. Tt also
marks the return of Louis Bennison,
a former Alcazar favorite. Regular
matinees are scheduled for both Sat
urday and Sunday afternoons, and the
final performance will be giveu Sun
day evening.
"The Rollicking Girl" continues to
attract large audiences to the Gaiety,
where the Kolb and Dill forces are ap
pearing to advantage. Dill has been
out of the cast since the opening night,
when he sprained his ankle, and his
role is being taken by Bobby Vernon.
Matinees are given both Saturdaw and
Sunday.
