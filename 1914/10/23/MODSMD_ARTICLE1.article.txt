# CONFERENCE AMENDS "ROUGHING" RULING FOR CAMPUS DANCES
## Representatives Pass Resolution Regarding Stanford Hymn. Advise Adopting the Retards of the Original Manuscript TIME CHOSEN IS SLOWER 
### 
The rule regarding "roughing" on
the campus was reiterated last night
by the University Conference, and an
amendment to the original motion was
passed to this effect. The amendment
limits the roughing rule to campus
dances. The principle adopted last
night will be strictly enforced during
the present year.
In regard to "roughing" at the
dances in Palo Alto, particularly at
the Armory, the general power of the
conference to deal with an unseemly
conduct on the part of students will be
strictly enforced, though no definite
rule prohibiting "roughing" there was
passed. As long as the acts of the
spectators in Palo Alto dances do not
become obnoxious, no further action
will be taken.
In answer to a request of the Exec
utive Committee, a resolution was
passed last night expressing the opin
ion of the Conference in regard to the
proper manner of singing "Hail, Stan
ford, Hail." The resolution advises
that the Stanford hymn be sung after
the manner of the original manuscript
in regard to pauses, but a little slow
er in time. The discussion of the song
occupied the greater part of the even
ing for the governing body, and the
resolution was only passed after care
ful consideration. During the discus
sion on the subject, the different meth
ods of singing the song were demon
strated to the conference by members
of the Glee Club. The resolution was
parsed immediately following the try
outs.
The control of the yell leaders, who
will have charge of the singing, rests
in the hands of the Rxrcutive Commit
tee. That body declared itself to be
in favor of the manner in which the
song has been sung in recent years in
regard to pauses. This differs mate
rially from the retards of the original
manuscript. The ruling of the Exec
utive Committee will he in effect un
less further action is taken following
the action of the Conference last
nignt.
