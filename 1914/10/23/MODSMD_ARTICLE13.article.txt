# Accent Fortissimo

### 
Shades of Jean de Reszke and a
musical past! If this were not Stan
ford, then it would be a conservatory
of harmony and sometimes discord,
with all the energies bent on the dis
putation of technical terms and the
merits and demerits of retards, tempo,
pianissimo, and fortissimo. And all
on the proper singing of our Universi
ty Hymn, which through the years of
abuse and the influence of over
zealous songsters has been sadly
warped from the marks of the original
manuscript.
After the practice of years had
slowed the once stirring hymn into
painful largo, the force of public
opinion overturned the metronome
long set at "funereal," and the pendu
lum in quick response jumped to the
snappy beat of a syncopated rhythm.
One-step held full sway—then came
the reaction. Now is the unhappy
period of mediation, and the three yell
leaders tread the dangerous path
along the top rail of the fence.
Mount with them and use modera
tion as a balance stick. In even time
the rope is a broadwalk —out of step
a fall is certain. Watch the leader
and accent fortissimo!
