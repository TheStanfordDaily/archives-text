# Ostend

### 
Today's verse by William Lyle
Bowles portrays the city of Ostend,
Belgium, as it was in peace 125 years
ago, quite a contrast to its present
condition in the very heart of strife.
Bowles, a native of England, lived
from 1762-1850, and was a sonneteer
of note:
How sweet the tuneful bells respon
sive peal
As when at opening morn, the fra
grant breeze
Breathes on the trembling sense of
pale disease,
So piercing to my heart their force
I feel!
And hark! with lessening cadence now
they fall!
And now along the white and level
tide.
They fling their melancholy music
wide;
Bidding me a tender thought recall
Of summer-days, and those delightful
years
When from an ancient tower in life's
fair prime,
The mournful magic of their mingling
chime
First waked my wondering childhood
into tears!
But seeming now, when all those days
are o'er,
The sounds of joy once heard and
heard no more.
â€”William Lyle Bowles.
