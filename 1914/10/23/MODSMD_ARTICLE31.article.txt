# STANFORD TO HELP IN BELGIAN RELIEF WORK
## HOOVER HEADS COMMISSION TO AID VICTIMS. Local Y. M. C. A. Will Have Charge of Campus Campaign for Cast-Off Garments. 
### 
An appeal has come to the students
of Stanford for their co-operation in
the .relief of the war-stricken Belgians
by the donation of old clothing, from
both men and women. Clothing will be
gathered together from all parts of the
campus, and the women of the Univer
sity have offered their services to re
pair all garments. Numerous sewing
bees are planned for this work.
Clothes, especially winter garments,
are needed. Contributions of cast-off
garments are being taken throughout
the United States.
It was urged that an immediate re
sponse be made to this appeal by the
committee of men and women, and
that donations be made Friday ami
Saturday. P. P. Clove.r, '14, has charge
of the collection of clothing from the
men on the Row. All garments are to
be left at the Delta Kappa Epsilon
house. W. C. Anspach, '17, is directing
the collection in Encina and asks thai
all clothes be left in room 40. The Y.
M. C. A. rooms have also been desig
nated as a station where clothing is to
be collected. The committee of women
have made their headquarters at the
Women's Rest Room, in the English
Building.
The distribution of this clothing will
be in the hands of the Red Cross So
ciety, who will send a supply ship to
Belgium about Christmas time.
H. C. Hoover, '95, Stanford trustee,
known as the "Father of the Stanford
Union," has been placed at the head
of an American commission to aid
the famine-threatened Belgians. More
than $1,250,000 will be placed at
Hoover's disposal, with which to feed
and care for the famine victims. Five
hundred thousand were given him as a
first installment toward the fund from
the various American relief sources.
The Belgian situation was fast be
coming desperate, when Ambassador
Walter H. Page offered the chair of
the relief committee to Hoover. Amer
ica's representative in Belgium, Brand
Whitlock, states that the food supply
problem is becoming critical. Belgium
imports 00 per cent of the food supply
which sustains its seven million in
habitants. Imparts have ceased almost
altogether, and armed invasion has de
stroyed the gathered crops, so there is
comparatively no surplus to draw up
on.
After accepting the position, Hoover
said: "The commission hopes that the
situation may be brought urgently be
fore the American people, that this
charity to a liberty-loving people may
take the practical form of food supplies
and that the American organization al
ready soliciting help for the Belgians
will co-operate with the commission in
the application of their resources."

following men: H. C. Hoover, chair
man ; W. P. Page, ambassador to Eng

H. C. Hoover, '95, Stanford trustee,
known as the "Father of the Stanford
Union," has been placed at the head
of an American commission to aid
the famine-threatened Belgians. More
than $1,250,000 will be placed at
Hoover's disposal, with which to feed
and care for the famine victims. Five
hundred thousand were given him as a
first installment toward the fund from
the various American relief sources.
The Belgian situation was fast be
coming desperate, when Ambassador
Walter H. Page offered the chair of
the relief committee to Hoover. Amer
ica's representative in Belgium, Brand
Whitlock, states that the food supply
problem is becoming critical. Belgium
imports 00 per cent of the food supply
which sustains its seven million in
habitants. Imparts have ceased almost
altogether, and armed invasion has de
stroyed the gathered crops, so there is
comparatively no surplus to draw up
on.
After accepting the position, Hoover
said: "The commission hopes that the
situation may be brought urgently be
fore the American people, that this
charity to a liberty-loving people may
take the practical form of food supplies
and that the American organization al
ready soliciting help for the Belgians
will co-operate with the commission in
the application of their resources."

following men: H. C. Hoover, chair
man ; W. P. Page, ambassador to Eng
