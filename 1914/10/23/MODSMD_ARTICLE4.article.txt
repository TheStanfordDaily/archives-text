# Glee Club Will Entertain at Fremont High Tonight
## Oakland Performance First of Series; Second Northern Trip Planned for Christmas. 
### 
Reinforced by a string quintet, in
addition to the regular soloist, stunt
men, and accompanist, the Glee Club
will leave the campus thirty-four
strong this afternoon for Oakland,
where the initial concert of the sea
son will be given this evening at the
John C. Fremont high school. The
men have been practicing daily for
several weeks on the program and

has been coaching the men at rehear-
sals, and who will wield the director's
baton at the concert.
