# TOP RUNG ON LADDER OF PRACTICE SEASON MOUNTED TOMORROW
## Santa Clarans Charter Special Train to Support Their One Best Bet in Recently Voted "Big Game" Versus Varsity BUSY DAY FOR CARDINAL 
### 
The plea of the coach, trainer, and
football men for Stanford to get be
hind the team has been a legend of
vague import on the campus during
the present season. Tomorrow will
mark the turning point, and bleacher
support will be needed in earnest if
the Cardinal ruggers attach victories
in the three matches which form the
week-end program.
Santa Clara, Winged "0," and the In
surrectos are due to display a merry
tussle for the first, second, and third
division of the varsity squad.
And it is no treason to say that not
one of the games would justify big
odds in the betting ring.
Three o'clock is the time set for the
big performance between the Varsity
and the Mission University. With a
loyal crowd behind the band in section
S, fifteen good fighters and their sub
stitutes should win by a good margin.
No one of the several hundred Santa
Clarans who are coming in force on
special trains and cars has any inten
tion of watching Stanford's best bet
indulge in a sparring practice. They
believe their men have material for a
good argument.
A glance at the long, tried personnel
of the Stanford Varsity inspires
confidence. Jumbo Blase won't be
there to lock the scrum, due to a weak
shoulder, but Pettingill is a good
second, and the rest of the line is the
best, of them.
Wines, Soper, and Hall comprise the
front rank trio. In the middle rank
Clover and Braden will work. Closing
up the rear are Wylie, Pettingill, and
Gard.
Backfield talent represents Erb
half; Austin and Lachmund, five
eighths; Carroll, center three; Urban
and Reeves, wings; Andrews will
guard the goal line.
Coach Brown has selected Jacomini,
Halsted, Bloeser, Tilton, Templeton,
and Burns to act as relief men.
Reverend Mulineaux, chairman of
Seamen's Institute in San Francisco,
will referee the game.
Due to the fact that varsity man
euvers will be turned against Santa
Clara, the Olympic clubmen will be
pitted against the second string. Con
sidering the opposition which they
have presented in previous games of
the year, a hair-line difference in tal
ent is assured. Stanford is credited
with having one of the strongest sec
ond team formations in local rugby
annals. A better matched pair than
these two squads cannot be imagined.
The Blacks have given the Varsity
good measure in payment for the pum
meling they have taken.
With the most important page of
the football calendar of the prepara
tory season in full view, Yell Leader
Nixon has provided for a spirited per
formance of the bleacher athletes.
Songs and yells, both old and new,
have been printed, and will be dis
tributed.
The line-up follows:
Second Varsity — Clark, Kester,
Single (Bihlman), Rchm, Sargent
(Cole), Ogden (Card), McEuen, Wright
(Hayes), forwards; Walker, (Wilkins),
half; Greve, Hammon (Swigart), five

McGilvray (R. Westenhaver), Scovel

The plea of the coach, trainer, and
football men for Stanford to get be
hind the team has been a legend of
vague import on the campus during
the present season. Tomorrow will
mark the turning point, and bleacher
support will be needed in earnest if
the Cardinal ruggers attach victories
in the three matches which form the
week-end program.
Santa Clara, Winged "0," and the In
surrectos are due to display a merry
tussle for the first, second, and third
division of the varsity squad.
And it is no treason to say that not
one of the games would justify big
odds in the betting ring.
Three o'clock is the time set for the
big performance between the Varsity
and the Mission University. With a
loyal crowd behind the band in section
S, fifteen good fighters and their sub
stitutes should win by a good margin.
No one of the several hundred Santa
Clarans who are coming in force on
special trains and cars has any inten
tion of watching Stanford's best bet
indulge in a sparring practice. They
believe their men have material for a
good argument.
A glance at the long, tried personnel
of the Stanford Varsity inspires
confidence. Jumbo Blase won't be
there to lock the scrum, due to a weak
shoulder, but Pettingill is a good
second, and the rest of the line is the
best, of them.
Wines, Soper, and Hall comprise the
front rank trio. In the middle rank
Clover and Braden will work. Closing
up the rear are Wylie, Pettingill, and
Gard.
Backfield talent represents Erb
half; Austin and Lachmund, five
eighths; Carroll, center three; Urban
and Reeves, wings; Andrews will
guard the goal line.
Coach Brown has selected Jacomini,
Halsted, Bloeser, Tilton, Templeton,
and Burns to act as relief men.
Reverend Mulineaux, chairman of
Seamen's Institute in San Francisco,
will referee the game.
Due to the fact that varsity man
euvers will be turned against Santa
Clara, the Olympic clubmen will be
pitted against the second string. Con
sidering the opposition which they
have presented in previous games of
the year, a hair-line difference in tal
ent is assured. Stanford is credited
with having one of the strongest sec
ond team formations in local rugby
annals. A better matched pair than
these two squads cannot be imagined.
The Blacks have given the Varsity
good measure in payment for the pum
meling they have taken.
With the most important page of
the football calendar of the prepara
tory season in full view, Yell Leader
Nixon has provided for a spirited per
formance of the bleacher athletes.
Songs and yells, both old and new,
have been printed, and will be dis
tributed.
The line-up follows:
