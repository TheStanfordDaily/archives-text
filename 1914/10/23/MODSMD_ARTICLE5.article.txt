# TOP RUNG ON LADDER OF PRACTICE SEASON MOUNTED TOMORROW
## Santa Clarans Charter Special Train to Support Their One Best Bet in Recently Voted "Big Game" Versus Varsity BUSY DAY FOR CARDINAL 
### 
The plea of the coach, trainer, and
football men for Stanford to get be
hind the team has been a legend of
vague import on the campus during
the present season. Tomorrow will
mark the turning point, and bleacher
support will be needed in earnest if
the Cardinal ruggers attach victories
in the three matches which form the
week-end program.
Santa Clara, Winged "0," and the In
surrectos are due to display a merry
tussle for the first, second, and third
division of the varsity squad.
And it is no treason to say that not
one of the games would justify big
odds in the betting ring.
Three o'clock is the time set for the
big performance between the Varsity
and the Mission University. With a
loyal crowd behind the band in section
S, fifteen good fighters and their sub
stitutes should win by a good margin.
No one of the several hundred Santa
Clarans who are coming in force on
special trains and cars has any inten
tion of watching Stanford's best bet
indulge in a sparring practice. They
believe their men have material for a
good argument.
A glance at the long, tried personnel
of the Stanford Varsity inspires
confidence. Jumbo Blase won't be
there to lock the scrum, due to a weak
shoulder, but Pettingill is a good
second, and the rest of the line is the
best, of them.
