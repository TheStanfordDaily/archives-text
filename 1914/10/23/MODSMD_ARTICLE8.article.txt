## Chancellor in Characteristic Manner Tells of His Experiences in Warring Countries. 
### 
Chancellor David Starr Jordan last
night placed before an appreciative
audience in the Assembly Hall a vivid
picture of conditions in the Balkan
states, as they were and as they stand
today. With the aid of a map, Doctor
Jordan acquainted his listeners with
Balkan geography, and continuing
dealt with the comparatively recent
wars of the Slav and Greek states,
which preceded the last Balkan crisis.
After a brief summary of the war
itself, Dr. Jordan told of his journey
through Macedonia, Bulgaria, and Tur
key, during which the typical scenes
of the regions were thrown on a
screen. A high-powered automobile,
the property of a Balkan monarch,
was the vehicle used for the tHp
through a b.rigand-infested region, in
which hotels were located 300 miles
apart. During the course of his lec
ture Chancellor Jordan said:
"Hatred of race is always kindled
for political purposes. People hate
those who do not speak their own
language, and, of course, religion en
ters into it.
"The situation today is such that any
small disturbance is felt, along the en
tire line.
"Albania was built up from a strip
of seashore by the powers, who did
not want any other nation to gain con
trol of the seaeoast. Albania has al
ways been a land of violence, but an
interesting one.
"Every war, even for liberation, has
its uncertainties. No war was ever be
gun with any idea of how it would
turn out.
"Three hundred thousand Greeks
were driven from country to country,
ft was in the month of May, and the
children thought they were on a pic
nic.
"Much of the Macedonian land is as
good as any here in California, but
there are large tracts of it which have
not been plowed for a thousand years.
We found want and desolation in the
wake of the armies.
"S'nce the days of Alexander, the
Greeks have been scattered the world
over. A Greek soldier who had kept
a. candy store on Third street San
Francisco, introduced us to the Gre
cian army. One soldier was willing to
walk forty miles to talk to us."
