# ENTHUSIASM GREETS RAM'S HEAD STARS IN "ROUTING RAZMATAZ"
## Professional Grace Distinguishes Morgan's Senorita—Lasky Also Shines CLEVER BURLESQUE STAGED 
### J.C. Cross, '17 
Wine, or rather grape-juice, woman
and song; light, color and melody;
mirth, beauty and youth, everything
necessary for the delight of three
senses, were offered in abundance in
"Routing Razmataz." Ram's Head had
as little difficulty in winning the en
thusiastic approval of the Assembly
Hall audience Friday evening as In
routing the militant "Mayme." The
only difference was that the campus
theatre-goers wanted to be won, while
"Mayme" was decidedly averse to de
feat in her ambition to become the
ruler of Mexico. But that was before
she met "John Linde," whose suit
for her hand finally won as ready fa
vor as the grape-juice he attempted
to peddle. The plot, which was neces
sarily simple, has one fundamental
value—it .returns to a normal level be
fore the final curtain—a distinction
which is often foreign to burlesque.
The music, however, contributes
more to the success of "Routing Raz
mataz" than the plot. The various
compositions are essentially American
in phrasing and In orchestration. The
numbers, though frequently reminis
cent, are always melodious-, usually vig
orous, and in one instance, the "Ysa
bel" song, distinguished by a haunt
ing charm. Of the other songs, "Salva
tion Army Glide," "Dykes of Amster
dam," and "That Loving Humoresque,"
are already buzzing in campus ears.
Morgan aiul Lnsky Star.
The enjoyment of the performance
was in great measure due to Dick
Morgan's admirable impersonation of
"Ysabel." Morgan has unlimited mag
netism, a flexible voice, an engaging
manner, and decided dramatic grace,
all of which made him easily the dom
inating personality in a well-balanced
cant, lie r'ngs and dances with a
professional air of dashing confidence
and displays a most artistic sense of
color combination. His success evi
dently depends upon an indefinable
Morgan punch, which is invaluable in
getting his work over the footlights.
Rernie Lasky, '12, was at his best in
the buffo part of "John Linde." He
is an exceptionally clever comedian
with the gift, so often lacking in bur
lesque fun-makers, of recognizing the
difference between comedy anri horse
play. "Routing Razmataz" contains a
quantity of genu'ne, if not always orig
inal. comedy in which Lasky was vast
ly entertaining. He sang and danced
to much applause, and kept the audi
ence in continuous appreciative laugh
ter by his excellent characterization
of the ambassador.
The entrance of "Mayme Razmataz"
was carefully handled. Fat Streeter,
•IS—the appellation is ethical accord
ing to the Ram's Head program—
played in high spirits, without sacri
ficing a point, and sang his "Loving
Humoresque" number in a way that
brought him countless encores. He
fully realized "Mayme's" exuberant
spontaneity and was refreshing enough
to make his new friends in the audi
ence glad they were living.
Forbes Mnible as "Ever.
Doome.r Forbes, '1. r >. as "Portfolio
Diaz." had a rather thankless role. De
bonair and nimble, he executed his
Mexican dance with "Ysabel" at the
beginning of the second act. with his
usual ease and grace. ITe appeared to
excellent advantage in the Shakes
pearean burlesque as the emotional
father of a new "Desdeniona."
A performance of decided merit was
that by Judne Melvin, '17, as "Tamalio
de Nutt." Melvin has an excellent
singing voice, easy and assured stage
presence, and could have done more
than he was given to, for he injected
the very spirit of burlesque into the
production by his bizarre antics as the
intriguing chef.
Hal Dievendorf, '17, made a very fa
vorable impression as a droll little
soubrette with a confident and spirited
bearing. Scotchy Gibb, *15, presented
an excellent and amusing characteriza
tion of "Mashimuro Togo." The role of
the war correspondent,while not true to
life, was picturesque in a musical com
edy way, but the parts of the three
generals had little significance.
A spirited chorus, numerous and
well-trained, added not a little to the
success of the production. The va
riety and taste of the color schemes—
evidently due to Morgan and Forbes —
deserve unqualified approval. Picture
a chorus in red, black, green, tango,
purple, yellow, gray and blue! Ram's
Head considered these and many mo.re,
and results were their justification.

success of the production. The va
riety and taste of the color schemes—
evidently due to Morgan and Forbes —
deserve unqualified approval. Picture
a chorus in red, black, green, tango,
purple, yellow, gray and blue! Ram's
Head considered these and many mo.re,
and results were their justification.
Wine, or rather grape-juice, woman
and song; light, color and melody;
mirth, beauty and youth, everything
necessary for the delight of three
senses, were offered in abundance in
"Routing Razmataz." Ram's Head had
as little difficulty in winning the en
thusiastic approval of the Assembly
Hall audience Friday evening as In
routing the militant "Mayme." The
only difference was that the campus
theatre-goers wanted to be won, while
"Mayme" was decidedly averse to de
feat in her ambition to become the
ruler of Mexico. But that was before
she met "John Linde," whose suit
for her hand finally won as ready fa
vor as the grape-juice he attempted
to peddle. The plot, which was neces
sarily simple, has one fundamental
value—it .returns to a normal level be
fore the final curtain—a distinction
which is often foreign to burlesque.
The music, however, contributes
more to the success of "Routing Raz
mataz" than the plot. The various
compositions are essentially American
in phrasing and In orchestration. The
numbers, though frequently reminis
cent, are always melodious-, usually vig
orous, and in one instance, the "Ysa
bel" song, distinguished by a haunt
ing charm. Of the other songs, "Salva
tion Army Glide," "Dykes of Amster
dam," and "That Loving Humoresque,"
are already buzzing in campus ears.
Morgan aiul Lnsky Star.
The enjoyment of the performance
was in great measure due to Dick
Morgan's admirable impersonation of
"Ysabel." Morgan has unlimited mag
netism, a flexible voice, an engaging
manner, and decided dramatic grace,
all of which made him easily the dom
inating personality in a well-balanced
cant, lie r'ngs and dances with a
professional air of dashing confidence
and displays a most artistic sense of
color combination. His success evi
dently depends upon an indefinable
Morgan punch, which is invaluable in
getting his work over the footlights.
Rernie Lasky, '12, was at his best in
the buffo part of "John Linde." He
is an exceptionally clever comedian
with the gift, so often lacking in bur
lesque fun-makers, of recognizing the
difference between comedy anri horse
play. "Routing Razmataz" contains a
quantity of genu'ne, if not always orig
inal. comedy in which Lasky was vast
ly entertaining. He sang and danced
to much applause, and kept the audi
ence in continuous appreciative laugh
ter by his excellent characterization
of the ambassador.
The entrance of "Mayme Razmataz"
was carefully handled. Fat Streeter,
•IS—the appellation is ethical accord
ing to the Ram's Head program—
played in high spirits, without sacri
ficing a point, and sang his "Loving
Humoresque" number in a way that
brought him countless encores. He
fully realized "Mayme's" exuberant
spontaneity and was refreshing enough
to make his new friends in the audi
ence glad they were living.
Forbes Mnible as "Ever.
Doome.r Forbes, '1. r >. as "Portfolio
Diaz." had a rather thankless role. De
bonair and nimble, he executed his
Mexican dance with "Ysabel" at the
beginning of the second act. with his
usual ease and grace. ITe appeared to
excellent advantage in the Shakes
pearean burlesque as the emotional
father of a new "Desdeniona."
A performance of decided merit was
that by Judne Melvin, '17, as "Tamalio
de Nutt." Melvin has an excellent
singing voice, easy and assured stage
presence, and could have done more
than he was given to, for he injected
the very spirit of burlesque into the
production by his bizarre antics as the
intriguing chef.
Hal Dievendorf, '17, made a very fa
vorable impression as a droll little
soubrette with a confident and spirited
bearing. Scotchy Gibb, *15, presented
an excellent and amusing characteriza
tion of "Mashimuro Togo." The role of
the war correspondent,while not true to
life, was picturesque in a musical com
edy way, but the parts of the three
generals had little significance.

A spirited chorus, numerous and
well-trained, added not a little to the
success of the production. The va
riety and taste of the color schemes—
evidently due to Morgan and Forbes —
deserve unqualified approval. Picture
a chorus in red, black, green, tango,
purple, yellow, gray and blue! Ram's
Head considered these and many mo.re,
and results were their justification.
