# Prayer of Army Men
## 
### 
Kenneth Proctor Littauer presents a
complaint of the fighting men in the
ranks in the dashing verse form which
secured Kipling's early fame. The
poem was printed in the current issue
of Leslie's Weekly.
At the going, when we stumble up the
gangway to the ship,
While we wish, and curse the wish,
that we could stay;
On the Channel, as we watch the
yearning cliffs of England dip.
Help us, Lord, to hide our sickened
hearts away!
On the marches —on the marches with
blisters on our feet,
When our kits weigh not much less
than half a ton,
And our idea of Heaven is a place
to sleep and eat —
Give us strength. Lord, 'till our thirty
miles are done!
Through the weary, starlight vigils
when we guard the Sleeping
tents,
Where they huddle grey behind us in
the gloom,
Bid us challenge every phantom that
that our fear of death invents;
Keep our ears alert to hear the creep
ing Doom!
In the trenches, with the bullet-rid
den earthworks spurting dust,
And the peering rifle muzzles spitting
flame;
In the sweating bayonet charges, with
the thrust and wrench and
thrust,
Hear us, when we, dying, call upon
Thy name!
In the winning, in the losing, in the
triumph, the despair,
Be we victors or the holders of de
feat,
Keep us mindful of the honor of a
nation that we bear;
Let our souls, Lord, be above the fate
we meet!
