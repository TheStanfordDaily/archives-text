# COUNCIL COMMENDS ALUMNI TO FILL THE VACANCY ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES
## Name C.K. Field and Ralph Arnold as Suitable Candidates for the Position. 
### 
The Advisory Board of the Alumni
Association took action at their meet
ing on the campus yesterday looking
toward a communication to the Board
of Trustees in the near future, com
mending the names of Charles K. Field,
'95, or Ralph Arnold, '99, for election
to the board.
A vacancy was created by the death
of Charles G. Lathrop, and a successor
remains to be elected.
Both men are prominent alumni of
the University. Field is editor of Sun
set Magazine and vice-president of the
newly-formed Woodhead, Field Pub
lishing Co., which has taken over the
control of the magazine.
Arnold graduated from the Geology
Department in 1898. He served for a
time as an instructor in the University
after his graduation, and has since
been engaged in geological and arche
ological pursuits.
In the last few years he has become
an oil expert, with his main office in
Los Angeles, and a subsidiary office
in New York.
The .reorganization of the Advisory
Board resulted in the election of Le
land W. Cutler, '06, retiring secretary
of the board, as president, and D. W.
Burbank, former graduate manager, as
secretary.
Further action of the board resulted
in the merging of scholarship money
recently received with the Alumni
Loan Fund, a fund devoted to advanc
ing graduate work in the University.
