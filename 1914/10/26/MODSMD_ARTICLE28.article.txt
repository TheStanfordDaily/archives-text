# FALL BASEBALL LEAGUERS DISBAND AFTER SEASON OF SUCCESSFUL EFFORT
## J.S. Jeffers Wins Shield Offered to Non-Varsity Player With Highest Matting Average. 
### 
Last week's play closed a most suc
cessful fall baseball season. Inter
est was strong among the players up
to the last game, and a very good
brand of baseball was exhibited ii
throughout the whole term. Captain
Workman has been able to get a good
line on material for spring workout,
besides improving the playing of the
men who came out, and he is well sat
isfied with the results which have been
accomplished.
During the first part of the season
the squad was divided into four teams
named the Birds, Feds, Colts, and
Harps, competing on equal terms with
each other. This system proved to
be badly suited to new material, and
in its place two squads were created, ,
one composed of players of class A
grade and the other of class B mate- 1
rial. It is since this change that sta
tistics on the playing of the men have
been kept.
The silver shield offered by D. M.
Folsom, associate professor of mining,
for the man who batted highest in the
league, exclusive of varsity men and
substitutes, was won by J. S. .lef
fers, '15, with an average of .217. M. E.
Hurley, '15, batted .300, but did not
play in the required number of ten 1
games. A. W. Hart, '18, batting .285, ,
also made a strong bid for the shield,
but fell down on the number of games.
F. H. Gates, '15, and M. H. Sanborn,
'18, ran Jeffers a close second, each
batting 214. The only home runs were
scored by Jeffers and Gates.
R. F. Downing, '15, leads in the num
ber of runs scored, with a total of
eight, being closely seconded by San
born, with six.
Hurley struck out the largest num
ber of men, fanning twenty-eight in
nine games. Second honors go to A.
D. Cram, '15, who fanned twenty-one ■
men in six games.
Varsity men and substitutes are not
included in any of these figures.
The batting shield offered by Pro
fessor Folsom will be competed for
each year, the present possessor hold- :
ing it until next spring. Each man
who wins the shield will have the
privilege of engraving his name on it.
Finale Is Best Game.
Tn the best game of the season, from
a baseball standpoint, the A players
handed the AA nine both a defeat and
a shutout Friday in the windup of the
fall season. For seven innings both
teams were on thei.r toes, but the stick
work of Dent and Jeffers, combined
with classic fielding, gave Team A a
3-0 victory. AA was at bat twenty
times, getting only two bingles, while
A secured four hits out of twenty
three times up.

line on material for spring workout,
besides improving the playing of the
men who came out, and he is well sat
isfied with the results which have been
accomplished.
During the first part of the season
the squad was divided into four teams
named the Birds, Feds, Colts, and
Harps, competing on equal terms with
each other. This system proved to
be badly suited to new material, and
in its place two squads were created, ,
one composed of players of class A
grade and the other of class B mate- 1
rial. It is since this change that sta
tistics on the playing of the men have
been kept.
The silver shield offered by D. M.
Folsom, associate professor of mining,
for the man who batted highest in the
league, exclusive of varsity men and
substitutes, was won by J. S. .lef
fers, '15, with an average of .217. M. E.
Hurley, '15, batted .300, but did not
play in the required number of ten 1
games. A. W. Hart, '18, batting .285, ,
also made a strong bid for the shield,
but fell down on the number of games.
F. H. Gates, '15, and M. H. Sanborn,
'18, ran Jeffers a close second, each
batting 214. The only home runs were
scored by Jeffers and Gates.
R. F. Downing, '15, leads in the num
ber of runs scored, with a total of
eight, being closely seconded by San
born, with six.
Hurley struck out the largest num
ber of men, fanning twenty-eight in
nine games. Second honors go to A.
D. Cram, '15, who fanned twenty-one ■
men in six games.
Varsity men and substitutes are not
included in any of these figures.
The batting shield offered by Pro
fessor Folsom will be competed for
each year, the present possessor hold- :
ing it until next spring. Each man
who wins the shield will have the
privilege of engraving his name on it.
Finale Is Best Game.
Tn the best game of the season, from
a baseball standpoint, the A players
handed the AA nine both a defeat and
a shutout Friday in the windup of the
fall season. For seven innings both
teams were on thei.r toes, but the stick
work of Dent and Jeffers, combined
with classic fielding, gave Team A a
3-0 victory. AA was at bat twenty
times, getting only two bingles, while
A secured four hits out of twenty
three times up.
Last week's play closed a most suc
cessful fall baseball season. Inter
est was strong among the players up
to the last game, and a very good
brand of baseball was exhibited ii
throughout the whole term. Captain
Workman has been able to get a good
line on material for spring workout,
besides improving the playing of the
men who came out, and he is well sat
isfied with the results which have been
accomplished.
