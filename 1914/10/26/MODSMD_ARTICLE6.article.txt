# LAURELS ASSIGNED TO STANFORD IN THRILLING BOUT WITH MISSIONITES
## Cardinal Varsity Fights Through Seventy Minutes of Sensational Rugby to Well-Earned Victory ALL-BLACKS SHOW OLYMPIANS HEELS IN AGGRESSIVE GAME 
### 
The Varsity fought past a barrier of
fists and feet Saturday, and squeezed
Santa Clara through the zero in a
score of 13-0. Few of the local resi
dents have had occasion to stretch
their legs and lungs so continuously as
they did during that seventy-minute
football melee.
It was a real g'ime of football. A
fair claim to the title of rugby might
have been doubted in the early stages.
At any rate there was much to be said
on both sides. Then Referee Mullin
eaux insisted that some of the primary
rules were still in force, to the grief
of Voiglit and Hickey.
Whether it be called rugby or just
football, there was a battle royal
which furnished a conservative aver
age of one thrill per minute.
Brilliant individual play was the
main pivot on which two of Stanford's
three tries turned. One man getaways
were numerous in both fifteens, in
fairness to the visitors. In naming
the seventeen men who pulled oars in
Captain Card's si ip one names as
many stars.
Team Combination Good.
In spite of the fact, the match was
not an individual game. Such a won
derful machine as that one the Mission
university sent us could not have been
blanked by one-man plays. Splendid
organization in defence by the forward
pack of the Cardinal kept the slate
clean. All the buffeting of the oppos
ing scrums didn't break the resistance
of the varsity forwards. Occasional
flaws let a Santa Claran through, but
the ever-presence of backfield support
averted tragedy, and proved that, An
drews, Carroll, Austin, Urban, Reeves,
Lachmund. and Erb weren't basking in
the exclusive light of the solar myth,
"arroll Makes Flying Tackle.
Better than any of the scoring plays
was the lunge with which Danny Car
roll sent Voight to touch-in-goal after
bis forty-yard race toward the line,
with Wallace, which made the cipher
on Santa Clara's score board nervou*.
That one spurt which turned a forlorne
hope into a victory and carried Voight
three feet through the air was the par
excellence of aggressive defense, al
though a forward pass fouled the run,
and it would not have resulted in a
score.
Kama ire Versus Andrews.
Ramage. at full, played in great form
for the Catholic team, and produced
touch kicks which rival any that have
been sonn on Stanford Field. The vet
eran Ybarrando lias been eclipsed by
this newer star of the neighboring in
situation. whose booting duels with
Helmus Andrews added their force to
the tingle of anxiety which held both
rooting sections. No one who saw the
game can hold any feeling but admira
tion for the giants of the opposing
backfields, who displayed good fight
ing spirit.
The first try for Stanford developed
from a fifteen-yard scrum, which was
reached by steady passing and drib
bling pressure during the opening fif
teen minutes. Erb whipped the ball
out to Aust'n. who made more than a
mild imitation of the gyroscope and
passed through the mass of Santa
Clara's forwards and backs. Card
made a great effort to .return the play
after Ramage's dropout, by breaking

through at twenty-five yards and
breaking a path for twenty yards, until
stopped by Ramage.
A near-scoring duet in the second
half by Reeves and Carroll brought
the bleachers to their feet. The play
covered seventy yards, starting with
Reeves on the Stanford thirty-five
yard mark, going to Carroll and back
to Reeves. Ramage secured on the
five-yard line and cross-kicked, sav
ing for Santa Clara.
Lachmund Sprints to Try.
Lachmund's race down the length
of the field resulted in the second try,
and was the individual sensation of
the afternoon. With the ball on the
ground and Ybar.rando guarding the
line, "Ott" kicked past him, and by a
wonderful spurt passed the sturdy In
dian back, covering by a good margin.
Austin converted.
Burns, playing in place of Frank
Reeves, at left wing, attached the sec
ond star coup in a forty-five-yard run
along the touch line. Wallace, the
Santa Clara wing, had muffed Erb's
short kick, and "She," marking his op
ponent, nipped the ball and negotiated
a scattered field until tackled by
Stewart, when he passed to Carroll
for the try. Austin converted. Rurns'
run was a beautiful sample of judge
ment, and was a gratifying conclusion
of the day's scoring.
Splendid offense and defense were
displayed by both teams. Saturday's
contest portioned the work between
forwards and backs more evenly than
any previous game of the season.
Too much credit for the dash of the
game cannot be placed with the root
ing sections. All other considerations
aside, the visiting yell-leaders got
"results" from their cohorts, and
transferred the fever of their own en
thusiasm to the field. The visitors
surely supported their decision to
make the Stanford-Santa Clara match
their "big game" of the season,

The Second Varsity, now popularly
termed as the Stanford All-Blacks,
showed its heels to the Winged "O"
fifteen, by chalking up all to 5 victory
in a. fast and exciting game.
Directly following West's kickoff,
the Black forwards rushed the hall
downfield to their opponents' five-yard
line, where an over-eager kick by one
of the Stanford pack allowed the
Olympics to save. Following a scrum
near the goal line, Wynne blocked a
kirk from an opposing back, followed
and covered for the first try. West failed
at conversion. From that time until
the end of the half the white jersied
backfield showed its superiority to
that of the Second Varsity in puzzling
short-arm passes. .Tust before the end
of the period. Guerin picked up in a
dribbling rush and dashed across the
line for the tying score. 0. Montgom
ery converted.
The second half opened with West's
touch-finding boots, a feature. The
Stanford forwards forced the play by
slow advances from the Olympic thir
ty-five-yard line to their five-yard
line, where Walker pirked up from
the loose, and crossed fo.r the winning
try. West missed a difficult chance at
goal. A sensational seventv-five-vard
passing rush between Oreve. Swigart.
Laine, and Clark, in the midst or a !
dangerous Winged "O" attack, resulted
in the latter's try, and was the last
score of the game. West's placement
squarely between the posts raised the
final summary 11 to 5 in favor of the
Stanford All-Blacks.
Third Varsity Defeated.
In the curtain-raiser, the Insurrec
tos defeated the Third Varsity after a
most slow and uninteresting exhibi
tion. Tallies in the first half by Mc-
Coy and Miller made the visiting rug
gers' total. Single scored the lone
Stanford try in the second period,
when he dashed over the line from the
loose, after a line-out near the vic
tors' goal line. At the conclusion, the
scoreboard read 6 to 3 in favor of the
