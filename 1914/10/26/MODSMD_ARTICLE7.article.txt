# STRICT CENSORSHIP INDICATES ALLIED STRATEGY IN NORTH
## Meagerness of Official News Causes French People to Complain NAVAL GUNS RAKE COAST 
### 
United Press Telegraphic Report
Paris, Oct. 26.—The Germans are
being held along the battle line in the
north and the French are pressing the
fighting on the extreme right in an
effort to force the Teutons to change
their plans. This is the interpretation
of the statement that there is severe
fighing in the Woevre and Argonne dis
tricts near the Mouse. In an effort
to make their operation in the north
stronger, the Germans have withdrawn
the Bavarians from their left, and have
sent them, with fresh levies, from
Cologne and Berlin to reinforce the
line in Belgium. The French have
taken advantage of this move, and are
said to be exerting severe pressure
upon the German left.
Cruisers' Guns Rake Coast.
Paris, Oct. 26. —The enfilading fire
of the British and French warships
upon the Belgian seacoast continues
with telling effect. As a result the
Teutons have abandoned almost all
their positions on the route south be
tween Nieuport and Ostend. Wher
ever it is possible, the Germans are
laying batteries to cope with sea ar
tillery. The fighting is most severe
about the regions of Woevre and An
gonne on the allied center. In an ef
fort to again acquire means of com
munication through St. Mihiel, and
the Meuse river, the Teutons are us
ing heavy artillery against the French
guns in command of the situation.
Much complaint is arising over the
increasing meagreness of official news
from the front. The wounded officers
are forbidden to talk. War headquar
ters refuse to give out any definite ad
vices.

Paris, Oct. 26. —The Communique as
serts that the Germans failed to follow
up their advantage when they crossed
the Yser river with a heavy force. Tt is
stated that the allied line opposing the
enemy on the south bank remained
intact, and the right wing of the
French maintained their ground. The
Teuton losses arc described as "con
siderable."
Britons in Belgium "Rounded ITp."
London, Oct. 26.—British refugees
arriving f.rom Holland say that all
Englishmen in Belgian territory who
have been captured, have either been
expelled from the country or held
pending decision as to whether they
should be treated as spies or prisoners
of war. The fugitives say that the
Teutons are putting defensive plans
into effect and in order to conceal
thei.r operations they have ordered nil
Britons rounded-up.
Because of the tightening of the al
lied censorship it is believed that an
other important movement against the
Germans is in progress in northern
France and along the Belgian coast.

London, Oct. 26.—British refugees
arriving f.rom Holland say that all
Englishmen in Belgian territory who
have been captured, have either been
expelled from the country or held
pending decision as to whether they
should be treated as spies or prisoners
of war. The fugitives say that the
Teutons are putting defensive plans
into effect and in order to conceal
thei.r operations they have ordered nil
Britons rounded-up.
Because of the tightening of the al
lied censorship it is believed that an
other important movement against the
Germans is in progress in northern
France and along the Belgian coast.

Paris, Oct. 26.—The Germans are
being held along the battle line in the
north and the French are pressing the
fighting on the extreme right in an
effort to force the Teutons to change
their plans. This is the interpretation
of the statement that there is severe
fighing in the Woevre and Argonne dis
tricts near the Mouse. In an effort
to make their operation in the north
stronger, the Germans have withdrawn
the Bavarians from their left, and have
sent them, with fresh levies, from
Cologne and Berlin to reinforce the
line in Belgium. The French have
taken advantage of this move, and are
said to be exerting severe pressure
upon the German left.
