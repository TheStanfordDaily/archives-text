# Number Eleven
## 
### 
An amendment to the State Consti
tution that should have the support of
every voter in the State, who is in any
way interested in educational institu
tions, is number eleven on the ballot
for November third, appropriating one
million eight hundred thousand dollars
for building purposes at the University
of California. It is a non-partizan
measure, free from any taint of spe
cial interest, and as its passage is
essential to the progress of our State
University, the amendment should be
brought to the attention of every elec
tor.
The University of California has
enjoyed a remarkable growth in the
last decade, and as the appropria
tions for equipment and buildings
have not kept pace with the enroll
ment, additional accommodations are
essential. The half-erected Doe Lib
rary will be completed; a wing will
be added to the Agricultural Hall
in order to house the branches
of Forestry and Horticulture; the
old and delapidated North Hall will
be replaced by a modern class room
structure; the Chemistry building
will be enlarged to supplement the
inadequate quarters now used; and
provision will be made for the Uni
versity Extension work.
The fear of those interested in the
progress of one of the great univer
sities of the country is not that the
opposition will vote down the amend
ment, but that indifference and ig
norance will defeat the plan through
the small vote route. The problem
then is to give the act publicity, and
to interest the live people of every
community.
While the percentage of students at
Stanford who are registered electors
of the district is small, the part that
we could play is favorable comment
and an abundance of the boost spirit.
Each voter's conversion is an act in j
furtherance of an educational insti- ]
tution that ranks with the best.
