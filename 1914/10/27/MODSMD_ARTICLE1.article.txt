The regulations accepted by the Con
ference to govern the reinstated Plug
Ugly conform very closely to the rules
governing the original upper class
rush. Rule two, which in the past reg
ulated the now eliminated Plug Ugly
show, has been replaced by the re
quirement that both the Senior and
Junior classes submit their completed
posters to the Student Council for cen
sorship.
Rule three has been revised so that
the rush will now terminate after the
Juniors have passed through the East
Arch, instead of beneath it as in forme.r
years.
With these exceptions, the commit
tee appointed by the Conference to
change the Plug Ugly regulations so
as to meet the new restrictions, left
the rules identical with those of 1912
and 1913.
Adhering to the tradition that the
Plug Ugly shall be held a week before
the Big Game, the date of this year's
rush has been set for November 7.
leaving the night of November 6 as
poster night.
As is the custom, the rush will begin
on the steps of the general library.
The Juniors, unmolested, will then cir
cle the outer Quad by the English
building, and thence to the Law build
ing, while the Seniors pass through
the Memorial Court.
The fight will then take place in and
around the arcades of the inner Quad,
and will terminate when the Juniors
have forced their way through the
fourth year men, massed at the East
Arch. The rules follow:
Plug Ugly Rules.
1. It shall be permissable for Sen
niors to oppose the bringing of Junior
posters on the campus, but said post
ers, once laid, shall not be removed.
2. The completed poster to be sub
mitted to the Council prior to Novem
ber G.
?>. The Plug Ugly rush shall be
started directly in front of the general

circle the outer Quad by the English
building to the Law building, unop
posed. Here a fight for possession of
the Inner Quad will ensue, terminat
ing after the Juniors pass through the
East Arch.
4. The rush may be stopped at any
time, at the discretion of the referee,
in order to avoid a set fight.
