# ORIGINALITY IS KEYNOTE OF NEXT GYM CLUB DANCE
## Hawaiian Sextette to Furnish Musical Program—Exhibition Stunts to Be Staged. 
### 
The Gym Club party, to be held next
Friday evening, will offer other fea
tures than one-stepping, according to
the latest announcement of the stunt
committee. The north entrance of
the Armory, which has hitherto
served as a convenient rendez
vous for "roughs," will be trans
formed into a Japanese garden—a de
sirable place for promenades or rest
between dances.
The popular Hawaiian sextette will
furnish an attractive musical program.
These musicians are well-known for
their originality and enthusiasm,
which always characterizes their sing
ing and playing.
The main stunt of the evening will
be the gymnastic exhibition staged by
members of the club, including fancy
single and double tumbling, artistic
pyramid formations, and comedy skits.
Sixteen dances and two extras com
prise the attractive programs, which
will be given out at the door. Suffi
cient time will be allowed to inscribe
them before the music begins.
Special ca,rs will leave the campus at
eight o'clock, returning after the
dance. Tickets may be obtained eith
er at the Bookstore or from the Gym
Club members.
