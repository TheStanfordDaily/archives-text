# MATERIAL FOR BONFIRE IS RAPIDLY BEING GATHERED
## 
### 
More material for the Freshman bon
fire is now on hand than was first
gathered, before the premature confla
gration destroyed the foundation of the
huge pyre. The material will not ne
nut into position until a week or so
before the big game, as it has been
deemed advisable to merely gather
the material without finishing the
structure to prevent a repetition of last
Tuesday's occurrence. Information as
to the location of more material will be
gladly received by the bonfire com
mittee.
