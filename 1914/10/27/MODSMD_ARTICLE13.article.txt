# ENGINEERING SOCIETIES TO GIVE JOINT SMOKER
## 
### 
The Mechanical Engineering and
Electrical Engineering Societies will
give a joint smoker on November 4.
The combination of the two societies
for this event was thought better, since
many students registering in Mechan
ical Engineering after two years take
straight Electrical Engineering work.
The names of new men elected to
the two societies will be announced at
the joint meeting.
