It never has been a maxim of Chan
cellor Jordan that the best defense of
territory is a standing army; that a
guarantee of neutrality is in prepared
ness for conflict. There is no hostile
force threatening the territory of the
"red tiled principality," yet its boun
daries have been patrolled for days,
its strategic positions manned in an
ticipation of attack.
The armed camps of Europe suffer
in a military sense, in comparison
with the Cardiual-hued forces of mil
itarism, mobilized a week ago..
Today the order came from general
headquarters for the disbanding of the
organized bodies, official word that
will reduce the legions to a watchful
corporal's guard. The announcement
will be welcomed by every enlisted
man, and by every unfortunate civilian
living within earshot of the rendez
vous.
"Moderation in all things"—this is as
applicable to the expression of true
college spirit as to the ordinary af
fairs of life. In their zealous watch
of things Cardinal, the underclassmen
should bear this good soldier's maxim
in mind.
