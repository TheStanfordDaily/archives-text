published in the December, 1911, num
ber of the Sequoia. Hill, who is now
an instructor in the English Depart
ment, was editor of Volume XIX of
"The Sequoia," during his senior year
in college.
A giant toiling in the chill and mist
That hang upon the edges of the day;
A plowman, watchful of the play
Of soil that makes the plow's uneven
grist;
The thousand lovely things the sun
has kissed
Around him go unmarked —his air is
gray
At noontime —even God is far away
Behind the candles and the Eucharist.
Yet he shall hear, thus blindly stum
bling on
Rare clarion voices, if he be not deaf—
The cry of Gorky ringing clear and
straight
As the first golden messenger of dawn,
And swelling up, the indeterminate,
Deep-toned, protesting voice of Au
dreyoff.
