# Exchange of Professors to Continue Despite War
## 
### 
In the Literary Digest for October
24, we learn that the system of ex
change professorships between Ger
many and our universities will con
tinue, despite the war. The Chicago
News sees these exchanges as ad
mirably cultural:
"A more gene.ral exchange of this
sort among all the nations would go
far toward dispelling antagonism
and preventing war. Fundamentally it
was race hatred, based on misunder
standings, that brought on the present
conflict. Knowledge and appreciation
of the arts and learning and social
customs of other peoples does much to
bring nations together.
"The close relatiuns in matters of
education between this country and
Germany have done much to produce a
good understanding. The United States
has drawn heavily for its own uses
on German culture and scholarship.
American students in large numbers
have profited by the learning at Ger
man institutions.
"Until the Rhodes scholarships were
founded comparatively few Americans
attended English universities. Cecil
Rhodes, with his broad vision, had in
view the breaking down of cultural
antagonisms when he planned the fa
mous Oxford scholarships for foreign
ers. National and race hatred soften
under the influence of intimate ac
quaintance. Since it. is not possible
to carry student bodies across the
seas, a useful substitute has besn
found in the exchange of professors."
