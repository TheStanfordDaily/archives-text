"After completing the course of
study in the public schools of
Salem, he went to Stanford Uni
versity, where, by hard work, econ
omy and close attention to his
studies, he completed a course in min
ing engineering and metallurgy. After
graduation he entered the employ of
the London mining firm of Rothchilds.
"After serving the English firm well
and faithfully in Australia several
years, he was transferred to the Lon
don office, where the American ambas
sador found him, and, recognizing his
fitness for the important duties re
quired, had him assigned to that posi
tion.
"Mr. Hoover is an American who has
made good wherever tried, and will do
himself and his country honor in this
service."
