# STANFORD CHEMISTS WILL NOT FEEL EFFECTS OF WAR
## Professor Stillman Declares Supply on Hand Will Last at Least a Year. 
### 
Though the war in Europe will work
a hardship on many universities of the
country, by causing a scarcity of chem
icals, manufactured only in Germany,
Stanford will not feel this stringency
for more than a year, according to
Professor John Maxson Stillman, head
of the chemistry department.
The secret of Stanford's advantage
is the huge supply of chemicals, valued
at several thousand dollars, that was
shipped to America just before the war
began. This stock is now stored in the
chemistry building, and is sufficient to
last the University fo.r more than a
year in practically every line of ex
periment.
Professor Stillman does not think
that Stanford will find it necessary to
manufacture any chemicals here. If
necessary, it can be done, but the de
partment hopes, by conservation of the
present supply, and slight changes in
the courses, which demand the use of
chemicals made in Germany, to be able
to continue work unhandicapped until
the war is over.
A movement is on foot by national
and state organizations of chemists to
begin the manufacture of chemicals in
America. The colleges of the country
are being asked to join in this move
ment. Professor Stillman does not
think that Stanford will attempt to en
ter the manufacturing field, because
the installation of necessary machin
ery would take a period of time, before
which the war would be probably end
ed.
However, he does believe that some
of the American chemical dealers will
enter the field and manufacture, if
hostilities do not cease soon in Ger
many and permit shipments of supplies
to this country.
