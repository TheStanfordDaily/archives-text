# ALUMNI WILL SUPPORT RELIEF FUND DANSANT
## FESTIVAL PLANNED TO ADVANCE CLINICS' SOCIAL WORK. Auxiliary Association Will Be Hosts in Palace Hotel Eearly in December. 
### 
The alumni auxiliary of the Stan
ford clinic will give a dansant at the
Palace Hotel in San Francisco on De
cember 6 for the purpose of raising
funds for the continuation of the so
cial service work carried on by the
clinics in connection with their reg
ular medical work. The Advisory
Board of the Alumni Association com
mended the movement at its recent
meeting on the campus, and asked the
co-operation of the alumni generally
in the support of the affair.
The social service work of the clin
ics is well known on the campus,
where subscriptions have often been
raised for its support. Many of the
patients are unable to work, o.r can
not find work when they are dis
missed from the clinic departments of
Lane Hospital. Many of the patients
have wives and children who are de
pendent on their efforts, and who ac
cordingly suffer when the bread
earner is confined in the hospital on
account of illness. It is to give re
lief in these cases, which are numer
ous. that the social service fund was
started. The association has se
cured the services of Mrs. Katherine
I. Barnett, who devotes all of her
time to looking after these cases and
reporting on those worthy of receiv
ing aid.
The alumni organization has been
formed to aid this work, and one of its
means of raising funds will be the
dansant planned for December 6.
Campus musical organizations will be
requested to furnish their part in en
tertaining the guests and providing
music for the dancers.
The Campus Auxiliary Associa
tion is planning to increase its
membership by opening the rolls to
underclassmen. This change in the
organization was decided upon at a
recent meeting of the Executive Com
mittee. One object in making this in
novation is to prepare the association
for the increase of work which will
attend the influx of foreigners into
San Francisco, due to the opening of
the Panama canal.
The report for August, an example
of the amount of wo.rk accomplished,
shows that Mrs. Barnett had 590 in
terviews with patients in clinics and
the hospital. Besides these she gave
130 telephone interviews, made 45
visits to the homes of patients and re
ferred 13 cases to the Associated
Charities.

Palace Hotel in San Francisco on De
cember 6 for the purpose of raising
funds for the continuation of the so
cial service work carried on by the

The social service work of the clin
ics is well known on the campus,
where subscriptions have often been
raised for its support. Many of the
patients are unable to work, o.r can
not find work when they are dis
missed from the clinic departments of
Lane Hospital. Many of the patients
have wives and children who are de
pendent on their efforts, and who ac
cordingly suffer when the bread
earner is confined in the hospital on
account of illness. It is to give re
lief in these cases, which are numer
ous. that the social service fund was
started. The association has se
cured the services of Mrs. Katherine
I. Barnett, who devotes all of her
