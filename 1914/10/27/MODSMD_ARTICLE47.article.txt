Southern California college publica
tions are planning the organization oj
an Intercollegiate Editorial Associa
tion. Monthly meetings will be held,
at which the editorial problem will be
up for discussion. The high schools of
that part of the state have already
formed the Student Press Association
of Southern California, an organiza
tion that has been very successful in
the two years that it has been in ex
istence. This association takes into
membership monthly, annual, and
weekly publications, and holds a con
vention once each year. The main
idea is the interchange of news, pa
pers, and ideas.
