W. S. Burns, '14, and F. F. Walker,
'18, have been promoted to places on
the football training table at the Phi
Gamma Delta house. This advance
ment comes as a well-merited re
ward for the showing made by these
players in last Saturday's games.
Burns, who made the sidelines last
fall as substitute for Erb and Tilton
in the halfback position, has been dis
playing fine form this season at wing
three-quarters. Substituting for Frank
Reeves in Saturday's scrimmage with
Santa Clara, he proved himself a fast
and heady player.
Walker captained the Freshman fif
teen this year in their "Baby Game"
with St. Mary's and has been con
sistently improving in his position at
half. He filled the berth behind tho
sc.rum in the Second Varsity game
against the Olympics last Saturday.
Next week-end will again see three
Stanford fifteens in action, two on the
turf, and one away from home. The
Varsity will find worthy opponents in
the Alumni Club, composed of former
collegiate players. The Second Varsity
will be given another hard game,
when they meet the Titan Club, which
afforded the California fifteen such a
warm contest Saturday. The Third
Varsity will journey to College Park,
San Jose, where they will play the
College of Pacific in their fourth con
test with this aggregation in the last
two months.
Tomorrow afternoon the Varsity
will be afforded good competition by
the Stanford All-Blacks, when a thir
ty-minute line-up will be indulged in
for the entertainment of the bleachers.
Owing to the fact that the second
team defeated the Olympic Club Sat
urday by a good margin, a hotly con
tested game may be anticipated.
The condition of Frank Reeves, var
sity wing, who was injured in Satur
day's contest with Santa Clara, is
causing considerable worry to Train
er Maloney. His right knee has been
badly dislocated, and a cartilage torn.
This is the same trouble which both
ered Reeves all during last season.
Maloney intends to keep him out of a
suit for the next ten days at least.
Burns and Templeton will fill the
wing position during his absence
from the line-up.
The varsity squad, which practices
on the inside turf, has been reduced
to sixty men, including the two new
additions. Eight players were sent
outside today, this making the second
cut of the season.
E. Bacon, '15, and C. J. Single, both
members of Team A of the outside
squad, have been moved inside by
Coach Brown and Assistant Stubby
Stolz on account of their good show
ing during the past week. Bacon
plays the second five position, while
Single is a front ranker.
It is still a matter of doubt as to
whether "Jumbo" Blase, who has
locked the varsity pack together dur
ing the greater part of the games ear
lier in the season, but has been kept
from hard practice for the past two
weeks, will be able to play Saturday.
A painful muscle bruise in his should
er, is the cause of Blase's absence
f.rom the game.
The outside squad is now made up
of over one hundred and forty men.
which is an unwieldly number for one
man to handle. In spite of this fact
Stubby Stolz is watching his charges
closely, and giving ;ill likely players
chance to display the'r ability by plac
ing them inside with tho varsity squad.
The new system of retaining every
man out for .rugby has given an oppor
j tunity for development of a number of
promising candidates for either first
or second varsity honors.

The outside squad is now made up
of over one hundred and forty men.
which is an unwieldly number for one
man to handle. In spite of this fact
Stubby Stolz is watching his charges
closely, and giving ;ill likely players
chance to display the'r ability by plac
ing them inside with tho varsity squad.
The new system of retaining every
man out for .rugby has given an oppor
j tunity for development of a number of
promising candidates for either first
or second varsity honors.
W. S. Burns, '14, and F. F. Walker,
'18, have been promoted to places on
the football training table at the Phi
Gamma Delta house. This advance
ment comes as a well-merited re
ward for the showing made by these
players in last Saturday's games.
Burns, who made the sidelines last
fall as substitute for Erb and Tilton
in the halfback position, has been dis
playing fine form this season at wing
three-quarters. Substituting for Frank
Reeves in Saturday's scrimmage with
Santa Clara, he proved himself a fast
and heady player.
Walker captained the Freshman fif
teen this year in their "Baby Game"
with St. Mary's and has been con
sistently improving in his position at
half. He filled the berth behind tho
sc.rum in the Second Varsity game
against the Olympics last Saturday.
Next week-end will again see three
Stanford fifteens in action, two on the
turf, and one away from home. The
Varsity will find worthy opponents in
the Alumni Club, composed of former
collegiate players. The Second Varsity
will be given another hard game,
when they meet the Titan Club, which
afforded the California fifteen such a
warm contest Saturday. The Third
Varsity will journey to College Park,
San Jose, where they will play the
College of Pacific in their fourth con
test with this aggregation in the last
two months.
Tomorrow afternoon the Varsity
will be afforded good competition by
the Stanford All-Blacks, when a thir
ty-minute line-up will be indulged in
for the entertainment of the bleachers.
Owing to the fact that the second
team defeated the Olympic Club Sat
urday by a good margin, a hotly con
tested game may be anticipated.
The condition of Frank Reeves, var
sity wing, who was injured in Satur
day's contest with Santa Clara, is
causing considerable worry to Train
er Maloney. His right knee has been
badly dislocated, and a cartilage torn.
This is the same trouble which both
ered Reeves all during last season.
Maloney intends to keep him out of a
suit for the next ten days at least.
Burns and Templeton will fill the
wing position during his absence
from the line-up.
The varsity squad, which practices
on the inside turf, has been reduced
to sixty men, including the two new
additions. Eight players were sent
outside today, this making the second
cut of the season.
E. Bacon, '15, and C. J. Single, both
members of Team A of the outside
squad, have been moved inside by
Coach Brown and Assistant Stubby
Stolz on account of their good show
ing during the past week. Bacon
plays the second five position, while
Single is a front ranker.
It is still a matter of doubt as to
whether "Jumbo" Blase, who has
locked the varsity pack together dur
ing the greater part of the games ear
lier in the season, but has been kept
from hard practice for the past two
weeks, will be able to play Saturday.
A painful muscle bruise in his should
er, is the cause of Blase's absence
f.rom the game.
