# REINS OF RIVAL RUGBY CAMPS ARE TIGHTENING
## California vs. Santa Clara Focuses Interest VARSITY GOES TO BERKELEY Members of Training Table Practice This Afternoon on Blue and Gold Turfâ€”Watch St. Mary's Game 
### 
With only two more weeks remain- I
ins before the annual Stanford-Cali
fornia game, on November 14, the
reins are tightening about the rival
rugby camps at both institutions. The j
lUue and Gold varsity squad has been
cut to thirty-five men, while only sixty
candidates for Rig Game honors are
left before the watchful eye of Coach
Brown.
This noon the entire training table,
consisting of Captain Gard, Wines.,
Hall, Soper, Braden, Blase, Clover,
Pettingill. Wvlie, E.rb, Walker, Austin, '
Lachmund, Carroll, Burns, Reeves Ur
ban, Ogden. Templeton, and Andrews,
twenty men in all, went on the 12:45 j
train to Rerkeley, where they practiced
on the new California turf. Trainer
Maloney accompanied h's charges in
order to see that they got the propei
diet in their first meal off the campus. I
Light practice was indulged in by the
football men from three o'clock until
four. Thereafter the visiting Stanford
ruggers watched the California Varsity
in their game with St. Marys, making
the value of the trip two-fold. This
evening the sr|iiad will enjoy a vaude
ville performance at the San Francis
co Orpheum, and will .return to the J
campus on the theatre train.
Two more games are scheduled for
the Varsity previous to their final big
match with California, the Alumni fif
teen and the Olympic Club team still
remaining on deck. The greater bur
den of whipping the Varsity into shape,
will, therefore, rest with the second
string men. This afternoon the All-
Rlacks and the Third Varsity engaged
in a short line-up.
The interest of all rugby enthusiasts
is now centering on the coming game
Saturday between Santa Clara and Cal
ifornia. Upon the result of this con
test hinges the verdict, of many a rugby
critic as to the likely winner of the
Rig Game.
A closer and more evenly matched
struggle would be difficult to stage,
and all concur '"n the opinion that the
Rlue and Gold .ruggers will be forced
to the utmost limit to emerge victor
ious.
