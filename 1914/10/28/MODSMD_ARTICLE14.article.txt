# FOOTBALL FIELD DAT IS PLANNED FOR NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
The Varsity squad will probably be
put through a football field day early
next week. The suggestion has been
put to Coach Brown, who is in favor of
the idea.. Running, punting for dis
tance, punting for accuracy, drop
kicking for distance, drop-kicking for
accuracy, place-kicking for accuracy
and other events will be staged. Such
an afternoon's sport would prove of
interest to Stanford football followers,
as well as affording excellent practice.
The selection of the day and the list
of events will be announced later by
Coach Brown.
