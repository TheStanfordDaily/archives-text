"The football squad at Michigan has
been cut to twenty-five men." This
was a late item in a Chicago paper.
"The outside squad is now made up
of over one hundred and forty men,"
was the text of a rugby note in yester
day's issue of The Daily Palo Alto.
The point is obvious: the situation
in Michigan is typical of the larger
colleges of the east, for it is merely
the result of over-organization in ath
letics. The elimination of the men who
are below varsity caliber proceeds
steadily through the preliminary sea
son, and the more important contests
finds the squad cut to the all-import
tant twenty-five. The hope of the
community is centered on these play
ers—one per cent of the available ath
letic material is on the field, ninety
nine per cent are warming the bleach
ers, straining throats in demonical
shrieks and yells. Even the most en
thusiastic of the advocates of inter
collegiate competition can not say that
football in the hysterical stages is a
student activity—it is rather the spot
lighted circle in the college drama,
where all must aim for the one end,
Victory!
As fine a tribute as can be paid to
Stanford athletics lies in the numeric
al comparison of the two squads—in
the one case we have an athletic show
staged by near professionals, in the
second we have mute evidence of the
■worth of a system that tends to inter
est every man, to develop latent abili
ties, to give to all the season's training
that helps the player on the road to
appreciation of clean, hard play, good
sportsmanship, rugged health.
