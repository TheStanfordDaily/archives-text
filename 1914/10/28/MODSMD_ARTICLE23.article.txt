### 
Among Matthew Arnold's poems of
introspection are the following lines
011 self-dependence:
Weary of myself, and sick of asking
What I am and what I ought to be,
At the vessel's prow I stand, which
bears me
Forwards, forwards, o'er the starlight
sea.
And a look of passionate desire
O'er the sea and to the stars I send;
"Ye, who from childhood up have
claimed me.
Calm me, ah, compose me to the end!
"Ah, once more," I cried, "ye stars,
ye waters.
On my heart your mighty charm re
new;
Still, still let me gaze, as I gaze upon
you.
Peel my soul becoming vast like
you!"
From the intense, clear, star-sown
vault of heaven,
O'er the lit sea's unquiet way,
Tn the .rustling night air came the an
swer—
"Wouldst thou be as these are? Live
as they.
"Unaffrighted by the silence around
them,
Undistracted by the sights they see.
These demand not that the things
without them
Yield them love, amusement, sympa
thy.
"Bounded by themselves, and unre
gardful
Tn what state God's other works may
be,
Tn their own tasks all their powers
pouring,
These attain the mighty life you see."
"O, air born voice! long since, severely
clear,
A cry like thine in mine own heart T
liea.r —
'Resolve to be thyself: and know that
he
Who finds himself loses his misery.'"
