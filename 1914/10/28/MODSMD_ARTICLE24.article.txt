# Charactor of Coach Molds Nature of College Sports
## 
### 
Intercollegiate athletics do pay if
they are carried on in a clean, manly
way, under a good coach, according to
Professor A. W. Small, of the Univer
sity of Chicago, in his article on "The
Effects of Intercollegiate Athletics,"
in "Religious Education" for October,
1913.
"At least nine out of ten," he writes,
"judge colleges by their athletics, the
type of which they judge by the char
acter of the coach. Under normal con
ditions no other college official does
so much to make or mar the morals of
students as the coach. Testimonies of
students and of graduates about the
moral significance of the athletic de
partment must always be interpreted
as relative to the code which the coach
represents. The graduate's morals in
politics or in business will turn out
no better than his morals in athletic
training. Tt would be difficult to name
a problem that should be more vital
than the type of influence to which
the college is committed by the char
acter of the men who coach it.
"Real training, under a first-class
coach builds tip the whole man. Tt
teaches self-control; muscular co-ordi
nation; how to make and keep friends;
how to lose gracefully when neces
sary; how to win against great odds;
how to treat opponents courteously;
oncentration in study; intense loyalty;
how to be 'game;' to sacrifice (say
smoking) for the success of the team;
how to take orders from a superior;
the value of team-work; to mingle
easily with one's fellow students; to
gain grace of body; to see the foolish
ness of dissolute habits; steadiness;
squareness; how to cut down study
hotirs and yet to get more done with
out fatigue; how to combine mental
and physical powers; respect for the
powers of others; to think fast and
accurately: to hate Idleness; to like

college life; fairness in judgment for]
others, and to detect snobbishness anil I
selfishness through association with
real men. All this, and a sense of per- ]
sonal .responsibility."
