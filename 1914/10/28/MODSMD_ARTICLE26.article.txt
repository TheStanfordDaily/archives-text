United Press Telegraphic Report
New York, Oct. 28. —Two hundred
business men met at the Waldorf-As
toria today and adopted the slogan,
"Made in U. S. A.," to take the place
of the trademark "Made in America."
Miss Annie Peck, mountain climber
and explorer, is responsible for the
change. She said: "How ridiculous
it would be to say Urugay or Canada
are becoming Americanized. The
South Americans are just as much
Americans as we, and any slogan in
juring their feelings will injure our
trade."
