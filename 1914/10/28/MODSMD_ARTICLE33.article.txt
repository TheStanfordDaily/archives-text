### 
Eligibility to compete in athletics of
transfer students from junior col
leges has been brought to the atten- I
tion of Stanford. Vice-Principal E.
Owen, of the Los Angeles high school,
has written a letter to Dr. Frank An
gell, chairman of the Faculty Athletic
Committee, notifying him that it is
possible fo.r students of junior col
leges, which have a six-year course,
including two years of actual univer
sity work, to transfer to Stanford or
California, and either suffer from or
take an advantage of the Stanford-
California intercollegiate agreement,
which states that a transfer must .re
frain from intercollegiate athletics un
til such time as a year's residence has
been established at the university In
which they are registered.
Dr. Angell has turned the letter over
to Student Adviser Ambrose, remark- !
I ing that the proposition should p.rob- I
I ably be best brought up before the in- |
I tercollegiate agreement committee.
