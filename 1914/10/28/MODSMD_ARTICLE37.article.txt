# CALIFORNIA CAMPANILE, THREE HUNDRED FEET HIGH, NEARLY FINISHED
## Dr. Branner Pledges Stanford's Support to Amendment Granting State University More Funds. 
### 
Rapid progress is being made on the
Campanile building on the campus of
the University of California. Profes- j
sor John Galen Howard, head of the |
Department of Architecture, has desig
nated this building as the pivot of the I
new university structures. The steel \
girds are clothed with 115 tiers of j
granite blocks, and the carved stone j
which will form the frieze just below
the belvedere level has arrived and is
being putin place.
At this height, about 200 feet, a plat- 1
form will be reserved for observation
purposes, and will be surrounded by a
heavy stone railing. The clock, which
is to be placed eleven feet below the
present height of the granite is being
manufactured at an Eastern clock
works. The dial, which will be six
teen feet in diameter, will be set in
the granite itself.
Tn about six weeks all that will re
main to complete the structure will be
the placing of the marble above the
belvedere, and the finishing of the in
terior. The structure completed will
cost about $12.".000. Its topmost point
will l>e about 306 feet above the cam
pus level at the base.
Cheers greeted the reading in a
California assembly of a telegram from
President Branner, pledging Stanford's
support to amendment No. 11, which
provides an increased appropriation j
for the State University.
California now ranks as the largest ;
state university in America, the second
largest university in the United States,
and the eighth largest university in j
the world.
At present there are 4617 under- j
graduate students and 845 officers of j
administration and faculty members at |
California. The graduate students now
number 648.
