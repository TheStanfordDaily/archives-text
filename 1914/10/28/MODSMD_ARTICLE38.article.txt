# VISITING ALUMNUS CITES AMERICAN ADVENTURES IN NICARAGUAN WARS
## C.J. Peterson, '09, Tells Troubles of Engineers With Mud and Revolutions. 
### 
C. J. Peterson, '09, who is paying a
visit to the campus, has just returned
to the United States after residing for
several years in Nicaragua. In relat
ing his experiences, Peterson men
tioned several interesting and amusing
incidents. One concerns the part
played by two Americans in one of the
Centra] American, overnight, comic
opera-style revolutions.
The insurrection began at Blue
fields, Nicaragua, last August, the rev
olutionary force consisting of the two
American leaders and a native follow
ing. Commencing an attack on the
royal palace, the adventurers from the
United States found themselves desert
ed by their allies. Undaunted, however,
they renewed the attack unaided, and
captured the palace.
Next to the palace was a boarding
house, which unfortunately for its in
mates, was in the direct line of fire.
When bullets began zipping through
(he plaster, the boarders hastily bunt
ed places of safety. One, a school
teacher from Boston, took refuge in the
porcelain bathtub.
The following day the Americans
were captured, the palace re-occupied
by royalty and order restored by ma
rines from the IT. S. gunboat Buffalo.
Speaking of the climate, Peterson
mentioned the fact that it was exceed
ingly muddy all the time, owing to the
two hundred-inch rainfall. Each mine,
lie stated, keeps a wrecking gang on
hand with derrick and block and tackle
to rescue engineers, who become mired.
The field men often sink waist, deep
in the sticky mud. and can only be re
moved by mechanical means.
Peterson, who graduated in Mining,
has been doing "exploration work in
Nicaragua for the Tonopah Mining
Company, of Nevada.
