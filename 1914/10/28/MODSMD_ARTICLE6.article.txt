# JUNIORS CONFIRM ORIGINAL DATE SET FOR PLUG UGLY
## Important Meeting Will Be Held Tomorrow to Discuss Plans for Rush. 
### 
Junior men met this afternoon and
! decided specifically to hold the Plug
Ugly on the date originally set for the
interclass battle by the committee in
charge. This date is November 7â€”
just one week before the Rig Game.
The Juniors will lay thei.r posters as
usual on the night before.
Enough plugs have been ordered
from the East to supply all the men
| of the class, with tbose that can be
j procured in Palo Alto. These plugs
will arrive on the campus in time to
be painted and used in the rush.
The meeting this afternoon was very
poorly attended, only thirty men being
present, and this fact, made it difficult
to arrive at any definite stand on the
opinion of the class, as a whole, in
regard to the Plug Ugly. The action,
however, was only taken after careful
consideration on the part of those
present.
Another meeting of the Juniors will
be held in room 214 of the History
building tomorrow for a discussion of
the Plug Ugly plans. Student Adviser
Ambrose will lie present to address the
meeting. It will be necessary to have
all Juniors present to consider the
propositions he will advance.
The meeting will be held right after
luncheon, at 1:10, and will adjourn in
time for all afternoon classes. The
president of the class offers a personal
I appeal to all .luniors to attend, as the
meeting is one of the most important
j assemblies of the year.
