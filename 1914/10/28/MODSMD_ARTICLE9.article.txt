# INTERCOLLEGIATE TRIO OF DEBATERS CHOSEN
## Will Meet Blue and Gold on November 20th COACH OWENS PICKS TEAM A.F. Coyle, '15, A.J. Hettinger, '16, and W.L. Miller, '17, Are Selected to Represent Stanford 
### 
A. F. Coyle, '15, A. J. Hettinger, '16,
and W. L. Miller, '17, have been chosen
by debating coach, W. B. Owens, '14,
to represent Stanford in the Intercol
legiate Debate with California on No
vember 20. This team has been picked

from the squad of
fifteen or sixteen
men, who orig
ina 11 y tried
out, after weeks
of study and drill
on the question,
which will be de
bated in the clash
with the blue and
Sold. In the opin
ion of the coach
these men will

make a strong bid for a favorable
decision, as they are an extremely well
balanced team.
Coyle is probably the most experi
enced debater in Stanford today. lie
has led the intercollegiate Debate for
the past two years, and, with his col
leagues, has succeeded in securing a
victory both times. He was a member
of the Tri-state team in his Freshman
year, and also debated for his class
against the Sophomores. Last year
he competed for the Carnot Medal.
Hettinger has also had considerable

experience in de
bate, being alter
nate on the Inter
collegiate team last
year, and a contes
tant for Carnot hon
ors as well. He
was also a mem
ber of his Sopho
more team.
Miller, while a

debater of but little experience at Stan
ford, has developed a very creditable
power during the past few weeks. He
debated on his Freshman team last
year.
The work of A. E. Steadman, '15, E.
S. Sanden, '18, and M. Crobaugh, MS,
while not quite up to the standard set
by these men, still showed promise.
These men will constitute a second
team during the weeks to come before
the contest, and will oppose the first
team in practice debates.
