There is a Great
Difference in Tobaccos
Tuxedo is the Mildest, Sweetest, Most
Pleasant Smoke in the World, Because—
First — No one but the makers of
I uxedo is willing to spend the
money necessary to buy the mildest,
choicest, most thoroughly aged,
selected Burley tobacco.
Second—No one but the makers of
Tuxedo knows how to treat this Bur
ley tobacco so that every bit of pleas
antness and goodness remains in the
tobacco and every bit of unpleasant
ness and harshness is taken out.
The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
Tuxedo was born in 1904. Its
first imitator appeared two years
later. Since then a host of imita
tions have been born and are clam
oring for your patronage.
No imitation is ever as good as the
original. No amount of advertising,
no amount of bluster and bluff, can
ever make an imitation tobacco as
good as Tuxedo.
If you are not a pipe smoker, you
are denying yourself the greatest
smoking pleasure known to man.
Try Tuxedo in your pipe this week.
YOU CAN BUY TUXEDO EVERYWHERE

"Tuxedo is mild, cool
and soothing—just the sort
of tobacco I need. Tuxedo
goes with me wherever I go. "

"Why shouldn't a man
be willing to recommend a
tobacco which gives as cool,
sweet and satisfying a
as Tuxedo ?"
