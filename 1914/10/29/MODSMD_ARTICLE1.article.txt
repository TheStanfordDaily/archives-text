## Special United Press Wire Will Follow Important Political Issues at a Big Get-Together Tuesday in Assembly Hall VAUDEVILLE TO ADD ZEST Refreshments to Be Distributed by Sororities and Clubs For Benefit of Women's Reading Room 
### 
Say, are you a dry? Not in the or
dinary campus sense, perhaps, but
aren't you interested in the outcome of
the election next Tuesday? Or are you
a wet? These are questions which
must be decided by 230 campus voters
before November 3.
White Hot Wire Flashes,
Hot from the special United Press
Leased Wire complete returns of the
election will be flashed at a big "get
together" rally to be held next Tues
day evening in the Assembly Hall, un
der the auspices of The Daily Palo
Alto. Promptly at eight o'clock the
doors will be opened to the political
partisans, students, voters, and cam
pus visitors, and almost immediately
the big audience will enjoy the detailed
and accurate election returns.
Every bulletin from the first incom
plete returns until the operator in
San Francisco clicks "thirty," and goes
home, will be flashed on the screen.
The wires will be at white heat all ev
ening, and the final returns will prob
ably not be flashed until one o'clock.
Vaudeville Between Bulletins.
A brisk and novel program of origin
al musical and comedy stunts will en
liven the pauses between bulletins.
Miss Mary Gard, '15, and Miss Do.rothy
Egbert, '15, will offer a clever and at
tractive dance specialty. Another par
ticularly interesting novelty will be a
highly original stunt by several mem
bers of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority.
Ram's Head will also be represented
by a vaudeville offering up to its usu
al standard, while selections by the
Schube.rt Club, the men's quartette,
and a stringed quintette are also prom
ised.
Women to Offer "Fats."
Light refreshments will be distrib
uted by a bevy of representatives from
the various sororities and women's
clubs of the campus. "Hot dogs," cor
nucopias, popcorn and peanuts will be
among the delicacies offered for sale
at a mere pittance, and the profits will
be devoted to furnishing a .reading
room in the new Woman's Clubhouse.
The Women's Press Club is in charge
of this feature of the evening, the com
mittee being composed of Miss Lois
McCoy, '15, and Miss Anita Allen, '17.
A huge reflectoscope will be used in
flashing the returns of the election
and photographs and pictures of cur
rent interest will be much in evidence.
As the time draws near for the big
rally plans for a particular snappy
entertainment are being perfected by
the committee in charge of arrange
ments. This committee is composed
of C. W. Hatch, 'Ifi, J. C. Cross, '17, G.
K. Howard, '17. C. .T. Single. '17. and
W. .T. Gross. '16. chairman.
Wet aiul Dry Issue Important.
Political interest on the campus
will undoubtedly center in the fight
between the wet and dry factions in
California, and in the contest fo.r the
position of state executive between
Governor Hiram W. Johnson. Captain
John Fredericks, of Los Angeles, and
Hon. John B. Curtin, of Tuolumne
County. Other important issues are
the fight for U. S. Senator between
James D. Phelan and Francis J. Heney.
Congressman E. A. Hayes, of San Jose,
and L. D. Bohnett, ex-'OG are in the
race for U. S. Congressman from this
district. Edgerton Lakin, '08, and Dan
Hayes are contesting for election to
the assembly from this district. George
E. Crothers, '95, formerly a secretary
of the Stanford Board of Trustees, is
in the running for Superior Judge in
the city and county of San Francisco.
Seventy-five vote.rs are registered
on the campus, while seventy-one men
students and sixty-nine professors liv
ing in Palo Alto will also be entitled
to vote, making a total registration of
230, a large increase over last year,
owing to the important wet and dry
issue.
Reading' Room Will Benefit.
The profits from the rally and in
cidental entertainment will be devot
ed to furnishing a periodical and read
ing room in the Stanford Union. The
present funds are wholly inadequate
for the equipment of many library
necessities, including book-covers and
newspaper files, and the money for
this purpose is a pressing need.
Political partisans of Palo Alto and
the near-by towns will be on hand
to mingle their cheers and enthusiasm
with those of the students.

aren't you interested in the outcome of
the election next Tuesday? Or are you
a wet? These are questions which
must be decided by 230 campus voters
before November 3.
White Hot Wire Flashes,
Hot from the special United Press
Leased Wire complete returns of the
election will be flashed at a big "get
together" rally to be held next Tues
day evening in the Assembly Hall, un
der the auspices of The Daily Palo
Alto. Promptly at eight o'clock the
doors will be opened to the political
partisans, students, voters, and cam
pus visitors, and almost immediately
the big audience will enjoy the detailed
and accurate election returns.
Every bulletin from the first incom
plete returns until the operator in
San Francisco clicks "thirty," and goes
home, will be flashed on the screen.
The wires will be at white heat all ev
ening, and the final returns will prob
ably not be flashed until one o'clock.
Vaudeville Between Bulletins.
A brisk and novel program of origin
al musical and comedy stunts will en
liven the pauses between bulletins.
Miss Mary Gard, '15, and Miss Do.rothy
Egbert, '15, will offer a clever and at
tractive dance specialty. Another par
ticularly interesting novelty will be a
highly original stunt by several mem
bers of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority.
Ram's Head will also be represented
by a vaudeville offering up to its usu
al standard, while selections by the
Schube.rt Club, the men's quartette,
and a stringed quintette are also prom
ised.
Women to Offer "Fats."
Light refreshments will be distrib
uted by a bevy of representatives from
the various sororities and women's
clubs of the campus. "Hot dogs," cor
nucopias, popcorn and peanuts will be
among the delicacies offered for sale
at a mere pittance, and the profits will
be devoted to furnishing a .reading
room in the new Woman's Clubhouse.
The Women's Press Club is in charge
of this feature of the evening, the com
mittee being composed of Miss Lois
McCoy, '15, and Miss Anita Allen, '17.
A huge reflectoscope will be used in
flashing the returns of the election
and photographs and pictures of cur
rent interest will be much in evidence.
As the time draws near for the big
rally plans for a particular snappy
entertainment are being perfected by
the committee in charge of arrange
ments. This committee is composed
of C. W. Hatch, 'Ifi, J. C. Cross, '17, G.
K. Howard, '17. C. .T. Single. '17. and
W. .T. Gross. '16. chairman.
Wet aiul Dry Issue Important.
Political interest on the campus
will undoubtedly center in the fight
between the wet and dry factions in
California, and in the contest fo.r the
position of state executive between
Governor Hiram W. Johnson. Captain
John Fredericks, of Los Angeles, and
Hon. John B. Curtin, of Tuolumne
County. Other important issues are
the fight for U. S. Senator between
James D. Phelan and Francis J. Heney.
Congressman E. A. Hayes, of San Jose,
and L. D. Bohnett, ex-'OG are in the
race for U. S. Congressman from this
district. Edgerton Lakin, '08, and Dan
Hayes are contesting for election to
the assembly from this district. George
E. Crothers, '95, formerly a secretary
of the Stanford Board of Trustees, is
in the running for Superior Judge in
the city and county of San Francisco.
Seventy-five vote.rs are registered
on the campus, while seventy-one men
students and sixty-nine professors liv
ing in Palo Alto will also be entitled
to vote, making a total registration of
230, a large increase over last year,
owing to the important wet and dry
issue.
Reading' Room Will Benefit.
The profits from the rally and in
cidental entertainment will be devot
ed to furnishing a periodical and read
ing room in the Stanford Union. The
present funds are wholly inadequate
for the equipment of many library
necessities, including book-covers and
newspaper files, and the money for
this purpose is a pressing need.
Political partisans of Palo Alto and
the near-by towns will be on hand
to mingle their cheers and enthusiasm
with those of the students.
