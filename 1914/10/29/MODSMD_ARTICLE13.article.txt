London, Oct. 29. —Additional war
ships have been sent to the Channel
ports on the northwest coast of France
to support the allies in a new attack,
which has apparently been planned
upon the Teutons from these ports.
The Germans have undoubtedly
massed submarines and light torpedo
boats in the canal between Bruges
and Zeebrugge, to be used in sallies
upon the Channel fleet. It is also re
ported that they are moving a large
part of their airship fleet to Belgium.
Both of these moves are in accordance
with the Kaiser's plan of an attack
upon England.
Physical Exhaustion Causes Lull.
Paris, Oct. 29. —Physical exhaustion
is seriously interfering with the fight
ing in the northern part of France
and in Belgium, and causing it to slow
up along the entire west wing. The
German losses far exceed those of the
allies, but the Teuton second line is
still intact. The allies have not at
tempted a general advance along the
entire front. Both sides are taking
advantage of the present lull to bring
up reinforcements. Thousands of Ger
man reserves are crossing into Bel
gium, and these are expected to help in
an attempt upon the Allied line be
tween Nieuport, on the f'Oflpt, and Dix
munde, ten miles southeast, and be
tween Lille, south of th>%pjgian bor
der. and Arras, thirty miles south. The
Germans are undoubtedly contemplat

Petrograd, Oct. 29.—The entire army
of the Czar is taking the offense
against the Austro-German line. Ad

that the Russian center and right are
repelling the Teutons from lines which
have been much advanced and which,
in the north, have been pushed into
German territory. After a week of
fighting along the river San, which
flows through central Galicia, the

London, Oct. 29. —Additional war
ships have been sent to the Channel
ports on the northwest coast of France
to support the allies in a new attack,
which has apparently been planned
upon the Teutons from these ports.
The Germans have undoubtedly
massed submarines and light torpedo
boats in the canal between Bruges
and Zeebrugge, to be used in sallies
upon the Channel fleet. It is also re
ported that they are moving a large
part of their airship fleet to Belgium.
Both of these moves are in accordance
with the Kaiser's plan of an attack
upon England.
Physical Exhaustion Causes Lull.
Paris, Oct. 29. —Physical exhaustion
is seriously interfering with the fight
ing in the northern part of France
and in Belgium, and causing it to slow
up along the entire west wing. The
German losses far exceed those of the
allies, but the Teuton second line is
still intact. The allies have not at
tempted a general advance along the
entire front. Both sides are taking
advantage of the present lull to bring
up reinforcements. Thousands of Ger
man reserves are crossing into Bel
gium, and these are expected to help in
an attempt upon the Allied line be
tween Nieuport, on the f'Oflpt, and Dix
munde, ten miles southeast, and be
tween Lille, south of th>%pjgian bor

Germans are undoubtedly contemplat

Emden entered the port of Penang. in
the Straits Settlement, with the Jap

pedoed the Russian cruiser Jemtchug
and a French destroyer, both of which
sank. The fata 11 itios will reach a large

Austrians Generally Repulsed.
Petrograd, Oct. 29.—The entire army
of the Czar is taking the offense
against the Austro-German line. Ad
vices from the front indicate that the
Russian left is enveloping the Aus
trians in Galicia. Further claim is
that the Russian center and right are
repelling the Teutons from lines which
have been much advanced and which,
in the north, have been pushed into
German territory. After a week of
fighting along the river San, which
flows through central Galicia, the
Austrians have commenced.to retreat
