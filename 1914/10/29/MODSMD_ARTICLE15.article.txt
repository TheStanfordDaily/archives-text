Water, water, everywhere, and not a
drop to drink—is usually not a happy
state of affairs. Yet today the weath
er man and old Neptune are in perfect
accord with their campus disciples, for
there is moisture in abundance and
imbibition is no more than ordinarily
difficult. With the first wintry rain
of the autumn comes the assurance of
the reality of our outdoor swimming
tank, the announcement of the appro
priation of a substantial sum for tbe
construction.
The clear, green-tinged depths of a
filtered water plunge, open to all men
of tbe University is no longer the
vision of a wild imagination, the va
gary of a disordered mind, for fifteen
hundred dollars is a herculean shove
along the road to realization. That
amount on the books of the swimming
tank committee is practically a final
assurance of speedy construction and
ultimate perfection.
The remainder of the necessary fund
of twenty-five Hundred seems likely to
come from tke pockets of those most
willing to pay, jthe habitues of the big
tank. The plan in favor at this time
is the gradual payment of the debt
by receipts from admission tickets, the
charge for use of the tank to be made
until the is clear. This meth
od is manifestly fair to all interested,
and should be easy of application.
There is one rut in the road that may
give the wagon a jolting—the necessi
ty of obtaining the formal assertion of
the Board of Trustees as to their willing
ness to enlarge the filtration plant.
But the bump may be smoothed before
the crossing—at last we're close
enough to see the Splash.
