# After the Game
## 
### 
The effervescence of "After the
Game" spirit has been imprisoned in
these lines by M. A. de Wolf Howe.
The author was graduated from Har
vard in 1887, and has since been edi
tor of the Youth's Companion and as
sistant editor of the Atlantic Monthly.
Pounding away in a rythm bound as in
fetters of brass
Marches the band; —behind it, the
wildly rythmical mass
Of headlong happiest youth with hats
flung high through the space
Where the conquering ball had sailed,
with arms chance-linked for the
race
To join the swirling, delirious, ser
pentine measure of joy
That wells from the leaping heart of
each precipitate boy.
What sends from my older heart the
mist to my musing eyes?
Not envy, I think, for all that my nig
gardly age denies;
But something akin to pity—even at
this flaming hour
Filled with the triumph of sharing
the joy of triumphant power—
Pity that ever the jubilant springs
must fail of their flow,
And that youth, so utterly knowing it
not, must one day know.
