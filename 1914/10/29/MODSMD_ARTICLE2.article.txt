# BOVINE DAMSELS ISSUE BIDS FOR CHRISTENING BEE ON LATHROP ESTATE
## Dairy Herd to Be Graced Hereafter With Dainty Parisian Nom de Plumes 
### 
There's more in a name than most of
us claim, says the latest mandate from
the Lathrop estate. Furthermore,
it's too saucy to call a cow "Bossy;"
a bovine's a pet and it'll come around
yet that kine will he blest with names
like the rest of the victims of style
that fashions beguile.
Casting all joking and poetry aside,
this becomes a serious matter. Bovines
on the Lathrop Farm will no longer
answer to the name of Bossie. Nevaire!
Not these cows! Henceforth they will
be known as Marceline, .Teanette, Mad
aline, Clementine, or Henriette.
Cows are gentle brutes and thrive
better on polite names. They give
more milk, and it of better quality,
under the stimulation of an elite cog
nomen. Since her name has been
changed to Fifi one young heifer has
been producing pure cream, according
to Rudolph, the milkman, who hence
forth will wear silk gloves around the
stable.
How to label the kine until the
names can be learned is the new prob
lem presented for solution. One sug
gestion is that vanity boxes be pro
vided for each cow. Names could be
engraved on the sides of these, if the
latest models in the form of miniature
trunks were used.
It is also expected that manicurists
will soon be engaged to polish the
horns of Claire, Hortense. Marie, and
Jean. Mirrors will probably be put
up also in the corners of the field
where Gaby Deluge can prepare her
toilet while chewing her cud, thus
killing two birds at the same time.
All this because the Lathrop cows
are being given French names.
