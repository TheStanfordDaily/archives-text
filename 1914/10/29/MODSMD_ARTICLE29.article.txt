# FOLLOWING THE TEAM
## 
### 
The twenty Stanford rugge.rs who
journeyed to Berkeley yesterday after
noon enjoyed a valuable half hours'
practice on the enemy's turf. Every
member of the training table, includ
ing the two "cripples," Reeves and
Blase, and also Coach Floyd Brown,
Harry Maloney, arid Manager Wilcox,
went on the trip.
First Practice Indulged In.
From three-thirty to four o'clock,
when the Blue and Gold field was to be
used for the St. Mary's-California j
game, the Varsity footballers were put
through their paces by the coach. The
day's work-out consisted chiefly of i
practice in kick-offs, drop-outs, line- i
outs, scrums, cross-kicking, and pass- |
ing. According to all reports the men '
were in fine fettle, displaying no vis- j
ible evidence of the ha.vd struggle with
Santa Clara last Saturday.
California Turf Is Revelation.
The new turf was a revelation to the j
veterans who played in the never-to- j
be-forgotten mud tie two years ago.
The work of the backfield was fast '
and clean-cut, while the forwards cov- !
ered the ground with a burst of speed
in their numerous dribbling rushes.
Quite a crowd of interested California
spectators watched the Stanford play- j
ers in their practice.
Illne and Gold Varsity Plays.
Following their brief work-out, the |
travelers witnessed the contest be- !
tween St. Mary's and California, in
which the latter emerged victorious
by a 24 to 3 score. Coach Schaffer
used the strongest line-up which he j
has sent into the game this season to
represent the Blue and Gold, and as a
result the visiting Cardinal ruggers
were afforded an excellent opportunity
to size up the ability of their rivals.
After taking dinner at the Hofbrau
Cafe, in San Francisco, the men were
treated to the performance of "The
Rollicking Girl" at the Gaiety Thea
ter.
The players returned to the campus
late last evening on the theater train.
Though training rules were temporar
ily broken, the effect on the men was
of a beneficial rather than harmful
effect, since a little spice was injected
into the regular order of events.
Selection of Referee Is Problem.
The selection of a referee for the
Big Game on November 14 is becom
ing a great problem for Managers Wil
cox and Stroud to solve. Owing to the
heavy expense of bringing W. W. Hill,
who held the whistle In the last two
intercollegiate games, over to this
country f.rom New Zealand, a local
referee must be chosen. At present
there are four men eligible for the po
sition. Reading, Lafferty, Mullineaux,
and Howard, a new man from Cuper
tino, who is a veteran at the game.
Mullineaux and Reading are both ac
ceptable to Stanford, but as yet Cali
fornia has not shown her hand on the
question.
Mullineaux and Rending Eligible.
Yesterday Graduate Manager Wilcox
conferred with Manager Stroud, of
California, concerning the selection of
some one for the position, but no defi
nite understanding could be reached.
If Santa Clara will consent to Mullin
eaux, as the official for next Satur
day's game with California, he will be
given a try-out by the Blue and Gold
authorities. It is a matter of doubt,
however, as to whether Santa Clara
will consent to lr's refereeing the con
test. As practically only two more
weeks remain before the Big Game,
the problem is becoming a source of
worry to the managers of both univer
sities.

Mullineaux and Rending Eligible.
Yesterday Graduate Manager Wilcox
conferred with Manager Stroud, of
California, concerning the selection of
some one for the position, but no defi
nite understanding could be reached.
If Santa Clara will consent to Mullin
eaux, as the official for next Satur
day's game with California, he will be
given a try-out by the Blue and Gold
authorities. It is a matter of doubt,
however, as to whether Santa Clara
will consent to lr's refereeing the con
test. As practically only two more
weeks remain before the Big Game,
the problem is becoming a source of
worry to the managers of both univer
sities.
The twenty Stanford rugge.rs who
journeyed to Berkeley yesterday after
noon enjoyed a valuable half hours'
practice on the enemy's turf. Every
member of the training table, includ
ing the two "cripples," Reeves and
Blase, and also Coach Floyd Brown,
Harry Maloney, arid Manager Wilcox,
went on the trip.
First Practice Indulged In.
From three-thirty to four o'clock,
when the Blue and Gold field was to be
used for the St. Mary's-California j
game, the Varsity footballers were put
through their paces by the coach. The
day's work-out consisted chiefly of i
practice in kick-offs, drop-outs, line- i
outs, scrums, cross-kicking, and pass- |
ing. According to all reports the men '
were in fine fettle, displaying no vis- j
ible evidence of the ha.vd struggle with
Santa Clara last Saturday.
California Turf Is Revelation.
The new turf was a revelation to the j
veterans who played in the never-to- j
be-forgotten mud tie two years ago.
The work of the backfield was fast '
and clean-cut, while the forwards cov- !
ered the ground with a burst of speed
in their numerous dribbling rushes.
Quite a crowd of interested California
spectators watched the Stanford play- j
ers in their practice.
Illne and Gold Varsity Plays.
Following their brief work-out, the |
travelers witnessed the contest be- !
tween St. Mary's and California, in
which the latter emerged victorious
by a 24 to 3 score. Coach Schaffer
used the strongest line-up which he j
has sent into the game this season to
represent the Blue and Gold, and as a
result the visiting Cardinal ruggers
were afforded an excellent opportunity
to size up the ability of their rivals.
After taking dinner at the Hofbrau
Cafe, in San Francisco, the men were
treated to the performance of "The
Rollicking Girl" at the Gaiety Thea
ter.
The players returned to the campus
late last evening on the theater train.
Though training rules were temporar
ily broken, the effect on the men was
of a beneficial rather than harmful
effect, since a little spice was injected
into the regular order of events.
Selection of Referee Is Problem.
The selection of a referee for the
Big Game on November 14 is becom
ing a great problem for Managers Wil
cox and Stroud to solve. Owing to the
heavy expense of bringing W. W. Hill,
who held the whistle In the last two
intercollegiate games, over to this
country f.rom New Zealand, a local
referee must be chosen. At present
there are four men eligible for the po
sition. Reading, Lafferty, Mullineaux,
and Howard, a new man from Cuper
tino, who is a veteran at the game.
Mullineaux and Reading are both ac
ceptable to Stanford, but as yet Cali
fornia has not shown her hand on the
question.
