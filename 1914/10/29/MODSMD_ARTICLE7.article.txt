## Executive Committee Makes an Appropriation to Cover the Initial Expense of Starting Construction on New Project GUERENA MADE CREW COACH Band and Glee Club Authorized to Lend Aid at the Palace Hotel Dansant Evening of December 6th 
### 
The new out-door plunge for the
men of the University is now a cer
tainty. The Executive Committee, at
last night's meeting, appropriated fif
teen hundred dollars for the construc
tion of the pool and appointed a com
mittee to provide for raising the re
maining sum necessary to complete
the work. Since the construction will
cost about twenty-five hundred dollars,
the sum to be raised will not exceed
one thousand dollars. Donation of
services by instructors in the Engin
eer ng Departments will reduce the
amount to a minimum.
Admission to lie Charged.
Various methods are planned by
which the sum will be raised. One of
these is the assignment of an admis
sion fee oi twenty-five cents for the
usr of the plunge. Uis expected that
this rule will be kept in force for a
year. The other methods to be used
in augmenting the fund are being rap
idly outlined, and will soon be pre
sented to the student body.
Graduate Manager Wilcox has al
ready been authorized to obtain infor
mation about the proper size and the

approximate cost of the plunge from
the University of California, and from
other sources, and his report will be
ready in a few days.
The graduate manager is also com
municating with tfanderlynn Stow,
treasurer of the Board of Trustees, in
regard to doubling the size of the fil
tration plant, which will be erected for
gymnasium use. This assistance from
the Roard of Trustees is the last step
needed to assure the completion of the
plunge, and a way is provided for mak
ing the Searsville water suitable for
bathing.
The position of the plunge will be
in close proximity to the new men's
gymnasium, which will make it, in
reality, an annex of that structure.
The approximate size of the plunge
will be about thirty by due hundred
feet. Sufficient space has already been
set aside by the Roard of Trustees to
place such a tank near tlie gymnasium,
and its construction will be carried on
simultaneously with that of the gym
nasium.
Guemtii is Crew Coach.
F. L. Guerena, '11, was chosen as
crew coach for the coming year, and
the graduate manager was authorized
to enter into immediate negotiations

with him concerning his work. Guer
ena coached the varsity oarsmen last
spring, and brought them out ahead
of California in the triangular regat
ta between Washington, California, and
Stanford. The Freshman crew, under
his guidance, was successful in de
feating the baby crews of Washing
ton and California last April.
During his college career, Guerena
"coxed" several Stanford crews.
Among these were the Freshman crew
of 1911 and the varsities of 1909.
1911, and 1912. He also guided the
Stanford eight which rowed at Poug
keepsie in 1912.
Student Body to Aid Clinic.
The dansant at the Palace Hotel, to
be given on December G for the bene
fit of the Stanford clinic is to be
backed officially by the Stanford Stu
dent Body, inasmuch as the Executive
Committee moved that the Band and
Glee C1 til) be authorized to appear at
this function, and that their railroad
expenses lie paid, provided that the or
ganizations consent to be fully repre
sented. The funds ra'sed by the dan
sant will be used for the continuation
of the social service work carried on
by the clinics, in connection with their
regular medical work.
The purpose of the Stanford clinics
is to give relief in cases of patients,
who are dismissed from the clinic de
partments of Lane Hospital. Many of
these patients are unable to work for
a time after their dismissal, and find
difficulty in securing employment once
they are in fit condition. The families

of these patients, dependent upon the
labor of the head of the family, also
suffer greatly during both the time the
provider is confined in the hospital
and the recuperative period.
The Alumni Association has organ
, ized to further this important work,
and the Campus Auxiliary Association
j provides a means for the Student Body
to assist in this field.
Sen Songs Will He Published.
Assistance will be given to Cap and
I Gown in their task of publishing a
new book of Stanford songs. The Ex
ecutive Committee appropriated seven
ty-five dollars as a loan to the wo
men's organization for this purpose.
Cap and Gown will publish a work
containing not only the older songs,
familiar to generations of Stanford
alumni, but also including the th.ree
new bleacher songs composed this fall.
"The Cardinal Is Waving," by W. G.
Paul, '15; "The Victorious Cardinal,"

tlial '16, and the new bleacher song by

fore the student body for the first time
in complete form.
Football Day Sanctioned.

planned for next week, received the
approval of the Executive Committee,
and a committee was appointed to con
fer with Coach Brown on this matter.
It is planned to stage running, punting
for distance, punting for accuracy,
