### 
The new out-door plunge for the
men of the University is now a cer
tainty. The Executive Committee, at
last night's meeting, appropriated fif
teen hundred dollars for the construc
tion of the pool and appointed a com
mittee to provide for raising the re
maining sum necessary to complete
the work. Since the construction will
cost about twenty-five hundred dollars,
the sum to be raised will not exceed
one thousand dollars. Donation of
services by instructors in the Engin
eer ng Departments will reduce the
amount to a minimum.
Admission to lie Charged.
Various methods are planned by
which the sum will be raised. One of
these is the assignment of an admis
sion fee oi twenty-five cents for the
usr of the plunge. Uis expected that
this rule will be kept in force for a
year. The other methods to be used
in augmenting the fund are being rap
idly outlined, and will soon be pre
sented to the student body.
Graduate Manager Wilcox has al
ready been authorized to obtain infor
mation about the proper size and the

approximate cost of the plunge from
the University of California, and from
other sources, and his report will be
ready in a few days.
The graduate manager is also com
municating with tfanderlynn Stow,
treasurer of the Board of Trustees, in
regard to doubling the size of the fil
tration plant, which will be erected for
gymnasium use. This assistance from
the Roard of Trustees is the last step
needed to assure the completion of the
plunge, and a way is provided for mak
ing the Searsville water suitable for
bathing.
The position of the plunge will be
in close proximity to the new men's
gymnasium, which will make it, in
reality, an annex of that structure.
The approximate size of the plunge
will be about thirty by due hundred
feet. Sufficient space has already been
set aside by the Roard of Trustees to
place such a tank near tlie gymnasium,
and its construction will be carried on
simultaneously with that of the gym
nasium.

the graduate manager was authorized
to enter into immediate negotiations
