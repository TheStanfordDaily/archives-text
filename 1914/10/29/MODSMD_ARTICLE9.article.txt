# JUNIORS ACCEPT DATE FIXED FOR PLUG UGLY
## Finance Committee Corners Supply of Hats-Will Distribute Them on Monday. 
### 
The Junior class decided to accept
November 7 as the date for this year's
Plug Ugly, at its meeting this after
noon. As usual, the posters will be
put down the night before the rush, on
November G.
The 1910 finance committee has
bought up all the plugs available ; .n
the vicinity. At 1:30 next Monday af
ternoon a drawing will be held at the
Peta Theta Pi house for the purpose
of distributing these hats. They wlil
be given to the men holding lucky
numbers, upon the payment of a small
fee. The committee hopes to have oth
er plugs here in time for the rush, so
that all members of the class will be
able to secure them.
A. W. Ambrose, '13, addressed the
meeting in regard to the rush, to the
effect that, although the Plug Ugly had
been curtailed in some interesting de
tails, such as the show, it had been
brought back this year for a fixed pur
pose. This purpose is to stir up en
thusiasm amongst the members of the
upper classes, to make up for the lack
of life, which has been so noticeable
this semester.
All members of the Junior class who
have not already paid their dues, are
urged to do so at once, to enable the
.rush committee to pay for posters.
