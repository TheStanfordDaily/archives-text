Not since the first political rally in
1892, when campus politicians stayed
up all night to follow the defeat of
Benjamin Harrison by Grover Cleve
land in the presidential race of that
year, has more interest been manifest
ed in an election than that already
shown in the big rally scheduled for
next Tuesday. The Daily Palo Alto
has leased the United Press Wire for
the convenience of local partisans,
who will be able to follow the progress
of the election in minute detail, by

succession in the Assembly Hall.

According to a telegram received to
day from Washington, D. C., the head
quarters of the Anti-Saloon League of
America, the prohibitionists are con
fident of victory in the states of Wash
ington, Oregon and Orizoua, but doubt
ful of the outcome in California, and
hopeful of the returns in Ohio. They
admit that the issue is difficult in Col
orado, where strong interests are back
ing the wets. The principal fight, they
believe, is being waged in Ohio, which
is the largest state in which the fight
for prohibition has yet been waged. If
Ohio should go dry the prohibitionists
would be well on the way to national
victory.
The fight for supremacy in Califor
nia between the wet and dry factions
is still uppermost in political circles.
