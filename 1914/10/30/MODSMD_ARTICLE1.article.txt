# BIG RALLY ATTRACTS POLITICAL PARTISANS
## Contest Between Wets and Drys Only Rivaled in Publicity by Race For State Executive MANY ALUMNI INTERESTED Unique Situation Discovered in Palo Alto Where Women Voters Enjoy Balance of Power 
### 
Not since the first political rally in
1892, when campus politicians stayed
up all night to follow the defeat of
Benjamin Harrison by Grover Cleve
land in the presidential race of that
year, has more interest been manifest
ed in an election than that already
shown in the big rally scheduled for
next Tuesday. The Daily Palo Alto
has leased the United Press Wire for
the convenience of local partisans,
who will be able to follow the progress
of the election in minute detail, by
watching the returns flashed in quick
succession in the Assembly Hall.
Stunts Enliven Pauses.
Clever specialties will bid for pop
ular favor between bulletins. Campus
talent will appear in a series of artistic
musical offerings and a variety of
comedy "stunts." Light refreshment.,
will be served by the representatives
of the sororities and clubs. An ad
mission fee of fifteen cents will be
charged.
According to a telegram received to
day from Washington, D. C., the head
quarters of the Anti-Saloon League of
America, the prohibitionists are con
fident of victory in the states of Wash
ington, Oregon and Orizoua, but doubt
ful of the outcome in California, and
hopeful of the returns in Ohio. They
admit that the issue is difficult in Col
orado, where strong interests are back
ing the wets. The principal fight, they
believe, is being waged in Ohio, which
is the largest state in which the fight
for prohibition has yet been waged. If
Ohio should go dry the prohibitionists
would be well on the way to national
victory.
The fight for supremacy in Califor
nia between the wet and dry factions
is still uppermost in political circles.
Edgerton Lakin, '08, well-known city
councilman of Palo Alto, is the pro
gressive candidate representing the
temperance party in the race for rep
resentative to the assembly from this
district. Lakin's opponent is Dan
Hayes, representing the liquor cle
ment. Hayes has already defeated the
dry's own law to give Santa Clara Uni
versity the same dry clause that Stan
ford now enjoys. The outcome of this
local fight is second in interest only
to that being waged by the entire state.
Gubernatorial Race Exciting.
In the gubernatorial contest Gover
nor Hiram W. Johnson is being op
posed by the corporations, the banks,
and other big interests. His opponents
are Captain John Fredericks, of Los
Angeles, who is well-known for the
part he played in the prosecution ot
the McNamara brothers for the Times
building dynamiting, through data fur
nished by William J. Hums. John R
Curtin, the democratic candidate, has
served as state senator for several
years. He is an attorney of Tuolumne
county.
President Wilson favors the election
of James D. Phclan for U. S. Senator
over Francis .T. Heney. Wilson wants
Phelnn's support, in Congress. Phelan
Is a resident of this county, a graduate
of St. Ignatius, and served as mayor
of San Francisco three times. Heney
is a former student of the University
of California.
Congressman E. A. Hayes, of San
; Jose, who is in the race fo.r congress
man from this district, is an uncle of
E. L. Hayes, '16. His opponent is L. 1).
Bolinett, ex-'OG, a former editor of The
Daily Californian, who later transfer
red to Stanford for advance study.
Amendment II Importuit.
A vote for Amendment 11 will insure
additional class rooms to the Universi
ty of California, where the present
buildings are far from adequate to
cope with the ever-increasing student
body. Several Stanford men have in
terested themselves in the legislature
in recent years in an endeavor to se
cure these appropriations for Califor
nia. Among the active have been F.
H. Benson, '95, W. A. Sutherland, '90,
C. P. Cutten, '99, H. C. Jones, *02, L.
| D. Bolinett, ex-'OG, H. C. Nelson, '10,
j and W. E. Simpson, ex-'l3. At the last
j state election two out of five state
senators elected were Stanford men,
j and five out of eighty assemblymen.
If the Royal Arch Amendment 'S
passed it will put a check on all liquor
agitation fo.r eight years to come. The
universal eight-hour law is also an im
portant issue in California, being op
posed by the farmers and fruit grow
ers, who find extreme difficulty in liv
ing up to the requirements of the re
cent eight-hour law in rush seasons.
Palo Alto Situation Unique.
A unique situation in political his
tory is found in Palo Alto at the pres
ent time, where more than 1100 women
are registered, outnumbering the men
voters by over 75. The women thus
hold the balance of power, and if they
turn out Tuesday in proportion to their
registration, results may already be
calculated. The total registration in
California this year is 1,250,000, prob
ably 75% of whom will vote.

dry's own law to give Santa Clara Uni

local fight is second in interest only
to that being waged by the entire state.
Gubernatorial Race Exciting.
In the gubernatorial contest Gover

Amendment II Importuit.
A vote for Amendment 11 will insure
additional class rooms to the Universi

buildings are far from adequate to
cope with the ever-increasing student
body. Several Stanford men have in

in recent years in an endeavor to se

Palo Alto Situation Unique.
A unique situation in political his
tory is found in Palo Alto at the pres
ent time, where more than 1100 women
are registered, outnumbering the men
voters by over 75. The women thus
hold the balance of power, and if they
turn out Tuesday in proportion to their
registration, results may already be
calculated. The total registration in
California this year is 1,250,000, prob
ably 75% of whom will vote.
Not since the first political rally in
1892, when campus politicians stayed
up all night to follow the defeat of
Benjamin Harrison by Grover Cleve
land in the presidential race of that
year, has more interest been manifest

shown in the big rally scheduled for
next Tuesday. The Daily Palo Alto
has leased the United Press Wire for
the convenience of local partisans,
who will be able to follow the progress
of the election in minute detail, by
watching the returns flashed in quick
succession in the Assembly Hall.

According to a telegram received to

Amendment II Importuit.

additional class rooms to the Universi

Palo Alto Situation Unique.
A unique situation in political his
tory is found in Palo Alto at the pres
ent time, where more than 1100 women
are registered, outnumbering the men
voters by over 75. The women thus
hold the balance of power, and if they
turn out Tuesday in proportion to their
registration, results may already be
calculated. The total registration in
California this year is 1,250,000, prob
ably 75% of whom will vote.
Not since the first political rally in
1892, when campus politicians stayed
up all night to follow the defeat of
Benjamin Harrison by Grover Cleve
land in the presidential race of that
year, has more interest been manifest
ed in an election than that already
shown in the big rally scheduled for
next Tuesday. The Daily Palo Alto
has leased the United Press Wire for
the convenience of local partisans,
who will be able to follow the progress
of the election in minute detail, by
watching the returns flashed in quick
succession in the Assembly Hall.
Stunts Enliven Pauses.
Clever specialties will bid for pop
ular favor between bulletins. Campus
talent will appear in a series of artistic
musical offerings and a variety of
comedy "stunts." Light refreshment.,
will be served by the representatives
of the sororities and clubs. An ad
mission fee of fifteen cents will be

According to a telegram received to
day from Washington, D. C., the head
quarters of the Anti-Saloon League of
America, the prohibitionists are con
fident of victory in the states of Wash
ington, Oregon and Orizoua, but doubt
ful of the outcome in California, and
hopeful of the returns in Ohio. They
admit that the issue is difficult in Col
orado, where strong interests are back
ing the wets. The principal fight, they
believe, is being waged in Ohio, which
is the largest state in which the fight
for prohibition has yet been waged. If
Ohio should go dry the prohibitionists
would be well on the way to national
victory.
The fight for supremacy in Califor
nia between the wet and dry factions
is still uppermost in political circles.
Edgerton Lakin, '08, well-known city
councilman of Palo Alto, is the pro
gressive candidate representing the
temperance party in the race for rep
resentative to the assembly from this
district. Lakin's opponent is Dan
Hayes, representing the liquor cle
ment. Hayes has already defeated the
dry's own law to give Santa Clara Uni
versity the same dry clause that Stan
ford now enjoys. The outcome of this
local fight is second in interest only
to that being waged by the entire state.
Gubernatorial Race Exciting.
In the gubernatorial contest Gover
nor Hiram W. Johnson is being op
