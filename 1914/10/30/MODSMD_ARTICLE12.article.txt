Teuton Strength Failing—Paris.
Paris, Oct. 30.—High officials affirm
that the Turkish participation in the
European controversy is a complete
admission on the part of the Ger
mans of their inability to gain success
on either the East or West. The en
trance of seven to nine thousand Otto
mans into the war is expected to force
Ttaly to show her hand. It is reported
that the foreign officers have hastened
to Rome, where a momentous confer
ence is progressing. Fighting on the
Belgo-France frontier has been re
sumed with greater desperation with
the arrival of heavy Teutonic rein
forcements.
Staggering Total of Losses in West.
Pa.ris, Oct. 30. —The losses in the re
newed fighting in the western scene of
the war are staggering. Beyond a
measure of doubt the allied armies'
casualties in dead, wounded, and pris
oners amount, to fifty thousand during
the past fortnight. The German loss
es number three or four times the
same amount.
Allied Forces Make Substantial Gains.
Paris, Oct. 30. —This afternoon's
Communique made sweeping claims of
substantial allied gains in the battle on

Belgians have opened the flumes of
several of their dykes, and thereby
flooded the lower Yser region. A vio
lent cannonading followed from the
French and British entrenchments.
Considerable ground was given way by
the Teuton armies in the north on ac
count of their forced retreat. A gen
eral advance all along the battle line
has been accomplished by the allied
forces.
