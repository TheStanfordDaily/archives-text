Open your eyes, you men of Stanford
who know your college best, and look
about you!
At every turn is a monument that
marks the road of progress—is this a
reality or a dream?
To some of the veterans of the
twenty-year struggle the Stanford of
today must seem a far cry from the
dim beginning of '91. The small group
of buildings round the Inner Quad
are lost in the vast area of red-tiled
roofs; the arcades have stretched and
turned again, until the checkered pave
ment is measured in miles.
Stanford's first decade was not
smooth sailing, yet from this distant
viewpoint the growth of the Univer
sity would seem to be uninterrupted,
wonderfully uniform, until that fateful
April morning eight years ago. It
was almost a deathblow, yet this most
unique of institutions rallied, passed a
crisis a year or two later, and began
again the up-hill climb to the ulti
mate goal—"a University of high de
gree."
The veterans of the last decade
might gauge the progress by countless
wayside stones —the check to all the
University in the days of '06, the
growing pains of '07 and '08, the leth
argy of the years that followed. Then
came the awakening, and the very
ground stirred into life. An alumnus
remembered the days long past and
by indefatigable effort and an open
purse launched the Stanford Union.
The clubhouse soon took its place in
the field and a great step forward had
been taken. Improvement of athletic
fields kept pace with university
growth—their excellence became a by
word.
Following announcement of a new
policy of conservation and specializa
tion, the departments of the engineer
ing corner were given vastly expanded
quarters—the laboratories stretched
in double line from Lasuen to the
western outposts of the Quad.
Open your eyes and look around you!
The Union and Clubhouse glisten
white, practically completed; the
ground is broken for the new gymna
sium; and last but not least, a fine
plunge is to put Stanford on the list
of aquatic sport competitors.
A dream come true—Stanford is
back on the level of 1900—is above it.
We forget excuses in these, the best
days of our short quarter century!
Open your eyes, you men of Stanford
who know your college best, and look
about you!
