Richard Le Gallienne, English poet
and critic, abandoned his business of
fice to turn author. He is best known
for his fantastic prose essays and the
sketches, "Prose Fancies.' He writes
frequently for the Century Magazine.
Before the war he startled America by
announcement of a "back to nature"
tramp on the Continent in "hobo"
guise.
All things that fade and fall
With a strange, haunted sound
Upon the astered ground.
In sad September nights;
Apples and yellow leaves
And the low, ghostlike call
Of summer's lost delights
That grieves and grieves:
Of these be the song made,
Like them to fall and fade.
Of garden corners dank,
With piercing smell of mold.
Of summer's cup of gold,
Wherefrom as deep he drank,
By the dry fountain's edge
Cast down and grown arust;
Dust calling unto dust.
Sedge sighing unto sedge;
Of these let the song tell
That pleaseth Autumn well.
Of woods —a painted scene,
A hollow mimic show,
A mask within whose glow
A grinning death is seen;
Of flowers funeral
That seem not flowers at all,
But little paper shapes,
An art fantastic apes;
In these has Autumn pride
That knows not she hath died.
