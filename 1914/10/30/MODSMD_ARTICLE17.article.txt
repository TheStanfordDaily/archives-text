To the President and Members of the
Faculty of Leland Stanford Junior
University:
At a meeting of the Women's Con
ference on Wednesday, October twen
ty-eight, the question of the Honor
System and its various phases was
brought up for discussion. Owing to
our inability at the present time to of
fer a definite, workable phase of an
honor system for the women of our
University, we respectfully ask the co
operation of the Faculty in creating a
sentiment in all their classes such as
exists in our Law Department. We
believe and trust that this principle of
personal honor will thereby be in
culcated into every Stanford woman,
so that in time a definte Honor Sys
tem will be a permanent outgrowth.
Respectfully submitted,
THE WOMAN'S CONFERENCE.

Mary Gard,
Nan Drury,
Therese Dorroh,
Committee.
