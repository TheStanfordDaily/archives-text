# WILCOX CLOSES DEAL WITH GAIETY THEATER FOR FOOTBALL SHOW
## 
### 
"Let's Get Married" Will Furnish En
tertainment on Evening of Hitr
Game.
Graduate Manager Wilcox has con
cluded negotiations with the Gaiety
Theatre for the evening of November
14, and "Let's Get Married" will be
this year's football show. Twelve
hundred tickets will be put on sale at
the Bookstore Tuesday, November 3,
the drawing beginning at 1:10 p. m.,
as usual. Contrary to previous an
nouncement tickets will be one dollar
all over the house. The student body
will have first choice at the seats, but
any tickets left over will go on sale at
the Gaiety Theatre box office two days
befo.re the Big Game.
"Let's Get Married" is a Los Angeles
product, being the work of no less
than four Angelenans in collaboration.
Quite different from the standard type
of girl and music shows, it has a con
sistent, humorous tale throughout, in
stead of a shadow of a plot bobbing up
now and then between specialties. The
chorus is touted as a world-beater.
The cast contains the names of Fran
ces Cameron, Maude Reatty, Walter
Lawrence, Jess Dandy, Ralph Bell and
other noted stars of the comic opera
world. Ralph Bell, as Byron Long
fellow, a weak-minded poet, spilling
poetry at every possible occasion, will
be loaded with rhymes about Stan
ford's great and near-great.
It was originally planned to have
Kolb and Dill in one of their produc
tions for the football show, but Dill
met with an accident several weeks
ago, and is still unable to appear.
However, Manager Wilcox hopes to
have the popular team of German com
edians give one of thei.r stunts between
the regular acts of "Let's Get Mar
ried."
