# FIELD DAY AND PLUNGE COMMITTEES ARE NAMED
## President Worthy Announces Personnel of Bodies Authorized by Executive Committee. 
### 
Student Body President A. E. Wor
thy, '15, has announced the Football,
Field Day and Out-door Plunge com
mittees, authorized at the last meeting
of the Executive committee.
The Out-door Plunge committee will
consist of L. R. Reineman, '15, chair
man. F. E. Rehm, *15, and T. E. Work
man, '14. This body will have charge
of the campaign for raising the sum
necessary to complete the construction
of the new swimming pool. The Ex
ecutive Committee has already appro
priated fifteen hundred dollars for
this purpose, and the committee is
rapidly outlining plans for augment
ing this amount. Various methods are
being planned to effect this purpose,
among which is the charging of an ad
mission fee of twenty-five cents for the
use of the tank. This seems a most
fair method, inasmuch as those who
benefit by the pool will give something
towards the payment of its cost. The
other plans formulated by the com
mittees will be announced soon.
The Football Field Day committee
will be composed of .T. R. Davis, '15,
F. ,T. Gard, '14, and P. P. Clove.r, '14,
chairman. The committee will confer
with Coach Brown on this matter and
determine upon a date and the order of
events for the celebration. Running,
place-kicking, drop-kicking, punting
for accuracy and punting for distance
will be among the events staged on the
ootball turf.
