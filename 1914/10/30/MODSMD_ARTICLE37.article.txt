# Gymnasium Excavations Nearly Done.
## 
### 
Excavations for the now gymnasium
are practically completed. It has been
necessary to remove one or two of the
eucalyptus trees that formerly graced
the site, hut the majority of the trees
will remain to shade the new build
ing. Work on the new foundation will
probably commence early next week.
