# ALUMNI AND TITANS WEEKEND VISITORS
## Absence of Reeves, Hall and Probably Blase From The Firing Line Causes Several Shifts JUVENILE MATCH FEATURE Twelve Men on Reserve List of the Varsity Team Have a Good Chance to Enter Game 
### 
The Alumni anu Titan club players
will afford opposition to the Varsity
and Blacks tomorrow afternoon in the
next to the last rugby workouts of the
preliminary season. Stubby Stolz's
third division charges will journey to
San Jose fo,r an afternoon match with
the College of Pacific team.
Between halves of the Varsity-Titan
game, the "Peewees" of the Lytton
avenue school will try conclusions with
the eighth grade stars of the Palo
Alto grammar school.
Evidences of the fact that Young
America on the Pacific coast is devel
oping an early liking for rugby may
be seen any afternoon on the turf. Few
people realize that the small boys can
stage a good game. The growth of
youngsters in a rugby atmosphere is
significant to the future of the English
game. The exhibition of the juvenile
fifteen will be more than a comic in
terlude to the main event.
Shifts Made in Varsity.
Coach Brown has made an emergen
cy rearrangement of the Varsity, and
will use a line-up that is patch-worked
in several departments.
Frank Reeves and E. B. Hall will
grace the sidelines for the first time
this season. Reeves' wing has been
assigned to Templeton, subbed by May
berry. The knee injury sustained by
the fast right wing last Saturday con
tinues to keep him under Trainer Ma
loney's care. Hall's front rank berth
will be filled by Clover, who is again
moved up from the middle rank. Pet
tingill will take Clover's usual place
in the middle rank, instead of playing
relief for "Jumbo" Blase at lock.
The coach and trainer have not yet
decided whether Blase's wrenched
shoulder has been nursed near enough
to full strength to justify his appear
ance in the rear division. Halsted has
been put on the call list, and will prob
ably serve as his proxy.
Soper and Wines will be Clover's
running mates in the front rank. Clark
and Single are their substitutes. The
center pair is composed of Braden and
Pettingill, with Jacomini reserved.
Card and Wylie, breakaways, will have
Ogden and Wright to serve as relief
men.
Behind the scrum there will be no
change in the first string personnel,
save that caused by Reeves' absence.
The substitute list reveals several in
teresting names.
Walker, the Freshman half, whose
play with the 1918 team and Black di
vision has been consistently good
enough to place him in the training
house, will be A,rt Erb's relief man.
Austin and Lachmund are seconded by
Templeton and Swigart. Carroll is
subbed by Kirksey at center three, ur
ban and Templeton will occupy the
wings, supported by Burns and May
berry. Helmus Andrews remains the
iron man at fullback.
Subs to lie Plnjed.
Most of the men named in the initial
varsity line-up will be kept on the
field only long enough to get a good
warming up. All of the substitutes are
