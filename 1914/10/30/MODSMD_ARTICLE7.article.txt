# DR. JORDAN LEAVES CAMPUS TODAY ON EXTENDED TRIP EAST
## Departure Is Hastened by Urgent Request of Denver People for Visit. 
### 
Chancellor David Starr Jordan left
San Francisco this afternoon, en route
for Denver, Colo.rado. His formar
plans to leave for the East on Sunday
were changed, owing to the urgent re
quest of the people of Denver that he
stop to speak there.
Doctor Jordan will be gone for at
least two months, during which time
he will speak in many eastern cities.
The general subject of his lectures will
be "Peace," the topic in which he is so
vitally interested. Among the cities to
be visited are New York, Bridgeport,
New Haven, Boston, Providence, Hart
ford, Albany, Trenton, Philadelphia,
Wilmington, Baltimore, Washington,
Pittsburg, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Co
lumbus, Dayton, Indianapolis, and Chi
cago.
At New York City he will attend a
meeting of the Carnegie Peace Insti
tute, of which he is a trustee, and in
Boston The World Peace Foundation
will claim part of his time. It is un
der the auspices of the latter organiza
tion that Dr. Jordan is lecturing
throughout the east.
On November 9 and 10, the Chancel
lor will represent Stanford University
at a meeting of the Associated Univer
sities at Princeton. Early in Decem
ber he will attend a convention of the
Association of State Universities to be
held in Washington, D. C.
Dr. Jordan hopes to complete his lec
ture tour just before Christmas.
This sudden departure will, of
course, do away with the Sunday ev
ening lectures which the Chancellor
has been giving at Encina. under the
auspices of the Young Men's Christian
Association. The Y. M. C. A., however,
hopes to secure some one to take the
place thus vacated, and these meetings
will in all probability be renewed in a
week or two.
