# STANFORD VARSITIES ANNEX RAGGED GAMES
## Alumni and Titans Forced to Lower Colors LOWER GRADE "TADS" STAR Greys, With Seven Regulars Out, Emerge on Long End of 31-3 Score—Blacks Win Contest 
### 
When darkness ended the play on
the Stanfo.rd turf last Saturday, two
more scalps had been added to the Car
dinal belt of victory, and the Alumni
and Titan Clubs bowed in acknowl
edgement of the superiority of the
Stanford ruggers. Despite this fact,
however, the afternoon's exhibition
was of a rather listless and featureless
nature, with only a mediocre brand of
ball being dished before the small band
of rooters that remained on the cam
pus.
Following the pistol shot, marking
the close of the day's festivities, the
sco.re board read a 31 to 3 win for the
Varsity in the contest with the blue
jersied Alumni fifteen, and a 10 to 8
victory—a narrowly-averted defeat —•
for the home team in the Titan-All-
Black game. Rev. Mullineaux held the
whistle throughout the afternoon's
play, and refereed in a most creditable
manner.
Great amusement was afforded the
bleachers between halves of the Var
sity-Alumni game, when the Lytton
Pewees and the Channing Tndomit
ables engaged in a minature struggle
for the juvenile supremacy of Palo
Alto. A surprising knowledge of rugby
was displayed by the grammar school
tads, who varied between the ages of
eight and twelve. After a terrific bat
tle the Indomitables emerged victor
ious by a lone three points.
The Varsity opened play with seven
regulars out of their line-up, Hall,
Clover, Braden, Wylie, Gard, Blase,
and Reeves acting in the capacity of
spectators. Following Momson's kick
off for the Alumni, there were six min
utes of anxiety for the Cardinal sup
porters, with the visitors pressing
hard on the Stanford goal line. Finally
Momson picked up from the loose, af
ter a dribbling rush to our twenty
yard line, and passed to Sample for the
only visiting score. Momson failed to
convert.
Fullback Andrews' clever boots to
touch saved the Varsity from many a
difficulty at this point of the game.
Credit for Stanford's first score is
due to Joe Urban, who scooped up the
pigskin on his own forty-five-vard
line, and then with a beautiful run
went through the opposition for a try.
The play was one of the brightest
spots of an otherwise ragged contest.
Austin converted a hard chance.
A few minutes later Austin received
the ball from Erb on Stanford's forty
yard line, dodged ten yards further and
conveyed to Lachmund who sprinted
half the field for the second try. Aus
tin once more placed the ball directly
between the posts. Urban again came
to the fore, when he registered the last
score of the period. After taking Bloes
er's pass he dodged and wriggled his
way through the entire opposition, and
although tackled several times man
aged to cross the line. Austin's con
version raised the total to 15 to 3 at
the end of the half.
With the opening of the second half,
only four members of the team that
played Santa Clara a week ago, re
mained in the varsity line-up. Burns,
whose playing was a revelation to the
rugby fans, initiated the first score
of the period, when he received the
ball from a line-out at midfield and
made a brilliant and heady run for
thirty-five yards, where he transfered
to Ogden, who in turn passed to Tem
pleton for a try. Templeton failed at
conversion.
Swigart registered the fifth Stan
ford try by covering after a dribbling
rush over the Alumni line. Temple
ton added two more points to the total
with a clever conversion. A passing
rush, Walker to Swigart to Carroll
over fifteen yards of distance was re
sponsible for the next score. Tem
pleton again converted.
The last tally of the contest was
hung up when Burns picked up from
the loose on the Alumni ten-yard line,
and dodged his way across the line.
Templeton missed a difficult chance.
The Titan-All-Black game looked
like a sure victory for the visitors un
til the latter part of the second half,
when the second string men began to
make things hum. Play in the first
period was close, Eazar. Titan wing,
registering the only try. Skinner
failed in his attempt at goal.
C. Slater tried to make victory cer
tain in the beginning of the half by
picking up the ball on Stanford's five
yard line, following a long dribbling
rush and scoring. Skinner converted.
A passing rush executed between Hen
ry, Rehm. and Single, resulted in the
latter's try after a quarter distance of
the field had been covered. West's
accurate boot added two more points.
West came to the front with the tyinc
score, when, after .recovery of a kick
at full, he ran in thirty-five yards for
the second All-Black try. A conver
sion of his own try from a most diffi
cult. angle gave the laurels of victory
to the Second Varsity.
