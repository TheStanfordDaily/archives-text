# We're For You, California
## 
### 
If the people of the Bay counties
were us unanimous in support of the
Blue and Gold Varsity as they are in
regard to Number Eleven on tomor
row's ballot, Stanford would stand a
so.rry chance on November fourteenth.
But, fortunately, there is a difference
of opinion in the first case.
California's fight of months for
an appropriation of funds for univer
sity buildings ends tonight—the deci
sion of the voting population is given
tomorrow. Stanford has expressed be
fore this her willingness to help, and
has lent her cordial support to the
campaign of our friendly rival.
No one who has ever trod the sliv
ered floor of shaky North Hall, or
crowded into the ill-lighted and poor
ly-ventilated class rooms of other rel
ics of the early sixties, will grudge a
dollar of the two millions, or hesitate
to give material aid at the polls.
We're pulling fo.r you, California—
tomorrow.
