Walt Whitman stands foremost
among America's verse writers as a
master of forceful expression. These
lines are peculiarly his own in their
directness and irregularity:
Whoever you are! you are he or she
for whom the earth is solid and
liquid;
You are lie or she for whom the sun
and the moon hang in the sky;
For none more than you are tlie pres
ent and the past;
For none more than you is immortal
ity!
Each man to himself, and each woman
to herself, is the word of the
past and present, and the word
of immortality;
No one can acquire for another—not
one!
No one can grow for another—not
one!
