# Rout of Missions Destroys Overconfidence in Cardinals
## California Varsity Rushes Santa Clara Ruggers Off Their Feet by Scoring Seven Trys and Two Goals. 
### 
California blanked the Santa Clara
ruggers Saturday by twenty-five
points, coming within a single tally of
doubling the punishment which Stan
ford gave the same team one week be
fore. Up to 2:30 Saturday, some thou
sands of Berkeley students were re
signed to the purpose of backing a
forlorn hope in the intercollegiate
match on November 14.
Schaeffer's men came through to a
man, and chalked seven tries, while
the Mission forwards were torn piece
meal, and their backs were smothered
in a hopeless series of fumbles, slow
starts, and intercepted passes. Most
surprised of all the spectator were the
California rooters.
The only moral which Stanford men
can draw from the exhibition of their
turf rivals is that once more Califor
nia has done the impossible, and whip
ped a squad of discouraging rookies
into a slashing machine.
The score tells an accurate story of
the day's events. The Blue and Gold
team had the whip hand in every de
partment. As a spectacle, the match
was a disappointment. The victors
covered the field with apparent clum
siness, which was most marked in the
backfield play. The game was won by
the wonderful ability of every man be
hind the scrum to kick himself out of
danger. Remarkable passing runs were
nil as a scoring device, save in the
fifth try. Late in the second half,
when Montgomery relieved the Fresh
man prodigy. Harper, at half, started
the ball out from a twenty-yard scrum,
Sharpe, Canfield, and Brooks all had
hands on the ball before Hayes took *t
across.
An assumption that the Berkeley
team is guilty of real unwieldliness is
belied by the fact that its parts are al
ways in the neighborhood of the man
with the ball. The ability of the play
ers to keep eyes on the ball made it
possible for the backs to get away with
their innumerable cross-kicks when
stopped up by the defence.
Canfield and Gianelli, the five
eighths, who will control the Blue and
Gold backfield in in the intercollegiate
match, displayed a dash and accuracy
in handling the'.r plays, which stamps
them as stars of the first order. At
half. Harper, who had difficulty in a
sub's berth with the Manual Arts high
team in 1912, handled the scrum with
the touch of a master, shared with his
team mates in kicking proclivities, and
tackled unfailingly.
Brooks, another of the Freshmen
'"finds," who played the left wing, of
fered beautiful speed, and figured di
rectly in three of the tries.
The Bear has a pack that can claim
equality with that of Stanford, without
need of great imagination, and a lot
of backs that seem to have unlimited
resource. Those who saw the game
Saturday are convinced that the inter
collegiate match is not yet won.

The only moral which Stanford men
can draw from the exhibition of their
turf rivals is that once more Califor
nia has done the impossible, and whip
ped a squad of discouraging rookies
into a slashing machine.
The score tells an accurate story of
the day's events. The Blue and Gold
team had the whip hand in every de
partment. As a spectacle, the match
was a disappointment. The victors
covered the field with apparent clum
siness, which was most marked in the
backfield play. The game was won by
the wonderful ability of every man be
hind the scrum to kick himself out of
danger. Remarkable passing runs were
nil as a scoring device, save in the
fifth try. Late in the second half,
when Montgomery relieved the Fresh
man prodigy. Harper, at half, started
the ball out from a twenty-yard scrum,
Sharpe, Canfield, and Brooks all had
hands on the ball before Hayes took *t
across.
An assumption that the Berkeley
team is guilty of real unwieldliness is
belied by the fact that its parts are al
ways in the neighborhood of the man
with the ball. The ability of the play
ers to keep eyes on the ball made it
possible for the backs to get away with
their innumerable cross-kicks when
stopped up by the defence.
Canfield and Gianelli, the five
eighths, who will control the Blue and
Gold backfield in in the intercollegiate
match, displayed a dash and accuracy
in handling the'.r plays, which stamps
them as stars of the first order. At
half. Harper, who had difficulty in a
sub's berth with the Manual Arts high
team in 1912, handled the scrum with
the touch of a master, shared with his
team mates in kicking proclivities, and
tackled unfailingly.
Brooks, another of the Freshmen
'"finds," who played the left wing, of
fered beautiful speed, and figured di
rectly in three of the tries.
The Bear has a pack that can claim
equality with that of Stanford, without
need of great imagination, and a lot
of backs that seem to have unlimited
resource. Those who saw the game
Saturday are convinced that the inter
collegiate match is not yet won.
California blanked the Santa Clara
ruggers Saturday by twenty-five
points, coming within a single tally of
doubling the punishment which Stan
ford gave the same team one week be
fore. Up to 2:30 Saturday, some thou
sands of Berkeley students were re
signed to the purpose of backing a
forlorn hope in the intercollegiate
match on November 14.
Schaeffer's men came through to a
man, and chalked seven tries, while
the Mission forwards were torn piece
meal, and their backs were smothered
in a hopeless series of fumbles, slow
starts, and intercepted passes. Most
surprised of all the spectator were the
California rooters.
