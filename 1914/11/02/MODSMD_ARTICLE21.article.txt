### 
Petrograd, Nov. 2. â€”Russia as yet
has assumed no aggressive action
against her latest enemy, Turkey. The
Czar is planning to force the Sultan
to take the initiative, and then to out
line his campaign accordingly. It is
expected that the Ottoman troops will
concentrate in Egypt, where a Holy
War will be proclaimed. Bulgaria has
given definite assurances of her neu
trality, bankruptcy making a peace
policy imperative.
