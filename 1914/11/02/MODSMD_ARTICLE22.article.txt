# Prohibitionists Doubtful of California.
## 
### 
Washington, Nov. 2. â€”Headquarters
of the Anti-Saloon League of America
claim certain victories in Arizona, Ore
son, and Washington, while they are
hopeful of victory in Ohio. As to
whether California will go wet or dry
still hangs fire, but all indications
point to a victory for the liquor inter
ests. Colorado is almost sure to re
main wet. The principal fight of the
prohibitionists is centering in Ohio,
which is the largest state yet to be
tackled. Jn case the Buckeye state
should vote dry, the supporters of na
tional prohibition will be given strong
aid.
