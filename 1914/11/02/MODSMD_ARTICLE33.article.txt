# WINES ELIGIBLE FOR BIG GAME.
## 
### 
That Tiny Wines, veteran front rank
er, will be eligible to play in the com
ing intercollegiate game with Califor
nia, was definitely decided at the
meeting of the Faculty Scholarship
Committee last Friday evening. Up to
this there was some question as to
whether the sturdy scrum man would
be allowed to don a. suit in the big
game, on account of the enforced leave
of absence from college last semester,
when he was taken sick with typhoid
fever. The announcement has been re
ceived with acclaim by the Cardinal
rugby fans.
