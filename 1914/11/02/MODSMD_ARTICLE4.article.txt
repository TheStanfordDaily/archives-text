November 2, 1014.
1 ask attention of the students and
faculty of Stanford University to the
urgent appeal made to the state and
nation oil behalf of the people of Rcl
giuiii made destitute by the war. Many
of them must soon face starvation un
less outside relief is promptly sent.
The appeal to California comes
til rough Herbert C. Hoover, trustee
and graduate of Stanford University,
who is chairman of the relief commis
sion in London.
The plan is to buy food here in Cal
ifornia and to ship it direct from San
Francisco to tlie relief commission at
Rotterdam, from which point it will be
distributed.
Every student and member of the
faculty is asked to give as he can af
ford. Any amount, however small,
will be gladly received.
It is necessary that we act promptly.
The contributions should ail be in baud
not later than noon Thursday, Novem
ber sth.
Committees have been asked to re
ceive contributions in the dormitory
and fraternity houses.
Persons who may lie overlooked can
hand their subscriptions to Mr. Mc-
Dowell, at the office of the Registrar,
or to Mr. Clark, at the President's of
fice.
Checks should be made payable to
Assistant Registrar J. E. McDowell or
to 0. A. Clark, Academic Secretary.
JOHN CASPER RR.INNER,
President.

California will load a ship of boun
ty to carry relief to the millions of
starving men, women, and children of
Belgium who have been thrown in the
path of European warfare. Stanford
University will be the first community
of California to deposit food in the
hold of the relief ship.
One thousand dollars will be sub
scribed and paid in by students and
faculty members of Stanford before
noon of Thursday. The amount will
be submitted at the meeting of the
California Relief Committee of the San
F.rancisco Chamber of Commerce,
which will meet Friday noon at the
Merchant's Exchange building.
The response to tne prayer of a he
roic people in the throes of famine will
be spontaneous in fulfillment as it
was in conception by President John
Casper Branner, who in this column
voices an appeal for each one to lend
his mite.
When the people of this state, were
dazed by the earthquake and fire of
190fi, Belgium was among the first of
the nations to send regrets in the form
of substantial aid for the .refugees of
San Francisco. The tables are turned,
and the people who received eight
years ago are asked to return proof
of human kinship.

H. C. Hoover, '95, who is in charge of
relief work for the Belgians in Lon
don, has cabled the Chamber of Com
merce of San Francisco that immedi
ate food supplies are needed to cope
with horrible death from starvation
and pestilence. He declares that he
knows California will help.
Writing in the trenches at the siege
of Dunkirk, King Albert, of Belgium,
sent a prayer to the people of the
United States that they respond gener
ously to the efforts of the American
Relief Commission. California is most
intimately grateful to Pelsium for a
past office of friendship. The co-op
eration of San Francisco will be
pledged at a mass meeting called for
tomorrow afternoon in the Merchants'
Exchange building.
Method of liaising Funds.
There will be three means of swell
ing the contribution which Stanford
can make for the welfare of the out
cast people of Belgium. First of these
is the collection of a cash fund by the
representative committee appointed by
Dr. Branner. The second is the pro
ceeds of the election rally in the As
sembly Hall tomorrow evening. The
proceeds from admission fees of fif
teen cents each and profits from the
sale of "hot dogs," sandwiches, and
candy by the Women's Press Club will
all be swerved into the relief benefit.
The original purpose of using the re
ceipts to equip reading rooms for the
Stanford Union and the Women's Club
house has been discarded to meet the
greater need.
The third means of subscription is
Football Field Day, to which an ad
mission of twenty-five cents will be
charged.
W. Mayo Newhall, president, of the
Board of Trustees of the University,
and Frank Anderson, another of the
trustees, are both members of the com
mittee of thirty-four business men
which has been named to prosecute the
loading of the California food ship. All
funds received by them will be used
to purchase staple foods.
Below are printed the names of stu
dents who will conduct the subscrip
tion campaign on the campus. Each
man will have a typewritten list on
which a record will be kept of the con
tribution made by each student or
member of the faculty in his jurisdic
tion. All moneys received must be
given to A. W. Ambrose, '13, student
adviser, at. the Registrar's office
Thursday at 1 o'clock. Palo Alto res
idents, members of the faculty, and
others may leave their contributions
at the Registrar's or President's of
fice.

The values which will be offered at
the election returns rally, and the rug
by field day are considered below:
Rally Benefits Diverted for Relief.
With quick appreciation of the op
portunity offered in the presentation
of the election returns Tuesday even
ing for contributing substantially to
the Belgian relief fund, it has been
definitely decided to turn over the re
ceipts of the political rally to this
worthy cause. The Stanford Union will
not benefit by the proceeds of the ev
ening as was previously announced.
The destitute Belgians will be the sole
beneficiaries. This change in plans
has been made through the sugges
tion and co-operation of President
Branner. Vanderlynn Stow has as
sured the support of the Board of
Trustees in the undertaking, and has
offered the use of Assembly Hall for
the evening.
Beginning promptly at eight o'clock,
election .reports will be bulletined by
