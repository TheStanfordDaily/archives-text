Teuton Offensive Movement Fails.
Paris. Nov. 2.—After a desperate at
tempt. on the part of the Germans to
dislodge the allied forces on the south
banks of the river Ypres, the Teutons
were .repulsed with heavy losses. The
offensive movement all along the line
by the enemy during the past two days
of fighting has failed, so far as the
capture of any important strategic po
sitions is concerned. The French lines
now extend through Nieuport, only a
few miles from Ostend. The battle is
most severe in the region of Lisle and
Labassee-Arras, the Franco-Belgian
frontier. The cutting of the dykes by
the Belgians has hindered the Teuton
advance materially.
