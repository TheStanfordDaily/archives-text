The bond of human sympathy is
too strong to be broken even in world
war—from a famine-stricken and de
vastated country, six thousand miles
away, conies the call for food and life
giving supplies, and Stanford is quick
to answer.
A Stanford man, H. C. Hoover, is di
recting the work of a nation's relief,
and to him goes the credit for pres
ent organization. His plea for help
in the great work has reached his
Alma Mater, and the President of the
University heads a committee for the
collection of much-needed funds.
The giving should be spontaneous,
each contributing as is in his power.
The need of food is so pressing that
the subscriptions will be turned imme
diately into supplies, and the Califor
nia-grown stuffs will shortly be bound
eastward. To swell the total, the pro
ceeds of the election returns rally in
the Assembly Hall tomorrow night and
of the Football Field Day on Wednes
day, will be turned into the common
treasury and by Thursday will be add
ed to the San Francisco store —mute
evidence of the generosity and of the
whole-hearted sympathy of Stanford
men and women.
