# The
						Soccer Eleven
## 
### 
Eleven men played in the good old
Stanford way on Saturday last, and, in
the face of seemingly overwhelming
odds, won their game—their play was
hard, fast, and clean. There were
no crowded bleachers to cheer them,
no rooting section to stiffen their
backs when the opponents gained, yet
the last whistle found them fighting
into victory.
Soccer is a game overshadowed by
by the greater bulk of rugby, yet it is
competition essentially wo.rth while.
A sport developed through centuries,
soccer claims its share of enthusiasts
who conscientiously train during a
long season for the three-game series
with California.
The first game with the Blue and
Gold is scheduled for the morning o£
November fourteenth —the Stanford
eleven are up against a hard fight.
Whether they win or lose, to them goes
the credit due good sportsmen—the
uphill tussle with the Celts was proof
positive of their quality.
