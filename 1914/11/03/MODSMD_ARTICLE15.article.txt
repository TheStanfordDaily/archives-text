# The 						Lone Trail
## 
### Robert W. Service 
This poem was included in Robert
W. Service's first book, "The Spell of
the Yukon." It is a type of his lighter
verse, indicating the call of the wild to
the "rolling stone:"
Ye who know the Lone Trail fain
would follow it,
Though it lead to glory or darkness
of the pit.
Ye who take the Lone Trail, bid your
love good-bye;
The Lone Trail, the Lone Trail follow
till you die.
The trails of the world be countless,
and most of the trails be tried;
Y'ou tread on the heels of the many,
till you come where the ways
divide;
And one lies safe in the sunlight, and
the other is dreary and wan.
Yet you look aslant at the Lone Trail,
and the Lone Trail lures you on.
And somehow you're sick of the high
ways, with its noise and its easy
needs,
And you seek the risk of the by-way,
and you reck not where it leads.
And sometimes it leads to the desert,
and the tongue swells out of the
mouth,
And you stagger blind to the mirage,
to die in the mocking drouth.
And sometimes it leads to the moun
tains, to the light of the lone
camp-fire!
And you gnaw your belt in the anguish
of hunger-goaded desire.
And sometimes it leads to the Arctic
trail, and the snows where your
torn feet freeze.
And you whittle away the useless clay,
and crawl on your hands and
knees.
Often it leads to the dead-pit; always
it leads to pain;
By the bones of your brothers ye know
it, but oh. to follow you're fain.
By your bones they will follow behind
you, till the ways of the world
are made plain.
Bid good-by to sweetheart, bid good
by to friend;
The Lone Trail, the Lone Trail follow
to the end.
Tarry not, fear not. chosen of the true:
Lover of the Lone Trail, the Lone
Trail waits for you.
