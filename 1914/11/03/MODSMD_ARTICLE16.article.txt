# Tribute to Chancellor Printed in World's Work
## 
### 
Isaac Russell has published in the
World's Work for April, 1914, an ap
preciation of Chancellor Jordan, who,
he says, made the "Red Tiled Princi
pality of Stanford University" into a
world-famous democracy of education.
The following is a part of Mr. Rus
sell's article:
"Under D.t*. Jordan's hand, Stanford
University has come to rank as one of
the great institutions of learning of
the world. Senator Stanford's mon
ey made these things possible, but
Stanford University as a distinctive
educational force, as an object of
world-wide admiration, is the achieve
ment of Dr. Jordan. The University
is Dr. Jordan himself, interpreted in
terms of an ideal of education in the
lives of thousands of graduates the
world over. In the 'red-tiled princi
pality that he shaped for twenty-one
years, hereafter may be quoted with
singular aptness the lines that Kip
ling wrote of Cecil Rhodes:
" 'Living, he was the land, and dead.
His soul shall be her soul.'
"But college administration en
grossed only a part of Dr. Jordan's
time. He refused to do any routine
work that he could hire done as well,
so that he had strength left for other
things. Thus he joined from time
to time with one professor or anoth
er to make researches in biology, the
results usually appearing in a book
written in his graphic manner and
highly distinctive style.
"Writing, indeed, is one of his pe
culiar gifts. Tn prose that is now deli
cate and subtle, now direct, and ener
getic, and in verse that is sometimes
humorous and again in a high mood
[ of fancy, he has ranged on the printed

page from the allegory of the spiritual
life, in 'The Wandering Host,' to a
bold denunciation of militarism, in
'War and Waste,' and from a jingle
011 'Reciprocity' to such a sonnet as
'A Castle in Spain.'
"Felicity of phrase, joined with
vigor of character and with sound,
common sense, cause his writings to
abound in aphoristic 'good things.'
Perhaps his most famous phrase is
that 'the world turns aside to let any
man pass who knows whither he is go
ing.' "
