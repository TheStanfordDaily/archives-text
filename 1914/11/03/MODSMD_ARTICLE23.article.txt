# NO CHANGE MADE IN DATE OF JUNIOR-SENIOR RUSH
## Struggle Scheduled for Early Evening and Will Not Interfere With Later Engagements. 
### 
Contrary to many campus rumors,
there has been no change in the date of
the Plug Ugly rush, and it will be held
next Saturday evening on schedule.
The Juniors will make the attempt to
lay their posters on Friday night.
It is announced, however, that the
upperclass fight will be scheduled ear
ly in the evening, so that, on account
of it, no participants will be compelled
to break social engagements for the
later evening. Since there is no show
this year it will be possible to have the
rush over at an early hour.
Junior plugs have been placed on
sale, and may be obtained on applica
tion at the Beta Tlieta Pi house, or at
Wideman's.
