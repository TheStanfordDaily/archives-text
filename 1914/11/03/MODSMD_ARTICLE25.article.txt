The gift of $10,000,000 offered Har
vard University by Major Clarence
Wiener, of London, with the provision
that the institution dispense with the
services of Professor Hugo Munster
berg, has evidently not tempted the
college authorities, for they recently
refused the resignation of the noted
psychologist. Miinsterberg has been
quite prominent for his strong pro-
German attitude.
