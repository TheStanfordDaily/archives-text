# Roundabout Route Brings German Books to Stanford in Spite of War Blockade
## 
### 
In spite of the fact that every port
in Germany is blockaded by British
ships, and no shipments can be made
from the Fatherland, the Stanford li
brary is now receiving books and peri
odicals from the Teutonic countries,
though they are delayed about two or
three weeks in their delivery.
The neutrality of Italy and Switzer
land is the secret of the affair, in so
far as the arrival of German books and
periodicals at Stanford is concerned.
The company acting as the agent for
Stanford in getting these publications
to the University has made arrange
ments to bring them across the line
from Austria to Italy, where they can
be shipped from Genoa direct to the
United States.
Before this route of travel was de
vised, an attempt was made to send
the Stanford mail from Germany here
via Holland. Ships from Holland were
held up by the British, and the sys
tem was found impractical. Librarian
G. T. Clark thinks now that there will
be little trouble, with the exception
of the two weeks' delay caused by the
longer route of travel.
A letter from the publication agents
to Librarian Clark states that prac
tically every industry in Germany is
being carried on. A number of books
ordered by the library are now en
route fo.r Stanford. The order was
filled perfectly, with the exception of
the binding, in which a substitute
leather was used for morocco, which
could not be imported into Germany.
Belgian and a large number of
French periodicals have been discon
tinued, and will be missing at the li
brary. Correspondence with German
book concerns is carried on by cable
by way of Genoa, through Italy, Aus
tria, sometimes"Switzerland, and final
ly to Berlin, and other cities of the be
sieged country.
