# OLDER BLEACHERS MUST BE REPLACED IN TWO TEARS
## Board of Control Considers Mattersâ€” New Training House Conveniences Provided For. 
### 
Discussion of the proper methods of
replacing the present football bleach
ers occupied most of the attention of
the Hoard of Control of Athletic
Fields at its meeting last night at Dr.
Frank Angell's residence.
A .resolution was passed stating that
it is the opinion of the Board that the
older portions of the present bleachers
should be replaced with new wooden
bleachers before 1917. An inspection
of the bleachers was made recently.
Dr. Angell was instructed to confer
with the Board of Trustees of the Uni
versity concerning the form of bleach
ers which will meet their approval in
.replacing those now standing.
It was hoped that the present wood
en structure might be replaced with a
concrete stadium through co-operation
between the Board of Control and the
trustees. Safety demands that the old
er part of the bleachers be replaced in
the near future, and unless funds for
the concrete work can be raised new
wooden bleachers must be erected.
Further discussion was held with
reference to beautifying the athletic
fields, and improving accommodations
in the training house. A motion was
passed to place two new drinking foun
tains just outside of the track house
and one- at each end of the players'
benches on the baseball field.
A committee composed of P. N. Mc-
Closkey, 'ir>, W. P. Wing. '16, and O. W.
Bedeau, '1. r >, was appointed to investi
gate the proposed increase in the hot
water supply in the football training
house.
