unteered his services for the evening in operating the huge spectro
scope, which, in addition to showing the reports in full, will also be
used to picture photographs and scenes of political interest.
Between bulletins a brisk and entertaining series of original "stunts"
will hold the interest of the audience. Many of the cleverest campus
musicians and comedians have offered their assistance in staging the
vaudeville. The following program will be presented:
1. Musical comedy sketch
Miss Dorothy Albrecht, Miss Dorothea Browning, '15, Miss Helen
Batchelle.r, '15, H. C. Batcheller, '18, R. R. Speers, '18, and J. H.

peanuts, popcorn, and other eatables will be sold at a nominal sum to

will be raffled during the evening.
Fifteen cents w;il l>p the admission fee. The proceeds will swell the
relief fund, which must be raised before Thursday noon for the aid of
the destitute Belgians. This means of contribution to the welfare of
Belgium is the second method decided upon by the committee in charge,

list of members of the subscription committee in the various fraterni
ties and clubs, appointed by Dr. Branner, was published in The Daily
Palo Alto last evening.

Faculty Will Double Sum.
"The faculty hope to duplicate what
ever sum the students are able to raise,
and for that purpose plans have been
made to get subscriptions from pro
fessors.
"The Belgian situation is unique in
the history of the world," continued
the President. "The country was one
of the most beautiful and fertile areas
on earth, and the most thickly popu
lated part of Europe. Now it is de
vastated. its young people killed and
the others driven homeless out of the
country. There are at least a million
people to be fed. Money is of no use.
What they need is food, and that is
what we have to give here in Cali
fornia.
Hoover Deserves Co-operation.
"Mr. Hoover has done much for
Stanford. He is one of the best trus
tees this University has ever had, and
has worked hard for us. Tt is now no
more than right that we should re

work which he has undertaken."
Tonight is the occasion of the big election rally in the Assembly
Hall. Beginning promptly at 7:30 the .returns of the hotly-contested
campaign will come in over the United Press leased wire, and the
bulletins will be posted on the auditorium stage. Detailed and accu
rate returns will be flashed at short intervals and will be produced
continually as long as reports justify them. W. T. White, '15, has vol
unteered his services for the evening in operating the huge spectro
scope, which, in addition to showing the reports in full, will also be
used to picture photographs and scenes of political interest.
Between bulletins a brisk and entertaining series of original "stunts"
will hold the interest of the audience. Many of the cleverest campus
musicians and comedians have offered their assistance in staging the
vaudeville. The following program will be presented:
1. Musical comedy sketch
Miss Dorothy Albrecht, Miss Dorothea Browning, '15, Miss Helen
Batchelle.r, '15, H. C. Batcheller, '18, R. R. Speers, '18, and J. H.
Stearn, '18.
2. Selection Men's Quartette
3. Illuminated Indian Club Exhibition H. B. Wolcott, '14
4. Specialty B. M. Melvin, '17, and M. J. Streeter, '18

Light refreshments will be served during the evening by represen
tatives of the various sororities and clubs of the campus. The Wo
men's Press Club has charge of this feature, the committee being
headed by Miss Lois McCoy, '15, and Miss Anita Allen, '17. Hot dogs
peanuts, popcorn, and other eatables will be sold at a nominal sum to
relieve the hunger of the crowd. A ten-pound box of Wilson's candy
will be raffled during the evening.
Fifteen cents w;il l>p the admission fee. The proceeds will swell the
relief fund, which must be raised before Thursday noon for the aid of
the destitute Belgians. This means of contribution to the welfare of
Belgium is the second method decided upon by the committee in charge,
the first being the collection of funds by personal solicitation. The
list of members of the subscription committee in the various fraterni
ties and clubs, appointed by Dr. Branner, was published in The Daily
Palo Alto last evening.
The committee in charge of the election rally is composed of C. W.

his active assistance.
