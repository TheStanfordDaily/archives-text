United Press Telegraphic Report
New York, Nov. 4.—The latest re
turns from the entire country indicate
that the Democrats will retain their
control in Congress. They have gained
at least one senator. The House ma
jority has probably dwindled to about
twenty, although the Republicans will
not concede this. The count, in the
west is probably the slowest, and it is
unlikely that an accurate result will
be obtained before tonight. The So
cialists claim the election of Berger
and Gaylord from Wisconsin, and Mey
er from the twelfth district in New
York. The Republicans gained one
seat in Rhode Island, three in Massa
chusetts and five in Connecticut. This
is probably the general percentage of
Republican gains throughout the coun
try. New Jersey has returned to the
Republican column. Cannon and Mc-
Kinley were elected from Illinois and
Longworth from Ohio. The best esti
mates place the number in the House
at 227 Democrats. 198 Republicans,
seven Progressives and three Social
ists.
