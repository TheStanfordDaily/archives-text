# Eighteen Hours Left
## 
### 
Time is now the factor in the Bel
gian fund campaign, for with only
eighteen hours remaining before the
final balance is drawn the solicitors
appointed by President Branner are in
the last lap of the race for the thou
sand dollar goal. And the opportuni
ty for collection is practically limited
to this evening, as tomorrow morn
ing's classes will not be opportune
to collect individual subscriptions.
The response to the appeal for food
has been generous and most heartily
given, if an unofficial caucus is an
index, and but one essential is to be
urged—promptness. If Stanford is to
head the list the fund must be in the
San F.rancisco treasury tomorrow af
ternoon.
The case is one of immediate, des
perate necessity and tonight should
find the fund's barometer touching the
thousand-dollar mark.
