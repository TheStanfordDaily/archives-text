The following poem appeared in the
Independent for September 21, 1914:
It is portentous and a thing of State
That here at midnight, in our little
town
A mourning figure walks, and will not
rest
Near the old courthouse pacing up
and down.
A bronzed, lank man! His suit of an
cient black,
A famous top-worn hat and plain worn
shawl,
Make him the quaint great figure that
men love,
The prairie-lawyer, master of us all.
He cannot sleep upon his hillside now,
He is among us, as in times before,
And we who toss and lie awake for
love,
Breathe deep, and start, to see him
pass the door.
His head is bowed, he thinks on men
and kings.
Yea when the sick trorld cries, how
can he sleep?
Too many peasants fight, they know
not why,
Too many homes in black terror weep.
The sins of all the war lords burn his
heart,
He sees the dreadnaughts scouring ev
ery man,
He carries on his shawl-wrapped
shoulders now,
The bitterness, the folly and the pain.
He cannot .rest until a spirit-dawn
Shall come:—the shining hope of Eu
rope free:
The league of sober folks, the Work
ers' Earth
Bringing long peace to Cornland, Alp
and Sea.
It breaks his heart that kings must
murder still.
That all his hours of travail here for
men
Seem yet in vain. And who will bring
white peace
That he may sleep upon his hill again?
