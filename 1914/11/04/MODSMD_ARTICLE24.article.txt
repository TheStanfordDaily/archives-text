Writing in the Sierra Educational
News, Arthur Henry Chamberlain has
contributed the following apostrophe
to peace by picturing the horrors of
the universal war:
Today a world is at war. Across the
fields of France is heard the march of
men. They come from peasant homes
on the steppes of far-off Russia; from
the unhappy Danube where children
play and women weep; from a million
(German firesides; from proud Belgium,
brave and bleeding; from England
with laws and language parent to our
own; from France where still is seen
the blot left by an earlier war. The
Rhine sweeps on past campus and
forts; there rises upward through the
smoke of battle the cries and groans of
men; the sun shines down upon un
marked graves of thousands whose
lives have gone out in a quarrel not of
their making and a cause they do not
understand.
Through the centuries, on the way
from savagery to civilization, men
have warred for conquest, for religion,
for glory. But today an unjust war
has smitten a happy, contented, pros
perous people. The weak are made to
suffer for the strong and future gener
ations shall bear the heavy burdens
imposed by the arrogant, the powerful
and the perverse.
This war shall cease. Europe will
emerge broken and bruised. Monarchs
shall be brought low and there shall
be proclaimed the brotherhood of man.
But today a world's at war.
