# TELEPHONE SERVICE ON CAMPUS GREATLY IMPROVED
## Obsolete Trunk Line System Eliminatedâ€”Direct Connection With Palo Alto Exchange Installed. 
### 
Campus telephone service has been
greatly improved by the elimination
of the obsolete trunk line system, and
the installation of direct connection
with the Palo Alto exchange. The Pa
cific Telephone Company has expend
ed $12,000 in making the change, and
in installing a new cable, paralleling
the old from the main office. Ten
months were required to complete the
alteration, which was, of necessity, a
gradual one.
Seven trunk lines heretofore carried
all Stanford-Palo Alto conversations.
It is the belief of the telephone com
pany that at least twenty lines are
necessary for the volume of business.
The local exchange has been dis
continued for the offices of the Univer
sity between 8 a. m.and 5 p. m. Palo
Alto night numbers are provided for
other houses.
One marked result of the change will
lie the necessity of asking for the num
ber wanted. Central will no longer
comply with a curt request for this,
that or the other house.
