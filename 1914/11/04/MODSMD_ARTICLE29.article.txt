# Economics to Be Taught in French.
## 
### 
A two-hour course in Economics to
be conducted in the French language
will be provided next semester by the
Department of Romanic Languages, if
enough students desire it. Those who
are in their second year of French
should be able to do the work. Stu
dents wishing to negotiate for the
course are asked to do so in room 223.
