# UPPER CLASSES DON WAR PAINT FOR ANNUAL FRAY
## Plug Ugly Will Be Held Saturday Eveningâ€”Posters to Be Laid Friday Night. 
### 
The sixteenth annual Plug Ugly, with
its characteristic spirit and fight, is
nearly here, Saturday evening, Novem
ber 7, being the official date chosen
for the rush. The upper classes will
each attempt to lay their posters Fri
day night, sometime between sunset
and sunrise.
Junior plugs are at a premium this
year, as a new shipment could not be
received from New York in time for
the fray. A few hats are left over
from last year, and may be obtained
in order of application at the Beta
Theta Pi house. Plugs are also on
sale at Wideman's.
The Senior class met today in secret
session to formulate plans of cam
paign. Another meeting will be held
Friday, at which final arrangements
be drawn up.
The Plug Ugly was originated by
the class of 1900 in its Junior year,
189cS, as a means of getting the t?'rd
year men to wear their plugs. The
first posters were laid in 1903, and has
since been a regular feature. The usu
al Plug Ugly show has been abolished
