United Press Telegraphic Report
Trenton, Nov. 4. â€”New Jersey's pris
on nicjht school for convicts has again
opened at the penitentiary here, and
the popularity of this feature of the
prison's life is attested by the fact that
over forty per cent of its population
has enrolled for the fall and winter
courses of study, according to figures
given out today.
The principal aim of the night school
is to fit the convict for better things
when be is released from the institu
tion. It is interesting to note the "life
termers," who are lacking in educa
tional attainments, are as eager to
study as the man with the sentence of
one year.
