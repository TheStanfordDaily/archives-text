# RUGBY SQUAD DOCTORED FOR WINGED "0" GAME
## Choice of a Referee Still Hangs Fire POST-SEASON VARSITY GAME Grays Trounce Black Jersies. Ticket Sale Briskâ€”High School Grads Are Matched 
### 
None of tlie first string varsity men
will be held from the firing line Satur
day on account of injuries, when the
Winged Olympics furnish the last
work-out of the preliminary season.
The best of the Grays will he used.
Seven of the popular week-end stars
who trod the sidelines last Saturday
will be set in action against the club
men. They are Blase, Reeves, Hall,
Gard, Wylie, Braden, and Clover.
The first three men named were pro
scribed by Trainer Maloney last week
on account of injuries. Blase, the big
lock, will have a shoulder brace to re
lieve the jolts of play in the line-outs.
Hall will be protected from further in
jury to a wrenched thigh, and Reeves'
knee cap will be carefully bound.
Howard Is Probable Referee.
The problem of cnoosing a referee
for the Stanford-California intercolle
giate game suitable to the coaches of
both institutions is assuming bigger
proportions day by day to Managers
Wilcox and Stroud. Victor Howard,
from Cupertino, in all likelihood, will
be the compromise official. It was
hoped that the question would be de
cided last Saturday, when Howard was
scheduled to hold the whistle in the
California-Santa Clara match, but his
failure to putin an appearance leaves
the matter still an open one.
In addition to Howard. Rev. Mullin
eaux, and L. S. Reading are acceptable
to Stanford. California has put up
Lafferty as her first choice, but as to
who her second and third choice may
be no inkling has been given. Wilcox
will go to San Francisco Monday even
ing in another attempt to definitely
settle the question, after a conference
with Manager Stroud, of California.
Game Scheduled Willi Sacramento.
Manager Wilcox announced today
that he had completed arrangements
for a post-season game between the
Sacramento Athletic Club and the
Stanford Varsity. The contest will be
played on Thanksgiving day at the
state capital. The northern club team
has not played any of the Bay City
fifteens for two years, and as a result
is more or less of an unknown quanti
ty. According to such critics of rugby
as L. S. Reading, referee of note, and
Coach Brown, the Sacramento ruggers
stand on equal terms with the Olymp
ics and Barbarians.
Berkeley High Alumni vs. Palo Alto.
Plans for another post-season rug
by contest are being laid which will
bring together the alumni from the
Palo Alto and Berkeley high schools
in a game to be played on the Univer
sity of California turf two weeks fol
lowing the annual Big Game. Such a
contest, should produce a fast exhi
bition of the English game, since dur
ing each of the past four years these
two preparatory schools have fought it
out for the northern championship of
the state, and always hnve managed to
place several men annually on both
the Cardinal and Blue and Gold Var
sities. Among the Palo Alto alumni
ruggers of note from which a fifteen
will bo selected are such men as Dar
sie. Thoburn. Boulware, Lnchmund,
Davidson. Soper. Corbett, Risling. Wal
lace. Card. Huttman. Templeton. Glad-
stone and Dubendorf. The Berkeley
alumni also claim a number of stars
among the graduates in players of such
renown as Hardy, Austin, Harris, the
Forbes brothers, Lazar, the Slater
brothers, and Knowles.
700 Tickets Sold for Football Show.
That the Gaiety Theatre production,
"Let's Get Married," will be staged
before a big Stanford crowd, was as
sured yesterday by the brisk seat sale,
at which seven hundred tickets to the
musical comedy were sold. Those still
desiring to see the foot'nll show, may
purchase tickets at the Bookstore. A
number of good seats remain.
The Varsity Grays defeated the
Blacks yesterday afternoon in a fast
fight on the football field to the tune
of 11 to G. Many of the regular var
sity players were given a rest. Consid
ering the number of sustitutes who
were putin the game during the two
fifteen-minute halves the squad made
a good showing. A penalty drop-kick
by Templeton scored the first points
for the Grays at the beginning of the
first half. A passing rush from
Reeves to Carroll to Clover was a fea
ture of the first fifteen minutes of
play, and resulted in a try for the
Grays. Rurns made the last goal for
the victors.
Referee Reading, one of the eligibles
considered for the big game of Novem
ber 14, held the whistle.
