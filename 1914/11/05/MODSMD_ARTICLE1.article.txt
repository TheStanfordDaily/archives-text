# SECOND VARSITY TEAM MAY MEET CALIFORNIA
## Minor Contest Is Possible Preliminary For an All-Star Game to Be Played in San Francisco CREW GRANTED NEW SHELL Wilcox Signs Contract With Billy Orr Securing His Services as Baseball Coach. 
### 
A Second Varsity game with Califor
nia is in the air. The Executive Com
mittee, at their last night's meeting,
authorized the graduate manager to
confer with the University of Califor
nia authorities regarding a second
team .rugby game, and, if it is satisfac
tory to the California "powers-that
be," the rugby fans will have a chance
to see the All-Blacks in action against
a worthy foe.
Several dates of staging this con
test are being considered. One of
these is Saturday, November twenty
first, a week after the Rig Game. It
would serve as a curtain-raiser for
the All-British-All-American game at
Recreation Park, if played at this
time. Other possible dates are
Thanksgiving Day, November twenty
sixth, and the Saturday following
Thanksgiving, November twenty
eighth. For these days Ewing Field,
California Field and Recreation Park
are the possible grounds. Tf the Bar
harian-Olympic Club game is sched
uled for playing off before November
twenty-eighth, it is possible that the
Second Varsity match will be coupled
with the event, and a double admis
sion charged.
The game will positively not be
played later than November twenty
eighth, owing to scholastic require
ments. Definite arrangements will be
made as soon as possible.
Tn the event of the match being
played, it is highly possible that some
form of letter or numeral will be giv
en to the men engaging in the con
test. This method of rewarding the
second string men is followed in large
eastern universities at the present
time.
Rillv Orr will coach next season's
Varsity baseball squad. Satisfactory
terms have been reached with the
well-known star, and final arrange
ments completed. Orr has had major
league experience as utility infielder
fo.r the Philadelphia Americans, and
last season starred at shortstop for the
Sacramento Wolves, now the San
Francisco Missions. He has played
before campus fans with several
teams, among them Ireland's all-stai
aggregation. Orr's stickwork and sen
sational fielding have always featured
any game in which he has participated
against the Varsity.
Stanford crew men are to have a
new shell. Full funds for the pur
chase of this equipment were voted
by the Executive Committee, and the
graduate manacer was instructed to
purchase it immediately. This will
fill a long felt want in rowing circles,
and will enable the coach to give more
men work-outs, as last year's shell
will probably be used for training pur
poses next year.
Not content with this improvement,
the Executive Committee appointed a
committee, consisting of T,. R. Reine
man. '15, C. 11. Orme, '1 fi, and R. W.
Wilcox. '13. to confer with TT. A. Ree
ger, '13, concerning a new coaching
launch. Reeger is thoroughly ac
quainted with the needs of the crew
men. and will greatly assist the com
mittee in securing a suitable launch.
Coach Guerena has had great dif
ficulty heretofore in keeping track of
the work of aspirants for the varsity.
Under the new system he will be able
to follow the work of three or four
crews with less effort than was be
fore required to watch one shell.
The full minutes of the Executive
Committee follow:
Worthy in chair. All present. Min
utes of last meeting read and ap
proved.
Discussion of crew situation.
Moved that committee, consisting of
Reineman, Orme, Wilcox, be appointed
to confer with H. A. Beeger, '13, con
cerning coaching launch.
Graduate Manager Wilcox reported
that terms had been reached with Bil
ly Orr to coach the baseball team.
Proposed that a Second Varsity
game be scheduled with California for
week following Big Came or Thanks
giving Day.
Recognition of services of Second
Varsity football men discussed.
Graduate manager instructed to pur
chase new shell immediately.
Adjourned.
PAUL McCLOSKEY, Secretary.
