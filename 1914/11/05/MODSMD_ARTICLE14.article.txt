# Second Varsity Game
## 
### 
Stanford may meet California on the
rugby field for a second time this se
mester, the second teams trying con
clusions, if satisfactory arrangements
as to time and place prove possible.
As is evident at first glance, the con
test would be more of an exhibition
rugby match for near-varsity material
than intercollegiate competition, and
the basis for its proposal—the Belgian
Relief Fund —would add even more to
its essentially non-collegiate aspect.
The Daily Palo Alto believes that
this is an unusual opportunity for that
great portion of our football squad
which is scattered in the bleachers at
the Big Game. It is an easy solution
of the problem of recognizing the ef
forts of the second string men, and
should engender the best of spirit
with the fifteen at California that fol
low the Varsity on the list.
Rivalry in sports comes to a white
heat on the day of the Varsity clash,
but with the final whistle of that
game, quickly cools. The second
game a week later would not
cost either players or students sleep,
and with the All-American-British
match, should furnish fine sport. A
thousand skeptics of the college game
would have proof that skill in that
sport is not limited to a lionized fif
teen.
One restriction there should be —
November twenty-first is far prefer
able to Thanksgiving Day or the Sat
urday following. And California Field
has less of the professional taint than
has San Francisco's ball park—unless
the resulting gain to the Belgian sup
ply ship dispels the thought.
