One thousand and seventy men will
pack sections seven and eight in tlie
bleachers at California Field on the
fourteenth —the Stanford rooting sec
tion will contribute its fair share to
the' bedlam that is out for the short
eighty minutes of play. The masses
will lie struck with bleacher hysteria,
and Noise will be supreme.
But in the calmer moments—if these
are to be —the expression of hope,
courage and loyalty—and above all,
mental stress—is to be through song
The good old Stanford songs of Car
dinal fight and the spirit that wins, and
one or two of the later efforts, will
come to mind and all the strength of
tired throats will fling the chorus to
restive crowds and quiet skies. This,
if we know the songs—for what is
weaker than mumbled verses?

Yesterday's Field Day afforded the
first opportunity fox a much-needed
song practice. Saturday's games will
be the second —personal pride and joy
in Cardinal should send every Stan
ford man into the bleacher choir for
the short-lesson course in harmony.
