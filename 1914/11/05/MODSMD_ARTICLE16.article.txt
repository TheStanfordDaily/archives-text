# The
						Thousandth Man

### 
The following lines are an example
of the "friendship poetry" of Riulyard
Kipling. Though different in theme
from his other verse, it stands on the
same high plane of merit and popu
larity :
that of Robert Service:
One man in a thousand, Solomon says,
Will stick more close than a broth
er.
And it's worth while seeking him half
your days
If you find him before the other.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine depend
On what the world sees in you,
But the Thousandth Man will stand
your friend
With the whole round world agin
you.
'Tis neither promise nor prayer nor
show
Will settle the finding for'ee
Nine hundred and ninety-nine of 'em
go
By your looks or your acts or your
glory.
But if he finds you and you find him,
The rest of the world don't matter;
Fo.r the Thousandth Man would sink
or swim
With you in any water.
You can use his purse with no more
talk
Than he uses yours for his spend
ings;
And laugh and meet in your daily walk
As tho' there had been no lendings.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine of 'em
call
For silver and gold in their deal
ings;
But the Thousandth Man he's worth
'em all,
Because you can show him your feel
ings!
His wrong's your wrong, and his
right's your right,
Tn season o.r out of season.
Stand up and back it in all men's
sight—
With that for your only reason!
Nine hundred and ninety-nine can't
bide
The shame or mocking or laughter,
But the Thousandth Man will stand by
your side
To the gallows-foot—and after!
