# "Davy Jones" Starves Self For Seventy Days and For Seventy Nights
## 
### 
Davy Jones, of the Zoology Depart
ment, swore off his fast yesterday,
and took his first meal for eight
weeks.
Davy has been fasting ever since he
arrived on the campus at the beginning
of the semester from the Pacific
Grove establishment of the Universi
ty. It wasn't that he had made a New
Year's resolution that Davy fasted,
but because there was nothing in his
present glass quarters that he could
consume; consequently Davy was
obliged to forswear eating.
Davy received his name because he
was a denizen of the deep before com
ing to Stanford. Had he remained
with the waters of the broad Pacific,
Davy would probably have never tried
to fast, for there is many a choice
dinner floating around loose in the
ocean—for some.
Yesterday Davy saw a dinner float
ing his way just as they used to come
at Pacific Grove. It was a fine fat
mussel caught by a student of the
Zoology Department in the Bay last
Saturday. Davy forgot to fast and
ate the mussel with the relish of a
starving man devouring a juicy steak.
Now the fast will be started again,
for there are no more mussels on the
campus, and Davy must be particu
lar of his diet.
You see, Davy is the pet starfish of
the Zoology Department.
