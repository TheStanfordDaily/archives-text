# On the Quiet

### 
Pessimistically speaking, as a char
ity event. Field Day last night was a
success. A great deal was accom
plished under cover of darkness.
Nothing New Under llie Sun.
'Neath summer sun my lady stood,
The summer's blossoms in her
hands.
With rash resolve, 1 cried aloud:
"I'll kiss her where f-he stands!"
Then softly my Alter Ego spoke:
"Worship the ground on which she
walks.
Rut bear in mind that time-worn joke
And kiss her where she talks."
â€”May Hurlburt, '02, in the first Chap
arral.
