The October number of the "Alum
nus" is ready for distribution, and
will be placed on sale tomorrow.
Filled with timely, pointed articles the
"Alumnus" reviews in a clear, con
cise manner the recent University ac
tivities of both alumni and under
graduates.
The frontispiece is a group picture
of the Alumni Advisory Roard and
President Branner, taken in front of
the bleachers October 24, when the
members of the Board were guests of
the student body at the football game
with Santa Clara.
The leading article of the magazine
is an essay by the editor, E. W. Smith.
'99 in which he dwells on the history,
organization, and purposes of the Ad
visory Board, in connection with the
possibility of another Stanford gradu

tion of Stanford people to aid in re
lieving the distress
Other articles discuss President
Branner's first year as head executive,
building activities, the prospect for a
golf links, the Santa Clara game, va
rious fall athletics and other events
of interest, not overlooking the pre
ignition of this year's Freshman bon
fire.
