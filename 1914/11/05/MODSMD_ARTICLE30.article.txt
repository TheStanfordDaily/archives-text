# BARBS MAY FURNISH LAST PRACTICE FOR SOCCER MEN
## TRAINER MALONEY FAVORS GAME BEFORE INTERCOLLEGIATE. First Go With California Dated for Morning of Fourteenth—Cardinal Form Improved. 
### 
With the first intercollegiate soc
cer game only a week off, Trainer Ma
loney has been endeavoring to ar
range one more preliminary match for
the Stanford eleven.
Although no game had been slated
for this week-end under the Exposi
tion League Schedule, the Cardinal
players may line up against the Bar
barian Club on Saturday for • Stan
ford's final practice match.
The first intercollegiate game will
be staged on California Field the morn
ing of November 14. It will be the first
in the alumni soccer series of three
games played by the rival universi
ties.
The preliminary games have not fur
nished much indication of the rela
tive strength of the collegiate elevens,
but the game on the 14th promises to
be close and hard-fought. Stanford
will send a team onto the field with
only four veterans of last year's inter
collegiate soccer combination. Cali
fornia has the best team in her soccer
history. Captain Kellas will head a
fast eleven, made up almost entirely of
seasoned soccorites. Early predictions
this season pointed to a California
victory, but the Cardinal players have
recently shown a consistent improve
ment in form.
