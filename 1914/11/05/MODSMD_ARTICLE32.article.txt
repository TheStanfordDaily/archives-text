# MEAGER THRONGS ATTEND FIRST RUGBY FIELD DAY
## R.L. TEMPLETON, '18, GARNERS EIGHT POINTS. Gard and Urban Close Seconds—Dashes and Medley Contribute Interest—Song Practice Held. 
### 
A few handfuls of football devotees
and the Stanford Rand saw the first
annual rugby field day on the turf
yesterday afternoon. Speed in the
sprints, and kicking for accuracy and
distance were uniformly good among
the competitors from the ranks of the
varsity squad.
Though the judges hurried their
events off the program, darkness set
tled before all were finished, and the
bleachers had to guess who the win
ners of the last act, the "medley,"
were
R. L. Templeton, 'IS, the rangy
brother of "Ric" Templeton, carried
away eight points, trie winning num
ber. "Deke" Gard and .Toe Urban tied
for a hair's breadth second with seven
and one-half points. R. R. Templeton
garnered five and six-sevenths points,
winning third place. Art Erb was
fourth in line with five and one-half
points.
The punt for distance from beside
the east goal post was won by Art Erb
with a beautiful boot which carried
the ball sixty-one yards; second, R.
L. Templeton, 56 1-3; third, Gard, 52
1-3; fourth R. R. Templeton, 52 yards.
Captain Gard easily edged ahead of
the other forwards in their fifty-five
yard dash to the center field line, cov
ering the distance in (5 2-5 seconds:
second, Cole; third, Bloeser.
The race of the backfiekl entrants
over the same stretch was won by
Urban, who nosed ahead of Temple
ton and Kirksev in the last ten yards
with a great spurt, finishing in 6 3-"
seconds; R .R. Templeton, second;
Kirksey, third.
Drop-kicking for goal, in which both
distance and accuracy were rated, was
won by R. L. Templeton in a pretty
competition. The contestants drop
ed from three positions. From the in
tersection of the twenty-five-yard line
with the five-yard line: from the cen
ter of the forty-five-yard line; and
from* a position chosen by the con
testant. Successful drops were
achieved by Templeton from the sec
ond and last positions, netting him
three out of a possible five points.
Tied for second place, with a credit
of one tally each were West, R. R.
Templeton. Austin, Kester, Beale
Wylie and Blase. Each of the second
place men negotiated the close-in
kick.
Most interesting of all the events
was the last on the schedule, termed
by Coach Brown, who is responsible
for the program, a. football medley. A
team of two men covered the length of
the field, dribbling, scooping, kicking
ahead, recovering, passing, and scor
ing a try.
Austin and Urban took first place;
Henry and Cole, second: R. R .Tem
pleton and Lachmund. third; Gard and
Erb, fourth.
Carey Nixon and his assistant yell
yeaders had the help of the band in
drilling the meagre bleachers in four
new Stanford songs. The bleacher
practice was successful, considering
the small number of rooters present.
There were as many women present
as there were men in the rooting sec
tion.
