Stanford students are taking a live

Hooth Home, which is located in the
old Seal residence in Mavfield, and
are engaged in active social work as
instructors for the little tots living
there.
Miss Madeline Turner, '16, and Miss
Stella Connelly, '16, have charge of
athletics, instructing the children in
gymnasium work and basketball. Miss
Elsa Olcese, 'l. r >, directs the sewing de
partment; Miss .lessimine Hunt, '16,
and Miss Florence Gates, '15, look to
the personal workâ€”taking the chil
dren walking or driving; Miss Nellita
Choate. '17, develops them as much
as possible along literary lines, and
Miss Christine Walther, '14, is tak
ing her practice teaching in the kin
dergarten at the home.
The establishment is conducted on a
sympathetic "home" basis, and the
staff, which includes many of the
Stanford women, feels the children's
need of individual care and attention.
An Art Major is especially needed, and
also some one who understands
basketry and clay modelling.
The heads of the committees will be
glad to hear from any one interested
in thei.r work. Children's clothes are
needed very much, and donations will
be received by Miss Eilleen Everett,
'15, in the rest room.
