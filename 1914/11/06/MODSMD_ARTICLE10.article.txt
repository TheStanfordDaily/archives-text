# LINE SHIFT PRECEDES FINAL TEST OF VARSITY
## ST. MARY'S PLAYERS MATCHED WITH ALL-BLACKS IN CURTAIN-RAISER. INVALID STARS BACK IN GAME THIRD AND FOURTH TEAMS WILL BE SENT TO FACE HOLLISTER AND SAN JOSE. 
### 
Dopesters, rugby experts, and root
ers will be afforded their last oppor
tunity tomorrow afternoon to size up
the Stanford Varsity, when the Car
dinal ruggers clash with the Winged
"O" fifteen in the final preliminary
match of the season, previous to the
intercollegiate battle with California
November 14. Saturday promises to
be a gala day, as an athletic card,
since in addition to the Olympic game,
the All-Blacks will line-up against St.
Mary's while the Third and Fourth
Varsities will play Hollister and San
Jose high school, respectively, away
from home.
Coach Brown ha>- announced that he
will put forth his strongest possible
front against the Bay City clubmen,
but as yet cannot state what the exact
personnel of the Varsity will be. The
tentative line-up, however, includes
two radical changes which will give
dope-sheet compilers of the Big Game
fifteen much food for thought. Clover,
who fo.r practically the entire season
has held down a .niddle-rank berth,
has been shifted to a substitute posi
tion at front rank. Rehm, who has
come to the front at a fast clip in the
past few games, will fill in for Clover
with Pettingill as his middle-rank
mate. The remaining places in the
pack will be upheld by Hall. Soper,
Wines, Wylie, Blase, and Captain Gard.
The emergency men are Braden, Card,
and Halsted.
The same backfield. which has
played through all the eight previous
practice matches of the season, will
institute passing rushes in tomorrow's
contest. Erb will start at half with
the Freshman, Walker, as substitute.
The five-eighths positions will be as
sumed by the regular duo, Austin and
Lachmund, Swiga.rt acting as relief
man for the second five position. Car
roll, as usual, will fill center three
quarters. Urban and Reeves, the
latter having recovered from all
effects of the injuries sustained
to his knee in the Santa Clara
game, will play opposite each oth
er at wings, while Burns will be
their only substitute. The old reli
able, Helmus Andrews, has been ap
pointed custodian of the last defense.
There is not a man on the list just
enumerated who is not in perfect con
dition fo.r the Big Game today, accord
ing to Trainer Harry Maloney.
The Varsity has met the Olympic
Club fifteen heretofore on two differ
ent occasions, each time emerging is
victor. September 12, the Winged "O"
players were defeated 17 to 0 in an
easy fashion. The game October 10,
however, was close and bard fought.
Tn the first half neither team pro
duced a score. Stanford won out in
the second period mainly through bet
ter condition. 19 to 5. A more or less
even contest, therefore, may be antici
pated.
An official, new to the campus fol
lowers. "Bill" Howard, has been se
cured by Manager Wilcox to handle
the whistle in the Varsity-Winged
"O" game. Howard, who conies from
Cupertino, 's an old New Zealand rug
by player of prominence, and lias won
quite a reputation as a referee of abili
ty. Both halves of the contest will be
of thirty-five-minute duration. The
game will commence promptly at ?>
The curtain-raiser, in which the
Stanford All-Blacks will vie with
Faulkner's fifteen from St. Mary'.;,
should be an alluring attraction tj
those desiring a fast aud exciting ex
hibition of the English game. Coach
Brown has named the most powerful
second-string team yet to trot out onto
the turf. In their only campus appear
ance of the season the Mission rug
gers defeated the Freshmen 14 to 9,
October 17. A week ago the Californ'a
Varsity triumphed over St. Mary's 24
to 3. Palmer Fuller will referee the
contest, which will commence at 2:30.
The Third Varsity, chosen from men
both on the inside and outside squads,
will journey to Hollister to play the
local high school. E. B. Wilkins, '17, has
been chosen captain of the fifteen.
They will take the 7:30 train from
Palo Alto tomorrow morning. The
Fourth Varsity, or Team A, composed
entirely of men in the Bush Rugger
League, will contest with San Jose
high school in the morning in the
Garden City. Games between Teams B
and C will be played on the outside
turf in the forenoon at eleven o'clock.
Coach Brown wishes it to be under
stood that no man who is a member of
the football squad will be permitted to
enter either the Plug Ugly or the post
er fights.
