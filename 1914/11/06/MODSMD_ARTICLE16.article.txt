Tnited Press Telegraphic Report
Paris, Nov. 6. —Officials at head
quarters say that the present situation
on the battle front resembles the con
ditions when the Germans began to
retreat from the Marne, two months
ago. The Communique comments on
the presence of veteran troops in the
reinforcements that the Germans are
bringing up, and says that their pres
ence might indicate a new attempt at
the offensive, but it is more likely
that they are being sent to halt the
bloody repulse which has just been in
flicted.
These are the troops which Dutch
sources yesterday reported as en route
via Liege and Aix-la-Chapelle.
Turks Admit Army Demoralized.
Athens, Nov. 6.—Constantinople de
clares that the Turkish army has been
partly demoralized by the suddenness
of the Russian attack, which entirely
upset the plans of the army council.
Cold Too Mncli for Germans in East.
Petrograd, Nov. 6.—The war office
claims that the Germans are retreat
ing precipitately in East Prussia and
that the Russians are harassing their
rear. The cold has apparently de
moralized the Teutons, for many of
them surrender without firing a shot.
Denials From Berlin.
Berlin (via The Hague), Nov. 6.—
The wounding of the Crown Prince
and other members of the royal family
is officially denied. It is declared that
all are in excellent health, and that
the Crown Prince is at the front and
is continually on o.r near the firing
line. An official report states that
the assault of the Belgians and Eng
lish by way of Nieuport, between the
sea and the inundated country, has
been repulsed. Another official an
nouncement declares that, although
the warships supported the allies,
they were forced to abandon their
dead and wounded. The German ad
vance toward the coast of Belgium and
France is progressing in a satisfac
tory manner.
Naval Warfare on Land.
Paris, Nov. 6. —The Germans are at
tempting to renew the battle of the
Yser in Belgium. The Belgiums re
ported that the enemy has requisi
tioned many boats at Bruges, and is
expected to attempt to cross the deep
est waters of the country to the north.
Allied artillery lias been mounted to
frustrate this move.
General Battle Unchanged.
Paris, Nov. 6. —The Communique
states that a series of bayonet charges
has checked the German advance in
the Argonne region, near the Meuse,
and that the Teutons have been
pressed further bnck. The general sit
uation in the north remains un
changed. The most violent fighting
continues on a line extending from
Dixmunde, ten miles east of Niueport,
to the river Lvs, thirty miles southeast,
thence to the Somme, fifty miles south.
The efforts of the Germans to pene
trate the allied line toward the coast
continue with varying gains and loss
es at the several points, but the gener
al battle line is unchanged.
