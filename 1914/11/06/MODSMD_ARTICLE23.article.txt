# The 						Vanished Days

Sitice Tuesday's ballots were
checked 011 the tally sheets, the fol
lowing verse is hardly applicable to
California, yet it may voice the hope
of the minority. The writer is evi
dently a Prohibitionist (?):
Lay the jest about the julep in the
champor balls at last,
For the miracle has happened and the
olden days are past;
That which makes Milwaukee thirsty
doesn't foam in Tennessee,
And the lid in old Virginia is as tight
locked as can be —
Oh the comic paper Colonel and his
cronies well may sigh.
For the mint is waving gayly and the
South is going dry.
By the still side on the hillside in Ken
tucky all is still,
For the only damp refreshment must
be dipped up from the rill
North Carolina's stately .ruler gives
his soda glass a shove.
And discusses prohibition with the
South Ca'lina Gov.
It is useless at the fountain to be
winlcful of the eye,
For the cocktail is dusty and the South
is going dry.
Lay the jest about, the julep beneath
the chestnut tree at last.
For there's but one kind of moonshine
and the olden days are past;
Now the water wagon rumbles through
the Southland on its trip.
And it helps no one to drop off to pick
up the driver's whip,
For the mint beds make a pasture and
the cork-screw hangeth high,
All is stil lalong the stillside, and the
South is going dry.
