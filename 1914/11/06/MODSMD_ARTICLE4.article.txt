Boom! Boom! Boom!
More "booms."
Heard them? Wonder what they
are?
Echoes from the European war,
maybe, or an invasion from the Ori
ent? Perhaps the Uhlans have come
to California? Maybe it's Huerta down
south shooting up a band of rival rev
olutionists.
Might be some fanatics from a rival
college practicing "blowing up the
Quad." Maybe it's preparations for the
second premature burning of the bon
fire.
At any rate these "booms" that
been jarring our nerves, give us a
sinister feeling that something is go
ing to happen, just because we don't
know that they are really vital blasts
to Stanford.
The "booms" are the first blasts to
clear away the wreckage of the old
gymnasium. Farm Manager Hewston
is removing the last remains of the
old structure. The new gymnasium is
being built.
That being the case, let 'em "boom."
Boom! Boom! Boom!
More "booms."
