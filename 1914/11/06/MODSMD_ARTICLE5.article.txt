## Several Men Will Have to Leave College Unless Work Is Provided Immediately. 
### 
Financial conditions in the country,
especially in the eastern states, are
playing havoc with the money affairs
of many Stanford students. There is
a probability of several students being
compelled to leave college unless they
can secure aid in the way of employ
ment immediately.
Several men who have not been
receiving financial help from home
have applied to the secretary of the
Y. M. C. A. for work during the past
week. Their source of supply has
been cut off, and they will be com
pelled to leave the college before the
end of the semester unless some new
means of raising money is provided im
mediately. Less work has been of
fered this year than before. All the
positions which have been listed with
Lockwood are already being filled.
In view of these conditions, which
are really vital to the men whom they
touch. Secretary Lockwood is making
a personal appeal to all campus organ
izations and all residents of the cam
pus and of Palo Alto to employ student
labor in every case where it is pos
sible. Any kind of work, whether odd
jobs about the house or yard, or regu
lar positions as waiters can be filled
by students.
