# SOPHOMORE PLAYERS REHEARSING HOW TO OFFER "READY MONEY"
## Montgomery's Brilliant Comedy Pictures Conflict Between Love and Finance in Life of Typical Young New Yorker PROMISING PLAYERS CAST 
### 
Rehearsals of "Ready Money," the
clever comedy selected for production
in Assembly Hall November 20 by the
most promising talent in the Sopho
more class, are being held almost daily
under the direction of Coach Mathieu.
The second-year players have already
a comprehensive idea of their individu
al characterizations and their initial
dramatic effort promises to be the suc
cess of the year. James Montgomery,
the author of the play, has combined
thrills and laughs in a manner that
makes an ir.resistable appeal.
"Ready Money" is an unknown quan
tity to Stephen Baird when the come
dy opens. The scene is a New York
apartment on New Year's eve. Baird,
member of half a dozen clubs,
whose membership is a cachet of
indisputable social position, alum
nus of one of the oldest American
colleges, intimate friend of half
the wealthy young chaps of New York,
engaged to Grace Tyler, daughter of n
retired multi-millionaire, is down to
h;s very last quarter of a dollar. He
has everything on earth worth having
except cash. He owns a gold mine,
"The Skyrocket," but its tangible as
sets are principally paper.
Baird had found "The Skyrocket"
mine in Arizona only partially devel
oped, but with enough machinery to
run it in a small way. He had taken a
thirty-days' option and pa'd down a
thousand dollars cash —one-tenth of
his precious capital, upon the increase
of which depended the consent of the
Tylers to his marriage with Grace.
The price of the mine was $30,000.
Baird had been sure of getting the oth
er $20,000, but at the last minute the
loan had failed to materialize. Prices
jumped, however, when Morgan, whn
owned the "Safety" mine, next to the
"Skyrocket," came back to Arizona,
where he had made all his money. The
financier could get the handsome quo
ation of $100,000 of the "Skyrocket" so
"Old Morgan," with little faith in
Baird's business ability, saw his
chance. Morgan had loaned his $20,-
000 on a note due January 1. The next
day the note would be due—and there
was no $20,000 ready at Stephen's hand
to protect his name. Morgan would
grab in the "Skyrocket" at a net cost of
$20,000, because Stephen hadn't been
able to float his mine and sell the
stock.
This is the situation when the cur
tain rises on the first act. How Baird
handles his difficult position through
the assistance of Jackson Ives, and
how he turns threatened disaster into
victory is told in stirring fashion in
the three acts of Montgomery's clever
comedy.
The play committee is to lie congrat
ulated upon the choice of a cast, so
well suited to the parts in every in
stance. F. R. Johnston, '17, will be
seen in the leading role of Stephen
Baird. He has the requisite tempera
ment for this complex part and prom
ises to acquit himself with distinction
in his first appearance on the campus
stage. Hardly of less Importance is
the role of Jackson Ives, to be inter
preted by F. C. McCulloeh, '17. This un
usual part offers almost unlimited op
portunities which McColloch is fully
capable of developing to the proper de
gree of polish and poise. The role of
"Morgan," the financier, will be in the
capable hands of E. H. Evans, '17.
Miss Esther Liversidge, '17, whose
sterling work In the last Junior Opera
is fresh in campus memory, will reveal
an entirely new phase of talent as
Grace Tyler, the feminine lead. Miss
Grace Seward, '17. and M. E. Tedford,
'17, will revel in the delightful roles
of the Tyler parents.

whose membership is a cachet of
indisputable social position, alum
nus of one of the oldest American
colleges, intimate friend of half
the wealthy young chaps of New York,
engaged to Grace Tyler, daughter of n
retired multi-millionaire, is down to
h;s very last quarter of a dollar. He
has everything on earth worth having
except cash. He owns a gold mine,
"The Skyrocket," but its tangible as
sets are principally paper.
Baird had found "The Skyrocket"
mine in Arizona only partially devel
oped, but with enough machinery to
run it in a small way. He had taken a
thirty-days' option and pa'd down a
thousand dollars cash —one-tenth of
his precious capital, upon the increase
of which depended the consent of the
Tylers to his marriage with Grace.
The price of the mine was $30,000.
Baird had been sure of getting the oth
er $20,000, but at the last minute the
loan had failed to materialize. Prices
jumped, however, when Morgan, whn
owned the "Safety" mine, next to the
"Skyrocket," came back to Arizona,
where he had made all his money. The
financier could get the handsome quo
ation of $100,000 of the "Skyrocket" so
"Old Morgan," with little faith in
Baird's business ability, saw his
chance. Morgan had loaned his $20,-
000 on a note due January 1. The next
day the note would be due—and there
was no $20,000 ready at Stephen's hand
to protect his name. Morgan would
grab in the "Skyrocket" at a net cost of
$20,000, because Stephen hadn't been
able to float his mine and sell the
stock.
This is the situation when the cur
tain rises on the first act. How Baird
handles his difficult position through
the assistance of Jackson Ives, and
how he turns threatened disaster into
victory is told in stirring fashion in
the three acts of Montgomery's clever
comedy.
The play committee is to lie congrat
ulated upon the choice of a cast, so
well suited to the parts in every in
stance. F. R. Johnston, '17, will be
seen in the leading role of Stephen
Baird. He has the requisite tempera
ment for this complex part and prom
ises to acquit himself with distinction
in his first appearance on the campus
stage. Hardly of less Importance is
the role of Jackson Ives, to be inter
preted by F. C. McCulloeh, '17. This un
usual part offers almost unlimited op
portunities which McColloch is fully
capable of developing to the proper de
gree of polish and poise. The role of
"Morgan," the financier, will be in the
capable hands of E. H. Evans, '17.
Miss Esther Liversidge, '17, whose
sterling work In the last Junior Opera
is fresh in campus memory, will reveal
an entirely new phase of talent as
Grace Tyler, the feminine lead. Miss
Grace Seward, '17. and M. E. Tedford,
'17, will revel in the delightful roles
of the Tyler parents.
Rehearsals of "Ready Money," the
clever comedy selected for production
in Assembly Hall November 20 by the
most promising talent in the Sopho
more class, are being held almost daily
under the direction of Coach Mathieu.
The second-year players have already
a comprehensive idea of their individu
al characterizations and their initial
dramatic effort promises to be the suc
cess of the year. James Montgomery,
the author of the play, has combined
thrills and laughs in a manner that
makes an ir.resistable appeal.
"Ready Money" is an unknown quan
