United Press Telegraphic Report
London, Nov. 9.—The Czar's army
has now attained its full momentum.
The swiftness of its movements has
startled the experts here. Officials de
clare that Russia is sending numerous
motor sledges to the front. These en
able the Slavs to move their artillery
rapidly during the winter. The reports
of continuous Russian victories came
sooner than Kitchener and his advisors
had hoped.
The Kaiser Admits Retreat in Prussia.
Berlin (via Amsterdam), Nov. 9. —
It is officially admitted that the Ger
mans have retired behind the Warthe
river, in East Prussia, although Teu
ton officials do not concern themselves
seriously with the Russian advance. It
is reported that many great estates in
this district have been deserted, and
that thei.r inhabitants have fled to
the interior. Vienna is said to be ex
cited over the Russian victories, al
though the war office declares that the
German and Austrian armies are intact
and are merely making a strategic
retreat, which has not interfered with
their good order. The situation in the
west is unchanged generally, although
the Teutons are making some gains in
the Argonne region near the Meuse.
Huss Octopus Spreads Arms.
Petrograd, Nov. 9. —The advance of
the great Russian bear is continuing
with alacrity all along the battle line.
Official reports state that the advance
guard has passed the river Warthe,
and captured Pleschen, ten miles in
side the province of Posen. The East
Prussian advance is being driven back
from the territory of Wirballen, which
it has so long occupied, to Lyck, fifteen
miles within the German frontier. Mil
itary experts now rega.rd the capture
of Kracow by the invaders of Austria
as unavoidable. Kracow is a strongly
fortified stragetic site vital to the de
fence of the country within which it
lies. The advance guard of the south
ern Rusisan army has already reached
Niszica. All the Austrians operating
further than thirty-five miles from the
beleagured city, have been isolated
from the main defending army.
China's Participation Threatened.
Rerlin (via The Hague), Nov. 9.—It.
was stated semi-officially here today
that Japan, through a violation of
China's neutrality, threatened to pro
voke her neighbor across the Yellow
Sea into a declaration of war.
Admiralty Policy Confronts Commons.
London, Nov. 9. —The British Parlia
ment will reconvene next Wednesday.
The principal interest will no doubt
center in the attack of the opposition
members of the admiralty policy. A
revision of the strict censorship laws
is also likely to come up for discussion,
since there is a great demand for the
publication of more authentic war
news. It is the concensus of opinion
that the scarcity of news is tlie cause
of the comparatively slight response
to the call for English recruits. There
is no opportunity for arousing a just
sense of patrotism.
