# Memorize the Words
## 
### 
Three days will complete the calen
dar of available dates for the bleach
erites' lessons in Stanford songs—
tlu'ee practice hours have been set for
the short course in harmony. Howev
er, the opportunity to mark the lilt
and memorize the words of the half
dozen swinging songs that will come
from the Cardinal bleachers on Satur
day is not limited to these appointed
times.
Hiue prints of the latest additions
to the song-book have been widely
distributed, and by this method words
and music of the last are as easily
learned as those of the familiar tunes
of past years.
Each Stanford rooter should ap
point himself a committee of one to
check his own familiarity with the
songs and the knowledge of his next
door neighbor. Then the chorus will
swell above any widely flung refrain —
the song will be more than a whisper
trom the West Bleacher.
