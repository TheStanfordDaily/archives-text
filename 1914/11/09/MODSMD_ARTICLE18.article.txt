The present plan of distribution ol
the Big Game tickets makes the stu
dent the middle-man in any attempt
of an outside enthusiast to secure the
entrance billet. This is an additional
temptation to some to raise the price,
to 'scalp' the tickets for whatever they
may obtain. In some districts of the
country this is an offense, punishable
by fine and imprisonment—to Stanford

tuous disregard for the fair name of
the University. "Scalping" is an un
recognized offspring of professional
ism.
