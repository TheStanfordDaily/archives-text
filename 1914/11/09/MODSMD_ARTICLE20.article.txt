United Press Telegraphic Report
London, Nov. 9. â€”A dispatch from
the Petrograd Post states that it is
the latest policy of the Czar to let the
allied forces of England and France
compete with Germany unaided, in
order that the Russians may direct
their attack chiefly against subduing
Austria and Turkey.
