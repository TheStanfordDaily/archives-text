Mark Anthony DeWolfe Howe, a
writer and editor of note, is a large
contributor to America's modern liter
ature. His writings vary from the
deepest of prose works to poems of the
lightest nature. An example of the
latter appears today:
Pounding away in a rythm bound
as in fetters of brass.
Marches the band; —behind it, the
wildly rythmical mass
Of headlong, happiest youth, with
hats flung thro* the space
Where the conquering ball had sailed,
with arms chance-linked for the
race
To join the swirling, delirious, serpen
tine measure of joy
That wells from the leaping heart of
every precipitate boy.
What sends from my older heart the
mist to my musing eyes?
Not envy, 1 think, for all that nig
gardly age denies;
But something akin to pity—even at
this flaming hour
Filled with triumph of sharing the joy
of triumphant power—
Pity that ever the jubilant springs
must fail of their flow.
And the youth, so utterly knowing it
not, must one day know.
