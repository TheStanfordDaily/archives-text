# War May Delay Campanile Chimes.
## 
### 
The Campanile bells at California,
may not ring until the war in Europe
is ended. It is possible that the bells
may not even leave their continental
factory before that time. According
to Professor John Galen Howard, su
pervising architect, it is impossible to
order the chimes at this time. Mean
while the stone work on the big tower
is up to the level where the chimes
will be placed.
