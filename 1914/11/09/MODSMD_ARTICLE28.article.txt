United Press Telegraphic Report
Philadelphia, Nov. 9. —For the first
time in years Gomper's .rule over the
American Federation of Labor is seri
ously in danger. The delegates of the
mine workers, garment workers, and
other organizations radically inclined,
openly assert that the present control
of the federation is too conservative.
However, it is expected that Gompers
will be able to retain his power.
The executive council today urged
the two million members of the feder
ation to begin the formation of an in
ternational society for the prevention
of war.
The council resolved that the work
ing people of the world bore the bur
den of war, and that it would cease
when they refused to participate in in
ternational conflict; that the butchery
and waste were appalling and detri
mental to the race.
"War cannot be stopped by paper
resolutions," says the report. "The
masses must give their convictions re
ality by daring to do. Militarism and
competitive armament must be abol
ished. Tribunals for awarding justice
and agencies for enforcing determina
tions must be instituted."
