### 
Evan Williams, America's greatest
concert tenor, will sing at the Assem
bly Hall Saturday, November 21, in the
first of the concerts to be given this
season by the Peninsular Musical As
sociation.
Mr. Williams is a pioneer among the
singers who render the great songs of
Wagner and Handel, in English. The
courage of such an undertaking was
rewarded by the compliments of the
great interpreter, Anton
Seidl, who lias many times engaged
Williams to sing with orchestras he
has conducted. Heretofore Williams
has been hailed as "The great Welsh
tenor," when, as a matter of fact, he
was both born and educated in the
United States, and, although he takes
pride in his wholesome Welsh ances
tory, he is loyal to the land of his birth.
