# VARSITY PLOWS TO VICTORY IN WIND-UP MATCH WITH ALUMNI
## Individual Brilliancy Marks Last Practice Game of Season, But Lack of Efficient Team Work Disappoints the Cardinal Fans 36-6 IS THE FINAL SCORE 
### 
Stanford Varsity slashed through a
game of individual brilliancy Satur
day, and won from the Winged Olymp
ics 36-6 in the windup practice match
of the 1914 season. Across the bay,
Schaeffer's men hedged the Alumni
team inside a 27-3 score. Dopesters
are now engaged in fighting the Big
Game of November 14 on paper.
Lack of mutual support among the
Cardinal backs was a disappointment
to the bleachers. Erb, Lachmund and
Austin kept the yell leaders busy with
their trying and kicking proclivity.
Elsewhere in the backfield the men
failed to find themselves until the lat
ter part of both halves.
Stanford had a shade the best of the
argument in the forward division.
More than that cannot be said. In
the line-outs the visiting forwards
were clearly outclassed, and the backs
were given several chances to start,
which they allowed to be smothered on
account of slow formation.
The scrum held its ground on a fifty
fifty display of 'ongth. Captain Gard
and Wylie had to brace and heave with
a will to maintain the equilibrium of
heelers, but they succeeded. Dribbling
throughout the game was done in a hap
hazard way.
Lachmund achieved five of seven
tries; Austin and Burns each crossed
the Olympic line once; Erb dropped
across from the thirty-yard line on a
penalty kick; Austin booted along the
goal finding groove in six out of seven
attempts. Therein lies story of the
thirty-six points, so far as they may
be credited to individual play, and a
big part of the reason for Stanford's
walkaway.
Austin made the first speed ex
hibition by taking from the ground at.
forty, and dashing through the club
men's backs, passing to Wines on the
ten-yard mark, where the visitors
fouled. Erb dropped across the bar
easily.
Following Wylie's mark, Hardy, the
Olympic lock, secured from a line-out
and passed to Guerin. The fast break
away warmed the turf in a twenty-yard
run wh'ch landed him across the line.
Otto Lachmund began his series of
stellar flights when he received from
Erb at a twenty-yard scrum, and made
child's play of the defense in a beauti
ful dodging spring. Austin sent the
hall across the bar, making the score
8-3.
Deke Gard's snap pass on the thirty
five yard line was the meat for Lach
mund's second tally, after a flying
grab and sprint. Austin again nego
tiated a conversion.
The first display of open backfield
concert work started with Austin's
cross-kick from Stanford's thirty-five
yard line. Carroll received and passed
to Erb, after a dodging run. Lach
mund took Erb's pass and advanced
ten yards but was downed by J. Mont
gomery on the Olympics' fifteen-yard
mark.
Carroll and Urban returned the play
to close quarters after the opposing
forwards dribbled to ccnter field. Se
curing at the thirty-yard limit, Danny
shot the ball to Urban, who covers!
twenty yards before he was forced to
return the pass to Carroll. From the
resulting five-yard scrum. Erb got the
play out to Lachmund. who shot across
the line. Austin raised the record to
lS-:i by an accurate kick from a hard
angle.
As a scoring finale for the first
period, Frank Reeves cross-kicked to
Lachmund, who circled the field in a
Kain of twenty yards, and gave Austin
another chance to convert, leaving the
score 23-3.
Before the Cardinal backfield got its
bearings in the second half the Olympic
pack had an opportunity to show fight.
Dribbling progress back and forth
across the center line was even.
J. Montgomery finished the scor
ing of the visitors by placing a goal
kick from the thirty-five yard line, af
te.r Reeves was laid out of the game
two minutes with an injury to his
weak knee.
Just before being replaced by Swi
gart. at second five, Lachmund rolled,
over the line in his last contribution
to the day's scoring. Score 28-6.
Braden, Wines, and Austin caromed
down thirty-five yards of turf to a try
I by Austin, in the first sample of ef
fective combination work seen during
the afternoon. Austin converted.
With the sound of the last gun, Aus
tin broke into a thirty-yard run and
snapped to Carroll, who gave the ball
to Burns, subbing Urban, for the last
try and the most gratifying play seen.
Austin failed his first attempt at con
version.
The Second Varsity again proved its
right to respect Saturday by massing
twenty-one tallies while St. Mary's
team of hard-fighting .ruggers made a
single try.
In the Cardinal backfield the play
was tight as a bandbox. The pack had
its hand full at all stages of the match.
Templeton, Wynne, and West figured
in plays of resource and skill, which
kept the bleachers in a prolonged
thrill of expectancy. Bacon, Lane, and
Mayberry figured in numerous passing
gains which cut the turf in circles.
Templeton's unexpected drop-over,
when he came in striking distance at the
twenty-five yard line netted four
points, and placed the half-time score
at 9-0.
The Stanford All-Blacks, led by Til
ton, gave a Maori yell of New Zealand
fame before entering the second pe
! riod, and then followed up their pre
j tenfons with a display of class which
blanked the visitors.
Only once was a St. Mary's man let
through the backfield. Moy, first five,
got the ball after a line-out, and
passed to Prentice, who released to
Maroni. May failed to convert.
Templeton's short kicks across and
downfield in the pinches view for hon
ors with West's touch finding. "Ric"
put his second drop over the bar for
four points after receiving a free kick
on the thirty-five-yard line.
Good distribution of loose play un
derfoot and passing gratified the spec
tators.
