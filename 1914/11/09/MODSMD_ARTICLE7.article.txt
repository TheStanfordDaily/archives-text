# VARSITY PLOWS TO VICTORY IN WIND-UP MATCH WITH ALUMNI
## Individual Brilliancy Marks Last Practice Game of Season, But Lack of Efficient Team Work Disappoints the Cardinal Fans 36-6 IS THE FINAL SCORE 
### 
Stanford Varsity slashed through a
game of individual brilliancy Satur
day, and won from the Winged Olymp
ics 36-6 in the windup practice match
of the 1914 season. Across the bay,
Schaeffer's men hedged the Alumni
team inside a 27-3 score. Dopesters
are now engaged in fighting the Big
Game of November 14 on paper.
Lack of mutual support among the
Cardinal backs was a disappointment
to the bleachers. Erb, Lachmund and
Austin kept the yell leaders busy with
their trying and kicking proclivity.
Elsewhere in the backfield the men
failed to find themselves until the lat
ter part of both halves.
Stanford had a shade the best of the
argument in the forward division.
More than that cannot be said. In
the line-outs the visiting forwards
were clearly outclassed, and the backs
were given several chances to start,
which they allowed to be smothered on
account of slow formation.
The scrum held its ground on a fifty
fifty display of 'ongth. Captain Gard
and Wylie had to brace and heave with
a will to maintain the equilibrium of
heelers, but they succeeded. Dribbling
throughout the game was done in a hap
hazard way.
Lachmund achieved five of seven
tries; Austin and Burns each crossed
the Olympic line once; Erb dropped
across from the thirty-yard line on a
penalty kick; Austin booted along the
goal finding groove in six out of seven
attempts. Therein lies story of the
thirty-six points, so far as they may
be credited to individual play, and a
big part of the reason for Stanford's
walkaway.
Austin made the first speed ex
hibition by taking from the ground at.
forty, and dashing through the club
men's backs, passing to Wines on the
ten-yard mark, where the visitors
fouled. Erb dropped across the bar
easily.
Following Wylie's mark, Hardy, the
Olympic lock, secured from a line-out
and passed to Guerin. The fast break
away warmed the turf in a twenty-yard
run wh'ch landed him across the line.
Otto Lachmund began his series of
stellar flights when he received from
Erb at a twenty-yard scrum, and made
child's play of the defense in a beauti
ful dodging spring. Austin sent the
hall across the bar, making the score
8-3.
Deke Gard's snap pass on the thirty
five yard line was the meat for Lach
mund's second tally, after a flying
grab and sprint. Austin again nego
tiated a conversion.
The first display of open backfield
concert work started with Austin's
cross-kick from Stanford's thirty-five
yard line. Carroll received and passed
to Erb, after a dodging run. Lach
mund took Erb's pass and advanced
ten yards but was downed by J. Mont
gomery on the Olympics' fifteen-yard
mark.
Carroll and Urban returned the play
to close quarters after the opposing
forwards dribbled to ccnter field. Se
curing at the thirty-yard limit, Danny
shot the ball to Urban, who covers!
twenty yards before he was forced to
return the pass to Carroll. From the
resulting five-yard scrum. Erb got the
play out to Lachmund. who shot across
