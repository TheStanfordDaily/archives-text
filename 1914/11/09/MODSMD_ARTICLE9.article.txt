# NOVEMBER NUMBER OF SEQUOIA TO BE PUT ON SALE TOMORROW
## Football Articles Make Issue Timely as Big Game Numberâ€”Stories and Poems Appear. 
### 
The Stanford Sequoia for November
will be issued tomorrow morning. The
number is not only one that should
prove interesting to the Stanford pub
lic, but also one worthy of mailing
away with pride of its being produced
at Stanford. Football in general and
the Rig Game in particular are repre
sented by four articles. One of these
consists of a treatise by Walter Camp,
and an answer by Dr. Jordan.
One point of particular value in W.
P. Fuller's article, "For the Rugby
Fan," tells why a referee does not call
every infringement of the rules. Fuller
explains the "advantage rule" in de
tail.
H. W. Maloney. Stanford's trainer,
gives his sidelights of the season in
an article called "Rig Game Pros
pects." Among other things thnt Ma
loney points out., is the fact that before
the game starts Saturday, the score
should read "California 3; Stanford
0." He tells why. The other football
article, "Covering the Big Game," is
by E. D. Kneass, '18.
Stories by G. Robinson, '17, and H. S.
Vlarshutz, '17, and verse by Agnes
Gray, '15, and G. A. Hughes, '16, go to
put the number in the "mail-away"
class. The issue is tastefully arranged
and well decorated with cuts of pho
tographs and drawings.
