# Referee Byrne
## 
### 
In the naming of T. E. D. Byrne, of
Vancouver, to hold the all-deciding
whistle in the rugby contest on Satur
day, the graduate managers of the two
Universities have reached a decision
that will meet with the sincere approv
al of all football enthusiasts in this
community. Byrne refereed the game
of November 11, 1911, and his work
was pre-eminently satisfactoryâ€”mem
bers of the Senior class will remember
the white flanneled figure on the field
as one of the .redeeming features of
those disastrous eighty minutes.
To Referee Byrne should go the
satisfaction that is derived from the
knowledge of the confidence reposed in
him by the contestants and their some
times over-enthusiastic supporters. It
is our sincere hope that his post-game
statement will approximate that of W.
W. Hill, in 1913, when he said; "When
games are played in such excellent
spirit it is well for the future of rugby
and the great intercollegiate game."
