Editor "The Daily Palo Alto:"
The proposition now presents itself,
that a few of our dashing parlor ath
letes have operated, by the means of
puerile blandish subtle cajollery,
and a waste of much good time at
Sticky's Dyspepsia Palace, to influ
ence the affectionate co-eds and their
effeminate cohorts, distinguishable
from them only through difference in
dress, to agitate that tennis, mind you,
be made a major spo.rt!
When, in the good old days, several
of Stanford's Best severed, by
request, diplomatic relations with
this University, some seer proph
esied that Stanford would be
fore long, become a second-rate
Girl's High School, in which the most
arduous pastime would be chewing
gum and playing authors; that the
sacred "S" would oe given only to
those Phi Beta Kappas who were mem
bers in good standing of the First
Presbyterian church, and had played
at least three minutes in the annual
game of marbles with Mills College.
Alas, that anything so despicable
should ever come to pass, and yet
there are those who clamor for just
such a millenium. To them the honor
of an "S" should be desecrated by mak
ing it so common that it would be
granted automatically to everyone who
got over seventy-five in a geography
"exam." How could you stop it? If an
"S" is to be given fo.r sports on their
merits, tennis would not be first, it
would have to wait its turn for soc
cer, basketball, golf, and debating.
Neither could the Stanford Band be
discriminated against. Why not give
three or four "S's" to each and every
member of the band, which marches
so valiantly down to the game every
Saturday, plays three stone age dirges,
and afte.r receiving "twenty cheers for
the band," goes home elated before the
first half is over? After those dear
girls in the Foreign Missionary Socie
ty have all been decorated with an "S"
for saving some paranoic heathen in
China from dying with the dry rot,
then, and only then, should ten
nis come to her own.
Do not understand me to cast, asper
sion upon tennis as a sport, not at all.
T readily concede that tennis is an ad
mirable form of calesthenics for that
type of athlete, whose only exercise is
gained by changing his collar three
times a day, and holding hands with
some feeble-minded co-ed before the
curfew rings at niffht.

When Stanford comes to that pass,
in which she elects the handsomest
and most popular man in the class to
lead the Junior Prom, then perhaps
tennis might be substituted for the
big game, and be violent and rough
enough to thrill the most listless and
love sick spectator. Tradition has it,
that one great athlete broke his leg
while playing tennis, so perhaps, after
all, even this soothing diversion should
be well investigated by the Young Peo
ple's Christian Endeavor Society be
fore giving its official sanction to such
a dangerous pastime.
If Stanford is to continue as a Uni
versity of virile and manly men. and
not as a comfort station for milk sops
and monocled molly coddles, it is bet
ter not to drag into the mire of effemin
acy that laurel wreath of conquest,
the Stanford "S."
OLD HONEST JOHN, 1!)1G.
