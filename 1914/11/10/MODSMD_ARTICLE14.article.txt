contributed the poem reprinted today

Field is now editor of the Sunset Maga
zine:
I've heard in the noisy city
When the football game was done,
The Stanford cry, exultant,
While blood-red set the sun;
I've been in the dim Quadrangle
When the moonlit palms were still,
And listened to the college slogan
With an answering loyal thrill;
Tint I've heard today with a feeling
I find it hard to tell, —
Three little Faculty children
Giving the dear old yell.
Thin and high were their voices,
A childish treble sweet.
Lost, like a bird-song, barely
Four houses down the street.
Hardly a faint far echo
Of the mighty jubilee
When our Alma Mater wakened
To perpetuity.
And some would have smiled to hear
it;
But I stood as under a spell,—
Three little Faculty children
Giving the Stanford yell.
For I saw, in a noon-tide vision,
The future of things begun,
The acres of sandstone shining
In the Palo Alto sun,
And the towering Tree lifting up—
Tts Cardinal crown on high,
When we shall have passed and scat
tered, —
Traditions, at best, you and I, —
And these should inherit the triumph,
Tn the glorious days to dwell, —
Three little Faculty children,
Giving the dear old yell.
—Carolus Ager.
