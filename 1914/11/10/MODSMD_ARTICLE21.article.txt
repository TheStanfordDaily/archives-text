United Press Telegraphic Report
New York, NOV. 10. â€”With all the
vessels whistling a deep-throated fare
well the U. S. S. Jason steamed out to
day on its mission of gladness to the
million or more children whose fathers
have been killed in the European war.
Every nook and crevice in the hold of
the collier was filled with Christmas
presents, contributed by Americans
from all parts of this country.
