It was a local street car, in fact, an
exceedingly local car, that just the
other (lay loft the Bookstore laden to
the gunwales with a precious cargo of
commuters, Paly highbrows, and a
typically sleeply motorman and con
ductor.
At Encina something happened—
there entered what is listed in the
"Bawl-Out" as one Otto Gray Lach
niund, Pre L.29, Palo Alto. Whereup
on the car started, and at the same
time there started a murmur through
the aisles.
Said the girls: "Oh, there's 'Pret
ty!'" And they said it pretty loudly.
So "Pretty" pretty nearly blushed.
Said the ladies: "There's Mr. Lach
mund!"
Said the fellows " ' Lo, Lach, 'Lo,
Otto."
Lach said nothing; he was busy do
ing the blushing act.
To repeat, the car was crowded, so
"Pretty" grabbed a strap (are there
straps on the Paly cars?) and hung
on while the 12 H. P. electric swung
around curves and across switches at
the death-dealing pace of nine miles
per hour.
Whereupon the most unexpected
happened. There arose out of the
throng a most kindly woman. She was
"fussed" —that was plain.
"Oh, Mr. Lachmund," she said:
"Won't you take my seat? You have
to play today, and you look so tired."
Otto sat down —when he got home.
And to make a short story shorter, it's
best to say no more about it.
