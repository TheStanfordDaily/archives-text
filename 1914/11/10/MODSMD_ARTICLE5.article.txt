# SOCCER GAME PROMISES TO BE HARD STRUGGLE
## CALIFORNIA WILL SEND TEAM OF VETERANS ON FIELD. Cardinal Must Show Aggressive Play If String of Victories Remain Unbroken. 
### 
The primary intercollegiate battle
to christen the new turf at Berkeley
will be the first Stanford-California
soccer game'. The .rival colleges will
line-up their elevens on the morning of
the fourteenth, and a fast and close
contest is expected to set the pace for
the rugby battle of the afternoon.
Stanford will have to play above the
form shown to date if the string of
Cardinal soccer victories is to be kent
unbroken. The season's preliminary
games against the city clubs showed
the college aggregation to be hard
working and aggressive. -Comparative
sco.res do not necessarily give a key
to the results of the intercollegiate
match, but the early-season showing
points to a. decided advantage for the
Blue and Gold on the morning of the
fourteenth.
In the Cardinal ranks there appear
but four veterans of last year's victor
ious eleven. Captain Blodgett, ex-Cap
tain Higgins, Butcher, and Dutton, are
the only C'ircle-S men whose names
are contained in this year's eligible
list. The new men, with the exception
of Kyle and Vanderburk, who a.re new
to soccer at Stanford, found places last
year on the sidelines, and in the sec
ond string.
California's list of eligihles shows
six veterans of intercollegiate soccer,
and report has it that, among the new
men are three Canadians, who are sea
soned soccerites.
Cal'fornia has shown an added inter
est in soccer this year, and for the
first time the Blue and Cold squad has
the services of a paid coach to
strengthen its chances of breaking
into the chain of Stanford soccer vic
tories with a California win.
Since the introduction of soccer as
a minor snort, three years ago, four
Cardinal victories and three ties have
been chalked up on the score board.
All the odds, so far, are in favor of a
California victory this fall. If the Car
dinal eleven makes it an even break on
Sunday, they will have to show some
of the form they displayed in their
last match against the Celts, when,
with a ten-man team, they gave the ag
gressive club team their first defeat
of the season.
The eligible list follows:
Stanford —Higgins, S. Adams, .T.
Adams, Dutton, Ring, Whipple, Cass,
Vanderburg, Boyle, Day, R. Kistler,
Ketchum, Henderson, Shaw, Mead,
Kyle, Blodget, Butcher.
California — Shafer, Cook, Miller,
Wedemeyer, Snyder, Reinke, Harding,
Webster, Vandergrift, Rust, Moodey,
Kellas, Mackinlay, Mayer, Feliz, Bar
bera, Stewart, Rogers, LaShelle.
