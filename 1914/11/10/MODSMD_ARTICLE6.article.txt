# VANCOUVER MAN CHOSEN AS BIG GAME REFEREE
## Ted Byrne, Official of 1911 Intercollegiate, Named SELECTION IS UNEXPECTED Stanford All-Blacks Versus California Second Team Now Practically Assured For Thanksgiving 
### 
The problem of choosing a referee
for the Stanford-California intercolle
giate game was finally solved yester
day evening by G.raduate Managers
Wilcox and Stroud, after a successful
consultation at the St. Francis Hotel,
San Francisco. Ted Byrne, of Van
couver, who acted in the capacity <:f
Big Game official in 1911, was selected
to hold the whistle in Saturday's game.
The announcement comes as a com
plete surprise to the rugby dopesters,
who calculated that, one of the local
referees would lie in charge of the an
nual football classic. Byrne is a very
capable official, being absolutely inde
pendent, and not swayed by the popu
lar clamor to the slightest degree. He
is especially acceptable to Stanford,
as he enforces all the .rules very
strictly, though in not such a detailed
manner as Hill. Byrne received great
praise by the San Francisco sporting
editors three years ago for the excel
lent manner in which he handled a
difficult contest. The Vancouver ref
pree wired his acceptance to Managers
Wilcox and Stroud this morning. Im
mediately afte.r the game Saturday,
Byrne will leave for the front to join
his regiment, which will be sent to
France.
Two former Stanford and California
graduates were appointed as touch
judges. Palmer Fuller, '10, who is too
well-known on the Stanford campus
to require an introduction, will act as
one linesman, while George Bell. '09,
former Blue and Gold Varsity baseball
player, will hold the flags on the oppo
site side of the field. Dave Brown,
97, Cardinal track captain in his senior
year, and later graduate manager, lias
been secured as timer.

That Stanford's All-Blacks will play
the Blue and Gold Second Varsity in
thp first intercollegiate match of its
kind in the rival universities' football
liisto.ry is now practically assured, ac
cording to Graduate Managers Wilcox
and Stroud. The student bodies of
both institutions have already ex
pressed their approval of such an in
novation.
November 2f>, Thanksgiving Day,
will doubtless be assigned as a date
for the contest between the second
string players if it will not conflict
with the Winged "0"-Los Angeles Ath
letic Club game. It is as yet undecid
ed on what field the match will be
staged, but in all probability the Berk
eley Turf will be the scene of the con
test. All men who do not plav in the
Big Game next Saturday, including the
substitutes, not used, are eligible for
the team. No action has been taken
as yet. on what kind of sweaters will
be granted the All-Blacks, but the
choice must necessarily fall between
the Ge.rman or Circle "S."
Light practice was indulged in by
the members of the Varsity squad yes
terday afternoon. Under the direction
of Captain Gard, the first and second
team forwards, with their substitutes,
were put through numerous scrums,
line-outs and dribbling rushes. Coach
Brown gave the backs a good work
out in passing and cross-kicking at
tacks through an Imaginary bacfield.

nual football classic. Byrne is a very
capable official, being absolutely inde
pendent, and not swayed by the popu
lar clamor to the slightest degree. He
is especially acceptable to Stanford,
as he enforces all the .rules very
strictly, though in not such a detailed
manner as Hill. Byrne received great
praise by the San Francisco sporting
editors three years ago for the excel
lent manner in which he handled a
difficult contest. The Vancouver ref
pree wired his acceptance to Managers
Wilcox and Stroud this morning. Im
mediately afte.r the game Saturday,
Byrne will leave for the front to join
his regiment, which will be sent to
France.
Two former Stanford and California
graduates were appointed as touch
judges. Palmer Fuller, '10, who is too
well-known on the Stanford campus
to require an introduction, will act as
one linesman, while George Bell. '09,
former Blue and Gold Varsity baseball
player, will hold the flags on the oppo
site side of the field. Dave Brown,
97, Cardinal track captain in his senior
year, and later graduate manager, lias
been secured as timer.

That Stanford's All-Blacks will play
the Blue and Gold Second Varsity in
thp first intercollegiate match of its
kind in the rival universities' football
liisto.ry is now practically assured, ac
cording to Graduate Managers Wilcox
and Stroud. The student bodies of
both institutions have already ex
pressed their approval of such an in
novation.
November 2f>, Thanksgiving Day,
will doubtless be assigned as a date
for the contest between the second
string players if it will not conflict
with the Winged "0"-Los Angeles Ath
letic Club game. It is as yet undecid
ed on what field the match will be
staged, but in all probability the Berk
eley Turf will be the scene of the con
test. All men who do not plav in the
Big Game next Saturday, including the
substitutes, not used, are eligible for
the team. No action has been taken
as yet. on what kind of sweaters will
be granted the All-Blacks, but the
choice must necessarily fall between
the Ge.rman or Circle "S."
Light practice was indulged in by
the members of the Varsity squad yes
terday afternoon. Under the direction
of Captain Gard, the first and second
team forwards, with their substitutes,
were put through numerous scrums,
line-outs and dribbling rushes. Coach
Brown gave the backs a good work
out in passing and cross-kicking at
tacks through an Imaginary bacfield.
The problem of choosing a referee
for the Stanford-California intercolle
giate game was finally solved yester
day evening by G.raduate Managers
Wilcox and Stroud, after a successful
consultation at the St. Francis Hotel,
San Francisco. Ted Byrne, of Van
couver, who acted in the capacity <:f
Big Game official in 1911, was selected
to hold the whistle in Saturday's game.
The announcement comes as a com
plete surprise to the rugby dopesters,
who calculated that, one of the local
referees would lie in charge of the an
nual football classic. Byrne is a very
capable official, being absolutely inde
pendent, and not swayed by the popu
