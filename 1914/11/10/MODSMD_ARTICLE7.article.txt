### 
The members of the Press Club of
San Francisco will act as hosts at a
Stanford high-jinks and rally in the
club rooms at Sutter and Powell
streets next Friday evening, inviting
all Stanford faculty members, under
graduates and alumni to participate in
a jolly reunion on the eve of the "Big

A feature of the program will be a
short talk by W. Palmer Fuller, '10, in

merits of the Stanford and California
teams, as one of the few men competent

ing of the two teams, Fuller will brief
ly criticize the play of each fifteen,
besides discussing the merits and
weaknesses of the individual ruggers.
He will also state candidly and frankly
his opinion regarding the outcome of
1014's rugby classic.
W. R. Davenport, ex-'O2, the well
known cartoonist, has planned a stunt,
the exact nature of which has not been
.revealed to the entertainment commit
tee. Those familiar with Davenport's
work rather expect that he will execute
a few rapid-fire sketches, depicting
scenes of the coming battle, as con
ceived by himself.
Ram's Head will provide a portion of
the entertainment, introducing several
of their talented members in two live
ly skits. .T. P. Morgan, '10, alias Sen
orita Ysabel Adagal; R H. Lasky, '12,
late ambassador to Mexico," and W. G.
Paul, '15, will present a humorous
sketch called "Afte.r the Game Is
Over," in which they will introduce
two snappy new song numbers. RM.
Melvin, '17, will display his personality
in several rag-time ballads.
Concluding the program prominent
alumni will tell "how it was done be
fore," describing former Cardinal vic
tories.
Besides an entertainment committee,
there is one on refreshments —employ-
ing a rich past experience to help
make the .rally a successful one.
Offering, as it does, an opportunity
for new and old Stanford men to
mingle together on the night of all
nights that the Cardinal spirit is ram
pant. the annual Press Club jolly-up is
a, very momentous event, and the Press
Club urges all Stanford men to attend.

The members of the Press Club of
San Francisco will act as hosts at a
Stanford high-jinks and rally in the
club rooms at Sutter and Powell
streets next Friday evening, inviting
all Stanford faculty members, under
graduates and alumni to participate in
a jolly reunion on the eve of the "Big
Game."
Part of the "get-together" entertain
ment will consist of an informal pro
gram, in which former and present
Stanford men will appear, depicting
various aspects of the next day's great
rugby clash on California Field.
A feature of the program will be a
short talk by W. Palmer Fuller, '10, in
which he will review this year's rugby
season to date, comparing the relative
merits of the Stanford and California
teams, as one of the few men competent
to judge impartially the seasonal show
ing of the two teams, Fuller will brief
ly criticize the play of each fifteen,
besides discussing the merits and
weaknesses of the individual ruggers.
He will also state candidly and frankly
his opinion regarding the outcome of
1014's rugby classic.
W. R. Davenport, ex-'O2, the well
known cartoonist, has planned a stunt,
the exact nature of which has not been
.revealed to the entertainment commit
tee. Those familiar with Davenport's
work rather expect that he will execute
a few rapid-fire sketches, depicting
scenes of the coming battle, as con
ceived by himself.
Ram's Head will provide a portion of
the entertainment, introducing several
of their talented members in two live
ly skits. .T. P. Morgan, '10, alias Sen
orita Ysabel Adagal; R H. Lasky, '12,
