# RUGBY EXPERT BALANCES SHADES OF TEAM WORK IN OPPOSING VARSITIES
## Reverend Mullineux, of Seamen's Institute, Forecasts Turf Classic Between Powerful Rivals. 
### 
Reverend M. Mullineux, chaplain of
the Seamen's Institute in San Fran
cisco, .rugby enthusiast, and referee of
repute, has written the following spe
cial prospect story of the intercollegi
ate match for The Daily Palo Alto:
By Reverend M. Mullineux.
The week of the Big Game has ar
rived. The Cardinal and the Blue ami
Gold warriors are through their stren
uous training. War and the elections
are no longer the absorbing topics of
conversation. Generals .Toffre and
Kluk take a back seat this week; Cap
tains McKim and C.ard occupy the
limelight fo.r a season. The battle of
the Aisne pales into insignificance be
fore the strenuous fight that will take
place on Saturday.
Who will win, and by how much?
Can the Cardinal forwards hold the
California pack, and thus enable their
backs to get into action? Ts the Cali-
t'ornia defence strong enough for the
Cardinal scoring machine? These and
a thousand and one other questions
are on the lips of all football fans.
Three weeks ago these questions could
have been answered in a definite man
ner. There is no doubt that Stanford
had the better team.
The same remarks cannot be made
! today. Coach Schaeffer has made a
vast improvement in his team during
the past three weeks —an improve
ment always visible when the players
are extending themselves. There is
much more cohesion in the scrum —
there is a life and dash in the for
wards that the Cardinal pack has not
often exhibited —whilst the discovery
of Brooks has introduced into the Cal
ifornia three-quarter line a really dan
gerous scoring factor. Who then will
win?
The question is not an easy one to
answer. On paper the game is Stan
fords. The same may be said if we
take the result of the trial matches.
The Cardinals seem to have the scor
ing machine. We cannot, however, get
a very accurate estimate from these
games. The opposition was too weak
in most cases. The Santa Clara
matches form the only criterion, and
even this cannot count for much. The
showing was all in favor of Califor
nia, but those who saw both games
declare that whilst the Mission boys
at Stanford were full of vim and pep,
at Berkeley they were lifeless.
Players Are Compared.
We must, therefore, fo.rm our esti
mate from the line-ups, weighing up
the strength of the various positions
and always remembering the fact that

every player gives a little mare than
his best in the Bis Game. The full
backs are almost on a par. Bogardtis
has a fine kick—accurate and long—his
kicking into touch last Saturday was
of the highest order. Andrews S s
equally good, and can be relied on
more when in a tight corner. There
is no marked superiority in the wing
three-quarters. Joe Urban is, per
haps, the most dangerous of the four.
The "rubber-steel" man wants an aw
ful lot of stopping. Erb's experience
at half may stand him in good stead,
but there is little to choose between
the guardians of the scrum. The scor
ing strength of the Cardinals undoubt
edly lies in the center and the fives.
The speed of Lachmund and Carroll,
and the marvellous swerving of Aus
tin will mean victory fo.r Stanford,
unless the California defence is su
perb, assuming chances come their
way. Gianelli, Canfield, and Brooks
lack the finish of the Cardinal trio, but
they are worthy opponents.
Packs \re Deciding Factor.
The forwards will practically decide
the game. Both packs have one pre
eminent star. The California captain
is an exceedingly clever, resourceful,
and hard-working player. He is a
dangerous scorer, and misses nothing
that comes his way. Wylie, the Car
dinal star, is a forward of a different
type. He is equally resourceful, and,
when near the line, is the most dan
gerous scorer that ever donned a jer
sey. One man, however, cannot make
a pack, and the fortunes of the day
will depend on the way the forwards
work as a body. Tf the Stanford for
wards can .vise to the occasion, as they
did a year ago, and play to their backs,
a 15-point victory should be theirs. Tf,
on the other hand, the Blue and Gold
control the scrum, the result will be
uncertain till the end, and nothing
more than a fi-point margin will sep
arate the two teams. Since the visit
of the Waratahs, rugby football has
improved 25%, and whether Stanford
or California dominate the scrum, we
shall see one of the finest contests ev
er staged between the two great uni
versities.
