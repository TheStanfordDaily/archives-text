# SOCCER LINE-UP NAMED
## INTERCOLLEGIATE SERIES STARTS SATURDAY Match to Commence at 9:45 on California Turf—Team Will Include But Four Veterans, But Should Play Strong Game 
### 
Eleven men have been named by
Trainer H. W. Maloney, Captain W. B.
Blodgett, '10, and ex-Captain A. W.
Higgins, '13, to lineup against Califor
nia on the soccer field next Saturday
morning.
This match will be the first of the
annual series of three games against
California, which decides intercolle
giate soccer supremacy.
The only veterans in the forward
line are Captain Blodgett and ex-Cap
tain Higgins, who are slated for cen
ter and inside right. Blodgett, a play
er of two years' intercollegiate experi
ence, has left his former position at
full to bear the brunt of the attack at
center forward. Higgins, who will
represent Stanford for the fourth year
against California, can be counted on
for cool, heady work in the forward
line. He has a sure boot and his shots
for the net should give the California
goalkeeper some anxious moments.
Shaw, Kyle, and S. Adams fill out
the forward rank. Shaw is sufficient
ly recovered f.rom the injury sustained
in the last Celtic game to resume his
regular position at outside right. S.
Adams, who makes his initial appear
ance this fall on a Cardinal soccer
team has been doing clever and con
sistent work at inside left. Kyle, the
Freshman wing, is a speedy, aggres
sive player, whose tactics border on
the brilliant.
Saturday's half backs will be Cass,
Vande.rburg and Boyle. Cass is the
only circle "S" man in the division and
he will hold down his last year's berth
at left half. Boyle and Vanderburg, at
center and right, will prove strong nn
the defense.
The veteran Button is moved from
his old position at half to take a place
as right fullback. He can be counted
on there for safe offensive and defen
sive work. The berth at left full will
be held down by J. Adams, who was
on the sidelines for the last intercolle
giate match.
in place of the three-years' veteran
goal-keeper, Hutclier, the net will be
guarded by Ring. He has been used
steadily this season at the last de
fense, and should prove equal to the
emergencies of an intercollegiate
game.
The relief men named for Saturday's
contest are Tt. Kistler, Henderson, and
Day. Henderson will be ready to sub
stitute on the forward line. Day can
be played at half or full, and Kistler is
in line fo,r substituting at halfback.
The game will be staged at 9:45 on
the morning of November 14th, on the
California turf.
The line-up of both teams follows:
