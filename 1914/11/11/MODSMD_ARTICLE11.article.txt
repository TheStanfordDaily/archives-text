# SAN JOSE SPORTING EDITOR PREDICTS A STANFORD VICTORY
## M.F. Summis Says Cardinal Players Will Win Game By Small Margin. 
### 
By Milton F. Samis, Spotting Editor
San Jose Mercury-Herald.
It is the time-honored custom and
special privilege of football experts '.o
declare solemnly each year that the
approaching contest will far o'er
shadow its predecessors. A forecast
of a "big game" without this statement,
would be sadly deficient.
It is with this knowledge, therefore,
that we venture the prediction that
tlie Stanford-California game on No
vember 14 will outrival, in point of at
tendance and interest, any that have
ever been played on the coast since
athletic relations were established be
tween the two great universities.
Who will win? Right now the ques
t'on depends fin whether you are par
tial to the Cardinal, or whether your
favorite neckwear is Blue and Gold.
On November 14 it will depend on
who scores the most points.
I believe Stanford will win. It will
be hard-fought—every big game is
hard-fought, and, unless the unforseen
occurs, neither team should score
more than three tries. Two months
ago it looked like a. Stanford walk
over, but recent developments have
changed the situation. The abrogation
of the Freshman rule at California,
and the remarkable showing that the
Blue and Gold made against Santa
Clara have stemmed the tide of public
opinion, until the state institution is
now accorded a good chance of victory.
Rut the games which Santa Clara
played with Stanford and California
can hardly be taken as a basis for
comparison. The Catholic team was
trained to tlie minute for Stanford, this
being regarded by the Mission boys as
their big game, and naturally they
fought harder than in any game before
nr since. Stanford won 13 to 0.
A week later they went up against
California, anil were beaten 25 to 0.
This was taken by many as an indica
tion of California's superiority. Any
one who saw both games will agree
that Santa Clara had lost the edge
which it had against Stanford, and the
defense which it showed on the Car
dinal turf was lacking.
A brief resume of the preliminary
games has developed the following
features:
That Stanford has the best backfleld
ever developed on the Pacific coast.
That California's forwards will hoi 1
the edge over their Cardinal rivals.
That Stanford has a scoring team,
while California must rely largely on
its forwards for long gains.
That Charley Austin is the best all
around rugby player ever developed o i
the coast.
That not more than ten points, prob
ably much less, will separate the teams
at the close of the game.
That Stanford, on the form shown
this season, will win!

special privilege of football experts '.o
declare solemnly each year that the
approaching contest will far o'er
shadow its predecessors. A forecast
of a "big game" without this statement,
would be sadly deficient.
It is with this knowledge, therefore,
that we venture the prediction that
tlie Stanford-California game on No
vember 14 will outrival, in point of at
tendance and interest, any that have
ever been played on the coast since
athletic relations were established be
tween the two great universities.
Who will win? Right now the ques
t'on depends fin whether you are par
tial to the Cardinal, or whether your
favorite neckwear is Blue and Gold.
On November 14 it will depend on
who scores the most points.
I believe Stanford will win. It will
be hard-fought—every big game is
hard-fought, and, unless the unforseen
occurs, neither team should score
more than three tries. Two months
ago it looked like a. Stanford walk
over, but recent developments have
changed the situation. The abrogation
of the Freshman rule at California,
and the remarkable showing that the
Blue and Gold made against Santa
Clara have stemmed the tide of public
opinion, until the state institution is
now accorded a good chance of victory.
Rut the games which Santa Clara
played with Stanford and California
can hardly be taken as a basis for
comparison. The Catholic team was
trained to tlie minute for Stanford, this
being regarded by the Mission boys as
their big game, and naturally they
fought harder than in any game before
nr since. Stanford won 13 to 0.
A week later they went up against
California, anil were beaten 25 to 0.
This was taken by many as an indica
tion of California's superiority. Any
one who saw both games will agree
that Santa Clara had lost the edge
which it had against Stanford, and the
defense which it showed on the Car
dinal turf was lacking.
A brief resume of the preliminary
games has developed the following
features:
That Stanford has the best backfleld
ever developed on the Pacific coast.
That California's forwards will hoi 1
the edge over their Cardinal rivals.
That Stanford has a scoring team,
while California must rely largely on
its forwards for long gains.
That Charley Austin is the best all
around rugby player ever developed o i
the coast.
That not more than ten points, prob
ably much less, will separate the teams
at the close of the game.
That Stanford, on the form shown
this season, will win!
