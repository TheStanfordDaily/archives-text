Even in the glamour of the Varsity's
announcement, the merit of a large
group of Stanford rugby players will
be in the minds of the Cardinal root
ers—the excellence of the"All-Blacks."
While their portion is not the salvo
of enthusiastic cheering that greets the
red and white-suited players, the as
surance of the match with the Cali
fornia Seconds will open the path to
the goal of intercollegiate competition
—in participation there is recognition
of worth.
Men who are disappointed in the list
tomorrow will have the one solace —the
joy of opposing Blue and Gold is not to
be denied them for the year. The ex
traordinary game for the benefit of
starving Belgians is the open-sesame
to the realm of public appreciation.
There are more than fifteen men in
each university who play the English
game, and play it well!
