There is a lasting tribute to the per
severance and the deep-rooted spirit
of the wearers of the small gray cap
in the very bulk and symmetry of that
short-lived pyre on the soccer field.
Its fate is to be the signal torch of the
Cardinals' gathering in pledge of their
faith in team and coach, and the slow
work of weeks is to blaze red for a
wild rally that is measured in minutes.
Yet the men of the latest class at
Stanford have cut their numerals in
the records of the University's resolute
workers, and the mark is fireproof.
Credit to those to whom credit is due!
