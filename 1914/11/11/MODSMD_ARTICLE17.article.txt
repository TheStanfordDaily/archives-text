# Vive '18
## 
### 
A Stanford writer of verse has
struck the string of the muse's lyre,
and found the subject for a tribute to
wearers of the gray caps:
Men of the bonfire,
Sturdy and true,
Hats off to you!
Guarding our honor and glory,
The long night through;
Whiling with song and with story,
As soldiers do,
The cold, dark sentinel hours,
When threatened danger lowers.
And in the day,
With jest and play,
Building the pile up higher.
Never shall fire
Lit by hand,
Leap up this pyre
'Till all be planned.
Six! for the grap-capped band!
â€”A. K. G.
