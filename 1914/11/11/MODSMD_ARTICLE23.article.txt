### 
Philadelphia, Nov. 11. â€”It was pre
dicted today that the old agitation for
the formation of a Labor Party in
American politics would be raised be
fore the close of the present conven
tion of the American Federation of
Labor. The movement has little chance
of winning at this time, but many of
the leaders believe that such a party
is assured in the near future.
