Dear Editor:—l believe you will
welcome this commutation, as I know
they are excellent space fillers. Now,
there is quite an agitation perturbing
the tranquility of our communicipali
ty due to the insistence of our racquet
wielders that their pastime be made a
major sport. I am not quite as in
sistent as these other athletes, the
racket-raisers. lam a chess player, r
have played chess since early child
hood, and know the game from A to Z
and back again. Now T contend that
chess should lie a major sport, for the
same reason that the tennis entliusers
cry for promotion. Chess takes longer
to play than tennis, or football or cro
quet. Chess takes training. T repeat,
—T have trained since babyhood. Chess
players meet California in a gruelling
contest, and what do they get for it?
Victory or defeat, —no more. Now, Mr.
Editor, are they not more deserving
than that? If you have any sense <jf
feeling, any idea of sympathy, any ink
ling of what is right and wrong, you
will know I am right.
