John O. Miller, 'OS, makes the fol
lowing statement regarding Saturday's
contest:
The game seems to balance on the
respective scoring abilities of a "non
star" backfield with excellent combina
tion and one of "all-star" formation
with less perfect teamwork, but which
never fails to take advantage of any
opportunity.
California has a more aggressive
scrum formation, but Stanford's men
are more finished in open play, and
should be sufficently diverting to Cali
fornia's backfield to allow Stanford's
"Cyclone" and other "Tornadoes" ir.
outscore them.
