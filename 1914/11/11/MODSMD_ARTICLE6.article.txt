# PRACTICE SEASON CLOSES
## VARSITIES PUT THROUGH BRISK WORKOUT Coaches Brown and Schaeffer Will Name Teams Tomorrow. Canfield's Injured Ankle Is Worry on Berkeley Campus 
### 
Today marks the close of the pre
liminary season for both the Cardinal
anil the Blue and Gold Varsities. Tomor
row the official personnel of the two
teams will be announced by their re
spective coaches. Rallies in the even
ing will give the fifteens their final
send-oft" by the rooters previous to tn<j
big day, November 14.
Light practice has been the order of
the day throughout the week at both
rugby camps. Yesterday's workout on
the local turf brought about the best
play that the Varsity has exhibited for
some time. The backs, under the di
rection of Danny Carroll, showed a
surprising burst of speed and energy.
Coach Brown put the pack through a
stiff practice without opposition, which
proved them to be in fine fettle. Ac
cording to Trainer Maloney every rug
ger who may be used in the intercolle
giate match is in the pink of condition.
Followers of California's chances for
victory are somewhat worried over the
condition of two of their backfield
stars. Canfield and Gianelli. The
The former, who has been suffering
from a broken ligament in his ankle,
has caused much duulk in the minds of
his fellow students as to whether he
will be able to fill his position of sec
ond five Saturday. His loss would be
keenly felt by the Blue and Gold fif
teen. Gianelli contracted a strained
side in the Alumni game, which does
not permit him to play up to his usual
good form. In case Canfield will
be unable to fill his place in the Big
Game, Sharp, the speedy wing-three
quarter substitute will probably take
second five, with Hazeltine a possibili
ty. Canfield was not permitted to don
a suit in yesterday's practice, which
was in the nature of a secret work
out.
The Stanford Varsity will be an
nounced tomorrow afternoon on the
field between halves of the San Mateo
-I'alo Alto high school game for the
championship of the sub-league. Yell
Leader Nixon will read off the list of
the players winning places on the
team, following which the Varsity will
trot out onto the field for a brief light
practice. The California Varsity will
lie made known by Coach Jimmie
Scliaeffer tomorrow evening at the ral
ly which will take place in Harmon
Gymnasium. All the rooters are asked
to take their places in the bleachers
tomorrow afternoon, as a song and yell
practice will be held under the direc
tion of the yell leaders.
