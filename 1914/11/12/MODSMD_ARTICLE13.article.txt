# CALIFORNIA TEAM PROVES STRONGER ON DEFENSE
## Season's Figures Show Stanford Excels in Offensive Tacticsâ€”Comparative Scores Belie Truth. 
### 
Some interesting conclusions may be
drawn from the comparisons of scores
rolled up by the Cardinal and Blue and
Gold Varsities in their preliminary
games of the season. Stanford com
peted in nine contests with outside com
petition, and in all scored 261 points.
Visiting teams have managed to ann'?x
35 tallies in all. An average score for
the Varsity would, by compilation of
figures, amount to 29 to 3 8-9 points
per game.
California, on the other hand, com
mencing her season's play a week ear
lier, and being granted more competi
tion, contested in thirteen practice
matches. The Berkeley ruggers piled
up 230 points on their adversaries,
while their opponents secured 31 tal
lies. An average game's score de
duced from these statistics for the
Blue and Gold fifteen would thereby
be 17 9-13 points to 2 5-13.
The only answer that can be drawn
from the above figures, since compari
sons of individual game scores belie
the truth, is that California is superior
on the defense, while Stanford excells
on the offensive. Members of the fa
mous New Zealand All-Blacks team
that toured the coast last fall have
often been quoted as stating that at
tack is the best form of defense In rug
by. The force of their argument will
!be proved next Saturday. The follow
j ing is a summary of the results on the
schedules of both fifteens:

Some interesting conclusions may be
drawn from the comparisons of scores
rolled up by the Cardinal and Blue and
Gold Varsities in their preliminary
games of the season. Stanford com
peted in nine contests with outside com
petition, and in all scored 261 points.
Visiting teams have managed to ann'?x
35 tallies in all. An average score for
the Varsity would, by compilation of
figures, amount to 29 to 3 8-9 points
per game.
California, on the other hand, com
mencing her season's play a week ear
lier, and being granted more competi
tion, contested in thirteen practice
matches. The Berkeley ruggers piled
up 230 points on their adversaries,
while their opponents secured 31 tal
lies. An average game's score de
duced from these statistics for the
Blue and Gold fifteen would thereby
be 17 9-13 points to 2 5-13.
The only answer that can be drawn
from the above figures, since compari
sons of individual game scores belie
the truth, is that California is superior
on the defense, while Stanford excells
on the offensive. Members of the fa
mous New Zealand All-Blacks team
that toured the coast last fall have
often been quoted as stating that at
tack is the best form of defense In rug
by. The force of their argument will
!be proved next Saturday. The follow
j ing is a summary of the results on the
schedules of both fifteens:
