# SEASON'S SERVICES GIVE CARDINAL LEADERS CONFIDENCE IN THE SQUAD
## 
### 
Captain l)i'ke (Jard.
I have perfect confidence in the
ability and condition of every man

on the team.
The great
majority of
the players,
who will wear
the Cardinal
Saturday,
have been
through fire
in for me r
Big Games
and may be
counted upon
to fight all
the way. A
real battle is
expected by

I the Varsity, but yet I think we may
j claim a slight edge. Anything that
I tiie team accomplishes, may be credited
I in great measure to the untiring ef
forts of Coach Brown and Trainer Ma
loney, who have sacrificed to the men
the very best that is in them.
Coach Floyd Itroun.
The Stanford Varsity is not over
confident, nor have praising critics

overestimat
ed its abil
ity. There
is no ques
tion, how
ever, but
that the
C a 1 i fornia
tea m lias
been under
e s t i mated.
We are go
ing up
against the
hardest kind
of a fight,
and we rea
lize the task

that lies before us.

This year we have had a wealth of
splendid material to pick the fifteen
f.rcm, and the competition for posi
tions has been close. I believe that
our forwards will break even with the
hard fighting Mine and Gold pack, and
our hookers will show up even with
those of Berkeley. Saturday's game
will in all probability be won by the
work of the Stanford backfield. Due
to the untiring efforts of Trainer Ma
loney every member of the team is in
perfect condition for a hard game.

We are. so to speak, on the last lap,
