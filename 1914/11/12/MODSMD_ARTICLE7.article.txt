# Loyalty
## 
### 
Loyalty is not measured in noise
alone; there are more ways of getting
behind the team than are included 'a
the repertoire of the yell leaders. This
afternoon the rugby fans and arden;
Cardinal supporters gave vociferous
proof of their confidence in the peer
less fifteen named by Coach Brown,
and on Saturday a thousand rooters
will punctuate every flash of rugby
skill with the good old Stanford yells.
There will be noise, encouragement
aplenty. Straining the throat for the
team is good for the heart and lungs.
But the other marks of loyalty to
the team—what of them? Thinking of
their need for quiet, the racket and
riot of the rally tonight will be quickly
stilled after the beams of the bonfire
are 110 more than glowing embers.
Tomorrow we pledge our loyalty in
silence, and Saturday's course of ac
tion is predetermined—excepting minor
details depending on the final reading
of the score board. There comes
the rub —is loyalty to the team an ex
pression of deep felt loyalty to our
University, or is it only an excuse for
selfish excesses? There is 110 hesita
tion in the answer of the Stanford gen
tleman—pride in and respect for the
University is paramount to every oth
er consideration.
The Alma Mater is included in self —
each man-made law holds or fails as
judged by the standard of self-respect.
