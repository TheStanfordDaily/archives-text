# AVALANCHE IN BACKFIELD IS STANFORD SECURITY DESPITE RIVALS PACK
## 
### Paul Staniford 
The intercollegiate game cannot be
fought on paper. Those of us who
have followed the squad through the
preliminary season think we know
pretty well how the Stanford men will
handle themselves on the field. Con
cerning the boys on the other side of
the May wc have to take a lot for
granted. The story told by compara
tive scores with common opponents is
a fickle one, and the dope gleaned from
a few visits within the enemy's lines
may or may not have shown a fair
sample of merit.
Deke Gard and the fourteen men who
follow him into action are backed to
win by the Cardinal fans, both honest
ly and loyally. Victory hinges on the
same conditions which applied last
year. The pivot of Stanford scoring
machinery is the backfield; in order to
give the backs their chance, our for
wards must be nearly as good as those
led by "Chalk" McKim.
Fortunately the Cardinal pack does
not have to outclass the opposition. If
it did the game might as well be salted
and stored in the belfry of the Cam
panile before hand. We are obliged
to bow to Sehaeffer's three-two-three,
Freshmen and all. No forward exhibi
tion on Stanford Field this season has
equaled the one California set loose
against Santa Clara two weeks ago.
Grant Berkeley an edge in the scrum,
and in loose dribbling. Weight, height,
and speed give Stanford more than a
hair-line advantage in the line-outs.
With half a chance, the backfield
will cut. the turf in strips. They will
have better than half a chance, and
Erb, Austin. Lachmnnd, Ca.rroll,
Reeves, ITrban, and Andrews will whip
the ball into the air. A passing game j
in the backfield can beat a kicking

game, which is the Blue and Gold' 3
particular hobby.
The Stanford backs throughout the
season have shown a sublime willing
ness to share honors, which dispels the
bugaboo that a collection of individu
al stars would lose the game because
the runner would allow himself to be
smeared without passing. The recent
slump in the Varsity, which threw
the burden of the play on individuals,
is not a facto.r. That same slump is
as regular a visitor as an 8:15, and
passes as surely.
With all their pride in the backfield,
and in Captain Gard, and .Tim Wvlie,
few of the most rabid fireside athletes
expect a whitewash or a walkaway.
Such things don't, happen on the Big
Game schedule. The Stanford score
looks nearly twice the size of that of
1913. in prospect. California will
cross the Stanford line not once, but
several times. Her forwards will beat
down the field to striking distance,
and either Canfiekl or Gianelli or
Montgomery is good at finding a ho'.e
from the close scrums.
Stanford's passing rushes of long
range and individual brilliance will
win. The backfield men can solve
the puzzle of the California defense.
Austin and Lachmund will cross the
line if they lay hands on the ball with
in twenty yards. The entire backfield
will display beautiful concert work,
and will tangle California's wonderful
defense, Erb can come near to wheel
ing his scrum into a fifty-fifty show
of strength. Stanford will win, not
easily, but will win.
