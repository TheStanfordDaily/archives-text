# The 						Far-Off Rally

### 
An anonymous writer modestly con
tributes this poem, which is very ap
propriate at this time:
At the far corner of the campus it
started,
With a meager hooray and a yell.
And then came the putt putt of a
pistol shot,
And the clang of a brass cow bell.
Like a downward rolling snow ball
It grew in power and size,
Until the enthusiasm overflowing,
Burst into continuous cries.
To the training quarters a legion
marched.
Reinforced as it went on its way,
And the boom boom of a big base
drum
Was drowned by the loud hurray.
Then silence, but just for a second,
For a skyrocket shot to the sky;
The whistle, the bang, were perfectly
timed,
And seemed like a single cry.
Then cheers were loud, and long, and
loud,
Then came a strong "New Spell."
T wanted to be up and going
When I heard those fellows yell.
Then silence —the coach was talking,
And through the still Fall night,
Came the spirit of what he was say
ing,—
Said, "To win we've got to fight."
A sky .rocket, then six, and three,
Like a thousand dogs at bay,—
A rally's thrills are powerful thrills,
Even half a mile away.
Then silence, and a final cheer,
That said. "We cannot fail."
"We WILL not!" came the echo of
"Hail. Stanford, Hail."
