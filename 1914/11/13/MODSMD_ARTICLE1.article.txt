# RIVAL SOCCER TEAMS WILL CHRISTEN TURF OF BLUE AND GOLD
## 
### 
Only Four Veterans Represent
Cardinal in First Match of
Annual Series, But Backfield
Will Put Up Strong Defense
CALIFORNIA ELEVEN SKILLED
California turf will be christened
by its first intercollegiate struggle on
Saturday morning when the Cardinal
and Blue and Gold soccer elevens will
line up in the first of their annual
series of three matches. The game
promises to be close, but the dope
sters are inclined to give California
the edge for the first time since the
establishment of soccer as a minor
sport.
Stanford will send a team on the
field with but four veterans in the
ranks. Captain Blodget, ex-captain
Higgins, Dutton and Cass have won
their circlets against California and
will be the mainstay of Cardinal
hopes. The remainder of the team is
made up of men who have had no in
tercollegiate experience. Kyle, a
Freshman who has been showing up
well this fall, should prove a menace
to the Blue and Gold defense. Shaw
and S. Adams will show as clover and
steady components of the forward
line.
The Stanford backfield is strong on
defense. Cass, Boyle, and Vander
burg will hold down the positions at

half, while Dut
ton and J. Adams
fill their places
at full. Ring, who
plays goal for the
first time this
year, lacks ex
perience but has
played a con
sist en t game
throughout the
season.
The Cardinal
players have
shown a rapid
improvement in
form during the
last two weeks.
In the .rapid-fire,
ten-man victory
over the iast Cel
tic ag g r egation

they gave the bleachers a glimpse of
what may be expected of them in an
intercollegiate battle.
California is putting the best team
in her soccer annals on the field Sat
urday. Eight veterans will throw the
weight of their previous intercolle
giate experience into the balance '<>
try to make the game a California
win. Captain Kellas, ex-captain
Cook, goal-keeper Shafe,r, Wedemey
er, Feliz, Miller, Mayer and Webster
are the old players whose names ap
pear in Saturday's line-up. Harding,
a new man who is slated for center
half, is one of the fastest men on the
Berkeley squad. His work in drib
bling rushes is one of the features
of the Blue and Gold play this year.
California has had a paid coach this
season for the first time in soccer his
tory at the state institution, and the
sport has made rapid strides under
the new regime.
This game, besides being one of the
regular intercollegiate series, is on
the schedule of the recently formed
Exposition Soccer League of five
clubs. The rival universities have
been trying their strength in the pre
liminary games against the city
teams. The dope sheet shows the
contests to date as follows:
Stanford—Games won, three (two
by default): games lost, two; points
scored against opponents, nine (four


Captain Hlodiret
counted for the two defaults); points
scored by opponents against Stan
ford, seven.
California — Games won, three;
games lost, two; points scored against
opponents, nine; points scored by op
ponents against California, seven.
According to the figures of the pre
liminary games the two teams seem
to be about fifty-fifty in merit, but
dopesters seem slightly inclined to
favor California.

regular intercollegiate series, is on
the schedule of the recently formed
Exposition Soccer League of five
clubs. The rival universities have
been trying their strength in the pre
liminary games against the city
teams. The dope sheet shows the
contests to date as follows:
Stanford—Games won, three (two
by default): games lost, two; points
scored against opponents, nine (four


Captain Hlodiret
counted for the two defaults); points
scored by opponents against Stan
ford, seven.
California — Games won, three;
games lost, two; points scored against
opponents, nine; points scored by op
ponents against California, seven.
According to the figures of the pre
liminary games the two teams seem
to be about fifty-fifty in merit, but
dopesters seem slightly inclined to
favor California.
Only Four Veterans Represent
Cardinal in First Match of
Annual Series, But Backfield
Will Put Up Strong Defense
CALIFORNIA ELEVEN SKILLED
California turf will be christened
by its first intercollegiate struggle on
Saturday morning when the Cardinal
and Blue and Gold soccer elevens will
line up in the first of their annual
series of three matches. The game
promises to be close, but the dope
sters are inclined to give California
the edge for the first time since the
establishment of soccer as a minor
sport.
Stanford will send a team on the
field with but four veterans in the
ranks. Captain Blodget, ex-captain
Higgins, Dutton and Cass have won
their circlets against California and
will be the mainstay of Cardinal
hopes. The remainder of the team is
made up of men who have had no in
tercollegiate experience. Kyle, a
Freshman who has been showing up
well this fall, should prove a menace
to the Blue and Gold defense. Shaw
and S. Adams will show as clover and
steady components of the forward
line.
The Stanford backfield is strong on
defense. Cass, Boyle, and Vander
burg will hold down the positions at

half, while Dut
ton and J. Adams
fill their places
at full. Ring, who
