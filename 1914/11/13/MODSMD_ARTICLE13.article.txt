# ROOTERS VOW FAITH IN TEAM AT MONSTER RALLY
## LOYAL CARDINAL SUPPORTERS STIR FIGHTING BLOOD Throng Serpentines Freshman Pyre After Mingling Words of Encouragement with Wild Enthusiasm. 
### 
They're oft'! The Assembly Hall
lights are dark, the sturdy men of the
1914 Varsity have had their brief
taste of spangled glory, the vows of
loyalty have been exchanged, and tha
writhing tongues of the rally fire have
licked the sky. Now the green turf
of California Field is become the
mecca of thousandfold Stanford men
and women.
The rally and serpentine last even
ing welded a unity of purpose from
the polyglot workaday interests of a
varied congregation. From the time
the throngs pressed into the Assembly
Hall until they surged outdoors to cir
cle the big fire, the reformation of
Stanford Spirit, which never is trite
because it is real, was cumulated.
No thing in particular 011 the pro
gram can be indicated as the great
thrilling force. The music of the
band, the raucous music of the yells,
the remarks of the speakers, the en
try of the team, were all parts of the
scheme,
Long before the time set for the
first yell the Assembly Hall over
flowed with lusty-voiced Cardinal
rooters, who let loose the "pep"
stored up for weeks, when the long
line of Encina men swayed down the
aisle '11 lock-step to the martial beat
of the Stanford Band, across the
stage 011 a level with the footlights
and down the opposite side of the hall
to their seats in the front division.
Dr. Branner was the first speaker
introduced by Yell' Leader Nixon. His
welcome by the horde of students as
sembled was as enthusiastic as it
was sincere.
"I have heard a great deal about
Stanford enthusiasm, but I think it
must have all run over tonight." said
Dr. Branner in the course of his
speech of encouragement and cheer.
"I do not know vhv I should have
been asked to talk to you tonight, er~
cept to give you an official and cordial
blessing and to wish you all success.
May the best team win!"
Former Coach George J. Presley,
'07, followed Dr. Branner in a brief
but characteristic talk. "If ever a
Stanford Varsity deserved the sup
port of the students the team that
goes on the field Saturday certainly
does. Stay with them until it's over,
no matter how it goes. Go to it!"
Trainer Harry Maloney expressed
his faith in the team which he has
guarded with care since the beginning
of the season. "Every man on the
Stanford Varsity fifteen is fit both
mentally and physically to fight the
battle of his life Saturday afternoon,"
declared the Cardinal trainer.
Coach Floyd Brown made a straight
from-tlie-shoulder statement of the
real fight before the Varsity tomor
row. "The spirit of willingness dis
played this season by every man on
the team is notable. Our team has
not been overestimated. The Califor
nia team has been constantly under
estimated since the beginning of the
season. We're going into the game Sat
urday to fight every inch of the way!"
Palmer Fuller, '10, concluded the
program of speeches. "It's enthus
iasm, and a bundle of it, that we need
Saturday afternoon. The California
team is a mighty tough proposition
and it'll take all every one of you fel
lows have got to lick 'em!"

guarded with care since the beginning
of the season. "Every man on the
Stanford Varsity fifteen is fit both
mentally and physically to fight the
battle of his life Saturday afternoon,"
declared the Cardinal trainer.
Coach Floyd Brown made a straight
from-tlie-shoulder statement of the
real fight before the Varsity tomor
row. "The spirit of willingness dis
played this season by every man on
the team is notable. Our team has
not been overestimated. The Califor
nia team has been constantly under
estimated since the beginning of the
season. We're going into the game Sat
urday to fight every inch of the way!"
Palmer Fuller, '10, concluded the
program of speeches. "It's enthus
iasm, and a bundle of it, that we need
Saturday afternoon. The California
team is a mighty tough proposition
and it'll take all every one of you fel
lows have got to lick 'em!"
They're oft'! The Assembly Hall
lights are dark, the sturdy men of the
1914 Varsity have had their brief
taste of spangled glory, the vows of
loyalty have been exchanged, and tha
writhing tongues of the rally fire have
licked the sky. Now the green turf
of California Field is become the
mecca of thousandfold Stanford men
and women.
The rally and serpentine last even
ing welded a unity of purpose from
the polyglot workaday interests of a
varied congregation. From the time
the throngs pressed into the Assembly
Hall until they surged outdoors to cir
cle the big fire, the reformation of
Stanford Spirit, which never is trite
because it is real, was cumulated.
No thing in particular 011 the pro
gram can be indicated as the great
thrilling force. The music of the
band, the raucous music of the yells,
the remarks of the speakers, the en
try of the team, were all parts of the
scheme,
Long before the time set for the
first yell the Assembly Hall over
flowed with lusty-voiced Cardinal
rooters, who let loose the "pep"
stored up for weeks, when the long
line of Encina men swayed down the
aisle '11 lock-step to the martial beat
of the Stanford Band, across the
stage 011 a level with the footlights
and down the opposite side of the hall
to their seats in the front division.
Dr. Branner was the first speaker
introduced by Yell' Leader Nixon. His
welcome by the horde of students as
sembled was as enthusiastic as it
was sincere.
"I have heard a great deal about
Stanford enthusiasm, but I think it
must have all run over tonight." said
Dr. Branner in the course of his
speech of encouragement and cheer.
"I do not know vhv I should have
been asked to talk to you tonight, er~
cept to give you an official and cordial
blessing and to wish you all success.
May the best team win!"
Former Coach George J. Presley,
'07, followed Dr. Branner in a brief
but characteristic talk. "If ever a
Stanford Varsity deserved the sup
port of the students the team that
goes on the field Saturday certainly
does. Stay with them until it's over,
no matter how it goes. Go to it!"
Trainer Harry Maloney expressed
his faith in the team which he has
guarded with care since the beginning
of the season. "Every man on the
Stanford Varsity fifteen is fit both
mentally and physically to fight the
battle of his life Saturday afternoon,"
