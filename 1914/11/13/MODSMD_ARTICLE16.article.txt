## CARDINAL TIPS SCALES ON TRANS-BAY RIVALS Weight of Varsity Totals Two and a Quarter Tonsâ€”Age Exceeds Three Centuries. 
### 
The Stanford and California Var
sities which will answer Referee
Byrne's whistle tomorrow afternoon
are almost evenly matched in weight,
both in the aggregate and in the for
ward divisions.
The gross weight of the Cardinal
fifteen is a little better than two tons
and a quarter, the exact figure being
2529 pounds. California's combined
fichting force would tip the beam at
2501 pounds, making a difference pe.r
man of 1.56 pounds.
Tn the pack, where weight is a most
telling factor, the Cardinal has a
shade of 1 1-8 pounds per man. The
totals are 1405 and 1386 pounds for
the two forward lineups.
By totaling the age of the Stanford
team we find that something over
three centuries of struggling human
ity will be rolled onto the turf, the
total number of years being 338, or
on an average, 22.86 yea.rs to the man.
The Blue and Gold's total experience
in life covers a period of 319 years,
giving an average of 21.26 to the man.
There is a difference in the total ases
of 19 years, which figures to 1.26 years
superannuitv the Cardinal has over
its rival.
