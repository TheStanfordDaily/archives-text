# STANFORD RUGGERS IN "WHO'S WHO"- TRIED VETERANS STRENGTHEN LINE
## 
### 
Those fifteen men who will wear
Cardinal jerseys in the first scrim
mage against the enemy at Berkeley
are the best who could be chosen
during a long season of gruelling try
out. That the honors of the block
"S" should fall to the lot of such
sterling men is a compliment to the
gritty members of the glorious "twi
light squad" which has made the 1914
Varsity a hard fighting fact. And the
sportsmen who ran a close race, but
didn't quite get in at the finish have
been the first to give congratulations.
A short biographical sketch of each
of the team members and of the ten
substitutes is given in the following
columns.
Frank Jacob Garil.
Deke Card, the dashing Cardinal
leader and as brilliant a breakaway

as ever trod the
Stanford turf, will
win his four stars
when he plays in
the intercollegi
ate match Satur
day. He played in
his favored posi
tion on the Ail-
American teams
that lined up
against the Wara
ta h sand All
.Blacks in 1912
and 1913. Last fall
Deke captained
the wearers of
the red.white and
blue shield. Gard
is a member of the

Quadrangle Club, Skull and Snakes,
and Phi Gamma Delta, and he .reg
isters in the Chemistry Department.
He stands an even six feet in height,
weighs 164 pounds and is 22 years of
age.
Elwin Itcnoni Hall.
A fighter through and through, Ebe
Hall wins a well merited position in

the front rank of
the Varsity. This
will make the
third year that the
scrappy forward
has worn the Car
dinal colors in an
interco 11 eg i a t e
match. Hall is a
member of Skull
and Snakes, the
University Con
ference, and be
longs to the Beta
Theta Pi frater
nity. He is ma
joring in Geology

and Mining and hails from Los An
geles. He weighs lfi7 pounds, is 5
feet 10 inches tall, and 23 years old.
Itoliinri Hoy Blase.
Jumbo Blase, by his consistent work
throughout the preliminary games has

proven his undeniable
ability to hold the
scrum together, and so
has earned the right to
play at. lock in the su
preme test of the sea
son. On account of his
superiority in both
height and weight over
all other members of
the team, he renders
wonderful service in
the line-outs and fig
ures prominently in all
dribbling rushes. This
will be the second time
! that Hlase has locked
the scrum in the Stan-

ford-California r u R by
classic. St. Paul, Minnesota, is his
home. Blase is a candidate for a de
gree in the Department of Civil Engin

age.
Helinus Weddel Andrews.
The old .reliable Andy Andrews, who
stands like a stone wall guarding the

the last defense, will
again hold down the
fullback berth. Not
a single opposing
rugger has a record
of getting by the
Stanford fullback for
a resulting score.and
so implicit confi
dence has been placed
in his ability. An
drews claims mem
bership in Skull and
Snakes, Univer si t y
Conference, and Kap
pa Alpha fraternity.

Diego, and majors

Law. Andrews is 22 years of age, 5
feet, 10 inches tall, and tips the beam

171 pounds.

injuries time and time again only to

.return to the foot
ball field undaunt
ed, has once more
been chosen to up
hold the honor of
the Cardinal at his
old position at
wing. In his Fresh

distinctly aggressive
and clean-cut. Erb

Washington, and he
gained a previous
knowledge of rugby

Legal department. He weighs 160
pounds, is 22 years old, and stands 5

who will oppose California in the

front rank, has come
to the fore with an
amazing show of
class. Wines won
his "S" last year
for the first time
when the Blue and
Gold fifteen was
forced to bow in su
periority to Stan

take his place at
wing on the blind
side. He is a
natural player,
thro u g hand
through, endowed
with all the re
quired rugby
char acteristica.
Time and again
this season he
has set the root
ers on their feet
with long swerv
ing dashes to the
opposition goal

line. In his Freshman year he cap
tained the 1916 fifteen. Urban's home
is in Hamilton City, and he majors
in Botany, He is the lightest member
of the team, as he tips the beam at
barely 148 pounds. His heights is 5
feet 7 1-2 inches, and his age 22.
.limit's Thomas Wylie.
Jim Wylie, the genial giant of All-
Black fame, will inspire joy in the
hearts of Cardinal rooters when he
takes his place opposite Captain Gard
at breakaway. This is Wylie's first op
portunity to represent Stanford in the
annual intercollegiate with California.
Wylie has toured the coast as a mem
ber of both the invading Waratahs and
All-Blacks, who made sucn an envi

Department. Auckland, New Zealand,
claims him as a resident. Wylie
weighs 188 pounds, stands 6 feet, 2
inches in height, and is 26 years of

Daniel Brendan Carroll.
The Australian phenom, Danny
Carroll, at his position of center

three-quart ers, is
the sturdy wedge
who locks the back
field together with
his masterly hand
ling of the ball.
Among the rugby
experts of the well
known Waratahs, he
is heralded as a star
of the first order. A
Briton by birth, Car
roll has played for
St. George, New
South Wales, and
all-Australian rug
by teams. His fra
ternity is Sigma Al
pha Epsilon, and he

majors in the department of Civil En

the honor of scor
ing the first try.
Lachmund pr e
pared in Palo Alto
high school, where
he was one of the
mainstays of the

mund is 19 years of age, 5 feet 9 1-2
inches in height, and weighs 158

Charles Alpliin Austin.
Charley Austin, rated as Califor
nia's premier first five, will again be

the pivot upon
which the back
field play will
hinge. To Aus
tin will be in
trusted the con
version of all
Stanford's tries
in Saturday's
game. His won
derful play last
season earned
him a place on
the All - Star
American team
which contested
with the New
Zealanders. Aus
tin's home is in
Berkeley. He is

making Civil Engineering his study
in college. Theta Delta Chi is
his fraternity. Austin tips the scales
at an even IGO pounds, is 5 feet 9

Henry Stanley Pettingill.
"Pett" Pettingill, the rangy Sopho
more, will receive his first taste of
Hear blood when he throws his weight
behind the Stanford scrum tomorrow
in his position at middle rank. Up
to the last minute there existed doubt
as to who would fill this place in the
Cardinal pack, but after a hotly waged
contest Pettingill finally proved his
superiority. Civil Engineering is his
major study, and Beta Theta Pi his
fraternity. Pettingill is one of the
heaviest men in the scrum, weighing
178 pounds; he stands one inch over
6 feet, and claims the voting age.

experts of the well

Cardinal pack, but after a hotly waged
contest Pettingill finally proved his
superiority. Civil Engineering is his
major study, and Beta Theta Pi his
fraternity. Pettingill is one of the
heaviest men in the scrum, weighing

which one of the below mentioned
ruggers has not the ability to fill with
credit. W. H. Henry, '18, of Los An

Those fifteen men who will wear
Cardinal jerseys in the first scrim
mage against the enemy at Berkeley
are the best who could be chosen
during a long season of gruelling try
out. That the honors of the block
"S" should fall to the lot of such
sterling men is a compliment to the
gritty members of the glorious "twi
light squad" which has made the 1914
Varsity a hard fighting fact. And the
sportsmen who ran a close race, but
didn't quite get in at the finish have
been the first to give congratulations.
A short biographical sketch of each
of the team members and of the ten
substitutes is given in the following
columns.
Frank Jacob Garil.
Deke Card, the dashing Cardinal
leader and as brilliant a breakaway

as ever trod the

play at. lock in the su
preme test of the sea

superiority in both
height and weight over
all other members of
the team, he renders
wonderful service in
the line-outs and fig

his style of play.
In the big game
last year he had
the honor of scor
ing the first try.
Lachmund pr e

high school, where
he was one of the
mainstays of the
fast rugby team.

the pivot upon
which the back
field play will
hinge. To Aus
tin will be in
trusted the con
version of all
Stanford's tries
in Saturday's
game. His won
derful play last
season earned
him a place on
the All - Star
American team
which contested
with the New

Henry Stanley Pettingill.
"Pett" Pettingill, the rangy Sopho
more, will receive his first taste of
Hear blood when he throws his weight
behind the Stanford scrum tomorrow
in his position at middle rank. Up
to the last minute there existed doubt
as to who would fill this place in the
Cardinal pack, but after a hotly waged
contest Pettingill finally proved his
superiority. Civil Engineering is his
major study, and Beta Theta Pi his
fraternity. Pettingill is one of the
heaviest men in the scrum, weighing
178 pounds; he stands one inch over
6 feet, and claims the voting age.
Substitutes.
Coach Floyd Brown has chosen ten
players of almost varsity caliber from
the inside squad who will act as re
lief men in case of emergencies.
There is not a position on the team
which one of the below mentioned
ruggers has not the ability to fill with
credit. W. H. Henry, '18, of Los An
geles, will take care of front rank.
F. E. Rehm, '15, of Sonora, and J. R.
Bratlen, '16, of Santa Clara, have sec
ond call on middle rank, while the

held in reserve as a utility forward
substitute.

of San Francisco, as relief candidate.
R. R. Templeton. who hails from Palo
Alto, will take care of either first five
or fullback should either Austin or

'17. of Oakland, is primed for second
five-eighths. The tenth substitute, W.
S. Burns. '14, a San Francisco resi
dent. will relieve at wing or center
three-quarters, should the occasion
demand.



Those fifteen men who will wear
Cardinal jerseys in the first scrim
mage against the enemy at Berkeley
are the best who could be chosen
during a long season of gruelling try
out. That the honors of the block
"S" should fall to the lot of such
sterling men is a compliment to the
gritty members of the glorious "twi
light squad" which has made the 1914
Varsity a hard fighting fact. And the
sportsmen who ran a close race, but
didn't quite get in at the finish have
been the first to give congratulations.
A short biographical sketch of each
of the team members and of the ten
substitutes is given in the following
columns.
Frank Jacob Garil.
Deke Card, the dashing Cardinal
leader and as brilliant a breakaway

as ever trod the
Stanford turf, will
win his four stars
when he plays in
the intercollegi
ate match Satur
day. He played in
his favored posi
tion on the Ail-
American teams
that lined up
against the Wara
ta h sand All
.Blacks in 1912
and 1913. Last fall
Deke captained
the wearers of
the red.white and
blue shield. Gard

and Phi Gamma Delta, and he .reg
isters in the Chemistry Department.

scrappy forward
has worn the Car

interco 11 eg i a t e
match. Hall is a

throughout the preliminary games has

proven his undeniable
ability to hold the
scrum together, and so
has earned the right to
play at. lock in the su
preme test of the sea
son. On account of his
superiority in both
height and weight over
all other members of
the team, he renders
wonderful service in
the line-outs and fig
ures prominently in all
dribbling rushes. This
will be the second time
! that Hlase has locked
the scrum in the Stan-

ford-California r u R by
classic. St. Paul, Minnesota, is his

stands like a stone wall guarding the

the last defense, will
again hold down the

hold the honor of
the Cardinal at his
old position at

ling of the ball.

experts of the well
known Waratahs, he

Those fifteen men who will wear
Cardinal jerseys in the first scrim
mage against the enemy at Berkeley
are the best who could be chosen
during a long season of gruelling try
out. That the honors of the block
"S" should fall to the lot of such
sterling men is a compliment to the
gritty members of the glorious "twi
light squad" which has made the 1914
Varsity a hard fighting fact. And the

experts of the well

more, will receive his first taste of
Hear blood when he throws his weight
behind the Stanford scrum tomorrow
in his position at middle rank. Up

Cardinal pack, but after a hotly waged
contest Pettingill finally proved his
superiority. Civil Engineering is his
major study, and Beta Theta Pi his
fraternity. Pettingill is one of the
heaviest men in the scrum, weighing

players of almost varsity caliber from
the inside squad who will act as re
lief men in case of emergencies.
There is not a position on the team
which one of the below mentioned
ruggers has not the ability to fill with
credit. W. H. Henry, '18, of Los An
geles, will take care of front rank.
F. E. Rehm, '15, of Sonora, and J. R.
Bratlen, '16, of Santa Clara, have sec
ond call on middle rank, while the

five-eighths. The tenth substitute, W.
S. Burns. '14, a San Francisco resi
dent. will relieve at wing or center
three-quarters, should the occasion

Those fifteen men who will wear
Cardinal jerseys in the first scrim
mage against the enemy at Berkeley
are the best who could be chosen
during a long season of gruelling try
out. That the honors of the block
"S" should fall to the lot of such
sterling men is a compliment to the
gritty members of the glorious "twi
light squad" which has made the 1914
Varsity a hard fighting fact. And the
sportsmen who ran a close race, but
didn't quite get in at the finish have
been the first to give congratulations.
A short biographical sketch of each
of the team members and of the ten
substitutes is given in the following
columns.
Frank Jacob Garil.
Deke Card, the dashing Cardinal
leader and as brilliant a breakaway

as ever trod the
Stanford turf, will

superiority in both
height and weight over
all other members of
the team, he renders
wonderful service in
the line-outs and fig

fraternity. Pettingill is one of the
heaviest men in the scrum, weighing
178 pounds; he stands one inch over
6 feet, and claims the voting age.
Substitutes.
Coach Floyd Brown has chosen ten
players of almost varsity caliber from
the inside squad who will act as re
lief men in case of emergencies.
There is not a position on the team
which one of the below mentioned
ruggers has not the ability to fill with
credit. W. H. Henry, '18, of Los An
geles, will take care of front rank.
F. E. Rehm, '15, of Sonora, and J. R.
Bratlen, '16, of Santa Clara, have sec
ond call on middle rank, while the
lock positions will find S. A. Hal
sted, '17, of Riverside. As Blase's under

L. A. Ogden. '15, of Bakerefield, is
held in reserve as a utility forward
substitute.
Halfback brings F. F. Walker. '18.
of San Francisco, as relief candidate.
R. R. Templeton. who hails from Palo
Alto, will take care of either first five
or fullback should either Austin or
Andrews be injured. T. E. Swigart.
'17. of Oakland, is primed for second
five-eighths. The tenth substitute, W.
S. Burns. '14, a San Francisco resi
dent. will relieve at wing or center
three-quarters, should the occasion
demand.



Those fifteen men who will wear
Cardinal jerseys in the first scrim
mage against the enemy at Berkeley
are the best who could be chosen
during a long season of gruelling try
out. That the honors of the block
"S" should fall to the lot of such
sterling men is a compliment to the
gritty members of the glorious "twi
light squad" which has made the 1914
Varsity a hard fighting fact. And the
sportsmen who ran a close race, but
didn't quite get in at the finish have
been the first to give congratulations.
A short biographical sketch of each
of the team members and of the ten
substitutes is given in the following
columns.
Frank Jacob Garil.
Deke Card, the dashing Cardinal
leader and as brilliant a breakaway

as ever trod the
Stanford turf, will
win his four stars
when he plays in
the intercollegi
ate match Satur
day. He played in
his favored posi
tion on the Ail-
American teams
that lined up
against the Wara
ta h sand All
.Blacks in 1912
and 1913. Last fall
Deke captained
the wearers of
the red.white and
blue shield. Gard
is a member of the

Quadrangle Club, Skull and Snakes,
and Phi Gamma Delta, and he .reg
isters in the Chemistry Department.
He stands an even six feet in height,
weighs 164 pounds and is 22 years of
age.
Elwin Itcnoni Hall.
A fighter through and through, Ebe
Hall wins a well merited position in

the front rank of
the Varsity. This
will make the
third year that the
scrappy forward
has worn the Car
dinal colors in an
interco 11 eg i a t e
match. Hall is a
member of Skull
and Snakes, the
University Con
ference, and be
longs to the Beta
Theta Pi frater
nity. He is ma
joring in Geology

and Mining and hails from Los An
geles. He weighs lfi7 pounds, is 5
feet 10 inches tall, and 23 years old.
Itoliinri Hoy Blase.
Jumbo Blase, by his consistent work
throughout the preliminary games has

proven his undeniable
ability to hold the
scrum together, and so
has earned the right to
play at. lock in the su
preme test of the sea
son. On account of his
superiority in both
height and weight over
all other members of
the team, he renders
wonderful service in
the line-outs and fig
ures prominently in all
dribbling rushes. This
will be the second time
! that Hlase has locked
the scrum in the Stan-

ford-California r u R by
classic. St. Paul, Minnesota, is his
home. Blase is a candidate for a de
gree in the Department of Civil Engin

is G feet, 4 inches tall, and 27 years of
age.
Helinus Weddel Andrews.
The old .reliable Andy Andrews, who
stands like a stone wall guarding the

the last defense, will
again hold down the
fullback berth. Not
a single opposing
rugger has a record
of getting by the
Stanford fullback for
a resulting score.and
so implicit confi
dence has been placed
in his ability. An
drews claims mem
bership in Skull and
Snakes, Univer si t y
Conference, and Kap
pa Alpha fraternity.

Diego, and majors

Law. Andrews is 22 years of age, 5

171 pounds.

been chosen to up
hold the honor of
the Cardinal at his
old position at

gained a previous
knowledge of rugby

Legal department. He weighs 160
pounds, is 22 years old, and stands 5

who will oppose California in the

front rank, has come
to the fore with an
amazing show of
class. Wines won
his "S" last year
for the first time
when the Blue and
Gold fifteen was
forced to bow in su
periority to Stan

take his place at
wing on the blind
side. He is a
natural player,
thro u g hand
through, endowed
with all the re
quired rugby
char acteristica.
Time and again
this season he
has set the root
ers on their feet
with long swerv
ing dashes to the
opposition goal

line. In his Freshman year he cap
tained the 1916 fifteen. Urban's home
is in Hamilton City, and he majors

barely 148 pounds. His heights is 5
feet 7 1-2 inches, and his age 22.
.limit's Thomas Wylie.
Jim Wylie, the genial giant of All-
Black fame, will inspire joy in the
hearts of Cardinal rooters when he
takes his place opposite Captain Gard
at breakaway. This is Wylie's first op
portunity to represent Stanford in the
annual intercollegiate with California.
Wylie has toured the coast as a mem
ber of both the invading Waratahs and

Department. Auckland, New Zealand,
claims him as a resident. Wylie
weighs 188 pounds, stands 6 feet, 2
inches in height, and is 26 years of

Daniel Brendan Carroll.
The Australian phenom, Danny
Carroll, at his position of center

three-quart ers, is
the sturdy wedge
who locks the back
field together with
his masterly hand
ling of the ball.
Among the rugby
experts of the well
known Waratahs, he
is heralded as a star
of the first order. A
Briton by birth, Car

he was one of the
mainstays of the

the pivot upon
which the back
field play will
hinge. To Aus
tin will be in
trusted the con
version of all
Stanford's tries
in Saturday's
game. His won
derful play last
season earned
him a place on
the All - Star
American team
which contested
with the New
Zealanders. Aus
tin's home is in
Berkeley. He is

making Civil Engineering his study
in college. Theta Delta Chi is
his fraternity. Austin tips the scales
at an even IGO pounds, is 5 feet 9

Henry Stanley Pettingill.
"Pett" Pettingill, the rangy Sopho
more, will receive his first taste of
Hear blood when he throws his weight
behind the Stanford scrum tomorrow
in his position at middle rank. Up

as to who would fill this place in the
Cardinal pack, but after a hotly waged
contest Pettingill finally proved his
superiority. Civil Engineering is his
major study, and Beta Theta Pi his
fraternity. Pettingill is one of the
heaviest men in the scrum, weighing
