# STANFORD RUGGERS IN "WHO'S WHO"- TRIED VETERANS STRENGTHEN LINE
## 
### 
Those fifteen men who will wear
Cardinal jerseys in the first scrim
mage against the enemy at Berkeley
are the best who could be chosen
during a long season of gruelling try
out. That the honors of the block
"S" should fall to the lot of such
sterling men is a compliment to the
gritty members of the glorious "twi
light squad" which has made the 1914
Varsity a hard fighting fact. And the
sportsmen who ran a close race, but
didn't quite get in at the finish have
been the first to give congratulations.
A short biographical sketch of each
of the team members and of the ten
substitutes is given in the following
columns.
Frank Jacob Garil.
Deke Card, the dashing Cardinal
leader and as brilliant a breakaway

as ever trod the
Stanford turf, will
win his four stars
when he plays in
the intercollegi
ate match Satur
day. He played in
his favored posi
tion on the Ail-
American teams
that lined up
against the Wara
ta h sand All
.Blacks in 1912
and 1913. Last fall
Deke captained
the wearers of
the red.white and
blue shield. Gard
is a member of the

Quadrangle Club, Skull and Snakes,
and Phi Gamma Delta, and he .reg
isters in the Chemistry Department.
He stands an even six feet in height,
weighs 164 pounds and is 22 years of
age.
Elwin Itcnoni Hall.
A fighter through and through, Ebe
Hall wins a well merited position in

the front rank of
the Varsity. This
will make the
third year that the
scrappy forward
has worn the Car
dinal colors in an
interco 11 eg i a t e
match. Hall is a
member of Skull
and Snakes, the
University Con
ference, and be
longs to the Beta
Theta Pi frater
nity. He is ma
joring in Geology

and Mining and hails from Los An
geles. He weighs lfi7 pounds, is 5
feet 10 inches tall, and 23 years old.
Itoliinri Hoy Blase.
Jumbo Blase, by his consistent work
throughout the preliminary games has

proven his undeniable
ability to hold the
scrum together, and so
has earned the right to
play at. lock in the su
preme test of the sea
son. On account of his
superiority in both
height and weight over
all other members of
the team, he renders
wonderful service in
the line-outs and fig
ures prominently in all
dribbling rushes. This
will be the second time
! that Hlase has locked
the scrum in the Stan-

ford-California r u R by
classic. St. Paul, Minnesota, is his
home. Blase is a candidate for a de
gree in the Department of Civil Engin

eering, while his fraternity is Sigma
Nu. He tips the scales at 190 pounds;
is G feet, 4 inches tall, and 27 years of
age.
Helinus Weddel Andrews.
The old .reliable Andy Andrews, who
stands like a stone wall guarding the

the last defense, will
again hold down the
fullback berth. Not
a single opposing
rugger has a record
of getting by the
Stanford fullback for
a resulting score.and
so implicit confi
dence has been placed
in his ability. An
drews claims mem
bership in Skull and
Snakes, Univer si t y
Conference, and Kap
pa Alpha fraternity.
He hails from San
Diego, and majors

Law. Andrews is 22 years of age, 5
feet, 10 inches tall, and tips the beam
at 172 pounds.

in the final line-up is Phil Clover,

to whom again
will be intrusted
the care of a mid
dle rank position.

the 1914 Fresh
man team as side
ranker, and played
in that position on
last year's Var
sity, after substi
tutingvthe previous

and Snakes and
Quadrangle Club,
and Delta Kappa
Epsilon fraternity
claim him as a

member. Clover majors in the Civil
Engineering department and registers
from Pasadena. He is 22 years of age,
5 feet 11 inches in height, and weighs
171 pounds.
Frank Wixon Reeves
A player who has suffered serious
injuries time and time again only to

.return to the foot
ball field undaunt
ed, has once more
been chosen to up
hold the honor of
the Cardinal at his
old position at
wing. In his Fresh
man year Reeves
occupied the berth
of first five on the
1910 Varsity, while
during his Junior
and Senior years he

Harold Calhoun Soper.
The only player other than a vet
eran to he included in the Varsity
lineup is "Fat" Soper, upon whose
shoulders has fallen the task of chief
hooker in the front rank. For four
years he has striven for the honor of
wearing the much coveted "S," and
this season success has crowned the
efforts of the hard fighting forward.

1911 haby team, and last fall was a
Varsity substitute. He belongs to the

Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, and majors
in the Department of Geology. So
per is comparatively light, weighing
only 165 pounds; he measures an
even 5 feet 10 inches, and is 23 years

Arthur Leslie Erb.
In Art Erb, the Cardinal supporters
may boast of a finished and fast half-

back, whose play is
distinctly aggressive
and clean-cut. Erb
hails from Tacoma,
Washington, and he
gained a previous
knowledge of rugby
at Victoria high
school. In his Fresh
man year he occu
pied the position of
first five on the baby
fifteen, and acted as

fraternity, and is majoring in the P.re-
Legal department. He weighs 160
pounds, is 22 years old, and stands 5
feet 9 inches.
Blaine Leslie Wines.
"Tiny" Wines, the stocky rugger
who will oppose California in the

front rank, has come
to the fore with an
amazing show of
class. Wines won
his "S" last year
for the first time
when the Blue and
Gold fifteen was
forced to bow in su
periority to Stan
ford. In addition
he has played on his
class team each

wing on the blind
side. He is a
natural player,
thro u g hand
through, endowed
with all the re
quired rugby
char acteristica.
Time and again
this season he
has set the root
ers on their feet
with long swerv
ing dashes to the
opposition goal

line. In his Freshman year he cap
tained the 1916 fifteen. Urban's home
is in Hamilton City, and he majors
in Botany, He is the lightest member
of the team, as he tips the beam at
barely 148 pounds. His heights is 5
feet 7 1-2 inches, and his age 22.
.limit's Thomas Wylie.
Jim Wylie, the genial giant of All-
Black fame, will inspire joy in the
hearts of Cardinal rooters when he
takes his place opposite Captain Gard
at breakaway. This is Wylie's first op
portunity to represent Stanford in the
annual intercollegiate with California.
Wylie has toured the coast as a mem
ber of both the invading Waratahs and
All-Blacks, who made sucn an envi
