Convenient methods of reaching
California Field from both the Key
Route and Southern Pacific ferry slips
on the Oakland side of the Bay are:
From the Oakland Mole, take the
Ellsworth electric train, which ruus
directly to the campus, or the main
line train to Berkeley station at Cen
ter street. The first route is most ef

through the main entrance to the
campus. On the Key Route, either
transfer from the main train at Al
catraz avenue to a local car, or con
tinue on to the Berkeley station at
Center street. The Alcatraz avenue
line is most direct and easiest for
those who are able to get places on
the cars waiting at Alcatraz station.
