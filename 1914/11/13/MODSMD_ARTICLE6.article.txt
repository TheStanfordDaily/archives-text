# On Edge
## 
### 
We',re on the threshold, edging for
ward, and within twenty-four hours
we'll joyously burst into the game—
the real battle hour ot' the year. To
morrow morning the legion of rooters
will sweep into the stronghold of the
Blue and Gold; whether they are riot
ously victorious or are silent in de
feat, the thrill of competition has
made it worth while.
The repeated rumors of California
reprisals for splashes of red paint
Zeppeiined to the sacred "C," have
whetted the edge of the Cardinals'
sword—Saturday's long-planned sor
tie to California Field will strike
hard. A decade ago the feud would
have been bitter, there would have
been hate in the taunts Hung from the
Serpentine to the restive bleachers.
Yet today we are prepared to meet a
fair-playing, hard-fighting adversary
—proud to count the formidable
Berkeley Bear as our chief rival. Re
spect for the Blue and Gold as a
worthy foe has replaced the more bar
baric spirit of the Axe and Boardwalk
days.
On fifteen men in red and white
. ,i.s will rest the hopes of thousands
Stanford supporters. Whether
1., y win or lose we're with them
from first whistle to last gun—but
they'll win!
