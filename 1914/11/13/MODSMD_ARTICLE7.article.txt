# "BOBS" FORECASTS WIN FOR STANFORD FIFTEEN
## 
### "Bobs" of The Chronicle 
It is as easy to forecast the result
of a football game as it is to guess
the whims of a woman, yet we all
have so much of the gambler in our
make-up, the,re is such fascination in
the experiment, and so much satisfac
tion should success attend our efforts,
that we are ready at all times to take
another chance, just for luck. Here
T am for the eighth time attempting
to give the "Dippy" readers advance
information of what is to transpire on
the Rugby gridiron when the rival
college fifteens meet Saturday after
noon.
At the commencement of each col
lege season every undergrad is just
as callable of choosing the probable
winner of the big game as is the most
ardent student of the rugby code. A
winning team of the previous year
coming back to the campus practical
ly intact looms up as a certainty, yet
as each season advances partisanship
and preliminary successes seem to
equalize the chances of the two fif
teens and the wagering is usually
around the even mark.
The preliminary games have dem
onstrated that the Cardinal backfield
is better than ever, especially as a
scoring asset. Lachmund is a most
prolific scorer if given leeway for an
opening, but Austin is the most dan
gerous man on the side when crowd
ed by opponents and within ten yards
of the line. Please take notice that
it is much harder for the backs to
cross the chalk mark from the ten
yard line than it is from forty-yard
range, as the field is much mo.re scat
tered and the opposition can be
rounded more easily. Amos Elliott,
Rith Pauly, Stan Mitchell and A1
Frank were perhaps the best quartet
from close proximity to the line, and
Austin is just as dangerous as any of
them.
Then there is Danny Carroll, the

Australian speedburner, who plays
best when the occasion most demands
it; Joe Urban, who seems to be al
ways in correct position for a play;
Frank Reeves, swerver second to
none, whose name would have been
a byeword at Stanford but for repeat
ed injuries; and reliable Andrews,
whose boot and masterful grip wins
and saves lots of ground for his side.
The combination is truly a formidable
one in conjunction with an octette of
forwards who never know when to
quit and who are ably led by Skip
per Gard in the ruck and open play.
With very little material to com
mence with, what has California to
show? Everything that the coaches
have reason to be proud of: a host
of hustling forwards with enough
substitutes of near-varsity caliber to
make three teams. The wisdom of al
lowing the Freshmen to participate in
the annual encounter cannot be ques
tioned, as it has filled several holes
that looked like coal mines, and also
served to spur the veterans on to re
newed effort in order to insure their
places on the team.
It is difficult to glean any dope .in
preliminary games, as scores count for
nothing from a comparative basis.
The one hope of the forecaster, Santa
Clara, failed to give two exhibitions
of equal merit. They invaded Stan
ford like a fighting bunch of der
vishes —the adjective is correct—and
they played against California like a
flock of lambs.
Stanford 's nicely recovering from
a brief slump and every man will en
ter the field in the pink of condition.
Surely with everything else well bal
anced veterans should be given an ad
vantage over players with less exper
ience. It may be close, but I look for
the team that gets the break to win
handily, and there are ifs to the side
that is going to get them. It will,
without doubt, be devoid of any un
pleasant incidents as both teams to a
man are clean sportsmen and have
been coached to play as auch. May
Referee Byrne have an easy time of
it!
