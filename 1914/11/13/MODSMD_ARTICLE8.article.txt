Today's poetical advice to rooters,
by Geoffrey Morgan, '10, appeared in
the November 190S issue of Chap
arral.
The players can supply the skill
To win the game of course,
But inspiration comes to them
From quite another source;
If Stanford is to win the day,
Remember, one and all,
The men who root must be behind
The men behind the ball!
So roar the "Berkeley Tombstone,"
Give a cheer for Stanford red,
Stand up and yell to beat all
And urge the team ahead;
The axe 011 poor old Berkeley
With a deadly thud shall fall, —
But the fans have got to be behind
The men behind the ball!
