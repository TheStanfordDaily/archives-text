# WORRY OVER WORLD WAR STRIKES PROFESSOR EWALD FLUEGEL FROM ROLL
## HEART FAILURE IS CAUSE Faculty Associates Pay Tribute in Glowing Terms to the Late Head of Philology Department 
### 
Ewald Fluegel, head of the depart
ment of English Philology, connected
with the University since 1592, the
year following the founding of Stan
ford, a world-renowned scholar in both
the field of languages and literature,
passed away at his home, 1153 Cowper
Avenue, Saturday evening. The direct
cause of his death has been attributed
to heart failure. While on his vaca
tion in Coronado this summer, he was
seriously ill, but recovered in time to
take up his duties with the opening of
college. He kept at his work until th-2
beginning of last week, and attended
classes Monday. It would be only a
slight exaggeration to say that he was
a victim of the European war, as there
is no doubt that his distress over the
situation added to his illness, and cer
tainly hastened bis death.
Professor Fluegel, who was of Ger
man stock and birth, was born at
Leipsig. August 4, 1863. When 23
years of age he received a degree of
Doctor of Philosophy. 188 C, at the Uni
versity of Leipsig. Four years later
he was a private docent there, lectur
ing on English literature and lan
guages, until he was finally called ro
Stanford in 1892. His profound schol
arship, abiPty as a teacher, and power
to inspire the enthusiasm of his sub
ject into his students made him espe
cially desirable as a member of the fac
ulty of this institution.
The greatest work of Doctor Fluegel,
which will stand permanent in the an
nals of literature, is the Chaucer Dic
tionary. upon which lie has labored a
quarter of a century, and as yet is onlv
a little more than half completed. The
tark has l een expanded from a plan
for a Chaucer's Concordance to the
scope of covering the contemporaries
and immediate predecessors of the old
English writer. It is a matter of doubt
if any author can He found to complete
this tremendous undertaking, which is
ready for printing in portions from A
nearly through H, requiring a wonder
ful scholarly mind and wide breadth
of view. Enough material has already
been compiled to form two volumes of
the size of Murray's great dictionary.
Professor Fluegel is a descendant of
an old German family of dictionary
makers. His private library is prob
ably unexcelled anywhere in the Un't
ed States in the field of old and Middle
English literature. He began the col
lection years ago in Leipsig and Lon
don, and acquired a vast number of
rare and costly books. He made an at
tempt to get behind Chaucer's mental
viewpoint, and so acquired books that
the old English poet might have read.
Professor Fluegel is survived by his
wife and four children. Felix Fluegel,
'14, Ewald Fluegel, Hildegarde Fluegel,
ex-'l3, and the youngest daughter, Hel
ena. Five members of the Faculty, who
have spent the last sixteen years as an
intimate friend of the deceased, pay
Doctor Fluegel's delightful, kindly and
winning personality, and his simple,
direct, and honest character fitting
tribute.
The funeral of Professor Fluegel
will be held at his residence, 1153
Cowper street, Palo Alto, at ten o'clock
Tuesday morning, November 17. All
forenoon classes of the Departments of
| English and English Philology are
| dismissed.
President Hranner extols Doctor
Fluegel's memory in the following
l'nes: "Professor Pluegel was one
of the leading scholars of the country;
he was a man of the highest ideals and
of the soundest principles; and he was
loved and respected by every one who
knew him personally. Hi • death is a
great and irreparable hiss to Stanford
University."
Professor S. S. Seward, of the
English Department, praises his lato
associate with the following: "Doctor
Fluegel's mind was one of singular
richness, fed by sincere enthusiasm in
many fields of letters and art. It was
a creation, too, in (he sense that it as
similated and vitalized its vast store of
learning, so that it has been said
perhaps with truth, that he was the
man best fitted in our day to read and
officiate medieval literature from the
standpoint of a contemporary. His
nature radiated enthusiasm. We have
never known the extent of his individu
al helpfulness, but that he was warm
hearted, generous. hospitable, and sin
cere, we know well, and shall remem
ber always."
P-ofessor K. G. Rendtorff, of the De
partment of German, pays his respects
with the following appreciation: "In
Dr. Ewald Fluegel the University loses
one of its most inspiring teachers, a
man of the highest ideals, a thorough
scholar, and an indefatigable worker.
His many friends will miss his warm
heart and his cheerful disposition. His
life work came to an end when he was
in the prime of his powers. A few
years more, and he would have fin
ished his gigantic task, the Chaucer
Dictionary."
A tribute to Doctor Fluegel, as a
man, is summed up by Professor H. .T.
Hall, of the English Department: "He
radiated kindness and good cheer. His
presence was enough to bring sun
shine to the gloomiest situation. None
of his friends, not even his family,
knew of all his kindness to those who
needed help. Tt was not alone in the
little acts of courtesy which appeared
in every hour of his contact with oth
ers, but in matters that called for real
sacrifice that his life was filled. Every
one in need had a claim on his love."
Dr. Frank Angell, head of the Psy
chology Department, and life-long
friend of the deceased, voices his grief:
"It seems unbelievable and almost un
bearable that Fluegel is no longer
with us:—the ready sympathy, the
generous kindness, the eager helpful
ness towards those who would learn,
the profound scholarship, the pure and
lofty intellectual ideals, the frank
contempt for shams —all these quali
ties which, beyond the powers of any
other among us, have raised the aca
demic level and quickened our intel
lectual life, have passed away. That
the memory of these things will abide
with us is assuredly at present but
slight consolation to the University
acamed'c life at large; the present time
itself needed him, but he has passed
away in the flower of his intellectual
gifts, and we shall not look upon
his like again."

chology Department, and life-long
friend of the deceased, voices his grief:
"It seems unbelievable and almost un
bearable that Fluegel is no longer
with us:—the ready sympathy, the
generous kindness, the eager helpful
ness towards those who would learn,
the profound scholarship, the pure and
lofty intellectual ideals, the frank
contempt for shams —all these quali
ties which, beyond the powers of any
other among us, have raised the aca
demic level and quickened our intel
lectual life, have passed away. That
the memory of these things will abide
with us is assuredly at present but
slight consolation to the University
acamed'c life at large; the present time
itself needed him, but he has passed
away in the flower of his intellectual
gifts, and we shall not look upon
his like again."
Ewald Fluegel, head of the depart
ment of English Philology, connected
with the University since 1592, the
year following the founding of Stan
ford, a world-renowned scholar in both
the field of languages and literature,
passed away at his home, 1153 Cowper
Avenue, Saturday evening. The direct
cause of his death has been attributed
to heart failure. While on his vaca
tion in Coronado this summer, he was
seriously ill, but recovered in time to
take up his duties with the opening of
college. He kept at his work until th-2
beginning of last week, and attended
classes Monday. It would be only a
slight exaggeration to say that he was
a victim of the European war, as there
is no doubt that his distress over the
situation added to his illness, and cer
tainly hastened bis death.
Professor Fluegel, who was of Ger
man stock and birth, was born at
Leipsig. August 4, 1863. When 23
years of age he received a degree of
Doctor of Philosophy. 188 C, at the Uni
versity of Leipsig. Four years later
he was a private docent there, lectur
ing on English literature and lan
guages, until he was finally called ro
Stanford in 1892. His profound schol
arship, abiPty as a teacher, and power
to inspire the enthusiasm of his sub
ject into his students made him espe
cially desirable as a member of the fac
ulty of this institution.
The greatest work of Doctor Fluegel,
which will stand permanent in the an
nals of literature, is the Chaucer Dic
tionary. upon which lie has labored a
quarter of a century, and as yet is onlv
a little more than half completed. The
tark has l een expanded from a plan
for a Chaucer's Concordance to the
scope of covering the contemporaries
and immediate predecessors of the old
English writer. It is a matter of doubt
if any author can He found to complete
this tremendous undertaking, which is
ready for printing in portions from A
nearly through H, requiring a wonder
ful scholarly mind and wide breadth
of view. Enough material has already
been compiled to form two volumes of
the size of Murray's great dictionary.
Professor Fluegel is a descendant of
an old German family of dictionary
makers. His private library is prob
ably unexcelled anywhere in the Un't
ed States in the field of old and Middle
English literature. He began the col
lection years ago in Leipsig and Lon
don, and acquired a vast number of
rare and costly books. He made an at
tempt to get behind Chaucer's mental
viewpoint, and so acquired books that
the old English poet might have read.
Professor Fluegel is survived by his
wife and four children. Felix Fluegel,
'14, Ewald Fluegel, Hildegarde Fluegel,
ex-'l3, and the youngest daughter, Hel
ena. Five members of the Faculty, who
have spent the last sixteen years as an
intimate friend of the deceased, pay
Doctor Fluegel's delightful, kindly and
winning personality, and his simple,
direct, and honest character fitting
tribute.
The funeral of Professor Fluegel
will be held at his residence, 1153
Cowper street, Palo Alto, at ten o'clock
Tuesday morning, November 17. All
forenoon classes of the Departments of
| English and English Philology are
| dismissed.
President Hranner extols Doctor
Fluegel's memory in the following
l'nes: "Professor Pluegel was one
of the leading scholars of the country;
he was a man of the highest ideals and
of the soundest principles; and he was
loved and respected by every one who
knew him personally. Hi • death is a
great and irreparable hiss to Stanford
University."
Professor S. S. Seward, of the
English Department, praises his lato
associate with the following: "Doctor
Fluegel's mind was one of singular
richness, fed by sincere enthusiasm in
many fields of letters and art. It was
a creation, too, in (he sense that it as
similated and vitalized its vast store of
learning, so that it has been said
perhaps with truth, that he was the
man best fitted in our day to read and
officiate medieval literature from the
standpoint of a contemporary. His
nature radiated enthusiasm. We have
never known the extent of his individu
al helpfulness, but that he was warm
hearted, generous. hospitable, and sin
cere, we know well, and shall remem
ber always."
P-ofessor K. G. Rendtorff, of the De

His many friends will miss his warm
heart and his cheerful disposition. His
life work came to an end when he was
in the prime of his powers. A few
years more, and he would have fin
ished his gigantic task, the Chaucer
Dictionary."
A tribute to Doctor Fluegel, as a
man, is summed up by Professor H. .T.
Hall, of the English Department: "He
radiated kindness and good cheer. His
presence was enough to bring sun
shine to the gloomiest situation. None
of his friends, not even his family,
knew of all his kindness to those who
needed help. Tt was not alone in the
little acts of courtesy which appeared
in every hour of his contact with oth
ers, but in matters that called for real
sacrifice that his life was filled. Every
one in need had a claim on his love."

years more, and he would have fin
ished his gigantic task, the Chaucer
Dictionary."
A tribute to Doctor Fluegel, as a
man, is summed up by Professor H. .T.
Hall, of the English Department: "He
radiated kindness and good cheer. His
presence was enough to bring sun
shine to the gloomiest situation. None
of his friends, not even his family,
knew of all his kindness to those who
needed help. Tt was not alone in the
little acts of courtesy which appeared
in every hour of his contact with oth
ers, but in matters that called for real
sacrifice that his life was filled. Every
one in need had a claim on his love."
Dr. Frank Angell, head of the Psy
chology Department, and life-long
friend of the deceased, voices his grief:
"It seems unbelievable and almost un
bearable that Fluegel is no longer
with us:—the ready sympathy, the
generous kindness, the eager helpful
ness towards those who would learn,
the profound scholarship, the pure and
lofty intellectual ideals, the frank
contempt for shams —all these quali
ties which, beyond the powers of any
other among us, have raised the aca
demic level and quickened our intel
lectual life, have passed away. That
the memory of these things will abide
with us is assuredly at present but
slight consolation to the University
acamed'c life at large; the present time
itself needed him, but he has passed
away in the flower of his intellectual
gifts, and we shall not look upon
his like again."
Ewald Fluegel, head of the depart
ment of English Philology, connected
with the University since 1592, the
year following the founding of Stan
ford, a world-renowned scholar in both
the field of languages and literature,
passed away at his home, 1153 Cowper
Avenue, Saturday evening. The direct
cause of his death has been attributed
to heart failure. While on his vaca
tion in Coronado this summer, he was
seriously ill, but recovered in time to
take up his duties with the opening of
college. He kept at his work until th-2
beginning of last week, and attended
classes Monday. It would be only a
slight exaggeration to say that he was
a victim of the European war, as there
is no doubt that his distress over the
situation added to his illness, and cer
tainly hastened bis death.
Professor Fluegel, who was of Ger
man stock and birth, was born at
Leipsig. August 4, 1863. When 23
years of age he received a degree of
Doctor of Philosophy. 188 C, at the Uni
versity of Leipsig. Four years later
he was a private docent there, lectur
ing on English literature and lan
guages, until he was finally called ro
Stanford in 1892. His profound schol
arship, abiPty as a teacher, and power
to inspire the enthusiasm of his sub
ject into his students made him espe
cially desirable as a member of the fac
ulty of this institution.
The greatest work of Doctor Fluegel,
which will stand permanent in the an
nals of literature, is the Chaucer Dic
tionary. upon which lie has labored a
quarter of a century, and as yet is onlv
a little more than half completed. The
tark has l een expanded from a plan
for a Chaucer's Concordance to the
scope of covering the contemporaries
and immediate predecessors of the old
English writer. It is a matter of doubt
if any author can He found to complete
this tremendous undertaking, which is
ready for printing in portions from A
nearly through H, requiring a wonder
ful scholarly mind and wide breadth
of view. Enough material has already
been compiled to form two volumes of
the size of Murray's great dictionary.
Professor Fluegel is a descendant of
an old German family of dictionary
makers. His private library is prob
ably unexcelled anywhere in the Un't
ed States in the field of old and Middle
English literature. He began the col
lection years ago in Leipsig and Lon
don, and acquired a vast number of
rare and costly books. He made an at
tempt to get behind Chaucer's mental
viewpoint, and so acquired books that
the old English poet might have read.
Professor Fluegel is survived by his
wife and four children. Felix Fluegel,
'14, Ewald Fluegel, Hildegarde Fluegel,
ex-'l3, and the youngest daughter, Hel
ena. Five members of the Faculty, who
have spent the last sixteen years as an
intimate friend of the deceased, pay
Doctor Fluegel's delightful, kindly and
winning personality, and his simple,
direct, and honest character fitting
tribute.
The funeral of Professor Fluegel
will be held at his residence, 1153
Cowper street, Palo Alto, at ten o'clock
Tuesday morning, November 17. All
forenoon classes of the Departments of
| English and English Philology are

President Hranner extols Doctor
Fluegel's memory in the following
l'nes: "Professor Pluegel was one
of the leading scholars of the country;
he was a man of the highest ideals and
of the soundest principles; and he was
loved and respected by every one who
knew him personally. Hi • death is a
great and irreparable hiss to Stanford
University."
Professor S. S. Seward, of the
English Department, praises his lato
associate with the following: "Doctor
Fluegel's mind was one of singular
richness, fed by sincere enthusiasm in
many fields of letters and art. It was
a creation, too, in (he sense that it as
similated and vitalized its vast store of
learning, so that it has been said
perhaps with truth, that he was the
man best fitted in our day to read and
officiate medieval literature from the
standpoint of a contemporary. His
nature radiated enthusiasm. We have
never known the extent of his individu
al helpfulness, but that he was warm
hearted, generous. hospitable, and sin
cere, we know well, and shall remem
ber always."
P-ofessor K. G. Rendtorff, of the De
partment of German, pays his respects
with the following appreciation: "In
