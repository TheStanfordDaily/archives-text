# WORRY OVER WORLD WAR STRIKES PROFESSOR EWALD FLUEGEL FROM ROLL
## HEART FAILURE IS CAUSE Faculty Associates Pay Tribute in Glowing Terms to the Late Head of Philology Department 
### 
Ewald Fluegel, head of the depart
ment of English Philology, connected
with the University since 1592, the
year following the founding of Stan
ford, a world-renowned scholar in both
the field of languages and literature,
passed away at his home, 1153 Cowper
Avenue, Saturday evening. The direct
cause of his death has been attributed
to heart failure. While on his vaca
tion in Coronado this summer, he was
seriously ill, but recovered in time to
take up his duties with the opening of
college. He kept at his work until th-2
beginning of last week, and attended
classes Monday. It would be only a
slight exaggeration to say that he was
a victim of the European war, as there
is no doubt that his distress over the
situation added to his illness, and cer
tainly hastened bis death.
Professor Fluegel, who was of Ger
man stock and birth, was born at
Leipsig. August 4, 1863. When 23
years of age he received a degree of
Doctor of Philosophy. 188 C, at the Uni
versity of Leipsig. Four years later
he was a private docent there, lectur
ing on English literature and lan
guages, until he was finally called ro
Stanford in 1892. His profound schol
arship, abiPty as a teacher, and power
to inspire the enthusiasm of his sub
ject into his students made him espe
cially desirable as a member of the fac
ulty of this institution.
The greatest work of Doctor Fluegel,
which will stand permanent in the an
nals of literature, is the Chaucer Dic
tionary. upon which lie has labored a
quarter of a century, and as yet is onlv
a little more than half completed. The
tark has l een expanded from a plan
for a Chaucer's Concordance to the
scope of covering the contemporaries
and immediate predecessors of the old
English writer. It is a matter of doubt
if any author can He found to complete
this tremendous undertaking, which is
ready for printing in portions from A
nearly through H, requiring a wonder
ful scholarly mind and wide breadth
of view. Enough material has already
been compiled to form two volumes of
the size of Murray's great dictionary.
Professor Fluegel is a descendant of
an old German family of dictionary
makers. His private library is prob
ably unexcelled anywhere in the Un't
ed States in the field of old and Middle
English literature. He began the col
lection years ago in Leipsig and Lon
don, and acquired a vast number of
rare and costly books. He made an at
tempt to get behind Chaucer's mental
viewpoint, and so acquired books that
the old English poet might have read.
Professor Fluegel is survived by his
wife and four children. Felix Fluegel,
'14, Ewald Fluegel, Hildegarde Fluegel,
ex-'l3, and the youngest daughter, Hel
ena. Five members of the Faculty, who
have spent the last sixteen years as an
intimate friend of the deceased, pay
Doctor Fluegel's delightful, kindly and
winning personality, and his simple,
direct, and honest character fitting
tribute.
The funeral of Professor Fluegel
will be held at his residence, 1153
Cowper street, Palo Alto, at ten o'clock
Tuesday morning, November 17. All
forenoon classes of the Departments of
