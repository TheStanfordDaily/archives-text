# The 						Magic Light

### 
Marion Stanley, a contemporary poet
of rising note, has published the fol
lowing poem in Everybody's Magazine:
Oh. long ago, a child that dreamed,
I viewed with wondering eyes
Life's far ascend'ng path that seemed
To lead into the skies.
Then every peak did beckon fair
With rainbow color kissed
And eve.ry way that wandered there
Was hid in rosy mist.
Now on the height I stand and view
Dun field and mountain bare.
Where is the magic light I knew?
The golden vision, where?
Here on a mountain's barren brow
I pause with beckoning gaze.
Lo, all the vale of childhood now
Is hid in rosy haze.
