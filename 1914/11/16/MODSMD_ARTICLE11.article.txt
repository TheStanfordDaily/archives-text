Par's, Nov. If.,â€”Five miles have been
added to the flooded district near Dix
mnde, in Belgium. The water now ex
tends to the south of Dixmude, within
three miles of Bixschoote and Forest I
Tiouthulste. A German .regiment is
said to have been drowned near Bix
schoote. The recession of the waters
enabled the Teutons to renew their at
tack on Dixmude last week, and they
are reinforcing here again. They have
wrecked many towns in this district,
and have been trying to regain a fooi
hold on the left bank of the Yser, but
have been repulsed to the right bank,
and are losing heavily there. The bat
tle is most terrific to the south of Dix
mude, in the woods near Bixschoote.
The trenches of both sides are full of
water as a result of a rain and gale
sweeping the coast. The weather pre
vents infantry assaults, and for the
past twenty-four hours heavy artillery
duelling has been taking place. The
flood has temporarily stopped the Ger
man advance on the coast towns.
