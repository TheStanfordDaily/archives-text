### 
Chicago. Nov. 16.â€”The stockyards
have .re-opened. Only seven thousand
cattle were received, which is but a
third of the usual Monday run; but it
is expected that that the market will
soon reach its normal condition.
The price of cattle is only ten cents
higher than it was when the yards
closed, November 6. Hogs range from
forty to fifty cents higher.
Connecticut and Montana have been
quarantined on account of the foot and
mouth disease. This brings the num
ber of quarantined states up to sixteen.
