When Saturday came I was sure we'd
win,
By the way that things came around, —
p]von the big yellow "C' was read,
From anywhere on Berkeley ground.
The girl 1 took had auburn hair, —
Gee, her line of talk was witty.
And T might mention the coincidence, —
She came from Redwood City.
Berkeley's bear was a cinnamon bear,
His shaggy fur was red.
But the critter was feeling grizzly
When they laid him in his bed.
I saw a fight—two Berkeley studes —
There were well delivered blows,
And the blood ran right redily
' Whenever fist met nose.
I heard the Californi say:
"The Blue and Gold is redd.v
And will meet Stanford at least half
way."—
Now that remark was heady,
For Stanford was but halfway met.
And before the half was gone.
The big blue bleacher "C"
Looked Tke a giant block "S."
And 1 heard a sweet swan song.
