# "DAD" MERCER MERCER WHEN AUTO STRIKES BICYCLE
## 
### 
"Dad' Mercer, best known as cam
pus cop, was thrown from his bicycle
and run over as a result of a collision
early Saturday morning on lower
Lasuen with a delivery automobile be
longing to the Emporium in San Fran
e'sco. Mercer was not seriously in
jured. and, aside from a badly bruised
leg. is back at work as efficient as
ever. The accident was the result of
too much speedâ€”not on "Dad's" part,
but on account of an automobile con
taining Assistant Registrar J. E. Mc-
Dowell. who was trying to make a
train for New York. "Dad" maintains
the car was coming down Lasuen
a'>out forty miles an hour, and when
forced to turn out to avoid a carriage,
encountered the Emporium machine
coming from the opposite direction.
The latter vehicle, ot avoid a collision,
i turned off the road and in so doing
| struck the bicycle on which Mercer
was riding.
