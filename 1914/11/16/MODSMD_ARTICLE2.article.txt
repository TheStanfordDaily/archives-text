### 
Twenty-six to eight was the amount
of the victory of Stanford over Califor
nia in the twenty-fourth game of inter
collegiate football. That much for the
aid of future gatherers of statistics.
The present generation remembers the
struggle 011 California Field in all its
thrills and heroism. Even the lesser
mortals of the Stanford world smile in
the reflected glory of the Varsity.
The game was a wonderful display
of Rugby skill by both teams through
all the eighty minutes, and the best
team won. Play was tight, and the
tries were well earned. The Cardinal
backfield catapulted through the yard
marks, as it was expected to do, de
spite the great effort of the opponents.
Individual stars sprang into being in
many displays of speed, nerve, and ac
curacy.
Reliance of California's backfield
on side-kicks out of difficulty was un
availing, and soon discontinued. Hon
ors in the kicking duels between Bo
gardus and Montgomery, of California,
and Andrews and Austin were well
portioned.
Up in the forward division, the fond
est hopes of the bleachers were left
far behind the wake of actual achieve
ment. The scrum was generally expect
ed to bend like a willow branch before
the Berkeley onslaught. The pack,
however, held in an even break with
Captain McKim's fighting forwards In
the scrums, outclassed them in the
loose dribbling, and slaughtered them
in the lineouts.
The sidelines are too prone to r : se to
i tbei.r feet when the ball gets into the
I hands of the backs, and date the pro-
I gress of scores from that time. Had
j the turf been a mirror, which would
I have shown the heart-rending fight
which is fought between the sixteen
; locked scrummers before the ball ever
I starts its journey to the backs, the
spectators would realize less vaguely
that the whole Stanford team won Sat
| urday's battle.
California proved a monstrous re
sistance. Her ruggers fought every
I inch of the turf, stretched Stanford
j to her linrt and died fighting. No one
! can pick a moment which indicates
I any letup in the spirit of the van
quished. The game was won by su
perior knowledge of the game, and
| veteran experience. The Blue and
Cold novices faced perhaps the most
I powerful rugby combination which ha:?
I ever represented Stanford.
California Pack Opens Klronir.
The flight of California's forwards
toward the Stanford l'ne in the fir-t

fornia's 40, ending the half with a
score of 10-5.
Fven Play Opens Second Half.
The California forwards had recov
ered their bearings at the end of the
first half, and there was reason to feav
that they would enter the game after a
fifteen-minute rest, imbued with a de
termination which might offset their
handicap. The determination was pres
ent, but their ability to stave off the
Cardinal onslaught was lacking from
the first formation.

off by a breaking run through the for
ward defense for a thirty-yard gain,

rushing backfield and touched Califor
nia's 25 as Bogardus closed on him.

struggle 011 California Field in all its
thrills and heroism. Even the lesser
mortals of the Stanford world smile in
the reflected glory of the Varsity.
The game was a wonderful display
of Rugby skill by both teams through
all the eighty minutes, and the best
team won. Play was tight, and the
tries were well earned. The Cardinal
backfield catapulted through the yard
marks, as it was expected to do, de
spite the great effort of the opponents.
Individual stars sprang into being in
many displays of speed, nerve, and ac
curacy.
Reliance of California's backfield
on side-kicks out of difficulty was un
availing, and soon discontinued. Hon
ors in the kicking duels between Bo
gardus and Montgomery, of California,
and Andrews and Austin were well
portioned.
Up in the forward division, the fond
est hopes of the bleachers were left
far behind the wake of actual achieve
ment. The scrum was generally expect
ed to bend like a willow branch before
the Berkeley onslaught. The pack,
however, held in an even break with
Captain McKim's fighting forwards In
the scrums, outclassed them in the
loose dribbling, and slaughtered them
in the lineouts.

i tbei.r feet when the ball gets into the
I hands of the backs, and date the pro-

that the whole Stanford team won Sat

California proved a monstrous re

j to her linrt and died fighting. No one
! can pick a moment which indicates

I powerful rugby combination which ha:?
I ever represented Stanford.
California Pack Opens Klronir.
The flight of California's forwards
toward the Stanford l'ne in the fir-t
five minutes threatened a sad begin
ning. Erb's kick-off at 2:10 was re

the 25-yard mark. A dribbling ad
vance on the line sent the ball across,

between the goal posts. Austin con
verted, Erb holding. Score 10-0.
The absence of Canfield during the
remainder of the game, because of in
ability to work his weak ankle, crip
pled the California backfield sadly.
Brooks was moved from center to sec
ond five to replace Canfield. and
j Sharpe took the position at center.
Andrews and Bogardus carried on a
punting duel after the kickoff, in
which the Stanford back won credit by
finding touch at Stanford 40. after

fornia's 40, ending the half with a
score of 10-5.
Fven Play Opens Second Half.
The California forwards had recov
ered their bearings at the end of the
first half, and there was reason to feav
that they would enter the game after a
fifteen-minute rest, imbued with a de
termination which might offset their
handicap. The determination was pres
ent, but their ability to stave off the
Cardinal onslaught was lacking from
the first formation.
Austin followed Montgomery's kick
off by a breaking run through the for
ward defense for a thirty-yard gain,

rushing backfield and touched Califor
nia's 25 as Bogardus closed on him.

Reliance of California's backfield
on side-kicks out of difficulty was un
availing, and soon discontinued. Hon
ors in the kicking duels between Bo
gardus and Montgomery, of California,
and Andrews and Austin were well
portioned.
Up in the forward division, the fond
est hopes of the bleachers were left
far behind the wake of actual achieve

ed to bend like a willow branch before
the Berkeley onslaught. The pack,
however, held in an even break with
Captain McKim's fighting forwards In
the scrums, outclassed them in the
loose dribbling, and slaughtered them
in the lineouts.

between the goal posts. Austin con
verted, Erb holding. Score 10-0.
The absence of Canfield during the
remainder of the game, because of in
ability to work his weak ankle, crip
pled the California backfield sadly.
Brooks was moved from center to sec
ond five to replace Canfield. and
j Sharpe took the position at center.
Andrews and Bogardus carried on a
punting duel after the kickoff, in
which the Stanford back won credit by

fornia's 40, ending the half with a
score of 10-5.
Fven Play Opens Second Half.
The California forwards had recov
ered their bearings at the end of the
first half, and there was reason to feav
that they would enter the game after a
fifteen-minute rest, imbued with a de
termination which might offset their
handicap. The determination was pres
ent, but their ability to stave off the
Cardinal onslaught was lacking from
the first formation.

Fven Play Opens Second Half.
The California forwards had recov
ered their bearings at the end of the
first half, and there was reason to feav
that they would enter the game after a
fifteen-minute rest, imbued with a de
termination which might offset their
handicap. The determination was pres
ent, but their ability to stave off the
Cardinal onslaught was lacking from
the first formation.

tries were well earned. The Cardinal
backfield catapulted through the yard
marks, as it was expected to do, de
spite the great effort of the opponents.
Individual stars sprang into being in
many displays of speed, nerve, and ac
curacy.
Reliance of California's backfield
on side-kicks out of difficulty was un
availing, and soon discontinued. Hon

Up in the forward division, the fond

Fven Play Opens Second Half.
The California forwards had recov
ered their bearings at the end of the
first half, and there was reason to feav
that they would enter the game after a
fifteen-minute rest, imbued with a de
termination which might offset their
handicap. The determination was pres
ent, but their ability to stave off the
Cardinal onslaught was lacking from
the first formation.

marks, as it was expected to do, de
spite the great effort of the opponents.
Individual stars sprang into being in
many displays of speed, nerve, and ac
curacy.
Reliance of California's backfield
on side-kicks out of difficulty was un
availing, and soon discontinued. Hon
ors in the kicking duels between Bo
gardus and Montgomery, of California,
and Andrews and Austin were well
portioned.
Up in the forward division, the fond
est hopes of the bleachers were left
far behind the wake of actual achieve
ment. The scrum was generally expect
ed to bend like a willow branch before
the Berkeley onslaught. The pack,
however, held in an even break with
Captain McKim's fighting forwards In

loose dribbling, and slaughtered them
in the lineouts.

Fven Play Opens Second Half.
The California forwards had recov
ered their bearings at the end of the
first half, and there was reason to feav
that they would enter the game after a
fifteen-minute rest, imbued with a de
termination which might offset their
handicap. The determination was pres
ent, but their ability to stave off the
Cardinal onslaught was lacking from
the first formation.

mortals of the Stanford world smile in
the reflected glory of the Varsity.
The game was a wonderful display
of Rugby skill by both teams through
all the eighty minutes, and the best
team won. Play was tight, and the
tries were well earned. The Cardinal
backfield catapulted through the yard
marks, as it was expected to do, de
spite the great effort of the opponents.
Individual stars sprang into being in
many displays of speed, nerve, and ac
curacy.
Reliance of California's backfield
on side-kicks out of difficulty was un
availing, and soon discontinued. Hon
ors in the kicking duels between Bo
gardus and Montgomery, of California,
and Andrews and Austin were well
portioned.
Up in the forward division, the fond
est hopes of the bleachers were left
far behind the wake of actual achieve
ment. The scrum was generally expect
ed to bend like a willow branch before
the Berkeley onslaught. The pack,
however, held in an even break with
Captain McKim's fighting forwards In
the scrums, outclassed them in the
loose dribbling, and slaughtered them
in the lineouts.

Fven Play Opens Second Half.
The California forwards had recov
ered their bearings at the end of the
first half, and there was reason to feav
that they would enter the game after a
fifteen-minute rest, imbued with a de
termination which might offset their

Twenty-six to eight was the amount
of the victory of Stanford over Califor
nia in the twenty-fourth game of inter
collegiate football. That much for the
aid of future gatherers of statistics.
The present generation remembers the
struggle 011 California Field in all its
thrills and heroism. Even the lesser
mortals of the Stanford world smile in
the reflected glory of the Varsity.
The game was a wonderful display
of Rugby skill by both teams through
all the eighty minutes, and the best
team won. Play was tight, and the
tries were well earned. The Cardinal
backfield catapulted through the yard
marks, as it was expected to do, de
spite the great effort of the opponents.
Individual stars sprang into being in
many displays of speed, nerve, and ac
curacy.
Reliance of California's backfield
on side-kicks out of difficulty was un
availing, and soon discontinued. Hon
ors in the kicking duels between Bo
gardus and Montgomery, of California,
and Andrews and Austin were well
portioned.
Up in the forward division, the fond
est hopes of the bleachers were left
far behind the wake of actual achieve
ment. The scrum was generally expect
ed to bend like a willow branch before
the Berkeley onslaught. The pack,
however, held in an even break with
Captain McKim's fighting forwards In
the scrums, outclassed them in the
loose dribbling, and slaughtered them
in the lineouts.
The sidelines are too prone to r : se to
i tbei.r feet when the ball gets into the
I hands of the backs, and date the pro-
I gress of scores from that time. Had
j the turf been a mirror, which would
I have shown the heart-rending fight
which is fought between the sixteen
; locked scrummers before the ball ever
I starts its journey to the backs, the
spectators would realize less vaguely
that the whole Stanford team won Sat
| urday's battle.
California proved a monstrous re
sistance. Her ruggers fought every
I inch of the turf, stretched Stanford
j to her linrt and died fighting. No one
! can pick a moment which indicates
I any letup in the spirit of the van
quished. The game was won by su
perior knowledge of the game, and
| veteran experience. The Blue and
Cold novices faced perhaps the most
I powerful rugby combination which ha:?
I ever represented Stanford.
California Pack Opens Klronir.
The flight of California's forwards
toward the Stanford l'ne in the fir-t
five minutes threatened a sad begin
ning. Erb's kick-off at 2:10 was re

the 25-yard mark. A dribbling ad
vance on the line sent the ball across,
