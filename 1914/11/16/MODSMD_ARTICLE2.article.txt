### 
Twenty-six to eight was the amount
of the victory of Stanford over Califor
nia in the twenty-fourth game of inter
collegiate football. That much for the
aid of future gatherers of statistics.
The present generation remembers the
struggle 011 California Field in all its
thrills and heroism. Even the lesser
mortals of the Stanford world smile in
the reflected glory of the Varsity.
The game was a wonderful display
of Rugby skill by both teams through
all the eighty minutes, and the best
team won. Play was tight, and the
tries were well earned. The Cardinal
backfield catapulted through the yard
marks, as it was expected to do, de
spite the great effort of the opponents.
Individual stars sprang into being in
many displays of speed, nerve, and ac
curacy.
Reliance of California's backfield
on side-kicks out of difficulty was un
availing, and soon discontinued. Hon
ors in the kicking duels between Bo
gardus and Montgomery, of California,
and Andrews and Austin were well
portioned.
Up in the forward division, the fond
est hopes of the bleachers were left
far behind the wake of actual achieve
ment. The scrum was generally expect
ed to bend like a willow branch before
the Berkeley onslaught. The pack,
however, held in an even break with
Captain McKim's fighting forwards In
the scrums, outclassed them in the
loose dribbling, and slaughtered them
in the lineouts.
The sidelines are too prone to r : se to
i tbei.r feet when the ball gets into the
I hands of the backs, and date the pro-
I gress of scores from that time. Had
j the turf been a mirror, which would
I have shown the heart-rending fight
which is fought between the sixteen
; locked scrummers before the ball ever
I starts its journey to the backs, the
spectators would realize less vaguely
that the whole Stanford team won Sat
| urday's battle.
California proved a monstrous re
sistance. Her ruggers fought every
I inch of the turf, stretched Stanford
j to her linrt and died fighting. No one
! can pick a moment which indicates
I any letup in the spirit of the van
quished. The game was won by su
perior knowledge of the game, and
| veteran experience. The Blue and
Cold novices faced perhaps the most
I powerful rugby combination which ha:?
I ever represented Stanford.
California Pack Opens Klronir.
The flight of California's forwards
toward the Stanford l'ne in the fir-t
five minutes threatened a sad begin
ning. Erb's kick-off at 2:10 was re
i turned to a touch at center by Bo
gardus. The second long boot touched
the 25-yard mark. A dribbling ad
vance on the line sent the ball across,
' and Andrews made a lucky save. Sue
j cessive five-yard scrums first proved
| the temper of the Stanford pack, while
I the California rooters clamored for a
score. Urban received from the bee'
i ers and started a backfield dribble
which ended in a 35-yard scrum.

the forward battling. Card kicker

spurt, who released to Erb on the 15- ,
yard line for a trip across, which was |
disqualified because of off-side eager
ness. Bogardus, the California full
back, was out of the game for a min
ute after tackling Erb on the line.
Following California's kickout,
Reeves scooped the bail on the enemy's
20, passing to Pettingill, who touched
the 15-yard line. Lachmund and
Reeves had hands on the ball for short
gains in the succeeding play.
