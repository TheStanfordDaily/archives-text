# VARSITY NINE STANDS OFF COMEBACK OF VARSITY
## 
### 
Captain Tom Workman's baseball
baseball warriors succeeded in with
standing the "comeback" attack of the
Alumni team, sending them retreating
from the varsity diamond with the
short end of a 7-2 score last Friday
afternoon.
Though Zeb Terry, of the Alumni
nine, lined out a clean home run, his
stars and former stars were only able
to round the diamond twice.
The Varsity sluggers hit the pill
hard and often, piling up seven tallies.
The batteries were Couch and Land
ers for the Alumni, and Hoever, Hays,
and Dent for the Stanford "pick-ups."
