# BEACHEY FLIES CARDINAL
## UNEXPECTED FLIGHT BIGGEST BLEACHER STUNT. Effect of Shifting Blue and Gold Mosaics Is Surprise From California Side.

Blue and Gold on the Campanile.
Cardinal in the clomls, was the order
of events on Saturday when Lincoln
Beachey put the Stanford colors over
the three-hund,red-foot-high banner of
gold and blue before the teams went on
the field.
Thrills were running wild at Berke
ley on Saturday, but the headline gasp
getter of the hour was Beachey's Car
dinal swoop from the sky. Just be
fore time for the turf armies to open
fire, a cry of "Beachey" from the Cal
ifornia rooters, turned all eyes to the
west, where the game little aviator's
machine could be seen headed straight
for the field. As the whirring omen of
Stanford's win drew near, the roar of
greeting rose from the Cardinal side
of the field, for the under planes of
Beachey's flier flashed .red and white
in the sun. High above the oft-painted
"C" on the hill he fleAv, and swerving,
placed above it the curves of a mighty
"S." Four times the Cardinal-clad
aviator looped the loop, the sunlight
glinting on the scarlet planes of his
machine. Then, with a farewell wave,
"Mr. Beachey, of Stanford," sped away
in the direction whence he came, to re
turn to greet the bleachers between the
periods of play. An extra bolt from
the blue for the California supporters
was the Cardinal-covered football
which Beachey hurled into their midst.
On the bleachers proper, surprises
were again the order of the day. Cali
fornia had the epitome of organized
rooting in a hoarse machine that
howled to order. Two small bears â€”
not goldpn. but still bears, tugged at
blue and gold leashes just below the
California rooting section. Pigeons
with fluttering gold and blue stream
ers flew over the bleachers. Beachevs
in miniature.
But the crownine: surprise planned
bv California was the shifting gold and
Hue of the huge "C," which trans
formed the rootine section into a sheet
of livine mosaic, with gold melting into
blue and blue into gold, to the swing
ins: strains of the "Lights Out" march.
On the Stanford side of the bleachers
a feature wh'ch made the rival rooters
,T asp for a moment was the mournful
dirge-music of "California's Burial
Song." The wailing notes poured
across the field as the thousand red
clad rooters stood bareheaded, led in
the singinc by three coweld, black
robed monkish figures with huge red
megaphones.
But the bleacher stunts fade into
vague memories beside the final scar
let sweep of the serpentine. Scarcely
had the final whistle sounded before
the jubilant, red-hatted rooters were
dropping from the bleachers to swing
into the bobbing serpentine that wound
over the turf past the board which
read Stanford 2fi, California 8.
