# CARDINAL SOCCER TEAM DISCREDITS DOPE IN FAVOR OF BLUE AND GOLD
## STANFORD WINS 2-0 GAME Captain Blodget Shares Honor of Scoring With Higgins, Captain of Eleven Last Year 
### 
Turning a doped-out California vic
tory into a fast 2 to 0 win for the Car
dinal, the Stanford soccer team made
the preliminary arrangements for the
Blue and Gold funeral of Saturday. A
large crowd witnessed the soccer hat
tie which was to add one more tally
to the unbroken string of Stanford
victories at the English game.
Although figures gave the showing
of the rival colleges in the soccer pre
liminaries as about evenly matched,
California was generally acceded the
edge in the intercollegiate test. But
the veteran Blue and Gold team was
forced to bow before the aggressive
and accurate play of the red-jerseyed
eleven. The California men played a
fast game, giving the Stanford backs
many a rush to block, but their shots
for goal lacked the finish and pre
cision shown by the Cardinal forces.
In the first period Stanford was kept
almost continually on the defensive,
the Cardinal backs doing brilliant de
fensive work. After a few minutes*
play Blodgett passed to Higgins, who
dribbled the ball down the field and
s-hot past Shafer into the net for Stan
ford's first score. The rest of the
first half was an even thing, Blodgett
and Higgins menacing the California
goal with several brilliant shots. At
goal Ring showed up in splendid shape
with his cool saves for the Cardinal.
The second half found Stanford tak
ing the offensive more successfully
than before. A fine dribbling rush
started by Dutton resulted in Staf
ford's second tally. Dutton made a
long pass to Blodgett. who shot a neat
goal through the California backfield
defense.
The Stanford eleven played a con
sistent game throughout, with occa
sional bursts of meteoric brilliancy.
Ex-Captain Higgins, who shared the
scoring honors of the day with Captain
Blodgett, played a clever game, his ac
curate booting at critical moments
being one of the features of the match.
Blodgett proved himself a Icade.r in
every sense of the word. His dash and
ab'lity set the pace for his men and
won the applause of the bleachers.
Kyle and Shaw played fast soccer on
the wings, both in attack and defense.
Boyle, who appeared at center half
In the Cardinal line-up, showed him
self to be an aggressive and depend
able player. Time and avrain he
stopped the Blue and Gold attack clev
erly and effectively.
Dutton and Adams, at fullback, dis
played strong defensive work. Button
showed more aucressiveness than his
team-mate, but Adams' boot has a
sureness and precision of which a
more experienced player might well be
proud.
For the Blue and Gold, McKinley,
Harding, and Captain Kellas showed
the best form. McKinley, California's
speedy wing, put the Cardinal goal in
danger more than once. Harding, who
appears in the Blue and Gold ranks
for the first time, proved himself a
man worth watching. He is a fast
player, especially adept at carrying a
dribbling .rush past the most deter
mined defense. J. Mackenzie, of the
Barbarian Club, refereed the game.
The teams lined up as follows:
Stanford—Forwards, Kyle, S. Adams,
Blodgett, Higgins, Shaw; half-backs,
Cass, Boyle, Vanderburg; full-backs, .T.
Adams. Button; goal-keeper. Ring.
