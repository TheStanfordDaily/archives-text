# To Victory With the Cardinal
## 
### 
There is a Cardinal dye 011 Califor
nia's new green ) Ul f w m spread a
baptismal stain hard to eradicate —on
Saturday two Stanford teams played
to decisive victory and left the treading
in of the color to the first red-hatted
serpentine on foreign football field
since the game of 1908. Eighteen rug
by players emblazoned their names 011
the honor roll of Stanford's rugby his
tory, and the 1914 Varsity will take its
place with the best of the bye-gone
athletic groups.
The soccer eleven played as Stan
ford men can be expected to play and
won an uphill fight, upsetting the pre
dictions of the pre-game dopesters.
in the glamour of a glorious day, it
is easy to forget the real import of so
perfect a match, unmarred by playing
that smacked of pugilism and its bril
liancy undimmed by post-game con
troversy. The rooting sections led the
way, the Blue and Gold bleacherites
showing 110 partiality in cheering in
jured men, and at all times playing
the role of friendly rivals. This appre
ciation by both sides of the never
down-and-always-coming opponents is
not a new note in intercollegiate rela
tions, yet the tone was clearer and
more genuine on Saturday than ever
before. The contest was sane, des
tined to make history that will not be
forgotten.
California's team was of that hard
fighting, never-dying type that gains
the respect of all adversaries—Stan
ford played as strongly and had the
edge in skill, speed, and teamwork.
The victory was for the Cardinal, and
rightly so.
To Coach Floyd Brown, to Trainer
Maloney and to the other players who
made such a peerless fifteen possible,
should go the appreciation which every
Stanford man holds for those who
work unselfishly for their Alma Mater.
