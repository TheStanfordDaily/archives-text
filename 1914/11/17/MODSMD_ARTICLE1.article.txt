Few comedies of recent years have
been so carefully and neatly arranged
as "Ready Money," in which James
Montgomery, the actor-author, has

achieved an international success. The
play was recently being produced in
diflere.it coiu.tr es, in addition to
the American and English versions,
which have been remarkable successes,
illustrating the universal appeal of tha
"money mad" theme.
"Ready Money" tells a novel story of
a ycung mine owner, "Stephen Baird'
(F. it. Johnston. '17,) who on New
Year's eve has just twenty-five cents in
ready cash. He is about to lose his
mine for the want of money to meet a
large payment on a mortgage against
the strong opposition of a haughty and
worldly mother (Miss Grace Seward,
'17.) when his sweetheart, "Grace Ty
ler," (Miss Esther Liversidge, '17.)
proves by her loyalty what faith may
mean to a man.
"Jackson Ives" (F. C. McColloch,
'17,) a counterfeiter and polished man
of the world, comes to Stephen's res
cue with a hazardous scneme, which
leads to many dramatic thrills and
comedy surprises, alternating in a
manner which stamps this play a melo
dramatic farce rathe,r than a straight
comedy.
While the fascination of financial
risk forms the main theme of the play
the love interest is by no means insig
nificant. F. R. Johnston and Miss Liv
ersidge have several delightful scenes,
in which romance triumphs over finan
cial stress. J. I). McLachlan, '17, and
Miss Maybelle Peck, '17. will have
many opportunities to portray the ju
venile charm of "Ida Tyler" and "Wil
liam Stewart." respectively. R. L.
Johnston, '17, and Miss Beatrice Rus
sell, '17, will be equally prominent in
tangling the threads of romance as
"Margaret Elliott" and "Sidney Robin
son.' The wedded bliss of the Tyler
parents, portrayed with rare comedy
finesse and unction by Miss Grace Sew


F. 1L Johnston ;iih[ Miss Esther Liver
sidge in "Heady Money."
ard, '17, and M. E. Tedford, '17. is quite
another phase of love interest.
L. W. McDermott, '17, and H. M.
Stanley. '17. will appear to decide:!
advantage as "Sam Welch," a million
aire's son, and "Samuel Holbrook," a
young broker of New York. F. C. Mc-
Colloch is cast in a congenial role as
"Jackson T ves," the senio.r lead, while
E. H. Evans, '17, will interpret "Old
Morgan," a financial magnate. L. P.
Frank, '17, will portray the faithful
"Neil" and J. C. Cross, '17. is cast r;s
"Paul,' an ambitious maitre d'hotel. TJ .
V. Adams, '17, will romp through the
part of "Reddy,' the office boy, and I'.
L. Williams. '17, W. E. Licking. '17, J.
S. Higley, '17, and 11. M. Jones, '17, will
appear as United States secret service
men.
The entire cast is now letter-perfect,
and Coach F. L. Mathieu has called Â«
final dress rehearsal for tomorrow ev
ening.
