# International Rugby
## 
### 
The clinching argument in the case
of rugby versus public condemnation
of intercollegiate sport is the very
general participation in this state in
the English type of gameâ€”a telling
point at the close of the 1914 season
is the international game scheduled
for Saturday next. The thirty players
picked to wear the national colors, and
their substitutes, are the best expo
nents of the game in this section of
the continent, and Stanford is proud
to have her colors carried into such a
contest. The players named for the
first lineup are a credit to the athletic
prowess of the University, and can be
depended upon to maintain the high
standard of sportsmanship under the
Cardinal.
