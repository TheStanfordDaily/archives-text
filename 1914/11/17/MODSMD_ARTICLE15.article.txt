What of the Football Show?
Unless the 1915 intercollegiate be
staged on Exposition soil, as a part of
the entertainment afforded by hos
pitable California to the visiting
throngs, the problem of providing a
suitable Football Show, to be staged
off the campus, is not one that will
have to be faced before the 1917 class
become Seniors.
Yet the blow struck before the iron
is cooled is most effective —it should
be a matter of record that the last
Football Show was a failure, and as
such, was proof of the uselessness of
the institution. The hour's noise for
a dollar was expensive entertainment;
as a professional exhibition it lacked
the first essentials, as a rally it was a
poor outlet for pent-up enthusiasm.
Sentiment at California is against
continuance of this type of formal
post-game gatherings, and if the show
is to live a new type must be evolved.
While the Cardinal Football Show,
staged by professionals, has been a bi
ennial affair, the same situation ob
tains here—the show is bound for the
firing line. We wish it God-speed, and
hasten to give the enemy the range.
