Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The chip is on my shoulder for the
accommodation of the student, such as
he is, who finds amusement for him
self and invites derision from others
in the bigoted absurdities recently pub
lished in the Daily, having for their
subject the question of tennis as a
major sport.
There is something infinitely con
temptible in their tone and spirit, and
so perhaps should be merely passed
by; but it is a duty to make an objec
tion so that the degenerate philoso
phy may by no means be regarded as
an expression of universal Stanford
sentiment. In order to p.rove at the
outset that I am speaking against this
inordinate small-mindedness, and not
in debate of the tennis question, I
must admit that I am not in favor of
qualifying tennis for a major sport. It
irks me, however, to agree in the
smallest measure with this feeble
spirit. If this shallow-thinking mem
ber of our community cannot praise
one sport, without the disparagement
of another, I would suggest that he
cease his commentaries altogether.
Any comparison between spo.rts is
irrelevant, and distinctly inapt. Foot
ball needs no praise, no mention; our
first, venerable, glorious college activ
ity, it stands alone, and it will remain
appreciated and lauded above all oth
er sports with us, as long as our Stan
ford Spirit lives and is the powerful
force it is today. On purpose I do not
discuss the question of the advisabili
ty of making tennis a major sport;
many fine words have been said touch
ing this subject already, on both sides:
this not including the ridiculous and
blatant squall of my potential pot
boiler. Football combines skill with
brawn; tennis is skill without the
brawn,
I am protesting against the rambling
and chattering compilation "full of
sound and signifying nothing" (T pur
posely omit the "fury"), uncalled for,
disrespectful to the tastes of many (
students, and anonymous. Let my
worthless and unknown friend stand
meekly in the shadow of men of
brawn, virility, craft, and stamina,
like Wilding, Larned, Parke, our own
peerless McLoughlin, and our very
own master of efficiency, Lin Murray,
and gasp, and wonder.
Tastes differ; and it does not be
hoove us to thrust ours upon him
who does not care for it. The work
of an anonymous meddler, illustrative
of bigotry, busy-ness, and a petty
spirit.—the author may well be proud
of it.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The chip is on my shoulder for the
accommodation of the student, such as
he is, who finds amusement for him
self and invites derision from others
in the bigoted absurdities recently pub
lished in the Daily, having for their
subject the question of tennis as a
major sport.
There is something infinitely con
temptible in their tone and spirit, and
so perhaps should be merely passed
by; but it is a duty to make an objec
tion so that the degenerate philoso
phy may by no means be regarded as
an expression of universal Stanford
sentiment. In order to p.rove at the
outset that I am speaking against this
inordinate small-mindedness, and not
in debate of the tennis question, I
must admit that I am not in favor of
qualifying tennis for a major sport. It
irks me, however, to agree in the
smallest measure with this feeble
spirit. If this shallow-thinking mem
ber of our community cannot praise
one sport, without the disparagement
of another, I would suggest that he
cease his commentaries altogether.
Any comparison between spo.rts is
irrelevant, and distinctly inapt. Foot
ball needs no praise, no mention; our
first, venerable, glorious college activ
ity, it stands alone, and it will remain
appreciated and lauded above all oth
er sports with us, as long as our Stan
ford Spirit lives and is the powerful
force it is today. On purpose I do not
discuss the question of the advisabili
ty of making tennis a major sport;
many fine words have been said touch
ing this subject already, on both sides:
this not including the ridiculous and
blatant squall of my potential pot
boiler. Football combines skill with
brawn; tennis is skill without the
brawn,
I am protesting against the rambling
and chattering compilation "full of
sound and signifying nothing" (T pur
posely omit the "fury"), uncalled for,
disrespectful to the tastes of many (
students, and anonymous. Let my
worthless and unknown friend stand
meekly in the shadow of men of
brawn, virility, craft, and stamina,
