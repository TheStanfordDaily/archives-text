# CHAPARRAL AND PELICAN WILL EXCHANGE STAFFS
## Issue of California Paper to Be Published by Stanford Writers and Vice Versa. 
### 
M. A. Hagen, '15, of the Chaparral,
and F.red Foust, '15, editor of the Peli
can. a publication of the students of
the University of California, agreed
Saturday to an exchange of staffs for
a s : .ngle issue of the two papers.
The plan, as it stands, provides for
the publication of a "Chaparral Edition
of the Pelican on tlie Stanford campus
and a "Pelican Edition of the Chapar
ral" at the University of California.
The former will, in size and general
contents, closely resemble a regular
edition of the "Chappie," the main dif
ference being that the material will be
handled by the staff of the California
paper. The "Pelican Edition of the
Chaparral" will be published in the
same way by the Stanford men.
Saturday's decision was the result of
a previous meeting which included
Bus'-ness Managers H. R. Harvey, '16,
of the Chaparral, and Ben Knapp, '15,
of the Pelican. Many ideas regarding
staff preparation, appointment of the
staff, and general management of the
papers were exchanged and discussed.
Among the hoped-for results from the
staff exchange is a closer union of
sympathies of the two universities.
Upon the success of this venture will
probably depend the establishment of a
custom of yearly exchange of staffs.
December 1 has been selected as the
date for the issue of the exchange edi
tions. The sale of both papers togeth
er will afford the two student bodies
an opportunity of interesting compari
sons.
