A FEAST
for the devotee of athletics is a
visit to a Spalding store. Therein
he can see and examine
implements and accessor
ies fo.r every known ath
letic sport. An expert will
take pleasure in showing him what
the champions use in their re
spective lines. He can wield a
racket, swing a golf club or a base
ball bat, punch a bag or "do a
stunt" on the gym apparatus; he
can even take an imaginary row on
one of the rowing machines; in fact,
he can go through the manoeuvres
of every form of athletic sport right
in our store.
If you cannot call at a Spalding
store, then the next best thing is to
send fo.r a Spalding catalogue.
