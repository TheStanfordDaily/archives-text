## New Organization Will Endeavor to Assume Collection of a Regular Sum at Stanford. Women Will Make Clothes ALUMNI TO BE ORGANIZED 
### 
Au organized opportunity to con
tinue in helping the famine-stricken
Belgians will be offered the people of
the campus. A new committee has
been formed which will take charge
of receiving pledges for monthly con
tributions from those wishing to add
to the aid already given or make
their first contribution.
The latest dispatches from Belgium
repeat the early tales of suffering.
With the approach of winter, the cold
and famine will destroy the entire
population unless relief is brought in.
Stanford has exceeded all expecta
tions in the first call for aid, but more
funds are needed and this second call
comes to those who feel they want
to help still more. The latest reports
of the first Stanford fund place it at
something over $2400.
While no organized effort will be
made to extort money from people
who have given as much as they can,
the duty of the new committee will
be to receive voluntary offerings. One
man has be2n appointed in each fra
ternity and rooming house and a
group in Encina Hall, and the com
mittee as a whole will meet tomorrow
afternoon in the council chambers at
4:45 with Dr. Branner to receive in
structions on the method of collecting
the fund.
Briefly, this method is to allow each
of these men to receive the pledges
in his own house. The pledges will
be for the payment of a definite sum
each month. The average sum which
it has been suggested for each man
to contribute is fifty cents a month,
though a pledge for any sum, larger
or smaller, will lie received.
The women of the campus will also
be given another opportunity to help.
A comm'ttee representing each or
ganization met with Mrs. Jordan at
the home of Mrs. Stillman to organize
their work. On next Saturday after
noon nil the women in the commu
nity will meet at Mrs. Jordan's home
to make clothes and to make over old
clothes, which will be sent in the re
lief ship. The work, which has been
carried on at Stanford by the com
mittee headed by Mrs. H. C. Brown in
collecting clothes, will be merged
with the larger work contemplated.
The work of this committee has been
going on and two shipments of cloth
ing have been made to San Francisco.
The second of these consignments,
consisting of four large cases, was
sent yesterday.
The work among the students of the
University is only a part of a larger
relief campaign being organized on
the campus under the direction of a
committee of faculty men and women.
Not only will money be received from
campus residents but from the sur
rounding communities: and the alum
ni of the University throughout the
United States will be organized to
help in the humanitarian work. Mrs.
V. L. Kellogg is chairman of the fac
ulty committee and the other mem
bers are M.rs. Jordan, Mrs. .T. M. Still
man, Mrs. IT. .T. Ryan. Mrs. IT. R. Fair
clough, Mrs. E. D Adams, Mrs. TT. 0.
Rrown and Mrs. F. .T, Treat, and E.
F. Cubherley, .T. E. McDowell and E.
W. Smith.
The work of this committee is al
ready under way and $100 per month
moment to which even the suspicion of
dullness could be attached.
F. 11. Johnston, '17, and F. C. McCol
loch, '17, will interpret the sterling
roles of "Stephen Balrd" and "Jackson
Ives," respectively. Each is ideally fit
ted to his part physically, while tem
peramentally the roles are similarly
congenial. They have many dramatic
and sympathetic scenes, which in their
hands cannot fail to register an ap
peal.
The four women of the comedy will
appear to decided advantage, as por
trayed by Miss Esther Liversidge, Miss
Grace Seward, Miss Maybelle Peck, and
Miss Beatrice Russell.
Tickets for "Ready Money" will .re
