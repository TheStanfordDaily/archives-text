# Fifty Cents a Month
## 
### 
An appeal for aid in hospital sup
plies from an American correspond
ent in Vienna reached us today—it is
an appeal "as neutral as is pain, as
sympathy for pain." It is an oppor
tunity few would carelessly ignore, yet
an Alumnus of the University is the
active head of relief work in another
corner of war's stage and our ener
gies are bent to his aid.
Today a permanent committee to
manage the Belgian Fund contribu
tions is named by President Bran
ner; its share Is the .receipt and
forwarding to the San Francisco com
mittee of the monthly contributions of
the community members.
It was early recognized that one re
lief ship would not hold California's
material expression of sympathy and
helpfulness for a starving people; the
supplies must be sent at regular inter
vals during the winter months. To
allow the giver the full measure of the
opportunity with the least sacrifice,
the plan of small monthly payments
was evolved.
The question is—is fifty cents here
worth more to the individual than that
amount in food-stuff in a famine
stricken country? Distance is elim
inated —the appeal is in the name of
humanity.
