# A
						Game Gone Glimmering

The Second Varsity game has faded
from the field of post-season rugby
possibilities,for California has weighed
the advantages and disadvantages of a
second contest with the Cardinal and
given adverse decision. The proximi
ty of examination week, and the num
ber of football games scheduled for
the coming week-ends, are the reasons
given for the reversal of a former de
cision.
It is to he regretted that this first
and unusual opportunity to educate
the public to the widespread "rugby
sense" of the University students is to
be lost without trial. But the failure
of the plan for the exhibition contest
staged for charity, is due to force of
circumstances—we can only hope tli.»,t
the plan will not be forgotten for other
years.
