The following is a pro-German
poem translated into English from a
late edition of the Missouri Stats Zei
tung. The verses aptly describe the
feeling of hate which the Fatherland
holds for its enemies, especially Eng
land. The last few lines intimate the
lofty position with which the Teutons
estimate their country as a far-reach
ing and powerful race:
"Nun, Gott mit mir!" cries mighty
Thor,
Great Wodan's son and god of war,
And hurls him in the whirling hell
And fights it long and fights it well.
So doth the lone and mighty Thor,
The dauntless old gray god of war.
Now round him roars the awful tide
Of battling beasts from far and wide;
For out the west as black as night
The grizzled Osa tears his right
And seeks to slay the mighty Thor,
The dauntless old gray god of war.
In front old Taura grimly roars
As with his horned brow he gores
And flares his eyes and smokes his
breath
With rage to bury Thor in death —
With rage to slay the mighty Thor,
The dauntless old gray god of war.
Upon the left the fiery Gaul
Is wild to see the hero fall,
While Taura bellows 'cross the main
And calls his beasts from mount and
plain
And sets the mighty mob on Thor,
The dauntless old gray god of war.
But yesterday he taught them all,
A wealth of music in his hall,
From Bach, from Beethoven, Mozart;
And science, medicine and art
He taught them, too, did wondrous
Thor,
The god of peace as well as war.
