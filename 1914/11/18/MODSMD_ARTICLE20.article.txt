The following is part ot' an article
on the song "Tipperary," published o.v
an Evening Sun writer.
It's a long way to Tipperary,
It's a long way to go.
It's a long way to Tipperary,
To the sweetest girl I know.
Good-bye, Picadilly!
Farewell Leicester Square!
It's a long, long way to Tipperary,
But my heart's right there.
That is the song which has carried
our army from Aldershot to Southamp
ton and from Paris to the Aisne it is
the song which one of the sailors from
the torpedoed Cressy started singing
in the water. "It certainly is if you
have to swim there,' so went the
comment already historic.
There's an odd history to all these
songs that sweeps into favor with the
roll of a drum. Rouget del Isle wrote
his famous farewell battle hymn 10
greet the passing army of the Marseil
laise on its way through Strasburg. He
was a lieutenant there and, so one of
the stories goesâ€”he was tipsy when he
wrote it. His reward was to be the
last bottle of wine in the cellar of his
inn. He finished it hastily, drowsily,
to meet the coming of the "black
browed mass" of revolutionists at
dawn. When the last note of it was
down on paper, his head toppled into
his hands and he fell asleep. "The
greatest war song eve.r promulgated,"
is what Carlyle calls it,"and whole ar
mies and assemblages will sing it,
with eyes weeping and burning, with
hearts defiant of death, despot and
devil."
There is something peculiarly ap
propriate about the tune Tipperary.
The French have had it translated, and
are singing it as they go into battle
Scotch Highlanders, who probably
never heard of Ireland's Tipperary,
are playing it on their pipes. Cana
dian reservists, lonesome for the west
ern forests, are humming it. And na
tive Bengalese are crooning the little
song through their very white teeth, as
they shiver through the chilly nights
and wipe their bayonets dry.
But fo.r all that, it was made in IT.
