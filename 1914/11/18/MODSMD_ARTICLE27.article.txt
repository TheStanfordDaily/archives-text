# PEOPLE AID WAR LOAN
## 
### 
United Press Telegraphic Report.
London, Nov. IS. â€”Present indica
tions point to an oversubscription for
bonds of the $1,750,000,000 English
war loan recently declared by the
British Parliament. A long line of
prospective subscribers waited before
the Bank of England this morning in
an attempt to purchase some of the
bonds. The issue will be redeemable
March 1, 1928.
Allied warships shelled a German
troop train rushing reinforcements to
the front via a coastwise route with
resulting complete wreckage and con
flagration of the train. Dispatches
show that the fleet resumed action
when the fog lifted.
