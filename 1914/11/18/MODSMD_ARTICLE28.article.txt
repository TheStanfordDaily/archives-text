### 
London, Nov. 18.â€”Although under
tremendous pressure from the Ger
man infantry, the British artillery in
the vicinity of Arras is holding, and
at one point even repelled the Teu
tons at a distance of five hundred
yards. Two British divisions made
determined attacks upon the enemy
but both were repulsed.
