# "READY MONEY" PLAYERS HOLD DRESS REHEARSAL
## SOPHOMORES AWAIT CURTAIN FRIDAY EVENING. Class of 1917 Will Introduce Exceptionally Capable Cast in Roles of Universal Appeal. 
### 
The final dress rehearsal of "Ready
Money," the Sophomore play, to be pre
sented Friday evening in Assembly
Hall, will be held this evening under
the direction of Coach F. L. Mathieu,
of San Francisco. The cast is now
letter-perfect in lines and individual
bits of "business," and an unusually
smooth performance is promised.
"Ready Money" has been described
in original billboard advertisements as
"something the sad world is longing
for." The phrase may be ungrammat
ical, but it is singularly happy in de
scribing the play, as the article in
question. "Ready Money" does have a

fortunate combination of wit, humor,
fun, or whatever variety of the sensa
tion it is the world seeks in its hours
of leisure.
The play is based upon the tendency
to "bluff," supposedly an American
habit, but really universal. The plot
relates to the way in which this self
possession in the knowledge of an
empty pocketbook is utilized to bring
concrete results. Stephen Haird, gen
tleman and man of business, is on the
verge of ruin and suicide, despe.rate in
the midst of happy friends who seem
powerless to help him, when Jackson
Tves, an acquaintance, comes to him on
New Year's eve with $20,000 and the
idea to "flash it." Haird impulsively
promises to do anything in his power
to help Ives at any time, and the latter
at once startles him with the statement
that the money is counterfeit; he made
it, and he may be arrested at any time.
This is an excellent example nf the
suddenness with which changes come
in this comedv. The nlav hns not a
