# WILL PUBLISH DIRECTORY
## G. AND M. SOCIETY TO ISSUE SECOND YEAR BOOK. Data and Articles Being Gathered by E.C. Templeton, '10, and H.L. Small, '11. 
### 
The Geology and Mining Society will
issue its second directory and year
hook of all members, graduates, and
officers of the Geology and Mining De
partments early in the spring. At the
society smoker, held yesterday even
ing at the El Toro Club, the planning
and compilation of the forthcoming
"who's who" was the main subject of
discussion. The actual getting togeth
er of the material and the publishing
of the directory will be entrusted to
the recently formed "Come-Back Club,"
an organization of alumni in the de
partment now engaged in graduate and
research work. E. C. Templeton, '10,
and H. L. Small, '11, will be in charge
of the compiling of the data.
In addition to a directory the year
book will comprise a series of articles
by graduates in either mining or geol
ogy, who are at work in the four cor
ners of the globe. These contributions
will be of personal experiences, com
bining brief accounts of a fieldman's
life in newly-developed foreign terri
tory, with facts of scientific value.
The department has graduates at work
in South America, Central America,
Asia, and Africa, and the book should
contain many unusually interesting
articles of this nature.
The first directory of the Geology
and Mining Departments, a similar
publication, was issued last year, and
was enthusiastically received by the
alumni.
"Water Resources of Brazil" was the
subject of a short talk given by H. L.
Small at last night's meeting. E. C.
Templeton also spoke, giving some in
teresting statistics concerning petro
leum conditions in Montana.
The G. and M. Society is planning
the second annual reunion of the Ge
ology and Mining Departments, to be
held next May in conjunction with
Commencement Week. The first re
union was held last May, when Pro
fessor J. P. Smith was the guest of
honor at the alumni .reception, and it
was decided to make the reunion an
annual event.
