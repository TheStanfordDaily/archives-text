# BASKETBALL HOLDS SWAY
## INTERCOLLEGIATE SCHEDULE IS ANNOUNCED. Prospects Are Bright With Seven Veterans and Promising Squad of Freshmen Out for Honors. 
### 
With the rugby season over, and
with but one month left to pick out
material for the basketball team for
the coming year, followers of the court
game have already begun activities,
and will hold regular practice from
now until the opening of the first con
test on January 23.
The first big move for basketball
was made last. Friday when L. R.
Reynolds, '15, coach and captain of
the 1915 Stanford quintet, met with
representatives of five other colleges
in San Francisco to make out the
schedule for the coming season.
The league includes, besides Stan
ford, California, St. Mary's, College of
the Pacific, Nevada, and St. Ignatius.
Each team in the league will play one
game with each other squad.
Games will be played at all of the
colleges represented. Two teams will
go to Nevada, and the Nevada squad
will invade central California once,
playing three games while here.
According to Captain Reynolds, the
outlook for Stanford basketball play
ers is unusually bright, as seven vet
erans, who have played against Cali
fornia, are still in college, and are ex
pected out. They are A. E. Worthy,
'15, J. R. Davies, '15, E. T. Dutton, '15,
W. B. Blodget, '15, H. J. Ling, '15. and
I. E. Farrer, '15.

tice Tuesday and Thursday afternoons
at 5 o'clock on the Gymnasium court,
this being the only available time.
Captain Reynolds requests all play
ers desiring to try out to sign up some
time this week.

neither college appears to have an ar
ray of veterans equal to Stanford's

of which is to bring out material, will
be held under the auspices of the team

With the rugby season over, and
with but one month left to pick out
material for the basketball team for
the coming year, followers of the court
game have already begun activities,
and will hold regular practice from
now until the opening of the first con
test on January 23.
The first big move for basketball
was made last. Friday when L. R.
Reynolds, '15, coach and captain of
the 1915 Stanford quintet, met with
representatives of five other colleges
in San Francisco to make out the
schedule for the coming season.
The league includes, besides Stan
ford, California, St. Mary's, College of
the Pacific, Nevada, and St. Ignatius.
Each team in the league will play one
game with each other squad.
Games will be played at all of the
colleges represented. Two teams will
go to Nevada, and the Nevada squad
will invade central California once,
playing three games while here.
According to Captain Reynolds, the
outlook for Stanford basketball play
ers is unusually bright, as seven vet
erans, who have played against Cali
fornia, are still in college, and are ex
pected out. They are A. E. Worthy,
'15, J. R. Davies, '15, E. T. Dutton, '15,
W. B. Blodget, '15, H. J. Ling, '15. and
I. E. Farrer, '15.
Those out for basketball will prac
tice Tuesday and Thursday afternoons
at 5 o'clock on the Gymnasium court,
this being the only available time.
Captain Reynolds requests all play
ers desiring to try out to sign up some
time this week.
Stanford's strongest rivals for cham
pionship seem to be Santa Clara and
the University of California. Though
neither college appears to have an ar
ray of veterans equal to Stanford's
both have heavy and speedy teams.
An intcrclass schedule, the purpose
of which is to bring out material, will
be held under the auspices of the team
next week. It is expected that strong
interclass teams can be organized af
ter the preliminary series now being
played has exposed eligible basket
shooters.
Besides playing the intercollegiate
series it is the plan of Captain Rey
nolds to hold several short series of
games with California and the other
colleges in this vicinity. Several San
Francisco teams will be strong com
petitors for the Cardinal players.
Stanford's first game in the inter
collegiate series will be on January 30,
at San Jose, with the College of the
Pacific.
The schedule is:
January 33—College of Pacific ver
