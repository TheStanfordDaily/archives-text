# CALIFORNIA REJECTS GAME BETWEEN RIVAL SECOND VARSITIES
## Blue and Gold Authorities Hold Proposed Contest Inadvisable. Wilcox Secures Thanksgiving Date With Sacramento Club TO ELECT CAPTAIN SUNDAY 
### 
Word was received last night by
Graduate Manager R. W. Wilcox from
Johnny St.roud, who acts in the same
capacity at the University of Califor
nia, that the student body authorities
at the state institution deem it inad
visable to stage a rugby contest be
tween the Second Varsities of Stan
ford and California. The announce
ment puts a definite end to all rumors
to that effect which have been circulat
ing on the campus during the past
week.
On November 5, the Executive Com
mittee, at their regular meeting, voted
to stage the game if the Blue and Gold
powers that be would give their as
sent. The local board had hoped to
play the contest as either a curtain
raiser to the international game next
Saturday or on Thanksgiving Day.
This season Stanford has developed
the fastest Second team that ever
whipped a Cardinal Varsity into shape,
and as a result have been popularly
styled the Stanford All-Blaeks. On ac
count of their excellent showing
throughout the playing months, an en
deavor was made to reward the mem
bers of the team with a final intercol
legiate game and some form of a
sweater.
California refuses to enter into
further competition with Stanford in
football, believing that the other post
season games which yet remain on the
football calendar, and which also will
be staged on the Berkeley Field, have
taken up all available dates. Further
more, they claim that, such a match
would have an injurious effect, upon
the scholarship, since final examina
tions come within the next three
weeks. The general sentiment of .rug
by devotees upon the subject points
to the fact that such a move on the
part of Cal'fornia. could not be made
without definite knowledge of a pos
sible defeat at the hands of the
Cardinal Second Varsity, and, in view
of this fact, such an action would be
more or less inexpedient.
Manager Wilcox announced late this
afternoon that he had completed ar
rangements for a game with the Sac
ramento Athletic Club fifteen for
Thanksgiving Day, November 2(1.
Since it will be impossible for a ma
jority of the members of the Varsity
to go to the state capital at that time,
he has decided to send the All-Blacks
to Sacramento. The nersonnel of the
team that will play the holiday game,
and its substitutes, will be announced
tomorrow. The Athletic Club is re
puted to have one of the strongest rug
by fifteens in the northern part of the
state, and .ranks well with any of
the Bay City club teams.
Next. Sunday morning the eighteen
Stanford ruggers who played in the
Big Game, will meet at Franklin's
photo studio, in Palo Alto, for the
team picture. As has been the regular
custom in the past, years, a leader of
the 1915 team will be selected to take
up the duties laid down by Captain
Gard.
