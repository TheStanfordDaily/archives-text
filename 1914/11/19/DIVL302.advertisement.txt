Kentucky Hurley leaf — treated bv
the original "Tuxedo Process,'
which removes the sting so that it
cannot bite your tongue —granulat-
ed so that it smokes freely and uni
formly— packed 40 pipefuls to the
10c tin.
Tuxedo deserves everything that
has ever been said of it—and to prove
it Tuxedo sells by the millions upon
millions of tins annually.
