# INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATE WILL BE FREE TO PUBLIC
## JUDGES TO CHOOSE VICTORS WITHOUT CONFERRING. Stanford and California Compromise on Disputed Question of New Department. 
### 
That no admission will be charged
for the Intercollegiate Debate, and
that (he judges shall not confer after
the debate before rendering their de
cisions, is the ultimatum of the alumni
arbitration committee on these two
points. E. A. Cunha, '07, Stanford's
representative, telegraphed A. F.
Coyle, '15, to that effect this morning.
This represents a compromise be
tween Stanford and California, inas
much as the local committee stood
for charging an admission fee of twen
ty-five cents, and also for non-consul
tation of judges. California debaters
refused to give any .reason for their
stand on the first question, but it is
the policy of the rival institutions not
to charge for admittance to anything
of an educational nature. This, and
the fear that it would be impossible
to secure an audience if charge was
made are probably the reasons for the
action on the matter.
In the new agreement the reference
to the decision of the judges, reads as
follows: "The judges for the Inter
collegiate Debate shall be seated in
different, sections of the hall. At the
conclusion of the debate, each judge
may either remain in the hall or re
tire to a room separate from the other
judges, and shall reach his decision
without consultation. Each judge shall
report his decision separately to the
chairman of the meeting. A majority
of the ballots shall be necessary for a
decision."
