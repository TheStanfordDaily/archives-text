# Opening the Front Door
## 
### 
The front door to our University Is
opened to the motoring public at last
—tiie delivery men and laundry agents
are no longer the privileged holders
of the main entrance key, to the ex
clusion of taxi and touring car. Palm
Drive is open to gasoline propelled ve
hicles for the first time in history—
whether or not the bars are down for
all time it is impossible to learn from
campus sources, but this temporary
concession is a clear ray of hope ror
future years.
The discrimination shown in parting
the stream of traffic to the campus
has long been a point at issue in this
community, for it has been evident
that the portion of campus-bound
travellers which should be greeted
with the best we have to offer, was
being shunted into the tradesmen's en
trance, marked "automobile road."
Othet visitors, whose view of the cam
pus may well include in the fore
ground the piles of bricks and the
earthquake ruins, have been forced to
the wide way of the beautiful Palm
Drive, with its wonderful perspective
of Stanford's beauties.
It is the fervent wish and hope of
the entire community that the bars
of Palm Drive are down forever —and
if two entrance roads are to be main
tained, that the tables be reversed on
the laundry wagons!
