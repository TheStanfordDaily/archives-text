The joy of open-handed hospitality
is its own reward, yet occasionally
there conies material evidence of the
appreciation of visitors royally enter
tained. Such an evidence was the re
markahle stunt of Aviator Lincoln
Beachey at Saturday's game, when he
soared and looped with streamers cf
cardinal Into the hearts of thousand*
of Stanford folk.
The man directly responsible for the
bleacher coup was E. Carl Wallin, a
photographer of the San Francisco
Examiner staff, who has been a fre
quent campus visitor in past years.
His memory of trips to Stanford is a
pleasant one, having always encoun
tered the treatment due visitors, and
with the co-operation of Neill C. Wil
son, 12, of the Examiner staff, Wallin
set the wheels in motion that secured
Beachey's hearty acceptance of the
plan. William H. Pickens, Beachey's
manager, is also one of the coterie of
good sports, and worked on the stunt
with the enthusiasm of an under grad
uate.
To Lincoln Beachey is due the sin
cere gratitude of all Stanford men,
for to further the efforts of the root
ing section to eclipse the Blue and
Gold, the genial aviator sacrificed gate
receipts at a subsequent exhibition,
and accepted only a Cardinal costume
as a reward. In whatever way the
debt may be settled—it is not one r o
be paid in cash—Lincoln Beachey
should know that his place is secure
on Stanford's roll of Good Fellows.
