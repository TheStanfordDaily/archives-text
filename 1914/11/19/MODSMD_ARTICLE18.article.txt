# Dreams Are Best
## 
### 
Though Robert VV. Service is known
best for his stirring poems of Alaskan
life, his later works have contained
verse of a decidedly different type.
The following is an example, taken
from the book. "Rhymes of a Rolling
Stone:"
I just think that dreams are best,
Just to sit and fancy things;
Give your gold no acid test,
Try not how your silver rings;
Fancy women pure and good,
Fancy men upright and true:
Fortressed in your solitude,
Let Life be a dream to you.
0 you Dreamers, proud and pure,
You have gleaned the sweet of life!
Golden truths that shall endure
Ove.r pain and doubt and strife.
1 would rather be a fool
Living in my Paradise,
Than the leader of a school,
SÂ°dly sane and weary wise.
Yes, I'll smoke my cigarettes,
Vestured in my garb of dreams.
And I'll borrow 110 regret;
All is gold that golden gleams.
So I'll charm my solitude
With the faith that life is blest,
Brave and noble, bright and good.
Oh, I think that dreams are best!
