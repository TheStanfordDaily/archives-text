Editor The Daily Palo Alto:
A recent communication in which
the writer, a so-called "Honest Jas
l>ar,' tried to further the publicity of
the tennis agitators, by attempting to
bring in the good name of the Stan
ford Chess Club, should not be passed
unnoticed, lest many of the University
public get the w.rong idea concerning
chess activities at Stanford. The
statement of "Jaspar" that he learned
the game when a baby, shows that he
is probably an active member of the
Sons of Rest. Enough for Jaspar!
The Stanford Chess Club today has
20 active members, and meets eve v y
Thursday evening in Encina's recep
tion room. At the present time an in
teresting class tournament is being
held and a series of matches are be
ing scheduled with the Faculty Club
and the Palo Alto Club. The Stan
ford Chess Club has held intercollegi
ate tournaments with California every
spring since the early days of this in
stitution. The club is one of the heal
thy organizations of Stanford life that
has done its share for over twenty
years in maintaining the high standard
of relations with California, and will
continue to do so in the future. And
if any of the other minor sports have
a grievance don't try to bring the
Chess Club into your affairs, especial
ly in a semi-humorous light.
A MEMBER.
