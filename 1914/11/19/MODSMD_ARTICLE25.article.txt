Charity again! And why not? Sher
man, '64, may have known what war
was, but he never tasted the pangs of
what the destitute Belgians are now
tasting. If he had, he might have used
a stronger word. But perhaps hell was
as strong as they made them sixty
years ago.
Come to think of it, old man, better
be shaking the motballs out of your
high-class togs—the cotillion is less
than a week distant. And one night
under the mattress will improve the
crease in those trousers a thousand
fold.
No Second Varsity game! There's a
reason. "Safety first," for California.
Made in tlic U. S. A.
A little slogan we used to see,
Was"This was made in Germany,"
Hut times have changed, and every day
We read "Made in the U. S. A."
Now that's a change I admire,
That slogan's as it should be.
For "Made in I T . S. A.." you see.
• Includes both you and me.
