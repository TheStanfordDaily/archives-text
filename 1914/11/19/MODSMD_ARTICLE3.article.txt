# University Will Open Gates That Prohibit Autos on Palm Drive?
## 
### 
Palm Drive, from University Avenue
to the Quad, is to be thrown open to
automobiles. This was the informa
tion given out to day by Farm Su
perintendent J. E. Hewston. Automo
biles were excluded from the drive by
the desire of Mrs. Stanford, who held a
dislike for the modern conveyances
which were displacing the horse. For
several years motor cars were barred
from the entire campus.
The change has been made neces
sary by the need of repairing the main
traveled automobile entrance, which
has become cut with ruts and chuck
holes to such an extent that to travel
over it is dangerous. At present Palm
Drive is closed to all traffic, and is
undergoing extensive repairs. The
University is spending $2,500 in trans
forming this gravel road into an oil
macadam highway. An extra heavy
crude oil with a high percentage of
asphaltum is being used. This oil
cools quickly and presents a hard sur
face a very short time after being
laid. An experiment on lower Lasuen
has proved an oiled surface to be most
efficient for campus roads
Superintendent Hewston expects to
have the Palm Drive ready fo.r traf
fic in the course of ten days, at the
end of which time the road now used
by motor vehicles will be closed for
repairs. It is not decided whether
Palm Drive will permanently be used
for auto traffic, or merely serve as a
temporary substitute.
