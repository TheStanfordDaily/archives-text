# ENGLISH CLUB REVIVES OUTDOOR PLAY CUSTOM
## Robin Hood and His Merry Men Will Appear Near Stanford Mansion, April 23. 
### 
English Club members, meeting at
Langworthy House last night, decided
to return to an old custom of the or
ganization dropped years ago, and give
an outdoor play.
Three larg etrees near the old Stan
ford mansion and a long sloping lawn
have been found to make an ideal out
door stage setting and theatre for the
play of Robin Hood. The merry men
and Sherwood Forest will be present
on Stanford Farm for at least one af
ternoon.
Glenn Hughes, '16, was chosen coach
for the play. He has coached the
same play for outdoor acting in the
South, and feels that the enterprise of
the English Club will be unusually
successful here, both by reason of
ability of players and the ideal natur
al setting which has presented itself.
The play will be given on a Friday
afternoon. Parts have been chosen.
At the meeting las>i night seven new
members were elected. They are:
Anita Allen, '17, Eleanor Cogswell,
'17. Hazel Ball. '15, Lutitia Winn. '18,
J. C. Cross, '17, E. L. House, T.', and
S. Chapman, '16. Glen Hughes read
selections from his pageant, which is
to be produced in the near future at
Long Beach.
