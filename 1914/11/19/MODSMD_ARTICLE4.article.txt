# SOPHOMORES PREPARED TO GIVE "READY MONEY"
## DRESS REHEARSAL PROMISES DRAMATIC TRIUMPH. Fascinating Theme Blending Financial and Romantic Interest Explains Success of Comedy. 
### 
Finishing touches were put upon
the production of "Ready Money" last
evening during the final dress re
hearsal in the Assembly Hall. Coach
F. L. Mathieu directed the Sophomore
players in their various bits of "busi
ness," and the cast succeeded in per
fecting the numerous details that in
sure a successful dramatic perform
ance.
The clever lines of "Ready Money"
are alone sufficient to carry the play.
Comedy and dramatic surprises fol
low each other in quick succession
and a happy combination of laughs
and thrills result.
The play opens by introducing a
young mine owner, Stephen Baird (F.
R. Johnston, '17.) who is unhappy be
cause he is not successful in life, and
who is about to be married, or, as he
puts it. must begin to live to save oth
ers from disgrace. To make matters
worse, it is New Year's eve.
At the crucial moment a clever coun
terfeiter, "Jackon Ives" (F. C. Mc-
Colloch, '17.) meets him and shows
him how to compel people to have con
fidence in his mining stock. The ef
fect is electrical, when they see ac
tual money. The moral of the play
is that nothing succeeds like success,
which confidence must first inspire.
Seldom has a play blended the ele
ments of romance and finance with
the skill exhibited in this brisk come
dy in which the author, .Tames Mont
gomery, has achieved an international
success.
Seats for "Ready Money" will re
main on sale at the campus Bookstore
and at Welngartner's drug store, in
Palo Alto, until the evening of the
production, when the boxoffice will he
transferred to the middle arch of the
Quad, as usual.
