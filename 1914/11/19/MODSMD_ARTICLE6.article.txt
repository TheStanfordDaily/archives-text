# ALUMNI TO AID BELGIANS
## GRADUATE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL SWELL FUND Fifty-Cent Campaign on Campus to Arouse Student Interest in Movement For Relief of Seven Million War Victims 
### 
Stanford alumni will be enlisted in
a nation-wide movement to aid the
destitute Belgians. They will be or
ganized to carry on the relief work in
communities not yet reached by any
relief movement. A special branch
of the general committee has
been organized to get in touch with
the alumni of the University every
where, and through them to describe
the plight of the war-stricken people
and secure relief for them.
Already plans are under way to or
ganize the whole Peninsula south of
San Francisco, under the Stanford
Relief Committee to secure the aid of
the people residing there. The work
of the special Alumni Organization
Committee, consisting of Mrs. E. W.
Allan, '96. chairman, Mrs. E. D.
Adams, secretary, F. C. Woodward,
and J. E. McDowell, '02, will ex
tend the influence of the Stanford or
ganization throughout the nation.
No attempt will be made to inter
fere with the work of organizations
already existing in any local communi
ty, or to bring such efforts under the
larger Stanford movement. The
whole plan of the coinmittee is to
raise funds for relief where no organ
ized opportunity has been given to
contribute up to the present time or
possibly in communities where some
money has been raised through tem
porary organization, but no continued
effort is being made to increase this
amount or to receive pledges of a
regular sum to be paid monthly. This
is the keynote of the present move
ment —to get the assurrance through
pledges of a regular monthly sum
which can be counted on for the con
tinuation of the relief.
Alumni Receives Circulars.
In pursuance of their plan, the
Alumni Committee is corresponding
with large numbers of the alumni of
the University. A circular is being
sent out urging their co-operation in
the relief work through (he organiza
tion of their own communities if no
relief is being actively solicited
there already. With H. C. Hoover at
the head of the government commis-
s.on iu charge of aiding the Belgians,
the University, us a whole, both alum
ni and students, owe him their co
operation in carrying on the relief
work.
Student Pledges lteceited Tomorrow.
Students will be given their first
opportunity to join in the second of
fer ol relief tomorrow when the coni
m.ttee of men in charge will start ac
tive work. They met with Dr. Bran
uer late this afternoon to organize,
in the present campaign 110 student
will be urged in any way to give mon
ey. It .s simply a movement to ob
tain voluntary subscriptions, and it is
believed that this can be done more
effectively through an organization.
No man is expected to give a large
.Him, fifty cents per month being the
sum suggested for each man to pledge.
Mrs. V. L. Kellogg addressed a meet
ing of representatives from the wo
men's organizations of the campus on
the subject of the relief work yester
day afternoon. She urged that the wo
men set apart one evening each week
to making garments to be sent on the
supply ships to Belgium. A special
meeting will be held at Mrs. Jor
dan's residence on Saturday afternoon,
from two to six, to sew on the clothes
to be sent. The women of the Univer
sity are urged to attend.
Great Need Is for Food.
The great need of the Belgian peo
ple has been discussed so widely on
the campus that everyone knows of it.
Money for food is the great need at
the present time. None of the funds
raised here will be devoted to buying
clothing. The plea has come to the
New York Relief Committee from some
Belgian people, "Have your women
stop mak.ng baby clothes and send us
food instead. The babies won't bo
able to live through the winter, any
way, and we will all perish if we
don't get food.'
There are seven million people in
Belgium who will not be able to sur
vive the winter without outside aid.
It is est mated that $5,000,000 a month
is the sum which will be necessary
to supply these people with one-half of
a soldier's rations. Today a million
men are in the bread line in Belgium,
the townspeople having no means of
support outside of relief. With the
problem of supplying the people ahead
of them, the work of the commission
can only be done through the active
co-operation of the people of the
United States —the only Western na
tion of influence not at war. The $250,-
000 raised on the coast is a large sum
but it will have to be increased.
"Fifty cents will keep one Belgian
alive for one month," is the statement
made by Mrs. V. L. Ketlogg, who is
chairman of the Faculty Committee for
collecting donations. "He will not 1»e
well-fed, but that amount will keep
life in his body, and tide him over this
dreadful period of suffering." The
committee in charge has named this
the "Fifty-Cent Campaign."
Mrs. H. J. Ryan is treasurer of the
committee, and any one may obtain
subscription blanks from her.

money has been raised through tem
porary organization, but no continued
effort is being made to increase this
amount or to receive pledges of a
regular sum to be paid monthly. This
is the keynote of the present move
ment —to get the assurrance through
pledges of a regular monthly sum
which can be counted on for the con
tinuation of the relief.
Alumni Receives Circulars.
In pursuance of their plan, the
Alumni Committee is corresponding
with large numbers of the alumni of
the University. A circular is being
sent out urging their co-operation in
the relief work through (he organiza
tion of their own communities if no
relief is being actively solicited
there already. With H. C. Hoover at
the head of the government commis-
s.on iu charge of aiding the Belgians,
the University, us a whole, both alum
ni and students, owe him their co
operation in carrying on the relief
work.
Student Pledges lteceited Tomorrow.
Students will be given their first
opportunity to join in the second of
fer ol relief tomorrow when the coni
m.ttee of men in charge will start ac
tive work. They met with Dr. Bran
uer late this afternoon to organize,
in the present campaign 110 student
will be urged in any way to give mon
ey. It .s simply a movement to ob
tain voluntary subscriptions, and it is
believed that this can be done more
effectively through an organization.
No man is expected to give a large
.Him, fifty cents per month being the
sum suggested for each man to pledge.
Mrs. V. L. Kellogg addressed a meet
ing of representatives from the wo
men's organizations of the campus on
the subject of the relief work yester
day afternoon. She urged that the wo
men set apart one evening each week
to making garments to be sent on the
supply ships to Belgium. A special
meeting will be held at Mrs. Jor
dan's residence on Saturday afternoon,
from two to six, to sew on the clothes
to be sent. The women of the Univer
sity are urged to attend.
Great Need Is for Food.
The great need of the Belgian peo
ple has been discussed so widely on
the campus that everyone knows of it.
Money for food is the great need at
the present time. None of the funds
raised here will be devoted to buying
clothing. The plea has come to the
New York Relief Committee from some
Belgian people, "Have your women
stop mak.ng baby clothes and send us
food instead. The babies won't bo
able to live through the winter, any
way, and we will all perish if we
don't get food.'
There are seven million people in
Belgium who will not be able to sur
vive the winter without outside aid.
It is est mated that $5,000,000 a month
is the sum which will be necessary
to supply these people with one-half of
a soldier's rations. Today a million
men are in the bread line in Belgium,
the townspeople having no means of
support outside of relief. With the
problem of supplying the people ahead
of them, the work of the commission
can only be done through the active
co-operation of the people of the
United States —the only Western na
tion of influence not at war. The $250,-
000 raised on the coast is a large sum
but it will have to be increased.
"Fifty cents will keep one Belgian
alive for one month," is the statement
made by Mrs. V. L. Ketlogg, who is
chairman of the Faculty Committee for
collecting donations. "He will not 1»e
well-fed, but that amount will keep
life in his body, and tide him over this
dreadful period of suffering." The
committee in charge has named this
the "Fifty-Cent Campaign."
Mrs. H. J. Ryan is treasurer of the
committee, and any one may obtain
subscription blanks from her.
Stanford alumni will be enlisted in
a nation-wide movement to aid the
destitute Belgians. They will be or
ganized to carry on the relief work in
communities not yet reached by any
relief movement. A special branch
of the general committee has
been organized to get in touch with
the alumni of the University every
where, and through them to describe
the plight of the war-stricken people
and secure relief for them.
Already plans are under way to or
ganize the whole Peninsula south of
San Francisco, under the Stanford
Relief Committee to secure the aid of
the people residing there. The work
of the special Alumni Organization
Committee, consisting of Mrs. E. W.
Allan, '96. chairman, Mrs. E. D.
Adams, secretary, F. C. Woodward,
and J. E. McDowell, '02, will ex
tend the influence of the Stanford or
ganization throughout the nation.
No attempt will be made to inter
fere with the work of organizations
already existing in any local communi
ty, or to bring such efforts under the
larger Stanford movement. The
whole plan of the coinmittee is to
raise funds for relief where no organ
ized opportunity has been given to
contribute up to the present time or
possibly in communities where some
money has been raised through tem

No man is expected to give a large

sum suggested for each man to pledge.
Mrs. V. L. Kellogg addressed a meet
ing of representatives from the wo
men's organizations of the campus on
the subject of the relief work yester
day afternoon. She urged that the wo
men set apart one evening each week
to making garments to be sent on the
supply ships to Belgium. A special
meeting will be held at Mrs. Jor
dan's residence on Saturday afternoon,
from two to six, to sew on the clothes
to be sent. The women of the Univer
sity are urged to attend.
Great Need Is for Food.
The great need of the Belgian peo
ple has been discussed so widely on
the campus that everyone knows of it.
Money for food is the great need at
the present time. None of the funds
raised here will be devoted to buying
clothing. The plea has come to the
New York Relief Committee from some
Belgian people, "Have your women
stop mak.ng baby clothes and send us
food instead. The babies won't bo
able to live through the winter, any
way, and we will all perish if we
don't get food.'
There are seven million people in
Belgium who will not be able to sur
vive the winter without outside aid.
It is est mated that $5,000,000 a month
is the sum which will be necessary
to supply these people with one-half of
a soldier's rations. Today a million
men are in the bread line in Belgium,
the townspeople having no means of
support outside of relief. With the
problem of supplying the people ahead
of them, the work of the commission
can only be done through the active
co-operation of the people of the
United States —the only Western na
tion of influence not at war. The $250,-
000 raised on the coast is a large sum
but it will have to be increased.
"Fifty cents will keep one Belgian
alive for one month," is the statement
made by Mrs. V. L. Ketlogg, who is
chairman of the Faculty Committee for
collecting donations. "He will not 1»e
well-fed, but that amount will keep
life in his body, and tide him over this
dreadful period of suffering." The
committee in charge has named this
the "Fifty-Cent Campaign."
Mrs. H. J. Ryan is treasurer of the
committee, and any one may obtain
subscription blanks from her.
Stanford alumni will be enlisted in
a nation-wide movement to aid the
destitute Belgians. They will be or
ganized to carry on the relief work in
communities not yet reached by any
relief movement. A special branch
of the general committee has
been organized to get in touch with
the alumni of the University every
where, and through them to describe
the plight of the war-stricken people
and secure relief for them.
Already plans are under way to or
ganize the whole Peninsula south of
San Francisco, under the Stanford
Relief Committee to secure the aid of
the people residing there. The work
of the special Alumni Organization
Committee, consisting of Mrs. E. W.
Allan, '96. chairman, Mrs. E. D.
Adams, secretary, F. C. Woodward,
and J. E. McDowell, '02, will ex
tend the influence of the Stanford or
ganization throughout the nation.
No attempt will be made to inter
fere with the work of organizations
already existing in any local communi
ty, or to bring such efforts under the
larger Stanford movement. The
whole plan of the coinmittee is to
raise funds for relief where no organ
ized opportunity has been given to
contribute up to the present time or
possibly in communities where some
money has been raised through tem
porary organization, but no continued
effort is being made to increase this
amount or to receive pledges of a
regular sum to be paid monthly. This
is the keynote of the present move
ment —to get the assurrance through
pledges of a regular monthly sum
which can be counted on for the con
tinuation of the relief.
Alumni Receives Circulars.
In pursuance of their plan, the
Alumni Committee is corresponding
with large numbers of the alumni of
the University. A circular is being
sent out urging their co-operation in
the relief work through (he organiza
tion of their own communities if no
relief is being actively solicited
there already. With H. C. Hoover at
the head of the government commis-
s.on iu charge of aiding the Belgians,
the University, us a whole, both alum
ni and students, owe him their co
operation in carrying on the relief
work.
Student Pledges lteceited Tomorrow.
Students will be given their first
opportunity to join in the second of
fer ol relief tomorrow when the coni
m.ttee of men in charge will start ac
tive work. They met with Dr. Bran
uer late this afternoon to organize,
in the present campaign 110 student
will be urged in any way to give mon
ey. It .s simply a movement to ob
