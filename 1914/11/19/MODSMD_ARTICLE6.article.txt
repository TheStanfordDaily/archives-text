# ALUMNI TO AID BELGIANS
## GRADUATE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL SWELL FUND Fifty-Cent Campaign on Campus to Arouse Student Interest in Movement For Relief of Seven Million War Victims 
### 
Stanford alumni will be enlisted in
a nation-wide movement to aid the
destitute Belgians. They will be or
ganized to carry on the relief work in
communities not yet reached by any
relief movement. A special branch
of the general committee has
been organized to get in touch with
the alumni of the University every
where, and through them to describe
the plight of the war-stricken people
and secure relief for them.
Already plans are under way to or
ganize the whole Peninsula south of
San Francisco, under the Stanford
Relief Committee to secure the aid of
the people residing there. The work
of the special Alumni Organization
Committee, consisting of Mrs. E. W.
Allan, '96. chairman, Mrs. E. D.
Adams, secretary, F. C. Woodward,
and J. E. McDowell, '02, will ex
tend the influence of the Stanford or
ganization throughout the nation.
No attempt will be made to inter
fere with the work of organizations
already existing in any local communi
ty, or to bring such efforts under the
larger Stanford movement. The
whole plan of the coinmittee is to
raise funds for relief where no organ
ized opportunity has been given to
contribute up to the present time or
possibly in communities where some
money has been raised through tem
porary organization, but no continued
effort is being made to increase this
amount or to receive pledges of a
regular sum to be paid monthly. This
is the keynote of the present move
ment â€”to get the assurrance through
pledges of a regular monthly sum
which can be counted on for the con
tinuation of the relief.
Alumni Receives Circulars.
In pursuance of their plan, the
Alumni Committee is corresponding
with large numbers of the alumni of
the University. A circular is being
sent out urging their co-operation in
the relief work through (he organiza
tion of their own communities if no
relief is being actively solicited
there already. With H. C. Hoover at
