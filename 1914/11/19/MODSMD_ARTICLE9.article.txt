## 
### 
For the benefit of the Stanford Clin
ic social service work in San Fran
cisco, the Auxiliary Association of the
campus and the Alumni Association
that support the workers are planning
a Dansant and dinner at the Palace
Hotel on the afternoon and evening
of December 6.
H. H. Maundrell, who has been en
gaged to promote the enterprise, was
on the campus today and visited the
different fraternities, each of which
is expected to take one table at the
dinner. The sororities of the campus
will be visited by Mrs. Allen, Dean of
Women, who will promote the dansant
and dinner among the women.
A special train will be engaged to
take the Stanford students to the din
ner. The Executive Committee ar
ranged two weeks ago .to send the
Glee Club and Band to the affair.
Present plans are to open the day's
festivities at the Palace at four o'clock
in the afternoon. Dancing will be held
from then until nine o'clock. Lunches
will be served between several of the
lances, and musical numbers from the
Band and Glee Club will help enter
tain those who attend the festivity.
Tt is now decided to have ten peo
ple seated at each table. Each frater
nity and sorority is expected to take
at least one table at fifteen dollars. It
is expected that the funds gained at
the dinner will be almost sufficient to
continue the work of the Stanford
Clinic social service work during the
present year.
