### 
The confidence engendered in
self by the knowledge that the
teacher is of the best is ours to
day. The man who is given credit for
the training of the triumphant varsi
ties of the two years past, whose brain
and personality have created a rugby
sense in an indefinite number of the
uninitiated, is to be the director of
the Stanford football field for another
year.
Floyd C. Brown is a Stanford Man in
every meaning of the word, a man who
combines in great degree the true
meaning of the indefinable Stanford
Spirit. Under his tutelage there could
be neither fear nor favor shown, and
the knowledge that drives the ruggers
011 to ultimate success is the intimate
knowing of the expert.
With Coach Brown as our chief of
.rugby staff, we're not fearing for the
Fall of Exposition Year.
