# Far From the Madding Crowd—

If you're scared of the terrible town,
and tired of canyons of dismal unrest,
there's a deal of satisfaction in the
soothing quiet of the rural life. Yet
today rural does not infe.r solitude,
and there is many a tie that binds us
to things urban.
Such a welcome leash is the first
event in campus musical circles of the
year—the Evan Williams concert in
the Assembly Hall tomorrow night. A
singer of renown in a program that
offers much to any lover of good
music—a crowded hall best expresses
the appreciation of the community.
It is for us to show our thankful
ness to those whose efforts have made
such a series of concerts possible for
the campus dwellers. The best in the
land are to give us a taste of their
consummate art—joy enough for the
Stay-at-home Clan!
