### 
United Press Telegraphic Report
Paris, Nov. 20. â€”The Communique
reports a large number of German
heavy siege guns lost in the fightins
about Flanders. The artillery duel
from the seacoast at Lys slackened
somewhat yesterday. A precipitous
snowfall at Flanders acted as a pre
ventative of any Teuton infantry at
tacks. Operation in the Argonne
forests have been void of any startling
features.
