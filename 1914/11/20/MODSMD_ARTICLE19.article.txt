Robert J. Burdette, the humorist
preacher, passed away Tuesday at his
home in Pasadena. He was born in
Greensboro, Pennsylvania, in 1844. He
spent his boyhood and young manhood
in Peo.ria, Illinois, where he gained
through newspaper work, quite a repu
tation as a humorist. Later, he became
a Baptist minister and pastor of the
Temple Baptist church of Los Angeles.
His wife, Clara Bradley Burdette, is an
active club woman and writer. The
following poem is an example of his
work:
What will we do when the good days
come—
When the prima donna's lips are dumb,
And the man who reads us his "little
things"
Has lost his voice like one girl who
sings;
When stilled is the breath of the cor
net-man,
And the shrilling cords of the quar
tette clan;
When our neighbor's children have
lost their drums —
i Oh. what will we do when the good
time comes?
Oh, what will we do in the good blithe
time,
When the tramp will work —oh, thing
sublime!
And the scornful dame who stands on
your feet
Will "Thank, you sir," for the prof
fered seat;
And the man you hire to work by the
day,
Will allow you to do his work your
way;
And the cook who trieth your appetite
Will stenl 110 more than she thinks is
right;
When the boy you hire will call you
"Sir,"
Instead of "Say," and "Guverner;"
When 1he funny man is humorsome —
[ How can we stand the millennium?
