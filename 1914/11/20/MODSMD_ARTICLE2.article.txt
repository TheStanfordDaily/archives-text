# CAMPUS CHARACTER TO LEAVE
## Louis Benoit Forced by Sickness to Sell Out After Twenty Years' Service. 
### 
Louis Benoit, whose twenty years'
of activity in the cleaning and tailor
ing business on the campus have made
him seem almost a part of the "farm,"
has sold out his business. A stroke or
paralysis, which Louis suffered in
September, has made a rest necessary
for him. A. T. King, for five years in
business with Louis, will continue the
shop.
