# RIVAL DEBATERS TO MEET FOR TWENTY-SECOND TIME
## FORENSIC CLASH TAKES PLACE THIS EVENING Stanford Will Uphold Affirmative of Initiative and Referendum Question. 
### 
Stanford and California clash for the
twenty-second time in intercollegiate
debate, at Girls' High School Auditor
ium in San Francisco this evening. For
the last two years the Cardinal debat
ers have brought home victory in this
contest with the Blue and Gold, and,
according to W. B. Owens, '14. coach
of debating, we have at least an equal
chance to win again this year.
The question, "Resolved, that the
state of California should abolish in
itiative and referendum," is by no
means a one-sided proposition. Stan
ford's debaters have chosen to uphold
the affirmative, and will consequently
have the burden of proof on their side.
Again, California has the advantage
of arguing on the side which has been
established by law in the state, and to
a great extent throughout the United
States. Still there are many things
against the initiative and referendum
as state-wide institutions, and the local
team is prepared to say them.
All the undergraduate classes are
represented in the Stanford aggrega
tion. A. F. Coyle. '15, will be the first
speaker, W. L. Miller. '17, will comÂ°
second for Stanford, and A. J. Het
tinger. '10. last. M. Crobaugh, 'IS, Iris
been chosen as alternate.
California will be represented by
three Seniors. .T. H. Levy, E. K. Sturgi -.
and T. G. Chamberlain, all debaters ' 112
