# Y.M.C.A. TO CONVENE AT ASILOMAR CHRISTMAS
## Date Changed From Spring to Permit Greater Number of Students to Attend. 
### 
Announcement has been made that
the annual student conference of the
Y. M. C. A. will be held this year dur
ing the Christmas vacation at Asilo
mar, near Pacific Grove. The custom
followed during the past few years of
having the gathering in the spring
has been superseded by the winter
conference, which will permit of a
larger number of men being in attend
ance.
Since the beginning of vacation time
is not far distant, the local Y. M. C. A.
is interesting itself in finding out the
number oi' men who will attend f,rom
Stanford. The conference will take
up the latter part of the holidays, not
starting until after Christmas. This
will give the men attending at least a
week to spend at home before going to
Asilomar.
Stanford has always been represent
ed by a delegation of considerable size,
but a number of the men have always
been prevented from attending be
cause the conference came in the mid
dle of the track season, and they were
not permitted to leave the campus dur
ing spring vacation. The removal of
this ban, by the change of time, should
add to the number representing Stan
ford.
Asilomar is just a. mile west of Pa
c tic Grove, and has been established
especially as a conference grounds for
the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. There
is a large central building there for
holding the sessions, and numerous
tent-house dormitories located among
the pines house the guests.
Arrangements are being made to
allow stop-overs on the railroad tickets
of the people in the southern part of
the state, so that they can attend the
conference at the least possible ex
pense.
A committee consisting of A. E.
Worthy, '15, F. S. Murray, '16, A. J.
Vail, '15, H. .J. Ryon, '15, and F. C.
Hamilton, '15, has been appointed to
take charge of the delegat'on, and all
students interested can obtain further
information from them regarding the
conference. No definite selection of
the speakers and leaders of the con
ference has bee made, but they will
be announced at an early date.
