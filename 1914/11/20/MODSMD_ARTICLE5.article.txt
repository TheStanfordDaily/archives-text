# AMERICA MEETS BRITISH LION
## Thirteen Stanford Players Included in Lineups of International Game Scheduled at California Tomorrow GARD AND WYLIE UNABLE TO PLAY 
### 
Thirty ruggers wearing the Ameri
can Shield and the British Lion will in
augurate an international battle for
football supremacy tomorrow after
noon on the California turf in an All-
Star contest, which will practically
close the 1914 rugby season. The
gate receipts from the game will be
apportioned equally between the Bel
gium and Red Cross funds. As a cur
tain-raiser to the main attraction :t
team composed of San Francisco's high
school performers will line-up against
the best talent that the bay county mil
itary schools can assemble.
Yesterday afternoon Jack McKenzie,
rugby commissioner of the Barbarian
Club, brought down his English
charges for two hours' practice on the
Stanford Field. Danny Carroll, who
will act as skipper fo.r the All-British
aggregation, put the players through
a stiff workout, making teamwork the
chief object.
Two Stanford .ruggers, who were
counted upon to star in tomorrow's
contest, Deke Gard and Jim Wylie,
will be unable to don suits on account
of severe injuries received in the Big
Game. Gard suffered a peculiar twist
ing of the rib which will not pe.rmit
him to take his place at breakaway on
the American fifteen. His absence
from the line-up will occasion much
regret, as for the past two seasons
he has taken his place on an All-Star
team, last fall captaining the United
States fifteen. Wylie received a bad
kick in the head during the first half
of the intercollegiate, which necessi
tated his being put under a doctor's
care in the Peninsula Hospital from
Tuesday until this morning. Tt is
feared that a slight concussion of the
brain has resulted.
The American team is generally re
garded by rugby experts to be the
stronger, since its lirte-up includes al
most entirely veterans from the Stan
ford-California battle last Saturday.
Excluding Gard, seven Cardinal Var
sity players will fight for the rod.
