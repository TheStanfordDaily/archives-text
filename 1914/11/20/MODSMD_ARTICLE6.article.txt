# Sophomores Will Offer "Ready Money" Tonight
## Tickets for Montgomery's Melodrama to Be on Sale at Box Office This Evening. 
### 
James Montgomery's brilliant melo
dramatic comedy of an interesting co
terie of New Yorkers in pursuit of
financial, as well as social success,
is scheduled for production at the As
sembly Hall this evening. The class
of 15*17 has selected a play of quick
action which cannot fail to score. The
cast includes the most promising play
ers in the Sophomore class.
The action of "Ready Money" begins
on New Year's eve. The first act pic
tures the luxurous apartment of Sam
Welch (L. W. McDermott, '17,) in an
exclusive New Yo.rk hotel. It is here
that one meets nearly all the charac
ters of this three-act financial ro
mance. Many people are required to
unfold the plot, and each represents
an American type that is immediately
recognized. With the exception of the
roles of the two leading men (F. R.
Johnston and F. C. McColloch) the
numerous parts are of almost equal
importance.
Tickets for "Ready Money" will be
on sale at the box-office in the middle
arch adjoining the Assembly Hall un
til the hour set fo.r the production.
