# READY MONEY COMEDY IS STAGE ACHIEVEMENT
## Hundred Per Cent Pure Fun Merits Praise HONORS WELL DISTRIBUTED F.R. Johnston in Lead Reaches Higher Plane—Small Audience Enjoys Treat of Season 
### Paul Staniford 
Three Stanford dramatic ventures of
the last two years deserve special note
in that history of the local stage which
is a convenient volume for reference,
though it will never in probability be
written. They are "The Only Way,"
"The Fortune Hunter" and "Ready
Money.' Despite a universal differ
ence in background and treatment,
they offer a common comparison of
actors and adaptability.
Frenzied play committees have
wheeled all sorts of vehicles into the
glare of the footlights, while James
Montgomery's comedy has gathered
rust in some New York play broker's
office. All credit to the 1917 commit
tee which is responsible for the selec
tion.
"Ready Money" made a triumphant
splurge Friday evening, and did it with
a chuckle. The author appears to
have enjoyed writing the personally
conducted tour of Wall Street. Where
that last notion comes from is hard to
say, unless the ever-present comfort
of the fact that the quality of humor
was not strained in any one of the
three acts.
Some hundreds of people took a gay
flight into the circles of high finance,
and then floated forth from the As
sembly hall on uncropped wings of
contentment. All of the foregoing has
the element of true criticism. No per
formance can make the dimes in one' 3
pockets weigh like dollars without
having something behind it. That is
the effect "Ready Money" had on the
audience. One economics major who
is a regular patron of the street car
stopped into a taxicab without a blink,
and whirred off to Palo Alto. What
you say is perfectly true, but at the
same time, it was a taxicab.
Early in the first act, Jackson Ives,
maker of illicit greenbacks, enjoined
the tempted but untainted hero of the
piece that money begets money. He
handed over to Stephen Baird a wad
of home-made currency, which the
down-and-out hero flashed among his
gilded friends. Naturally they thought
that his boomerang mine out in Arizo
na had struck convertible special, and
urged to be let in on the distribution
of shares. During the remainder of
the performance it required Jackson
Ives, the office boy, and a sweetheart
to help gather in the investments.
Near the end of the play when Eth
ics I students were beginning to fear
that the fortune of the hero was found
ed on counterfeit money, a telegram
from the silent partner out in Arizona
rushed in and annnounced that the
Sky-Rocket mine had made a ten
strike. So the investors were protect
ed, the secret service sleuths foiled,
and wedding chimes provided soft mu
sic fo.r the finale. T am not quite con
vinced yet that the moral tangles were
all straightened out. but. at any rate,
it was fun.
"Ready Money" had an exceptional
brand of humor, and a very good cast.
There was no attempt to solve domes
tic problems or to reform drunkards.
Tnde"* 1 there was a moral to be gath
ered wNeh worked well on the stage
at any rate —line your pocketbook well
a you have to pawn tiie family hetr
ioonis, and money will flock to you.
Speaking ol the cast, we get to the
boitoni uf tilings. The Sophomore play
ers offered a remarkable balance of
merit. The leads were taken with dic
tinction by F. R. Johnston and Miss
Esther Liversedge. A distribution of
approval among the other principals
gives each one a good portion. Better
value might have been forced from
some of the lesse.r character roles.
. Since W. B. Owens held the boards
as Sidney Carton in"The Only Way,"
in February, 1913, there has been no
treatment of a straight part which
equaled that of F. R. Johnston in the
role of Stephen Baird, the owner of
the Sky-rocket mine, in his various
phases as a good fellow, down and out
speculator, and successful adventurer.
Though is true that the two roles
are too much at variance to permit
comparison, both were stamped with a
degree of excellence which towers
above that of other recent attempts to i
build telling creatures out of different
material.
There was a nervous tenseness,
stretched to the breaking point in ev- !
ery motion of the character, which 1
could not be duplicated by any other j
student-actor at Stanford. That in
terpretation of the role carried power
ful sincerity.
Jackson Ives, the master counter
feiter, was a master varlet in the
hands of F. C. McColloch. He offered
a suggestion of reserve power and sub
stantial growth into the role which
won approval.
As James Morgan, the hard-driving
financier. E, 11. Evans won enviable
success. All evidence of youth was
hidden, not by make-up alone, but by j
every gesture and movement.
Miss Esther Liversedge. as Grace
Tyler, was attractive, and secured
ready sympathy. In company with
the others of the cast, her enunciation
was easy to catch. That virtue in
itself would cover many faults,
Mrs. John Tyler, pon,rayed by Miss
Grace Seward, afforded the suffragette
element of comedy with a badgering
insistence which was welcome to the
audience.
The Misses Mabel Peck and Beat
rice Russell were pleasing in light
roles.
L. W. McDermott was successful in
his treatment of the role of Sam
Welch, the millionaire's son. Without
having too much of the debonair quali
ty, his carriage as a host was easy.
J. C. Cross had only two entrances,
as the French head waiter. His ges
ticulating, obesances. and glorified ac
cent were well affected and presented
with the polish which has made many
minor roles an avenue to local fame.
Honorable John Tyler offered an ac
ceptable study of the too-much wife
type of man, though one got the feel
ing that he allowed opportunities to
slip through his hands.
Other parts were carried with fair
ability. Some laughs were gleaned
from the entries of the four secret ser
vice men. who were trailing Ives'
counterfeiting campaign. TliPir brand
of sleuth was a bit more crude than
might have been well conceived.

say, unless the ever-present comfort
of the fact that the quality of humor
was not strained in any one of the
three acts.
Some hundreds of people took a gay
flight into the circles of high finance,
and then floated forth from the As
sembly hall on uncropped wings of
contentment. All of the foregoing has
the element of true criticism. No per
formance can make the dimes in one' 3
pockets weigh like dollars without
having something behind it. That is
the effect "Ready Money" had on the
audience. One economics major who
is a regular patron of the street car
stopped into a taxicab without a blink,
and whirred off to Palo Alto. What
you say is perfectly true, but at the
same time, it was a taxicab.
Early in the first act, Jackson Ives,
maker of illicit greenbacks, enjoined
the tempted but untainted hero of the
piece that money begets money. He
handed over to Stephen Baird a wad
of home-made currency, which the
down-and-out hero flashed among his
gilded friends. Naturally they thought
that his boomerang mine out in Arizo
na had struck convertible special, and
urged to be let in on the distribution
of shares. During the remainder of
the performance it required Jackson
Ives, the office boy, and a sweetheart
to help gather in the investments.
Near the end of the play when Eth
ics I students were beginning to fear
that the fortune of the hero was found
ed on counterfeit money, a telegram
from the silent partner out in Arizona
rushed in and annnounced that the
Sky-Rocket mine had made a ten
strike. So the investors were protect
ed, the secret service sleuths foiled,
and wedding chimes provided soft mu
sic fo.r the finale. T am not quite con
vinced yet that the moral tangles were
all straightened out. but. at any rate,
it was fun.
"Ready Money" had an exceptional
brand of humor, and a very good cast.
There was no attempt to solve domes
tic problems or to reform drunkards.
Tnde"* 1 there was a moral to be gath

Speaking ol the cast, we get to the
boitoni uf tilings. The Sophomore play
ers offered a remarkable balance of
merit. The leads were taken with dic
tinction by F. R. Johnston and Miss
Esther Liversedge. A distribution of
approval among the other principals
gives each one a good portion. Better
value might have been forced from
some of the lesse.r character roles.
. Since W. B. Owens held the boards
as Sidney Carton in"The Only Way,"
in February, 1913, there has been no
treatment of a straight part which
equaled that of F. R. Johnston in the
role of Stephen Baird, the owner of
the Sky-rocket mine, in his various
phases as a good fellow, down and out
speculator, and successful adventurer.
Though is true that the two roles
are too much at variance to permit
comparison, both were stamped with a
degree of excellence which towers
above that of other recent attempts to i
build telling creatures out of different
material.
There was a nervous tenseness,
stretched to the breaking point in ev- !
ery motion of the character, which 1
could not be duplicated by any other j
student-actor at Stanford. That in
terpretation of the role carried power
ful sincerity.
Jackson Ives, the master counter
feiter, was a master varlet in the
hands of F. C. McColloch. He offered
a suggestion of reserve power and sub
stantial growth into the role which
won approval.
As James Morgan, the hard-driving
financier. E, 11. Evans won enviable
success. All evidence of youth was
hidden, not by make-up alone, but by j
every gesture and movement.
Miss Esther Liversedge. as Grace
Tyler, was attractive, and secured
ready sympathy. In company with
the others of the cast, her enunciation
was easy to catch. That virtue in
itself would cover many faults,
Mrs. John Tyler, pon,rayed by Miss
Grace Seward, afforded the suffragette
element of comedy with a badgering
insistence which was welcome to the
audience.
The Misses Mabel Peck and Beat
rice Russell were pleasing in light
roles.
L. W. McDermott was successful in
his treatment of the role of Sam
Welch, the millionaire's son. Without
having too much of the debonair quali
ty, his carriage as a host was easy.
J. C. Cross had only two entrances,
as the French head waiter. His ges
ticulating, obesances. and glorified ac
cent were well affected and presented
with the polish which has made many
minor roles an avenue to local fame.
Honorable John Tyler offered an ac
ceptable study of the too-much wife
type of man, though one got the feel
ing that he allowed opportunities to
slip through his hands.
Other parts were carried with fair
ability. Some laughs were gleaned
from the entries of the four secret ser
vice men. who were trailing Ives'
counterfeiting campaign. TliPir brand
of sleuth was a bit more crude than
might have been well conceived.
Three Stanford dramatic ventures of
the last two years deserve special note
in that history of the local stage which
is a convenient volume for reference,
though it will never in probability be
written. They are "The Only Way,"
"The Fortune Hunter" and "Ready
Money.' Despite a universal differ
ence in background and treatment,
they offer a common comparison of
actors and adaptability.
Frenzied play committees have

down-and-out hero flashed among his
gilded friends. Naturally they thought
that his boomerang mine out in Arizo
na had struck convertible special, and
urged to be let in on the distribution
of shares. During the remainder of
the performance it required Jackson
Ives, the office boy, and a sweetheart
to help gather in the investments.
Near the end of the play when Eth
ics I students were beginning to fear
that the fortune of the hero was found

from the silent partner out in Arizona
rushed in and annnounced that the
Sky-Rocket mine had made a ten
strike. So the investors were protect

and wedding chimes provided soft mu

it was fun.
"Ready Money" had an exceptional
brand of humor, and a very good cast.
There was no attempt to solve domes

Speaking ol the cast, we get to the
boitoni uf tilings. The Sophomore play
ers offered a remarkable balance of
merit. The leads were taken with dic
tinction by F. R. Johnston and Miss
Esther Liversedge. A distribution of
approval among the other principals
gives each one a good portion. Better
value might have been forced from
some of the lesse.r character roles.
. Since W. B. Owens held the boards
as Sidney Carton in"The Only Way,"
in February, 1913, there has been no
treatment of a straight part which
equaled that of F. R. Johnston in the
role of Stephen Baird, the owner of
the Sky-rocket mine, in his various
phases as a good fellow, down and out
speculator, and successful adventurer.
Though is true that the two roles
are too much at variance to permit
comparison, both were stamped with a
degree of excellence which towers
above that of other recent attempts to i
build telling creatures out of different
material.
There was a nervous tenseness,
stretched to the breaking point in ev- !
ery motion of the character, which 1
could not be duplicated by any other j
student-actor at Stanford. That in
terpretation of the role carried power
ful sincerity.
Jackson Ives, the master counter
feiter, was a master varlet in the
hands of F. C. McColloch. He offered
a suggestion of reserve power and sub
stantial growth into the role which
won approval.
As James Morgan, the hard-driving
financier. E, 11. Evans won enviable
success. All evidence of youth was
hidden, not by make-up alone, but by j
every gesture and movement.
Miss Esther Liversedge. as Grace
Tyler, was attractive, and secured
ready sympathy. In company with
the others of the cast, her enunciation
was easy to catch. That virtue in
itself would cover many faults,
Mrs. John Tyler, pon,rayed by Miss
Grace Seward, afforded the suffragette
element of comedy with a badgering
insistence which was welcome to the
audience.
The Misses Mabel Peck and Beat
rice Russell were pleasing in light
roles.
L. W. McDermott was successful in
his treatment of the role of Sam
Welch, the millionaire's son. Without
having too much of the debonair quali
ty, his carriage as a host was easy.
J. C. Cross had only two entrances,
as the French head waiter. His ges
ticulating, obesances. and glorified ac
cent were well affected and presented
with the polish which has made many
minor roles an avenue to local fame.
Honorable John Tyler offered an ac
ceptable study of the too-much wife
type of man, though one got the feel
ing that he allowed opportunities to
slip through his hands.
Other parts were carried with fair
ability. Some laughs were gleaned
from the entries of the four secret ser
vice men. who were trailing Ives'
counterfeiting campaign. TliPir brand
of sleuth was a bit more crude than
might have been well conceived.
Three Stanford dramatic ventures of
the last two years deserve special note
in that history of the local stage which
is a convenient volume for reference,
though it will never in probability be
written. They are "The Only Way,"
"The Fortune Hunter" and "Ready
Money.' Despite a universal differ
ence in background and treatment,
they offer a common comparison of
actors and adaptability.
Frenzied play committees have
wheeled all sorts of vehicles into the
glare of the footlights, while James
Montgomery's comedy has gathered
rust in some New York play broker's
office. All credit to the 1917 commit
tee which is responsible for the selec
tion.
"Ready Money" made a triumphant
splurge Friday evening, and did it with
a chuckle. The author appears to
have enjoyed writing the personally
conducted tour of Wall Street. Where
that last notion comes from is hard to
say, unless the ever-present comfort
of the fact that the quality of humor
was not strained in any one of the
three acts.
Some hundreds of people took a gay
flight into the circles of high finance,
and then floated forth from the As
sembly hall on uncropped wings of
contentment. All of the foregoing has
the element of true criticism. No per
formance can make the dimes in one' 3
pockets weigh like dollars without
having something behind it. That is
the effect "Ready Money" had on the
audience. One economics major who
is a regular patron of the street car
stopped into a taxicab without a blink,
and whirred off to Palo Alto. What
you say is perfectly true, but at the
same time, it was a taxicab.
Early in the first act, Jackson Ives,
maker of illicit greenbacks, enjoined
