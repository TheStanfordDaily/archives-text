Three Stanford dramatic ventures of
the last two years deserve special note
in that history of the local stage which
is a convenient volume for reference,
though it will never in probability be
written. They are "The Only Way,"
"The Fortune Hunter" and "Ready
Money.' Despite a universal differ
ence in background and treatment,
they offer a common comparison of
actors and adaptability.
Frenzied play committees have
wheeled all sorts of vehicles into the
glare of the footlights, while James
Montgomery's comedy has gathered
rust in some New York play broker's
office. All credit to the 1917 commit
tee which is responsible for the selec
tion.
"Ready Money" made a triumphant
splurge Friday evening, and did it with
a chuckle. The author appears to
have enjoyed writing the personally
conducted tour of Wall Street. Where
that last notion comes from is hard to
say, unless the ever-present comfort
of the fact that the quality of humor
was not strained in any one of the
three acts.
Some hundreds of people took a gay
flight into the circles of high finance,
and then floated forth from the As
sembly hall on uncropped wings of
contentment. All of the foregoing has
the element of true criticism. No per
formance can make the dimes in one' 3
pockets weigh like dollars without
having something behind it. That is
the effect "Ready Money" had on the
audience. One economics major who
is a regular patron of the street car
stopped into a taxicab without a blink,
and whirred off to Palo Alto. What
you say is perfectly true, but at the
same time, it was a taxicab.
Early in the first act, Jackson Ives,
maker of illicit greenbacks, enjoined
the tempted but untainted hero of the
piece that money begets money. He
handed over to Stephen Baird a wad
of home-made currency, which the
down-and-out hero flashed among his
gilded friends. Naturally they thought
that his boomerang mine out in Arizo
na had struck convertible special, and
urged to be let in on the distribution
of shares. During the remainder of
the performance it required Jackson
Ives, the office boy, and a sweetheart
to help gather in the investments.
Near the end of the play when Eth
ics I students were beginning to fear
that the fortune of the hero was found
ed on counterfeit money, a telegram
from the silent partner out in Arizona
rushed in and annnounced that the
Sky-Rocket mine had made a ten
strike. So the investors were protect
ed, the secret service sleuths foiled,
and wedding chimes provided soft mu
sic fo.r the finale. T am not quite con
vinced yet that the moral tangles were
all straightened out. but. at any rate,
it was fun.
"Ready Money" had an exceptional
brand of humor, and a very good cast.
There was no attempt to solve domes
tic problems or to reform drunkards.
