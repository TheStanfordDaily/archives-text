# Captain Carroll
## 
### 
Daniel Brendan Carroll is as fit a
rugger to captain the Stanford Varsity
as has been chosen in the nine years
of intercollegiate rugby. His selection
by his teammates of this year's victor
ious fifteen as the leader of the Car
dinal hope for the Exposition Year,
is the tribute due intimate knowledge
of the game, to dashing skill in practice
and to the unflagging zeal of a true
sportsman and good Stanford man,
shown in two football seasons.
His skill in the English game is na
tive, the perfected finish of his play
is the training of years of schoolboy
football. While past experience has
given the center three-quarters some
advantage over less schooled ruggers,
his play has never been checked dur
ing the ten weeks seasonâ€”the new
captain is an earnest worker, both on
and off the field.
With Coach Brown and Captain Car
roll in the vanguard, there'll be many
a man who'll get into the rugby col
umn in the Fall of '15.
