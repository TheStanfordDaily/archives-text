Gelett Burgess has long been in fa
vor as a master of fantastic as well as
sprightly verse form. The following
poem carries the kindly wink at life
which is typical of his writings:
'T was ever a man and a maid, my
son—
'T was ever a man and a maid;
And 't will be that way till the Judg
ment Day,
And after it, too, I'm afraid!
'T was ever a man and a maid, my
son,
Of a Sunday afternoon,
With a stroll in the Park, and a kiss in
the dark
Of a sultry summer moon.
'T was ever a man and a maid, my
son,
As you watch the crowds go by,
Of the folk that pass, there's a youth
and a lass
Wherever you pipe your eye!
'T was ever a man and a maid, my
son,
All over the world it goes,
And the man from Mars may shy at
the cars,
But here is a game he knows!
'T was ever a man and a maid, my
son,
There is Work, and there's maids to
woo—
And they're quite two things, as I
know, who sings
And they've bowled down better than
you!
'T was ever a man and a maid, my
son,
Watch out, or She'll let you shirk!
For a man can't write, in the candle
light,
If Her eyes get into his work!
