# STANFORD MAN IS AUTHOR OF PLEASING NEW COMEDY
## 
### 
"Batting Bill," the new play being
presented this week at the Alcazar in
San Francisco, is the co-work of a
Stanford man, C. A. Kenyon, '00, who
produced the comedy, in collaboration
with his brother, A. Kenyon. The play
is adapted from a short story by Peter
B. Kyne, the popular short story
writer.
"Batting Bill" is a breezy baseball
comedy, containing a "niob scene,"
which creates a very dramatic effect.
It seems destined for a long and suc
cessful career. Kenyon attended Stan
ford during the years '99 and '00, and
is a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fra
ternity.
