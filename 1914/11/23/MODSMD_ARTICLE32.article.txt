# FACULTY RELIEF CORPS ACTIVE IN CAMPAIGN
## STUDENTS OFFERED CHANCE TO ORGANIZE FIFTY-CENT CAMPAIGN DURING VACATION. 
### 
The Relief Committee of the Facul
ty met this afternoon and heard re
ports from all the committees. Though
but little time has been allowed to
date for student pledges, Mrs. H. J.
Ryan, treasurer of the committee, re
ported that she has sent $150 to San
Francisco for the November subscrip
tions.
Mrs. H. C. Brown reported a long list
of garments which have already been
shipped. Sixty of the women of- the
University were present at Mrs. David
Starr Jordan's home Saturday after
noon, and completed more clothes.
Mrs. J. M. Stillman reported on the
work done Saturday at this after
noon's meeting.
The campaign for funds outside of
the University proper is well under
way. Already sixteen towns in the
mmediate vicinity have been organized
through the Alumni Organization Com
mittee. Through the letters sent out
by Mrs. E. D. Adams work has been
started in a number of communities as
far east as Wisconsin.
A number of students have suggested
to this committee that they organize a
center for fifty-cent subscriptions in
their home town over the Thanksgiv
ing recess. Any others who wish to
do this may receive subscription
blanks and full information on the sub
ject from Mrs. E. W. Allan o.r Mrs.
Adams. All the money received from
any community should be given to Mrs.
Adams in a lump sum.
Mrs. Brown has sent out a request
that every one who can will send
pieces of woolen cloth to her home.
Since they are desired for the women
to work on over the vacation, it is es
sential that they be sent in immedi
ately. The goods will be used for
making caps, and even very small
pieces are desirable.
Mrs. Brown's committee will send
off another shipment of clothing in
three weeks. They will be glad to re
ceive any discarded garments at once,
in order to have them mended in time
for the shipment.
