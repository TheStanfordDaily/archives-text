# EVAN WILLIAMS SINGS AND AUDIENCE IS WON
## REARRANGED PROGRAM SHOWS ARTIST'S SPLENDID WORK IN CONTRASTED NUMBERS. 
### Anita Allen 
Rearranging his program to his own
satisfaction and to that of his hearers,
Evan Williams sang his way into the
hearts of the large audience gathered
to hear him on Saturday. This genial
and whimsical artist is equally famous
for his work in the fields of oratorio
and "lieder" singing, and his program
included selections well calculated to
show the qualities which have won
him his place as the most beloved
American tenor.
In the two Handel selections, with
which Mr. Williams opened the pro
gram, he appeared to have difficulty
with his voice on account of a cold
from which he is suffering. Called
back for an encore, the tenor respond
ed with the ever-welcome "Perfect
Day," by Carrie Jacobs-Bond. In the
group of songs following the artist
seemed to find his voice, rendering
Hayden's "Spirit Song" and Ware's
"Wind and Lyre" with charm and feel
ing. In response to insistent applause,
he sang Metcalf's "Absent," a charm
ing number always in high favor with
William's audiences.
Striking a new note in the range of
his program, the tenor turned to ora
torio for his inspiration. Mendelssohn's
noble "If With All Your Hearts" was
impressively rendered, but the artist
reached the height of his power in his
masterful singing of "How Many Hired
Servant's" from Sullivan's "Prodigal
Son." The dramatic power, the pathos,
the anguish, and the high resolve in
the outcry of the repentant prodigal
were brought out by the artist with
compelling depth and insight. Less
pleasing perhaps was Beach's "Open
the Gates of the Temple," introduced,
as Mr. Williams naively explained, "be
cause my son says so." The tenor's
accompanist on this tour is Vernon
Williams, whose work at the piano as
sumes thus a double interest..
Following the rendition of "All
Through the Night," as an encore, the
singer returned to the announced pro
gram for the "Eliland" song cycle,
made famous in this country by
Madame Nordica. His appreciation of
the varying moods, the dramatic and
lyric qualities of this composition were
admirable. Called back once more,
Mr. Williams responded with Brahms'
exquisite "Lullaby," which he touched
with caressing warmth and delicacy.
