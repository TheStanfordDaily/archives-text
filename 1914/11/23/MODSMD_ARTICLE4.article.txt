## Stanford Veterans Acquire Laurels in Match SCORE BOARD READS 24-13 Game Is Replete With Individual Brilliancy—Fast Backfield Work Is Responsible For Victory 
### 
After a battle of nations on the
California turf last Saturday, the rug
gers wearing the American Shield
emerged victorious over the British
Lion to the tune of 24 to 13 in a hotly
contested game. The speed of the win
ning backfield, and the vim that each
of the thirty players injected into the
contest, brought back memories of the
recent Stanford-California match.
The exhibition of the English game
was one of the cleanest, most hard
fought and exciting, from both a play
er's and spectator's point of view, that
has been staged this season. The five
eighths combination of Austin and
Lachmund, who swept down upon the
ball like cyclones at various critical
stages of the contest, again proved a
deciding factor. The work of Temple
ton for the British aggregation was a
revelation, and named him the shining
light of the foreigners. His contribu
tion to the day's total consisted of a
field goal, two difficult conversions
and a try. Stars in fact were in evi
dence a plenty all over the field.
The Englishers, made up of one-time
Canadians, Australians, Britains, and
New Zealanders, were the first to taste
blood. Following a well-directed drib
bling rush 'nto American territory, the
foreigners were awarded a free kick
for offside play. Templeton thereupon
booted a pretty drop between the goal
posts. The Yankee aggregation imme
diately evened up affairs, when on a
twenty-five-yard line-out on British
soil, Guisto snapped the pigskin to
Quill, who crossed the line for a try.
Montgomery failed at conversion.
The final scoring of the half fell to
the lot of the Americans. Austin re
ceived from a twenty-five-yard scrum,
and, after a short dash, transfered to
Ouisto. who went over for the second
try. and raised the total at the end of
the period S to the red, white and
blue shield leading.
Immediately after the inauguration
of the second half by Referee Mulin
eaux's whistle, a passing rush was ini
tiated which brought the rooters to
thei,r l'eet. Austin secured the leather
from scrum at midfield, let fly to
Brooks, who, in turn, passed to Urban.
The fast Stanford wing darted forty
yards through a scattered field to a
beautiful score. Montgomery succeed
ed in annexing a difficult conversion.
At this stage of the game the Brit'sb
ers took heart and reversed the tables
with a similar score f.rom a twentv
five-yard scrum. Davidson picked up
and passed to Cashe], who crossed the
ine without opposition. Two more tal
lies were added to the foreigners' total,
when Templeton converted a seeming
ly impossible goal.
Shine by the reverse, the Americans
proceeded to dazzle their opponents
with a. bail of scores. A passing ru«h
between Ouerin, Quill. Monisen. and
Brooks, resulted in the California
nlaver's try close to the side-lines.
Montgomery failed at conversion. Im
mediately following. Cuisto. who
nlnved a brilliant game, scooped nn
the ball and sped s'xtv-five yards with
out. being tackled for another trv.
Montgomery atrain failed. Momson
closed the nrolific scoring abilities of
the shield when be received from TTr
ban and struggled over the line. Mont
gomery kicked an easy goal.
The English stars presented a pow
erful finish, when Templeton scored
after the ball had passed through the
hands of Braden and Cashel, and later
converted.

After a battle of nations on the
California turf last Saturday, the rug
gers wearing the American Shield
emerged victorious over the British
Lion to the tune of 24 to 13 in a hotly
contested game. The speed of the win
ning backfield, and the vim that each
of the thirty players injected into the
contest, brought back memories of the
recent Stanford-California match.
The exhibition of the English game
was one of the cleanest, most hard
fought and exciting, from both a play
er's and spectator's point of view, that
has been staged this season. The five
eighths combination of Austin and
Lachmund, who swept down upon the
ball like cyclones at various critical
stages of the contest, again proved a
deciding factor. The work of Temple
ton for the British aggregation was a
revelation, and named him the shining
light of the foreigners. His contribu
tion to the day's total consisted of a
field goal, two difficult conversions
and a try. Stars in fact were in evi
dence a plenty all over the field.
The Englishers, made up of one-time
Canadians, Australians, Britains, and
New Zealanders, were the first to taste
blood. Following a well-directed drib
bling rush 'nto American territory, the
foreigners were awarded a free kick
for offside play. Templeton thereupon
booted a pretty drop between the goal
posts. The Yankee aggregation imme
diately evened up affairs, when on a
twenty-five-yard line-out on British
soil, Guisto snapped the pigskin to
Quill, who crossed the line for a try.
Montgomery failed at conversion.
The final scoring of the half fell to
the lot of the Americans. Austin re
ceived from a twenty-five-yard scrum,
and, after a short dash, transfered to
Ouisto. who went over for the second
try. and raised the total at the end of
the period S to the red, white and
blue shield leading.
Immediately after the inauguration
of the second half by Referee Mulin
eaux's whistle, a passing rush was ini
tiated which brought the rooters to
thei,r l'eet. Austin secured the leather
from scrum at midfield, let fly to
Brooks, who, in turn, passed to Urban.
The fast Stanford wing darted forty
yards through a scattered field to a
beautiful score. Montgomery succeed
ed in annexing a difficult conversion.
At this stage of the game the Brit'sb
ers took heart and reversed the tables
with a similar score f.rom a twentv
five-yard scrum. Davidson picked up
and passed to Cashe], who crossed the
ine without opposition. Two more tal
lies were added to the foreigners' total,
when Templeton converted a seeming
ly impossible goal.
Shine by the reverse, the Americans
proceeded to dazzle their opponents
with a. bail of scores. A passing ru«h
between Ouerin, Quill. Monisen. and
Brooks, resulted in the California
nlaver's try close to the side-lines.
