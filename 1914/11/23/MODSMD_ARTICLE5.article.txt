## VETERAN BACK TO CAPTAIN 1915 VARSITY Experienced Australian, Who Has Faced California in Two Big Games, Elected by Rugby Team on a Unanimous Ballot 
### 
Danny Carroll, two-year Big Came
veteran at center three-quarters, was

unanimous choice of
the eighteen men
who participated in
the last intercolle
giate contest to suc
ceed Captain Gard
as skipper of the
1915 Varsity. The
election took place
immediately after
the snapping of the
team picture Sun
day morning at
Franklin's photo
graph studio.
The captain-elect
is one of the most
popular and experi
enced ruggers who

intercollegiate game. In 1910 he vis
ited this country as a member of the
famous Wallabies, who toured the
world, and never suffered a defeat.
The year following he played a wing
position on the invading Waratahs. Al
though the youngest player on either
of these teams, composed of stars, he
was always heralded as a player of
wonderful ability.
Carroll is a member of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon. Civil Engineering is his
major study. He hails from Sidney,
Australia.
