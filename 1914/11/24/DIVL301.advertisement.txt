Why Should I Smoke
TUXEDO?
TUXEDO is the logical smoke for
millionaires because it is impos
sible to buy a better tobacco.
Tuxedo is the logical smoke for
the economical man because there
are 40 pipefuls in a ten-cent tin—
making the average cost per pipeful
only one-fourth of a centl
To buy cheaper tobacco means to
get less pleasure out of smoking,
because it is impossible to make a
tobacco as good as Tuxedo at less
than the Tuxedo price/
The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
Tuxedo is made of only the finest,
choicest selected leaves of perfectly
aged Burley tobacco. It is made
by the original "Tuxedo Process"
which takes all the ////pleasantness
out of tobacco and leaves all the
pleasantness in!
Tuxedo has a deliciously mild, fragrant
aroma that is pleasant to all. It is the only
tobacco you can smoke in a room full of lace
curtains without leaving even a trace of odor.
A trial will convince you that Tuxedo is
superior to every other tobacco you have ever
smoked. Buy a tin—today.
YOU CAN BUY TUXEDO EVERYWHERE

ex-Governor, New Mexico
'' Tuxedo appeals to we
strongly on account of its
cool, mild, pleasant flavor.
Therein lies its superiority to
all other tobaccos."

Why Should I Smoke
TUXEDO?
TUXEDO is the logical smoke for
millionaires because it is impos
sible to buy a better tobacco.
Tuxedo is the logical smoke for
the economical man because there
are 40 pipefuls in a ten-cent tin—
making the average cost per pipeful
only one-fourth of a centl
To buy cheaper tobacco means to
get less pleasure out of smoking,
because it is impossible to make a
tobacco as good as Tuxedo at less
than the Tuxedo price/
The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
Tuxedo is made of only the finest,
choicest selected leaves of perfectly
aged Burley tobacco. It is made
by the original "Tuxedo Process"
which takes all the ////pleasantness
out of tobacco and leaves all the
pleasantness in!
Tuxedo has a deliciously mild, fragrant
aroma that is pleasant to all. It is the only
tobacco you can smoke in a room full of lace
curtains without leaving even a trace of odor.
A trial will convince you that Tuxedo is
superior to every other tobacco you have ever
smoked. Buy a tin—today.
YOU CAN BUY TUXEDO EVERYWHERE
GEO. CURRY
ex-Governor, New Mexico
'' Tuxedo appeals to we
strongly on account of its
cool, mild, pleasant flavor.
Therein lies its superiority to
all other tobaccos."
STANTON WARBURTON

"My own experience leads
