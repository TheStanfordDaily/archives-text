### 
Moving pictures of the Big Game
will be shown at the Varsity Theater
on next Monday, affording Stanford
students the opportunity of seeing
again the Cardinal Varsity humble the
Blue and Cold fifteen. Only this time
the game may be viewed from various
different vantage points.
Some of the films were photo
graphed from the top of the bleachers,
and these will show the united play
of the two teams, giving occasional
glimpses of the rival rooting sections
in the background.
Others, taken but a few feet f.rom
the scene of action, reveal the details
of the bitter fighting in the scrum
and line-outs, and personal bits seen
only by the lens of the movie camera.
The films are the best taken of a
Stanford-California game, the clear,
bright day being ideal for photograph
ic work.
The pictures have been shown
around the Bay for the past week, and
have been attracting large crowds.
The manager of the Varsity Theater
announces that the Big Game pictures
