# Ram's Head Will Stage "Razmataz" in San Jose
## Campus Comedians to Present Two Performances at Victory Theatre December 8 and 9. 
### 
Impressed by the success of the re
cent Ram's Head production, "Rout
ing Razmataz," the San Jose Elks
have secured the campus organization
to stage their annual Christmas Jinks
for the benefit of the Elks' Empty
Stocking Fund. Ram's Head will pre
sent their laughter-provoking bur
lesque for two performances on the
evenings of December 8 and 9 in the
Victory Theatre, San Jose.
"Routing Razmataz" has been
strengthened and elaborated by the
addition of several clever specialties,
and many new scenic effects. The big
fun-show has been entirely revised,
the authors having profited by the
first night performance 011 the campus,
when several opportunities for im
provement were discovered.
The Elks of San Jose are planning
elaborate entertainment for the col
lege comedians during their visit in
the Garden City. The annual Christ
mas Jinks is the social event of the
theatrical year in San Jose, and two
capacity houses are assured. These
performances of "Routing Razmataz"
will afford those of the University
public who failed to witness the initial
production on the campus an opportu
nity to see the show in its new version.
Among the members of Ram's Head
who will appear in their original .roles
are B. M. Lasky, '12, W. B. Forbes, '15,
.T. A. Gibbs, '15, J. R. Morgan, '16. and
B. M. Melvin, '17.
