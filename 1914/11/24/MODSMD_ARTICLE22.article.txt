# Thanksgiving in 1914
## 
### 
Old Earth will spin again on its axis,
and in this western land we'll leave
the sun behind to greet it once more
on Thanksgiving mo.rn. Thanksgiving
in 1914—since there first were
thoughts of humanity's debt to a Greater
Power, a day has not found the world
so full of hate and human slaughter.
The voice of thankfulness seems lost
in the sweeping flood of Europe's
debacle—along the edge on America's
safe ground we give thanks that we
are clear of the maelstrom.
So in the glow of comfort and plen
ty, in the fun and feasting of our
Thanksgiving holidays—we'll enjoy
them none the less if trimmings and
fixings have gone to the halfworld
that's in hunger—there is a time to
remember the other humans who suf
fer while we play. In past days our
thoughts have not been idle sympathies
or smug hypocrisies, for the "Camino"
sails within the week loaded to the
hatches with life-giving food. And new
roads to genuine help have been
opened and will be kept clear for the
six months to come —a Thanksgiving
contribution is a wonderful aid to the
first month's vehicle of succor. The
way lies through the treasurer of the
campus committee.
