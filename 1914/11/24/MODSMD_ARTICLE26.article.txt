# Father Coyote

### 
Lovers of the outdoor and sons of
ou.r California prairies will find a
homely rythm in this verse by George
Sterling, the Carmel-by-the-Sea poet.
His knack is of using exactly the right
words about beasts:
At twilight time when lamps are lit,
Father coyote comes to sit
At the chapparal's edge, 011 the moun
tain side —
Comes, to listen and to deride
The rancher's hound and the ranch
er's son,
The passer-by and every one.
And we pause at milking-time to hear
His reckless carolling, shrill and
clear —
His terse and swift and valorous troll,
Ribald, rollicking, scornful, droll,
As one might sing in coyotedom:
"Yo ho 110 and a bottle of rum!"
Yet well I wot there is little ease
Where the turkeys roost in the almond
trees,
But mute forbodings, canny and grim,
As they shift and shiver along the
limb.
And the dog flings back an answer
brief
(Curse o' the honest man on the thief),
And the cat, till now intent to rove,
Stalks to her chair by the kitchen
stove;
Not that she fears the rogue on the
hill;
But—no mice remain, and —the night
is chill.
And now, like a watchman of the
skies,
Whose glance to a thousand valleys
flies,
The moon glares over the granite
ledge—
Pared a slice on its upper edge.
And father coyote waits no more,
Knowing that down on the valley floor,
In a sandy nook, cool and white,
The rabbits play, and the rabbits
fight.
Flopping, nimbly, skurrying,
Careless now with the surge of spring.
Furry lover, alack, alas!
Skims your fate o'er the moonlit
grass!
