"How to read war news" is the sub
ject of an interesting and instructive
article in the Independent for Novem
ber 9. The directions follow:
This news is mostly from the fol
lowing sources: First, the official
statements given out every day by the
various governments, generally cor
rect as to facts, but often misleading
by inference. Second, the expansion
sometimes expert, sometimes absurdly
incompetent. Third, the reports of
such few correspondents as have been
permitted to get near the front in
France and Belgium, usually censored
and dealing with minor engagements
and personal experiences. Fourth, in
formation gathered from conversations
with fugitives, wounded soldiers, un
wary officers and the people of a
place; the source of the wildest ru
mors as well as the most picturesque
details. Fifth, the stories of return
ing Americans, uncensored but telling
little except about the condition of the
country where they were. The news
from all these sources is bandied about
from country to country, amplified,
condensed > combined and re-echoed so
that often the same events appears at
different times in half a dozen distort
ed forms.
Fortunately our dailies are much
more careful, since the war began, to
put the correct date and place on their
news than they used to be. If we
should classify the sources of the
news according to their presumptive
reliability we should arrange them in
this order: Berlin, Paris, London,
Petrograd, Vienna, Nlsh. Rome. That
the dispatches that come direct from
Berlin by wireless through the Sayville
station contain fewer canards than the
news from elspwhere is partly due to
the fact that they are so scanty. They
consist of a few brief statements of
things actually accomplished and these

have generally been verified later.
The censorship in England is more
strict than that in France or Russia
and the English papers are loud in
their complaints that they are not al
lowed to reprint what has already ap
peared in the French and Russian
journals.
We hear very little from the Aus
trian side about the fighting in Galicia,
but from the Russian capital we get
long and circumstantial accounts of a
series of Russian victories which pre
sumably are no more accurate than the
news that used to come from the same
source during the Russo-Japanese war.
We learned how little we could trust
Servian statements from the inves
tigation of the Balkan war by the Ca:-
negie Commission. The custom of the
Serbs to claim the killing of ten thou
sand Austrians in every battle does not
inspire confidence. Rome emanates or
disseminates extravagant stories of all
sorts.
No one can understand military
movements without constant reference
to a map. History is animated geog
raphy, and it is often more important
to know where an event took place
than when.

should classify the sources of the
news according to their presumptive
reliability we should arrange them in
this order: Berlin, Paris, London,
Petrograd, Vienna, Nlsh. Rome. That
the dispatches that come direct from
Berlin by wireless through the Sayville
station contain fewer canards than the
news from elspwhere is partly due to
the fact that they are so scanty. They
consist of a few brief statements of
things actually accomplished and these

have generally been verified later.
The censorship in England is more
strict than that in France or Russia
and the English papers are loud in
their complaints that they are not al
lowed to reprint what has already ap
peared in the French and Russian
journals.
We hear very little from the Aus
trian side about the fighting in Galicia,
but from the Russian capital we get
long and circumstantial accounts of a
series of Russian victories which pre
sumably are no more accurate than the
news that used to come from the same
source during the Russo-Japanese war.
We learned how little we could trust
Servian statements from the inves
tigation of the Balkan war by the Ca:-
negie Commission. The custom of the
Serbs to claim the killing of ten thou
sand Austrians in every battle does not
inspire confidence. Rome emanates or
disseminates extravagant stories of all
sorts.
No one can understand military
movements without constant reference
to a map. History is animated geog
raphy, and it is often more important
to know where an event took place
than when.
"How to read war news" is the sub
ject of an interesting and instructive
article in the Independent for Novem
ber 9. The directions follow:
This news is mostly from the fol
lowing sources: First, the official
statements given out every day by the
various governments, generally cor
rect as to facts, but often misleading
by inference. Second, the expansion
sometimes expert, sometimes absurdly
incompetent. Third, the reports of
such few correspondents as have been
permitted to get near the front in
France and Belgium, usually censored
and dealing with minor engagements
and personal experiences. Fourth, in
formation gathered from conversations
with fugitives, wounded soldiers, un
wary officers and the people of a
place; the source of the wildest ru
mors as well as the most picturesque
details. Fifth, the stories of return
ing Americans, uncensored but telling
little except about the condition of the
country where they were. The news
from all these sources is bandied about
from country to country, amplified,
condensed > combined and re-echoed so
that often the same events appears at
different times in half a dozen distort
ed forms.
Fortunately our dailies are much
more careful, since the war began, to
put the correct date and place on their
news than they used to be. If we
should classify the sources of the
news according to their presumptive
reliability we should arrange them in
