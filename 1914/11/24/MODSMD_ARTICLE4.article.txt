# STANFORD MASCOT CIRCUS IS VERY LATEST NOTION
## Variety Enough in Campus Pets to Make Up Show for Belgian Benefit. 
### 
Now for the "very latest," a Stanford
Circus, for the benefit of the Belgian
sufferers.
It is rumored in elite circles among
the exclusive fifty-seven varieties of
pets on the campus that the mascots
of the college are smitten with the
spirit of philanthropy that has invad
ed Stanford, and wish to give some
stunts.
That there is material galore for a
well-rounded circus is shown when
one considers who's who in the social
sets of University pets.
A brief musical number by Woof,
the Kappa Sigma dog, and Madaline,
the Chi Psi cat, would make a hit
with any audience. Tt has been sug
gested that the Delta Tau Delta snake
could do a Morgan-Lasky waltz with
Ignatz, the Phi Psi ant-eater.
For a jungle stunt, Ketchup, the
Cardinal Club salamander, could be
persuaded to co-operate with Bos'n,
the D. U. monkey, and Sadie, the
trained potato bug, said to be living
loose in the Arboretum.
Davy .Tones, the pet star fish of the
Zoology Department, and Quack, the
Roble Chinks' duck, could work some
aquatic features, including high div
ing into a glass tank. They could be
assisted by the S. A. E. alligator, who
is also an adept in the water.
Then the circus could be fittingly
ended with a chariot race or two
pulled off with t'ie trained white rats
of the Medical Department.
There are other pets of the campus
that could be used in such a stunt, it
is said, and the whole show could be
in charge of Poll, the D. U. parrot,
who would make a fine announcer.
Anyway, the Belgians wouldn't ob
ject.
