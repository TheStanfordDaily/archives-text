# Evergreens Will Relieve Bareness of Quadrangle
## Planting of Trees and Shrubs Is Part of Scheme to Beautify Grounds. 
### 
For the purpose of relieving the
bare spots in the outer quadrangle,
and to lessen in some degree the for
bidding aspect of its brown sand stono,
the University authorities have author
ized the securing and planting of ev
ergreen trees and shrubs about the
building. This is the realization of a
plan of beautification which Farm
Superintendent Hewston has had in
mind for some time.
At present trees are being placed in
the space around the walls of the
buildings, but later on it is intended
to put them in the bare open places,
as well.
No preconceived plan of decoration
has been followed, and a variety of
trees will in all probability be used.
The trees which are being planted
now, however, are Italian cypresses,
and are adapted to the position in
which they are being placed. Decora
tive eve.rgreen shrubs are being plant
ed between the trees, to relieve the
monotony which would result from
the use of but one variety.
