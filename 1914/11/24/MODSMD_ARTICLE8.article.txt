# THANKSGIVING SOCCER MATCH TO BE STAGED WITH BLUE AND GOLD
## New Cardinal Material Will Line Up Against the Blue and Gold Veterans on Local Field in Second Intercollegiate Game HARD MATCH ANTICIPATED 
### 
The first soccer game of the season
on Stanford Field will be staged on
Thanksgoving Day, when the Cardinal
soccer men will line-up against the
lilue and Gold players in the second
game of the intercollegiate series.
In the trans-bay match, played off
two weeks ago, Stanford sprang the
surprise of the day by walking away
with the long end of a 2 to 0 score.
But Thursday's game will bring the
California eleven down here with a
clearer realization of the strength of
their red-jerseyed opponents than thay
had last time, and the chances are for
a hard, close match.
Intercollegiate soccer history shows
a series of straight wins fo.r the Car
dinal. California has yet to record
her first soccer victory, and will make
a strong bid for the honors 011 Thurs
day.
The Blue and Gold team shows prac
tically a veteran line-up, whereas the
Cardinal aggregation depends to a
large extent on new material. The
line-up to be announced tomorrow
should read practically as in tilts
of two weeks ago. though there is
still a possibility that the Stanford
ranks will be strengthened by the
presence of Erb and Carroll.
The two rugby stars have already
won their circle "S's" in soccer
against California in the games taking
place after the close of the rugby sea
son last year.
The game on Thursday will take
place at 10:30 on the Stanford turf.
