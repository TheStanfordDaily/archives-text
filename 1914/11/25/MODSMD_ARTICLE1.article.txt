# RED-JERSEYED ELEVEN MEETS CALIFORNIA IN SOCCER GAME THURSDAY
## SECOND MATCH OF YEAR Struggle Will Be Staged on the Rugby Turf Thanksgiving Dayâ€”Close Game Is Expected 
### 
Eleven Cardinal soccerites have been
named by Trainer Maloney, Captain
Blodget, and ex-Captain Higgins to
meet the Blue and Gold tomorrow in
the second intercollegiate match of the
season. The line-up is practically the
same as that announced for the last
game against California, but the pres
ence of Danny Carroll and Art Erb
will decidedly strengthen the Stanford
combination. These two rugby stars
are also veterans of the soccer field,
both having played intercollegiate soc
cer in former years. Erb has appeared
in the Cardinal ranks of the English
game for three years.
Eight players from the winning team
of two weeks ago will line up against
California Thursday. The forward line
will present a formidable barrier to
Bine and Gold aggression. At outside
right Carroll will make his presenr-e
felt with his clever dribbling and ac
curate boot. Shaw, whose fast game
at wing in the last match was a fea
ture of the Cardinal play, will be un
able to enter the match on account of
a fractured nose, sustained in a prac
tice game. Higgins will again play at
inside right, and his well-placed shots
for goal should once more shift the
balance on the scare hoard in Stan
ford's favor. Captain Blodget will also
give the California goal-keeper some
anxious moments, and with his team
mate, Higgins, should prove a scoring
factor in the Thanksgiving Day strug
gle.
Erb, who has proven his worth in in
tercollegiate soccer before this, will
fill the inside left position in this vet
e.ran forward division. Kyle wil lplay
outside left again, and if he comes up
to his performance of two weeks ago
should prove as dangerous a player
as any wearing the Cardinal. Kyle is
a Freshman, and has been doing bril
liant work at wing this fall.
The half-back division will show
Cass, Boyle, and Alderton at the guns.
Cass fills the berth at left half and
can be counted on for his usual de
pendable game. Boyle has shown him
self to be an able center half, both in
attack and defense. Alderton appears
in the line-up for the first time to take
the position at right half, which was
filled by Vanderburg in the struggle
on the fourteenth. Vanderbu.rg is kept
out of the game by a sprained ankle,
but Alderton has shown up well in
practice, and can be looked to play a
steady game.
The fullbacks are the same as for
the last game. Button and Adams will
again be looked to toblock any Califor
nia attack in the backfield. Both were
instrumental in keeping the California
end of the last score down to a zero.
Button's game is more spectacular
than that of his team-mate, but Adams'
boot is sure, and his defense practical
ly impassable.
Ring will for the second time this
year guard the Stanford net against
possible California invasion, and he
can again be depended upon for his
cool and timely saves.
California will send the same eleven
men into the game who played two
weeks ago against the Cardinal. This
time they will be prepared to fight
to the last ditch, and should give the
