# The 						Honor System
## 
### 
Periodically the question of adopting
the "honor system" at Stanford conies
up for discussion. Just at present, the
matter has been laid aside by the two
student conferences. They have de
cided that we are not ready for the
"honor system." These rulings, to
gether with the fact that the membe.rs
of the faculty have not seen fit to
adopt the "system," show that the stu
dents are not worthy of the trust.
It is evident to all that the honor
element would be lost entirely if com
bined with faculty supervision and stu
dent control. I3oth methods of control
have been tried and the fact that cheat
ing continues, goes to prove that neith
er has been successful.
We have in the Law Department a
perfect example of an efficient "honor
system," in which sentiment is the
only judiciary. Everything rests with
the students of the departments, who
are, it is true, older men studying for
a profession which is perhaps of more
vital interest to them than the work of
those in other departments. But the
fact remains that the students them
selves create the sentiment that main
tains the "honor principle."
What is to be done to prepare the
students in other departments for the
adoption of the "hono.r system?" It is
obvious that a similar feeling to that
which exists among the legal students
must be aroused. Until this exists,
faculty supervision will coutinue and
the "honor system" cannot be in
stalled.
It is up to each individual man and
woman in the University to do his or
her part towards this end. We would
venture the suggestion that the feel
ing would be greatly strengthened '112
cheating were not regarded as a joke.
Many students consider it a smart trick
to "slip it over on the prof" who
watches them in examinations or to
pass in second-hand compositions and
papers. Both of these offenses are se
rious and the "honor system" would be
well established if the students would
cease to regard them as a joke.
