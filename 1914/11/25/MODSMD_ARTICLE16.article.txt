# Education and Co.
## 
### 
The following poem from the versa
tile pen of Miss Dare Stark, '17, is an
excellent example of the lighter style
of this rising writer of our community.
Miss Stark made her start in the world
in the pursuit of Composition 2 in the
English department. Her more serious
poetic works have graced the pages
of our leading magazine—the Sequoia;
and her lighter efforts have found their
sphere in the pages of the Chaparral,
Here she airs her opinions (also ours)
on the ever-absorbing subject of co
education:
We hark with them to lectures all the
year,
We lend and borrow note-books after
class,
We sem with them, we meet with
them everywhere,
In lab, and hall and Libe we daily
pass,
We write the same old blue-books,
same old exes.
We share their honors—yet they seem
to know,
With calm elation nothing ever vexes,
That they are Education and we're
Co.
So here's to you, brother-student,, with
your prowess and your press,
You can call us what you want to, and
we'll like you none the less;
But the clay we run the Daily—on that
one wee day we'll show
That for once we're Education and
you are strictly Co.
—DARE STARK, '17.
