# "What of Education?"

### 
An article written by Zona Gale,
bearing the above title, appeared in
the July edition for 1914 of the Atlantic
Monthly. The following is an extract
taken from it:
If we put faith in what we see of co
education, we are of course obliged to
admit that after fifty years and more
of experimentation in America the
effect of co-education on the student
undergoing it is not wholly desirable.
Similarly, after unaccounted thousands
of years of living, the experiment of in
dividuation is not always operative to
develop the Substance so expressed.
Again it befalls that a portion of the
student body is drawn into a social life
which comes to exist almost independ
ently of anybody's wanting it there.
Tint even as we now practice it, my
contention is whole-heartedly that the
reactions of co-educational life, its in
sufficient social life included, are emi
nently more healthful than otherwise.
We used to discuss the effect of four
years of masculine criticism upon the
manners, conversation, and dress of
young women. That was natural, for
men were in possession and women, as
late-comers, were suhject to doctrine,
reproof, and correction. At first we ex
pected nothing new, but looked mere
ly for the repetition of the ancient,
simple process of women's wish to
please, somewhat intensified by con
tstant association. Rut gradually a new
thing became evident.
The ruling passion of the university
women was identical with the ruling
passion of the university: develop
ment.
The type of woman who seeks a uni
versity education is not there to win
out in competitive standings. Tn fact,
she has begun to see that averages, and
degrees themselves, have no great im
port. even as symbols. Rather, these
women are beginning to have a
of life, as such, and to relate to it
their university experience. Not the
"socially fit," perhaps, and not always
the grinds: merely the majority.
The healthful and diseased reactions
cf co-educational life are identical with
the healthful and diseased reactions of
society, and they are not other. The
reactions of co-educational life, as if
life, are more healthful than diseased.
To find what is wrong with co-educa
tional .reactions, we must look to so
society and prevent the evil there.
The humanizing of social relations,
â€”this is what we are about today.
We are developing means of bringing
it to pass: the quite dazzling under

standing that our ills are economic;
revised conceptions of industrialism;
legislation and administration looking
to human rights; suffrage for women,
who, are in their turn emerging, as
group after group of men has emerged,
into citizenship; the beginning of un
commercialized recreation; and, at the
threshold of them all, co-education.
