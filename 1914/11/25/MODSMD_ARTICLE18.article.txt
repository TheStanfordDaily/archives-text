Stanford University, California,
November 23, 1914.
Dear Editor:
1 am a close reader of your valuable
paper, "The Daily Palo Alto," but for
several months I have not seen any
comments on the dancing question. 1
think the last attention which was
called to the matter was when "On the
Quiet" tried to joke about it. Now
I'm all for fun myself, it helps my dys
pepsia, but sometimes those jokes
should be a little more on the Q. T.
But to come back to what I started
to say. 1 think that dancing ought to
be a minor sport. Of course, as far as
real athletics goes it deserves a
block "S," and. although it might cause
some rivalry with the tennis and chess
clubs, I think there would still be
peace on the farm if it were to be given
its due recognition.
Dancing has been practiced ever
since the University was founded.
Some have been fairly proficient in it
before they came to Stanford. Look
at the time spent on the exercise. Who
will gainsay the benefits resulting
from the hours spent thus?
Since everyone cannot be granted
the honor of making the "S," T would
suggest that a competent committee
be appointed to pass on the candi
dates. Hoping this will meet with
your approval, I am,
Very truly yours,
FLUFFY RUFFLES.
