# WOKEN PLAN TO OPEN CLUB HOUSE ON FIRST OF EXPOSITION YEAR
## Building Practically Ready for Occupation Is Report of the Club House Committee. 
### 
January first is to see the opening
of the Woman's Clubhouse, according
to the latest report of the board of
directors. The progress made in the
last few months, in spite of unavoid
able obstacles, has been truly remark
able, and the women of the University
will undoubtedly take possession by
the first of the year.
The .rather remarkable tint of the
window sashes has been a matter of
much discussion. It has been called
almost every color from green and tur
ciuo seâ€”but it might be well to suggest
that those of doubtful opinion educate
their artistic sense by information on
the subject. The clubhouse commit
tee has been very fortunate in obtain
ing this special shade known as ceru
lean blue, as copied from the famous
mission buildings of Europe.
The plan of the clubhouse is excep
tional in its completeness. The de
signers have supplied every facility for
the comfort and convenience of the
Stanford women. Though the entire
clubhouse will not be completed, it
will be .ready for use by New Years.
