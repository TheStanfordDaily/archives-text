# INTERVARSITY SOCCER WON BY STANFORD
## Cardinal Eleven Registers Clean Cut Victory WILLIAMSON CUP ACQUIRED Team Is Now Tied With Celtic Club For Championship of Expositionâ€”League Is to Be Formed 
### 
Ploughing their way through the
most determined Blue and Gold de
fense, the Cardinal soccer eleven reg
istered their second victory over Cali
fornia this season with a score of 3 t.o
0. The red-jerseyed men conclusively
proved their superiority in all depart
ments of the game, and the win wa<s
well-earned.
California Forfeits Third Game.
According to a proposition ad
vanced by California at the opening
of the soccer season this year, the two
universities agreed that if one team
should win the two fall matches the
lose.r should consider the third match
as also forfeit, and should, without
further competition, accord the win
ner the title to the whole series. Thus

Stanford has once more annexed the
intercollegiate soccer title, and the
game against California originally
planned for Washington's birthday
will not be staged.
Stanford Owner of Williamson Trophy.
In addition to the winning of the
straight intercollegiat series, this
game lias fulfilled the the conditions
for retaining the Williamson soccer
trophy, for which the rival colleges
have been competing during several
seasons. The cup was given by C. Y.
Williamson, of the Barbarian Club, v>
be the permanent possession of the
university winning the majority of ten
games. Stanford was practically as
sured of the possession of the trophy
last year when the Cardinal eleven
fought through a victorious soccer
series, but the requisite ten contests
had not yet been played.
The two games this fall raise the
total of Stanford victories to six.
Three tie matches have been played
between the .rival colleges, and the
February final, which was to have
made the tenth intercollegiate strug
gle for the Williamson cup. has, by the
California proposal to default, given
Stanford the title to seven victories.
This gives the trophy into the perma
nent possession of the Cardinal.
Tie for Leagne Championship.
The Thanksgiving day victory gives
Stanford one other claim to local soc
cer laurels. It has given the Cardinal
team ascendency over the Blue and
Gold in the race for the champion
ship of the Exposition Soeoe.r League,
of which both the college teams are
members. This league, formed this
fall, is composed of five elevens, Cal

ifornia, Stanford, and the Olympic,
Barbarian, and Celtic Clubs. The
Celtics have thus far proven them
selves first in the race for honors,
but Stanford's victory on Thursday
has tied the college and the club foi
highest place. The final game of the
season will therefore be a league
championship match between the Car
dinal and Celtics for the possession of
the trophy offered by Spalding Broth
ers. This contest will probably be
staged next Saturday on the Stanford
turf. Trainer Maloney, who holds the
presidency of the Exposition League,
is at present making arrangements for
the match.
Cardinal Outplays Blue and Gold.
Thursday's game proved conclu
sively that Stanford's title to inter
collegiate soccer supremacy is any
thing but unearned. Unlike the first
match of the year, when the Cardinal
was kept on the defensive, in spite of
the contradictory evidence of a 2 to 0
scores, this second game found the
red-jerseyed eleven outplaying thoir
opponents at all points. Time and
again long dribbling rushes by the
Cardinal forwards put the Blue and
Gold on the defensive and kept the
full-backs and goal-keeper warm
through the full period of play.
California Opens Aggressively.
In the first half, Higgins kicked off
for Stanford. The visitors opened ag
gressively and their first onslaught
seemed to promise a repetition of the
general character of the play exhibit
ed on the fourteenth, but the Stanford
eleven soon caught the stride and
sent the ball hurtling into California
territory to remain there during most
of the game. Alternate exhibitions of
pretty dribbling by the forwards and
of spectacular saves in the danger
zone characterized the first part of
the play. Following the prevention of
a Blue and Cold tally on account of
an off-side play, came a few minutes
of hard play during which both goals
were more than once threatened. A Cal
ifornia free kick was tellingly blocked
by Boyle, who sent, the ball into Blue
and Gold territory. Blodget inter

cepted a pass intended for a Califor
nia forward, and with a neat shot
found the net for California's first
score. Following this score Shafer,
guarding the California goal, was
forced by Higgins to make one of the
cleverest saves of the day.
Second Score Pretty Exhibition.
One of the prettiest bits of play in
the game resulted in Stanford's sec
ond tally. A rush for the California
goal started by Cass was featured by
a clever try for the net by Erb. When
Shafer succeeded in blocking this,
Erb's attack on the right was supple
mented by one from the center, in
augurated by Higgins and Blodget.
Shafer again responded with a neat
save, and the Cardinal assault was
shifted to the left where Kyle, the
speedy wing, sent the ball crashing
into the net for the last score of the
first period of play.
Even play featured the first part of
the second half, Blodget putting the
California goal in danger by more
than one well-timed shot. Stanford's
final score was the result of a thi.rty
five-yard dribbling rush by Erb, who
shot past the waiting goal-keeper for
the point which made the score board
read: Stanford 3, California 0.

Erb's attack on the right was supple
mented by one from the center, in
augurated by Higgins and Blodget.
Shafer again responded with a neat
save, and the Cardinal assault was
shifted to the left where Kyle, the
speedy wing, sent the ball crashing
into the net for the last score of the
first period of play.
Even play featured the first part of
the second half, Blodget putting the
California goal in danger by more
than one well-timed shot. Stanford's
final score was the result of a thi.rty
five-yard dribbling rush by Erb, who
shot past the waiting goal-keeper for
the point which made the score board
read: Stanford 3, California 0.
Ploughing their way through the
most determined Blue and Gold de
fense, the Cardinal soccer eleven reg
istered their second victory over Cali
fornia this season with a score of 3 t.o
0. The red-jerseyed men conclusively
proved their superiority in all depart
ments of the game, and the win wa<s
well-earned.
California Forfeits Third Game.
According to a proposition ad
vanced by California at the opening
of the soccer season this year, the two
universities agreed that if one team
should win the two fall matches the
lose.r should consider the third match
as also forfeit, and should, without
further competition, accord the win
ner the title to the whole series. Thus

Stanford has once more annexed the
intercollegiate soccer title, and the
game against California originally
planned for Washington's birthday
will not be staged.
Stanford Owner of Williamson Trophy.
In addition to the winning of the
straight intercollegiat series, this
game lias fulfilled the the conditions
for retaining the Williamson soccer
trophy, for which the rival colleges
have been competing during several
seasons. The cup was given by C. Y.
Williamson, of the Barbarian Club, v>
be the permanent possession of the
university winning the majority of ten
games. Stanford was practically as
sured of the possession of the trophy
last year when the Cardinal eleven
fought through a victorious soccer
series, but the requisite ten contests
had not yet been played.
The two games this fall raise the
total of Stanford victories to six.
Three tie matches have been played
between the .rival colleges, and the
February final, which was to have
made the tenth intercollegiate strug
gle for the Williamson cup. has, by the
California proposal to default, given
Stanford the title to seven victories.
This gives the trophy into the perma
nent possession of the Cardinal.
Tie for Leagne Championship.
The Thanksgiving day victory gives
Stanford one other claim to local soc
cer laurels. It has given the Cardinal
team ascendency over the Blue and
Gold in the race for the champion
ship of the Exposition Soeoe.r League,
of which both the college teams are
members. This league, formed this
fall, is composed of five elevens, Cal

ifornia, Stanford, and the Olympic,
Barbarian, and Celtic Clubs. The
Celtics have thus far proven them
selves first in the race for honors,
but Stanford's victory on Thursday
has tied the college and the club foi
highest place. The final game of the
season will therefore be a league
championship match between the Car
dinal and Celtics for the possession of
the trophy offered by Spalding Broth
ers. This contest will probably be
staged next Saturday on the Stanford
turf. Trainer Maloney, who holds the
presidency of the Exposition League,
is at present making arrangements for
the match.
Cardinal Outplays Blue and Gold.
Thursday's game proved conclu
sively that Stanford's title to inter
collegiate soccer supremacy is any
thing but unearned. Unlike the first
match of the year, when the Cardinal
was kept on the defensive, in spite of
the contradictory evidence of a 2 to 0
scores, this second game found the
red-jerseyed eleven outplaying thoir
opponents at all points. Time and
again long dribbling rushes by the
Cardinal forwards put the Blue and
Gold on the defensive and kept the
full-backs and goal-keeper warm
through the full period of play.
California Opens Aggressively.
In the first half, Higgins kicked off
for Stanford. The visitors opened ag
gressively and their first onslaught
seemed to promise a repetition of the
general character of the play exhibit
ed on the fourteenth, but the Stanford
eleven soon caught the stride and
sent the ball hurtling into California
territory to remain there during most
of the game. Alternate exhibitions of
pretty dribbling by the forwards and
of spectacular saves in the danger
zone characterized the first part of
the play. Following the prevention of
a Blue and Cold tally on account of
an off-side play, came a few minutes
of hard play during which both goals
were more than once threatened. A Cal
ifornia free kick was tellingly blocked
by Boyle, who sent, the ball into Blue
and Gold territory. Blodget inter

cepted a pass intended for a Califor
nia forward, and with a neat shot
found the net for California's first
score. Following this score Shafer,
guarding the California goal, was
forced by Higgins to make one of the
cleverest saves of the day.
Second Score Pretty Exhibition.
One of the prettiest bits of play in
the game resulted in Stanford's sec
ond tally. A rush for the California
goal started by Cass was featured by
a clever try for the net by Erb. When
Shafer succeeded in blocking this,
Erb's attack on the right was supple
mented by one from the center, in
augurated by Higgins and Blodget.

by Boyle, who sent, the ball into Blue
and Gold territory. Blodget inter

cepted a pass intended for a Califor
nia forward, and with a neat shot
found the net for California's first
score. Following this score Shafer,
guarding the California goal, was
forced by Higgins to make one of the
cleverest saves of the day.
Second Score Pretty Exhibition.
One of the prettiest bits of play in
the game resulted in Stanford's sec
ond tally. A rush for the California
goal started by Cass was featured by
a clever try for the net by Erb. When
Shafer succeeded in blocking this,
Erb's attack on the right was supple
mented by one from the center, in
augurated by Higgins and Blodget.
Shafer again responded with a neat
save, and the Cardinal assault was
shifted to the left where Kyle, the
speedy wing, sent the ball crashing
into the net for the last score of the
first period of play.
Even play featured the first part of
the second half, Blodget putting the
California goal in danger by more
than one well-timed shot. Stanford's
final score was the result of a thi.rty
five-yard dribbling rush by Erb, who
shot past the waiting goal-keeper for
the point which made the score board
read: Stanford 3, California 0.
Ploughing their way through the
most determined Blue and Gold de
fense, the Cardinal soccer eleven reg
istered their second victory over Cali
fornia this season with a score of 3 t.o
0. The red-jerseyed men conclusively
proved their superiority in all depart
ments of the game, and the win wa<s
well-earned.
California Forfeits Third Game.
According to a proposition ad
vanced by California at the opening
of the soccer season this year, the two
universities agreed that if one team
should win the two fall matches the
lose.r should consider the third match
as also forfeit, and should, without
further competition, accord the win
ner the title to the whole series. Thus

Stanford has once more annexed the
intercollegiate soccer title, and the
game against California originally
planned for Washington's birthday
will not be staged.
Stanford Owner of Williamson Trophy.
In addition to the winning of the
straight intercollegiat series, this
game lias fulfilled the the conditions
for retaining the Williamson soccer
trophy, for which the rival colleges
have been competing during several
seasons. The cup was given by C. Y.
Williamson, of the Barbarian Club, v>
be the permanent possession of the
university winning the majority of ten
games. Stanford was practically as
sured of the possession of the trophy
last year when the Cardinal eleven
fought through a victorious soccer
series, but the requisite ten contests
had not yet been played.
The two games this fall raise the
total of Stanford victories to six.
Three tie matches have been played
between the .rival colleges, and the
February final, which was to have
made the tenth intercollegiate strug
gle for the Williamson cup. has, by the
California proposal to default, given
Stanford the title to seven victories.
This gives the trophy into the perma
nent possession of the Cardinal.
Tie for Leagne Championship.
The Thanksgiving day victory gives
Stanford one other claim to local soc
cer laurels. It has given the Cardinal
team ascendency over the Blue and
Gold in the race for the champion
ship of the Exposition Soeoe.r League,
of which both the college teams are
members. This league, formed this
fall, is composed of five elevens, Cal

ifornia, Stanford, and the Olympic,
Barbarian, and Celtic Clubs. The
Celtics have thus far proven them
selves first in the race for honors,
but Stanford's victory on Thursday
has tied the college and the club foi
highest place. The final game of the
season will therefore be a league
championship match between the Car
dinal and Celtics for the possession of
the trophy offered by Spalding Broth
ers. This contest will probably be
staged next Saturday on the Stanford
turf. Trainer Maloney, who holds the
presidency of the Exposition League,
is at present making arrangements for
the match.
Cardinal Outplays Blue and Gold.
Thursday's game proved conclu
sively that Stanford's title to inter
collegiate soccer supremacy is any
thing but unearned. Unlike the first
match of the year, when the Cardinal
was kept on the defensive, in spite of
the contradictory evidence of a 2 to 0
scores, this second game found the
red-jerseyed eleven outplaying thoir
opponents at all points. Time and
again long dribbling rushes by the
Cardinal forwards put the Blue and
Gold on the defensive and kept the
full-backs and goal-keeper warm
through the full period of play.
California Opens Aggressively.
In the first half, Higgins kicked off
for Stanford. The visitors opened ag
gressively and their first onslaught
seemed to promise a repetition of the
general character of the play exhibit
ed on the fourteenth, but the Stanford
eleven soon caught the stride and
sent the ball hurtling into California
territory to remain there during most
of the game. Alternate exhibitions of
pretty dribbling by the forwards and
of spectacular saves in the danger
zone characterized the first part of
the play. Following the prevention of
a Blue and Cold tally on account of
an off-side play, came a few minutes
of hard play during which both goals
were more than once threatened. A Cal
ifornia free kick was tellingly blocked
by Boyle, who sent, the ball into Blue
and Gold territory. Blodget inter

cepted a pass intended for a Califor
nia forward, and with a neat shot
found the net for California's first
