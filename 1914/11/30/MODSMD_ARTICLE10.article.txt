# CROWD PRINCE STATES GERMAN'S SIDE OF WAR
## First of Royal Family to Speak For Publication WARRIORS AT FRONT REST Friedrich Wilhelm Says Contest Is Most Senseless of Modern Times and Germany Fights For Existence United Press Telegraphic Report 
### Karl Von Weigand 
Headquarters Army of the German
Crown Prince, France (by courier via
Namur to Aix La Chapelle and The
Hague, and cable from London to New
York), Xov. 20.—"Undoubtedly this is
the most stupid, senseless, and unnec
essary war of modern times. The war
was not wanted by Germany, I can
assure you, but was forced on us, and
the fact that we were so effectually
prepared to defend ourselves is now
being used as an argument for the
convenience of the world that we de
sired to launch the conflict." With the
above words F.riedricli Wilhelm opened
the first interview which has ever
been given a foreign newspaper man
by a member of the German royal
house since the outbreak of the war.
"I am sorry that we cannot discuss
the world politics involved. From the
lowest to the highest of the German
people, all know that we are fighting
for existence. It has been our highest
duty to anticipate the struggle by
making every possible defence of the
Fatherland against the Tron Ring
which our enemies have been steadily
welding about us.
"We foresaw and as far as possible
forestalled the attempt to crush us. No
power on earth will ever be able to
convince our people that this war was
not engineered solely with the view of
trampling the German people, their
government institutions, and all they
hold dear into death. The result is
that the German people are one grand
unit, imbued with a magnificent spirit
of self-sacrifice."

Petrograd, Nov. 30.—Tt is now ap

The Germans are making a terrific
effort, to cut their way through the

Paris, Nov. 30. —The latest reports
issued by the Communique state that
the entire battle line in the western
theatre of war in Belgium and Francs
has been subject to no important
changes. At almost every point the
German forces remain on the defen

Russians \eed Reinforcements.
Petrograd, Nov. 30.—Tt is now ap
parent that the hopes of the Russians
rest upon the enormous reinforce
ments that the Czar is rushing with
all speed to the front, where he ex
pects to completely crush the enemy
south of Plock, in the region of Ixidz.
The Germans are making a terrific
effort, to cut their way through the
mass of hostile troops encircling them.

Headquarters Army of the German
Crown Prince, France (by courier via
Namur to Aix La Chapelle and The
Hague, and cable from London to New

the most stupid, senseless, and unnec
essary war of modern times. The war
was not wanted by Germany, I can
assure you, but was forced on us, and
the fact that we were so effectually
prepared to defend ourselves is now
being used as an argument for the
convenience of the world that we de
sired to launch the conflict." With the
above words F.riedricli Wilhelm opened
the first interview which has ever
been given a foreign newspaper man
by a member of the German royal
house since the outbreak of the war.
"I am sorry that we cannot discuss
the world politics involved. From the
lowest to the highest of the German
people, all know that we are fighting
for existence. It has been our highest
duty to anticipate the struggle by
making every possible defence of the
Fatherland against the Tron Ring
which our enemies have been steadily
welding about us.
"We foresaw and as far as possible
forestalled the attempt to crush us. No
power on earth will ever be able to
convince our people that this war was
not engineered solely with the view of
trampling the German people, their
government institutions, and all they
hold dear into death. The result is
that the German people are one grand
unit, imbued with a magnificent spirit
of self-sacrifice."
