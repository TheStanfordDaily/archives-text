Richard Hovey, the author of the
following poem, was born at Normal,
Illinois, and died in 1900, at Dart
mouth. He was a man of versatile
literary attainments, being an author,
verse writer, journalist, and dramatist
of note.
The last two years of his life were
spent in lecturing at the University of
Columbia:
There is no escape by the river,
There is no flight left by the fen:
We are compassed about by the shiver
Of the might of their marching men.
Give a cheer!
For our hearts shall not give way,
Here's to a dark tomorrow
And here's to a brave today!
The tale of their hosts is countless,
And the tale of ours a score;
Hut the palm is naught to. the daunt
less
And the cause is more and more.
Give a cheer!
We may die, but not give way.
Here's to a silent tomorrow
And here's to a stout today!
God has said, "Ye shall fail and per
ish,
But the thrill ye have felt tonight
I shall keep in my heart and cherish
When the worlds have passed in
night."
Give a cheer!
For the soul shall not give way—
Here's to a greater tomorrow
That is born of a great today!
Now shame on the craven truckler
And the puling things that mope!
We've a rapture for our buckler
That outwears the wings of hope.
Give a cheer!
For our joy shall not give way—
Here's In the teeth of tomorrow
To the glory of today!
