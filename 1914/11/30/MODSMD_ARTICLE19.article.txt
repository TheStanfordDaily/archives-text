Science Magazine, for October IG,
1914, contains an article by Professor
A. R. Warnock, of the University of
Illinois, on "Fraternities and Scholar
ships." Five years ago, the author
states, two rules were passed in that
university affecting scholarship. One
that the scholarship average of the
chapters of national social fraternities,
represented in the university, be kept
by the dean of men; and the other re
quiring all Freshmen satisfactorily to
complete eleven hours of work before
being initiated
Quoting directly: "Although the di
rect benefit of this .rule is upon the
Freshmen, the effect has been felt by
the fraternities throughout, due to the
additional emphasis placed upon schol
arships in fraternity welfare, and es
pecially upon the need which the fra
ternities have found to make condi
tions for study as favorable as pos
sible for the Freshmen.
There are always many Freshmen
who must, in one way or another, be
held to study during that early period
which comes before they have learned
the need and value of study for study's
loaf.
During the present year the frater
nity Freshman has .ranked first in
sake. This Freshmen rule furnishes
to fraternity Freshman the necessity
and incentive to do otherwise than
the university. By bringing the gen
eral average up to that of the non
fraternitv standard, the fraternities
have proved that they are a benefit to
a university community."
