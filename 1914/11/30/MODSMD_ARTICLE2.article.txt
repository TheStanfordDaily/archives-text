# Pete Forgot City Laws But Stockton Cop Didn't
## Stanford Student Advisor Had Vision of Thanksgiving Dinner Behind the Prison liars. 
### 
"The Stars and Stripes" is the title
of a charming ditty which might be
written by some campus bard to com
memorate the Thanksgiving experi
ence of Arthur Warren Ambrose, gi\,
better known as the Student Adviser.
Not that "Pete" is getting more pa
triotic than usual. The stars in this
particular case were not floating with
the stripes of Old Glory, but gleam
ing on the manly breasts of a squad
of Stockton policemen, who threat
ened to put an end to the Student
Advisor's visions of Thanksgiving
turkey.
The stripes were not of the red and
white, either. They were the kind
that stared "Pete" in the face after
he had been hailed into the court for
leaving his Fo.rd motor running in the
principal street of the Slough City,
while he meandered into a store to
buy some Spearmint.
You see, Warren cherished a delu
sion that it was University Avenue.
Naturally, "Pete" was somewhat
modest about mentioning his official
capacity at Stanford, and the Stock
ton "cops" had no way of knowing
what an influential personage they
had at hand. However, they released
Arthur after he had contributed to
the municipal treasury. The only
things that Mr. Ambrose is out as the
result of his thrilling experience are
a few cartwheels and a clean rec
ord.
