# On the Quiet

Give Thanks.
Vacation is over,
The clays went fast, —
Thanksgiving's no more
Than an extended repast,—
An occasion for pumpkins,
Turkey and stuffing,
(You're stuffed by the hostess
Who thinks you are bluffing
When you refuse to eat
More turkey and stuffing).
!
You dream of pumpkins
And big turkey gobblers,
And eat so much
Your legs become wobblers.
And sauce with the goose,
And sauce with the gander,
Has crammed you so tight
You can hardly meander.
If there's nothing to do,
Vacation's o. k.,
But college is there
In its own little way.
There may be fun
In being a rover,
Tint don't you give thanks
When the blamed thing is over?
