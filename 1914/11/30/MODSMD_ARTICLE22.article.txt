### 
Miss Frances McLaughlin, '15, and
R. F. Adcock, '14, were married yester
day evening at the Palo Alto home of
A. C. McLaughlin, brother of the bride.
Reverend David Evans, rector of the
Episcopal church, of Palo Alto, per
formed the ceremony. The wedding
was a complete surprise to the friends
of the couple, who thought Miss Mc-
Laughlin was visiting in the South.
The bride is a member of the Pi Beta
Phi sorority, and Adcock is claimed by
Encina Club.
After the ceremony the couple left
Palo Alto by automobile, fearing some
demonstration by friends at the local
depot.
