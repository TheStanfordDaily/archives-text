# ALL BLACKS WIN 21 TO 3
## Sacramento Athletic Club Takes the Short End of Thanksgiving Day Contest Played in Capitol City SECOND HALF OF MATCH IS FAST 
### 
The All-Blacks closed the 1914
Stanford rugby season by administer
ing a 21 to 3 defeat to the Sacramento
Athletic Club at the Capital City on
Thanksgiving Day. The game started
out in rather listless fashion but the
play warmed up as the contest pro
ceeded, and the second half brought
out some good rugby.
The Stanford second team players,
reinforced by three members of this
year's Varsity, fought their way over
the Sacramento line for two tries dur
ing the first period. After eight min
utes of play, in which the ball was
kept between the two twenty-five yard
lines, Nourse, the home team's full
back fumbled and allowed Henry to
register the first three points. The
difficult attempt at goal was missed
by West.
The try, which made the score for
the first half rest at six, was credited
to Rehm. The middle ranker, who won
his football "S" in the last minute of
this year's Big Game, plunged over
the line from a one-yard scrum. West
failed to convert.
Sacramento's one dangerous assault
into Stanford's territory came as the
result of a spectacular fifty-yard run
by the Winged "S' second five, Sum
mermacher. West tackled him close to
the Stanford line, preventing a try.
Swigart, with a brilliant thirty-yard
run, threatened to add to the Stanford
score, only to be downed by the on
posing fullback.
From the kick off of the second pe
riod the play was faster, the Stanford
forwards appearing to have recovered
f.rom their two weeks' layoff. A clever
run of fifteen yards through a scat
tered field by Tilton resulted in the
first of the th.ree tries of the second
half. West's goal brought the score
up to eleven.
Three minutes later Sammy Hern.
Sacramento left wing, and shortstop on
the Wolves' Pacific Coast League nine,
sped down the field thirty-five yards,
sliding over the line a yard from the
corner flag for the losers' only
try. His attempted conversion was
w'ld.
Swigart boosted the score to four
teen, when he gained thirty yard, and
a moment later went over for the fifth
try. After the kick-off Burns made a
shifty run of twenty yards, and then,
after the final gun had sounded, Pet
tingill did a Charlie Austin stunt,
placing the ball between the goal
posts. West sent the sphere over the
cross-bar in each of his last two
.ticks.
Tn the evening, after an enjoyable
turkey dinner at the Travelers' Hotel,

headquarters, the members of the team
who staid over and a number of
the Athletic Club men spent the ev
ening at a local theatre. The club

The All-Blacks closed the 1914
Stanford rugby season by administer
ing a 21 to 3 defeat to the Sacramento
Athletic Club at the Capital City on
Thanksgiving Day. The game started
out in rather listless fashion but the
play warmed up as the contest pro
ceeded, and the second half brought
out some good rugby.
The Stanford second team players,
reinforced by three members of this
year's Varsity, fought their way over
the Sacramento line for two tries dur
ing the first period. After eight min
utes of play, in which the ball was
kept between the two twenty-five yard
lines, Nourse, the home team's full
back fumbled and allowed Henry to
register the first three points. The
difficult attempt at goal was missed
by West.
The try, which made the score for
the first half rest at six, was credited
to Rehm. The middle ranker, who won
his football "S" in the last minute of
this year's Big Game, plunged over
the line from a one-yard scrum. West
failed to convert.
Sacramento's one dangerous assault
into Stanford's territory came as the
result of a spectacular fifty-yard run
by the Winged "S' second five, Sum
mermacher. West tackled him close to
the Stanford line, preventing a try.
Swigart, with a brilliant thirty-yard
run, threatened to add to the Stanford
score, only to be downed by the on
posing fullback.
From the kick off of the second pe
riod the play was faster, the Stanford
forwards appearing to have recovered
f.rom their two weeks' layoff. A clever
run of fifteen yards through a scat
tered field by Tilton resulted in the
first of the th.ree tries of the second
half. West's goal brought the score
up to eleven.
Three minutes later Sammy Hern.
Sacramento left wing, and shortstop on
the Wolves' Pacific Coast League nine,
sped down the field thirty-five yards,
sliding over the line a yard from the
corner flag for the losers' only
try. His attempted conversion was
w'ld.
Swigart boosted the score to four
teen, when he gained thirty yard, and
a moment later went over for the fifth
try. After the kick-off Burns made a
shifty run of twenty yards, and then,
after the final gun had sounded, Pet
tingill did a Charlie Austin stunt,
placing the ball between the goal
posts. West sent the sphere over the
cross-bar in each of his last two
.ticks.
Tn the evening, after an enjoyable
turkey dinner at the Travelers' Hotel,
where the Stanford men made their
headquarters, the members of the team
who staid over and a number of
the Athletic Club men spent the ev
ening at a local theatre. The club
members did everything in their pow
er to make the stay pleasant.
