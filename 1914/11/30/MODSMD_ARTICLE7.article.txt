## 
### 
J. E. McDowell, '00, Registrar of the
University, and Secretary of Stanford
Alumni, has just returned from the
third annual Conference of Alumni
Secretaries, which met recently in
New York City, as the guests of Co
lumbia University.
Mr. McDowell urged two measures
for adoption, and was successful in
each case. As a result of his endeav
ors, the fourth annual conference will
be held at San Francisco in the sec
ond week of November, 1915. The con
vention will meet twice during the
week—once on Tuesday, on which day
the secretaries will be entertained at
Berkeley as guests of the University
of California, and again on Thursday,
at which time the assembly will con
vene here on the campus. The climax
will come on the day of the Big Game,
when representatives of all the East
ern colleges will be initiated into the
rugby spirit of the Pacific Coast.
The various secretaries were urged
by Mr. McDowell to plan their own
alumni reunions in San Francisco, co
incident with the meeting of the con
ference, and many of the representa
tives signified their intentions of pro
moting the scheme in their various
colleges.
Representatives from 75 American
colleges, including Yale, Harvard,
Princeton, and Cornell, were present
at the meeting, and all were guests of
the Yale Alumni Association at the
annual Yale-Harvard game, which was
played in the famous bowl.
Mr. McDowell was very enthusiastic
over the manner in which the rival
rooting sections were conducted by
the leaders, and declared that the
sight of 70,00 ft spectators, all concen
trating their gaze upon 22 men in a
mighty struggle, was a memorable
souvenir in his experience.
Plans for holding a .reunion of
former Stanford men and women next
year are beginning to take shape, and
some definite action will be ready for
announcement in the near future.
