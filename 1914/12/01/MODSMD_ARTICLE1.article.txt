With the Thanksgiving excitement
as a thing of tiie past, members ot' the
Campus Auxiliary are co-operating ac
tively with the Alumni Association of
San Francisco, which supports the
Stanford Clinic, in formulating plans
for the Dansant, which will be held
December 5 at the Palace Hotel.
Already numbers of alumni have
spoken for tables, and the faculty of
the campus are set a noteworthy ex
ample by President and Mrs. Casper
Branner, Mrs. David Starr Jordan, and
Vice-President and Mrs. John Maxon,
who have signified their intention of
reserving a table.
Three campus fraternities had re
ported favorably by noon today, and
Dr. H. R. Stolz will conduct an imme
diate campaign to bring the rest into
line. Miss Eugenia Burns, '15, has
charge of boosting the event among
the sororities, and no doubt they will
all engage tables at the Dansant.
Informality will be the keynote of
the gathering. This is the first occa
sion in which Stanford alumni, facul
ty, and students will have the oppor
tunity of meeting on such an occasion,
and the affair is sure to be rushed to
success with the spirit of a "first
night performance" back of it.
A special train will leave the cam
pus early enough to place the Band
and Glee Club at the Palace Hotel by 4
o'clock, and will make the return trip
directly after the dance is over.
Fraternities and sororities will be
asked to reserve tables, each accommo
dating ten persons, the price being
$15.00. Private parties may engage
tables at $1.50 a place.
The cause is worthy, the time is set
early enough to avoid conflict with
final examinations, the place is up-to
date, and the affair promises to eclipse
all semester entertainments in bril
liancy.
