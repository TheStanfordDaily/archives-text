## Prepared for Exchange of Operations in Rival Literary Fields.

An exchange of the Chaparral and
the Pelican is no longer a prospect; it
is a certainty. A final decision of Edi
tors Faust and Hagen was reached
during the Thanksgiving vacation, and
on Monday, December the seventh,
the papers will appear on the campus.
The edition promises to be one of
unusual interest to all. Cuts and
sketches of every kind have been given
special attention: a special feature be
ing a double-page cartoon by Miss An
na Wille, '17, who is one of the most
versatile and cleve.r of the University
of California art students. The edi
tors, through their editorials, have
lived up to the original purpose of the
exchange, that of bringing about a
closer union of sympathies between
the two universities. Following this,
the topic chosen by the editors is "In
tercollegiate Relations."
The papers appearing in this publi
cation will be more typical of the best
talent that has been produced during
several years than of that which now
represents the two staffs. The reason
for this is that a great many contribu
tions have been received from the most
prominent staff members of preceding
years.
