United Press Telegraphic Report
London, Dec. I.—Both the Russian
and German statements indicate that
the German lines in Poland are intact.
The gigantic armies are fighting on a
line extending for over a hundred
miles. Von Hindenburg, the German
commander, has been heavily rein
forced. However, the experts are con
fident that the Russians still hold the
advantage, but realize that a final de
cision is far off. The presence of the
Kaiser at the front is believed to in
dicate that a supreme effo.rt will soon
be made to drive the Russians back to
Warsaw again.
The departure of the English King
to the front probably foreshadows an
early offensive on the part of the al
lies in Belgium. However, the King
was sent for only a day at the front,
and may now be on his way back to
England.
Czar Goes to Poland.
Petrograd, Dec. 1. —The Czar left for
the front at ten o'clock this morning.
He will visit the headquarters of his
army in Poland.
Naval Battle Imminent.
Montevideo, Dec. 1. —The British and
Tapanese warships are closing on the
German squadron in South American
waters, and a big naval engagement
is expected soon. Traffic in the South
Atlantic is practically abandoned.
Germans Massing in Belgium.
Paris, Dec. I.—Every able-bodied
German who can be spared from gar
rison duty in Belgium has been sent to
the fighting line at Ypres and near the
sea. It is reported that during the re
cent lull in the battle, the Belgian
towns were practically denuded of
their fighting forces. A hundred thou
sand Teutons are massed for an as
sault upon Ypres. This rush of rein
forcements is believed to indicate that
the Germans are anticipating an offen
sive movement by the British and
French.
Armies in North Are Active.
Paris, Dec. 1. — (Official) —The Ger
mans north of Arras were most active
yesterday. There was heavy cannon
ading in Belgium, but no infantry at
tacks were attempted. Elsewhere con
ditions were unchanged.
Only Lines in North Poland Engaged.
Berlin (via wireless) Dec. I.— (Offi
cial)—" Quiet prevails in East Prussia
and in Southern Poland. Yesterday's
successes in the north netted us a
booty of 9500 men, 19 cannon, 36 ma
chine guns and numerous ammunition
carts."
Teuton Intention Stated.
Berlin (via wireless). Dec. I.—The
latest reports from Poland show that
the Germans have resumed their plan
of encompassing the Russian right and
forcing back the center to cut off the
communications of Warsaw. The first
move to fulfill the plan, which began
with the defeat of the Russians at Lip
no and Plock, was later hindered by
the arrival of Russian reinforcements
and the Germans were for the time be
ing thrown on the defensive. Now, af
ter repulsing numerous attacks, the
Teutons appear to be advancing to
ward Lowicz.
