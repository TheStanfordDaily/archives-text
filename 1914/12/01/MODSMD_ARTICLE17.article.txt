# Abroad at Home

"Abroad at home" would be the
proper caption for an hour's ramble
amid the thousands of beautiful works
of art in our Museum, yet there are
few of us who have ever made the jour
ney. In the treasure house for all that
Stanford possesses in the realm of art,
are hundreds of valuable paintings,
some original, and more such excellent
copies of masterpieces that few could
distinguish the second from the first.
And there are other things of small
compass that are eminently worth
while—but it is a long tramp to that
corner of the campus during Museum
hours.
In the course of his inaugural ad
dress, President Branner stated that
it was his earnest wish that the works
of art might be brought from the mu
seum building to the Quad, where the
pictures would relieve the bareness of
class and seminar rooms. In other
words, the liberal education afforded
by familiarity with the jealously
guarded paintings would be taken
from the high slielf and put within
easy reach of all comers. Then even
the vacant stare at walls would not be
profitless, fo.t- there would be better
than Washington's perennial ferrying
of the icy Delaware for critical study.
To this end, the first steps were
taken when a few of the less valuable
paintings were hung in the Council
Chambers, and in the rooms of the ad
ministration building. The hoped-for
exodus from museum halls seems to
have halted at that point. There are
pictures left 'way over there that are
worth the move without being dan
gerously valuable—let's have a closer
look at them, Committee on the Mu
seum, perhaps we'll grow to like them
better than we think.
