# The 						Great Lakes

### 
Charles H. Winke, an American con
temporary writer of rising reputation,
has written the following lines on the
agreement between the United States
and Great Britain that the waters of
the Great Lakes should be free from
war ships and other hostile activities
by both nations:
No commonâ€”bristling squadrons rode
at rest
Within gun-sheltered harbors on
these lakes;
Here but the urgency of commerce
wakes
The cloven waves to song, with keels
deep-prest
Into their bosoms; hurrying east and
west,
Trade's myriad-flagged Aramada
ne'er forsakes
These seas at Desolation's behest,
but makes
A fruitful highway of their neutral
breast.
Shores and Oceans of the fort
stained earth,
What will the triumph of the Future
be
When birds build safely in your ev'ry
gun!
When all the ships innumerable that
girth
Your shining coasts shall share the
ministry
Of Peace and only her blest errands
run!
