# German Scholar Writes Justification of Empire
## 
### 
Chancellor Jordan, of Stanford, in a
recent issue of the Fatherland (New
York) gives for publication a letter
from Dr. Otto Seeck, professor of his
tory in the University of Munster,
Westphalia, who endeavors to explain
the righteousness of the German cause.
In presenting this letter to the Amer
ican public, Dr. Jordan states that,
while he does not unqualifiedly accept
the views of Dr. Seeck as his own, he
asks that the letter be published in
English o.r German, preferably both.
* * * "For the sake of our indebted
ness to German scholars and friends,
T would like to see the fullest publici
ty given to their weighty utterances."
The letter discusses the question of
Germany's desire for conquest, dis
claiming that Germany is at all "on
conquest bent." The question of the
Austro-Hungarian-Gennan alliance is
explained as an effort on Germany's
part to counterbalance the allies'
three-fold fighting strength, which has
menaced Austria-Hungary in the past.
Germany, Dr. Seeck declares, has with
a sheathed but threatening sword,
aided Austria to arise stronger from
every European crisis, without disturb
ing the peace of Europe, over which
the German emperor constantly
watched. It was a life-question with
Germany, that the strength of the
loyal ally, Austria-Hungary, might re
main unimpaired, and it was to this
end that Germany came to the imme
diate aid of Austria when Russia
threatened her borders.
Dr. Seeck, in speaking of Belgium,
says that the powers knew and Belgi
um herself knew that Belgium would
become the theatre of war. To this
end. with both parties intending to
make the neutral country the scene of
operations, Belgium saw itself com
pelled to become partisan. Common
language and culture drew it toward
France, Sufficient evidence is now at
hand to prove that in case of war Eng
lish troops were to land on the Belgi
um coast, uniting with the French to
enter the German Rhineland.
Proofs of Belgium's partisanship
are found in the unprotected state of
her French frontier, and the modern
fortresses of TJege and Namu.r, which,
under General Briahcourt, were built
after the signing of the neutrality
agreement, upon which England justi
fies her intervention. "Thus we could
not respect Belgian neutrality, as it
became a matter of life or death for us
to eliminate it."

ness to German scholars and friends,
T would like to see the fullest publici
ty given to their weighty utterances."
The letter discusses the question of
Germany's desire for conquest, dis
claiming that Germany is at all "on
conquest bent." The question of the
Austro-Hungarian-Gennan alliance is
explained as an effort on Germany's
part to counterbalance the allies'
three-fold fighting strength, which has
menaced Austria-Hungary in the past.
Germany, Dr. Seeck declares, has with
a sheathed but threatening sword,
aided Austria to arise stronger from
every European crisis, without disturb
ing the peace of Europe, over which
the German emperor constantly
watched. It was a life-question with
Germany, that the strength of the
loyal ally, Austria-Hungary, might re
main unimpaired, and it was to this
end that Germany came to the imme
diate aid of Austria when Russia
threatened her borders.
Dr. Seeck, in speaking of Belgium,
says that the powers knew and Belgi
um herself knew that Belgium would
become the theatre of war. To this
end. with both parties intending to
make the neutral country the scene of
operations, Belgium saw itself com
pelled to become partisan. Common
language and culture drew it toward
France, Sufficient evidence is now at
hand to prove that in case of war Eng
lish troops were to land on the Belgi
um coast, uniting with the French to
enter the German Rhineland.
Proofs of Belgium's partisanship
are found in the unprotected state of
her French frontier, and the modern
fortresses of TJege and Namu.r, which,
under General Briahcourt, were built
after the signing of the neutrality
agreement, upon which England justi
fies her intervention. "Thus we could
not respect Belgian neutrality, as it
became a matter of life or death for us
to eliminate it."
