and is as follows:
"Valuations of the property of the
water company were prepared by
Hunter and Hudson for the water com
pany, by G. Chester Brown for the city
of Monterey, and by the hydraulic de
partment of this Commission. Just as
in another case affecting valuations
of utility property in the city of Mon
terey, much to my regret it became
necessary for me to comment on the
inflated valuations urged, not by the
engineer making the report, but by the
financial engineers figuring the over
head, in this case I feel it proper that
1 likewise comment on the attitude of
the engineer, and to compliment Mr.
Hunter, engineer for the water com
pany, for his very fair and reasonable
valuation. 1 was impressed that while
this engineer desired to secure for his
company all that it could legitimately
claim, yet this desire did not lead him
to unreasonable loadings and exagger
ations."
Hunter has been well known in the

from Stanford. He has been promi
nent in many large undertakings,
