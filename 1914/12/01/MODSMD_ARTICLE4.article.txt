# SEMESTER TRIALS
## Will Continue for Seven Days Beginning December 12. 
### 
A long line of conscientious students
besieged the Registrar's office this
morning, intent on receiving the little
slips of paper known as "Ex. Sched
ules," which were to decide for them
whether they would be allowed to
start for home on December 12, or be
obliged to remain on the campus for a
whole week longer, reveling in the
doubtful joys of "taking finals."
Examination Week begins on Satur
day, December 12, and continues until
the following Friday, which marks the
close of the semester on December 18.
