# ART EXHIBIT AT STUDIO
## THIRTY-ONE CANVASES BY PROFESSOR POOR Paintings Reflect High Ideals and Broad Color Conception in Landscape—Figure Studies Have Fine Vigor and Appeal 
### Professor A.B. Clark 
A collection of thirty-one paintings
by Professor H. V. Poor, '10, of the
art department, is now on exhibition
at the Old Studio. The canvases will
be on view from two to five every day
up to the fifth of this month.
The pictures on exhibit we.re all
painted during the last year, some in
January in the Sierra snows, several
in the Santa Cruz mountains, others
along the coast near Monterey and in
the Santa Clara valley. Four are
figure subjects. Mr. Poor's landscapes
express the innate big characteristic
of the scene, and in choice of subject
are original.
In number twenty we see how the ar
tist grasps the largeness of landscape,
the combination of sky, earth, and ver
dure, with a sharp horizon showing
the clearness of the mountain air on a
morning following rain.
In the canvas number twelve 's
shown late evening in summer, with
the softly colored, rained-on hay
cocks casting faint shadows.
"An Orchard" (number nine) shows
near trees deep green in shadow, far
trees yellow in sunlight, the earth vio
let in shadow and orange in sunlight,
and the gray-violet mountain range
beyond. This force and vigor of color
sensation in the simple contrasting
elements of each painting is the fea
ture to be enjoyed in this broad art.
The decorative element is also
prominent—for example in number
one, "An Orchard on a Hillside," the
lower part is a bold pattern of large
purple masses of shadow on orange
violet ground—the upper part an in
tricate tapestry of vivid green and blue.
The love of decorative line is also
shown in the fresh and unhampered
selection of the tree trunk motif, "Near
Adalanta Villa" (number five).
In number twenty-two there is also
fine poetic interpretation of growing
nature in the vigorous growth of young
vines springing like flaming green
torches from the violet ground, under
the vibrating distant mountains glow
ing with the salmon evening sky.
Fine human feeling has controlled
the selection, arrangement, and decor
ative treatment of number nineteen.
Whatever personal value it may have
to the individuals portrayed, to us it
is an epitome of the fine people who
make up the Santa Clara valley.
Tn the two children with fish —one
sees the delicacy, not of insipid sand
papering, but a truthful portrayal in
direct light of delicate planes of color.
The same is true of the "Baby's
Toilet." The superb composition, the
fine color balance of green, salmon,
violet, and garnet, as well as its hu
man interest, make it a fine canvas.
Extremely delicate and refined, but
the one who can see delicacy only 'n
rosy, wax-like overmodelled flesh will
miss this .refinement.
Tn closing one can best advise that
to grasp the artist's point of view is of
first importance, for to let each can
vas explain itself under careful, de
liberate study will repay richly.
