### 
Rudyard Kipling ,in 1893, eulogized
the famous English general, Lord
Roberts, when the "Iron Duke" made
his well-known inarch to Kandahar,
India. Field Marshal Earl Roberts
died November 14, while in active ser
vice of his country in France. The fol
lowing verses are good evidence of the
great admiration which England holds
for its most distinguished and be
loved soldier of recent times:
There is a little red-face man,
Which is Bobs.
Rides the tallest 'orse he can,
Our Bobs.
If it bucks or kicks o.r rears
'E can sit for twenty years,
With a smile round both 'is ears—
Can't yer, Bobs?
Tf a marker's lost 'is place,
Dress by Bobs;
If a gun 'as slipt its trace,
'Ook on Bobs.
'E's eyes all up 'is coat
An' a bugle in 'is throat,
An' you will not play the goat
Under Bobs.
What 'e does not know of war,
Gen'ral Bobs,
You can arsk the shop next door—
Can't they, Bobs?
Oli, 'e's little, but 'e's wise;
'E's a terror for 'is size,
An'—'e—does —not —advertise —
Do yer, Bobs?
