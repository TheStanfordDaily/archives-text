# BROWN WALLS OF THE QUAD HIDE MANY A HEROIC CHARACTER
## 
### 
"The Rivals" will hold sway as the
premier dramatic offering of the cam
pus this week and next. The matinee
idols and ingenues of English 1 daily
tread the creaking boards of the
English department, while through the
open transom Mrs. Alalaprop's appall
ing utterances and Sir Anthony Abso
lute's threatening .roars cause the
startled passer-by to stop to listen and
wonder at the queer ways people have
of getting an education.
Within the class room, one will find
an act of Sheridan's comedy staged to
taste. Three performances a day are
given. At 8:15 one may see veritable
Gordon Craig simplicity of scenic ef
fect, at 9:15 the policies of Ben Greet
hold sway and signs proclaim the fact
that the scene depicts "Lydia's apart
ment" or "a street in Bath." The 11:15
period greets one with the detailed .re
alism of a Belasco setting where
Sheridan's characters strut in costume
through bona fide entrances and exits.
Friday will bring the third act of
this to-be-continued drama, while the
fourth and fifth acts will follow next
