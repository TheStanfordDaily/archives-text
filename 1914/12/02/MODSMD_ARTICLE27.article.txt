# RUGBY STORIES ARE LIFE OF NOVEMBER ALUMNUS
## "BOBS'" COMMENT ON RECENT INTERCOLLEGIATE Editor Smith Discusses Bonfire Methods, Painting the "C," and Press Club Jolly-Up. 
### 
The November number of the "Alum
us," which is ready for distribution
today, reflects in its usual conserva
tive manner, the many interesting
happenings of the past exceedingly
eventful month.
The frontispiece is a portrait of the
late Professor Ewald Fliigel, and the
most important contributions to the
magazine are two eulogies to him by
liis colleagues, Professors M. B. Ander
son and W. 1). Briggs, '9(5, concerning
his life work and ambitions.
Considerable space is devoted to
the intercollegiate contests, particu
larly the latest chapter of the history
of rugby games between Stanford and
California. Henry Roberts, of the San
Francisco Chronicle, bette.r known as
"Bobs,' one of the best-informed rugby
experts on the coast, gives his critical
judgement of the men who played in
the rugby game on November four
teenth. From "Bobs' " viewpoint the
Cardinal fifteen, both as a team and
individuals, was superior to California
in nearly every phase of the game, al
though he gives great praise to sever
al of the Blue and Gold players. He
concludes his article with the ominous
warning. "Next year it will be a dif
ferent story." With the contribution
there is a picture of the serpentine on
the Berkeley turf after the contest.
Editor E. W. Smith, '99, in discussing
the football game and its preliminary
excitement, suggests that some way
must be found to avoid the necessity
of devoting so much time to guarding
the bonfire, Quad, etc., and that the
pre-"Big Game" pranks, such as paint
ing the big "C" be confined to cer
tain days before the contest. The edi
tor also cites the need for a new way
of holding the annnal get-together on
the eve of the "Big Game," as this cel
ebration has grown in popularity until
the quarters of the Press Club are not
large enough to accommodate the
crowd.
"California Wins the Debate" is the
title of the article in which F. E. Hill,
'11, of the English Department, covers
the recent intercollegiate debate.
The appalling need of the Belgians
is again described, and in the adver
tising section of the magazine the
"Alumnus" prints, with a special' ap
peal, a pledge card.
"Comparisons of Teams," a football
article by Archie Rice, '95, in which
the write,r gives some interesting sta
tistics concerning the Big Game, taken
together with "Bobs'" stoiT. makes
the present issue the best rugby
"Alumnus" in years.
"New Nurses' Home Needed," by
.Miss Elizabeth Hogue, '01, now super
intendent. of the Lane Hospital, points
out the necessity of a modern home for
nurses.
The issue is completed by the usual
number of news items and personal
notes concerning the activities of
alumni in various parts of the world.

us," which is ready for distribution
today, reflects in its usual conserva
tive manner, the many interesting
happenings of the past exceedingly
eventful month.
The frontispiece is a portrait of the
late Professor Ewald Fliigel, and the
most important contributions to the
magazine are two eulogies to him by
liis colleagues, Professors M. B. Ander
son and W. 1). Briggs, '9(5, concerning
his life work and ambitions.
Considerable space is devoted to
the intercollegiate contests, particu
larly the latest chapter of the history
of rugby games between Stanford and
California. Henry Roberts, of the San
Francisco Chronicle, bette.r known as
"Bobs,' one of the best-informed rugby
experts on the coast, gives his critical
judgement of the men who played in
the rugby game on November four
teenth. From "Bobs' " viewpoint the
Cardinal fifteen, both as a team and
individuals, was superior to California
in nearly every phase of the game, al
though he gives great praise to sever
al of the Blue and Gold players. He
concludes his article with the ominous
warning. "Next year it will be a dif
ferent story." With the contribution
there is a picture of the serpentine on
the Berkeley turf after the contest.
Editor E. W. Smith, '99, in discussing
the football game and its preliminary
excitement, suggests that some way
must be found to avoid the necessity
of devoting so much time to guarding
the bonfire, Quad, etc., and that the
pre-"Big Game" pranks, such as paint
ing the big "C" be confined to cer
tain days before the contest. The edi
tor also cites the need for a new way
of holding the annnal get-together on
the eve of the "Big Game," as this cel
ebration has grown in popularity until
the quarters of the Press Club are not
large enough to accommodate the
crowd.
"California Wins the Debate" is the
title of the article in which F. E. Hill,
'11, of the English Department, covers
the recent intercollegiate debate.
The appalling need of the Belgians
is again described, and in the adver
tising section of the magazine the
"Alumnus" prints, with a special' ap
peal, a pledge card.
"Comparisons of Teams," a football
article by Archie Rice, '95, in which
the write,r gives some interesting sta
tistics concerning the Big Game, taken
together with "Bobs'" stoiT. makes
the present issue the best rugby
"Alumnus" in years.
"New Nurses' Home Needed," by
.Miss Elizabeth Hogue, '01, now super
intendent. of the Lane Hospital, points
out the necessity of a modern home for
nurses.
The issue is completed by the usual
number of news items and personal
notes concerning the activities of
alumni in various parts of the world.
