# STRUGGLING WITH EVIL A SOURCE OF STRENGTH
## Dr. Palmer, Pastor of Oakland Church, Speaks on Service of Seeming Curses. 
### 
Dr. Palmer, pastor of the First Con
gregational Church of Oakland, lec
tured yesterday afternoon in the Chap
el on "The Religion for Health, Happi
ness, and Efficiency."
"111-health, un-happlness and inef
ficiency," said Dr. Palmer, "are looked
upon as the three great curses of hu
manity. However, we would not ap
preciate health, happiness, and effi
ciency if their opposition were not ap
parent. These things which are looked
upon as evil are really of benefit to
mankind, in that they force us to
struggle with them, and so strengthen
ourselves. Our religion must help us
overcome these so-called evils and to
apppreciate the true worth of health,
happiness, and efficiency."
The lecture was given under the
auspices of the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W.
C. A.
