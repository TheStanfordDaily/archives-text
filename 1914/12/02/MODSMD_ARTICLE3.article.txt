# Dance For Health's Sake at the Palace Saturday
## Stanford Band Has Remarkable Program as Contribution to Clinic's Money Campaign. 
### 
Dance for health's sake, at the Pal
ace Hotel Saturday evening from 4
until 10 o'clock. There is a long way
between the lighted ball room and the
squalid sick rooms of the invalid poor
in San Francisco. That distance can
be bridged by the Stanford Clinic and
Auxiliary, if trippers of the airy foot
respond to the call to dance. You have
danced for fun alone; now dance for
the aid of the helpless. December 5,
Palace Hotel, Tea Dansant.
The Stanford Band has been asked to
provide a musical concert during the
afternoon. With a heartiness which
marks all preparation for the big
dansant, the Rand has rehearsed
a remarkable program under Profes
sor E. W. Martin.
Sousa's march, "The Thunderer," is
the opening composition. Offenbach'.i
grand overture, "Orpheus," will fol
low.
Hall's sprightly "Wedding of the
Winds," and a cornet duet, "Two Lit
tle Bullfinches," by Kline form the sec
ond group. Fabani's "Fantasia," a
medley of opera gems, and Friml's
comedy opera overture, "The Fi,rc
Fly," precedes two numbers of intri
cate composition.
A suite in four parts, "Don Quixote,"
by Safranck, is a musical pageant of
Spanish charm. The phases are "A
Spanish Village," "Sanco Panza,"
"Dulcinea," and "Don Quixote." Sa
franck annually produces a suite,
which stirs the music world. His
"Destruction of Atlantis" was a suc
cess on the program of the hand dur
ing its last tour of Southern California
A military operette of dramatic pow
er is Johnson's "Death of General Cus
ter," memorizing the tragic battle of
the Little Big Horn. The progress of
the marching cavalry, proud music of
the military band, war chants of the
Sioux, souncls of battle, weird orgies of
the scalp dance, and funeral dirge
ove,r the grave of Custer are woven in
to grand medley.
"Hail Stanford, Hail,' will close the
concert. On with the dance.
