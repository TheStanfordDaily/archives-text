## Campus Campaign For Relief Will Be Completed Immediatelyâ€”Another Consignment of Clothes to Be Sent Away on December 12th 
### 
The fifty-cent campus campaign for
Belgian relief has been resumed since
the vacation interruption, and the
Committee of Thirty are beginning to
report to Mrs. H. J. Ryan on the pro
gress and to turn in money and
pledges. The committee members will
bring their work to a completion at
once, and hand ove,r the rest of the
pledges to the treasurer. The pledges
from the members of five organizations
have already been received by her,
promising the subscribers will pay
from twenty-five cents to one dollar a
month for the next half year.
Mrs. H. C. Brown, of the clothing
committee of the faculty organization,
has received an offer for free trans
portation for another consignment of
goods, which will have to leave the
campus not later than a week from
Saturday. 930 garments have already
been shipped from the campus, and
the work of campus women under the
new student organization has placed
many more in the hands of the commit
tee. Old clothes of all sorts are want
ed for the next shipment. Sweaters
are garments which are greatly
needed. The committee will make any
repairs necessary in the clothes re
ceived.
In the ten days since the beginning
of the campaign for organizing the
alumni, pledges and money have been
received from Evergreen, Cal., Salt
Lake City, and Tonopah, rr'sed by the
graduates of those cities. Requests for
pledge cards have come from a num
ber of other communities. Immediate
ly on hearing of the Stanford .relief
fund a number of alumni in New York
raised a fund and sent it to Mrs. E. D.
Adams, secretary of the alumni com
mittee, before any request was sent.
