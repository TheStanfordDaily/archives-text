Quick on the Trigger
With a Snap-Shot Eye
THE crack trapshooter has to
have steady nerves and muscles
absolutely under control — always
ready to swing his gun into place
and bring down his clay pigeon. This
means trained, not to the minute,
but to the split-second.
We present the names of some
famous crack shots. They like to
smoke, but take no chances on a
tobacco that might "throw them
off." They use Tuxedo because
it is mild, relaxing, steadying —
strictly pure.

The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
Tuxedo is made of only the
finest, choicest, selected leaves of
perfectly aged Burley tobacco. It
is made by the original " Tuxedo
Process" which removes every trace
of bite and sting and develops all
the wonderful mildness, fragrance
and flavor of the Burley Leaf in a
way that no other brand of tobacco
has ever successfully imitated.
YOU CAN BUY TUXEDO EVERYWHERE

" I find complete enjoy
ment in Tuxedo. It's a nerve
steadier and a sure fire, slow
burning tobacco. "
