# EMIL HOLLMAN WRITES OF MILITARY OXFORD
## Professor Fairclough Receives Letter From Rhodes Scholar Describing Changes in University 
### 
Interesting sidelights on the pres
ent situation in the English universi
ties are given in a lette.r written by
Emil F. Hollnian, '13, and addressed to
Professor H. R. Fairclough, who has
forwarded the following quotations.
Hollnian is the Rhodes scholar select
ed last year by the scholarship com
mittee, of which Professor Fairclough
is chairman, and, after a tour of the
world, as Chancellor Jordan's secre
tary, the Stanford man has entered
Oxford for a four-years' course:
"I am told repeatedly that this is not
the familiarâ€”not the normal Oxford,
and well that it is not! The call of
the bugle in the morning, the man
euvering in the streets and parks, the
presence of countless khaki uniforms,
convalescent wounded, and mounted
officers, gives the town a military
rather than academic appearance.
"There are 1800 fewer undergradu
ates that usual, most of the second
and third year men being either at the
front or in training. Those who are
left are either physically unfit or have
been forbidden to go to war by their
parents.
"Of the undergraduates in residence
one-half to two-thirds are 'Freshers,'
and most of these are enrolled in the
Officers' Training Corps, with a pros
pect of receiving commissions either
at the end of this term or at the end
of the year.
"Sports in these strenuous times
are given only minor consideration.
The response to the call to arms
among the athletically inclined has
been so general that there is scarcely n
'Blue" or "Varsity" man left. There is no
prospect even of intercollegiate sports
However, a little rowing is being done,
and so each day finds me for a short
time on the river. As for studies. lam
more than pleased at the outlook for
doing three years of profitable work
here. Although lacking in advanced
courses, such as those given in con
nection with hospital work, the med
ical course is especially well ground
ed in physiology and anatomy. I am
planning to spend six weeks in Eden
burg at Christmas time, mostly in the
dissecting room."
