# "Tell the Reporters the Truth"

"Tell the reporters the truth"—an
appeal for thinking veracity that is
echoed from Maine to California. In
Ohio a law was enacted recently pro
viding for the punishment of news
papers telling white lies or 'whoppers,'
but including an amendment under
which the arrest of any person who
wilfully deceives a newspaper report
er, was legalized. The first victims
to be haled into court were of the
feminine sex —dollars to doughnuts it
was an item intended for the society
columns.
The problems of the metropolitan
news-gatherer are not those of the
budding journalists 011 this Five-
Times-a-Week, yet since we have
sniffed of printers' ink on our own
handiwork, we hasten to grasp the
cudgels for an abused big brother —
today's communication by a misquoted
citizen of a southern county might be
the motive for thoughtless abuse of
the whole fraternity.
It is obvious that the greater por
tion of information printed is founded
on the statements of a third party. To
be 'on the spot' is an occurrence re
served for the drama —to get a story at
first hand is the eve.it of a week. This
does not apply to such an extent in
college circles, yet the item is usually
baaed 011 the statements of others.
It is left for the .reporter to dig for
the truth, and it can be said that they
dig hard and willingly. Sometimes
they are imposed upon, 011 occasion
they make an error that is vital —but
no two persons ever described an
event alike. We are laying our bet on
the veracity of the average reporter,
and in the three cases out of four, the
Bureau of Accuracy item should be
charged to the informer.
