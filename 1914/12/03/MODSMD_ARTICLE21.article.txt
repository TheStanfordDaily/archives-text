John Masefield is probably the most
popular of the present-day British
poets, aside from Rudyard Kipling. His
lons poem, "The Everlasting Mercy,"
was characterized by Arnold Bennet
as the "best thing written during the
year." Though of English birth,
Masefield was tending bar in New
York when iiis ability to write was dis
covered. It was probably from those
experiences that his great sympathy
for"the down and outer," the theme
of his best poems, was gained. The
following poem was taken from his
book, "Salt Sea Ballads."
'It's a sunny pleasant anchorage, is
Kingdom Come,
Where crew is always layin' aft for
double-tots o' rum,
'N' there's dancin' 'n'fiddlin' of ev'ry
kind o' sort,
It's a fine place for sailor-men is that
there port.
'N' I wish —
I wish as I was there.
'The winds is never notliin' more than
jest light airs,
'N' no-one gets belayin'-pinned, 'n' no
one never swears,
Yer free to loaf an' laze around, yer
pipe atween yer lips,
Lollin' on the fo'c's'le, sonny, lookin'
at the ships.
'N' I wish—
I wish as I was there.
'For ridin' in the anchorage the ships
of all the world
Have got one anchor down 'n' all sails
furled.
All the sunken hookers 'n' the crews
as took 'n' died
They lays there merry, sonny; swing
ing to the tide.
'N' I wish—
I wish as I was there.
'Drowned old wooden hookers green
wi' drippin' wrack,
Ships as never fetched to port, as nev
er came back,
Swingin* to the blushin' tide, dippin'
to the swell,
'N' the crews all singin', sonny, beatin'
on the bell.
'N' I wish—
I wish as I was there.
