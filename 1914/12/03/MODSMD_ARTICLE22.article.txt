Editor The Daily Palo Alto:
Will you lie so kind as to allow n*ie
a little spacp in your paper to set my
self aright with the Stanford students
and friends?
My attention has been called to the
article published in the Los Angeles
Times on Monday, November 23. This
article has part of it in quotation, and
says that it is a report of an inter
view with me on the question of Rugby
and American football. The first par
agraph of the quotation is exactly
what I said. The second paragraph,
which includes the following, "The im
portation of Australian and other play
ers by the Stanford team has prob
ably had more to do with with the
crystalization of sentiment against thy
retention of Rugby around tlie Univer
sity of California and the schools i i
the northern end of the state than
any other one influence," is absolute
ly a false statement. I never said
such a thing, never said anything that
could have been construed or twisted
into such a thing, and have never
thought of such a thing. I did not
even know there were any Australian
players on the Stanford team this yea'-.
1 do not blame Stanford friends for
feeling angry toward me in cases
where I am not known, and where
the article is believed as genuine.
112 assure you that 1 have always had
the highest opinion of Stanford in ev
ery way, athletically and otherwise. I
am proud of the fact that Frank
Reeves, one of the San Bernardino
high school graduates, and a former
student of mine, is on the team. lam
also glad that many other students of
mine, and graduates of this school,
are in Stanford.

Again assuring you that the article
is a gross misrepresentation, and that
I have the kindliest feeling toward
Stanford University, I am,
