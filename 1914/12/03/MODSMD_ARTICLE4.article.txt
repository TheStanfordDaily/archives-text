# ARCH PERRIN DENOUNCES PRESENT PRISON SYSTEM
## Chaplain of San Quentin Says Existing Methods of Criminal Punishment Are All Wrong. 
### 
"No man ever comes out of a prison
as good as he was when he went in,"
was the emphatic statement of Rev.
Arch Perrin, '00, last night. "The idea
of prisons should be to keep them as
empty as possible. Everything is
w.rong with the present system."
Perrin told of the real life in San
Quentin prison, and emphasized the
need of reform. He strongly advocat
ed a course of instruction in prison
work in colleges, that men other than
politicians could be had for prison
authorities.
The talk is the first of a series plan
ned by the Social Service Committee
of the Christian Associations. The
rest of the series will be given next
semester.
