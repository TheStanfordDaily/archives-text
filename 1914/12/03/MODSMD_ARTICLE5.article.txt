# STANFORD EVINCES MUCH INTEREST IN THE DANSANT
## Vocal Quartet and Freshman Stringed Quintet Will Add to Clinic Entertainment. 
### 
To add to the Stanford atmosphere
at the Clinic's Dansant, at the Palace
Hotel Saturday evening, the Vocal
Quartet and the Stringed Quintet will
enliven the program with a number of
up-to-date selections.
The quartet is composed of S. C.
Walker, '14, W E. Dunlap, '14, C. M.
Miller, '14, and J. W. Bennett, '15.
Their singing has contributed largely
to the success of many campus enter
tainments and Glee Club programs.
Negro melodies in a Southern setting
and a choice number of popular pieces
are promised by the quartet, and it is
certain that their efforts will meet
with approval.
Tn company with the quartet, the
Freshman Stringed Quintet, composed
of M. M. Barnes, W. H. Brown, R. P.
Johnson, W. P. Coleman, and R. R.
Coleman, will feature a program of soft
Hawaiian airs.
It was at first thought that the en
tire Stanford Glee Club would be able
to co-operate with the band in liven
ing up the dance, but pressure of stud
ies and the failure to secure the de
sired pieces of new music, caused the
members of the club to abandon their
original intention.
Tables are going fast, and everything
points to the success of the Dansant.
Such an undertaking has never been
attempted before, but the campus has
evinced a lively interest in the scheme,
and the various clubs, fraternities, and
sororities are co-operating with the
San Francisco "medics" in a very sat
isfactory manner.
A special train will leave the cam
pus in time to reach the city by 3:45.
The musical program will commence
promptly at 4 o'clock. Round-trip
tickets may be purchased for 95 cenH,
and will be good over the week-end.
This is an unusual opportunity for the
Student. Body to set in touch with th<*
Medical College in Sail Francisco, and
it is hoped that many Stanford men
and women w'll help to further the
cause for which the Dansnnt is heintr
held.
