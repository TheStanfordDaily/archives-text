# EIGHTEEN ALL-BLACKS GRANTED SILVER MEDALS
## Circle "S" Awarded to Members of Victorious Intercollegiate Soccer Team 
### 
Eighteen members of the "All-
Blacks" were awarded silver medals
by the Executive Committee at last
night's meeting. With the exception of
their first encounter with the Titans,
the Second Varsity has an unbroken
succession of wins. It is as a result
of this notable record, as well as the
fact that much of the success of the
Varsity can be directly traced to the
stiff competition furnished by these
men all through the season, that the
reward was made.
Action was also taken by the Exec
utive Committee to grant gold medals
to the members of winning Varsity
teams. As a result of this, members
of this season's Varsity football team
will .receive gold footballs.
Stanford soccer men who opposed
California were honored by receiving
the circle "S." The Stanford team was
victorious in two consecutive contests.
The games won this season raised the
total number of Stanford soccer wins
to six. Three tie matches have been
played between the rival universities,
but not a single defeat has been
chalked up against Stanford.
