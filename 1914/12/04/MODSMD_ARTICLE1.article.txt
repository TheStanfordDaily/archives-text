# DANSANT OPPORTUNITY TO AID HOME CHARITY
## STANFORD FREE TREATS THOUSANDS OF POOR AND SICK EACH YEAR. AUXILLIARY HELPS IN HOMES TABLES MAY STILL BE RESERVED FOR PALACE HOTEL DANCE AND BENEFIT. 
### 
For the students to add their share
in making many San Francisco tene
ments seem more bright to their hope
less occupants—that is what the Stan
ford Clinic expects in extending an
invitation to the campus to attend the
Dansant at the Palace Hotel tomorrow
evening.
In the Stanford Free Clinic, situated
at Sacramento and Webste.r streets,
sixty doctors devote their time to ex
amining the poor and sick and advis
ing and prescribing for them in their
distress. These physicians give the
same amount of skilled knowledge to
reclaiming the physical wrecks that
seek their assistance as the wealthiest
patient of their practice. The list of
cases discloses the large number of
100,000 treatments during the past
year.
But these men cannot know whether
their advice is being accepted or their
orders for rest and good food carried
out, and to accomplish this end, a num
ber of philanthropic persons have or
ganized the Auxiliary to the Stanford
Clinic, a society which employs a so
cial worker to bring the work of the
clinic into the homes of its patients.
Mrs. Harnett, with wonderful tact and
sympathy, inquires into the condition
of the suffering, and cares for the pre
scriptions they have received.
Obtaining positions for the jobless,
collecting food for the starving, en
couraging the hopeless, such problems
she solves successfully with the aid
of a small fund which is supplied by
the Stanford students.
And now the opportunity is offered
for the students to combine a good
time with such a worthy enterprise.
An afternoon and evening of dance,
song, and pleasure is held out as n
means of further ministering to the
needy.
An entrance fee of $1.50 and a rail
road roundtrip ticket for flsc are ill
the funds necessary to the passig of a
very pleasant week-end, pleasant in
fact, and pleasant in the anticipation
of the joy it will bring to many of the
needy. Tables may be reserved for
any number by advising Dr. Stolz, or
Miss Eugenia Burns, '15. A large num
ber have already signified their inten
tions of being present, but many tick
ets are still unsold. The Stanford stu
dents should get behind the project
and boost it.
