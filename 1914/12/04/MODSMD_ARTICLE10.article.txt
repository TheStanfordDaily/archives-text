# Chaparral-Pelican to Alight on Quad Monday
## Hammer and Coffin Will Carry Befeathered Chappie to California Campus. 
### 
Briming with originality in humor
and design the Chaparral edition 01
1 lie Pelican will fly from its perch
among the Berkeley oaks and hover
over the Quad Monday. Hammer and
Coffin will issue a Pelican edition of
The Chaparral on the California cam
pus simultaneously, but "Chappie"
and his cohorts claim no credit in the
"Pelly" which will greet the "Farm"
Monday. It is composed entirely of
contributions from the regular statf
of the Blue and Gold comic, and will
be an enjoyable departure in the field
of local journalism.
The cover casts the mysterious spell
of the Orient in an artistic color com
bination of purple, green, black, and
white. A profusion of clever art work
features the issue. A double-page
drawing, "The Race for Popularity,"
by Miss Anna Wille, '17, is of profes
sional quality, suggesting the C. D.
Gibson of old. The frontispiece, "The
Ex," by Bud Robinson, '15, pictures the
semester trials with the force of a
new idea, and the usual skill of the
"Pelly' art editor.
In his editorial Fred Faust, '15,
comments in terse fashion upon inter
collegiate .relations. "Chappie XIX"
(M. A. Hagen, '15,) treats the same
subject in his "Now That's" in the
Pelican edition of The Chaparral, from
the Stanford point of view. He also
comments upon the superior rooting
section of California at the Big Game,
and expresses the hope that an ex
change number between the two uni
versity comics may be an annual event.
An effort is being made to place the
two comics on sale at each university.
