# There's Enough For Both

This is a hard year for a thin purse—
the demands for charities that cannot
be denied are taking a larger share of
funds from those who have, for relief
of others less fortunate. In the call
for food and clothing to give the Bel
gian homeless life and shelter, an ap
peal lias been made to the world's non
combatants that is unequalled in his
tory. The Great War has swept over
all of Europe in four short months, and
the business of all the world has been
demoralized—America feels the de
pression, and the thousands of needy
poor are augmented by thousands
more who had been perilously near the
existence line in normal years.
Stanford heard the call for relief
that came from the Belgian millions,
and in the short space of three days
placed twenty-four hundred dollars in
the hands of the committee fo.r the
purchase of food. Even this glorious
contribution was not the full measure
of generosity, for immediately after
a goodly sum was pledged by Stan
ford folk to be forwarded in monthly
installments. And all the while the
sewing and the collection of wearing
apparel went on under the direction of
enthusiastic workers. Stanford had
done her best for this unique world
charity, and the best left little to be
expected from this co.rner.
The months of storms and cold came,
and at the very time that the country
was giving liberally to Belgian suf
ferers, the Associated Charities in San
Francisco was on the verge of col
lapse for lack of funds to care for our
own suffering. An appeal was made,
and the response was instant and com
pletely adequate. Now it is Stanford's
turn again, with the largest single
charity in the West, the Stanford Clin
ic, as the medium through which the
charity is given.
The call on the generosity of those
wno nave, will be met as others have
been met, for Americans know that the
gifts will not impose one tithe of the
deprivation on the giver that the War
lias imposed upon all classes in Eu
rope, and upon the less fortunate in
America.
There should be no budget system
this winter in the giving of charity—
one need is not to be balanced against
another. Tljere is enough for both in
this crisis—if we have done our share
in the one case, there remains the oth
er appeal.
A ticket purchased for the Clinic
dansant is a dollar and a half of un
alloyed charity — your attendance
would only mean an extra return for
the money.
