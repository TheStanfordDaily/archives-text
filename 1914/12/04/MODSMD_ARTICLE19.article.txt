# For Those Who Fail
## 
### 
Joaquin Miller, "the Poet of the
Sierras," known and beloved by all
Cahfornians, is the author of today's
poem. His real name is Cincinnatus
Hiner Miller:
"All honor to him who shall win the
prize,"
The world has cried for a thousand
years,
But to him who tries and who fails
and dies,
I give great honor and glory and
tears.
Give glory and honor and pitiful tears
To all who fail in their deeds sub
lime,
Their ghosts are many in the van of
years,
They were born with Time in ad
vance of Time.
Ah, great is the hero who wins a name,
But greater many and many a time
Some pale-faced fellow who dies in
shame
And lets God finish the thought sub
lime.
And great is the man with a sword
undrawn,
And good is the man who refrains
from wine;
But the man who fails and yet still
fights on,
Lo, he is the twin-brother of mine.
