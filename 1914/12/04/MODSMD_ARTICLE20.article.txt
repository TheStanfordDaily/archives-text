# Military Training For Colleges Is Suggested
## 
### 
Something akin to Oxford's Officers'
Training Corps is suggested for Amer
ican colleges in a proposal to bring
the entire student body under physical
training, and also provide for the na
tional defense. It is urged by Puck
(New York) that our colleges and uni
versities be turned into training-camps.
Secondary schools would be unlikely
to lag far behind. We read:
"Were we suddenly called upon to
face a crisis such as Europe was called
upon to face, with but very little warn
ing, it would find us woefully unpre
pared. In the security of our peace we
have neglected to build up an organi
zation capable of performing the mul
titudinous services of war, or of any
great disaster, either political or phys
ical, which may come into the nation's
life. The thousands of young men in
colleges and universities otter a tieln
for the development of such a force of
trained men in a way that would en
tirely revolutionize our educational as
well as our defensive system.
"As our athletics are conducted to
day, a few picked men have tramein,
coaches, rubbers, and waiters for the
purpose of preparing them for a con
flict. with a correspondingly Am nil
group of similarly trained men from
other institutions. The remainder of
the student body, which makes this
training possible, is meanwhile phys
ically utterly neglected,
"Yet the average young man enter
ing college is quite as much in need of
physical development and training as
of mental. The country, too, is in
need of disciplined, trained men; and
this double need can be metâ€”can be
met for less money than is expended
on a single season's football team. A
system of military drill, under the su
pervision of experts in military dis
ci plino and hygiene, with the co-opera
tion of the athletic associations of the
colleges, and under the auspices of the
United States government, would prove
of inestimable value to every student
in the college, and would furnish to
the nation a groundwork upon which a
magnificent, national service could be
established. A spirit of true patriotism
and of unselfish public service would
be instilled in the students. The nu
cleus of a trained military corps would
be established from which officers and
men could be recruited, with little ad
ditional training in time of war."
