"If Just for tho Friends You Make."
"The melancholy days have come,
The saddest of the year,
Wot's the use ol' this college stuff?
Wot's the good of sticking here?
I'd rather be in the city,
Earning money to win a wife;
Come to think of it, Hill,
Do you think this is the life?
"Why, it's uj) early in the morning,
Late to bed at night,
And I get so doggoned sleepy,
T have to fight, fight, fight
To keep from dozin',
While the profs hand out their line;
Gee, Bill, I have the sweetest dreams
Of the good old summer time!"
"Pete, you've got it easy,
You haven't earned a cent;
How many hundreds did you spend?
Can you show me where it went?
From the way you talked.
Your better sense is dead,
Think it over, Pete,
You don't mean what you said."
"It must have been the weather, Bill,
That pulled my spirits down,
And those final exes, —
Say, even you must frown.
, But, Bo, I take it back,
I was only half awake,
And I swear that college is the only
place,
If just for the friends you make."
"If Just for tho Friends You Make."
