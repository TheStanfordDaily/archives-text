# Campus Fund Brings Life to Home of Aged Pair in San Francisco
## 
### 
A tottering old man entered the of
j fice of the Stanford Clinic in San Fran
| cisco one day last month and regis
tered a pitiful appeal for help—for
himself and his frail little wife. He
I was suffering from a blighting attack
| of heart disease, and was barely able
! to whisper his modest request in a tone
I full of suffering and patient resigna
| tion. The docto.rs diagnosed his case
and ordered absolute rest and quiet as
the only means of his recovery.
Mrs. Barnett, the Auxiliary social
service worker, accompanied the pa
tient to his home, and a depressing
spectacle met her eyes. His wife, a
thin, warn little body, sighed her
greeting as they entered the room.
She could not rise, being stricken with
a hopeless case of paralysis.
And the home—just one bare,
meagre room in a broken-down water
front tenement. The glass had long
since been shaken from the windows,
I and the cold November wind whistled
relentlessly through the tiny room,
striking the thinly-clad form of the
paralytic until she shivered with a
pitiful chill.
Every day the old man —weak as he
was—lifted his little wife from the bed
to the chair and then to the table, while
he arranged the pieces of rickety
furniture and scrubbed the splintered
boards of the floor.
Rest, indeed! His back ached from
the exertion of carrying the emaciat
ed creature about, and his small pen
sion would hardly pay for food and the
rent, leaving no funds to b.ring him
relief from the killing labor.
But with the money raised in the
last campaign conducted on the cam
pus, Mrs. Barnett purchased his wife
an invalid chair that the grateful wo
man could wheel about the room as
she performed her daily duties. The
aged couple are happy now —the old
pensioner is recovering his health rap
idly, and all is contentment and peace
in the tiny room of the old, battered
tenement.
This is one of a thousand charities
that Mrs. Barnett has been able to ac
complish through the backing of the
Auxiliary. But the fund is very low —
will you help tomorrow night to in
crease it?
