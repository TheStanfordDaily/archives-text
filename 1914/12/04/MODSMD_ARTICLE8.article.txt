# CELTICS PLAY VARSITY
## TITLE OF EXPOSITION LEAGUE HANGS IN BALANCE. Most Important Soccer Game of Season Will Call Forth Strongest Line-ups of Opponents. 
### 
Stanford soccer men will line-up
against the Celtic Club tomorrow tor
their last match of the season, when
this year's championship of the Exposi
tion Soccer League will be decided.
The Celts will put a fast team on the
field and will make a strong bid for the
honors. Although the Cardinal eleven
lias once met defeat at their hands, in
the last game staged against the Col
tics, the Stanford team, crippled by the
removal of Shaw during the first half,
played with a ten-man team to a fast
victory over their opponents.
Another game pointed to by the
dopesters as significant is the Califor
nia-Celtic game of two weeks ago when
the Ulue and Gold combination put it
over the club team in a 4 to 3 win. A
week later, the same California eleven
went down to a T5 to 0 defeat, at the
hands of the Cardinal. Tf the scores
of preliminary games speak truth, the
final honors in the struggle fo,r soccer
supremacy should fall to the Cardinal.
The line-up, as announced by Train
er Maloney and Captain Blodget, is
practically that of the last intercolle
giate game. The only change is in the
half-back line, where Alderton has
been replaced by Vanderburg. Vander
burg appeared in the Stanford ranks
for the intercollegiate game of Novem
ber 14th, but was forced to give up his
place in the second match on account
of an injury to his ankle.
The other two positions at half will
once more be filled by Boyle and Cass.
The forward line will find five strong
layers representing the Cardinal. Cap
tain Blodget will appear at center for
ward, where his accurate boot will
keep the Celtic's goal-keepe.r on the
lookout. Ex-Captain Higgins and Art
Erb, inside right and left, should prove
themselves factors in the day's scoring.
Kyle who made the second tally for
Stanford in the last match against Cal
ifornia will be Carroll's partner at
wing forward.
Dutton and Adams will once more
fill their positions at full and may be
looked to for clever blocks and long
gains for the Cardinal. Ring, who has
proved himself a steady, dependable
defense man, will guard the Stanford
goal.
The game will be staged at the Ocean
Shore grounds in San Francisco.
