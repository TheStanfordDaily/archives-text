"Pipe Sm >king gives
added pleasure to a golfer
when the pipe is filled with
Tuxedo. Tuxedo provides
more keen enjoyment than
any other tobacco 1 knou). "
The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
Tuxedo positively cannot bite —not
even if you smoke pipeful after
pipeful, as many as you can crowd
into a day or a week.
Tuxedo is made of only the finest,
choicest, selected leaves of perfectly
aged Burley tobacco. It is made by
the original "Tuxedo Process"
which removes every trace of bite and
sting and develops all the wonderful
mildness, fragrance and flavor of the
Burley Leaf in a way that no other
brand of tobacco has ever success
fully imitated.

"Pipe Sm >king gives
added pleasure to a golfer
when the pipe is filled with
Tuxedo. Tuxedo provides
more keen enjoyment than
any other tobacco 1 knou). "
The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
Tuxedo positively cannot bite —not
even if you smoke pipeful after
pipeful, as many as you can crowd
into a day or a week.
Tuxedo is made of only the finest,
choicest, selected leaves of perfectly
aged Burley tobacco. It is made by
the original "Tuxedo Process"
which removes every trace of bite and
sting and develops all the wonderful
mildness, fragrance and flavor of the
Burley Leaf in a way that no other
brand of tobacco has ever success
fully imitated.
