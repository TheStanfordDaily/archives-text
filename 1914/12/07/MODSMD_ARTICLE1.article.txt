# PAPER COMPARISONS FAVOR CALIFORNIA IN 1915 INTERCOLLEGIATE
## Stanford Should Develop Strong Rugby Fifteen With Twelve Varsity Ruggers in Fold SEVENTEEN VETERANS OF RIVAL CAMP ELIGIBLE 
### 
Although the 1914 football victories
are now but a memory, and the main
current of interest is already turning
to the spring sports, baseball, track,
and crew, many a Stanford rugby fan
has wondered what sort of a fifteen
will represent the Cardinal next sea
son when she stacks up against Cali
fornia on the home grounds. With
eleven of the glorious eighteen who
swept the Blue and Gold off their feet
three weeks ago, and seven substi
tutes signifying their intention of re
turning to college in the fall, support
ers of the Cardinal may well anticipate
another powerful aggregation, with
sturdy veterans as the backbone.
Seven men who have tasted Big
Game blood on more than one occasion
will either graduate or be ineligible.
The forward line promises to be the
heaviest loser, with Captain Gard at
breakaway, Blase at lock, Clover in
the middle rank berth, and Hall at
front rank, among the missing. The
absence of these staunch ruggers from
the line-up will necessarily leave a big
gap to be filled in the pack.
The remains practically
intact, with the exception of two posi
tions. Reeves and Burns at wing, and
Andrews, guardian of the laist defense,
will not be among those who will sign
up for practice next year.
Six veterans and four substitutes
will vie for places in the 1915 scrum.
The regulars are Soper and Wines do
ing the hooking, Braden and Rehm
holding down middle rank, Pettingill
locking the scrum, and Wylie as the
lone breakaway. The German "S"
men eligible are Ogden, Halsted, Bloe
ser, and Henry.
The 1914 backfield, which rugby
critics unanimously agree to be the
best scoring machine in California's
rugby history, will see practically the
same personnel in 191.". Erb will once
again bo prepared to snap the pigskin
back to his first five, where Austin
will receive and pass to Lachmund, his
second five-eighths mate, who, in turn,
will transfer to Captain-elect Danny
Carroll, the ball finally reaching Ur
ban at wing. The men who graced tho
sidelines this fall. Templeton, Swi
gart, and Walker, will undoubtedly
make a strong bid for honors. In ad
dition to the enumerated players, Da
vidson, who won his lottpr as second
five substitute in the 1912 intercolle
giate, will once more be in the fold.
Stanford Ibis year boasted of the
fastest second team, popularly known
as the "Stanford All-Blacks," which
ever whipped a Varsity into fighting
form. From their ..ranks one may find
possibilities for next, year's fifteen,
among the forwards being Clark, Bihl
man, Jacomini. and Card, while 11i o
backfield shows Laine, Mavberry,
West, and Kirksey as likely timber.
