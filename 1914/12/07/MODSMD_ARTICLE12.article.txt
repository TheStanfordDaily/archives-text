Paris, Dec. 7. —The allied offensive
movement, which is taking place along
the entire battle line of Belgium and
France continues vigorously with fair
success. The French artillery, con
sisting chiefly of a new shipment of
guns, just recently arrived, is proving
far more effective than the German ar
tillery, outranging them in every in
stance. Reports of the heaviest fight
ing come from the Alsace regions.
Teuton trenches thrown up in the Ar
gonne forests are being made subject
to heavy bombardment. The new al
lied positions acquired along the
Yser river are being successfully
maintained.
French Report Progress Near Lys.
Paris, Dec. 7. —The Communique
states: "We have made sensible pro
gress to the north of the river Lys, in
Belgium, our infantry having taken
two lines of trenches by daylight at
tack. This is a position between Dix
mude and Ypres, which has been dis
puted for a month. It was taken and
held in spite of the enemy's
fire. Rheims is being severely bom
barded, and the fighting in the Ar
gonne is extremely hot. The French

points already won.

Berlin, Dec. 7. —(Official.) —The at
tacks of the French in Flanders and
to the south of the Lys have been re

1200 prisoners, is favorable.
Roads to Warsaw Taken by Kaiser.
London, Dec. 7.—Following the tak
ing of Lodz, both of the German flanks
have advanced twenty-five miles in
land, thereby gaining control of the
Haih railroads leading into Warsaw,
and threatening the Russian line of
communications on the southern
front. If Teuton successes continue,
the offensive movement of the Czar's
army at Czenstochowo must be aban
doned, and the attacking forces about
Cracow withdrawn.
Mines Cripple Merchant Shipping.
Petrograd, Dec. 7.—Ocean mines are
working havoc with both commerce
and armed fleets of all nations. The
Turkish cruise,r Hamidieh struck a
mine Saturday, damaging the vessel
seriously and enabling it to reach Con
stantinople only with the greatest dif
f'eulty. Yesterday the German sub

United Press Telegraphic Report
Paris, Dec. 7. —The allied offensive
movement, which is taking place along
the entire battle line of Belgium and
France continues vigorously with fair
success. The French artillery, con
sisting chiefly of a new shipment of
guns, just recently arrived, is proving
far more effective than the German ar
tillery, outranging them in every in
stance. Reports of the heaviest fight
ing come from the Alsace regions.
Teuton trenches thrown up in the Ar
gonne forests are being made subject
to heavy bombardment. The new al
lied positions acquired along the
Yser river are being successfully
maintained.
French Report Progress Near Lys.

gress to the north of the river Lys, in
Belgium, our infantry having taken
two lines of trenches by daylight at
tack. This is a position between Dix
mude and Ypres, which has been dis
puted for a month. It was taken and
held in spite of the enemy's
fire. Rheims is being severely bom
barded, and the fighting in the Ar
gonne is extremely hot. The French
took several trenches, and maintained
points already won.
Germans Winning in Fust Prussia.
Berlin, Dec. 7. —(Official.) —The at
tacks of the French in Flanders and
to the south of the Lys have been re

ing of Lodz, both of the German flanks
have advanced twenty-five miles in
land, thereby gaining control of the
Haih railroads leading into Warsaw,
and threatening the Russian line of
communications on the southern
front. If Teuton successes continue,
the offensive movement of the Czar's
army at Czenstochowo must be aban
doned, and the attacking forces about
Cracow withdrawn.
Mines Cripple Merchant Shipping.
