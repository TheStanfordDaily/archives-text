# Plans for a Bowl
## 
### 
Twenty-five thousand spectators
watching the Finest rugby exhibition of
the year, paying two dollars and a half
for the privilege, or fifty thousand peo
ple enjoying an intercollegiate strug
gle, paying a dollar and a half apiece
for their seats —which is the better sit
uation for intercollegiate sport and the
future of the rugby game?
Less than two years of life remain
for the wooden bleachers of Stanford
Field, unless elaborate and extensive
.repairs are undertaken. The Associat
ed Students are accumulating a large
surplus for the rebuilding—is it worth
while to put our all into a stadium that
will be overcrowded at its initial game,
rickety and out of date within the de
cade, an athletic field with its big event
a biennial spectacle?
A solution of the problem that con
fronts our Hoard of Control would
seem to lie in the plan for an intercol
legiate amphitheatre, located near the
center of population, San Francisco.
The approach of the great exposition
centers the attention of the nation on
this city, and to a certain extent, dur
ing the athletic season of 1915, upon
the games and competitions of Califor
nia's two universities. Fortunately,
for the Exposition Game, the stadium
on the Grounds will be available, but
the weather conditions of that district
preclude it as a permanent possibility
Why not a great Bowl, or Amphithea
tre, modeled after those of the East
which are completed and under con
struction, with a seating capacity that
runs above fifty thousand? The loca
tion might be determined at a later
date, the expense born by the student
bodies of the two institutions, with the
Olympic Club taking a fifth interest.
The stadium would lie of the best per
manent construction, preferably >112
reinforced concrete; the interest on
the investment would be met by the
revenue from the interclub rugby
games, soccer matches, outdoor pa
geants, for which the amphitheatre
could be readily rented.
With the increasing interest in foot
hall that the record attendance of the
last game attests, the completion of
the bowl would prove a great factor
in rugby's race for popularity—lack of
seats and a prohibitive price eliminate
thousands now, who would become ar
dent. fans of sports intercollegiate.
A forty per cent slice of stock would
cost us no more than we plan to ex
pend at home, and elimination of the
Big Game on Stanford Field would
postpone the necessity of repair for
several years. The plan merits con
sideration.

Twenty-five thousand spectators
watching the Finest rugby exhibition of
the year, paying two dollars and a half
for the privilege, or fifty thousand peo
ple enjoying an intercollegiate strug
gle, paying a dollar and a half apiece
for their seats —which is the better sit
uation for intercollegiate sport and the
future of the rugby game?
Less than two years of life remain
for the wooden bleachers of Stanford
Field, unless elaborate and extensive
.repairs are undertaken. The Associat
ed Students are accumulating a large
surplus for the rebuilding—is it worth
while to put our all into a stadium that
will be overcrowded at its initial game,
rickety and out of date within the de
cade, an athletic field with its big event
a biennial spectacle?
A solution of the problem that con
fronts our Hoard of Control would
seem to lie in the plan for an intercol
legiate amphitheatre, located near the
center of population, San Francisco.
The approach of the great exposition
centers the attention of the nation on
this city, and to a certain extent, dur
ing the athletic season of 1915, upon
the games and competitions of Califor
nia's two universities. Fortunately,
for the Exposition Game, the stadium
on the Grounds will be available, but
the weather conditions of that district
preclude it as a permanent possibility
Why not a great Bowl, or Amphithea
tre, modeled after those of the East
which are completed and under con
struction, with a seating capacity that
runs above fifty thousand? The loca
tion might be determined at a later
date, the expense born by the student
bodies of the two institutions, with the
Olympic Club taking a fifth interest.
The stadium would lie of the best per
manent construction, preferably >112
reinforced concrete; the interest on
the investment would be met by the
revenue from the interclub rugby
games, soccer matches, outdoor pa
geants, for which the amphitheatre
could be readily rented.
With the increasing interest in foot
hall that the record attendance of the
last game attests, the completion of
the bowl would prove a great factor
in rugby's race for popularity—lack of
seats and a prohibitive price eliminate
thousands now, who would become ar
dent. fans of sports intercollegiate.
A forty per cent slice of stock would
cost us no more than we plan to ex
pend at home, and elimination of the
Big Game on Stanford Field would
postpone the necessity of repair for
several years. The plan merits con
sideration.
