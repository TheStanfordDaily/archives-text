# The 						Poet That Fitted
## 
### 
Rudyard Kipling, although an Eng
lishman, is as widely known and ad
mired in America as he is in his native \
land. He is especially noted for his
shorter poems, of which today's is a
sample, being taken from his "Depart
mental Ditties;"
Though tangled and twisted the course i
of true love,
This ditty explains
No tangle's so tangled it cannot im
prove
If the Lover has brains.
Ere the steamer bore him Eastward,
Sleary was engaged to marry
An attractive girl at Tunbridge whom
he called "my little Carrie."
Sleary's pay was very modest; Slea.y
was the other way.
Who can cook a two-plate dinner on
eight paltry dibs a day?
Long he pondered o'er this question in
his scantily furnished quarters—
Then proposed to Minnie Boffkin,eldest
of Judge Boffkin's daughters.
Certainly an impecunious Subaltern
was not a catch
Hut the Boffkins knew that Minnie
mightn't make another match.
So they recognized the business and,
to feed and clothe the bride,
Got him made a Something-Something
somewhere on the Bombay side.
Anyhow, the Lillet carried pay enough
for him to marry—
As the artless Sleary put it:—"Just
the thing for me and Carrie."
Did he, therefore, jilt Miss Boffkin —
impulse of a baser mind?
No! He started epileptic fits of an ap
palling kind.
(Of his modus operandi only this much
I could gather:—
"Pears shaving sticks will give you
little taste and lots of lather.")
Frequently in public places his afflic
tion used to smite
Sleary with distressing vigour—always
in the Boffkins' sisht.
Ere a week was over Minnie weepingly
returned his ring,
Told him his "unhappy weakness"
stopped all thoughts of mar
rying.
Sleary bore the information with a
chastened, holy joy—
(Epileptic fits don't matter in Political
employ,)
Wired three short words to Carrie—
took his ticket, packed his kit —
Bade farewell to Minnie Boffkin in
one last, long lingering fit.

Four weeks later, Carrie Sleary read—
and laughed until she wept—
Mrs. Boffkin's warning letter 011 the
"wretched epilept."
Year by year, in pious patience, venge
ful Mrs. Boffkin sits
Waiting for the Sleary babies to de
velop Sleary's fits.

the thing for me and Carrie."
Did he, therefore, jilt Miss Boffkin —
impulse of a baser mind?
No! He started epileptic fits of an ap
palling kind.
(Of his modus operandi only this much
I could gather:—
"Pears shaving sticks will give you
little taste and lots of lather.")
Frequently in public places his afflic
tion used to smite
Sleary with distressing vigour—always
in the Boffkins' sisht.
Ere a week was over Minnie weepingly
returned his ring,
Told him his "unhappy weakness"
stopped all thoughts of mar
rying.
Sleary bore the information with a
chastened, holy joy—
(Epileptic fits don't matter in Political
employ,)
Wired three short words to Carrie—
took his ticket, packed his kit —
Bade farewell to Minnie Boffkin in
one last, long lingering fit.

Four weeks later, Carrie Sleary read—
and laughed until she wept—
Mrs. Boffkin's warning letter 011 the
"wretched epilept."
Year by year, in pious patience, venge
ful Mrs. Boffkin sits
Waiting for the Sleary babies to de
velop Sleary's fits.
Rudyard Kipling, although an Eng
lishman, is as widely known and ad
mired in America as he is in his native \
land. He is especially noted for his
shorter poems, of which today's is a
sample, being taken from his "Depart
mental Ditties;"
Though tangled and twisted the course i
of true love,
This ditty explains
No tangle's so tangled it cannot im
prove
If the Lover has brains.
Ere the steamer bore him Eastward,
Sleary was engaged to marry
An attractive girl at Tunbridge whom
he called "my little Carrie."
Sleary's pay was very modest; Slea.y
was the other way.
Who can cook a two-plate dinner on
eight paltry dibs a day?
Long he pondered o'er this question in
his scantily furnished quarters—
Then proposed to Minnie Boffkin,eldest
of Judge Boffkin's daughters.
Certainly an impecunious Subaltern
was not a catch
Hut the Boffkins knew that Minnie
mightn't make another match.
So they recognized the business and,
to feed and clothe the bride,
Got him made a Something-Something
somewhere on the Bombay side.
Anyhow, the Lillet carried pay enough
for him to marry—
As the artless Sleary put it:—"Just
the thing for me and Carrie."
Did he, therefore, jilt Miss Boffkin —
impulse of a baser mind?
No! He started epileptic fits of an ap
palling kind.
