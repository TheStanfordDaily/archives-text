## Bonnheim Papers Are Due Eleventh; Carnot Question Soon to Be Chosen. 
### 
The contest for the Berwick Peace
Prize, usually scheduled for the first
semester of the year, has been post
poned until Tuesday, January 19. After
conference between Mr. Edward Ber
wick, and the local committee on the
contest, this action resulted in order
to give the contestants an opportuni
ty to prepare their essays during the
Christmas vacation. It will not be
necessary to submit papers befo.re the
date set for their presentation to the
public, but Associate Professor L. E.
Bassett, of the English Department,
wishes to have the names of those try
ing for the prize and the subjects
chosen for essays beforehand. This
information must be secured in order
to include the programs which are to
be printed.
Each speake.r will be limited to fif
teen minutes in presenting his essay,
and the of $50 will be awarded
for the paper which is prepared and
given in the best style.
Mr. Berwick, in a letter written to
Professor has suggested that
the general subjects of the essays be
on the contrast between the "Euro
pean System" of militarism, with its
savage motto, "If you want peace,
prepare for war," and the "American
System," which advocates peace in
preparation for peace.
Essays for the Bonnheim contest
will be due on January 11, and must
be submitted by 4:30 p. m. of that day,
at the Registrar's office. Judges will
be selected about two weeks after the
essays are handed in, and they will
then proceed to chose the four best
papers, writers of which will be given
the prize of $50 each. The Bonnheim
discussion is scheduled for February
at which time the four winners will
contest for a second prize of $">O, to be
given for the best presentation of
these essays.
The question for the Carnot Debate
has not yet yet been decided, but a
committee of faculty from California
and Stanford now has the matter un
der discussion. They hope to be able
to annnounce the general subject be
fore the end of the semester, when it
will be placed on the bulletin board
of the President's office.
