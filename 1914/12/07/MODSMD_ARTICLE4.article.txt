# Clinic's Dansant Scores Marked Success at Palace
## Palm Court Is Transformed Into Brilliant Scene by Record Band of Merrymakers. 
### 
Six hundred and thirty-five merry
makers thronged the halls of the Pal
ace Hotel Saturday evening—causing
the Stanford Clinic's Dansant to go on
record as the most brilliant and well
attended affair of its kind sincp the
dansants became the fashion in San
Francisco. All available space in the
Palm Court was taken up by the danc
ers, and the crowd overflowed into the
grill room and the pa,rlor.
The Pand may regard its appearance
at the Dansant as the climax of the
season, for the program was well
chosen and well played.
Several of the exhibition dances were
interposed in tlie regular program of
one-steps and hesitations —the most
popular selections being the Stanford
Maxixe and the Hesitation Tango.
11. 11. Maundrell, ex-'lO, who super
vised the Dansant, reported this after
noon that approximately $.'OO had been
cleared for the use of the Auxiliary.
Right hundred tickets at $1.50 were
sold and over 100 tables were occu
pied. Campus people were much in
evidence, and supported the members
of th > Alumni Association with great
enthusiasm.
