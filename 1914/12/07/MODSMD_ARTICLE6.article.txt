# CARDINAL SOCCER ELEVEN SUCCUMBS TO CELTIC CLUB
## Battle For Exposition League Title Is Won by City Players in Hard-Fought Contest, 2 to 1 HIGGINS AND BLODGET ARE STARS 
### 
In a hard-fought came on a muddy
field the Stanford soccer eleven went
down to a 2 to 1 defeat Saturday at
the hands of the Cel ic Club warriors.
This was the final n u.tch of the Stan
ford soccer season, and was the de
ciding game for the championship of
the Exposition Soccer League.
The contest proved to be one of the
prettiest exhibitions of the English
game this year, both teams display
ing fine form. The Stanford men
played a consistent game throughout,
equaling their performance of Thanks
giving Day, when they walked away
from the California eleven by a score
of 3 to 0.
The Celts hatf*easily the best team
they have put on the field this year,
players from the Sunday League fill
ing in the line-up until the eleven
which met Stanford Saturday had as
sumed the proportions of a thorough
ly all-star aggregation. The Stan
ford eleven, being unable to .recruit
material from outside sources, met
the Celtics with the same team that
they had played throughout the sea
son.
Stanford's first tally was registered
in the first few minutes of the opening
play by a clever bit of individual star
ring on the part of Captain Blodget.
The ball was sent down the field to the
Cardinal skipper at center forward. He
hooked it and dribbled toward the Cel
tic goal, when the opposing fullback
attempted to block. Blodget kicked
the sphere over the full's head and
then, again securing, sent it neatly in
to the net.
The sole scores during the re
mainder of the game were chalked up
on the Celtic side of the balance. The
city's club second tally was made but
ten minutes before the close of the
game, when the ball slipped past the
Cardinal goal-keeper in the gathering
darkness. The rest of the game saw
the ball continually in Celtic territory,
where the Stanford forwards bombard
ed the Celtic defense until the final
whistle.
The Cardinal line-up was the same
as for the last intercollegiate game,
with the exception that Vanderburg
again appeared at half in the position
that he held down at the first of the
season. During the second half his
anskle was injured, and h's place was
filled by S. Adams, who played at in
side left for Stanford in the first
match against California this year.
Blodget and Higgins starred for the
Cardinal in the forward line, both
playing a cool, dangerous brand of
soccer. Button and Adams, at. full,
gave the bleachers their usual exhi
bit'on of clover blocks and spectacular
saves. Ou the half-back line Boyl»
showed especially brilliant form.

the hands of the Cel ic Club warriors.
This was the final n u.tch of the Stan
ford soccer season, and was the de
ciding game for the championship of
the Exposition Soccer League.
The contest proved to be one of the
prettiest exhibitions of the English
game this year, both teams display
ing fine form. The Stanford men
played a consistent game throughout,
equaling their performance of Thanks
giving Day, when they walked away
from the California eleven by a score
of 3 to 0.
The Celts hatf*easily the best team
they have put on the field this year,
players from the Sunday League fill
ing in the line-up until the eleven
which met Stanford Saturday had as
sumed the proportions of a thorough
ly all-star aggregation. The Stan
ford eleven, being unable to .recruit
material from outside sources, met
the Celtics with the same team that
they had played throughout the sea
son.
Stanford's first tally was registered
in the first few minutes of the opening
play by a clever bit of individual star
ring on the part of Captain Blodget.
The ball was sent down the field to the
Cardinal skipper at center forward. He
hooked it and dribbled toward the Cel
tic goal, when the opposing fullback
attempted to block. Blodget kicked
the sphere over the full's head and
then, again securing, sent it neatly in
to the net.
The sole scores during the re
mainder of the game were chalked up
on the Celtic side of the balance. The
city's club second tally was made but
ten minutes before the close of the
game, when the ball slipped past the
Cardinal goal-keeper in the gathering
darkness. The rest of the game saw
the ball continually in Celtic territory,
where the Stanford forwards bombard
ed the Celtic defense until the final
whistle.
The Cardinal line-up was the same
as for the last intercollegiate game,
with the exception that Vanderburg
again appeared at half in the position
that he held down at the first of the
season. During the second half his
anskle was injured, and h's place was
filled by S. Adams, who played at in
side left for Stanford in the first
match against California this year.
Blodget and Higgins starred for the
Cardinal in the forward line, both
playing a cool, dangerous brand of
soccer. Button and Adams, at. full,
gave the bleachers their usual exhi
bit'on of clover blocks and spectacular
saves. Ou the half-back line Boyl»
showed especially brilliant form.
