# CALIFORNIA TO DISCUSS FOOTBALL QUESTIONS
## Student Sentiment Strongly in Favor of Freshman Contestâ€”Old Game Problem Comes Up. 
### 
Football problems will be discussed
by the students of the University of
California at a mass meeting posted
for the hour between 11 and 12 to
morrow morning. Various phases of
the intercollegiate agreement will be
presented from the floor. The result
of the straw vote will be to give the
California agreement committee a
sounding of general student senti
ment when the new intercollegiate
regulations are drafted next month.
The three question which will re
ceive most attention are: Renewal of
the Stanford-California Freshman rug
by game; the barring of Freshmen
from the Varsity, and return to Amer
ican football.
There is little doubt that student
feeling at Berkeley is as strong in
favor of the annual first-year match
as at Stanford. Probably the same
amount of faculty restraint would not
be felt there.
Despite the use of Freshmen in the
last intercollegiate Varsity game, stu
dent opposition to the use of first-year
students in the Big Game is marked.
The re-installment of the clash be
tween the baby teams appears to be
looked to as a good substitute means
of encouraging Freshman ruggers.
The mooted warning that California
will return to the "old game" next
season appears to be a weak-kneed,
bugbear. Graduate Manager Stroud
will use all his influence to retain
rugby, and will be backetF'by other
leaders on the rival campus.
