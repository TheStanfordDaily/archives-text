## CONSTITUTION OFFERED Providing For Board of Managers in Control FATE OF NEW CODE DEPENDS ON ITS ACCEPTANCE BY TRUSTEES OF BUILDING. 
### 
The constitution of the Stanford
Union has been drawn up. The special
committee on constitutional questions
submitted by mail today to the Hoard
of Trustees of the Union the result of
their work. The committee is com
posed of Dr. R. L. Wilbur, '96, chair
man; A. W. Ambrose, '13, E. C. Beh
rens, '14, W. S. Burns, '14, S. S. Simon
son, '15, and Everett W. Smith, '99.
The special committee has taken
great care with the preparation of this
code, and it is thought that the Board
of Trustees will approve of their ef
forts. It is necessary to have the
board's appproval before the constitu
tion can become valid.
The feature of main interest in the
tentative constitution is the provision
for a Board of Managers.
This board will be representative of
the membership of the Unionâ€”under
graduates, alumni, and faculty, with
the undergraduate membership having
the largest representation. This board
will have control of the actual run
ning of the building, and will be in
full charge and entirely responsible
for the conduct of the Union, outside
of the matter of organization.
A plan has been suggested for util
izing the Bookstore's profit-sharing ar
rangement for the benefit of the Stan
ford Union. The plan, which originat
ed with H. A. Fore, '13, now a gradu
ate student in the University, is that
those members of the Union who care
to do so shall deposit their rebate
slips to the credit of the Union, and
at the end of the year have the Book
store turn over the profits to the
Union, rather than to the individual
members. It is felt that a good many
men who do not now take advantage of
the profit-sharing opportunty which
the Bookstore offers, would be glad to
contribute in this way to the Union,
without any loss to themselves, and
that the total might amount to a very
respectable sum.
The only likelihood of serious objec
tion to the plan that has so far been
called to the attention of the officers of
the Union lies in the possibility that
some members of the Union would
really desire to obtain the rebate mon
ey from the Bookstore for their own
personal use, and might fpel under obli
gation to deposit their checks to the
benefit of the Union. The officers of
the Union themselves would be the
first to oppose the plan if they felt,
that this was likely to occur.
It has been suggested that any sum
gained by this method might very prop
erly be used in maintaining the read
ing and writing room in the Union
building.
