## Appointed Head of Agricultural Information Bureau at Cornell. 
### 
Bristow Adams, '00, of the Forest
Service of the United States Depart
ment of Agriculture, has recently been
appointed head of the new agricultur
al information bureau at Cornell. Ar
rangements have been made for him
to assume his duties about the middle
of December.
While in Stanford Adams was well
known in journalistic work, having
edited the first volume of the Chap
arral. For a number of years after
leaving Stanford he was engaged in
newspaper work on the Pacific coast.
Adams' talents are by no means lim
ited to literary lines; he is as well a
highly trained illustrator and artist.
During his newspaper work he was
secured by Chancellor David Starr
Jordan to aid him in the investigation
of the Alaskan Seal Fisheries. Adams
was Dr. Jordan's assistant, doing most
of the illustrating for the publications
covering the work. A few years ago
he became associated with Gifford
Pinchot in connection with the Forest
Service in Washington, and since that
time has served in various capacities
in that service.
