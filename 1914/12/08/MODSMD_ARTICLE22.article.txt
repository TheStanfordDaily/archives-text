# Some Intercollegiate Questions
## 
### 
Questions of moment in our inter
collegiate athletic relations have
sprung up over night, with California
heading a formidable list of proposals
which will be given final decision by
the Intercollegiate Agreement Commit
tee the last of January. The import
ance of these questions make their
early consideration advisable to all
students in the University.
The bugbear of a possible reversion
to the American type of football at the
o+otr, TTnivfvsitv is dead—'Going back
! • . ' has been the cant
u li «• le athletics for the
<>'■ "ugby growth, and it
lias lately met with favor in the news
making rooms of our metropolitan
dailies. It has been definitely known
at Stanford that there was not the re
motest possibility of such action 011 the
part of the Cardinal —even should the
students favor the American game,
which, it can lie safely stated, they do
not—and the action of the Associated
Students at California today in ignor
ing that question would seem positive
proof of their satisfaction with rugby
as the greatest intercollegiate sport.
However, there are minor details
which have come up for a satisfactory
adjustment, and it is in the four points
referred to the Intercollegiate Agree
ment Committee by the California Stu
dent Body, that we are interested.
The Daily Palo Alto is heartily in ac
cord with the proposal for the re
sumption of the freshman intercolle
giate rugby game, and it would seem
that the consensus of opinion on the
campus would favor such a clause in
the new agreement. The straw vote in
tomorrow's election will prove an in
dex to Stanford's opinion on that sub
ject. If an arrangement can be made
for the inclusion of a Second Varsity
game as a post-season attraction, ro
much the better. Intercollegiate com
petition would then be the reward of
many a man on the rugby squad, and
the sport would benefit as well through
the education of the general public in
rugby football lore. The spo.rt will gain
only as the knowledge of its points be
comes more of an inherent 'rugby
sense?' in Young America —competition
is the best stimulus.
The same feeling should prevail in
regard to the question of a Second
Varsity crew race, which is the sug
gestion of the Blue and Gold clan.
Twenty-seven men in Cardinal shells
would prove a boost for the rowing
sport that is sorely needed. Oakland
and the Estuary will prove a second

Poughlceepsie and the Hudson, if the
plan meets with approval.

An analysis of the Registrar's rec
ords for the past nine years of rugby
competition shows that fourteen Fresh
men have made their Varsity "S" in
their first year. Of these not one has
"flunked out" at the end of the semes
ter, and but one has been placed 011
probation at the end of the football
half-year. One player left college af
ter a years' time with a clear scholas
tic record. Two others have a year
and a half to their credit, while a fifth
has two years. The remaining nine
ruggers have either completed their
full course of studies or are at pres
ent in good scholastic standing.
Such a record is a conclusive argu
ment against the truth of the oft-heard
statement that the trials of a Varsity
season are too much for the average
freshman. Fourteen men in nine years
—a small proportion of the total num
ber of players to legislate against—
and thei.r record does not seem to bear
out the theory that young athletes
make poor scholars.
For the last four years a faculty .rul
ing has barred the Freshman fifteen
from competing as a unit with Cali
fornia's baby team, such action being
based on the plea that too much com
petition leads to poor scholarship. A
study of the facts and figures would
now seem to refute that argument, and
with the rescinding of the ruling as a
possibility, the Freshman game looms
011 the horizon of the future. In track
and baseball first-year competition
would not be wo.rth the candle, but in
football and crew the interest is such
as to warrant the meeting.

Consideration of scholastic records
and the statistics of first-year play
ers 011 varsity teams makes the inclu
sion of the Freshmen elimination rule
and the six-months rule proposed by
California unnecessary and inadvisable
in intercollegiate relations—strict pro
bation at Stanford is the Damoclean
sword that steadies a young athlete
when the faculty may snip the thread,
and the vague chance at which the
one-term clause is aimed does not war
rant the act.
