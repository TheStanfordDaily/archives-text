# What Shall I Read Tonight?
## 
### 
The following poem by Lucia Mir
rielees, '10, appeared in the Sequoia
for May, 190fi. The call of the woods
voiced in these lines comes as a wel
come note in these days when every
student is longing to fling his books
into the corner and answer the call of
vacation:
What shall I read tonight,
As I scan by bookcase o'er,
A sonnet, a lay, or a rondeau light,
Or a bit. of old-folk lore?
Blackstone is up on the shelf
Consorting with Huffcut lean,
But neither of them is precisely the
help
That a listless fancy would glean.
Across from the fireplace there
Half hid in the changing light.
Are Ibsen, and Shaw, and the great
Molier
But can they hold my fancy tonight?
Back to the pine-wood forest,
There's where it carries me,
With only the drip of the oozing sap,
And the needles that under my foot
fall snap
O.r the wood-pecker's quick monoton
ous tap
On some once lonely tree.
Then what shall T read tonight?
I turn from my bookish lore,
From sonnet, from lay, from rondeau
light,
To dream of the woods once more.
