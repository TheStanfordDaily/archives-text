Out of respect to the "500" of Stan
ford, and the men of the English De
partment, who pride themselves on be
ing gentlemen in the presence of la
dies. I rise to a point of decency. I
think it is about time that the civilized
half of the University will take some
action towards exterminating the
campus pest—the so-called Stanford
Rough—whose sole ambition, it seems,
is to block the progress of all social
and educational ideals of the communi
ty.
Now for the campaign! Out with
the firehose and the scrubbing brush
es! Out with the lye cans, and the
books on manners! Down with the
rough! Down with him!
