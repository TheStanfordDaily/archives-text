## Of Dr. Branner Secured as Valuable Addition to University Library. 
### 
One of the largest additions ever
made to the Stanford Library was ac
quired recently when the University
arranged to take over the collection
of geology and mining works that have
been gathered by President Bxanner.
The new library represents thirty
years of collecting by Dr. Branner,
and is considered the most complete
collection of geology books in the west.
For the last quarter of a century the
library has been supported by Dr.
Branne.r, though it has been used by
University students and many scien
t'sts on the Pacific coast. In the early
days of the University, few funds were
provided for books and periodicals, and
sets of the findings of various scien
tific societies and numerous papers,
bulletins, and published essays were
collected by Dr. Branner person
ally.. At the present time the
University is taking the collection
of twenty thousand books, pam
phlets. and maps at the cost they
were to the collector. Many of the
books have become .rare since they
were originally secured, and are worth
much more than the price the Univer
sity will pay for them.
The valuation was made under the
direction of Librarian G. T. Clark.
The volumes include works on geolo
gy, geography, travel, minerology, min
ing, petrogrophy, and metallurgy.
Books on metallurgy were taken over
and files maintained by the University
five years ago.
The great value of the collection lies
in its completeness, especially of the
files of magazines, state reports, and
geological observations. Some of the
books are so rare that they are dupli
cated only in national museums, and
are prices as curios, as well as scien
tific works.
