# TRACK PROSPECT GIVES ADVANTAGE TO RIVALS
## Balance of Power Is Claimed For Blue and Gold Freshman Stars Who Will Oppose Stanford's Victorious Team in Next Meet SIX RECORD-HOLDERS BACK Campbell, Bonnett, and Maloney Unite in Urging That All Likely Candidates Turn Out Next Semester to Support Formidable Nucleus of Varsity Men. 
### 
It is impossible, of course, to pre
dict the outcome of next year's track
meet with California. A hasty sur
vey of material in sight at the pres
ent time indicates a hard struggle for
the Stanford menâ€”a struggle against
the slight advantage which the
Blue and Gold possesses in the
registration this semester of a num
ber of Freshman stars. Such a
situation, which gives Stanford a
chance, at least, should encourage all
who can to sign up in the spring.
Captain E. M. Bonnett, '15, Coach E.
P. Campbell, '13, and Trainer Harry
Maloney pledge their ability to ac
commodate as many athletes as pos
sible who intend to stay in training
during the entire season. A nucleus
of varsity stars is a firm foundation;
the superstructure of point-winning
seconds and thirds must be built out of
new men who are willing to work hard
during the entire three months.
The Varsity men who have returned
for another season of active competi
tion are Captain E. M. Bonnett, *15, O.
G. Lachmund, '17, R. R. Templeton,
*15, It. Krohn, '10, W. F. Sisson, '17,
G. H. Bihlman, '17, V. L. King, '16, G.
W. Bedeau, '15, F. S. Murray, *16, J.
K. Norton, '10, R. H. Grant, '17, J. D.
Chace, '16, H. B. Wolcott, '14, and P.
R. Wilson, '16. Six of these thirteen
men are intercollegiate record-hold
ers: Captain Bonnett, 880-yard dash,
1:54 3-5; Krohn. pole vault, 12 feet
inches; F. Murray, low hurdles,
: 24 4-5 seconds, and intercollegiate re
lay record; Wilson, mile run, 4:20 1-5,
and Chace and Wolcott, members of
record relay team. Should all of these
stars be able to compete, an assurance
of a fighting chance may be held out
to the Stanford fans.
The absence of E. P. Campbell, '13,
and P. I?. McKee, '14, from the list of
sprinters should give Captain Stanton
of California a good opportunity to
prove the wonderful reputation as
signed him. The outcome of the meet
will depend to a large extent on the
result of the sprints, and Stanford s
lanes will be filled by R. H. Grant, '17,
C. R. Niklason. '17, L C. Johnson, '18,
1?. F. Davis, '18, P. E. Brown, '18, M.
Levi, '18. W. Lynn. '17. W. .T. Losh, '17.
R. E. Needham, '16, and M. M. Kirksey,
'18.
In comparison with California's
prospect, the Cardinal is strongest in
the hurdles, shot-put, pole vault, mile,
and half-mile; fair in the hammer
throw, broad jump, high jump, and
quarter mile; weak in the two-mile;
and dubious in the sprints. The
strength of C. W. Bedeau, '15, (J. H.
Bililman, '17, and F. S. Murray, '16, in
the shot, will be greatly augmented at
the beginning of next semester with
the registration of Reg Caughey, of
Ukiah, holder of the Stanford inter
scholastic record in the shot-put, and
member of the United States team
which visited Australia last season.
President Elliott, of the Pacific
Coast Branch of the A. A. IT., bails
Feg Murray as the premier hurdler of
the world today, predicting for him a
victory over Fred Kelly, and a great
future at the next Olympic games.
Elliott also regards Skin Wilson as a
long-distance runner of great promi
ise, ranking him beside Jim Powers
and Abel Kiviat, and declaring him to
be the most consistent miler in the
track world of today.
But the most sanguine dope sheet
gives Stanford a victory by but a few
points, and it is evident that success
may only come from the united efforts
of the entire squad. The new Fresh
men who show ability from previous
records are Dykes, Earl, Greve, Davis,
Brown, Levi, Coleman, McCloskey,
Hertel, Wilson, Duncan, C. Johnson,
Kirksey, and Templeton.
