						Central Business Office

A plan for the establishment of a
central business office for student or
ganizations lias been advanced as a
substitute for the system of individual
accounting now in vogue, the change to
be made this Spring on the comple
tion of the Stanford Union. The first
steps toward the maximum of efficien
cy that lies in centralizing the efforts
that are essentially parallel, were
taken this semester when a number of
the organizations adapted a uniform
system of bookkeeping under the su
pervision of the Graduate Manager.
The plan in its entirety is much more
extensive, involving the establishment
of a central office, where all bookkeep
ing of student organizations is to be
done by an expert accountant. The
bodies affected would include the Asso
ciated Students, the Students' Guild,
The Daily Palo Alto, The Board of
Control, the Quad, the Stanford Union
(which, with its large membership,
will prove a hard problem in accurate
accounting,) the Women's Clubhouse,
and other organizations now support
ing individual bookkeeping sets.
An expert accountant has estimated
the present cost of clerical work, office
work and supplies, printing, bookkeep
ing and stenography at seven hundred
dollars a month. In his opinion a well
organized office could do the same
work more quickly, accurately and ef
ficiently for half the money. A second
gain would be in the better under
standing of financial matters which
would lie afforded the students by the
complete and detailed reports made
at regular intervals.
In submitting their accounts to this
central office for filing, the organiza
tions would lose nothing of their indi
viduality, or the full and complete
control of their funds. The books
would be kept for them, receipts re
corded, monthly statements rendered,
and annual audits furnished by a cer
tified accountant. The motif of the
central office would be to help, not
to control.
The proposed system would exert a
healthful influence on all the campus
organizations affected and would be
a great step toward the goal of all
large bodies, maximum efficiency.
