# The 						Merit System
## 
### 
The present system of promotion on
The Daily Palo Alto staff might be
happily styled the 'merit' system, and
is not paralleled so far as can he de
termined in any other organization of
the campus. The position of the name

of the newsw.riter is the one index to
his rank 011 the staff, and this is de
termined by the editor in office. He is
the one man best qualified to judge the
abilities and the enthusiasm for hard
work in the members of the staff, and
it is for the best interests of the paper
that his word be final.
That favoritism is an unknown quan
tity in"Daily" circles is attested to
by any reporter—in the three years of
work that fill the gap between fresh
man and senior semesters, six and
ometimes seven editors wield the pow
er of appointment and promotion—it is
an inexorable law that the best will
reach the top. Appointments to the
editorships 011 the recommendation of
the editor-in-chief for the preceding
semester would be a fairer method of
choosing the head than the present
scheme of popular vote.
