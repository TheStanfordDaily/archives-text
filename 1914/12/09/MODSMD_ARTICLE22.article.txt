Land ahead! And all that remains to
slip this good ship "Ambition" into
her vacation berth is the final tussle
with the tides and currents of crass
financial problems and the inadequa
cies of the composing room—and the
tugs that puff their willing help are
the well-tried associates on a hard
working staff. There is no fear of a
poor landing.
The four months journey on vaguely
charted seas has been guided by the
principle that the ideal newspaper is a
,nuasi-public utility—at its best it should
unify the interest of the community,
and should be the composite of fac
tors necessary for information, in
struction, and entertainment. To ap
proach this goal, the first steps taken
was to leap the self-imposed barriers
of hidebound convention, the practices
of years in campus journalism, and
strike for the newer and bigger things
in modern newspaperdom—the appeal
to the interest of the general public.
We have sought earnestly for that rare
combination of popularity, authority
and technical excellence that places
the moulder in the Profession of Jour
! nalisni —there will be joy for those to
follow in the striving.
Our editorial policy has been one
directed to make the reader think for
himself on the vital subjects of the
day, suggestive rather than arbitrary.
We would say that we had "great hope
of disturbing the public peace in vari
ous directions," since good is always
done in awakening discussion —yet the
opportunity seems left for another's
pen.
The semester has been one of great
progress, in broad and general lines, as
well as in the smaller things that
make smoother the course of campus
life. Stanford Spirit, smoldering in
the first weeks, burst into l'lame in the
long weeks before the Game, and the
air has tingled with its charge of life
and vim—a spirit that is more than
bleacher hysteria and is not measured
in college honors and outward show.
At the half-way landing, we see blue
skies and smiling seas ahead—may the
rising barometer of the public's good
will not prove a false prophet for the
Skipper to follow!
