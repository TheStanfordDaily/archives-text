"The Four-Leafed Clover" is the
title of a volume of Stanford poems
written by Charles K. Field. 95, and
dedicated to those
"Who once within a cloistered place
Were college mates of mine,
In clover there for four sweet years
That bore the stamp divine."
The following verses are from that
collection:
Oh, the .rain!
The buttercups overflow,
And out 011 the hill again
The yellow violets grow.
Oh, the .rain!
And the loving mud to pass!
The 'bus waits long for the train,
And the prof is late to his class.
Oh, the rain!
When the bamboo bends to the rim,
And a girl and a hurricane
Are waging a battle grim.
Oh, the rain!
At the last sweet bell defied,
With one umbrella for twain,
And a sidewalk two planks wide.
