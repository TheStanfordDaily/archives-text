# HARVARD TEAM IS WORTHY OF ALL-AMERICAN HONORS
## 
### Hal Sheridan 
New York, Dec. 9.â€”We've been
asked why we haven't picked an All-
American football team. We pick k
now. It's Harvard. That Crimson
eleven of 1914 was such a marvelous
thing, so perfect in every detail, so
invulnerable on defense, and so crusli
ingly powerful on offense, when all
the regulars were in, that it couldn't
be bettered by the addition even of a
Maulbetseh or a LeGore, or anyone
you might name. There undoubtedly
are several men who played this year
who were better as individuals than
some of the Harvard regulars, but the
best would not have fitted in as an
efficient working part of the Crimson
car as well as did the men who com
prised Haughton's Hurricane.
On the other hand, if requested to
name an all-star eleven, it is doubt
ful if more than five or six Harvard
names would appear on it. We'd say
Mahan, Hardwick, Fennock, Logan, and
Brickley should be among those pres
ent.
