While (lie lliivin' Is Good.
" 'Lo, Bill, you're lookin' doleful,
What's heavy on your mind?
You oughter be celebratin',
Bein' thru with this daily grind.
Ain't you graduatin' with honors,
An' a Phi Betta Kappy key;
You ain't near as happy
As it seems you oughter be.'
"Pete, I'm a fizzle,
I've had but a single thought:
A's an' IVs an' high degrees—
For no more have I fought.
They look all .right on paper,
But I'll find when I have gone,
That A's an' IVs and golden keys
Won't buy me even a song.
"Pete,' if you reckon your studies
As the whole big bloomin' show,
Four years of college life
'LI seem a helluva way to go.
I'm almost a dead one now.
An' I know that I was wrong,—
Have a good time while the bavin' is
good.
That's all; s'long.'
