# OLD TIMERS
## HOLD PRESENT DAY STANFORD IS DEGENERATING IN AQUATICS AND CHIVALRY. 
### 
Stanford students of the present
regime are not in it with the "old
bunch," in either aquatics or chival
ry, say "Old Grads," who have visited
the campus during the last few days.
Now, these old scouts were great at
"treading water," even if they didn't
want to sink, or couldn't swim. They
used to wait for it to rain so that they
could stand near the P. O. and spread
out their "duds a la Sir Walter
Raleigh" to let the ladies pass over
puddles on Lasuen, as rumor has it.
Recently, some of the "old guard"
came back to give the college the
"once over," and see if the Stanford
ites of today were still continuing this
gallant custom. Fortunately, it rained,
but were any coats spread over pud
dles?
The "Old Grads" we.re disgusted.
"What's coming to this campus, if
they keep on improving the way they
have this last year?" one of them
asked. "First thing we'll know they'll
have a line of ferryboats from Encina
to the D. P. A. office. We won't know
this place before long."
