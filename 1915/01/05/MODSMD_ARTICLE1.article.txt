# DIAMOND PROSPECTS BRIGHT WITH EIGHT VETERANS ON DECK
## Captain Tom Workman Is Assured of a Successful Season With Long Game Schedule and Better Playing Facilities ORR WILL COACH VARSITY 
### 
With an array of eight veterans, a
number of substitutes, and a host of
untried material on deck prepared to
inaugurate the 1915 baseball season,
Captain Tom Workman may now rest
assured of at least an even break to
ward capturing the laurels in the an
nual Stanford-California diamond bat
tle. The unexpected return to the
University of A. L. Howe, '15, who
held the Blue and Gold batsmen down
to a few well scattered hits in the
1911 Intercollegiate, will do much to
offset the loss of such sterling play
ers as Terry, Maple, Halm, and Dool
ing.
Following the rally at Encina Hall
tomorrow evening, at which all pros
pective candidates will sign up, the
initial practice of the season will be
held Friday afternoon. Saturday will
be the opening athletic event of the
new year, when the Varsity is sched
uled to oppose the Olympic Club nine,
providing fair weather is granted.
All baseball prognostications point
to a most successful season under the

able leader
ship of Cap
tain "Work
man, who for
the past two
years has
held down
the first sta
tion in a pro
fessional man
ner. Billy
Orr, a for
mer member
of the World
Champ i on
Philadelph i a
Athletics, and
now sho r t
stop for the
salt Lake club
of the Pa
cific Coast

League, has been secured by Graduate
Manager R. W. Wilcox to act as
coach. Orr will make the trip every
afternoon to the campus to direct the
work of the Varsity. Two other facts
which predict a formidabl nine is
the long season of twenty-nine games,
and the increased facilties for prac
tice. Roth the Faculty and Auxiliary
Fields have been refaced and putin
perfect shape, while the Varsity dia
mond, with its new turf outfield and
sunken pits, is in excellent condition.
There remain but two positions on
the team which are unclaimed by
veterans. Last year's infield is in
tact, with the exception of the star
shortstop, Zeb Terry, who for four
years occupied that position on the
Stanford Varsity. Stevens, substitute
infielder last spring should make a
strong bid for the berth. Dent will
