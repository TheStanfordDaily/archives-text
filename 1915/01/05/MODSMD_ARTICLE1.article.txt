# DIAMOND PROSPECTS BRIGHT WITH EIGHT VETERANS ON DECK
## Captain Tom Workman Is Assured of a Successful Season With Long Game Schedule and Better Playing Facilities ORR WILL COACH VARSITY 
### 
With an array of eight veterans, a
number of substitutes, and a host of
untried material on deck prepared to
inaugurate the 1915 baseball season,
Captain Tom Workman may now rest
assured of at least an even break to
ward capturing the laurels in the an
nual Stanford-California diamond bat
tle. The unexpected return to the
University of A. L. Howe, '15, who
held the Blue and Gold batsmen down
to a few well scattered hits in the
1911 Intercollegiate, will do much to
offset the loss of such sterling play
ers as Terry, Maple, Halm, and Dool
ing.
Following the rally at Encina Hall
tomorrow evening, at which all pros
pective candidates will sign up, the
initial practice of the season will be
held Friday afternoon. Saturday will
be the opening athletic event of the
new year, when the Varsity is sched
uled to oppose the Olympic Club nine,
providing fair weather is granted.

to be a number of strong possibilities
among the Peanut Leaguers and the

among the Peanut Leaguers and the
first-year class.
With an array of eight veterans, a
number of substitutes, and a host of
untried material on deck prepared to
inaugurate the 1915 baseball season,
Captain Tom Workman may now rest
assured of at least an even break to
ward capturing the laurels in the an
nual Stanford-California diamond bat
tle. The unexpected return to the
University of A. L. Howe, '15, who
held the Blue and Gold batsmen down
to a few well scattered hits in the
1911 Intercollegiate, will do much to
offset the loss of such sterling play
ers as Terry, Maple, Halm, and Dool
ing.
Following the rally at Encina Hall
tomorrow evening, at which all pros
pective candidates will sign up, the
initial practice of the season will be
held Friday afternoon. Saturday will
be the opening athletic event of the
new year, when the Varsity is sched
uled to oppose the Olympic Club nine,
providing fair weather is granted.
All baseball prognostications point
to a most successful season under the

able leader

the past two
years has

sunken pits, is in excellent condition.
There remain but two positions on
the team which are unclaimed by
veterans. Last year's infield is in
tact, with the exception of the star
shortstop, Zeb Terry, who for four
years occupied that position on the
Stanford Varsity. Stevens, substitute
infielder last spring should make a
strong bid for the berth. Dent will

There are a number of likely look
ing twirlers. the veterans, Hayes and
Howe, however, having a good mar
gin on all other candidates. Mattie
and Hoover, with the proper amount
of training should develop into excel
lent slabsmen. Skipper Workman is
a certainty at first base, while Mc-
Closkey and Stafford, at second and
third, will once more compete for
places in the infield.
Noonan and Day will again try for
positions in the outfield, leaving one
vacancy to be filled. Either Landers
or O'Neil, substitute infielders, may
be candidates for a place in the outer
garden. In addition to last year's vet
erans and substitutes, there are sure
to be a number of strong possibilities
among the Peanut Leaguers and the
first-year class.
