# Phone Call, picnic Romance, Wedding Bells, Mrs. farrar
## 
### 
Bells in the old
Park Congrega
tional church, in
Los Angeles, were
disturbed fro m
their silence last
Saturday evening
to toll the glad
tidings of the cer
emony whi c h
brought to a cli
max the romance
of pretty Lorene x ,
Durham, of Cor- o
ona, and Irwin E.

Farrar, '15, business manager of The
Daily Palo Alto.
The acquaintance of the couple also
began with bells â€”this time by the
ringing of a telephone call, with cen
tral acting as Cupid. Farrar was in
troduced to Miss Durham over the
'phone by a mutual friend of both,
Fred L. Foster, '13, former Daily Palo
Alto manager.
Farrar was struck by Miss Durham's
voice, but was more favorably im
pressed a few days later when he met
her at a picnic in Corona. The friend
ship of the couple grew into a devoted
attachment, and five months ago their
engagement was announced.
Saturday Farrar found it impos
sible to leave his betrothed in Corona
to return to Stanford, and the two
slipped quietly to Los Angeles, where
they were married by Rev. Chester
Ferris. They have taken apartments
at 845 Bryant street, Palo Alto, and
will live there while Farrar completes
his law course at Stanford.
Speaking of married life yesterday,
Farrar said: "It's great." His senti
ment was echoed by his wife.
When asked by a representative of
the Daily Palo Alto for he.r advice to
the lovelorn, Mrs. Farrar said: "Try it,
and see."
When pressed further to state her
experiences as a wife, Mrs. Far.rar con
tinued: "One ought to consider mar
riage well. It's a very serious matter.
Any serious young woman would have
done what I did, though, considering
the man. It all depends on the man.
"The wife ought to take full charge
of the funds. I haven't had a chance
to do that yet.
"Do everything your husband's
friends advise you. I would never get
through, though, if I did.
'The wife ought to leave politics to
her husband. Irwin ought to have
voted for Fredericks, though, instead
of Johnson.
"Surely, the wife's sphere is the
home, but she shouldn't stay there too
much.
"Anything that Irwin says or docs
! s all right. I'll back him up."
Mrs. Farrar attended the Corona
High School, and is a graduate of Riv
erside Business College. She is 21
years of age.
Farrar is also 21 years old and is a
member of Phi Alpha Delta legal fra
ternity. and Encina Club. He was
awarded his circle "S" in Basketball
last year.
