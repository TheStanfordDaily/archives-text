United Press Telegraphic Report
BERLIN, Jan. 6.—Experts believe that
the strategy of General von Hinden
burg, in taking Borjinow, opens the
way to driving a wedge into the Rus
sian center and compelling the Slavs
to retire on their second line of de
fenses, or, failing to retreat, to face a
flank attack. German regulars are
reinforcing the Austrians at Cracow,
in western Galicia.
Hitter Fighting in France Unavailing.
PARIS, Jan. 6.—The allies .report
success in the Argonne region west
of the Meuse. German attacks at sev
eral points near Vicquoy Courtec-
House were repulsed. In spite of the
torrential rains, the Germans twice
attempted to retake positions at St.
Georges, near the Meuse, but were
hotly repulsed. Between the Lys, on
the Belgian border, and the Oise, the
cente.r of the great battle line, there
have been only artillery duels. Be
tween the Aisne and Rheims, ten miles
to the south, the German artillery was
silenced by heavy French guns. The
Teutons' were driver, a hundred yards
to the northwest of Rheims. The
fighting in the Argonne has bee vio
lent. Here the allies took 300 yards
of trenches. Two German attacks at
Bagatelle Fontaine were repulsed.
Eight hundred yards of Ge,rman
trenches at Contre-House were dyna
mited and the French captured half
of them. The weather at all points is
bad.
Invasion of Hungary Progressing.
PETROGRAD, Jan. 6.—The Russian
advance into Hungary is practically
unopposed. However, the Carpathians
are snow-bound and it is most diffi
cult to bring up supplies.
