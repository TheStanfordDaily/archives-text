# WHY?
## 
### 
Many new students have registered
in the University this semester. In an
attempt to arrange their schedules
they have found it almost impossible
to select courses which they need or
desire. The .reason for this is the fact
that most of the subjects are continued
from the first to the second semester,
or those given only during the second
term require prerequisites in order to
enter.
Unfortunately the men and the wo
men who come here ror the first time
are not able to profit to the greatest
extent in preparing themselves for
their profession because they are not
able to take subjects which are of
the greatest direct value to them.
Why is the curricula inadequate to
meet the demands of the students?
