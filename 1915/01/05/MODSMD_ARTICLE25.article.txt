Stanford University, 1-5-15.
j Dearest Mother: I'm a college man
at last. I bought my 1918 fob as soon
ias the tyain got in. The stores in Palo
Alto surely know how to treat a cus
tomer. It was kind of cold, and I
thought you would worry about my
! health, so I bought a new overcoat
with the fob, and a .vain-proof hat.
i The store where I bought them sets
i the styles for this region, i registered
this morning, and severely strained
my bank account. The Registrar was
! very glad to see me, and as we shook
hands T felt that we would always be
friends while I was in college. One
of the registrars was a girl, and she,
too, was pleased to see me. I hate to
brag, but she became interested in me
from the start, because I had no soon
er told her my name when she asked
me for my room card. She even told
me where to go for it—quite a hike,
but I assure you it was worth it. When
I handed it to her I was about to say,
"Can't we exchange cards?" when a
fellow who looked like an assistant
professor asked me for two dollars.
I said, "What for?" He answered back
for your gild fee." I remembered your
sewing gild, so told him I was not a
member, but my mothe.r was. He
laughed, and said it was not that kind
of a gild. The fellow in back of me
says, "Brush up your English his
tory." So I asked the assistant if it
was an industrial or social gild, and
before he could answer the fellow
back of me shoves me, and when T
looked up my two dollars were gone.
I have heard a rumor that the gild is
a society for students who are sick of
college—a sort of hospital with co-ed
nurses and good meals. Hut T rather
doubt it. Don't you, mother? But
I'll take a chance. Think of the pov
erty-stricken Belgians, and your own
SONNY.
S. P. I was asked to take three
college papers. Not bad for the first
day.
