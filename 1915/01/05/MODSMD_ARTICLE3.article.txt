# REGISTRATION
## This Semester May Fall Short of Last Term's Figures More Than One Hundred. 
### 
Sixteen hundred and eighty-seven
students have entered Stanford for
the present semester, according to
figures given out this afternoon by As
sistant Registrar McDowell. This is
130 more than the registration at this
time last year.
Seventy-six new students have reg
istered, 26 of whom are women. Last
year 73 new students entered in Jan
uary.
About fifty of the registered stu
dents will not be on the campus, be
ing in attendance at the San Francisco
medical clinic. More students will
enter during the week, but McDowell
believes the registration this semes
ter will fall short of last term's by
more than one hundred.
