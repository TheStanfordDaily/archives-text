# ROAD IMPROVEMENTS HAVE PROGRESSED DURING RECESS
## 
### 
Improvements on the road that was
formerly used exclusively by automo
biles are being made as rapidly as
the weather will permit. The old mud
foundation is being replaced by one
of crushed stone, under the direction
of Superintendent J. E. Hewston. The
fences have been removed on both
sides of the road, allowing a clear
vista on either hand through the ar
boretum.
The way in which traffic will be di
vided will be announced as soon as
the .road work is completed.
The beautification of the campus by
means of planting trees in the smaller
courts and in the rear of the build
ings is progressing rapidly.
