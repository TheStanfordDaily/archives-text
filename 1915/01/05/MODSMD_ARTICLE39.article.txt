# MIDYEAR REGISTRATION ADDS TO STRENGTH OF CARDINAL TRACK SQUAD
## 
### 
With the registration of Reginald
Caughey, of Ukiah, and F. Chapman,
of Santa Rosa, Stanford's chances for
success in track this coming spring
are brought up another notch.
Reg Caughey achieved fame with
the weights in his preparatory school
and holds the Stanford Interscholastic
twelve-pound shotput record of ">0
feet. At the same meet in which he
registered this mark he also put the
sixteen-pound shot over 44 feet in
trying for the world's interscholastic
record. Caughey was a member of
the American team which toured the
Antipodes last spring and made sev
eral records in Australia and New
Zealand.
The addition of Chapman, Santa
Rosa's star miler, to the ranks of
Stanford students materially strength
ens the long-distance squad. He per
forms the distance in less than 4 min
utes, 30 seconds, and should prove a
good running mate for "Skin"' Wilson,
Two freshmen, C. Johnson and M.
M. Kirksey, are hailed as sprinters
that will make an account of them
selves in the Dig Meet, and along with
R. Grant, It. Needham, and Nikalson,
complete a formidable quintet of dash
men. Wright Lynn will be able to
run, and will compete in the 440-yard
dash, besides trying the sprints.
Of the old men, Chace, Wolcott,

Stammer, and Edwards look best in
the quarter-mile; Bonnett, Boomer
shire, and Irwin in the half; Wilson
and Auppperle in the mile; Murray,
Norton, Templeton, and Halstead in
the hurdles.
In the field, Stanford has a strong
coterie in the shotput. Besides Caugh
ey are Murray, Bedeau, and Bihlman.
Drake and King have both set up good
records in the hammer throw. Sisson
and Dingley are slated for the broad
jump. In the high jump, Templeton is
the only "S" man of promise. With him
will appear West and H. Lachmund.
The pole vault should result in a ma
jority of points for the Cardinal with
Krohn, Macomber, and possibly Tufts
on the runway.
The relay is always an unknown
quantity. Murray, Lynn, Wolcott,
Chace, and Stammer will probably
figure in the final quartet.
Predictions at such an early date are
hardly worth the making, because of
the uncertainty of track seasons. Tt is
satisfying to know, however, that Stan
ford possesses a number of first-place
men, and that some new material will
undoubtedly be discovered during the
semester. In any event, with the com
bined effort of new men and old, the
Card'nal can but hope for a fighting
chance. Good, hard training will be
necessary to develop a winning team.

dash, besides trying the sprints.
Of the old men, Chace, Wolcott,

Stammer, and Edwards look best in
the quarter-mile; Bonnett, Boomer
shire, and Irwin in the half; Wilson
and Auppperle in the mile; Murray,
Norton, Templeton, and Halstead in
the hurdles.
In the field, Stanford has a strong
coterie in the shotput. Besides Caugh
ey are Murray, Bedeau, and Bihlman.
Drake and King have both set up good
records in the hammer throw. Sisson
and Dingley are slated for the broad
jump. In the high jump, Templeton is
the only "S" man of promise. With him
will appear West and H. Lachmund.
The pole vault should result in a ma
jority of points for the Cardinal with
Krohn, Macomber, and possibly Tufts
on the runway.
The relay is always an unknown
quantity. Murray, Lynn, Wolcott,
Chace, and Stammer will probably
figure in the final quartet.
Predictions at such an early date are
hardly worth the making, because of
the uncertainty of track seasons. Tt is
satisfying to know, however, that Stan
ford possesses a number of first-place
men, and that some new material will
undoubtedly be discovered during the
semester. In any event, with the com
bined effort of new men and old, the
Card'nal can but hope for a fighting
chance. Good, hard training will be
necessary to develop a winning team.
With the registration of Reginald
Caughey, of Ukiah, and F. Chapman,
of Santa Rosa, Stanford's chances for
success in track this coming spring
are brought up another notch.
Reg Caughey achieved fame with
the weights in his preparatory school
and holds the Stanford Interscholastic
twelve-pound shotput record of ">0
feet. At the same meet in which he
registered this mark he also put the
sixteen-pound shot over 44 feet in
trying for the world's interscholastic
record. Caughey was a member of
the American team which toured the
Antipodes last spring and made sev
eral records in Australia and New
Zealand.
The addition of Chapman, Santa
Rosa's star miler, to the ranks of
Stanford students materially strength
ens the long-distance squad. He per
forms the distance in less than 4 min
utes, 30 seconds, and should prove a
good running mate for "Skin"' Wilson,
Two freshmen, C. Johnson and M.
M. Kirksey, are hailed as sprinters
that will make an account of them
selves in the Dig Meet, and along with
R. Grant, It. Needham, and Nikalson,
complete a formidable quintet of dash
men. Wright Lynn will be able to
run, and will compete in the 440-yard
dash, besides trying the sprints.
