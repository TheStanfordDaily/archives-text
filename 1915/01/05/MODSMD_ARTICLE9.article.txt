# DR. ANGELL PRAISES RUGBY SITUATION ON THE PACIFIC COAST
## Chairman of Faculty Athletic Committee Reviews Western Collegiate Sports in Paper Read at the National Meeting BASEBALL FAULTS NOTED 
### 
Dr. Frank Angell, head of the Psy
chology Department, and chairman of
the Faculty Athletic Committee, pre
sented a general review of athletics
on the Pacific coast in a paper sent to
the convention of the National Colle
giate Association in Chicago on De
cember 29. Although Dr. Angell was
not present his views were read be
fore the convention. Praise for the
rugby type of football played in the
West and recognition of the faults of
baseball on the coast received atten
tion.
"In the matter of "dragging' prepar
atory schools for promising athletes,
I should imagine," said Dr. Angell,
"we are not so strenuous as in the
East. At any rate the athletic 'drag'
hereabouts is not merely so important
a factor in "steering' sub-freshmen as
fraternity pledging, though occasion
ally the two run together. Per contra,
as between California and Stanford,
the fraternities through mutual enter
tainment have a good influence in
toning down excessive partisanship."
The need of a strong central govern
ing body, with power to enforce its
mandates, and an increase in the power
of the referee, was emphasized by the
speaker in connection with the devel
opment of football."
Of Western baseball, he said: "Alas,
baseball maintains its position at the
foot of the list of sports in manners
and morals with a discouraging per
sistency. We have not, indeed, de
veloped that refined product of near
amateurism known as summer hotel
players. I fear, however, this cannot
be attributed to our superior virtue,
but to the scarcity of big summer ho
tels in California."
In regard to fatalities in football the
committee urged that the physically
unfit and the untrained player should
be kept off the football field in order
to insure the game from danger. Dr.
George W. Ehler. of the University of
Wisconsin, chairman of this commit
tee, reported that only three of the
fatalities last year were college men,
and that only one was a member of a
.regular varsity team.
"The results of last season," Dr.
Ehler said, "only emphasize that
which all college men have insisted
upon from the first â€”that no one
should participate in football who is
not physically fit in every respect,
and then only after he has had prop
er training, and has learned to adjust
himself to the conditions arising from
the game."
No drastic changes were included in
the report of the Football Rlues Com
mittee, which was to be presented be
fore the close of the conference.
