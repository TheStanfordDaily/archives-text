# COACHES AND CAPTAINS WILL ISSUE PLEA FOR NEW MEN TONIGHT
## DAVE FOLSOM WILL SPEAK Track, Crew and Baseball to Occupy Attention of Fans at Annual Rally at Encina Hall 
### 
Dave Folsom has been secured to
lead the eight speakers at the annual
combined crew, track, and baseball
rally, to be held this evening in En
eina Hall. His reputation has become
well established as a Stanford athletic
fan, and the rooters are assured of a
series of very interesting remarks.
Harry W. Maloney, who trained last
year's successful track team, will de
tail his scheme for conditioning a
squad worthy to succeed Captain Mc-
Kee's strong aggregation of cinder
path stars. Condition will undoubtedly
play a great part in determining the
outcome of the Big Meet in April, and
the rally this evening will afford
spring athletes a good chance to get
in touch with the trainer's plans.
Coach "Nig" Campbell, '13, and Cap
tain E. M. Bonnett, '15, will speak a
few words of advice and encourage
ment to the candidates for field and
track. The most sanguine dopester
can only hope for an even break in
the Intercollegiateâ€”an even break
which depends largely on the showing
of athletes who have not as yet been
discovered. A wealth of new material
will spell success for the Cardinal,
and everyone who has any past expe
rience or inclination to decorate the
oval for the next few months is urged
to sign u]). Training will commence
the first of the week.
Coach Billy Orr and Captain Tom
Workman, '14, will take care of the
baseball part of the program with a
few well-chosen remarks. The grad
uation of several of the heaviest hit
ters on the Varsity nine leaves a big
opportunity for new material, and in
attractive schedule offers an added in
ducement for all devotees of the na
tional pastime to sign up.
Husky Guerena, '11, who has been
chosen again to coach the eight, and
Captain G. A. Jacomini, '15, will wind
up the program with a plea for a larg
er crew squad. Only four veterans
have announced their intention of try
ing out for positions, and so several
places are open in the Varsity shell,
besides nine positions in the Fresh
man craft. California crew men have
been in active practice on the estuary
for four months, and the combined ef
forts of all of Stanford's huskies will
be necessary to maintain the long
str'ng of Cardinal victories.
The time of the meeting is 7:30. A
large attendance will no doubt be on
hand to usher in the season, and Yell
Leader Nixon, who will introduce the
speakers, is desirous of extracting a
number of good yells from the gath
ering. It is especially requested that
the rooters refrain from forced rail
road handclapping, as it delays the
program and destroys the intent'on
of the rally to promote sincere enthu
siasm among the students.
