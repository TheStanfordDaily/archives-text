than on the spirit which prompts the
action. Genuine cheering is indulged
in up to a certain point. Then the
enthusiasts become winded from yell
ing. The usual means of lengthening
out the period of applauding is to start
clapping slowly anil increase in vol
ume to a certain point, and then com
mence over again. Sometime this will
continue for five or six minutes. Pure
