# DR. HRDLICKA DISCUSSES THE AMERICAN INDIANS
## TALK ILLUSTRATED BY STEREOPTICON SLIDES. "The Physical Relation of the American Indian to Western Asiatics" Is Topic. 
### 
Dr. Hrdlicka, an anthropologist of
the National Museum and a represen
tative of the Archeological Institute of
America, lectured in the chapel last
evening on "The Physical Relation of
the American Indian to the People of
Western Asia," illustrating his talk by
stereopticon pictures which had here
tofore never been shown, and which
are a result of his personal research.
Dr. Hrdlicka said in part:
''The assumption that Indians were
not human beings was drawn from the
fact that the Bible makes no mention
of Indians. The theory that the Indi
ans are descendants of the lost tribes
of Israel disproved this assumption.
"Until recent years no action of
American research has been under
taken, but owing to the Smithsonian
Institute, the subject of anthropology
is acquiring greater prominence.
"The questions arse: 'What is the
American Indian? Ts he a single race?
or a combination of two separate
.races?' In order to answer these
queries, anthropologists have accum
ulated Indian skeletons and studied
the living Indian. Special features of
the Indian are the color of his skin,
which ranges from a pale yellow to a
chocolate brown; black, coarse,
straight hair which is very resistant to
time, in that it seldom becomes white;
brown eyes which slant, being a little
higher on the right side, and finally
large teeth.
"There is great similarity between
the characteristics of the Indian and
those of the body of people from
northern Siberia, in that the two races
have a brown color, straight hair, and
the some characteristics of eyes and
nose.
"Another question of importance
arises: 'If not a distinct race, how
did the Indian come to America? By
logical deduction it is found that ho
must be related to the people of north
eastern Asia. Tt has been shown th?t
the parties did not migrate before the
glaciers or in the inter-glacier epochs,
but during the Prehistoric Stone Age
of Europe."
