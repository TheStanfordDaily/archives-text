# FORM INITIAL PLANS FOR BUILDING LINKS
## Stanford Golf Club Appoints a Committee to Oversee the Work of Construction 
### 
Plans for the early transformation
of the land back of Faculty hill into
a golf links were made at last night's
Golf Club meeting. Committees were
appointed to plan and get estimates
on the cost of the construction, and
the question of membership dues was
definitely decided, so that an approx
imate working capital might be calcu
lated.
A grounds committee, consisting of
Dr. H. R. Stolz. Professor R. E. Allav
dice, and L. Sloss, '15, will complete
arrangements for building the links.
A professional will lie brought here
in the near future to lay out the
course, and after that a scraper will be
put to work on the fairways.
Dues from the students and faculty
members will be five dollars per year,
or three dollars per semester. The
du"s were placed at this nominal
figure in order that the use of the
links would be in reach of all, and the
club insured of a large membership.
Residents of Palo Alto will be able
to avail themselves of the Stanford
course by paying an initiation fee of
five dollars, and fees of the same
amount each semester thereafter. A
committee on greens was appointed +o
decide on some regulation for both
resident and non-resident guests play
ing on the links.
Professor R. E. Allardice was elect
ed treasurer of the club. He will have
several assistants from among the
Student Body members who will aid
in collecting dues.
Hereafter, the intercollegiate con
tests with the California golf team
will be held under the auspices of the
Golf Club. The club will conduct the
try-outs and rate the team members.
