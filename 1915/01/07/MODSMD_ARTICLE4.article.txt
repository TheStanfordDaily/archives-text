# GYMNASIUM CREDIT GIVEN IN HANDBALL TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
In order to arouse a greater interest
in handball and to make it possible for
everyone to compete, gymnasium credit
will be given for play in tournaments.
There will be two handball tourna
ments during the semester, the first
a preliminary to the second which will
be the regular annual competition for
the Storey Handball Belt, which tro
phy is held for one year.
Tournament games may be played at
any time, except between 5 and H
o'clock and on either court, by mutual
consent. The man desiring the larg
er court has right of way over one
who might rather play in the smaller
one.
Practical prizes will be given the
winners, and possibly the runners-up.
Notices regarding the tournaments
will be posted in Encina Gymnasium.
