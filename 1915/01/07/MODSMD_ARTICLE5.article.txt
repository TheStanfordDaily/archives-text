# Chappie Will Make First Bow of Year Tomorrow
## Hammer of "High-Brow "Number" Will Fall on Pseudo-Intellectuals of Campus. 
### 
Chappie's Hammer, historic and ven
erable, is on view in the Bookstore
window today, which means that
"Chappie" himself will make his se
mester bow on the Quad tomorrow.
This "High-Brow Number," satirizing
the pseudo-intellectuals of the campus
in amusing fashion, will have a defi
nite appeal.
R. A. Griffin, '17, contributes the
literary feature of the issue in a par
ticularly clever dilettante, appropos of
the High-Brow, and tellling of the out
witting of "Parsifal Aristotle Sonam
bulus" at the hands of "Ariadne Dio
mede Snooks.'
A double-page feature poem. "The
Transfiguration." is furnished by the
facile pen of F. E. Hill. '11. R. \ T .
Wenzel, '16. has illustrated these orig
inal verses, which relate the regener
ation of an ostentatious transcendent
alism
Rodin's statute, "The Thinker," evi
dently offered an inspiration to F. S.
Murray, '16, who contributes an un
usual art creation in "Is Tt Worth
While?"
Two newly established novelties of
decided interest are the terse column,
"Roquets and Briquettes, in which
Chappie finds many pointed as well as
adverse criticisms hurled in his di
rection, and the first of a series of
interviews, in which Chappie partly
explains his editor'al to "The High-
Brows' in a droll manner.
The front-page poem by H. A. C'.,
'06. captioned "The So-Called High-
Rrow,' is in the satirical spirit of the
issue. Other verse features in keep
ins: with the number are by IT. M.
Levy, '16, and G. A. Hughes, '16.
Art work and "droll" is contributed
by H. A. C.. '16. Margery Bailey, '11.
.T. Olsen, '15, C. S. Milliken, '16. R. \.
Griffin, '17, .T. C. Cross. '17. H. S. Mar
shutz, '17, L. D. McDermott, '17. G.
