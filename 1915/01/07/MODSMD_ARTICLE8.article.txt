# CHAMPION OF NIPPON DEPLORES INTOLERANCE OF WHITE RACE
## Dr. Gulick, American Professor at University in Kioto, Blames Press For Causing International Ill Will by Perversion of the News Reports Concerning Japanese Nature PAYS TRIBUTE TO ISLAND PEOPLE 
### 
Dr. Sidney L. Gulick, American pro
fessor in Doshisha University at Kioto,
Japan, who for twenty-six years, has
been a resident of Nippon, addressed
the first assembly of the semester this
morning. His lecture concerned the
relations existing between Japan and
the United States, particularly the
Pacific coast section. After asserting
a claim to authority based on a gen
eration of work and play among the
Island people, D.v. Gulick decried the
consuming race prejudice which ho
said had no foundation other than the
rabid statements which are fed by dis
torted reports to the press.
By way of preface the speaker stated
that one of the misfortunes of being a
white man is that his race looks down
on every other race. He then struck
in brief the keynote of his argument,
which was that ignorant belief in the
inferiority of the yellow race, played
upon by lurid news statements is sol°-
ly responsible for the "Yellow Peril"
demon.
A fragmentary quotation of Dr. Gu
lick follows:
"1 was in Jena the Thursday before
the outbreak of the war, and during
those four or five days in which the
whole of Europe collapsed, it was
brought home to me what a vast
amount of false news is daily fo.rmed
and promulgated among the nations
of the world. Telegraphic news is so
commonly wrenched and twisted that
it promotes international ill-will and
suspicion."
Concerning the alien land bill, at
the time it was before the state legis
lature a year and a half ago, the visi
tor declared that the forbearance and
calm patience of the Japanese nation
was remarkable. He deplored the
American press reports that mobs in
Tokio were surging through the
streets, clamoring for war. specula
tions concerning the ease with which
a Japanese horde could invade Califor
nia. and other fire-brands.
To quote again with regard to the
evils of tho Japanese coolie class
which lead to the break:

'I do not doubt that the Japanese
and Americans alike were respon
sible for many sins in the early days.
What the balance was I don't know.
But I do know that the Japanese gov
ernment asked this country and this
state not to legislate against the Jap
anese laborers. 'We will handle the
situation ourselves, if you will let us,'
cabled Tokio. Thereupon, in 1906, was
fo.rmed a gentleman's agreement,
which for six years consistently held
back immigration laborers. How
many papers have announced that
fact?
"Ever since 1860, when Japan was
convinced that the United States had
an honorable policy in the Orient, the
Japanese people have cherished a
friendly regard for the American peo
ple. Their great ambition has been to
rise to such attainment in western
modes of life that they would be rec
ognized on a basis with other people."
Dr. Gulick recited instances of news
articles which exaggerated the num
ber of Japanese in the United States,
the amount of land in their possession,
thei.r military activity. "That," he
sa : d, "is the kind of thing which
causes their international ill-will. Nat
urally, the Japanese feel hurt, in
sulted."
After expressing a belief that a
change of attitude is breaking into the
minds of Californians and Americana,
Dr. Gulick reviewed the present in
ternal or'sis in Japan. He showed that
the tendency of the public mind is to
ward two reforms, —constitutional gov
ernment, and anti-militaristic policy.
The .recent dissolution of the cabinet,
he sa'd, was due to reluctance of the
people to vote the usual military in
crease budget.
Chancellor Jordan introduced the
speaker after a summary discussion of
the extremities in which Belgium,
Servia, Poland, and Syria have been
thrown. "The American people," he
stated, "are the only people who can
help the sufferers. It. is our duty to
lay up treasurers in heaven and
friends in Europe.'
