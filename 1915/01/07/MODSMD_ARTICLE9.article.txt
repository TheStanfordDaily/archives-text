year, and is a member of Quadrangle
Club, Skull and Snakes, and Beta
Thota Pi fraternity. He succeeds
L. F. Reineman, '1">, who will be un
able to fulfill the duties of the office
this semester.
It was also decided to hold a meet
ing of the Student Body in the As
sembly Hall some time next week, to
discuss intercollegiate relations with
the Univers'ty of California. The
questions which will be open for dis
cussion concern the renewal of Fresh
man football and track competition,
the holding of a second Varsity crew
rare, the elimination of students who
have been in the University only six
months from Varsity competition, and
the elimination of Freshmen from
Varsity games and meets. The first
two propositions seem to be approved
by the majority of students, as attest
ed by the st.raw vote taken last, se
mester. but whether the last two

clauses will be sanctioned is a mat
ter for a great deal of conjecture.
