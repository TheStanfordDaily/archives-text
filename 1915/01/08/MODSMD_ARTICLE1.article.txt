# VARSITY WILL MEET OLYMPICS TOMORROW
## Veteran Team Selected to Open Baseball Season DENT AND HAYES BATTERY Many Substitutes to Be Used in Initial Game by Coach Orr. Winged "0" Boasts of Strong Team 
### 
If the weather gods smile upon the
campus tomorrow afternoon, the crack
of the bat and whiz of the spheroid will
announce the opening of the 1915
baseball season, when Captain Work
man leads his charges against the
Olympic Club nine. Picking up splint
ers and eating peanuts will again be
come the fad for all loyal Stanford
diamond fans. The initial game is
scheduled to commence promptly at
three o'clock.
Coach Hilly Orr and the Cardinal
skipper have selected a strong nine
to take the field, with seven veterans
and two of last year's substitutes in
cluded in the line-up. No player will
.remain in the contest longer than four
innings, after which he will be re
lieved by another aspirant, who may
be permitted to finish the game. In
this manner at least two full teams
will have an opportunity to get into
action.
Dent will be seen 111 his old posi
tion on the receiving end until re
lieved by Landers later in the game.
Three pitchers have been chosen to
work out in the box, Hayes leading off,
followed by Hoever and Mattei.
Captain Workman will cover first
base probably throughout the game, in
order to direct the work of the nine.
The keystone sack has been turned
over to Stafford, who played the posi
ion all last season. The berth of
shortstop, which promises to be the
most hotly contested place on the
team, will see Stevens, substitute in
1914, covering the ground, working in
conjunction with Stafford. Dickie is
to relieve Stevens after the fourth in
ning. The infield is completed by the
three-year veteran, McCloskey, who
li;is been named to hold down the dif
ficult corner.
Four candidates will alternate in the
outfield. Day will appear at left, with
Noonan as a partner in the opposite
garden. O'Neill and Downing are to
assume the duties of centerfielder.
The Olympic Club team, which is
under the management of George Fra
zier, is rated as a particularly fast
nine. During the past months the
Winged "O" diamond stars have been
playing in the Bay City Winter T.encue,
and as a result arc in fine fettle. Al.
Enrlo, connected with Spalding & Com
pany. of San Francisco, and umpire
of several games here last, season, has
been secured by Manager Wilcox to
officiate tomorrow.
Captain Workman is planning to di
