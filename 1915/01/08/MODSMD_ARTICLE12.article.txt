# "STAY OUT"
## 
### 
"Come out, and stay out.' With this
slogan ringing in their ears upward
of three hundred athletes signed up
at the rally last night to take part
in the three major sports, namely
baseball, basketball and crew. It may
be that some of the men signed up in
the heat of the moment and the en
thusiasm of the rally. Everyone was
advised to withhold his name if he did
not intend to go with a determination
to stay out.
In order to attain results a person
should exert every energy in the
proposition or activity, and support it
from start to finish. Half-hearted,
luke-warm spirit is worse than no sup
port, because it is of uncertain quan
tity and quality. Numbers do not
count for ought. It is the spirit back
of each individual's determination
which nets results.
Some of the athletes will probably
drop out before the season concludes,
but do not let it be said that you were
one of those who left the squad. A
system has been arranged in all
branches of sport, whereby every man
will be given every opportunity to de
velop and show his worth.
As the coaches and captains of the
Varsity teams stated last night, it is
impossible to determine the ability of
a man in the course of a few weeks.
Some of the material which appears
the greenest at the outset develops oft
times into the best athletes. It is not
what a person has done, but what he
can do which counts.
The man who stays out and aids
in developing the team is the man who
makes good. Each man who signed
up pledged himself to stay out from
now until the end of the training sea
son.
