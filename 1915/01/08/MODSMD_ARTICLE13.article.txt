# EASTERNER DISAGREES WITH ARGUMENTS OF DR. GULICK
## Declares Japanese Influx Threatens Long-Standing Integrity of the American People. 
### 
Taking a stand directly opposite to
that of Dr. Sidney L. Gulick, who yes
terday spoke to a Stanford audience
as a champion of the Japanese govern
ment in its fight against existing race
prejudice, Mr. Montaville Flowers, ex
tension lecturer of the Universities
of Indiana, Kansas, Wisconsin, North
Dakota, and Minnesota, and president
of the American Lyceum Society, to
day expressed his belief that Dr. Gu
lick had touched but the surface of
his subject, and that any one who
knew the facts would fail to be con
verted to the lecturer's point of view.
Mr. Flowers has been a student of the
so-called Japanese-American problem
for considerable time, and has the
facts of the question, pro and con,
ready for presentation in a clear and
concise form. He believes that the
Japanese are the aggressors today,
and that they deserve 110 sympathy.
"The United States," declared Mr.
Flowers, "needs to maintain the status
quo; it needs to hold to the naturaliza
tion code and immigration laws as
they have existed, as regards Asiatics
since the end of the eighteenth cen
tury. Asiatics have always been inelig
ible to citizenship. T want the gov
ernment to hold to that.
'But I will say that Japan will not
have war if she can do without it; if
she can get what she wants by other
means. The real issue is not war, but
the preservation of our national unity
and racial purity, because the aim of
Japan is to secure rights of citizenship
in this country and full marriage
rights for the Japanese.
"California's stand on the Japanese
question is justified. The East does
not agree with the West because of
ignorance. And on account of this
ignorance the Eastern states are prej
udiced against California. Public opin
ion forces the government into re
fusing to back this state as it should.
Arizona's law was undoubtedly uncon
stitutional."
Mr. Flowers is visiting on the cam
pus but for twenty-four hours. He
declared his desire to stand before a
Stanford audience and present the
Japanese-American question from the
American side.
