When you first .return to college,
Life is rather easy pickins.
There's unpacking, registration,
You can sleep to beat the dickens.
The first day of work
Is just visiting new classes,
With the once-over ready
For the pretty freshman lasses.
The second day is another pipe—
Cares are easy enough to shirk,
Hut when the third day comes
You're overwhelmed with work.
About college there's one fact—
Unadulterated, pure,
Though college starts darn slowly,
It's getaway is sure.
