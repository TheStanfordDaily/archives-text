# MOVEMENT ON FOOT WILL SHORTEN HUDSON RACE
## PRINCETON FAVORS CHANGE IN POUGHKEEPSIE COURSE. Proposed Three-Mile Length Has Been Used in All Western Intercollegiate Regattas. 
### 
If the movement to reduce the
length of the Poughkeepsie crew race
from four to tliree miles is successfm,
Princeton will again enter that noted
athletic classic, according to Dr. J.
Duncan Spaeth, the coach that has
been so successful in training the
Tiger oarsmen.
It is claimed by Dr. Spaeth and
other Princeton authorities that the
four-mile racc is too strenuous for an
undergraduate, and that it is danger
ous for him to enter such an event.
However, the three-mile race : s a le-s
dangerous grind.
The attitude of Dr. Spaeth is strong
ly endorsed by western crew men and
coaches, particularly at Stanford,
where the three-mile race has pro
duced favorable results.
In speaking of the proposed change
to the three-mile course at Pough
keepsie, Dr. Spaeth said recently: "I
am opposed to the four-mile course, ,
and 1 think the proposal to reduce the :
distance on the Hudson to three miles 1
a move in the right direction. I am
not one of those who say a man can
not be trained to .row four miles so ,
that he is able to do so without injuri- ;
ous effect, but I do say that the aver
age undergraduate cannot be taught j
to row the distance without serious j
danger of injury. The oarsmen in I
Princeton varsity boats average con
siderably under twenty-one years of
age.
"A student in college should do
something else besides row. He lias
an education to obtain. In order to
train properly for the four-mile racc
it is necessary for a crew to row more
miles each day than if they were
pointed for a three-mile race. The in
crease in mileage preparation is out
of proportion to the difference in the
length of the race. This large margin
of extra work is often enough to over
develop the muscles so that a college j
graduate taking up some sedentry or- i
cupaCon upon obtaining his degree j
faces sueli a radical change in his j
mode of life that his health is en- j
dangered."
Princeton has been remarkably suc
cessful in her three-mile races with i
Yale, Harvard, and Pennsylvania, and |
if the Hudson classic is changed to i
three miles, the Tigers will be strong i
competitors for honors.
