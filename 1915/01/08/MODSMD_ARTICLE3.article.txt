# CARDINAL ROOTERS USHER IN 1915 TRACK, CREW AND BASEBALL SEASON
## Two Hundred and Seventy Loyal Athletes Pledge Their Willingness to Devote the Entire Semester to Furthering the Cause of Spring Sport in Stanford University 
### 
The athletes and most energetic
rooters of Stanford University gath
ered at the annual Encina rally last
evening, and ushered in the spring
athletic season with a rousing "New
Spell." A spirit of determination —a
determination to make good and per
petuate the succession of Stanford vic
tories—ran through the assembly,
which manifested its earnestness more
in a tense undertone of willingness to
work hard throughout a whole season
than by expressing it in a few wild
yells and hollow handclapping.
For the year of the Fair has ar
rived, and Stanford must live up to
a reputation established in the East
through the steady grind of twenty
years, by again triumphing over Cali
fornia in baseball, track, and crew.
One hundred and forty-six men

signed up for par
ticipation in track
This number falls
short of last
year's record turn
out of 166, but a
star coterie ofj
veterans are back
to form a point
winning basis for
the entire squad.
The baseball .reg
istration totals

sixty-four, just equaling the num
ber on last year's squad. Sixty-one are
out for crew, again tying last year's
total. Of this number twenty-eight
are first-year men.
Carey Nixon introduced the first
speaker of the evening, Trainer Harry
W. Maloney. As the successful phy
sical director of two winning track
teams and two winning crews, his
remarks bore the weight of experi
ence, and a deep interest in Cardinal
athletics. Maloney vouched for the
efficiency of tlie captains of the va
rious teams. "You are very lucky in
the selection of the men who are to
lead this year's teams. The captains
are all men of the true Stanford
type."
He continued: "Every man who can
conscientiously spare the time should
sign up tonight, put his shoulders to
the wheel and help the captains and
coaches round out winning teams.

This year especially we want to make i
a good showing. As regards training, I
would say to the old men, go
slow, and to the new material, heed
carefully the words of you.r coach.
More events have been lost by over
training than by undertraining. A
great opportunity is open at Stanford
for men who wish to get out and work
hard from the start." Maloney advised
all new students to try-out for a Var
sity emblem and a Phi Beta Kappa key,
and, in concluding, urged all to report
their bumps—"for what is a mere
scratch today may develop into a seri
ous injury tomorrow."
Hilly Orr, baseball coach, had his
audience with him from the start. "I
would like to see every person in col
lege try-out for baseball this year,"
said he. "No place is cinched, and
everyone will be given a fair chance."
Captain Tom Workman emphasized
the importance of coming out with a
determination to stick to it and to work
in harmony with the coach and cap
tain.
Coach Campbell, of the track team,
explained the situation on the oval in
a few terse sentences. "We have nev
er won a track meet by more than ten
points it will be a hard proposition to
keep up the string of Cardinal vic
tories. California is getting back old
men and obtaining prep school stars
in a great effort to win the meet in
this year of the Fair, and to beat such
opposition every man will have to get
out and work through the entire sea
son. The first training rule will be
to sign up and stay out until April
17th."
Track Captain Bonnett clinched the

argument by re
marking that
"there are prob
ably some men
who don't want to.
go out because
they don't think
they can do much.
If they feel that
way they prob
ably never will.
iVe want to christ
en Califo r n i a ' s

new real quarter-mile track as well as
the rugby team christened their new
turf.'

The .rally ended with a few words
from Captain G. A. Jacomini, who
•said: "I want every man—old and
new—to get out. We haven't Califor
nia's numbers or facilities, but we
have a better spirit—a spirit which
will pull us through. The California
squad has been cut to twenty, and
that shows they mean business. We'll
have a good tussle to win."
