There is more than one way of kill
ing a cat, and it's not impossible, if a
fellow uses a little tact, to find a new
way of preventing his wife from call
ing ui) at the club and .asking him to
bring home a steak from town for din
ner.
Some say that there's a reason why
the phone was taken out of the Fac
ulty Clubhouse.
Wives of "profs" used to be able to
call their husbands up at that pleas
ant loitering place, but never more.
That faculty bunch, particularly the
men, is a smart crowd, and when Ru
fus, the colored keeper, "chucked up
his job," because he joined the Y. M.
C. A., the wise ones had to get their
heads together and find either anoth
er "coon" or a more reliable system.
What the arguments were, or what
the deeision was. no one will know,
not even the wives, but it's a fact that
the phone has been removed, a some
what significant feature, considering
the situation.
