# ATHLETIC PROBLEMS TO BE DEBATED SATURDAY
## Intercollegiate Committees Face Four Changes FIVE-YEAR AGREEMENT ENDS California Will Ask For Freshman Exclusion From Varsity Competition and Six-Month Rule 
### 
The Intercollegiate Agreement Com
mittees, representing the interests of
both Stanford and California, will meet
in San Francisco Saturday evening,
January 9, for the consideration of
four important questions which have
recently prompted discussion. The
meeting will be held in the Palace
Hotel at seven o'clock. The issues at
stake include the questions of the
proposed Freshman Intercollegiate
football game; whether or not Fresh
man competition in Varsity games
shall be permitted; in regard to the
six-months' rule; and if a Second Var
sity crew meet is advisable.
The Intercollegiate Agreement be
tween the two universities, which has
held for the past five years, expired
after the big game in November. Roth
Stanford and California are in favor of
the plans of the Freshman Intercolle
giate and also fo.r a Second Varsity
crew race, but they hold different
views in regard to the other two ques
tions. California desires to exclude
Freshman from varsity competition in
future athletics, while Stanford sees
no reason why the present policy in
this regard should be altered, and op
poses the plan decidedly. California
also suggests a "Six-Months Rule,"
which would prohibit a student from
competing in intercollegiate athletics
if he had not registered in college
during the semester previous to the
one in which he desired to compete.
Stanford vigorously opposes this sug
gestion.
Decisions reached by the committee
at the meeting Saturday will not be
final, however, since they will be sub
mitted to the Executive Committees of
the two universities for Student Body
approval. The final meeting will be
held on the last Saturday in the cur
rent month.
An effort will also Tie made to fix
the time for the crew race, when the
tides will not prove a. handicap to any
Varsity eight in the annual competi
tion. An intercollegiate agreement
covering soccer and basketball will
also be formed, these two sports bav
ins been without an agreement here
tofore.
The Stanford Intercollegiate Com
mittee is composed of A. E. Worthy,

fornia Committee consists of V. H.
