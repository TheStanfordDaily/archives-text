" The Master Mind
is absorbed in the search for things
better than now exist, and rests
discontented under 'just as good.'
Mediocrity follows the beaten path,
and is always a few laps behind."
Many little "wrinkles" in athletic
equipment are being constantly de
veloped in our work. In Spalding
equipment you invariably get mnre
than you actually buy. It will be
found "custom made" to your re
quirements.
A postal will bring you our cata
logue showing you everything new
and up-to-date for athletic sports.
