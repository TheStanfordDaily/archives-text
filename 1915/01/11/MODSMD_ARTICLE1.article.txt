"The Pilla.rs of Society" is one of
the first plays which Ibsen directed
against society organized on hypoc
risy and sustained by the enslave
ment of the individual by fear of pub
lic opinion. It does not contain the
extreme hopeless pessimism of the
famous dramatist's later years, for he
compromises with romanticism by the
redemption of his chief sinner at the
last moment. The play is free from
symbolism that does not symbolize
and several individual touches are
found, in which may be traced the in
comparable master-hand. No one
doubts that Ibsen's plays have broad
ened the scope of the drama, at the
same time rebuking conventionalism
and substituting for dramatic treat
ment the realities of life in the place
of the accustomed romanticism and
trivialities.
Is International Success.
There are melodramatic passages in
the play but no theatricalism. It was
the intent of the author that the force
of his truths should be sufficiently
impressive without having to resort
to the use of mere theatrical interpre
tation. That is Ibsen's distinction.
Masquers will produce the play in
this spirit, which insures a refresh
ing performance. The theatrical suc
cess of "The Pillars of Society" has
been striking, having been produced
throughout the civilized world, not
ably in Scandinavia, Germany, Eng
land, France, and the United States,
Before 1900 It had been acted more
than twelve hundred times in Ger
many and Austria. This extraordin
ary success is not due primarily to the
perfection of its technical construc
tion, but to the fact that it deals with
a vital subject in a vital manner.
F. L. Mathieu. of San Francisco,
will act as coach of the Masquers'
production, a fact that Insures its ar
tistic success. Mathieu's authorita
tive direction has been responsible in
no small degree for the dramatic tri
umph of a numbe.r of campus success
es, including "The Only Way," "The
Fortune Hunters," and the more re
cent "Ready Money."

Masquers will produce the play in

Before 1900 It had been acted more
than twelve hundred times in Ger

perfection of its technical construc

a vital subject in a vital manner.

"The Pilla.rs of Society" is one of
the first plays which Ibsen directed
against society organized on hypoc
risy and sustained by the enslave
ment of the individual by fear of pub
lic opinion. It does not contain the
extreme hopeless pessimism of the
famous dramatist's later years, for he
compromises with romanticism by the
redemption of his chief sinner at the
last moment. The play is free from
symbolism that does not symbolize
and several individual touches are
found, in which may be traced the in
comparable master-hand. No one
doubts that Ibsen's plays have broad
ened the scope of the drama, at the
same time rebuking conventionalism
and substituting for dramatic treat
ment the realities of life in the place
of the accustomed romanticism and
trivialities.
Is International Success.
There are melodramatic passages in
the play but no theatricalism. It was
the intent of the author that the force
of his truths should be sufficiently
impressive without having to resort
to the use of mere theatrical interpre
tation. That is Ibsen's distinction.
