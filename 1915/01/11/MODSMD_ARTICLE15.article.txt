# TO SUBSCRIBERS
## 
### 
In the past it lias been the custom
for many complaints to be turned in
by the subscribers to the effect that
they did not .receive this paper after
paying their good money for a sub
scription. We rejoice to find so few
complaints of a similar nature this
semester. It means that the business
management is aiming to please the
readers. In a way, we almost feel
that there is something wrong in the
fact that so little fault lias been
found with the delivery of each issue.
Complaints mean dissatisfaction. No
complaints signify satisfaction. How
ever, if you are not satisfied, do not
fail to register your "kick," and the
matter will be rectified immediately.
