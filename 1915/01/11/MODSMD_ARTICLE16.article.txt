# EARLY COPY
## 
### 
To aid in our attempt to publish
an early paper, so that the news of
the day may be in the hands of the
subscribers before the evening meal
hour, it will be necessary to have all
notices and announcements for our
columns in hand before two o'clock
in the afternoon. This ruling will oe
absolutely and rigidly enforced. No
announcements will be received after
the prescribed hour. We would also
ask our many contributors of infor
mation to have in hand any facts that
they desire in this paper as far as
possible ahead of time, in order that
the reporters will not be hampered
in their endeavors to file early copy.
