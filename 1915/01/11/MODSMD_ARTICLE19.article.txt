J To the Editor:
Dear Sir: At the last University As
sembly the efforts of the Student
Body to welcome the speaker of the
morning with the customary cheers
was noticeably weak. This same weak
ness has become more and more ap
parent at each Assembly. This dem
onstrates that it is a failure. The tra
dition ought to be abolished.
The custom of cheering for a speak
er at an Assembly arose somewhere in
the past, but time lias shown it to be
a weak tradition. Not only does the
giving of the "Rah-Rah-Rah" of the
athletic field fall below the dignity of
a University Assembly, but it is dis
concerting to the speaker.
Doubtless, the custom arose through
a desire to extend the student welcome
to the visitor or to the speaker. In
the usual Assemblies a marked degree
I of courtesy can bette.r be shown by
lspontaneous applause and by the au
dience arising to its feet, as it should
do. out of deference both to the guest
of the University and the President or
! Chancellor of the University.
The introductory words of the Presi
dent or chairman of the Assembly
j should be enough without a cheer from
; the well-leader. At the conclusion of
the address "Hail, Stanford. Hail,'
should suff'ce in marking the meet
ins as a student body affair, apart
1 I from any ordinary University gath
ering.
