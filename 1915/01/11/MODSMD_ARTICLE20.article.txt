rOMJIIMCATION.
To the Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
The item in your Friday issue about
the Faculty Club and the telephone
was obviously a "humorous story,"
but I find that none of the members of
the club are enthusiastic in their ap
preciation of the humor, and some
are inclined to be a little indignant.
If my guess is correct —that the can
didate for a place on your staff who
wrote the skit got the idea from a
source outside the Stanford campus
altogether—l think a moment's intro
spection will show you that you re
gard the club about which the original
story was written as being somehow
open to suspicion as to their conduct,
provided the story is true, or as being
somewhat libeled if the story is not
true. I do not think that anybody at
Stanford is likely to take the infer
ences of your article seriously—cer
tainly they are not, even in the re
motest degree, justified—but still it
might be the fair thing for you to
print in the space reserved for accu
rate restatements that there has been
no telephone in the Faculty Club
house for more than three years, that
there never was any employe named
Rufus. nor any "colored keeper" at al!
connected with the club, and that
otherwise there is nothing true in the
story, in fact or inference. What is
left is the humor, which is all that
you aimed at in the first place, any
way.
A MEMBER OF THE CLUB.
