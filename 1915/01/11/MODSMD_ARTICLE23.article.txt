# REV. BOYD OF PORTLAND FILLS MEMORIAL PULPIT
## 
### 
The Rev. .T. H. Boyd, of the First
Presbyterian church, of Portland, Ore
gon, was the visiting minister in the
Memorial Church yesterday. In speak
ing of the great work which Jesus per
formed, Rev. Boyd brought forth his
choosing of the twelve apostles as
his fundamental task. Mr. Boyd said
in part:
"The aim of Jesus was to institute
a moral and spiritual movement so
vast and universal that the life of man
might be pure and serene. The work
depended not alone on Jesus, but on
the co-operation of the twelve apos
tles chosen by Him. This selection is
the most momentous in His Career al
though it disappoints every one, for
the chosen ones are men of toil not
of thought.
"But Jesus selected them not for
what they we.re, but for what they
were to become. The miracle of
Christ, is not the stilling of storms,
but His taking the undeveloped human
nature and converting it into men.
Christ as He stands surrounded by his
twelve apostles is the man dealing
with human beings. The possibilities
of nature are divided into three class
es: degeneracy, mediocrity, and ex
ceptional development, and Jesus as
pired to develop his followers."
