# Boulware to Start Cross Continent Walk in March
## 
### 
Contrary to false report that was
widely circulated 011 the campus and
in Palo Alto, and given credence in
the San .Tose Mercury-Herald last
week, Clarke L. Boulware. ex-'l I, has
not departed from his original inten
tion to walk from San Francisco to New
York in not more than one hundred
days on a wager of $5000 with a lo
cal merchant,
ft was alleged that the contract had
been given up, owing to the difficulty
with which it could be proved that
Boulware actually covered the entire
distance on foot. But Boulware plans
to hike across the continent in a strik
ingly colored suit of cardinal and
white, thus making himself easily rec
ognizable. In addition lie will obtain
the vises of the station masters and
postmasters en rou*\ Spalding Bros.,
the noted manufacturers .of sporting
goods are at present engaged in mak
ing a half dozen pairs of tramping
shoos for Boulware. A San Francisco
picture company is seeking to make
arrangements with him whereby they
will take a series of pictures when
110 starts on his trip, and when he re
turns.
Boulware announces that lie will
start on his long journey about March
15. At that time he believes road con
ditions will be perfect. The agree
ment. states that he must start by
that date.
In order to be in the best of condi
tion for his long hike, Boulware is
training with a daily cross-country
run of about fifteen miles.
