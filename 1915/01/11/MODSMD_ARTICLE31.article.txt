WASHINGTON, Jan. 11.â€”Official
comment by the Department of State
upon the British note has been withheld
until a subsequent detailed reply is
forthcoming. It is generally believed
that the tone of the note was extreme
ly conciliatory, couched in much
friendlier terms than the protest. The
United States will mark time until
further details have beeen received.
There has been no communication
from England except upon eases of in
dividual cargoes.
