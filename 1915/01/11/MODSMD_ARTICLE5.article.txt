# VARSITY DROPS FIRST GAME OF SEASON TO OLYMPIC CLUB NINE
## Clubmen Rally in Final Frame, Scoring Three Runs—Two Teams Are Used STANFORD PLAYS GOOD BALL 
### 
In the init'al game of the season the
Stanford Varsity was forced to christ
en its new field with a 4 to 2 defeat
at the hands of the Winged "0" nine
after a nip and tuck diamond battle
of seven innings' duration. The con
test seemed sewed up with Cardinal
threads until the final frame, when
the clubmen came from behind and
shoved three runs across the plat
ter.
Captain Workman's charges started
to make things hum in the opening
round. With one down, Stafford' am
bled to first base, after receiving a
free passage. Tom Workman fol
lowed with a Texas Leaguer, which
narrowly escaped the Olympic Club
second baseman. Stafford moved up
to second on the play. The next bat
ter up, Babe Dent, poked a clean sin
gle to center, bringing Stafford home
with the first tally of the game. Af
ter McCloskey had fanned. O'Neill
drew a walk thereby filling the bags.
Stevens, however, missed a glorious
opportunity by falling a prey to the
wiles of the Olympic slabsman, Scham
mel, making three strike-outs for the
inning.
Clubmen Even l*p Count.
In the third frame the clubmen
evened up the count by registering
their first tally. Mensing, first up,
poled a single to deep right. Scham
mel was safe on a fielder's choice in an
unsuccessful attempt to force Men
sing out at second. Andrade. quite up
to expectations, slipped a bingle to
center, scoring Mensing. After Mc-
Grath walked, leaving the bases fully
populated, the situation loomed up
rather gloomy for Stanford, with only
one down. Hayes, however, tight
ened up, forcing Brown to pop up to
short and Hean to walk the plank via
the strike-out route.
Tbe Varsity followed suit in the sec
ond half of the same inning. After
one out, Dent's patience was reward
ed with four wide throws. Thereup
on the Stanford catcher fooled the
bleachers by working the delayed ste il
to the keystone sack. McCloskey fol
lowed with a timely hit to center field,
registering Dent. The next two bat
ters fanned.
With only one more inning to play,
and the game apparently salted awav,
the Winged "O" nine produced a bat
ing rally that netted them three runs
and the victory. Whalen. first up,
after singling to center, promptly
stole second. When Workman drop
ped Dickie's throw of Benham'<
grounder, the latter was safe at first,
and Whalen pulled up safely at third.
Tramutola. former Santa Clara player,
'followed with a wall drive to left,
bringing Whalen across the pan with
the tying run. Benham and Tramuto
la advanced to third and second, re
spectively on McGrath's infield out.
