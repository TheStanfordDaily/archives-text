# FRESHMAN EXCLUSION PREVENTS AGREEMENT
## COMMITTEES OPPOSED ON PROBLEM OF KEEPING FRESHMEN FROM VARSITY COMPETITION CALIFORNIA DEMANDS RULE ASSEMBLY TOMORROW WILL BE FOLLOWED BY VOTE TO DETERMINE POSITION. 
### 
It developed yesterday that the first
snag which prevented any progress on
the part of the Intercollegiate Agree
ment Committees on Saturday evening
was the question of excluding the
freshmen from all varsity Competition.
The California committee declared
itself very strongly in favor of the pro
posed ruling, and wanted this ques
tion settled before any othe.r steps are
taken to complete the athletic com
pact which will succeed the five-year
agreement, just expired.
1 his vote will enable the Stanford
committee to know the exact attitude
of the student body when they attend
the next conference with the Califor
nia committee.
At the assembly tomorrow, which
will be strictly a student gathering, a
member of the Stanford committee will
present in detail the problem as it
now stands, and the proceedings of
Saturday's conference. After this the
meeting will be thrown open for a gen
eral discussion of the question from
the floor. A vote to determine Stan
ford's position will be taken on the
Quad later in the day.
Another question of importance to
come before tomorrow's assembly is
that of the unnecessary disturbance
due to the erection of the Freshmen
bonfire. The University Conference re
cently discussed this question at
length, and a committee appointed to
investigate the matter reported on the
best means of avoiding undue excite
ment. Their solution is to delay the
work of actual construction of the
pyre t'll one week before the night of
the football rally. Resolutions endors
ing the position of the conference will
be brought before the assembly to
morrow for ratification.
