Not only will this question be dis
cussed, but a statement will be

guarding of the bonfire prior to
the l?ig Game. These two problems
are of great importance to every ma
triculated member of the University.
The greater emphasis will be placed
on the former of the two questions, be
cause it is of the greatest importance
at the present time.
Both sides of the proposition will be
stated, giving arguments advanced for
and against Freshmen competition in
varsity contests. Matters that trans
pired at the meeting of the Intercolle
giate Agreement Committees last Sat
urday night will be presented.
Tomorrow's assembly is called to

students. It is needless to urge the
issue which confronts the Agreement
Committees. Members of these com
mittees are selected to represent the
students. It is needlss to urge the
men and women to be present at the
assembly. But do not feel that you
have done your part by being present
at the meeting and casting your bal
lot for or against the proposition.
Public expression is the thing which
is desired. This issue is up to the
Student Body. Voice your opinion
and stand by that which you honestly
believe is just and right.
