# FEATURE STORIES
## 
### 
Considerable misapprehension has
arisen regarding the idea and the
purpose of feature stories in the col
umns of this pa per. They are based
mostly on matters of more or less
trivial importance which would not he
news in themselves, hut which are
made so through original adaptation.
Whether o.r not they remain news is
something for each one to decide for
himself. It is not our place to give
a definition of news. Many attempts
have been made by journalistic au
thorities to define news, but no accu
rate definition has been secured
which satisfies everyone. News to

some would not be news to others.
The idea of the feature story is not to
cast a slur and not to ridicule any
one or anything, but to create a sense
of humor in certain stories that ad
mit of such treatment. True it is that
everyone cannot see the humorous
side in stories of this nature. Such
stories are published in good faith
and their purpose is not to put any
one in an unpopular light. In the
main, they are to add spice, life, and
variety to the otherwise straight news
items of everyday occurrence. Feature
stories are not to be taken seriously.
