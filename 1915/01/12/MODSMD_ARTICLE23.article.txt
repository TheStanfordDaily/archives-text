# INFORMAL GATHERING OPENS TRACK SEASON
## CAMPBELL AND MALONEY OUTLINE POLICY AND EXPLAIN TRAINING REGULATIONS. COACH NAMES VARSITY AIDES 
### 
A group of more than one hundred
candidates for cinder path honors
gathered at the Track House yester
day afternoon and listened to the
counsel of Trainer Harry Maloney and
Coach E. P. Campbell. The men were
also introduced to Gymnasium In
structor Owen, who will have charge
of their daily .registration at the oval,
but the soft condition of the track
made practice on the initial night
practically impossible.
Maloney laid down some simple
rules for conditioning the athletes at
the start. He advocated that they
keep out of drafts, practice modera
tion in smoking and refrain from in
dulging in food difficult of digestion,
such as rich pastry and highly sea
soned dishes. The trainer advised all
to report even the slightest injuries,
and stated in concluding: "I strongly
advocate that you fellows stay for the
entire season, even if you are green.
Companionship helps the Varsity men,
and is the nearest thing which corre
sponds to the close teamwork which
is characteristic of Rugby.'
"Stay Out** I' sistv Coach,
"We are in for a hard semester,"
stated E. P. Campbell. "California has
been doing her level best to get to
gether all lie.r available stars, and we
must fight them from the very begin
ning. New material must be devel
oped to win the sprints.—and the
meet. Stay out—that is the way we
won the last two meets. In each case
California seemed to have the edge
on us the first of the semester, but we
pulled through to success, because
nearly all who signed up remained in
training up to the day of the Big
Meet."
The coach explained that at first in
formal competitions would be held
among the men, and that about March
1 these would give way to meets with
the San Francisco clubs and the
Southern colleges. The possibility of
several meets for the Freshmen and
non-varsity squad was also suggested.
Hernmmen<ls Slow Start.
"Start out easy," was the warning
given out. by the coach in conclud
ing. "Don't try and break the record
the first night out, but content your
selves with a mere jog around the
track for at least a week or two. And
everyone show up at the meets. The
slowest stragglers push those in front
along, and this notion is imparted to
the man in front, who possesses the
combined 'go' of the ones in the rear.
Use your heads—think about how you
are going to run—and you will be
successful."
