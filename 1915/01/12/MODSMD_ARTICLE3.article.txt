# SPRING COMING.
## So Ruble Queeners 'On the Fence" Both in Body and in Soul Twitter Merrily. 
### 
A new form of queening has been
discovered upon the campus. A new
variation from the "movies" and
"walking.' Regardless of passers-by,
and quite unconcerned by the novelty
of their situation, a laddie and a lass
were spied perched bird-like upon the
fence in front of Roble Hall, and, bird
like, were twittering merrily. It was
the twentieth century version of
Chaucer's Chanticleer and Pertelote.
It was a pretty pastoral scene, but one
query was left in the mind of the pas.H
er-b.v: Why the indecision? For were
they not both "upon the fence?"
