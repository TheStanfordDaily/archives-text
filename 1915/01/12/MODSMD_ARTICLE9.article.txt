The cast of Ibsen's brilliant play,
'The Pillars of Society," of which
Masquers Society promises an ambi
tious production Friday evening, Feb
ruary 5, will introduce a group of clev
er campus stars, whose dramatic abili
ty lias proved of the highest order in
previous roles.
Popular Theme Introduced.
"The Pillars of Society" is one of
the most popular of Ibsen's plays. 1*
is the history of Karsten Rernick, a
"pillar of society," who, in pursuance
of the duty of maintaining the respec
tability of his father's f'rm of ship
builders, has averted a disgraceful ex
posure by allowing another man,
Johann Tonnesen, to bear the discred
it not only of a love affair in which he
had himself been the main sin
ner, but of a theft which was never
committed.
The play has a number of good aci-

ins parts, in spite
of Ibsen's recorded
indignant denial
l that lie never wrote
r'parts." Few char

'complete and real
impression as

dramatic laurels. "Lona" is fhe spirit

membered as an important factor in
the success of "Seven Sisters' and
"Quality Street." \c "Lona Hessel"

Capable Players Cast.
The appearance of F. C. McColloch,
'17. in the leading male role of "Con
sul Bernick" is anticipated with inter
est, for he is a most capable actor and
will undoubtedly give a good account
of himself. Holbrook Blinn is the
best known exponent of this important
role in America. McColloch's inter-
