The cast of Ibsen's brilliant play,
'The Pillars of Society," of which
Masquers Society promises an ambi
tious production Friday evening, Feb
ruary 5, will introduce a group of clev
er campus stars, whose dramatic abili
ty lias proved of the highest order in
previous roles.
Popular Theme Introduced.
"The Pillars of Society" is one of
the most popular of Ibsen's plays. 1*
is the history of Karsten Rernick, a
"pillar of society," who, in pursuance
of the duty of maintaining the respec
tability of his father's f'rm of ship
builders, has averted a disgraceful ex
posure by allowing another man,
Johann Tonnesen, to bear the discred
it not only of a love affair in which he
had himself been the main sin
ner, but of a theft which was never
committed.
The play has a number of good aci-

ins parts, in spite
of Ibsen's recorded
indignant denial
l that lie never wrote
r'parts." Few char
lactsrs leave such a
'complete and real
impression as
leading femi ni n e
role. "Lona Hessel."
a which Miss Mar-

gery Ba'ley, '11, promises to win new
dramatic laurels. "Lona" is fhe spirit
I' right a:id truth. Ilcr life had sot
far beyond romance, but she had the
real ideals. Mrs. Fiske achieved one

of her greatest triumphs in this re
warding r<,le. Miss Bailey's gift for
interpretation is too well known to
need further comment. She will be re
membered as an important factor in
the success of "Seven Sisters' and
"Quality Street." \c "Lona Hessel"

Miss Elizabeth Taff, '15, will have

another import
ant role as "Mrs.
i3erniek, the con —
i sill's wife, who
wins ready sym
pathy because slit
has borne with
th e selfishness
and neglect of
her husband. Miss
Taff will have a

part in which to exhibit other phases
of he.r talent than in the delightful
ingenue roles with which she has been
identified. She has appeared in "The
Ideal Husband." "On the Quiet," and
Barrie's "Quality Street."
Capable Players Cast.
The appearance of F. C. McColloch,
'17. in the leading male role of "Con
sul Bernick" is anticipated with inter
est, for he is a most capable actor and
will undoubtedly give a good account
of himself. Holbrook Blinn is the
best known exponent of this important
role in America. McColloch's inter-

Elizabeth Taff
! pretation of the gentleman counter
| feiter, "Jackson Ives," in the sopoho-
I more comedy, 'Ready Money," last se
mester won decided approval.
J. C. Cross, '17, will play the juven
| ile lead as "Johan Tonnesen," Mrs.
j Bernick's younger brother, who. as?
Bernick's dearest friend, has rescued
him from the consequences of his in
discretion, and thereby made his latei
career possible. Cross has appeared
previously in 'Quality St.veet" and a?
the French head-waiter in "Ready
Money."
.Miss Florence Stewart. '1(5. as "Dina
Dorf," will have an unusually interest
ing ingenue role, which will afford her
scenes of pathos as well as feminine
charm. Miss Stewart won decided
praise for her work in"The Fortune
Hunter" and as "Margery Knox" in
"Men and Women" last semester.
Vttractive Comedy Featured.
W. J. Gross, '16, will have the im
portant light comedy role, "Hilrnar
Tonnesen," Mrs.Bernick's cousin, in
which he is expected to score another
dramatic success. Few better acting
parts are written than "Hilmar,"
whose frank comments of people and
th'ngs win unfailing laughter. Gross
has scored previously in"The Only
Way," "Quality Street," and "Men and
"Women.'
H. C. Soper, '16, will portray "Dr.
Rorlund,' the schoolmaster, a role that
will afford him exceptional opportuni
ties for clever comedy work.
Pathos Is Appealing
Miss Te.rese Dorroh. '16. will portray
the beautiful character of "Martha,"
the consul's sister, who has given her
life to good work and has cared for
"Dina." Miss Dorroh was a particu
larly appealing "Agnes Rodman" in
"Men and Women." and also appeared
to advantage in 'The Fortune Hunt
er."
M. Pv. Tedford, '17, who scored as the
elderly "Tyler" in "Ready Money," will
interpret another interesting character
part a? "Vigeland," a Norwegian mer
chant. L. E. Cole, '17, will have a sim
ilar chance to score as "Sandstad."
Cole won praise for a comedy role in
"Men and Women."
Miss Ruth Sampson, '11, and Miss
Ellen Andrews, '18, are cast as "Mrs.
Rummel" and "Mrs. Postmaster Holt,"
two of the "greatest" ladies of the
town.
