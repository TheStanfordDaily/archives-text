# INTERCOLLEGIATE RELATIONS
## 
### 
Four propositions relating to inter
collegiate relations between Califor
nia and Stanford, it was expected,
would be thrashed out by the repre
sentatives of the two intercollegiate
agreement committees (representing
the two universities) when they con
ferred last Saturday night. Instead
the entire situation resolved itself
around one point: The California
members said that it would be useless
to consider any other issues until the
matter of allowing Freshmen to com
pete in varsity contests was settled.
In other words, an ultimatum was
practically delivered by the repre
sentatives of California to the repre
sentatives of Stanford that we would
have to accept their viewpoint, and
abolish Freshman competition in var
sity contests, o.r sever intercollegiate
'relations entirely.
California's principal argument
hinged on the accusation that some
of the first-year students are being
induced through financial offers, or
by other improper means, because of
their athletic ability, to attend Stan
ford, and compete on varsity teams.
When accusations of this nature are
made against an institution's honor
and high standards it is time that the
accusers were made to give convinc
ing proof, or forever hold their peace.
The accusations, which were maae
to the Stanford representatives, were
not only unfounded and unjust, but an
insult to the individuals concerned.
If we were to concede to the de
mands of the University of California,
for the mere sake of maintaining the
athletic relations, it would be ac
knowledging that their accusations
(not .reasons) were well founded. The
question of our honor is at
stake. No alternatives present them
selves. We have but one decision,
and that is that no agreement be en
tered into with California which does
not permit of Freshmen competition
in varsity contests.
California has presented no justi
fiable arguments why this issue
should be included in the intercolle
giate agreement. Her argument, oth
er than the one above stated, which in
reality is no argument, because it is
absolutely false, is that eastern insti
tutions do not permit Freshmen to
compete in varsity contests, and,
therefore, we should not. California
maintains that her teams are handi
capped when they compete against
universities across the Rockies. In
the first, place distance makes regular
athletic relations with eastern col
leges impossible. In the case of track
competition we have sent the star
point-winner back from time to time
and met with favorable results, and
have not been handicapped in the
slightest degree by the fact that wo

allowed Freshmen to compete on the j
varsity team on the coast. The same j
holds true in crew and tennis. There
is no reason why we should meet an
issue that does not pertain directly to
us.
The purpose of athletic competition
is to interest the largest possible
number in the various sports at the
same time that teams are being de
veloped. To cut off Freshmen com
petition from varsity contests means
that less enthusiasm would be invest
ed in athletics than at the present
time. The aim of the Stanford coach
ing system is to keep all the men in
terested in a sport out the entire sea
son and not to cut the squad. In this
way players are developed. Rut if
one year of competition was ruled
out of a player's career in college it
would weaken the sport, and also the
interest manifested by the men. A
team should represent the University;
this would not be the case if Fresh
men were not allowed to compete.
California maintains that scholas
tic standing of Freshmen athletes id I
not satisfactory, if they are allowed
to compete on Varsity teams. The!
scholastic records of the Stanford
Freshmen competing in intercolle-;
giate contests in the past has been
satisfactory to the faculty in the av
erage. If California wants and needs
higher scholastic standards in order i
to maintain a certain degree of effi
ciency along the line of intellectual
pursuits, it is up to her to improve
them. It is not the duty of Stanford
to relieve a situation at California :
which does not exist here.
It has been said that athletes enter !
either California or Stanford, for the
primary purpose of athletics. In other
wo.rds, they come purely to win laur
els in some branch of sport. As a
matter of fact the number of Fresh
men competing on the Stanford rug
by team against California for 1911
and the four years proceeding was
eight. Since rugby was introduced .it
Stanford in 1905 the average number
of Freshmen players who have taken
part in intercollegiate competition
has averaged twn «nd nn©-tonth an
nually. These facts refute the argu
ment.
The main argument of the Califor
nia Agreement Committee rests on
the accusation that we are subsidiz
ing our athletes. No logical argu
ments have been presented by them
which could have been used for rea
soning tlie proposition and reaching
a conclusion. Her attitude is to force
us to accept the proposition, and in
so doing grant her accusations as
true. Stanford's honor is hanging in
the balance. We are desirous of us
ing all fair means in order not to
sever intercollegiate relations, but
that is of slight importance, when we
consider that our honor is at stake.
The sentiment of the Student Body
was emphatically expressed this
morning. We see no reason for bar
ring Freshmen. We cannot accept the
proposition that Freshmen be ruled
from varsity competition under the cir
cumstances.
