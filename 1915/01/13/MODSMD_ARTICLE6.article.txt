Announcement dt' Vote Friday
On account of an agreement with the
California committee the result of this
vote cannot be announced until next
Friday, after an assembly held in
Berkeley to determine the position of
the associated students on the ques
tion. Acting on the instructions re
ce'ved then, the California committee
will meet the Stanford representatives,
guided by the results of this morning's
balloting, Friday evening to continue
negotiations for an athletic agreement
botwecn tho two universities.
A detailed account of the proceed
ings in this morning's assembly are
given below. Every phase of the
luestion was thoroughly discussed.
President A. E. Worthy. 'IT., told of the
proceedings at the meeting of the In
tercollegiate Agreement Committees
on Saturday. He also emphasized the
importance of getting behind the com
mittee in their position, after the votes
of the students told them the stand
to take. Student Adviser S. S. Simon
son, '15. gave the attitude of the Cali
fornia students, following a trip to
Berkeley and a conference with some
Iff the leading men, to get. their view-
I point.
Though the expediency of the rule
and its relative advantage to the uni
versities was touched on in some of
the talks this morning, the main ar
gument rested on the principles in
volved in granting or refusing to
| -rrant the request of the California
S committee.
('resident Worthy Opens Meeting
President Worthy, member of the
committee representing Stanford in
the agreement controversy, said in
onening the meeting. "The Intercolle
giate Agreement Committees met in
San Francisco last Friday night, and
the only thing they agreed to was to
adjourn till next Friday evening. No
snorjpr had the meeting been called to
order, than the president of the Cali
fornia student body said that his com
mittee had been sent there for one
purpose, and until that was carried
out. there was no need of going furth
er with the proceedings. He said:
'Unless our request is granted, we will
have to go back to our student body to
ijet further instructions.' This request
was that Freshmen be eliminated from
all forms of varsity athletic competi
tion. and the question of granting it
is the one before us this morning.
"The arguments which they ad
vanced for the rule were three in num

ber. First, (hat all eastern colleges
have a rule that athletes can com
pete for only three years. Therefore
when California sends her teams
across tlie Rockies, she is handicapped,
because her men who have made var
sity teams In their Freshman year
have only two more years to compete
in the east.
"Secondly, most of the eastern uni
versities have excluded first-year men
from varsity competition, and have
substituted a Freshman game in its
place. They think this is a reason
why we should do the same in the
west. Hut the same conditions do not
exist here. There 's none of the in
tensive prep school dragging; for star
athletes that is to bo found in the
I countrv where tbero are so many more

Whereas, at the meeting of the In
tercolleuliite Agreement Committees
representing tlie University of Califor
nia and Stanford University, held
on Saturday evening, January
the California representatives submit
ted one proposition to the Stanford
representatives, demanding its accept
ance before consideration of other
questions, and
Whereas, this demand, that of th>
elimination of Freshmen from all var
sity competition, rests almost wholly
on tlie supposition that one or both
of the universities are using improper
means to induce men of known athlet
ic ability to enroll as students solely
because of their unusual athletic abili
ty, therefore
He it Hesohed, that the Student
Body of Stanford University is on rec
ord as being strongly in favor of the
J participation of first-year students in
varsity contests. That since the one
reason for the advancement of the
proposition by California, in the opin
ion of this body, is the baseless accu
sation that first-year students are be
ing induced through financial offers or
by other improper means to attend
Stanford because of known athletic
ability.be it also resolved until a proper
showing is made that such a condi
tion exists now or is to be expected to
exist in the near future, the elimina
tion of Freshmen from varsity contests
be indefinitely postponed.. That this
Student Body is on record as haying
| iio belief in the charge of coercion of
first-year athletes in tlie present, or ;>■
its possibility for the future; that it
I denies anything approaching this con-
I ditfon exists, and courts closest iuves
tigitlon of any case that may be cited.
\nil since the scholastic records of
Mt" Freshmen participating in inter
.-•olleuiafe contests in the past have
b'«en satisfactory to the faculty ii?
<N ir average, the argil incut that their
! participation should be barred for
. s"hol istic reasons is ignored as with
out sufficient weight.
Therefore be it resolved that the In
tercollegiate Agreement Committee be
; instructed to enter into no agreement
I with the University of California by
j which Freshmen are prohibited from
| competing on varsity teams in inter
collegiate matches.
And be it further resolved, that in
the absence of such a showing bv
I
I California of the use of improper
| means by Stanford to secure athletes.
| the Stanford representatives on the
j Agreement Committee be instructed to
request an apology from California
! representatives for such charges as
! have been made.

Universities. Without the same con
ditions there is no need for the same
rule.
"The third and most important ar
gument consisted of a charge that
Stanford had been getting Freshmen
by improper means. Have you ever
before heard that charge made against
Stanford from anything that could be
considered an official source?
Stanford Professionalism
"At first they did not make their
charges plain, but our committee com
pelled them to come out in the open
and make direct statements. They
charge that in three or four cases
Stanford has induced Freshmen to
register here by unfair means. We
asked for specific examples, but they
had none. One case of irregularity,
which they contended happened, was
that a Freshman had applied for ad
mission at California and had been
refused, because of insufficient cred
its. lie came down to Stanford. The
Registrar, learning that he was an
athlete of promise, admitted him, in
spite of the deficiency.
"This charge of dishonesty and co
ercion is the one we must meet this
morning. It is a thing we have to
consider in making our answer to
their demand.
"They say further that a great num
ber come to both universities solely
for the purpose of participating in
athletics, and have no interest in
scholastic matters. If a Freshman
exclusion rule were passed, this ele
'/lent wuciltl not tume to oolloffo and
the standard of athletics would be
raised. Tint we know that this element
is very small at Stanford—that there
are practically no cases where this
charge is true.
Equal Effect of Rule
"The committeemen made the state
ment, Saturday evening that the pas
sage of this rule would not effect the
relative strength of the two universi
t'es—that it will apply equally to both,
and give neither any advantage. Rut
a careful investigation refutes this.
This rule will eliminate at least one
fourtb of the men students from com
petition, and California, with her larg
er enrollment, can stand a cut easier
than we can. Three men cannot com
pete against four men with the case
that son uien can oppose 1200 men and
a proportional cut will always work a
hardship on the smaller body.
"Now you have the issue squarely
before you. Will you stand squarely
behind your Agreement Committee, or
will you compromise with California,
and pass tlrs rule?"
President Worthy then called on
Student Adviser S. S. Simonson, '15. to
give the California viewpoint. Simon
son made a trip to Berkeley yesterday
to ascertain the sentiment at the state
institution, in order to report it to the
assembly. Among other people, he
talked with one of the California com
mitteemen. He said: "It seems im
portant to give both sides of the con
troversy. and fair to give the Califor
nia point of view. The sentiment of
the general student body seems hardly
so crystalized on the Freshman elimin
ation question as that expressed by
the Agreement Committee last Satur
day evening. The Freshman question
is the most important of the four prop
ositions which the Associated Stu
dents adopted last December and sub
mitted to us. The general attitude Is
