Announcement dt' Vote Friday
On account of an agreement with the
California committee the result of this
vote cannot be announced until next
Friday, after an assembly held in
Berkeley to determine the position of
the associated students on the ques
tion. Acting on the instructions re
ce'ved then, the California committee
will meet the Stanford representatives,
guided by the results of this morning's
balloting, Friday evening to continue
negotiations for an athletic agreement
botwecn tho two universities.
A detailed account of the proceed
ings in this morning's assembly are
given below. Every phase of the
luestion was thoroughly discussed.
President A. E. Worthy. 'IT., told of the
proceedings at the meeting of the In
tercollegiate Agreement Committees
on Saturday. He also emphasized the
importance of getting behind the com
mittee in their position, after the votes
of the students told them the stand
to take. Student Adviser S. S. Simon
son, '15. gave the attitude of the Cali
fornia students, following a trip to
Berkeley and a conference with some
Iff the leading men, to get. their view-
I point.
Though the expediency of the rule
and its relative advantage to the uni
versities was touched on in some of
the talks this morning, the main ar
gument rested on the principles in
volved in granting or refusing to
| -rrant the request of the California
S committee.
('resident Worthy Opens Meeting
President Worthy, member of the
committee representing Stanford in
the agreement controversy, said in
onening the meeting. "The Intercolle
giate Agreement Committees met in
San Francisco last Friday night, and
the only thing they agreed to was to
adjourn till next Friday evening. No
snorjpr had the meeting been called to
order, than the president of the Cali
fornia student body said that his com
mittee had been sent there for one
purpose, and until that was carried
out. there was no need of going furth
er with the proceedings. He said:
'Unless our request is granted, we will
have to go back to our student body to
ijet further instructions.' This request
was that Freshmen be eliminated from
all forms of varsity athletic competi
tion. and the question of granting it
is the one before us this morning.
"The arguments which they ad
vanced for the rule were three in num

ber. First, (hat all eastern colleges
have a rule that athletes can com
pete for only three years. Therefore
when California sends her teams
across tlie Rockies, she is handicapped,
because her men who have made var
sity teams In their Freshman year
have only two more years to compete
in the east.
"Secondly, most of the eastern uni
versities have excluded first-year men
from varsity competition, and have
substituted a Freshman game in its
place. They think this is a reason
why we should do the same in the
west. Hut the same conditions do not
exist here. There 's none of the in
tensive prep school dragging; for star
athletes that is to bo found in the
I countrv where tbero are so many more

Whereas, at the meeting of the In
tercolleuliite Agreement Committees
representing tlie University of Califor
nia and Stanford University, held
on Saturday evening, January
the California representatives submit
ted one proposition to the Stanford
representatives, demanding its accept
ance before consideration of other
questions, and
Whereas, this demand, that of th>
elimination of Freshmen from all var
sity competition, rests almost wholly
on tlie supposition that one or both
of the universities are using improper
means to induce men of known athlet
ic ability to enroll as students solely
because of their unusual athletic abili
ty, therefore
He it Hesohed, that the Student
Body of Stanford University is on rec
ord as being strongly in favor of the
J participation of first-year students in
varsity contests. That since the one
reason for the advancement of the
proposition by California, in the opin
ion of this body, is the baseless accu
sation that first-year students are be
ing induced through financial offers or
by other improper means to attend
Stanford because of known athletic
ability.be it also resolved until a proper
showing is made that such a condi
tion exists now or is to be expected to
exist in the near future, the elimina
tion of Freshmen from varsity contests
be indefinitely postponed.. That this
Student Body is on record as haying
| iio belief in the charge of coercion of
first-year athletes in tlie present, or ;>■
its possibility for the future; that it
I denies anything approaching this con-
I ditfon exists, and courts closest iuves
tigitlon of any case that may be cited.
\nil since the scholastic records of
Mt" Freshmen participating in inter
.-•olleuiafe contests in the past have
b'«en satisfactory to the faculty ii?
<N ir average, the argil incut that their
! participation should be barred for
. s"hol istic reasons is ignored as with
out sufficient weight.
Therefore be it resolved that the In
tercollegiate Agreement Committee be
; instructed to enter into no agreement
I with the University of California by
j which Freshmen are prohibited from
| competing on varsity teams in inter
collegiate matches.
And be it further resolved, that in
the absence of such a showing bv

Universities. Without the same con
ditions there is no need for the same
rule.
"The third and most important ar
gument consisted of a charge that
Stanford had been getting Freshmen
by improper means. Have you ever
before heard that charge made against
Stanford from anything that could be
considered an official source?
Stanford Professionalism
"At first they did not make their
charges plain, but our committee com
pelled them to come out in the open
and make direct statements. They
charge that in three or four cases
Stanford has induced Freshmen to
register here by unfair means. We
asked for specific examples, but they
had none. One case of irregularity,
which they contended happened, was
that a Freshman had applied for ad
mission at California and had been
refused, because of insufficient cred
its. lie came down to Stanford. The
Registrar, learning that he was an
athlete of promise, admitted him, in
spite of the deficiency.
"This charge of dishonesty and co
ercion is the one we must meet this
morning. It is a thing we have to
consider in making our answer to
their demand.
"They say further that a great num
ber come to both universities solely
for the purpose of participating in
athletics, and have no interest in
scholastic matters. If a Freshman
exclusion rule were passed, this ele
'/lent wuciltl not tume to oolloffo and
the standard of athletics would be
raised. Tint we know that this element
is very small at Stanford—that there
are practically no cases where this
charge is true.
Equal Effect of Rule
"The committeemen made the state
ment, Saturday evening that the pas
sage of this rule would not effect the
relative strength of the two universi
t'es—that it will apply equally to both,
and give neither any advantage. Rut
a careful investigation refutes this.
This rule will eliminate at least one
fourtb of the men students from com
petition, and California, with her larg
er enrollment, can stand a cut easier
than we can. Three men cannot com
pete against four men with the case
that son uien can oppose 1200 men and
a proportional cut will always work a
hardship on the smaller body.
"Now you have the issue squarely
before you. Will you stand squarely
behind your Agreement Committee, or
will you compromise with California,
and pass tlrs rule?"
President Worthy then called on
Student Adviser S. S. Simonson, '15. to
give the California viewpoint. Simon
son made a trip to Berkeley yesterday
to ascertain the sentiment at the state
institution, in order to report it to the
assembly. Among other people, he
talked with one of the California com
mitteemen. He said: "It seems im
portant to give both sides of the con
troversy. and fair to give the Califor
nia point of view. The sentiment of
the general student body seems hardly
so crystalized on the Freshman elimin
ation question as that expressed by
the Agreement Committee last Satur
day evening. The Freshman question
is the most important of the four prop
ositions which the Associated Stu
dents adopted last December and sub
mitted to us. The general attitude Is


President Worthy
that there is no doubt that we will
accept the rule—that it is fair, and we
will accept it.
"The attitude of California students
in this matter is that the rule would
be an ounce of prevention, rather than
a pound of cure. The general stu
dent body is not in a position to know
conditions, because it is so large, or
to form any attitude, but this is the
position of the uppe.r classmen whom
F talked to. leading men who should
be well informed. Without charging
professionalism, even indirectly, they
say that things 'look funny' down here,
and want us to admit that fact. Then
they wish to lessen any chance of
professionalism in the future, by pass
ing this rule.
Question of Eastern Competition
"They think that, the matter of go
ing east of the Rockies is important
When we remember that a year or
two ago they contended that this was
necessary, to obtain good competition,
this is not strange. But they do say
they are going east, and ask Stanford
to assist them by passing this rule, so
putting them on an equal basis with
eastern schools which they will meet.
"Believing that the Freshman .rule
will not fail of passing, they offer the
six-months' rule as another guard
against professionalism. Though they
don't openly charge offering money,
behind it. all the charge exists. Only
in the committee meeting have they
made any open charges.
"They place their demands for both
rules on this ground alone. They do
not touch the scholarship question,
for they must admit that our regula
tions are the most severe.
"We cannot ascertain the attitude
generally of the student body, but that
of the leaders is, that they are offer
'ng lis a fair proposition—a proposi
tion which will prevent future
trouble."
Coach E. P. Campbell then pointed
out the certain results if Stanford ac
ceded to California's demands. "The
only contention of California is on
the basis of coercion. This contention
that Stanford is bringing athletes here
for varsity hono.rs is not only an in
justice to the Stanford Student Body,
but to the individuals concerned as
well. Wild rumors are current which
Stanford should take as rumors, but
this assertion is direct, and is an ab
surdity. I have investigated, and
there is no ruling of the 1. C. A. A.,
the body governing the eastern meets
which California enters, which pre
vents competing' for more than three
years. Freshmen competition does not
affect the ability of the men to com
pote in the east, as California claims.
"Why should a Freshman be kept
out of athletic activities simply be
cause he is a. Freshman? Why should
a student be barred from varsity com
petition, simply because lie has been
out of college for six months? It is

up to the Stanford Student Body to
back up their Intercollegiate Agree
ment Committee, who are in a position
to thoroughly understand conditions."
O. li. Castle, '14, President of the
University Conference, followed by
showing that the question was not one
of expediency, but of right. "We should j
find if tliereis not an important principle
involved," declared Castle. "We learn
at the meeting that there is one thing
that stands out above all others,
namely that California makes grave
charges against the integrity ot our
athletics. I believe that if we accept
their demands we are admitting their
charges. We can't give in, for if we
do so. we are indicting ourselves as
crooks, and our athletes as profes
-1 sionals of the worst sort. It seems to
me that a Stanford man expressed the
situation very consistently the other
day when he declared that if Stanford
should accept California's demands he
couldn't meet a Californian on the
street without wanting to hang his
head. Whatever we decide to do, let's
do it for good, and not come to a de
cision in a spirit of heroics. Let's j
stands by our guns now and all the
way through."
When called upon by President Wor
i thy, P. X. McCloskey, '15, responded
|as follows: "Throughout the history
1 of intercollegiate agreements, Califor
j nia has delivered ultimatums to Stan
! ford, which, during the past, we have
■ been forced to accept. Their represen
! ti'.tives have always assumed this at
j titade —either adopt this one proposi
tion that we uphold, or else we'll have
nothing more to do with Stanford. The
main charge California directs at us.
is the charge, which you all know
there is absolutely no foundation for,
that Stanford is hiring its athletes!
To me no charge more dishonorable
could be made against the men of the
University. One cannot but agree tint
we must admit these false charges,
should we give in to their proposed j
rule barring freshmen from intercol- j
legiate competition. The names of the j
athletes charged with dishonesty have
not been given out, but the list is com
posed of men who have made good
with the Student Body, not because
they are athletes, but on account ot
their characteristics as real men. They
are university and class room favor
ites. We've got to stand by them and
denounce their charges, by refusing
the rule which has its greatest claim
based upon these charges. Instruct
the Intercollegiate Agreement Com- j
mittee to Mgn a resolution not to |
eliminate Freshmen."
The next speaker, F. C. Hamilton,
editor of The Daily Palo Alto, went oil
to point out the apparent weakness I
in the California position. "Califor
nia puts up the argument that Fresh
men come to college merely to make
the Varsity team, and when once they
gained that, they leave. It is an
easy matter to refute such an argu
ment. Tn the past five years eight out j
of a total close to eighty men who i
played on the football team were
Freshmen, averaging two and one
tenth first-year men to a fifteen. ;
Whether or not it be true that those [
Freshmen dropped out from the Uni- [
versity, it is clear what little bearing j
it has on the subject, v hen the facts 1
are known. Secondly, California brings
the accusation upon us that Stanford
subsidizes her athletes. Surely the
honor of both the University and the
men in question is at stake. There re
mains now but one thing for us to do
—to stand by our .Intercollegiate
Agreement Committee, in insisting up
on Freshmen eligibility in varsity ath
letics, and when you have made the
decision, why stick to it."
Crew Captain G. A. Jacomini, '15.
was the next speaker. He said: "I
will simply agree with the sentiments
expressed by McCloskey in this mat
ter. If we back down, and agree to
this proposition, in view of the charges
on which it is made, we will simply be
admitting the indictment. They can't :
prove their statements, there is no |
means of doing it, for they aren't true. !
The only thing we can do is deny j
them. We'd better begin now by re
fusing the rule."
The President then said that one
point had not boon touched on to any
extent. That point was that Stanford
needed the help of the Freshmen, and
that the football and track coaches
had stated to him that they would be
handicapped to a greater extent than
California if Freshmen were elimin
ated.
L. R. Reynolds, '15, basketball cap
tain, declared that if a team is to be
representative it should include the
best men in the University at that time.
"If we bar a Freshman, simply because
he is a Freshman," said Reynolds, "we
are doing an injustice to him as well
as to ourselves. I don't see how we
are going to be able to discriminate."
The crisis was reached in the brief
statement of W. D. Fletcher, '11. "The
one thing we can do is simply to in
struct our committee to demand an
apology from California for her state
ment, or the proof." The sentiment of
the assembled students was forcefully
expressed in enthusiastic applause af
ter this terse suggestion.
Track Captain E. M. Bonnett, '15,
dealt with the more practical side of
the issue, when requested to speak by
President "Worthy, "in such a sport
as track if we bar Freshmen from
varsity competition, it will hurt us
more than any other branch of ath
letics. Last year, with ten first places,
we scored only sixty-six points. Cali
fornia, on the other hand, managed to
take fifty-five points with only four
first places, rt will be impossible to
win any more track meets, in fact we
axe absolutely certain of defeat should
Freshmen be eliminated. With Califor
nia it is different, since by their large
numbers it will not hurt their chances,
permitting them to annex not only
more second and third places, but first
places. Furthermore it is nothing else
than an injustice to the Freshmen, to
bar them f.rom intercollegiate athlet
ics.
Coach Campbell then presented res
olutions which had been drawn up on
the issue—resolutions to reject the
proposition that the Stanford Intercol
legiate Agreement Committee be in
structed to refuse to accede to the de
mand of California for a Freshman
elimination rule. When he sat down,
O. H. Castle offered as an amendment
a further resolution to request an
apology from the California committee,
following Fletcher's suggestion.
President A. E. Worthy then ex
plained briefly the nature of the vot
ing on the Quad —a vote for the reso
lution meaning a vote against the nil
inuj. The un tlio r»ror>o8it**»n be
gan an hour after adjournment, at
11:15, and continued till 2:30 this af
ternoon.
