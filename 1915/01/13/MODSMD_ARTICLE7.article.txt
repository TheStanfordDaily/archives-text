# TENNIS OUTLOOK IS BRIGHTEST IN YEARS
## New Material Is Said to Give Cardinal Slight Advantage Over Blue and Gold Which Will Feel Absence of Davis THIELE CUP IS AT STAKE 
### 
Stanford's tennis outlook this sea
son looms brighter than at any time
during the past three years, and the
local racquet-wielders look to have a
slight edge over their transbay com
petitors.
Only one veteran of last year's in
tercollegiate struggle is missing from
the ranks. F. S. Pratt, '13, is not reg
istered this semester. J. S. Hutchin
son, '16, K. B. Uhls, '16, Captain H, L.
Hahn, '16, and ex-Captain L. Sloss, '15,
will he on hand to represent the Car
dinal.
Stanford's chances of victory are al
so decidedly increased by the pres
ence of the freshman stars of last
year's interscholastic doubles and
singles, who will make a strong bid
for places on the team which will face
California.
California, usually possessing an ad
vantage because of the tennis stars
attracted there by the block letter
awarded for the spring sport, will be
decidedly handicapped this year by
the absence of the redoubtable Davis.
This player's work has been a telling
factor in former California tennis Vic
tories.
This spring the intercollegiate
matches will be played off on Stan
ford ground, for the first time in many
years. This should center more than
usual interest in this major sport
among Stanford minor activities.
The Thiele Cup Tournament, always
played off during Thanksgiving vaca
tion, was postponed from last semes
ter on account of the unfavorable
weather.
Names should be handed at once to
L. Sloss, '15, IC. B. Uhls. '16, or H. C.
Hahn, '16. for the Thiele handicap
matches. The present holder of the
trophy is Tennis Captain Hahn.
