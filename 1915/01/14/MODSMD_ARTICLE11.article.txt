# TRI-STATE TEAMS CHOSEN
## WILL DEBATE WASHINGTON AND OREGON Stanford to Be Represented by Crobeau, English, Fenimore, Fribley, Weston in Schedule of Annual Forensic Contests 
### 
Five men were chosen to represent
Stanford on the Tri-State Debating
Team at try-outs held yesterday af
ternoon in the Chapel. From a field
of twelve contestants M. Crobeau, '18,
H. R. English, '10, G. W. Fenimore,
'17, J. W. Fribley, '10, and C. B. Wes
ton, '15, were selected. These men are
almost new to the debating world of
Stanford. Outside of Weston, who
was a member of the Oregon Tri-State
Team last year, and Crobaugh, who
served as alternate on the Intercolle
giate Team which was defeated by
California last semester, none of them
have appeared in the role of debaters.
From these five men, two will lie
chosen to debate against Washington
University at Washington, and two
will remain here to meet an invading
aggregation from Oregon. The fifth
man will serve as alternate. The date
for the debates has not yet been set
tled.
Owing to the fact that there were
only two freshmen contesting for
places on the Trt.erc.lass Team, try
outs for the Freshman-Sophomore de
bate were postponed until more men
sign up.
