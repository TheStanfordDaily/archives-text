# "Psych" Professor Issues Warning to Indoor Sports
## Admonishes Students to Trust Not to Gain Under the Even Laws of Chance. 
### 
This is a story for matchers, coin
flippers, "crusoe" artists, or any one

who puts perfectly good
faith in mere chance.
This is a warning to
those who believe in
luck, good or bad, and
to those who find great
comfort in gently ex
pectorating on the rus
ty horseshoe and throw-

ing it over their shoulder with closed
eyes.
'! his is a warning from Professor
John Edgar Coover, of the Depart
: '::t cf Psychology, wlio declares that
there is no such thing as pure luck in
i' 'â– ? a. coin, and that "scientific"
matching no more influences results
than does gently murmuring hokus
pokus three times before taking a
:hance.
"When you toss us a coin," said
Professor Coover, "the coin is just as
apt to fall heads as tails. Perhaps af
ter a few trials one will exceed the
)ther. Putin the long run heads
ind tails will break even. Mathemat
ics account for that."
fn common everyday English, it's a
50-50 proposition.
"Wear and tear on dice," said Pro
fessor Coover, "may cause deviations
from mathematical deductions. Put
these deviations will counteract each
othe.r in the long run and consequent
ly have no determining influence in
results obtained."
According to the psychology of
chance, if you want to play safe in
matching and be sure of a square deal
in throwing dice you must repeat each
operation a number of times, say twen
ty or thirty thousand. This will give
chance an opportunity to average up
the variation from the mean that
ire bound to occur, due to varying
conditions.
Professor Coover is now conducting
experiments on the psychology of
chance, using dice, cards, coins, and
other gambler's paraphernalia in
hopes of determining definite doc
trines of the law of chance.
