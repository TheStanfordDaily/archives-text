# PEANUT LEAGUE
## 
### 
The baseball teams in the future de
pend upon the material that is devel
oped during the present generation.
Players of varsity caliber come and
go, and new men must fill the vacant
places. A system has been arranged
this season similar to the one used
last spring to arouse interest in the
sport and to develop varsity players.
As men show ability they will be ad
vanced to the Varsity squad, while
those who do not make good in the
Varsity squad will be delegated to the
peanut league. The varsity repre
sents the major league and the peanut
combination the minor. The peanut
league has been formed to develop
players. Games will be played be
tween teams in the league four times
a week. Batting and fielding aver
ages will be kept and published at
regular intervals. Captain Workman
has made the statement that there a.ve
nine positions open on the team, and
every one will be given a chance to
make good under efficient coaching.
Tt is of the greatest importance that
no player drops out of the league;
the dropping out of several athletes
might mean the entire reorganization
in the personnel of the league. Re
member that the baseball teams of the
present and future depend on you, the
men who signed up for baseball, for
their material. It is up to the em
bryonic players to stay out and help
to preserve the baseball coaching sys
tem.
