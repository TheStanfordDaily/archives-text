# WHERE'S THE HOOK!

### 
Rain is with us again, and lias been
with us for some time. The inclem
ent weather of the winter months ne
cessitates the use of overcoats or um
brellas. When it storms the coats
and hats of the students are more or
loss wet when they enter the class
room. In most of the buildings not
sufficient accommodations are pro
vided where the men and women may
hang the damp garments. The only
alternatives are to sit on them o.r
throw them on the floor. The former
is uncomfortable; and the latter is
not recommended. More hooks are
needed in tlic lecture rooms and halls.
It is only fair to the students that suf
ficient hooks be provided.
