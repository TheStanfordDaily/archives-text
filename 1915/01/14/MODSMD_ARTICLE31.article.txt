Editor The Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: Another word anent
Freshman athletics:
In the east, where teams are re
duced to small, higniy specialized,
game-winning machines as rapidly as
possible, and where competition in
search of new athletic material is so
severe that the "prep-schools" are
"dragged" for promising young ath
letes, —much to the degredation of the
sport and the demoralization of the
entering "Frosh," who would be much
better off If introduced into the time
honored tub and told to "key down,"
than to be catered to for his athletic
prowess—there the exclusion of Fresh
men from intercollegiate athletics may
be justifiable and desirable. In the
west, however, we are not confronted
with conditions which would warrant
such a rilling. We look upon athletics
as a source of recreation and sport
for everyone, as attested to by the
fact that a very large percentage of
our student body indulge in some of
tUo numerous forms of outdoor sport.
In many cases these students have not.
the slightest prospects of eve.r win
ning the fame and publicity of the star
athlete, but indulge just, for the love
of the i;ame, It has long been the
policy of the Stain - Athletic Com
mittees to foster a general love of ath
letic sports in all students. I need
not argue the wisdom of this point,
for it is such a universally accepted
opinion here that a man is a better
man—physically, morally, and often
mentally—for having a fondness of.
and indulging in, some branch of out
door sport. Our teams, too. gain by
this attitude, for it often produces new
material and the enthusiasm of the
spectator and rooter is bound to be
more vital if he actually indulges in
a sport, at times, himself.
Many a boy, on entering college,
does not realize the value of partici
pation in athletics. As a Freshman he
is encouraged by the older men about
him to get his recreation in this way,
and with characteristic freshman sub
missivenesss often starts a habit of
exercising that is seldom abandoned
in college, and generally proves a
source of much pleasure and good to
him. On the other hand, if a student
does not start in his first year he
seldom gets the habit later—his man
ner of living becomes crystalized, he
does not see where he can find the
time (though he often has time for
cards and pool) and he often feels a
timidity about displaying his lack of
familiarity with sports which would
not have embarrassed him as a Fresh
man.
Our Faculty has very properly im
posed upon us a scholastic standard
that makes it impossible for a man
to come here primarily for athletics,
and hence we are not concerned with
fostering an interest in athletics
among those whose abilities have nev
er been tried.
Let us then maintain and encourage
the participation of Freshmen in all
branches of athletics, not only be
cause our friends across the Bay have
issued an ill-advised ultimatum de
manding the contrary; or that it will
increase the efficiency of our team;
but also because, by forming at tn«
start of a college career habits which
promote the physical and moral wel
fare of the student, it brings a greater
amount of good to a greater number
of students.
