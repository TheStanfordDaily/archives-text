Stanford never boasted of maintain
ing a night school, but evening classes
in gymnasium now make such an as
sertion possible. Owing to the crowded
conditions and the impossibility of do
ing outside work, due to the inclem
ent weather, classes in basketball are
now being conducted Tuesday, Wed
nesday, and Thursday evenings.
Three new typewriters have been
purchased by The Daily Palo Alto.
Bette.r machines make for better typ
ing, which ,in turn, will make for
neater and more accurate copy, which
will mean a better paper.
Encina gymnasium attendance is
slightly below that of last semester,
numbering at present about 300. Di
rector Stolz expects to reach at least
the 800 mark upon the completion of
the new gym, at which time the phys
ical training fee will be made compul
sory.
The women members of The Daily
Palo Alto staff have been puton an equal
with mere man. and are now doing
duty in the composing room read
ing p.voof and "working" as printers'
devils. It remains to be seen if the
journalists of the fairer sex are as
rood proof readers as they are mind
readers.
Workmen arc engaged in Memorial
Court removing the concrete founda
tions that have served in the past as
bases for statuary.
The new president of the f.resh
man class is the engineer whose con
structive genirs orected a Campanile
on the Stanford campus in less tnan
one week's time.
