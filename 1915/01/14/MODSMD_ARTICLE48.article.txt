# MATERIAL PROGRESS NOTED IN CAMPUS ADORNMENT PLAN
## 
### 
The work on the old automobile
road is being pushed as .rapidly as thâ– 
weather will permit, but the heavy
rains of the past week have seriously
interfered with the progress of the im
provements.
Ruins of the earthquaked portion.-;
of the museum will soon be entirely
i. leared away.
A high fence, at the base of which
limbing roses have been planted, has
,een built around the construction
yards at the northwest corner of the
Hnive,rsity bindings.
The doors at the entrances of the
'.'hilosophy and Education buildings
have been turned around so ns to open
inwards, in conformity with the other
(b)ors on the inner Quadrangle.
The large buildings of the outer
Quadrangle have doors that open out
wards, but in all but these two of the
inner structures the entries open in
wards.
As a part of the proposed plan for
the "campus beautiful," the sunken
port'ons of the open court at the rear
n? the History building, the Library,
and the Assembly Hall is being filled
in with wagon loads of earth.
In tho past, sections of this court
have suffered from partial inundation
(luring the rainiest of the winter days.
