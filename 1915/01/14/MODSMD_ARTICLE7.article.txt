"Fabian Socialism" is the topic to be
discussed by Miss Nellita Cboate, '17,
at the regular meeting of the Social
ist Club this evening.
Four meetings of this club are held
monthly. At the first a special lec

second a member of the society
speaks. Debating is in order at the
third, and the fourth is a business
meeting.
The "Comrades" are now being
overwhelmed with peculiar and inter

bureaus throughout the country.
