# UNIVERSITY CONFERENCE ELECTS TEMPORARY MEMBERS TO COUNCIL
## THREE VACANCIES FILLED Permanent Appointments Will Follow Admission of New Representatives to Organization 
### 
Three members of tlie Student Coun
cil were elected last night by the Uni
versity Conference to serve only un
til the new representatives are chosen
for that organization. It is believed
that the temporary council could han
dle the business now pending, and,
since the coming election will add
eight members to the Conference,
these men will also be made eligible
for positions on the permanent exec
utive body. The men elected last
night were A. E. Worthy, '15, J. R.
Davis, '15, and R. G. Adams, *14. W. C.
Lynch, '15, was chosen temporary sec
retary of the Conference, pending the
election.
The Council of five members was
elected last September to serve for the
entire year, but with two of last se
mester's organization unable to be on
the Council longe.r and the promotion
of S. S. Simonson, '15, to be Student
Adviser, three vacancies have to be
filled at this time. The three men
elected last night will serve with O. H.
Castle, '14, and C. C. Close, '14, the re
maining members of the old Council,
until after the coming elections to the
Conference. Then successors will be
chosen for them, and a new perma
nent Council organized.
A committee consisting of W. Cr.
Paul, '15, W. C. Lynch, '15, and W. R.
Goddard, 14, was appointed to arrange
for the election. The date will be an
nounced later. As determined at the
meeting the Law Departmnt will fill
four vacancies when it is held, the
Geology Department one, the Civil En
gineering Department one, and the
group of departments consisting of
Graphic Arts, Zoology, Entomology,
Physics, Philosophy, Physiology, and
