# STAND PAT
## 
### 
The Stanford Intercollegiate Agree
ment Committee lias been instructed
by the Student Body to vote "no" this
evening when the proposition is pre
sented by California that Freshmen
be barred from competing on varsity
teams. The entire intercollegiate sit
uation was presented at the Assem
bly on Wednesday morning. The vot
ing was carried out by ballot, and the
results were not known until today.
No one can claim that he was unduly
influenced in casting his vote. You
have given the Agreement Committee
the overwhelming sentiment of the
Student Body to act upon. It is up
to every student to stand back of the
members of the committee in every
thing that they do, and not to criti
cize their actions after the meeting
tonight. You believe that Freshmen
should be allowed to compete in var
sity contests. Stand pat on your con
victions, no matter what the results
may be.
