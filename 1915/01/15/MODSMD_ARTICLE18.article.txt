# SOPHOMORE POLITICS
## 
### 
The Junior annual, while issued un
der the auspices of one class, is dis
tinctly a book belonging to the whole
University. Since any scandal aris
ing in the publication of the Quad in
jures the good name of Stanford, the
Student Body have a right to demand
of the Sophomores that they do not
enter into this matter in a light and
irresponsible manner.
More candidates are running for
the offices of manager and editor than
ever before. As a result considerable
rivalry has arisen for the two coveted
places. Considerable criticism has
been voiced about the campus that the
candidates are using various means
for controlling votes in the Sophomore
class, which may aptly be termed pea
nut politics. Some of the candidates
are trying to work the sympathy of
their class mates, rather than rely en
tirely on their ability.
Cut-throat competition has arisen
between the candidates who live in En
cina and those who make their home
on the ,row. The sympathy method
might be tolerated, but surely not this
unnatural feeling between the Row
and Encina. Happily a condition of
mutual feeling exists between the fra
ternity and non-fraternity men in the
University as a whole. Certain can
didates have tried to overthrow this
feeling among members of the Sopho
more class, in order to further their
own interests, irrespective of the mu
tuality of feeling that has always ex
isted between the Hall and the Row.
This attitude, which has taken hold
of the candidates should lie stamped
out immediately.
r l he Sophomores should consider
the relative ability of the respective
candidates when they cast their vote
next Tuesday, and not allow peanut
politics to influence them one way or
the other.
