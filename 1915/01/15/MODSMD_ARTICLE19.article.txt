Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: Now that the statue oi
Faith has been removed to a less con
spicious site it might not be inappro
priate to recall the history of that
monument. It was made in South
Africa by a German artist, at the order
of a mining magnate of that land. Un
fortunately the patron died before the
statue was completed, and his admin
istrators .refused to acknowledge any
obligation in the matter. The artist
was left with the statue on his hands,
and, dispairing of disposing of it in
South Africa, he brought it to this
country. Arriving in San Francisco,
almost penniless, he tried to find a
purchaser, and Mrs. Stanford's at
tention was called to the matter. At
her request the statue was brought to
Palo Alto for lie.r inspection. She was
pleased with it, bought it, and gave
instructions to have it placed in the
center of the oval. Whatever artistic
value the statue ever possessed was
promptly destroyed by the concrete
base on which it was erected, so that
it is doubtful if one passer-by out of
ten realized that the statue was of
granite, and not concrete.
Although there may he grave ques
tion as to the artistic value of the
statue, there should be no doubt of
the sentiment which prompted its pur
chase and erection. It typified M,rs.
Stanford's faith in the future of this
Universityâ€”and if she had not had
faith it is at least a question if there
would be any University here today.
It is remarkable that the first person
to adequately interpret this was a
visitor from the East, and in Dr. Pea
body's sermon on Mrs. Stanford's me
morial day last year may be found a
striking illusion to the monument.
I trust that this statement may be
considered merely as a matter of rec
ord. and not as a criticism, in the
slightest degree, of the removal of the
statue. In its new location it will find
an appropriate and permanent abode.
ALUMNUS.
