# CREW LOSES PART OF ITS REDWOOD EQUIPMENT
## 
### 
The Stanford crew went to the Red
wood slough,
Upon a winter's day;
When they got there they cried in
despair,
For the float had floated away.
"Oh where! oh where! has the little
float gone?"
They sang in wild dismay,
ft may have passed the Golden Gate
And :s now in Panama Bay.
Crew men who journed to the
Redwood boathonse to arrange for the
first practice of the season, fonnd to
their horror that the float which had
been carried up to the bank for re
pairs had disappeared.
A search was undertaken immedi
ately, as delay would give the float
an oppportunity to slip through tn«
slough and gain access to San Fran
cisco Bay, and continue its journey
to—, well, perhaps even to Japan if
the Japan current was flowing in the
right direction. The 20-horsepower
coaching launch was pressed into ser
vice, but all efforts to locate the tru
ant ended in failure.
Captain Jacomini declares the loss
will not delay crew practice as
February 1 is the date sot for taking
the first eight upon the water. A new
float is now in course of construction
and will be completed in ten days.
