# GLEE CLUB MEMBERSHIP TO BE FURTHER REDUCED
## Old Members Express Willingness to Compete for Positions Against New Candidates. 
### 
Because of the success which the
Glee Club experienced last year as a
result of limiting the numbers in the
organization to twenty-four, and be
cause the subsequent experience indi
cates that a further reduction will
benefit its work, it was decided last
night to further reduce the member
ship to either sixteen or twenty. The
figure will be decided according to
the balancing of the voices to be
found by new try-outs to be conducted
Monday and Tuesday afternoons be
tween 5 and fi o'clock by Professor L.
IT. Eaton in room 84. For the good
of the club, the old members have
consented to try-out on an equal basis
| with new candidates. Few first ten
; ors having returned to college this
: semester, those able to sing this voice
i will have an exceptional opportunity
to make the club. Others are also
i urged to try-out.
The organization is in possession I
J of plenty of music, and active practice ;
for the trip to be taken to Southern
California this spring will begin next
Thursday.
