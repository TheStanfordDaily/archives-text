war who never did before," declared
D.r. Jordan. "It is like a series of
football games. If one side is strong
all the time and the other side gets
even a single goal it will change the
ontire situation. So it is with peace
and war. If the war party gets the
slightest victory, it will flare up im
mediately, and bring those who saw
only peace to their feet.
"We shall have to repair the dam
age done, not only wi Belgium, but in
all of Europe. I do not know wheth
er the present war will change our
policy i u regard to armament, but I
do know it should not change it.
"No, the recent earthquakes will
not influence Italy in regard to its
war policy—the earthquake was large
ly in the farming districts. But T be
lieve Italy will stay out of the war.
Bulgaria and Roumania, however, I
think will go in."
As to the probability of ending the
conflict by international conciliation,
Chancellor Jordan said: "No one can
see far enough ahead to tell anything
about it."
Much of Dr. Jordan's time is being
taken up by his literary and journal
istic work. Through the Philadelphia
Public Ledger he is contributing edi
torials to leading periodicals of the
country. A second edition of "The
Human Harvest" is nearing comple
tion, while "What Europe Thinks of
Us" is being revised for publication
in book form. This volume was writ
ten on the Continent and originally
published in serial form by the
"World's Work." Progress has been
started on a new book, "The Effects
of War on the Breed of the Human
Race." This includes a chapter on
Alsace which. Dr. Jordan declares, is
a delicate subject to write upon, inas
much as no one can forecast the des
tiny of that country.
During Irs stay on the campus
Chancellor Jordan is lecturing in the
Departments of History and Biono
mics. co-operating with Professor V.
L. Kellogg and E. B. Krehbiel in
courses in Heredity and International
Conciliation, respectively.
Dr. Jordan leaves next week for a

Advancing the Cause of International
Peace."
