# ENTERING STUDENTS MAKE RECORD IN ENGLISH TEST
## 
### 
Twenty-eight out of thirty-five
Christmas Freshmen is the unusually
large percentage that made a record
in Stanford by passing in the matricu
lation test in English Composition,
given last Saturday. In the last test
held in September, fifty per cent of
the entering students failed and were
compelled to enter the beginning com
position classes. Lists of the students
who passed the examination Saturday
have been posted outside of the office
of the Registrar.
