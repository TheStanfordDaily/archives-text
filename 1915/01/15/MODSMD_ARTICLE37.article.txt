late this afternoon that the death list
would probably reach 35,000. He de
clared that he considered this a con- j
servative figure, in view of the later j
.reports of the military commanders
in charge of the work of relief. Pa
terrio, three miles from Avezzano, is
declared to li-ive suffered the same fate
as the latter city. Every house and
village here was razed, and mutilated :

en to death when pinned under wreck
age.
ROME, Jan. 15.—Latest estimates
place the list of those killed by the

hundred thousand. The Minister of i
Public Works wired Premier Salandra |
that every city, town, and village in |
the Lira valley has been damaged, i
Hundreds of the injured are streaming |
into Rome. All public buildings have
been turned into hospitals. The offi
cials are most concerned over the con
ditions at Magliano di Marsi, where
the refugees report that 1300 have
been killed :and at Capello where
eiidit hundred are reported to have
been entombed. Albafucense is razed to
the ground. No word has as yet come
from the commander of the troops
sent, out on the relief work.
Many Are Entombed Alive.

Five thousand of the injured have al
ready been placed in the hospitals in
Rome, but every train brings in more.
The King and Cabinet have met to

Lodge, in urging the adoption of the
resolution for an inqury into the mili

"Unarmed, unready, and undefended,
the Tnited States offers a standing in

popular idea, still used for purposes
of oratory, that danger can be met by
springing to arms when the moment
■ comes, is a dream so wild that It
would be grotesque were it not so
i tragic."

age.
