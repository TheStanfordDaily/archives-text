# IRELAND'S STARS ARE VICTORS IN FAST GAME
## CAPTAIN WORKMAN, HAVES AND STEVENS SHOW TO EXCELLENT ADVANTAGE. RARE COMEDY ENLIVENS CONTEST ALTHOUGH OUTHIT INDEPENDENTS EMERGE ON LONG END OF 4 TO 1 SCORE. 
### 
Cliff Ireland and his band of dia
mond satelites took a flying trip down
to the campus Saturday afternoon with
firm intent to annex the scalp of the
Stanford Varsity. Although the inva
sion met with success, since at the
conclusion of the fray the gong rang
four times fo.r the Independents and
only once for the Varsity, nevertheless
Cardinal fans were well pleased with
tho showing of Captain Workman's
nine, who fought the professionals to
a standstill. It was not until the final
inning that Ireland's aggregation had
the game safely laid away on ice, when
they managed to shove two of their
runners across the pan.
Saturday's exhibition was replete,
both with clever plays and humor.
Brigadier-General l.reland introduced
a steady line of natural comedy that
took the bleachers by storm. When
Louis Lowenberg, manager of several
semi-professional clubs in San Fran
cisco, competed for Stanford with the
Independent's leader in a side-line
word-battle. German and Irish wit
flowed in abundance.
Gunner Hayes, who worked tho
full distance on the firing line, showed
a baffling assortment of curves and
twisters to Ireland's brigade, who de
spite their long pedigrees in big league
company, were only able to glean four
hits off his delivery. Skipper Tom
Workman, in four times at the plate,
managed to connect safely on three
separate occasions, being the heaviest
hitter of the day. Stevens, who is fill
ing the shortstop berth vacated by Zeb
Terry, covered his territory in great
style, fielding many hard chances.
Six errors in all were chalked up
against the Varsity, the majority of
which occured at most important
times. The defeat in great measure
may be laid to these boots, since only
one earned run is accredited to the
Independents.
Both sides drew blood in the opening
round. Cohen, first man up for the in
vaders, knocked a long fly to left,
which Noonan d,ropped after a hard
run, the batter going to third on the
error. Dick Egan was safe on a field
er's choice, in an unsuccessful attempt
to catch Cohen off third, McC'loskey
muffing Hayes' throw. Burns, re
nowned slugger ot the Philadelphia
Nationals, fanned. Noonan then re
trieved himself by making a beautiful
catch of Heilman's line drive to left
and an accurate peg to the plate,
which prevented a likely score, on the
throw-in. When Dent shot the ball
high to Stafford in an endeavor to cut
off Egan from stealing second. Cohen
tapped tho pan for the first run of tho
game. Stafford at this point tore a
fingor on his right band stopping
Dent's wide toss, and was .replaced
by Austin. Halinan ended tho inning
by striking out.
Stanford evened up matters in the
last half of the same frame. Pay drew
four wide ones and was sacrificed to
second by Austin. Tom Workman fol
lowed with an infield hit which Gen
eral Ireland could not handle. When
Dent walked the liases became loaded.
Noonan. next batter up, won a host of
friends by slamming out a clean single
between first and second, permitting
Day to register Stanford's only run.
Workman was out off at the plate 'n
an attempt to beat Heilman's perfect
peg. When Umpire Al. Earle called
three strikes 011 McCloskey the inning
was ended.
From the first frame until the sixth,
goose eggs were the order of the day,
although both Stanford and the Inde
pendents got men around as far as
third base on more than one occasion.
In the sixth inning, following Egan's
pop-up to Stevens, Duffy Lewis was
t'iven a pass to first base. Heiiman
made the second out, when O'Neill
caught his long fly to right. Haiinan
likewise was given a free passage to
the initial station, sending Egan to
second. On the next pitched ball, the
former Cincinnati star stole third.
Thereupon llalinan and Egan worked
the double steal, with the result that
Egan beat Austin's throw home by
inches.
Ireland's celebrities tucked the game
away beyond recall In the eighth in
ning. Duffy Lewis again started to
trew trouble by slamming a corking
double to deep left with none down.
Heiiman followed with a bingle to
center, placing Lewis 011 third. The
next two sluggers, Cullen and Kenne
dy, popped out to Austin at second in
rapid succession. Perkins walked,"
fll ing the bases, in an attempt to
catch Lewis asleep off third, Dent
threw low to McCloskey, resulting in
Lewis and Heiiman scoring. In Stan
ford's half of the eighth, Workman was
the only batter to solve Driscoll's de
livery for a hit.

may be laid to these boots, since only
one earned run is accredited to the
Independents.
Both sides drew blood in the opening
round. Cohen, first man up for the in
vaders, knocked a long fly to left,
which Noonan d,ropped after a hard
run, the batter going to third on the
error. Dick Egan was safe on a field
er's choice, in an unsuccessful attempt
to catch Cohen off third, McC'loskey
muffing Hayes' throw. Burns, re
nowned slugger ot the Philadelphia
Nationals, fanned. Noonan then re
trieved himself by making a beautiful
catch of Heilman's line drive to left
and an accurate peg to the plate,
which prevented a likely score, on the
throw-in. When Dent shot the ball
high to Stafford in an endeavor to cut
off Egan from stealing second. Cohen
tapped tho pan for the first run of tho
game. Stafford at this point tore a
fingor on his right band stopping
Dent's wide toss, and was .replaced
by Austin. Halinan ended tho inning
by striking out.
Stanford evened up matters in the
last half of the same frame. Pay drew
four wide ones and was sacrificed to
second by Austin. Tom Workman fol
lowed with an infield hit which Gen
eral Ireland could not handle. When
Dent walked the liases became loaded.
Noonan. next batter up, won a host of
friends by slamming out a clean single
between first and second, permitting
Day to register Stanford's only run.
Workman was out off at the plate 'n
an attempt to beat Heilman's perfect
peg. When Umpire Al. Earle called
three strikes 011 McCloskey the inning
was ended.
From the first frame until the sixth,
goose eggs were the order of the day,
although both Stanford and the Inde
pendents got men around as far as
third base on more than one occasion.
In the sixth inning, following Egan's
pop-up to Stevens, Duffy Lewis was
t'iven a pass to first base. Heiiman
made the second out, when O'Neill
caught his long fly to right. Haiinan
likewise was given a free passage to
the initial station, sending Egan to
second. On the next pitched ball, the
former Cincinnati star stole third.
Thereupon llalinan and Egan worked
the double steal, with the result that
Egan beat Austin's throw home by
inches.
Ireland's celebrities tucked the game
away beyond recall In the eighth in
ning. Duffy Lewis again started to
trew trouble by slamming a corking
double to deep left with none down.
Heiiman followed with a bingle to
center, placing Lewis 011 third. The
next two sluggers, Cullen and Kenne
dy, popped out to Austin at second in
rapid succession. Perkins walked,"
fll ing the bases, in an attempt to
catch Lewis asleep off third, Dent
threw low to McCloskey, resulting in
Lewis and Heiiman scoring. In Stan
ford's half of the eighth, Workman was
the only batter to solve Driscoll's de

Cliff Ireland and his band of dia
mond satelites took a flying trip down
to the campus Saturday afternoon with
firm intent to annex the scalp of the
Stanford Varsity. Although the inva
sion met with success, since at the
conclusion of the fray the gong rang
four times fo.r the Independents and
only once for the Varsity, nevertheless
Cardinal fans were well pleased with
tho showing of Captain Workman's
nine, who fought the professionals to
a standstill. It was not until the final
inning that Ireland's aggregation had
the game safely laid away on ice, when
they managed to shove two of their
runners across the pan.
Saturday's exhibition was replete,
both with clever plays and humor.
Brigadier-General l.reland introduced
a steady line of natural comedy that
took the bleachers by storm. When
Louis Lowenberg, manager of several
semi-professional clubs in San Fran
cisco, competed for Stanford with the
Independent's leader in a side-line
word-battle. German and Irish wit
flowed in abundance.
Gunner Hayes, who worked tho
full distance on the firing line, showed
a baffling assortment of curves and
twisters to Ireland's brigade, who de
spite their long pedigrees in big league
company, were only able to glean four
hits off his delivery. Skipper Tom
Workman, in four times at the plate,
managed to connect safely on three
separate occasions, being the heaviest
hitter of the day. Stevens, who is fill

Terry, covered his territory in great
style, fielding many hard chances.

In the sixth inning, following Egan's
pop-up to Stevens, Duffy Lewis was
t'iven a pass to first base. Heiiman
made the second out, when O'Neill
caught his long fly to right. Haiinan
likewise was given a free passage to
the initial station, sending Egan to
second. On the next pitched ball, the
former Cincinnati star stole third.

the double steal, with the result that
Egan beat Austin's throw home by
inches.

Cliff Ireland and his band of dia
mond satelites took a flying trip down
to the campus Saturday afternoon with
firm intent to annex the scalp of the
Stanford Varsity. Although the inva
sion met with success, since at the
conclusion of the fray the gong rang
four times fo.r the Independents and
only once for the Varsity, nevertheless
Cardinal fans were well pleased with
tho showing of Captain Workman's
nine, who fought the professionals to
a standstill. It was not until the final
inning that Ireland's aggregation had
the game safely laid away on ice, when
they managed to shove two of their
runners across the pan.
Saturday's exhibition was replete,
both with clever plays and humor.
Brigadier-General l.reland introduced
a steady line of natural comedy that
took the bleachers by storm. When
Louis Lowenberg, manager of several
semi-professional clubs in San Fran
cisco, competed for Stanford with the
Independent's leader in a side-line
word-battle. German and Irish wit
flowed in abundance.
Gunner Hayes, who worked tho
full distance on the firing line, showed
a baffling assortment of curves and
twisters to Ireland's brigade, who de
spite their long pedigrees in big league
company, were only able to glean four
hits off his delivery. Skipper Tom
Workman, in four times at the plate,
managed to connect safely on three
separate occasions, being the heaviest
hitter of the day. Stevens, who is fill
ing the shortstop berth vacated by Zeb
Terry, covered his territory in great
style, fielding many hard chances.
Six errors in all were chalked up
against the Varsity, the majority of
which occured at most important
times. The defeat in great measure
may be laid to these boots, since only
one earned run is accredited to the
Independents.
Both sides drew blood in the opening
round. Cohen, first man up for the in
vaders, knocked a long fly to left,
which Noonan d,ropped after a hard
run, the batter going to third on the
error. Dick Egan was safe on a field
er's choice, in an unsuccessful attempt
to catch Cohen off third, McC'loskey
muffing Hayes' throw. Burns, re
nowned slugger ot the Philadelphia
Nationals, fanned. Noonan then re
trieved himself by making a beautiful
catch of Heilman's line drive to left
and an accurate peg to the plate,
which prevented a likely score, on the
throw-in. When Dent shot the ball
high to Stafford in an endeavor to cut
off Egan from stealing second. Cohen
tapped tho pan for the first run of tho
game. Stafford at this point tore a
fingor on his right band stopping
Dent's wide toss, and was .replaced
by Austin. Halinan ended tho inning
by striking out.
Stanford evened up matters in the
last half of the same frame. Pay drew
four wide ones and was sacrificed to
second by Austin. Tom Workman fol
lowed with an infield hit which Gen
eral Ireland could not handle. When
Dent walked the liases became loaded.
Noonan. next batter up, won a host of
friends by slamming out a clean single
between first and second, permitting
Day to register Stanford's only run.
Workman was out off at the plate 'n
an attempt to beat Heilman's perfect
peg. When Umpire Al. Earle called
three strikes 011 McCloskey the inning
was ended.

goose eggs were the order of the day,
