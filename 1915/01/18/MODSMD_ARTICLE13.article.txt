# BRIGHTER OUTLOOK

It was impossible for the Stanford
Agreement Committee to consider an
agreement between Stanford and Cali
fornia prior to Friday evening, due to
the accusations which had been made
or inferred against the Stanford name
and certain individuals in the institu
tion. The Committee could not with
self-respect go ahead until the matter
of the honor of the University had been
cleared up. An antagonistic attitude
had been presented by the California
representatives when the committees
met on Friday evening. The represen
tatives came there with the wish to
straighten things out in order to reach
a basis for calm discussion.
In order to consider the proposition
whether or not Freshmen should be
barred from Varsity contests it was
necessary that an explanation should
be made by the California represen
tatives in regard to the accusations
which had been propounded at the pre
vious meeting of tl.e two Committees.
In perfectly good faith and absolute
sincerity the California representatives
disavowed any inference and accusa
tions which were liable of misunder
standing, which they had made, and re
gretted any insinuations by persons
outside the personnel of the Commit
tee. The California representatives
maintained that they did not for one
minute question the integrity of the
individuals concerned or the honor of
the University. It cleared the honor of
the University absolutely. Stanforo
representatives accepted this explana
tion for what it was worth, and then
stood in a position to straighten out
the intercollegiate situation.
Open-raindedness is essential if in
tercollegiate relations are to be con
tinued. If the opposing Universities
are unwilling to be convinced a dead
lock will ensue. The Agreement Com
mittees are appointed to draw up an
agreement, and will have failed in
their purpose if stubbornness prevails.
The situation is much brighter now
than at any time since the first meet
ing of the Committee, but the horizon
is not absolutely clear by any means.
The statement has been made that
California is on a sound financial foot
ing, and can better afford to sever in
tercollegiate relations than Stanford
can at the present time. It is not our
purpose to consider the relative mer
its of this statement. If California's
attitude is to cut off relations with
Stanford, the sooner the better. It is
useless to argue on the reasons for
and against Freshman competition on
Varsity contests, if this is the under
lying feeling. From the surface it
would seem that the Agreement Com
mittee representing the University of
California is desirous of coming to an
amicable understanding.
Wo hope that each side will be open
to reason, and be willing to meet each
other half way.

stood in a position to straighten out
the intercollegiate situation.
Open-raindedness is essential if in
tercollegiate relations are to be con
tinued. If the opposing Universities
are unwilling to be convinced a dead
lock will ensue. The Agreement Com
mittees are appointed to draw up an
agreement, and will have failed in
their purpose if stubbornness prevails.
The situation is much brighter now
than at any time since the first meet
ing of the Committee, but the horizon
is not absolutely clear by any means.
The statement has been made that
California is on a sound financial foot
ing, and can better afford to sever in
tercollegiate relations than Stanford
can at the present time. It is not our
purpose to consider the relative mer
its of this statement. If California's
attitude is to cut off relations with
Stanford, the sooner the better. It is
useless to argue on the reasons for
and against Freshman competition on
Varsity contests, if this is the under
lying feeling. From the surface it
would seem that the Agreement Com
mittee representing the University of
California is desirous of coming to an
amicable understanding.
Wo hope that each side will be open
to reason, and be willing to meet each
other half way.
