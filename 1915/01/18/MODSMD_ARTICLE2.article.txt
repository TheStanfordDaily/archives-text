## To Save Situation at Stanford by Sale of Slippery Soles. 
### 
Pst! Sh; On the quiet! This is a
mystery story. Pst! Sh! once more:
It's about our women. What, again?
Yes, you guessed it. They're going to
try and raise anothe.r fat lump of gold
dust for the good of the cause; the
caute in this case being Father Ter
psichore.
Believing that there are "tender
foots" among us, the Stanford "500"
have joined the Salvation Army in an
attempt to save our soles, mean
ing the soles on the sons of the
Stanford Red. Wednesday eacli student
will be given opportunity to save
his soles for the mere pittance of 25
cents—if he lias the soles to save. Such
soles can be secured only by purchas
ing the same from a fair miss. Too
much mystery can ruin even a mystery
story, so it is best to divulge a bit of
the great feminine secret. 'Tis this
and nothing more:
2 feet " 4" feet. And 4 square feet
by two young people±good music
and a new dance floor —great expense
bliss! Follow the footsteps on the
Quad.
