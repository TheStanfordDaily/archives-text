PARIS, Jan. 18.â€”Two German as
saults near Autreche, northeast of
Vic-Sur-Aisne, have been repulsed
with heavy loss. The fighting contin
ues, however, and the Germans are en
deavoring to regain a foothold in an
attack upon Crest 263 in the Agronne
district, west of the Meuse. Here they
charged the French trenches, but were
met by a galling artillery fire, which
killed and wounded many. The French
losses were inconsiderable. The al
lies are taking the offensive in the La
Petre woods, to the northwest of Pont
a-Mousson.
