L nited Press Telegraph Report
PARIS, Jan. 18.—France will wel
come the 'Foreign Legion,' which is
now being raised in the country of the
Mikado. It is said that officialdom will
acknowledge this, and it is admitted
that the raising of a volunteer force
of Japanese to aid the allies in France
will solve a knotty problem, in that
the official participation of the island
ers might result in serious complica
tions. Japan might have to be paid
and would be in position to claim much
of the credit for the victory, should
her sons be instrumental in crushing
Germany.
