# CALIFORNIA PUBLICLY DISAVOWS THE CHARGES AGAINST STANFORD
## 
### 
Committee Removes Aspersions on Cardinal
Honor or Individuals' Integrity, Requesting
Rule on Its Merits—Next Conference For
Agreement Will Be Held Friday Evening

The honor of the Stanford name has
been upheld and any aspersions cast
upon individuals in attendance at this
University have been denied as misun
derstandings, by members of the Cali
fornia Agreement Committee. Repre
sentatives of California and Stanford
met in the Palace Hotel, in San Fran
cisco, on Friday evening, with instruc
tions from their respective student
bodies that each should hold firm on
its own viewpoint, California going
so far as to instruct its committee to
break off relations rather than con
cede the point at issue, namely that
Freshmen should be barred from Var
sity contests.
(■irit'l'itlis Presents Statement.
Farnum Griffiths, as spokesman for
the California Committee, presented a
carefully worded statement which had
been prepared, and later passed upon
by the Associated Student Body of the
University of California, to the commit
tees assembled. In this statement, Cal
.fornia based her arguments on three
points: First, for scholarship pur
poses; second .to ward off any corrup
tion or the use of professional methods
in inducing students to attend eithe.r
university; and third, that the insti
tutions should be represented by "gen
unine college students," who came di
rectly from secondary schools. The
statement concluded with the advice
that the California Committee should
insist on Freshmen being barred from
Varsity contests, even to the point ol!
breaking off intercollegiate relations.
Stanford Stands by Honor.
Members of the Stanford Committee
pointed out that it would be useless to
consider the .relative merits of barring
or not barring Freshmen, or consider
ing an agreement with self-respect
until the matter of the accusations and
inferences was cleared. Farnum Grif
fiths again speaking for the California
Committee said: "I withdraw any im
pressions that I made, and certainly
must have been misunderstood. If
the feeling of the students at Stanford
is indicated by the view that we have
cast aspe.rsions on the honor of indi
viduals, members of the Faculty, alum
ni, coaches or any one so far as this
Committee is concerned, we say that
we have been misunderstood. If they
have been made on the outside, we re
gret it. We think that it has largely
been a reading in that these men
should not play as experts, and that
people on the outside had no consid
eration of remuneration.
"I can appreciate that if there is a

I feeling with you or students on the
j basis of accusations in regard to re
j numerations, or if aspersions have
j been cast on the character of students,
| it would be impossible to consider the
I point at issue because your honor
would be involved. The question is
] can we get to the matter on calm dis
j cussion. We are basing our contention
on other ground. If you can consider
the rule, we are ready to make the
statement which shall go to the public
that we (speaking for the California
Intercollegiate Agreement Committee)
j disavow the insinuations and with sne
cific reference we do not for a moment
question the honor or integrity of
Stanford, and are only opposed to the
great worth of the players."
The California Committee expressed
i themselves as being very sorry that a
misunderstanding had arisen, but said
that their disavowal of any accusa
tions was not to be taken as an apolo
gy, because none had been made.
Postpone Discussion.
With the all important matter of tlin
hono.r of the University and of the
students in attendance at Stanford
cleared to the satisfaction of the Stan
ford Committee, the way was clear to
go ahead with the matter of Freshmen
competition in Varsity contests. Since
the Stanford Student Body had voted
in favor of Freshmen competition and
California against Freshman competi
tion the matter of coming to a decision
was certain to end in a deadlock.
California had presented their reasons
as set forth in the statement printed
below why they stood for barring
Freshmen from Varsity contests. The
Stanford Committee then proposed to
set forth their arguments to retain
the same conditions for competition
that have stood for the last twenty
years. The hour was late and Califor
nia preferred to adjourn until next
Friday nisht, when the matter would
be taken up in detail and considered.
The Stanford representatives be
lieved it would be useless to meet
asain, unless the representatives on
both sides of the question were willing
to get down to argument and straight
en the matter out. The Committee ad
journed with the understanding that
they would meet a week later with
open minds and be willing to listen to
reason and arguments.
