# Junior Opera Romance Set in a Japanese Tea Garden
## "At the Dragon's Eye" Selected for 1916 Class Production-Detels, Paul and McInerney, Authors. 
### 
The 1916 Junior Opera, "At the Dra
gon's Eye," was selected yesterday for
production in the Assembly Hall
Thursday evening, March 25, from an
unusually large number of manu
scripts submitted to the committee in
charge. The book and music are the
work of M. P. Detels, '14, and W. G.
Paul, '15. Lyrics are from the pen of
A. .T. Mclnerney, 'If>.
The ope.ra, which pictures a ro
mance in a Japanese garden, is ab
solutely unique in plot and situations
and substitutes for the usual Stanford
background an attractive atmosphere
in which American beauties, geishas,
missionaries of rare charm, and other
delightful creatures vie in winning
approval. The story weaves itself
through incense-laden paths depicting
the transformation of maid to mission
ary and missionary to maid. Excep
tional opportunities will lie afforded
for brilliant effects in scenery and
costuming which will lend the neces
sary pictorial charm.
The music is exceptional in char
acter, mingling the lilt of the modern
song with the characteristic beauty of
the Far East.
Try-outs will be held tomorrow at
the Delta Delta Delta houÂ«e at 1:30,
for both principals and chorus.
