Colorado Club is being organized
on the campus by C. S. Milliken. '16.
and W. F. Noonan, '16. The so
ciety is being formed in order
that the members may keep in closer
touch with the interests of the Colo
rado alumni, that "Coloradans" may
realize the benefits of a Stanford ed
ucation, and that the representatives
of that state on the campus may have
a better acquaintance.
Men students registering from Colo
rado, and those who regard it as
their "home state," are invited to at
tend an informal "get-together" at the
Phi Gamma Delta house Wednesday
evening, at 8:00 o'clock, when furth
er plans will be perfected.
