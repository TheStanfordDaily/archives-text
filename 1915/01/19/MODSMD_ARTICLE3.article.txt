### 
The Santa Clara baseball team will
make its formal bow before Stanford
diamond followers tomorrow after
noon when the Varsity is scheduled to
cross bats with the Missionites in the
first mid-week game of the season.
Last spring Santa Clara claimed the
state intercollegiate title by virtue of
majority of victories over both Stan
ford and California. Since this year's
nine consists largely of veterans a
fast, contest may be anticipated. Call
for the first batter will be made
promptly at, fou.r-fifteeen.
Coach Billy Orr has announced
three changes of interest in the line
up of the Cardinals. Hayes, who has
been pitching rather steadily of late,
will be relieved by Hoever, who will
go the full distance on the mound.
Dent is to assume his accustomed po
sition behind the plate. Skipper Tom
Workman will again assume his du
ties about the initial station. Owing
to the fact that Stafford is kept out of
the game with a torn fincer. Dickie
will start at second base, later being
relieved by Austin. Stevens and Me-
Closkey have been named to bold
down the .respective berths of short
stop and third base.
The outer garden positions are to
remain the same with the exception
of right field, where O'Neill will be
substituted for Downing, who has yet
to be given a chance to show bis abil
ity. The veterans Noon an and Day
are booked to assume the fly-chasers'
duties in left and center fields. Al.
Earle. who has officiated in both of
the preceding games, lias again been
secured to call the balls and strikes.
