# NEW TAXATION LAW BENEFITS STANFORD
## Law Passed at Recent Election Will Exempt All Educational Institutions From Tax 
### 
Stanford University will benefit ma
terially by the new law, which was
passed at the recent election, known
as the amendment to section thirteen
of the state constitution, which ex
empts educational institutions from
taxation.
ft was supposed popularly at the
time of the election that the amend
ment did not affect Stanford, but was
only for the benefit of smaller and
growing colleges of the southern part
of the state. Consequently, little o,r
no effort was made by this University
or its friends to boost the new taxa
tion law. It is said that some people
actually voted against the law. be
cause they supposed that it. would put
Stanford at a disadvantage.
Heretofore, the University property
has been taxed under the provisions
of the law of 1900. which makes the
actual taxation and exemption option
al with the legislature, which can eith
er collect taxes on Stanford property
or let them go. The new amendment
to the section passed in 1900 makes
exemption a requirement.
The section of the amendment, af
fecting the University, .reads: "Sec
tion la. An educational institution
of collegiate grade, within the state of
California, not conducted for profit,
shall hold exempt from taxation its
buildings and equipment, its grounds
on which the buildings are located,
not exceeding one hundred acres, its
securities and incomes used exclu
sively for the purposes of education "
This will free all of the actual
buildings of the University, including
those here and in San Francisco, from
taxes. Up to this time the Quad and
a few other buildings have not been
taxed. The University should have .re
ceived tlie benefit of exemption on a
large part of its otlier property, but
as the law was not mandatory, and
only optional, the change could not be
made. Treasurer Vanderlynn Stow
| will endeavor at once to get the bene
j fit of the change in the nature of the
law.
The oxnet amount of the benef'ts to
bo derived is not yet known, as the
statements of the tax collector of the
state in regard to exemptions has not
been made. An idea of thr> import
ance of the law can be realized when
it is remembered that state taxes last
year on Stanford prosperity amounted
to $4fi.!>94.2r>. A large part of this will
undoubtedly lie kept in the coffers of
the University treasury in the coming
years.
