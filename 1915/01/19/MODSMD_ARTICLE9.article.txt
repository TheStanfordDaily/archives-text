# SQUARE FEET BY THE YARD TO BE OFFERED BY STANFORD QUEENS
## 
### 
Forced Sale For Sale Benefit of
Campus Highsteppers Will Be
Conducted by the Roughitas
of Cap and Gown Wednesday
SINGLE SHARES-TWO BITS
"A square deal in square feet," say
the members of Cap and Gown, who
will have charge of the sale of hun
dreds of angular soles on the Quad
tomorrow. These "square feet" will

go to the public for the small sum of
twenty-five cents, and will insure the
purchaser dancing space on the floor
which is to be putin the Women's
Club.
It is hoped that enough money can
be raised in this manner to pay for
the laying of a dance floor in the
clubhouse, which as the largest on
the campus will do away with the
necessity of holding dances in Paiu
Aito.
Buy square feet and ease your sole,
is the advice of Cap and Gown. To
purchase square feet indicates a level
head. If one square foot is not
enough for you to one-step on, buy
two square feet, and be sure of having
elbow room. Whether you one-step
or two-step, you will want an interest
in the new dance floor. Wednesday
morning will give you your chance to
show an interest. Follow the foot
prints on the Quad.
