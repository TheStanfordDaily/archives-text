# J.A. HANNA IS AWARDED BERWICK PEACE PRIZE
## Graduate Student Secures Judges' Decision "FLANK ATTACK ON WAR" Various Plans Are Offered by Contestants to Terminate Forever War Between the Nations 
### 
J. A. Hanna is winner of the Ed
ward Berwick, Jr., Peace Prize. Such
was the decision of the judges, who
gave him f.rst place among the eight
contestants who spoke in the Chapel
last evening. Hanna is a graduate .if
Dartmouth University, and is at pres
ent acting as corrector in the History
Department of Stanford, working a',
the same time for an advanced degree
in history. He is a former debater at
Dartmouth, and a member of Delta
Sigma Iiho, the international honorary
society of intercollegiate debaters. He
is also a member of Phi Beta Kappa.
The subject of l-Ianna's speech was
"A Flank Attack on War." "Chil
dren." he said, "have always been
prejudiced in favor of war by toys and
books. The whole school system has
been one in which the study of war
has had an altogether too great im
portance given it. National valor has
always been exploited in texts, and
particular stress laid on the military
achievements of our heroes. Hate and
prejudice have been the school of our
children for centuries.
"The character of any society is de
termined by the ideals of the unito
which compose it. So, then, upon the
educational side of the peace move
ment, will depend the attitude of the
nat'on. .Inst, as the cotton gin changed
the history of the Southern States of
America, so will an appreciation of
the importance of industry to a coun
try, imbued by correct education,
change the attitude of children to
ward war.
"Teach the child that other acts
than those done in war may be acts of
he.roism. For, if the cause of peace is
to triumph, we must make not only a
direct attack on war by appealing to
the adult, but also a flank attack,
through appeal to the minds of chil
dren."
W. L. Miller, '17, the first speaker
on the program, took for his theme
"America's Opportunity," which he
said was not to grasp the lead among
the nations of the world subsequent
to the present great war; hut rather
to take advantage of the weakness of
the belligerents and establish Ihe doc
trine of the right of all nations, large
and small, to live in peace. "Ameri
ca's flag is the flag of humanity," he
said, "and in dictating terms of peace,
our duty is to secure the right to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,
for all people."
A. L. Johnson, '16, declared in his
speech on "The Evolutionary Aspects
of International Conciliation," that
law between, as in, nations, will take
the place of trial by battle. "Man's
progress : s the abandonment of war
and the development of law."
'The peace movement failed because
it did not go deep enough," asserted
R. Hirao, 'IG. "The foundation of war
is the inequality of nations, which re
sults in a struggle for betterment
among the weaker. Equal rights and
opportunities must be given to all —
we must have a world protectorate, if
the cause of war is ever to be re
moved.'
A. H. Morosco, '16, said: "The cre
ation of a world-wide economic and in
dustrial dependence among nations,
will secure peace to the universe.
Create a common monetary system
and abolish all tariffs, so that each
nation may develop that for which it
is best suited. Then no nation could
go to war, for each would be depend
ent on the others."
"Render Unto Caesar That Which Is
Caesar's," was the subject chosen by
A. ,T. Hettinger, '16. He placed the
blame of w?r on the system which
birds nations by treaties to fight, and
advocates an avoidance of these en
tangling alliances as a remedy.
E. E. Williams, '17, recommended
the reform of humanity as insurance
against war. By the removal of false
patriotism, and substitution of respect
for international law and arbitration,
peace could be secured, he believes.
A. F. Coyle, '15, the last speaker,
advocated a plan which would have
the sanction of law behind it. "To
have all nations unite in a league of
mutual respect, with a court of one
man from each nation to decide all
questions of dispute, would be a prac
tical solution of the problem," in his
opinion.
The judges were Professors IT. G.
Spaulding and H. C. Brown, and In
structor F. 112, Hill. Professor L. E.
Hassett presided.

The judges were Professors IT. G.
Spaulding and H. C. Brown, and In

Hassett presided.
J. A. Hanna is winner of the Ed
ward Berwick, Jr., Peace Prize. Such
was the decision of the judges, who
gave him f.rst place among the eight
contestants who spoke in the Chapel
last evening. Hanna is a graduate .if
Dartmouth University, and is at pres
ent acting as corrector in the History
Department of Stanford, working a',
the same time for an advanced degree
in history. He is a former debater at
Dartmouth, and a member of Delta
Sigma Iiho, the international honorary
society of intercollegiate debaters. He
is also a member of Phi Beta Kappa.
The subject of l-Ianna's speech was
"A Flank Attack on War." "Chil
dren." he said, "have always been
prejudiced in favor of war by toys and
books. The whole school system has
been one in which the study of war
has had an altogether too great im
portance given it. National valor has
always been exploited in texts, and
particular stress laid on the military
achievements of our heroes. Hate and
prejudice have been the school of our
children for centuries.
"The character of any society is de
termined by the ideals of the unito
which compose it. So, then, upon the
educational side of the peace move
ment, will depend the attitude of the
nat'on. .Inst, as the cotton gin changed
the history of the Southern States of
America, so will an appreciation of
the importance of industry to a coun
try, imbued by correct education,
change the attitude of children to
ward war.
"Teach the child that other acts
than those done in war may be acts of
he.roism. For, if the cause of peace is
to triumph, we must make not only a
direct attack on war by appealing to
the adult, but also a flank attack,
through appeal to the minds of chil
dren."
W. L. Miller, '17, the first speaker
on the program, took for his theme
"America's Opportunity," which he
said was not to grasp the lead among
the nations of the world subsequent
to the present great war; hut rather
to take advantage of the weakness of
the belligerents and establish Ihe doc
trine of the right of all nations, large
and small, to live in peace. "Ameri
ca's flag is the flag of humanity," he
said, "and in dictating terms of peace,
our duty is to secure the right to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,
for all people."
A. L. Johnson, '16, declared in his
speech on "The Evolutionary Aspects
of International Conciliation," that
law between, as in, nations, will take
the place of trial by battle. "Man's
progress : s the abandonment of war
and the development of law."
'The peace movement failed because
it did not go deep enough," asserted
R. Hirao, 'IG. "The foundation of war
is the inequality of nations, which re
sults in a struggle for betterment
among the weaker. Equal rights and
opportunities must be given to all —
we must have a world protectorate, if
the cause of war is ever to be re
moved.'
A. H. Morosco, '16, said: "The cre
ation of a world-wide economic and in
dustrial dependence among nations,
will secure peace to the universe.
Create a common monetary system
and abolish all tariffs, so that each
nation may develop that for which it
is best suited. Then no nation could
go to war, for each would be depend
ent on the others."
"Render Unto Caesar That Which Is
Caesar's," was the subject chosen by
A. ,T. Hettinger, '16. He placed the
blame of w?r on the system which
birds nations by treaties to fight, and
advocates an avoidance of these en
tangling alliances as a remedy.
E. E. Williams, '17, recommended
the reform of humanity as insurance
against war. By the removal of false
patriotism, and substitution of respect
for international law and arbitration,
peace could be secured, he believes.
A. F. Coyle, '15, the last speaker,
advocated a plan which would have
the sanction of law behind it. "To
have all nations unite in a league of
mutual respect, with a court of one
man from each nation to decide all
questions of dispute, would be a prac
tical solution of the problem," in his
opinion.
