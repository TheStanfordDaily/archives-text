### 
J. A. Hanna is winner of the Ed
ward Berwick, Jr., Peace Prize. Such
was the decision of the judges, who
gave him f.rst place among the eight
contestants who spoke in the Chapel
last evening. Hanna is a graduate .if
Dartmouth University, and is at pres
ent acting as corrector in the History
Department of Stanford, working a',
the same time for an advanced degree
in history. He is a former debater at
Dartmouth, and a member of Delta
Sigma Iiho, the international honorary
society of intercollegiate debaters. He
is also a member of Phi Beta Kappa.
The subject of l-Ianna's speech was
"A Flank Attack on War." "Chil
dren." he said, "have always been
prejudiced in favor of war by toys and
books. The whole school system has
been one in which the study of war
has had an altogether too great im
portance given it. National valor has
always been exploited in texts, and
particular stress laid on the military
achievements of our heroes. Hate and
prejudice have been the school of our
children for centuries.
"The character of any society is de
termined by the ideals of the unito
which compose it. So, then, upon the
educational side of the peace move
ment, will depend the attitude of the
nat'on. .Inst, as the cotton gin changed
the history of the Southern States of
America, so will an appreciation of
the importance of industry to a coun
try, imbued by correct education,
change the attitude of children to
ward war.
"Teach the child that other acts
than those done in war may be acts of
he.roism. For, if the cause of peace is
to triumph, we must make not only a
direct attack on war by appealing to
the adult, but also a flank attack,
through appeal to the minds of chil
dren."
