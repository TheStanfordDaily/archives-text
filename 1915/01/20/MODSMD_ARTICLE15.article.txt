# A 						WORTH WHILE PROBLEM

### 
Conference elections for the various
departments are to he held tomorrow
afternoon. Five men are to he selected
from the various departments, and two
to be chosen at a later date, to he ex
act the following Tuesday, from the
Student Body at large.
The functions which the conference
members have to perform are of the
greatest importance. They are the
governing body which makes rules
for students. Not only do they per
form legislative functions, but also
judicial duties. The Conference ad
ministers its own laws. To carry out
the judicial functions a Student Coun
cil is elected from among the members
of the Conference which performs the
duties of a court of justice.
It is of the utmost importance that
men capable of carrying out the du
ties of Conference members be chosen
to represent the students of the vari
ous departments. Membership in the
Conference not only carries with it
honor, but also great responsibility.
In casting your vote tomorrow elect
broad-minded, representative men.
The tendency in the past has been
to take Conference elections in a
lighter vein than is proportional to
the responsibility in balloting. Few
men who are eligible to vote have
made an appearance oft times in the
past at tl'.e ras ; iectivs places of elec
tion. Usually it is necessary to send
out a drag-net to secure the necessary
one-third before an election can take
place. Every one one should feel that
the responsibility lies with himself.
If it is not worth while to take the
trouble to cast a ballot you should
not be represented in the conference.
Give your support to the election in
the various departments and take a
direct interest in the representation.
