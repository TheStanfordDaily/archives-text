# RESULT OF LAST HOLD-UP SHROUDED IN MYSTERY
## 
### 
Members of Cap and Gown refuse
to divulge the amount derived from
the sale of "square feet" on the
Quad today, but say only that it was
large.
The amount needed for laying the
dance floor, also a secret, has not
been reached, and more money must
yet be raised.
