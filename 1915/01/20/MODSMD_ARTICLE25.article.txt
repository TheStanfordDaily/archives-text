# JAPANESE CLUB TO HAVE NEW HOUSE NEAR CAMPUS
## Members Plan to Take More Active Part in University Affairs Hereafter. 
### 
The Japanese Club, whose members
now occupy club rooms on College
Terrace, on the outskirts of Mayfield,
will purchase a house on the campus
in the vicinity of Fraternity Row.
They expect to be installed in their
new quarters when college opens af
ter the summer recess.
The Japanese Club is moving to the
campus with the idea of taking a more
active part in University activities,
and of studying, by means of associa
tion, the indefinable spirit which be
comes a part of all resident students.
A fund with which to purchase the
new' club house has been raised by
subscription from among the mem
bers, and at present approximately
five thousand dollars has been sub
scribed. Japanese associations of
both Northern and Southern Califor
nia are backing their countrymen at
Stanford in the enterprise.
One Japanese was a member of the
class of '95, the first to be graduated
from Stanford, and there have al
ways been Japanese students in the
University. The Japanese Club was
founded in 1901, with fifteen charter
members on the roll. In 1903 the club
purchased the house now occupied for
headquarters. At present the club
members number twenty-five, fifteen
I of whom live at the club house. The
officers of the organization for this
I semester are: E. Esaki, '15, presi
dent; R. Hirao, secretary, and Hirat
suka, treasurer.
