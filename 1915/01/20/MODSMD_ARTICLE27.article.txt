# On the Quiet

Some giant, and not a pigeon-toed
one, made dark and suspicious foot
prints on the Quad during the early
hours this morning.
The Engineering corner was never
a more dangerous place than today,
when Cap and Gown plied the cob
bler's art., and took in men and quar
ters. Many a poor stude sighed soul
fully, and cried, "Sold again!" Those
who were not agile enough to evade
"Roughitas' Corner" were both heeled,
nailed, and sold.
Simple Simon says: The fellow
what sez littul is given credit for
knowin a lot moren he sez. nut the
fellow who talks a hull lot is given
credit fer knowin nothin but what he
sez and littul enuf about that.
