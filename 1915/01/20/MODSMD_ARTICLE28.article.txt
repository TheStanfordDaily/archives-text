"At the last meeting of the Seniors
.Julius Frankenhelmer, manager of
'IHi's Annual, reported on the finances
of the class publication, and formally
turned over to the class $200 â€”profits
of the venture. Of course, Messrs.
Frankenhelmer and W. D. Hri.URS, edi
tor-in-chief, were justly entitled to all
the profits, so their action was one of
voluntary liberality. The class ac
cepted the sum and donated it to the
Hildehrand Library Fund, proving by
this action sin unusually enterprising
class spirit."
