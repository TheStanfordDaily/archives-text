# "Pillars of Society" Cast Is Gaining in Proficiency
## Play Will Be Mounded Out by Skilled Interpretation of Minor Parts. 
### 
Rehearsals of "Pillars of Society,"
Ibsen's powerful modern drama,
which Masquers will stage in the As
sembly Hall Friday evening, February
are being held daily under the di
rection of Coach F. L. Mathieu. The
important roles of this popular play
are unusual, as they are interesting
and they have been cast with especial
care and judgment. Experienced
players whose ability has been tested
in previous performances, and not
found wanting, will interpret the Ib
sen characters with convincing sin
cerity.
The important role of "Aune," the
foreman shipbuilder in the small Nor
wegian seaport, where the action is
centered, has been intrusted to C. M.
Vrang, '14. It would be difficult to
find a part offering better opportuni
ties for effective characterization
than this impressive role. Vrang has
distinguished himself in several im
portant roles on (he local stage,
notably in"The Devil's Disciple,"
"The Admirable Crichton." "The Mir
acle Plays," and "Seven Sisters."
H. C. Soper, 'irÂ», will revel in the
capital comedy part of "Dr. Ror
lund," a sanctimonious schoolmaster,
who assumes control of the morality
of the village. Soper has appeared to
excellent advantage in"The Only
Way," "The Compromise," and"The
Admirable Crichton."
R. L. Johnston, '17, will have an
other chance to display his ability as
"Krap," The Consul's chief clerk.
Johnston scored a decided hit as
"Sydney Robinson" in "Reuly Mon
ey,' the Sophomore comedy, last se
mester.
