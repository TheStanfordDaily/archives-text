# "Pillars of Society" Cast Is Gaining in Proficiency
## Play Will Be Mounded Out by Skilled Interpretation of Minor Parts. 
### 
Rehearsals of "Pillars of Society,"
Ibsen's powerful modern drama,
which Masquers will stage in the As
sembly Hall Friday evening, February
are being held daily under the di
rection of Coach F. L. Mathieu. The
important roles of this popular play
are unusual, as they are interesting
and they have been cast with especial
care and judgment. Experienced
players whose ability has been tested
in previous performances, and not
found wanting, will interpret the Ib
sen characters with convincing sin
cerity.
The important role of "Aune," the
foreman shipbuilder in the small Nor
wegian seaport, where the action is
centered, has been intrusted to C. M.
Vrang, '14. It would be difficult to
find a part offering better opportuni
ties for effective characterization
than this impressive role. Vrang has
distinguished himself in several im
portant roles on (he local stage,
notably in"The Devil's Disciple,"
"The Admirable Crichton." "The Mir
acle Plays," and "Seven Sisters."
H. C. Soper, 'irÂ», will revel in the
capital comedy part of "Dr. Ror
lund," a sanctimonious schoolmaster,
who assumes control of the morality
of the village. Soper has appeared to
excellent advantage in"The Only
Way," "The Compromise," and"The
Admirable Crichton."
R. L. Johnston, '17, will have an
other chance to display his ability as
"Krap," The Consul's chief clerk.
Johnston scored a decided hit as
"Sydney Robinson" in "Reuly Mon
ey,' the Sophomore comedy, last se
mester.
D. K. Ferguson, '18, will portray the
role of "Sandstad," a rugged Norwe
gian merchant, whose association with
"Consul Hernick" in his railway
schemes acts as an important devel
opment of the plot. Although expe
rienced in dramatics, Ferguson la
making his campus debut in this part.
Miss Zetta Mills, '16, will appear as
"Mrs. Doctor Lynge," one of the la
dies of the town, who, as a newcomer
to the little Norwegian seaport, finds
her curiosity unduly excited in the
hints of scandal in the houses of cer
tain "pillars of society."
Richmond Edwards, of Palo Alto,
has been cast as "Olaf," the thirteen
year-old son of the Bernick household,
replacing Thomas Green, who was an
nounced originally for the role. He
is a younger brother of A. R. Edwards,
'14, and Miss Elizabeth Edwards, '16.
Miss Ellen Andrews, '16, who will
play "Mrs. Postmaster Holt," has had
experience in Wellesley dramatic per
formances. while Miss Ruth Sampson,
'11, who is cast as "Mrs. Rummel,"
will be well remembered as the clever
"Tweeny" of "The Admirable Crich
ton."
