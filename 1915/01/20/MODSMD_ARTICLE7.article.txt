# AGREEMENT DISCUSSION IS CENTER OF INTEREST
## Freshman Rule Still Without Favor on Campus SETTLEMENT FORECASTED Both Committees Will Have to Make Concessions at Next Conference to Be Held Friday Evening 
### 
Interest in the intercollegiate agree
ment controversy is still supreme on
the campus, and will undoubtedly con
tinue to be the main topic of discus
sion until after the final settlement
on next Friday evening, at the third
meeting of the committees. That
some final settlement will come at
that time is the opinion expressed
generally by the members of the Stan
ford committee, and others who at
tended the last conference.
Even after the agreement is drawn
up by the Intercollegiate Agreement
Committees representing the two Uni
versities it is not binding until it has
jeen accepted by the students at both
institutions.
Though concessions will have to be
made by both s'.des on Friday even
ing, in order to come to an agreement,
and all diplomacy used by both com
mittees to prevent a split, which 's
probably equally undesirable at both
universities, members of the Stanford
committee have stated that they will
-tand by the instructions given them,
and refuse to accept any agreement
eliminating Freshmen.
At the ineet'ng on Friday evening no
argument was made on the Freshman
proposition. Farnum Griffiths read a
carefully-prepared paper stating the
reasons for California's wanting the
rule, but when this .had been done,
and other matters had been settled,
it was too late to go into detailed dis
cussion of the major point of differ
ence of the committees. The Stanford
committee will answer the California
statement on Friday evening, and give
their arguments for continuing con
ditions of competition as they have
been in the past.
The three reasons expressed by the
California committee for discontinu
ing the use of Freshmen were: FM'st,
for reasons of scholarship; second, to
ward off corruption o.r the use of pro
fessional methods in inducing stu
dents to attend either institution, ft
is explained by the California commit
tee members that this is meant only
to apf)ly to the future, and is not
meant as an inference that such cor
ruption exists now. The third reason
is that, both institutions should be
represented by "genuine college stu
dents," who come directly from sec
ondary schools.
When examined, these arguments
really reduce themselves to two. Any
stud nt in the University is a "genu
ine college student," and the,re can be
no objection to bis play'ng on a var
sity team, whether ho comes directly
from a secondary school or not, pro
vided that he is not induced to come
by professional methods. If the stu
dent who has been out of school for
a while conies to college of his own
free will there can lie no more objec
tion to his playing in his Freshman
year than later in his college career.
So the real argument here, if there 's
one, is that of professionalism.
That no professionalism is believed
to exist was the statement, of the Cal
ifornia committee Friday evening, and
a similar assertion was included in
the .resolution adopted by the Stanford
Student Body. Even assuming tint
here is danger of professionalism in
truding in the near future, the ques
tion is raised if the Freshman Elim
ination Rule be effective to prevent
it. Those who have had experience
with eastern institutions, where such
corruption does exist, say that it is
lot —that dragging the prep schools
'ur their stars goes on at about the
same pace as before. Perhaps the
Freshman rule would be equitable,
though it was pointed out at the As
sembly that even in a proportional
•ut. Stanford, the smaller school,
would suffer more severely, but even
if equitable there is no use of adopt
ing the rule, unless positive argu
ments can be made for it.
The scholarship argument advanced
is that competition for varsity places
takes too much of the time of the
man who is just entering college, and
that it interferes with his success as
a student. In later years, after the
athlete has become accustomed to
college life, the time is not so badly
needed, and can be given without det
riment to classwork. Without quot
ing figures, this fact has been dis
proved at Stanford. An average of two
Freshmen have made the varsity
football team each year, and almost
without exception they have remained
in college after their first year, and
their classwork has been acceptable.
.Most of them have stayed for gradu
ation.
The question of what decisions the
committee will reach on Friday even
ing and what will be the terms of set
tlement is an open one, and will only
be answered after much discussion
by the delegates.
