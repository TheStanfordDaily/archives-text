# ONLY COPY OF OLD PLAY IS RECOVERED
## Descendant of Early California Governors Found Possessing Ancient Manuscript 
### 
A copy of a rare fourteenth century
Spanish Christmas play, the words of
which have been missing for genera
tions', has been recovered by F. Price,
'13, from Jose Manuel Pico, an aged
Tp-m of S.irtp Barbara, who is a direct
(! of the old Spanish line of
governors of that name.
" lie original of this play, which is
considered a classic picce of Spanish
literature, was lost probably about the
time of Patricio Sepulvida, who
brought the original manuscript lo
Santa Barbara from Mexico. Tt is sup
posed that all other copies of this
version have been lost.
"Los Pastores" is a miracle play,
dealing with the birth of Christ ami
telling the story of the three shep
herds that followed the Star of Beth
lehem. This particular play was giv
en in the old Catholic monasteries.
Since the play has been lost, other
versions have been written in Spanish,
but it is supposed that none of them
are equal to the original, fourteenth
century play.
During the Christmas recess, Price
visited the owner of the copy in Santa
Barbara, and wrote out the play, part
of which was given to him already
written, and part of it being repro
duced verbally by the aged Spaniard.
Price intends to edit the play, which
is written in antique Spanish, with
Professor A. M. Espinosa, of the Ro
mantic Languages Department, and
book form.
