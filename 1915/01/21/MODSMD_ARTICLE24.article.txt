Shall Freshmen be allowed to com
pete on Varsity teams, Stanford looks
at the question from an affirmative
viewpoint, while California has set
her foot down in a ve.ry emphatic man
ner by unanimously deciding in favor
of the negative; in fact the student
body has gone so far at the State in
stitution as to instruct the Agreement
Committee to break relations with
Stanford if the Cardinal does not con
cede to her wishes. Some may call
this stubbornness, others call it child
ishness, but in reality it is of a much
deeper significance. California either
does not want intercollegiate relations
with Stanford, and would not allow a
niggardly rule which has not inter
fered with relations in the past, to step
in, especially during the Exposition
year, if she were really desirous of con
tinuing relations. If California is ex
pecting Stanford to call her bluff, in
order to have an excuse to cut off ath
letic relations, she is using a very
smooth, diplomatic attack, when con
sidered on the outside of either insti
tution. If California feels that it is
time to sever relations, why not come
out openly and publicy declare her
stand, instead of using an insignifi
cant rule to hide behind. And it is an
insignificant rule in comparison with
the larger problem of intercollegiate
relations, which is most vital to the
two Universities.
We see no reason why intercollegi
ate relations should be abolished, and
would regret very much any steps i'i
this direction. Stanford has no idea
of breaking off athletic competition
with California, unless it is forced up
on her. But that, does not mean that
the Stanford Agreement Committee, as
•well as the Student Body, is not open
to reason.
It is possible, yes, let us say prob
able, that the committees will come
to a decision on the Freshman eligi
bility question tomorrow evening, and
be able to take up other propositions
toward an amicable settlement. The
Stanford Student Body is in favor of
intercollegiate Freshmen competition,
but the matter is out of the question
for consideration, for the reason that
the Faculty will not permit such com
petition. Stanford favors intercolle
giate second varsity competition, for
the reason that it will be an incen
tive in developing teams and wil] in
crease the interest in athletics.
If California is sincere in the con
tentions of her committee to maintain
intercollegiate relations, then the com
mittee should come there in an attitude
of open-mindedness. The Stanford
Agreement Committee has already ex
pressed itself as being open to argu
ment. Reasons should be weighed
against reasons, and when the debit,
and credit columns are totaled, and the
balance accredited to one side or the

other, it is only right that the |
side should come half way, and pre
pare a tentative agreement, which may
he referred back to the executive com
mittees of the respective student bod
ies for definite action. A compromise
of some sort is necessary if athletic
relations are to continue. The most
broad-minded are the most influential
and powerful in the long run.

of breaking off athletic competition
with California, unless it is forced up
on her. But that, does not mean that
the Stanford Agreement Committee, as
•well as the Student Body, is not open
to reason.
It is possible, yes, let us say prob
able, that the committees will come
to a decision on the Freshman eligi
bility question tomorrow evening, and
be able to take up other propositions
toward an amicable settlement. The
Stanford Student Body is in favor of
intercollegiate Freshmen competition,
but the matter is out of the question
for consideration, for the reason that
the Faculty will not permit such com
petition. Stanford favors intercolle
giate second varsity competition, for
the reason that it will be an incen
tive in developing teams and wil] in
crease the interest in athletics.
If California is sincere in the con
tentions of her committee to maintain
intercollegiate relations, then the com
mittee should come there in an attitude
of open-mindedness. The Stanford
Agreement Committee has already ex
pressed itself as being open to argu
ment. Reasons should be weighed
against reasons, and when the debit,
and credit columns are totaled, and the
balance accredited to one side or the

other, it is only right that the |
side should come half way, and pre
pare a tentative agreement, which may
he referred back to the executive com
mittees of the respective student bod
ies for definite action. A compromise
of some sort is necessary if athletic
relations are to continue. The most
broad-minded are the most influential
and powerful in the long run.
Shall Freshmen be allowed to com
pete on Varsity teams, Stanford looks
at the question from an affirmative
viewpoint, while California has set
her foot down in a ve.ry emphatic man
ner by unanimously deciding in favor
of the negative; in fact the student
body has gone so far at the State in
stitution as to instruct the Agreement
Committee to break relations with
Stanford if the Cardinal does not con
cede to her wishes. Some may call
this stubbornness, others call it child
ishness, but in reality it is of a much
deeper significance. California either
does not want intercollegiate relations
with Stanford, and would not allow a
niggardly rule which has not inter
fered with relations in the past, to step
in, especially during the Exposition
year, if she were really desirous of con
tinuing relations. If California is ex
pecting Stanford to call her bluff, in
order to have an excuse to cut off ath
letic relations, she is using a very
smooth, diplomatic attack, when con
sidered on the outside of either insti
tution. If California feels that it is
time to sever relations, why not come
out openly and publicy declare her
stand, instead of using an insignifi
cant rule to hide behind. And it is an
insignificant rule in comparison with
the larger problem of intercollegiate
relations, which is most vital to the
two Universities.
We see no reason why intercollegi
ate relations should be abolished, and
would regret very much any steps i'i
this direction. Stanford has no idea
of breaking off athletic competition
with California, unless it is forced up
on her. But that, does not mean that
