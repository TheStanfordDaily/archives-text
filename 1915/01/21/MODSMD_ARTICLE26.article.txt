# BURLESQUE SEQUOIA WILL BE CHAPPIE'S NEXT ROLE
## LITERARY MONTHLY PARODIED IN COMIC MONDAY. Humorous Stories, Poems, Articles, and Pertinent Editorials Are Featured. 
### 
Completely disguised in a long, dig
nified kimona, freshly cleaned and
starched. Chappie makes his appear
ance Monday as the "Stanford Squal
ler." The entire issue is a friendly
burlesque on the Sequoia. To get the
proper effect it should lie compared
with the last few issues of the literary
monthly.
The cove.r, the clever work of ,T. A.
Olsen, '15, bears a certain resemblance
to that of the Sequoia, but the shrewd
observer will detect minute, but in
teresting differences.
The feature of the freak and fake
isssue is a complete novelette by E.
Hopkins Ford, editor of the Sequoia,
entitled "Pandora Presumes."
Daniel Under Pond is the author of
an emotional outburst entitled "The
Ultimate." It is an unusual and pro
found poem, and is .regarded by au
thorities as a genuine contribution to
literature. Tt is illustrated by the
clever and versatile, but mysterious
H. A. C., 'Ofi.
"Women's Rugby, a Major Game," is
a dee]) and searching article from the
prolific pen of H. V. C., '05. The essay
is profusely, and even daringly, illus
trated by two different artists not in
cluded on Chappie's staff, nor from his
regular host of contributors.
The regular contributors to the issue
are H. A. Câ€ž 'Ofi, .T. L. Duff. '13. E. H,
Eord, '14, J. Olsen, '15, 11. M. Levy, '16,
H. V. Stewart. *16. R. Wenzel, '16, R. A.
Griffin, '17, J. C. Cross. '17, H. S. Mar
shutz, '17. Lansing Warren, '17, and
R. Donaldson, '17.
