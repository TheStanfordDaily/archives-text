# DIAMOND CHATTER
## 
### 
The Stanford Varsity showed up
like a real ball team in its yesterday's
encounter with Santa Clara. Billy Qrr
has already trained his charges to
take advantage of every opportunity
while on the bases. This was very
evident in the fourth inning, when
three stolen bags were accredited to
the Cardinals.
Ave Howe, veteran pitcher in the
1911 intercollegiate series with Cali
fornia, was out for practice yesterday
afternoon for the first time this sea
son. lie was permitted to perform
only a little warming-up work.
Skipper Workman has been hitting
the ball right on the seam thus far this
season. In eleven times at bat he has
connected safely on six different oc
casions, giving him an average of
.582.
Bill Noonan did the pinch hitting
act in great style in the fourth frame.
With the liases densely populated, he
slammed a double to right, which just
lit inside the foul line, and shoved
three runners across the platter.
Heine Spencer, who called balls and
strikes in yesterday's encounter with
the Missionites, is well-known to cam
pus fans, since he has been a member
of Ireland's Independents for several
years.
Owing to the fact that The Daily
Palo Alto goes to press as early as
possible, the box score of yesterday's
game was omitted from its columns to
pave time. Below an account of the
game is given in detail:
