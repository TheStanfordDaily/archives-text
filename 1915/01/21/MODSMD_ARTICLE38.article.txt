"The second greatest living man in
the world today, in my opinion, is
David Starr Jordan," declared Dean
W. Smith, of Sibley College, in a
lecture befo.re the students of Cor
nel 1 College recently.
Dean Smith said that he based Dr.
Jordan's greatness on high ideals and
unselfish motives. He placed Andrew

nf Cornell University, as first among
men of the world, because the former
had been one of the pioneers in car
rying out the ideals for which Dr.
Jordan stands.
In speaking of D.r. Jordan, who
Dean Smith considered "the greatest
anostle of universal peace," the lat
ter told of how the Chancellor of
Stanford worked himself to the po
rtion of head of the University of In
diana, and was recommended by Dr.

White to Mr. and Mrs. Stanford, when
they wished to found this university,
to build the new institution to a col
lege of the front rank.
