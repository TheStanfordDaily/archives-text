A Stanford track suit has often
caused consternation to our friends
across the Bay, but only recently have
they restorted to the protection of the
law.
An ex-track man from Stanford, tak

brevity of his pants. This does not
mean hp was having heart failure.
She called in her f.riend, who. in turn,
called in more friends. A small riot
was started and a policeman notified.
