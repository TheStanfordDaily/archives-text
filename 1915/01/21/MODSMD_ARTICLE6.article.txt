That the telephone is human enough

Department of Psychology, who hopes
to prove his belief that much of what
we understand over the 'phone is not
heard, but imagined. This, Profes
sor Coover believes, is due to the pe
culiarly of the telephone diaphragm,
which on account of its construction
does not catch and transmit all the vi
brations that strike it. Experiments
arc being conducted in the Psycholo
gy department with the transmission
of unusual combinations of vowels
and consonants over the telephone,
over the dictaphone, through ai.r at a
distance of 75 feet, and through a
partition.
Professor Coover calls these con
versations. experiments in sound as
similation. and is gathering material
for the publication of a pamphlet up
on the subject. About 20,000 tests
have already been made to determine
with what letters substitutions must
be made by the human imagination '.n
order to understand what is said.
