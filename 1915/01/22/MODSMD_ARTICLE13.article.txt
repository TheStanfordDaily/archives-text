# OUR PRIVILEGE
## 
### 
It is so stated in the charter of the
University that the Church shall be an
integral part of the University. It
was the wish of the Founders that the
religious side of the student's life
should not be neglected. And with
this in view the Memorial Church was
constructed as a place of worship for
the students and Facultyâ€”a testimoni
al of beauty and quiet, which inspires
reverence in all who enter. The atmos
phere is real and not imaginative; it
affects all alike; and he who pretends
to be insensible to it is insincere.
The Church is non-sectarian and
non-denominational, it is a place
where believers in all creeds will feel
at home; a place for non-believers as
well as believers; a place for saints
as well as sinners.
The Memorial Church is an under
graduate affair. A student choir fur
nishes the music. Sunday morning is
the only time during the entire week
that the members of the Student Body
may assemble together on a common
ground with a common interest.
Chaplain Gardiner has arranged
from time to time to bring the most
eloquent speakers to the University
for the Sunday morning service. We
are very fortunate at this time to have
Bishop Gailor, of Tennessee, as resi
dent preacher for the next six w r eeks.
The way we can show our appreciation
to Chaplain Gardiner, and also to
Bishop Gailor, is to give him a warm
reception each Sunday morning by
attending the Memorial Church, and
taking some one with us. It matters
not whether we believe in the doc
trines set forth by the preacher. The
big thing is that we hear another per
son's viewpoint.
Let us not consider this a duty, but
rather our privilege.
