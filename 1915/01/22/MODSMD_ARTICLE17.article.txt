# REMINISCENCES

### 
The following letter was written by
Miss Bertha Berner to Mrs. P. J. Treat,
president of the Women's Club. Better
than any explanation it gives her rea
sons for granting the pictures which
were distributed today to certain cant
pus organizations.
As the letter explains, the writer was
for many years Mrs. Stanford's secre
tary, and as such came into contact
with the family as probably no other
individual has done. Her reminiscen
ces are unique and invaluable to the
University for this reason.
This letter, showing a part of her
association with the Founders, is pub
lished with her consent. It bears the
date of December o, and was sent from
her home, Monte Verde:
It is thirty years ago today since I
began my work as secretary to Mrs.
Stanford. While together we always
celebrated this day, and I have contin
ued to do so. Therefore, my thoughts
are of her, and I cannot but think how
pleased she would have been to have
witnessed the splendid effort made by
the men and women of the University
to erect their Club Houses, for these
will tend towards having the reunions
of students held on the campus, in
stead of elsewhere, which was the hope
of the Founders.
When an invitation was given me to
become a member, I was most grateful
for the opportunity, for it is my only
remaining connection with Stanford,
and I beg to be permitted to do a little to
wards beautifying the Club House and
expressing my friendship for the stu
dents.
I have had a copy made of the only
address Mrs. Stanford ever made to
her girls. She often referred to the
pleasure the occasion had given her,
and hoped to have other opportunities
for addressing both the girls and boys.
She frequently entertained herself by
choosing the subjects upon which to
speak and framing her sentences. But
this address remains the only one she
ever made to the girls, and I hope you
will give it a place on the walls of the
Club House, so that Mrs. Stanford's
words may be remembered by the girls
she loved so well.
The accompanying picture of Mr.
and Mrs. Stanford was taken at the
time of their marriage, when she was
twenty-two years old and he was twen
ty-eight. To the last he enjoyed teas
ing her by claiming to have had his
arm around her when the picture was
taken, and she never failed to deny it
and say, "The idea, as if T would have
allowed it!" "Well," he would say,"
look closely and you can see my
hand!" But she would not look.
The picture of the three generations
of Stanfords shows the Founder of
Stanford as a younger man than in his
last and best-known photographs. This
was taken in the year 1882. and Mrs.
Stanford claimed it showed Mr. Stan
ford at his best. I would like to offer
this to the Stanford Union.
To the men of Enclna I send the pic
ture of a building which impressed Mr.
Stanford the moment he saw it, as be
ing to a marked degree like the build
ing he had in his mind for the boys'
dormitory.
In 1888, Mr. Stanford was ordered
to Europe by his doctors with the hope
of improving his health, which was
very poor. The Kissingen cure relieved
him somewhat, but left him very weak,
and he was ordered to the high Alps
for the after-cure. It was a cold sum
mer, and too cold for him in bis weak
ened condition, and he was very low
spirited, fearing he would not get well
again. Tie deplored this because the
University buildings were under con
struction, and he feared the burden of
eare and responsibility would be too
great for Mrs. Stanford, and he was
most anxious to at least see the boys'
dormitory well under way. He spoke
of this many times. Of all the build
ings on the campus, he wanted to see
the boys' hall well built in every re
spect, comfortable and attractive. An
experience he bad as a boy, when seek
ing a higher education, made a deep
and lasting impression on his mind,
and he intended to save his boys a
similar experience. He earned the
money he would require to go to col
i lege by chopping cord wood for his
\ father, and hauling it to Albany. He
finally loft home, carrying his clothes
in a bundle, and walked most of the
way, ia order not to draw too heavily
upon his savintrs. He reached his
school one day at dusk, very tired, but
when he was shown the place he was
to occupy he found it so far below
what he could reasonably have expect
ed that he l'elt he could not remain so,
tired as he was, he left at once. His
next choice was Cazenovia Seminary,
where he entered as a student.
Mrs. Stanford, realizing that Mr.
Stanford was not gaining strength as
he should, and was suffering f.rom the
cold, decided to leave against the ad
vice of the doctor. We quietly en
gaged a carriage, heated with hot
stones, muffled the governor in furs,
and drove off, leaving the servants to
settle accounts and follow with ,the
luggage. We no sooner got into mild
er weather than Mr. Stanford began to
feel better, and by the time we reached
the valley and Silver Plana Lake he
was decidedly improved. We had ou.r
carriage opened, began to discard furs,
and he brightened up perceptibly. As
we were descending toward the lake,
Mr. Stanford said: "I may see boys'
hall built after all," and then re
marked, "I do believe down there by
the lake I see a hotel very much on
the order of the building 1 have pic
tured in my mind as a suitable one for
the boys' dormitory. We must ex
amine it closely." As the diligence
rolled briskly down the winding road
to the valley we could see below us.
ever more clearly, an attractive resort
by the water's edge.
On reaching there, Mr. Stanford
asked for the director at once, and ex
plained why he would like to look over
the building, and all together we made
a tour of inspection. Mr. Stanford was
very favorably impressed, and dictated
a letter to the architect, enclosing a
pencil drawing of the plan of the build
ing, on which he wrote many sugges
tions.
Mr. and Mrs. Stanford were so
thankful that he was beginning to feel
better that they ordered a good din
ner to be served to a number of peo
ple we had seen standing at the kitch
en entrance to the hotel with baskets
and hampers who were selling poultry,
vegetables, anri fruits. I think there
were five women and three men. While
they were eating, Mrs. Stanford had me
talk to them and explain how sick Mr.
Stanford had been, but was now feel
ing better, and hoped to erect a build
ing in California something like their
hotel. They could not ask questions
fast enough. After their meal they
fourd out. whe.re Mr. and Mrs. Stan
ford were seated and stood below the
nearest window and sang several
sonps for them.
Soon after dinner we were ready to
continue on our way. as fresh horses
were awaiting us at this point. Tt had
been a delightful break in Ihe long
day's journey. M.r. Stanford stopped
to speak to the director in the vesti
bule, and Mrs. Stanford and T were
looking at a showcase full of articles

I made of Italian silver filigree, and she
[ bought me a little box. As the Gover
nor turned he noticed a "nickle in the
I slot" machine, such as could be seen
Ji most hotels in Switzerland that.year,
and he said: "1 wondpr what is the
reason Bertha passps this by." as he
j had often seen me patronize them. Ho
handed me some coins, which I put 'n
the slot, and the two views of the hotel
came out! I said I wished I had not
mailed our letter and could enclose
these pictures instead of the pencil (
i sketch, but the Governor said: "Take
the pictures home, and some day show ;
the hoys where we got the idea for the
plan of their hall."
