Stanford, Jan. 22, 1915.
Dear Ma, —This is serious. It looks
II ke a big time in the old town tomorrow
night. The Intercollegiate Disagree
ment Committee is to meet at the
Peace Palace in 'Frisco and decide
whether or not the Stanford committee
s more stubborn than California's. Ycu
see, 111 a. it was this way. Cal. objects
to letting men who are experts or who
have international reputations enter
college and mix in during their Fresh
men year. It's pretty hard saying, I
figure, just when a man is an expert,
or if he lias an international reputa
tion like Kaiser Wilhelm or Sam Mc-
Donald. Cal. agrees with me, so they
want to keep all Freshmen out of ath
letics —a preventative measure, they
call it. There may be something in
that, and believe me, ma, I'd like to go
pj .nam Jnaq pun
admit it if they were right, but if they
were wrong I'd tell them so, and stand
patternell. If they agree to disagree
tonight Cal. and Stanford will get a
divorce until they kissnmakeup. The
co-respondent in this case. I figure, is
our old friend, Miss Understanding.
She's always poking her finger into
other folk's pie and raising trouble.
They're still raising money on the
campus for the poverty-stricken Bel
gians. Yesterday a girl's sewing club
sold caps and gowns by the square
foot. They tried to sell some to the
fellows, too. I don't see what we men
students want with caps and gowns, do
you? I didn't buy any. I am econo
mizing all I can. Remember me to
father, who, I suppose, is busy also.
Much love. SONNY.
S. P. —I have decided that college is
full of politics. We have an election
or a re-election daily.
