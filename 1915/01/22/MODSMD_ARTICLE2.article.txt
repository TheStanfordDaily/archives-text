# STANFORD-OLYMPIC FINALS IN BASKETBALL SERIES TO BE PLAYED TONIGHT
## Game With Clubmen Is Predicted to Be Hardest of Pro-Intercollegiate Mathches. 
### 
Stanford's basketball team will mix
in the final clash of the preliminary
series tomorrow night at eight o'clock,
when-Enc'na Gym is invaded by the
whirlwind Olympic Club quintet.
This will undoubtedly be the hardest
game for the Cardinal basket-tossers
up to the opening of the .regular inter
collegiate schedule, one week hence,
as the Olympic Club squad of last year
was considered the star aggregation of
the state by many followers of the in
door sport.
Just how the Olympics of today com
pare with the players of last season
remains to be seen, but it is said that
the addition of two new "finds'' has
strengthened the team wonderfully;
consequently, the Stanfordites expect
a keen fight tomorrow.
The home aggregation, too, will be
playing the first game of the year with
the squad complete, as "Bob" Worthy
who has been out of previous contests,
because of duties with the Intercolle
giate Agreement Committee, will be
back at forward's position with Blod
get. Davidson and McMahon will be the
forward substitutes.
On the defence, spectators will have
opportunity to see Captain Reynolds
in action with Dolan and Caughey,
two new additions to the team. Dutton
and Wallace will be on hand at center
to pull down the tall ones. According
to Captain Reynolds, every man on the
squad w'll be given an opportunity to
show his ability during the evening.
Arrangements are being made by
the management to accommodate a
large number of students comfortably.
Chairs and bleachers will be erected
along the side of the court and in the
balcony.
