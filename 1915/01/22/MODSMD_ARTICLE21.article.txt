# GLEE CLUB MAY VISIT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
## EIGHTEEN MEMBERS SELECTED AS REPRESENTATIVES. Two Practices Will Be Held Weekly Under Direction of Professor Eaton. 
### 
After three days of rigid try-outs
eighteen men have been selected as
competent to represent Stanford in the
south this spring. This is the smallest
number that the organization has ever
considered as representative, but the
experience of the last year, when the
club was limited to twenty-four, and
the .results shown by other clubs of
even smaller numbers, has led the
members to favor the reduction. An
improvement in harmony and finish is
expected.
A business meeting was held last
night to fill offices made vacant by
the try-outs. F. E. Keast, '10, was
elected manager and K. Uhls, '10, was
chosen to serve on the executive com
mittee.
A trip to Southern California has
been planned for some time, and the
new management will immediately
make the necessary engagements.
The club will start work immediate
ly with two practices a week, and be
fore the date of the trip this number
may be increased.
Professor L. H .Eaton will act as di
rector.

tenors, A. S. Otis, gr., W. C. Lynch,
