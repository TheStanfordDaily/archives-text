# NEW SHELL FOR VARSITY REACHES REDWOOD SIDING
## All Crew Candidates Are Working Out Dailyâ€”Boathouse Repairs Nearing Completion. 
### 
The new racing shell recently pur
chased for the varsity crew arrived
at Redwood this morning, having ne
gotiated the journey from New Jersey
to California in week's less time than
expected. The new shell was shipped
by express, but Graduate Manager
Wilcox did not look for it to arrive
before February first.
Stanford now has the finest racing
shell on the Pacific coast, one which
combines the best material and the
most skilled workmanship available in
this country, and it will be used 'n
the annual intercollegiate regatta
with Washington and California.
Work on the new float will now be
rushed to completion, the repairs on
the boathouse being finished, and oth
er facilities for accommodating the
crew squad made ready for immediate
use. The daily trips to Redwood for
practice on the estuary will probably
begin the last of next week.
Candidates for both the varsity and
freshman crews are working out ev
ery afternoon, regardless of the weath
er. Captain .Tacomini and several
varsity veterans, who a.re assisting
him, are taking the first-year men out
on the lake by squads, and giving them
their first instruction in the boat.
