years old and Mrs. Stanford twenty
two, and is exceedingly interesting in
showing the Founders in their early
days. The address is shown in old
style color-letters, in a large frame,
and will be a beautiful as well as in-
I valuable addition to the walls of the
clubhouse.
i All of the pictures were sent to
Mrs. P. J. Treat, '07, president of the
Women's Club, and are being distrib
uted by her. The gifts to the Women's
Club were formally accepted last ev
ening by the Hoard of Directors.
Miss Berner sends two prints of the
hotel on Lake Silver Plana, near the
borders of Switzerland, from which
Senator Stanford gained his original
idea for the plans of Encina Hall.
That the men's dormitory re
ceived much of Senator Stan
ford's attention is asserted in Miss
Berner's letter. Two views are given
of the hotel, and the resemblance to
the Stanford building is strikingly
noticeable.
Stanford Union receives photographs
of the three generations of the Stan
ford family. Senator Stanford's fath
er, the Senator, and Leland Stanford,
Jr., framed together. The photograph
of Senator Stanford was taken in 1882,
and Mrs. Stanford always thought that
it showed the Senator at his best.
Miss Berner states that the building
of the Stanford Union and the Women's
Club House are enterprizes which
would have pleased the Founders very
much, since it carries out their ideas
of having all student activities center
on the campus. For this reason Miss
Berner has shown much interest in
the buildings. Last fall she was ex
tended a life membership in the Wo
men's Club.
The talk, a copy of which is present
ed to the Club, was the only one which
Mrs. Stanford ever made to her girls,
as she liked to call the University wo
men. The occasion was in 1903. All
the girls were invited to the old resi
dence on the estate. It was during the
afternoon that she expressed the few
words to them. Mrs. P. J. Treat, now
president of the Women's Club, was a
student in the University at that time,
and was among those who heard Mrs.
Stanford.
