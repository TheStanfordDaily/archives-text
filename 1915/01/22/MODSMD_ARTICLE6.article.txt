# RECORDS NOT YET BROKEN, BUT WILL BE WHEN SOUNDED

### 
It is nr> unusual thing for new rec
ords to lie made by Stanford athletes.
It is only lately that two members of
the victorious rugby team have broken
into the limelight as phonographic
stars, and have recorded an absolutely
unique and heretofore unsurpassed
.record, as a mark to be striven at by
future generations of the Cardinal.
One has heard of track record*,
baseball records, crew records, foot
ball records and scholarship records,
but has any one heard the latest Kdi
son record, featuring James Thomas
Wylie, in a Mori love song, and Daninl
Hrendam Carroll in a Dr. Cook mono
logue. This is the great original rec
ord.
