# SCHEDULED MEETING OF INTERCOLLEGIATE COMMITTEE DEFERRED
## California Telephones Request That Conference Be Postponed Until Saturday Evening. 
### 
The conference of the Intercollegi
ate Committee, scheduled for this ev
ening in San Francisco, has been
postponed until tomorrow. President
A. E. Worthy, '15, received a telephone
call this morning requesting a change
in date, and hence the meeting was
deferred one day to accommodate the
California committee. The conference
will lie held at the Palace Hotel.
Other mooted questions will arise at
this meeting, though the problem of
eliminating Freshmen is undoubtedly
the most serious. This will probably
lie settled first before any of the oth
ers are approached. Othe.r differences
are over the question of an intercolle
giate Freshman game, and the six
months' rule. The Stanford Executive
Committee has passed resolutions fa
voring the Freshman game, and a
vote on the question by the Student
Rody resulted almost unanimously i:i
favoring t. California also wants the
game, but an agreement to have the
contest is prevented by the opposition
of the Stanford Faculty. Unless the
Stanford committee can secure the
consent of the Faculty there is no
probability of the game being played.
The .request for the six months' rule
comes from California as a further
means of stopping the professionalism
that does not exist. The rule, if
adopted, will prevent any athlete from
competing in intercollegiate contests
who has not been in college for at
least six months before the event.
This would prevent students from at
tending college only one semester of
the year, while their favorite sport
was on the calendar, and being absent
for the othe,r semester. If such a prac
tice existed, and the students regis
tered only to compete in varsity ath
letics, the rule would be a good one.
In the absence of such a custom, the
rule when it works against any stu
dent will only serve to cut down the
total available material for selecting
varsity teams, and as such has noth
ing in its favor.
