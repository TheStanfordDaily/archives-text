# RELICS OF STANFORD FOUNDERS PRESENTED TO ORGANIZATIONS
## Miss Berner Sends Pictures to Encina Hall, Women' Club House and Union INTERESTING ASSOCIATIONS 
### 
Three interesting pictures and a
copy of the only talk Mrs. Stanford ev
er made to the women of the Univer
sity have just been presented to cam
pus organizations, the gift of Miss Ber
tha Herner, Mrs. Stanford's secretary.
Miss Herner was Mrs. Stanford's
secretary for mo.re than twenty years.
She began her work with the Found
ers on December 5, 1884, and was with
them through the work of planning
and founding the University. She con
tinued with Mrs. Stanford until the
latter's death in 1905. She now lives
at Monte Verde cottage, a half mile
beyond Koble bridge.
She was undoubtedly more closely
associated with the Founders than
any other individual, and her stories of
them are most amusing. Some of her
reminiscences, together with her rea
sons for giving the pictures, are told
in a letter published this evening in
another part of the paper.
A photograph of Senator and Mrs.
Stanford, just after they were married,
and the copy of the only talk Mrs.
Stanford ever made to the women of
the University were sent to the Wo
