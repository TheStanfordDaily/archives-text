# SENSATIONAL NINTH INNING RALLY WINS GAME FOR STANFORD
## Heavy Stickwork Downs San Jose All-Star Aggregation by 3 to 2 Score HOEVER PITCHES GOOD BALL 
### 
A sensational ninth inning rally,
brought to a close when Stevens
singled sharply through second send
ing two runners scurrying across the
plate, secured a hard-fought victory
for the Stanford Varsity over the re
doubtable San Jose All-Star nine and
permitted a host of rabid fans to
journey home Saturday afternoon in a
contented frame of mind. At the con
clusion of tiie mofct exciting game wit
nessed this season on the local dia
mond, the score board showed the
Cardinals leading 3 to 2. The second
team made the day's play a clean
sweep by administering a 1 to 0 shut
out to the Palo Alto high school nine
in the morning.
Stars a plenty were in evidence
among both line-ups during the after
noon engagement. Hoever, who went
the full distance on the mound, held
the highly-touted professionals at his
mercy in all except one inning, the
third. During the last six frames not
one of the opposition managed to ad
vanced past second base.
Captain Workman, Dent, and Mc-
Closkey had their eyes closely focused
on the ball, since each one of the trio
lined out a pair of bingles. Austin
performed the fielding attraction of
the day in the eighth round, when,he
scooped up Coultrin's hot drive for a
clever assist. The visiting shortstop,
Coultrin, starred both at the bat and
in the field, being one of the main
stays of the All-Stars.
Stanford broke through the ice in
the opening frame. Austin reached
third on Workman's single and crossed
the home plate on Dent's long sacri
fice fly.
The Garden City aggregation man
aged to break into the run column in
the third inning, in ;r?.'ch Coultrin and
Goldenson both managed to reach
home on Heilman's hit to center.
From this point in the game until
the last half of the ninth inning,
neither team was able to force a run
ner across the plate. Noonan, howev
er, inspired a little hope in the hearts
of the Stanford supporters by singling
through the pitcher's box, with none
down. McCloskev followed with a tap
to Goldenson at second, who fielded
the ball so slowly that both McCloskey
and Noonan reached first and second
in safety. O'Neill then performed the
proper thing by sacrificing each of
his team-mates another notch nearer
home. With two strikes on Stevens
and no balls, the Stanford shortstop
put an end to the game when he deliv
ered the timely clout through second,
bringing Noonan and McCloskey home
with the tying and winning runs.
The morning game was void of fea
tures. with the exception of Hurley's
pitching and the fielding and hitting
of Green. Palo Alto's third baseman.
Neither side scored a. run until the
sixth inning, when Henzel. for the Sec
ond Varsity, registered the only tally
of the game, following a hit, a fielder's
choice and a passed ball. Hurley
forced thirteen of the high school play
ers to walk the plank via the strike-out
route. The contest was called at the
end of the seventh inning:
Following is the box score of the

San .lose All-Stars.

A sensational ninth inning rally,
brought to a close when Stevens
singled sharply through second send
ing two runners scurrying across the
plate, secured a hard-fought victory
for the Stanford Varsity over the re
doubtable San Jose All-Star nine and
permitted a host of rabid fans to
journey home Saturday afternoon in a
contented frame of mind. At the con
clusion of tiie mofct exciting game wit
nessed this season on the local dia
mond, the score board showed the
Cardinals leading 3 to 2. The second
team made the day's play a clean
sweep by administering a 1 to 0 shut
out to the Palo Alto high school nine
in the morning.
Stars a plenty were in evidence
among both line-ups during the after
noon engagement. Hoever, who went
the full distance on the mound, held
the highly-touted professionals at his
mercy in all except one inning, the
third. During the last six frames not
one of the opposition managed to ad
vanced past second base.
Captain Workman, Dent, and Mc-
Closkey had their eyes closely focused
on the ball, since each one of the trio
lined out a pair of bingles. Austin
performed the fielding attraction of
the day in the eighth round, when,he
scooped up Coultrin's hot drive for a
clever assist. The visiting shortstop,
Coultrin, starred both at the bat and
in the field, being one of the main
stays of the All-Stars.
Stanford broke through the ice in
the opening frame. Austin reached
third on Workman's single and crossed
the home plate on Dent's long sacri
fice fly.
The Garden City aggregation man
aged to break into the run column in
the third inning, in ;r?.'ch Coultrin and
Goldenson both managed to reach
home on Heilman's hit to center.
From this point in the game until
the last half of the ninth inning,
neither team was able to force a run
ner across the plate. Noonan, howev
er, inspired a little hope in the hearts
of the Stanford supporters by singling
through the pitcher's box, with none
down. McCloskev followed with a tap
to Goldenson at second, who fielded
the ball so slowly that both McCloskey
and Noonan reached first and second
in safety. O'Neill then performed the
proper thing by sacrificing each of
his team-mates another notch nearer
home. With two strikes on Stevens
and no balls, the Stanford shortstop
put an end to the game when he deliv
ered the timely clout through second,
bringing Noonan and McCloskey home
with the tying and winning runs.
The morning game was void of fea
tures. with the exception of Hurley's
pitching and the fielding and hitting
of Green. Palo Alto's third baseman.
Neither side scored a. run until the
sixth inning, when Henzel. for the Sec
ond Varsity, registered the only tally
of the game, following a hit, a fielder's
choice and a passed ball. Hurley
forced thirteen of the high school play
ers to walk the plank via the strike-out
route. The contest was called at the

Goldenson both managed to reach
home on Heilman's hit to center.
From this point in the game until
the last half of the ninth inning,
neither team was able to force a run
ner across the plate. Noonan, howev
er, inspired a little hope in the hearts
of the Stanford supporters by singling
through the pitcher's box, with none
down. McCloskev followed with a tap
to Goldenson at second, who fielded
the ball so slowly that both McCloskey
and Noonan reached first and second
in safety. O'Neill then performed the
proper thing by sacrificing each of
his team-mates another notch nearer
home. With two strikes on Stevens
and no balls, the Stanford shortstop
put an end to the game when he deliv
ered the timely clout through second,
bringing Noonan and McCloskey home
with the tying and winning runs.
The morning game was void of fea
tures. with the exception of Hurley's
pitching and the fielding and hitting
of Green. Palo Alto's third baseman.
Neither side scored a. run until the
sixth inning, when Henzel. for the Sec
ond Varsity, registered the only tally
of the game, following a hit, a fielder's
choice and a passed ball. Hurley
forced thirteen of the high school play
ers to walk the plank via the strike-out
route. The contest was called at the

A sensational ninth inning rally,
brought to a close when Stevens
singled sharply through second send
ing two runners scurrying across the
plate, secured a hard-fought victory
for the Stanford Varsity over the re
doubtable San Jose All-Star nine and
permitted a host of rabid fans to
journey home Saturday afternoon in a
contented frame of mind. At the con
clusion of tiie mofct exciting game wit
nessed this season on the local dia
mond, the score board showed the
Cardinals leading 3 to 2. The second
team made the day's play a clean
sweep by administering a 1 to 0 shut
out to the Palo Alto high school nine
in the morning.
Stars a plenty were in evidence
among both line-ups during the after
noon engagement. Hoever, who went
the full distance on the mound, held
the highly-touted professionals at his
mercy in all except one inning, the
third. During the last six frames not
one of the opposition managed to ad
vanced past second base.
Captain Workman, Dent, and Mc-
Closkey had their eyes closely focused
on the ball, since each one of the trio
lined out a pair of bingles. Austin
performed the fielding attraction of
the day in the eighth round, when,he
scooped up Coultrin's hot drive for a
clever assist. The visiting shortstop,
Coultrin, starred both at the bat and
in the field, being one of the main
stays of the All-Stars.
Stanford broke through the ice in
the opening frame. Austin reached
third on Workman's single and crossed
the home plate on Dent's long sacri
fice fly.
The Garden City aggregation man
aged to break into the run column in
the third inning, in ;r?.'ch Coultrin and
Goldenson both managed to reach
home on Heilman's hit to center.
