# UPON FURTHER ANALYSIS
## 
### 
On first glance at the Graduate Man
ager's report it would appear that
the finances of the Student Body show
a flourishing condition, with a balance
being in excess of assets over liabili
ties, amounting to $31,997.45. On sec
ond consideration we find that the fi
nances present not more than a nor
mal condition. It is true that the re
ceipts from the Big Game were larger
than usual, and that the total balance
is slightly more than at a correspond
ing time a year ago. Hut we must also
take into consideration that the Grad
uate Manager is paving a way for the
erection 01 a stadium in the next few
years, the cost of which will have to
be met in the long run by the Student
liody.
