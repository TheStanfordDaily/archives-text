# SERMON CONTRASTS VISIONS OF YOUTH AND DREAMS OF AGE
## Bishop Gailor Makes Plea for Unselfishness and Faith in Ideals of Life. 
### 
The Right Reverend Thomas F.
(Jailor, bishop of Tennessee, preached
the first of his series of five sermons
in the Memorial Church yesterday. He
took as his text "Your old men shall
dream dreams, your young men shall
see visions," and noted the difference
between youth and age in that the con
fidence and hopefulness of the one are
|to be distinguished from the sober
wisdom of the other. Age delights in
memory, loves to recount scenes of the
| past, and regrets the failure to seize
opportunities.
In applying the text to everyday
life. Bishop Gailor said in part:
"The first lesson of youth is self
control: the first message is obedience.
Dreams are not always visions, for
dreams are involuntary and concern
the past, but visions are full of action
and lead to the future. Thorp are no
old men and old women in the world
! except those who have broken their
ideals. The capacity of vision is the
certificate of youth."
In concluding his sermon. Bishop
Gailor said:
"Let us all try to have a vision and
pray God to give us enthusiasm ro
save our country from a generation of
misers. Better be a failure than be a
success with a soul of selfishness; let
us have a vision which will take our
thoughts from ourselves."
