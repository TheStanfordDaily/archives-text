## After Even Playing in Opening Period Olympic Team Shoots Goals in Rapid Succession. 
### 
"The All-Star Exposition Five," rep
resenting the Olympic Club, of San
Franc'sco, romped away with a forty
five to twenty-two victory over the
Stanford basketball team in Encina
Gymnasium Saturday night.
During the first half, the honors
were very evenly divided. The game
progressed with a snap that made it
one of the most entertaining exhibi
tions of basketball seen by Stanford
fans for some time. First scoring was
done by the Olympics, who rolled up
six points on fouls. Then the Stan
ford squad recovered itself, and
from that time on the score columns
grew neck and neck until the end of
the half, when they stond thirteen to
twelve in favor of the Olympics.
In the second half the Cardinals
failed to get a lead, while the Olympics
raced away with the play. The home
squad was at a loss for teamwork,
and basket-shooting. Dutton and Da
vidson were putin to save the day to
ward the e'id of the half, but the spurt
that followed their entrance was not
strong enough to reverse the result.
The contest was characterized by a
large amount of rough playing.
Dolan, Freshman guard, won his
way into the hearts of the two hundred
fans present with his timely plays and
hard fighting. McMahon, for Stan
ford, and Kemp, for the clubmen, were
the stars at forward work. The ab
sence of "Bob" Worthy as forward
was a serious handicap to the Cardin
al?. Worthy was unable to enter the
'rame, owing to the change of date for
th<> meeting of the Agreement Commit
tee.
Sixteen fouls were called on the
Stanford quintet by Referee "Ric"
Templeton, and five on the "All-Stars."
The game was the last of the prac
tice series for the Stanford squad.
Coach Reynolds will give the players
the final polish during the present
week, to get them in shape for the first
Intercollegiate contest, which will be
played with the College of the Pacific.
The line-up follows:
Stanford —Blodget. McMahon. David
son. forwards: Wallace, Dutton, cen
ter; Dolan. Reynolds, Caughey, guards.
Olympics—Kemp. Stadfelt, F. Gil
bert. forwards; G. Gilbert, center; Mil
