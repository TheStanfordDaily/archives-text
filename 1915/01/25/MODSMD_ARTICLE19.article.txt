# Stitt Wilson Explains His Socialistic Convictions
## Large Encina Audience Is Impressed by Striking Personality of Visiting Speaker. 
### 
"The Convictions of a Socialist"
were explained by .1. Stitt Wilson,
former mayor of Berkeley, to a large
assemblage of men yesterday evening,
at the third Encina meeting held this
semester, under the auspices of the
Stanford Y.M. C. A.
"My socialistic convictions are the
average convictions of the average So
cialist,' was one of Mr. Wilson's intro
ductory statements. He told of com
ing to the city from the farm, where
he had spent the early years of his life
and of being shocked by the miserable
economic and social conditions which
he witnessed there. He became pos
sessed with the moral conviction that
these conditions should be improved.
While a Freshman in Northwestern
University lie discovered that he was
a Socialist in belief. Until that time
he had not known the meaning of the
word.
His more striking remarks were:
"There is land, machinery, and labor
enough, if organized with scientific
or even approximate efficiency, to
amply provide for everybody. This
would abolish poverty."
"You can't sit too long on wrong,
or it will blow you up, and take you
with it."
Afterwards, when asked about the
causes and the abolition of the war.
Wilson took issue with Dr. Jordan, lie
claimed that war could not be prevent
ed merely by international disarma
ment, but that the world must first be
organized economically so that the in
terests of one unit should not conflict
with those of any of the others.
