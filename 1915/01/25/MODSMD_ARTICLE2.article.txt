# CLUB HOUSES ANNOUNCE OPENING DATE
## Informal House-Warming of Women's and Stanford Union Buildings Will Be Held on Evening of Saturday, February 6th 
### 
Stanford Union and the Women's
Club House will be open Saturday ev
en'ns February 6. Such was the de
cision of the directors of the institu
tions at their separate meetings on
Friday, and on that evening the two
new buildings, really monuments to
the Stanford spirit, will be thrown
open to receive the students, Faculty,
and members of the alumni of the Uni
versity.
C. K. Field, '95, will be in charge of
the evening at the Union. Though in
formality will Jie the keynote of the
occasion, and its nature will be that
of a house-warming and get-together,
with no formal program, talks will be
heard from some of the men instru
mental in making the Union a reality.
They are President J. C. Branner,
Chancellor D. S. Jordan, Professor C.
D. Marx, v'ce-president of the Union,
and its acting president during
the absence of H. C. Hoover,
and C. K. Field. Assistant Professor
F. W. Smith, '99, is chairman of the
committee and has secured Mr. Field
to take charge of the evening. The
presence of this prominent alumnus
will add greatly to its success.
Stiiiif Men Procured.
During the course of the opening
night well-known stunt men of the
present and past generations will put
on some of their acts. When the build
ing is opened it will be for one thing,
a place to which the alumni can come
back, where the students can gather
and intermingle among themselves
and the alumni. The opening night
will be such an intermingling on per
haps a larger scale.
The opening should mark the begin
ning of a new order of things, or at
least a return to an old order, which
has partially disappeared. As ex
vvessed by Mr. Hoover, the Union will
do its greatest work for the campus by
renewing the old Stanford spirit of de
mocracy, and recreating the old inti
macy between the students and the
faculty of the University. In 1909,
when this remark was made, such a
renewal was considered to be more
necessary than now, but the relations
between the two elements still lacks
much of the good fellowship which
ma.rked the earlier days of the Uni
versity.
During most of the period in which
the affairs of the Union were being

organized, and during the last year,
when the building troubles have been
great, Mr. Hoover has been compelled
to stay in the East or Europe, and in
this period all of the executive duties
have fallen to Professor C. D. Marx.
For the fact that it will be possible to
open the Union a week from Saturday,
the students owe much gratitude to
"Daddy" Marx, who ever since the id 3a
of the Union was first considered has
been one of its heartiest supporters.
The women, opening their building
on the same night, will join with
the men in contributing to the pro
gram, but their interest will be pri
marily centered in their own Club
House. Some work still remains be
fore ihis structure will be completed,
but most or all of it will be accom
plished before February G. The danc
ing floor still remains to be laid. Af
ter considering all kinds of wood for
the floor, the women have decided on
birch, and the work of laying it will
begin as soon as the material can be
obtained. It has been deeded that
much of the furniture will be in wick
erware, and it will also be installed
as soon as possible.
It is certain that the Union will be
practically completely furnished on
the opening night. All the seven bed
rooms on the top floor will be ready
for any of the alumni who may wish
to remain over night.
Interesting furnishings have been
loaned by the Board of Trustees of the
University for the reading and writ
ing room. They consist of the set
of dining room furniture from the old
Stanford residence on the estate. A
large table and a score of black wal
nut chairs will be installed immedi
ately. The furniture is the property
of the University, and has been in
storage for years, but will in the fu
ture be a permanent asset in the
Union.
The constitution, which was submit
ted to the Trustees of the Union in
December,was adopted by them at their
meeting on Friday. It will be printed
tomorrow. The main article provides
for a Governing Board, as a standing
committee of the Board of Trustees,
which will be in absolute control of
the building. This board is to consist
of the student adviser, four students,
selected by the Executive Committee,

an alumnus selected by the Advisory
Board of the Alumni Association, and
a Faculty member, appointed by the
President of the University.
Students Will Control Building.
Even from the student adviser,
the student representation will com
pose the majority of this board, and
therefore be in control of the build
ing. Tremendous responsibility will
rest on this Governing Board, and es
pecially on the student members. The
permanent secretary of the Union, E.
W. Smith, '99, has communicated with
the President regarding the organiza
tions whose duty it is to elect mem
bers to the Board. The members will
be appointed immediately and given
control as soon as the Board is or
ganized.
A brief account of the organization
and building of both the Stanford
| Union and the Women's Club House
j is appended below:
History of the Women's Club House.
As far back as fifteen years ago
a Stanford Women's Club House was
an ideal. At that time, the need of
such a building was much discussed
by Faculty women and alumni, until
in 1902 a movement was started un
der the Women's League. Nothing
was definitely accomplished for sev
eral years, however, until finally it
was decided to take all responsibility
from the league, and to form a defi
nite clubhouse committee.
With Mrs. P. J. Treat, '07, as presi
dent, circular letters were sent out to
all alumnae, explaining the movement,
I and soliciting co-operation.
At that time the plan was to build
a small rustic bungalow, and designs
were drawn by Professor A. B. Clark,
of the Art department. But, as the
campus community grew, the greater
usefulness of a la.rger and more cen
trally situated building became evi
dent. It was, therefore, decided to
build in the Mission style of architec
ture, with the stories of reinforced
concrete.
In the first floor are located the
kitchen, dining room, dressing and
locker rooms, two or three rooms
which for the present will be used as
sleeping quarters, the office and com
mittee rooms; on the second, a social
| hall and on the third, quarters for
visiting students.
With Mrs. H. C. Hoover's gift of
$1000 as an impetus, every opportunity
was used to swell the fund. Life mem
berships of twenty-five dollars were
sold, and informal money-making jinks
were given by student organizations.
Cap and Gown Swell Fund.
One of the aims of Cap and Gown.
1 as stated in its constitution, is to help
build a clubhouse for women, and, to
i fulfill this object, the organization
: gave two Pre-Panama Expositions in
January of 1913 and 1914. In addition,
1 Cap and Gown is rais'ng the money to
pay for the dance floor of 35,001 square
feet, this work not being included in
the routine of the regular clubhouse
committee.
Although the exact furnishing of the
building has not been decided upon,
there are tentative plans fo.r using
wicker.
The completion of the Club House
meets the urgent need of a meeting
places for undergraduates, Faculty
members, and alumnae.
ft has been called the "One great
enterprise of Stanford women." and
will help tfiem to realize that they
have an active part in the affairs of
the University community.
The Story of the Union.
11. C. Hoover, '95, first suggested the
idea of the Stanford Union. He gave
the first money toward the project,
and it is largely through him that it
will take its place as a factor in Stan
ford life. Since the movement to raise
money for the Union was started, the
fund has grown steadily, much of the
money coming from the alumni.
The actual conception of the pres
ent Union dates back to February 20,
1909, when Mr. Hoover organized an
association to promote the project.
The following officers were elected:
H. C. Hoover, president; C. D. Marx,
vice-president; A. E. Rcth, '09. record
ing secretary; It. W. Barrett, '04, per
manent secretary; E. D. Adams, G. E.
Crothers, '95, R. L. Wilson, C. K. Field,
'95, G. A. Ditz, '11, and J. E. Shelton,
'10, trustees. A check for $1,000 was
given by Mr. Hoover to cover tempor
ary expenses, and to serve as the nu
cleus of the estimated sum of $50,000
necessary for the erection of the
structure.
With this definite start the proposi
tion progressed .rapidly. Hoover and
his associates immediately pledged
$10,000, and by the energy of the or
ganizers a large fund was subscribed,
to be paid within two years.
Student Body Assures Support.
The support of the Student Body
was assured at a meeting held on Feb
ruary 25, 1910. At that time student
subscriptions amounted to $14,900, be
sides that pledged by the alumni.
The wo.rk of collecting continued
during the next year. In September,
1912, Mr. Hoover returned from a long
sojourn in London on business. It
was then decided to rush the work of
the Union to a speedy finish. On Sep
tember 11 arj Assembly was held, at
which Mr. Hoover addressed the Stu
dent Body. At that time it was decid
ed to start plans to build immediately
with the money which was contained
in the bank and that secured by stu
dent pledges. This fund amounted o
about $35,000. The contract was final
ly let to Monson Bros., contracting
engineers in San Francisco, for $32,370
The furnishings will have to be paid
for in addition to this sum.
Ground Broken.
Ground was broken for the Union
and the Club House on Thursday, De
cember 6, 1912. A building committee
was appointed immediately, consisting
of F. H. Fowler, '06, chairman. Profes
sor C. I). Marx, Professor C. B. Wing,
and Dr. R. L. Wilbur, '96. The work
has since been carried on under their
direction. Much credit is due the com
mittee and its chairman particularly
for their work during the period of
building. A great deal of trouble has
been encountered which delayed for a
long time the completion of the struc
ture. Work was discontinued last
summer, following a disagreement

with the contractors. The case was
finally set before a board of arbitra
tion, who decided practically all of the
disputed points in favor of the Union,
and work was resumed again.
During much of the period of con
struction H. C. Hoover has been absent
in Europe, and all of the executive
work of the Union has been carried
on by Vice-President C. I). Marx.
Governing Constitution Adopted.
In December a special committee,
consisting of Dr. R. L. Wilbur, '96. E.
W. Smith, '99, A. W. Ambrose, '13, E.
C. Behrens. '14, W. S. Burns, '14, and
S. S. Simonson, '15, drew up a consti
tution providing for the government
of the Stanford Union. This was sub
mitted to the Board of Trustees and
adopted by them, practically as sub
mitted. on Saturday.
The personnel of the trustees has
changed in part since the organiza
tion. It now consists of H. C. Hoover,
president; Professor C.D.Marx, vice
president ;A. E. Roth, '09, recording
secretary; Professor E. D. Adams. G.
E. Crothers, '95, R. L. Wilbur, '96, R.
W. Barrett, '04, A. E. Worthy, '15, and
D. B. Carroll, '16. trustees. The stu
dent members of the Board of Trus
tees are the president of the Student
Body and the Junior class representa
tive on the Executive Committee. As
sistant Professor E. W. Smith, '99, has
succeeded R. W. Barrett, '04, as per
manent secretary. Barrett held the
position during the time of organiza
tion, and Smith during the busy times
of building and collecting funds, and
to both men belongs credit for faith
ful service in the position.
The work of collecting among un
dergraduates has been performed by
four students. E. C. Behrens, '14, is
the present campus collector. His pre
decessors have been W. R. Chandler.
'13, I. I. Ingraham, '13, and A. W. Am
brose, '13.
