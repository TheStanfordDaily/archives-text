# CAP AND GOWN SELLS SEVEN HUNDRED FEET

At last the cat is out of the ba r r!
Perhaps one might more properly call
it a centipede, for certain it is that
none of the feline species possess such
an abundance of "pedis." However,
that, may be. Cap and Gown 's willing
to acknowledge that it walked away
with $175 at the sale of soles last
Wednesday, which means that at least
"00 one-steppers will be able to one
tep on one square foot of the dance
floor in the new Women's Clubhouse.
