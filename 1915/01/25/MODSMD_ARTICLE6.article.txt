# RIVAL COMMITTEES AGAIN DEADLOCK ON FRESHMAN QUESTION
## Possibility of Intercollegiate First Year Competition Brings Ray of Hope CALIFORNIA LOGIC TWISTED 
### 
Drawing up an Intercollegiate agree
ment between Stanford and the Uni
versity of California is no nearer so
lution than prior to the meeting of
the two committees on Saturday even
ing. As a result of the conference be
tween the representatives the Califor
nia committee will request President
Benjamin Ide Wheeler to appoint a
committee to wait on a similar com
mittee from Stanford to see if it is
possible to restore the Freshman in
tercollegiate game. Honest difference
of opinion on the proposition, whether
or not Freshmen shall be allowed to
compete in Varsity contests has re
sulted in an absolute deadlock, as far as
an intercollegiate agreement is con
cerned. The committees adjourned in
definitely to be called together at tiie
option of the chairman, V. Doyle, of
the University of California.
Farnum Griffiths showed that llie
intercollegiate relations were at a
crisis and that if the game
was an impediment in the way it might
be possible to place it in the hands ol'
the faculty for adjustment. The Cali
fornia Committee maintained that the
first-year contest had been abrogated
by notice from Stanford, but that Cali
fornia had never been given a fair
consideration.
The Stanford Committee agreed that
California was entitled to a hearing
if they wanted the game back, but
that they would hold out no false
hopes for a reinstatement, and that it
the Freshman game were restored ir
would make no difference, from ;i
Stanford viewpoint, in regard to the el
igibility of Freshmen on varsity teams.
The matter of Freshmen games is
taken up by California entirely on her
own initiative, and does not come from
the Stanford Committee. It was put.
in the form of a motion and acted on
only by the California representatives
They authorized themselves to re
quest President Wheeler to appoint a
committee to wait on a Stanford com
mittee in order to restore the Fresh
ment game by .removing reasons here
tofore advanced when the Freshman
game was eliminated. The motion was
offered as a ray of hope for opening
the way to arriving at an agreement.
California's arguments in favor ot
eliminating Freshmen from varsity
competition have simmered down to
one reason, namely, to make athletic
.relations between the two universities
above reproach in the future, and as
such should be insisted upon. The
Stanford Committee can see no reason
for abolishing Freshman competition,
until such ;i condition does exist or
until there is a possibility of such a
condition existing in the near future.
Such a ruling will not eliminate the
evil of subsidiz'ng. California acknowl
edges that athletic conditions have
improved at both universities, and that
each team is a little more alovo re
proach than the proceed'ng o'ie be
cause the team is more amateur, 112
such is possible. If this is the case
the Stanford Comm'ftee argues, why
change a condition that if itmrovini?,.

the downhill road. Conditions as they
exist in California are entirely differ

Freshmen ruling has been put into ef

George Presley proposed the argu
ment that California has never consid
ered the evil that men were competing
on intercollegiate teams who were
not in college, but rather in affiliated
colleges; and that men might he
squeezed into the affiliated colleges
who could not get in the college prop
er. The possibility of reproach along
this line was advanced as being much
graver than in the case of Freshmen.
When previous agreements have
been drawn up between the two uni
versities Stanford has always held
that there should be a strict scholar
ship ruling embodied in the agreement,
but California has always objected on
the ground that the Faculty and stu
dents believe that if a man is eligible
to be in California he is eligible to
take part in all activities of the Uni
versity. At the present time they rea
son that Freshmen should be barred
from varsity competition. These ar
guments conflict with each other.

Farnum Griffiths showed that llie
intercollegiate relations were at a

first-year contest had been abrogated
by notice from Stanford, but that Cali

California's arguments in favor ot
eliminating Freshmen from varsity

one reason, namely, to make athletic

for abolishing Freshman competition,

until there is a possibility of such a
condition existing in the near future.

this line was advanced as being much

When previous agreements have
been drawn up between the two uni

to be in California he is eligible to
take part in all activities of the Uni
