# APPRECIATION
## 
### 
Stanford undergraduates are very
fortunate to have many friends of the
University who are indirectly connect
ed with the activities of the institu
tion who are ever zealous to look af
ter the students' welfare. Such a per
son is Miss Mertha Berner, who has
recently given three pictures and a
copy of the only talk Mrs. Stanford
ever made to the women of the Univer
sity to three organizations 011 the
campus, namely, the Women's Club
house, Stanford Union, and Encina
Club. Tokens of appreciation have
already been extended by the two afore
mentioned organizations to Miss Her
ner for her kindness. These gifts will
undoubtedly be valued by the under
graduates of the future, as well as the
present generation. Of especial sig
nificance is the copy.of Mrs. Stanford's
talk, which carries with it a personal
message to be valued and cherished by
all Stanford women as being given di
rectly to them.
The letter published in Friday's
edition of The Daily Palo Alto carries
with it an insight into Stanford his
tory as has seldom been evolved to
students of the present generation.
Not only are reminiscences of direct
news value and interest today, but they
are also chronicles or sources of in
formation for tomorrow.
