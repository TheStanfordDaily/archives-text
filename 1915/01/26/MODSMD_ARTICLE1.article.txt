# MISSION VS. VARSITY MIDWEEK ATTRACTION
## Hoever and Howe to Share Honors on Mound FAIR WEATHER PROMISED Santa Clara Nine Is Materially Strengthened by Shifted Batting Order and a Changed Line-Up 
### 
Santa Clara will oppose the Stanford
Varsity on the local diamond tomor
row afternoon in their second series
game with the Cardinals. Last Wed
nesday when these two teams crossed
bats, the Mission aggregation was
overwhelmed in a five-inning engage
ment by the one-sided score of 8 to 1.
Seven contests in all have been se
cured by Graduate Manager W ilcox
with the Catholic university.
Manager Nicholson has announced
quite a shake-up in the line-up of the
niissionites, which prom ses to result
in a close game. The batting order
has been shifted considerably during
the past week, in an effort to produce
more runs. Instead of Stewart, whose
curves were quite to the liking of the
Stanford sluggers, eith. r Hickey, Rep
py, or Leonard will be used as mound
artists, 'n all probability the dvtv
holding down the lately-developed
heavy stickers on the local nine will
fall to the lot of Leonard, a pitcher of
shut-out reputation.
Coach Hilly Orr and Captain Torn
Workman are planning to make three
sw'.tches in the Cardinal line-up be
fore the game is over, differing from
the personnel of the team last Satur
day. Day. as lead-off man, will hold
down left field. Owing to the fact
that Stafford will be unable to par
ticipate in actual competition for sev
eral day's, Austin, custodian of the
keystone sack, will follow on the bat
ting order. Skipper Workman will di
rect the play of the team in his ac
customed position at the initial sta
tion. The responsibilities of clean-up
hitter have been assigned to Dent, who
will catch for the f'rst four or five
innings, when he is to be relieved by
Lander. Noonan, fly-chaser in the
center garden, will follow Dent to the
plate. McCloskey is to resume his
