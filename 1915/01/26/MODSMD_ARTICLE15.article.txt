# SCHOLARSHIP RESOLUTIONS ESTABLISH COMMON GROUNDS
## Committees Are Desirous of Effecting Compromise MANY CONCESSIONS OFFERED California Will Bar Affiliated Colleges and Raise Athletic Requirements to Obtain Freshman Ruling 
### 
Conditions have developed in the In
tercollegiate situation which cast a
.ray of hope in arriving at an agree
ment between Stanford and the Uni
versity of California. The members
of the California Committee have ex
pressed themselves as being willing to
compromise in order to bring about an
amicable settlement of the preseut
strained relations.
A tentative agreement has been
reached by the committees. Stanford
representatives proposed two import
ant measures last Saturday night, -is
a way of getting together in the sit
uation. The first and most important,
from a Stanford viewpoint, is a schol
arship ruling, and secondly the elim
inating of students registered in affil
iated colleges from varsity competi
tion. The California Committee have
agreed since then to both measures, if
the Stanford Committee will agree to
abolish Freshmen from competition in
Varsity contests. From the standpoint
of the committees intercollegiate rela
tions loom up as of g.reat importance
in comparison with the subsidiary
rules, and both sides are willing to
compromise, if California can make
possible the .restoration of the Fresh
man game.
The scholarship ruling will bring
about a condition that Stanford has
been advocating for ten years. At the
present time Stanford has a ruling
which makes ineligible for athletic
competition in athletics all those who
do not make at least two-thirds of
new hours, with a minimum of nine.
California faculty ruling only enforces
a. ruling that a man must make eight
hours to represent the University, but
the hours may be incomplete or con
ditions made up. By the new ruling
it will be necessary for the California
faculty to introduce a higher scholar
sh'p rule, namely, that the students
must make two-thirds new hours each
semester, with a minimum of nine, in
order to represent the institution in
intercollegiate competition.
Under the proposed changes in tho
intercollegiate agreement it will me;n
that all students .registered in the af
filiated colleges, including the school
of dentistry, medicine, pharmacy, law,
and the farm school, will be unable to
compete on varsity teams.
