# OPERA CHORUS TRY-OUTS ARE SET FOR TOMORROW
## Second Preliminary Hearing to Be Held Wednesday Afternoon Before 1916 Committee. 
### 
A second preliminary try-out for
chorus parts in the Junior Opera will
be held tomorrow afternoon at 1:30
at the Alpha Omicron Pi house. Com
petition for places is unusually keen,
for only a limited number of chorus
parts are open this year. By means
of frequent try-outs a gradual elimina
tion is being made in the ranks of the
applicants, and the 191(1 committee
seems assured of a chorus of real ex
cellence.
The scenic background of "At the
Dragon's Eye" will lend itself readily
to elaborate costuming and choral
grouping, which will contribute no
small share to an effective ensemble.
