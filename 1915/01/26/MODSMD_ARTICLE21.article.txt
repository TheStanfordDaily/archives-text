						CLUB HOUSES

### 
Announcement was made yesterday
that The Stanford Union and The Wo
men's Club House would open on the
evening of February 6, with an in
formal house warming. Active con
struction was started on the buildings
about fourteen months ago, and ever
since the students have been looking
forward to the time when the build
ings would be completed. Disappoint
ments have been met with, reverses
encountered, and false hopes en
throned during the process of con
struction. We are in the present and
should fo.vget the past, but not with
out a word to those who have labored
unceasingly to make The Stanford
Union and The Women's Club House ?
reality.
There is not a Stanford man who
does not know that Mr. 11. C. Hoover,
'95, was the originator of the plan for
the Union, and largely through his ef
forts the scheme was made possible.
Active work during the past ten years
has been borne by Professor C. D.
Marx, Mr. F. H. Fowler, '06, and Mr.
E. W. Smith, '99. These men have
spared no pains to make the club
houses the largest thing in the Stan
ford life. They have devoted their val
uable time and sacrificed much In
their sincere endeavors to make the
ideas of Mr. Hoover a success. To
Mrs. P. J. Treat, '07, goes no little
credit for the edifice representing the
Women's Club House. As a result of
their effort the buildings will be
opened next week. Certainly the Fac
ulty, undergraduates, and alumni are
indebted to the above mentioned for
their loyalty and untiring labors and
to all who have taken an active part
in making possible the erection of the
buildings.
The Union and the Club House were
constructed with the idea in view of
restoring and strengthening the Stan
ford Spirit of democracy and creating
a meeting ground for Faculty, under
graduates. and alumni. Down here on
the farm we are one large family,
many factors in one unit, working con
jointly for the best interests of the
University. Each individual considers
himself a part. We pride ourselves on
that cosmopolitan spirit known as
Stanford democracy. A common meet
ing ground ha 3 long been needed
where all organizations may assemble.
May the Union and the Club House be
the center of Stanford activity.
