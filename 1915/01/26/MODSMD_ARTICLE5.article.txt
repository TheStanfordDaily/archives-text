# IBSEN PREMIERE BY MASQUERS TO QUICKEN THE DRAMATIC PULSE
## "Pillars of Society" Reaches New Plane in Scope of Stanford Stagecraft. 
### 
When the curtain rises in the As
sembly Hall Friday evening, February
•">, it will disclose a cast of exception
al strength in the first rbsen play ever
produced on the Stanford stage. The
Masquers promise a production of
"The Pillars of Society" that will riv
al in dramatic power and interest the
greatest successes in local history.
The players have been selected with
especial care and consideration of
their fitness for the exacting roles on
trusted them. Daily rehearsals and
thoughtful study of individual parts
promise to effect a distinctive presen
tation of Ibsen's "small town trage
dy." in which the elements of ro
mance, realism, and comedy are united
in masterly fashion.
The act'on of "Tlie Pillars of Socie
ty" takes place in a small town on the
Norwegian coast. The opening scene,
which represents the schoolmaster
"Rorlund" (H. C. Soper, '15,) reading
aloud to a select circle of the "great
est" ladies of the town, is a master
piece of satiric humor. Here one "s
introduced to "Consul Bernick" (F. O.
McColloch, '17.) a wealthy ship-owner,
and a very "pillar of society." Nothing
can succeed in the town without Ber
j nick's sanction. He poses as the mod
el of civic and domestic virtues, and
his fellow citizens believe him to be as
noble ns he appears. All is well until
the end of the first act, when two
very unwelcome relatives of Mrs. Ber
nick (Miss Elizabeth Taff, ' 1 f».) return
from the United States. One is "Lona
Hessel' (Miss Margery Bailey, *14.)
and her half-sister, to whom Bernick
had once been engaged, and the other
is "Johan Tonnesen" (J. C. Cross, '17.)
whom Bernick had permitted to bear
the guilt not only of a love affair in
j which he himself had been the main
sinner, but of a theft which he had
! never committed.
Johan's return causes Bernick nat
ural discomfort, for Johan had never
heard a word of the latter rumor.
Moreover, it is at this time of sus
preme importance for Bernick to keep
his good reputation, for he had been
promoting a ureat railway scheme and.
anticipating its success, had invested
his entire fortune in mines, water-
power, and lands 11 the locality to lie
benefitted by the road.
Hcwevor. an unforseen complication
•irises. lobar, falls in love with "Dina
Dorf" (Miss Florence Stewart, '16.)
the daughter of the actress, from
whose window he was said to have
made his escape fifteen years before,
and Rorlund, who is also fond of the
young gi.vl, blurts out the scandalous
secret in the presence of both.
A climax of unexpected intensity
and power is extremely effective, from
a dramatic standpoint and forms a
means of tightening the threads of ID
sen's extraordinary plot in further
complications. Only a great dramatist
could have created the scenes which
follow, and, though Ibsen's ending is a
happy one, it ! s by no means conven
tional. The optimism of the play, as a
whole, .renders it .particularly suitable
for production on the campus. Coach
F. 1,. Mnthieu anticipates the most fin
ished presentation of several seasons.

very unwelcome relatives of Mrs. Ber
nick (Miss Elizabeth Taff, ' 1 f».) return
from the United States. One is "Lona
Hessel' (Miss Margery Bailey, *14.)
and her half-sister, to whom Bernick
had once been engaged, and the other
is "Johan Tonnesen" (J. C. Cross, '17.)
whom Bernick had permitted to bear
the guilt not only of a love affair in
j which he himself had been the main
sinner, but of a theft which he had
! never committed.
Johan's return causes Bernick nat
ural discomfort, for Johan had never
heard a word of the latter rumor.
Moreover, it is at this time of sus
preme importance for Bernick to keep
his good reputation, for he had been
promoting a ureat railway scheme and.
anticipating its success, had invested
his entire fortune in mines, water-
power, and lands 11 the locality to lie
benefitted by the road.

secret in the presence of both.
A climax of unexpected intensity
and power is extremely effective, from

means of tightening the threads of ID

complications. Only a great dramatist
could have created the scenes which
follow, and, though Ibsen's ending is a
happy one, it ! s by no means conven
tional. The optimism of the play, as a
whole, .renders it .particularly suitable
for production on the campus. Coach

When the curtain rises in the As

•">, it will disclose a cast of exception
al strength in the first rbsen play ever
produced on the Stanford stage. The
Masquers promise a production of
"The Pillars of Society" that will riv
al in dramatic power and interest the
greatest successes in local history.
The players have been selected with
especial care and consideration of
their fitness for the exacting roles on
trusted them. Daily rehearsals and
thoughtful study of individual parts
promise to effect a distinctive presen
tation of Ibsen's "small town trage
dy." in which the elements of ro
mance, realism, and comedy are united
in masterly fashion.
The act'on of "Tlie Pillars of Socie
ty" takes place in a small town on the
Norwegian coast. The opening scene,
which represents the schoolmaster
"Rorlund" (H. C. Soper, '15,) reading
aloud to a select circle of the "great
est" ladies of the town, is a master
piece of satiric humor. Here one "s
introduced to "Consul Bernick" (F. O.
McColloch, '17.) a wealthy ship-owner,
and a very "pillar of society." Nothing
can succeed in the town without Ber
j nick's sanction. He poses as the mod
el of civic and domestic virtues, and
his fellow citizens believe him to be as
noble ns he appears. All is well until
