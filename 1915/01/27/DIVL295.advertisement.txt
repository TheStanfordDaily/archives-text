BUY A POUND OF COTTON
The "Buy a Bale" movement to help the South is a wonderful thing. It has
spread over the country iike a prairie fire. Every one is eager to help the South.
The cotton crop is a splendid one this year, and the cotton growers expected great
prosperity, and then the European war came along and swept away their market.
Of course the colton is just as valuable as it ever was, and when things get
straightened out. and the factories of Europe get running again, there will be such
a demand for cotton cs the world has never known. But meanwhile the South can't
EAT cotton, and so everyone must stretch a helping hand to the people of the
cotton states. That's why the "Buy a Bale" movement was started.
Now a bale of cotton weighs about 500 pounds, and at 10 cents a pound costs
$50.00, and then too, it's rather an awkward thing to store. Of course we'd all gladly
contribute $50.00 in so good a cause if we could, but most of us can't. And so the
new plan "Buy a POUND of Cotton" has been started by the New Fiction Pub
lishing Co., publishers of Snappy Stories and Romance. Here's the plan:
To every one sending the coupon in the corner of this announcement, together
with 10 cents, The New Fiction Publishing Co. will send a current copy of their
splendid new all story magazine Romance—AND THEY WILL SPEND THE
