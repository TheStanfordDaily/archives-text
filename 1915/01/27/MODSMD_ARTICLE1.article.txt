# ROTH IS STILL FASTING AFTER FORTY-ONE DAYS
## DERIVES ONLY NUTRITION FROM OCCASIONAL DRINKS OF WATER. END OF EXPERIMENT IS NIGH SCIENTISTS WATCH SELF-STARVING PROCESS WITH INTEREST.

"Nature will tell me when to break
my fast." So spoke R. C. Roth, of
Palo Alto, when asked on the forty
first day of his voluntary fast how
much longer he would abstain from
food. Roth began his fast to cure a
chronic digestive disorder, and has
not partaken of nourishment in any
form, except water. In this long
period of self-starvation Roth has lost
thirty-nine pounds, yet lie still seems
possessed of a great deal of vitality
and, until the last few days, has con
tinued active exercise. Now that the
period of his fast is lengthening, he
is conserving his remaining energy by
resting.
Roth's theory in regard to himself
is that through years of excessive eat
ing, years in which he indulged in the
r'chest and most indigestible foods, ho
poisoned his entire system. There
fore, he has stopped eating in order
to give all the vital parts of his bodv
time to eliminate the poisons which
have so long been accumulating.
"When these poisons have all been ex
cn. red." he said. "1 will break my
fast. Nature will give me unmistak
able signs. My tongue will clear, and
I will experience a natural appetite,
such as I have never known before. If
I should eat a lit tie food now. before
the poisons have been entirely elim
inated. the pu.rpose of my whole fast
would be undone. I am going ahead
confidently, and expect that the cli
max will be passed within a week, but
if ! t should be longer before my appe
tite returns, T will not worry, for
fasting is the simplest thing in the
world."
Roth hasn't felt, the pangs of hun
gpr since the first two days of his
fast. Hunger gave way to nauseating
sickness, and the sickness to extreme
nervousness. At present he suffers
from a drawing of the muscles and
attacks of temporary exhaustion. Still
he watches his wife eat three meals a
day without experiencing the slightest
desire for nourishment.
He plans to break his fast with fruit
juices when the p.roper time arrives.
Professor R. E. Swain, of the Chem
istry department, has Roth under daily
observation, and is making a chemical
study of the case. It is exceedingly in
teresting chemically as a study of the
action of the different, human excre
tory organs in the advance stages of
starvation.
When asked to explain why men of
ten starve to death when without food
for periods as short as a week, Roth
explained that such persons die of
fright of death from starvation. "Eat
ing," said Roth, "is with all mo.re of a
habit than a necessity. Excessive
amounts of food do not build vitality.
We eat ten times more than we need.
Oastronomic dissipation is responsible
for crime and addiction to strong drink
in a good many cases, because it acts
as a stimulant. A large meal calls for
coffee, the coffee for cigarettes, and
the tobacco for alcohol.
