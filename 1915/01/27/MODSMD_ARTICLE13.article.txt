# HIGH SCHOLASTIC STANDARDS
## 
### 
The idea has been suggested by the
Stanford Intercollegiate Agreement
Committee, and accepted by the Cali
fornia Committee, if an agreement be
tween the two universities is made
possible that it will contain a scholar
ship ruling similar to the one at pres
ent in force in this institution. The
University of California at present
has a ruling to the effect that students
must make at least eight units in or
der to represent the institution, but it
is only necessary for a part of these
units to be credited in new courses.
The rest may be made up of incom
pletes or conditions that have been
removed. At Stanford it is necessary
fo.r a student to make at least two
thirds of his subjects in order not to go
on probation,and if hegoes on probation
there is a Faculty ruling which pro
hibits him from competing on varsity
teams or representing the Universities
in any activities.
From the above comparisons any
fair-minded person can see that Stan
ford has been competing at a disad
vantage with California. The State in
stitution, with its scholarship regula
tions more lax than Stanford, may
have been from time to time represent
ed on the field, diamond, water, or
track by men who would have been in
eligible if stricter scholarships had
been employed.
For ten years Stanford Intercolle
giate Committees have tried to insti
tute a strict scholarship ruling in tiu>
various agreements drawn up from
time to time, but the proposition has
always been met with a flat refusal.
California has argued that its' Fac
ulty and students believed if a man is
eligible to represent the University
he is eligible to represent it in all the
activities of the institution.
A hopeful note has been sounded for
the realization of the high scholastic
standards in the regulation of inter
collegiate relations in the future. In
this way athletics may be made a con
structive rather than a destructive
adjunct to an athlete's college career.
To institute in the agreement a strict
ruling on scholarship will place Stan
ford on a more equal basis for compe
tition with California, and will raise
the average scholastic standards of
the athletes. Hack of the desire to
play on the team will be the necessity
to make good from the Faculty view
point. To make the highest schol
astic standards operative, the co-oper
ation of the California Faculty is need
ed. Tto reach an agreement conces
sions on both sides are necessary. This
is an opportunity for California to do
her part in making possible intercolle
giate competition.
