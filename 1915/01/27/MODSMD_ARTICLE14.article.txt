# Mrs. Stanford's Speech
## 
### 
111 the days of her activity, Mrs. Jane
Lathrop Stanford manifested a re
markable interest in the five hundred
women registered at the University.
She regarded them as being especially
entrusted to her care and, in 1903, is
sued a plea for all her charges to live
noble, Christian lives, both as under
graduates and alumnae. The Daily
Palo Alto prints the most striking por
tions of this expression of her ideals
in the following article:
I would have each one of my girls
remember that she exe,rts an influence
extending far beyond her conception,
and I pray that it will be for good al
ways; and I would have her realize
she can use it for the good of her uni
versity in a constant endeavor to up
hold the Stanford standard of
honesty, sincerity and truth in all
things. This is her duty, and I wou'd
have her meet it seriously and willing
ly. I would have the Stanford girl be
womanly in the highest, sweetest sense
of the word. I would have her enjoy
to the fullest her equal privileges here
with gentle,womanly dignity, respect
ing herself and making all with whom
she comes in contact respect her.
Finally, above all else, I would have
her go out into the world a noble.
Christian woman, who will stand for
something serious in life, and always
be a credit to Stanford. What is more
pitiful than to meet a highly educat
ed, cultured boy or gi.rl, man or wo
man, who is utterly devoid of any
sense of obligation to an all-wise
Heavenly Father for the many bles
sings bestowed upon the children of
the earth. One and all of us have been
grieved by the assertion in public
print that Stanford University is a
"Godless Institution," therefore, T be
seech you one and all to so live and
act your part in life that you will be
known as lovers of Christ and of the
greatest of all teachers—ou.r precious
Saviour.
