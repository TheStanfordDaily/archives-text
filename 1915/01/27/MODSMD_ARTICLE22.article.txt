# PLANS FORMULATED FOR IMPROVEMENT OF QUAD
## Grounds Between Outer and Inner Buildings to Be Leveled and Beautified. 
### 
Ground between the outer and inner
buildings of the Quad will soon be on
a level with the inner Quad pave
ments. Workmen are busy filling in
the ground back of the English build
ing and the Library. Their improve
ments will not end until the entire
Quad has been leveled, and, possibly,
paved, though it is not yet decided how
the surface of the ground will be left.
Brick casements are built a few feet
from each wall to leave a space for
light in the basements of the outer
Quad. The improvements include the
planting of trees at different places on
the Quad, and possibly the pavement
of the inner Quad.
Two new walls extending from the
southwest corner of the Quad, where
the car stops, to Roble Hall and Roblc
Gymnasium, have already been con
structed.
Other plans for the general improve
ments have not matured yet, and can
not. be made public. They are a part
of the campaign for the beautification
of Stanford.
