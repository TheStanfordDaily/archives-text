# Freshman Vaudeville Fate in Balance.
## 
### 
Final decision of the fate of the
Freshmen vaudeville will be made to
morrow when the class meets for a
definite vote in room 214 at 1:10 p. m.
The question has been argued by the
class for some time, and it is probable
that the Freshmen show will be abol
ished altogether, as the University
authorities have suggested.
