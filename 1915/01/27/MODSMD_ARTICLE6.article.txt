# TENTATIVE AGREEMENT IS DRAWN UP BY COMMITTEES
## Compromise Effected When California Agrees to Eliminate Affiliated College Athletes and to Adopt Stringent Scholarship Rule. Stanford Accedes to Freshman Measure SPRING CONTEST UNDER OLD TERMS 
### 
Athletic relations with California
will continue fo.r the present semester
under the old Five-Year Agreement,
and the terms of the tentative pact to
succeed it have been drawn up. Such
were the facts given out without au
thorization in San Francisco this
morning and verified by A. E. Wor
thy, '15, secretary of the Agreement
Committee, this afternoon.
The approach of the time for spring
competition and the inability of the
graduate managers of the two univer
sities to go ahead with any plans for
the 1915 season till the Agreement
Committees came to some terms led
to the action which was taken at a
special meeting of the committees in
San Francisco Monday evening.
The terms were to have been with
held from publication and a gentle
man's agreement was made to this
effect at the conference. A direct and
inexcusable violation of this agree
ment on the part of one of the mem
bers of the committee is the only ex
planation of the fact that the San
Francisco papers had the story this
morning. Secretary Worthy alone was
authorized to give out the facts at the
proper time. They were not given out
by him, and he refused to verify the
report until shown the San Francisco
accounts, and it was made obvious
that a violation of the agreement had
already been made.
Since all the terms of the agreement
vere published this morning in The
)a'.ly Californian, it seems highly
nrobable that the statement was given
'Hit by a member of the California
onimittee. The Californian article
tatcs that the agreement was given
out by the joint Stanford-California
Committee. This is impossible for
â€¢( committee action taken Monday
filing against such an announce
ment has not been changed.
The agreement is only tentative, but
it looks to an ultimate settlement of
nte.rcollegiate differences. It will have
to be approved by the executive com
mittees of the two universities before
it becomes valid, and in no case will
it go into effect before August. The
terms follow:
1. The Freshman ineligibility rule,
providing that first-year men shall be
barred from competition in varsity
contests, is to be adopted.
2. Only students enrolled in the
regular colleges at Herkeley shall be
eligible to play on University of Cali
fornia teams in intercollegiate con
tests with Stanford: that is to say stu
dents in the so-called affiliated col
leges shall be ineligible.
3. The scholarship requirements im
posed upon members of intercolle
giate teams shall be made the same
for both universities. This is to meet
Stanford's contention that athletes at

Berkeley have nut heretofore been re
quired to pass in as many hours of
work in order to be eligible for inter
col legiate teams as the Stanford ath
letes.
4. Intercollegiate Freshman foot
ball and, as may be mutually agree
able, other Freshman intercollegiate
contests are to be restored.
According to George J. Presley, the
scholarship rule is a thing which has
been contended for by Stanford com
mittees for the last ten years, and an
agreement containing it is one of great
advantage to Stanford. The Faculty
here has prescribed high standards to
be attained before students can par
ticipate in athletics. They are re
quired to pass in two-thirds of the
hours of work they are carrying. At
California the standard is much lower,
requiring only eight units to be made,
while six of these may be gained
through making up incomplete or con
ditional courses. Also, in the past
California students have been allowed
to take examinations to make up their
deficiency, if on probation, before the
time of their major sport, a privilege
not granted at Stanford. The result
is that many athletes are prevented
from participating every year at
Stanford, while California teams have
practically never been materially
weakened on this account.
Though the different system of
counting hours at California, one
hundred and twenty-eight being need
ed for graduation, and other matters
of detail will make it necessary to
prepare a careful agreement to cover
the matter, the Agreement Committee
wants to draw a rule which will re
quire California to be as severe in re
gar dto scholarship as Stanford has
been in the past.
To offset the elimination from par
ticipation in the intercollegiate con
tests a Freshmen meet will be insti
tuted, at least in football, under the
new management. The Freshman con
test was abrogated by the Stanford
Faculty, and it is not known whether
o,r not they will accede to reinstating
it under the new conditions. One of
the provisions made by the Stanford
members of the committee Monday
night was that, unless this game could
be reinstated, their consent to the
elimination from varsity sports would
be withdrawn. Knowing this, Califor
nia desires to have a California faculty
committee confer with the Stanford
committee on athletics and try to get
them to reinstate the Freshman game.
President Wheeler will appoint a com
mittee to do this, and, unless success
ful, the tentative agreement is broken.
The rule eliminating students en
rolled in affiliated colleges is another
one which will work to Stanford's ad-
vantage. The students in the San
Francisco and Davis branches of the
State University have been allowed to
compete in the past. The entrance
requirements for these colleges are
low, and many athletes have enrolled
in them who could not ga'n admission
to either of the universities in the main
departments. This is another rule
which will have to he carefully drawn
to cover all the cases intended by the
representatives of the two universi
ties. For one thins, the rule will be so
drawn as to prevent students from en
roling in the Berkeley departments
during the season of their sport, and
spending the rest of the year in one
of the affiliated colleges.
Only the barest terms of the agree
ment have been decided to date, but it
! 'j;ives a working basis to the committee
j in its efforts to come to a peaceful
settlement, if accepted by the exec
utive committees the details will be
worked out. by the Intercollegiate Com
mittee to insure the intentions of the
committee being followed. Though
this will lead to friction, and it is pos
sible that no settlement can be made
i even following this compromise, fu
ture competition, at least seems prob
able and. if the break conies, it will not
be until after the present season.
