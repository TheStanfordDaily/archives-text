1 ne new shell purchased from Ward

which was purchased at the time <«112
Stanford's last entry in the Pouglikeep
sie meet, but which failed to arrive in
time to be used.
Seventy-six of the men signed up
arc still coming out for practice daily
on Lagunita. Fifty-two of these are
i' reshmen. Ten of the first-year men
are coxswains, as opposed to eight
steersmen last year, and four the year
before. Four veterans of last year's
varsity are in college, and are contest
ing for positions this year. They are
Vapiain G. A. Jacomini, '15, No. 4; F.
£. Rehm, '15, No. 5; 1. M. Hulsman,
15, No. 7, and C. H. Orme, '16, No. 6.
Among the vacancies arc the stroke
and coxswain berths, and men will
have to be developed fox these posi
tions. The candidates for the latter
are J. H. Goodman, '16, who cox
swained the Second Varsity last year
and the 1916 Freshmen, and L. Waller,
steersman of the 1917 craft.
A number of last year's freshman
and second varsity eight are trying
out to fill the vacancies among the
oarsmen. Among them are Green and
Wo.rth, Varsity substitutes in 1911,
Kester and Hloeser, Second Varsity,
Maurer, Andrews McEuen, Rogers,
Pettingill, Day, and Russell, members
of the Freshman crew.
At present the men arc working out
every night in the two and four-oared
barges on Lagunita. A time schedule
has been arranged to give every man
a chance on the Lake each day. The
Freshmen have already lost much of
their awkwardness on the water, and
are handling the oars with greater
ease.
Coach Guerena is on the campus
four times a week to direct the work
outs. As soon as the new float is in
place the list of names will be posted
daily of the men who will take tho
trip to Redwood to work-out on the
Ray.
