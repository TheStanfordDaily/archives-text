The joint action of the Intercolle
giate Committees has made possible
the continuance of relations between
Stanford and California for the re
mainder of this semester. The rules
which have applied for the past five
years will remain in operation until
August, 1915, by a "gentleman's agree
ment." The action of the Stanford
committee was ratified last evening by
the Executive Committee.
Two decided advantages are to be
derived from the temporary adjust
ment of relations. In the first place
the graduate managers of both institu
tions will now be able to complete
their athletic schedule, which was al
most impossible before the agreement
situation was settled. Second, and
most important, more time may be
taken for drawing up a permanent
agreement between the respective in
stitutions. It will not be necessary to
go into the matter headlong and ar
rive at hasty conclusions without con
sidering the advantages and disad
vantages thoroughly. It is also prob
able that other suggestions may be of
fered which might lead to an amicable
solution of the problem before the re
spective student bodies.
