It. is reported that the Grounds
Committee of the Hoard of Trustees
will probably restore the chimes, made
silent by the earthquake of IDUti. They
will be placcd on a structure built for
the purpose between the two engineer
ing buildings on the terrace opposite
the Vestry. Student opinion is strong
ly in favor of such a plan.
