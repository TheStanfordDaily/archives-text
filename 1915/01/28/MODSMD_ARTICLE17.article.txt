# Sonny on Crew
## 
### 
Stanford, Jan. 28, 1915.
Dearest Ma: The finest thing about
this institution is the custom that the
athletes hold the highest scholarship
records. I wouldn't believe that, if I
were you, until the statistics come out
about me. Yep, I signed up to be an ath
lete, for crew. Crew is great stuff. It's
easy enough after one gets the swing
of it, which consists of the following,
which are to be done all at once: 1,
keep head up and eyes in the boat; 1,
keep back straight; 3, reacn way out
(still keeping back straight, head up
and eyes in the boat); 4, keep slide's
from sliding; 5, watch the man in
front; G, square the oar up very
squarely; 7, pull it through the water.
This may sound easy enough on paper,
but oars were made to dive to the bot
tom, and slides were not made to keen
from sliding, and my back was mad v
for a camel. When I signed up 1 was
told to .report for practice daily, and not
to be scared to "interrogate the cap
tain." So yesterday when it rained
hard all day 1 phoned the capt. and
asked if there would be any practice
during the heavy rain. He said there
would be, and asked my name. That
night I was roused out of bed at mid
night. It was secret crew practice,
they paid—secretly held at night so
California scouts could not get the
dope on us. As I was getting into \
boat the man with me slipped and fell
in, and when I came up I couldn't set
out, because they didn't seem to want
to lot in Q . When 1 said that the water
was colder than ice they said that if
such was the case they had better
tall off the practice. That little bath
saved me trouble and time the next :>
m. it's an ill wind that doesn't blow
perfume on somebody. Syllabus fees
are due next week. Otherwise I'm feel
ing great. Syllabus fees are a tax to
help the University pay stenographers.
Hoping that you are having something
besides rain. I am with bushels of
love. SONNY.
I'. S. —1 just decided to drop crew
and take up debating.
