Yep, we have some pitching sta.fi'
I this season, one that ought to keep the
other team missing them altogether, if
they don't bounce them off the handle.
Fans may expect a vast improve
ment in sliding and base-running just
as soon as the rain takes a vacation.
A slid ng pit has been constructed 011
the varsity field, and Coach liilly Orr
is going to start the men practicing
the gentle art of hitting the dirt via
the hook-slide route.
.1. Pluvius still leads the Peanut
League, having annexed just eight of
the twelve games sehedulod to date.
"Doc" Hayes will he out of the game
for two weeks. He is benched by an
attack of blood-poisoning in his tw'rl
ing hand.
"Wobbles" Stafford is still on the
injured list, though his hand is heal
ing rap.dly. Stafford will probably
resume his position at the second sack
in the game with Ireland's independ
ents. a week from Saturday.
