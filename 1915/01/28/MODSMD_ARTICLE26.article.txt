# Dr. Stolz Condemns Our Training Table System
## Present Plan of Prescribing Special Diet Is Neither Normal Nor Beneficial, He Maintains. 
### 
Training tables, as they are used in j
modern colleges and for Stanford ath
letes, are not what they should be, ac
cording to Dr. Herbert R. Stolz, who
believes that they should lie abolished.
"Training, as our athletes do it, is i
j not living the normal way," says Dr. j
I Stolz. "The training table is a tradi- j
j tion to get away from at Stanford. |
What food su'ts one man doesn't suit
another. One man may be able to eat j
meat all the time; another may not.
One could eat apple pie; others could
j not.
"As soor as training is broken, men j
go and commit excess in drinking or
eating. That proves that the training
table is not normal. Each man on p.
1 team should train himself. He ought I
1 to know by this time what he wants
j and needs to eat better than any one |
else.
"A great example of the right kin<l
of tra'ning was shown us by the New
j Zealand and English rugby teams. J
| They had no training tabic, and their i
men were in as good condition as !
j ours.
"To train rightly is one thing a man
j should learn in college. There is
nothing that, will stand him in better
-:tead in later years. He must be able j
! to compete with others, and do a little ,
I beUer than they. To do this he must
'â€¢e fit. physically. Right training will
! make him fit.."
Though Dr. Stolz in no way advocat
; >d a movement to abolish the training
table, he held that college athletes
would lie better off if they trained
themselves.
