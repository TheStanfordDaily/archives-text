# COLLEGE OF PACIFIC TO MEET CARDINAL QUINTET
## Pacific Five Considered Dangerous Opponents-Stanford Line-up Not Yet Decided Upon. 
### 
Stanford's first game in the Inter
collegiate Basketball Series will be
played Saturday night, when the Car
dinal quintet meet the College of the
Pacific, at San Jose.
The Pacific players have already
established their season's precedent
with a 32 to 25 victory over St. Igna
tius College. To lower the laurels of
the San Jose team. Captain Reynolds
will lead a squad of nine men from
Palo Alto Saturday afternoon.
The exact line-up of the Cardinals
is not decided upon yet. However, it
is almost certain that Worthy, who has
been kept out of games to date by du
ties with the Agreement Committee,
will be team-mate of Blodget at for
ward. McMahon and Davidson will ac
company the team as substitutes.
It is doubtful if Dutton will be able
to take his place in the center of the
floor Saturday as he has been kept out
of practice games this week with a se
riously injured hand, which he tore on
gymnasium apparatus. Wallace will
probably be depended upon to do the
Jumping.
Dolan, Reynolds, and Caughey will
be defensive trio during the first
games of the series, at least.
Last season College of the Pacific
was one of thp strongest contenders
fo.r the championship of the Intercol
legiate League, and defeated Califor
nia decisively. This year's team is said
to be a stronger scoring machine than
ever before, and the game Saturday
night will put't to the supreme test.
