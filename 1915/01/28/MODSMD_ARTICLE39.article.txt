### 
MINNEAPOLIS, Jan. 28.â€”William F.
Allen, who graduated from Stanford in
1900, professor of anatomy at the Uni
versity of Minnesota, was arrested for
killing Carl Nyrall last night, while
the latter was attempting to enter the
Allen home. Allen was formerly con
nected with the marine laboratory of
the University of California. The po
lice say that Nyrall was drunk, and
did not realize what he was doing.
Allen called the police and told them
that he had shot Nyrall as he was leav
ing the back door, fie said he did not
regret his action. "A man entering
the home of another man may expect
to be taken as a burglar, and take the
consequences."
