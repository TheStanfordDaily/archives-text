# STANFORD ART CLUB HONORED
## Invited to Execute Mural Painting For Section of Education Building of Panama-Pacific Exposition RURAL CALIFORNIA IS SUBJECT 
### 
1 he Stanford Art Club has been in
vited to execute a mural painting for a
section of the Educat on building at
the Panama-Pacific Exposition. A
space has been s et aside in this build
ing for contributions of art schools
doing work of particular merit and
originality. The mural decoration will
lie of considerable size since the space
allotted is thirty-two feet long and
eight feet wide. The Art Club is
financing and executing the entire un- '
dertaking.
Stanford art stndents, under the di
rection of Assistant Professor J. V.
Poo.r, of the Graphic Art department,
are working out a new method of com
position. This method subordinates
academic technique and lays real
stress upon making the figures do
something that has a real relation to
the subject. The "looks" of the work
are not the first consideration. The
rules of composition are ignored, and
nstead the question is : "Does the
; figure belong there? Is its position
I natural?" When it is finished it is
studied, judged critically, and left un- I
| altered, whether or not it is deemed '
worthy of presentation.
The general subject chosen for the
scene to be exhibited at the exposi
i Ton is rural California. Tn cen-
I tral panel an accident (a boy hurt by
a runaway horse) is used to give the
centralizing emotion, which unifies the
action of the scattered parts. On the
right is an orchard scene, to the left
a barnyard scene. No attempt is made
to he literally true or entirely con
sistent geographically. For instance,
the combination of rolling hills and hay
■ with orange orchards is produced.
This decoration will furnish ample
opportunity for those who, missing its
real message, are inclined to ridicule,
but those who consider the spirit as
revealed in the work of art. more im
portant than mere detail will find
freshness, originality, variety, and life
presented with a sense of decorative
i fitness.
