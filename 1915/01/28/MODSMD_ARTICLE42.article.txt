# "BUSINESS AND MORALITY" THEME OF ENCINA TALK
## 
### 
"Business and Morality" is the sub
ject of the Right Reverend Frank
Thomas Gailor, fourth of the Sunday
night speakers fo.r men. Bishop Gailor
is the Memorial Church preacher for
the first half of the present, semester.
He gave his first sermon last Sunday
morning.
Reverend Gailor is the bishop of
Tennessee and chancellor of the Uni
versity of the South. He is one of the
best known educators and divines in
the South. A distinguished orator and
the author of a numbe.r of books, he
has been greatly in demand as a lec
turer.
The subject chosen bears in many
ways on the same topics as J. Stitt
Wilson's talk on last Sunday evening
Though his address will be in no way
an answer to the noted Socialist, it
will be interesting to contrast the sen
timents expressed from the different
viewpoints.
The meeting on Sunday evening will
start at Eneina Hall at 7:30. A music
al program has been arranged to pre
cede the talk by Bishop Gailo.r. All
men are invited to be present.
