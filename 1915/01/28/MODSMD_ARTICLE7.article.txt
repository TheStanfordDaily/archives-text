# EXPOSITION OFFICIALS WANT BIG GAME AT FAIR
## Financial Arrangements Must Be Consideredâ€”Many Eastern Universities Expected to Compete Here. 
### 
If a commission appointed by the
athletic commission in charge of sports
at the Panama-Pacific Eyposition is
successful in its mission, the annual
Big Game between Stanford and Cali
fornia for 1015 will be played on the
fair grounds instead of at Stanford
next year .
R. W. Wilcox, graduate manager, has
been appointed chairman of the com
mittee to arrange the Big Game at San
Francisco. John Stroud, manager for
California, was chosen vice-president
of the committee, and it is expected
that the work and influence of these
two men will be ahle to swing the deal
by which the place for the annual rug
by classic will be changed.
.Tust what opposition will have to be
ovoj'oomp is not known, as the matter
of expense will have to be considered.
It may be necessary to erect a new sta
dium. as no admission can be charged
to the exposition grand stand. Howev
er, it is thought by the Exposition
Athletic Committee that little trouble
will be experienced. Both student
bodies realize that the annual Bis;
Game at the fair will give both colleges
a prominence, by reason of the large
number of people who will witness the
game, if held in San F.rancisco. that
ean be equaled in practically no other
line of activity.
Negotiations will be opened with
nineteen eastern and middle western
universities, including Yale, Harvard,
Princeton. Cornell. Dartmouth, Wil
liams, Brown, Illinois, Amherst, Mich
igan, Pennsylvania, Denver, Carlisle,
Virginia. Washington, Jefferson, Chi
cago. Minnesota, and Syracuse univer
sities, to bring a number of teams to
the coast during the coming year to
compete with Pacific Coast athletes.
