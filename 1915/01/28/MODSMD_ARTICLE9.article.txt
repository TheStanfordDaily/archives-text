The action of the Intercollegiate
Agreement Committee in deciding to
continue the present agreement
throughout the semester, in order to
facilitate the drawing up of a new con
tract was ratified.
A resolution was also passed recom

Vestry. At present the bells are
stowed away in the University base

their unattractive surroundings seems
to meet with favor from everyone,
