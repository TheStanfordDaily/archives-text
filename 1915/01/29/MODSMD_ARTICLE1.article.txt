# VARSITY NINE WILL FACE SANTA CLARANS ON MISSION DIAMOND
## Tomorrow's Game Will Find Home Team in Competition With Hard-Hitting Stickmen of Coach Wolter's Charges BATTERY, HOEVER AND DENT 
### 
Weather permitting, the first base
ball game scheduled for a foreign field
will be played tomorrow afternoon at
Santa Clara between the Stanford
Varsity and the crack Mission nine.
The stay-at-home Cardinal fans will
not be void of amusement from the na
tional pastime, since the near-by Man
zanita preparatory school and the Sec
ond Varsity will clash on the local dia
mond in the morning.
Twelve men have been selected by
Coach Hilly Orr to make the trip to
Santa Clara. Several changes of un
usual interest are included in the line
up announced. Hoever will start the
game against the visitors, with Weeks,
a Freshman southpaw, as relief man
on the mound. Dent, as usual, will
appear from behind the bars on the
receiving end. "Wobbles" Stafford,
who has been out of the game during
the past two weeks, will once more
be back in the fold at second. The
torn finger, which suffered injury in
the contest with Ireland's Independ
ents, is now entirely healed. McClos
key and Stevens are to occupy their
customary berths at third and short,
respectively. Captain Tom Workman
will complete the infield, at the ini
tial station.
Five candidates are to be taken
along as outfield possibilities. Day is
booked as fly-chaser in the left gar
den during the entire nine innings.
Center field will fall to the lot of eith
er Noonan or Austin, in accordance
with the fact whether the Mission
slabsman be of the porst-side or right
hand variety. Either O'Neill or Down
ing will handle right field under the
same proviso.
The team will take the 12:54 train
to Santa Clara, eating lunch previous
to their leaving the campus. The game
will be called promptly at two-thirty.
Round-trip rates may be purchased for
seventy-five cents.
