# VARSITY NINE WILL FACE SANTA CLARANS ON MISSION DIAMOND
## Tomorrow's Game Will Find Home Team in Competition With Hard-Hitting Stickmen of Coach Wolter's Charges BATTERY, HOEVER AND DENT 
### 
Weather permitting, the first base
ball game scheduled for a foreign field
will be played tomorrow afternoon at
Santa Clara between the Stanford
Varsity and the crack Mission nine.
The stay-at-home Cardinal fans will
not be void of amusement from the na
tional pastime, since the near-by Man
zanita preparatory school and the Sec
ond Varsity will clash on the local dia
mond in the morning.
Twelve men have been selected by
Coach Hilly Orr to make the trip to
Santa Clara. Several changes of un
usual interest are included in the line
up announced. Hoever will start the
game against the visitors, with Weeks,
a Freshman southpaw, as relief man
on the mound. Dent, as usual, will
appear from behind the bars on the
receiving end. "Wobbles" Stafford,
who has been out of the game during
the past two weeks, will once more
be back in the fold at second. The
torn finger, which suffered injury in
the contest with Ireland's Independ
ents, is now entirely healed. McClos
key and Stevens are to occupy their
customary berths at third and short,
respectively. Captain Tom Workman
will complete the infield, at the ini
tial station.
Five candidates are to be taken
along as outfield possibilities. Day is
booked as fly-chaser in the left gar
den during the entire nine innings.
Center field will fall to the lot of eith
er Noonan or Austin, in accordance
with the fact whether the Mission
slabsman be of the porst-side or right
hand variety. Either O'Neill or Down
ing will handle right field under the
same proviso.
The team will take the 12:54 train
to Santa Clara, eating lunch previous
to their leaving the campus. The game
will be called promptly at two-thirty.
Round-trip rates may be purchased for
seventy-five cents.
Santa Clara will present the same
front as was intended to oppose the
Varsity in last Wednesday's game,
which was called off on account of wet
grounds. Instead of Stewart, whose
delivery was hit rath r freely at times
by Stanford stick artists, when the
visitors were sent home w'th an 8 to
1 defeat a week and a half ago, duty
on the firing line has been assigned
to Leonard. A hotly-contested match
may be anticipated, since Coach Harry
W'olter, of the Catholic nine, right
fielder on the Los Angeles Coast
League club, lias bolstered up his
team considerably with new faces and
a switched batting order.
Local diamond enthusiasts may not
feel slighted by the Varsity's leave of
absence, as Billy Orr promises an in
teresting exhibition in the forenoon.
This year's second team is one of the
strongest on record, and so may bo
depended upon to give full value in en
tertainment. The Second Varsity bat
tery will see Landers behind the plate
and Anderson doing the hurling. Wiclc
ersham and Hurley will pitch later in
the game. In the Infied, Blunt will ap
pear at first base, Henzel at the key
stone sack, Dickie in the short patch,
and Mulford at the difficult corner.
Pasture duty will fall to the lot of
Gates. Sanborn, and Davis, from left
to right, respectively. "Batter-up" will
be heard at ten-fifteen.
