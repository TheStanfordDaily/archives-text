# PLAYGOERS
## 
### 
If there are too many plays each se
mester, some should be abandoned.
If there are not, the students should
support them. We believe that a prop
er adjustment has been arrived at in
dramatics by staging three plays the
first semester and four the second
semester. Dramatic organizations are
formed with definite purposes. Hut
it is impossible to accomplish these
purposes unless the students co-oper
ate.
It is impossible to comment favor
ably o.r unfavorably on a play until it
has been seen. We cannot always in
sure success of a play from a glance
at the cast. We know that Ibsen and
Masquers make a winning combination.
Seat sales for various plays last se
mester hardly did justice to the ef
forts of the dramatists. The prices of
. pats are within the reach of most of
the students. Tickets for "Pillars of
Society" will be placed on sale Mon
day noon.
