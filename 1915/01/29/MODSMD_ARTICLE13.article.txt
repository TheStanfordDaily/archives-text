# UNFURLED
## 
### 
Through the kindness of members of
the Board of Trustees a huge Stanford
banner has just been .received on the
campus. The banner will float from
the flag pole on holidays, festive oc
casions and days when important ath
letic events take place. The students
appreciate the thoughtfulness and
community of interest evidenced by
the trustees in this presentation. The
banner will supply a long-felt need.
Hopes are ever higher when the Stan
ford colors unfurl to the breeze.
