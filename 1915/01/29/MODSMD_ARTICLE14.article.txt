# "WE ARE STARVING" STAMP HIDES WORDS FROM CENSOR

### 
"We are starving" was the pitiful
message given to sympathetic readers
when the postage stamp of a letter,
sent from people in Germany to rela
tives of a Stanford man in Los Angeles,
was accidentally steamed off, revealing
these three words of desperate appeal.
The message proper spoke optimistical
ly of the family's condition, intimating
nothing of the distress which was evi
dently being suffered. This incident
speaks well for the German board of
censorship.
