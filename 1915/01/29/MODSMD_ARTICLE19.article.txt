Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I note in Wednesday's issue an
item regarding a second election to
decide between two men for the Junior
class presidency. Having given some
study recently to the matter of prefer
ential voting, I was somewhat sur
prised on returning to Stanford to find
that the Student Body had not yet
adopted this manner of voting. A uni
versity student hody, supposedly as a
class of persons of intelligence above
the ordinary, should, in a measure,
set the example for society to follow.
For instance, we had "equal suffrage"
in the University before we had it po
litically in California. Why should
not the Stanford Student Body dem
onstrate to society how to conduct an
election scientifically?
As it happened, the few persons to
whom I have broached the subject
knew nothing of the system of prefer
ential voting. Those who have looked
into the matter know that the rather
crude and cumbersome method of con
ducting a double election can be avoid
ed by the use of a system of preferen
tial voting which does better in one
election what two elections had done
before.
For the benefit of those who may be
interested and who are unfamiliar
with the system, I would say that the
object of preferential voting is to
elect a candidate by an absolute ma
jority vote. This latter the double
election attempts to do. but often fails,
as could be demonstrated. The man
ner of voting is as follows: Instead
of the vote.r casting the vote for his
first choice in the first election and
for his second choice in the second
election, for for h's third choice, as
the case may be) he merely votes for
both bis first and second choices (or
more if he wishes) in the first and
only election, just as one would in
struct a messenger to "buy me an Ex
aminer, or, in case they a.ve sold out,
buy me a Times," thus avoiding thp
chance of Irs returning without the
Examiner and having to be sent a
second time for the Times. A second
election is on a par with such
houghtlesssness a? is suggested above.
It is just as easy to tell on the first
l allot. One merely votes for A for
first choice, for B for second choice,
for C for third, etc., for as many as he
cares to vote for. The ballot cle.rks
do the rest. As for counting the bal
lots, any grammar school pupil could
do it correctly if given a few plain In
structions. The plan is entirely work
able, and is in use in various parts of
the world at the present time, chiefly
in Europe, strange as it may seem.
T merely wish to bring this matter
to the attention of the Student Body
with the thought that some one in
whose sphe.re would lie the promoting
of the system of preferential voting
for use by the Student Body, might
thus assist the University to set anoth
er good example to society. T believe
that we, the favored recipients of the
social heritage, owe it to society to
point, the way to the best there is.
ALUMNUS.
