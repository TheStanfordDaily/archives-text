## 
### 
A new four-cylinder, twenty-horse
power Elmore motor has recently been
installed in the coaching launch kept
at the Redwood boathouse. The launch
was purchased in 1911, and since that
time, owing to mishandling during its
first season, has been a constant
source of annoyance and irritation.
In one instance it had the bad grace to
lodge in the mud with Former Coach
Pat O'Day, who f.retted audibly as two
eights skimmed past, leaving him
stranded. In fact the the stunt of tow
ing the boat in from the fisheries has
occurred with unvarying regularity
every crew season. It is believed thai,
with the new motor, the launch will
live down its former reputation.
