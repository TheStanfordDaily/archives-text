# ROY SERVICE'S WORK IN CHINA WILL HAVE STUDENTS' SUPPORT
## Y. M. C. A. Cabinet Backs Campaign to Raise Funds to Prevent a Local Deficit and Help Maintain Cheng Tu Secretary FAMOUS COAST ATHLETE 
### 
A three-day campaign will be start
ed by the members of the Stanford Y.
M. C. A. on Monday to raise funds to
help carry on the work of the local
association and to support the work
being done by Roy Service at Cheng
Tu, China. Eight hundred dollars is
the amount desired. Of this sum five
hundred aoilars will ue used in sup
port of Service, and three hundred dol
lars for local use.
Students in American colleges of the
rank of Stanford raised $l!20,()(>(> for
the support of Y. M. C. A. work in for
eign countries last year. Of this sum
Stanford raised $!'<>. In contrast with
this $90 given toward the support of
one man by Stanford, Yale, with an
enrollment less than twice as large,
supports a college in China, with a

11. (Ileal school and hospital as auxil
iaries. Yal? students raise $11,000 to
ward the support o l ' this institution,
while Oberlin college, with 1,000 stu
dents, raises $:?,r>oo annually.
For several years both Stanford and
California have helped to support the
work of Service at Chens; Tu, the cen
ter of a population of several million
people. He is a California graduate
of the class of 190"<. He was a promi
nent undergraduate, captaining the 'or,0 r ,
varsity track team, and holding the
coast record in the half-mile for a
number of years.
His work is by no means supported
by the contributions received from
this country, for the greater part of the
expense is borne by the Chinese
themselves. Resides Service, there
are a number of Chinese secretaries
whose salaries have to be paid, athletic
grounds and a gymnasium to be kept
up, and other running expenses to be
met. All this is met by the Chinese,
and only Roy Service's salary comes
from America. The city government
save the Cheng Tu Y. M. C. A. a centr.il
l.v located building site, because of its
high regard for their efforts.
California students expect to raise
$1,000 toward the work this year. The
Stanford students who attended the
Asilomar Conference at Christmas
time, were convinced of the import
ance of the project and determined to
approach nearer this sum than last
year. The whole proposition of rais
ing the money is a student affair,
adopted by the cabinet of the Y. M. C.
A. at its first meeting of the semester.
To promote the campaign seven
teams have been organized to push for
ward the work of collecting cont.ri-
