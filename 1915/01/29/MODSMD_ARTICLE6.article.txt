Three members were elected to the
Student Council last evening by the
University Conference. They are T. E.
Workman, *15, G. W. Bedeau, '15, and
A. E. Worthy, '15. W. G. Paul, 'ir>, was
chosen secretary of the Conference.
The new officers will succeed those
temporarily elected two weeks ago.
The new Council members will serve
with O. H. Castle, '14, and C. C. Close,
'14, who were elected last fall.
A. E. Worthy is a delegate from the
Law department, and Workman, Paul,
and Bedeau are representatives-at
large on the Conference, the latter be
ing one of those elected last Tuesday.
It was thought fit at the meeting
last night to republish the Conference
ruling regarding roughing at dances.
The rule, as amended last fall, reads:
"All .roughing at dances is prohibited,
and the Student Council is instructed
to rigidly enforce this rule."
