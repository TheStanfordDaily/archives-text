# DEFECTIVE FLUE CAUSE OF EARLY MORNING FIRE
## CAMPUS AROUSED TO BATTLE AGAINST FLAMES. Insurance Covers Damage Done to Sigma Chi House by Last Night's Blaze. 
### 
A fire which for a time threatened
to get lieyond control and destroy the
entire building was discovered in the
interior of the Sigma Chi fraternity
house shortly before one o'clock this
morning. The men living in the house
who were aroused by warning cries
and suffocating clouds of smoke, set
to work with hand extinguishers and
garden hose to attack the flames,
which had already gained considerable
headway. The Sigma Chis were soon
reinforced by a host of men from all
over the campus, who were sum
moned by the power house whistle
and shouts of "fire!" The new arriv
als were clad only in night garments
or hastily-donned clothes. The campus
volunteer fire department dragged the
hose cart to the scene, and two
streams of water drenched the flames
until they were extinguished.
The fire probably originated in a
defective flue leading from the kitch
en range. The flames crept in between
the walls of the chimney and the sur
rounding partitions, and ate their way
to the roof. The fire was discovered
by one of the men in the house who.
fortunately, had stayed up to study,
and gave the alarm. A wet roof,
soaked by the downpour of the past
week, was undoubtedly a factor in pre
venting a more rapid spread of the
flames.
The building was considerably dam
aged both by fire and water. All loss
es, however, to the house and furnish
ings are fully covered by insurance.
The smoke and water ruined many ar
ticles of clothing, and other personal
belon cities.
The house manager is enjoying tem
porary relief from abuse, since the
culinary department has suspended
business. The boys are at present
"boarding out" among kind friends on
