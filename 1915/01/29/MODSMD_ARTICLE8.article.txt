## Ralph Arnold, '99, Prominent in Oil and Geologic World, Is Second Stanford Graduate to Be Made University Trustee TWO MEMBERS RE-ELECTED 
### 
Ralph Arnold, '99, was this after
noon elected a member of the Board
of Trustees of the University, at the
regular meeting of that body held in
San Francisco. His election fills the
vacancy created by the death of
Charles G. Lathrop. Charles P. Eells,
vice-president of the Board, and Wil
liam Babcock, whose term expired
January 7, were re-elected. Vice-P.res
ident Eells' services have been of es

financial matters. He is said to be the
director of more corporations than
any other San Francisco man. William
Babcock, of San Rafael, is one of San

been a great factor on the board, in
view of his legal knowledge.
Arnold is the second alumnus now
on the Board of Trustees, and is the
first that was chosen primarily be

affairs. Herbert C. Hoover, '95, is the
only other trustee who is a Stanford
graduate. Today's election is the first
since 1912, when William Mayo
Newhall, the present executive of the
Board, Frank Barstow Anderson, and
H. C. Hoove.r were elected.
Close connection with Stanford for
nine years has given Arnold an ac

A. B. 5 n (he Geology department in
1599; took his M. A. in 1900, and was
given the degree of Ph. D. in 1902. He
was assistant in minerology in his Se

director and instructor in physics and
chemistry at Hoitt's school, in iMenlo
Park, for one year, returned to Stan
ford, where he held the position of
assistant in Geology until 1903. Since
