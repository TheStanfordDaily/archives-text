## Ralph Arnold, '99, Prominent in Oil and Geologic World, Is Second Stanford Graduate to Be Made University Trustee TWO MEMBERS RE-ELECTED 
### 
Ralph Arnold, '99, was this after
noon elected a member of the Board
of Trustees of the University, at the
regular meeting of that body held in
San Francisco. His election fills the
vacancy created by the death of
Charles G. Lathrop. Charles P. Eells,
vice-president of the Board, and Wil
liam Babcock, whose term expired
January 7, were re-elected. Vice-P.res
ident Eells' services have been of es
pecial value as a trustee in regard <:o
financial matters. He is said to be the
director of more corporations than
any other San Francisco man. William
Babcock, of San Rafael, is one of San
Francisco's leading lawyers, and has
been a great factor on the board, in
view of his legal knowledge.
Arnold is the second alumnus now
on the Board of Trustees, and is the
first that was chosen primarily be
cause of his intimacy with University
affairs. Herbert C. Hoover, '95, is the
only other trustee who is a Stanford
graduate. Today's election is the first
since 1912, when William Mayo
Newhall, the present executive of the
Board, Frank Barstow Anderson, and
H. C. Hoove.r were elected.
Close connection with Stanford for
nine years has given Arnold an ac
quaintance with the academic side of
the University administration that
makes him well equipped for the po
sition of trustee. Arnold received his
A. B. 5 n (he Geology department in
1599; took his M. A. in 1900, and was
given the degree of Ph. D. in 1902. He
was assistant in minerology in his Se
nior year, and after acting as physical
director and instructor in physics and
chemistry at Hoitt's school, in iMenlo
Park, for one year, returned to Stan
ford, where he held the position of
assistant in Geology until 1903. Since
1908 Arnold has been connected with
the United States Geological Survey,
and lias acted in the capacity of field
assistant, geological aid, paleontolo
gist, and geologist.
In 1909 he entered private practice
as an oil geologist and engineer. His
success in this work has made him
well known in the oil and geological
world. At the present time he is di
recting the economic and geologic sur
vey of the oil resources of Venezuela
for the government of that country.
In his work for the United States gov
ernment Arnold had charge of the gov
ernment investigation of the oil fields
of California. Lately he has been
gradually withdrawing from the tech
nical side of his profession, in order
to devote himself to the scholarly
field. He is the author of a large num
be.r of important contributions to sci
ence.
Arnold will serve on the Board for
10 years. He is 40 years of age, and
was born in Marshalltown, lowa, com
ing to California in ISBO. His home is
in Pasadena, and place of business Los
Angeles.
