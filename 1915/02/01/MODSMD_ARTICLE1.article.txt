the room in the Engineering building,
where the committee meets, which
will show daily the relative standing
of the seven teams. The committee will
come together each day at noon time
to talk over the plans and make .re

The aim of the campaign is to put
the facts of the work at Cheng Tu, Chi
na, before every student of the Uni
versity in the next three days, and
give each student an opportunity to
contribute. Effective plans have been
laid to make it a student movement.
With the fact before him, each person
will be left free to contribute or not
as he chooses.
Cheng Tu is the capital of the pop
ulous Szechun province in western
China. The work done there by Ser
vice and his associates is through the
gymnasium and athletic fields and ed
ucational and Bible classes. He is the
only American secretary there, and is
assisted by Chinese workers. The sal
aries of all these natives and the ex
pense of the upkeep of the buildings
is borne entirely by the people ben
efitted. M.r. Service alone is sup
ported by funds coming from America.
