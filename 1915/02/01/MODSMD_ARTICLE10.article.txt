# PROFESSOR SCOTT REACHES CAMPUS THIS AFTERNOON TO TAKE UP ACTIVE WORK
## 
### 
Professor William A. Scott, of the
University of Wisconsin, arrived on
the campus this afternoon, prepara
tory to taking up his work in the Eco
nomics department tomorrow.
He is the author of several books,
the most important of them being "The
Repudiation of State Debts," and
"Money and Ranking." He took an ac
tive part in the recent campaign
which resulted in the passing of the
New Federal Reserve Act.
Professor Scott will give the course
in "Banking Problems" now presented
by Professor M. S. Wildman, head of
the Economics department.
It was the intention of the Roard of
Trustees to obtain Professor Scott in
the capacity of a regular acting mem
ber of the Economics Faculty, but the
plan was frustrated by a ruling of the
University of Wisconsin, which pre
vents its faculty members from assum
ing temporary positions in the facul
ties of other institutions.
