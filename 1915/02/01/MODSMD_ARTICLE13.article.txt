# LOOSEN YOUR PURSE STRINGS

We have often heard the opinion re
peated tliat "charity begins at home,
but does not end there." To this we
heartily agree and would add that
if there was more charity at home the
students would become accustomed to
giving and not tighten up their purse
strings every time a solicitation was
made for funds.
The Roy Service campaign starts
this evening on the campus, and will
last for three days. In this time every
man registered in the University will
be given an opportunity to contribute
to the work of Roy Service in China.
The campaign is being conducted 'jy
the Y. M. C. A., in response to urgent
appeals that have come recently from
George Sherwood Eddy and John R.
Mott for the needs of the foreign work.
Five hundred dollars is the amount to
be .raised for Roy Service, and three
hundred dollars for the local associa
tion work.
Roy Service is a California gradu
ate, and a former track captain of the
Blue and Gold team. He is the advis
ory head of the association work in
the Cheng Tu province of China, and
under him are many Chinese secretar
ies. We are told that appeal after
appeal come from the Chinese to es
tablish more Y. M. C. A. buildings in
China, in order that they have the
educational, physical, and -religious
privileges that are found in abundance
in this country. The Chinese furnish
the funds for all their work, with the
exception of paying the foreign ad
visory secretary.
At the present time California is
planning to raise $1,000 for Roy Ser
vice. The colleges and universities in
the East support the foreign work by
being responsible for the upkeep of
entire buildings. Yale, Princeton, Syr
acuse, University of Pennsylvania,
Michigan, and Oberlin are some of the
largest contributors. Last year $229,-
000 was raised for the foreign work by
the colleges of the United States. Of
this amount Stanford contributed $00.
An insignificant amount, when we
come to think of it.
The local association is over three
hundred dollars in debt at the present
time. The students have not been giv
en an opportunity to contribute to the
receipts to meet current expenditures
during the past year.
Here is a chance to start charity
work at home; there is also the privi
lege to continue it far away from
home. Loosen up the purse strings
when approached by the collectors.
