# DR. EXNER WILL LECTURE ON SEX HYGIENE WEDNESDAY
## Author and Speaker Conies Under Auspices of the Physical Training Department 
### 
Dr. M. J. Exner will lecture to the
men of the University on "Sex Hy
giene" in the Chapel on Wednesday
evening. Dr. Exner is brought to
Stanford by the Physical Training
department, in co-operation with the
Y. M. C. A.
He is the international secretary of
the Y. M. C. A. in the department of
sex education and is on the coast giv
ing a series of lectures at all the uni
versities. He comes here from Cali
fornia, and will speak at the Univer
sity of Arizona after finishing here.
Dr. Exner is a speaker of the rank of
Dr. Winfield Scott Hall, who was at
Stanford for a series of lectures last
year, and an authority on his subject.
He is the author of a book, "The Ra
tional Sex Life for Men," which has a
wide circulation.
It is impossible to secure the As
sembly Hall for bis talk on Wednes
day evening, because it had been pre
viously engaged before the date of his
trip to Stanford was determined, and
so it will be necessary for him to speak
in the Chapel.
Resides the Wednesday night lec
ture, Dr. Exner will speak to the men
in the gymnasium classes in the af
ternoon between 5 and 6 o'clock. The
evening talk will be given at 7:30.
