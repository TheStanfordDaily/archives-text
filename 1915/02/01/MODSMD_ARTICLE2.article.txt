# FACULTY COMMITTEES TO ACT ON THE FRESHMAN CONTROVERSY SELECTED
## Representatives Will Settle Question of Restoring the Intercollegiate Freshman Game. 
### 
The Faculty committee representing
Stanford and California who will dis
cuss the matter of restoring the Fresh
man intercollegiate have been ap
pointed by the presidents of the two
Universities, but no time has been set
for conference between them. Stan
ford will be represented by Dr. Frank
Angell, chairman of the Faculty Com
mittee on Athletics, Professor E. D.
Adams, and Professor A. T. Murray.
The last two have never been asso
ciated in an official way with the re
lations of the Universities, but have
been interested fn athletics. Each has
had a son on a Stanford team during
the past year.
California will be represented by
Dean David P. Barrows, Professor T.
M. Putnam, and Professor M. C. Lynch.
Professor Putnam is a former chair
man of the Committee on Athletics.
Professor Lynch has succeeded him
and is the present chairman.
The only question to come before the
faculty committees in interests of in
tercolleg'ate peace is that of restoring
of the Freshman game, abolished by
Stanford. The time of their confer
ence will be decided this evening.
