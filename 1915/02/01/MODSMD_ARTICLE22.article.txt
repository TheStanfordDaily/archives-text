"It's all right to tell 'em about my
line of talk." he said, "but when it
comes to gossiping about our eats, 1
must draw the line. Now, the.re never
was better meat in the world than
what we're handing out right now.
Isn't that wonderful bread and but
ter? I went to a lot of trouble to get
that —I have it imported from San
Francisco. We had a special icebox
made for it. The butter, not the bread.
Now, take that Worcestershire sauce—
that's shipped direct from Worcester
shire Square in London. Made fa
mous by Tipperary? Yes. that's the
place. Did you ever see anything
purer than that water —not a drop of
benzoate of soda. Not a drop! No. sir,
you don't have to fletcherize here.
That feature story last week was a
beef, I tell you. Our spring lamb is
our strong point. See here, how it,
springs. That's as tender as, —well,
there's no analogy or simile I can
j construct just this minute. But I tell
you one thing. I never brag, but we've
got the culinary department of the
German army beat a mile, and there's
not a man made —even if he's got a
rubber stomach—who can't get a tight
belt here!"
