French gave them the cold steel, and
they fled unnerved and in disorder. It
is officially claimed that the French
artillery destroyed a number of trench
'es along the Aisne, and that they cap
tured a position west of Soissons,
where there has been much severe
fighting of late. The French troops
are enthusiastic over their repulse of
the Teutons at Ypres. as it is reported
that,the Germans had for several days
been massing reinforcements here for
a smash at the allies.
