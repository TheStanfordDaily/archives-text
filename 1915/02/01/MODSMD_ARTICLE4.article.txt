# Large Encina Audience Applauds Bishop Gailor
## Discounts Influence of Environments on Character in Views on "Business and Morality." 
### 
"It's a Long Way to Tipperary"
served as the opening hymn yesterday
evening, at the fourth of the Sunday
evening Encina meetings this semes
ter.
Doctor Gardner introduced the
speaker, the Right Reverend Frank
Thomas Gailor, Bishop of Tennessee,
and Chancellor of the University of
the South, as "Tennessee's favorite
son." Bishop Gailor, large and deep
voiced, favorably impressed the large
group of hearers by his practical
straightforwardness in dealing with
the subject, "Business and Morality."
The substance of his talk follows:
"Business, itself, is not immoral.
The instincts of emulation and acquis
itiveness are recognized in the Bible
to be honest desires to make the most
of opportunities to get ahead. The im
moralities of business are the evil
uses of these instincts. I believe that
the dependent man will always be
with us. Fundamental inequalities
will always remain.
"The test of religion, ethics, politics,
and education, is the kind of men de
veloped by them. Struggles are nec
essary to bring out the best qualities in
men. Environment plays one small
part in the process.
