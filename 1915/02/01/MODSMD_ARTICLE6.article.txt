# "NEWSPAPER REPORTS MY PRIVATE OPINION"
## CHANCELLOR JORDAN'S STATEMENTS ARE MERELY HIS EXPRESSION OF POSSIBILITY. "NOT OFFICIAL IN ANY WAY" THINKS THE EXECUTIVE SHOULD COME FROM FACULTY OR ALUMNI. 
### 
Certain newspapers have recently
published statements reputed to have
been made by Chancellor Jordan, in
Los Angeles, averring that Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur, head of the Stanford Med
ical School, will probably be chosen
as the next President of the Universi
ty.
Chancellor Jordan today admitted
making such statements to certain
alumni privately, not officially, and
simply as his forecast of the probabili
ty, as he shares the general belief that
some one connected with the Universi
ty should be the successor of Dr.
Branner, who is unwilling to serve af
ter the current year.
Dr. Jordan further stated that he
has no knowledge of when the selec
tion will be made, nor does he advo
cate any particular person beyond a
belief that the place can best be filled
from the ranks of the Faculty or alum
ni.
Chancellor Jordan left the campus
January 21 to lecture in the interests
of world peace before audiences in
Santa Barbara, Pasadena, Riverside,
Fullerton, and Los Angeles. In the
latter city he addressed the Economics
Club; spoke at the Commencement ex
ercises of the Polytechnic High School,
and was the guest of honor at a ban
quet given last Monday by the Stan
ford Club of Los Angeles. Forty
alumni were present at that gathering,
where, Chancellor Jordan declared to
day, he "had a fine dinner and a fine
time."
This Southern California trip has
been hitherto made annually. This re
cent tour, however, was the first in
three years, due to absence in Europe
during 1913 and part of 1914.
Chancellor Jordan leaves the cam
pus February 4 to lecture in Alame
da, and on February 23 before the Cos
mopolitan Club of the University of
California. In July, unless present
plans are changed, he will journey
east, to speak in summer meetings in
Colorado and Oklahoma, returning to
attend the various congresses at the
Exposition In six of these he has
charge of Peace Day.
