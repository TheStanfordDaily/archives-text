# "PILLARS OF SOCIETY" SETS BIG ADVANCE SALE RECORD FOR MASQUERS
## 
### 
The advance sale of tickets for the
Masquers' play, "Pillars of Society,"
which opened today at the campus
Hookstnre and at Weingartner's drug
store, in Palo Alto, has been excep
tionally heavy. The figures reported
are the largest since the seat sale
for"The Only Way," whose success
the coming Ibsen play promises to du
plicate. There can now be no ques
tion concerning the box-office value
of an established dramatic success on
he local boa i ds,as the play is presented
by an experienced cast.

During the past week daily rehear
sals have been held under the direc
tion of F. L. Mathieu, of San Francis
jo, and the players have mastered
their lines and the various bits of
stage "business" in a manner that in
sures the performance of real merit
in the Assembly Hall Friday evening.
"The P : llars of Society" has the
most intricate plot of all Ibsen's so
cial dramas. It is vivid with exciting
action and an enthralling suspense is
objective and concrete. Moreove.r, it

happens on the stage and not within
the souls of the participants, as do
many of the greatest modern drama
tist's later works. "The P ilars of
Society" is the most effective of all
Ibsen's plays. In form and subject
matter it is particularly pertinent to
the American of today, for the repu
tation of many of our "Pillars of So
ciety" are built upon the shifting
sands, and social masks and lies have
recently been the subject of frequent
criticisms.
Romance and comedy are skillful
ly woven in the powerful Ibsen plot
of tlie "Pillars of Society." The ro
mantic element will be sustained, for
the most part, in the character of
"Martha" (Miss Terese Dorroh, 'I<>,)
"Dina Dorf" (Miss Florence Stewart,
M6.) "Johan Tonnesen" (J. C. Cross,
M7.) and "Lona Hessel"' (Miss Mar
gery Bailey, M4,).
Ibsen has created few characters
of the sympathy which "Martha" com
mands in tlrs play. As the sister of
"Consul Bernick" (F. C. McColloch,
M7,> Martha has spent her life in the
small village on the Norwegian coast,
devoting herself to good work and the
care of "Dina." Her romance with
"Johan" is beautifully pictured, and
her nobility is the very spirit of self
sacrifice. "Martha" is more charac
terstical Ba.rr'e than Tbsen. Miss Dor
roh lends a charm and sympathy to
"Martha" that is as winning as it is
unusual.
"Dina Dorf" is a very different role
than the delightful ingenues with
which Miss Florence Stewart has been
previously identified. Pathos and
fierce temperament will enhance the
interest of her scenes with "Johan."
and Miss Stewart is setting a new
standard for herself in this fascinat
ing .role.
Miss Margery Bailey plays "Lona"
just as she should be. with perfect na
ture and perfect art, marking all that
she says and does with a beautiful se
renity. The vitality and reality of
"Lona" are charmingly conveyed by
Miss Bailey in a manner that will leave
a lasting impression.
Tickets for"The Pillars of Society"
will remain on sale at the Bookstore
and at Weingartner's, in Palo Alto, un
til the even'ng of Friday, February ">,

"Martha" that is as winning as it is
unusual.
"Dina Dorf" is a very different role
than the delightful ingenues with
which Miss Florence Stewart has been
previously identified. Pathos and
fierce temperament will enhance the
interest of her scenes with "Johan."

Miss Margery Bailey plays "Lona"
just as she should be. with perfect na

she says and does with a beautiful se

"Lona" are charmingly conveyed by
Miss Bailey in a manner that will leave
a lasting impression.

The advance sale of tickets for the
Masquers' play, "Pillars of Society,"
which opened today at the campus
Hookstnre and at Weingartner's drug
store, in Palo Alto, has been excep
tionally heavy. The figures reported
are the largest since the seat sale
for"The Only Way," whose success
the coming Ibsen play promises to du
plicate. There can now be no ques

of an established dramatic success on

by an experienced cast.

During the past week daily rehear
sals have been held under the direc

their lines and the various bits of
stage "business" in a manner that in
sures the performance of real merit
in the Assembly Hall Friday evening.
"The P : llars of Society" has the
most intricate plot of all Ibsen's so

action and an enthralling suspense is
objective and concrete. Moreove.r, it

the souls of the participants, as do
many of the greatest modern drama
tist's later works. "The P ilars of
Society" is the most effective of all
Ibsen's plays. In form and subject
matter it is particularly pertinent to
the American of today, for the repu
tation of many of our "Pillars of So
ciety" are built upon the shifting
sands, and social masks and lies have
recently been the subject of frequent
criticisms.
Romance and comedy are skillful
ly woven in the powerful Ibsen plot
of tlie "Pillars of Society." The ro
mantic element will be sustained, for
the most part, in the character of
"Martha" (Miss Terese Dorroh, 'I<>,)
"Dina Dorf" (Miss Florence Stewart,
M6.) "Johan Tonnesen" (J. C. Cross,
M7.) and "Lona Hessel"' (Miss Mar
gery Bailey, M4,).
Ibsen has created few characters
of the sympathy which "Martha" com
mands in tlrs play. As the sister of
"Consul Bernick" (F. C. McColloch,
M7,> Martha has spent her life in the
small village on the Norwegian coast,
devoting herself to good work and the
care of "Dina." Her romance with
"Johan" is beautifully pictured, and
her nobility is the very spirit of self
sacrifice. "Martha" is more charac
