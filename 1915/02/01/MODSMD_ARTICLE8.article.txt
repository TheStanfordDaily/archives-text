The advance sale of tickets for the
Masquers' play, "Pillars of Society,"
which opened today at the campus
Hookstnre and at Weingartner's drug
store, in Palo Alto, has been excep
tionally heavy. The figures reported
are the largest since the seat sale
for"The Only Way," whose success
the coming Ibsen play promises to du
plicate. There can now be no ques
tion concerning the box-office value
of an established dramatic success on

by an experienced cast.

During the past week daily rehear

tion of F. L. Mathieu, of San Francis

their lines and the various bits of
stage "business" in a manner that in
sures the performance of real merit
in the Assembly Hall Friday evening.
"The P : llars of Society" has the
most intricate plot of all Ibsen's so
cial dramas. It is vivid with exciting
action and an enthralling suspense is
objective and concrete. Moreove.r, it
