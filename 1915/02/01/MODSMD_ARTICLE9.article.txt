## EASTERN EDUCATOR CHOOSES "COLLEGE LIFE" AS HIS SUBJECT. SCHEDULED FOR 10:15 TOMORROW TICKETS MAY BE OBTAINED AT REGISTRAR'S OFFICE UNTIL 9:45 A.M. 
### 
Dr. Andrew Fleming West, Dean of
the Graduate College of Princeton
University, will be the principal speak
er at a University Assembly, to be held
at 10:15 in the Assembly Hall. It is
hoped that Bishop Gailor, who is now
acting as University preacher for five
weeks, will be present also.
The subject of Dean West's address
will be "College Life," and he will deal
in an attractive manner, with subjects
of general interest to students and
with conditions with which college
men and women are constantly
brought in contact. The speaker is
well informed on his subject, having
been connected with academic affairs
for thirty years. His personal experi
ences furnish him with an ample
store of anecdotes with which to illus
trate his talk.
Doctor West is known as a brilliant
public speaker, and is in great demand
throughout the East. His present visit
to California is in connection with a
series of lectures which he will give
at Pomona College. In 1906, a few
weeks before the great earthquake, he
made an assembly address which at
tracted much favorable comment at
the time, and is still remembered
by campus dwellers.
Doctor West has been a professor of
Latin since 1883 and Dean of the
Graduate School since 1901 of Prince
ton University. He took his A. R de
gree from Princeton in 1874, his Ph. D.
in ISS2, and his LL. D. in 1897. He re
ceived the Classical Fellowship from
his Alma Mater in 1874. He was chair
man of the American Classical Studies
in Rome from 1901-191?), and is a mem
ber of the National Institute of A.rts
and Letters. He is the author of many
works, mostly classical in nature, the
latest being "The Graduate College nf
Princeton University," published in
1913.
