# COMMITTEE APPOINTED TO PLAN NEW PLUNGE
## Professor Wing, Worthy and Dr. Stolz Named BOARD OF CONTROL ACTIVE Swimming Tank, Estimated to Cost $3000, Will Be Constructed Near New Gymnasium 
### 
Definite plans to proceed with the
construction of the gymnasium plunge
were made last evening by the Board
of Control of Stanford Athletic Fields
which held its annual meeting at the
home of Professor Frank Angell in
Palo Alto. The Executive Commit
tee recently voted to entrust the
building of the tank to the Board, and
the following action was taken in pur
suance of this ruling.
A committee composed of A. E.
Worthy, '15, president of the Student
Body; Professor C. B. Wing, and
Gymnasium Director H. R. Stolz, '09,
were named to draw up the plans and
specifications. According to the esti
mate made, the plunge will cost ap
proximately $3000. The Executive
Committee appropriated $1500 of this
amount last semester from the treas
ury of the Student Body. The remain
ing $1500 will be raised by subscrip
tion, by nominal charge for use of
the tank, or by a season ticket plan,
by which students may purchase
blocks of tickets at reduced rates.
The Board of Trustees originally
planned an aeration plant for filtering
the shower water to be used in the
gymnasium, and this body recently
provided for the enlargement of this
plant, to supply water for the plunge
as well, by an adidtional appropria
tion of $1000.
The tank will probably occupy the
triangular plot of ground situated be
tween the new Gymnasium, the track
house, and the cartrack. Rough plans
show the dimensions to be 100 feet
by 50 feet, with an average depth of
6 feet. The deepest part of the tank
will allow 10 feet of water, and the
floor will gradually rise to give a 4-
foot level at the shallow end.
