# GET-TOGETHER
## 
### 
Long, long ago when the 1915 class
were Freshmen a get-together affair
was very popular. This was commonly
known as a jolly-upâ€”most informal of
affairs. Silks and satins were tabooed.
Rough-neck attire was absolutely es
sential. In the course of human events
the jolly-up has become more or less
popular, especially for the upper class
es. it. is customarily held once a se
mester by each class, but the attend
ance and interest has declined mate
rially. We remember the time not long
ago that one class had to telephone
for girls before a jolly-up could be
held. Certainly, a sad state of af
fairs! The secret of the failing suc
cess of the one-time popular get-to
gether is the fact that many other so
cial functions are held on the same
date, and draw the interest from the
class functions.
The real purpose of the jolly-up is:
first, to increase class enthusiasm;
and second, to get acquainted with
each other within the class. There is
no other function in the University
that so adequately meets these pur
poses.
In order to overcome the failure of
the past we would suggest that three
jolly-ups be planned for the same
night, and all other dates be cancelled
on that evening. The Freshmen could
hold a first-year gathering in the
Armory in Palo Alto; the Sophomores
could probably secure the Women's
Club House; and an upperclass .jolly-
u i> might be arranged for the Juniors
and Seniors in Encina C'ub Room. Ar
rangements could be made and all con
flict of dates eliminated if the chair
men of the various class jolly-up com
mittees could arrange such a plan.
