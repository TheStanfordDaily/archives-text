# NEVER AGAIN
## 
### 
Seniors were conspicious by their
absence from the front seats at this
morning's Assembly. Five rows of
emptiness stared the speaker in the
face. It i« lots easier to talk to an
audience which sits in the very front
scats than to one which leaves an un
comfortable distance between the plat
form and the first row of occupied
chairs. The University lias a cherished
tradition that the Senior men take the
front seats at all assemblies. This tra
dition has passed into oblivion during
the past three University gatherings.
Let the Seniors remember the custom
and take a back scat—no more.
