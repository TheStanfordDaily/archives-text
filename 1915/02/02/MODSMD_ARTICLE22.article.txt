# RAIN CAUSES TEMPORARY PAUSE IN IMPROVEMENTS
## 
### 
A week of intermittent rain is re
sponsible for a temporary pause in
the execution of the campus beauti
ful plan. Practically nothing further
can he done towards filling in the
court behind the Assembly Hall, Li
brary, and History Building, or to
wards planting trees around the other
buildings until weather conditions im
prove.
Completion of work on the old au
tomobile road is delayed by the pres
ent unfriendly attitude of Jupiter Plu
vius, which has also caused a cessa
tion in the annual spring cultivation
of the arboretum and other portions
of the campus.
A good road may take the place of
the quagmire which now runs along
the side of the Stanford Union, and
past the Forge Building.
