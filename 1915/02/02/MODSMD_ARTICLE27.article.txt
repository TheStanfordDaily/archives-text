# ANTI-FRATERNITY BILL WILL AFFECT STANFORD
## 
### 
Contrary to general belief on the
campus, the anti-fraternity bill in
troduced by Assemblyman Milton
Schmitt, of San Francisco, into the
lower house of the state legislature,
which will come up for debate when
the legislature reconvenes in March,
will affect Stanford.
The bill, which s offered as an
amendment to the act passed in 1909,
directed against high school frater
nities, makes it a misdemeanor for any
student enrolled in an educational in
stitution supported in whole or in
part by the state, or any educational
institution exempt from paying taxes
to the state to organize, become a
member of, or solicit membership in
any secret fratern ty, sorority, club, t:
society.
A subsequent clause states that
nothing in the bill shall be construed
to prevent any student from becom
ing a member of the Native Sons,
Foresters, or any sinrlar organization.
Not only the University of Califor
nia and Stanford would be affected by
this measure, but it would include
the University of Southern California,
Pomona, Occidental, and all other col
leges.
Chances for the passage of the bill
arecomparativelyslight.it is claimed.
Several of the members of the com
mittee on universities, to which the
bill has been referred, expressed them
selves as heartily in favor of univer
sity fraternities. Should the bill suc
cessfully pass the committee.it would
meet the determined .resistance of the
college graduates and fraternity mem
bers on the floor of the house.
The passage of the Schmitt act
would debar from Stanford approx
imately five hundred men, belonging
to the nineteen local chapters of na
tional fraternities, and two. hundred
and f ! fty women, holding membership
in the nine campus sororities.
The State University would be af
fected to an even greater extent, there
being about one thousand students
who would be expelled from college if
the law should pass.
The combined values of the Stan
ford clubhouse properties totals $325.-
000, or thereabouts. At Berkeley the
holdings of the clubs and fraternities
are worth in the neighborhood of
$400,000.
The movement against high school
fraternities has received the appro
bation of a large number of national
college fraternities. The Phi Delta
Theta fraternity, at its latest national
convention, passed a law to take ef
fect three or four years hence, forbid
ding the initiation of any college man
who belongs to a high school frater
nity. Other fraternities are contem
plating this move.
The state law now in operation is
said to be laxly enforced, many high
school fraternities leading an un
troubled existence in the southern
part of the state.

The movement against high school
fraternities has received the appro
bation of a large number of national
college fraternities. The Phi Delta
Theta fraternity, at its latest national
convention, passed a law to take ef
fect three or four years hence, forbid
ding the initiation of any college man
who belongs to a high school frater
nity. Other fraternities are contem
plating this move.
The state law now in operation is
said to be laxly enforced, many high
school fraternities leading an un
troubled existence in the southern
part of the state.
Contrary to general belief on the
campus, the anti-fraternity bill in
troduced by Assemblyman Milton
Schmitt, of San Francisco, into the
lower house of the state legislature,
which will come up for debate when
the legislature reconvenes in March,
will affect Stanford.
The bill, which s offered as an
amendment to the act passed in 1909,
directed against high school frater
nities, makes it a misdemeanor for any
student enrolled in an educational in
stitution supported in whole or in
part by the state, or any educational
institution exempt from paying taxes
to the state to organize, become a
member of, or solicit membership in
any secret fratern ty, sorority, club, t:
society.
A subsequent clause states that
nothing in the bill shall be construed
to prevent any student from becom
ing a member of the Native Sons,
Foresters, or any sinrlar organization.
Not only the University of Califor
nia and Stanford would be affected by
this measure, but it would include
the University of Southern California,
Pomona, Occidental, and all other col
leges.
Chances for the passage of the bill
arecomparativelyslight.it is claimed.
Several of the members of the com
mittee on universities, to which the
bill has been referred, expressed them
selves as heartily in favor of univer
sity fraternities. Should the bill suc
cessfully pass the committee.it would
meet the determined .resistance of the
college graduates and fraternity mem
bers on the floor of the house.
The passage of the Schmitt act
would debar from Stanford approx
imately five hundred men, belonging
to the nineteen local chapters of na
tional fraternities, and two. hundred
and f ! fty women, holding membership
in the nine campus sororities.
The State University would be af
fected to an even greater extent, there
being about one thousand students
who would be expelled from college if
the law should pass.
