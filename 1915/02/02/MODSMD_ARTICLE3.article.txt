# COSMOPOLITAN CLUBS AID PEACE, SAYS CHANCELLOR
## Trainer Maloney Speaks on War Experiences to Gathering of Students at Stillman Home. 
### 
That the Cosmopolitan clubs of this
and other countries will play an im
portant role in the restoration of
world peace in Europe, was the sub
stance of Dr. Jordan's informal talk
to the Cosmopolitan Club at the home
of Dr. Stillman last night.
Trainer H. W. Maloney told of his
experiences in the Boer war, and said:
"Whenever I think of this war, I re
alize the utter uselessness of the con
ditions as they exist in Europe to
day."
The following were elected to mem
bership: Professor H. Brown, of the
Philosophy department; W. A. Potts.
X. Chang, and P. Ling.
The next meeting of the club will
be held at the home of Professor E.
W. Krehbiel, and at which Dr. Jor
dan will again be the principal speak
er.
