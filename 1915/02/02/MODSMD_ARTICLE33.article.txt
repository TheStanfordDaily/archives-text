PARIS, Feb. 2. â€”The Patricias, a
crack Canadian .regiment, today bore
the brunt of a serious charge to the
west of La Bassee, south of Arras.
They hurled the Germans back with
serious losses and then delivered a
counter attack, capturing a position
on a canal, which the Germans have
occupied throughout the week. This is
the first news from the firing line of
the actions of the Canadian troops.
