# Health-Seekers' Fast Passes Forty-Sixth Day
## Medical Profession Takes Active Interest in Palo Altan's Self-Inflicted Starvation. 
### 
R. C. Roth, the Palo Alto tailor,
who is undergoing an indefinite self
imposed fast to cure a digestive ail
ment, passed his forty-sixth day with
out food yesterday. He is not quite
ready to break the fast, but expects to
reach his goal, the cleansing of his en
tire system pf all impurities, within
the next few days. The nervy tailor's
tongue is clearing, and with the first
trace of returning hunger he will
break the long period of starvation
with a teaspoonful of orange juice.
Except for a slight loss of weight
Roth appears to have undergone
slight physical change in the past
week. His pulse still remains slightly
above normal, and his temperature
sub-normal. Mentally, he is as active
and keen, or, as he believes, much
keener, than before December 16, the
day he last tasted food. Microscopic
examinations of his blood disclose
only vague traces of an anemic con
dition
Roth still remains under the daily
observation of the Chemistry depart
ment. F. H. Eldred, gr., is making the
analytical tests, under the direction of
Professor Swain.
Physicians are now watching Roth
with interest, as his case progresses,
and doctors, reporters, and curious
visitors make daily calls.
