The first day of the Service cam
paign ended at noon and the captains
of the seven teams busy gathering
funds reported a total of $377.75 col
lected. The report of the teams in
detail appears above.
Great enthusiasm was seen among
the eighty men who collected in the
basement of the engineering building
for luncheon. With the first day of
the campaign ended nearly half of the
sum had been raised, and the belief is
general that the $800 originally de
sired will be exceeded. The facts re
main, however, that all the contribu
tions from the men active in the cam
paign have already been received, ana
the remainder of the money will be
more difficult to collect.
Sherwood Eddy, student secretary
of the Y. M. C. A. movement in Asia,
who lectured at Stanford last year,
has personally commended the Ser
vice campaign and the work of Roy
Service in China. He says in part,
writing from the steamship Mongolia:
"I am on my way to America, after
five months in China. You are to be
congratulated on your splendid repre
sentative, Roy Service, of Cheng Tu,
in the great province of Szecliuen.
There he stands at the center and hub
of that, great province, numbering
something like sixty-eight millions of
people, the largest province in all
China. The association's athletics,
educational, and lecture departments,
and its social, moral, and religious
points of contact enable it to reach the
leaders of the whole community. Dur
ing the last three months audiences
of students admitted by tickets only
have averaged three thousand a night.
