# DEAN WEST DEFINES MEANS OF ACQUIRING REAL COLLEGE LIFE
## Essentials of Education Are Result of True Relation Between Studies and Environing Influences 
### 
After a few words of greeting from
Bishop Gailor, of Tennessee, Dr. An
drew Fleming West, Dean of the Grad
uate College of Princeton University,
pointed out the means of acquiring
the essentials of true education in the
Assembly Hall this morning. "College
Life" was the theme of Dean West,
who treated the various phases of his
subject in a manner to leave a last
ing impression.
"I esteem it a very high privelege
to bring you a greeting from the Univer
sity of the south at Sewanee, Tennes
see," declared Bishop Gailor, "particu
larly to a university so young as Le
land Stanford, and which has never
theless taken such a high place among
the universities of the country. One
of our difficulties today is that many
American people do not want to be
educated. The public schools depend
very largely for their enthusiastic sup
port upon the universities and col
leges of the country. The reason that
New England has done so much for
education is not because of its excel
lent school system, but because of the
important influence of its colleges.
There is a certain obligation which
democracy owes to culture. The best
friends that democracy has ever had
a.re the men and women who havs
had the culture to spread this influ
ence of education."
Chancellor Jordan introduced Dean
West as one who had been known lov
ingly to many generations of Prince
ton men as "Andy West."
"The undergraduate side of college
life is met with one aim," explained
Dean West, "to turn boys into men
and girls into women. This fine art
is charged with the development of
the human soulâ€”training which bal
ances self-direction and intelligence.
College students are instruments used
for developing our intelligence. The
developing of intelligence is the end
of education and the object of that in
telligence is the intellectual enlight

ening and heightening of the moral side
Studies are the transformers on the
side of morality. College studies are
first in importance, and they should
he considered first by the student. If
the studies taken arc rationally re
lated to each other the highest intel
ligence may he expected to result.
"One of the difficulties in recent
academic developments, at least in
most Eastern colleges, is that undue
stress has been laid upon extra cur
riculum activity. These activities are
good in their place and in them
selves. Every young student, howev
er, is in constant danger of yielding
to the delightful comradeships of col
lefe life and enjoyments in all kinds
of varied activities in preference to
the desire for study. There is a nat
ural tendency to place activities first
and studies second as an appendage
which may be removed with little dif
ficulty. One often hears a student
picturing an El Dorado vision of col
lege life, 'What a splendid place this
would be,' he says, 'if there were no
faculty here!'
"Of cou.rse, there is something more
to the student than the mere class
room can occupy. The balancing of
the alternative rhythm between sleep
and awakening, summer .and winter,
and similar extremes, makes the well
balanced college life. The real busi
ness of college life is to develop selves
to the best womanhood and manhood
and to the highest attainments.
"One trait in the student mind ex
plains the undergraduate attitude to
ward studies. This is the feeling of
aversion to shams and pretenses. The
spirit permeating the best college life
js one that is opposed to all pendan
try in learning, cant in religion, and
pretense in friendship, 'play to the
grand-stand.' as our athletic phrasing
terms it. This perception of elemen
tal reality is a desire to get the real,
not the illusory, not the evanescent.
