# VARIOUS IMPROVEMENTS GRANTED BY TRUSTEES
## University Will Share Cost of Swimming Tank CHURCH BELLS WILL RING Contract For Paving Inner Quad Let to Wrightson, Anderson & Yostâ€”Macadam to Replace Stones 
### 
One thousand dollars was appropri
ated by the Board of Trustees at
their recent meeting toward the build
ing of the new swimming pool in con
nection with the gymnasium. The
Grounds Committee was instructed to
expend this amount in co-operation
with the Executive Committee of the
Associated Students. Under the plans
now under consideration the Execu
tive Committee believes that the pool
can be constructed for $2500, making
the student share $1500. This amount
has been appropriated.
Business Manager Stow expressed
the opinion that the swimming pool
will cost several hundred dollars more
than the proposed $2500 if the present
plans are used. In their action, how
ever, the Trustees make it clear that,
regardless of the total cost of con
struction, their share will be only the
$1000 just appropriated. According to
his estimate the share to be paid by
the Associated Students will be over
$2500 and another appropriation of
$rooo will be necessary.
Mr. Stow states that with a modifi
cation of the plans, a pool of the same
size, thirty by one hundred feet, can
be erected at a cost of about $2000.
Whatever specifications are adopted,
he has offered to have the pool con
structed by the University, and will
make this proposal to the committee
in charge. If this is done it probably
will result in a saving on labor and
will insure that tlie pool is satisfac
torily constructed.
The only action taken affecting in
struction in the University directly
was tlie consolidation of the Philology
and English departments. Beginning
next fall they will be combined as
the English department.
Changes in Clmreli Provided.
A change in the mosaics of the fa
cade of Memorial Church was provid
ed for at the meeting of the trustees.
The specifications for the changes
were drawn by John K. Rranner, ex
'o9, a son of President Branner. He
is a. graduate of the School of Archi
tecture of Columbia University.
The space at the base of the upper
portion of the facade was formerly oc
cupied by a dedication of the build
ing to Leland Stanford. With the re
construction of the church, a dedica
t!on inscription to Senator and Mis.
Stanford was placed on a pillar before
the doors. The former dedication was
replaced by a foreground added to the
picture above, the foreground con
sisting of a field of pond lilies.
Tliis change has never been satisfac
tory, since it violates rules of archi
tectural beauty, in that it leaves the
windows in the facade floating, with
the lily pond as their apparent sup
port. The new plans will replace
this bed of lilies with some pillar ef
fects of stone below the window, with
conventional des!siis in mosaics be
tween the pillars.
The Grounds Committee was em
powered to erect the Memorial Church
bells on the campus again. A sup
port will be erected near the vestry
and the bells placed on them. Reso
lutions requesting this action were re
cently passed by the Executive Com
mittee of the Student Body and the
Advisory Council of the Alumni Asso
ciation. Following the recent Board
action the bells will be taken from
their present position in one of the
basements of the Quad and placed
where they can be used.
Contract to Pave Inner Quad Let
The contract for paving the Inner
Quad was let to Wrightson, Ander
son & Yost, of Sacramento and Red
wood City. The large inner court and
the smaller ones at each end, just out
side of the East and West arches, will
be covered with oiled macadam. In
the area are included 106.000 square
feet to be covered.
Hettinger to Construct Building
E. A. Hettinger of Palo Alto was
the lowest bidder for the job of con
structing the new Metallurgy Build
ing and the contract was let to him.
Though a separate building, the new
structure will be near tlie present
Mining and Metallurgy Building on
the terrace south of 'the Quad and
will be used for laboratories.
