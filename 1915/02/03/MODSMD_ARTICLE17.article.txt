### 
Bishop Gailor spoke at the Y. W. C.
A. meeting yesterday, taking as his
subject "Happy Christians," and show
ing that a Christian l'fe consists in
doing cheerfully all the little duties of
life, no matter how trivial they may
seem. His message is the following:
"Be helpful and not critical, for in
each of us there is much good—not
one is all vicious. Christian religion is
a religion of liberty and freedom from
social mass. Each individual counts
for a great deal, and is responsible
for his own actions. Look straight
into the future, without fear, for you
are walking in a room of God's
house."
