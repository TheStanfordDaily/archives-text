# Sonny on Weather

### 
Stanford, Feb. 2, 15.
Dearest Ma—Noah didn't have any
thing on ns. In the words of the
Bible, "the precipitation hath contin
ued for eight days and eight nights."
It.was during this kind of weather that
one of the Sons of the Stanford lied
originated the famous saying: "Get on
the boat and keep from drowning in
your own igno, ranee." If Noah would
have come sailing down Lasuen yester
day morning with a jitney ark I'm bet
ting he would have cleared more mon
ey than was ever made around here
selling caps and gowns or filet of
soles. Those who had been saving up
for a rainy day are, or ought to be,
dead broke by now. The driest of us
are soaked through, and will have to
wait for New Year's eve to .ring us out.
There was a big crowd of roughs at
the Engineering corner yesterday
morning singing, 'And it's always wet
weather when good fellows get togeth
er." But being a Freshman I could
only watch them through a window. T
hope the roof isn't leaking the same
place it did last year. All kinds of
love, your SONNY,
S. P.—My waterproof shoes have
started to take in visitors.
