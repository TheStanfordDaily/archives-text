## 
### 
Pictures of one hundred and twen
ty-five students were taken Sunday
at Franklin's studio, in Palo Alto. This
aggregate represents the sum of some
half dozen groups, constituting various
honor societies, executive bodies, and
fraternities. The rush for the photog
rapher's followed the announcement
made by the Quad management that.
February 20 is the last day on which
Quad pictures may be taken.
