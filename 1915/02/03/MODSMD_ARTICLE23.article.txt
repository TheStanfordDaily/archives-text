# POWERFUL RENDITION OF IBSEN PLAY ANTICIPATED
## "PILLARS OF SOCIETY" READY FOR DRESS REHEARSAL Masquers' Cast is Letter-Perfect in Preparation for Initial Production of Year. 
### 
Masquers w.ll hold a dress re
hearsal ot "The Pillars of Society" in
the Assembly Hall tomorrow evening,
under the direction of F. L. Math.eu,
ut San Francisco. The players are
now letter-perfect in their lines and
stage "business," and, because of the
experience of the cast, even to the
minor characters, a particularly
smooth and interesting performance
of Ibsen's drama is anticipated Friday
evening.
F. C. McColloch, 17, is exceptional
ly well f.tted to portray the leading
male role ol the consul, "Kartten Ber
nick," who poses as the model of civic
and domestic virtues in the small Nor
wegian coast town, where lie is ac
cepted at his own estimate. "Ber
nick' is a well-known type of the hard
business man who, while professing to
work always for the good of the com
munity, never fails to further his own
financial interests. McColloch's role is
a powerful and difficult one. However,
he represents this arch-hypocrite with
a depth of appreciation and a sincerity
that is entirely convincing. "Karsten
Bernick" will be a compelling figure
in the hands of McColloch, who prom
ises to leave a lasting impression in
this splendid role.

Miss Elizabeth Taff, will appear
to unusual advantage as the consul's j
wife. '.Mrs. Bernick," a role demand- J
ing an actress of febrile temperament,
as well as skill. She plays several de- j
lightful scenes with the consul, in 1
which the domestic life of the Ber- '
nicks is faithfully pictured. Miss Taff
has the best opportunity of her local j
career in this interesting part, in
which she is expected to win new
dramatic laurels.
'Olaf," the thirteen-year son of the
Bernick household, is faithfully played j
by Richmond Edwards .of Palo Alto. ]
The misdirected youthful enthusiasm
of 'Olaf" leads to many moments of
enthralling suspense in the progress
"of the drama
L. E. Cole, '17. M. E. Tedford, *17. and
D. K. Ferguson, '18, will furnish many I
laughs as three pillars of society, who !
are associated with "Bernick" in his |
railroad schemes. "Rummel," "Vige- '
land," and "Sandstad" are vastly en
tertaining Ibsen types.
A mob scene of no ordinary interest
will bp an important feature of the last !
act of "The Pillars of Society." The !
varied characters of the Norwegian
town have been carefully rehearsed !
by Coach Mathieu, and they are expect- I
ed to rival in numbers and enthusiasm |
the trial scene in"The Only Way."
Unprecedented interest is being !
taken in the production of Friday ev
ening. and Masquers are to be con
gratulated in their selection of a play
of the popular appeal offered in"The i
Pillars of Society." Seats will remain i
on sale at the campus Bookstore and j
at Weingartner's drug store in Palo |
Alto until the evening of the perform- \
