# STANFORD FIVE LOSES TO FAST SANTA CLARA TEAM
## Mission Basketball Players Defeat Cardinals in Hard Scrimmage by 35 to 27 Score.

I
Santa Clara's fast basketball quintet
inflicted a 35 to 27 defeat last night on
the Stanford team on the court of the
Catholic institution. The game was
fast throughout, and was featured by
considerable rough playing.
During the first half, the Cardinals
held a lead in points, finishing the
round with sixteen tallies to the fif
teen of their opponents. In the sec
ond part the Catholics came back in
fine form, and outplayed the Stanford
men by hard fighting.
The contest was merely a practice
game and will not affect the standing
of Stanford in the Intercollegiate
League. Santa Clara has not entered
a team in the league because the stu
dent body of the college has broken off
all atli 1 et'c relations with St. Mary's
College, one of the active founders of
the Intercollegiate League.
Another unofficial game will be played
with the Stanford team two weeks
hence, when the Catholics send their
squad here for a Palo Alto invasion.
Blodget and Worthy were the for
wards during last night's game. Dutton
and Wallace alternated as centers.
Reynolds and Dolan began the contest
on the defensive, but the former was
replaced by Caughey in the second
half. Schwarzenbeck accompanied
the team as substitute.
