# CLUB HOUSE IS DELAYED
## RAINS PREVENT BUILDING BEING OCCUPIED 
### 
Stanford Union Will Open Its
Doors on the Original Date,
Saturday Evening—Women
to Be Received on Sunday
The directors of the Women's Club
House have postponed the date or'
opening their new building from next
Saturday evening, the time originally
planned, until Friday evening, Febru
ary 19. In spite of this fact Stanford
Union will open on the date an
nounced.
The unsettled weather conditions
have compelled the women to make a
change in their plan. Construction
work in their building was not so near
completion as in the men's building at
the beginning of the recent storm, and
the rain has prevented the work from
being finished, as it otherwise would
have been. It was not found possible
to have any of the furniture in the
building by Saturday evening, and no
heating equipment could be installed
on time to dry out the interior, so it
was believed the best policy to post
pone the opening.
No change has been made in the
plans for opening the Stanford Union,
and the doors of the men's building
will be swung wide on Saturday even
ing for all members of the campus
community and all persons connected
with the University, including former
Faculty members and students, as well
as the alumni, Faculty, Trustees, and
students of the present generation.
All persons associated with the Uni
versity are urged to be present, and no
formal invitations are being extended
to any one.
It has come to the knowledge of the
officials in charge that an impression
is abroad that only members of the
Union will be expected to attend the
opening. They wish to correct this im
pression. No formal ceremonies are
beins planned, and any one who an
ticipates dropping into the Union in
the future for a smoke and a talk with
other men of the University is expected
to call for the same purpose on Satur
day evening, if he can reach the cam
pus. All men who come can be accom
modated. The committee is planning
to receive 1000 men during the even
ing.

On Sunday afternoon the men will
hold "open house"in their now build
ing for the women of the University.
S lice the joint opening has been aban
doned, and the men will be present
on Saturday evening, the women will
be given their opportunity to view the
new building Sunday afternoon.
The newly-appointed members of the
Ctoverning Hoard of Stanford Union
will meet this evening at the Student
Vdviser's office to informally discuss
some of the matters which will come
before (hem after their appointments
have been confirmed by the Board of
Trustees of the Union. The formal ac
tion of confirming the appointments,
which is .required by the constitution,
will be taken at the meeting of

Stanford Union Will Open Its
Doors on the Original Date,
Saturday Evening—Women
to Be Received on Sunday
The directors of the Women's Club
House have postponed the date or'
opening their new building from next
Saturday evening, the time originally
planned, until Friday evening, Febru
ary 19. In spite of this fact Stanford
Union will open on the date an
nounced.
The unsettled weather conditions
have compelled the women to make a
change in their plan. Construction
work in their building was not so near
completion as in the men's building at
the beginning of the recent storm, and
the rain has prevented the work from
being finished, as it otherwise would
have been. It was not found possible
to have any of the furniture in the
building by Saturday evening, and no
heating equipment could be installed
on time to dry out the interior, so it
was believed the best policy to post
pone the opening.
No change has been made in the
plans for opening the Stanford Union,
and the doors of the men's building
will be swung wide on Saturday even
ing for all members of the campus
community and all persons connected
with the University, including former
Faculty members and students, as well
as the alumni, Faculty, Trustees, and
students of the present generation.
All persons associated with the Uni
versity are urged to be present, and no
formal invitations are being extended
to any one.
It has come to the knowledge of the
officials in charge that an impression
is abroad that only members of the
Union will be expected to attend the
opening. They wish to correct this im
pression. No formal ceremonies are
beins planned, and any one who an
ticipates dropping into the Union in
the future for a smoke and a talk with
other men of the University is expected
to call for the same purpose on Satur
day evening, if he can reach the cam
pus. All men who come can be accom
modated. The committee is planning
to receive 1000 men during the even
ing.

On Sunday afternoon the men will
hold "open house"in their now build
ing for the women of the University.
S lice the joint opening has been aban
doned, and the men will be present
on Saturday evening, the women will
be given their opportunity to view the
new building Sunday afternoon.
