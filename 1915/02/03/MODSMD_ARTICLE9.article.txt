# DO NOT BE LAST
## 
### 
The final call has been made for
Quad pictures. The manager has set
February 20 as the last day when eith
er group or individual pictures may lie
taken by the staff photographer. It is
absolutely necessary that a time limit
be placed on the tardy individuals
who like to wait until the last bell
rings before undergoing the trials of
sitting for a picture.
In order to obtain the best results
all pictures should be finished early in
the season. True it is that the book
will not lie completely printed for at
least two months, but the forms are
completed as soon as the cuts are
made. We all know that the manager
will not refuse a five-dollar fee from
a member of the class, or reservations
from an organization for a page, if
the pictures are taken after the time
limit. But it is not fair to the best
interests of the book to take the atti
tude that "I will slip it through when
I get good and ready." If the pictures
are not taken before February 20 the
photographer will necessarily have to
rush the work through, and will not
be able to put the same amount of at
tention on the photographs as he will
if they were taken within the next
two weeks.
About fifty members of the Junior
class have not signified their intention
to support the 1916 annual. A com
paratively large number of organiza
tions have put the little matter of
Quad pictures off until the last min
ute.
The Quad is essentially a book of
records. It is all important that every
club or society should be represented
in the year book. If you have not
booked a date with the photographer
try and arrange a sitting this week.
Do not be the last.
