September 15 to October 15, and 1. E.

have been a financial success during
the past semester.

months, including receipts from ad
vertising and subscriptions, shows a
total of $2486.19. Expenditures
amounted to $2223.22. This shows a
net income of $202.97, which when
added to an unpresented check,
brings the semester's gain up to
$3(11.37, which is deposited in cash at
the Hank of Palo Alto.
The total assets appear as follows:
Bills receivable $ 922.83
Cash on hand 301.37
Total assets $1224.20
The management of The Daily Palo
Alto is using a system of bookkeeping
which was originated for all Student
Body activities by the Graduate -Man
ager. By this system a permanent
record of all receipts and expendi
tures is kept in record form. The
manager, by a system of try-outs like
those conducted for the editorial staff
of the paper, chooses an assistant
each year, to aid him in his duties,
and to succeed to the position.
This report was accepted in full by
the Executive Committee.
The Foil and Mask Fencing socie
ty was given the sanction of the Com
mittee to arrange for a match with
representatives of the University of
California on the day of the Big Meet.

fused to participate in an unofficial

of intercollegiate sport.. The energy
