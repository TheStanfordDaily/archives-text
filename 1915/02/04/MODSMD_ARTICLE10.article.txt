# DOUBLE PROGRAM TO BE GIVEN AT ENCINA NEXT SUNDAY EVENING
## E.D. ADAMS WILL SPEAK Postponed Concert to Be Given by Stanford Band Before Talk on Student Government 
### 
I'rofessor E. I). Adanis will be the
speaker at the fifth of the Sunday ev-

emng scries of talks
for men in Encina
Clubrooni at eight
o'clock Sunday ev
ening Mefore the
lecture, between 7
and S o'clock, Stan
ford Hand will give
the first concert of
the spring season
at the clubrooms.
The concert was to
be offered on last

Sunday afternoon in the Inner Quad,
but weather conditions caused a post
ponement, and have compelled the
musicians to appear indoors on next
Sunday. The double program should
bring out a good audience of men.
Professor Adams, head of the His
tory department, will speak on "De
mocracy and Student Self-Govern
ment." He has always been a friend
of student government at Stanford,
and has been one of its strongest, de
fenders at times when, before its firm
establishment, its success seemed
doubtful.
Dr. Adams is the first member of
the Stanford Faculty to speak at one
of the Sunday night meetings, but
others of the Faculty men will be in
vited by the Y M. C. A. to talk during
the semeste..
One of the original oojects of the
series of talks was to bring the stu
dents and Faculty members together
outside of the classroom. All men of
the University, Faculty, and students
alike, are invited to attend the meet
ings. and they can mingle together
during the hour. But another way in
which this will lie accomplished is
by having the faculty men among
the speakers. Many Stanford profes
sors of nation-wide reputation are
never heard by the students not reg
istered in their department.
Dr. Adams' lecture will be of espe
cial interest to the men of the Univer
sity, in view of his subject, dealing
with a vital Stanford question. O. 11.
Castle, '1 t. president of the University
Conference, will preside at the meet
ing.
The program to be plaved by the
Band on Sunday even in sr. at its first
concert, is an unusually difficult one,
and the organization, under the lead
ership of Professor E. \V. Martin, has
devoted much of its tlm 0 this semester
to its preparation.
The second concert is scheduled for
three weeks from Sunday, and will
consist in the playing of Wagnerian se
lections only. The band will devote its


I'rof. K. I). A<liiins
time during the early part of the term
to preparation and giving of concerts,
but later plans to turn out at the
games.

Hail, Stanford, Hail.
I'rofessor E. I). Adanis will be the
speaker at the fifth of the Sunday ev-

emng scries of talks
for men in Encina
Clubrooni at eight
o'clock Sunday ev
ening Mefore the
lecture, between 7
and S o'clock, Stan
ford Hand will give
the first concert of
the spring season
at the clubrooms.
The concert was to
be offered on last

Sunday afternoon in the Inner Quad,
but weather conditions caused a post
ponement, and have compelled the
musicians to appear indoors on next
Sunday. The double program should
bring out a good audience of men.
Professor Adams, head of the His
tory department, will speak on "De
mocracy and Student Self-Govern
ment." He has always been a friend
of student government at Stanford,
and has been one of its strongest, de
fenders at times when, before its firm
establishment, its success seemed
doubtful.
Dr. Adams is the first member of
the Stanford Faculty to speak at one
of the Sunday night meetings, but
others of the Faculty men will be in
vited by the Y M. C. A. to talk during
the semeste..
One of the original oojects of the
series of talks was to bring the stu
dents and Faculty members together
outside of the classroom. All men of
the University, Faculty, and students
alike, are invited to attend the meet
ings. and they can mingle together
during the hour. But another way in
which this will lie accomplished is
by having the faculty men among
the speakers. Many Stanford profes
sors of nation-wide reputation are
never heard by the students not reg
istered in their department.
Dr. Adams' lecture will be of espe
cial interest to the men of the Univer
sity, in view of his subject, dealing
with a vital Stanford question. O. 11.
Castle, '1 t. president of the University
Conference, will preside at the meet
ing.
The program to be plaved by the
Band on Sunday even in sr. at its first
concert, is an unusually difficult one,
and the organization, under the lead
ership of Professor E. \V. Martin, has
devoted much of its tlm 0 this semester
to its preparation.
The second concert is scheduled for
three weeks from Sunday, and will
consist in the playing of Wagnerian se
lections only. The band will devote its


I'rof. K. I). A<liiins
time during the early part of the term
to preparation and giving of concerts,
but later plans to turn out at the
games.
The program for Sunday's concert
follows:
