# 1915

### 
The selection yesterday of the Se
nior Week officials and committees
for the class of 1915 brings home once
again to Seniors the realization that
their undergraduate days are indeed
numbered. Days of graduation are no
longer a dream to the fourth-year stu
dents. The weeks are numbered be
fore classmates scatter to the four
corners of the earth. And as we think
of the work that is to be accomplished
within this short space of time to
make Senior Week a success, we real
ize that there is only one solution to
the problem; every Senior must do his
or her part. The burdens and pleas
ures should be ho.rne jointly by all.
With the last semester of under
graduate life there comes a true spirit
of unity. Perhaps it comes for the
reason that the days at Stanford are
numbered. Perhaps it comes because
each Senior realizes that the members
of the class must pull together in or
der to make the 1915 class equal to, if
not better, than the best graduating
class that the University has yet had
the pleasure of smiling upon.
No class can attain the fullest un
derstanding of this spirit of united
effort until the last year; it is the
spirit of the Senior classes in general.
Then comes days of retrospection.
Then the experiences of the past with
its • mistakes and successes become
the foundation for the crowning effort
of the class.
Senior week is a monument erected
by the Senior class to its undergrad
uate accomplishments. With the ap
pointment of committees the ground is
broken; and construction work is
started. The progress of this con
struction depends entirely on the per
sonnel of the committees. Committee
chairmen must necessarily bear the
brunt of the burdens and pleasures,
but they are merely the supports to
the structure which will be erected
within the next three months to the
name of the class of 1915. The frame
work is an essential part, but by no
means the entire building. In the
same way the committee chairmen are
an integral part in constructing the
plans for Senior Week, but their ef
forts will be fruitless unless the com
mitteemen lend every assistance pos
sible in originating ideas, planning
and perfecting the various schemes.
Appointment to the committees is one
of a college honors, but the responsi
bility intrusted by the class to these
individuals is of far greater signifi
cance. Active co-operation insures
the success of Senior Week.
