# REPORT OF MANAGER OF THE DAILY PALO ALTO
## 
### 
Report of The Daily Palo Alto for
four months, September 1, 1911. to
January 19, 1915. (A month is 20 is
sues of the paper):
The paper has been enlarged from a
four-column to a five-column paper.
The space of the paper has been in
creased 50'/f. The management has
been in the hands of three men during
this period. From September 1 to
September 15, 1914, Fred L. Foster,
'13, was manager. From September
15, to October 15, E. C. Able was man
ager pro tem, being appointed by the
Executive Committee. From October
15 to the present time, I. E. Farrar,
15, has been manager. The last
named manager was appointed perma
nent manager by the Executive Com
mittee, to take the place left vacant by
the resignation of F. L. Foster.
The paper has inaugurated a system
of bookkeeping that was originated by
It. W. Wilcox for the student organi
zations. My this system, a permanent
record of all receipts and expendi
tures is kept.
The management of tb" paper has
been placed on much the same basis
as has the editorial side of the paper.
That is, the manager, by a system of
try-outs, each year chooses an as
sistant who is to be nominated by
the manager to succeed him when he
shall be through managing the paper.
I might add that the paper cannot be
said to be a financial success, due to
the changes in the management. The
three changes have caused losses which
cannot be made up, nor can some of
them he accounted for. In a separate
statement, I will try to account for
the losses.
The income has been as follows:
Sept. 1-15, F. L. Foster, manager.
Advertising $ 7.95
Subscriptions 819.75
Sept. 15-Oct. 15', E. C. Able, manager.

Foster $ 827.70

Farrar 1079.79
It is to be .remembered that the sub
scriptions are mostly all collected at
the beginning of the semester, and
that the accounts fall off toward the
end of the semester.
Mills receivable amount to the fol
fowing:
For advertising run from Oct.
15 to the present date $ 422.83
(This amount is to be collect
ed and is for advertising
that has been run since the
15th of October)
The amount of subscriptions
outstanding is 500.00
(This amount must be ap
proximated, but that amount,
is a conservative estimate
for the amount to be col
lected during the balance of
the year)
Total bills receivable $922.83
(Advertising to be run during the
rest, of the semester is not included
in this amount).
Expenditures.
Sept. 1-15, F. L. Foster, man

Unpresented check drawn by
F. L. Foster. No. 211 38.40
$2524.59

Subtracting the unpresented
check 38.40
We have the total income ..$2486.19
(As a matter of explanation: this
check, No. 211, was drawn by F. L.
Foster, but was never presented, so
it must lie in one case considered as
drawn, and then it must lie reckoned
as redeposited in the bank. It. is not
really to be considered as income,
but must be used to balance).
The net income, plus the unpre
sented chock gives us the amount of
gain during the four months In cash,
which is $301.37. This is the cash on
hand in the Hank of Palo Alto. Add
ing the bills receivable to the amount
of cash on hand we have the total
assets of the paper at the present time,
which is:
Hills receivable $ 922.83
Cash on hand 301.37
Total assets $1294.20
This report is correct to the best
' of my knowledge and belief.

Manager of Tlie Daily Palo Alto.
Report of The Daily Palo Alto for
four months, September 1, 1911. to
January 19, 1915. (A month is 20 is
sues of the paper):
The paper has been enlarged from a
four-column to a five-column paper.
The space of the paper has been in
creased 50'/f. The management has
been in the hands of three men during
this period. From September 1 to
September 15, 1914, Fred L. Foster,
'13, was manager. From September
15, to October 15, E. C. Able was man
ager pro tem, being appointed by the
Executive Committee. From October
15 to the present time, I. E. Farrar,
15, has been manager. The last
named manager was appointed perma
nent manager by the Executive Com
mittee, to take the place left vacant by
the resignation of F. L. Foster.
The paper has inaugurated a system
of bookkeeping that was originated by
It. W. Wilcox for the student organi
zations. My this system, a permanent
record of all receipts and expendi
tures is kept.
The management of tb" paper has
been placed on much the same basis
as has the editorial side of the paper.
That is, the manager, by a system of
try-outs, each year chooses an as
sistant who is to be nominated by
the manager to succeed him when he
shall be through managing the paper.
I might add that the paper cannot be
said to be a financial success, due to
the changes in the management. The
three changes have caused losses which
cannot be made up, nor can some of
them he accounted for. In a separate
statement, I will try to account for
the losses.
The income has been as follows:

Report of The Daily Palo Alto for
four months, September 1, 1911. to
January 19, 1915. (A month is 20 is
sues of the paper):
The paper has been enlarged from a
four-column to a five-column paper.
The space of the paper has been in
creased 50'/f. The management has
been in the hands of three men during
this period. From September 1 to
September 15, 1914, Fred L. Foster,
'13, was manager. From September
15, to October 15, E. C. Able was man
ager pro tem, being appointed by the
Executive Committee. From October
15 to the present time, I. E. Farrar,
15, has been manager. The last
named manager was appointed perma
nent manager by the Executive Com
mittee, to take the place left vacant by
the resignation of F. L. Foster.
The paper has inaugurated a system
of bookkeeping that was originated by
It. W. Wilcox for the student organi
zations. My this system, a permanent
record of all receipts and expendi
tures is kept.
The management of tb" paper has
been placed on much the same basis
as has the editorial side of the paper.
That is, the manager, by a system of
try-outs, each year chooses an as
sistant who is to be nominated by
the manager to succeed him when he
shall be through managing the paper.
I might add that the paper cannot be
said to be a financial success, due to
the changes in the management. The
three changes have caused losses which
cannot be made up, nor can some of
them he accounted for. In a separate
statement, I will try to account for
the losses.
The income has been as follows:
