# JAPANESE MINE INSPECTOR WILL DO RESEARCH WORK
## Enrolls at Stanford in Order to Study Methods of Removing Smoke Nuisances. 
### 
Mr. Manji Yoshimura, connected
with the Japanese government as in
spector of mines, and a graduate of
the University of Tokio, has recently
registered as a graduate student in the
Chemistry department, where he is
pursuing advanced laboratory re
search work in co-operation with S. W.
Young, professor of chemistry. He is
specializing in the study of methods
to prevent smoke nuisances created by
the process of smelting copper.
The rice industry of Japan has re
ceived serious injury from the sul
phur-dioxide fumes from the copper
smelters of that country, according to
the statement of Mr. Yoshimura. For
several years the Japanese Bureau of
mines has been experimenting in
hopes of finding a satisfactory means
of removing the injurious qualities
from the sulphur-dioxide smoke.
In order to obtain further informa
tion on the subject and to study gov
ernment control over mines, Mr. Yo
shimura was sent by the Japanese gov
ernment to Berlin He pursued inves
tigations there for six months until
the present European war broke out.
when he left immediately for Lon
don. He continued his research work
there until he came to Stanford.
