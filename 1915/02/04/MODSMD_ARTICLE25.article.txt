set down in the constitution and by

college comics, for their mutual inter
est and benefit, into an association
which shall establish them in closer
connection with the advertising and
publishing business; to promote great
er efficiency through the interchange
of ideas which would be made possible
at the annual meetings; to .raise the
standard of humor and art in these
publications; to hold a banquet with
the annual meeting; to provide an
opportunity for members to hear talks
by prominent men on topics of com
mon interest, and to promote intimate
and closer relationship among the col
lege publications which will enable
them to act in the spirit of co-opera
tion, which will help them to deal suc
cessfully with their difficulties.
Ten comics were represented at the
first banqn,et, held .recently at the
Hotel Biltmore, in New York City. T.
L. Butler, of Yale, is the head of the
organization.
