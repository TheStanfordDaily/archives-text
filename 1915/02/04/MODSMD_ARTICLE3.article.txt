lows :
"It has occurred to me several
times, but until now the idea has been
kept foreign to ink and paper, that the
Union must need a clock or two or
four. Naturally the Union should
have the finest product of Yankee
clockmaking ingenuity, and that must
be one of the Ingraham products.
"Under separate cover I am send
ing forward a copy of our latest cat
alogue. Look over this and let me
know the Union's needs.
"I pray almost daily that the Lord
will let me come for the 1915 com
mencement. I want to see the red
tiles again."
The officers promptly accepted In
graham's offer. The letter telling him
of the time of opening finally reached
him on the .road, at Oklahoma City,
Okahoma. He promptly dispatched o
telegram to the home office with in
structions to send the four clocks, all
of different design, immediately by ex
press. At the same time he wrote
the following letter to E. W. Smith,
secretary of the Union:
"Your message received this morn
ing, via Bristol, and am enclosing a
copy of a telegram I have sent for
ward to the firm.
"The No. 16SI is one of our latest
clocks, and of my conception. It had
its first being as 1 was watching the
troops in Belgium last August march
ing to war. Strange at what times
ideas come to us! I hope one of these
is in stock.
"I hope to lie at Stanford for the
commencement in May, though the
fickle goddess of business may pre
vent me; but not if I can possibly
help it. I am very eager to see the
ITnion."
Ingraham has always been interest
ed in the progress and success of

fit of the Union and Women's Club

ing, the members will be fully warned
as that hour approaches each evening.
Four fine clocks are speeding across
the continent by express, the gift to
the Union of Irving 1. Ingraham, *13.
former editor of The Daily Halo Alio.
Ingraham is now traveling salesman
for the Ingraham Company, clock
manufacturers of Bristol, .Massachu
setts. a firm whose product is sold
all over the world. Some time ago he
wrote to the Union offering to send
the clocks. A part of his letter fol
lows :
"It has occurred to me several
times, but until now the idea has been
kept foreign to ink and paper, that the
Union must need a clock or two or
four. Naturally the Union should
have the finest product of Yankee
clockmaking ingenuity, and that must
be one of the Ingraham products.
"Under separate cover I am send
ing forward a copy of our latest cat
alogue. Look over this and let me
know the Union's needs.
"I pray almost daily that the Lord
will let me come for the 1915 com
mencement. I want to see the red
tiles again."
The officers promptly accepted In
graham's offer. The letter telling him
of the time of opening finally reached
him on the .road, at Oklahoma City,
Okahoma. He promptly dispatched o
telegram to the home office with in
structions to send the four clocks, all
of different design, immediately by ex
press. At the same time he wrote
the following letter to E. W. Smith,
secretary of the Union:
"Your message received this morn
ing, via Bristol, and am enclosing a
copy of a telegram I have sent for
ward to the firm.
"The No. 16SI is one of our latest
clocks, and of my conception. It had
its first being as 1 was watching the
troops in Belgium last August march
ing to war. Strange at what times
ideas come to us! I hope one of these
is in stock.
"I hope to lie at Stanford for the
commencement in May, though the
fickle goddess of business may pre
vent me; but not if I can possibly
help it. I am very eager to see the
ITnion."
Ingraham has always been interest
ed in the progress and success of
Stanford Union. He was campus sec
retary in his Senior year, and was the
editor of The Daily Palo Alto who in
augurated the custom of receiving
election returns in the Assembly Hall,
and charging admission, for the bene
fit of the Union and Women's Club
House.
