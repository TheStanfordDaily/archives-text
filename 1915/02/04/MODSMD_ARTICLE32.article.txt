United Press Telegraphic Report
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4.—It was of
ficially learned today that Germany
intends to place before the govern
ment of the United States a concrete
case which she believes will test
American Neutrality. In a note to Sec
retary Bryan regarding food on the
steamship Wilhelmina, Chancellor
Bernstorl'f gave the assurance of the
Berlin foreign office that the Ameri
can consul would be allowed to super
vise its distribution, to see that it did
not reach the army. It is learned
that Germany holds that if America
insists as strongly that American
ships have a right to carry food to
German non-combatants, as she in
sists she has the right to carry arms
and ammunition to the allies, Ameri
can neutrality will be vindicated.
However, neutrality may be prevented
should ou.r government decide against
Germany. The Teutons believe that it
England seizes the cargo of the Wil
helmina it will be "pure piracy."
