LONDON, Feb. 4. â€”The Russian
march on Konigsberg has been aban
doned. Dispatches from Petrograd
have during the past three days made
no mention of the Slav progress in
that region. Advices say they have
met superior forces and forced to
' come to a halt. The Germans suf
; fered heavily in preventing the troops
1 of the Czar from crossing a river at
l
Angeropath, near Darhemen, but the
Russians were unable to dislodge them
from their strong positions.
