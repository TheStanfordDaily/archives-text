# "PILLARS OF SOCIETY" CAST AWAIT CURTAIN CALL ON FRIDAY EVENING
## NEW SCENERY IS PROMISED Coach F.L. Mathieu to Perfect Finishing Touches in Dress Rehearsal of Ibsen Play Tonight 
### 
"The Pillars of Society" is in a state
of final polish tor production in the
Assembly Hall tomorrow evening,
when the curtain will rise on the
most ambitious dramatic offering
staged at Stanford for several years
Masquers have left nothing undone to
insure the artistic success of Ibsen's
powerful play. The players have been
selected with especial care and they
now await only the finishing touches
to be provided by the dress rehearsal,
under the direction of Coach F. L.
Mathieu this evening.

The first curtain of the present dra
matic season will disciose the spa
cious garden-room in the house of
'Consul Hernick" in 11 small Norwe
gian coast town, where the interest of
this remarkable drama is centered.
The Columbia Theatre Scenic Studio
in San Francisco has finished a par
ticularly attractive set for this stage
picture, which will afford a a back
ground of real taste and significance
for the development of the plot. The
backwall of the room is almost entire
ly composed of plate-glass, with an
open doorway leading to a broad
flight of steps, over which a sun
shade is let down. He.vond the ver
anda a part of the garden can be seen,
enclosed by a railing with a little gate
leading- to a street of small, brightly
painted wooden houses of exotic
charm. It is summer and the sun
shines warmly. The proper atmos
phere* will be effected by careful at
tention to the infinite detail involved
in the production.
W. J. Gross. '10, has a remarkable
character in "Hilmar Tonncsen," Mrs
Hernick's cousin, whose eccentricities
of personality and speech are the
cause of unfailing laughter. Gross
plays "Hilmar" with appreciation of
the subtle comedy and humor with
which Ibsen invests this social "para
site." He is doing the best work of
his locil experience in this clearly
defined amusing characterization.

Masquers have left nothing undone to
insure the artistic success of Ibsen's
powerful play. The players have been
selected with especial care and they
now await only the finishing touches
to be provided by the dress rehearsal,
under the direction of Coach F. L.
Mathieu this evening.

The first curtain of the present dra
matic season will disciose the spa
cious garden-room in the house of
'Consul Hernick" in 11 small Norwe
gian coast town, where the interest of
this remarkable drama is centered.
The Columbia Theatre Scenic Studio
in San Francisco has finished a par
ticularly attractive set for this stage
picture, which will afford a a back
ground of real taste and significance
for the development of the plot. The
backwall of the room is almost entire
ly composed of plate-glass, with an
open doorway leading to a broad
flight of steps, over which a sun
shade is let down. He.vond the ver
anda a part of the garden can be seen,
enclosed by a railing with a little gate
leading- to a street of small, brightly
painted wooden houses of exotic
charm. It is summer and the sun
shines warmly. The proper atmos
phere* will be effected by careful at
tention to the infinite detail involved
in the production.
W. J. Gross. '10, has a remarkable
character in "Hilmar Tonncsen," Mrs
Hernick's cousin, whose eccentricities
of personality and speech are the
cause of unfailing laughter. Gross
plays "Hilmar" with appreciation of
the subtle comedy and humor with
which Ibsen invests this social "para
site." He is doing the best work of
his locil experience in this clearly
defined amusing characterization.
