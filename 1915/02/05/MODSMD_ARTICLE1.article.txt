# FRENCH LETTER TELLS OF WAR IN TRENCHES
## Vivid Pen Picture Painted by R.E. Pellissier WAS STANFORD INSTRUCTOR Battle in Alsace Unfolds Story of Attack, Retreat, Scenes of Suffering and Death 
### 
A letter from R, E. Pellissier, dated
December 20, and written in the
trenches of the French troops almost
within range of a terrific artillery
duel, has just been .received by C. G.
Allen, assistant professor of the Ro
manic Languages department. Pel
lissier, who was last year an instruct
or in French, and who resigned his
position at Stanford that he might re
turn to France and rally to the col
ors of his mother country, narrates
with simple sincerity a story of the
war as it is in Alsace, â€”a tale of a bat
tle, death, and suffering in the
trenches. The letter is not that of a
war correspondent, but that of a sol
dier on the fighting line, a letter which
closes with a word of loyalty to the
University, and a greeting for his
many friends. He writes as follows:
"As you suspected things have hap
pened of late. To recapitulate, we re
mained in the Vosges, the various
companies of our battalion occupying
a set of trenches on a .ridge until the
twelfth. Nothing very stirring hap
pened. Those trenches are regular
forts with networks of barbed wire
fences, rooms dug under ground, loop
holes for shooting, fairly comfort
able places to live in.and impreg
nable except by artillery. Our batter
ies and the Germans', two hundred
yards away, were so situated in the
bills that the artillery could do noth
ing to one without smashing the men
of the other. The dealock was com
plete. The only shooting was snip
ing. indulged in by advance sentinels.'
Very few men were killed or injured.
"The eighteenth of December we were
shipped very suddenly and by night to
upper Alsace via the Bussary pass.
