# FRENCH LETTER TELLS OF WAR IN TRENCHES
## Vivid Pen Picture Painted by R.E. Pellissier WAS STANFORD INSTRUCTOR Battle in Alsace Unfolds Story of Attack, Retreat, Scenes of Suffering and Death 
### 
A letter from R, E. Pellissier, dated
December 20, and written in the
trenches of the French troops almost
within range of a terrific artillery
duel, has just been .received by C. G.
Allen, assistant professor of the Ro
manic Languages department. Pel
lissier, who was last year an instruct
or in French, and who resigned his
position at Stanford that he might re
turn to France and rally to the col
ors of his mother country, narrates
with simple sincerity a story of the
war as it is in Alsace, —a tale of a bat
tle, death, and suffering in the
trenches. The letter is not that of a
war correspondent, but that of a sol
dier on the fighting line, a letter which
closes with a word of loyalty to the
University, and a greeting for his
many friends. He writes as follows:
"As you suspected things have hap
pened of late. To recapitulate, we re
mained in the Vosges, the various
companies of our battalion occupying
a set of trenches on a .ridge until the
twelfth. Nothing very stirring hap
pened. Those trenches are regular
forts with networks of barbed wire
fences, rooms dug under ground, loop
holes for shooting, fairly comfort
able places to live in.and impreg
nable except by artillery. Our batter
ies and the Germans', two hundred
yards away, were so situated in the
bills that the artillery could do noth
ing to one without smashing the men
of the other. The dealock was com
plete. The only shooting was snip
ing. indulged in by advance sentinels.'
Very few men were killed or injured.
"The eighteenth of December we were
shipped very suddenly and by night to
upper Alsace via the Bussary pass.
Our first night in a German village
was cheered by the very friendly re
ception of the citizens, who did ev
erything in their power to make us
comfortable. My section was 011 duty
that night, and the mayor had a lot
of mattresses carted over to the guard
house, and nuns made tea for us
when we returned from our watches.
The kids in the streets went by us
saying, 'Salud,' and giving us the
military glad hand. All was fine, but
the next morning they marched us
like the devil down the valley through
to the top of a crest about three thou
sand feet high, and told us calmly
that we were going to capture a vil
lage at the foot of the opposite base.
It was a fine, clear day. Guns were
roaring in the Alsaclan plain, cap
tive balloooiis could be seen swaying,
swaying in the distance, and a 'taube'
made us take to cover immediately.
We went down pretty fast, and near
the bottom, close to the village, we
split into two half sections, marched
through the bush, and suddenly came
to the edge of a lot of vineyards over
looking the village. The captain de
cided to attack then and there.
"'II va falloir bourrer la-dedans'
was his decision. So we started shoot
ing in a very general way on the vil
lage which was perhaps three-quar
ters of a mile from us in a hollow.
After a time we advanced a hundred
yards or so, and were greeted by the
zim-zim of Dutch bullets, so we spread
out our line, lay on our stomachs, and
fired some more. We were fully four
hundred yards from the nearest house,
when, to my amazement, I heard our
bugler playing the well-known, 'Y'aura
la goute a boire la-hatit y'aura la
goutte a boire,' etc., which is the
charge. We all jumped up and ran as
fast as possible down the lines of vine
plants, but our knapsacks caught in
the poles on which the plants were
trained. Bullets were flying pretty
thick. Some men fell in a heap and
were quite still. Others knelt and
held an arm or a knee, or grasped
their heads. The rest passed on and
soon were at the edge of the village.
There was a brook there. We lay in
it. We kept shooting at the windows
f.rom which we could see puffs of faint
blue smoke. They were also shoot
ing at us from holes in the roofs and
from the church steeple. Just how
we got in Ido not konw. I was neith
er the first nor the last. We roamed
through that town for an hour. No
officers. The other companies had not
arrived, our captain had been killed,
and our lieutenant had sprained his
ankle, so we did a sort of tourist act
through the town, doing no harm or
damage. At four our commandant
turned up and made us return to the
left, where we came from, and dig
trenches. It began to rain. No sup
per came along. Our trenches filled.
By six it was pitch dark, and mud
everywhere, and no shelter. They
began to throw searchlights on us,
and to avoid detection we had to lie
flat in the mud. It rained all night.
What a night! Also in the darkness
we could hear trains running in our
direction. They were getting rein
forcements. We knew we could not
get much over the mountains. By
morning things began to stir. The
Germans attacked us and tried to tnrn
our left wing. It was .raining hard.
We shot at them and them at us at
one hundred yards. The Germans
grew more and more numerous. Our
men were dropping off, some dead,
some wounded. Finally I happened
to look to the right of me. Not a
soul! The order for retreat had been
sounded, and we on the right had noi
heard it. We soon caught up with the
others and retreated slowly and - in
good order. Pretty soon we met oth
er companies retreating and we
learned that we were four companies
against sixteen of the Germans. We
marched all night. I thought we were
returning home, but found that we
were only taking new positions for a
new attack. Still nothing to eat ex
cept canned meat. It rained again
that night. The afternoon of the next
day they attacked us. Another scrap
in the woods like the previous one,
but we beat them back. But we were
too few, and at midnight went back
to our starting point. Seven hours
of marching in mud, on mountain
roads in pitch darkness. When we
got to safety we were pretty well done
up. Little sleep, and less food, and
too much excitement and walking for
three days. Such is my first battle.
"We have been told that the purpose
of the expedition had never been to
take the town, but to make the Ger
mans move their troops. Howver this
may be, we lost one-third of our men.
about five hundred. One is so strained
that he does not notice the hardships
which ordinarily by themselves lay
a man low.
"Now we are on hill-crests with Al
pine t.roops. In the valley there has
been an artillery duel about Mulhouse
ever since Christmas morning—an aw
ful lot of firing. We don't know the
results.
"I could write more, but haven't
time now. We will talk It over some
day. I hope. Stanford looks pretty
e:ood to me. Remember me to all my
friends."

ing in a very general way on the vil
lage which was perhaps three-quar
ters of a mile from us in a hollow.
After a time we advanced a hundred
yards or so, and were greeted by the
zim-zim of Dutch bullets, so we spread
out our line, lay on our stomachs, and
fired some more. We were fully four
hundred yards from the nearest house,
when, to my amazement, I heard our
bugler playing the well-known, 'Y'aura
la goute a boire la-hatit y'aura la
goutte a boire,' etc., which is the
charge. We all jumped up and ran as
fast as possible down the lines of vine
plants, but our knapsacks caught in
the poles on which the plants were
trained. Bullets were flying pretty
thick. Some men fell in a heap and
were quite still. Others knelt and
held an arm or a knee, or grasped
their heads. The rest passed on and
soon were at the edge of the village.
There was a brook there. We lay in
it. We kept shooting at the windows
f.rom which we could see puffs of faint
blue smoke. They were also shoot
ing at us from holes in the roofs and
from the church steeple. Just how
we got in Ido not konw. I was neith
er the first nor the last. We roamed
through that town for an hour. No
officers. The other companies had not
arrived, our captain had been killed,
and our lieutenant had sprained his
ankle, so we did a sort of tourist act
through the town, doing no harm or
damage. At four our commandant
turned up and made us return to the
left, where we came from, and dig
trenches. It began to rain. No sup
per came along. Our trenches filled.
By six it was pitch dark, and mud
everywhere, and no shelter. They
began to throw searchlights on us,
and to avoid detection we had to lie
flat in the mud. It rained all night.
What a night! Also in the darkness
we could hear trains running in our
direction. They were getting rein
forcements. We knew we could not
get much over the mountains. By
morning things began to stir. The
Germans attacked us and tried to tnrn
our left wing. It was .raining hard.
We shot at them and them at us at
one hundred yards. The Germans
grew more and more numerous. Our
men were dropping off, some dead,
some wounded. Finally I happened
to look to the right of me. Not a
soul! The order for retreat had been
sounded, and we on the right had noi
heard it. We soon caught up with the
others and retreated slowly and - in
good order. Pretty soon we met oth
er companies retreating and we
learned that we were four companies
against sixteen of the Germans. We
marched all night. I thought we were
returning home, but found that we
were only taking new positions for a
new attack. Still nothing to eat ex
cept canned meat. It rained again
that night. The afternoon of the next
day they attacked us. Another scrap
in the woods like the previous one,
but we beat them back. But we were
too few, and at midnight went back
to our starting point. Seven hours
of marching in mud, on mountain
roads in pitch darkness. When we
got to safety we were pretty well done
up. Little sleep, and less food, and
too much excitement and walking for
three days. Such is my first battle.

A letter from R, E. Pellissier, dated
December 20, and written in the
trenches of the French troops almost
within range of a terrific artillery
duel, has just been .received by C. G.
Allen, assistant professor of the Ro
manic Languages department. Pel
lissier, who was last year an instruct
or in French, and who resigned his
position at Stanford that he might re
turn to France and rally to the col
ors of his mother country, narrates
with simple sincerity a story of the
war as it is in Alsace, —a tale of a bat
tle, death, and suffering in the
trenches. The letter is not that of a
war correspondent, but that of a sol
dier on the fighting line, a letter which
closes with a word of loyalty to the
University, and a greeting for his
many friends. He writes as follows:
"As you suspected things have hap
pened of late. To recapitulate, we re
mained in the Vosges, the various
companies of our battalion occupying
a set of trenches on a .ridge until the
twelfth. Nothing very stirring hap
pened. Those trenches are regular
forts with networks of barbed wire
fences, rooms dug under ground, loop
holes for shooting, fairly comfort
able places to live in.and impreg
nable except by artillery. Our batter
ies and the Germans', two hundred
yards away, were so situated in the
bills that the artillery could do noth
ing to one without smashing the men
of the other. The dealock was com
plete. The only shooting was snip
ing. indulged in by advance sentinels.'
Very few men were killed or injured.
"The eighteenth of December we were
shipped very suddenly and by night to
upper Alsace via the Bussary pass.
Our first night in a German village
was cheered by the very friendly re
ception of the citizens, who did ev
erything in their power to make us
comfortable. My section was 011 duty
that night, and the mayor had a lot
of mattresses carted over to the guard
house, and nuns made tea for us
when we returned from our watches.
The kids in the streets went by us
saying, 'Salud,' and giving us the
military glad hand. All was fine, but
the next morning they marched us
like the devil down the valley through
to the top of a crest about three thou
sand feet high, and told us calmly
that we were going to capture a vil
lage at the foot of the opposite base.
It was a fine, clear day. Guns were
roaring in the Alsaclan plain, cap
tive balloooiis could be seen swaying,
swaying in the distance, and a 'taube'
made us take to cover immediately.
We went down pretty fast, and near
the bottom, close to the village, we
split into two half sections, marched
through the bush, and suddenly came
to the edge of a lot of vineyards over
looking the village. The captain de

A letter from R, E. Pellissier, dated
December 20, and written in the
trenches of the French troops almost
within range of a terrific artillery
duel, has just been .received by C. G.
Allen, assistant professor of the Ro
manic Languages department. Pel
lissier, who was last year an instruct
or in French, and who resigned his
position at Stanford that he might re
turn to France and rally to the col
ors of his mother country, narrates
with simple sincerity a story of the
war as it is in Alsace, —a tale of a bat
tle, death, and suffering in the
trenches. The letter is not that of a
war correspondent, but that of a sol
dier on the fighting line, a letter which
closes with a word of loyalty to the
University, and a greeting for his
many friends. He writes as follows:
"As you suspected things have hap
pened of late. To recapitulate, we re
mained in the Vosges, the various
companies of our battalion occupying
a set of trenches on a .ridge until the
twelfth. Nothing very stirring hap
pened. Those trenches are regular
forts with networks of barbed wire
fences, rooms dug under ground, loop
holes for shooting, fairly comfort
able places to live in.and impreg
nable except by artillery. Our batter
ies and the Germans', two hundred
yards away, were so situated in the
bills that the artillery could do noth
ing to one without smashing the men
of the other. The dealock was com
plete. The only shooting was snip
ing. indulged in by advance sentinels.'
Very few men were killed or injured.
"The eighteenth of December we were
shipped very suddenly and by night to
upper Alsace via the Bussary pass.
Our first night in a German village
was cheered by the very friendly re
ception of the citizens, who did ev
erything in their power to make us
comfortable. My section was 011 duty
that night, and the mayor had a lot
of mattresses carted over to the guard
house, and nuns made tea for us
when we returned from our watches.
The kids in the streets went by us
saying, 'Salud,' and giving us the
military glad hand. All was fine, but
the next morning they marched us
like the devil down the valley through
to the top of a crest about three thou
sand feet high, and told us calmly
that we were going to capture a vil
lage at the foot of the opposite base.
It was a fine, clear day. Guns were
roaring in the Alsaclan plain, cap
tive balloooiis could be seen swaying,
swaying in the distance, and a 'taube'
made us take to cover immediately.
We went down pretty fast, and near
the bottom, close to the village, we
split into two half sections, marched
through the bush, and suddenly came
to the edge of a lot of vineyards over
looking the village. The captain de
cided to attack then and there.
"'II va falloir bourrer la-dedans'
was his decision. So we started shoot
ing in a very general way on the vil
lage which was perhaps three-quar
ters of a mile from us in a hollow.
After a time we advanced a hundred
yards or so, and were greeted by the
zim-zim of Dutch bullets, so we spread
out our line, lay on our stomachs, and
fired some more. We were fully four
hundred yards from the nearest house,
when, to my amazement, I heard our
bugler playing the well-known, 'Y'aura
la goute a boire la-hatit y'aura la
goutte a boire,' etc., which is the
charge. We all jumped up and ran as
fast as possible down the lines of vine
plants, but our knapsacks caught in
the poles on which the plants were
trained. Bullets were flying pretty
thick. Some men fell in a heap and
were quite still. Others knelt and
held an arm or a knee, or grasped
their heads. The rest passed on and
soon were at the edge of the village.
There was a brook there. We lay in
it. We kept shooting at the windows
f.rom which we could see puffs of faint
blue smoke. They were also shoot
ing at us from holes in the roofs and
from the church steeple. Just how
we got in Ido not konw. I was neith
er the first nor the last. We roamed
through that town for an hour. No
officers. The other companies had not
arrived, our captain had been killed,
and our lieutenant had sprained his
ankle, so we did a sort of tourist act
through the town, doing no harm or
damage. At four our commandant
turned up and made us return to the
left, where we came from, and dig
trenches. It began to rain. No sup
per came along. Our trenches filled.
By six it was pitch dark, and mud
everywhere, and no shelter. They
began to throw searchlights on us,
and to avoid detection we had to lie
flat in the mud. It rained all night.
What a night! Also in the darkness
we could hear trains running in our
direction. They were getting rein
forcements. We knew we could not
get much over the mountains. By
morning things began to stir. The
Germans attacked us and tried to tnrn
our left wing. It was .raining hard.
We shot at them and them at us at
one hundred yards. The Germans
grew more and more numerous. Our
men were dropping off, some dead,
some wounded. Finally I happened
to look to the right of me. Not a
soul! The order for retreat had been
sounded, and we on the right had noi
heard it. We soon caught up with the
others and retreated slowly and - in
good order. Pretty soon we met oth
er companies retreating and we
learned that we were four companies
against sixteen of the Germans. We
marched all night. I thought we were
returning home, but found that we
were only taking new positions for a
new attack. Still nothing to eat ex
cept canned meat. It rained again
that night. The afternoon of the next
