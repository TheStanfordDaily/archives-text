# Varsity and First Year Fives Slated For Double-Header
## 
### 
Two week-end basketball games in
which Cardinal squads will compete
for first place honors have been
staged for Saturday night, one here
on the campus, and another in San
Francisco.
At eight o'clock Stanford Varsity
will line lip against St. Ignatius Col
lege in the old Rice Institute gymna
sium for the second contest in the
Intercollegiate schedule. At about
the same time the fast Freshman live
will play the team to be sent down
from San Francisco by Polytechnic
high school.
Practically the same line-up as was
used in the Santa Clara game will be
depended upon to do the work for the
Varsity, unless causalties necessitate
changes. Worthy and Rlodget will
begin the offensive work, with Dut
ton at center. McMahon and Davis
will wait on the side lines for oppor
tunity to work in as forwards, while
Wallace will accompany the squad as
auxiliary center. Dolan and Reynolds
will prevent shooting by the St. Ig
nntious players, though Caughey may
be seen in action before the evening
is over.
