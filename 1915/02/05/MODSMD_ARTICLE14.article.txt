# GRASS VS. PAVING
## 
### 
We regret to learn that the Board
of Trustees has let the contract for
paving the Inner Quad. It has often
been rumored that some kind of pav
ing would replace the pebble yard, but
little attention was ever given the
matter by the Student Body. It hardly
seemed reasonable that such action
would ever be taken. Now that every
one has had time to consider the sig
nificance of such a plan it is possible
that some have awakened to the fact
that the former charms of the Inner
Quad will be no more, unless some
steps are taken immediately to re
strain construction work until the
matter can be given further consid
eration.
Ry this we do not mean that the
pebbles are in themselves beautiful,
or do justice to the surroundings, but
as long as the pebbles remain, there
is a probability that they will be re
placed by grass. If paving is substi
tuted for grass, our fond hopes of a
green inner court will have vanished.
As long as the pebbles remain we still
have hopes that they will be replaced
by grass, as soon as financs permit.
Paving of the Inner Quad will mean
the elimination of the atmosphere of
dignity, and of the artistic lines of
the low Spanish architecture; it will
pervert the natural surroundings and
bring about a permanent artificiality
entirely foreign to the surroundings.
Some of us may not have as deep
aesthetic tastes as others, but we can
certainly appreciate the harmonious
combinations which must necessarily
be perverted if paving is to replace
the pebbles. From a practical stand
point the paving will draw the heat
and make the Inner Quad much more
uncomfortable during certain seasons
of the year than it is under present
conditions. Surely no one wants to
see an eyesore. Certainly a paved in
ner court will be far from attractive.
Unattractiveness is an essential char
acteristic of eyesores.
Why not plant grass seed in place
of the pebbles, instead of paving the
i
inner court? We realize that there are
several reasons why the Board has
decided in favor of the paving. The
paramount reason is due to the dif
ference in expense. But would it not
be better to sacrifice a financial out
lay in order to retain and increase the
attractiveness and beauty of the
Stanford Quad? We hope that this
matter may be taken under consider
ation again by the Board of Trustees,
and that grass may be substituted for
paving.
