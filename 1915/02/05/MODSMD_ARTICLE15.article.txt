The doors of the Stanford Union
are to be thrown open tomorrow even
ing. The house-warming will he of an
entirely informal nature. The build
ing belongs to the men, to do with

as they see fit. Men may come and
go as their pleasure dictates. Don't
consider for a moment that it is your
duty to drop in the Union tomorrow
evening. It is rather an opportunity
for you to take advantage of. If you
feel so inclined, do so. There will be
a welcome for all.
