# INTERCLASS SOCCER TO BE PLAYED FEBRUARY 22
## Williamson Trophy Will Be Presented to Class Victorious Three Times. 
### 
'1 he annual five-a-side interclass
soccer game is scheduled to take place
on the Stanford turf, Washington's
birthday, February twenty-second. The
Williamson interclass trophy shield,
which was presented two years ago
by the late C. Y. Williamson, of the
Olympic Club, of San Francisco, is to
become the permanent property of thu
class winning three games. In 1913
the honors went to the Seniors, while
last year the Juniors were the win
ners.
A second soccer game is planned for
the same afternoon between two Ala
meda preparatory schools. Trainer
Maloney is now arranging with Grad
uate Manager Wilcox fo.r the use of
the turf by the outside teams, as
there will be no gate receipts. These
teams gave a public exhibition in San
Francisco during the Christmas holi
days, and put up a remarkable game
of scientific soccer. Owing to their
having played much together, an ex
ceptionally fast game is aniticipated.
