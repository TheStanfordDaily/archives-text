this contest, .receiving a prize for his
essay on the "Ethical Aspects of the
California Workmen's Compensation
Act" last year.

Women and Minors." Each contest
ant took some special phase of this
general question.
More than twice the usual number
of manuscripts were submitted this
year. As a consequence, the judges,
Professors C. A. Huston, of the Law
department, and H. W. Stuart, of the
Philosophy department, and Judge G.


A. F. Coyle,

I,reat difficulty in arriving at any
ananimous decision. The manuscripts
hid to be returned for a sscond read
ing.
1 lie second division of this contest,
the discussion of the question by the
winners of the first prizes, will take
place in the Chapel on Friday evening,
February 12. The winner of the dis
cussion, who will be chosen on the
basis of clear insight into the subject,
as well as effective presentation of
his speech, will be given an addition
al fifty dollars. Judges for this sec
ond contest have not as yet been
chosen.
All manuscripts which have been
submitted in the contest may be se
cured by the writers at the Registrar's

oapers are to be left at the Presi
dent's office after the discussion, for
fhe purpose of forwarding them to Mr.
\lbert Bonnheim, of Sacramento, who
's the donator of these prizes.
The purpose of the contest, which
is always concerned with the ethical
ispect of some important question is,
as stated by Mr. Bonnheim, not pri
marily to find new truths and facts,
but to place those which we already
'<now before the students of Universi
ties. The same prizes a.re awarded at
California for a similar contest, and
besides (he Bonnheim essay prizes,
'here are numerous Bonnheim "schol
arships awarded to individual stu
dents for the same kind of work.
