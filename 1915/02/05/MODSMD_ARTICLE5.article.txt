# IRELAND'S LEAGUERS TO PLAY HERE TOMORROW
## All-Star Lineup Will Face Varsity Batsmen MAJOR CLUBS REPRESENTED Hoever Named to Pitch Against Scott of Wnite Sox and Babe Driscoll 
### 
Should old Sol continue to smile up
on the campus and grant fair weath
er to Cardinal fans tomorrow after
noon, Ireland's galaxy of diamond
stars and the Stanford Varsity will
cross bats 011 the local field in their
second engagement of the season. Al
though predictions of rain have been
made, Coach Hilly Orr positively as
serts that the clouds will scatter, and
give his charges an opportunity to
play.
Yesterday afternoon, for the first
time in tan days, practice was indulged
in on the local diamond. Despite their
long lay-off, the Varsity displayed a
remarkable amount of zest and ginger
in both their infield and outfied
work-out, which lasted nearly two
hours. It is to be expected, however,
that the batting eyes of the Cardinals
will have materially suffered in the
extended period of inactivity.
When General Ireland's Independ
ents engaged the Varsity January 16,
they came out on the long end of a 4
to 1 score in an eight-inning encoun-
ter. Tomorrow's contest will be the
second of the four-game series ar
ranged by Manager Wilcox between
these teams.
Practically the same line-up which
was originally scheduled for the San
ta Clara game of last Saturday will
be used tomor.ro.w by Coach Orr. The
opening battery will be composed of
Dent on the receiving end, and Hoev
er in the box. Hurley and Landers
may substitute later in the game.
The infield will see the same quar
tette on the field which started the
opening game of the season against
the Olympic Club. Captain Tom Work
man will cover the initial station;
Stafford, after a four weeks' vacation,
will resume his position as guardian
of the keystone sack; .Stevens will
fill in at the short patch, while Mc-
C'loskey is to take care of the diffi
cult corner.
Five candidates a,re to be used in
the pasture. Day, Noonan, and Down
ing will occupy outfield berths at the
beginning of the game, from left to
right, respectively. Austin and
O'Neill are to relieve later in the
game.
Cliff Ireland in presenting his line
up, states "I have the finest bunch of
gentleman ball players that has ever
been taken to Stanford University,
and every one listed will positively
make his appearance on the campus
Saturday in uniform." The truth of
the statement is assured when one
glances over the number of diamond
satelietes assigned to positions on the
Independents.
The battery consists of Jim Scott,
slabsman on the Chicago White Sox,
and Rowdy Elliott, popular backstop
of the Venice Coast League Club. In
an emergency these will be relieved by
Babe Driscoll, of Victoria Northwest
ern, and Cy Perkins, of Salt Lake.
Lou Kennedy, with the roaring
voice, trophy winner on the Venice
Club's Honolulu trip, will hold down
first base. Slugger Ireland will oc
cupy the second station, with all his
accustomed dexterity. Third base and
shortstop have been turned over to
Eddie Halinan, of the Salt Lake Coast.
League Club, and Dick Egan, of the
Brooklyn Nationals, respectively.
Stars of big league fame will cavort
about the outer gardens. Ping Bodie,
of home run .reputation, former mem
ber of the Chicago White Sox; Tom
my Tennant, of the Salt Lake club;
Harry Heilman, erstwhile Detroit
American; Duffy Lewis, member of
the Boston Red Sox, and Sammy Co
hen, another White Sox player, com
plete the list of outfielders.
In the morning at ten-fifteen, the
Second Varsity will hook up with the
Lowell high school nine. No admis
sion will be charged.

Independents.
The battery consists of Jim Scott,
slabsman on the Chicago White Sox,
and Rowdy Elliott, popular backstop
of the Venice Coast League Club. In
an emergency these will be relieved by
Babe Driscoll, of Victoria Northwest
ern, and Cy Perkins, of Salt Lake.
Lou Kennedy, with the roaring
voice, trophy winner on the Venice
Club's Honolulu trip, will hold down
first base. Slugger Ireland will oc
cupy the second station, with all his
accustomed dexterity. Third base and
shortstop have been turned over to
Eddie Halinan, of the Salt Lake Coast.
League Club, and Dick Egan, of the
Brooklyn Nationals, respectively.
Stars of big league fame will cavort
about the outer gardens. Ping Bodie,
of home run .reputation, former mem
ber of the Chicago White Sox; Tom
my Tennant, of the Salt Lake club;
Harry Heilman, erstwhile Detroit
American; Duffy Lewis, member of
the Boston Red Sox, and Sammy Co
hen, another White Sox player, com
plete the list of outfielders.
In the morning at ten-fifteen, the
Second Varsity will hook up with the
Lowell high school nine. No admis
sion will be charged.
Should old Sol continue to smile up
on the campus and grant fair weath
er to Cardinal fans tomorrow after
noon, Ireland's galaxy of diamond
stars and the Stanford Varsity will
cross bats 011 the local field in their
second engagement of the season. Al
though predictions of rain have been
made, Coach Hilly Orr positively as
serts that the clouds will scatter, and
give his charges an opportunity to
play.
Yesterday afternoon, for the first
time in tan days, practice was indulged
in on the local diamond. Despite their
long lay-off, the Varsity displayed a
remarkable amount of zest and ginger
in both their infield and outfied
work-out, which lasted nearly two
hours. It is to be expected, however,
that the batting eyes of the Cardinals
will have materially suffered in the
extended period of inactivity.
When General Ireland's Independ
ents engaged the Varsity January 16,
they came out on the long end of a 4
to 1 score in an eight-inning encoun-
ter. Tomorrow's contest will be the
second of the four-game series ar
ranged by Manager Wilcox between
these teams.
Practically the same line-up which
was originally scheduled for the San
ta Clara game of last Saturday will
be used tomor.ro.w by Coach Orr. The
opening battery will be composed of
Dent on the receiving end, and Hoev
er in the box. Hurley and Landers
may substitute later in the game.
The infield will see the same quar
tette on the field which started the
opening game of the season against
the Olympic Club. Captain Tom Work
man will cover the initial station;
Stafford, after a four weeks' vacation,
will resume his position as guardian
of the keystone sack; .Stevens will
fill in at the short patch, while Mc-
C'loskey is to take care of the diffi
cult corner.
Five candidates a,re to be used in
the pasture. Day, Noonan, and Down
ing will occupy outfield berths at the
beginning of the game, from left to
right, respectively. Austin and
O'Neill are to relieve later in the
game.
Cliff Ireland in presenting his line
up, states "I have the finest bunch of
gentleman ball players that has ever
been taken to Stanford University,
and every one listed will positively
make his appearance on the campus
Saturday in uniform." The truth of
the statement is assured when one
glances over the number of diamond
satelietes assigned to positions on the
Independents.
