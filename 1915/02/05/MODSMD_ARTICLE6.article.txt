## 
### 
The date of the 1915 Intercollegiate
golf match has been set for March
20th. The contest with the Blue and
Gold team will be played on the Ingle
side links, that course being selected
by the California team, which has the
choice this year.
Try-outs for the team will be be
gun immediately under the super
vision of Captain L. Sloss, '15. The
practice matches to determine the
personnel of the team will be played
on the Burlingame links. Though
golf is a sport which, through lack of
facilities, has been somewhat neglect
ed at Stanford, enough material is
available to assure a strong repre
sentation in the intercollegiate con
test. F. Price. '14, F. H. Siads, 'IS.
and Captain Sloss may all be de
pended upon for eighteen holes close
to par, while several other candidates
have shown excellent form.
The Stanford golf course is actually
under construction, the first work be
ing comenced two weeks ago. Work
was suspended owing to the recent
storms, but will be resumed at once,
if good weather continues. A grader
will be put to work on the fairways
as soon as they are dry enough to lie
workable. The cups for the greens
are already here, and will be sunk as
fast as the greens can be prepared
Only one green has been putin shape
so far, but if fair weather prevails, at
least six holes will lie playable in the
course of two weeks. Benches and
tee-boxes are being manufactured by
F. Price.
Interest in the links is confined
not alone to members of the Univer
sity. Ten residents of Palo Alto have
already sent in applications for non
resident membership. These will be
acted upon at the next meeting of
the club.
First semester membership fees are
now due. Assistants to the treasurer,
Professor R. E. Allardice, who will
collect dues from student members,
are: Miss Margaret Evans, '17, A. E.
Baldwin, '18, F. L. Sloss, '15, and C. F.
McCormack, '18.
