# Freshman Rugby Qnestion To Be Reviewed Tomorrow
## Faculty Committees of Stanford and California Will Confer on Important Topics. 
### 
The faculty committees appointed to
confer on the question of restoring
the Freshman rugby game between
Stanford and California will meet
tomorrow. The committees were ap
pointed by the presidents of the two
Universities to further the attempt of
the Intercollegiate Agreement Com
mittee to ar.rive at a settlement of their
differences under the terms of the
tentative compact recently drawn.
By the terms of this gentleman's
agreement, Stanford concedes the rule

eliminating first
year men on
condition that
the Freshmen in
tercollegiate be
restored. Th e
game was abro
gated by the
Stanford Facili
ty in 1909 and
the -California

members of t to Intercollegiate Aree
ment Committee claimed the right of
having a committee from their fac
ulty confer with representatives of
the local faculty regarding restoring
it, as a substitute for Freshman par
ticipation in varsity sport. If the
California committee is unsuccessful
in their mission none of the terms of
the tentative agreement will be ef
fctive, for the compact requires that
all its articles be void if any one of
them cannot be put into effect.
The Stanford committee will .report
the results of the eonference to the
Academic Council with whom final
power rests to restore the game.
Stanford will be represented at the


Doctor Ai gell
conference by Dr. Frank Angell, Pro
fessor E. D. Adams, and Professor A.
T. Murray. California's committee is
composed of Dr. David P. Barrows,
Dean of the College; Professor, T. M.
Putnam, Dean of the Lower Schools
and Professor M. C. Lynch, chairman
of the Faculty Committee. Neither
of the Universities are being repre
sented by their regular athletic com
mitted, but by a specially appointed
committee.
