# AUDIENCE ACCEPTS IBSEN'S PRODUCTION WITH CONSERVATISM
## Fair Success Greets Masquers' Production of "Pillars of Society" DRAMA VERY APPROPRIATE 
### Frank E. Hill, '11 
For the first time in several years
a Stanford audience assembled last

Friday evening to see
a dramatically sig
nificant performance
given by University
men and women. The
actors and behold rs
of "Pillars of Socie
ty" seemed conscious
of an activity that
was foreign to their
immediate pasts. On

the part of those who presented and
those who watched the play there was
a little stiffness, a little figurative
rustines?, such as a marooned sailor is
supposed to feel when he speaks to
rescuers after ten years' of silence.
But on the whole the performance was
successful: it attempted something
worth while, and it attained much that
it sought. The Masquers made a step
forward from their last year's "Quali
ty Street" (the most assuming produc
tion of the year 1913-14), and the pub
lic appreciated the step. Appreciation
was mixed with a fair-minded criti
cism, but such criticism should be wel
comed.
There are three elements in any
dramatic production which may mar
or make the success of the offering:
play, actors, and audience. It is al
ways interesting to consider these in
detail, for an examination of them con
stitutes a better criticism than general
opinion can give. In the case of the
play at hand, little need be offered in
