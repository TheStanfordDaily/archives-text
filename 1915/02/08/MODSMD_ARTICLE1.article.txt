# AUDIENCE ACCEPTS IBSEN'S PRODUCTION WITH CONSERVATISM
## Fair Success Greets Masquers' Production of "Pillars of Society" DRAMA VERY APPROPRIATE 
### Frank E. Hill, '11 
For the first time in several years
a Stanford audience assembled last

Friday evening to see
a dramatically sig
nificant performance
given by University
men and women. The
actors and behold rs
of "Pillars of Socie
ty" seemed conscious
of an activity that
was foreign to their
immediate pasts. On

the part of those who presented and
those who watched the play there was
a little stiffness, a little figurative
rustines?, such as a marooned sailor is
supposed to feel when he speaks to
rescuers after ten years' of silence.
But on the whole the performance was
successful: it attempted something
worth while, and it attained much that
it sought. The Masquers made a step
forward from their last year's "Quali
ty Street" (the most assuming produc
tion of the year 1913-14), and the pub
lic appreciated the step. Appreciation
was mixed with a fair-minded criti
cism, but such criticism should be wel
comed.
There are three elements in any
dramatic production which may mar
or make the success of the offering:
play, actors, and audience. It is al
ways interesting to consider these in
detail, for an examination of them con
stitutes a better criticism than general
opinion can give. In the case of the
play at hand, little need be offered in

; comment concerning the first of thes?
j elements. "Pillars of Society" showed
that as a drama it could be made wel
come at Stanford. Concerning the
caste and the audience, however, there
are things to be said.
The interpreters of "Pillars of So
ciety" were in many instances good.
They "got across" the main point of
the drama, —that a man who stands
upon a lie cannot stand firmly, cannot
satisfy himself. Miss Margery Bailey,
as "Lona Hessel," was not surprisingly
good, for the reason that it was ex
pected that she would do what she did,
—carry a difficult part well, and in
sure the success of the play. Extreme
naturalness and timely vigor were
Miss Bailey's. No less successful, in
the less important role, was Miss Ter
ese Dorroh, as Martha. C. M. Vrang,
as Aune, the foreman of Karsten Ber
nick's ship repairing yards, drew well
deserved applause fo.r his portrayal <>112
the master-workman. The three ladies
of the town, represented by Misses
Sampson, Andrews, and Mills, brought
clearly before the audience the me
diaeval-modern. gossipy character of
the little Norwegian port in which the
action of the drama is laid. All the
foregoing, with H. Sopsr as the peda
gogue, Borland, and W. J. Gross as
Hilmar Tonnesen, made the audience
aware that it was seeing a rich satire
on certain modern conditions. The
audience was at times a little unsure
as to whether or not it was getting all
that the meaty lines of the great Nor
wegian meant for it to receive, but it
was certain that it was getting some
thing rather rich, and welcomed justly
the successful thrusts of the various
characters.
It is regretted that when so much
that was good "arrived," more still
could not have come. Mr. F. C. Mc-
Colloch, as Karsten Bernick, had a dif
ficult part, but, even as an amateur,
he could have been expected to do his
role more successfully. An over-use
of physical action and a suggestion of
the recitation of memorized speeches
attended him almost constantly. He
never entirely failed with a situation,
but he never distinctly succeeded, ex
cept in the scene with his wife at the
beginning of the second act, and in the
scene with Aune shortly afterwards,
where both he and Mr. Vrang did a
highly creditable piece of work. Sim
ilarly, Miss Elizabeth Taff, as Mrs.
Bernick, and Miss Florence Stewart, as
Dina Dorf, failed at important places
in regard to perfect naturalness. Miss
Taff's work in the just-mentioned
scene with Bernick was excellent, and
Miss Stewart did well in the first act.
In the latter part of the drama, howev
er, Mrs. Bernick was weakly senti
mental, where Ibsen seems to have
wished to show her not only as sincere,
but as comprehensive for the first time
in her life. Afte.r the first act Miss
Stewart showed a tendency to believe
that emotion meant romantic unnatur
alness. I cannot help feeling, too,
that Mr. Gross' portrayal of Hilmar,
while, in a way, as good as anything
seen on the stage Friday evening, was
yet too broad, and consequently
brought laughter from the audience in
situations that were at least not de
serving of more than the smile which
comes of witnessing humor that
merges into pain. Hilmar, as por
trayed, was a fussy, funnily erratic
person; I believe Ibsen intended him
to be more serious, more pathetic. Mr.
Johnson's portrayal of Krap was at
times just a shade too vigorous, but on
the whole was very successful. Messrs.
Cole, Tedford, and Ferguson made ex
cellent capitalists.
The audience now .remains for con
sideration. It was like the caste, —
mostly very good, partly somewhat in
different. At times it failed fully to
"get" the play, but usually it gave a
free and judicious appreciation. Since
"Pillars of Society" is generally consid
ered a too obvious play, such failure
as there was on the part of the audi
ence to understand it is either a joke
on or reproach to the occupants of pit
and gallery. I am not sure which.
Propably the truth is that for most of
those who saw the play Ibsen was per
fectly understandable, but that for a
lamentable minority he was not. I
know that there were those who came
to scoff, and that some of these at
least, though they remained, did not
pray. "Over my head!" was the rather
proudly cheerful verdict given me per
sonally by a select few. I venture to
say that this baffled minority deserves
a just reproach for exalting a deliber
ate mental sluggishnesss into a virtue.
"Pillars of Society" is simply an intel
ligently human, not an intellectual
play. That it should be condemned by
some Stanford folk as "highbrow" is
an evidence of a distressing mental
coma on our campus. "Pillars of Socie
ty," far from being too stiff for Stan
ford dramatic fare, seemed to me to
he most appropriately adequate,—
nothing more o.r less. What Stanford
needs is more plays like it. Fri
day's production was enjoyed. If the
enjoyment was a little hesitant, it in
dicated that were more Ibsen pro
duced both audiences and cast would
grow into a love for and an ability to
interpret drama that stimulates at the
same time that it entertains
