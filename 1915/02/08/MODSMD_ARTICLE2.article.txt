# SHUT-OUT ADMINISTERED IRELAND'S INDEPENDENTS
## Array of .Major League Stars Lose Close 1 to 0 Battle to Stanford Varsity. 
### 
Major league exhibition of twirling by
Gns llopver, who worked on the mound
for the Varsity, won a nip and tuck 1
to 0 shut-out over Ireland's Independ
ents for Stanford. At every stage of
the game, the Cardinal pitcher was
equal to the occasion, mowing down
the opposition with apparent ease.
Despite the array of Ping Bodie,
Dick Egan, Eddie Burns. Jim Scott.
Sammy Cohen, Eddie Heilman, Dutch
Leonard, Duffy Lewis, and Cy Per
kins. Brigadier-General Cliff Ireland
could not force his collection of tal
ent to shove even one lone tally across
the plate.
Such a group of diamond satellites
have never performed before local
fans, even in the years gone by when
the Chicago White Sox made their fa
mous visit to the campus, as was in ev
idence last Saturday. Although no
startling plays were made, neverthe
less Stanford baseball enthusiasts
were content to watch the high-priced
exponents of the national pastime lazi
ly stroll about the field.
Two such slabsmen as Jim Scott,
the brainy and reliable pitcher of the
White Sox, and Dutch Leonard, of the
Boston Red Sox, leading mound ar
tist of the American League, created
much favorable comment. Babe Dris
cnll worked the last three innings.
For five rounds neither sid? was
able to advance a player past second
base. In the sixth frame both teams
showed sinus of life. After two wore
down, Heilinan drew four wide balls,
and thereupon promptly stole second.
When Stevens made a pretty play on
Kennedy's grounder, the side was' re
tired.
In the last half of this inning the
Varsity scored the only run of the
game. Stafford was safe on first when
Te.rry McKune mishandled an easy
chance, and overthrew first, thereby
allowing Stafford to reach second.
Workman fanned. Dent reached the
initial station on a fielder's choice, in
an unsuccessful attempt to catch Staf
ford off second. Day then took his
cue in proper fashion by smashing a
single to center. Duffy Lewis pegged
the ball to Kennedy at first, but the
latter missed the throw. Stafford
scored and Dent advanced to third.
Day moved up a notch by pilfering
second. Leonard prevented any furth
er run-getting, when he forced both
McCloskey and Downing to take three
strikes.
In the eighth frame prospects were
far from bright. After Eddie Burns
had shot a long double to left-center,
•McKune was safe 011 a fielder's choice.
Lewis forced Burns out at third, leav
ing first and second still occupied.
Cullen populated the bags, when Hoev
er bounced a swift one off his back.
Kennedy ended the agony by ground
ing out unassisted to Workman. Stan
ford came near scoring in the second
half of the same inning, following
safe hits by Workman and Dent.
The morning contest between the
Lowell high school nine and the Sec
ond Varsity resulted in a 2 to 2 tie
score. The contest was even and close
throughout. The second team came
up from behind in the last inning, the
seventh, when Henzel scored 011 Dick
ie's sacrifice fly. Wickersham and
Hurley showed excellent form in the
box, holding the high school players
down to three hits.
