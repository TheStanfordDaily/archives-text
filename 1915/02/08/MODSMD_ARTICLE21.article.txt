# RESPONSIBILITY OF STUDENT GOVERNMENT RESTS ON INDIVIDUALS
## Professor E.D. Adams Parallels Development of National Democracy and Campus Self-Government. 
### 
That the development of democracy
in the Fnited States paralleled that of
student self-government at Stanford
was among the initial statements of
Professor E. D. Adams, of the History
department, in his talk on "Democra
cy and Student Self-Government," yes
terday evening at the fifth of the Sun
day Encina meetings.
Doctor Adams insisted that liberty
was but one phase of self-government,
and frankly stated his belief that there
bad come each year a lapse in the
effectiveness of student control, due to
the fact that the students regarded
their own Student Council as a thing
to be dodged.
Two things, he pointed out, are ab
solutely necessary fo.r successful stu
dent self-government: care in electing
men. who are not merely "good fel
lows," but that have real moral prin
ciple, courage, and tact; and that the
students take upon themselves the
duty of reporting offences against the
good name of Stanford.
A varied and successful program
was offered by the band previous to
Professor Adam's address.
