# FOUR ELEMENTS OF STANFORD LIFE MINGLE IN THE EVENTS OF THE OPENING OF THE UNION
## Faculty, Trustees, Students and Alumni Meet in the New Campus Building to Take a Pledge of Renewed Loyalty to the Spirit Which Dominates the University 
### 
had made the opening possible at this
Stanford Union was opened Saturday
evening in a maze of wit and laughter,
in which the students and alumni,
Faculty and Trustees joined with
equal share and pleasure. For the
first time since the inauguration or
President Bran*" ••, the four elements
of the quae' angle of Stanford life
came together in large numbers, and
never before in the history of the Uni
versity have they come together with
the same amount of true Stanford
Spirit thiit was displayed on Saturday
night.
Charles K. Field, '95, genial master
of ceremonies, announced early in the
evening that the opening must be
a typical Stanford Union event.
Though no one could know before
hand what a typical Stanford Union
evening would be like, every one felt
when it was all over that he had ex
perienced one. Tradition was made for
the new building, through the delight
ful informality, as tradition was made
for the University by the Pioneers
when the Quadrangle was new.
In clever speech and ready repartee,
in joke and song, all four of the ele
ments mingled, to a degree that even
the men who conceived the idea of the
Union where all Stanford men might
join together, could not have desired
more. The Board of Trustees was rep
resented by five of its members —
Trustees Newhall, Stow. Hopkins,
Grant, and Arnold, nil of whom spoke
during the evening; many members of
the Faculty were in the crowd, and
they were represented on the informal
program by Professor Charles David
.Marx, who presided, Chancellor Jor
dan, President Branner, and Assistant
Professor E. P. Lesley. For the alum
ni Charles K. Field, '95, Shirley Bak
er. '95, and Bernard Laskey, '12, en
tertained, and woe to the man who
tried to engage Field, as master of
ceremonies, in repartee. With it all
were the stunts by many students. The
affair was all a gay riot of song and
laughter, in which all joined alike as
Stanford men.
While the Stanford band played in
the evening, plenty of time was given
to inspect the new building. The first
floor, with its rooms for offices and
concessions, the main floor with its
large spring floor ball room, and its
annex, the library and committee
rooms, and finally the apartments on

the third floor, were in turn admired
by the throng to whom Stanford Union
had so long been only a great white
exterior.
Reception Held for Women.
The inspection of the men was sup
planted yesterday afternoon by the
visit of the women of the University
at the reception given for them.
Though the heavy rain which lasted
all day prevented a large attendance,
a number of people were present in
the afternoon, and others came in
during the reception and viewed the
new building.
The furniture of the old Stanford
residence, loaned to the Union by the
University, was seen in many of the
rooms. The library is almost entirely
furnished with it. The bookcases, the
table, and the chairs placed there were
the personal property of the Found
ers. In speaking of these relics,
Charles K. Field, editor of Sunset Mag
azine. said: "In the library is the
table at which I have eaten with the
Founders, and around which you might
have sat with them if they had lived,
for it was their wish to come in per
sonal touch with all of their stu
dents."
Program for the Opening Night.
Order was finally called, and as
many of the men as could went into
the main room, while the others gath
ered around the doors. Probably five
hundred men were in the building at
some time during the evening, and
most of those who came for a hasty
look, soon mingled in the fun and re
mained all evening—many of whom
thought that Stanford democracy will
never be more than it is now, got a
glimpse of something which the Union
will develop, which cannot but make
it all the men working for it desired.
Professor Marx, acting president of
the Stanford Union, presided. In his
opening talk he paid tribute to the
many Stanford alumni who had made
the Union possible—to Herbert C.
Hoover. '95, who first conceived the
idea of the building, where the old
spirit of Stanford democracy, then in
danger of disappearing from the cam
pus, might have a renewal; to Fred
erick Hall Fowler, '05, chairman of
the building committee, under whose
direction all the work of construction
has been carried on, and whose labor

time; to R. W. Barrett, '04, and E. \V.
Smith, '99, secretaries in turn of the
Union, who have had all the work of
collecting funds and much of the busi
ness interests of the enterprise to di
rect; to A. F. Rossi, ex-'9B, the archi
tect who designed the Union, and as
sisted materially during its period of
construction; and to all the loyal
alumni who have assisted in its com
pletion.
('. k. Field Takes Charge.
"Daddy" Marx then gave charge of
the evening to Mr. Field. He said the
one object, of those in charge of the
opening of Stanford Union was to
make the event a typical Stanford
Union affair, which he interpreted to
mean no program had been arranged.
Rut in the front row of the many
men seated on the floor of the main
room were a number of the "old
men" who remembered the prowess of
Shirley Raker, '95, as a stunt man with
the first Glee Club organized at Stan
ford, and as soon as Field had fin
ished speaking Baker was put for
ward, and the fullness of the comedy
in portrayal of a day in a Southern
court room, persuaded the present
generation that his infringement of
the no-program was a happy one.
After Baker, George Crary, '17, was
called for and gave a banjo solo, ac
companied by W. G. Paul, '15. C. M.
Bradley, '99, got the floor, and in one
of the cleverest of the evening's
speeches, described the condition of
the Belgian sufferers. In the end he
called for a talk from Chancellor Jor
dan.
The reception of the Chancellor was
hearty, and on every occasion during
the evening when either of Stanford's
first presidents spoke the appreciation
of the Stanford men, old men and new
alike, broke out in applause. Speak
of the first days at. Stanford, he char
acterized the class of '95, as the best
pioneer class that ever attended any
University. "During those days of be
ginning," he said, "we used frequently
to be entertained by Shirley Baker and
his team-mate, a gentleman of the
name of Calliope Callienti, known tc
journalism as Carolus Ager, and to
every-day life as Charley Field. Her
bert C. Hoover was a member of this
class, and gained that great love for
the Stanford spirit which has actuated 1
his interest in the Union.
"Hoover gained his ideas for the i
Stanford Union from the Cambridge
Union. The boys there are a fine lot, !
and Hoover could see that the Union j
had done a lot to help them. We are
sorry Mr. Hoover cannot be with us
tonight, but he is busy in a good wo.rk
which keeps him in the East.
"I spoke to the boys at Glasgow
University recently. They told me
that they believed that Herbert C.
Hoover was directing the biggest job
ever undertaken by one nation in be
half of another."
Dr. Jordan gave a brief recount of
the conditions in Belgium, and ex
pressed his great appreciation of the
fact that Stanford had already done
so much in the work of .relieving'this
condition, in sending between five and
six thousand dollars to the sufferers.
It was learned afterwards that $1200
has just been sent to San Francisco to '
add to the Belgian fund. With the
goods sent on the Camino, and the
funds raised in the first contributibn,
this makes $5000 already raised at
Stanford. Pledges of $500 a month in
the fifty-cent campaign, which are due
for two more months, will raise this
amount to $GOOO.
Following the opening a cable mes- i
sage of greeting was sent to Mr.
Hoover in London, telling him of the
event.
After Dr. Jordan's talk, Messrs.
Field and Baker responded to calls
from the audience and sang a song
of Stanford composed by Carolus Ag
er. W. C. Bacon, '14, leading man in
"At the Dragon's Eye," the Junior
Opera, then entertained with a bari
tone solo, singing in his rich baritone
voice "Still wie die Nacht." As an
encore he sang "The Little Gray Home
in the West." C. W. Timmins, '16, ac
companied him.
Vanderlynn Stow, Business Manager
of the University, when asked to speak,
told of the conditions at Harvard
while he attended that institution, of
the entire lack of sympathy between
the students and Facility, a condition
which President Lowell is now trying
to get away from, in order to bring a
feeling of co-operation between the
three elements of Harvard life. He
then said: "I have tried to do my
part to bring about such a feeling at
Stanford, and I think I see it coming
with this building as the evidence. The
thing which Chancellor Jordan start
ed, and President Branner carried on,
the Trustees want to help complete by
their co-operation.
Dr. Branner expressed his pleasure
and that of the Faculty in seeing the
Stanford Union completed, and told of
their wish to co-operate to make it a
success. Later he gave a practical
example of the desire to co-operate, by
offering to buy six life memberships
in the Union. In answer to the ques
tions which have been asked concern
ing his intention of resigning as presi
dent, Dr. Branner reaffirmed the
statement that he would resign, illus
trating his avowed intention with a
humorous story of his boyhood.
After a violin solo by D. E. Shepard
son, '17, Ralph Arnold, '99, the newly
elected member of the Board of Trus
tees, was asked to speak. He ex
pressed his appreciation of the honor
that had just been bestowed upon
him, the second alumnus to be elected
to the Board, and said: "My one am
bition in my new position, will be to
infuse Stanford spirit into the Board of
Trustees of the University, and do all
in my power to have the board act al
ways for the best interests of the
University."
Then, in turn, the other trustees
were called upon, and in a few words
William Mayo Newhall, Timothy Hop
kins, and Joseph D. Grant, in the hap
py, but withal sincere spirit of the
evening, told of their pleasure in see
ing the Union completed, and their de
sire fo,r closer co-operation between
the students and the Hoard.
Assistant Professor E. P. Lesley fol
lowed, giving in clever dialect some of
the old negro folk-stories written by
President Branner. Then came more
musical stunts, given by Bernard Las
key, '12. J. R. Morgan, '16, and the Glee
Club Quartet, who sang a medley. The
music struck home, and every enter
tainer was called back fo.r an encore.
Much credit goes to W. G. Paul, '15,
and J. R. Morgan, '16, who arranged
for the work of the local stunt men.
But the real credit for the success
goes to all Stanford men who attend
ed and co-operated with true Stanford
spirit.

ing class from the Pioneers of "ninety
five" to that whose members received
their diplomas last May, were present

Program for the Opening Night.
Order was finally called, and as
many of the men as could went into
the main room, while the others gath
ered around the doors. Probably five
hundred men were in the building at
some time during the evening, and
most of those who came for a hasty
look, soon mingled in the fun and re
mained all evening—many of whom
thought that Stanford democracy will
never be more than it is now, got a
glimpse of something which the Union
will develop, which cannot but make
it all the men working for it desired.
Professor Marx, acting president of
the Stanford Union, presided. In his
opening talk he paid tribute to the
many Stanford alumni who had made
the Union possible—to Herbert C.
Hoover. '95, who first conceived the
idea of the building, where the old
spirit of Stanford democracy, then in
danger of disappearing from the cam
pus, might have a renewal; to Fred
erick Hall Fowler, '05, chairman of
the building committee, under whose
direction all the work of construction
has been carried on, and whose labor

time; to R. W. Barrett, '04, and E. \V.
Smith, '99, secretaries in turn of the
Union, who have had all the work of
collecting funds and much of the busi
ness interests of the enterprise to di
rect; to A. F. Rossi, ex-'9B, the archi
tect who designed the Union, and as
sisted materially during its period of
construction; and to all the loyal
alumni who have assisted in its com
pletion.
('. k. Field Takes Charge.
"Daddy" Marx then gave charge of
the evening to Mr. Field. He said the
one object, of those in charge of the
opening of Stanford Union was to
make the event a typical Stanford
Union affair, which he interpreted to
mean no program had been arranged.
Rut in the front row of the many
men seated on the floor of the main
room were a number of the "old
men" who remembered the prowess of
Shirley Raker, '95, as a stunt man with
the first Glee Club organized at Stan
ford, and as soon as Field had fin
ished speaking Baker was put for
ward, and the fullness of the comedy
in portrayal of a day in a Southern
court room, persuaded the present
generation that his infringement of
the no-program was a happy one.
After Baker, George Crary, '17, was
called for and gave a banjo solo, ac
companied by W. G. Paul, '15. C. M.
Bradley, '99, got the floor, and in one
of the cleverest of the evening's
speeches, described the condition of
the Belgian sufferers. In the end he
called for a talk from Chancellor Jor
dan.
The reception of the Chancellor was
hearty, and on every occasion during
the evening when either of Stanford's
first presidents spoke the appreciation
of the Stanford men, old men and new
alike, broke out in applause. Speak
of the first days at. Stanford, he char
acterized the class of '95, as the best
pioneer class that ever attended any
University. "During those days of be
ginning," he said, "we used frequently
to be entertained by Shirley Baker and
his team-mate, a gentleman of the
name of Calliope Callienti, known tc
journalism as Carolus Ager, and to
every-day life as Charley Field. Her
bert C. Hoover was a member of this
class, and gained that great love for
the Stanford spirit which has actuated 1
his interest in the Union.
"Hoover gained his ideas for the i
Stanford Union from the Cambridge
Union. The boys there are a fine lot, !
and Hoover could see that the Union j
had done a lot to help them. We are
sorry Mr. Hoover cannot be with us
tonight, but he is busy in a good wo.rk
which keeps him in the East.
"I spoke to the boys at Glasgow
University recently. They told me
that they believed that Herbert C.
Hoover was directing the biggest job
ever undertaken by one nation in be
half of another."
Dr. Jordan gave a brief recount of
the conditions in Belgium, and ex
pressed his great appreciation of the
fact that Stanford had already done
so much in the work of .relieving'this
condition, in sending between five and
six thousand dollars to the sufferers.
It was learned afterwards that $1200
has just been sent to San Francisco to '
add to the Belgian fund. With the
goods sent on the Camino, and the
funds raised in the first contributibn,
this makes $5000 already raised at
Stanford. Pledges of $500 a month in
the fifty-cent campaign, which are due
for two more months, will raise this
amount to $GOOO.
Following the opening a cable mes- i
sage of greeting was sent to Mr.
Hoover in London, telling him of the
event.
After Dr. Jordan's talk, Messrs.
Field and Baker responded to calls
from the audience and sang a song
of Stanford composed by Carolus Ag
er. W. C. Bacon, '14, leading man in
"At the Dragon's Eye," the Junior
Opera, then entertained with a bari
tone solo, singing in his rich baritone
voice "Still wie die Nacht." As an
encore he sang "The Little Gray Home
in the West." C. W. Timmins, '16, ac
companied him.
Vanderlynn Stow, Business Manager
of the University, when asked to speak,
told of the conditions at Harvard
while he attended that institution, of
the entire lack of sympathy between
the students and Facility, a condition
which President Lowell is now trying
to get away from, in order to bring a
feeling of co-operation between the
three elements of Harvard life. He
then said: "I have tried to do my
part to bring about such a feeling at
Stanford, and I think I see it coming
with this building as the evidence. The
thing which Chancellor Jordan start
ed, and President Branner carried on,
the Trustees want to help complete by
their co-operation.
Dr. Branner expressed his pleasure
and that of the Faculty in seeing the
Stanford Union completed, and told of
their wish to co-operate to make it a
success. Later he gave a practical
example of the desire to co-operate, by
offering to buy six life memberships
in the Union. In answer to the ques
tions which have been asked concern
ing his intention of resigning as presi
dent, Dr. Branner reaffirmed the
statement that he would resign, illus
trating his avowed intention with a
humorous story of his boyhood.
After a violin solo by D. E. Shepard
son, '17, Ralph Arnold, '99, the newly
elected member of the Board of Trus
tees, was asked to speak. He ex
pressed his appreciation of the honor
that had just been bestowed upon
him, the second alumnus to be elected
to the Board, and said: "My one am
bition in my new position, will be to
infuse Stanford spirit into the Board of
Trustees of the University, and do all
in my power to have the board act al
ways for the best interests of the
University."
Then, in turn, the other trustees
were called upon, and in a few words
William Mayo Newhall, Timothy Hop
kins, and Joseph D. Grant, in the hap
py, but withal sincere spirit of the
evening, told of their pleasure in see
ing the Union completed, and their de
sire fo,r closer co-operation between
the students and the Hoard.
Assistant Professor E. P. Lesley fol
lowed, giving in clever dialect some of
the old negro folk-stories written by
President Branner. Then came more
musical stunts, given by Bernard Las
key, '12. J. R. Morgan, '16, and the Glee
Club Quartet, who sang a medley. The
music struck home, and every enter
tainer was called back fo.r an encore.
Much credit goes to W. G. Paul, '15,
and J. R. Morgan, '16, who arranged
for the work of the local stunt men.
But the real credit for the success
goes to all Stanford men who attend
ed and co-operated with true Stanford
spirit.

ing class from the Pioneers of "ninety
five" to that whose members received
their diplomas last May, were present

had made the opening possible at this
Stanford Union was opened Saturday
evening in a maze of wit and laughter,
in which the students and alumni,
Faculty and Trustees joined with
equal share and pleasure. For the
first time since the inauguration or
President Bran*" ••, the four elements
of the quae' angle of Stanford life
came together in large numbers, and
never before in the history of the Uni
versity have they come together with
the same amount of true Stanford
Spirit thiit was displayed on Saturday
night.
Charles K. Field, '95, genial master
of ceremonies, announced early in the
evening that the opening must be
a typical Stanford Union event.
Though no one could know before
hand what a typical Stanford Union
evening would be like, every one felt
when it was all over that he had ex
perienced one. Tradition was made for
the new building, through the delight
ful informality, as tradition was made
for the University by the Pioneers
when the Quadrangle was new.
In clever speech and ready repartee,
in joke and song, all four of the ele
ments mingled, to a degree that even
the men who conceived the idea of the
Union where all Stanford men might
join together, could not have desired
more. The Board of Trustees was rep
resented by five of its members —
Trustees Newhall, Stow. Hopkins,
Grant, and Arnold, nil of whom spoke
during the evening; many members of
the Faculty were in the crowd, and
they were represented on the informal
program by Professor Charles David
.Marx, who presided, Chancellor Jor
dan, President Branner, and Assistant
Professor E. P. Lesley. For the alum
ni Charles K. Field, '95, Shirley Bak
er. '95, and Bernard Laskey, '12, en
tertained, and woe to the man who
tried to engage Field, as master of
ceremonies, in repartee. With it all
were the stunts by many students. The
affair was all a gay riot of song and
laughter, in which all joined alike as
Stanford men.
While the Stanford band played in
the evening, plenty of time was given
to inspect the new building. The first
floor, with its rooms for offices and
concessions, the main floor with its
large spring floor ball room, and its
annex, the library and committee
rooms, and finally the apartments on

the third floor, were in turn admired
by the throng to whom Stanford Union
had so long been only a great white
exterior.
Reception Held for Women.
The inspection of the men was sup
planted yesterday afternoon by the
visit of the women of the University
at the reception given for them.
Though the heavy rain which lasted
all day prevented a large attendance,
a number of people were present in
the afternoon, and others came in
during the reception and viewed the
new building.
The furniture of the old Stanford
residence, loaned to the Union by the
University, was seen in many of the
rooms. The library is almost entirely
furnished with it. The bookcases, the
table, and the chairs placed there were
the personal property of the Found
ers. In speaking of these relics,
Charles K. Field, editor of Sunset Mag
azine. said: "In the library is the
table at which I have eaten with the
Founders, and around which you might
have sat with them if they had lived,
for it was their wish to come in per
sonal touch with all of their stu
dents."

"Hoover gained his ideas for the i
Stanford Union from the Cambridge
Union. The boys there are a fine lot, !
and Hoover could see that the Union j
had done a lot to help them. We are
sorry Mr. Hoover cannot be with us
tonight, but he is busy in a good wo.rk
which keeps him in the East.
"I spoke to the boys at Glasgow
University recently. They told me
that they believed that Herbert C.
Hoover was directing the biggest job
ever undertaken by one nation in be
half of another."
Dr. Jordan gave a brief recount of
the conditions in Belgium, and ex
pressed his great appreciation of the
fact that Stanford had already done
so much in the work of .relieving'this
condition, in sending between five and
six thousand dollars to the sufferers.
It was learned afterwards that $1200
has just been sent to San Francisco to '
add to the Belgian fund. With the
goods sent on the Camino, and the
funds raised in the first contributibn,
this makes $5000 already raised at
Stanford. Pledges of $500 a month in
the fifty-cent campaign, which are due
for two more months, will raise this
amount to $GOOO.
Following the opening a cable mes- i
sage of greeting was sent to Mr.
Hoover in London, telling him of the
event.
After Dr. Jordan's talk, Messrs.
Field and Baker responded to calls
from the audience and sang a song
of Stanford composed by Carolus Ag
er. W. C. Bacon, '14, leading man in
"At the Dragon's Eye," the Junior
Opera, then entertained with a bari
tone solo, singing in his rich baritone
voice "Still wie die Nacht." As an
encore he sang "The Little Gray Home
in the West." C. W. Timmins, '16, ac
companied him.
Vanderlynn Stow, Business Manager
of the University, when asked to speak,
told of the conditions at Harvard
while he attended that institution, of
the entire lack of sympathy between
the students and Facility, a condition
which President Lowell is now trying
to get away from, in order to bring a
feeling of co-operation between the
three elements of Harvard life. He
then said: "I have tried to do my
part to bring about such a feeling at
Stanford, and I think I see it coming
with this building as the evidence. The
thing which Chancellor Jordan start
ed, and President Branner carried on,
the Trustees want to help complete by
their co-operation.
Dr. Branner expressed his pleasure
and that of the Faculty in seeing the
Stanford Union completed, and told of
their wish to co-operate to make it a
success. Later he gave a practical
example of the desire to co-operate, by
offering to buy six life memberships
in the Union. In answer to the ques
tions which have been asked concern
ing his intention of resigning as presi
dent, Dr. Branner reaffirmed the
statement that he would resign, illus
trating his avowed intention with a
humorous story of his boyhood.
After a violin solo by D. E. Shepard
son, '17, Ralph Arnold, '99, the newly
elected member of the Board of Trus
tees, was asked to speak. He ex
pressed his appreciation of the honor
that had just been bestowed upon
him, the second alumnus to be elected
to the Board, and said: "My one am
bition in my new position, will be to
infuse Stanford spirit into the Board of
Trustees of the University, and do all
in my power to have the board act al
ways for the best interests of the
University."
Then, in turn, the other trustees
were called upon, and in a few words
William Mayo Newhall, Timothy Hop
kins, and Joseph D. Grant, in the hap
py, but withal sincere spirit of the
evening, told of their pleasure in see
ing the Union completed, and their de
sire fo,r closer co-operation between
the students and the Hoard.
Assistant Professor E. P. Lesley fol
lowed, giving in clever dialect some of
the old negro folk-stories written by
President Branner. Then came more
musical stunts, given by Bernard Las
key, '12. J. R. Morgan, '16, and the Glee
Club Quartet, who sang a medley. The
music struck home, and every enter
tainer was called back fo.r an encore.
Much credit goes to W. G. Paul, '15,
and J. R. Morgan, '16, who arranged
for the work of the local stunt men.
But the real credit for the success
goes to all Stanford men who attend
ed and co-operated with true Stanford
spirit.

had made the opening possible at this
Stanford Union was opened Saturday
evening in a maze of wit and laughter,
in which the students and alumni,
Faculty and Trustees joined with
equal share and pleasure. For the
first time since the inauguration or
President Bran*" ••, the four elements
of the quae' angle of Stanford life
came together in large numbers, and
never before in the history of the Uni
versity have they come together with
the same amount of true Stanford
Spirit thiit was displayed on Saturday
night.
Charles K. Field, '95, genial master
of ceremonies, announced early in the
evening that the opening must be
a typical Stanford Union event.
Though no one could know before
hand what a typical Stanford Union
evening would be like, every one felt
when it was all over that he had ex
perienced one. Tradition was made for
the new building, through the delight
ful informality, as tradition was made
for the University by the Pioneers
when the Quadrangle was new.
In clever speech and ready repartee,
in joke and song, all four of the ele
ments mingled, to a degree that even
the men who conceived the idea of the
Union where all Stanford men might
join together, could not have desired
more. The Board of Trustees was rep
resented by five of its members —
Trustees Newhall, Stow. Hopkins,
Grant, and Arnold, nil of whom spoke
during the evening; many members of
the Faculty were in the crowd, and
they were represented on the informal
program by Professor Charles David
.Marx, who presided, Chancellor Jor
dan, President Branner, and Assistant
Professor E. P. Lesley. For the alum
ni Charles K. Field, '95, Shirley Bak
er. '95, and Bernard Laskey, '12, en
tertained, and woe to the man who
tried to engage Field, as master of
ceremonies, in repartee. With it all
were the stunts by many students. The
affair was all a gay riot of song and
laughter, in which all joined alike as
Stanford men.
While the Stanford band played in
the evening, plenty of time was given
to inspect the new building. The first
floor, with its rooms for offices and
concessions, the main floor with its
large spring floor ball room, and its
annex, the library and committee
rooms, and finally the apartments on

the third floor, were in turn admired
by the throng to whom Stanford Union
had so long been only a great white
exterior.
Reception Held for Women.
The inspection of the men was sup
planted yesterday afternoon by the
visit of the women of the University
at the reception given for them.
Though the heavy rain which lasted
all day prevented a large attendance,
a number of people were present in
the afternoon, and others came in
during the reception and viewed the
new building.
The furniture of the old Stanford
residence, loaned to the Union by the
University, was seen in many of the
rooms. The library is almost entirely
furnished with it. The bookcases, the
table, and the chairs placed there were
the personal property of the Found
ers. In speaking of these relics,
Charles K. Field, editor of Sunset Mag
azine. said: "In the library is the
table at which I have eaten with the
Founders, and around which you might
have sat with them if they had lived,
for it was their wish to come in per
sonal touch with all of their stu
dents."
Program for the Opening Night.
Order was finally called, and as
many of the men as could went into
the main room, while the others gath
ered around the doors. Probably five
hundred men were in the building at
some time during the evening, and
most of those who came for a hasty
look, soon mingled in the fun and re
mained all evening—many of whom
thought that Stanford democracy will
never be more than it is now, got a
glimpse of something which the Union
will develop, which cannot but make
it all the men working for it desired.
Professor Marx, acting president of
the Stanford Union, presided. In his
opening talk he paid tribute to the
many Stanford alumni who had made
the Union possible—to Herbert C.
Hoover. '95, who first conceived the
idea of the building, where the old
spirit of Stanford democracy, then in
danger of disappearing from the cam
pus, might have a renewal; to Fred
erick Hall Fowler, '05, chairman of
the building committee, under whose
direction all the work of construction
has been carried on, and whose labor

time; to R. W. Barrett, '04, and E. \V.
Smith, '99, secretaries in turn of the
Union, who have had all the work of
collecting funds and much of the busi
ness interests of the enterprise to di
rect; to A. F. Rossi, ex-'9B, the archi
tect who designed the Union, and as
sisted materially during its period of
construction; and to all the loyal
alumni who have assisted in its com
pletion.
('. k. Field Takes Charge.
"Daddy" Marx then gave charge of
the evening to Mr. Field. He said the
one object, of those in charge of the
opening of Stanford Union was to
make the event a typical Stanford
Union affair, which he interpreted to
mean no program had been arranged.
Rut in the front row of the many
men seated on the floor of the main
room were a number of the "old
men" who remembered the prowess of
Shirley Raker, '95, as a stunt man with
the first Glee Club organized at Stan
ford, and as soon as Field had fin
ished speaking Baker was put for
ward, and the fullness of the comedy
in portrayal of a day in a Southern
court room, persuaded the present
generation that his infringement of
the no-program was a happy one.
After Baker, George Crary, '17, was
called for and gave a banjo solo, ac
companied by W. G. Paul, '15. C. M.
Bradley, '99, got the floor, and in one
of the cleverest of the evening's
speeches, described the condition of
the Belgian sufferers. In the end he
called for a talk from Chancellor Jor
dan.
The reception of the Chancellor was
hearty, and on every occasion during
the evening when either of Stanford's
first presidents spoke the appreciation
of the Stanford men, old men and new
alike, broke out in applause. Speak
of the first days at. Stanford, he char
acterized the class of '95, as the best
pioneer class that ever attended any
University. "During those days of be
ginning," he said, "we used frequently
to be entertained by Shirley Baker and
his team-mate, a gentleman of the
name of Calliope Callienti, known tc
journalism as Carolus Ager, and to
every-day life as Charley Field. Her
bert C. Hoover was a member of this
class, and gained that great love for
the Stanford spirit which has actuated 1
his interest in the Union.
"Hoover gained his ideas for the i
Stanford Union from the Cambridge
Union. The boys there are a fine lot, !
and Hoover could see that the Union j

were called upon, and in a few words
William Mayo Newhall, Timothy Hop

Much credit goes to W. G. Paul, '15,

had made the opening possible at this
Stanford Union was opened Saturday
evening in a maze of wit and laughter,
in which the students and alumni,
Faculty and Trustees joined with
equal share and pleasure. For the
first time since the inauguration or
President Bran*" ••, the four elements
of the quae' angle of Stanford life
came together in large numbers, and
never before in the history of the Uni
versity have they come together with
the same amount of true Stanford
Spirit thiit was displayed on Saturday
night.
Charles K. Field, '95, genial master
of ceremonies, announced early in the
evening that the opening must be
a typical Stanford Union event.
Though no one could know before
hand what a typical Stanford Union
evening would be like, every one felt
when it was all over that he had ex
perienced one. Tradition was made for
the new building, through the delight
ful informality, as tradition was made
for the University by the Pioneers
when the Quadrangle was new.
In clever speech and ready repartee,
in joke and song, all four of the ele
ments mingled, to a degree that even
the men who conceived the idea of the
Union where all Stanford men might
join together, could not have desired
more. The Board of Trustees was rep
resented by five of its members —
Trustees Newhall, Stow. Hopkins,
Grant, and Arnold, nil of whom spoke
during the evening; many members of
the Faculty were in the crowd, and
they were represented on the informal
program by Professor Charles David
.Marx, who presided, Chancellor Jor
dan, President Branner, and Assistant
Professor E. P. Lesley. For the alum
ni Charles K. Field, '95, Shirley Bak
er. '95, and Bernard Laskey, '12, en
tertained, and woe to the man who
tried to engage Field, as master of
ceremonies, in repartee. With it all
were the stunts by many students. The
affair was all a gay riot of song and
laughter, in which all joined alike as
Stanford men.
While the Stanford band played in
the evening, plenty of time was given
to inspect the new building. The first
floor, with its rooms for offices and
concessions, the main floor with its
large spring floor ball room, and its
annex, the library and committee
rooms, and finally the apartments on

the third floor, were in turn admired
by the throng to whom Stanford Union
had so long been only a great white
exterior.
Reception Held for Women.
The inspection of the men was sup
planted yesterday afternoon by the
visit of the women of the University
at the reception given for them.
Though the heavy rain which lasted
all day prevented a large attendance,
a number of people were present in
the afternoon, and others came in
during the reception and viewed the
new building.
The furniture of the old Stanford
residence, loaned to the Union by the
University, was seen in many of the
rooms. The library is almost entirely
furnished with it. The bookcases, the
table, and the chairs placed there were
the personal property of the Found
ers. In speaking of these relics,
Charles K. Field, editor of Sunset Mag
azine. said: "In the library is the
table at which I have eaten with the
Founders, and around which you might
have sat with them if they had lived,
for it was their wish to come in per
sonal touch with all of their stu
dents."
Program for the Opening Night.
Order was finally called, and as
many of the men as could went into
the main room, while the others gath
ered around the doors. Probably five
hundred men were in the building at
some time during the evening, and
most of those who came for a hasty
look, soon mingled in the fun and re
mained all evening—many of whom
thought that Stanford democracy will
never be more than it is now, got a
glimpse of something which the Union
will develop, which cannot but make
it all the men working for it desired.
Professor Marx, acting president of
the Stanford Union, presided. In his
opening talk he paid tribute to the
many Stanford alumni who had made
the Union possible—to Herbert C.
Hoover. '95, who first conceived the
idea of the building, where the old
spirit of Stanford democracy, then in
danger of disappearing from the cam
pus, might have a renewal; to Fred
erick Hall Fowler, '05, chairman of
the building committee, under whose
direction all the work of construction
has been carried on, and whose labor

time; to R. W. Barrett, '04, and E. \V.
Smith, '99, secretaries in turn of the
Union, who have had all the work of
collecting funds and much of the busi
ness interests of the enterprise to di
rect; to A. F. Rossi, ex-'9B, the archi
tect who designed the Union, and as
sisted materially during its period of
construction; and to all the loyal
alumni who have assisted in its com
pletion.
('. k. Field Takes Charge.
"Daddy" Marx then gave charge of
the evening to Mr. Field. He said the
one object, of those in charge of the
opening of Stanford Union was to
make the event a typical Stanford
Union affair, which he interpreted to
mean no program had been arranged.
Rut in the front row of the many
men seated on the floor of the main
room were a number of the "old
men" who remembered the prowess of
Shirley Raker, '95, as a stunt man with
the first Glee Club organized at Stan
ford, and as soon as Field had fin
ished speaking Baker was put for
ward, and the fullness of the comedy
in portrayal of a day in a Southern
court room, persuaded the present
generation that his infringement of
the no-program was a happy one.
After Baker, George Crary, '17, was
called for and gave a banjo solo, ac
companied by W. G. Paul, '15. C. M.
Bradley, '99, got the floor, and in one
of the cleverest of the evening's
speeches, described the condition of
the Belgian sufferers. In the end he
called for a talk from Chancellor Jor
dan.
The reception of the Chancellor was
hearty, and on every occasion during
the evening when either of Stanford's
first presidents spoke the appreciation
of the Stanford men, old men and new
alike, broke out in applause. Speak
of the first days at. Stanford, he char
acterized the class of '95, as the best
pioneer class that ever attended any
University. "During those days of be
ginning," he said, "we used frequently
to be entertained by Shirley Baker and
his team-mate, a gentleman of the
name of Calliope Callienti, known tc
journalism as Carolus Ager, and to
every-day life as Charley Field. Her
bert C. Hoover was a member of this
class, and gained that great love for
the Stanford spirit which has actuated 1
his interest in the Union.
"Hoover gained his ideas for the i
Stanford Union from the Cambridge
Union. The boys there are a fine lot, !
and Hoover could see that the Union j
had done a lot to help them. We are
sorry Mr. Hoover cannot be with us
tonight, but he is busy in a good wo.rk
which keeps him in the East.
"I spoke to the boys at Glasgow
University recently. They told me
that they believed that Herbert C.
Hoover was directing the biggest job
ever undertaken by one nation in be
half of another."
Dr. Jordan gave a brief recount of
the conditions in Belgium, and ex
pressed his great appreciation of the
fact that Stanford had already done
so much in the work of .relieving'this
condition, in sending between five and
six thousand dollars to the sufferers.
It was learned afterwards that $1200
has just been sent to San Francisco to '
add to the Belgian fund. With the
goods sent on the Camino, and the
funds raised in the first contributibn,
this makes $5000 already raised at
Stanford. Pledges of $500 a month in
the fifty-cent campaign, which are due
for two more months, will raise this
amount to $GOOO.
Following the opening a cable mes- i
sage of greeting was sent to Mr.
Hoover in London, telling him of the
event.
After Dr. Jordan's talk, Messrs.
Field and Baker responded to calls
from the audience and sang a song
of Stanford composed by Carolus Ag
er. W. C. Bacon, '14, leading man in
"At the Dragon's Eye," the Junior
Opera, then entertained with a bari
tone solo, singing in his rich baritone
voice "Still wie die Nacht." As an
encore he sang "The Little Gray Home
in the West." C. W. Timmins, '16, ac
companied him.
Vanderlynn Stow, Business Manager
of the University, when asked to speak,
told of the conditions at Harvard
while he attended that institution, of
the entire lack of sympathy between
the students and Facility, a condition
which President Lowell is now trying
to get away from, in order to bring a
feeling of co-operation between the
three elements of Harvard life. He
then said: "I have tried to do my
part to bring about such a feeling at
Stanford, and I think I see it coming
with this building as the evidence. The
thing which Chancellor Jordan start
ed, and President Branner carried on,
the Trustees want to help complete by
their co-operation.
Dr. Branner expressed his pleasure
and that of the Faculty in seeing the
Stanford Union completed, and told of
their wish to co-operate to make it a
success. Later he gave a practical
example of the desire to co-operate, by
offering to buy six life memberships
in the Union. In answer to the ques
tions which have been asked concern
ing his intention of resigning as presi
dent, Dr. Branner reaffirmed the
statement that he would resign, illus
trating his avowed intention with a
humorous story of his boyhood.
After a violin solo by D. E. Shepard
son, '17, Ralph Arnold, '99, the newly
elected member of the Board of Trus
tees, was asked to speak. He ex
pressed his appreciation of the honor
that had just been bestowed upon
him, the second alumnus to be elected
to the Board, and said: "My one am
bition in my new position, will be to
infuse Stanford spirit into the Board of
Trustees of the University, and do all
in my power to have the board act al
ways for the best interests of the
University."
Then, in turn, the other trustees
were called upon, and in a few words
William Mayo Newhall, Timothy Hop
kins, and Joseph D. Grant, in the hap

had made the opening possible at this
Stanford Union was opened Saturday
evening in a maze of wit and laughter,
in which the students and alumni,
Faculty and Trustees joined with
equal share and pleasure. For the
first time since the inauguration or
President Bran*" ••, the four elements
of the quae' angle of Stanford life
came together in large numbers, and
never before in the history of the Uni
versity have they come together with
the same amount of true Stanford
Spirit thiit was displayed on Saturday
night.
Charles K. Field, '95, genial master
of ceremonies, announced early in the
evening that the opening must be
a typical Stanford Union event.
Though no one could know before
hand what a typical Stanford Union
evening would be like, every one felt
when it was all over that he had ex
perienced one. Tradition was made for
the new building, through the delight
ful informality, as tradition was made
for the University by the Pioneers
when the Quadrangle was new.
In clever speech and ready repartee,
in joke and song, all four of the ele
ments mingled, to a degree that even
the men who conceived the idea of the
Union where all Stanford men might
join together, could not have desired
more. The Board of Trustees was rep
resented by five of its members —
Trustees Newhall, Stow. Hopkins,
Grant, and Arnold, nil of whom spoke
during the evening; many members of
the Faculty were in the crowd, and
they were represented on the informal
program by Professor Charles David
.Marx, who presided, Chancellor Jor
dan, President Branner, and Assistant
Professor E. P. Lesley. For the alum
ni Charles K. Field, '95, Shirley Bak
er. '95, and Bernard Laskey, '12, en
tertained, and woe to the man who
tried to engage Field, as master of
ceremonies, in repartee. With it all
were the stunts by many students. The
affair was all a gay riot of song and
laughter, in which all joined alike as
Stanford men.
While the Stanford band played in
the evening, plenty of time was given
to inspect the new building. The first
floor, with its rooms for offices and
concessions, the main floor with its
large spring floor ball room, and its
annex, the library and committee
rooms, and finally the apartments on

the third floor, were in turn admired
by the throng to whom Stanford Union
had so long been only a great white
exterior.
Reception Held for Women.
The inspection of the men was sup
planted yesterday afternoon by the
visit of the women of the University
at the reception given for them.
Though the heavy rain which lasted
all day prevented a large attendance,
a number of people were present in
the afternoon, and others came in
during the reception and viewed the
new building.
The furniture of the old Stanford
residence, loaned to the Union by the
University, was seen in many of the
rooms. The library is almost entirely
furnished with it. The bookcases, the
table, and the chairs placed there were
the personal property of the Found
ers. In speaking of these relics,
Charles K. Field, editor of Sunset Mag
azine. said: "In the library is the
table at which I have eaten with the
Founders, and around which you might
have sat with them if they had lived,
for it was their wish to come in per
sonal touch with all of their stu
dents."
Program for the Opening Night.
Order was finally called, and as
many of the men as could went into
the main room, while the others gath
ered around the doors. Probably five
hundred men were in the building at
some time during the evening, and
most of those who came for a hasty
look, soon mingled in the fun and re
mained all evening—many of whom
thought that Stanford democracy will
never be more than it is now, got a
glimpse of something which the Union
will develop, which cannot but make
it all the men working for it desired.
Professor Marx, acting president of
the Stanford Union, presided. In his
opening talk he paid tribute to the
many Stanford alumni who had made
the Union possible—to Herbert C.
Hoover. '95, who first conceived the
idea of the building, where the old
spirit of Stanford democracy, then in
danger of disappearing from the cam
pus, might have a renewal; to Fred
erick Hall Fowler, '05, chairman of
the building committee, under whose
direction all the work of construction
has been carried on, and whose labor

time; to R. W. Barrett, '04, and E. \V.
Smith, '99, secretaries in turn of the
Union, who have had all the work of
collecting funds and much of the busi
ness interests of the enterprise to di
rect; to A. F. Rossi, ex-'9B, the archi
tect who designed the Union, and as
sisted materially during its period of
construction; and to all the loyal
alumni who have assisted in its com
pletion.
('. k. Field Takes Charge.
"Daddy" Marx then gave charge of
the evening to Mr. Field. He said the
one object, of those in charge of the
opening of Stanford Union was to
make the event a typical Stanford
Union affair, which he interpreted to
mean no program had been arranged.
Rut in the front row of the many
men seated on the floor of the main
room were a number of the "old
men" who remembered the prowess of
Shirley Raker, '95, as a stunt man with
the first Glee Club organized at Stan
ford, and as soon as Field had fin
ished speaking Baker was put for
ward, and the fullness of the comedy
in portrayal of a day in a Southern
court room, persuaded the present
generation that his infringement of
the no-program was a happy one.
After Baker, George Crary, '17, was
called for and gave a banjo solo, ac
companied by W. G. Paul, '15. C. M.
Bradley, '99, got the floor, and in one
of the cleverest of the evening's
speeches, described the condition of
the Belgian sufferers. In the end he
called for a talk from Chancellor Jor
dan.
The reception of the Chancellor was
hearty, and on every occasion during
the evening when either of Stanford's
first presidents spoke the appreciation
of the Stanford men, old men and new
alike, broke out in applause. Speak
of the first days at. Stanford, he char
acterized the class of '95, as the best
pioneer class that ever attended any
University. "During those days of be
ginning," he said, "we used frequently
to be entertained by Shirley Baker and
his team-mate, a gentleman of the
name of Calliope Callienti, known tc
journalism as Carolus Ager, and to
every-day life as Charley Field. Her
bert C. Hoover was a member of this
class, and gained that great love for
the Stanford spirit which has actuated 1
his interest in the Union.
"Hoover gained his ideas for the i
Stanford Union from the Cambridge
Union. The boys there are a fine lot, !
and Hoover could see that the Union j
had done a lot to help them. We are
sorry Mr. Hoover cannot be with us
tonight, but he is busy in a good wo.rk
which keeps him in the East.
"I spoke to the boys at Glasgow
University recently. They told me
that they believed that Herbert C.
Hoover was directing the biggest job
ever undertaken by one nation in be
half of another."
Dr. Jordan gave a brief recount of
the conditions in Belgium, and ex
pressed his great appreciation of the
fact that Stanford had already done
so much in the work of .relieving'this
condition, in sending between five and
six thousand dollars to the sufferers.
It was learned afterwards that $1200
has just been sent to San Francisco to '
add to the Belgian fund. With the
goods sent on the Camino, and the
funds raised in the first contributibn,
this makes $5000 already raised at
Stanford. Pledges of $500 a month in
the fifty-cent campaign, which are due
for two more months, will raise this
amount to $GOOO.
Following the opening a cable mes- i
sage of greeting was sent to Mr.
Hoover in London, telling him of the
event.
After Dr. Jordan's talk, Messrs.
Field and Baker responded to calls
from the audience and sang a song
of Stanford composed by Carolus Ag
er. W. C. Bacon, '14, leading man in
"At the Dragon's Eye," the Junior
Opera, then entertained with a bari
tone solo, singing in his rich baritone
voice "Still wie die Nacht." As an
encore he sang "The Little Gray Home
in the West." C. W. Timmins, '16, ac
companied him.
Vanderlynn Stow, Business Manager
of the University, when asked to speak,
told of the conditions at Harvard
while he attended that institution, of
the entire lack of sympathy between
the students and Facility, a condition
which President Lowell is now trying
to get away from, in order to bring a
feeling of co-operation between the
three elements of Harvard life. He
then said: "I have tried to do my
part to bring about such a feeling at
Stanford, and I think I see it coming
with this building as the evidence. The
thing which Chancellor Jordan start
ed, and President Branner carried on,
the Trustees want to help complete by
their co-operation.
Dr. Branner expressed his pleasure
and that of the Faculty in seeing the
Stanford Union completed, and told of
their wish to co-operate to make it a
success. Later he gave a practical
example of the desire to co-operate, by
offering to buy six life memberships
in the Union. In answer to the ques
tions which have been asked concern
ing his intention of resigning as presi
dent, Dr. Branner reaffirmed the
statement that he would resign, illus
trating his avowed intention with a
humorous story of his boyhood.
After a violin solo by D. E. Shepard
son, '17, Ralph Arnold, '99, the newly
elected member of the Board of Trus
tees, was asked to speak. He ex
pressed his appreciation of the honor
that had just been bestowed upon
him, the second alumnus to be elected
to the Board, and said: "My one am
bition in my new position, will be to
infuse Stanford spirit into the Board of
Trustees of the University, and do all
in my power to have the board act al
ways for the best interests of the
University."
Then, in turn, the other trustees
were called upon, and in a few words
William Mayo Newhall, Timothy Hop
kins, and Joseph D. Grant, in the hap
py, but withal sincere spirit of the
evening, told of their pleasure in see
ing the Union completed, and their de
sire fo,r closer co-operation between
the students and the Hoard.
Assistant Professor E. P. Lesley fol
lowed, giving in clever dialect some of
the old negro folk-stories written by
President Branner. Then came more
musical stunts, given by Bernard Las
key, '12. J. R. Morgan, '16, and the Glee
Club Quartet, who sang a medley. The
music struck home, and every enter
tainer was called back fo.r an encore.
Much credit goes to W. G. Paul, '15,
and J. R. Morgan, '16, who arranged
for the work of the local stunt men.
But the real credit for the success
goes to all Stanford men who attend
ed and co-operated with true Stanford
spirit.

ing class from the Pioneers of "ninety
five" to that whose members received
their diplomas last May, were present

Program for the Opening Night.
Order was finally called, and as
many of the men as could went into
the main room, while the others gath
ered around the doors. Probably five
hundred men were in the building at
some time during the evening, and
most of those who came for a hasty
look, soon mingled in the fun and re
mained all evening—many of whom
thought that Stanford democracy will
never be more than it is now, got a
glimpse of something which the Union
will develop, which cannot but make
it all the men working for it desired.
Professor Marx, acting president of
the Stanford Union, presided. In his
opening talk he paid tribute to the
many Stanford alumni who had made
the Union possible—to Herbert C.
Hoover. '95, who first conceived the
idea of the building, where the old
spirit of Stanford democracy, then in
danger of disappearing from the cam
pus, might have a renewal; to Fred
erick Hall Fowler, '05, chairman of
the building committee, under whose
direction all the work of construction
has been carried on, and whose labor

time; to R. W. Barrett, '04, and E. \V.
Smith, '99, secretaries in turn of the
Union, who have had all the work of
collecting funds and much of the busi
ness interests of the enterprise to di
rect; to A. F. Rossi, ex-'9B, the archi
tect who designed the Union, and as
sisted materially during its period of
construction; and to all the loyal
alumni who have assisted in its com
pletion.
('. k. Field Takes Charge.
"Daddy" Marx then gave charge of
the evening to Mr. Field. He said the
one object, of those in charge of the
opening of Stanford Union was to
make the event a typical Stanford
Union affair, which he interpreted to
mean no program had been arranged.
Rut in the front row of the many
men seated on the floor of the main
room were a number of the "old
men" who remembered the prowess of
Shirley Raker, '95, as a stunt man with
the first Glee Club organized at Stan
ford, and as soon as Field had fin
ished speaking Baker was put for
ward, and the fullness of the comedy
in portrayal of a day in a Southern
court room, persuaded the present
generation that his infringement of
the no-program was a happy one.
After Baker, George Crary, '17, was
called for and gave a banjo solo, ac
companied by W. G. Paul, '15. C. M.
Bradley, '99, got the floor, and in one
of the cleverest of the evening's
speeches, described the condition of
the Belgian sufferers. In the end he
called for a talk from Chancellor Jor
dan.
The reception of the Chancellor was
hearty, and on every occasion during
the evening when either of Stanford's
first presidents spoke the appreciation
of the Stanford men, old men and new
alike, broke out in applause. Speak
of the first days at. Stanford, he char
acterized the class of '95, as the best
pioneer class that ever attended any
University. "During those days of be
ginning," he said, "we used frequently
to be entertained by Shirley Baker and
his team-mate, a gentleman of the
name of Calliope Callienti, known tc
journalism as Carolus Ager, and to
every-day life as Charley Field. Her
bert C. Hoover was a member of this
class, and gained that great love for
the Stanford spirit which has actuated 1
his interest in the Union.
"Hoover gained his ideas for the i
Stanford Union from the Cambridge
Union. The boys there are a fine lot, !
and Hoover could see that the Union j
had done a lot to help them. We are
sorry Mr. Hoover cannot be with us
tonight, but he is busy in a good wo.rk
which keeps him in the East.
"I spoke to the boys at Glasgow
University recently. They told me
that they believed that Herbert C.
Hoover was directing the biggest job
ever undertaken by one nation in be
half of another."
Dr. Jordan gave a brief recount of
the conditions in Belgium, and ex
pressed his great appreciation of the
fact that Stanford had already done
so much in the work of .relieving'this
condition, in sending between five and
six thousand dollars to the sufferers.
It was learned afterwards that $1200
has just been sent to San Francisco to '
add to the Belgian fund. With the
goods sent on the Camino, and the
funds raised in the first contributibn,
this makes $5000 already raised at
Stanford. Pledges of $500 a month in
the fifty-cent campaign, which are due
for two more months, will raise this
amount to $GOOO.
Following the opening a cable mes- i
sage of greeting was sent to Mr.
Hoover in London, telling him of the
event.
After Dr. Jordan's talk, Messrs.
Field and Baker responded to calls
from the audience and sang a song
of Stanford composed by Carolus Ag
er. W. C. Bacon, '14, leading man in
"At the Dragon's Eye," the Junior
Opera, then entertained with a bari
tone solo, singing in his rich baritone
voice "Still wie die Nacht." As an
encore he sang "The Little Gray Home
in the West." C. W. Timmins, '16, ac
companied him.
Vanderlynn Stow, Business Manager
of the University, when asked to speak,
told of the conditions at Harvard
while he attended that institution, of
the entire lack of sympathy between
the students and Facility, a condition
which President Lowell is now trying
to get away from, in order to bring a
feeling of co-operation between the
three elements of Harvard life. He
then said: "I have tried to do my
part to bring about such a feeling at
Stanford, and I think I see it coming
with this building as the evidence. The
thing which Chancellor Jordan start
ed, and President Branner carried on,
the Trustees want to help complete by
their co-operation.
Dr. Branner expressed his pleasure
and that of the Faculty in seeing the
Stanford Union completed, and told of
their wish to co-operate to make it a
success. Later he gave a practical
example of the desire to co-operate, by
offering to buy six life memberships
in the Union. In answer to the ques
tions which have been asked concern
ing his intention of resigning as presi
dent, Dr. Branner reaffirmed the
statement that he would resign, illus
trating his avowed intention with a
humorous story of his boyhood.
After a violin solo by D. E. Shepard
son, '17, Ralph Arnold, '99, the newly
elected member of the Board of Trus
tees, was asked to speak. He ex
pressed his appreciation of the honor
that had just been bestowed upon
him, the second alumnus to be elected
to the Board, and said: "My one am
bition in my new position, will be to
infuse Stanford spirit into the Board of
Trustees of the University, and do all
in my power to have the board act al
ways for the best interests of the
University."
Then, in turn, the other trustees
were called upon, and in a few words
William Mayo Newhall, Timothy Hop
kins, and Joseph D. Grant, in the hap
py, but withal sincere spirit of the
evening, told of their pleasure in see
ing the Union completed, and their de
sire fo,r closer co-operation between
the students and the Hoard.
Assistant Professor E. P. Lesley fol
lowed, giving in clever dialect some of
the old negro folk-stories written by
President Branner. Then came more
musical stunts, given by Bernard Las
key, '12. J. R. Morgan, '16, and the Glee
Club Quartet, who sang a medley. The
music struck home, and every enter
tainer was called back fo.r an encore.
Much credit goes to W. G. Paul, '15,
and J. R. Morgan, '16, who arranged
for the work of the local stunt men.
But the real credit for the success
goes to all Stanford men who attend
ed and co-operated with true Stanford
spirit.

ing class from the Pioneers of "ninety

their diplomas last May, were present

had made the opening possible at this
Stanford Union was opened Saturday
evening in a maze of wit and laughter,
in which the students and alumni,
Faculty and Trustees joined with
equal share and pleasure. For the
first time since the inauguration or
President Bran*" ••, the four elements
of the quae' angle of Stanford life
came together in large numbers, and
never before in the history of the Uni
versity have they come together with
the same amount of true Stanford
Spirit thiit was displayed on Saturday
night.
Charles K. Field, '95, genial master
of ceremonies, announced early in the
evening that the opening must be
a typical Stanford Union event.
Though no one could know before
hand what a typical Stanford Union
evening would be like, every one felt
when it was all over that he had ex
perienced one. Tradition was made for
the new building, through the delight
ful informality, as tradition was made
for the University by the Pioneers
when the Quadrangle was new.
In clever speech and ready repartee,
in joke and song, all four of the ele
ments mingled, to a degree that even
the men who conceived the idea of the
Union where all Stanford men might
join together, could not have desired
more. The Board of Trustees was rep
resented by five of its members —
Trustees Newhall, Stow. Hopkins,
Grant, and Arnold, nil of whom spoke
during the evening; many members of
the Faculty were in the crowd, and
they were represented on the informal
program by Professor Charles David
.Marx, who presided, Chancellor Jor
dan, President Branner, and Assistant
Professor E. P. Lesley. For the alum
ni Charles K. Field, '95, Shirley Bak
er. '95, and Bernard Laskey, '12, en
tertained, and woe to the man who
tried to engage Field, as master of
ceremonies, in repartee. With it all
were the stunts by many students. The
affair was all a gay riot of song and
laughter, in which all joined alike as
Stanford men.
While the Stanford band played in
the evening, plenty of time was given
to inspect the new building. The first
floor, with its rooms for offices and
concessions, the main floor with its
large spring floor ball room, and its
annex, the library and committee
rooms, and finally the apartments on

the third floor, were in turn admired
by the throng to whom Stanford Union
had so long been only a great white
exterior.
Reception Held for Women.
The inspection of the men was sup
planted yesterday afternoon by the
visit of the women of the University
at the reception given for them.
Though the heavy rain which lasted
all day prevented a large attendance,
a number of people were present in
the afternoon, and others came in
during the reception and viewed the
new building.
The furniture of the old Stanford
residence, loaned to the Union by the
University, was seen in many of the
rooms. The library is almost entirely
furnished with it. The bookcases, the
table, and the chairs placed there were
the personal property of the Found
ers. In speaking of these relics,
Charles K. Field, editor of Sunset Mag
azine. said: "In the library is the
table at which I have eaten with the
Founders, and around which you might
have sat with them if they had lived,
for it was their wish to come in per
sonal touch with all of their stu
dents."
