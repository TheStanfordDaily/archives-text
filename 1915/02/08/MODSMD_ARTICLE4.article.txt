Twenty-one Johnsons are regis
tered in the new "bawl-out," which was
placed nn sale at the Business Office.
Eight of them insert a "t" in their
names, though, while one member of
the house adds an "e" to the end of
the cognomen.
The Smiths run a close second with
nineteen representatives, while the

Hi; tlie Woods are 13, tieing with the

but six.

G.reens, but one more is Greening. Five
Whites exist to three Grays plus one
Grau, seven Browns, and two Blacks.
There are seven Fishers, but no Fish,
five Lockes, one ofâ€”wood, but no
doors or gates, five Kings and natural
ly five Queens, five Prices, but only
one Worth. There is one Workman
for one Job. Two Swans grace the
lists, one an American and the other
from China. The hardest name to pro
nounce is Zvenigorodsky.
The total registration this semester,
according to the "bawl-out," is 1841,
fifty-seven less than last semester.
However, enough students dropped out
at the end of last semester and enough
new ones entered the beginning of this
term to make the total for the year
2052.
Forty-nine states, four territories,
and thirteen foreign countries are rep
resented in the "bawl-out." Officers of
more than seventy campus organiza
tions are given in the new directory.
The new "bawl-out" is a regular
tattle-tale. It tells the address, middle
name, standing, home and major sub
ject, and even the telephone numbers
of practically every person in the
Stanford community. It has the
"dope" on all the Faculty, and exposes
every assistant in any department. It
names all the heads of departments
and University officers.
The "bawl-out" will be on sale at
the Business Office for several days
for fifteen cents per copy.
