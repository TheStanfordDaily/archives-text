# TERRIFIC STORM OF WIND AND RAIN DRENCHES CAMPUS
## 
### 
Forty-eight hours of wind and rain
fall have inflicted the greatest amount
of unwelcome weather that this re
gion has seen for years. The south
easter that reached a velocity of S. r »
miles per hour off Point Reyes yester
day, turning ferry boats into canoes,
dumping loaded freight cars into the
bay, and disturbing things generally
in the vicinity of San Francisco,
reached the campus in somewhat abat
ed form, but still managed to cut the
corners at an almost ijO-mile clip. The
breeze left little disaster in its wake,
aside from playing havoc with umbrel
las. window curtains, and lightweight
pedestrians.
Lagunita this afternoon resembled
"the troubled Tiber." Although the

flume has been closed for over
a week, the rains and uncon
trollable inlets have raised the levol
of the lake to within less than a foot of
the banks.
Crew practice was called off for to
day—the first time this season that
such a move was necessary. Track and
baseball activities have been laid
aside until weather conditions improve.
The total rainfall up to 2 o'clock
this afternoon was 17.27 incres. Dur
ing 1 lie past 30 hours, 2.0. r > inches have
fallen.
Over an inch of .rainfall has boen
recorded since 8 o'clock this morning.
The Southern Pacific reports that
its coast lines have not suffered, all
trains and mails bring on time.
