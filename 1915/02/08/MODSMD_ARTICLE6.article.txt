# STANFORD FACULTY FAILS TO SANCTION FRESHMAN CONTEST
## Intercollegiate Relations Again Broken Off by Abrogation of Tentative Agreement CONFERENCE ON SATURDAY 
### 
The failure ol' the committee appointed
by Presidents Wheeler and Branner to
discuss the tentative agreement drawn
two weeks ago by the intercollegiate
committee, to arrive at any settle
ment of the differences of the two Uni
versities in the matter of restoring the
Freshman rugby game must result in
the abrogation of the tentative com
pact. Some new basis of settlement
will have to be found, for the Stanford
members of the Intercollegiate com
mittee have made it plain that the
agreement containing the rule elimin
ating Freshmen cannot be finally
adopted unless the Freshman game is
provided as a substitute. The agree
ment committee has the assurance of
the Stanford Faculty delegation that
the Freshman game will never be re
stored.
Neither of the Faculty committees
had instructions at the conference
Saturday afternoon, which was held at
the Bohemian Club, and their functions
were wholly of an advisory nature.
The discussion centered on the ques
tion of the Freshman game, though
the committees were appointed to con
sider the intercollegiate generally. The
Stanford members advised California
that there was no probability of re
scinding the Faculty ruling .regarding
the game, since no action has been
taken by the Academic Council, and
the feeling of the Faculty is as strong
on the point as when the ruling was
adopted. A lengthy discussion followed,
in which the history of the Freshman
I game was reviewed, but no conclusion
satisfactory to the wishes of the ad
vocates of the tentative agreement
could be reached, in view of the atti
tude of the whole Stanford Faculty.
The Freshman exclusion rule was
also discussed, but the point received
less attention since the Stanford dele
gation felt that there was no need of
discussing the rule, in view of the
heavy student vote against it here.
The delegates at the conference were
Dean David P. Barrows, Dean T. M.
Putnam, and Professor M. C. Lynch,
of California, and Professors F. Angell,
E. D. Adams, and A. T. Murray, for
Stanford.
Dr. Angell characterizes the attitude
of the California committee as being
very fair-minded and courteous, and
states that the delegates were very
desirous of preventing a breach of
relations.
