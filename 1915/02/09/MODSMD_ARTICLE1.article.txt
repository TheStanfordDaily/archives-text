### 
"A Dollar a Door-Bell" is the slogan
of the Associated Charities of San

ing this money is to he entrusted t.)
the students ot' Stan ovd and Califor

the city. To the student collecting
the greatest number of dollars, the
Associated Charities will give a free
trip to Honolulu; another trip to the
same place will be given to the per
son, regardless of whether he is a
student or not, who collects the most
money.
The slogan explains the plan for the
work. Each year the Associated Char
ities use .$lOO,OOO, and it is the idea
of the members of that organization
that the donations should be more
evenly distributed throughout the city
than has been the case heretofore. Al

pressed themselves as willing to con
tribute larger sums, but the central
organization plans to gain the neces
sary money in small amounts from a
more representative number of givers.
San Francisco, where all of the so
liciting will be done, will be divided
into districts, which will be allotted
to individual solicitors. All of the so
liciting vvo.rk will be done on one
day, Saturday. On Thursday, there will
be left at each door a copy of Mayor
Rolph's proclamation telling of the
plan of the campaign. This is to make
the solicitors' work easier.
The proceeds of the baseball gam.-
between Stanford and the Olympic
Club, to be played in San Francisco
on Saturday afternoon, will also go to
the Associated Charities.
The leaders at California have al
ready agreed to help, and last night
the proposition was laid before the
associated students of that University.
On Thursday night those who wish
to take np the work from Stanford
will be met in the Union building at
eight o'clock by a representative of

plain the plan and the manner ->112

furnish their own expenses do so.
The plan was putin motion Sunday
night, when W. B. l'ringle and O. K.
Cashing, San Francisco lawyers, an 1
members of the Associated Charities,
conferred with those interested • t
Stanford.
To .1. F. Lanagan, '00, former Stan
ford football coach, belongs the credit
of originating the idea of including
college men in the work.
"A Dollar a Door-Bell" is the slogan
of the Associated Charities of San
Francisco for raising money with
which to carry on their work for i'ie
following year. The work of obtai. -
ing this money is to he entrusted t.)
the students ot' Stan ovd and Califor
nia, and to the proi - ional men 'if
the city. To the student collecting
the greatest number of dollars, the
Associated Charities will give a free
trip to Honolulu; another trip to the
same place will be given to the per
son, regardless of whether he is a
student or not, who collects the most
money.
The slogan explains the plan for the
work. Each year the Associated Char
ities use .$lOO,OOO, and it is the idea
of the members of that organization
that the donations should be more
evenly distributed throughout the city
than has been the case heretofore. Al
ready many individuals have ex
pressed themselves as willing to con
tribute larger sums, but the central
organization plans to gain the neces
sary money in small amounts from a
more representative number of givers.
San Francisco, where all of the so
liciting will be done, will be divided
into districts, which will be allotted
to individual solicitors. All of the so
liciting vvo.rk will be done on one
day, Saturday. On Thursday, there will
be left at each door a copy of Mayor
Rolph's proclamation telling of the
plan of the campaign. This is to make
the solicitors' work easier.
The proceeds of the baseball gam.-
between Stanford and the Olympic
Club, to be played in San Francisco
on Saturday afternoon, will also go to
the Associated Charities.
The leaders at California have al
ready agreed to help, and last night
the proposition was laid before the
associated students of that University.
On Thursday night those who wish
to take np the work from Stanford
will be met in the Union building at
eight o'clock by a representative of
the Associated Charities, who will ex
plain the plan and the manner ->112
work.
The Daily Palo Alto has been asked
to secure all the men possible and to
take charge of the work from this
end. All those desiring to aid are re
quested to hand in their names before
Thursday, if possible, in order to fa
cilitate the assignment of territory,
and to avail themselves of the instruc
tion to be given out Thursday night.
Those who wish to work but are
"broke" will lie furnished expenses,
but it is desired that those who can
furnish their own expenses do so.
