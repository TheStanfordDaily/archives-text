# STUDENT CONTROL IS MASS MEETING THEME
## FUNCTIONS OF STUDENT BODY ORGANS WILL BE EXPLAINED AT ENCINA UNDERCLASSMEN WILL BENEFIT PART OF PLAN TO IMPROVE SELF-GOVERNMENT AT STANFORD. 
### 
Student control at Stanford will be
expounded in all its details at a mass
meeting which will be held on next
Thursday evening at Encina Hall.
The gathering is being arranged for
by the different organs of student
government.
Through co-operation with the fra
ternities and clubs 011 the campus, ef
forts will be made to have all the
underclassmen in the University at
tend the mass meeting, and all the
upper classmen will be urged to be
present also.
The members of these organizations
have found that there is a widespread
ignorance on the campus of the basic
principles of student government, and
that much of the violation of the rul
ings occur 011 account of this ignor
ance. Many men on the campus do
not know the difference of the Exec
utive Committee, the University Con
ference and the Student Council in
their functions, or the distinction in
the duties of the president of the As
sociated Students, the president of the
Conference, and the Student Adviser.
These differences will be explained,
and the terms and meaning of the ex
isting ruling will be expounded, in
order to put them clearly before the
Student Body, and clear up the pres
ent ignorance. During the evening
the present status of student self
govcrnment and the relation of Fac
ulty to student control will be stated.
The leaders of the student govern
ment give assurance that the mass
meeting is not being called because
of any crisis existing at this time.
Ever since control of their affairs
was turned over to the students, this
ignorance of the organs of control,
their functions and rulings, has been
general, and it is believed that if it
is removed student, government will
be more efficient.
The meeting will be more like the
assemblies held at the beginning of
each college year, when an explana
tion is given of student government
in general, than any of the former
gatherings. Out the talks on Thurs
day evening will go more into detail
and cover specific points that have
never been publicly explained. The
discussion will be very informal and
ample opportunity given fo.r asking
questions, which is not possible at the
University assemblies.
Arrangements are being made by
Student Adviser S. S. Simonson, '15,
and O. H. Castle, '14, president of the
University Conference, and chairman
of the Student Council. There will be
four short speeches, and the meeting,
which will begin promptly at 7:30
o'clock, will be over by 8:15.
Members of the University Confer
ence will be present to mingle in the
crowd and answer questions asked
them. The regular Conference meet
ing will be hold immediately after the
mass meeting.

of the Student Council. There will be
four short speeches, and the meeting,
which will begin promptly at 7:30
o'clock, will be over by 8:15.
Members of the University Confer
ence will be present to mingle in the
crowd and answer questions asked
them. The regular Conference meet
ing will be hold immediately after the
mass meeting.
Student control at Stanford will be
expounded in all its details at a mass
meeting which will be held on next
Thursday evening at Encina Hall.
The gathering is being arranged for
by the different organs of student
government.
Through co-operation with the fra
ternities and clubs 011 the campus, ef
forts will be made to have all the
underclassmen in the University at
tend the mass meeting, and all the
upper classmen will be urged to be
present also.
The members of these organizations
have found that there is a widespread
ignorance on the campus of the basic
principles of student government, and
that much of the violation of the rul
ings occur 011 account of this ignor
ance. Many men on the campus do
not know the difference of the Exec
utive Committee, the University Con
ference and the Student Council in
their functions, or the distinction in
the duties of the president of the As
sociated Students, the president of the
Conference, and the Student Adviser.
These differences will be explained,
and the terms and meaning of the ex
isting ruling will be expounded, in
order to put them clearly before the
Student Body, and clear up the pres
ent ignorance. During the evening
the present status of student self
govcrnment and the relation of Fac
ulty to student control will be stated.
The leaders of the student govern
ment give assurance that the mass
meeting is not being called because
of any crisis existing at this time.
Ever since control of their affairs
was turned over to the students, this
ignorance of the organs of control,
their functions and rulings, has been
general, and it is believed that if it
is removed student, government will
be more efficient.
The meeting will be more like the
assemblies held at the beginning of
each college year, when an explana
tion is given of student government
in general, than any of the former
gatherings. Out the talks on Thurs
day evening will go more into detail
and cover specific points that have
never been publicly explained. The
discussion will be very informal and
ample opportunity given fo.r asking
questions, which is not possible at the
University assemblies.
Arrangements are being made by
Student Adviser S. S. Simonson, '15,
and O. H. Castle, '14, president of the
University Conference, and chairman
of the Student Council. There will be
four short speeches, and the meeting,
which will begin promptly at 7:30
o'clock, will be over by 8:15.
Members of the University Confer
ence will be present to mingle in the
crowd and answer questions asked
them. The regular Conference meet
ing will be hold immediately after the
