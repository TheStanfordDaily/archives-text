There is not a man in the Universi
ty who would not appreciate a trip to
Honolulu, if he was presented with a
ticket and all expenses paid. Also
there are many men who would be wil
ling to give over their time for a day
to assist in the most profitable kind of
charity work. The man who turns out
to be the most successful worker will
be given a trip to Honolulu, with all
expenses paid.
The Associated Charities in San
Francisco must raise $100,000 in order
to carry on their work during the com
ing year. Part of this amount has
been already pledged through large
subscriptions. On Saturday they plan
"a dollar a door-bell campaign" with
in the city of San Francisco, in order
to reach the required amount. The idea
is to give every one in the city an op
portunity to contribute toward this
worthy cause.
You want to know what you can do
to help out. No, not contribute money,
although the association would prob
ably not turn the money down. The
charity workers in the city want you
to give your time next Saturday to as
sisting in this campaign in San Fran
cisco.
The Daily Palo Alto has been asked
to secure workers on the campus who
will be willing to devote their ener
gies on Saturday to help raise the nec
essary $100,000. An appeal has been
made to both California and Stanford,
and the medical schools of the respec
tive universities located in San Fran
cisco. A trip to Honolulu has been of
fered to the college man who secures
the largest number of subscriptions on
Saturday for the Associated Charities.
It is not worth while for any one to
assist in this work unless the worthi
ness of the cause is paramount in one's
mind. This is an opportunity to break
away from selfish inclinations, and do
something for the other fellow. The
trip to Honolulu is incidental, and
should not be taken into consideration
in determining whether you can spare
the time to put into this work on Sat
urday. Ho it for the good of the cause.
If you can possibly spare the time
leave your name at the office of The
