# NOTED RED SOX FIELDER TALKS ON BIG LEAGUES
## DUFFY LEWIS PREDICTS CLOSE RUN FOR PENNANT. Says Philadelphia Athletics Will Be Unable Take First Place Among American Clubs. 
### 
Duffy Lewis, for four years star fly
chaser for the Boston Kcd Sox, which,
after winning the American League
pennant in 1912, annexed the world's
championship, gives out some inter
esting information to local diamond
enthusiasts, in an interview to The
Daily Palo Alto, as to the probable
outcome of the.races in the major
leagues during the coming season.
Lewis is well-known to Stanford, be
ing a member of Ireland's famous In
dependents. He will return East
March 1 to commence spring training.
"There are surely going to be some
surprises sprung this year in base
ball. It looks to me like this ought
to be a very successful season, from a
financial point of view, for all club
owners.
"Philadelphia can't repeat this year
in the American League. With Plank,
Bender, and Coombs the backbone to
their pitching staff, gone, and Eddie
Collins, the brainiest second baseman
in the game today, exchanged to the
White Sox, Connie Mack, for once in
his life, will be forced to take a back
seat. Should Boston manage to get
away with a good start, we'll never be
headed in that dash for the bunting.
Last season we ran into all kinds of
snags. First, a poor start hit us, an.l
then 'Smoky .Toe' was laid on the
shelf with a bad arm. This boy, Dutch
Leonard, who pitched here Saturday,
is a wonder, and, with Wood in form,
our twirling staff will be in excellent
shape. The Chicago White Sox appear
to have an edge on second place. They
have the best pitching staff of any
team in the country, and, with Collins
to round out the infield, and do a lit
tle hitting, they are bound to land
near the top. Washington ought to be
a close third, and the Athletics should
finish last of the first division clubs.
"The final line-up in the National
League is also going to see some
changes from that of last year. Boston
experienced something quite unusual
in coming to the top with a rush, as
she did. It looks as if New York, if
nothing unforseen happens, will land
the pennant in her accustomed stylo.
The Giants didn't show their real
form last season. Marquard may be
depended upon to win a large number
of games this season, and with Lo
bert, the third baseman McGraw ac
quired from the Phillies, you may ex
pect to see New York finish first. The
Boston Braves and the Cubs will have
to fight it out for second honors.
"Who do I think is the best manag
er in the big leagues today? Why,
Bill Carrlgan, of the Red Sox. Watch
him walk away with the pennant in
his pocket this year, if some of our
stars don't break a leg."
