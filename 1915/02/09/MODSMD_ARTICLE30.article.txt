# ROTH HAS FASTED FIFTY-FOUR DAYS
## Tests Show His Blood to Be Pure But He Will Not Eat Until Natural Hunger Returns. 
### 
Fifty-four days have now passed
since R. C. Roth, of Palo Alto began
his extended fast, and, though the
plucky tailor is now so weak that he is
confined to his l ed most of the time, ho
still continues his starvation cure,
with an unyielding determination to
stick it out until natural hunger re
turns. However, the confidence with
which Roth anticipates a successful
termination of his fast has been dis
placed by alarm among those who are
watching his case, and the unanimous
advice now given to Roth is to oat.
Bacteriological and chemical tests ->112

per cent pure, and that it contains
about fifty per cent more blood cor
puscles than the blood of the average
person in normal health. His temper
ature and pulse are normal, but his
circulation is poo.r. He continues to
lose in weight.
Roth's fast has now lasted long
enough to make it one of the most re
markable yet observed, but the record
is held by a man who went without
nourishment for ninety-one days, and
then terminated the fast successfully.
