# NEW PENNANT IS GOOD OMEN
## Will Wave Over Campus on Days of Games. 
### 
Stanford's huge new Cardinal pen
nant. was initiated to the campus
breeze Saturday afternoon, and its first
fluttering was signalized by a hard
and well-earned victory in athletics.
This is taken as a good omen by
campus fans, who will henceforth see
the banner waving from the high flag
pole on days of athletic events, either
here or in the enemy's territory.
The big banner is the gift of the
Board of Trustees to the Student
Body. On a recent visit to the campus
members of the Board noticed the lack
of a Stanford banner for athletic cele
brations. The cardinal and white flag
was soon ordered. Saturday was the
first day of a game since the new pen
nant arrived on the campus.
