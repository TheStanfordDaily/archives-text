# PROFESSOR ADAMS TO LECTURE
## 
### 
Professor E. D. Adams will give
a lantern slide lecture this evening at
8:00 o'clock in room -14, History
building, on "British Newspaper Opin
ion on the American Civil War." The
lecture is given primarily for the ben
efit of Professor Adams' class in I'nit
ed States history, but all interested
are invited to attend.
The slides shown will be from Lon
don Punch. Nearly all of the cartoons
thrown on the screen are from the pen
of Sir John Tenniel. the most famous
political cartoonist, perhaps, of all
time. Tenniel's cartoons show what
England thought of the Civil War in
America, of England's asserted neu
trality in that war. of the effect of the
blockade, and depict pretty closely
where England's sympathy lay in the
Civil War.
