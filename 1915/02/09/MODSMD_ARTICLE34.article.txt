# LIBRARY FALLS HEIR TO NEWS CLIPPINGS
## Collection Covers History of Mexico During the Latter Part of the Nineteenth Century. 
### 
The University Library has recent
ly fallen heir to an unusual collection
of books, pamphlets, and newspaper
clippings, gathered by the late Ed
ward Lee Plumb, who died in Wash
ington two years ago, at the age of
So years. .Mr. Plumb came to Califor
nia in the early days of 1849-50, but
from here went to Mexico, where much
of his life was spent. He was secre
tary of legation and charge d'affaires
there for the United States in ISO 7,
and later was consul-general at Ha
vana. In the eighties he was vice
president of the Mexican Internation
al .railroad.
The collection includes more than
2000 books and pamphlets, and much
of it relates to affairs in Mexico dur
ing the latter half of the nineteenth
century. The unusual part, however,
is the vast collection of newspaper
clippings. These begin with a vol
ume of Mexican affairs in 1857, and
extend almost without interruption
through the next 55 years. Fifteen
trunks, which these clippings now
completely fill, stand as .monuments
of Mr. Plumb's industry with the
shears. In subject matter the clip
pings cover a wide .range, although
national and international affairs
seem to have received the greatest at
tention. The collection has come to
the library through the generosity of
Mrs. Ida Husted Harper, of Washing
ton, IX C., whose daughter, Winifred
Harper, now Mrs. G. E. Cooley, grad
uated from Stanford in IS9G.
