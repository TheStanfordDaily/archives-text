# CREW TRIPS TO REDWOOD STARTED LAST SATURDAY
## 
### 
The crew season at Redwood start
ed on Saturday afternoon, when part
of the squad was taken up to the bay
for the first time this year. Three
boat loads, including sixteen varsity
and eight. Freshman oarsmen made
the trip. No Freshmen coxswains were
taken up, two lightweights of the var
sity squad and Coach Guerena steer
ing the boats.
The new float which was brought
down from San Francisco has been
putin place by Sam McDonald. The
absence of the float has been the only
barrier to working out on the bay, so
for the rest of the season a squad of
men will board the 3:01 each day and
take the Redwood trip.
