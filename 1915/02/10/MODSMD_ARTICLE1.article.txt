tistic stage effects. Approximately
150 people will take part in the pro
duction as Robin Hood's foresters,
Prince John's retainers, fairies, serfs,
maskers, the sheriff of Nottingham's
merry men, townspeople, abbots, nuns,
soldiers, and courtiers.
Alfred Xoyes, the author of "Sher
wood," was given important consid
eration in th2 latest appointment to
the position of Poet-Laureate of Eng
land. He served with the British
forces in Belgium until the first of
last month, and is acting as exchange
professor of Literature at Princeton
University during the present semes
ter.
Professor Lee Emerson Bassett, of
the English department, will direct
the production of "Sherwood." Pro
fessor Bassett's experience as direc
tor-general of the Stanford presenta
tions of "The Knight of the Burning
Pestle" and The Miracle Plays of 1.908
augurs well for the artistic success of
the present undertaking.
A perfectly natural stage has been
selected in the grounds of the old
Stanford residence, which will lend
itself readily to transformation into
the mystic beauty of Sherwood forest.
A seating capacity for two thousand
people is available.
Fairy dances and choruses will be
introduced in the drama, and special
music will add to the charm and beau
ty of the production. The costuming
will lie elaborate, artistic, and faithful
to the play and period.
Twenty-two speaking parts are re
quired in "Sherwood." Among the in
teresting and attractive historical
characters to be introduced in the
play are Robin Hood, Prince John,
Friar Tuck, Uttle John, Much, Lord
Fitzwalter, Richard Coeur-de-Lion,
Will Scarlet. Shadow-of-a-Leaf, \lan
a-Dale, Oberon, Queen Elinor. Maid
Marian, and Titania. Rehearsals will
begin as soon as the complete cast is
selected by English Club.
