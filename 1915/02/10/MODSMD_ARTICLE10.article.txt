# SUMMER LAW SCHOOL IS NOW POSSIBILITY FOR STUDENTS
## 
### 
Announcement lias been made by
the Faculty of the Law department
that a summer law school may possi
bly be held during the coming vaca
tion. Nothing definite has been de
cided, but if a sufficient number of
siudents indicate their intention to
tike advantage of the opportunity for
summer study, Ihe Hoard of Trustees
will be asked to sanction the hold
ing of the session.
If the summer school is held it will
probably open about June 21 and con
tinue for six weeks, closing about July
A tentative list of courses has
been suggested, as follows: Public
Service Corporations, 2 nnits. Profes
sor Cathcart; Damages, 2 units, Pro
fessor C'athcart; Administrative Law,
2 units. Professor Huston; Insurance,
units, Professor Huston; Equity, 2
nnits. Professor Kirkwood; Admiralty,
units, Professor Kirkwood.
In order to cover a two-unit course
in six weeks it will be necessary to
'mid about five lecture periods each
week. This means that a program of
1" hours each week for six weeks will

yield six units of credit. All of the
courses, except the Admiralty and
Damages, will be open to students hav
ing 50 units of credit in the University.
Attention is particularly called to the
fact that work will be open to upper
classmen in other departments. The
tuition fee will be $2.". regardless of
the amount o!' work take n.
i bis is not the first time a summer
law school lias been proposed at Stan
ford. a summer session having been
held in 1911, and, while successful in
every other way, the attendance was
not large enough to justify a repetition
of the experiment the following year.
The law school is now considerably
larger, however, and there has been an
increasing demand for summer work.
It is estimated that last year at least
20 law students took summer work at
other institutions. It is important th*it
the law Faculty be able to estimate
within the next few days the number
of students who are likely to register
in case the summer session is held.
The students who are interested are
requested, therefore, to se<Â» Professor
Woodward before the r'ld of the week.
