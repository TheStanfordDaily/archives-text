# GYM CLUB TRY-OUTS ARE SLATED FOR THURSDAY
## 
### 
Regular gym try-outs will be held
Thursday evening at eight o'clock in
Encina Gymnasium. Competition this
year will differ t'roni previous contests
inasmuch as special stress will be laid
upon the natural ability of the gymnast
and his aptness to learn, instead of se
lecting him primarily for his dexterity
in performing a fixed set of stunts.
The exercises which will form the
basis of competition will not be given
out until just prior to the try-outs.
