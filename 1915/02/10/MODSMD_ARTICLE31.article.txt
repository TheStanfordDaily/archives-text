# CHINESE ALUMNUS WRITES OF WORK TO ALMA MATER
## Graduate Engineer Recounts Difficulties of Railroad Building in Heart of China. 
### 
A letter from H. S. Chuck, '11, one
of the two Chinese graduates of the
Civil Engineering department, was
recently received by Professor C. D.
Marx. Chuck is now carrying on en
gineering work on the Yangtze river
far in the interior of China. The sur
vey he is making is for the prospec
tive .railroad which is to be the out
let for the rich, thickly settled farm
ing country of the interior.
According to the Chinese engineer,
many natural difficulties will make
the construction of the road slow and
very expensive. The soft soil becomes
deeply gorged and washed by the
mountain streams, so that a great
many large bridges are necessary. An
other expensive piece of the construc
tion will bo a three-mile tunnel. Chuck
says that 011 account of the financial
stringency, brought about by the
"World War" he fears that the actual
work of building cannot commence for
some time. As he expresses it."the
development of hidden treasure will
be longer delayed."
