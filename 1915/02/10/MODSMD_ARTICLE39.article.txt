# INDOOR SPORTS TO BE CONTESTED ON MARCH 16
## Boxing, Fencing, and Wrestling Championships to Be Decided in Snappy Two-Minute Rounds. 
### 
Stanford wrestlers, l)oxers. and
fencers, will take to the mats, gloves,
and foils on Tuesday evening, March
16, to contest for the championships
of the University for the present year.
Boxing and wrestling matches will be
held in the light, welter, middle, and
heavyweight divisions. No restric
tions a.re to be placed on the entries
in any way, the lists being open to
all. Preliminaries in each event are
to be held the evening previous to the
finals.
Medals will be struck for the win
ners in each boxing and wrestling
weight, and for the one who succeeds
in handling the steel to best advan
tage. In order to make the evening
as interesting as possible, from the
spectator's point of view, and not to
interfere with scholastic duties, the
rounds will be run off in rapid order.
Two-minute bouts and two minutes of
rest will enable two pairs of contes
tants to alternate in the .ring until the
referee's decision puts an end to the
struggle at the end of four rounds,
which will be the limit of length, ex
cept in the case of a draw. All events
will be governed by amateur boxing
rules.
H. W. Maloney urges probable par
ticipants to sign up as soon as pos
sible on the entry lists, which are now
posted in the gym.
