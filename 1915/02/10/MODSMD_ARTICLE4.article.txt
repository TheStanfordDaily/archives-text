# DOLLAR-DAY BANNER ATTRACTING RECRUITS
## Plan to Be Presented to Stanford Men in Union Building Thursday Evening 
### 
Fifty thousand dollars lias been set
as the goal to he achieved in the "Dol
lar Day" campaign to take place Sat
urday. February 13, St. Valentine's
Eve.
Stanford students in the Medical de
partment at Lane Hospital were ad
dressed Monday morning, and, as a
result, several score of them have
lined up.
Graduate Manager R. W. Wilcox,
'13, and Manager Frase.r. of the Olym
pics, have agreed to donate the pro
ceeds of the Stanford-Olympic base
ball game to the cause, which will be
held at Recreation Park at 2:30 Sat
urday afternoon.
Many students at Berkeley have
agreed to help in the campaign. To
create rivalry between the two Univer
sities iu a new outdoor sport, not yet
recognized by intercollegiate rules, i.
e., soliciting, a prize has been hung
up by the Associated Charities, through
individual subscription of the members
in charge. The student of either Uni
versity. who brings in the largest num
ber of dollar donations will lie award
ed a free trip to Honolulu 011 a Mat
son Navigation Company liner.
The campaign, as outlined by the
committee, is to be in the nature of a
house-to-house canvass. "A dollar a
door-bell" is the slogan of the resi
dential workers, who will be assigned
a square block in which they will be
expected to ring the door-bell of every
house and ask for a "Dollar Valentine
for the Poor."
The door-bell ringers will be equip-
I ped with appropriately designed cer
tificates or "Valentine Receipts,"
which they will hand each donor of a
dollar. One certificate will be liand-
I i'd over for each dollar received.
About a thousand Sa:i Francisco wo
nen have already registered as volun
teer door-bell ringers, and from Stan
ford and the State University the As
sociated Charities are hoping for a
like number of volunteers to register.
The volunteers will get their in
structions and be equipped with the
"Valentine Receipts" at the "Dollar
j Day" headquarters, o-S Post street.
San Francisco.
The Associated Charities has been
hard pressed for funds on account of
the terrible increase for aid which it
has met during the past year. It now
I is facing a deficit, and unless a large
I sum is raised, there will be hundreds
of applicants at its doors during the
present year who will have to go
away empty-handed.
Unlike a business concern, the Asso
ciated Charities is unable to dimin
ish its output on account of lack of
income. Where there is need, there il3
work is outlined; and this work must
go on.
Conditions in San Francisco have
been worse during the year just fin
ished than in many preceding. The
charities organization has been hit by
the double catastrophe of increased
work and diminished income. The
Belgian and other war relief funds
have taken money, which, under more
normal conditions, would have gone to
the Associated Charities. The grand
result has been a deficit, and the way
out was seen only through such a
popular campaign as will take place
Saturday.
