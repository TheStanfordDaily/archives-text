# E.D. ADAMS LECTURES ON CARTOONS OF CIVIL WAR
## PUNCH CARICATURES REFLECT BRITISH SENTIMENT. Political Attitude Toward North and South Is Portrayed by Vivid Pictures. 
### 
The cartoons of Sir John Tenniel,
drawn for London Punch during the
time of the Civil War in America, were
the basis of Professor E. D. Adams'
lantern slide lecture given last ev
ening on "England's Attitude Toward
the Civil War." Tenniel was the
greatest political cartoonist of his
time, and the drawings shown picture
the true sentiment of the English gov
ernment toward the American crisis.
Professor Adams opened his talk by
explaining the relations which Eng
land bore to both the North and the
South. The South, acting on the as
sumption that "Cotton is King," be
lieved that England would join hands
with her in the conflict because of the
great industrial relations existing
between them. On the other hand, th
North believed that from a humani
tarian standpoint England would side
with her, on account of the part she
had played in the freeing of'slaves in
all parts of the world. The cartoons
emphasized this point by showing both
factions accosting Dame Britian with
these two arguments.
The attitude which Punch bore is
manifested by the many pictures of
Abraham Lincoln which it printed.
At first no particular character was
assigned Lincoln. He was not well
known at that time. As the war pro
gressed, however, his features were
depicted as weak, thfen crafty, despot
ic, and finally brutal. These succes
sively marked the change in the cur
rent opinion of the English people. In
contrast to this the representations of
Jefferson Davis were never so hope
lessly caricatured, and were not un
like our modern "Uncle Sam." Profes
sor Adams called the attention of the
audience to the resemblance of the be
spangled representative of America
and photographs of Jefferson Davis.
Both of tlie last cartoons were ex
ceedingly interesting. One showed a
gladiator, the South, in the coils of
the net of his opponent. The latter
has the advantage, and is about to end
the affair with a trident. The last rep
resented a Union and Confederate sol
dier shaking hands over the inevitable
julep.
