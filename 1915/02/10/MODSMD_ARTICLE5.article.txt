The question of letting out the
building for campus functions came up
before the Governing Board of the
rnion yesterday afternoon, and it was
decided to limit the use of the build
ing to affairs cf intorc t to the whole
University community. A special ex
• ption to this rule was made in the
cases of jolly-ups in which two or
more elas -is are participating. Though
'they arc limited in attendance to a
part of the Student Body, the interest
i:i them was believed to be sufficiently
universal to warrant the exception.
A house committee was appointed
by the Board yesterday consisting of
S. S. Simonson, '15, chairman, A. E.
Worthy, '15, and R. C. Maples, '15.
Working with the manager of the
building, to be appointed, their duties
will be of an advisory nature.
