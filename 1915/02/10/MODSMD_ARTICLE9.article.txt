# DR. JORDAN TO ADDRESS FOUNDERS' DAY THRONG
## University Chancellor Is Secured to Make Principal Speech at Commemorative Exercises SENATOR STANFORD THEME Senior Class Will Accompany the Flower Committee, in Laying of Floral Pieces at Mausoleum 
### 
Chancellor David Starr Jordan has
been secured to deliver the annual
Pounders' Day address in connection
with the public exercises which will
be held on the campus .March 9, 1915,
in commemoration of the birth of Sen
ator Leland Stanford. The custom of
.etting the day apart as a University
holiday for the purpose of paying tri
bute to the celebrated founder of this
educational community has been per
petuated since 1894, the year follow
ing the death of Senator Stanford,
and has taken its place as 'the most
important date on the college calen
dar.
Senator Stanford and the kindly in*
terest which he manifested in campuu
life and institutions will provide Dr.
Jordan with the theme of his ad
dress. The speaker's intimate knowl
edge of the problems which confronted
the policy-shapers of the University
in the early nineties make him worthy
of being called the source-book of
Stanford history. Campus-dwellers
and alumni treasure in their remem
brance the sympathetic eulogy of Mrs.
Stanford which President Jordan de
livered at the exercises held in 1909.
This forensic masterpiece has been
published as "The Story of a Good
\v"oman," and the Cnancellor's contri
bution to the program is expected to
take the place of a companion address
to the memory of her husband.
The choir, under the direction or
L. W. Eaton, the University organist,
and accompanied by the Stanford
Hand, will aid in presenting an effec
tive program with the rendition of
"The Heavens Are Telling." from May
den's "Creation." Additional musical
numbers from various organizations
are being arranged, but no announce
ment of them can be made at present.
It is the custom of the Senior class
to attend the exercises in a body, anil,
after the Assembly Hall program has
ended, to escort the Flower Commit
tee to the tomb of Senator Stanford.
At this one occasion of the year flor
al pieces are placed within the Mau
soleum at the founders' tomb, and this
duty is entrusted to the Flower Com
mittee of the graduating class. G.
Jacomini, '15, and Miss Elizabeth Taff,
'15, have been delegated to the office
this year.
Last year the procedure was con
cluded with a banquet, which was
held in the clubrooms of Encina Hall.
Trustees, Faculty members, alumni,
and undergraduates took part in a
happy, informal get-together, and dis
cussed the most important questions,
past and present, which have been
the topic of student thought and ar
gument during the last twenty-four
years. It is expected that a banquet
of similar nature will be planned for
the final event of the 1915 Founders'
Day.
