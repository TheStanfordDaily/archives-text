"The great thing about Tuxedo is
the fact that it gives full fragrance
and flavor together with extreme
mildness. I find Tuxedo not only
the height of pipe enjoyment but
a distinct benefit because it gives
just the proper degree of relaxa
tion. Tuxedo is undoubtedly an
exceptional tobacco."
"As Popular As The fr
Movies"—TUXEDO

palate craving, every longing for the one Perfect Pipe
and Cigarette tobacco. No matter when of how you
smoke T nxedo it sends right into your heart a glim
mer of Gladsome Sunshine. And you can just about
hear the honeybees buzz in the far-off gardens.
The Per fee I Tobacco for and Cigarette
Sings into your system a song of keen delight.
It spreads real happiness and cheer because it's smok
able, lovable, all day, all night— no matter 1 ow the
weather fits. I uxedo's flavor is so enticingly rn ild
and delicately fragrant it will not irritate the most
sensitive throat.
Simply the choicest mild leaves of grand old
Kentucky Burley—ripe, rich, fragrant and mellow —
made into delicious tobacco that smokes as smooth
as cream. That's Tuxedo.
