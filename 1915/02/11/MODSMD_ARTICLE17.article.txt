I To the Editor:
You.r recent editorial regretting the
proposed paving ot' the Inner Quad
seems so sincere that it makes me
like assuring you and other smilarly
apprehensive members ol' the Stanford
community that the great court paved
once more as it was originally will not
he the "eyesore" you fear. Until 11)03,
as you know, the Quad was paved with
asphalt. There were 110 crosswalks or
paths in it, and it was, as the Found
ers and the architects who designed
the whole scheme of the University
evidently intended, the heart of the
University—a gathering place and a
loitering place. In time the asphalt
broke and became very uneven, and
the expense of constant repairs was so
heavy that Mrs. Stanford spread peb
bles over it, in the belief, we are told,
that they would pack down and make
a smooth surface. At the same time
the two great cross-walks were put in.
The pebbles have not packed down,
and for several college generations the
"heart of the University" has been a
stony hea.vt, urging all who enter to
pass right through along the straight
and broad paths, rather than to linger.
Hut now that we have once more
i the shining glory of the Memorial
j Church in the great center court,
•where the red roofs rim the blue,"
(it is of the Inner Quad that the writer
of this line sings) it pleases many of
us that the Trustees are giving us
back a surface over which we may
wander as we will. and. if we choose,
easily reach the seats they have placed
in the pleasant gardens of palms, bam
| boo, and camphor trees. We shall
not get back the old asphalt, but if
the oiled macadam which will replace
it is, as we understand it will be, light,
absorbent, and Inconspicious, and if
the glaring white cross-walks are
taken out, as we hope they may be
some time, the Inner Quad will once
more be an attractive gathering place.
Your ideal of a grass court is cer
tainly beautiful —provided we could
all walk on the grass freely, and pro
vided it were not always wet—but any
made or beaten paths through it would
take away the sense of restfulness
which belongs there, and re-create the
present impression that the Quad is
but an open space and a passage way.
