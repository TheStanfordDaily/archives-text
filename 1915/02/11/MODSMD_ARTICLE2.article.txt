Roth, the Palo Alto tailor, who has
been fasting since December 17, ex
I pects to end his extended period of vol
untary starvation tomorrow. His
tongue is practically clear at last, and,
according to Roth, this and other
symptoms are signals from nature that
it is time to break his fast. Before
taking any nourishment he is going t

Though physically very weak, Roth
claims that his vitality is much higher
now than it was fifty-six days ago,
when he began the fast. "My strength,"
he said, "will return rapidly when I
begin to eat again. Every bit of food
will build tissue, muscle, and vitality,
and two days after I break my fast 1
will lie doing gymnastic stunts in the
yard. Bring some of your friends, and
I will do some weight lifting for you."
