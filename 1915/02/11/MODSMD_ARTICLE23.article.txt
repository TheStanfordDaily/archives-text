Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
I wish to say to those gentlemen and
ladies who composed the choir and
sang so beautifully on Dedication Day
that 1 cannot express all I felt on that,
to me. Holy Day, but 1 was very glad
you were so ready and willing to help
in making the service impressive an'l
memorable by your wonderful singing.
JANE L. STANFORD.
