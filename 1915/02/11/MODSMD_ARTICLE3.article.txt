### 
Centenary Sunday, February 14, the

out the United States to commemorate
one hundred years of peace with Great
Britain, will be recognized at Stanford
by appropriate ceremonies in the
Memorial Church in conjunction with
the regular morning service.

tion of the series he has been giving.
Dr. Gardner has invited the Chancellor
of the University, President Branner,
and Vice-President Stillman to be seat
ed in the chancel of the church. The
musical numbers that have been se
lected are Gounod's "Grant Us Thy
Peace," and the "Hallelujah Chorus,"
from Handel's "Messiah."
The treaty of Ghent between this
country and our former enemy was
ratified on February IT. 181 ">. The fact
that in the face of conflicting interests
and grave differences the two coun
tries have had a centeury of unbroken
peace, is believed a worthy cause for
commemoration. February 17, the date
set to remember the event in the
United States by means of special
meetings, addresses, and programs,
will not be observed at Stanford, the
activities here being confined to the
Sunday previous.
Plans for a national celebration of
the centenary have been under con
sideration for some time, but the in
tervention of the European war made
it advisable to omit every feature that
might seem inconsistent with the
United States' present policy of strict
neutrality. A dignified notice of the
treaty of Ghent is not in violation of
this policy. The purpose of the com
memoration is not to laud any nation
or nations, but to recognize the bles
sing of peace to this country, in the
first instance with Great Britain, but
also with other nations. Secondly, to
call attention to the gratifying effect
upon our national life and institutions
of the unfortified and undefended Ca
nadian frontier, and, thirdly, to re
new the confidence of otir people in
the pacific policy which lias governed
our international relations In the past.
The peace centenary was organized in
this country by the American commit
tee, the Pacific branch of which has
Dr. Jordan as chairman, and Profes
sor E. B. Krehbiel as secretary.
