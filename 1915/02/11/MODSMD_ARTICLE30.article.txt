# DR. ANGELL TELLS OF ATHLETIC PROBLEMS
## Intercollegiate Relations Expounded in Timely Contribution of Current Sequoia Issued Tomorrow. 
### 
A period of "innocuous desuetude"
is the prescription which Dr. Frank
Angell, of the Psychology department,
recommends for baseball and football
in his article on intercollegiate rela
tions appearing in the February Se
quoia. The number will be sold on
the Quad tomorrow. Dr. Angell ex- '
plains in ?». clear, concise way why the
two Universities cannot come to an
agreement. He shows, by describing
the varying conditions at the two ITni
ver.-itics, why the suggestions and ex
pedients proposed by one committee
are entirely incompatable with the in
structions received by the other.
The primary reasons for the intro
duction of the Freshman game and
the explanation of why it has become
a nuisance and outlived its uSeful
•
ness are discussed in the article. Dr.
Angell concludes by saying that al
though other sports have been con
ducted with a fair amount of sports
manship, he cannot say as much for
football and baseball within the past
three years.
"The Spirit's Guidance," by Miss
Mary Curry, '15; "The Lord's WorK,
a story by Geroid Robinson, '17, and
"The Pipe Hunter," by H. W. Frantz,
'17, form the bulk of the contribu- J
tions of fiction. Miss Curry gives a
glimpse into the life and character of
the chorus girl. "The Lord's Work"
is a story of unusual interest. The de
scription of the trials and struggles of
the mountain people, who are its char
acters, is exceptionally good. In"The
Pipe Hunter," Frantz takes as bis
leading character a particular type of
college parasite who exists only be
cause of the "pipe courses" which he
is able to include in his cir.riculum.
"Wine O' the West." the frontispiece
by Miss Dare Stark. '17, "A Sequence
of Vanished Portraits," by G. A.
Hughes, '17, and "A Sketch," by J.
W. Bennett, '15, are the principal fea
tures of verse.
