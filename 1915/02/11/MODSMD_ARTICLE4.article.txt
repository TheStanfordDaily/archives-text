### 
At a Mass Meeting in the Union
Building University Govern
ment Is to Be Explained.
Underclassmen Must Attend
TO STRIKE AT IGNORANCE
The big student control mass meet
ing will be called in the Stanford
Union at 7:30 this evening, and will
adjourn three-quarters of an hour
later. In the intervening time the
leaders of student government hope
to explain fully the different organi
zations of control and their functions,
in order to clear up the prevailing ig
norance on the subject on the campus.
'1 hey believe that most of the men vio
lating rulings of the Conference do so
because they do not know tnc mean
ing and purpose of these .rulings.
It was arranged today that prac
tically all underclassmen of tbe Uni
versity will be required to attend the
congress, through the organizations to
which they belong. Upperclassmen
are also invited to attend.
All the important rules of the Uni
versity Conference, which are enforced
by the Student Council, will be ex
plained. together with the part the
two bodies play in making and enforc
ing the .regulations. The functions of
the Student Adviser and the Executive
Committee, the relations of Faculty to
student control, and the present sta
tus of student control will also bo
commented upon.
All members of the Conference are
urged to be present this evening. The
bi-weekly meeting will be held imme
diately afterwards.
