The students of the University have
shown a greater interest in the Bonn
heim Contest this year than ever be
fore. Fourteen essays were submitted,
whereas in previous years there have
been barely enough to take the prizes
offered. The standard of the work
done was highly commended by the
judges. Great difficulty was experi
enced in choosing the winners, because
there was no great disparity in the
quality of the manuscripts submitted.
