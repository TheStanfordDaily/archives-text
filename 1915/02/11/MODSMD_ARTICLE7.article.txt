# CHARITIES SPEAKER TO OUTLINE DOLLAR PLAN
## WILL TALK IN UNION AFTER STUDENT MEETING. Men Are Invited to Remain to Give San Francisco Campaign a Hearing. 
### 
This evening, at eight-fifteen, in the
Union building, after the student eon
red meeting, the men who wish to
help the Associat?d Charities of San
Urar.chco next Saturday in their ' Dol
lar Day" campaign for funds to furth
er their work during the following
year, will be met by a representative
of that organization who will outline
the plan for collecting the dollar gifts
in the city.
He will not only tell how the work
will lie handled by the individual solic
itors, but will also show the need of
charity in a city the size and charac
ter of San Francisco. Ho will explain
the work of the association in meet
ing this need; will show how much
good is done by the efficiency gained
through organization where individual
or haphazard work would accomplish
less, or even do harm.
Because of the difficulty of obtain
ing solicitors with determination and
intelligence enough to do tbe work
which the Associated Charities finds
is absolutely necessary, if many people
are to be given tbe boost that will
help keep them from sinking into pov
erty, tbe organization has turned to
the college men of the Bay district for
help.
Numbers of Stanford men have al
ready left their names with The Daily
Palo Alto, but unless more men sign
up, there will be districts in the city
from which the dollars may not be col
lected. Tbe association points this
out as an opportunity for the men of
the campus to get. behind a dollar
gaining campaign for an organization
that will most effficiently use the dol
lars collected, and earnestly requests
that, those who feel they can give a
few hours of their time to this worthv
cause at least to drop in on Thursday
evening and give it a hearing.
To stimulate the efforts of those
who work, two trips to Honolulu
have been offered as prizes to the men
collecting the greatest number of dol
lars.
