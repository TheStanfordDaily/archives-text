# REYNOLDS NAMES SIX BASKETBALL PLAYERS FOR RENO INVASION

Stanford Team May Take Along
Local Official and Meet Un
defeated Nevadans With a
Squad of But Seven Men
BEAR AND CARDINAL TIED
Six of the squad of eight men that
are to go from Stanford to Iteno Fri
day night to engage the undefeated
University of Nevada basKetball quin
tet were definitely named today by
Captain Reynolds. The substitutes
who wiil make the trip cannot be an
nounced, owing to an agreement which
is yet to he made between Reynolds
and .Manager Ross, ot the Sagebrush
athletes.
!t is definitely decided that Blodget
and Worthy will be forwards in the
Nevada game Saturday night at Reno.
Button will, in all probability, open
the game as cente.r, with Dolan and
Reynolds on the defensive. Wallace
will accompany the team as center,
but, as he is an all round man, the
Easterner may be shifted in at another
position if necessary.
Eight men can lie taken by the Car
dinals, but owing to a request made of
the Xevada players by Reynolds, one
player of this number may have to be
a referee. All referees for games in
the Intercollegiate League must be
accepted by teams from five officials
named by league officers at the be
ginning of the season.
One of the rules of the league is
that the home team has final choice in
selecting officials for games, but in
spite of this custom Captain Reynolds
wired Manager Ross, of Nevada, for
permission to bring either Penaluma,
nf San Francisco, or Boek. of Oakland,
and pay their expenses by taking a
sqtvid of seven players, instead of
eight, as the visitors are allowed to
do. Reynolds has not yet heard from
Nevada, and cannot decide on his
squad until word is received. Either
a substitute forward or a substitute
guard will be taken and possibly both.
League standings are beginning to
take shape so that fans of the indoor
game can "dope" out possible winners
of the 1915 schedule. California's de
feat of the St. Mary's squad last night
at the Catholic institution places the
Bears and Cardinals neck and neck
at the head of the percentage columns.
California will meet the College of
Pacific players this week-end at
same time that the Stanford five con
tests with the Nevadans.
Captain Revnolds stated today that
the last difficulty in the discussions
regarding ineligibility of players on
league teams would probably be
cleared up soon, when the three Col
lege of Pacific men who have born out
lawed will be .restored to berths with
the rest of the Methodist line-up.
These men were ruled out bec?u?e
they had played on Y. M. C. A. teams
The league ruling is that no man slav
ing on a college team can at the same
time be a member of an athletic club
quintet. It has been proved since
these men were outlawed by the sÂ°c
retary of the league that they did not
nlay with the Y. M. C. A. after the In
tercollegiate schedule besan.
