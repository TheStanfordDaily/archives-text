# Cardinal Quintet in Fine Form For Game With Reno
## Stanford Five Invades Territory of Undefeated Nevada Team Tomorrow Evening. 
### 
Final practice last night in Encina
Gymnasium showed the Stanford squad
in the best trim it has shown this sea
ton, and ready for the long trip to
Reno tonight for the big game with
the as yet undefeated Nevada quintet
tomorrow evening. Team work went
off last night with the regularity of a
clock.
Following the receipt of a telegram
from Manager Ross, of the Xevadans.
giving the Cardinals permission to
bring along a local referee to offi
ciate. Coach Reynolds announced that
the only additional player to go to
Reno would be Caughey, guard. This
means that the Stanford squad will
consist of but seven men, as the ex
pense of taking a California official
can be borne only by sacrificing one
man from the representation.
Worthy and Blodget combined speed
and skill last night in a way that is
bound to produce results, if repeated
on the Reno courts. Button's playing
in the game with the College of Pa
cific was full of snap, and shows that
the big man is able to raise the Car
dinal score column. Captain Reynolds
will be in the best form, while Dolan
has rapidly developed into a star de
fense man. Wallace, the new player
from the East, is capable of playing in
any position, and will be the best sub
stitute on the squad.
The Cardinals will appear for the
first time in the snappy new suits re
ceived yesterday from the Graduate
Manager. They are the usual red jer
seys and white trunks.
The Stanford basketball men will be
cared for in fraternity houses at Reno,
and a dance is being planned for their
entertainment after the game. The
squad leaves San Francisco tonight,
and will arrive back on the campus
Sunday evening.
A second varsity game with the St.
Ignatius one hundred and forty-five
pounders wil be played Saturday night
in Encina Gymnasium. This contest
will be exceptionally fast, as the Cath
olics have a scrappy light-weight
squad, and are well matched with the
Cardinal "All-Blacks."
The second team line-up will be:
Davidson, McMahon, Van Every and
Schwarzenbek, forwards; Wheatlv,
center; Bartholomew. Sanger, and
Ward, guards. Templeton will referee.
Coach Reynolds stated yesterday
that possibly Referee Walker, of San
Jose may accompany the first Varsity
to Reno, instead of Penaluma. of San
Francisco, or Boek, of Oakland.
