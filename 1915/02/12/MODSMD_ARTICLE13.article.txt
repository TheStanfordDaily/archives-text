### 
Co-operation was the keynote ol' the
student self-government mass meeting
held in the main room of the Stanford
Union building last night. The speak
ers urged the responsibility of the stu
dents to get behind the governing bod
ies, and the necessity that this be
done, if student control is to last it
Stanford.
The meeting, whicn lasted a little
over a half hour, was well attended,
and underclassmen made up a major
ity of the audience, though a number of
upperclassnien were also present.
Talks were made by lour leaders of the
student organizations, A. E. Worthy,
'15, president of the Associated Stu
dents, and a member of the Executive
Committee, the University Conference,
tloverning Hoard of Athletic Fields,
and the Student Council; O. H. Casile,
'I 1, president of the University Confer
ence and chairman of the Student
Council; S. S. Simonson, 'lij, Student
Adviser, and a member of the Univer
sity Conference, the Student Council,
utid the Executive Committee, and T.
E. Workman, '14, vice-president of the
Associated Students and a member of
i lie University Conference, the Student
Council and the Executive Committee.
Castle presided, and in opening tne
meeting he said: "There have been
statements openly made recently that
the student control at Stanford is
weakening, and if that is true it is be
cause the student body generally is ig
norant of the methods of government
and the purpose and rules of the gov
erning bodies." He then called on
Worthy, to explain the different stu
dent body organizations, and to give
the distinctions between them.
Worthy expained that there were
three standing committees affect
ing the men ot' the Universi
ty. One of these is the Executive
Committee of the Associated Students.
This body of twelve men lias chary,' l
of general student activities, such as
athletic and other contests, and their
management. The Hoard of Control of
Athletic Fields, a joint committee oi
the Faculty and students, has con
trol of all permanent improvements of
athletic fields. The board lias a large
"inn of money at its disposal, and has
the duty of maintaining the grounds
or the various sports. The third or
ganization is the University Confer
once. It is tlie special organ of stu
dent control or student self-govern
ment. The Conference elects five mem
bers of the Student Council from its
membership, and the Student Adviser
is an ex-officio councilman, making
six in all.
Castle then explained the workings
of the University Conference and the
Council. The Conference is composed
of thirty-two men. Most of them are
elected by the departments, each d?-
partment being allowed one represen
tative for each forty men. They choos?
their own president and secretary
who are not ex-officio members of thÂ«'
Council. The duties of the Conference
has been to formulate rules for self
government, and regulations have
been drawn up covering the essential
features of college life. The Council
is the judicial department of the Con
ference and acts on cases of the viola
tion of these rules that are brought be
fore it. It is not the duty of the Coun
cil to voluntarily attempt to uncover
cases of violation. Castle said in part:
The members of the Student Cou.i
cil are criticised for being harsh when
a man is expelled from college. Hut
the fact is that the members are only
possessed with an averag eamount of
conscience, and they know that in the
long run the most moderate course is
to be strict in enforcing the rules.
"Stndent control was won in 1912.
At that time three points were thor
oughly understood by all
First, that though the students were
given liberty, they were not to trans
late it into license. Second, that stu
dent control was not given to them
and to their successors forever, but to
hold during good behavior. Third,
that each man who shares the bene
fits of student control is also to share
its burdens. Assumption of responsi
bility is the crux of the whole matte".
Student control is self-control, and
more. It is control of your neighbor,
when he is net able to control him
self. The original conception of stu
dent control, including the reporting
of breaches of the rules to the Conn
cil, when such action seemed neces
sary."
Student Adviser Simonson was then
called on to explain some of the ruk\s
of the Conference, and tell the duties
of his office. He stated that the posi
tion was created in 190f>, and that the
Stndent Adviser was intended to be a
mediator between the students and
Faculty. The basic idea of student
government at Stanford is to enforce
the regulations current in outside com -
munities on the men of the Univer
sity. Though other questions are dealt
with, one of the principle ones is the
liquor problem. In 190S, when condi
tions were serious, the Hoard of Trus
tees of the University passed a rule
forbidding liquor on the campus, and
making any person bringing liquor on
the campus or becoming intoxicated
either on the campus or elsew'here
liable to expulsion. The same regula
tion was later adopted by the Aca
demic Council. In 1912, when student
government was instituted, it was ap
parent that the liquor question would
be a difficult one for it. It was seen,
though, that the only way to meet the
question was to strictly enforce the
University rule on the subject.
Another matter which the Council
considers is the enforcement of the
payment of debts. The organization
lias not alolwed itself to become a
general bill collecting agency, and
only considers the cases recommended
to it by the Student Adviser.
The last speaker, T. E. Workman,
urged co-operation on the part of the
students with the student government
organizations.
