# STUDENT SOLICITORS RENEW INTEREST IN CHARITY CAMPAIGN
## 
### 
Men who desire to help the Associ
ated Charities of San Francisco in its
"Dollar a Door-Hell" campaign lo
raise funds for furthering the work
of the organization during the com
ing year, were met by a representa
tive of the association last night in
the Union.
The plan, which is to solicit from in
dividual houeholders, to whom speech
es have already been made, was laid
before them. As yet, there are many
districts in the city not covered by
solicitors, in which ease many of the
dollars needed by the poor will be
lost. For this reason, the organiza
tion earnestly requests Stanford men
who can do so to call at the office of
the Associated Charities, 328 Post
street. San Francisco, and there re
ceive instructions as to how to go
about the work.
As the number of college students
enrolled in the work is small, the con
test for the free trip to Honolulu, of
fered to the student who collects the
highest number of dollars, does not
promise to be very keen.
