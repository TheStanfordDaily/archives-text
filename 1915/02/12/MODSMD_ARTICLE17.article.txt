# RECORDS

### 
Records are an essential part of
every combination or organization.
They are the sources of information,
the basis of future knowledge. In the
days of ancient history we find the
native narrative, history, and records
handed down from one person to an
other, but very seldom recorded for
future reference. Gradually methods
were evolved for inscribing facts in
that they would he available for fu
ture knowledge; and at the present
time we have modern systems, such
as printing, bookeeping, accounting
and filing to meet the demands that
future generations will place on the
present.
During the past few days printed
cards have been sent out to all Se
niors by the 1916 Quad. The Quad is
a record of each class member's un
dergraduate days. In order to be a
complete record it should include in
formation in regard to every member
of the graduating class. Some of the
Seniors do not give the matter an
other thought after the card is re
ceived, but lay it aside and forget all
about it. Others say that they do not
care to blow about their honors, and
for that reason fail to return the card
to the year book. Still others say
that they do not see any reason for
handing in their names, when they
have no honors, and have never been
engaged in any undergraduate activi
ties.
Cast aside these perverted notions
and remember that your name, and
the activities which you have entered
into, are an integral part of the class
history, and as a matter of record
should be printed in the 1910 Quad.
