the University of Minnesota, January
12, 1915, and they were later printed iu

Isaiah 42:9. Behold the former
things are come to pass, and new
things do 1 declare: before they spring
forth 1 tell you of them.
I was fortunate enough to be born
at the close of one educational, indus
trial, and political epoch and the be
ginning of another. Fortunately or
unfortunately, I entered college a lit
tle more than 30 years ago when what
is know as intercollegiate athletics
were just rising to prominence in the
educational world. Until about tin!
time of the Civil War the world was
still dominated by transcedatism, sen
timentalism, and religious supersti
tion. Under the dominant theories of
that time the body was an evil thing
to be starved, repressed, and held in
subjection. Physical vigor and prow
ess were looked upon with real sus
picion. The only athlete of the day
was the prize fighter, and he was hold
it!) to the rising generation as the ogre
and evil spirit of the whole world. The
general attitude on this matter was
probably better shown in the attitude
toward the criminal than elsewhere.
The criminal was always considered,
up to this time, as a physical bully
who had been led to his criminality
chiefly because of his superabundant
physical powers. No better evidence
of the change that has come over the
world in the last generation could be
conceived than the fact that whatever
may be the philosophical relation of
mind to matter, we all know today
that the criminal is usually a man
whose body has been improperly nour
ished. and who was physically weak
before he became criminally degen
erate. He is one who has not had
physical development and strength
enough to .resist either the temptation
of the mind or body.
Some years ago when I stood at
Oympia, in Greece, I was more than
glad that, under a voluntary system of
studies, I had kept up my Greek and
Latin, and that I had at. east a smat
tering of knowedge of the position of
Greece in the history of the world. As
I stood on that over memorable spot
and the vision of the past rose before
my mind, T did not doubt, and T do not
doubt, that the games and friendly con

tests, and the love of the Greek for
outdoor sports, was an important in
fluence in bringing about those imper
ishable achievements in the fine arts
which made the glory of Greece and
made ns forever her debtor. The ad
miration of the Greek for the human
body and the human form in all of its
perfection, doubtless had a direct and
vital influence 011 both the literature
and the sculpture of that nation. Hut
it should not be overlooked that the
prize to the victor was a laurel wreath,
and I am not informed that the con
testants were professionally coached,
or even that the victors later entered
upon professional athletics as a means
of livelihood.
The world goes by action and re
action. After a generation of intense
development of intercollegiate sports
we seem to have reached another turn
in the tide. The college hero of 18(10
tried to pose either as a literateur or
an orator. He was either the long
haired. sentimental, emaciated, dys
peptic poet, or a loud-mouthed, froth
ing stump-speaker and orator. Many
causes tended to change these condi
tions in this country. In the first place
the Darwinian theory and the doctrine
of evolution helped to break down tlie
religious superstitions that had dom
inated the world thus far. Again the
application of science to industry
called for a vigor and physical endur
ance that had not been customary
among college men. More and more of
tlie college men began to go either in
to commercial and industrial business
or into engineering and professions
having to do with things. Perhaps the
Civil War as much as any other one
thing, showed the utility of a good
body and the necessity of courage,
vigor and endurance. The first tang
ible evidence of the changed attitude
was the Amherst gymnasium opened
in 1861, with its required gymnastics
for all students. Gymnastics is a sys
tem of physical training for the devel
opment of the individual. Athletics, as
practiced in the last generation, is a
system of competitive sport for vic
tory. Of the need of developing the
body today to the highest perfection,
no sane person raises a question. The
life of the college undergraduate is
sedentary, and. under our present eco
nomic conditions, the life of the col
lege graduate, even of the one that
?ioes into commercial life, is largely
sedentary. Hence the need of con
scious and systematic efforts to per
fect the body and increase the bodily
endurance and strength.

Some years ago when I stood at
Oympia, in Greece, I was more than
glad that, under a voluntary system of
studies, I had kept up my Greek and
Latin, and that I had at. east a smat
tering of knowedge of the position of
Greece in the history of the world. As
I stood on that over memorable spot
and the vision of the past rose before
my mind, T did not doubt, and T do not
doubt, that the games and friendly con

tests, and the love of the Greek for
outdoor sports, was an important in
fluence in bringing about those imper
ishable achievements in the fine arts
which made the glory of Greece and
made ns forever her debtor. The ad
miration of the Greek for the human
body and the human form in all of its
perfection, doubtless had a direct and
vital influence 011 both the literature
and the sculpture of that nation. Hut
it should not be overlooked that the
prize to the victor was a laurel wreath,
and I am not informed that the con
testants were professionally coached,
or even that the victors later entered
upon professional athletics as a means
of livelihood.
The world goes by action and re
action. After a generation of intense
development of intercollegiate sports
we seem to have reached another turn
in the tide. The college hero of 18(10
tried to pose either as a literateur or
an orator. He was either the long
haired. sentimental, emaciated, dys
peptic poet, or a loud-mouthed, froth
ing stump-speaker and orator. Many
causes tended to change these condi
tions in this country. In the first place
the Darwinian theory and the doctrine
of evolution helped to break down tlie
religious superstitions that had dom
inated the world thus far. Again the
application of science to industry
called for a vigor and physical endur
ance that had not been customary
among college men. More and more of
tlie college men began to go either in
to commercial and industrial business
or into engineering and professions
having to do with things. Perhaps the
Civil War as much as any other one
thing, showed the utility of a good
body and the necessity of courage,
vigor and endurance. The first tang
ible evidence of the changed attitude
was the Amherst gymnasium opened
in 1861, with its required gymnastics
for all students. Gymnastics is a sys
tem of physical training for the devel
opment of the individual. Athletics, as
practiced in the last generation, is a
system of competitive sport for vic
tory. Of the need of developing the
body today to the highest perfection,
no sane person raises a question. The
life of the college undergraduate is
sedentary, and. under our present eco
nomic conditions, the life of the col
lege graduate, even of the one that
?ioes into commercial life, is largely
sedentary. Hence the need of con
scious and systematic efforts to per
fect the body and increase the bodily
endurance and strength.

I was fortunate enough to be born
at the close of one educational, indus
trial, and political epoch and the be

tle more than 30 years ago when what
is know as intercollegiate athletics
were just rising to prominence in the
educational world. Until about tin!
time of the Civil War the world was
still dominated by transcedatism, sen
timentalism, and religious supersti
tion. Under the dominant theories of
that time the body was an evil thing
to be starved, repressed, and held in
subjection. Physical vigor and prow
ess were looked upon with real sus
picion. The only athlete of the day
was the prize fighter, and he was hold
it!) to the rising generation as the ogre
and evil spirit of the whole world. The
general attitude on this matter was
probably better shown in the attitude
toward the criminal than elsewhere.
The criminal was always considered,
up to this time, as a physical bully
who had been led to his criminality
chiefly because of his superabundant
physical powers. No better evidence
of the change that has come over the
world in the last generation could be

ing stump-speaker and orator. Many
causes tended to change these condi
tions in this country. In the first place
the Darwinian theory and the doctrine
of evolution helped to break down tlie
religious superstitions that had dom
inated the world thus far. Again the
application of science to industry
called for a vigor and physical endur
ance that had not been customary
among college men. More and more of
tlie college men began to go either in
to commercial and industrial business
or into engineering and professions
having to do with things. Perhaps the
Civil War as much as any other one
thing, showed the utility of a good
body and the necessity of courage,
vigor and endurance. The first tang
ible evidence of the changed attitude
was the Amherst gymnasium opened
in 1861, with its required gymnastics
for all students. Gymnastics is a sys
tem of physical training for the devel
opment of the individual. Athletics, as
practiced in the last generation, is a
system of competitive sport for vic
tory. Of the need of developing the
body today to the highest perfection,
no sane person raises a question. The
life of the college undergraduate is
sedentary, and. under our present eco
nomic conditions, the life of the col
lege graduate, even of the one that
?ioes into commercial life, is largely
sedentary. Hence the need of con
scious and systematic efforts to per
fect the body and increase the bodily
endurance and strength.
