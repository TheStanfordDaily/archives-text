# The
						Social Whirl

Stanford, February 12, 1915.
Dearest Ma: One hundred and
three years ago today, Abe Lincoln
was the best thing that happened
throughout the civilized world. If it
had not been for February 12, 1812, a
lot that has happened would never
have been thought of. Among these
are the emancipation of women, Lin
coln's Gettysburg address (it starts
out: When in the course of human
events), and the formation of the
Union. The great war between the
civil North and the uncivil South orig
inated our great Union. Of course
you've heard of the Civil War, and of
our present-day Civil Service. It may
be foolish for me to tell you these
things, but it is so long since you
graduated from high school, that per
haps you have them wrong in your
mind. Speaking of the Union re
minds me that up here we recently
dedicated a new building in commem
oration of it. It is to be the center of
our social activities, and is furnished
on the outside in white Mission style.
Have you ever seen a white mission?
The inside has never been finished.
Considering that we have only 800
girls, our social whirl is terrific. Tt
makes a fellow so dizzy at times, I've
heard them say, that they cannot
study or attend classes the morning
after, and consequently go on proba
tion. Being on probation is like walk
ing a tight rope in a fifty-mile gale.
To get in the social whirl one must
have a couple of white collars, a fast
laundry, energy and ambition, nimble,

but hardy feet, and a much bigger al
lowance than mine. The social whirl
consists of dances, moon and daylight
strolls, formal and informal, and lots
of studying in the Library. I'd rather
study a girl out of doors any old day,
wouldn't you? The social whirl leads
to probation, flunking, or engage
ments, which a.rc of two kinds, inter
locutory and final. Do you wonder
at the serious turn my thoughts have
taken? College does that; association,
both Y. M.and Y. W., keeps one's
mind off the frivolous minor things
that are characteristic of home life.
Hoping you are not envious of our in
tellectual atmosphere, I am with love,
your SONNY.
