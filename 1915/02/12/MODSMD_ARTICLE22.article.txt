# STUDENTS MAY ATTEND EXPOSITION IN A BODY
## WILL PARTICIPATE IN LARGE DEMONSTRATIONS. 
### 
Extensive preparations are being
made in San Francisco and neighbor
ing cities for a great demonstration on
the opening day of the Fair. Plans
are already underway leading to the
organization of communities of Stan
ford and Palo Alto as a participating
group in the great demonstration. The
Stanford Band will go as a body, un
der the auspices of the organizing
committee, in addition to other fea
tures.
It is highly desirable that an ap
proximate estimate of the number of
people intending to go to the city from
Palo Alto on the opening day be made
in the next day or two.
In order that there may be no con
fusion, badges may be secured by all
parties attending the exposition from
the University and Palo Alto. These
badges wil be sold at ">oc each, and
will be good for admission to the Ex
position grounds without the usual de
lay at the ticket windows and at the
turnstiles. Holders of admission
badges may go and come as often as
they wish on the opening day. These
badges may be obtained at certain
stores in Palo Alto and on the cam
pus. to l>e designated lat-r. It is im
portant that all who wish to attend
the Exposition on the opening day.
leave their names at the Stanford
Bookstore not later than Tuesday. If
sufficient numbers decide to go a spe
cial train will be secured. Details will
be announced later.
