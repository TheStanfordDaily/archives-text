# IMPRESSIONS OF GAILOR
## COMPARE UNIVERSITIES OF WEST AND SOUTH Democratic Conditions Prevail in Southern Colleges, Says Bishop of Tennessee in Interview 
### 
In comparing Stanford University
with the universities of the South, and
concerning the impression it makes
upon the Southern university man, the
Right Reverend Frank Thomas Gailor,
Bishop of Tennessee and Chancellor of
the University of the South, which is
isolated much as Stanford is, in an in
terview granted to The Daily Palo
Alto, said: "I have been profundly
impressed with the number and beauty
of the buildings at Stanford, and the
spaciousness of its domain. No where
in the South is there a university
which equals it in this respect. In fact,
it seems that every facility that was
ever dreamed of to invite and assist
students in the way of knowledge has
been provided here, and the students
bear, therefore, a corresponding re
sponsibility.
"University life is pretty much the
same everywhere, but there is one
likeness between the universities of
the South and Stanford, and that is
the simple democracy, which, I fear,
does nor exist in the same degree in
our great Eastern universities. It is
a fine thing to have one place—and
that a place where leadership is be
ing created and trained —where men
a,re not separated by artificial barriers
of wealth and station, but are judged
and classified according to what they
are in themselves.
"Few Southern Universities are co
educational, but that, is largely be
cause comparatively few Southern
girls, as yet, take a university course.
The change is coming, however, and
it will solve many of the social prob
lems which now beset our institutions
of learning.
"As it is at Stanford, there is in the
South an intense interest in athletics
especially football. The Greek letter
fraternities flourish there, but they
do not as yet pretend to house the
students, r realize what an advant
age your students have in climate. Our
fellows are confined to the use of the
gymnasium for about about four
months or more, and this makes the
football and baseball seasons short.
"Finally, I believe there is a stead
ily growing sentiment among college
men all over the United States, that
university education is primarily a
prepapration for good citizenship, and
not merely a training for individual
success in life, and this is as it should
be. Individualism and utilitarianism
are enemies to culture, and we want
culture, not merely knowledge."
