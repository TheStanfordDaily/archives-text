# HETTINGER WINS ANNUAL BONNHEIM DISCUSSION
## Fifty-Dollar Prize Awarded Experienced Debater FIVE SPEAKERS IN CONTEST "Ethical Aspect of Minimum Wage For Women" Is General Subject 
### 
A. J. Hettinger, '16, received the
judges' decision from a field of four
other contestants at the Bonnheim dis
cussion last Friday evening, thereby
winning the annual prize of $50. Het
tinger. who tied fo.r fourth place in the
Bonnheim essay contest, thus secur
ing the privilege of entering the dis
cussion, is a debater of considerable
experience at Stanford. He was a
member of his Sophomore debating
team, and a contestant for Carnot
honors last year. He also debated in
the Intercollegiate contest with Cali
fornia last semester. He is a member
of the national debating fraternity,
Delta Sigma Rho.
The question on which the speeches
were based was"The Ethical Aspect
of the Minimum Wage for Women and
Minors." . Each man developed this
general subject from some special
viewpoint, not being bound to repeat
the substance of his essay, but free
to introduce new ideas.
Quoting Kipling, Hettinger began,
" 'The women that toil all their days
that the lives of their brothers may be
long,' may be conferring a temporary
benefit 011 society, by making a lower
cost of production; but society, sacri
ficing the well-being of the worker,
sells its birthright for a mess of pot
au;e. The employer shifts the incidents
of his policy to the shoulders of so
ciety, however, and reaps the tem
porary benefit.
"Wages are determined by the marg
inal productivity of labor," he contin
ued. "But women's minimum wage is
below the subsistence level, because It
is fixed by what the most necessitous
woman will accept. Women are less mo
bile than men. They cannot move
about as freely to new fields of em
ployment, and consequently must ac
cept what is offered.
"In Australia, which is an agricul
tural country, minimum wage is pos
sible; for those who are thrown out
of employment by it can go back to
the land. With us in the United States
it is different. Those who lose their
positions 011 account of the under
value of their work, would have no
place to go, and nothing to do. After
a generation, this condition might
adjust itself, but for the present work
ers there would be nothing out unem
ployment.
"If the state merely figures for to
day, leaving out of consideration the
suffering which would .result, the min
imum wage is worse than nothing. The
government must accept the respon
sibility. Employment to the worker
can only come when we improve the
marginal productivity of the labor, and
the state would have an ethical duty to
bring this improvement about by edu
cation and proper care, if it imposed
a minimum wage on the community.
If this ethical duty is not accepted, the
minimum wage is impossible. If the
state does its part, it would be not
only possible, but highly desirable."
The first speaker of the evening was
.T. W. Fribley, '16. In his dissertation,
he aimed to prove that the minimum
wage law was in harmony with the
maxim of "The greatest good to the
greatest number."
"A minimum standard, which does
not mean a minimum wage, is justifi
able on ethical grounds," he said.
"Women and children are liable for
their low wages, due to their weak
ness and relative inefficiency. This
condition can be remedied by educa
tion, but cannot be secured on an
empty stomach. Leisure and proper
nourishment must be provided."
"The question before us,' said A. F.
C'oyle, '15, who was the next speaker,
"is not how to get the women out of
the factory, but how to protect her in
it. Moral suasion has failed to miti
gate the poor condition, and law is the
only thing that will do it."
Coyle condemned child labor utterly,
as well as a minimum wage for minors
on the grounds that the higher the pay,
the more incentive there would be for
the children to work, and the greater
would be the loss to society. "It is
dear for the state in any event to drive
a hard bargain with childhood," he
maintained. "Far better would it be
to subsidize the parents.
"Wages must be a fixed charge on
industry. If a business is so poor that
it cannot thrive but on the welfare of
its workers, it should go out of exist
ence."
H. W. Frantz spoke next. "The con
viction is general in the United
States," he began, "that the nation is
abundantly capable of producing all
that may reasonably be required for
the satisfaction of all wants. The be
lief is widespread and growing that
there is gross injustice in the distri
bution of the social product. The min
imum wage may be considered as a
step toward equalizing distribution.
For women and children, it is, at the
present stage of public consciousness,
the most urgent and expedient step
toward readjustment.
"It is impossible that the condition
of toiling women and children will be
much bettered by voluntary or forced
reform in surroundings. The minimum
wage law must provide a stimulus,
and industry will adapt itself to the
change by the development of higher
efficiency, which is merely to say, the
application of greater intelligence to
the productive process."
.T. C. Holland, '17, the last speaker
of the evening, maintained that, if the
minimum law were backed by public
opinion, it could be enforced. "The
question must be judged by ethical
standards."
"The benefit of the increased wage
to the employes who will be retained
can hardly be overestimated. It means
an efficient life and a normal develop
ment. For those who are discharged,
relief must be afforded, or they could
well claim that they are being sacri
ficed on the altar of sentimentality.
Our reform should strike the roots of
the evil, and the minimum law would
do that efficiently."
Professors A. W. Meyer, of the Med
ical department; W. H. Carruth, of the
English department, and Associate
Professor Jefferson Elmore, of the
Latin department, were the judges.
Chaplain Charles Gardner presided.

"Wages are determined by the marg

below the subsistence level, because It
is fixed by what the most necessitous

"In Australia, which is an agricul

of employment by it can go back to
the land. With us in the United States
it is different. Those who lose their

value of their work, would have no

"If the state merely figures for to

marginal productivity of the labor, and
the state would have an ethical duty to

a minimum wage on the community.
If this ethical duty is not accepted, the
minimum wage is impossible. If the
state does its part, it would be not

The first speaker of the evening was
.T. W. Fribley, '16. In his dissertation,
he aimed to prove that the minimum
wage law was in harmony with the
maxim of "The greatest good to the
greatest number."
"A minimum standard, which does
not mean a minimum wage, is justifi
able on ethical grounds," he said.
"Women and children are liable for
their low wages, due to their weak
ness and relative inefficiency. This
condition can be remedied by educa
tion, but cannot be secured on an
empty stomach. Leisure and proper
nourishment must be provided."
"The question before us,' said A. F.
C'oyle, '15, who was the next speaker,
"is not how to get the women out of
the factory, but how to protect her in
it. Moral suasion has failed to miti
gate the poor condition, and law is the
only thing that will do it."
Coyle condemned child labor utterly,
as well as a minimum wage for minors
on the grounds that the higher the pay,
the more incentive there would be for
the children to work, and the greater
would be the loss to society. "It is
dear for the state in any event to drive
a hard bargain with childhood," he
maintained. "Far better would it be
to subsidize the parents.
"Wages must be a fixed charge on
industry. If a business is so poor that
it cannot thrive but on the welfare of
its workers, it should go out of exist
ence."
H. W. Frantz spoke next. "The con
viction is general in the United
States," he began, "that the nation is
abundantly capable of producing all
that may reasonably be required for
the satisfaction of all wants. The be
lief is widespread and growing that
there is gross injustice in the distri
bution of the social product. The min
imum wage may be considered as a
step toward equalizing distribution.
For women and children, it is, at the
present stage of public consciousness,
the most urgent and expedient step
toward readjustment.
"It is impossible that the condition
of toiling women and children will be
much bettered by voluntary or forced
reform in surroundings. The minimum
wage law must provide a stimulus,
and industry will adapt itself to the
change by the development of higher
efficiency, which is merely to say, the
application of greater intelligence to
the productive process."
.T. C. Holland, '17, the last speaker
of the evening, maintained that, if the
minimum law were backed by public
opinion, it could be enforced. "The
question must be judged by ethical
standards."
"The benefit of the increased wage
to the employes who will be retained
can hardly be overestimated. It means
an efficient life and a normal develop
ment. For those who are discharged,
relief must be afforded, or they could
well claim that they are being sacri
ficed on the altar of sentimentality.
Our reform should strike the roots of
the evil, and the minimum law would
do that efficiently."
Professors A. W. Meyer, of the Med
ical department; W. H. Carruth, of the
English department, and Associate
Professor Jefferson Elmore, of the
Latin department, were the judges.
Chaplain Charles Gardner presided.
A. J. Hettinger, '16, received the
judges' decision from a field of four
other contestants at the Bonnheim dis

winning the annual prize of $50. Het

Bonnheim essay contest, thus secur

The question on which the speeches
were based was"The Ethical Aspect

general subject from some special
viewpoint, not being bound to repeat
the substance of his essay, but free

Quoting Kipling, Hettinger began,
" 'The women that toil all their days

a minimum wage on the community.
If this ethical duty is not accepted, the
minimum wage is impossible. If the
state does its part, it would be not
only possible, but highly desirable."
The first speaker of the evening was
.T. W. Fribley, '16. In his dissertation,
he aimed to prove that the minimum
wage law was in harmony with the
maxim of "The greatest good to the
greatest number."
"A minimum standard, which does
not mean a minimum wage, is justifi
able on ethical grounds," he said.
"Women and children are liable for
their low wages, due to their weak
ness and relative inefficiency. This
condition can be remedied by educa
tion, but cannot be secured on an
empty stomach. Leisure and proper
nourishment must be provided."
"The question before us,' said A. F.
C'oyle, '15, who was the next speaker,
"is not how to get the women out of
the factory, but how to protect her in
it. Moral suasion has failed to miti
gate the poor condition, and law is the
only thing that will do it."
Coyle condemned child labor utterly,
as well as a minimum wage for minors
on the grounds that the higher the pay,
the more incentive there would be for
the children to work, and the greater
would be the loss to society. "It is
dear for the state in any event to drive
a hard bargain with childhood," he
maintained. "Far better would it be
to subsidize the parents.
"Wages must be a fixed charge on
industry. If a business is so poor that
it cannot thrive but on the welfare of
its workers, it should go out of exist
ence."
H. W. Frantz spoke next. "The con
viction is general in the United
States," he began, "that the nation is
abundantly capable of producing all
that may reasonably be required for
the satisfaction of all wants. The be
lief is widespread and growing that
there is gross injustice in the distri
bution of the social product. The min
imum wage may be considered as a
step toward equalizing distribution.
For women and children, it is, at the
present stage of public consciousness,
the most urgent and expedient step
toward readjustment.
"It is impossible that the condition
of toiling women and children will be
much bettered by voluntary or forced
reform in surroundings. The minimum
wage law must provide a stimulus,
and industry will adapt itself to the
change by the development of higher
efficiency, which is merely to say, the
application of greater intelligence to
the productive process."
.T. C. Holland, '17, the last speaker
of the evening, maintained that, if the
minimum law were backed by public
opinion, it could be enforced. "The
question must be judged by ethical
standards."
"The benefit of the increased wage
to the employes who will be retained
can hardly be overestimated. It means
an efficient life and a normal develop
ment. For those who are discharged,
relief must be afforded, or they could
well claim that they are being sacri
ficed on the altar of sentimentality.
Our reform should strike the roots of
the evil, and the minimum law would
do that efficiently."
Professors A. W. Meyer, of the Med
ical department; W. H. Carruth, of the
English department, and Associate
Professor Jefferson Elmore, of the
Latin department, were the judges.
Chaplain Charles Gardner presided.
A. J. Hettinger, '16, received the
judges' decision from a field of four
other contestants at the Bonnheim dis
cussion last Friday evening, thereby
winning the annual prize of $50. Het
tinger. who tied fo.r fourth place in the
Bonnheim essay contest, thus secur
ing the privilege of entering the dis
cussion, is a debater of considerable
experience at Stanford. He was a
member of his Sophomore debating
team, and a contestant for Carnot
honors last year. He also debated in
the Intercollegiate contest with Cali
fornia last semester. He is a member
of the national debating fraternity,
Delta Sigma Rho.
The question on which the speeches
were based was"The Ethical Aspect
of the Minimum Wage for Women and
Minors." . Each man developed this
general subject from some special
viewpoint, not being bound to repeat
the substance of his essay, but free
to introduce new ideas.
Quoting Kipling, Hettinger began,
" 'The women that toil all their days
that the lives of their brothers may be
long,' may be conferring a temporary
benefit 011 society, by making a lower
cost of production; but society, sacri
ficing the well-being of the worker,
sells its birthright for a mess of pot
au;e. The employer shifts the incidents
of his policy to the shoulders of so
ciety, however, and reaps the tem
porary benefit.
"Wages are determined by the marg
inal productivity of labor," he contin
ued. "But women's minimum wage is
below the subsistence level, because It
is fixed by what the most necessitous
woman will accept. Women are less mo
bile than men. They cannot move
about as freely to new fields of em
ployment, and consequently must ac
cept what is offered.
"In Australia, which is an agricul
tural country, minimum wage is pos
sible; for those who are thrown out
of employment by it can go back to
the land. With us in the United States
it is different. Those who lose their
positions 011 account of the under
value of their work, would have no
place to go, and nothing to do. After
a generation, this condition might
adjust itself, but for the present work
ers there would be nothing out unem
ployment.
"If the state merely figures for to
day, leaving out of consideration the
suffering which would .result, the min
imum wage is worse than nothing. The
government must accept the respon
sibility. Employment to the worker
can only come when we improve the
marginal productivity of the labor, and
the state would have an ethical duty to
bring this improvement about by edu
cation and proper care, if it imposed
a minimum wage on the community.
If this ethical duty is not accepted, the
minimum wage is impossible. If the
state does its part, it would be not
only possible, but highly desirable."
