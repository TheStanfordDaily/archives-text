# HETTINGER WINS ANNUAL BONNHEIM DISCUSSION
## Fifty-Dollar Prize Awarded Experienced Debater FIVE SPEAKERS IN CONTEST "Ethical Aspect of Minimum Wage For Women" Is General Subject 
### 
A. J. Hettinger, '16, received the
judges' decision from a field of four
other contestants at the Bonnheim dis
cussion last Friday evening, thereby
winning the annual prize of $50. Het
tinger. who tied fo.r fourth place in the
Bonnheim essay contest, thus secur
ing the privilege of entering the dis
cussion, is a debater of considerable
experience at Stanford. He was a
member of his Sophomore debating
team, and a contestant for Carnot
honors last year. He also debated in
the Intercollegiate contest with Cali
fornia last semester. He is a member
of the national debating fraternity,
Delta Sigma Rho.
The question on which the speeches
were based was"The Ethical Aspect
of the Minimum Wage for Women and
Minors." . Each man developed this
general subject from some special
viewpoint, not being bound to repeat
the substance of his essay, but free
to introduce new ideas.
Quoting Kipling, Hettinger began,
" 'The women that toil all their days
that the lives of their brothers may be
long,' may be conferring a temporary
benefit 011 society, by making a lower
cost of production; but society, sacri
ficing the well-being of the worker,
sells its birthright for a mess of pot
au;e. The employer shifts the incidents
of his policy to the shoulders of so
ciety, however, and reaps the tem
porary benefit.
"Wages are determined by the marg
inal productivity of labor," he contin
ued. "But women's minimum wage is
below the subsistence level, because It
is fixed by what the most necessitous
woman will accept. Women are less mo
bile than men. They cannot move
about as freely to new fields of em
ployment, and consequently must ac
cept what is offered.
"In Australia, which is an agricul
tural country, minimum wage is pos
sible; for those who are thrown out
of employment by it can go back to
the land. With us in the United States
it is different. Those who lose their
positions 011 account of the under
value of their work, would have no
place to go, and nothing to do. After
a generation, this condition might
adjust itself, but for the present work
ers there would be nothing out unem
ployment.
"If the state merely figures for to
day, leaving out of consideration the
suffering which would .result, the min
imum wage is worse than nothing. The
government must accept the respon
sibility. Employment to the worker
can only come when we improve the
marginal productivity of the labor, and
the state would have an ethical duty to
bring this improvement about by edu
cation and proper care, if it imposed
a minimum wage on the community.
If this ethical duty is not accepted, the
minimum wage is impossible. If the
state does its part, it would be not
only possible, but highly desirable."
The first speaker of the evening was
.T. W. Fribley, '16. In his dissertation,
he aimed to prove that the minimum
wage law was in harmony with the
maxim of "The greatest good to the
greatest number."
"A minimum standard, which does
not mean a minimum wage, is justifi
