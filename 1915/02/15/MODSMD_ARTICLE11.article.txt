# PRESIDENT BRANNER'S RESIGNATION ACCEPTED
## Duties as Head of University Will End July 31 MAY REMAIN ON CAMPUS Board of Trustees Canvassing Field For Successor—No Action Yet Taken 
### 
It is announced from the President's
office that, in accordance with the dec
laration he made at the time of his in
auguration, that he would retire at the
end of two years, President Hranner
has tendered his resignation to the
Board of Trustees, to take effect on
■luly 31 of this year, and the resigna
tion has been accepted.
The Trustees, in accepting the res
ignation, invited Dr. Hranner to con
tinue his residence on the campus, and
announced that they would maintain
an office in the University building for
his use, and place all the University's
collections of books and other facili
ties at his disposal, in the hope that he
will make the campus his headquar
ters for the continuance "of his scien
tific work.

President Branner voluntarily ten
dered his resignation at this time,
.rather than later, in order that the
Trustees might not in any way he em
barrassed in their task of selecting his
successor by the fact that they did not
technically have his resignation in
their hands.
Knowing that President Branner in
tended to retire at the end of the pres
ent academic year, the Trustees, by
personal investigations, and with the
assistance of Chancellor Jordan and
a number of eminent Eastern educa
tors, have been canvassing the educa
tional field for a suitable man to suc
ceed him, but have not yet taken any
definite action in the matter.


President Itramier
