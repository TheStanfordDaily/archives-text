### 
Chancellor David Starr Jordan ad
dressed a mass meeting held in Palo
Alto yesterday afternoon, in observ
ance of Centenary Sunday.
"The present war in Europe is not
a failure of Christianity, but rather
a failure of Christianity to extend its
principles to the governments of Eu
ropean nations.
"The diplomacy of the governments
of Europe was largely responsiple for
the war. What is secret is corrupt,
and the diplomacy of European coun
tries has been exceedingly secret. It
has been a diplomacy backed by ar
mies.
"There is no such thing as racc
hatred, except where wicked men have
stirred it up for their own ends.
Hatred means ignorance played upon
by wickedness. Germans and French
men are very much alike. Hatred is
not the cause of war."
