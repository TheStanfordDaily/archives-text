Within five days the greatest world's
fair the country has ever known will
be opened. There is scarcely a person
who does not want to be in San Fran
cisco on Saturday to take part in the
celebration. Plans are being perfect
ed in order that Stanford and Palo Al
to, together with the Stanford Band,
may be well represented in the parade,
which will be the big feature of the
opening day.
According to the University sched
ule classes will continue on Saturday
morning, the same as any other day in
the academic year, regardless of an
event of world-wide importance and
interest. In order that the instructors
who have classes on February twentieth
may not be detained on the Farm
against their inclinations, and in order
that the students may not have to cut
classes to be at the Exposition open
ing, it would seem advisable for the
Faculty to decree a University holiday
011 Saturday.
