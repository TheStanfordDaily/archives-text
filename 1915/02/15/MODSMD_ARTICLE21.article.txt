There is a very grave misapprehen
sion about the general object of college
life. The old doctrine was that col
lege lit'e was to make scholars, poets,
and orators. A large number of the
young men and women of any genera
tion are not scholars, have no scholar
ly tastes, and under the most favorable
circumstances and severest training
could never be made scholars. Hence,
if college life really develops the body
sanely and wisely, and brings it to a
high degree of perfection, and at the
same time teaches the student sound
ness ot' judgment and gives him prop
er ideal, I for one, has no particular
complaint to make of the student who
makes his athletics a major and his
mathematics, Greek, or German a
minor, or even if you like, a minimum.
Looking at our intercollegiate athlet
ics, we must at first blush recognize
certain great advantages. In the first
place, it carries the student out of
doors, turns his thoughts from his own
selfish and individual purposes, and in
general gives enjoyment, pleasure, and
relaxation to vast numbers both inside
and outside the colleges. It also gives
a high sense of social solidarity and
common interests. We need, in this
country, perhaps more than elsewhere,
genuine popular amusements to draw
the people away from their work and
worries and into the open air. So far.
so good.
Let us turn our attention for a mo
ment to the effects on the members of
the teams and those who try for the
teams —I mean in the great major
sports, such as football and baseball,
and rowing, where crews are main
tained. First we must mention the
physical dangers. This is the element
which has perhaps attt.racted most
popular attention. For my own part,
I have never looked with disfavor or
alarm upon the physical dangers of
these sports. Any real sport, such
as mountain climbing, has its genuine
dangers, and even where death ensues,
these rare and unusual instances are
by no means conclusive that the good
does not greatly outweigh the evil,
viewed from the standpoint of the pro
gress of society as a whole. After
all, the death of an individual is but
an incident in the progress of the race.
Nor have I ever been able to take much
stock in the charge that football is
brutalizing to the players. 1 am in
finitely more concerned to find some
element in our civilization to take
the place of the pioneer virility and
sense of responsibility and give my
boy real initiative, courage, and en
durance, than I am to improve his
manner of learning.
Hut 1 have not as yet touched what
seems to me the paramount danger in
all of these intercollegiate, competi
tive, sports; and more particularly in
football. This is the strict profession
alism of the sport, and when I say
professionalism, I do not refer to vio
lation of the rules, or the injurious
evasion of the rules, but to the mere

fact that while gymnastics are for per
sonal physical development, and any
true sport is for the mere fun of the
thing, intercollegiate athletics, so
called, are neither for physical devel
opment, nor for sport, but merely for
victory. Intercollegiate athletics have
ceased to be a means to the physical
development of the individual; have
ceased to be a means to any end; but
become an end in themselves. So long
as victory, at any cost, is the real aim
and object of intercollegiate athletics,
we are in danger first, of genuine
over-training—even to the extent of
permanent injury to the players—if
this promises temporary victory. In
the next place, we run the risk of giv
ing up all the fine.r senses of gener
ous courtesy and gentlemanly consid
eration for a competitor, which from
time immemorial has been the charm
and joy of real sport. In the third
place, we have given up all thought
and even pretense of joy in the game
itself and play it desperately for the
one end—victory. But finally, so far
as this side of the question is con
cerned, we resort to all kinds of
doubtful and shady devices and tricks
to deceive and defeat our opponents
and to wrest victory from them by un
fair means. Among the less important
and more amusing expedients of this
kind is the wholly unsportsmanlike
organized rooting or cheering.
But the real indictment against in
tercollegiate athletics, as at present
practiced, rests on the fact that nearly
all competent observers have come to
realize that the competitive teams,
professionally trained to the highest
pitch of skill, and at enormous ex
pense, have been, and remain to this
day, the greatest single obstacle to the
development of any spirit of physical
exercise, sport, or rational fun, for
the great body of university students.
I affirm, without fear of successful
contradiction that the great mass of
students, by which I mean virtually all
who are not members of teams in the
major sports, or candidates for higher
membership, the existence of these
highly trained athletic teams is the
greatest possible discouragement to
any one to take part in these games,
unless he is willing and able to un
dergo an amount of training, and to
give an amount of time that is wholly
inconsistent with sound physical de
velopment and prohibitive of the best
intellectual work. Does an ordinary
student who has due regard for his
formal collegiate work wish to go out
and make an exhibition of himself
alongside of a well-trained and profes
sional team? All psychology, all hu
man experience, all observation an
swers no. So long as we hire profes
sional trainers, or coaches; so long as
we build great prison-like walls
around our athletic fields, so long as
we permit such high admission fees to
be charged, as to shut out the mass of
the students and to bring the town
rabble, the gamblers and the hangers
on in large numbers to the athletic
field; so long as we have put up an
effective barrier to physical develop
ment or to any true sport, and to any
athletics, in the proper sense of that
term, among our college students.
Just in proportion as the team be
comes successful professionally does
the crowd tend to become unacademic.

There is a very grave misapprehen
sion about the general object of college
life. The old doctrine was that col
lege lit'e was to make scholars, poets,
and orators. A large number of the
young men and women of any genera
tion are not scholars, have no scholar
ly tastes, and under the most favorable
circumstances and severest training
could never be made scholars. Hence,
if college life really develops the body
sanely and wisely, and brings it to a
high degree of perfection, and at the
same time teaches the student sound
ness ot' judgment and gives him prop
er ideal, I for one, has no particular
complaint to make of the student who
makes his athletics a major and his
mathematics, Greek, or German a
minor, or even if you like, a minimum.
Looking at our intercollegiate athlet
ics, we must at first blush recognize
certain great advantages. In the first
place, it carries the student out of
doors, turns his thoughts from his own
selfish and individual purposes, and in
general gives enjoyment, pleasure, and
relaxation to vast numbers both inside
and outside the colleges. It also gives
a high sense of social solidarity and
common interests. We need, in this
country, perhaps more than elsewhere,
genuine popular amusements to draw
the people away from their work and
worries and into the open air. So far.
so good.
Let us turn our attention for a mo
ment to the effects on the members of
the teams and those who try for the
teams —I mean in the great major
sports, such as football and baseball,
and rowing, where crews are main
tained. First we must mention the
physical dangers. This is the element
which has perhaps attt.racted most
popular attention. For my own part,
I have never looked with disfavor or
alarm upon the physical dangers of
these sports. Any real sport, such
as mountain climbing, has its genuine
dangers, and even where death ensues,
these rare and unusual instances are
by no means conclusive that the good
does not greatly outweigh the evil,
viewed from the standpoint of the pro
gress of society as a whole. After
all, the death of an individual is but
an incident in the progress of the race.
Nor have I ever been able to take much
stock in the charge that football is
brutalizing to the players. 1 am in
finitely more concerned to find some
element in our civilization to take
the place of the pioneer virility and
sense of responsibility and give my
boy real initiative, courage, and en
durance, than I am to improve his
manner of learning.
Hut 1 have not as yet touched what
seems to me the paramount danger in
all of these intercollegiate, competi
tive, sports; and more particularly in
football. This is the strict profession
alism of the sport, and when I say
professionalism, I do not refer to vio
lation of the rules, or the injurious
evasion of the rules, but to the mere

fact that while gymnastics are for per
sonal physical development, and any
true sport is for the mere fun of the
thing, intercollegiate athletics, so
called, are neither for physical devel
opment, nor for sport, but merely for
victory. Intercollegiate athletics have
ceased to be a means to the physical
development of the individual; have
ceased to be a means to any end; but
become an end in themselves. So long
as victory, at any cost, is the real aim
and object of intercollegiate athletics,
we are in danger first, of genuine
over-training—even to the extent of
permanent injury to the players—if
this promises temporary victory. In
the next place, we run the risk of giv
ing up all the fine.r senses of gener
ous courtesy and gentlemanly consid
eration for a competitor, which from
time immemorial has been the charm
and joy of real sport. In the third
place, we have given up all thought
and even pretense of joy in the game
itself and play it desperately for the
one end—victory. But finally, so far
as this side of the question is con
cerned, we resort to all kinds of
doubtful and shady devices and tricks
to deceive and defeat our opponents
and to wrest victory from them by un
fair means. Among the less important
and more amusing expedients of this
kind is the wholly unsportsmanlike
organized rooting or cheering.
But the real indictment against in
tercollegiate athletics, as at present
practiced, rests on the fact that nearly
all competent observers have come to
realize that the competitive teams,
professionally trained to the highest
pitch of skill, and at enormous ex
pense, have been, and remain to this
day, the greatest single obstacle to the
development of any spirit of physical
exercise, sport, or rational fun, for
the great body of university students.
I affirm, without fear of successful
contradiction that the great mass of
students, by which I mean virtually all
who are not members of teams in the
major sports, or candidates for higher
membership, the existence of these
highly trained athletic teams is the
greatest possible discouragement to
any one to take part in these games,
unless he is willing and able to un
dergo an amount of training, and to
give an amount of time that is wholly
inconsistent with sound physical de
velopment and prohibitive of the best
intellectual work. Does an ordinary
student who has due regard for his
formal collegiate work wish to go out
and make an exhibition of himself
alongside of a well-trained and profes
sional team? All psychology, all hu
man experience, all observation an
swers no. So long as we hire profes
sional trainers, or coaches; so long as
we build great prison-like walls
around our athletic fields, so long as

who are not members of teams in the

any one to take part in these games,

we build great prison-like walls
around our athletic fields, so long as
we permit such high admission fees to
be charged, as to shut out the mass of
the students and to bring the town
rabble, the gamblers and the hangers

There is a very grave misapprehen
sion about the general object of college
life. The old doctrine was that col
lege lit'e was to make scholars, poets,
and orators. A large number of the
young men and women of any genera
tion are not scholars, have no scholar
ly tastes, and under the most favorable
circumstances and severest training
could never be made scholars. Hence,
if college life really develops the body
sanely and wisely, and brings it to a
high degree of perfection, and at the
same time teaches the student sound
ness ot' judgment and gives him prop
er ideal, I for one, has no particular
complaint to make of the student who
makes his athletics a major and his
mathematics, Greek, or German a
minor, or even if you like, a minimum.
Looking at our intercollegiate athlet
ics, we must at first blush recognize
certain great advantages. In the first
place, it carries the student out of
doors, turns his thoughts from his own
selfish and individual purposes, and in
general gives enjoyment, pleasure, and
relaxation to vast numbers both inside
and outside the colleges. It also gives
a high sense of social solidarity and
common interests. We need, in this
country, perhaps more than elsewhere,
genuine popular amusements to draw
the people away from their work and
worries and into the open air. So far.
so good.
Let us turn our attention for a mo
ment to the effects on the members of
the teams and those who try for the
teams —I mean in the great major
sports, such as football and baseball,
and rowing, where crews are main
tained. First we must mention the
physical dangers. This is the element
which has perhaps attt.racted most
popular attention. For my own part,
I have never looked with disfavor or
alarm upon the physical dangers of
these sports. Any real sport, such
as mountain climbing, has its genuine
dangers, and even where death ensues,
these rare and unusual instances are
by no means conclusive that the good
does not greatly outweigh the evil,
viewed from the standpoint of the pro
gress of society as a whole. After
all, the death of an individual is but
an incident in the progress of the race.
Nor have I ever been able to take much
stock in the charge that football is
brutalizing to the players. 1 am in
finitely more concerned to find some
element in our civilization to take
the place of the pioneer virility and
sense of responsibility and give my
boy real initiative, courage, and en
durance, than I am to improve his
manner of learning.
Hut 1 have not as yet touched what
seems to me the paramount danger in
all of these intercollegiate, competi
tive, sports; and more particularly in
football. This is the strict profession
alism of the sport, and when I say
professionalism, I do not refer to vio
lation of the rules, or the injurious
evasion of the rules, but to the mere

fact that while gymnastics are for per
sonal physical development, and any
true sport is for the mere fun of the
thing, intercollegiate athletics, so
called, are neither for physical devel
opment, nor for sport, but merely for
victory. Intercollegiate athletics have
ceased to be a means to the physical
development of the individual; have
ceased to be a means to any end; but
become an end in themselves. So long
as victory, at any cost, is the real aim
and object of intercollegiate athletics,
we are in danger first, of genuine
over-training—even to the extent of
permanent injury to the players—if
this promises temporary victory. In
the next place, we run the risk of giv
ing up all the fine.r senses of gener
ous courtesy and gentlemanly consid
eration for a competitor, which from
time immemorial has been the charm
and joy of real sport. In the third
place, we have given up all thought
and even pretense of joy in the game
itself and play it desperately for the
one end—victory. But finally, so far
as this side of the question is con
cerned, we resort to all kinds of
doubtful and shady devices and tricks
to deceive and defeat our opponents
and to wrest victory from them by un
fair means. Among the less important
and more amusing expedients of this
kind is the wholly unsportsmanlike
organized rooting or cheering.
But the real indictment against in
tercollegiate athletics, as at present
practiced, rests on the fact that nearly
all competent observers have come to
realize that the competitive teams,
professionally trained to the highest
pitch of skill, and at enormous ex
pense, have been, and remain to this
day, the greatest single obstacle to the
development of any spirit of physical
exercise, sport, or rational fun, for
the great body of university students.
I affirm, without fear of successful
contradiction that the great mass of

who are not members of teams in the
