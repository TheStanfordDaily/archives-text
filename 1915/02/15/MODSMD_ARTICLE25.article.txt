# NOTED ADVERTISER SPEAKS AT ENCINA
## GEORGE E. EBERHARD EXPLAINS PRINCIPLES OF ADVERTISING BUSINESS. 
### 
George E. Eberhard, special lectur
er on advertising at the University
of California explained the main prin
ciples of the advertising business at
the sixth of the Encina lecture series
yesterday evening. Eberhard is well
qualified to deal with such a subject,
as he has conducted several advertis
ing campaigns of world-wide success,
and is the head of the largest advertis
ing firm on the Pacific coast. Some of
his most striking remarks were:
"Advertising is the written word of
salesmanship. The best advertisement
is the satisfied customer or client. In
successful advertising, four things
must be obtained: the attention of the
prospective customer, his interest, a
desire on his part for the product ad
vertised, and his decision to purchase
it.
"in answer to the question, 'Will it
pay to take up the advertising profes
sion for a life work,' 1 would say that
advertising today, to the man who is
willing to pay the price for success,
namely, the self-sacrifice demanded
for success in any profession, affords
bigger opportunities for making mon
ey than any other business of which I
know.
"Formerly, the great bulk of adver
tising consisted of exaggerations—
fire-sale fakes, and the like. Now,
truth is essential in advertising. To
secure the best advertisement —the sat
isfied customer—the advertiser must
give a little more than he agrees to
give.
"Advertisers can safely guarantee
only those things which do not need
any guarantee, those things which will
not be brought back to the advertis
er.
"University publications, such as
those issued at Stanford, must be sus
tained by local advertisers. To make
advertisements pay advertisers to have
them published in your college papers
and magazines, you should, when pur
chasing, mention having seen their ad
vertisements in these publications.
This would show a concrete apprecia
tion of the support given these college
enterprises by the merchants who deal
with you squarely."
