# CHRISTIAN NATION IS BISHOP GAILOR'S THEME
## Peace Day Sermon in Memorial Church Apropos of World War. 
### 
Bishop Gailor preached in the Me
morial Church yesterday, taking as his
text: "For nation shall rise against
nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
and there shall he famines and pes
tilences and earthquakes in divers
places." He showed that from the be
ginning Christianity lias adapted itself
to nations whose specialties have giv
en it a characteristic interpretation.
Bishop Gailor then applied the text to
Peace Day, which was observed yester
day, and said in part:
"Today we are commemorating the
one hundredth year of peace between
the English-speaking nations of the
world.
"If any nation declares itself to be a
Christian nation, it must hold to its
ideals. National life affords opportu
nity for unselfish devotion; a Chris
tian nation must prove its faith by
service to mankind. That man is serv
ing God who unselfishly serves his
country. In order that our nation
may take its proper place, every Amer
ican mast feel a sense of individual
responsibility."
Chancellor Jordan read the Scrip
ture lesson, and Dr. Stillman read a
Peace Proclamation.
The choir sang Guonod's "Grant Us
Thy Peace," and the "Hallelujah Chor
us" from Handel's "Messiah."
