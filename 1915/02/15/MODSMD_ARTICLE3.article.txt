# RENO FIVE DEFEATS STANFORD QUINTET
## LOSS OF GAME TO NEVADA UNIVERSITY DROPS CARDINAL TO THIRD PLACE. 
### 
The Stanford basketball quintet
went down to defeat Lefore lie ag
gressive playing of the University of
•Nevada team Saturday night by a score
of 44 to 29, which dropped the stand
ing of the Cardinals from first to third
place in the Intercollegiate League
percentage column.
The Stanford five showed better
team work than in any previous game,
but were unable to combat the accu
rate basket-shooting carried through
so successfully from every point of
the court by the Sagebrush players.
The contest took place on a large
dance floor, a court of larger dimen
sions than any that the Stanford play
ers have used this year. The Ne
vadans opened hostilities, and kept in
the lead during the first half, which
ended 16 to 12 in their favor. At the
opening of the second half the Cardi
nals started with a spurt that tied the
score. Then followed a disastrous pe
riod, in which the Reno squad rolled
up points enough to make futile the
final stand of the Stanford players at
the end of the game.
Eight hundred people were present
to witness the victory of the Nevadans.
Referee Walker, of San Jose, officiated
as referee. The Stanford men were
treated hospitably by their opponents,
and praise very highly the courtesies
of the Nevada team.
The Cardinal line-up stood; Worthy
and Blodget, forwards; Dutton and
Wallace, centers; Reynolds. Dolan and
Caughey, guards. Nevada's team con
sisted of Sheev and Stewart, forwards;
Henningson and Hungry, centers; Mc-
Cubbin, Painter (captain), and Tra
bert, guards. The game was featured
by excellent team work, .rather than
by star playing by individuals.
The Stanford Seconds were deprived
of a game with the St. Ignatius 145-
pound squad in Encina Gymnasium by
the failure of the latter team to ap
pear. However, the Swallows say
they will play the schedule game some
day this week, possibly Tuesday even
ing.
