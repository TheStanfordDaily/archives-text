# NEW MEN CONTEST IN SATURDAY MEET
## MURRAY REGISTERS MARKS IN 160-YARD AND HIGH JUMP. 
### 
A well-packed track and a warm
spring sun combined to make success
ful the efforts of Coach Campbell's
proteges in gaining a brisk work-out
on the Stanford oval Saturday morn
ing. No records were broken, and,
with the exception of Feg Murray's
mark of 5 feet, 11 1-2 inches in the
high jump and 16.3 seconds in the 160-
yard dash, no exceptional times were
chalked up. However, improvement
was shown by several members of the
squad, both new and old, and the pos
sibility of filling in some of the weak
er places in the team looks encourag
ing.
It seems as if the two Aupperles
were to be entered in the mile. M.
Samis, '18, is making a close study of
the consistent pace set by the more
experienced Sophomore, and both
milers walked away from the crowd of
opponents at the finish of the three
lap race.
Clemmer Johnson, '18, and VV.right
Lynn, '17, came near to dividing hon
ors in their heat of the dash event, but
Johnson won by a scant four inches.
Two Freshmen, Keech and Wilson,
showed both staying and sprinting
qualities in the shortened two-mile
race, and took first in their respective
heats.
F. Schnell, '16, and L. Filley, '18,
won their heats of the 660-yard dash
by determined spurts at the finish.
Filley runs easily, but never faster
than is necessary to b.reak the tape. A
little competition promises to develop
him into a good half-miler.
