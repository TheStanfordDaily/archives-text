# STANFORD VARSITIES SPLIT DOUBLE-HEADER
## Olympic Club Nine Administers 5 to 1 Defeat SECOND TEAM WINS GAME Muddy Field at Recreation Park Responsible For Many Unearned Runs 
### 
In a wierd exhibition of baseball, the
Olympic Club nine annexed a muddy
5 to 1 victory over the Stanford Varsi
ty Saturday afternoon, at Recreation
Park, San Francisco, in a game for the
benefit of the Associated Charities. A
small crowd turned out to watch the
two teams perform. Owing to the poor
condition of the Coast League grounds,
fast play was impossible.
Fluke safeties were the order of the
day, and chiefly responsible for the six
runs scored. Hoever, who worked on
the mound four innings, was touched
up for seven bingles and four tallies.
Hayes finished the game, and held the
Redwings well in hand during his stay
in the box.
Stafford pulled off the fielding at
traction of the afternoon. In the sev
enth inning Brown, first packer of the
clubmen, who had been meeting the
ball right on the seam, knocked a
screeche.r towards right field. "Wob
bles" rtaade a leap into the air and
speared the pellet in his gloved hand.
The play brought him a round of ap
plause.
The Winged "O" aggregation started
to make trouble in the opening frame.
Andrade, first up, singled infield.
Erlin followed with a hit. The bases
were loaded when Brown drew a free
passage. On Swanton's sacrifice fly
to center, Andrade beat the peg home.
The second inning resulted in more
runs for the Olympic Club. Benn
gained first and Rippon followed with
a single past third. When Workman
mishandled Riordan's bunt, the bases
were again fully populated. After two
strike-outs, Tramutola buried the pel
let in the soft, swampy infield. Benn
scoring. Rippon tapped the plate,
when McCloskey made a wild throw
of sod and ball to first on Erlin's
grounder.
The Varsity annexed its lone tally in
the third inning. Day reached second
on Schammel's poor fielding of his
bunt. Captain Worgman brought him
home with a smashing drive to center.
In both the fourth and fifth rounds
the clubmen registered one run. Rip
pon, following a walk, scored on
Schammel's double. Later, Brown tal
lied on his two-bagger and Benn's
single. Goose eggs were chalked on
both sides during the remainder of the
game.
While the Varsity was receiving its
second defeat at the hands of the
Olympic Club. Stanford Second Varsity
evened up the day's double-header by
winning a tight game from the Santa
Clara second team. Since the Mission
ites missed their train, the contest was
not called until 4 o'clock. After seven
innings of play, the Cardinal nine
emerged victorious 5 to 4.
The majority of the runs scored dur
ing the game were of an unearned
nature, errors being frequent. Mul
ford and Weeks for Stanford, and
Cunningham for Santa Clara, eached
banged out a brace of hits. By shov
ing two tallies across the plate in the
final frame, the Second Varsity scored
a win out of a defeat.
