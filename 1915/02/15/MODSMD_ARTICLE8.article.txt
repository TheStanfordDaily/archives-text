# ROTH ENDS HIS FAST ON FIFTY-NINTH DAY
## PERIOD OF VOLUNTARY STARVATION BROKEN BY SPOONFUL OF ORANGE JUICE TODAY. 
### 
L. C. Roth ended his fast at nine
o'clock this morning, when he experi
enced the pangs of hunger and swal
lowed a teaspoonful of orange juice.
Today was the fifty-ninth day of his
voluntary starvation, and the sixtieth
day would have begun at two this af
ternoon. Roth drank just a little
more of the fruit juice at ten o'clock,
and planned to continue taking it ev
ery day throughout the day, gradually
increasing the dose each time.
Roth will break his fast entirely
with a fruit and vegetable diet. He
will eat orange juice today and to
morrow, then add a little apple or
banana to his diet, until he feels
that his digestive organs are prepared
for a light vegetable salad. He will
eat no flesh or cooked foods to rebuild
his wasted body.
Roth began his fast on December 17,
in order to cure a chronic digestive
disorder, due to overeating and abus
ing his system with an excess of rich
food. He began with the idea of ab
staining from all nourishment until
his system was entirely cleansed of
poisons by the process of elimination.
He confidently expected that by the
end of thirty days an uncoated tongue
and a return of natural hunger would
warn him that the time to break his
fast had arrived.
Roth's weight dropped from one hun
dred and thirty-five to eighty-four
pounds at the end of the fifty days, and
he became so weak that he could not
leave his bed. Yet, though unani
mously advised by alarmed friends to
oat before it was too late, the gritty
tailor persisted in his fast, saying that
fasting was the easiest thing in the
world.
On the thirty-ninth day the Stanford
Department of Chemistry became in
terested in his case, and began a series
of blood and excretory tests to deter
mine the change which organs under
go in the advanced stages of starva
tion.
From time to time during the past
week reports have been circulated to
the effect that Roth was either dead or
dying, but he has been resting easily,
and his only worry has been the host
of reporters and special correspond
ents who have besieged the Roth home.
Medical authorities have stated th.it
Roth's digestive organs are dead, and
that he will be unable to assimilate
any more food. Roth claims that he
will gain twenty pounds this week, and
will do some weight lifting in two
more days. Whatever the final out
come will be, Roth has proven that it
is exceedingly difficult for a man to
starve to death.
