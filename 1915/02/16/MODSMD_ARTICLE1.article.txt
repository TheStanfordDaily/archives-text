# PROSPECTS OF TENNIS VICTORY OVER BLUE AND GOLD LOOM BRIGHTLY
## VARSITY SQUAD IS NAMED Three Veterans Have Returned to Stanford and Several Freshmen Show to Advantage 
### 
Prospects for a victory over Califor
nia in tlic annual intercollegiate ten-

n's tournament to
be held April 1
and 2, the after
noon before and
the morning of
the second inter
collegiate base
ball game, in the
spring vacation,
are very bright.
Three of last
year's varsity vet
erans are back on
the courts and
several Freshmen
who have been
winners of past
interscholasti c s ,
or who come with
good reputations,

are out for work. Those on last year's
team who are practicing on the Enci
na courts arc Captain H. L. Hahn, 'Ifi,
L. Soss. '15, and K. B. Uhls, '10. J. S.
Hutchinson, '16, is in college and eligi
ble. but is prevented from competing
because of the pressure of outside
wo.rk.
In direct contrast with Stanford's
abundance of material, California has
lost three of her racqueters of last sea
son's varsity. V. Breeden, '14, gradu
ated: W. Davis, 'IG. did not return to
college, and H. Breck, '14, who was to
have captained the team, has gone to
Honolulu with Billy Johnson, the net
expert.
Negotiations for tournaments with
other colleges than California are un
der way. It is very probable that
practice matches with the University
of Southern California and with tho
strong local prep schools will be
scheduled.
In the past there has been no defi
nite system of try-outs, but this season
every member of the varsity squad will
be expected to practice at least three
times a week, according to a pre
arranged schedule to keep steadily at
it until the time of the final try-out
tournament. The varsity squad, which
consists of Captain H. L. Hahn, '10>, L.
Sloss, '1."). K. B. Uhls. 'Ifi, O. G. Brun,
'Ifi, S. Chapman, 'Ifi, A. Barber, '18, H.
V. 1). Johns, 'IS. and C. Wolford. '18,
•will betdn work immediately. All
others who wish to try-out must see
Captain Hahn. who will match them
with the lowest men on the squad.
The Thiele Cup tournament has not
been completed on account of the
rainy weather. Those still in the com
petition will be expected to see their
opponents and play off their matches
as soon as possible.
