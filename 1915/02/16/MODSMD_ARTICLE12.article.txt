# WOMEN STUDENTS WILL PROVIDE MENU FOR FOUNDERS' DAY BANQUET
## DANCE IN UNION PLANNED Club House Will Be Scene of Merrymaking at Conclusion of Public Exercises on March 9th 
### 
The Executive Committee of the
Alumni Association has decided to en
trust the matter of holding the Found
ers Day banquet to the .respective
Governing Boards of the Women's
Club House and the Stanford Union.
These two bodies will select a student
committee, consisting of both mep and
women, to supervise the actual ar
rangements.
It is expected that the dinner will
this year be given in the Women's
Cub House, which, it is thought, will
offer better facilities for holding such
an extensive affair than Encina Hall,
in whose club rooms the former ban
quets have taken place. The women
will take charge of providing the
menu, and the men of the committee
will arrange an informal program, to
follow the banquet, probably a dance
in the Stanford Union.
Many alumni living in San Francis
co and neighboring communities will
probably find it hard to attend the
banquet, as Founders' Day, March 9,
comes on a week night, and an auxil
iary dinner will be held in the city for
their convenience.
The two Governing Roards are
scheduled to meet this evening to
appoint the general committee, and
detailed arrangements will immediate
ly be made to further the success of
the Founders' Day banquet.
