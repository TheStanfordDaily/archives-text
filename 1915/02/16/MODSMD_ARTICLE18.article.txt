"To be sure, all promises do not
turn to disappointments. For that
reason I want to make just one my
self, and if I make It here and now
perhaps the occasion will help hold
me firmly to it.
"Gentlemen of the Board, permit
me to call your attention to a provi
sion printed on page 157 of the trus
tees' manual. It is here provided
'that the president of the University
shall annually present to the Board
of Trustees . . . the names of all
members of the teaching or executive
staff of the university who shall be
over 65 years of age on the first day
of the following academic year, with
the recommendations as to the retire
ment or retention of all such persons.'
"Here and now I beg to remind you
that I shall be 65 years of age in
July, 1915, and I recommend that I be
retired at the end of that academic
year."
Every member of the Student Body
remembers only too well the promise
Dr. John Casper Branner made in his
installation address October 1, 1913.
It is with sincere regret that we learn
Dr. Branner has fulfilled his promise
and that his resignation as President
of the University has been accepted,
to take effect on July 31, 1915.
During his brief period of adminis
tration its the executive head of the
University his untiring efforts have
been most fruitful. Dr. Branner has
constantly held in view the one idea
that each one should do all that hu
man effort can do to make Stanford
University known for sane, sound and
productive scholarship.
Progress and development have
been absolutely void of sensation.
Changes have been made along the
most practical lines. The spirit of
reasonableness has pervaded every
advancement.
Although Dr. Branner resigns as
President of the University it is sin
cerely hoped that he will not sever
his connections with the Faculty and
undergraduates. In his future scien
tific research work we wish him ev
ery success that has accompanied his
past achievements as a scientist,
scholar and executive head.
To fill the position left vacant is
the problem that confronts the Board
of Trustees. This, in itself, is not an
easy task, and to secure a president

with the ability, initiative and exper
ience requisite to the maintenance of
the present high standard offers a
much more weighty problem.
