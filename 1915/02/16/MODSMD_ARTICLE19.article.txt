# INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS

(Professor John D. Gray delivered
the remarks printed below before
the University of Minnesota, January
12, 1915, and they were later printed in
the Minnesota Alumni Weekly, Janu
ary 19, 1915. Mr. Gray is professor of
economics at the University of Minne
sota. The article will be continued
through three issues of this paper).
Conclusion
I have recently seen the great stadia
at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.
When we have undergone a necessary
and wholesome reaction, I have no
doubt that these will be considered
colossal monuments to folly, and the
greatest drawback to a proper athletic
spirit for the development of that heal
thy, physical powe.r and skill which
ought to dominate the whole student
body. We need at this University
greatly enlarged opportunities for
physical exercise with adequate med
ical examination and guidance, but no
professional coach. In my judgment,
it would be a good thing if allintercol
leg'ate games were abolished, if the
stadia and athletic field fences were
dynamited, and admission fees and
training coaches were done away with.
Then if the university would spend a
tithe of the money in building golf
courses, tennis courts, and facilities
for other real sports, and do what they
could to develop, each on its own cam
pus and among its students only dif
ferent football and baseball teams and
contests, we might revert to the whole
some attitude toward athletics which
was proclaimed by Amherst, half a
century ago.
It would seem to me an opportune
time to call attention to these needs,
in so much as it is ardently hoped and
believed that when the high dam in the
Mississippi is completed, we shall have
excellent opportunities for rowing and
skating, two of the most wholesome
and exhilarating sports in the world —
sports which ought never to be turned
over to the professionals in any uni
versity.
Nor should I be willing to close these
remarks without some reference to our
local conditions. I question very seri
ously whether the great state universi
ties, depending upon legislative gene
rosity to meet their ever increasing
needs, will long permit so clear a de
parture from proper educational ideals
and standards as is indicated by the
vast crowds brought together and pay
ing eno.rmous admission fees, all as a
result of the professional training and
official coaching of our teams.

If education is to be successful we
must educate the whole being. What
ever the philosophical relation of the
body to the mind may be, all educators
know today that the growing complex
ity of modern life is adding daily to the
strain, and, that a well-rounded phys
ical development enhances immensely
one's chances of success in life, and,
also, adds greatly to the joy of living.
Hence physical education becomes
supplementary to intellectual, and, in
fact, quite as important. Therefore,
every university is as much justified
in spending money for the develop
ment of tlie bodies of its students as
for any of the more traditional pur
poses.
What we need s sport, and the op
portunities for play, physical recrea
tion. and health. Such conditions would
soon make it impossible for the fresh
man to believe that he is a great ath
lete and a mainstay of athletics be
cause he pays admission fees to pro
fessional exhibitions, s"ts 011 a seat and
engages in ill-timed and vulgar cheer
ing. If young men are according to
scripture to rejoice in their strength
they cannot do athletics by proxy.
So long as all the available land,
money and facilities, are reserved lor
pugiPstic, professional exhibitions, we
cannot hope for that respect for or in
terest in play, exercise, and physical
development which alone justify an
athletic department in a university.
Many other evils might be mentioned
in connection with what are called the
major intercollegiate athletics, such as
inducing men to come to the university
to enter these teams —paying such
men, and the like —moral, if not tech
nical violation of the rules. But if no
rule were ever evaded or violated, the
games would still remain wholly pro
fessional in aim, methods and results.
Such professionalism is inconsistent
with high and worthy university aims
and ideals, and differ in no vital, or
essential, element from the profes
sional major league baeball games. We
shall never come back to the lofty
ideals of a sane and vigorous mind in
a sound body until we lop off our pro
fessional teams, with all their para
phernalia of training tables, prison
wall fences, private practice, profes
sional coaches, and high admission
fees. All these devices aim primarily
at technical professional skill, trained
to the highest possible point, with but
one aim in view,—victory.

in connection with what are called the

Conclusion
I have recently seen the great stadia
at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.
When we have undergone a necessary
and wholesome reaction, I have no
doubt that these will be considered
colossal monuments to folly, and the
greatest drawback to a proper athletic
spirit for the development of that heal
thy, physical powe.r and skill which
ought to dominate the whole student
body. We need at this University
greatly enlarged opportunities for
physical exercise with adequate med
ical examination and guidance, but no
professional coach. In my judgment,
it would be a good thing if allintercol
leg'ate games were abolished, if the
stadia and athletic field fences were
dynamited, and admission fees and
training coaches were done away with.
Then if the university would spend a
tithe of the money in building golf
courses, tennis courts, and facilities
for other real sports, and do what they
could to develop, each on its own cam
pus and among its students only dif
ferent football and baseball teams and
contests, we might revert to the whole
some attitude toward athletics which
was proclaimed by Amherst, half a
century ago.
It would seem to me an opportune
time to call attention to these needs,
in so much as it is ardently hoped and
believed that when the high dam in the
Mississippi is completed, we shall have
excellent opportunities for rowing and
skating, two of the most wholesome
and exhilarating sports in the world —
sports which ought never to be turned
over to the professionals in any uni
versity.
Nor should I be willing to close these
remarks without some reference to our
local conditions. I question very seri
ously whether the great state universi
ties, depending upon legislative gene
rosity to meet their ever increasing
needs, will long permit so clear a de
parture from proper educational ideals
and standards as is indicated by the
vast crowds brought together and pay
ing eno.rmous admission fees, all as a
result of the professional training and
official coaching of our teams.

If education is to be successful we
must educate the whole being. What
ever the philosophical relation of the
body to the mind may be, all educators
know today that the growing complex
ity of modern life is adding daily to the
strain, and, that a well-rounded phys
ical development enhances immensely
one's chances of success in life, and,
also, adds greatly to the joy of living.
Hence physical education becomes
supplementary to intellectual, and, in
fact, quite as important. Therefore,
every university is as much justified
in spending money for the develop
ment of tlie bodies of its students as
for any of the more traditional pur
poses.
What we need s sport, and the op
portunities for play, physical recrea
tion. and health. Such conditions would
soon make it impossible for the fresh
man to believe that he is a great ath
lete and a mainstay of athletics be
cause he pays admission fees to pro
fessional exhibitions, s"ts 011 a seat and
engages in ill-timed and vulgar cheer
ing. If young men are according to
scripture to rejoice in their strength
they cannot do athletics by proxy.
So long as all the available land,
money and facilities, are reserved lor
pugiPstic, professional exhibitions, we
cannot hope for that respect for or in
terest in play, exercise, and physical
development which alone justify an
athletic department in a university.
