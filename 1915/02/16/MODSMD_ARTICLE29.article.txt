# POOR SEEK HAPPINESS AT HEALTH FOUNTAIN
## Medical Assistance Given to Sick For Asking—Cripples Kept From Ranks of Useless 
### 
Imagine a low-ceilinged room twen
ty by forty feet, with tiers of seats ar
ranged so that upon first impression
you are reminded of a mov'ng picture
theatre. Imagine a condition that is
best known as standing room only. At
one end of the room picture a black
board with painted instructions, office
hours, and rules that must be followed
to enable the pilgrims to the fountain
of health to find relief.
Fountain of health! Pilgrims! Per
haps you will understand better when
it is said that they who fill every seat
and stand around wa ting are the poor
of San Francisco—the sick and crip
pled pcor, hopeful cf seeking health
and happiness at the gates of the Stan
ford clinic —good Samaritan institu
tion. The pour, was it said? Hardly
that! A mere iota of the poor—a thou
sandth of them. At the rate of four
hundred a day they come, ask for aid
cr information, and go away encour
aged, and in gratitude for what was
g'ven them. Perhaps they depart dis
couraged to feel that their lot in the
world is but to wait and count the
days before the last one. For there
are many who come already in the
clutches of that ever-ready custodian,
whose grip often proves him master
over the powers of man.
Stand in the low-ceilinged room for
an hour, or, bstte.r still, sit down and
wait. Watch the faces of those enter
ins? and of those departing. A ten
year-old thumps in on crutches, one
leg hanging limply, the other, per
haps, in a plaster cast. He takes a
seat, and waits —. He has been wait
ing for ten years. If he were older he
might realize that he would always be
waiting, unless the orthopedic clinic
can help him. Next to him you might
see a young man, who, at first glance,
appears to be blessed with health. But
watch him: note his nervous move
ment; he has spent years in worry. He
glances at the clock now and then; he
cannot take much t'me to attend to his
health, for the job he holds is like the
ball he is pushing up hill. Let it alone
for a second and away it goes.
They are but two of many. You can
see them all; the old men and women,
thin and haggard. And the
youngsters, thin and haggard, per
haps crippled—sentenced for life—
unless! They come in. file their appli
cations, and await their turn to be
sent to one of the clinics, for treat
ment, or to the hospital.
That is the work of the Stanford
clinic in San Francisco, which, with
Lane Hospital, Lane Medical Library,
Lane Nurses' Home, and other build
ings, form the nucleus of the Lane
Medical School.
What proportion of Stanford men
and women are aware of the mere fact
of its existence?
That branch of the University
known as the Orthopedic Clinic is per
forming a work under the direction of
D.r. Leonard W. Ely that has been un
dertaken in few places in the world. —
the care and the cure of the crippled
poor. Dr. Ely believes that there
should be no half-way with the crip
ple. One extreme is that of the an
cients, who k'lled their cripples
(whom they believed were cursed by
God) to get them out of the way. The
other extreme is to care for them, to
cure where possible. It is not enougn,
the man in charge of this work main
tains, to equip the cripple so he can
set about —the problem is to make him
feel that he is not a burden upon so
ciety, that he is not useless in the
world. The vital problem is to pro
vide education for the cripple, and
then to find him occupations in which
he can be efficient. There are many
such occupations. Hut there is little
done by society to meet this issue.
London is far ahead of any city—she
almost stands alone —in this respect.
London provided over 70 omnibuses
and other vclrclns that are used to
take crippled children to and from
school. San Francisco eares for its
poor, and its sick. Hut the cripple—

how to remove him from his position as
a burden upon society—is a problem
that seems too large for the present
generation.
The Stanford Orthopedic Clinic is
taking steps in that direction to cure
the cripple, who, on account of lack of
fin r.icial aid. would otherwise be
forced to take a position in the ranks
of the useless.

of the useless.
Imagine a low-ceilinged room twen
ty by forty feet, with tiers of seats ar
ranged so that upon first impression
you are reminded of a mov'ng picture
theatre. Imagine a condition that is
best known as standing room only. At
one end of the room picture a black
board with painted instructions, office
hours, and rules that must be followed
to enable the pilgrims to the fountain
of health to find relief.
Fountain of health! Pilgrims! Per
haps you will understand better when
it is said that they who fill every seat
and stand around wa ting are the poor
of San Francisco—the sick and crip
pled pcor, hopeful cf seeking health
and happiness at the gates of the Stan
ford clinic —good Samaritan institu
tion. The pour, was it said? Hardly
that! A mere iota of the poor—a thou
sandth of them. At the rate of four
hundred a day they come, ask for aid
cr information, and go away encour
aged, and in gratitude for what was
g'ven them. Perhaps they depart dis
couraged to feel that their lot in the
world is but to wait and count the
days before the last one. For there
are many who come already in the
clutches of that ever-ready custodian,
whose grip often proves him master
over the powers of man.
Stand in the low-ceilinged room for
an hour, or, bstte.r still, sit down and
wait. Watch the faces of those enter
ins? and of those departing. A ten
year-old thumps in on crutches, one
leg hanging limply, the other, per
haps, in a plaster cast. He takes a
seat, and waits —. He has been wait
ing for ten years. If he were older he
might realize that he would always be
waiting, unless the orthopedic clinic
can help him. Next to him you might
see a young man, who, at first glance,
appears to be blessed with health. But
watch him: note his nervous move
ment; he has spent years in worry. He
glances at the clock now and then; he
cannot take much t'me to attend to his
health, for the job he holds is like the
ball he is pushing up hill. Let it alone
for a second and away it goes.
They are but two of many. You can
see them all; the old men and women,
thin and haggard. And the
youngsters, thin and haggard, per
haps crippled—sentenced for life—
unless! They come in. file their appli
cations, and await their turn to be
sent to one of the clinics, for treat
ment, or to the hospital.
That is the work of the Stanford
clinic in San Francisco, which, with
Lane Hospital, Lane Medical Library,
Lane Nurses' Home, and other build
ings, form the nucleus of the Lane
Medical School.
What proportion of Stanford men
and women are aware of the mere fact
of its existence?
That branch of the University
known as the Orthopedic Clinic is per
forming a work under the direction of
D.r. Leonard W. Ely that has been un
dertaken in few places in the world. —
the care and the cure of the crippled
poor. Dr. Ely believes that there
should be no half-way with the crip
ple. One extreme is that of the an
cients, who k'lled their cripples
(whom they believed were cursed by
God) to get them out of the way. The
other extreme is to care for them, to
cure where possible. It is not enougn,
the man in charge of this work main
tains, to equip the cripple so he can
set about —the problem is to make him
feel that he is not a burden upon so
ciety, that he is not useless in the
world. The vital problem is to pro
vide education for the cripple, and
then to find him occupations in which
he can be efficient. There are many
such occupations. Hut there is little
done by society to meet this issue.
London is far ahead of any city—she
almost stands alone —in this respect.
London provided over 70 omnibuses
and other vclrclns that are used to
take crippled children to and from
school. San Francisco eares for its
poor, and its sick. Hut the cripple—

how to remove him from his position as
a burden upon society—is a problem
that seems too large for the present
generation.
The Stanford Orthopedic Clinic is
