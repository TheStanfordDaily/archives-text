# MUTATIONAL MOVIE FIRM HEADED BY STANFORD MEN
## Scientific Research Workers Expect Films to Fill Long-Felt Want. 
### 
Stanford men were elected to exec
utive offices of the Exactus Photo
Film Corporation at the recent stock
holders' meeting. H. C. Peterson, cu
rator of the Stanford museum, was
reelected vice-president of the local
movie-producing concern. Professor
W. F. Durand, head of the Mechanical
Engineering department was chosen a
member of the reorganized board of
directors. G. C. Miller, ex-'Ol, mana
ger of the Stanford Bookstore, was
named as assistant secretary.
H. D. Hart of San Jose is the new
president and general manager of the
company.
Professor Durand expressed his be
lief that the products of the local
film-making establishment would fill
a long felt want of scientific research
workers. Phenomena of rapidly mov
ing objects which the naked eye is
not able to trace can be studied with
the aid of a rapid-shutter, moving
picture camera.
At present, camera men of the com
pany are engaged in the southern
part of the state in taking four thou
sand feet of film showing the develop
ment of the California county library
system, which will constitute the ex
hibit of the California Library Asso
ciation at the Fair.
A film is to be made at the Belmont
School, portraying student life at that
institution.
