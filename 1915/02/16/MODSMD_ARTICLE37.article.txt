represents the ripened product of the
genius of that composer, George Fred
erick Handel, and reflects the noblest
aspirations and most exalted devotion
of mankind. Among all his oratorios,
and he is the leader of oratorio writ
ers, it retains its original freshness,
vigor, and beauty in the highest de

parts. The first illustrates the long
ing of the world for the Messiah,
prophesies his coming, and announces
his birth. The second part is devoted
to the sufferings, death and exaltation

the memory of the composer, an im
perishable record of the noblest sen
timents of human nature and the
highest aspirations of man.
