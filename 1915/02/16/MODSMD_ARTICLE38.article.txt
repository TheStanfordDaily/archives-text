# CYPRESS TREES WILL NOT PROVE MENACE TO LIGHT
## Slow Growth and Variety Selected Place Possible Interference Far in the Future.

Who has not heard the question:
"Will the cypress trees recently plant
ed about the University buildings,
shade the class room windows after a
year's growth?" An explanation of
the characteristics of the particular
variety of cypress planted will answer
the question.
From a possible fifteen varieties, the
one chosen is that common to South
ern Europe; it is a phase of Italian
scenery. Although in its native land
the tree reaches a height, in some in
stances, of one hundred and twenty
feet, the highest in this country do
not exceed eighty feet. This, of course,
is only under ideal conditions. In
England the average growth in a year
does not exceed one and one-half feet.
With the trees retarded by transplant
ing, it is hardly expected that many
class rooms will be lost in darkness
for some time to come.
To those who look far into the fu
ture, there may still be doubt. In the
course of two thousand years the fa
mous cypress at Somma, Italy, at
tained a height of one hundred and
twenty feeet with a circumference at
the base of twenty-three feeet. Esti
mating the endurance of the present
University buildings at four hundred
years, it would not be possible to im
agine the cypress strees in existence
some fifteen hundred years after the
decay of the buildings.
