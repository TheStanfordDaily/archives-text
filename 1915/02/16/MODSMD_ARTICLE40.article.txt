### 
From the strikingly artistic cover of
F. S. Murray, '16, to the brilliant re
view of "Pillars of Society," by H. M.
Levy, '16, the Late Valentine "Chap
paral," which will apnear on the Quad
tomorrow, is replete with novel fea
tures from both pen and brush. Mur
ray's cover is a brown and white study
of an attractive girl in Chappie's bor
rowed raiment, furnishing a pleasing
hint of the zest, which characterizes
the entire issue.
Editor Milt Hagen,'15,treats of several
pertinent topics in his "Now Thats."
He comments on the current number;
Chappie advertisers; the 1917 Quad;
senior honor cards; and the success
ful opening of the Stanford Union.
The mysterious H. A. C., 06, who has
succeeded in keeping his personality
a secret in spite of numerous guesses
in regard to his identity, contributes
the Dilettante, in which he relates in
effervescent fashion one of his adven
tures with the gentler sex.
"Hands Up" is the startling caption of
another page of mystery verses which
represent a decided departure in Chap
pie material, as well as an anonymous
contribution of merit.
Miss Dorothy Egbert, '16, decorates
a page with an artistic sketch reflect
ing decided originality and skill. The
attractive figure suggests Adeline
Genee in its grace and style and ac
companies a verse of R. F. Eberhart,
'17.
"My Valentine," the front page poem,
is treated in a novel manner by H. M
Levy, '16, while facing the verses is ail
amusing black and white sketch by J
M. Wallace, '17, entitled "Puppy Love.'
The frontispiece by R. W. Borough, '01,
pictures "The Same Old Story," a Val
entine .rhyme, by L. W. Warren, '17.
who also contributes a sentimental
love song, "The Mormon's Valentine."
Society columns are another new
feature in which Chappie chatters
about the social world in his own in
imitable way. "Bouquets and Bri
quettes" and H. M. Levy's re
view of the recent Masquer's' produc
tion complete the issue. The latter
treatment of "Pillars of Society" has
the real "magazine" flavor, and 5s
amusing as well as as characteristic.
Additional art work, verse, and joke
features are the work of Paul Levy.
