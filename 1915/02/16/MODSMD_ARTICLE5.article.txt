# St. Marys Scheduled to Oppose Varsity Tomorrow
## Hayes Will Serve Up Twisters to Mission Batsmenâ€”Rain Is Predicted. 
### 
If granted favorable weather condi
tions, St. Mary's will provide midweek
competition for the Stanford Varsity
tomorrow afternoon. The Oakland
collegians were scheduled to make
two appearances heretofore on the
campus, January 13 and February 3,
but rain caused both games to ne
called off.
The local diamond, by means of its
excellent drainage system, may be put
into shape after a storm inside of
twelve hours. A statement by the
government weather forecaster pre
dicts rain for tomorrow. In case the
sun should shine, Umpire Heine Spen
cer will call for the first batter
promptly at four-fifteen.
Few changes will be noticeable in
the Cardinal line-up. Hayes, who
worked five innings against the Olym
pic Club last Saturday and allowed
them only one run while on the
mound, will assume .the pitching du
ties. Hoever may relieve later in the
game. Dent win act as backstop.
The infield is the same as has been
used in the past two games. Captain
Workman will cover first base; Staf
ford will work around the keystone
cushion; Stevens will hold down
short, while the veteran McCloskey is
to handle third base.
The personnel of the outfield posi
tions is not to be announced until it
is known whether St. Mary's will use
a right or left handed boxman. Day
is to play the entire game regardless
of the pitcher, while Noonan and
O'Neill are to bat against a right
hander, and Austin and Downing will
face a southpaw.
