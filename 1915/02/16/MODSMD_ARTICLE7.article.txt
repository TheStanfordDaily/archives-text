In accordance with the request of
the Women's Conference, dinner win

houses, but a basket supper will be
held at the club house.
The invitation is extended to facul
ty women, alumnae, and all others in

d ■ d of the University. Everyone

basket. Coffee will be served.
A musical program will follow sup

dents who have been prominent in the
club house movement during the
years of its growth.
The new 35,000 square feet of birch
floor will be dedicated at an informal
dance following the program.
Thursday night has been termed a

"night of rejoicing" over the comple
tion of thai, which has for so long
been the ideal of Stanford women.
The urgent need of a meeting place
for undergraduates, faculty members
and alumnae will have been met.
Mr. Hoover's statement that "the
Union will do its greatest work for
the campus by renewing the old Stan
ford spirit of democracy" is equally
true of the clubhouse.
Through the clubhouse every
woman in the University may feel
that she has an active part in the
affairs of the community—that she is,
in a sense, responsible for this "on«
great enterprise of Stanford women."
