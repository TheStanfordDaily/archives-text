# DOCTOR CALLED TO AID ROTH
## Pulse of Fasting Tailor Is Nearly Extinct. 
### 
Dr. L. E. Phillips of Palo Alto was
called at midnight to the bedside of
Louis C. Roth, the Palo Alto tailor
who abstained from food for fifty-nine
days before breaking his fast, to ren
der him medical aid.
He found Roth almost pulseless,
and experiencing burning pains in
his stomach. Roth had consumed no
thing but orange juice diluted in wa
ter since breaking his fast.
The calling of a physician into the
case comes as a distinct surprise,
Roth having professed a disbelief in
the efficacy of medicinal or allopathic
treatment.
