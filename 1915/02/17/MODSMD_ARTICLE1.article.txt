Coach Campbell's Charges Will
Compete Against Combined
Athletic Strength of Stars of
the Two Southern Institutions
TEAM IS WELL BALANCED
The Cardinal track squad will com
pete with a combined aggregation of
picked stars from the College ol' Occi
dental and Pomona on the morning of
Friday, March 213, which is catalogued
on th University calendar as Junior
Day. Graduate Manager It. W. Wilcox,
'13, has been negotiating for the date
for over a month, and has finally se
cured the event as one of the chief at
tractions of Junior Week.
r ilie combined college team has al
ways furnished considerable competi
tion for the Varsity. This year the
Po.iioua freshmen are especially
strong, numbering in their ranks, Ber
ry, formerly of Redlands, who estab
lished a world's interscholastic record
of 4 minutes -6 2-5 seconds at Stan
ford last year; Bruce Wallace, who is
goi d tor a consistent u2 seconds in the
440-yard dash; Dickenson, who has
topped 11 feet, G inches in the pole
vault; and Paul Anderson, who has a
record of <5 feet, 1 inch in the high
jump. Ed. Stone and Ray Atkinson,
both Pomona freshmen, are credited
with 10 seconds flat in the century,
and the latter has also covered the
in le .run in 4 minutes and 30 seconds.
Of the old men, (livens. Green, and
Clay will probably take care of the
dashes. Larry Gillette, the renowned
Pomona sprinter, has left a big hole in
this department by his graduation.
Captain La Follette is the only 880
man of note, having registered a mark
of 2 minutes, 2 seconds. The Sturgis
brothers are back to compete in the
mile and two-mile runs.
Several veterans will wear the Occi
dental colors on the combined team.
Among them are Annan, who has com
peted before on the Stanford track in
the mile and half-mile run; Cook, who
runs a very consistent race in the 440-
yard dash; Shipke, whose perform
ances in the weight events has been
the subject of favorable comment; and
Creighton, entered in the high jump
event. The squad has sustained a se
vere loss in the graduation of Kirkpat
rick, who ranks as one of the premier
low hurdlers in Coast competition.
Critics also sive Occidental strong
.ranking on college track lists, and the
combination of the two teams should
tighten up the meet to a considerable
degree. The performance of the ath
letes who will visit the campus are by
words in the South, and the Stanford
Varsity will be forced to extend itself
to take the honors.

Coach Campbell's Charges Will
Compete Against Combined
Athletic Strength of Stars of
the Two Southern Institutions
TEAM IS WELL BALANCED
The Cardinal track squad will com
pete with a combined aggregation of
picked stars from the College ol' Occi
dental and Pomona on the morning of
Friday, March 213, which is catalogued
on th University calendar as Junior
Day. Graduate Manager It. W. Wilcox,
'13, has been negotiating for the date
for over a month, and has finally se
cured the event as one of the chief at
tractions of Junior Week.
r ilie combined college team has al
ways furnished considerable competi
tion for the Varsity. This year the
Po.iioua freshmen are especially
strong, numbering in their ranks, Ber
ry, formerly of Redlands, who estab
lished a world's interscholastic record
of 4 minutes -6 2-5 seconds at Stan
ford last year; Bruce Wallace, who is
goi d tor a consistent u2 seconds in the
440-yard dash; Dickenson, who has
topped 11 feet, G inches in the pole
vault; and Paul Anderson, who has a
record of <5 feet, 1 inch in the high
jump. Ed. Stone and Ray Atkinson,
both Pomona freshmen, are credited
with 10 seconds flat in the century,
and the latter has also covered the
in le .run in 4 minutes and 30 seconds.
Of the old men, (livens. Green, and
Clay will probably take care of the
dashes. Larry Gillette, the renowned
Pomona sprinter, has left a big hole in
this department by his graduation.
Captain La Follette is the only 880
man of note, having registered a mark
of 2 minutes, 2 seconds. The Sturgis
brothers are back to compete in the
mile and two-mile runs.
Several veterans will wear the Occi
dental colors on the combined team.
Among them are Annan, who has com
peted before on the Stanford track in
the mile and half-mile run; Cook, who
runs a very consistent race in the 440-
yard dash; Shipke, whose perform
ances in the weight events has been
the subject of favorable comment; and
Creighton, entered in the high jump
event. The squad has sustained a se
vere loss in the graduation of Kirkpat
rick, who ranks as one of the premier
low hurdlers in Coast competition.
Critics also sive Occidental strong
