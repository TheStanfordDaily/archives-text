It is with a commingled feeling of
complete surprise and sincere regret
that we received the announcement
that the Memorial Statue is to be re
moved from the Memorial Court. The
Statue was erected by Mrs. Stanford,
and stands to the memory of the don
ors of the University, and him for
whom the University is named.
Before the contemplated removal is
actually undertaken it would be well
to consider salient reasons why the
same o.r a similar statue should grace
the Memorial Court; also the interests
affected by the proposed removal.
First, it seems altogether appropriate
for the University to set aside a Me
morial Court. It is a fitting tribute
to the memory of those who have made
this University possible.
Second, the authorities of the Uni
versity realized the appropriateness
of a memorial court, and established
the same. To the Faculty, alumni, and
students the Memorial Court is as
much a part of the University plan as
the Quadrangle itself.
Third, since it is appropriate to have
a memorial court, and since the fact
we have a court so designated, the
only question is as to the appropriate
ness of a Memorial Statue therein. We
believe that a memorial statue is alto
gether in keeping with a memorial
court. It seems quite consistent with
a court set aside out of respect for,
and n memory of, the donors of the
University to have a statute of the
Stanford family placed therein.
To the Stanford Faculty, students,
and alumni, and especially to tti*,
friends of the University, the Me
morial Statue means much. It is more
than a tradition; it is a tribute to the
founders, whom they love. True, it
may ba a matter of sentiment with
them, but sentiment is not to be re
garded lightly.
It. has been suggested that the re
moval has been thought advisable be
cause of disintegration of the statue.
If the Statue is not of the proper ma
terial, or even if its sculptural lines
are not of the most modern and pleas
ing type, it would be altogether pos
sible, and certainly advisable, to re
place the present Statue with one of
different material, and, possibly, dif
ferent design. The essential thing is
that we shall have some statue erect
ed to the memory of the Founders
within Memorial Court.
Sinee the interests of many people

are involved it is to be hoped that the
Hoard of Trustees will take no finfl
steps until they have sounded public
sentiment and know in some measure
the feeling of those whose Interests
are concerned. Active co-operation be
tween the Hoard of Trustees and the
several factions of the University, in
cluding the friends of the University,
will be conducive to harmony, and a
united effort for the general progress
of the institution.

place the present Statue with one of
different material, and, possibly, dif
ferent design. The essential thing is
that we shall have some statue erect
ed to the memory of the Founders
within Memorial Court.
Sinee the interests of many people

are involved it is to be hoped that the
Hoard of Trustees will take no finfl
steps until they have sounded public
sentiment and know in some measure
the feeling of those whose Interests
are concerned. Active co-operation be
tween the Hoard of Trustees and the
several factions of the University, in
cluding the friends of the University,
will be conducive to harmony, and a
united effort for the general progress
of the institution.
It is with a commingled feeling of
complete surprise and sincere regret
that we received the announcement
that the Memorial Statue is to be re
moved from the Memorial Court. The
Statue was erected by Mrs. Stanford,
and stands to the memory of the don
ors of the University, and him for
whom the University is named.
Before the contemplated removal is
actually undertaken it would be well
to consider salient reasons why the
same o.r a similar statue should grace
the Memorial Court; also the interests
affected by the proposed removal.
First, it seems altogether appropriate
for the University to set aside a Me
morial Court. It is a fitting tribute
to the memory of those who have made
this University possible.
Second, the authorities of the Uni
versity realized the appropriateness
of a memorial court, and established
the same. To the Faculty, alumni, and
students the Memorial Court is as
much a part of the University plan as
the Quadrangle itself.
Third, since it is appropriate to have
a memorial court, and since the fact
we have a court so designated, the
only question is as to the appropriate
ness of a Memorial Statue therein. We
believe that a memorial statue is alto
gether in keeping with a memorial
court. It seems quite consistent with
a court set aside out of respect for,
and n memory of, the donors of the
University to have a statute of the
Stanford family placed therein.
To the Stanford Faculty, students,
and alumni, and especially to tti*,
friends of the University, the Me
morial Statue means much. It is more
than a tradition; it is a tribute to the
founders, whom they love. True, it
may ba a matter of sentiment with
them, but sentiment is not to be re
garded lightly.
It. has been suggested that the re
moval has been thought advisable be
cause of disintegration of the statue.
If the Statue is not of the proper ma
terial, or even if its sculptural lines
are not of the most modern and pleas
ing type, it would be altogether pos
sible, and certainly advisable, to re
place the present Statue with one of
different material, and, possibly, dif
ferent design. The essential thing is
that we shall have some statue erect
ed to the memory of the Founders
within Memorial Court.
Sinee the interests of many people

are involved it is to be hoped that the
Hoard of Trustees will take no finfl
steps until they have sounded public
sentiment and know in some measure
the feeling of those whose Interests
are concerned. Active co-operation be
tween the Hoard of Trustees and the
several factions of the University, in

will be conducive to harmony, and a

of the institution.
