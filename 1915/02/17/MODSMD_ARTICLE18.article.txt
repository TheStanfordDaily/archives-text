# A 						Century of Peace
## 
### Professor E.B. Krehbiel 
It is a hundred years today that the
Senate ratified the treaty signed by
our envoys at Ghent on Christmas Eve,
IS 14. Since that time the United
States and Great Britain, as was to be
expected from the contiguity of their
possessions, and their over-lapping in
terests in many parts of the world,
have often had differences. The
friendliness of the British for the Con
federacy, the aid extended that cause
through the Alabama and similar ves
sels, the various boundary questions,
the Monroe Doctrine, especially in the
Venezuela affair, the Panama tolls
controversy, these are a few, though
the most trying strains that have been
put upon the friendship of the tw j
nations. Though any of these might
have led to war—many a lesser griev
ance has provoked war in other quar
ters —peace has been maintained. It
is an achievement of true significance,
and one which should not be ignored.
For some reason men think of the
past in terms of war. History has fea
tured wars; they furnish mo.re materi
al for the pen than does a work-a-day
existence, they make a more entertain
ing narrative, and, therefore, more
saleable reading matter. Every one
knows of Napoleon's military exploits
and creations, not one of which sur
vived; only the occasional person
knows of his legal and administrative
institutions, many of which endure to
this hour. The deadly routine of the
farmer or laborer's life is not enter
taining, and it does not get into his
tories; but it is more vital to the na
tion than the widely celebrated ex
ploits of the battlefield. "The cour
age of the commonplace is greater
than the courage of the crisis," only
it does not make interesting reading,
and is eclipsed by the sensational.

History Is in a large, though happily
decreasing, measure a record of past
sensations.
The result is that we give the wars
of the past a place they did not ac
tually hold, and that our judgment of
the past, resting as it does on error, is
not correct. Nothing illustrates this
better than the common sentiment thai
we shall always have war because we
have always had it. Even if this be
granted the core of the matter has not
been reached. The real heart of the
case is whether war and peace have
continually played the same role in
relation to each other; or whether
their relation has changed.
There is no doubt that martial force j
plays less of a part in present than !
in past life. Indeed civilization, —as !
has been demonstrated so conspicious- |
ly in the expressions regarding the
European war, —is measured by the
degree to which it replaces force with
law. In former times war was peren
nial; today war is abnormal and peace
is normal. The Hundred Years' War
of the Middle Age is supplanted by the
Hundred Years' Peace.
It is just this change in the role of
war that the Peace Centenary seeks to
emphasize. It would make men pause
to compare the unfortified Canadian
frontier and undefended Great Lakes,
with the fortified boundaries of the
fleet-ridden seas of the Old World; '
it would applaud the emancipation of
our continent from militarism; it
would acclaim the prosperity which
has come from unbroken trade rela
tions; and it would celebrate the bles
sings which have sprung from the j
routine labor of obscure representa
tives of two great peoples who have
maintained a commonplace peace for j
a century.

past in terms of war. History has fea
tured wars; they furnish mo.re materi
al for the pen than does a work-a-day
existence, they make a more entertain
ing narrative, and, therefore, more
saleable reading matter. Every one
knows of Napoleon's military exploits
and creations, not one of which sur
vived; only the occasional person
knows of his legal and administrative
institutions, many of which endure to
this hour. The deadly routine of the
farmer or laborer's life is not enter
taining, and it does not get into his
tories; but it is more vital to the na
tion than the widely celebrated ex
ploits of the battlefield. "The cour
age of the commonplace is greater
than the courage of the crisis," only
it does not make interesting reading,
and is eclipsed by the sensational.

History Is in a large, though happily
decreasing, measure a record of past
sensations.
The result is that we give the wars
of the past a place they did not ac
tually hold, and that our judgment of
the past, resting as it does on error, is
not correct. Nothing illustrates this
better than the common sentiment thai
we shall always have war because we
have always had it. Even if this be
granted the core of the matter has not
been reached. The real heart of the
case is whether war and peace have
continually played the same role in
relation to each other; or whether
their relation has changed.
There is no doubt that martial force j
plays less of a part in present than !
in past life. Indeed civilization, —as !
has been demonstrated so conspicious- |
ly in the expressions regarding the
European war, —is measured by the
degree to which it replaces force with
law. In former times war was peren
nial; today war is abnormal and peace
is normal. The Hundred Years' War
of the Middle Age is supplanted by the
Hundred Years' Peace.
It is just this change in the role of
war that the Peace Centenary seeks to
emphasize. It would make men pause
to compare the unfortified Canadian
frontier and undefended Great Lakes,
with the fortified boundaries of the
fleet-ridden seas of the Old World; '
it would applaud the emancipation of
our continent from militarism; it
would acclaim the prosperity which
has come from unbroken trade rela
tions; and it would celebrate the bles
sings which have sprung from the j
routine labor of obscure representa
tives of two great peoples who have
maintained a commonplace peace for j
a century.
It is a hundred years today that the
Senate ratified the treaty signed by
our envoys at Ghent on Christmas Eve,
IS 14. Since that time the United
States and Great Britain, as was to be
expected from the contiguity of their
possessions, and their over-lapping in
terests in many parts of the world,
have often had differences. The
friendliness of the British for the Con
federacy, the aid extended that cause
through the Alabama and similar ves
sels, the various boundary questions,
the Monroe Doctrine, especially in the
Venezuela affair, the Panama tolls
controversy, these are a few, though
the most trying strains that have been
put upon the friendship of the tw j
nations. Though any of these might
have led to war—many a lesser griev
ance has provoked war in other quar
ters —peace has been maintained. It
is an achievement of true significance,
and one which should not be ignored.
