the custom of past ages, people are
judged by the things they do. A g'.rl

merely to have a home of her own, but
to fit herself professionally; ninety
percent become teachers; others be

office work.
In speaking of the work carried on
in the Deaconess School at Berkeley,
Deaconess liodgkin said in part:
"Eight months each year are given to
religious training, while fifteen, hours
a week are spent in preparation.
Courses in religious pedagogy and
Sunday school management are also
given. Another course is that which
trains our women as nurses.
"Social service work is performed
through three factors: the Y. W. C. A.,
the churches, and the clinics, which
lately have grown in importance."
