# INFORMATION FOR QUAD MUST BE IN BY FRIDAY
## Hurried Engraving May Mar the Appearance of Late Pictures. 
### 
Little more than half of the mem
bers of the Class of 1915 have an
swered the request for names and
data needed for the Senior Roll in the
1916 Quad. Return postal cards, with
instructions for filling them out, were
mailed Tuesday of last week. Friday
is the final date which can be given
for Seniors to have their cards in the
hands of Buford Williams, box 907
Campus. An all-night task of arrang
ing the cards and typewriting them in
final form will be necessary, in order
to get the copy to the printer Satur
day morning.
The names of students who do not
mail the Information at once will un
avoidably be left out of the book. An
urgent request s forced by the fact
that the entire work of type setting,
engraving, and printing must be fin
ished on April 21. The .remaining
time until May first is needed in order
that the binder may do a good job. The
books, being of large size, will be al
lowed to set three days, to prevent the
usual difficulty of breaking when fir t
opened.
A few organizations and house or
ganizations have not yet made dates
with the photographers. Pictures must
be taken, and data in the hands of the
department editors by February 20.
Payment for space must be made to
H. F. Eliott, box 1089, on or before
that date. No engravings will be made
until payment is received.
The time-honored difficulty of poor
pictures of some of the fratern'ties an I
other organizations has invariably
been due to late copy. Tf the engraver
is given proper time, he re-etches the
copper plates, and applies all the many
tricks of his trade in order to remove
defects which may have slipped by in
the studio or in the first etching. Lack
of time forces a rush through all the
departments concerned, and also
makes careful printing impossible.
Since the manager is under a hard
and fast contract with both the Quad
board and his advertisers, to circulate
the book on May 1. many bits of poor
workmanship have to be passed upon
when the time is so short.
