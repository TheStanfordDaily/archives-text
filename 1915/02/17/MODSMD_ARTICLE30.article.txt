# DEATH FOLLOWS FAST
## Roth Is Martyr to False Doctrine Voluntary Starvation and Lack of Blood Were Causes of Tailor's Death, Says Physician 
### 
Roth is dead. The plucky tailor of
Palo Alto, who believed so determin
edly in the efficacy of fasting as a cure
for digestive troubles that he abstained
from food for fifty-nine days, paid for
his novel experience with his life,
death coming at 0:40 yesterday even
ing. To the last Roth remained firm
in his belief in the principles of fast
ing.
Dr. L. E. Phillips,of Palo Alto,who at
tended Roth since midnight Monday,
issues the following statement in con
nection with the case:
"Death came as a result of voluntary
starvat'on, which exhausted all of
Roth's vital forces, and was due to the
emptiness of his blood vessels, his or
gans not being supplied with blood,
and therefore not being able to per
form their functions, and assimilate
nourishment at the end. He showed
no improvement after taking food, but
grew gradually weaker until the end,
which was immediately preceded by
convulsions. His kidneys failed to act
during the last twenty-four hours of
his life. At 8 o'clock yesterday morn
ing, his temperature was at its lowest,
registering 94.2 degrees. Artificial
warmth failed to restore his vitality.
"If Roth had had a physician's ad
vice throughout the final week, he
would have learned his true condition,
and could have keen saved."
Dr. Phillips was called into the case
only after Mrs. Roth had yielded to the
persuasions of Professor R. E. Swain,
of the Chemistry department, and Dr.
M. C. Terry, instructor of Bacteriology,
who threatened to discontinue their
visits to Roth unless medical advice
were secured. Swain and Terry were
interested spectators of the case and
were not acting in the capacity of
medical advisers.
In conrectioi with the death of Roth
Professor Swain stated:
"The man, h'mself, is not to be se
verely censured for what he did, for it
was his misfortune to secure a book,
the dangers and absurdities of which
lie accepted with implicit confidence.
Neither Dr. Terry nor myself encour
aged his fasting in any way. On the
contrary, we emphatically discouraged
it., although, as we came to know the
man, our admiration for his determin
ation increased."
