Representatives of the Alumni As

governing hoards met last evening and
discussed the plans for the Founders'
Day banquet. The committee decided
to invite Cap and Gown and Skull and
Snakes to aid in the arrangements.
Each society will delegate a selected
number of its members to co-operate
w'th the corresponding committees
which will be designated by the two
governing boards.
The Governors of the Union have
chosen their house committee, consist

son, '15, and R. C. Maple, '15, chair
man, to prepare the rooms of the
building for the reception of the
guests, and also for an informal dance
to be held after the dinner. The Skull
and Snakes representatives will at
tend to the detailed handling of the
affair.
The banquet will be held in the Wo
men's Club House, probably in cafe

ing the Women's Governing Board,
and consisting of Miss Elizabeth
Wright, 'OS, chairman, Miss Soph'a
Cramer, '04. Mrs. W. W. Horine, '02,

Shockley, *02. and Mrs. A. C. Whit
aker, '01, will have charge of provid
ing the entertainment. This body will
be assisted by members of Cap and

In many ways this year's banquet
promises to eclipse all previous ef
forts. The increased .room and facili
t'es presented by the two Club Houses,
and the enthusiasm with which cam
pus organization are backing the af
fair speaks well for the success of the
undertaking, both as to means of bav
ins an enjoyable informal jollv-up and
providing another common meeting
place for the four sides of the quad
rangle.
