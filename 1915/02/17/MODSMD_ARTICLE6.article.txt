proposition.
A meeting of both the Palo Alto and
Stanford committees in charge of the

department.
The Stanford Band, which will make
the trip to San Francisco early Satur

delegation, under the auspices of the
Chamber of Commerce of Palo Alto,
will lead the division. Free transpor

band. The musical program will eon
s'st entirely of popular march pieces.
In order to perfect the organization
of the Stanford and Palo Alto men
who intend to take part in the demon

price of fifty cents, which will give

are being sold at the Stanford Book
store and at various Palo Alto store ;
It is only from the sale of these badges
that any definite estimate can be mar-e

number who will participate in the
demonstration.
Xo definite announcement has bee , ''>
made by President Branner in regard
to the declaration of a University hol
iday on Saturday for the benef't of
the Engineering students, other than
to leave it to the decision of the pro
fessors in charge of the classes, who
may dismiss them if they see fit.
Should the sale of badges reach n
high mark, a special train will b >
chartered by the Palo Alto Chamber
of Commerce to take care of the crowd.
The Exposition committee in charge
of the parade, has granted an excel
lent position in the line, close to th~
front, for the local contingent. Thii
will permit an early entrance to th"
Fair Grounds.
The University of California has al
ready registered eight hundred appli

the parade, according to the Fair
headquarters. Including the Berkeley
residents, who are in the same geo
graphical division, five thousand w'P

will also be present.
Tomorrow will be the last day o" 1
which the badges may be secured. It
is important that all desiring to at

once, and thereby swell the number of
the delegation and make the demon
