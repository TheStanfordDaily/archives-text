ALUMNI NINE VS. FACULTY
J. E. McDowell, '00, Assistant Regis
trar of the University and Secretary of
the 1915 Reunion Committee of the
Stanford Alumni Association, states
that elaborate plans are being made to
place on record Alumni Day, May 15, as
a red-letter souvenir of graduate ac
tivity. A meeting was held in San
Francisco last week, and a detailed
itinerary outlined for the celebration.
In the morning, a baseball game will
lie played between representative
nines of the alumni and Faculty. In
former years, the Seniors gave battle
to the Faculty, and the contest was
featured by the unique costumes of
the student aggregation, Chinamen,
Teddy Hears, and other well-known
characters all figuring in the line-ups.
The alumni who have been detailed
to meet the Faculty batsmen this year
are expected to represent nine different
classes, and to wear the comic suits
in which they appeared in previous
games.
After the game, a luncheon will be
given the pleasure-seekers, and this
will be followed by an outdoor play—
"23"—a historical pageant masque and
mystery drama. The title bears refer
ence to the number of years which
have elapsed since 1892, when the first
class graduated from the University,
and the various scenes of the farce
will dep ct in a clever burlesque dif
ferent phases of Stanford tradition or
history. The Association plans to se
cure a great number of literary lights
of the past to collaborate in this dain
ty skit, and each writer will handle
some particular bit of excitement that
occurred during his undergraduate
days.
In the evening, class dinners and de
partmental reunions will occupy the
attention of the visiting alumni, and
the program will close with an even
ing dance in Encina Hall, or in the
Club House.
Of course, these Events are sched
uled for the very last week of the se
mester. but prominent alumni are giv
ing the date a great deal of thought,
and the co-operat'.on which has been
already secured guarantees a record
breaking day in the history of alumni
reunions.
