# Stanford Statues in Memorial Court to Be Moved Indoors
## 
### 
The bronze statue group of Senator
and Mrs, Stanford and Leland Stan
ford, Junior, now standing in the cen
ter of Memorial Court, is to be re
moved to cover, probably to the family
collection in the Museum, because of
their failure to withstand the action
of the elements.
The statues were executed in Italy in
1599 by Lavkin G. Mead, modeled after
a miniature which he had previously
designed for the Stanfords. They were
placed in November, 1901, on a low
pedestal in the center of the Inner
Quad. Mrs. Stanford was in Europe at
the time they were mounted. Upon
her return, she disapproved of their po
sition, and had them moved, a few
months after their original mounting,
to thei,r present position in the Me
morial Court, then building.
The cement circle around the
statuos will be dispensed with, and
only the cross-walks will remain.
It will now be possible for those ap
proaching the University by the main
road, through the Arboretum, to see
the Memorial Church through both
arches, the original plan of the archi
;ects.
