# CARNOT TRY-OUTS SET FOR TUESDAY NIGHT
## "Education in France Since 1900" is General Subject Which Will Be Debated This Year. CONTEST COMES APRIL 9 Famous Medal Given to Winner Is Provided by French Scholar in Memory of President 
### 
Tuesday, February 3, is the date which
has been set for the C&rnot Debate try
outs, which will be held in the chapel.
The general question for this year's
contest is "Education in France Since
1900." Those trying out will be given
the specific phase of this subject for
the try-out discussion at six o'clock
Tuesday afternoon, and will have from
then until eight o'clock to prepare
their speeches in final form.
Thus far only five men have signi
fied their intentions of entering the
competition for places on the Carnot
team. They are A. F. Coyle, '15, .1. D.
Adams, '15, E. E. Williams, '16, J. F.
Elden, 'IG, and W. L. Miller, '17. This
is less than a fourth of the number
which usually constitutes the Califor
nia Carnot squad, and this fact un
doubtedly explains to a great extent
why the Blue and Gold debaters have
taken the Carnot Medal for the last
five years, it is greatly deplored by
those interested in local forensics,
that so little interest is taken in this
event, and it is urged that all who pos
sibly can. enter the contest for places
on the team, which consists of three
men.
The debate, which will be held in the
Stanford Assembly Hall, on the ev
ening of April 9, is the greatest indi
vidual speaking contest held west of
Chicago.
About twenty-five years ago. Baron
de Coubertin, a French scholar and
statesman, came to the United States
to make a tour of the American uni
versities. Among those visited were
Stanford and California, where he was
so much impressed with his reception,
that he left a large endowment fund to
pay for a medal to be given annually
in a speaking contest. This medal was
to be called the Carnot, in memory of
Sadie Carnot. the martyred president
of France. The subject of the debate
is always some phase of French life.
The medal is made in France. For
this .reason, there is some doubt as to
its being awarded this year, on ac
count of the war. Nothing definite
has been learned on this subject as
yet.
The try-outs Tuesday evening will
begin at eight o'clock, and all are cor
dially invited to attend.
