# THE 						RIGHTS OF OTHERS
## 
### 
During the past few weeks there has
been a wanton disregard for the rights
of others about the campus. This may
result from a selfish desire, from
thoughtlessness, or from impulse of
doing something particularly smart.
We prefer to think that it arises from
pure thoughtlessness, and when the
attention of certain individuals is
called to the fact that they have been
overstepping their bounds that they
will be more thoughtful in the future.
Mazda lamps have been installed in
the University buildings by the Busi
ness Management, in order that better
lights may be afforded the students.
The privilege of using these lights has
been abused in several instances. In
the Library it has been necessary to
install patent fasteners to the bulbs,
in order to put a stop to the self-ap
propriation of University property.
These fasteners make it impossible to
take the lamps out of the sockets with
out destroying the utility of the light.
Recently a box of Mazda lamps was
left in one of the buildings over night,
and the next morning more than half
of the contents had been removed.
Recently books have been taken
from the loan desk before they had
been charged out. It may be that a
person has signed an hou.r card for a
book and is unable to use the book at
the appointed time, for the reason that
some thoughtless person has not con
sidered the rights of another, and took
the hook without permission.
Privileges arc to be enjoyed only so
long as they are not abused. Respect
the rights and property of others, and
consider always "the other fellow."
