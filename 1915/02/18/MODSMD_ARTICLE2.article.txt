# IRRIGATION METER IS NEW ENGINEERING INVENTION
## 
### 
A new Venturi irrigation meter is
the latest acquisition of the Mechanical
Engineering laboratory. The appara
tus has hardly more than left the
hand of the inventor, and is not yet
regularly established on the market.
The meter is a clever invention, which
makes a record on a circular chart of
the amount of water passing through
a ditch during a certain time.
A proof that the invention is only in
its infancy is shown by the fact that it
has undergone but one series of tests
sinee ! ts perfection. It is for the pur
pose of thoroughly proving the accura
cy and efficiency of the meter that H
has been secured by the Mechanical
Engineering department. The test will
be carried out under direction of
J. H. Cox. '13.
