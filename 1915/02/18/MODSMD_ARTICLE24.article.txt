To the Editor:
Reading your editorial on the pro
osed removal of the group statue from
the Memorial Court gives to some of us
who have long lived here "a com
mingled feeling of complete surprise
and sincere regret." What kind of re
gret? Regret that editorials have to be
written under such pressure that there
is not sufficient time to investigate the
facts in a given problem. At first
glance, a Memorial Court without a
memorial statue might indeed seem
1 ke Hamlet with Hamlet left out. Rut
a second glance would bring to light
the fact that tlie court is "memorial,"
not by virtue of the statue, but in hon
or of the Stanford men who died in the
Spanish war, whose names are en
rolled on the bronze tablet at the west
ern side.
And is it quite true that, in a univer
sity that is in itself a memorial, a
statue of the founders is "essential?"
Christopher Wren directed that there
should be no statue of himself in the
great church that he had built, but
only a tablet with these words: "If
you seek his monument, look about
you."
The editorial seems to imply that the
trustees decide these questions of poli
cy "off-hand," and need to be warned
against precipitate action. It is well
to be sure that we ourselves are well
informed, before we too easily assume
that a responsible body does not weigh
a problem carefully before deciding on
radical action.
