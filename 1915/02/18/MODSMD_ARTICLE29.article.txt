# Plans For Public Market in Palo Alto Progress
## 
### 
Much talent and several unusual and
entertaining features have been pro
cured for the public market to be held
in Palo Alto Saturday, March 6, under
the oak trees of the Circle.
The market will be of the type which
has grown up in Belgium, France and
Italy since mediaeval times. It will
have the organ-grinder and punch and
judy show of the old fair type of mar
ket, and.in addition, much that only a
university community can afford.
These features and the Old World
market d.ress and customs will make a
very pretty picture under the oaks.
However, the picture is not the im
portant feature. The market is to be
a bona-fide one, in which the buyers
will benefit financially. The booths
will sell, at regular market prices, or
perhaps less, a long list of articles,
among which will be vegetables, fruits,
flowers, poultry, fish, live pets, pot
tery, baskets, nuts, eggs, butter and
choose, jollies, honey, Italian breads,
and all of the natural products of the
surrounding country.
Whatever of financial profit results
from the market will be turned over to
the Belgian Relief committee of Palo
Alto and the University. Those re
sponsible for the project are Mef dames
i Wilbur and Towne, of Palo Alto, and
i Stillman and Kellocs:. of Stanford.
