# Spartan of the Darkness Arrives at University
## N.C. Hanks, sightless and Handless, Mopes to Further Knowledge of English Literature at Stanford. 
### 
Blind and crippled by the loss of
both hands, N. C. Hanks, who "laughs
at fate," arrived at the University yes
terday to investigate the feasibility of
continuing his life work, the studying
of English literature at Stanford. Ten
years ago, while a student of the Brig
ham Young University, Utah, Hanks
lost his hands and eyes in an explo
sion, but even though so tremendously
handicapped he was able in a few years
to go on with his education. Byron W.
King, a lecturer, met the sightless stu
dent, and Hanks went with him to the
King School of Oratory at Pittsburg.
Since leaving that institution he has
been lecturing on English literature
and presenting Shakesperian and mod
ern readings in public.
Mr. Hanks called on the Registrar,
Dr. O. L. Elliott, yesterday afternoon,
presenting a letter of introduction
from J. C. Swenson, who is professor
of history at the Brigham Young Uni
versity. This afternoon the blind lec
turer will confer with Chancellor .Tor
dan concerning the possibilities of en
tering some courses here.
Even after meeting with the acci
dent Hanks worked his way as he con
tinued his studying, and today supports
himself by lecturing. He travels alone
over the enti.re country, covering twen
ty-five thousand miles last year. Un
complaining, possessed of a remark
able personality, undaunted courage
and ambition, his career to date is a
wonderful example of triumph over
misfortune.
