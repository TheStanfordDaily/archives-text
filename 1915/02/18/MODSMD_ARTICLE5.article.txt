# CARDINAL POPPIES WILL CARPET STANFORD FIELDS
## 
### 
A cardinal poppy has been produced
by Luther Hurbank, and soon the
fields of Stanford will be carpeted with
cups of loyal red instead of copas de
oro. Hurbank selected from among
the wild California poppy plants those
bearing flowers with the deepest col
ored blossoms, and by a process of
segregation, and of elimination of
those of paler color, the famous plant
breeder succeeded in producing a
flower typical of Stanford, and bearing
the cardinal hue.
