# "THIS IS WONDERFUL," CRIES GRACE DARLING
## World-Touring Girl Enters Into Spirit of Hearty Welcome That Is Accorded Her on Quadrangle "IS IT ALL LIKE THAT" Hearst-Selig Movie Star Pictures College to be a Place Meant for Fun and Good Times. 
### 
Grace Darling came, saw, and con
quered. Like the flicker of the movie
screen itself, she was here, and she
was gone. From the moment that she
alighted from the train with her ever
present smile of greeting, at 9:45, un
til she boarded the special car that was
to carry her down the valley, she was
Grace Darling, maker of friends. Ev
eryone that could get a glimpse of the
Hearst-Selig star will have a picture
impressed firmly upon his mind—a pic
ture of a smile emerging from a world
of golden hair and light brown furs.
Add a tiny creation that served as a
hat, a plaid coat of green and blue, a
dark skirt, and another smile, and you
have Grace Darling,—the girl who is
touring the world in search of the nov
el and beautiful.
She found both today. Chancellor
Jordan's hearty welcome—a true Stan
ford welcome—the glorious reception
accorded her by the student body in
front of the Quad; the triumphal
march across the Memorial Court, un
der the arch, and around the Inner
Quad, arm in arm with Dr. Jordan;
the hilarious serpentine, lifted high on
the shoulders of the cheering throng;
the water-festival on the lawn; the
kiss offered the martyred Freshman,
and the final hearty good-bye,—all
combined to help Grace know the West
and Stanford.
"I just love it out here,' she said, on
her drive up the Avenue. "I've heard
that it has been raining for days and
days, but since I've been here the sun
has been shining most of the time.
Only once did it rain, and 1 was glad
that it did —1 was so tired."
"This is wonderful," she exclaimed,
glancing from the green trees of the
Arboretum to the red-tiled roofs ahead
—it reminds me of the sunny South. I
so wanted to have a bungalow down
there."
"Southern California?" she was
asked.
She nooded. "Yes, Southern Califor
nia,"
"Oh, I like the West," v/as her an
swer to a query. "The western folks
are so broad-minded, and, —well, yes,
so informal.
"What do I think of college people?
1 haven't an opinion. I've always
thought of college as a place for fun.
No, I have no ideal college man."
"Tall, with 1 ig spectacles, and a long,
narrow face?" it was suggested.
