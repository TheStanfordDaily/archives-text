# NEW SWIMMING TANK
## To Be Started as Soon as Trustees Select Definite Site. 
### 
Ever since the Trustees passed a
motion to enlarge the filtration plant
of the new gymnasium, in order to
provide a wate,r supply for a swimming
tank, the Hoard of Control of the Stan
ford Athletic Fields has been active in
pushing the project through to an early
completion. Surveys and levels have
been made, and the dimensions of the
plunge definitely dec'ded upon.
The structure will probably occupy
the plot of ground left vacant, at the
southeast corner by the plan of the
gymnasium construction. Negotia
tions are to be carried on with the
Hoard of Trustees at the present time
for its official sanction to the desired
location.
The new tank will have the open air
for its roof, and will be one hundred
feet long by forty wide. For seventy
five feet the dept of the pool will grad
ually increase from three and one-half
feet to nine feet, and this water level
will bo nia'ntaiiud for twenty-five feet
'noro. to permit cf hish diving. No con
tract has been let for the building of
the swimming tank, and sieh action
will rot bo commenced until thr Trus
t eÂ« have officially pcc'tutd the ite
recommended hv the Hoard cf Cnnt: >!.
