# OUR PRIVILEGE; OUR DUTY

### 
Considerable agitation has sprung up
on the campus in opposition to the ac
tion of the Hoard of Trustees, since it
was announced that the contract had
been placed to remove the Memorial
Statue from the Memorial Court to the
Museum. Petitions are being circulat
ed about the campus today respectfully
petitioning the Board to refrain from
this action.
The underlying unofficial reason for
removing the Memorial Statue is the
fact that it is not appropriate, and
therefore should be removed. It does
not seem fitting for the present gen
eration to determine whether or not
the Statue is appropriate. The tri
bute to the memory of the Stanford
family was placed in the Memorial
Court by one of the Founders of the
University, and, whether or not it is
approved by every one is not the ques
tion that should be taken into consid
eration. It was the wish of Mrs. Stan
ford that the Statue should be placed
in the Memorial Court, and as such
should be revered and cherished.
The Memorial Court came into be
ing as a .result of the construction of
the Memorial Arch, and immediately
after its construction the Memorial
Statue was removed from the Inner
Quad to the Memorial Court as the
most fitting place for the Statue.
It has become an inviolable me
morial of the University, conveying
to those most intimately in touch with
the University a feeling of reverence
and sacredness. There is a memory of
love attached to the Statue, as a sym
bol of the complete affection of the
Stanford family, which can be espe
cially appreciated by those who knew
the Founders.
It is the duty and privilege of the
present generation to maintain and
respect the sacred monuments which
have been handed down to its keeping.
