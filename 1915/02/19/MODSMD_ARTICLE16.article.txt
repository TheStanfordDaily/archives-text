To the Editor:
So many questions, put by inexperi
enced and self-sacrificing class treas
urers are so unsatisfactorily answered,
if at all; and so many classes find
themselves in such a hopeless financial
tangle at the end of four years of ex
pensive shows and other college activ
ities that it might seem advisable for
the Student Adviser, or the Registrar,
to be constituted as financial adviser,
with some fairly strong executive
functions. Some classes have tried
the finance committee system with fair
success. At any rate, some system
should be evolved which would put the
entire class on a firm financial footing,
and keep it there for the following
four years.
If such a system were evolved, one
of the first principles, a principle in
extricably bound up with the funda
mental "income," should be this; that
only those who pay their dues should
be considered as members of the class.
The custom of allowing one-half of the
class to ride on the other half is man
ifestly disgustingly unjust. It is not
only this, but it is demoralizing to the
riders, and therefore a dangerous
practiceâ€”and also it doesn't bring in
the money.
Under the principle outlined, the
first obvious rule is that only class
members, i.e., those who have paid
their dues, should be allowed to vote,
or to participate in any class func
tions.
In order that this rule be made ef
fective, a record must be kept of those
who have kept up their dues from their
entering semester on. Such records
are easily made with the help of a
student directory. If the system is in
augurated upon the entrance of the
class, and a separate directory kept
for each semester, a complete list of
the class can be filed easily (at the
Registrar's?). This will materially
facilitate the work of the succeeding
treasurers. As an outcome of this the
posting, or publishing of the names of
the delinquents should be carried out
at the end of each semester.
The usual lack of Senior funds does
not spring from the inadequacy of the
amount of the dues; but from their
non-payment on the one hand, and the
rash spending of them on the other.
Being glad for the "Ex," I am,
Yours truly,
AN "EX"-CLASS TREASURER.
