Graduate Manager Wilcox has re
ceived a letter from H. O. Page, man
ager of the Chicago Varsity nine, who
wants to arrange for a series of games,
two with Stanford and two with the
University of California, between Sep
tember 4-10. The Chicago team is one
of the best in the Middle West, and the
contemplated trip to San Francisco is
one of great interest.
Five of the games scheduled for the
Varsity to date could not be played on
account of rain. One of the canceled
contests was with Santa Clara, one
with St. Ignatius, and three with St.
Mary's.
The Varsity and Second Varsity
nines played a three-inning practice
game yesterday, rehearsing the double
steal and the cut-off plays. Hayes,
Wickersham, Hoever. and Anderson
each took a turn in the box.
H. C. Fabling, '16, who was catching
for the Blacks in the Peanut League
has been transferred to the Varsity
squad.
The Reds won their game with the
Whites yesterday, thereby diminishing
the immediate possibility of being
overtaken by their nearest .rivals for
first place.
The Blacks won the contest on the
Faculty field by scoring five runs to
the Blues' two, and climbed back into
the third position again.
Art. Shafer, ex-'l4, former third base
man of the Giants, who retired from
baseball last winter, is denying ru
mors that he would manage a Federal
League team, and says that he is
through with professional baseball for
all time.
