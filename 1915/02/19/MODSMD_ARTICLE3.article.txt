## 
### 
"The home fo.v all generations of
Stanford women" was dedicated yes
terday evening when the doors of the
Women's Club House were opened for
the first time to all Faculty, alumnae,
and undergraduate women.
After an informal basket supper in
the roomy, cream-tinted club room on
the lower floor, the three hundred wo
men present went to the second floor
of the Club House, where the new 3500-
foot dance floor was christened to the
strains of Tipperary. Though many a
Stanford man will essay the terpsi
chorean art on th'.s floor hereafter,
dance after dance last evening proved
that a gathering of undergraduate fem
inity can unaided appreciate to the ut
most the possibilities of a new hard
wood floor.
Miss Alice Kimball, '04, who was a
former president of the Women's
League, presided at the gathering as
mistress of ceremonies. "Though I
cannot claim that mine was the bonnet
'n which buzzed the original bee of
'Women's Club House,' I was among
those who worked for the project in
the very beginning. So when Mrs. Al
lan searched me out from behind my
impenetrable jungle of prune trees •'.o
do the 'Charleyfielding' for this occa
sion, I accepted. Though I felt that I
could never be a second Charles K.
Field on account of my lamentable lack
of knowledge of the fortifications of
the Panama Canal, I was much re
lieved to find that 'Charleyfielding' did
not consist, as was my first vague im
pression, in playing some outlandish
position on the varsity nine."
Miss Kimball then introduced the
president of the Women's Club House

Hoard of Directors, Mrs. P. J. Treat,
'07, who spoke appreciatively of the
many gifts which have been made to
ward furnishing the building. Mrs.
Treat acknowledged the loan of some
fine pieces of carved walnut furniture
by the Hoard of Trustees. From Miss
Rurner, formerly Mrs. Stanford's
secretary, came a copy of Mrs. Stan
ford's only talk before the women of
the University and a photograph of
Senator and Mrs. Stanford, taken at
the time of their marriage. The wo
men of the Faculty have furnished the
Club House with dishes. Hooks have
been received from Mrs. Allan and
Mrs. O. P. Jenkins to start the read
ing room library, while Dr. Jordan
presents a complete set of his writings.
Mrs. Orin W. Dunn has given a table
toward furnishing the lower floor.
Mrs. Mitchell has sent a chair, and
from Mrs. Fowler comes a tea set. Mrs.
Stillman contributes cushions to the
comfort of the Club House. E. P. Les
ley, '97, assistant professor in the Me
chanical Engineering department, will
give a pair of andirons.
"A View of Point Lobos," a canvas
by Mrs. William Austin Cannon, ex-'OO,
has been presented by the artist. Mrs.
E. C. Starks, of the Art department,
has offered to hang a number of her
water colors.
"The Realization of the Club House''
was the subject of Mrs. Jordan's talk.
"Though 1 was away when many of
you saw the material foundations of
this building laid, I was here when
only the intangible foundations of the
Club House existed. This building, the
the hopes and plans for which have
lived in the hearts of Stanford women
for so many years, is now a reality."

Mrs. John Caspar Branner then ad
dressed the women, outlining the his
tory of the Women's Union from the
time of the fostering of the plan by
Mrs. Matzke, then physical director
fo.r the women of the University. She
concluded by saying: "Dr. Branner
has purchased life memberships in the
Union for himself, two sons, and two
grandsons. Feeling that the men in a
a family should not outdo the women,
and having but one daughter and no
granddaughters, I have decided to take
out life memberships for my two future
daughters-in-law and four grand
daughters."
Bertha Knox, 'IG, accompanied by
Miss Lina Jacobs, '14, sang Brahms'
Lullaby. Miss Ruth Benteley, '18,
played the violin obligato.
Mrs. Allan spoke on "What the Club
House Will Mean." She told of the
long necessity that had existed for a
general meeting place for the women
of the University, and saw in the Club
House the realization of this idea. Miss
C. S. Stoltenberg, '96, gave a report of
the Club House finances.
The musical program included a vio
lin solo by Miss Louise Curtner, '17,
and piano solos by Miss Mabel Schell
bach, '16, and Miss Dorothy Wo
niack, '16. A medley of popular airs
was played by the Women's Mandolin
Club, and Harold Cowell, a young pian
ist and composer, interpreted two of
his own compositions.
After the formal program the first
strains of "Come Join the Band" sent
the enthusiastic five hundred into a
swinging serpentine, which ended with
rousing cheers for the Women's Union
and for Dr. Jordan, who spoke a few
words of congratulation.

Miss Alice Kimball, '04, who was a
former president of the Women's
League, presided at the gathering as
mistress of ceremonies. "Though I
cannot claim that mine was the bonnet
'n which buzzed the original bee of
'Women's Club House,' I was among
those who worked for the project in
the very beginning. So when Mrs. Al
lan searched me out from behind my
impenetrable jungle of prune trees •'.o
do the 'Charleyfielding' for this occa
sion, I accepted. Though I felt that I
could never be a second Charles K.
Field on account of my lamentable lack
of knowledge of the fortifications of
the Panama Canal, I was much re
lieved to find that 'Charleyfielding' did
not consist, as was my first vague im
pression, in playing some outlandish
position on the varsity nine."
Miss Kimball then introduced the
president of the Women's Club House

Hoard of Directors, Mrs. P. J. Treat,
'07, who spoke appreciatively of the
many gifts which have been made to
ward furnishing the building. Mrs.
Treat acknowledged the loan of some

secretary, came a copy of Mrs. Stan
ford's only talk before the women of
the University and a photograph of

Mrs. O. P. Jenkins to start the read
ing room library, while Dr. Jordan
presents a complete set of his writings.
Mrs. Orin W. Dunn has given a table
toward furnishing the lower floor.
Mrs. Mitchell has sent a chair, and

"A View of Point Lobos," a canvas
by Mrs. William Austin Cannon, ex-'OO,
has been presented by the artist. Mrs.
E. C. Starks, of the Art department,
has offered to hang a number of her
water colors.
"The Realization of the Club House''
was the subject of Mrs. Jordan's talk.
"Though 1 was away when many of
you saw the material foundations of
this building laid, I was here when
only the intangible foundations of the
Club House existed. This building, the
the hopes and plans for which have
lived in the hearts of Stanford women
for so many years, is now a reality."

Mrs. John Caspar Branner then ad
dressed the women, outlining the his
tory of the Women's Union from the
time of the fostering of the plan by
Mrs. Matzke, then physical director
fo.r the women of the University. She
concluded by saying: "Dr. Branner
has purchased life memberships in the
Union for himself, two sons, and two
grandsons. Feeling that the men in a
a family should not outdo the women,
and having but one daughter and no
granddaughters, I have decided to take
out life memberships for my two future
daughters-in-law and four grand
daughters."
Bertha Knox, 'IG, accompanied by
Miss Lina Jacobs, '14, sang Brahms'
Lullaby. Miss Ruth Benteley, '18,

Mrs. Allan spoke on "What the Club

the Club House finances.

niack, '16. A medley of popular airs
was played by the Women's Mandolin
Club, and Harold Cowell, a young pian
ist and composer, interpreted two of
his own compositions.
After the formal program the first
strains of "Come Join the Band" sent
the enthusiastic five hundred into a
swinging serpentine, which ended with
rousing cheers for the Women's Union
and for Dr. Jordan, who spoke a few
words of congratulation.
"The home fo.v all generations of
Stanford women" was dedicated yes
terday evening when the doors of the
Women's Club House were opened for
the first time to all Faculty, alumnae,
and undergraduate women.
After an informal basket supper in
the roomy, cream-tinted club room on
the lower floor, the three hundred wo
men present went to the second floor
of the Club House, where the new 3500-
foot dance floor was christened to the
strains of Tipperary. Though many a
Stanford man will essay the terpsi
chorean art on th'.s floor hereafter,
dance after dance last evening proved
that a gathering of undergraduate fem
inity can unaided appreciate to the ut
most the possibilities of a new hard
wood floor.

position on the varsity nine."
Miss Kimball then introduced the
president of the Women's Club House

Hoard of Directors, Mrs. P. J. Treat,
'07, who spoke appreciatively of the
many gifts which have been made to
ward furnishing the building. Mrs.
Treat acknowledged the loan of some
fine pieces of carved walnut furniture
by the Hoard of Trustees. From Miss
Rurner, formerly Mrs. Stanford's
secretary, came a copy of Mrs. Stan
ford's only talk before the women of
the University and a photograph of
Senator and Mrs. Stanford, taken at
the time of their marriage. The wo
men of the Faculty have furnished the
Club House with dishes. Hooks have
been received from Mrs. Allan and
Mrs. O. P. Jenkins to start the read
ing room library, while Dr. Jordan
presents a complete set of his writings.
Mrs. Orin W. Dunn has given a table
toward furnishing the lower floor.
Mrs. Mitchell has sent a chair, and
from Mrs. Fowler comes a tea set. Mrs.
Stillman contributes cushions to the
comfort of the Club House. E. P. Les
ley, '97, assistant professor in the Me
chanical Engineering department, will
give a pair of andirons.
"A View of Point Lobos," a canvas
by Mrs. William Austin Cannon, ex-'OO,
has been presented by the artist. Mrs.
E. C. Starks, of the Art department,
has offered to hang a number of her
water colors.
"The Realization of the Club House''
was the subject of Mrs. Jordan's talk.
"Though 1 was away when many of
you saw the material foundations of
this building laid, I was here when
only the intangible foundations of the
Club House existed. This building, the
the hopes and plans for which have
lived in the hearts of Stanford women
for so many years, is now a reality."

Mrs. John Caspar Branner then ad
dressed the women, outlining the his
tory of the Women's Union from the
time of the fostering of the plan by
Mrs. Matzke, then physical director
fo.r the women of the University. She
concluded by saying: "Dr. Branner
has purchased life memberships in the
Union for himself, two sons, and two
grandsons. Feeling that the men in a
a family should not outdo the women,
and having but one daughter and no
granddaughters, I have decided to take
out life memberships for my two future
daughters-in-law and four grand
daughters."
Bertha Knox, 'IG, accompanied by
Miss Lina Jacobs, '14, sang Brahms'
Lullaby. Miss Ruth Benteley, '18,
played the violin obligato.
Mrs. Allan spoke on "What the Club
House Will Mean." She told of the
long necessity that had existed for a
general meeting place for the women
of the University, and saw in the Club
House the realization of this idea. Miss
C. S. Stoltenberg, '96, gave a report of
the Club House finances.
The musical program included a vio
lin solo by Miss Louise Curtner, '17,
and piano solos by Miss Mabel Schell
bach, '16, and Miss Dorothy Wo
niack, '16. A medley of popular airs
was played by the Women's Mandolin
Club, and Harold Cowell, a young pian
ist and composer, interpreted two of
his own compositions.
After the formal program the first
strains of "Come Join the Band" sent
the enthusiastic five hundred into a
swinging serpentine, which ended with
rousing cheers for the Women's Union
and for Dr. Jordan, who spoke a few
words of congratulation.
