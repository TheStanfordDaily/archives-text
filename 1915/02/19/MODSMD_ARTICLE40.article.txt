# AGREEMENT PLANS STILL DEADLOCKED
## Faculty Attitude Toward Freshman Game Makes Negotiations Impossible 
### 
No action has been taken in the
matter of re-establishing intercollegi
ate relations between Stanford and
California since the conference of the
Faculty committees two weeks ago,
and the agreement problem is at the
same point as it was at that time.
That spring athletic events will be
run off under the old agreement is a
settled fact, but this is the only issue
the intercollegiate committee has de
cided. The failure of the Faculty com
mittees to come to any agreement in
regard to restoring the Freshman
game, and the assurance of the Stan
ford Faculty that the game will never
be restored has served to automatic
ally abrogate the tentative compact
drawn by the Intercollegiate Agree
ment Committees. This leaves the
committee at the same point in com
ing to a settlement as before the tenta
tive agreement was made.
No meetings of the committee have
been held since the Faculty confer
ence, although the Graduate Managers,
Wilcox and Stroud, have conferred.
The Stanford members of the Intercol
legiate Agreement Committee have not
met for a discussion since the last
meeting of the committee. A. E. Wor
thy, '15, secretary of the intercollegi
ate committee, has received no com
munication from the California dele
gates regarding a conference in the
near future.
