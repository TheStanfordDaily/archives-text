# VARSITY WILL LINE-UP AGAINST SANTA CLARA
## MISSION NINE TO OPPOSE STANFORD FOR SECOND TIME OF SEASON TOMORROW. HAYES AND DENT THE BATTERY EIGHT GAMES CALLED OFF ON ACCOUNT OF RAINâ€”VARSITY BREAKS EVEN. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon, weather per
mitting, the University of Santa Clara
nine will make its second campus ap
pearance of the season, when it lines
up against the Stanford Varsity on the
local diamond. The meeting of the
two teams should result in some excel
lent baseball, since Coach Wolter has
transformed the Missionites intoawell
balanced aggregation.
For the first time since the opening
game, Doc Hayes will be on the firing
line for the Cardinals. The long rest
enforced by blood poisoning in bis
rigbt hand, has left the boxman in
splendid condition. Hoever is to re
lieve after the fifth inning. Dent will
perform the backstopping duties for
Hayes, while Landers will lie given an
opportunity to don the mask opposite
Hoever.
The regular infield combination,
which has played together practically
throughout the entire season, consist
ing of Captain Workman at the initial
station, Stafford at second base, Mc-
Closkey at the difficult corner, and
Stevens at shortstop, will be on deck.
The personnel of the outfield will be
subject to the fact whether the Santa
Clara twirler be of the portside or star
board variety. In case of a right
hander, Day, Noonan, and O'Neill are
named as the flychasers, while a south
paw will see Day, Austin, and Downing
in the line-up. Heine Spencer will is
sue the call for the first batter prompt
ly at four-fifteen.
Thus far this season eight of the
original fourteen games scheduled by
Manager Wilcox to be played by the
Varsity with other teams have been
postponed on account of inopportune
showers. St. Mary's has been the
heaviest lose.r, having had four con
tests called off because of rain. Two
games have been struck off the sched
ule with Santa Clara, while both St.
Ignatius and the San Francisco All-
Stars have missed one opportunity to
exhibit their wares on the campus.
The season's record of games played
gives the Varsity a percentage of .r>oo
for games won and lost, out of a total
of six contests. Two of the three de
feats suffered by Stanford were at the
hands of the Olympic Club, the scores
being 4-2 and f>-1. Ireland's Independ
ents have registered the only other vic
tory over the Varsity, winning the first
encounter 4-1, In the win column Hilly
Orr's charges have downed Santa
Clara 8-1, San .lose All-Stars 3-2, and
