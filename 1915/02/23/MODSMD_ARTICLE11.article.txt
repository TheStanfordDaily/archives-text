# SENIOR RECORD AND MONEY ARE THORNS IN THE QUAD
## 
### 
The Senior roll for publication in
19lf> Quad has been sent to the printer,
with about one hundred less names
than should be listed. The failure of
individuals to fill out the return post
als provided is .responsible for the dis
crepancy.
It. will be possible to insert names
and data of Seniors who send cards to
Ruford Williams by Thursday morning.
The use of the record as a valuable
reference would be destroyed by in
completeness.
Since it is impossible to wait longer
than Thursday, such information as
appears in the Register will be written
by a member of the staff.
Most of the organizations have had
pictures taken at Franklin's, or have
arranged to have them taken. Few
have made remittances to the manager
of the Quad. Payment is necessary be
fore the arrangement of pages can be
completed. Cheeks in payment for
space must be in the hands of H. F.
Filiott, box 10S9. Campus, by Friday.
