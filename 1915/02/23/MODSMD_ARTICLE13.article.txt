# FULLER SISTERS WILL ENTERTAIN STANFORD
## FAMOUS SINGERS SECURED BY FACULTY COMMITTEE FOR MARCH SECOND. COMPRISE PICTURESQUE TRIO ENGLISH, SCOTTISH, AND LRISH FOLK-SONGS TO CHARACTERIZE PERFORMANCE. 
### 
Following up its many achievements
of former seasons, the Faculty Com
mittee on Entertainment announces as
its first number for this year the
Misses Dorothy, Cynthia, and Rosalind
Fuller, of Dorset, England, who are
famous singers of English, Scottish,
and Irish folk-songs. The concert will
be given in the Assembly Hall at 8:15
Tuesday evening, March 2d.
The Fuller sisters appeared in the
United States for the first time a few
years ago. Their trip was made as an
experiment, which p.roved such a de
cided success that it has become an
annual event with them. Concerts giv
en by them are characterized by sim
plicity, appealing charm, and a lack of
artifice and insincerity, which immedi
ately captivates their audiences. They
have gathered their songs, some dating
even to the time of Queen Elizabeth,
from the peasants of England, Scot
land, and Ireland, and many of the
songs have been rescued by them from
permanent oblivion. Since their songs
come from all parts of the British
Isles, they are representative of their
history. A proof of their success be
fore Eastern audiences is attested by
a clipping from Harpers Weekly, ap
pearing soon after their first tour. It
.reads as follows:
"Dorothy, Cynthia, and Rosalind Ful
ler, of Dorset, England, who form our
frontispiece this week, are now singing
in the United States, English, Scottish,
and Irish folk-songs. A very pictur
esque group they are, in early Vic
torian costume, accompanied on an
Irish harp. They form our frontis
piece because their art represents
something interesting, lovely, and un
usual. They have sung to many culti
vated audiences, including those at
Harvard, Bryn Mawr, Columbia, Smith,
Radcliff, the New England Conserva
tory of Music, and where taste is high
est. they are most appreciated." The
committee, which has, in the past,
brought such artists as Fritz Kreisler
and Shumann lleink to the campus,
feels that it is unusually fortunate in
securing talent of such rare merit. The
art characterizing this concert, al
though different than Kreisler's, will
nevertheless be an art of the.finest
quality. The lovers of music are to be
afforded a splendid opportunity to
hear musicians who possess a delight
ful originality.
The sale of seats commences Wed
nesday, February 24, at the Bookstore
and Weingartne.r's drug store. Tlie
seats will range in price from f>o cen*s
to $1.00.

"Dorothy, Cynthia, and Rosalind Ful
ler, of Dorset, England, who form our
frontispiece this week, are now singing
in the United States, English, Scottish,
and Irish folk-songs. A very pictur
esque group they are, in early Vic
torian costume, accompanied on an
Irish harp. They form our frontis
piece because their art represents
something interesting, lovely, and un
usual. They have sung to many culti
vated audiences, including those at
Harvard, Bryn Mawr, Columbia, Smith,
Radcliff, the New England Conserva
tory of Music, and where taste is high
est. they are most appreciated." The
committee, which has, in the past,
brought such artists as Fritz Kreisler
and Shumann lleink to the campus,
feels that it is unusually fortunate in
securing talent of such rare merit. The
art characterizing this concert, al
though different than Kreisler's, will
nevertheless be an art of the.finest
quality. The lovers of music are to be
afforded a splendid opportunity to
hear musicians who possess a delight
ful originality.
