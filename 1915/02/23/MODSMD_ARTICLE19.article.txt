The Memorial Statue is no longer a
part of the Memorial Court. Very un
expectedly it was removed on Satur
day morning, when the campus was al
most deserted, to a place in the Mu
seum. The petitions circulated on Fri
day, to induce the Trustees to refrain
from the action to remove the Memor
ial Statue, were worthless as far as be
ing influential, but they were valuable,
as far as they expressed the opinion of
a large part of the community. As one
of the members of the Faculty ex
pressed himself' "1 feel much better
better now that I have signed such a
petition." Similar sentiments were
echoed by many others.
The reasons advanced for the re
moval of the Memorial Statue were
three; first, that the University was a
memorial and there was no need for
the Statue; second, the view of the
Memorial Church and arches of the
Inner Court were obscured by the
Statue; and third, that the material of
the Statue could not withstand the ele
ments of the weather. Indirectly and
more important were the reasons that
the Memorial Statue was inappropriate
and a crude specimen of sculptural
work.
From the viewpoint of those who re
vered and respected the Memorial
Statue and cherished the wishes of
Mrs. Stanford, reasons advanced for
the removal have been considered
heretofore and deemed of slight sig
nificance.
Now that the Memorial Statue has
been removed it has been suggested
that a fitting tribute be erected in the
Memorial Court to the memory of Mrs.
.Fane Lathrop Stanford. The Univer
sity is a memorial to Leland Stanford,

Junior; the Memorial Church was
erected in honor of Senator Leland
Stanford; but there has never been a
tribute to the mother ot' all Stanford
men and women. Why would it not be
possible to interest the Board of Trus
tees to erect a memorial to the wo
man who sacrificed, toiled, and gave
her all, that we might benefit.
