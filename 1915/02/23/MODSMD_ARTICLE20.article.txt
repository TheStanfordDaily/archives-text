# In Memory of the Memorial Statue
## 
### 
She placed it there in love and pride,
At Learning's Golden Gate,
No ruthless whim, no vagrant hand
Her shrine should desecrate.
Yet quick forgot are woman's prayers,
Or strong man's tears and fears;
A day or two their memory clings,
Then melts away in years.
But somewhere loyal hearts beat true,
And reverence holds place;
Nor time, nor clime, nor grasping
hand,
Thy memory can efface.
