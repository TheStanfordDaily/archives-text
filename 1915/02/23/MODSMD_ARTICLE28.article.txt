# BISHOP GAILOR PREACHES MEMORIAL CHURCH SERMON
## Choice of Associates and the Benefits of Friendship Is Burden of His Talk. 
### 
The Right Reverend Thomas F.
Gailor, Bishop of Tennessee, preached
in the Memorial Church on Sunday,
taking as his text, "For Herod himself
had sent forth and laid hold upon
John, and bound him in prison for He
rodia's sake, his brother Phillip's wife:
for he had married her." He told the
story of Herod's unlawful marriage to
strengthen his position, and his later
friendship with John.
Bishop Gailor's message to the con
gregation was:
"The best gift God gives a man is a
friend â€”one he can trust. Therefore,
we must be careful whom we accept
for our associates. There is not a word
or act of goodness which ever goes
begging. Simple goodness and its per
suasion lasts forever."
The choir sang: "O for the Wings
of a Dove," by Mendelssohn, with Miss
Candace C'aton as soloist.
