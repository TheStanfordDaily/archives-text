# CARNOT DEBATERS
## Will Be Chosen at Try-Outs in Chapel Tonight. 
### 
Try-outs for the Carnot Debating
Team will be held this evening in the
Chapel. The general subject which has
been chosen for this year's contest is
"Education in France Since 1900," but
all aspirants will meet at six o'clock,
two hours before the try-outs begin, to
secure the particular phase of this
question to be discussed. This is the
form in which the regular contest will
be conducted on April 9.
A team of three men will be chosen
from those who try-out. This team
will meet a similar aggregation from
California, in the Stanford Assembly
Hall, at which time the famous Carnot
medal will be awarded by the judges
to the best speaker. This medal, which
is extremely valuable and artistic, has
been won by a California man for the
past five years, and local debating en
thusiasts are making a special effort to
turn the tide this semester.
The try-outs are by no means secret,
and all who are interested are cordial
ly invited to be present in the chapel
this evening.
