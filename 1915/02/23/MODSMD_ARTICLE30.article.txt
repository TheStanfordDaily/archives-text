# Sonny at the Fair
## 
### 
Stanford, Feb. 23, 1915.
Dearest Ma.—None but the brave and
the rich deserve the fair, r went up
with a bunch yesterday morning to see
the races, but, like the action of the
Intercollegiate Disagreement Commit
tee, they were postponed. We got up
at 4:80 and took the milk t.rain, which
stopped wherever there was a cow or
milk bottle standing along the road.
After the races we started out to see
the exhibits and concessions. The
weather and the crowds were the
cheapest things to see. There were
people from all over the world, and
from Palo Alto. None of the conces
sions would take a check or open a
charge account, and as for the exhibits
—there were a bunch of them, but most
of them were with somebody. We al
most starved at noon time. After
standing in line for two hours we came
face to face with some food that tasted
as if it had been rejected by the Bel
gians. While standing 'n line I got in
to a scrap with a tough-looking guy
standing next to me. He lost his tem
per; I managed to keep mine, but lost
my watch. Don't let that bother you,—
it was father's old one. I have a new
dollar one that is just as good. The
papers had quite a lot to say about
the open'ng day, so I can im
agine what a fuss they must
make over the Dig Game. We came
home on the theatre train last night.
There are no berths on that train, but
every car is a sleeping ca,r. I am.not
neglecting my scholast'c duties. Accept
love from your SONNY.
P. S.—There's no use trying to drink
spilt milk —that watch's gone.
