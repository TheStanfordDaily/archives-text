# CREDIT SUGGESTED FDR READING OF CLASSICS
## 
### 
Professor W. H. Carruth, of the
English department, in a paper recent
ly read before his class in English
composition, discussed the lack of
knowledge and appreciation of the av
erage college stud nt for the classics
of English literature. He does not lay
the blame entirely on the student, but
attributes a great deal to the great
mass of current literature which now
occupies time previouly devoted to a
study of the classics.
As an inducement for the poorly
road student, Professor Carruth sug
gests that a credit course in reading
might be introduced to advantage. The
choice of books would bo somewhat
limited, yet the student will bo given a
large range from which to make his
selection. If three hours of credit
were given for the course it would en
tail six hours of reading in the Li
brary. In order that some approxi
mate record of the time spent by the
student might be kept it was humor
ously suggested that a clock, such as
employed in most factories, be in
stalled, so that one could .register his
own time.
