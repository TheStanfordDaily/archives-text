# E. B. KREHBIEL OUTLINES PRESENT WAR SITUATION
## COMMENDS NEUTRAL POSITION OF UNITED STATES. Speaker Attributes Flagrant Violations of International Law to "Imperious Necessity." 
### 
Professor E. B. Krehbiel, of the His
tory department graphically summar
ized the progress of the European war
to date in his talk at Encina Sunday
evening. Cleverly analyzing the con
dition of the belligerent nations, he
pointed out that "imperious necessi
ty" is the sole excuse offered for such
violations of international law as the
invasion of neutral Belgium by the
Germans at the outbreak of the war,
the detention of neutral ships by the
English and the German threats
against all shipping, neutral or other
wise, that ventures into the seas about
its coasts.
"Imperious necessity and interna
tional law make very poo.r bedfellows.
It will not be long until one or the
other is kicked out.
"The time has arrived when the neu
tral powers must enforce international
law. In civil life the non-combatants
have the rights; the fighter is punish
able by law. In international affairs
the belligerents are the ones who have
the rights; not the neutrals.
"The normal condition of nations in
modern times is the neutral condi
tions of peace.
"At present Germany holds 32,000
square miles of French and Belgian
territory; while the allies' combined
German holdings total 28,000 square
miles. But so unevenly is this divided
between the allies that a treaty of
peace is obviously impossible at this
time."
Professor Krehbiel summed up the
course that must be adopted by the
United States, in view of their connec
tion with the present struggle, as fol
lows:
"The United States must maintain
the rights of a neutral; it must reserve
the use of its flag for itself; and it
must j),reserve international law in
tact. as before the present struggle.
"The United States will be happier
and more prosperous if it avoids en
tangling alliances, and keeps aloof
from world politics."
Previous to Professor Krehbiel's
talk, N. C. Hanks, the blind, handless
entertainer, who has applied for the
privileges of the University, gave sev
eral readings of a varied nature, in
cluding Kipling's "If," through which
he expressed the emotion of one who
has struggled with and finally mas
tered a tremendous handicap.
It is expected that next Sunday ev
ening E. B. De Grott, formerly di
rector of the playgrounds for the city
of Chicago, and soon to take up the
same official position for the city of
San Francisco, will give a stereopti
con lecture in Encina Hall on "The
Greatest Public Recreation System
Since the Days of Athens and Rome."
Harris Weinstock has promised to
address the Sunday night Encina gath
ering on March 8. Mr. Weinstock is
of the Weinstock-Lubin Company, of
San Francisco, and lias been serving
for the past six months on the Federal
Industrial Relations committee, which
has been holding hearings all over the
country, from New York to San Fran
cisco, and recently completed its work
in New York, when Morgan and Rocke
feller appeared before it. The required
report to Congress has not yet been
made.
