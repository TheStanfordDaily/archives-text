### 
Holding the big end of a 34 to 2.">
score at the close of the basketball
contest between Stanford and St.
Mary's in Encina Gymnasium Friday
evening, Stanford tied Nevada for sec
ond place in the Intercollegiate
League. When the count had reached
that point—five minutes before time
was up—the captain of the St. Mary's
squad objected to the refereeing of
Templeton, and declared that his men
would forfeit the game. The referee
declared the game forfeited to Stan
ford.
Templeton was mutually agreed up
on by both fives to handle the
whistle in the absence of the league
referee, Boek, of Oakland, who failed
to appear. Throughout the game St.
Mary's found objection to the great
number of fouls that Templeton saw
fit to call. Rough playing on the vis
itors' part made this necessary. How
ever, the losers were not alone in
these offenses. Had they been accu
rate at shooting penalty baskets they
could have scored as great a number
of points through this medium as did
the winners.
The St. Mary's players have declared
their intention of protesting the game,
in which case the matter will be
placed before the six colleges of the
league.
No better brand of basketball has
been seen on the local court this year
than was served up Friday evening.
Each man found himself at his best,
which, coupled with efficient team
work, made the game a fast one.
The score at the end of the first
half was 20 to 19. favoring the home
team, and Indicates the closeness of
the struggle. Nine points were scored
on fouls by Stanford; seven by St.
Mary's. Hlodget, Worthy, Wallace,
Dolan, and Reynolds played the entire
contest for the Cardinals.
The last game of the season will be
played in Encina Saturday night, with
California opposing the Cardinal. The
Blue and Gold now leads the league. A
Stanford victory will mean a triple tie
between these two teams and Nevada.
