### 
It has been definitely decided that
within the next few days the office of
the Y. M. C. A. shall be moved to the
Union building. Arrangements have
been made for the Association to oc

which is to the right of the entrance,
directly on the street. This room will
be accessible to all members of the
student body, regardless of whether or
not they are members of the Union.
The reading room on the Quad will be
given up, and the new headquarters of
the Association may be used by all
men, as has been the present head
