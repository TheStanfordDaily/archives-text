# FIRE DRAWS VOLUNTEERS
## HOOF OF PROFESSOR RYAN'S HOME IS DAMAGED. Faculty Members and Students Succeed in Quelling Stubborn Blaze Sunday Evening. 
### 
Another appeal was made to the
campus volunteer fire department,
when flames were discovered shooting
from the roof of the home of Professor
H. J. Ryan, of the Electrical Engineer
ing department, Sunday evening. Calls
we.re almost simultaneously rushed
from the home of Professor E. P. Cub
berly and from the Phi Kappa Psi
house, on San Juan Hill. Owing to the
proximity of the fraternity house the
power house was ordered to blow their
number. In a short time a small
group, consisting chiefly of Faculty
members and a few students, were
rushing ladders and fire extinguishers
to the scene of action, while a number
Sf students from Lasuen and Salva
tierra streets were laborously drag
ging hose carts and chemical tanks up
San Juan Hill, thinking the fire to be
at the Phi Kappa Psi house.
The fire started from light burning
trash which had been carried from an
open fireplace and deposited on the
roof. It burned unobserved for some
time, and was well under way when
noticed by Professor Cubberly. Among
the first to take the initiative in extin
guishing the blaze were J. A. Gibb, '15,
and G. R. Smalley, '18, who, after se
curing ladders and reaching the roof,
exhausted three hand extinguishers he
fore aid was rendered by those man
ning the hose.
The only portion of the house suf
fering to any great extent was the
section of the roof upon which the
fire started, and a hole about eight feet
long and a foot and a half wide was
burned into the attic. Such damage as
was sustained was uncovered by insur
ance.
