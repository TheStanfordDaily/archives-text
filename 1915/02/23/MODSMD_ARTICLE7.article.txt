# DR. STILLMAN TO LEAD FOUNDERS' DM TOASTS
## VICF-PRESIDENT IS WELL-KNOWN AS AFTER-DINNER SPEAKER. PRICE PER PLATEâ€”ONE DOLLAR PROMINENT HONOR SOCIETIES TO AID IN ARRANGING PROGRAM. 
### 
Dr. John Maxon Stillman, Vice-Presi
dent of the University, and head of the
Chemistry department, has been chos
en by the committee in charge of the
Founders' Day dinner to preside as
toastmaster at the affair. Professor
Stillman is well-known to campus epi
cureans as a delightful after-dinner
speaker, and h's merry wit is expected
to blend harmoniously with the infor
mality of the occasion.
The price per plate has been re
duced to one dollar this year. The
first banquets were held in San Fran-

Cisco, and the fee was set at five and
three dollars. The Trustees and the
alumni, with a small representation of
members from the Faculty and stu
dent body gathered together for an
elaborate, formal program and ban
quet, and the affair was chiefly char
acterized by dignified solemnity.
Then the Alumni Association ar
ranged to give the banquet on the
campus, in order that the students
themselves might be able to partici
pate in the holiday. This transference
of the dinner brought about a change
in the character of the program at the
same time. From stilted ceremonial,


Dr. Stillman.
the affair passed to an informal cele
bration of the birthday of the celebrat
ed Founder of Stanford University.
To further this attitude on the part
of the students, the Alumni Associa
tion has placed the actual task of con
ducting the dinner and program in the
hands of four representative campus
bodies, The Governing Hoards of the
Stanford Union and tne Woman's Club
House, Cap and Gown, the honor so
ciety for women, and Skull and
Snakes, the men's honor society. The
dinner will be held in the Club House,
as previously announced. Every stu
dent is invited to be present at this
informal dinner, which is to be con
ducted probably in cafeteria stylfl,
and the very reasonable price of one
dollar a plate places the affair within
the reach of nearly every one.
E. C. Behrens, '14, president of Skull
and Snakes, has already appointed the
committee which will take charge of
the program and dance to be held af
ter the dinner in the Union. Tt. con

of the dinner brought about a change
in the character of the program at the
same time. From stilted ceremonial,


Dr. Stillman.
the affair passed to an informal cele
bration of the birthday of the celebrat
ed Founder of Stanford University.
To further this attitude on the part
of the students, the Alumni Associa
tion has placed the actual task of con
ducting the dinner and program in the
hands of four representative campus
bodies, The Governing Hoards of the
Stanford Union and tne Woman's Club
House, Cap and Gown, the honor so
ciety for women, and Skull and
Snakes, the men's honor society. The
dinner will be held in the Club House,
as previously announced. Every stu
dent is invited to be present at this
informal dinner, which is to be con
ducted probably in cafeteria stylfl,
and the very reasonable price of one
dollar a plate places the affair within
the reach of nearly every one.
E. C. Behrens, '14, president of Skull
and Snakes, has already appointed the
committee which will take charge of
the program and dance to be held af
ter the dinner in the Union. Tt. con
