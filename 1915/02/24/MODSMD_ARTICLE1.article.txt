# DR. BRANNER CONSIDERS PLANS OF GYM GROUNDS
## Physical Director Stolz Submits Sketch PLUNGE TO BE ROOFLESS Field South of Building Will Include Basketball and Tennis Courts and Open Air Drill Field 
### 
Tentative plans of the grounds of
the new gymnasium have been submit
ted lor approval of President Plan
ner by Physical Director H. R. Stolz.
If President Pranner approves of Dr.
Stolz's conception of the out-door fa
cilities of the gymnasium, the blue
print will be turned over to the Poard
of Trustees for approval.
The sketch submitted includes the
location of the swimming tank, the
basketball courts, the open-air drilling
field, the hedge and fence that is to
surround the enclosure, and the pro
posed necessary change in the course
of the drainage ditch that now cuts
diagonally across the field which may
be used for the gymnasium.
As Dr. Stolz has planned the
grounds, the hundred-foot plunge will
be located near the eastern end of the
Encina side of the gymnasium, bor
der.ng the road that leads to the foot
ball bleachers. This location will af
ford the maximum amount of sunlight.
The trees that now stand in this vi
cinity will have to be cut down. There
will be no roof over the tank, at least
for the present, because of the great
expenditure which this improvement
would cause.
On the Encina side of the new struc
ture will be located the drilling field
and the basketball courts. These are
included in a large rectangular area
that runs almost the entire length of
the building. A ditch that carries the
superfluous waters from that end of
the campus towa.nl Mayfield converts
this region into a marsh after every
shower. Steps will be taken to alter
the course of these waters so that
they will circle around the out-door
field, but still serve to irrigate the
hedge that will be planted. This hedge
will be of the variety that now stands
outside the track. Until the plant has
attained its growth, a fence will be
maintained to afford privacy to the
gymnasium squads.
