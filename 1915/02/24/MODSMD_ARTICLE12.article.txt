ternate, to represent Stanford in the
contest with California on April 9.
The debate, in which the famous Car
not medal is awarded to the best indi
vidual speaker, will be held in the lo
cal Assembly Hall this year.
Coyle is probably the most experi
enced undergraduate debater in the
University at the present time. He has
taken part in two previous Carnot
contests, has competed in the Bonn
heim discussion for the past three
years, as well as the Intercollegiate
Debate with California, and was on
the Tri-State team two years ago. He
is a member of the national debating
society, Delta Sigma Rho.
Hettinger has also had considerable
experience in debate. He represented
Stanford in the Carnot last year, was
a member of the Intercollegiate team
last semester, and took part in the in
terclass debate in his sophomore year.
He also belongs to Delta Sigma Rho.
El den debated on both the Fresh
man and Sophomore teams, and was
alternate in the Intercollegiate last
year.
Adams took part in the Bonnheim
discussion last year, and was also a
member of his Sophomore class team.

vade Washington University, while H.
It. English, '10, and J. W. Fribley, '10,
will meet Oregon here. G. W. Feni
mo.re, '17, is alternate.
These men, while they have thus
far had little part in Stanford foren
sics. have developed into very credit
able debaters during the practice of
the past few weeks, and they are ex
pected to put up a good fight for a
Cardinal victory.

will meet Oregon here. G. W. Feni

These men, while they have thus
far had little part in Stanford foren
sics. have developed into very credit
able debaters during the practice of
the past few weeks, and they are ex

Cardinal victory.
