Founders' Day, March 9th. To some
this means a holiday. To others, and
to the majority, it carries a far deeper
significance. Founders' Day is in cel
ebration of the birth of Senator Stan
ford. It is a time especially set aside
when all thoughts should be turned to
the deeds of the Founders' of the Uni
versity. It is not a day of mourning,
but one of rejoicing.
On the evening of March 9th the
annual Founders' Day banquet will be
held in the Women's Club House. This
is for Faculty, Trustees, alumni and
undergraduates. It is for women as
well as fo.r men.
In years past the banquet was held
in San Francisco. Formality, rather
than informality, reigned supreme.
But with the course of time affairs
have changed. Then it was that un
dergraduates did not feel a part of
this annual affair. The banquet was
formally conducted entirely by the
Alumni Association. Hut now it has
become an undergraduate, as well as
an alumni, gathering. Informality is
emphasized throughout the celebra
tion. The success of the banquet de
pends upon you. Every Stanford stu
dent should be present at this most
important event of the Stanford calen
dar. Members of Stanford communi
ty should spend March 9th on the
campus. And to make the day com
plete the banquet should be attended
by the largest representation in the
history of the annual gathering. He a
definite, integral part of Founders'
Day celebration.
