Stanford, Feb. 24, 1915.
Dearest Ma:—There's something on
my mind that I want to ask yon about
—the second step in this campus
beautiful campaign we're having. The
first step was the filling up of the big
mud hole back of the Library. The
second happened the other day when
the statue of the folks who got the
hunch for this University was torn
down from the Memorial Court and
carted over to our old curiosity shop,
the Museum. At least, that's what
the paper said. I hear there's a lot
of mystery about the moving—nobody
saw it go, and the workmen who took
it away refuse to own up because they
are union men. and were not supposed
to wo.rk on Saturday afternoon. It was
a holiday, too. I can't imagine how
and why they got them to work that
day. And I am wondering why the
statue was moved at all—the paper
said it obstructed the view from the
Memorial Church, and that our fierce
climate was too much for it. Well,
nobody was holding an umbrella in
the statue, but then it wasn't made
out of sugar. The only .reason I can
see for tearing it down is because Mr.
and Mrs. Stanford were not wearing
clothes stylish enough to be in har
mony with the campus beautiful cam
paign. Well, being as how they in
vented Stanford, that mistake might
be overlooked. The clothes they're
wearing will probably be back in style
in a year or so, anyway. I thought
you might be interested in this be
cause you once told me to always be
loyal. Wasn't it Waslvngton in his
Farewell address who said, "Should
old acquaintances be forgot?" Affec
tionately with love, SONNY.
