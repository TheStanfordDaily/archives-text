While on his recent trip East Pro
fessor C. D. Ma,rx, of the Civil Engin
eering department, met many of the
older Stanford graduates who are now
carrying on their work in and about
New York.
Among those now of importance iu
the engineering circles of the East are
A. W. Cuddeback, '93, Earle Talbot, '01,
and H. S. Warren, '98. Cuddeback, a
transfer from Cornell, now holds the
position of superintendent of the East
Jersey Water Company, by which he
has been employed for some time. Tal

New York. Just recently he has moved
to New York City, where he will take
charge of the construction of the ter
minals of the canal.
H. S. Warren, '98, received his de
gree from the Electrical Engineering
department four years after entering
college. Since then he has been em
ployed by both the Western Union Tel
egraph Company and the Bell Tele
