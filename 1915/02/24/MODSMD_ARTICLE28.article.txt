# BISHOP TALKS TO SORORITY WOMEN
## Object of Co-education Is Subject of Lecture 
### 
Bishop Gailor delivered the fourth
of his series of addresses to campus
res'dents last night, speaking to the
sorority women on "Religion and So
ciety.' He spoke first on the subject
of amusements, pointing out that the
demand for amusement of some kind
is a demand of human nature, but con
trasted the liking for amusement after
labor, with the habit of amusement.
He put the question: "What is the
meaning of an institution like ours?"
and : n answering, said:
"It has been said that education is
being worked to death. This is an un
truth. Life itself is an education; it
determines what a person really is.
"The.re are three qualities which
our women should acquire through
education and university life: first,
truth, embodying directness, honesty,
and simplicity, for to be a truth-seek
er and truth-sayer means to be accu
rate, and to have the knowledge of de
tail and facts: second, appreciation,
which is the capacity to understand,
the faculty which transfers the hum
ble dwelling place into a fairy palace;
third, faith, which is the power to be
lieve in ou.rselves."
Mrs. Allan introduced the speaker,
in the absence of Dr. Gardner. After
the address the women remained in
the Club House for a social gather
ing.
