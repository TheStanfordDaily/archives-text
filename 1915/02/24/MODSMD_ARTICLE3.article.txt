# PROFESSOR COOVER HAS HUNCH THAT HUNCHES ARE N. G.
## 
### 
Laboring under the contention that
the value of that preconceived no
tion of futurity known as "the hunch"
is nil, the Psychology department, un
der the direction of Professor J. E.
Coover, is experimenting to prove
their theory. Professor Coover has his
students sit before tables and record
the card they are expected to draw.
The records of many successive trials
are kept, the results of which are
showing that the so-called hunch of
the card player has absolutely nothing
to do with the cards he actually draws.
So if you believe in the hunchâ€”
that invisible, uncontrollable unfath
omable bit of something that tells you
of the future, you are suffering from a
delusion of the worst type. If you put
faith in the mere notion that because
you found a wishbone in your ice
cream you will draw an "A" in your
next "exam," and you are a dreamer. A
this because the psychology depart
ment has a very strong hunch that
there is really no such thing as a
hunch!
