# Junior-Senior Jolly-Up Set For Encina March 12
## Sophomore-Freshman Get-Together to Be Held in Women's Club House Same Evening. 
### 
Plans for the Junior-Senior jolly
up, on March 12, are rapidly being
perfected. The informal affair will be
held in Encina, instead of in the Stan
ford Union, as first planned, in order
to accommodate the large number of
couples expected to attend.
The Sophomore-Freshman jolly-up
is to be held on the same evening in
the newly-completed Women's Club
House.
Arrangements have been made with
the Registrar's office, by which the
date has been closed for all other cam
pus affairs. This is the first time that
all the classes have held their jolly
ups on the same evening. The last
closed date for a jolly-up was on the
occasion of the visit of the Waratahs
to the campus in 1913. It is hoped by
closing the books for all other campus
dates that it will be possible for ev
ery one to attend. The jolly-up, which
is distinctively a Stanford custom, has
suffered lately from competition with
other affairs, and the committee hopes
to make the next two informal dances
unusually enjoyable "get-togethers"
for the four classes.
The Junior and Senior committees
will meet at the end of the week to
conclude plans for original stunts.
