English Club announces the cast of
"Sherwood" as the culmination of a
lengthy "try-out" period, during which
exceptional care has been used in the
selection of players for the various
roles. Alfred Noyes' beautiful five-act
tragedy, which pictures the romantic

tale of Robin Hood and h's merry men
of Sherwood Forest in dramatic scenes
of poetic beauty and sylvan charm,
will be produced in the open air upon
a natural stage in the grounds of the
old Stanford estate April 23. Over
125 people will appear in the play,
which promises to eclipse all former

efforts in brilliance of costuming and
scenic effects. Although twenty-one
playe.rs are cast in the more import
ant roles, several minor characters
have yet to be assigned. Professor L.
E. Bassett, of the English department,
is directing the rehearsals of the pro
duction, which will attract interest
not merely local.
The leading role of "Robin Hood,"
Earl of Huntingdon, will be played by
Frank Price, '13, whose experience in
simila.r productions will be of inesti
mable benefit to him in "Sherwood."
Price possesses a voice peculiarly well
adapted to outdoor work, and is phys
ically fitted to cope with the exacting
demands of "Robin Hood."
"Maid Marian,' the heroine of the
drama, will have a charming interpre
ter in Miss Richard Borough, '14, who
has won no little distinction through
her artistic work in several local dra
matic successes. Miss Borough made
her campus debut in her sophomore
comedy, "Christopher Junior," in
which she scored in a delightful in
genue role. Later she won decided
approval as "Lucy Manette" in "The
Only Way," and last year made a sub-
