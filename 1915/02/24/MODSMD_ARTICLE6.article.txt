English Club announces the cast of
"Sherwood" as the culmination of a
lengthy "try-out" period, during which
exceptional care has been used in the
selection of players for the various
roles. Alfred Noyes' beautiful five-act
tragedy, which pictures the romantic

tale of Robin Hood and h's merry men
of Sherwood Forest in dramatic scenes
of poetic beauty and sylvan charm,
will be produced in the open air upon
a natural stage in the grounds of the
old Stanford estate April 23. Over
125 people will appear in the play,
which promises to eclipse all former

efforts in brilliance of costuming and
scenic effects. Although twenty-one
playe.rs are cast in the more import
ant roles, several minor characters
have yet to be assigned. Professor L.
E. Bassett, of the English department,
is directing the rehearsals of the pro
duction, which will attract interest
not merely local.
The leading role of "Robin Hood,"
Earl of Huntingdon, will be played by
Frank Price, '13, whose experience in
simila.r productions will be of inesti
mable benefit to him in "Sherwood."
Price possesses a voice peculiarly well
adapted to outdoor work, and is phys
ically fitted to cope with the exacting
demands of "Robin Hood."
"Maid Marian,' the heroine of the
drama, will have a charming interpre
ter in Miss Richard Borough, '14, who
has won no little distinction through
her artistic work in several local dra
matic successes. Miss Borough made
her campus debut in her sophomore
comedy, "Christopher Junior," in
which she scored in a delightful in
genue role. Later she won decided
approval as "Lucy Manette" in "The
Only Way," and last year made a sub-


Miss Borough
stantial hit as quaint "Susan Thros
sel" in the Masquers' production of
"Quality Street." "Maid Marian" will
offer Miss Borough many opportuni
ties to display her talent in an entire
ly new dramatic frame.
Miss Nellita Choate, '17, will portray
a role of equal importance, though of
a very different character, as "Queen
Elinor." The portrayal of the pas
sions and intrigues of this haughty
queen demands real acting gifts, which
Miss Choate possesses in abundance.
"Queen Elinor" will furnish Miss
Choate with her first local opportunity
for effective acting, and she promises
to make a memorable impression. She
made her local debut last year in Bar
rie's "Quality Street" as the eccentric
"Miss Willoughby," a comparatively
small role, to which she lent distinc
tion. Last semester she repeated her
success in a totally different character
in the Sward and Sandals production
of "Men and Women."
E. L. House, '14, will be seen to ad
vantage in the heavy role, "Prince
John," for which he is well adapted.
House won praise last year in the
Senior farce, "Our Wives."
"Shadow-of-a-Leaf," a veritable star
role, will be in the hands of Gordon
Davis, '18, whose experience on the
professional stage augurs well for his
success in this difficult part. Davis
has toured both the Orpheum and
Pantages circuits in original vaude
ville sketches, and has been associated
with the stock companies of Oliver
Morosco in Los Angeles, Ye Liberty
Theatre in Oakland, and acted as stage
manager in Spokane. The light, fan
tastic quality demanded by "Shadow
of-a-Leaf" will be interpreted with de
cided skill by Davis, who is considered
a dramatic "find."
Miss Marion Vaughan, '16, and Miss
Nancy Lee Willard, '18, will play
"Oberon"and "Titania," king and queen
of the faries. Miss Vaughan has had
experience in former Junior Operas,
and appeared to advantage in "Men
and Women," in a vivacious comedy
role. Miss Willard has won success in
open-air performances in the South.
Miss Nana Stevick, '17, will make
her dramatic debut in the delightful
role of "Puck," while Miss Lucile Cur
tis, '15, will make an attractive figure
as Marian's maid, "Jenny."
J. H. Russell, '17, will appear to par
ticular advantage as "Little John," a
.role to which he is ideally suited. Rus
sell scored his initial success in Quali
ity Street" last year. A. D. Burkett,
'17, will have another amusing comedy
role as "Much," the miller's son, and
companion to "Little John."
H. M. Stanley, '17, will vocalize
"Alan-a-Dale' and J. W. Bennett, '15,
will appear in a similar role as the
king's minstrel, "Blondel.' Stanley
scored decidedly in the 1915 Junior
Opera and in his Sophomore comedy,
"Ready Money," last semester, while
Bennett won approval in the lead in
the 1913 Junior Opera.
Miss Erna Taylor, '16, is cast in the
pleasing role of the "Prioress," and
Miss Alice McDougal, '16, will portray
the "Widow Scarlet."
Rehearsal times will be posted on
the bulletin board of Professor Bas
sett's office in the future.
Two performances of "Sherwood"
are planned, the dates selected being
Friday, April 23, and Saturday, April
24, .respectively. Special arrange
ments will be made with the Southern
Pacific Company for the transporta
tion of San Franciscans and Exposi
tion visitors to the campus, while the
second performance will bo of special
interest to the students of the schools
of the peninsula.
