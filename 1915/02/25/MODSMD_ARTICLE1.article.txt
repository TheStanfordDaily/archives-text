Race to End in Triple Tie
FANS ASSURED REAL BATTLE
Californ a's stellar collection of
basket-shooters will invade Stanford
territory Saturday night to fight to re
tain the high position in the Intercol
legiate League that the Mine and Gold
now holds. California's rise to first

place came a' out through their 27 to
17 defeat <!' tV: Nevadan quintet,
which had l'orcd Stanford to take the
small end of of i 51 to 29 score two
weeks ago. California has not been
defeated at baa' ■ t"»• all this season, and
brings a sound w II capable of defend
ing her posit'o". Stanford has met
defeat but onco this yeir, at the hands
of Nevada. Moth the Cardinal and the
Blue and Gold bave been victors over
St. Mary's, College of the Pacific and
St. Ignatius.
In the event o 1 " a Cardinal victory
Saturday evening, California, Nevada,
and Stanford will bo tied for first
place in the Intercollegiate League.
Should the visiters take the best of the
score, it will leave the two last-men
tioned school's neck and neck for sec
ond honors.
Captain Reynolds put his men
through stiff practice last night in
Encina Gymnasium. A short, game be
tween a five composed wholly of first
team men, and a mixed quintet,
showed an abundance of "pep" and
snap in the work of the experienced
men. Blortgel. Worthy, Wallace, Do
lan, and Reynolds formed the varsity
squad. In last Friday's game with St.
Mary's this combination produced the
snappiest con test seen this year on
the local court. The recent improve
ment in the work of the basket men
speaks well for giving California a
hard tussle.
Final practice for Saturday's game
will be held tonight. Captain Rey
nolds will announce his line-up to
morrow. No referee has been selected
«'is yet; it is probable that a San .Tose
or Bay City man will be chosen. Tlip
contest with California will wind up
the Intercollegiate series fo.r the sea
son, each school of the six entered in
the race having met the other five.
Th« Graduate Manager's office an
nounces that season tirkets will not be
honored at tomorrow night's game. An
admission fee of 25 cents will be
charged.


Captain Reynolds.
