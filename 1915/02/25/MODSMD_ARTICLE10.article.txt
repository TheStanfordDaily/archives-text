Talented Dorsetshire Trio Will
Present Many Ballads of Early
Anglo-Saxon Folk Lore in
Their Quaint Victoria Setting
SEATS ON SALE TOMORROW
Great interest is being manifested in
the coining recital of the Misses Doro
thy, Rosalind, and Cynthia Fuller,
which will he held in the Assembly
Hall on Tuesday evening, March 2, un
der the auspices of the Faculty Com
mittee on Entertainment. Many of the
songs of their repetroire are well
known; many more are totally un
known in this country, except as they
are sung by these delightful singers.
Their performance will be one of the
musical events of the season.
When they sing the old English bal
lads and folk-songs that they learned
on the other side of the ocean, they
compel their audiences to acknowl
edge that there is a warmth, a charm,
a sincerity about the melodies which is
utterly lack'ng in more pretentious
music. The daintiness, sweetness, the
unaffected grace of their offerings is
matched only by the picture they them
selves make in the English costumes
of the early Victorian period.
Some of the most interesting songs
in their repertoire are those which
proceed in dialogue. Of all the wealth
of English folk-songs brought to the
surface by industrious collectors and
editors during recent years the dia
logue songs are the least known. Near
ly all of them a.ve tiny dramas, primi
tive perhaps, naive always, but full of
humor, and with an occasional insight
into human nature which found its
culm'nation in Shakespeare, Marlow,
and Fletcher, and through them made
England lead the world of drama.
Old English ballads, of which the
Fuller sisters make a feature, were
much more commonly found a century
ago than they are today. Many of the
old collections are by no means com
plete, and never include the music. As
the collectors of ancient ballads they
diffe.v from most seekers of this sort,
in that they have always striven to se
cure the music to which the ballads
were originally sung.
The sale of seats for the concert on
March 2 will commence at the Stan
ford Bookstore and at Weingartner's
drug store on Friday, Februarv 26.
