# LETTER FROM GERMANY GIVES TEUTON'S VIEW
## TELLS OF CONDITIONS IN THE EMPIRE. Miles of Different Nationalities Quarrel in Kaiser's Prison Camp. 
### 
A letter dated January 20, from
Magdeburg, Germany, depicting the
horrors of the war, and describing ac
tual conditions at present in the Fath
erland, has been received by B. 11.
Xordmann, '17, from his sister, who is
serving as a Red Cross nurse in the
army of the Kaiser. The epistle points
out sonic interesting facts of the world
conflict as yet imprinted in American
newspapers.
"For several months I have been
stationed in an isolated hospital near
the large base hospital of Magdeburg,
where we are treating typhoid fever,
diphtheria, and poisoned wounds. The
most numerous and worst cases are
those of typhoid fever, which the
troops bring from Poland 011 account
of the bad sanitary conditions. Scores
have died under our care. There are
all kinds of soldiers and ranks of of
ficers stationed here, both friends and
enemies. We have cared for Ger
mans, Austrians, Hungarians, French,
Belgians, English Zuaves, and Hindus.
The most striking thing is that the
Belgians, British, and French find it
impossible to get along together. Each
accuses the other of leaving the other
in the lurch, or not having fought
hard enough. In the neighborhood
where the prison camp is located, two
bloody riots broke out, which had to
be quelled by our own troops. How
different are our soldiers, harmonizing
with the Austrians like brothers.
"The first wounded we received at
the beginning of the war were terribly
mangled. By the use of the dreadful
dum-dum bullets, whole joints, nerves,
and muscles were laid bare, caused by
the large holes torn by these m'ssiles.
Our enemies also had large wounds,
but not as poisonous as the wounds of
our troops. Of course, we were com
pelled to amputate their limbs in or
der to save them, but numbers died
under our care. After the Kaiser pro
tested to President Wilson, none of
those awful bullets have been used.
No doubt you have read all about.this
protest.
"Of course, you will read a great
deal concerning the war, particularly
English reports. But let them continue
to lie and abuse us, there are no brav
er troops on land or sea than our sol
diers. This the enemies concede, and,
if not openly, they secretly admit it.
How victoriously did our troops ad
vance into France and Poland, unto
the very gates of Paris and Warsaw.
And our submarines undertake dan
gerous exploits, and our aeroplanes
and Zeppelins soar death-defying
above the clouds. How happily do our
troops relate the hardships of their
campaigns, and how joyfully do thoy
return to the front. Such a spirit can
not be conquered, and I honestly be
lieve that we are slowly, but surely
winning the war.
"But one feels the war, even if one
is living in comparative quiet, for the
prices of necessities are rising. Coal
and oil arc 110 longer to be had. and
various other economic measures have
been adopted by our government. But
we cannot be thankful enough that the
war is not raging in our territory,
but instead in that of the enemy. We
only have to look at a small piece of
East Prussia, which the Russians in
vaded at the beginning of the war,
where every living thing is completely
obliterated. I low much worse must
France, Belgium, and Poland have suf
fered where the armies have passed
over and fought their battles. All our
troops write concerning the terrible
distress which is rampant in Belgium
and France. Large crowds of freezing
women and children surround the
cam]) of our soldiers and ask them for
bread. Our troops supply the hungry
as long as they can, and then offer to

share their rations with them. Y r es,
they do more! All orphaned children
whose parents have died either in hon
orable warfare or as "snipes" are
taken by prominent families in Ger
many and cared for. An officer from
here, whose wife went as far as Co
logne to visit her husband, has
brought back with him a little orphan,
which is to be educated and reared by
his wife. Such is the work our troops
are doing, and then they call us
"Huns." But what do we care, if our
conscience is clear?
"Brother George visited some rela
tives in Hamburg, and he relates that
the entire River Elbe is now covered
with torpedo boats, destroyers, and
large submarines. Thousands of men
are working day and night to con
struct more, and everything points in
the direction that all is in readiness
for the blockade of the English and
French seacoasts. ANTONIA."

A letter dated January 20, from
Magdeburg, Germany, depicting the
horrors of the war, and describing ac
tual conditions at present in the Fath
erland, has been received by B. 11.
Xordmann, '17, from his sister, who is
serving as a Red Cross nurse in the
army of the Kaiser. The epistle points
out sonic interesting facts of the world
conflict as yet imprinted in American
newspapers.
"For several months I have been
stationed in an isolated hospital near
the large base hospital of Magdeburg,
where we are treating typhoid fever,
diphtheria, and poisoned wounds. The
most numerous and worst cases are
those of typhoid fever, which the
troops bring from Poland 011 account
of the bad sanitary conditions. Scores
have died under our care. There are
all kinds of soldiers and ranks of of
ficers stationed here, both friends and
enemies. We have cared for Ger
mans, Austrians, Hungarians, French,
Belgians, English Zuaves, and Hindus.
The most striking thing is that the
Belgians, British, and French find it
impossible to get along together. Each
accuses the other of leaving the other
in the lurch, or not having fought
hard enough. In the neighborhood
where the prison camp is located, two
bloody riots broke out, which had to
be quelled by our own troops. How
different are our soldiers, harmonizing
with the Austrians like brothers.
"The first wounded we received at
the beginning of the war were terribly
mangled. By the use of the dreadful
dum-dum bullets, whole joints, nerves,
and muscles were laid bare, caused by
the large holes torn by these m'ssiles.
Our enemies also had large wounds,
but not as poisonous as the wounds of
our troops. Of course, we were com
pelled to amputate their limbs in or
der to save them, but numbers died
under our care. After the Kaiser pro
tested to President Wilson, none of
those awful bullets have been used.
No doubt you have read all about.this
protest.
"Of course, you will read a great
deal concerning the war, particularly
English reports. But let them continue
to lie and abuse us, there are no brav
er troops on land or sea than our sol
diers. This the enemies concede, and,
if not openly, they secretly admit it.
How victoriously did our troops ad
vance into France and Poland, unto
the very gates of Paris and Warsaw.
And our submarines undertake dan
gerous exploits, and our aeroplanes
and Zeppelins soar death-defying
above the clouds. How happily do our
troops relate the hardships of their
campaigns, and how joyfully do thoy
return to the front. Such a spirit can
not be conquered, and I honestly be
lieve that we are slowly, but surely
winning the war.
"But one feels the war, even if one
is living in comparative quiet, for the
prices of necessities are rising. Coal
and oil arc 110 longer to be had. and
various other economic measures have
been adopted by our government. But
we cannot be thankful enough that the
war is not raging in our territory,
but instead in that of the enemy. We
only have to look at a small piece of
East Prussia, which the Russians in
vaded at the beginning of the war,
where every living thing is completely
obliterated. I low much worse must
France, Belgium, and Poland have suf
fered where the armies have passed
over and fought their battles. All our
troops write concerning the terrible
distress which is rampant in Belgium
and France. Large crowds of freezing
women and children surround the
cam]) of our soldiers and ask them for
bread. Our troops supply the hungry
as long as they can, and then offer to

share their rations with them. Y r es,
they do more! All orphaned children
whose parents have died either in hon
orable warfare or as "snipes" are
taken by prominent families in Ger
many and cared for. An officer from
here, whose wife went as far as Co
logne to visit her husband, has
brought back with him a little orphan,
which is to be educated and reared by
his wife. Such is the work our troops
