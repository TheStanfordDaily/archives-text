# NEGRO KNIFE-WIELDER UP FOR PRELIMINARY HEARING
## Judge Finds Evidence Warrants Turning Prisoner Over to Superior Court for Trial. 
### 
The preliminary hearing of James
Susks, the negro cook, who attacked
VV. E. Licking, '17, with a butcher
knife at the Acacia house, January 25,
was held before Judge S. W. Charles,
in Palo Alto Wednesday afternoon.
U. A. Sontheimer, '12, appeared as
counsel for the defendant. The testi
mony of E. F. Neill. '13, and the exhibit
of a vicious looking, two-foot butcher
knife, was sufficient to cause Judge
Charles to order the prisoner bound
over to the Superior court of Santa
Clara county for trial. The case will
come up within two months.
