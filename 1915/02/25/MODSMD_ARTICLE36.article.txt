# TROPHIES TO BE MOVED
## Prizes Will Be Transferred to Stanford Union Executive Committee Names Dr. Stolz to Start Agitation For Installation of Handball Courts 
### 
The Executive Committee made defi
nite arrangements last evening for
the moving or the trophy case
which is at present kept in the
lower seminar room of the Li
brary, to the club room of the Stan
ford Union. It is believed that more
interest would be taken in these prizes
if they were placed in a more-fre
quented place.
Vice-President T. E, Workman, '14,
urged the advisability of having hand
ball courts in the new gymnasium, in
accordance with the original plan,
which made room for two such courts
and it was decided to appoint Dr.
Stolz to confer with President Bran
ner and the Board of Trustees in re
gard to their installation.
Discussion was held regarding the
desirability of entering a Stanford
float in the Big C Sirkus, on a motion
which held the matter over from last
meeting. It is doubtful whether the
Executive Committee will pursue the
matter further.
Following are the minutes:
