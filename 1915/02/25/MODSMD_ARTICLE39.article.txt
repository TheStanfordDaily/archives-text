# HETCH-HETCHY PROJECT
## Is Subject of a Talk by Professor Durand San Francisco Will Be Able to Develop Sufficient Water For a City of Ten Times Its Size 
### 
Professor W. F. Durand, of the Me
chanical Engineering department, a
well-known specialist on water power,
delivered a lecture before an audi
ence of Faculty members and students
in the Faculty Club House last night
on the Hetch-Hetehy project of the
city of San Francisco.
"Water has," said Professor Durand,
"always represented, with men, an in
sistent demand, especially after the
founding of towns. In cities this daily
demand averages one hundred gallons
per individual. The demand for pow
er, since the beginning of cities, has
not been so insistent, although now,
with our great amount of machinery,
it does exceed that for water.
"It is found that water at a height
of 6000 feet will answer both of these
demands. But because distance uses
up much of the power capable of be
ing generated by the drop and because
most of our water does not come from
such a height, our demand for power
has far outrun that, which can be made
available from water developed for the
needs of a city. Therefore, to get pow
er, a city will bring down more water
than is needed for city purposes, and
lease it out to the surrounding coun
try for irrigation purposes.
"In the present Hetch-Hetchy pro
ject. there are only two points at which
it will be worth while installing ma
chines for the development of power,
the chief one being at Priest's Hill. If
Lake Eleanor and Cherry Creek were
developed more hydro-electric power
could be generated.
"Although there are many claims for
the water of the Hetch-Hetchy pre
ceding that of San Francisco, it is
found that even in dry years San Fran
cisco will have more than a plenty of
water after these prior claims have
been satisfied.
"The maximum which it is expect
ed may lie obtained from the project
is 620 second feet, or about 400,000,000
gallons per day, enough for a city of
4.000,000 inhabitants. The problem
is not so much one of how much water
can be gotten, but of how much can be
stored.
"The principal dam will be 300 feet
high ,and will back water up for a dis
tance of ten miles, having a total vol
ume of 100,000,000,000 cubic feet.
"The net available drop for the de
velopment of power is 1250 feet. This
will develop much more power than
San Francisco will want, but the city
will develop, on the average, 80,000
kilowatt hours.
"The value of a power developing
plant is based upon its peak load ca
pacity, the amount which it can de
velop. However, the demand for pow
er in a city is during the day generally
less than half the amount needed at
the time of greatest o,emand. Because
commerce makes rapid and fluctuating
demands upon the power system, it is
necessary to develop very complicated
and expensive machinery. The adjust
ing reservoir is one of the means used
to meet at all times both the demands
for water and power."
