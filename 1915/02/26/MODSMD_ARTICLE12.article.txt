Nine men will wear the Cardinal to
morrow night in Encina Gymnasium,

when California
trots on the court
to fight for the
championship of
the Intercollegi
ate Bask etb a 11
League. Captain

named Wort h y
and Blodget for
the forward posi
tions with Schwar
zenbek as substi
tute. Wallace has
been picked for
center, with
Wheatly ready to
act in his stead.

Caughey has bee i

if. tJimigei, I't

chosen as substitute guard. Dntton
will be in a suit, to play either center
or guard, if needed.
Practice yesterday afternoon shewed
the squad to be in good form. W.hcHily,
who has been playing with the s cond
team, was putin with ihe varsity
squad and proved himself to be an
adept, center, and an accurate basket
shooter. During the last week Wheat
ly has shown considerably improved
form. He will prove valuable, should
California bring an unusually tall
center. Schwarzenbek has recently
bettered his stride and played to ad
vantage as guard and with the ball
yesterday.
Schwarzenbek formerly captained
the fast Lick high quintet. Dutton has
shown himself to be an all-around
man. working equally well as center
o.r guarding the basket. Throughout
the season Dolan has made a name for
himself as a stellar defense man. The
star work of Reynolds at guard, and
the fast forward combination of Wor
thy and Blodget are well known to lo
cal fans.
Captain Reynolds last night ex
pressed his confidence in the ability
of his men to withstand the Blue and
Gold attack. "We have a fighting
chance." lie declared. "Every man will
fight as hard as he can."
A victory for Stanford will not mean
a Cardinal championship, but will re
sult in a triple tie between California,
Stanford, and Nevada. On the other
band, if the visitors take the game the
league title will go to California, who

has not lost a contest this year.
The invading players are veterans of
the basket game. Morton and Sharpe
will be seen as forwards. Morton has
been playing for a number of years
j on the crack Oakland Y. M. C. A. quin
j tot. Sharpe is a football man, but
I has been playing with the California
! 145-pound five this season. McKay,
the Blue and Gold center, is an old
tinier at the game, and was seen in ac
j tion against Stanford last year. House,
j Mayo, and Embry have been named as
' guards. The first two named are new
in Berkeley basketball circles. Emb.ry
