# SINCERE TRIBUTE
## 
### 
In reverence to the memory of Mrs.
Jane Lathrop Stanford, who died ten
years ago next Sunday, a memorial
service will be held in the Memorial
Church 011 that day. Any tribute that
we can pay the noble woman who gave
her all for us should be done, unhesi
tatingly. We should one and all attend
the services on Sunday, as a slight,
but sincere token of our respect and
reverence.
