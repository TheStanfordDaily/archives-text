Credit for reading classics of English
literature is one of the most practical
suggestions that has ever been of
fered in any of the departments. Pro
fessor Carruth's suggestion that a
credit course might be introduced to
advantage is certain without a doubt.
Under the present system of granting
credits a student's time is occupied
practically all the time with assign
ments, and, as a result, he has very
little opportunity to become conver
sant with the classics. This is especial
ly true of the students registered in
departments, other than English.
There are very few who will not ac
knowledge their almost absolute ig
norance of classic literature. If cred
its were given in such a course and a
diversity of books offered, with sug
gestions as to their value in literature,
no student would have an excuse for
his lack of knowledge and appreciation
of English classics.
