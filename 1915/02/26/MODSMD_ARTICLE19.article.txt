# SINKING AMERICAN VESSELS MIGHT BE DONE PURPOSELY

### 
"Il iin American vessel is sunk in the
'war zone' it will have been done
knowingly. Such a thine might be
planned, perhaps, for the purpose of
drawing America Into the war, tliiil
(■crniany might take the position of
tiie 'under dog.'"
This was the statement made
by Chancellor Jordan yesterday
to The Daily Palo Alto in an interview
upon the present crisis in interna
tional affairs, and the attitude that
the administration of the United
States has taken in the war that has
embroiled Europe.
"Germany might claim," declared
Dr. Jordan, "that in the face of an
envious world, 'suborned by British
gold,' she did her best fo,r order in Eu
rope and for peace, laid down her
arms before superior forces. It is also
barely possible that the German gov
ernment would like to see America en
gaged, because a better settlement
could be made if democratic America
were an opponent, than could be made
with France, Russia, and England.
This is all supposition, but it will look
like the truth if an American vessel
is sunk.
"If Germany feels that she is fail
ing, it is not at all probable that she
will want to see the "United States
drawn in on the other s'de, as the
United States cannot possibly be
drawn in on her side. If we plunge
into the war, the chance of settlement
would come sooner, and would be
more favorable to Germany, but ter
ribly ruinous to us as a democracy, as
we are a hundred million emperors,
each one with his share of personal
.responsibilities, and it would take a
long time before our polif.es would lie
free from confusion and hatred."
In reply to a question in regard to
the progress of the war during the
past month of German naval activity,
and the real value of the route of the
Russian forces, Chancellor Jordan
said:
"Since the checking of the German
advance on Paris, nothing critical has
been done, and probably nothing can
be expected; the forces engaged are
too large. Starvation is not war, and
is a dangerous weapon for any nation

to use, and likely to fail at the end.
It is a mistake to prevent neutral food
from going to any nation.
"There is no violation of neutrality
in sending arms or food to Europe.
'1 here is no international law nor na
tional law to prevent it, and the Presi
dent could not prevent it legally, if he
would. There is an international law
against selling ships, but not arms.
The United States does not sell these
things, it is individuals that sell them.
This is a nation of Individuals in
which the govenment looks out fo.r
justice among them, but which can
not control them except in accordance
with law. The nations of Europe are
now under martial law, and individu
als have no rights. Some of them are
so all the time.
"It might be well if a law prohibit
ing the sale of armament from one na
tion to another had been made before
■the war. Such a law, however, taking
away private profit from individuals,
would have this drawback —it would
play into the hands of nations which
had collected great quantities of such
materials before the war. Such a law
could not be passed now on the broad
principle of not swapping horses In
the middle of the stream; it would be
a strictly partisan measure for the
benefit of the nations farthest off."
A question as to his views on the
attitude of the present administration,
was answered by Dr. Jordan as fol
lows :
"The course the President is pursu
ing is above reproach, but it lies un
der great difficulties. Another man
in the President's place would either
have done substantially the same
thing, or else things less wise. Most
men worthy to be called statesmen
would follow the same course. On the
whole, it is approved by the people.
"The United States should, above
all, keep out of the war, and keep
itself neutral, possibly even if it has
to put up with some very disagreeable
th'ngs. We should never talk of any
thing in terms of war. The strength
of Abraham Lincoln came in counting
the cost, and taking the thing that had
the least ruin attached to it."
