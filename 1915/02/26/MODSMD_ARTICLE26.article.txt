# GRADUATE OF COLLEGE OF HARD KNOCKS WILL SPEAK TO ENCINA MEN
## Arthur Arlett, of San Francisco, Is Secured for Regular Sunday Night program. 
### 
The speaker secured for the Encina
Hall meeting this Sunday evening is
Arthur Arlett, a contractor and build
er, of San Francisco, who has directed
the construction of some of the largest
structures in the Bay region, and who
is known as one of the state's leaders
in welfare movements.
Mr. Arlett is not a college man, but
has risen in his work handicapped by
the disadvantage of having received
less than a complete grammar school
education. He will speak as a graduate
from the "university of hard knocks,"
and what he says will have the stamp
of experience of many years in direct
ing the work of builders.
It is not yet known what his subject
will be, but he has been asked to speak
largely out of his personal experience
as a contractor and builder.
Among the latest buildings con
structed by Mr. Arlett are the Shattuck
Hotel, in Berkeley, and the "flat-iron"
building in Oakland, the Pilgrim Con
gregational church of Oakland, and
the high school of that city. He is one
of the commissioners of the Panama-
Pacific Exposition, president of the
Oakland Welfare League, and a lead
er in the progressive party movement
in the state. The meeting, which is
s heduled to commence at 7:30, will be
characterized by the usual informality
of the Eneina Sunday evening gather
ings. All men of the Pniversity are in
vited to attend.
On the evening of Sunday, March 7,
Harris Weinstock, of the Federal In
dustrial Commission will talk on in
dustrial problems, and on the follow
ing Sunday evening the new director
of the San Francisco playgrounds, E.
B. DeGroot, will be the speaker.
