# RUNNERS WILL GO ENTIRE DISTANCES
## Oval in Perfect Condition For Excellent Early Season Performances 
### 
For the first time n two weeks, good
weather conditions prevailed through
out the entire day at the Stanford
oval. Over one hundred and twenty
five members of the squad were en
couraged by the clearness of the day,
and fairly good condition of the track,
and participated in light work-outs
throughout the morning and after
noon.
Coach E. P. Campbell, '13, announces
a track meet for Saturday morning—
the third informal contest of the sea
son. Full distances at last appear on
the schedule of events, and if the track
s sufficiently packed, a goodly num
ber of creditable early-season per
formances should be chalked up.
At 10:30 the starter will send the
milers off their marks. Heats of the
100-yard dash will follow at 10:38.
The quarter-milers will get a work
out at 10:45; the high hurdlers will
compete ten minutes later. At 11
o'clock the two-milers will jog the en
tire distance.
The 220-yard dash will be called
at 11:15, and will be followed by the
low hurdles and half-mile at 11:20 and
11:30, respectively. Competition will
also be held in the hammer throw,
shot put, pole vault, high jump, and
broad jump.
As before, every signed up member
is requested to enter the meet. The
contestants are expected to arrive on
the scene in cle;ui suits—Coach Camp
bell is very firm on this score, and sev
eral runners were notified today that
their "togs" would not pass muster in
a regular meet.
The following officials for Satur
day's races have been named by Cap
tain Bonnett, as follows:
Dr. Angell, Professor D. E. Folsom,
P.rofesEor Wing, IT. J. Ling, '15, tim
ers; Professors D. M. Folfom, E. W.
Ponzer, and W. I). Fletcher. '11, judges;
W. J. Gross, '16. and G. C. Collins, '17.
recorders; H. H. Dubendorf, announc
er; Jumbo Morris, starter; G. W. La
Piere, '16, C. H. Nixon, '15, H. Morrison,
'13, jump; H. Rea, '13. D. Seymour,
'15. E. E. Davidson, '17, broad jump;
J. Tufts, '16, and E. Templeton, pole
vault ; H. Laiulreth, '13, W. H. Warren,
'15, and R. L. Owen, '17, weights.
George Horine, ex-'l3, former hold
er of the world's high jump record at
6 feet 7 inches, was out in uniform
for light practice yesterday after
noon. He cleared the bar at six feet
with ease, and also made good distance
in the discus and standing broad
jump.
Rumor has it that E. R. Boomer
shine. '16, will not be able to don a
suit this season. I lis performance in
the half-mile last year was very cred
itable, but an operation for a disease
of the back makes his registration on
the squad impossible.
Coach Campbell put most of the
sprinters through starting practice
last evening, while Captain Bonnett
held the watch on the distance men.
Many of the most likely candidates are
rounding into form rapidly, and the
trainer's chief care is to see that they
do not develop too quickly.
