# HOWARD SEE LECTURES TO ENGINEERS ON PURE IRON
## 
### 
Howard See. .research worker of the
American Rolling Mill company, lec
tured on "The Manufacture and Use of
Pure Iron" yesterday afternoon, in the
Mechanical Engineering building, toll
ing in an interesting manner of the ef
fects of the purity and physical strains
of iron on its rust-resisting proper
ties.
He illustrated his lecture with two
sets of slides, one of which was com
posed of views taken within a .rolling
mill —something never attempted be
fore. owing to the difficulties involved
in securing adequate light—and the
other demonstrating the results of
both long-time and accelerated rust
tests and also showing the practical
applications of pure iron in construc
tion work.
