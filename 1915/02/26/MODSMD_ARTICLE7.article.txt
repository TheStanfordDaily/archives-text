# ANNUAL THREE-CORNERED CREW REGATTA IS SCHEDULED FOR APRIL 10
## EBB TIDE IS PREDICTED Northern Managers Suggest That Pacific Coast Colleges Invite Oarsmen of East to Compete 
### 
Saturday, April 10, is the date that
has been set for the three-cornered in
tercollegiate crew race between Cali
fornia, Washington, and Stanford. It
has been determined that the tide con
ditions in Oakland Estuary will be
suitable for a morning race at that
time, and the graduate managers have
selected the date for the annual re
gatta.
The proper conditions for the race
in the esturay demand a light ebb tide.
On April 10 the tide will turn about
an hour before the race. A second
consideration that led to choosing this
date s the fact that the University of
Washington will have a weeks' vaca
tion from April 3 to April 12, and the
northern eight will be given ample
time to make the trip and work-out on
the estuary before the race.
Graduate Manager Wilcox has re
ceived letters from Graduate Manager
J. Arthur Younger, of Washington, in
regard to bringing some eastern
crews out to the coast this spring for
a regatta in California and another in
Washington. Manager Younger sug
gests that, if the step is taken, the re
gatta on the Oakland Estuary be run
off in connection with the Panama-
Pacific International Exposition and
that financial ass stance might lie
sought from the Exposition officials
for paying the expenses. The north
ern university will pay the expenses
for the visit to Seattle.
Manager Wilcox has taken the mat
ter up with the Exposition officials,
and, if financial assistance can be se-
cured for them, three crews will prob
ably be brought to the coast. The
Wisconsin and Syracuse eights are
among those considered for the trip.
The new shell, from stroke to bow,
will hold the following varsity men

ary today: Maurer, McEuen, Orme,
Rehm, Worth, Hulsman, Jacomini,

lowing will row in the English shell:

hoff will be the coxswain.
The Freshman oarsmen are: Fergu
son, McAdam, Bullis, Keller, Phel,
