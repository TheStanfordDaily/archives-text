# CLAIMS FOUNDER LACKS A SUITABLE MEMORIAL
## Conference Feels That There Is No Fitting Monument to Mrs. Stanford 
### 
A resolution was adopted by the
University Conference last night de
claring it to he the sentiment of the
meeting that some memorial should he
erected to .lane Lathrop Stanford on
the campus. This resolution will ha
brought before the attention of the
Hoard of Trustees of the University,
as expressing the sentiment of the
Student Body through the action of its
largest representative organization.
During the discussion the erection
of a low marble bench dedicated to
Mrs. Stanford in the center of the Me
morial Court on the site of the statue
of the Stanford family group was sug
gested. Another suggestion was that
the new Library be dedicated to Mrs.
Stanford, and named The Jewel Li
brary. Those advancing this idea be
lieve it to be especially suitable, in
view of M.rs. Stanford's act of saeri
f'ce in selling her personal jewels to
create a fund for the maintenance of
the library at the time when the Uni
versity finances were in a strained
condition. The income from this fund
is still the source of the purchase
money for most of the new books of
rne Stanford Library.
