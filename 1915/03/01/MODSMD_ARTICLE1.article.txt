### 
In the'fastest and cleanest basket
ball game ever seen in the Stanford
Gymnasium, California defeated the
Cardinal five by a score of 38
to 28 last Saturday evening, there
by annexing the championship
of the Intercollegiate Basket
ball League. The local quintet lost its
chance to tie with California and Ne
vada for first place by its failure to
win this game.
"We lost to a better team," said Cap
tain Reynolds, after the game. "I am
satisfied with the work of the players,
except that th?,re was a little hard luck
in basket-fchoot'ng at times, it was a
good, clean, hard-fought contest."
Worthy shot a basket during the
first minute of play, scoring the ini
tial points cf the game. The Blue and
Gold players rallied, however, and
soon secured the lsad. which they held
throughout the rest of the play. At no
time, however, was the victory as
sured, until the last of the second pe
riod.
The superior team work and speed
of the California five would have
rolled up a larger total for the Blue
and Gold, but for the determined re
sistance and fighting spirit of the Car
dinal players. Worthy and Blodget,
forwards; Wallace at center, with
Reynolds and Dolan guarding, began
the game for Stanford. At the end of
the first half, California had a lead of
three points, the score standing 20 to
17. Worthy scored six of the ten fouls
which were called on the California
players, and shot three baskets. Blod
get and Wallace each shot a basket,
and a penalty goal was scored. Nor
ton, Sharpe, Captain McKay, Embury,
and Mayo led off for California. Five
out of the six fouls called on Stanford
were converted by Norton.
House replaced Embury as guard
for California at the beginning of the
second half, and Wheatly replaced
Wallace at center later in the game.
The Cardinal players made a desper
ate effort to cut down the lead of their
opponents, but were unable to offset
the superior team work and speed of
the opposing team. One of the star
baskets for the game was shot by
Blodget, who received the ball on a
long loft from Dolan at the California
end.
During the second half ten fouls
were called on California, and only
two scored by Worthy, while Norton
converted four out of the six fouls
registered on Stanford. Blodget shot
two baskets, and Worthy and Wallace
each one, which, with another point
earned on a foul, gave the Cardinal
players their total of 28 points. Cali
fornia scored seven baskets, and i
penalty point awarded for holding in
the last half.
The game was full of action, and
only once was it stopped on account of
a disputed decision: Walker lived up
to his reputation as a technical ref
eree, and none of the fouls escaped
his watchful eye. He handled the
game well, and rendered his decisions
impartially.
California and Stanford will clash
at basketball next Friday night on the
Berkeley court in the second of the
series to decide the intercollegiate
championship.

Worthy shot a basket during the
first minute of play, scoring the ini
tial points cf the game. The Blue and
Gold players rallied, however, and
soon secured the lsad. which they held
throughout the rest of the play. At no
time, however, was the victory as
sured, until the last of the second pe
riod.
The superior team work and speed
of the California five would have
rolled up a larger total for the Blue
and Gold, but for the determined re
sistance and fighting spirit of the Car
dinal players. Worthy and Blodget,
forwards; Wallace at center, with
Reynolds and Dolan guarding, began
the game for Stanford. At the end of
the first half, California had a lead of
three points, the score standing 20 to
17. Worthy scored six of the ten fouls
which were called on the California
players, and shot three baskets. Blod
get and Wallace each shot a basket,
and a penalty goal was scored. Nor
ton, Sharpe, Captain McKay, Embury,
and Mayo led off for California. Five
out of the six fouls called on Stanford
were converted by Norton.
House replaced Embury as guard
for California at the beginning of the
second half, and Wheatly replaced
Wallace at center later in the game.
The Cardinal players made a desper
ate effort to cut down the lead of their
opponents, but were unable to offset
the superior team work and speed of
the opposing team. One of the star
baskets for the game was shot by
Blodget, who received the ball on a
long loft from Dolan at the California
end.
During the second half ten fouls
were called on California, and only
two scored by Worthy, while Norton
converted four out of the six fouls
registered on Stanford. Blodget shot
two baskets, and Worthy and Wallace
each one, which, with another point
earned on a foul, gave the Cardinal
players their total of 28 points. Cali
fornia scored seven baskets, and i
penalty point awarded for holding in
the last half.
The game was full of action, and
only once was it stopped on account of
a disputed decision: Walker lived up
to his reputation as a technical ref
eree, and none of the fouls escaped
his watchful eye. He handled the
game well, and rendered his decisions
impartially.
California and Stanford will clash
at basketball next Friday night on the
Berkeley court in the second of the
series to decide the intercollegiate
championship.

ball game ever seen in the Stanford
Gymnasium, California defeated the

to 28 last Saturday evening, there
by annexing the championship
of the Intercollegiate Basket
ball League. The local quintet lost its
chance to tie with California and Ne
vada for first place by its failure to
win this game.
"We lost to a better team," said Cap
tain Reynolds, after the game. "I am
satisfied with the work of the players,
except that th?,re was a little hard luck
in basket-fchoot'ng at times, it was a
good, clean, hard-fought contest."
