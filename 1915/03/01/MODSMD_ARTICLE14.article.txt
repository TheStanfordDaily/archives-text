Since the membership campaign
was inaugurated to secure members
for The Stanford Union there has been
considerable misapprehension as to the
scope of The Union, and the benefits
to be derived from becoming a mem
ber. Also, there has been consider
able inquiry us to the need for money
secured from the membership. The
Union and The Club House are simi
lar to other buildings of their type.
Heavy operating expenses must be met
from month to month, and the most
feasible plan as yet devised is to place
this burden on the members. Besides
the maintenance and general running
expenses of The Union a considerable
sum of money is needed at the outset
to meet fixed charges for permanent
improvements.
The benefits to be obtained from
becoming a member of The Union are
divided into two classes, namely prac
tical and theoretical. On the practical
side, The Union has planned to install
a billiard and a pool table, equip a
card room, and place all the modern
periodicals and newspapers in the
reading room. From the theoretical
viewpoint, The Union is a common
meeting ground, it is the only place
provided in the University where the
various elements may assemble. It is
a place to get together, to sit around
and talk over things around the open
fireplaces. The theoretical benefits are
the real reason for the existence of
The Union.
Some of the students have conceived
the erroneous idea that the member
ship fee has been placed at $1.50 in
order to limit the number and make
the membership exclusive. On the
contrary, The Union is inclusive, and
should have 011 its roll the name of ev
ery student and member of the Fac
ulty. The Union will be a failure un
less the students realize this fact. It
is necessary for a large majority of
the men to give it their moral as well
as their financial support to insure
success.
