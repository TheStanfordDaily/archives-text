# MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR MRS. STANFORD IS HELD
## REVEREND THOMAS F. GAILOR PREACHES SERMON Day of Student Prayer Is Also Observed Immediately After Exercises. 
### 
A service in memory of Jane Lathop
Stanford was held in the Memorial
Church yesterday. A day of student
prayer was also observed in the
church, being held directly after the
service.
The Right Reverened Thomas F.
Gailor preached the sermon, taking as
his text "Be ye therefore perfect, even
as your Father which is in heaven is
perfect." He justified man's anticipa
tion of the grandeur of the human race
upon earth, but indicated man's insig
nificance as a factor. In regard to the
poorness and meanness of human life,
upon which science is insisting, Bishop
Gailor said:
"The whole history of man upon
earth is progress,â€”a struggle fo.r im
provement. Man is always striving to
increase his power; it is an infatuation
for which philosophy has no answer."
Wholly contrary to this selfish life,
was the life of Jane Lathrop Stanford,
of which Bishop Gailor said:
"Mrs. Stanford saw the vision and
believed it. It was her invincible faith
that made it easy for her to overcome
great difficulties. She believed in,
and loved the children of California,
consequently bestowing upon them this
great and wonderful institution of
learning."
