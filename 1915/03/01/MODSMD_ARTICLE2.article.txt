# FULLER SISTERS
## Appear Tomorrow Evening Following Eastern Successes. 
### 
Following their successes at Har
vard, Radcliffe, Bryn Mawr, Smith,
Columbia, the New England Conserva
tory, and other great colleges and mu
sic schools of the East, the Misses
Dorothy, Rosalind, and Cynthia Fuller
will give a recital of English ballads
and folk-songs in the Assembly Hall
tomorrow evening under the auspices
of the Faculty Committee on Enter
tainment. They are placed among the
most versatile interpreters of this
subject, and their tour of the country
has been characterized by great suc
cess.
Ow ing to a delay in the sending of
advertising matter, the concert has
not received the publicity to which its
merit entitles it. The reputation es
tablished in the past by the Faculty
Committee on Entertainment should be
.remembered, and their connection
with the coming performance consid
ered as a guarantee of its quality.
