# SENSATIONAL RALLY WINS FOR VARSITY
## Ninth-Inning Finish Defeats Olympic Club in Tight Game by 2 to 1 Score. 
### 
A delayed ninth inning batting rally,
spectacular enough to rival the thril
ling tales o? "the championship games"
in baseball fiction, plus masterful
twirling by Doc Hayes, gave the Var
sity a 2 to 1 victory over the Olympic
Club Saturday afternoon, on the home
diamond.
At the beginning of the ninth inning
the score stood I to (! in Olympic's fa
or, and the first two Cardinals fanned.
Then three successive hits, one a
triple, changed apparent defeat into
victory.
From the beginning the game was a
pitching duel between "Doc" Hayes
and Howedge, the Olympic southpaw.
There were no hits or runs for four
innings, and until the final frame the
game appeared listless to the fans,
who braved the overcast sky and sat
patiently through the shower which
threatened to break up the contest.
Doc Hayes kept the club batsmen
guessing except in the fifth when they
registered two hits and their lone run,
and again in the eighth when Howedge
singled. Hayes was given sterling
support, Stevens and McC'loskey .rob
bing the Olympic nine of several hits,
and the rest of the team handling all
chances in class A style.
Howedge held the Varsity helpless
until the ninth. Only two men reached
first in five innings. Austin, who led
off, drew four balls, and Day got on
in the fifth on Hurke's error. Hayes
was the first Cardinal lrtter to single,
putting a fast one just out of Turner's,
reach in the last of the sixth frame,
but was caught stealing second. Mc-
Closkey landed a single past third in
the eighth, but made the third out
trying to beat Burke's peg to second.
The bleachers yelled for a score in
the last of the ninth, but Hayes and
Austin both fanned, and as Stafford
stepped to the plate, the fans began to
leave. "Wobbles" started the winning
hit-carnival, by lining a hot one
through Tramutola. Captain Workman
landed on one of Howedge's curves,
and sent a whizzing tripple out into
right field, scoring Stafford. "Babe"
Dent then broke up the game, bringing
Workman in on a drive over second.
Ray Maple, '14, wore an Olympic
uniform, playing right field for the
Winged "O." He pulled down three
long flies, and was given a good hand
as he faced Hayes in the second in
ninir.
