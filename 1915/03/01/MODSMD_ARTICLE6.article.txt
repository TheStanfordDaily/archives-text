# SENIONS WILL DISCUSS FOUNDERS' DAY PLANS AT WEDNESDAY MEETING
## 
### 
The part which the class of 191. r Â»
will take in the Founders' Day cere
monies will be the main topic of im
portance to be discussed ill the meet
ing announced for Wednesday, March
3. It has been a precedent for the
Senior Class to march in a body to the
tomb of the Founders, where floral
pieces are placed by the flower com
mittee. The organization necessary to
the successful performance of this and
other ceremonies must be thoroughly
understood by the class; so it is pri
marily for this reason that the meet
ing has been called.
