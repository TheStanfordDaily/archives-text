# TRUSTEES APPROVE OF SUMMER SCHOOL IN LAW
## All Upperclassmen May Take Courses UNIVERSITY OFFICES MOVED New San Francisco Headquarters Located in Center of the Financial District 
### 
Approval of ihe tentative announce
ment made by the Stanford Law-
School Faculty of a summer session
was given by the Hoard of Trustees on
Friday afternoon. Under the direction
of Dean F. C. Woodward, a program
for a six-weeks' course has been plan
ned. The term will probably open
about .June 21 and close July 30. To
cover a two-unit course in this period
it will be necessary to hold about five
lecture periods each week. This means
that a program of fifteen hours each
week for six weeks will allow six
units of credit.
The tentative list of courses to be
g'ven includes the following: Public
Se.rvice Corporations, 2 units, Profes
sor C'athcart; Administrative Law, 2
units, Professor Huston; Insurance, 2
units, Professor Huston; Equity, 2
units, Professor Kirkwood; Admiralty,
2 units, Professor Kirkwood.
With the exception of the courses on
Damages and Admiralty, all of the
work given is to be open to students
having 50 hours of University credit
at Stanford. Upperclassmen in other
departments will be eligible to take
work at the summer session. The tui
tion fee will be $25, regardless of the
amount of work taken.
At the same session of the Trustees
on Friday, it was decided to move the
San Francisco business office of the
University from the Nevada Dank
building to the Insurance Exchange
building, on California street, between
Montgomery and Sansome. A suite of
office rooms has been leased on the
sixth floor of the building.
The new offices of the University
are located in the center of San Fran
cisco's financial district. Most of the
trustees have offices in the Insurance
Exchange building, or in the vicinity,
and the move is being made in order
to make it more convenient for Busi
ness Manager Stowe to call the Trus
tees into conference.
