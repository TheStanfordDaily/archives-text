###

Battery in Second Game With
Mission Aggregation â€”Coach
Wolter Builds Strong Team
ORR SWITCHES THE LINE-UP
Fresh from their sensational ninth
inning victory over the fast Winged
"O" aggregation, the Varsity team will
be on deck tomorrow afternoon to
furnish the local fans with another
opportunity for collecting diamond
data, when they meet the University
of Santa Clara nine for the second
time this year.
In a five-inning encounter February
10, Stanford scored an easy win over
their old rivals, Hoever holding the
Mission stickers to two hits and one
run, while the Varsity romped away
with eight tallies. Since this defeat,
Coach Harry Wolter, who was the
leading regular hitter in the Pacific
Coast League last season, has whipped
the Santa Clara team into a strong
combination.
The Varsity held practice games
with the second team both yesterday
and today, almost every pitcher on the
squad being given an opportunity to
throw a few curves to the batters.
Previous to the contest, the players
indulged in base-running, bunting,
fielding, and batting practice, so that
by tomorrow every man will be in
good condition after the long lay-off
necessitated by the rain.
Coach Billy O.rr has announced sev
eral definite changes in the line-up
of the Varsity. Austin, who hit in tho
lead-off position in Saturday's game
with the Olympic Club, will now be a
fixture at. the head of the batting or
der, and will occupy center field. Day
will be the sixth stick-artist to step to
the plate, and is to hold down the left
pasture. The right fielders' duties are
to be divided between Noonan and
Downing.
Gus Hoever will again be given an
opportunity to puzzle the Mission
batsmen in the role of pitcher, with
Dent, as usual, on the receiving end.
The regular infield, consisting of Cap
tan Workman, first base; Stafford,
second base; Stevens, shortstop, and
McCloskey, third base, are to grace the
diamond.
The Santa Clara nine will present
numerous changes in the personnel of
the line-up since its last campus ap
pearance. The battery will be com
posed of Mickey, pitcher, and Hy
ler, catcher. Mickey's chief asset
is an abundance of speed. Ramage
will cover first base; Montgomery the
second sack; McGinnis the short
patch, and Sheehan third. The out
field, reading from left, to right, will
see Fitzpatrick, Hawks, and Schulz,
respectively, in action.
