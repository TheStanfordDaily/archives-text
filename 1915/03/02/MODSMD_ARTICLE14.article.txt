Resolutions recommended to the
Women of the University by the Wo
men's Conference deserve strong com
mendation. At first thought many of
the studeuts are apt to view the sug
gestions with levity. They consider
that University women should be able
to take care of themselves, and not be
treated as children. Upon further re
flection, however, it is evident that the
careful consideration of such matters
as are treated in the resolutions is of
countless value to all women, Univer
sity or non-university, thoughtful as
well as thoughtless.
The Exposition is bound to draw to
San Francisco various elements with
diverse purposes, including many per
sons of the rougher class. It is rea
sonable that women should not go to
the city without proper escort or
chaperonage under the conditions
that now prevail by reason of the Ex
position. It has been found by many
that designing individuals will take
advantage of women without proper
escort.
Looking to the protection of the wo
men who will attend the Exposition,
the Women's Conference has wisely
recommended resolutions calling the
attention of the women to the need
for due precaution in visiting the Ex
position, and in meeting emergencies
that may arise. For the benefit and
protection of all, both those to whom
the resolutions are merely a warning,
and those to whom they are a neces
sary rule, there should be hearty co
operation, to make the recommenda
tions active.
