# Professor Krehbiel Translates Letter on German Situation
## 
### 
Editor, The Daily Palo Alto:
I regret to have to say that the
"Letter from Germany," printed in
your Thursday edition is far from be
ing a correct translation of the origin
al, which has for some days been in
my possession. Why this is, I do not
know. Hut 1 feel that you and your
readers, are entitled to know how far
you have been misled. Accordingly,
without wishing to .reflect 011 any one,
I offer you a translation which I con
sider practically correct. Omitting
several sentences of your version as
satisfactory, I translate the balance
of the original entirely, except as indi
cated. When ever convenient I use
the words of your version for the rest,
in orde.r to secure accuracy, the trans
lation is more literal than is ordinar
ily desirable. Yours truly,
EDWARD B. KREHBIEL.
"In the front house they have every
thing full of soldiers, friend and foe,
Russians, Frenchmen, Englishmen,
Zouaves, Belgians, officers, and pri
vates. Only the English, Belgian and
French do not get on together.- Not
here, where all are abed with their
wounds, but in the prisoners' camp
nearby there have been bloody disa
greements.
"The first wounded we received af
ter the first battles were terribly man
gled. Some had had entire limbs or
large muscles torn to pieces by the
murderous dum-dum bullets. In spite
of amputation many have since died.
The enemies we had at that time also
had large wounds, but they were not
so lacerated or poisoned. This has
now become better since the prohibi
tion of these bullets.
"Of course, you hear much of the
war where you are, probably chiefly
English reports. Let them continue
their abuse and talk, there are no
braver troops 011 land or sea than our
soldiers. Our foes must admit that,
even if not openly. How victoriously
have our troops invaded France, and
also Russia, up to the gates of War
saw. And our submarines, defying
death, they venutre upon daring and
heroic enterprises; and our flyers do
the same n air. I believe that, even
though slowly, we will reach ou.r goal.
How enthusiastically our wounded
tell of their campaigns, and how joy
fully they return to the front when
they have recovered.
"But the war is making itself felt,
even though we live in security. Prices
of necessities are going up. Petroleum
is no longer to be had, and there are
other restrictions. Still we are not
thankful enough that the war is rag
ing 011 the soil of the foe instead of
our own. How it devastates the whole
region we see from the distress in
East Prussia. Only a small district
suffered; how much worse it must be
in Belgium and France. Our soldiers
at the front write how famished Bel
gium is. Large crowds of freezing
women and children surround our
camps and beg fo.r bread, and our sol
diers give as long as they have it; nay
more, they care for the poor orphaned
children, whose fathers were shot in
battle and whose mothers were shot
as snipers."
| Here follows a passage relating to
Christmas, which I do not translate,
as it did not appear *n youx version. 1
merely say that the sentence in your
columns in which Huns are men
tioned, and the following sentence are
not in the original. I resume where
your translations resumes. —K.]
"Brother Emil was in Hamburg sev
eral days, and liked it very much. —
has been ill for a long time, but is
better now.
"Begging for an early and long an
swer. Greetings, etc.,
(Signature).
(In all fairness to the translator,
the letter above referred to, was
translated primarily for private use,
and with no thought at the time that
:t would be read by the general pub
lic.—Ed.)
