# Sonny vs. W.C.

Dearest Ma—Your letter came yes
terday. So Uncle Joe has bought a
Ford. I always knew he would be
successful in life. Do you remember
our argument about sending Sis up
here? You win. I don't think she had
better come. I used to think college
was a place for a girl with common
sense to get acclimated to the world.
But I've just made up my mind that
this is 110 place for a girl with com
mon sense, because they don't give
them credit for having any. The "Wo
men's" Conference issued I forget how
many Ten Commandments for our 500
college "women," which is what we
used to call them. They are only girls
now, in the words of the command
ments, which say that no girl should
go to the Exposition without a gent
or a chaperone. I'm surprised the
conference gives them their choice—
its so difficult for a girl to decide.
The girls are not supposed to ride in
jitney busses. That commandment is
unnecessary—the jits don't give trans
fers. Another commandment says that
the girls should hang around the fair
Y. W. C. A. for men and women with
a cafeteria in connection. If the Y. M.
there is anything like ours here, it is
a swell place for loafers. The last
commandment is very practical. The
girl who gets lost (i.e. separated from
their escorts, chaperones, or fam
ilies) should come immediately to the
Y. W. C. A. for men and women.
There are jitney phones every few
yards for the girls to phone for
friends, dates or ransom. If they
drop a nickel central promises to tell
them where and who they are. Tn
case of necessity a college girl may
check herself until the next day for a
dime, or send herself home by par
cels post. But then, the dean of wo
men might not like that because there
would not be any chaperone with all
the mails around (excuse me). I'm
for going to bed now, as it's late. What
say you? Remember me to Uncle Joe.
The usual love from your
SONNY.
S. P.—Until the gents see the first
guy going to the fair with a chaperone,
it's nothing but watchful waiting.
