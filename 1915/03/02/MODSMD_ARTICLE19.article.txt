# Nineteen Years Ago Today

### 
Fourth-hour classes did not meet
this morning, owing to the receipt of
the news that the Supreme Court had
handed down a unanimous decision in
favor of Stanford in the suit brought
by the United States against the Stan
ford estate.
Bombs were fired in the afternoon
as an expression of the enthusiasm,
and a cannon was secured from May
field and brought to the campus.
While nothing authoritative could
be learned this afternoon as to the
prospects of a vacation, Dr. Elliott
stated that he thought one would be
granted by President Jordan on his
return from San Francisco.
