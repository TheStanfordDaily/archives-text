# STANFORD WRESTLERS MAY TUSSLE WITH CALIFORNIA
## J.H. Wiggins, '10, and C.E. Allen, Gr., Are in Charge of Organization of Team. 
### 
Prospects fo,r an informal wrestling
bout with the University of California
have been opened by a letter of in
quiry to Dr. H. R. Stolz from R. N.
Scott, Instructor of Physical Train
ing at California. If an understanding
is reached the two universities will be
represented by teams composed of va
rious weights. In this way it is hoped
that all men interested in wrestling
will be afforded the opportunity to
compete in bouts for which they are
fitted.
J. H. Wiggins, *10, and C. E. Allen,
gr., are in charge of the organization
of a wrestling team. Allen took an ac
tive part in wrestling at Yale. They
will coach all those interested, and
urge men to go out for the team, even
though they have not had previous ex
perience.
The wrestling bouts, to be held on
March 15, in Encina Gymnasium, will
prove useful in determining the ma
terial now available.
If the match is decided upon it will
probably be held in about a month
from the present date. If the bout is
a success it will accomplish much to
ward an interest in wrestling in the
universities of the Pacific coast. It
has been recognized as an intercolle
giate sport by many Eastern colleges
for many years.
