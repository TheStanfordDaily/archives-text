# STANFORD DAY IS CONSIDERED
## Santa Clara County to Hold Forth at Exposition Friday. 
### 
Plans for a Stanford Day at the Ex
position are being prepared. Santa
Clara county, which is to have its day
on Friday, March 5, requested Stan
ford to declare a holiday in order that
the students might participate as a
part of the county, but this has not
been found feasible. The Exposition
committee in charge of this matter
then suggested that March 9 be de
clared a holiday and be called "Stan
ford Day." This date, however, is
Founders' Day. The committee have
been informed that the date for "Stan
ford Day" must be set on a day which
will not interfere with intercollegiate
instruction, if it is to receive the sanc
tion of the University, and a day is
now being considered by them.
