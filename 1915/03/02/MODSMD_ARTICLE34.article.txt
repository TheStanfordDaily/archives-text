of Well-known Athletes of Cinder
Path to Invade tlie Stanford Oval
During tlie Latter Part of Month.
SQUAD EXPECTS CLOSE CONTEST
Track Captain George Ho.rine, ex-'l3,
of the Olympic Club, has announced a
very formidable line-up with which he
will invade the Stanford oval on
March 20. The list includes twenty
three names of well-known athletes of
the Pacific coast, and representation
in every event but the hammer throw
and the pole vault.
The sprinters include Nolan, New
hoff, and Jack Nelson, who was seen
on the Stanford track last evening,
pacing out a few quarters in prepara
tion fo.r the coming meet. R. Lindley
Murray, '13, who held the Stanford
half-mile record for a few weeks last
year at 1:551-5; Geoppert, who won
the 140-yard dash in last year's Inter
scholastic meet, and Gisin, the old
Winged "O" reliable, will contest in the
quarter mile.
Stout and Cramer are scheduled to
run in the half mile, Cramer is an old
member of the Stanford track squarl.
The mile will be taken care of by Per
kins and Oliver Millard, who holds the
Pacific coast record in the two-mile
run. Millard will enter the two-mile
grind, his favorite event, and will have
Spurr, Donovan, and George Branner,
'13, as his team-mates.
The hurdlers are especially strong.
The list includes J. Chase, the former
Ulinois idol, who is coaching the San
Jose high school team this spring.
"Jumbo" Morris, whose exploits on the
Cardinal track, are well known to all
cinder path fans, Carrol Grunsky, the
speedy Stockton hurdler, and Pvne,
who figured prominently in the Stan
ford interscholastic last year.
Dooling, Ollie Snedigar, and Morris
are entered in the shot-put. Horine
and Beeson, who have juggled with
world's records in the high jump for
the last few years, will top the bar
along with Sullivan and Jacobs. H.
Morrison, '13, who recently established
a trio of new indoor records in the
meet held here two weeks ago, is
scheduled for the broad jump with
Ollie Snedigar. Horine, Morris, and
Dooling will take part in hurling the
javelin.
This line-up is an exceptionally
strong one, and the Varsity will have
to raise the dust on the track in good,
heavy clouds in order to take the
measure of this band of veterans. Hor
ine has been practicing on the track
for a number of weeks, endeavoring
to get back into form, and negotiated
six feet last Thursday with apparent
ease.
Negotiations with the University of
Southern California are hanging fire nt
the present time, but Manager Wilcox is
trying to conclude satisfactory ar
rangements with the southern man
ager.
