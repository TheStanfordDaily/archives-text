New System of Handling Candidates Is
Announced—Men .Must Work Out in
Accordance With Previously Ar
ranged Schedule,
PRIZE TOURNAMENTS PLANNED
Should the good weather continue
the Thiele Cup tournament will be
concluded this week. At present it
has been possible to play off only the
first round.
The varsity squad, which is com
posed of Captain H. L. Hahn, '16, L.
Sloss, '15, K. 13. Uhls, '16, O. G. Brun,
'16, S. Chapman, '16, A. Barber, '18, H.
V. D. Johns, '18, and C. Wolford, '18,
met this afternoon for the first time
this spring, and the campaign for the
season was outlined to them.
This year candidates for positions
on the varsity team will be expected
to devote their entire time to tennis,
just as do those engaged in other
sports. In the past there has been no
definite system of working out, but
from now until the time of the final
try-outs for varsity positions each ten
nis aspirant must turn out on the En
cina courts at three-thirty every Mon
day, Wednesday, and Friday after
noon.
By this means it is expected to turn
out a better drilled aggregation than
ever heretofore.
As soon as the Thiele tournament is
finished, another match will be started
in which a racquet will be offered as
first prize. The tennis management
hopes from now on to provide a con
tinuous string of handicap tourna
ments, in which prizes will be offered.
To defray the expense of buying balls
for these, an admission of twenty-five
cents will be charged.
These prize matches are planned to
afford an additional stimulus to the
development of tennis at Stanford. In
pursuance of this plan it has also been
arranged that those taking gymnasium
may obtain credit for playing in these
tournaments.
Entries may be handed to H. L.
Hahn, '16, K. B. Uhls, *16, or L. Sloss,
'15. Those desiring to enter are re
quested to do so as soon as possible,
in order that the handicaps may be
made out.
