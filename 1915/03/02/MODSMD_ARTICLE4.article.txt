# Faculty Committee Makes Summer Law School a Reality
## Thirty Law Students Have Already Announced Intention to Attend Session. 
### 
It has been definitely decided by the
Law Faculty that a summer term of
the Law School will be held, in accord
ance with the tentative plans previ
ously announced.
About thirty law students have al
ready announced their intention to at-

tend this term.
This is hardly a
sufficient num
ber to justify
the undertaking,
but the Law Fac
ulty hopes that
the number will
be substantially
increased before
the end of the

semester, and that the reduced rail
road fares on account of the Panama-
Pacific Exposition and the attraction
of the Exposition itself will draw a
considerable number of students from
the Eastern and Middle Western col
leges.
The Law Faculty desires to empha
size the fact that most of the courses
to be given in the summer will be of
interest and value to all students,
whether they intend to practice law or
not, and that all of the courses will lie
open to all students who have fifty
units of credit.
Professor Woodward requests that
all who are thinking of taking work
in the summer school give their names
to him at their earliest convenience.
Me will also be glad to give more de
tailed information about the work to
anyone who is interested.
