# FULLER SISTERS TO APPEAR IN CONCERT THIS EVENING
## 
### 
The Misses Fuller, who appear this
evening at the Assembly Hall, under
the auspices of the Faculty Commit
tee on Entertainment, will commence
their recital with "A Singer's Apolo
gy," an introductory number which
they found to be used by the sword
dancers of Yorkshire. They close with
the Devonshire "Brixliam Town," a
merry, quizzical defence by the folk
singer of his own art.
For the rest they have a large num
ber of songs and ballads descriptive
of all parts of England and Scotland.
There a.re lays of frolic and mirth, of
shipwreck and sea perils. old wars
and tragical stories, with fairy tales
and romances. This is a rich field of
endeavor, and the Fuller sisters have
been industrious in its working. None
arc better fitted to sot. forth the real
life of the past and gone generation of
the English peasants than these three
who give such a winning per
formance of folk-songs.

From the time of their first tour to
the United States, made as an exper
iment, their reception has been as
sured. Norman Hapgood, of the Harp
ers Weekly, voluntarily devoted the
frontispiece of one issue to the Ful
ler sisters, lie made the statement
that they represented musical art in
a most sincere and unique fashion;
and that where appreciation was high
ly cultivated they were best received.
This is particularly true of their re
ception by college audiences,, before
which they have appeared many times
in the East.
Commencing at B:in, the recital
promises to be one of the most, unique
and entertaining of all the musical
events of the season. The charming
picture which the Fuller sisters make
in their costumes of the early Victor
ian period, and accompanied by an old
Irish harp, is matched only by the
daintiness and unaffected grace of
their offerings.
