in the Assembly Hall will open with
an overture by the Stanford Band,
"Der Gsist des Wojewoden," by Gross
man.
Wagner's "Tannhauser" will be
played as the processional, and the
Seniors will slowly march down the
aisle and take seats in front of the
hall. The procession will be followed
by President John Casper Branner and
Chancellor David Starr Jordan.
Nevin's Suite, "Un Gioro in Vene
zia," will be interpreted by the Band,
in all of its four parts—Alba, Gondo
lieri, Canzone, and Buono Notti. The
choir had originally intended to pro
duce Haydn's masterpiece, "The Heav
ens Are Falling," and rehearsals for
tli's important number were held for
several weeks, but at the last moment
it was found that it would be impos
sible to secure a proper arrangement
of the music, and so the plan was
abandoned.
Dr. Jordan will follow with his ad
dress. At its conclusion, the audience
will rise and sing "Hail, Stanford,
Hail." "Stabat Mater," arranged by
Losey, has been chosen for the reces
sional. The audience will remain seat
ed until the Senior class has left the
hall. Tickets will be distributed at the
office of the Registrar until Monday
afternoon, and at. the Assembly Hall
entrances Tuesday morning. Tt will
not be necessary for the members of
the Senior class to secure these tick
ets, as arrangements for their seating
will be made beforehand.
