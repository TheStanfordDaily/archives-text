The Whites lead the Peanut League.
The lowly Blues took yesterday's
game from the Reds, and the Whites
won from the Blacks. Fo,r the first
time since the Peanut League schedule
began, the Reds have been hauled
down from the top position.
The Whites defeated the Blacks in
varsity style, winning in the last half
of the final frame, after a tight game.
Righter brought in the deciding run
with a single, after Ford had slammed
out a three-bagger. The batteries
were: Whites, Slade and Hart;
Blacks, Bennet, Tufts, and Tedford.
Score: Whites 2, Blacks 1.
There will be no Peanut League
games tomorrow, owing to the fact
that the Varsity meets St. Ignatius.
Zeb Terry, '14, is at the spring sea
son training camp of the Los Angeles
hall club. He has been covering his
old varsity position of short.
