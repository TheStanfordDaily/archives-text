# NATIONAL CONSERVATISM SCORNED BY DIPLOMAT
## SCHVAN DECLARES BLOCKADE. OF GERMANY INEFFECTUAL Supplies Received From Norway, Sweden and Balkansâ€”Submarines Clear Coast.

"Nations today are not ruled by in
ternational law or precedent, except
as it is to their advantage, and an evi
dence of this is the violation of Belgi
um's neutrality," declared August
Schvan this morning. Schvan is thu
Swedish diplomat who is touring
America under the auspices of the
Carnegie endowment for international
peace. "There is no power higher
than themselves that nations will re
spect," continued Mr. Schvan, "and
laws and precedent are of little con
cern.
"One of the worst faults with our
time is its conservatism, its subjec
tion to precedent. We seem to have
forgotten that the essence of history is
change, that what is best now will not
be so a few years hence. Changing
conditions overrule precedent, wheth
er we will or no.
"England's attempt to blockade the
entire coast of Germany is the result
of changed conditions. Today whole
nations go to war. The people of Ger
many, although non-combatants, are
engaged in the war, in that they are
providing for the men at the front.
"However, it is no longer possible to
effectually guard a coast line, due to
the advent of the submarine, which
prevents sea-going vessels from hov
ering near a coast, and cuts off all
supplies from the sea. As a result, in
stead of having a row of ships in a
line stretching from the frontier of
Denmark to that of Holland, the al
lied fleets have merely withdrawn to
the Straits of Dover, and to the pas
sage between the north of Scotland
and the southern point of Norway.
"Even though all ships are forbid
den to ente.r German ports, regardless
of whether or not they contain contra
band, Germany cannot be entirely cut
off from tbe outside world, because
the trade of Norway and Sweden is not
yet sopped, either with Germany or
with other nations. The same situation
is found in the Balkans."
Five years ago Mr. Schvan published
an article advocating a friendly agree
ment between Norway and Sweden, in
trade and in arms, in view of the pos
sibilities of a conflict like the present.
At that time he was assailed in the
Swedish papers, which declared him to
be a traitor to his country, and he also
incurred the wrath of the king. Two
months ago, however, the Swedish
government became alarmed at the
country's situation, and, fearing an at
tack from Russia, concluded a simi
lar agreement with Norway, forget
ting that Russia's hands we.re so tied
up in the present conflict that she
could not dream of aggression in the
direction of Sweden.
