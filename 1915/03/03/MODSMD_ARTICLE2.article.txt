# St. Ignatius Will Line-up Against Varsity Tomorrow
## Baby City Collegians to Face Hayes in Their Debut Before Local Fans. 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the Stanford
Varsity will engage in its second mid
week game, when the St. Ignatius
nine will journey to the campus for its
initial appearance. Due to the large
number of postponed contests, which
thus far total ten, it has been deemed
essential to enlarge the present sched
ule.
Among those who will represent St.
Ignatius tomorrow are numerous fa
miliar faces, for several of the Bay
City collegians have heretofore played
on the Olympic Club team. Schammel
and Howedge are scheduled to pitch,
while Lasater is to don the mask. Last
Saturday Howedge, in a Winged "O"
uniform, held the local batsmen to five
hits and two runs. The remainder of
the St. Ignatius line-up follows: W.
Brown .first, base; Captain Dougherty,
second base; Horan, third base;
V. Brown, shortstop; Flynn, left field;
Cullen, center field, and Smith right
field.
The game will commence at 4:1 rÂ».
when Umpire Heine Spencer will give
the call, "Batter Up."
