# REMEASUREMENT OF THE STANFORD TRACK PLANNED
## New Distances Must Be Figured on Basis of Twelve Inches From Pole. 
### 
The International Athletic Associa
tion recently adopted the ruling that
all records to be valid must be made
on a track which is measured twelve
inches from the pole, the theory being
that runners maintained this average
distance from the inside of the track
in actual competition.
The A. A. U. followed suit in order
ing that American records might be
recognized universally, and such ac
tion makes necessary a re-measure
ment of the Stanford track. Under the
old regulation the tape was held eigh
teen inches from the*pole, this scheme
taking into consideration the average
distance of two runners in competi
tion, one twelve inches, and the other
twenty-four inches from the inner rim.
This operation will be performed by
Coach Campbell and his assistants in
the presence of Professors Frank An
gell and C. 13. Wing.
The exact difference which will re
sult cannot be computed with exact
ness, but it will amount approximate
ly to a yard and a half. No actual
widening of the track will be neces
sary. Starting holes will be dug a
number of yards behind the finish
line, amounting to one and one-half
yards in the quarter-mile run, three
yards in the half, six in the mile, and
twelve in the two-mile.
