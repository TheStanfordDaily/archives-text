# SPRING WEATHER DRAWS MEN TO TRACK PRACTICE
## Many Surprises Expected From New Material Which Shows Decided Improvement. 
### 
That the warm spring weather is the
ideal time for track work was evi
denced yesterday afternoon by the
number of men who tu.rned ont for
practice. The temperature is not cold
enough to tighten up muscles, and it
is not too warm for spirited efforts,
and if the present conditions continue
the squad will round into shape rapid
ly.
Thus far fewer difficulties and in
juries have been reported than in the
average season heretofore.
Those who failed to show up for the
meet Saturday are requested to be
more punctual in the future. The
work of some of the new men, who
have not shown in the meets and who
have themselves underrated their pos
sibilities, is fast rounding into a quali
ty of unexpected form, and many sur
prises are anticipated.
