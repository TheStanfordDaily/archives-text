# UNDERCLASSMEN WILL JOLLY-UP
## Sophomore-Freshman Informal Will Be Held at Armory March 12. 
### 
Plans for the Underclass Jolly-Up,
to be held in the Armory in Palo Alto
Friday evening, March 12, were defi
nitely formed at a joint committee
meeting last evening. The Armory
was chosen because it was believed
that the Women's Club House would
he unable to accommodate the large
number expected to attend. It is esti
mated that five hundred dancers will
enjoy the entertainment, and prepara
tion is being made for that number.
A series of novel and entertaining
stunts will be inaugurated. "Eats"
will be served a la cafeteria, but minus
the cash register at the end of the
line. Excellent music is being se
cured. Vice-President R. D. Lilly, of
the Sophomore class, has been chosen
as master of ceremonies for the even
ing.
The Upperclass Jolly-Up will be
held on the same even'ng in Encina
Hall.
