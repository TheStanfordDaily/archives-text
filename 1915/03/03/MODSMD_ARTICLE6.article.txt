# JEWEL CITY TO GLEAM IN 1916 JUNIOR OPERA
## WISTARIA-LADEN ATMOSPHERE OF EXPOSITION TEA GARDEN IS SETTING. REHEARSALS ARE IN FULL SWING COMBINATION OF MORGAN, FORBES AND PAUL PROMISES AUTISTIC PRODUCTION. 
### 
An artistic production of the now
famous Tower of Jewels of the Pana
ma-Pacific Exposition will be a fea
ture of the Junior Opera "At the
Dragon's Eye," which is scheduled for
production in the Assembly Hall
Thursday evening, March 25. The ac
tion of the 191(5 opera holds sway in
the San Francisco fair grounds, which
will serve as the scenic background
for the opera this year. The glitter
ing oriental beauty of the Exposition
will be duplicated as faithfully as pos
sible, considering the limitations of
canvas and space, and the replica of
the Jewel Tower will form a center of
interest and beauty. Edward S. Wil
liams, of the Alcazar studios, in San
Francisco, has submitted sketches for
this elaborate set, which will picture
the cherry blossoms and wistaria
laden atmosphere of a Japanese tea
garden at the Exposition.
Rehearsals for the opera are now in
full swing, under the direction of J. R.
Morgan, '16, and W. B. Forbes, '15.
Morgan will be seen in a new role as
impresario, presiding w r ith the baton
in the orchestra, while Forbes will lie
the official "man behind the scenes."
The Class of 1916 has instituted a
decided innovation in Junior Opera
history this year, by dispensing with
the services of the customary profes
sional coach, and selecting in his stead
two unusually capable student direct
ors. The achievements of Morgan and
Forbes, particularly In the produc
tion of Ram's Head musical bur
lesques, speaks well for the artistic
success of the 1916 Junior Opera.
Both are also prominently identified
as musical comedy stars of several
Stanford shows.
