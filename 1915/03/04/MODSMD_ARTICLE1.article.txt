# DIPLOMAT OUTLINES CHANGES NECESSARY FOR LASTING PEACE
## August Schvan Condemns Modern Political Economic and Ethical Ideas Advanced by Statesmen the World Over SEEKS SIX GREAT REFORMS 
### 
"The theory of protection is
itself a declaration of war."
"The only way to control for
eign policy is to do away with it
altogether."
"No nation has ever submit
ted any question to The Hague
Tribunal over which it would
have been willing to go to war."
"The economic forces of the
world cannot he governed by po
litical institutions."
"The only recourse we have is
to throw International Law into
the waste basket and replace it
with a system of international
behavior which will be known
not to a few professors, but to
the ordinary man in the street
the world over."
AUGUST SCHVAN.

"The ethical, political, and economic
ideas which are held by our statesmen
grew up under totally different condi
tions than those of the present, and
are completely out of date for our use
today. Through the spread of intelli
gence the people of today do not give
implicit obedience as in the past. The
time is coming when the government
must he the same as the governed.
Modern life is so complex that it is
impossible to legislate for large areas
possessing totally different conditions.
Th s complexity is apparent in your
own country."
M.r. August Sell van prefaced his ad
dress to the men of the University
with these remarks in his talk on
"Some Permanent Conditions of Inter
national Peace." Mr. Schvan is being
sent throughout the country by the
Carnegie Foundation for International
Peace, and his talk last night was un
der the auspices of The Stanford
Union. He was brought to Stanford
particularly through the effo.rts of
Professor E. R. Krehbiel, of the His
tory department.
Mr. Schvan outlined his program for
permanent p?ace, consisting of six re
quirements, the most important of
which are that political lines be drawn
along lines of nationality, that free
trade be universally adopted, and that
world citizenship be established and
the doctrine of extra-territorialit.v be
abandoned.
His purpose in le.cturing in the
United States is to create a belief in
his program here in order that it may
be of influence in the international
congress which must meet in Wash
ington in this or next year for the
discussion of the problems raised by
the present, war. That congress can
undo and outdo the work of the Con
gress of Vienna if it will. President
Wilson has established a reputation
for integrity and courage that will
make any suggestion made by him or
the nations he represents carry great
weight when the problems of the fu
ture of the world come up fo.r discus
sion.
In outlining his steps to peace Mr.
Schvan states that militarism must ex
ist as long as any state holds incom
patible elements within its boundaries.
Each nationality should have Its own
government. What that government
should be could only be determined by
the people of the state.
