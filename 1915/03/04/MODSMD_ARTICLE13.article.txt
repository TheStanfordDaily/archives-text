# TOO AMBITIOUS
## 
### 
Overzealous ambition has been a
stumbling block to the complete suc
cess of Junior Operas for the last two
years. It is natural that the members
of each committee in charge of the
annual third-year production should
try to make the opera, over which they
have supervision, surpass all previous
endeavors. It is essential that the
dramatic event of Junior Week be
something that is worth while, and go
down in the annals of history as a dis
tinguished production. But above all
it is essential that the Junior Opera
should be staged within the limits of
the ticket sales, and that the liabili
ties should not exceed the assets.
If every seat in the Assembly Hall
were sold, the gross return would be
$1247.75. As a general rule Junior
Operas draw larger crowds than any
other dramatic production during the
year. But there is a possibility, yes,
a strong probability, that a hundred or
more tickets will not be sold, ft is
necessary that the committee in
charge discount this amount in esti
mating the general balance sheet and
the relation of assets to liabilities.
The 1911) Junior Opera Committee
cleared expenses, for the reason that
two performances were given. In
1914 it did not seem reasonable to pro
duce the opera more than one evening.
The same was true last year. The
committee had figured on every seat
being sold. In fact, the 1914 commit
tee had estimated far above the ca
pacity of the house. As a result, the
receipts from the operas for the past
two years have not met expenses, and
the financial burden has fallen on the
respective classes.
The .reason for this excess of costs
over receipts is that ambition has
played an important part in carrying
the committee beyond their bounds. It
is necessary to the success of the op
era to have as finished a production
as possible. This depends largely on
the efficiency of the coaching. Lavish
expenditure lias resulted, not so much
in the employment of coaches, but

rather in extensive and elaborate cos
tuming, scenery, and stage properties.
Much of the expenditure heretofore
has been superflnus, due partly to mis
management and partly to overzeal
ous anil)ition. It is hoped that the
1910 Junior Opera Committee will
learn a lesson from the experiences of
former committees, and plan on a
large margin of receipts over ex
penses.
