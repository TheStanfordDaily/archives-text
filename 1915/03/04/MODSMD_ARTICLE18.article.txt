the Pacific Coast, which cannot be in
telligently pursued without reference

The Hemphill collection contains
eight or nine thousand specimens of
living shells of the Pacific Coast, to
gether with his working library of
about 1")0 volumes. The gift comes

for a time Consular-General at Ha
vana. His chief activities in Mexico
however, were in connect.on with the
railway development in that country.
He was for some time vice-president
•and the active executive officer in
Mexico of the Mexican International
Railway, of which C'ollis I'. Hunting
ton was president. During his whole
residence in Mexico he gathered gov
ernment documents, both American
and Mexican, concerning railway de
velopment and transportation, railway
reports, and books on a wide variety
of topics, mostly connected with Mexi
co.
In addition, he made an exceedingly
large collection of newspaper clin
nings, not only on these topics, but on
many others, including the Civil War
period, which he carefully labeled and
bound into packets, acording to top
ics. There are fifteen trunks full of
these clippings.
Professor E. D. Adams and Assistant
Professor P. A. Martin, of the History
department believe that the clippings
will be very useful in historical re
search work. Professor Martin states
that the Mexican news items will be
valuable in the study of the history of
the Latin-American countries, and
Professor Adams believes that the clip
pings made at the time of the Civil
War will be useful for original work
in the history of that period.

active business and devoted all of his
time to filing his materials and collect
ing new matter relating to current his

pastime. It was his desire that his
work should be placed in some great
university. At the time of bis death
in Washington, I). C., in 1912, he left
the material with Mrs. Harper, a
friend of many years, who is the biog
rapher of Susan I?. Anthony, and who
arranged Miss Anthony's literary col
lection and placed it in the Library of
Congress. She was given permission
to dispose of it as she thought best,
and she decided to give it to the alma
mater of her daughter, Mrs. Winifred
Harper Cooley, '9fi.
