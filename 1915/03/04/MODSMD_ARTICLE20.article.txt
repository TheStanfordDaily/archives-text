# GLASS NINES TO CLASH
## Workman Names Players Who Are to Compete in Series For Baseball Title to Begin Monday UNDERCLASS GAME ON MARCH 8 
### 
The first game of the interclass
baseball series will be on Monday,
when the Sophomore and Freshmen
nines meet. The Juniors will oppose
the Seniors a week from today, and
the final game to decide the interclass
baseball championship of 1915 will be
played Tuesday March 16.
The men who will compose the
teams were named by Captain Tom
Workman today. The position wlrch
each man will play will be left to the
captain of the team. A Sophomore
captain will be elected today, and the
first-year men are to choose their
leader tomorrow.
The customary rule that no varsity
man be allowed to play his regular
position will be followed. Tom Work
man will don the catcher's mask. Doc
Hayes will handle infield bingles, and
Dutch Hoever will watch for high ones
in the outer garden.
The annual scramble for the ball be
tween the Sophomores and Frosh will
take place on the rugby turf, instead
of on the varsity diamond, after .Mon
day's game is over.
Capta'n Workmen requests that all
the "S" men lie present at this scuffle,
to sec that the rules governing it are
complied with.

to have the strongest aggregation of
diamond artists, but the Sophomore
nine, with fou.r varsity men, will he a
strong contender.
