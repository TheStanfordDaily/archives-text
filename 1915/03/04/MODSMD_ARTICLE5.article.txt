power and eloquence.
.1. Stitt Wilson related on interest
ing experience which he had in Eng
land years ago, at the meeting yes
terday. During a visit to the east
side of London, he was surprised and
interested to find a beautiful young
woman, in the center of misery and
wretchedness, lending he.r services to
the poverty-stricken and afflicted. The
young woman's name was Miss Pe
thick, and she had been doing settle
ment work there for some time. Mr.
Wilson stated that it gave him an es
pecial pleasure to be aide to greet this
young woman as Mrs. Pethick Law
rence, and to find her in a still broad
er field.
Mrs. Lawrence's early ambition was
to help women to help themselves,
and, with this end in view, she be
came interested in woman suffrage,
hoping by this means to relieve her
s: : x of much of the misery and suffer
ing with which she had seen them
associated in ihe tenement districts of
London. TTcr striking originality ami
vigorous expression won a tremend
ous following in England, where the
mere announcement that she is to
speak is sufficient to insure "standing
room only."
However, Mrs. Lawrence's aim is
not. limited by the interests of the wo
man suffrage movement alone. Re
cent developments of militarism havo
stirred her with the desire to better
conditions in civilization for the race
as a whole. Mrs. Lawrence believes
that the simplest and best way to do this
is to have the women lend a helping
hand. Thus far misery and proverty
are the curse of our race, believes this
noted peace advocate, who finds the
ultimate cure for deplorable condi
tions in the intellectual and education
al improvement of the race itself. The
change in the position of women dur
ing the last, few years makes it pos
sible for them to combine for their
mutual development, declares Mrs.
Lawrence, in the same degree as the
men.

"The Great War and Women's Part
in It" will be the subject of the lec
tures by Mrs. Pethick Lawrence and
M.rs. May Wright Sevvell in the Assem
bly Hall this evening at 8 o'clock.
Mrs. Lawrence won enthusiastic ap
proval in an address in the ballroom
of the Hotel St. Francis in San Fran
cisco yesterday noon. Seldom has a
speaker shown the indisputable gift
of leadership which this remarkable
woman possesses. Her personality is
described as exceptionally interesting,
and her arguments distinguished by a
clarity and directness that is com
pelling in effect. Few personalities
are aide to st!r an audience to enthu
siasm and action with Mrs. Lawrence's
power and eloquence.
.1. Stitt Wilson related on interest
ing experience which he had in Eng
land years ago, at the meeting yes
terday. During a visit to the east
side of London, he was surprised and
interested to find a beautiful young
woman, in the center of misery and
wretchedness, lending he.r services to
the poverty-stricken and afflicted. The
young woman's name was Miss Pe
thick, and she had been doing settle
ment work there for some time. Mr.
Wilson stated that it gave him an es
pecial pleasure to be aide to greet this
young woman as Mrs. Pethick Law
rence, and to find her in a still broad
er field.
Mrs. Lawrence's early ambition was
to help women to help themselves,
and, with this end in view, she be
came interested in woman suffrage,
hoping by this means to relieve her
s: : x of much of the misery and suffer
ing with which she had seen them
associated in ihe tenement districts of
London. TTcr striking originality ami
vigorous expression won a tremend
ous following in England, where the
mere announcement that she is to
speak is sufficient to insure "standing
room only."
However, Mrs. Lawrence's aim is
not. limited by the interests of the wo
man suffrage movement alone. Re
cent developments of militarism havo
stirred her with the desire to better
conditions in civilization for the race
as a whole. Mrs. Lawrence believes
that the simplest and best way to do this
is to have the women lend a helping
hand. Thus far misery and proverty
are the curse of our race, believes this
noted peace advocate, who finds the
ultimate cure for deplorable condi
tions in the intellectual and education
al improvement of the race itself. The
change in the position of women dur
ing the last, few years makes it pos
sible for them to combine for their
mutual development, declares Mrs.
Lawrence, in the same degree as the
men.
