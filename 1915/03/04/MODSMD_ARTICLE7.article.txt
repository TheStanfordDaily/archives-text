## Placing Wheatly at Center Is Only Change in Cardinal Line-Up. 
### 
Nine Cardinal basketball players
will take train for the Blue and Gold
campus tomorrow afternoon to meet
the holders of the Intercollegiate
League t.tle in the second game of
the series being played between Stan
ford and California. No date has as
yet been set for the third contest,
should the visitors earn a victory. A
Blue and Gold success, however, will
bring the intercollegiate series to a
close.
The personnel of the Cardinal squad
w 11 be the same as in the game with
California last Saturday. Worthy,
Blodget, and Schwarzenbek have been
named as forwards. Dolan and Rey
nolds will go as guards. Caughy, Dut
ton, and Wallace will be in suits as
substitutes. The only change in the
line-up is the placing of Wheatly at
canter. lie showed up well in the sec
ond half of the last California con
test, and steady, improvement in the
center position makes him a worthy
opponent of the fast Blue and Gold
tall man, MacKay.
"Eddie" Penaluna will handle the
whistle in Harmon gymnasium. Pen
aluna proved himself to be a referee
of merit in the national championship
games held recently at the Olympic
Club.
