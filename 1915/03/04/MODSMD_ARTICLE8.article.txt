Women's Conference, at its .regular
meeting last night, discussed the in
advisability of women students at
tending any Peninsula and Redwood
dances held on week-nights. Owing
to the impossibility of returning from
such dances before 10:30, the Confer
ence recommends that no one attend
them, as such attendance will be an
infringement of the 10:30 rule.
