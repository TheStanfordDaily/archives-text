# UNION GRANTED LOAN FOR IMPROVEMENTS BY EXECUTIVE BODY
## Sum of Two Thousand Dollars Is Advanced to Governing Boardâ€”Glee Club Receives Aid Towards Southern Trip FRESHMEN ENTER RELAY 
### 
A two-year loan of at 4% was
ganted to The Stanford Union last ev
ening by the Executive Committee of
the Associated Students. This action
will make possible a large number of
improvements which have been plan
ned for The Union, and will enable the
organization to pay off some of the
back debts which have caused consid
erable inconvenience for the last few
months.
Billiard tables, up-to-date periodic
als, a piano, writing tables and mate
rials, and various equipment of all
kinds are included in the want list of
the Governing Board, and the ad
vancement of this sum will make pos
sible the purchase of all these club
house necessities.
The Board has been hampered in its
operations for a considerable period
by the lack of sufficient funds where
with to accomplish its extensive
schemes for making The Union com
fortable and livable. This addition to
the exchequer puts finances on a safe
basis for a couple of years, at least,
and it is expected that at the end of
that time the club will be able to pay
for itself.
