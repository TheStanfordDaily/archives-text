# UNION GRANTED LOAN FOR IMPROVEMENTS BY EXECUTIVE BODY
## Sum of Two Thousand Dollars Is Advanced to Governing Boardâ€”Glee Club Receives Aid Towards Southern Trip FRESHMEN ENTER RELAY 
### 
A two-year loan of at 4% was
ganted to The Stanford Union last ev
ening by the Executive Committee of
the Associated Students. This action
will make possible a large number of
improvements which have been plan
ned for The Union, and will enable the
organization to pay off some of the
back debts which have caused consid
erable inconvenience for the last few
months.
Billiard tables, up-to-date periodic
als, a piano, writing tables and mate
rials, and various equipment of all
kinds are included in the want list of
the Governing Board, and the ad
vancement of this sum will make pos
sible the purchase of all these club
house necessities.
The Board has been hampered in its
operations for a considerable period
by the lack of sufficient funds where
with to accomplish its extensive
schemes for making The Union com
fortable and livable. This addition to
the exchequer puts finances on a safe
basis for a couple of years, at least,
and it is expected that at the end of
that time the club will be able to pay
for itself.
The Executive Committee has ap-
J proved the plan of sending a Fresh
man team to compete in the first-year
relay, which will be held on the Blue
and Gold track in conjunction with
the Illinois-California meet. The sanc
tion of the Faculty Committee on Ath
i lctics must first be obtained, but it is
very probable that the committee will
grant it gladly.
Freshman teams from California.
Southern California, Pomona, Occi
dental, Santa Clara, and possibly Illi
nois, will enter the .relay race, and a
quartet of Cardinal runners will show
to advantage in such a contest.
A loan of $100 was advanced to the
Glee Club, to meet expenses of that
organization during its tour of the
South. This sum will be returned to
the Student Body treasury April ir>.
