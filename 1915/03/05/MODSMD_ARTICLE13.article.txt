# "HORSE PLAY"
## 
### 
Baseball enthusiasts have been ac
customed to cast derision at the de
cisions of the umpire in several close
plays during recent games. This jeer
ing should be, and usually has been,
foreign to the Stanford bleachers. The
source of the unsportsmanlike tactics
may be found in visitors or in new stu
dents, who have been accustomed in
other places to deride the umpire. At
least, we hope that the slurs do not
arise from the older men.
The judgment of any one is liable to
falter. We do not all see things as
others see them. The umpire is hu
man, and subject to error the same as
any one. It is not for us to pass
judgement on his decisions. Enough of
this "horseplay."
