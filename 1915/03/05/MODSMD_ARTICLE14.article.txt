# GAINING PROSPECTUS
## 
### 
Students have an unusual opportu
nity this semester to hear lectures of
110 mean ability on topics of practical
as well as theoretical import. Few
realize the significance of this oppor
tunity. It means that we, in our
small, narrow sphere of activity, can
get a prospectus from the outside
world, brought to us by persons with
analytical minds and ability. In this
way we are able to secure a broader
outlook 011 life and a more thorough
knowledge from which we may draw
our conclusions.
The privileges offered by the talks
given in Encina Hall every Sunday
evening, the series of lectures planned
by The Union Governing Board, and
by the Faculty committees should be
taken advantage of by every one. The
organizations who have planned ttiese
talks are to be commended for their
foresight. Let all receive a broader
prospectus during the remainder of the
semester, through attendance at these
talks.
