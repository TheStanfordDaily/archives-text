Devious are the tricks of the manu
facturer of impure or adulterated
foods and drugs in his effort to sell
inferior products by means of clever
mislabeling and misbranding, accord
ing to Professor Meyer E. Jaffa's en
tertaining lecture, yesterday evening,
on the problems connected with the
work of the State Hoard of Health's
Pure Food and Drug Bureau, of which
he is the director.
Illustrated slides were of the great
est interest, especially those depicting
the differences in the labels of fake
health foods and "cure-all" patent
medicines before and after the enforce
ment of the laws punishing the fraud
ulent and deceitful branding of such
goods. Cartoons and tabulated data
graphically demonstrated on the
screen the progress that has
been made in bringing about pure food
conditions in this state.
Professor Jaffa displayed a keenly
satiric wit in his treatment of such in
jurious frauds as "Pain Killer" and
"Quaker's Balm."
"The simpler the label, the purer the
contents." was one of his most epi
grammatical remarks.
