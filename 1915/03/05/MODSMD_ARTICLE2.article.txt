# WATER, WOMEN AND SONG MIX IN FROLIC
## Freshmen Fair Ones Forced to Flee in Fright From Fear of Faucet 
### 
A mixture of cries, yells, cheers, and
shrieks that distinctly savored of the
feminine, rent the air last evening
about nine o'clock, and decidedly dis
turbed the quietude and solitude of the
peace-loving community. Those per
sons separated by distance, and whose
ears were not trained to distinguish
noises produced by girlish vocal
cords from those made by men, were
inclined to believe that a rally was in
progress, and consequently rushed to
the sound of activities with open throt
tle.
Which activities were nothing of
greater importance than the dying
gasps of the freshmen end of a wo
man's interclass rush. Light shed up
on the matter by passing automobiles
revealed three busses loaded to the
gunwales with fair members of the
class of 1918, returning from a chape
roned picnic at Woodside. Earlier in
the evening the women had congregat
ed at Ravenswood to evade the pos
sible thwarting of their plans. Dur
ing their absence, however, Revenge
and Sophomores had formed a partner
ship, which succeeded in "stacking"
every freshman room in Sororityville.
Arriving on the campus the picnicers
found an army of "roughs" on hand as
interested spectators. Chagrined, the
jolly party embarked again in their
three arks and sailed gleefully down
Lasuen to a more secluded landing
place. Whereupon, to carry out the
metaphor, water and hose were added
to the tragedy's list of properties,
which means that the army of the un
employed had called for reinforce
ments. which, under the able leader
ship of General Searsville, succeeded
in routing the enemy, with their spir
its, etc., considerably dampened.
Upon seeking their homes, the pic
nic maids found doors locked and
sophomores in evidence. Fearing the
worst, shelter for the night had to be
sought at Roble and under the roofs of
friends in Palo Alto, the college city.
