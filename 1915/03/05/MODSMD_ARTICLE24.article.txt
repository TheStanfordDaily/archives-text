The Junior-Senior Jolly-Up Commit
tee have planned to make the in
formal on March 12th, in Encina Club
room, one of unusual interest. Spe
cial effort was made to secure a closed
date, fo that other campus events
should not conflict, and under these
conditions it is expected that a large
percentage of Seniors, Juniors, and
holdovers will attend. The informal
dance will furnish an unusually en
joyable "get-together."
The Cliff House orchestra, which the
committee has secured, is especially
well recommended, and will score
heavily in the entertainment of the
evening.
Between dances a unique series of
stunts have been planned, among which
is a quartet composed of S. C. Walker,
'15, W, E. Dunlap, '15, .T. W. Bennett,
'15, and C. M. Miller, '14. With a view
to surprises, an attractive menu for
the "eats" has been arranged.
