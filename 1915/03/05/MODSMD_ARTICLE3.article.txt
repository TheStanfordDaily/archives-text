# Launch Campaign to Make Swimming a Minor Sport
## 
### 
A campaign to put swimming on the
basis of a minor intercollegiate sport
was commenced last night, when A. E.
Worthy, '15, and Dr. li .R. Stolz spoke
informally before a number of men as
sembled in the Stanford Union. Wor
thy said that he believed some sort of
organization began this semester, even
if under rather unfavorable conditions,
would pave the way for larger things
following the completion of the gym
nasium swimming tank.
Dr. Stolz discussed the opportunities
open to the swimming team organized
this semester. He stated that, aside
from the interclass races, which here
tofore have been a Junior Day event
on Lagunita, a number of swimming
clubs and high school teams have al
ready made challenges for a meet with
Stanford, and that if a swimming team
were organized it would always be
sure of competition with outside teams.
Following the discussion of the team
organization, Dr. Stolz spoke of the
possibilities to be realized from the
new tank to be situated near the gym
nasium now under construction, "in
many respects," said Dr. Stolz, "the
Stanford tank will be better fitted for
competition than the one at the Uni
versity of California, or even the Olym
pic Club. We hope to have the best
pool on the coast for competition."
Following the adjournment of the
meet'ng twenty men present signified
their intention to go out for the team,
and signed up accordingly. A list will
be posted in Encina Gymnasium, ami
all who are interested in swimming as
a sport are urged to get behind it, and
go out for the team.
