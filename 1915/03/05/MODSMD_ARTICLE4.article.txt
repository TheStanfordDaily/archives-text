# INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WAR AND WOMEN CLEARLY DEFINED
## PERMANENT PEACE URGED Great Earthly Crime Discussed From Point of View of Truth in Lawrence-Sewall Lectures

Mrs. Pethick Lawrence, of London,
and Mrs. May Wright Sewell, director
of the Women's Peace Conference of
the Panama-Pacific Exposition, point
