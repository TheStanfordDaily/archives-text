# INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WAR AND WOMEN CLEARLY DEFINED
## PERMANENT PEACE URGED Great Earthly Crime Discussed From Point of View of Truth in Lawrence-Sewall Lectures 
### 
Mrs. Pethick Lawrence, of London,
and Mrs. May Wright Sewell, director
of the Women's Peace Conference of
the Panama-Pacific Exposition, point
ed out the intimate connection between
women and war in the Assembly Hall
last evening. Mrs. Pethick Lawrence
spoke also upon the devastation and
hor.ror already wrought by the great
conflict.
"Never was there a greater illusion
than that represented in the statement
that women want the vote because
they are unable to fight or go to war,"
declared Mrs. Lawrence in her charac
teristically vigorous fashion. "The wo
men are protected by conventions,
words, and traditions until the crisis
really comes, and then it is they who
suffer most. The very first deaths in
England after the present war was
declared were those of the weaker part
of the nation, the women and babies.
To understand what women have suf
fered may be readily realized when we
stop to consider that, when a country
is invaded, it is not the men who pro
tect the homes and children, much as
they should like to do so, but that it is
always the mothers who are left be
hind to act in this regard. Left un
protected and unassisted these women
face terrors which no soldier in the
ranks is ever called upon to confront.
"'Newspapers and h'stories never
say anything of women's sufferings in
war. Is it because the story is too
terrible for the human heart to bea.r?
Even war in these modern times is war
upon women and children. Five times
as many women as men died in the
last Boer war. counting the numbers
of men who met death after severe
wounds or as a result of disease.
"Tt has been said that the allies will
attempt to end the war by starving
out the Germans? It is the poor who
are going to starve, and the weakest
first. The wailing of the bebies for
food will only be stilled in death, but
as long as there is bread in the coun
try the army will continue to be fed.
"Why should the mothers bring boys
into the world for ultimate sacrifice,
or the girls merely for suffering? The
work of my 1 fe, my vocation, as well
as that of every social .reformer in
England, has been swept away by the
war, as though by a swift tide, leaving
only the smooth sands behind. The
whole human race is already behind
generations in development, and is
not even where it was when we started
our work years ago.
"1 am on the Pacific Coast because I
believe in the growth of the human
heart," declared Mrs. Sewell, "and in
the growth of human affection. That
is why there is to be a conference of
Women's Peace Workers, to promote
permanent peace. It is the duty of the
young women to make that confidence
typical of the whole world, and, by the
cultivation of universal affection to
make one round universal world."
Mr. Pethick Lawrence followed Mrs.
Sewell, and explained a means by
which the present war might be made
a future impossibility. "A great deal
about the war passes comprehension,"
declared Mr. Lawrence. "We read
about what it is costing nations to
fight in the present crisis. Destruction
and wasting in war is extraordinarily
great. In the American Civil War over
a billion dollars were expended, while
in the present European war a billion
is being spent every few weeks. The
total expenditures of the American
Revolution is being spent every few
days in the present war. The total
wealth of a city the size of San Fran
cisco is being destroyed every ten
clays or fortnight. If this war goes
on, every single family in Europe will
be in debt approximately $4000, and
the income of many of these families
does not exceed $150 to $200 per year.
"The total number of men who
fought in the American Revolution is
not so large as the number that is be
ing killed every month in the present
war. These deaths are not those of
old people, who have come to the end
of life, but of those in the flower of
life. Many others are injured by
wounds which unfit them for partici
pation in future activity. Disease is
another important consideration. More
over this war is really a civil war, ard
between countries with the same out
look on life, and between those who
are inter-related by blood.
"If the war goes on until one or the
other side is supreme the victorious
side will not accept anything but hu
miliating terms from the other. I
through a conference of neutral na
tions Germany and Austria, on the one
side, and England, France and Russia
on the other, could be made to state
what their terms of peace are at the
present time, it would probably not be
difficult to adjust conditions now. But
if more waiting is done one side will
demand humiliating terms from th
other.
"War is becoming more and more
terrible because weapons of destruc
tion arc becoming so much more ter
rible.. Not. tens of thousands of peo
ple arc being destroyed today, but
millions. At this rate of war the fu
ture will undoubtedly result in exter
minating the human race. A class o r
particularly absurd people who I e
lieve in war say that it is inevitable
and refer to us as self-interested
dreamers. It is certainly not the re
verse of self-interest that urges men tc
go away from home, to leave all bo
hind, to face hardship, death am"
crime, for an idea that doing so mcir
'doing something out of the ordinary.'
"The t'me is coming when you can
not be considered a good citizen of the
iTnited States, of England, or of Ger
many, if you are a bad citizen of the
world. Define the concrete things
which you can do here and now,and yen
can work to help bring this devastat
ing war to an earlier end than would
be otherwise possible."
Dr. Jordan, who introduced the
speakers, declared that they had dis
cussed war, the greatest crime on
earth, from the point of view of truth,
for all war is directed against women
children, men, and the existence t f the
human race

upon women and children. Five times

"1 am on the Pacific Coast because I

about the war passes comprehension,"
declared Mr. Lawrence. "We read
about what it is costing nations to
fight in the present crisis. Destruction
and wasting in war is extraordinarily
great. In the American Civil War over
a billion dollars were expended, while
in the present European war a billion
is being spent every few weeks. The
total expenditures of the American
Revolution is being spent every few
days in the present war. The total
wealth of a city the size of San Fran
cisco is being destroyed every ten
clays or fortnight. If this war goes
on, every single family in Europe will
be in debt approximately $4000, and
the income of many of these families
does not exceed $150 to $200 per year.
"The total number of men who
fought in the American Revolution is
not so large as the number that is be

war. These deaths are not those of
old people, who have come to the end

life. Many others are injured by
wounds which unfit them for partici

another important consideration. More
over this war is really a civil war, ard
between countries with the same out

are inter-related by blood.
"If the war goes on until one or the
other side is supreme the victorious
side will not accept anything but hu
miliating terms from the other. I

typical of the whole world, and, by the
cultivation of universal affection to
make one round universal world."
Mr. Pethick Lawrence followed Mrs.
Sewell, and explained a means by
which the present war might be made
a future impossibility. "A great deal
about the war passes comprehension,"
declared Mr. Lawrence. "We read
about what it is costing nations to
fight in the present crisis. Destruction
and wasting in war is extraordinarily
great. In the American Civil War over
a billion dollars were expended, while
in the present European war a billion
is being spent every few weeks. The
total expenditures of the American
Revolution is being spent every few
days in the present war. The total
wealth of a city the size of San Fran
cisco is being destroyed every ten
clays or fortnight. If this war goes
on, every single family in Europe will
be in debt approximately $4000, and
the income of many of these families
does not exceed $150 to $200 per year.
"The total number of men who
fought in the American Revolution is
not so large as the number that is be
ing killed every month in the present
war. These deaths are not those of
old people, who have come to the end
of life, but of those in the flower of
life. Many others are injured by
wounds which unfit them for partici
pation in future activity. Disease is
another important consideration. More
over this war is really a civil war, ard
between countries with the same out
look on life, and between those who
are inter-related by blood.
"If the war goes on until one or the
other side is supreme the victorious
side will not accept anything but hu
miliating terms from the other. I
through a conference of neutral na
tions Germany and Austria, on the one
side, and England, France and Russia
on the other, could be made to state
what their terms of peace are at the
present time, it would probably not be
difficult to adjust conditions now. But
if more waiting is done one side will
demand humiliating terms from th
other.
"War is becoming more and more
terrible because weapons of destruc
tion arc becoming so much more ter
rible.. Not. tens of thousands of peo
ple arc being destroyed today, but
millions. At this rate of war the fu
ture will undoubtedly result in exter
minating the human race. A class o r
particularly absurd people who I e
lieve in war say that it is inevitable
and refer to us as self-interested
dreamers. It is certainly not the re
verse of self-interest that urges men tc
go away from home, to leave all bo
hind, to face hardship, death am"
crime, for an idea that doing so mcir
'doing something out of the ordinary.'
"The t'me is coming when you can
not be considered a good citizen of the
iTnited States, of England, or of Ger
many, if you are a bad citizen of the
world. Define the concrete things
which you can do here and now,and yen
can work to help bring this devastat
ing war to an earlier end than would
be otherwise possible."
Dr. Jordan, who introduced the
speakers, declared that they had dis
cussed war, the greatest crime on
earth, from the point of view of truth,
for all war is directed against women
children, men, and the existence t f the
human race
Mrs. Pethick Lawrence, of London,
and Mrs. May Wright Sewell, director
of the Women's Peace Conference of
the Panama-Pacific Exposition, point
ed out the intimate connection between
women and war in the Assembly Hall
last evening. Mrs. Pethick Lawrence
spoke also upon the devastation and
hor.ror already wrought by the great
conflict.
"Never was there a greater illusion
than that represented in the statement
that women want the vote because
they are unable to fight or go to war,"
declared Mrs. Lawrence in her charac
teristically vigorous fashion. "The wo
men are protected by conventions,
words, and traditions until the crisis
really comes, and then it is they who
suffer most. The very first deaths in
England after the present war was
declared were those of the weaker part
of the nation, the women and babies.
To understand what women have suf
fered may be readily realized when we
stop to consider that, when a country
is invaded, it is not the men who pro
tect the homes and children, much as
they should like to do so, but that it is
always the mothers who are left be
hind to act in this regard. Left un
protected and unassisted these women
face terrors which no soldier in the
ranks is ever called upon to confront.
"'Newspapers and h'stories never
say anything of women's sufferings in
war. Is it because the story is too
terrible for the human heart to bea.r?
Even war in these modern times is war
upon women and children. Five times
as many women as men died in the
last Boer war. counting the numbers
of men who met death after severe
wounds or as a result of disease.
"Tt has been said that the allies will
attempt to end the war by starving
out the Germans? It is the poor who
are going to starve, and the weakest
first. The wailing of the bebies for
food will only be stilled in death, but
as long as there is bread in the coun
try the army will continue to be fed.
"Why should the mothers bring boys
into the world for ultimate sacrifice,
or the girls merely for suffering? The
work of my 1 fe, my vocation, as well
as that of every social .reformer in
England, has been swept away by the
war, as though by a swift tide, leaving
only the smooth sands behind. The
whole human race is already behind
generations in development, and is
not even where it was when we started
our work years ago.
"1 am on the Pacific Coast because I
believe in the growth of the human
heart," declared Mrs. Sewell, "and in
the growth of human affection. That
is why there is to be a conference of
Women's Peace Workers, to promote
permanent peace. It is the duty of the
