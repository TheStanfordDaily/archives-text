Stanford and California will play the
second contest of the three-game bas
ketball series between the rival col

Nine Cardinal players packed up their
suits and left this afternoon for their
one-night stand on the Blue and Gold
campus. Final practice held in En
cina Gymnasium yesterday afternoon
found the squad in fast form.
The five which the local boys will
meet has not been defeated by a col

the season, however, they dropped a
game to the Olympic Club, and to the
Oakland Y. M. C. A. California may
be handicapped tomorrow night by the
loss of their star forward, Norton, who
is reported as being on the sick lis*.

been announced. Norton lias been
the most valuable player on the Blue
and Gold squad, as far as point-win
ning : s concerned, having scored 72
points in five games.

ford line-up are Blodget, Worthy, for
wards; Wheatly, center; Dolan. Re.v
robls, guards; Ciughev,
