and the University telephone exchange.

building and the concrete Steps facing
the Woman's Club House are now be
ing removed. The door will be used
as a mail entrance. The stamp, mon
ey order, and postal savings windows
will face north, and will occupy nearly
the same place as the brick partition
has heretofore. The line of private
mail boxes will be extended straight to
the north side. Letter drops will be
placed opposite the main entrance on
Lasuen street, and a large bin for mail
addressed to the University Library

A feature of the improvements will
be the installation of patent combina
