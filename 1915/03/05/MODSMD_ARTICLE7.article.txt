# "Methods of Ancients" Is Engineering Lecture Topic
## 
### 
The first of a series of illustrated
lectures on "The History of Bridge
Construction,' to be delivered by J. D.
Galloway, of San Francisco, was given
yesterday afternoon in room 283 of the
Engineering building. Mr. Galloway
commenced his lecture with descrip
tions of the first construction work
done by the Egyptians. An explanation
of the building of the pyramids and
temples which preceded actual bridge
work was given by means of lantern
slides. According to Mr. Galloway, the
first real bridge was constructed by
the second queen of Babylon, who
wished to leave a monument by which
she would be remembered.
Different phases of Roman architec
ture were also touchcd upon. The cur
rent belief that arches originated with
the Romans was declared to be untrue,
since they were known to be employed
by the Egyptians before a Rome civ
ilization had been established.
Next Thursday at the same time and
place the second lecture will be deliv
ered by Mr. Galloway. He will con
tinue the first lecture at the point at
which it was dropped today. Through
out the series a comparison of meth
ods of ancient and modern construc
tion will be made.
