# FENCING CHAMPIONSHIP SLATED FOR MARCH 22
## 
### 
The University fencing champion
ship will lie decided on March 22, and
not on March Ifi, in conjunction with
the boxing and wrestling tournaments,
as previously planned. The new ma
terial has been showing steady im
provement, so that it is deemed unad
visable to bold the bout before ample
time for preparation has been given.
The preliminary bouts will be held in
Roble Gymnasium at the meeting of
Foil and Mask a week before the
championship bout is staged. On ac
count of its superior lighting facilities
Roble Gymnasium bas been chosen for
the final contest on Ma.rch 22.
