Langworthy Club was founded Oc
tober 11, 1911, and was granted its
charter last semester. A ruling of
Pan-Hellenic, limiting the number of
sororities on the campus to eight, does
not apply to this case, for the reason
that Langworthy Club had petitioned
Chi Omega before the .ruling was made.

in 189") at the University of Arkansas,
