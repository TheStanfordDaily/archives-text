# WHITE SOX WILL CLASH WITH SWORD VARSITY
## Powerful Aggregation to Be Led by Ed Walsh HAYES TO WORK ON MOUND Fast Exhibition of Baseball Is Assured For Tomorrow's Gameâ€”Stanford Band Will Entertain 
### 
Fans of the great American pastime
will be offered a .royal treat tomorrow
afternoon when Comiskey's White Sox
invade the campus tor a set-to with
the Stanford Varsity. The exhibition
promises to provide the classiest ar
ticle of baseball staged for many sea
sons.
The Chicago American team, which
is scheduled to make its appearance
tomorrow includes eleven players,
nine of them being regulars, and two
utility men. Every member of the
White Sox aggregation chosen to make
the trip was 011 the payroll of the club
last year.
"Big Ed" Walsh, .renowned for his
spitter, who is in charge of the nine,
will start the game on the firing line.
Faber and Wolfgange, two regulars on
the staff, are booked to twirl later in
the game. Kuhn, erstwhile Portland
Pacific Coast League catcher, who
now shares the honors with Schalk,
will hold down the big league pitching
stars. The infield will be the same as
used all of last season, with the ex
ception that Buck Weaver will be miss
ing. Fournier, the hard-hitting French
man, will play first base; Lim Berger
is to cover the second sack; Black
bourne, a fielding sensation, will scoop
'em u]> around short, while Breton,
another regular, is to occupy third
base. In the pasture, Demmitt, Roth,
and Daly will hold forth, reading from
left to .right, respectively.
George Hildebrand, one of the best
bets in the American League, as um
pire has been secured to call balls and
strikes. Since it is necessary to offer
the Sox a good-sized guarantee, Man
ager Wilcox announces that season
tickets will be replaced by a twenty
five-cent admission fee. To add to the
gayety of the occasion the Stanford
Band will make its first appearance of
the year at an athletic attraction, un
der the leadership of J. A. Gibb, '15.
The game will commence promptly at
three o'clock.
Coach Billy O.t r has selected a strong
team to oppose the invaders. Doc
Hayes, who held St. Ignatius to
four scattered hits last Thursday, will
work in conjunction with Dent as a
battery. The only doubtful place in
the field is second base. Owing to the
sickness of his father, Stafford may
not be able to don a suit. In that case
Dickie will again be called on to fill
the position. Captain Workman, at
first, Stevens at shortstop, and Mc-
Closkey at third base, are to complete
the infield. Day and Austin will occu
py left and center fields, while the
right garden duty will be shared by
Downing and Noonan.
