# NECESSITY OF FAITH IS SUNDAY SERMON THEME
## Reverend McCartney, of Chicago, Points Out Essentials for Successful Realization of Ideals. 
### 
The Reverend Albert Joseph McCart
ney, of the Kenwood Evangelical
church, of Chicago, presided in the Me
morial Church yesterday. He took
as his text "And David was greatly
distressed; for the people spake of
stoning him, because the soul of the
people was grieved, every man for his
sons and for his daughters: but David
encouraged himself in the Lord his
God."
Mr. McCartney pointed out the ne
cessity of faith and the relation be
tween faith and courage, which is es
sential to the successful realization
of ambitions and of pure and high
ideals.
The minister explained the circum
stances in which David struggled
against all difficulties and turned de
feat into victory. In speaking of the
reasons for David's triumph, Mr. Mc-
Cartney said:
"There is no greater lesson than that
of self-reliance â€”the lesson of encour
agement. The game of life must be
played alone; however strong we have
felt ourselves there comes a time when
we are to take the last step, and we
must have courage."
The choir sang Bennett's "God Is a
Spirit."
