# De Groot Shows Value of Playground Recreation
## 
### 
That the real melting pots of for
eign nations in America are the pub
lic recreation parks of the large cities
was asserted by E. C. De Groot, the
new San Francisco playgrounds di
rector, in an interesting Encina lec
ture yesterday evening.
Mr. De Groot illustrated his lecture
with views contrasting rural play with
that of the crowded city streets, and
showing many scenes taken in the
Chicago municipal playgrounds, of
which he was director before coming
to the coast a few months ago. This
gigantic work, vast in scope and
minute in detail, is the .result of the
expenditure of fifteen million dollars
by the city of Chicago. Three-quarters
of a million are devoted annually to
the maintenance of its thirty or more
playgrounds, the purpose of which is
to afford city children opportunity for
vigorous constructive recreation.
In architectural design, as well as in
size and general purposes, the Chicago
movement compares favorably with
the ancient systems of Athens and
Rome.
Several thoughts emphasized by Mr.
De Groot were:
"The playground movement is one
of social uplift. The average fellow,
as well as the average girl, goes wrong
during liesure hours. Child idleness,
not child labor, is the big danger.
Wholesome play environment con
duces to rational child development;
and adequate facilities for healthy rec
reation are provided by the modern
playgrounds.
"In San Francisco, as in Chicago,
houses are built like postoffice boxes
in the poorer districts. Denied the
opportunity for active sports, growing
boys turn to such passive amusements
as crap-shooting."
The Mandolin Club appeared for the
first time this year, playing several
lively selections previous to Mr. De
Groot's talk.
