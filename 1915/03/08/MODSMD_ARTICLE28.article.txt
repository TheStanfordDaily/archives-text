# CHACE ESTABLISHES NEW MARK ON STATE HIGHWAY
## 
### 
John Derrol Chace, *16, Varsity quar
ter-miler, has proven the fact that his
speed is not limited alone to the cinder
path. Saturday evening, while return
ing in his machine from the races at
the Exposition at a pace well over the
state limit, he was detected by the
eagle eye of Motor-cop Logan, of San
Mateo county, who dated him up with
the Justice of the Peace of Redwood
City for a hearing this afternoon.
