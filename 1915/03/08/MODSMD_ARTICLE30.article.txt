# ESTIMATES MADE OF UNION FINANCE
## Present Rate For Dues Maintained to Prevent a Deficit 
### 
Despite an impression current about
the campus that the membership dues
.n The Stanford University have been
placed at too high a rate, an investiga
tion of the standing of The Union
finances seems to show that the rate
fixed will have to be maintained, un
less the new clubhouse is to run be
hind in its finances.
With an $8000 debt, on which the in
terest must be paid, and to meet which
a sinking fund has to be created, and
heavy current expenses, amounting to
nearly $190 a month, the financial sup
port of the students is essential at this
time. As Tlie Union stands today it is
worth approximately $-10,000, $36,000
of which has been paid in. Of this
amount the present students have con
tributed $070. At present The Union
belongs to the alumni.
It has been necessary to use all the
proceeds from life memberships and
paid up subscriptions to date in con
struction, and future memberships
must be relied on to meet current ex
penses. S. S. Simonson, '15, chairman
of the Finance Committee of the Gov
erning Board, estimated the current
expenses of the building per month as
follows: Manager and janitor service,
$60; water, $8; heat (University steam
heating), $28; light, $20; upkeep of
grounds, $15; bookeeping, $10; period
icals, 6.50; total, $146.50.
Besides these are the fixed overhead
expenses, which, computed by the year,
are: Taxes, $200; interest on debt of
$8000, $320; repairs and maintenance,
$100; total, $620.
This makes a monthly overhead ex
pense of $52, and a total monthly ex
pense of $198. Rents will bring in ap
proximately $90, and the remaining
$108 mpst be met by student member
ship dues. Most of these expenses are
for twelve months in the year. If there
is to be any sinking fund to meet the
debts owed by the Board of Trustees
of the University and to the Associat
ed Students it is essential that at least
five hundred students pay the present
membership dues of two dollars a se
mester. If the membership next se
mester can be made to exceed that
number, the time of paying interest
on the debt will be lessened just that
much.
The Union will be worth two dollars
a semester to any student. The $2000
loaned by the Executive Committee
w'.ll be used to add to the attractive
ness of the place. A pool and billiard
table have already been purchased
from the Brunswick-Balke-Collender
Co., in San Francisco, and are already
installed on the main floor, where
they may be used at any time by mem
bers. A piano will be acquired imme
diately, and some of the money will go
into card tables with chairs, poker
chips. dominoes, cribbage boards and
counters; part of the remainder will
be used to add minor furnishings in
the building and to fix up the grounds.

a sinking fund has to be created, and
heavy current expenses, amounting to
nearly $190 a month, the financial sup
port of the students is essential at this
time. As Tlie Union stands today it is
worth approximately $-10,000, $36,000
of which has been paid in. Of this
amount the present students have con
tributed $070. At present The Union
belongs to the alumni.
It has been necessary to use all the
proceeds from life memberships and
paid up subscriptions to date in con
struction, and future memberships
must be relied on to meet current ex
penses. S. S. Simonson, '15, chairman
of the Finance Committee of the Gov
erning Board, estimated the current
expenses of the building per month as
follows: Manager and janitor service,
$60; water, $8; heat (University steam
heating), $28; light, $20; upkeep of
grounds, $15; bookeeping, $10; period
icals, 6.50; total, $146.50.
Besides these are the fixed overhead
expenses, which, computed by the year,
are: Taxes, $200; interest on debt of
$8000, $320; repairs and maintenance,
$100; total, $620.
This makes a monthly overhead ex
pense of $52, and a total monthly ex
pense of $198. Rents will bring in ap
proximately $90, and the remaining
$108 mpst be met by student member
ship dues. Most of these expenses are
for twelve months in the year. If there
is to be any sinking fund to meet the
debts owed by the Board of Trustees
of the University and to the Associat
ed Students it is essential that at least
five hundred students pay the present
membership dues of two dollars a se
mester. If the membership next se
mester can be made to exceed that
number, the time of paying interest
on the debt will be lessened just that
much.
The Union will be worth two dollars
a semester to any student. The $2000
loaned by the Executive Committee
w'.ll be used to add to the attractive
ness of the place. A pool and billiard
table have already been purchased
from the Brunswick-Balke-Collender
Co., in San Francisco, and are already
installed on the main floor, where
they may be used at any time by mem
bers. A piano will be acquired imme
diately, and some of the money will go
into card tables with chairs, poker
chips. dominoes, cribbage boards and
counters; part of the remainder will
be used to add minor furnishings in
the building and to fix up the grounds.
Despite an impression current about
the campus that the membership dues
.n The Stanford University have been
placed at too high a rate, an investiga
tion of the standing of The Union
finances seems to show that the rate
fixed will have to be maintained, un
less the new clubhouse is to run be
hind in its finances.
