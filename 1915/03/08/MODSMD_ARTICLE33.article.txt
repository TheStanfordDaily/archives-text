# VARSITY WINS SLUGFEST
## IRELAND'S INDEPENDENTS DEFEATED 6 TO 1 Heavy Hitting in First Three Innings by Cardinal Batsmen Puts Game on Ice—Contest Featured by Great Fielding 
### 
Successive volleys of hits and
bingles to all corners of the lot by the
Cardinal clubswingers during the early
part of Saturday's game, put to route
all holies of Cliff Ireland, and resulted
'.n an easy Stanford victory by the
score of 6 to 1.
The good-sized lead established at
the outset of the game allowed Gus
Iloever to take matters decidedly easy
during his stay on the mound. Al
though nine hits were chalked up
against the big right-hander, only one
run was squeezed across the plate.
In fielding, batting and base
running the Varsity excelled. In the
seventh inning McCloskey stabbed a
sure hit with his gloved hand, and in
addition nabbed a number of difficult
fouls. Dent's sure peg did not allow an
Independent to steal a bag, while eight
pilfered bases were hung up by the
Stanford runners.
The Varsity started to score right off
the jump. Austin, first up, lined a hit
to center. Day sacrificed. Workman
followed with a sharp bingle over sec
ond. Dent put joy in the hearts of the
fans by slamming out a pinch hit,
which allowed both Austin and Dent to
tap the plate.
The second frame was a repetition
of the first. After Stevens fanned,
Dickie commenced activities by drop
ping the horse-hide somewhere out in
left field. Hoever singled infield. Aus
tin brought Dickie across the pan,
when he registered his second bingle.
Day continued the merry-go-round by
slamming another hit through the
p'tcher's box. tallying Hoever. During
the respite that followed, Austin sur
prised the Independents by stealing
home. Skipper Workman added to the
troubles of Twirler Cy Young by
screeching a hot one to left. Day,
however, ended the agony by being
caught attempting home on the play.
The final score of the game was
made in the last half of the same in
ning, when O'Neill registered on his
own hit. stolen base, wild pitch, and
McKune's error of Steven's hard
grounder.

Successive volleys of hits and
bingles to all corners of the lot by the
Cardinal clubswingers during the early
part of Saturday's game, put to route
all holies of Cliff Ireland, and resulted
'.n an easy Stanford victory by the
score of 6 to 1.
The good-sized lead established at
the outset of the game allowed Gus
Iloever to take matters decidedly easy
during his stay on the mound. Al
though nine hits were chalked up
against the big right-hander, only one
run was squeezed across the plate.
In fielding, batting and base
running the Varsity excelled. In the
seventh inning McCloskey stabbed a
sure hit with his gloved hand, and in
addition nabbed a number of difficult
fouls. Dent's sure peg did not allow an
Independent to steal a bag, while eight
pilfered bases were hung up by the
Stanford runners.
The Varsity started to score right off
the jump. Austin, first up, lined a hit
to center. Day sacrificed. Workman
followed with a sharp bingle over sec
ond. Dent put joy in the hearts of the
fans by slamming out a pinch hit,
which allowed both Austin and Dent to
tap the plate.
The second frame was a repetition
of the first. After Stevens fanned,
Dickie commenced activities by drop
ping the horse-hide somewhere out in
left field. Hoever singled infield. Aus
tin brought Dickie across the pan,
when he registered his second bingle.
Day continued the merry-go-round by
slamming another hit through the
p'tcher's box. tallying Hoever. During
the respite that followed, Austin sur
prised the Independents by stealing
home. Skipper Workman added to the
troubles of Twirler Cy Young by
screeching a hot one to left. Day,
however, ended the agony by being
caught attempting home on the play.
The final score of the game was
made in the last half of the same in
ning, when O'Neill registered on his
own hit. stolen base, wild pitch, and
McKune's error of Steven's hard
grounder.
