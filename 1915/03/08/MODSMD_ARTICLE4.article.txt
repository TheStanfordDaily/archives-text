fore the champion California quintet
on Harmon Gymnasium court in the
final fight of the season. The game
ended the series for the local players,

the end of the first half the score stood
16 to 9.
The opening line-up for Stanford
was Blodget and Worthy, forwards;

Wallace. Caughey substituted for Rey
nolds during the last ten minutes of
the game.
California's line-up stood: Emb.ry
and Mayo, guards; Foster, center;
Sliarpe and MacKay, forwards. House

before a team which bas taken the
measure of the Olympic Club squad of
San Francisco, the champions of the
United States.

ter their picture has been taken fo.r
