# FOUNDERS' DAY WILL BE APPROPRIATELY OBSERVED
## Fitting Exercises Prepared For Morning Celebration—Informality to Mark Afternoon and Evening 
### 
Preparations for tomorrow's Found
ers' Day celebration are complete in
every detail —speeches are written and
learned, the musical numbers are
carefully .rehearsed, and a tasty din
ner is arranged for the wind-up in the
evening.
At ten o'clock the members of the
Senior class will meet in the Chapel.
Seats in the Assembly Hall have been
reserved for them, and at half past
ten they will occupy their places in
the Assembly Hall, to the strains of
the Processional. The Seniors will be
followed by Chancellor Jordan and
President Branner. Tickets of admis
sion to the exercises may be obtained
at the Assembly Hall doo.r tomorrow
morning.
The program will be opened with an
overture by the Stanford Band, "Der
Geist der Wojewoden," by Grossman.
The Seniors will enter the Assembly
Hall to Wagner's "Tannhauser," the
Processional of the Day. Following the
appearance of the Senior class, the
Band will interpret Nevin's Suite, "Un
Gio.ro in Venezia" in its four parts—
Alba, Gondolieri, Canzone, and Ruono
Notti.
Chancellor David Starr Jordan will
next delivsr his address, "The Founda
tion Ideals of Stanford University." In
treating with the subject, Dr. Jordan
will give expression to the ideas and
ideals which inspired the noted Found
er in his conception of Stanford Uni
versity.
At the conclusion of this speech, the
audience assembled will rise, and sing
"Hail, Stanford. Hail." The Seniors
will .retire from the hall in a body to
the Recessional, Losey's "Stabat Ma
ter." The audience is requested to re
main seated until the Seniors have
left the Assembly Hall,
After the ceremonies in the Assem
bly Hall, the Seniors will accompany
the Flower Committee to the Mauso
leum and there Miss Retty Taff, '15,
and G. A. Jacomini, '15, will enter the
Tomb and place flowers at the grave
of Senator and Mrs. Stanford, as a tri-

Bute to the memory of the Founders.
At half past three o'clock in the af
ternoon, the Stanford Varsity will line
up against a representative nine of
the Chicago White Sox. The skill of
these players is well-known, and a
lively contest may be expected, as the
Cardinal aggregation has already
shown to advantage this season.
The Founders' Day dinner will com
mence at six o'clock in the Women's
Club House. A very delicious menu
will be served, with cream chicken as
the chief "piece de resistance." Dr. J.
M. Stillman, Vice-President of the Uni
versity, will act as toastmaster of the
evening, and under his witty guidance
it is promised that the .responses will
be short, to the point, and well worth
hearing.
The University Quartet, consisting
of D. P. Dunlap, S. C. Walker, J. W.
Bennett, and W. C. Lynch, will liven
up the courses with a few well-chosen
musical hits.
After the repast, the merrymakers
will tread the boards in The Union.
The dance will be very informal, and
The Rand has very graciously offered
its services as chief dispenser of mu
sic.
Every thing has been done to make
the exercises in the morning and the
more informal entertainment later in
the day very attractive. The Faculty
Committee of Public Exercises has
made all possible arrangements for
the morning's program, and much of
the detail has been arranged by As
sistant Professor P. J. Treat, chairman
of the committee.
Miss Elizabeth Wright, '08, and As
s'stant Registrar .T. E. McDowell. '00,
assisted by the Governing Roard of the
two club houses, as well as by Cap and
Gown and Skull and Snakes, have
spared no effort in making the dinner
and dance productive of pleasure to
every one.
Such sacrifice deserves a hearty ap
preciation on the part of the students
and alumni. This appreciation can best
be expressed by attendance at the ex
ercises and at the dinner.
