# SPIRIT OF QUIET HOMAGE CHARACTERIZES THE ASSEMBLY HALL AUDIENCE
## ADDRESS INSPIRING TO ALL Intimate Picture of Senator Stanford Drawn by Dr. Jordan In His Talks on Ideals of University 
### 
A spirit of respect and quiet hom
age pervaded the University audience
which gathered in the Assembly Hall
this morning to participate in the
Founders' Day public exercises. A
subdued impression of .rejoicing welled
up from the hearts of all those who
heard the inspiring remarks of Chan
cellor Jordan as lie brought into play
all his power of intellect and devotion
in drawing an intimate picture of the
remarkable man who conceived this
University.
The program opened with a selec
tion by the Band —Der Geist des Wo
jewoden, by G.rossman. A beautiful
bank of early spring blossoms and
greenery lent enchantment to the
stage setting—primroses, glorious
poinsettias, cyclamens, palms, ferns,
and begonias all bent their heads to
the strains of the music so beautifully
played.
The Seniors slowly filed into the
hall to the Tannhauser of Richard
Wagner—the women imposingly cap
ped and gowned, followed by the men
of the class, marching with measured
step to their places at the front of the
hall. The procession was followed by
Chancellor Jordan and President
Branner, in their robes of office.
Nevin's Suite, Un G.iorno in Venezia,
was interpreted by the Band in all of
its four parts. Alba, C'anzoni, Gondo
lieri, and Buona Notte. With the suc
cessful rendition of such a piece, the
Band showed decided improvement in
a very difficult field of music. The
musicians toned thei.r instruments
down to a delightful pitch, producing
a very impressive effect.
A good round of applause greeted
Dr. .Jordan as he mounted the rostrum,
lie delivered the address of the day,
"The Foundation Ideals of Stanford
University." with the sincerity bred
of intimate connection with the per
sons and objects which he discussed.
The plan of his speech emphasized the
practical construction and sane equip
ment of Senator Stanford's mind.
Past ages did not awe the Senator by
their pomp and tradition; he realized
the great efficiency of an evolving ed
ucative center, not one brought to a
state of decline by so-called perfec
tion.
After the conclusion of the address,
the audience rose and sang "Hail.
Stanford, Hail." Stabat Mater, Losey's
composition, served as the Seniors'
Recessional. The four-year men and
women proceeded to the Mausoleum,
and there the Flower Committee, com
posed of Miss Betty Taff and G. A.
Jacomini, placed bouquets at the
Tom!) of the Founders in grateful rec
ognition of their memory. The exer
cises were ended with "Hail, Stanford,
Hail," sung at the Mausoleum by the
members of the Senior class.

Hail," sung at the Mausoleum by the
members of the Senior class.
A spirit of respect and quiet hom
age pervaded the University audience
which gathered in the Assembly Hall
this morning to participate in the
Founders' Day public exercises. A
subdued impression of .rejoicing welled
up from the hearts of all those who
heard the inspiring remarks of Chan
cellor Jordan as lie brought into play
all his power of intellect and devotion
in drawing an intimate picture of the
remarkable man who conceived this
University.
The program opened with a selec
tion by the Band —Der Geist des Wo
jewoden, by G.rossman. A beautiful
bank of early spring blossoms and
greenery lent enchantment to the
stage setting—primroses, glorious
poinsettias, cyclamens, palms, ferns,
and begonias all bent their heads to
the strains of the music so beautifully
played.
The Seniors slowly filed into the
hall to the Tannhauser of Richard
Wagner—the women imposingly cap
ped and gowned, followed by the men
of the class, marching with measured
step to their places at the front of the
hall. The procession was followed by
Chancellor Jordan and President
Branner, in their robes of office.
Nevin's Suite, Un G.iorno in Venezia,
was interpreted by the Band in all of
its four parts. Alba, C'anzoni, Gondo
lieri, and Buona Notte. With the suc
cessful rendition of such a piece, the
Band showed decided improvement in
a very difficult field of music. The
musicians toned thei.r instruments
down to a delightful pitch, producing
a very impressive effect.
A good round of applause greeted
Dr. .Jordan as he mounted the rostrum,
lie delivered the address of the day,
"The Foundation Ideals of Stanford
University." with the sincerity bred
of intimate connection with the per
sons and objects which he discussed.
The plan of his speech emphasized the
practical construction and sane equip
ment of Senator Stanford's mind.
Past ages did not awe the Senator by
their pomp and tradition; he realized
the great efficiency of an evolving ed
ucative center, not one brought to a
state of decline by so-called perfec
tion.
After the conclusion of the address,
the audience rose and sang "Hail.
Stanford, Hail." Stabat Mater, Losey's
composition, served as the Seniors'
Recessional. The four-year men and
women proceeded to the Mausoleum,
and there the Flower Committee, com
posed of Miss Betty Taff and G. A.
Jacomini, placed bouquets at the
Tom!) of the Founders in grateful rec
ognition of their memory. The exer
cises were ended with "Hail, Stanford,
Hail," sung at the Mausoleum by the
members of the Senior class.
