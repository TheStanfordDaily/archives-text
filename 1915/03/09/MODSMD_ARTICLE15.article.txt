# EIGHTEEN IS HUMBLED IN ANNUAL BASEBALL FRACAS
## 
### 
The laurels of victory went un
shared in the annual clash between the
two underclasses yesterday afternoon,
the Sophomores capturing both the
baseball game and the coveted horse
hide. The score was 2-0.
The majority of excitement in the
baseball game centered In the opening
inning. After the Freshman batters
had gone out in hopeless fashion, Lan
der, first up, drew blood by register
ing a hit. Dickey and Stevens
t'l ed out to left and center fields, re
spectively. A triple by Austin allowed
Lander to tally with the necessary
run. Bihlman brought Austin across
the plate and cinched the contest by
following with another long triple to
right field. Goose eggs we,re in or
der for the remainder of the game.
When, by agreement of both teams,
the contest was called at the end of
the fifth inning, the center of inter
est turned toward the football field.
Since f.fty-five of the Freshmen were
tied hand and foot under the care of
a few Sophomores in Encina Hall,
there was a notable lack of first-year
men present to participate in the fight
fo.r possession of the baseball. None
of the 1918 team were molested.
Upon lining up 011 opposite sides of
the twenty-five-yard lines. Captain
Workman threw the sphere high in
the air toward the Freshmen. The ball
was quickly retrieved by the seventeen
ers, and thrown into the bleachers,
where it was tossed into a waiting ma
chine, which drove off immediately.
The official ball was given to Captain
Workman shortly afte.r dinner.
