# DR. JORDAN DISCOURSES UPON THE UNIVERSITY IDEALS OF STANFORD IN TRIBUTE TO THE FOUNDERS
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan delivered the annual
Founders' Day address in the Assem
bly Hall this morning upon the sub
ject of "The Foundation Ideals of Stan
ford University."
From an historical as well as a per
sonal viewpoint it is eminently fit
ting that Dr. Jordan should discourse
upon this theme, which will farm a
companion piece to the Chancellor's
"The Story of a Good Woman." The
latter also first appeared as a Found
ers' Day address, and was a eulogy
of the life of Mrs. Jane Lathrop Stan
ford, and a narrative of the history
of the University during the so-called
"dark days" between 1893 and 1899,
when the ultimate fate of the institu
tion was in constant doubt.
In treating his subject this morning
Dr. Jordan gave expression to the
ideals which inspired Senator Leland
Stanford in his conception of Stanford
University. Selecting the successful
system then in practice at Cornell
University as the most suitable for the
needs of Stanford, the Senator called
upon Andrew D. White, who was
mainly responsible for the efficiency
of Cornell, where he was then acting
president, to assume the duties of
chief executive at Stanford. In declin
ing White .recommended David Stan-
Jordan, then president of the Universi
ty of Indiana, for the position.
When the present Chancellor name
to Stanford he was the youngest uni
versity president, in po'nt of years, in
the country, and when he resigned he
was the oldest in point of service, a
fact of no little significance.
The important share which Dr.
David Starr Jordan had in forming, di
recting. and developing the "founda
tion 'deals" of Stanford University
need no comment.
The address of Dr. Jordan follows:
I)r. Jordan Introduces Speech.
When Charles Darwin felt himself
growing old, he sat down in his home
in Kent to write the story of his life —
fo.r his children. He wrote, he said, as
might a spirit from another world,
looking down on this one. not swayed
by any emotion, of hope, of fear, or
eagerness or uncertainty as to the
final end. And so, today, T wish in
some such disembodied fashion to tell
the story of the founding of a univer
sity, and of the purposes and ideas
with which it started out.

Twenty-four years is a short time
in the history of a nation or a univer
sity, which is a small and swiftly
changing nation within itself. It is a
long time in the life of a man, as those
who with me have spanned it can tes
tify.
The story of today will not go far
beyond the first day of October, 1891,
when we gathered in the northwest
gate of the quadrangle for the open
ing day.
Founder and President.
Purpose must come before action,
and in the very beginning there were
only two to frame this purpose, the
founder and the president. Leland
Stanford was then scarcely older than
I am now, and I was a mere "youth
of promise," from the simple-minded
east, a "new man," as the San Francis
co journals kindly put it, and Mr.
Stanford had a reputation wider than
the nation, a philosopher and a lover
of li s kind as well as a business man
and a statesman.
A ('auspicious Figure.
Leland Stanford had been for a gen
eration the most conspicious figure in
California. He was a .rich man, weal
thy through his own effort, and he
hoped to leave humanity better for his
riches. Especially he wished to bring
to the California he loved, and who, af
ter California's fash-on, ha.l f'nst, loved
him, the abundance of life, which is
the best gift of the University. Leland
Stanford had held many relations with
California. He was an actual pion
eer. When the Civil War broke out he
had no doubt of his position and he
stood for free speech in Sacramento,
when freedom was dangerous. He was
the war governor of the state, trusted
by Lincoln, and like Lincoln, he knew
how to count the cost in a difficult
crisis. He had been one of the four
men of Sacramento who saw the vision
of a railway over the Sierras. In 1891
he was United States Senator from
California, known to every one and be
loved by all who came near him.
Typically American.
His wide influence did not rise from
his wealth. Wealth and influence
sprang alike from his personality. He
was broad-minded and long-headed,
and his simplicity of life kept him al
ways in touch with the people. "He
was active," it was said, "when other

men were idle; he was generous when
other men were grasping; he was lof
ty when other men were base." He
was thoroughly a man, and a man of
the type we like to call American.
One word of praise of Stanford
clings to my memory. At his funeral
in 1893, Horatio Stebbins in his state
ly fashion told how the Greeks did
honor to a slain hero. Then turning
to the pallbearers, stalwart men from
the Southern Pacific, he said: "Gentle
up your strength a little, for 'tis a man
ye bear."
University Idealized.
The story of the death of the only
son is known to Stanford people. The
boy, young Leland, fell ill in Rome
from the mosquito-borne Roman fever.
After coming back to Florence while
convalescent, he died of failure of the
heart. After the long vigil of a dreary
night, Mr. Stanford awoke one morn
ing with these words on his lips: "The
children of California shall be my chil
dren." And this thought grew crystal
line as the dream of a great universi
ty. And in this plan, nis wife, Jane La
throp Stanford, gave him most loyal
service, which continued unshaken
throughout twelve years of lonely wid
owhood. The story of her love and de
votion I have told as well as I could on
another occasion, the parallel to this.
< aliforiiia tlie .Motif.
So the decision was made that the
beloved Palo Alto farm —famed for the
finest horses in the world —should be
come a university campus. The Uni
versity buildings should have a motif
from California. To this end the old
mission of San Juan Capistrano, near
the seashore above San Diego, founded
by Father Junlpero Serra more than a
century before, was chosen to give the
University its form. Appeal was made
to the greatest living architects, Henry
Hobson Richardson, of Boston, for
the best was none too good for the new
University. Richardson died before
any work was begun, but his partners,
Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, took up
the plans in all essential respects just
as we see them now in stone. Freder
ick Law Olmsted devised the garden
effects, but his plans are as yet car
ried out only in part. The streets were
laid out, and at Mr. Stanford's request.
