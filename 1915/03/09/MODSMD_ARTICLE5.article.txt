# DINNER, DANCE AND MUSIC WILL CLOSE ANNUAL HOLIDAY
## 
### 
This evening at six o'clock a num
ber of jovial'epicureans will assemble
around the board at the Women's Club
House, and conclude the Founders'
Day celebration with an informal din
ner and dance. The entire University
community is invited to participate in
the affair, and the menu arranged by
the capable committees in charge
reads in a delicious manner.
Cream chicken, mashed potatoes,
green peas, olives, pickles, fruit, salad,
rolls, maple parfait, home-made layer
cake, and the ever-present small black
are all distributed over the bill of fare
in a most tasteful manner. A wonder
land of tit-bitsâ€”who will not be there?
Dr. John Maxson Stillman Vice-Pres
ident of Stanford University, has been
secured to act as toastmaster, and a
very informal program of speeches by
well-known campus people will add
spice to the various courses. Dr. St'll
man's ready wit will undoubtedly be
one of the main features of the even
ing.
The University quartet, composed of

Dunlap, Walker, M ller, and Bennett,
has offered to enliven the affair with
a well-selected repe.rtoire of popular
song-hits. T' eir presence on the pro
gram places it within one more notch
of being the most successful program
ever conducted in conjunction with a
University banquet.
After the festivities in the Club
House, the banqueters will bridge the
gap to The Stanford Union, where the
University Hand will furnish music
for an informal dance. The program
will last until twelve o'clock, and the
liveliest one-steps and fox-trots will
be interpreted by the musicians.
The sole aim of the committee is to
make the evening pleasant,and it urges
strict informality as the only way to
make every one enjoy himself. Miss
Elizabeth Wright. 'OS, has cared for
most of the details of the dinner, and
has been assisted by Miss Sophia
Cramer. '04 Mrs. E. W. Horine, '02,
Mrs. Allen, Dean of Women, Mrs. W.
IT. Schoekley, '02, and Mrs. A. C.
