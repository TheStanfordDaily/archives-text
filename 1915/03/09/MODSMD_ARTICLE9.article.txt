# THE 						MOVING SPIRIT

### 
Today we take a retrospective view
and see the actuating motive of the
Founders in establishing the Univer
sity. That motive is clearly revealed
in an address delivered to the Board
of Trustees by Mrs. Stanford on Oc
tober 3, 1902. The address, although
coming from the lips of the "Good
Woman," is also a reflection of the
underlying spirit of Senator Stanford.
An excerpt from the address follows:
"The moving spirit of the Founders
in the foundation and endowment of
Leland Stanford Junior University
was love of humanity and a desire to
render the greatest possible service to
mankind. The University was accord
ingly designed for the betterment of
mankind, morally, spiritually, intel
lectually, physically, and materially.
The public at large, and not alone the
comparatively few students who can
attend the University, are the chief
and ultimate beneficiaries of the
foundation. While the instruction of
fered must be such as will qualify the
students for personal success and di
rect usefulness in life, they should un
derstand that it is offered in the hope
and trust that they will become there
by of greater service to the public.
"As stated in the letter to the Trus
tees, accompanying the Founding
Grant, 'The object is not alone to give
the student a technical education, fit
ting him for a successful business life,
but it is also to instill into his mind an
appreciation of the blessings of this
government, a reverence for its insti
tutions, and a love of God and hu
manity, to the end that he may go
forth and by precept and example
spread the great truths by the light of
which his fellow men will he elevated
and taught how to obtain happiness
in this world, and in the life eternal.'"
