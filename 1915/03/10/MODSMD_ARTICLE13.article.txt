# HOLIDAY DINNER IN WOMEN'S CLUB HOUSE PRONOUNCED SUCCESS
## Chancellor Jordan, Professor Huston, Tommy Gregory and Miss Bailey Speak at Annual Founders' Day Celebration INFORMAL DANCE FOLLOWS 
### 
Members of the Faculty, alumni and
students gathered in the great up
stairs hall of the Women's Club House
last evening, three hundred strong,
and under the formidable title of the
Founders' Day Banquet, sat down to
the most enjoyable and informal little
meal held on the Stanford campus for
many a day. Already the spirit of the
Founders of the Club House and The
l T n':on is being felt as a democratic
influence and social leveler, and the
enthusiasm with which the first real
get-together of Faculty people and stu
dents, past and present, was received
on this occasion, indicates that the two
club houses will in the future be the
means of bringing all these diverse ele
ments into absolute harmony.
Entering the building last evening,
one came suddenly upon a lively scene
of merriment and laughter. Sprays of
Acacia and graceful pine boughs re
lieved the grayness of the walls, and
in the far corner fair members of Cap
and Gown were dispensing trays and
steaming delicacies to the long line
of diners. Cream chicken, fruit salad,
maple ice cream, home-made layer
cake, and the Inevitable small black,
with appropriate side dishes, made up
a very palatable bill-of-fare. The ban
queters gathered in groups of ten
about small tables, which were distrib
uted over the hall, and a number of
active members of the Freshman class
were present to attend to the wants of
every one present.
The informal program started with
4.v0 numbers by the Glee Club, "Shoogy
Shoo" and "Song of the C.nomes." After
the musical selections, Vice-President
Stillman arose from his toastmaster's
chair, and pronounced the opening
sent'ment that "it is evident that
Founders' Day is to become the one
particular Stanford festival day." Af
ter proposing a telepathic toast to
President Branner, who had been
called from the banquet by urgent
business, Dr. Stillman declared
that as Stanford places its pride in
the 50ft as a thins of beauty and joy
forever-, he would first call on Miss
Margery Bailey, '14, to represent this
necessary element of University life.
Miss Bailey, in an extremely comical
talk, which kept the audience con
vulsed with laughter, explained tersely
and well how much better are the wo
men of Stanford than the men. She
finally proved her point, to the satis
faction of the 500, at least, by stating
that it was a woman that first raised
a blush of embarrassment on the seri
ous countenance of Assistant Regis
trar McDowell. —a feat, by the way,
which is well worth noting.
Professor C. A. Huston, of the Daw
department, introduced as a fair rep
resentative of the "New Guard," at
tempted to characterize the Faculty—
saying that what the Faculty really is,
Clod alone knows, that what it thinks
of itself is expressed by remarking
that each member is conscious of the
other's imperfections, but that the stu
dent view is chancing to one of trust
and confidence in the men of the Fac
ulty as friends and counsellors. Pro
lessor Huston paid a tribute to the
"Old Guard," and emphasized friend
ship as the chief attribute of the Stan
ford Faculty.
Tommy G.regory, '99, spoke for the
alumni, and recognized in the comple
tion of the two new buildings, the op
portunity created for bringing the four
sides of the Quadrangle to a better un
derstanding of each other. The pro
gram was concluded with a short talk
by Chancellor David Starr Jordan, who
spoke on the major professor system,
and introduced numbers of interesting
reminiscences.
After the speeches were concluded,
I the meeting was moved over to The
! Stanford Union, where the Stanford
I Hand held forth with a choice selec
tion of dance music. Credit for pro
ducing such a successful affair belongs
to the following: Miss Elizabeth
Wright, 'OS, J. E. McDowell, '00, P. P.
Clover, '14, and the members of Cap
and CfOwn, Skull and Snakes, the two
Governing Boards, the Glee Club, the
Band, and numerous others who helped

trar McDowell. —a feat, by the way,
which is well worth noting.
Professor C. A. Huston, of the Daw
department, introduced as a fair rep
resentative of the "New Guard," at
tempted to characterize the Faculty—
saying that what the Faculty really is,
Clod alone knows, that what it thinks
of itself is expressed by remarking
that each member is conscious of the
other's imperfections, but that the stu
dent view is chancing to one of trust
and confidence in the men of the Fac
ulty as friends and counsellors. Pro
lessor Huston paid a tribute to the
"Old Guard," and emphasized friend
ship as the chief attribute of the Stan
ford Faculty.
Tommy G.regory, '99, spoke for the
alumni, and recognized in the comple
tion of the two new buildings, the op
portunity created for bringing the four
sides of the Quadrangle to a better un
derstanding of each other. The pro
gram was concluded with a short talk
by Chancellor David Starr Jordan, who
spoke on the major professor system,
and introduced numbers of interesting
reminiscences.
After the speeches were concluded,
I the meeting was moved over to The
! Stanford Union, where the Stanford
I Hand held forth with a choice selec
tion of dance music. Credit for pro
ducing such a successful affair belongs
to the following: Miss Elizabeth
Wright, 'OS, J. E. McDowell, '00, P. P.
Clover, '14, and the members of Cap
and CfOwn, Skull and Snakes, the two
Governing Boards, the Glee Club, the
Band, and numerous others who helped
to make the evening go smoothly.
Members of the Faculty, alumni and
students gathered in the great up
stairs hall of the Women's Club House
last evening, three hundred strong,
and under the formidable title of the
Founders' Day Banquet, sat down to
the most enjoyable and informal little
meal held on the Stanford campus for
many a day. Already the spirit of the
Founders of the Club House and The
l T n':on is being felt as a democratic
influence and social leveler, and the
enthusiasm with which the first real
get-together of Faculty people and stu
dents, past and present, was received
on this occasion, indicates that the two
club houses will in the future be the
means of bringing all these diverse ele
ments into absolute harmony.
Entering the building last evening,
one came suddenly upon a lively scene
of merriment and laughter. Sprays of
Acacia and graceful pine boughs re
lieved the grayness of the walls, and
in the far corner fair members of Cap
and Gown were dispensing trays and
steaming delicacies to the long line
of diners. Cream chicken, fruit salad,
maple ice cream, home-made layer
cake, and the Inevitable small black,
with appropriate side dishes, made up
a very palatable bill-of-fare. The ban
queters gathered in groups of ten
about small tables, which were distrib
uted over the hall, and a number of
active members of the Freshman class
were present to attend to the wants of
every one present.
The informal program started with
4.v0 numbers by the Glee Club, "Shoogy
Shoo" and "Song of the C.nomes." After
the musical selections, Vice-President
Stillman arose from his toastmaster's
chair, and pronounced the opening
sent'ment that "it is evident that
Founders' Day is to become the one
particular Stanford festival day." Af
ter proposing a telepathic toast to
President Branner, who had been
called from the banquet by urgent
business, Dr. Stillman declared
that as Stanford places its pride in
the 50ft as a thins of beauty and joy
forever-, he would first call on Miss
Margery Bailey, '14, to represent this
necessary element of University life.
Miss Bailey, in an extremely comical
talk, which kept the audience con
vulsed with laughter, explained tersely
and well how much better are the wo
men of Stanford than the men. She
finally proved her point, to the satis
faction of the 500, at least, by stating
that it was a woman that first raised
a blush of embarrassment on the seri
ous countenance of Assistant Regis
trar McDowell. —a feat, by the way,
which is well worth noting.
