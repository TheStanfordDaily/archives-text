Another milestone has been record
ed in the annals of Stanford Universi
ty. And, as Dr. Stillman expressed
himself last night, "Founders' Day
has become a unique and character
istic celebration for this institution.
All universities must necessarily have
their commencement days, which are
more or less alike, but Stanford alone
has her Founders' Day."
The university of today is essentially
the university of tomorrow. It is de
pendent on certain underlying princi
ples and ideals. Yesterday we heard
from the lips of Dr. Jordan of the
ideals which are the foundation of
Stanford University. However, the
university of today cannot and does
not stand still. Certain changes must
necessarily take place in the Faculty
from year to year. Generation after
generation of the undergraduates come
and go. There is an ever-revolving
cycle.
The progress of this University de
pends upon you and those who come
after you. It is the university of the
future to which we should turn our
eyes. "Our hopes lie in our imperfec
tions."
These hopes, yes even dreams, can
not yet he seen. Their realization is
dependent upon the future. Dr. Jor
dan has carefully pictured the pros
pective Stanford in his address on
"The Story of a Good Woman:"
"Rome was not built in a day, nor
Stanford in a century. Hut as the old
pioneers returning now behold in solid
stone the dream-castles of their col
lege days, so shall you, Stanford men
and women, find here, as you come
hack to future reunions, the university
of your dreams, the university of great
libraries and noble teachers, the uni
versity of the perfect democracy of
literature and science, of self-devotion
and self-restraint, the university in
which earnest men and women find the
best possible preparation for work in
life, the university which sends out
men who will make the future of the
republ c worthy of the glories of the
past, the university of the plans and
hopes of Iceland Stanford, the univer
sity of the faith and work and prayer
of Jane Lathrop Stanford."
