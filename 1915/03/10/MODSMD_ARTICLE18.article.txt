# GEOLOGY AND MINING

Scries No. 1.
In order to intelligently discuss ge
ology or mining engineering as a vo
cation, it is first necessary to assume
the existence of a normal state of af
fairs in the world. A condition where
the civilized countries are developing,
rather than destroying their resources.
111 such a time private individuals and
corporations are eage.r for an outlet
for their surplus capital through the
development of new industries, and
are seeking the guidance of technical
ly trained men in making their invest
ments. To quote from a commence
ment address by Mr. James R. Finlay,
at the Missouri School of Mines, in
19112: "There is an immense field for
the further development of industry
throughout the world * * * The posi
tion of mining with reference to the
development of civilization and of in
dustry lias been steadily growing, and
must continue to grow."
The work which geologists and min
ing engineers are called upon to do
covers a wide field, and requires a
broad rather than a special training.
It is significant that when Dr. Wlll. P.
Blake started at New Haven in 1859
one of the first technical journals of
its kind in America, he gave it the title
"The Mining Magazine and Journal of
Geology, Mineralogy, Metallurgy, Chem
istry, and the Arts, in Their Applica
tion to Mining and Working Useful
Ores and Metals." This wide field
claimed by Blake is now attempted by
many other publications, and is actu
ally covered by the transactions of the
American Institute of Mining Engin
eers. Mr. Hennen Jennings, a widely
known engineer, in an article on Min
ing as a profession, stated: "The min
ing engineer must have some sound
general knowledge of all other branch
es of engineering, inasmuch as in the
equipment and running of great mines
and metallurgical plants he must make
use of the training of engineers in al
most all the other branches, and to
obta'n from them their best and to
hold their respect, it is necessary for
him to, at least, appreciate the foun
dation ol' their specialties. * * * In ad
dition he must have special knowl
edge and training in all pertaining to
the discovery, working, and valuation
of ore deposits. He must have sound
business experience and judgment
* * * and a successful experience in
management, requiring a knowledge of
accounts and faculty of handling men."
In addition to this training and experi
ence, a geologist or mining engineer

must have what has been called the
color of energy.
These professions essentially involve
pioneer work. The logical develop
ment of any country should be, first a
study of ts natural resources, part of
which work, the study of mineral re
sources, naturally falls to the geolo
gist. Then should come the develop
ment and extraction of the minerals
with the aid of the mining engineer.
Finally the building and operation of
railroads, mills, and factories under
the direction of civil and mechanical
engineers. As a matter of fact, this
rational order is not always followed
in a country's history, but anyone who
doubts that the work of a geologist or
mining engineer is pioneering, need
only look over the records to discover
ample proof of this statement.
Mr. T. A. Rickard, speaking at the
fiftieth anniversary of the founding of
the Columbia School of Mines, said in
part: "The story of mineral explora
tion and racial migration is peculiarly
the heritage of our people, and the
Anglo-Celts. It is the motif that rnns
through the drama of English and
American history, more particularly
during the last hundred years. * * *
The first social organizations around
the shores of the Mediterranean sent
their prospectors to the hinterlands of
Europe, Asia, and Africa. The gold of
Ophir, the copper of Sinai, the silver of
Lau.rium were part of the web and
wcof of those early civilizations. The
mines of Tberia gave Hannibal the
sinews of war against Rome, and the
gold of Dacia strengthened the re
sources of Rome under Trajan. But
the greatest adventure was that of the
Phoenicians who passed through the
Pillars of Hercules into the western
ocean in order to reach the far Cas
siterides * * Here M,r. Rickard
spoke as a true Englishman, but he
went on to picture the rapid develop
ment of California, as duo in large
measure to the discovery of gold, and
Australia, South Africa, and Alaska all
owe their exploration and occupation
to the same incentive.
The work of the pathfinder and trail
breaker is not as rosy as it is often
pictured: the geologist is often as
much of a drudge as a clerk, and the
engineer's tasks as dreary and as con
fining. Thoir work is often in such
remote regions that it "leaves 110 last
ing monument to stimulate either admi
ration or criticism." Initiative to start,
and perseverance to finish what is
started, with a little tact to smooth the
ways, are greater requisites to success
than brilliancy of intellect.

In addition to this training and experi

must have what has been called the
color of energy.
These professions essentially involve
pioneer work. The logical develop
ment of any country should be, first a
study of ts natural resources, part of
which work, the study of mineral re
sources, naturally falls to the geolo
gist. Then should come the develop
ment and extraction of the minerals
with the aid of the mining engineer.
Finally the building and operation of
railroads, mills, and factories under
the direction of civil and mechanical
engineers. As a matter of fact, this
rational order is not always followed
in a country's history, but anyone who
doubts that the work of a geologist or
mining engineer is pioneering, need
only look over the records to discover
ample proof of this statement.
Mr. T. A. Rickard, speaking at the
fiftieth anniversary of the founding of
the Columbia School of Mines, said in
part: "The story of mineral explora
tion and racial migration is peculiarly
the heritage of our people, and the
Anglo-Celts. It is the motif that rnns
through the drama of English and
American history, more particularly
during the last hundred years. * * *
The first social organizations around
the shores of the Mediterranean sent
their prospectors to the hinterlands of
Europe, Asia, and Africa. The gold of
Ophir, the copper of Sinai, the silver of
Lau.rium were part of the web and
wcof of those early civilizations. The
mines of Tberia gave Hannibal the
sinews of war against Rome, and the
gold of Dacia strengthened the re
sources of Rome under Trajan. But
the greatest adventure was that of the
Phoenicians who passed through the
Pillars of Hercules into the western
ocean in order to reach the far Cas
siterides * * Here M,r. Rickard
spoke as a true Englishman, but he
went on to picture the rapid develop
ment of California, as duo in large
measure to the discovery of gold, and
Australia, South Africa, and Alaska all
owe their exploration and occupation
to the same incentive.
The work of the pathfinder and trail
breaker is not as rosy as it is often
pictured: the geologist is often as
much of a drudge as a clerk, and the
engineer's tasks as dreary and as con
fining. Thoir work is often in such
remote regions that it "leaves 110 last
ing monument to stimulate either admi
ration or criticism." Initiative to start,
and perseverance to finish what is
started, with a little tact to smooth the
ways, are greater requisites to success
than brilliancy of intellect.

In order to intelligently discuss ge

the existence of a normal state of af
fairs in the world. A condition where
the civilized countries are developing,
rather than destroying their resources.
111 such a time private individuals and
corporations are eage.r for an outlet
for their surplus capital through the
development of new industries, and
are seeking the guidance of technical

at the Missouri School of Mines, in
19112: "There is an immense field for
the further development of industry
throughout the world * * * The posi
tion of mining with reference to the
development of civilization and of in
dustry lias been steadily growing, and

The work which geologists and min

covers a wide field, and requires a

It is significant that when Dr. Wlll. P.
Blake started at New Haven in 1859
one of the first technical journals of
its kind in America, he gave it the title
"The Mining Magazine and Journal of
Geology, Mineralogy, Metallurgy, Chem

American Institute of Mining Engin

known engineer, in an article on Min

general knowledge of all other branch

equipment and running of great mines
and metallurgical plants he must make

the greatest adventure was that of the
Phoenicians who passed through the
Pillars of Hercules into the western
ocean in order to reach the far Cas
siterides * * Here M,r. Rickard
spoke as a true Englishman, but he
went on to picture the rapid develop
ment of California, as duo in large
measure to the discovery of gold, and
Australia, South Africa, and Alaska all
owe their exploration and occupation
to the same incentive.
The work of the pathfinder and trail
breaker is not as rosy as it is often
pictured: the geologist is often as
much of a drudge as a clerk, and the
engineer's tasks as dreary and as con
fining. Thoir work is often in such
remote regions that it "leaves 110 last

ration or criticism." Initiative to start,
and perseverance to finish what is
started, with a little tact to smooth the
ways, are greater requisites to success
than brilliancy of intellect.
