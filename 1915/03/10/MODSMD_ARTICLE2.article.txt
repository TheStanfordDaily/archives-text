# SENIORS OPPOSE JUNIORS IN BALL GAME TOMORROW
## Winner of Upperclass Contest Will Compete With Sophomore Nine for Interclass Championship. 
### 
Tomorrow the varsity diamond will
be the scene of the second intercolle
giate baseball conflict of the year,
when the Junior and Senior teams will
play at 4:15. The game will determine
the team that will meet the Sophomore
nine in the final contest to decide the
1915 interelass championship. Each
of the upperclass teams has four regu
lar varsity men in its line-up, but the
class of 1915 appears to have the most
effective battery and the heaviest slug
gers. In addition, the fourth-yea''
nine will be strengthened by Ray
Maple, who will handle all chances in
the vicinity of shortstop.
Pete McCloskey has been chosen to
captain the Senior team, while Bill
Noonan will lead the Juniors.
