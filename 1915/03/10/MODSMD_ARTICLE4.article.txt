# OLD HERMIT IS FAR FROM WELL, THOUGH SUPPLIED WITH FOOD
## Domingo Grasso is Discovered As Sufferer from Dropsy at Retreat in the Hills, Where Friends Have Sent Supplies PERSONALITY IS UNCHANGED 
### 
The rumor that Domingo Grasso, the
old hermit who lives in a hut in the
hills, was at the point of death from
starvation, was investigated by The
Daily Palo Alto this afternoon. The
old man was found far from well, but
able to get around. He seemed well
supplied with food, but it was evident
that the supply of provisions had been
obtained but the day before, and the
hermit said they were "presents."
However, he denied having been short
of food, but admitted that he had been
feeling badly for a month.
It seems that yesterday he was very
ill. He complains of a bad cough at
present, and declared that he was suf
fering from dropsy. His condition con
firmed his statement. That he has
been far from well was evidenced by
his personal appearance and that of
his shabby abode, which is usually
kept neat and clean.
His old pride in his appearance had
rot deserted him, and he was firm in
his refusal to pose for a photograph,
declaring that he did not look nice
enough. Nor was he too ill to live up
to his reputation as a hospitable
host.
Reports have come from San Mateo
that the county will hereafter take
care of the old man of the hUls, and
supply him with food. Today the
hermit gave 1809 as the date of his ar
rival in America from Genoa and 1875
as the date of his discovery of gold on
the Mac Donough estate in the Por
tola foothills. It is said he was
brought to this country to care for a
vineyard owned by the former San
Francisco banker.
