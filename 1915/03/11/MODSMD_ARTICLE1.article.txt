### 
Leases for The Union barber shop
and haberdashery have been signed,
and Charlie Meyer and Wideman &
Son will open new places of business
in the new clubhouse. There were
a number of bids for both of the con
cessions, and these men are the suc
cessful competitors.
The haberdashery will be located in
the first room on the right of the
Lasuen street entrance. In addition to
a general line of haberdashery, Wide
man will have the agency for Ed. V.
Price clothes. Whether or not the Palo
Alto tailoring business will be carried
on in the new store has not been de
cided. The Palo Alto store will be re
tained. and conducted along with the
campus branch.
The campus store will be conducted
by D. B. Carroll, '16, and Otto Wide
man, who will also take some courses
in the University. The Palo Alto store
will remain under the management of
the senior membe.r of the Wideman &
Son firm. Measurements for the fur
nishings of the new store are being
made this afternoon. It is the inten
tion to have a stock of goods on hand
and open the business before Junior
Week, if possible.
The barber shop will be located on
the same floor as the haberdashery,
on the north s'de of the building, next
to the car tracks. There is an entrance
to this room from both the interior
and exterior of the building.
Meyer will install two barber chairs
in the new shop, and it will be thor
oughly up-to-date. In all probability
it will not be possible to open for busi
ness before next fall, though the work
of putting the shop 'n shape will be
started immediately. The room and
furnishings will be finished in white
enamel, and the work of enameling
will take several weeks in itself.
The old barber shop in the Encina
basement will still be conducted as
before with two tonsorial artists on
hand to dispense shaves and hair cuts.
The leases have been approved by
the Hoard of Trustees of the Universi
ty. The work necessary before the
new lessees can move in will be start
ed at once.
A handsome Ludwig player piano
has been purchased for The Union, and
will be installed in the main room by
the end of the week. Hesides the piano
a number of mahogany card tables and
the paraphernalia for numerous
games, including checkers, chess, pok
er. cribbage. and dominoes, has also
been secured.
