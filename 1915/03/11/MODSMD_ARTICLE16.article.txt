# BEWARE!

### 
Spring is here; agents of one kind
or another are or soon will be here;
vacation is not far distant. Such a
combination makes it apropos at this
season to drop a word of warning to
the unsuspecting, overzealous student
who is desirous of working during the
summer, and of securing at least a
fair remuneration for his labors.
Competition between various com
panies, carrying the same or similar
lines of goods, for the services of col
lege men during the summer to sell
their goods will be very keen on the
campus during the next two months.
Attractive schemes are offered to in
duce men to sell certain goods with
prospects of a large remuneration for
ten or twelve weeks work. The pros
pects are usually painted in glowing
terms, and often entice a man into a
proposition that proves a failure when
tried out in the specific territory al
loted to him.
A majority of the Stanford students
are desirous of finding employment
during the summer vacation in order
that they may pave the way for their
expenses next year. Agents of the va
rious companies are cognizant of this
fact in this University, as well as in
other institutions. The agents secure
oft times a certain percentage of the
profits derived from the sales of the
men whom they sign up. It is to their
advantage personally, as well as to the
advantage of the company which they
represant, to secure as many energetic
workers as possible. The result is
that they approach the unsuspecting
student, picture tliu possibilities and
tell him the success of a few salesmen
last year, but fail to say anything
about the ones who lost rather than
made any money. The student pic
tures all salesmen in the light of the
successful few, and signs a contract
to sell the goods, but listen to his tale
of woe next semester if you believed
that he would make a success of the
proposition. The agent, himself, is
probably absolutely sincere that the
student will make a success of the
undertaking. A few do, but a large
majorityâ€”well, that is another story. I
Students should consider all sides !

of a proposit'on before they contract
to soil certain specific articles. Not
only should they consider the selling
qualities of the products, but also the
business ethics which must be followed
to secure sales.
Beware of the wily, glib-tongued,
and oft times unassuming agent, who
presents to you a money-making prop
osition for the summer months. Do
not be overcome by the eloquence of
lr,s confiding attitude.
