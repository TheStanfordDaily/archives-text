# OVER ONE-TENTH OF STANFORD STUDENTS WORK FOR EDUCATION
## Y.M.C.A. Employment Bureau Furnishes Great Variety of Positions for University Men, 
### 
If it is the truth that the things
one works lor are greatly appreciated,
at least oue-tenth oÂ£ the men at Stan
ford should enjoy the opportunity they
nave of securing an education in this
institution. Reports from the Y. M. C.
A. Employment Bureau show that over
one hundred and twenty Stanford men
have either partially or wholly worked
their way through the University dur
ing the past year. One hundred and
ninety-seven positions have been filled
by the bureau alone, under the man
agement of E. H. Lockwood, and, aside
from this, there are many who do not
secure their jobs through the V. M. C.
A. Approximately one hundred and
ten of these positions have been per
manent.
It would seem from the character of
these jobs, that our student body is not
made up of over-fastidious men, for
the various positions filled have been
frequently not only unusual, but ec
centric. One man was employed to
take an o.ld gentleman out for a breath
of fresh air once a day. Another was
put to work read.ng stories to an old
lady. The position of scare-crow was
accepted by still another. His duty
\. as to frighten bad boys and birds
av\ay from choice cherry trees which
belonged to an estate in Menlo Park.
Shaving seems to have been a favorite
occupation from time immemorial; one
of Stanford's most successful gradu
ates, now a prominent architect in San
Francisco, worked h.s way through
collage in this way. H. C. Hoover,
'95, now a member of the Board of
Trustees, helped himself by sweeping
out the basement of the Chemistry
building.
Other jobs, such as exercising the
horses, dusting furniture and clerking
in department stores, have been filled.
Not the least unusual was a flying
trip to San Francisco to get a gown
lor the wife of a professor n time for
her to attend a .reception.
One man proved the exception to the
eld miner's adage, "Easy come, easy
go,' by gambling away the money
which he earned by "hashing" in the
day time and working in an engine
house at night. He left college, but
the average worker stays to graduate.
The Y. M. C. A. bureau lias been re
ceiving applications for work from
students all over the country, indicat
ng that there will be a large influx
to the coast next year. Mr. Lockwcod
has arlvised these people to come on, if
they have capital to get started, but
otherwise not.
The field of employment is limited
here, because of our distance from a
large city. It is rumored, however,
that a new branch of work is soon to
be opened. The Exactus Film Com
pany, of Palo Alto, is planning to use
student acto.rs for the production of
some of their "movie" plays.
However, it is readily realized that
Stanford is not a rich man's institu
tion, and there is considerable oppor
tunity for one to make his way, in part,
at least.
