# UNDERCLASSES MEET IN DEBATE TONIGHT
## Question Is Identical With That for Tri-State Contest to Be Held Next Week. 
### 
The debaters of the Sophomore and
Freshman classes meet in the chapel
this evening. As usual the question,
"Resolved, that the federal govern
ment should own and operate all in
ters) ate railroads acting as common
carriers, including intrastate lines
competing with them," is identical
with the Tri-state subject, to be debat
ed next week. This affords the j n
state teams an opportunity to hear
thsi.v question discussed from different
angles, enabling them better to meet
any arguments brought up by their
opponents from Oregon and Washing
ton.
The Sophomore team, W. C. Ans
pach, H. A. Frye, and G. W. Feni
more, will take the affirmative, while
the Freshmen, N. R. Allen, J. A. Quin
by, and M. L. McClintock, will uphold
the negative side of the argument. The
victory in this contest has gone to the
freshmen for the past three years.
Members of the winning team a.re pre
sented with debating emblems by their
class.
Judge S. W. Charles, of Palo Alto;
Assistant Professor D. F. Grass, and
Instructor F. B. Garver, both of the
Economics department, have been
chosen to decide the question. A. F.
Coyle, chairman of the Intercollegi
ate Debating Team, will preside.
The debate will begin at eight
o'clock, and all who are interested in
government ownership of public utili
ties, or who a.re students of the sub
ject of transportation will find it of
particular interest. All are invited to
attend.
