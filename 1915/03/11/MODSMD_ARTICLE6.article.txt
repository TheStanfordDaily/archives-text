Lovers of music will be afforded an
opportunity to enjoy an evening of
rare delight on Friday, March 19, when
the Zollner quartet—father, daughter,
and two sons—appear at the Stanford
Assembly Hall, under the auspices of
the Faculty Committee on Public En
tertainment.
The success of the quartet is an ex
emplification of constant association
and training. The Zollners are solo
ists of th? highest order, having
studied separately and together under
such masters as Cesar Thompson,
Wienawski, and Jacques Gillard. Their
repertoire includes quartets, trios,
sonatas, original work for two vio
lins and a piano, violincello and piano
solos, and other unusual contributions
upon their instruments.
From infancy the children and the
father have played together, which
makes their ensemble work remark
able. r l he cellist of the party is an ex
ceptionally talented artist, and has ap
peared as a solo'st in Brussels, Ant
werp, Berlin, and Vienna. Their Euro
pean appearances have been notewor
thy. They have played before royalty
in many instances, and on two occa
sions by command of the prosent king
of Belgium. Fn Amoric- they have
been most enthusiastically received by
many loading clubs and musical or
ganizations. Their Stanford appear
ance will lie made in connection with
their third tour of the Pacific coast.
The sale of seats will commence
Saturday, Ma,rch 13, at the Stanford
Hrokstore and Weingartner's drug
store, in Palo Alto.
