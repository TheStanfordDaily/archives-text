# BOXING FINALS WILL BE STAGED ON MONDAY
## MEDALS OFFERED WINNERS IN FOUR DIVISIONS. Large Entry List and Continuous Performance Plan Guarantees Exciting Go. 
### 
Moth the preliminary bouts and the
final events in the University boxing
championships will be staged next
Monday evening in Encina gymnasium,
instead of dividing the try-out and the
final contests into two evenings, as
was previously planned. This change
was deemed necessary by Trainer H.
W. Maloney, who believes that the
tournament should be run off in the
least possible time.
Medals will go to the winners in the
light, welter, middle and heavy
weight d : visions, the weights being
divided so as to bring all contestants
below 139 pounds into the light weight
class; all below 119 into the welter
weight; those tipping the scales be
low 159 into the middle section, and
all others into the ring as heavy
weights.
The method employed so success
fully last year in the managing of the
champ'onship fights will be used
ii'jain next Monday, in the prelimin
ary events each man will box three
two-minute .rounds, with a two-minute
rest in between. With pairs of con
testants on the go simultaneously,
spectators will be afforded what i?
practically a "continuous perform
ance," each pair alternating in the
ring for a two-minute round. The
f'nals will be decided by four two
minute rounds. J. D. Flint, '15, L. R.
Reynolds, '15, and Dr. H. R. Stolz have
been named as judges. W. H. Ma
loney will referee.
Men well known in Stanford boxing
circles have signified thei.r intentions
of going out for the coveted medals. G.
P. Ross, '14, winner of last year's
lightweight event, will be seen in ac
tion on Monday. R. M. Good. '15, A.
