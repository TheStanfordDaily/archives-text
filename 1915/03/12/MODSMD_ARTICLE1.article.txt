# ENTIRE UNIVERSITY WILL JOLLY-UP THIS EVENING
## Unusual Stunts to Enliven Intermissions ONLY DANCES ON CAMPUS Upperclassmen Will Gather in Encinaâ€”Sophomores and Freshmen to Fraternize at Armory 
### 
Tonight an innovation will be sprung
in Stanford social circles, when the
entire student body, men and women
and holdovers, are to throng to the
upper and underclass jolly-ups to be
staged at Encina Hall club room am
the Armory. Xo other function is tc
be held on the campus this evening
thereby giving everyone an opportuni
ty to attend.
The Junior-Senior informal displays
all indications of giving those present
a rousing good time during every min
ute of the four hours of gaiety. The
music is undoubtedly the best ever se
cured at any class jolly-up. A three
piece orchestra from San Francisco
consisting of "That Accordion Player,'
a rag-time pianist, and a drummer
promises to rende.r the latest difficuh
dances a simple matter to perform.
Several stunts have been arrangec
for by the committee in charge. The
moonlight quartette, which entertains
the sorority houses along the Row dur
ing the evenings, will sing some o1
their best numbers. Those who wil
vocalize are J. W. Bennett. '15, C. M
Miller, '14, S. C. Walke.r, '15, and W. E
Dunlap, '15. P. O. Solon, '14, in con
junction with two players on guitars
will render several selections. Dance;
of all descriptions, with the exception
of the ladies' favor dance, are on the
program, Including robber, and
straight numbers, and fox trots.
Mystery shrouds the "eats" provided
fo.r the upperclass informal. The
punch, which is to be served in a
larged-sized barrel, is an entire novel
ty to the campus. No more definite
announcement than this has been made
by the committee concerning the re
freshments.
Any one who is found attired in any
other than rough-neck dress at either
upperclass or underclass function will
be excluded from the floor. Soft slr.rts
and informality will be the order of
the day.
The Freshman-Sophomore jolly-up
is already an assured success. Con
trary to their upperclass cohorts,
there is no mystery surrounding their
plans o.r entertainment. The refresh
ments stand out as a particular source
of attraction. Scores of doughnuts,
numerous boxes of apples of all varie
ties and forty gallons of root beer
are on the menu.
A campus orchestra of three pieces
has been secured. W. G. Paul, '15, is
to play the piano, B. M. Melvin. '17, is
to pound the drums, and G. E. Crary,
'17, will aid with the banjo.
The Coleman brothers, who have
won reputations for their excellence
on the guitars, will render some Ha
waiian airs. B, M. Melvin, '17. will
sing a few witty songs and verses in
conjunction with W. G. Paul, '15. Doc
Lillie, vice-president of the Sophomore
class, has offered his service as master
of ceremonies.
The upperclass informal will com
mence promptly at 8 o'clock, while the
i underclassmen will begin festivities a
