# INTER VARSITY GOLF POSTPONED
## 
### 
The intercollegiate golf match
scheduled for March 20, has been
postponed until April 3, and the try
outs which were to have taken place at
the Ingleside links tomorrow have
been called off temporarily. The
change of date was necessitated by the
fact that neither the California team
nor that of Stanford have had suffi
cient practice to insure a creditable
contest as early as a week from tomor
row. The winter rains raised havoc
with the links on which tlie candidates
for the team had planned to practice,
but the nearby courses are now un
dergoing repairs, and will be avail
able by the last of the week.
Wednesday is the last day that
golfers can sign up for the try-out
tournament.
