A .representative of Haskins & Sells,
; San Francisco accountants, was on the
campus yesterday and investigated the
system of accounting which has been
devised for The Union, the Executive
Committee, and other campus organi
zations.
The purpose of the examination was
to determine the feasibility of the
system, and it was found to be entirely
practicable. The accountant spent the
entire afternoon going over the books
of the Graduate Manager.
