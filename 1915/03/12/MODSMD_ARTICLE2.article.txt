# MARKET ON THE CIRCLE WILL BE GAILY ATTIRED
## Stanford Band Will Play in Morningâ€”Venders Are to Be in European Costumes. 
### 
The Western European Market will
start at eight o'clock tomorrow morn
ing on the Palo Alto Circle, the pro
ceeds of which will go to the Belgian
Relief committee. The selling will
continue all day. The booths and
buildings about the Circle will be dec
orated in Old World style, while the
vendors arc to appear in costumes in
harmony with the occasion. Various
amusements will be provided to keep
things enlivened. In the morning, be
tween ten and twelve o'clock, the Stan
ford Hand will play.
All who can buy at the market, es
pecially house-managers, are urged to
do so. The gravity of the situation in
Melgium is appreciated by but few. It
is not generally understood in this
country that for stretches of days at a
time, many people in Bplgium are
forced to go absolutely without food.
The prices in the booths will be 110
higher than the usual market values.
A supper of Italian ravioli, bought of
Miss Ruth Macon, '17, who will have
charge of a booth for its sale, will
add to the proceeds of the relief un
dertaking.
Mrs. Percy Davidson, of Woodside,
and a number of friends have under
way plans that will make the eggs,
butter and cheese table one of the
most fascinating on the Circle.
The booth for the animal pets will be
in charge of Mrs. de Lancy Lewis, ex
'ft?. She complains that she could feed
several Melgians on the food required
for the menagerie, which includes sev
eral talking parrots, white mice, gold
fish, puppies, kittens, a baby goat and
thirty pigeons.
