# Roman Building Enigmas Equal Modern Problems
## J.D. Galloway Lectures on Great Achievements of Early Latin Engineers. 
### 
J. D. Galloway, of San Francisco,
addressed an aggregation of engineer
ing students for the second time yes
terday afternoon on the "History of
Bridge Construction." The lecture,
held in room 283 of the Engineering
building, was illustrated by stereopti
con views, many of which were taken
by the speaker.
"Bridge work, as we know it, began
with the Romans," said Mr. Galloway
in the opening of Irs talk. This state
ment was followed by a short synop
sis of Roman history, which explained
how the Romans, by establishing uni
versal peace throughout their empire,
made possible the feats of construc
tion performed in all parts of their
domain. In England the old Roman
walls still stand as testimony of the
ability of Roman engineers. Spain
and France are also dotted with
bridges and buildings erected by the
conquerers.
According to Mr. Galloway, many
of the Roman buildings and aquaducts,
still intact after two thousand years
of service, involved mathematical prob
lems in their construction which would
"stump" many modern engineers. Ce
ment making was thoroughly under
stood by the Lat:n engineer. He man
ufactured it from lime and volcanic
sand which, when mixed, produced a
hard, water-proof substance that has,
even to the present day, withstood the
elements. The statement that the Ro
mans did not know that water, con
fined in a closed pipe, would seek its
level is now declared to be untrue.
There are many proofs that this law
was known to them, but they were
unable to employ it because it was
then impossible to manufacture a pipe
that would stand pressure of water.
Mr. Galloway concluded his talk by
stating that if lis were able to leave
behind him a piece of work as splen
did as many of the Roman structures
he would be satisfied with his career
as an engineer. The next talk on
"The History of Bridge Construction"
will be Thursday, March IS.
