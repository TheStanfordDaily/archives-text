# Junior Prom Plans Are Attractively Arranged
## Committee Shows Originality in Choice of Music, Refreshments, and Decorations. 
### 
P. R. Wilson, '16, chairman of the
Junior Prom Committee, announces
that the dance to lie held March 26
will greatly eclipse attempts of former
years. Great originality has been
shown in the selection of rapid-fire
music, palatable refreshments, and at
tractive decorations, and with many
programs for the formal already in
circulation about the campus, it seems
very reasonable to predict that the af
fair will be pronounced an unqualified
success.
The far-famed Cliff lb.use Orchestra,
known to all lovers of dance muse par
excellence as the premier exponents
of that syncopated, active harmony—
the one-step—will be on hand in the
corner of the clubroom with a fascin
ating repertoire of the latest song-hits.
The orchestra is composed of five
pieces, piano, accordion, banjo, drum,
and slide trombone—think it over.
The refreshments will consist of a
plentiful array of salad, sandwiches,
ice cream, wafers (cakes), and the
cozy little small black. The commit
tee has invited Zampato Lorenzo, the
expert, at present engaged in con
struction on the mosaics of the Me
morial Church, to plan the decorative
scheme to he employed for the dance.
fThe Encina Club room offers very good
opportunity for display of originality
in decorative plans, and a very clever
style may be expected by those who
attend the Junior Prom.
