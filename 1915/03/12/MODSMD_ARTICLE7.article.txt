# 1917 DEBATING TRIO WIN OVER RIVALS
## Freshmen Are Out-Argued in Close Contest Over Question of Federal Ownership of Railroads. 
### 
The Sophomore debaters wrested the
laurels of victory from the Freshman
team in the Interclass contest which
was held in the chapel last evening,
securing the unanimous decision of the
judges. Notwithstanding this fact,
however, the debate was closely con
tested, and the two teams evenly
matched.
The Sophomore, W. C. Anspach, H. A.
Frye, and G. W. Fenimore, had the af
firmative side of the question, "Re
solved, that the federal government
should own and operate all interstate
railroads acting as common carriers,
including interstate lines competing
with them." They based their whole
argument on the point that govern
ment ownership would secure more
adequate and cheap transportation.
They also maintained that, in borrow
ing money for expansion, the govern
ment could secure lower rates of in
terest and better terms. In answer to
the objection that the administrative
difficulties would be too great to en
able success to be attained, they said
that a non-partisan management would
remove all trouble.
Upon the negative, M. L. McClintock,
N. R. Allen, and J. A. Quinby, dwelt on
the impossibility for the government
to secure enough money to acquire the
.railroads. Aside from the actual prop
erty and capital involved, the vested
interests of the great corporations in
crease the value of the roads to an
enormous degree. Also it was said
that government ownership would be
inexpedient on account of the undue
influence in politics which the rail
roads would acquire.
McClintock made the best speech of
the debate for the freshmen, delivering
his arguments in clear and convinc
ing style. The Sophomore team was
well balanced, and presented its side
of the case in such a manner as to
leave no doubt in the judges' minds.
Judge S. W. Charles, of Palo Alto;
Assistant Professor D. F. Grass, and
Instructor F. R. Garver, both of the
Economics department, rendered the
decision.
