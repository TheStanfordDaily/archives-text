schedule tomorrow, the Varsity being
slated to oppose St. Ignatius in the af
ternoon, while in the morning the sec
ond team will cross bats with the Palo
Alto Alumni Club nine.
St. Ignatius' invasion will mark its
second appearance of the season. A
week ago Thursday the same aggrega
tion dropped a close 3 to 1 game to the
Varsity. Doc Hayes, who held them
down to four scattered hits, will at
tempt to break the losing streak suf
fered by the team dur'ng the last few
days at the hands of the White Sox
and Chinese Athletic Club. Dent is to
resume his position behind the plate.
The infield will see one change from
the opening line-up used in the past
few contests. Instead of Dickey at
second, Masters, lately drafted from
the Peanut. League, will be given an
other opportunity to display his wares.
Captain Wo.rkman will cover first,
Stevens short, and McCloskey third.
Day is booked to fill the left field po
sition, while Austin will occupy the
center garden. Right field is to be in
trusted to either Noonan, Downing, or
O'Neill. The game will be called at
three-fifteen. Wabbles Stafford will
return to college the early part, of next
week. In time to take part in the final
interelass game set for Tuesday.
