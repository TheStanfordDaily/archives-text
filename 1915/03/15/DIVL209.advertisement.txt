World •famous Scotch Comedian,
*'Tuxedo for mildness, purity and
fragrance, THE tobacco for me.
With my pipe filled with good old
TUXEDO, all my troubles go up in
smoke. In all my world-wide trav
els I've yet to find its equal as a
slow-burning, cool-tasting, sweet
flavored tobacco. TUXEDO satis
fies me completely."
I
Tuxedo Keeps the
World in Good Humor
Here is the man whose life work is to make millions of
people happy. In pursuing his call, he travels the wide world
over. He is a great lover of his pipe, and in all sorts of
corners of the earth he has tried all sorts of tobaccos.
What is his unqualified statement in regard to Tuxedo?
Read it again : "I've yet to find its equal.'' 1 his is the frank
and candid opinion of thousands and thousands of experi
enced, judicious smokers. I uxedo is absolutely the best
all-around, tobacco that modern tobacco science can make.
The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
Uncorking a tin of Tuxedo is like lifting the lid on con
centrated sunshine. And then, when you fire up ! Weill The
first puff's a revelation, the second's a revolution, the third
just gets you happy-like ! Then you're off —just as sure as
you'll see the green grass and hear the birds sing next Spring.
The exclusive "Tuxedo Process" brings out the unsur
passed mildness, delicate fragrance and mellow flavor of the
Burley leaf in a way that has never been successfully imitated.
At the same time it refines the tobacco until every trace of
harshness and "bite" disappears.
