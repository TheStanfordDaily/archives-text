# HEAVY STICK WORK BY STANFORD SLUGGERS DEFEATS ST. IGNATIUS
## McCloskey and Austin Fatten Averages at Expense of Visiting Twirlers HAYES PITCHES FINE BALL 
### 
The Varsity donnecl its batting
clothes Saturday afternoon, and so by
timely and consistent hitting, com
bined with el'fective pitching on the
part of Doc Hayes, humbled St. Igna
tius with the short end of a 7 to 2
score.
Twelve healthy bingles to all cor
nel's of the lot were garnered off the
delivery of Morrissey and Van der Zee.
McCloskey led the league by annexing
three safeties in as many times at bat,
one of these being a triple. Austin
managed to connect three times in five
trips to the plate, while Downing and
Hayes each pounded out a brace of
hits.
Hayes experienced only one had in
ning, the fourth. In this frame he al
lowed a walk, a sacrifice, two singles,
and a double, netting St. Ignatius their
total of two runs. Two hits were all
they could annex in the other eight
rounds. Eleven of the visitors struck
out.
Stanford stowed the game away in
the ice-chest in the second inning. Af
ter Dent managed to get hit by Moris
sey, Downing promptly singled through
second. McCloskey followed instruc
tions by laying down a neat sacrifice.
Hayes then snapped the pellet on the
seam for two bases, registering Dent
and Downing. A minute later Hayes
was thrown out at the plate on Mas
ters' bunt to Morrissey. Stevens sin
gled to center and took second when
the fielder miscued. Masters reached
third. Austin lined a bingle to left,
bringing in Masters and Stevens.
In the third frame, McCloskey's long
triple, plus Hayes' swat to right
chalked another score in the run col
umn. Dent tallied in the fifth on his
own walk, an out, and McCloskey's
hit to left. Workman made the last
run in the lucky seventh. After doub
ling down the right field foul line,
singles by Downing and McCloskey al
lowed the skipper to tap the plate. At
the end of the game, the fans went
home contented that the Varsity was
over its slump evinced earlier in the
week.
The second team defeated the Palo
Alto Alumni nine 8 to 3 in the morn
ing game.

The Varsity donnecl its batting
clothes Saturday afternoon, and so by
timely and consistent hitting, com
bined with el'fective pitching on the
part of Doc Hayes, humbled St. Igna
tius with the short end of a 7 to 2
score.
Twelve healthy bingles to all cor
nel's of the lot were garnered off the
delivery of Morrissey and Van der Zee.
McCloskey led the league by annexing
three safeties in as many times at bat,
one of these being a triple. Austin
managed to connect three times in five
trips to the plate, while Downing and
Hayes each pounded out a brace of
hits.
Hayes experienced only one had in
ning, the fourth. In this frame he al
lowed a walk, a sacrifice, two singles,
and a double, netting St. Ignatius their
total of two runs. Two hits were all
they could annex in the other eight
rounds. Eleven of the visitors struck
out.
Stanford stowed the game away in
the ice-chest in the second inning. Af
ter Dent managed to get hit by Moris
sey, Downing promptly singled through
second. McCloskey followed instruc
tions by laying down a neat sacrifice.
Hayes then snapped the pellet on the
seam for two bases, registering Dent
and Downing. A minute later Hayes
was thrown out at the plate on Mas
ters' bunt to Morrissey. Stevens sin
gled to center and took second when
the fielder miscued. Masters reached
third. Austin lined a bingle to left,
bringing in Masters and Stevens.
In the third frame, McCloskey's long
triple, plus Hayes' swat to right
chalked another score in the run col
umn. Dent tallied in the fifth on his
own walk, an out, and McCloskey's
hit to left. Workman made the last
run in the lucky seventh. After doub
ling down the right field foul line,
singles by Downing and McCloskey al
lowed the skipper to tap the plate. At
the end of the game, the fans went
home contented that the Varsity was
over its slump evinced earlier in the
week.
The second team defeated the Palo
Alto Alumni nine 8 to 3 in the morn
ing game.
