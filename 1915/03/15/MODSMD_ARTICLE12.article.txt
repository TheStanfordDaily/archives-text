# BEST TRACK MEET OF SEASON RESULTS IN MANY GOOD MARKS
## Murray Ties Coast Record in Low Sticks—Caughey Puts Shot 45 Feet 6 Inches KIRKSEY TAKES FAST DASH 
### 
The track meet held Saturday after
noon on the Stanford oval was char
acterized by several very good per
formances, and the appearance of
many of the veterans of last year's
intercollegiate contest.
Fog Murray startled the bleachers
with a fast :15.2 in the high sticks,
and came back later in the day with
a record of :24.3 in the low hurdles,
tying his own Pacific Coast record for
the distance.
Kirksey, the speedy Freshman from
Palo Alto, burned up the track in the
century event for : 10.1, outdistancing
Grant in the last 20 yards, and creat
ing the sensation of the day by his fast
ea.rly-season performance.
The two members of the Australian
team, Ric Templeton and Reg Caughey,
registered good marks in their favor
ite events. Templeton came close to
topping the bar at six feet in the high
jump, and the stocky Freshman prac
tically threw the shot away with a
heave of 45 feet, 6 inches.
Two very good distance men are be
ing developed in Chapman and A.
Wilson, who romped away with the
two-mile runs. Captain Bonnett ap
peared in togs for the first time this
season, and paced off a fast half in
2:02.
The Winged "O" will compete with
the Varsity next Saturday in the first
regular meet of the season held with
an outside aggregation. Captain Hor
ine is bringing a crack lot of record
holders down for the event, who are
counted on to give the team a good
fight for first place honors.
