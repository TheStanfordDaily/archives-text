and came back later in the day with
a record of :24.3 in the low hurdles,
tying his own Pacific Coast record for
the distance.
Kirksey, the speedy Freshman from
Palo Alto, burned up the track in the
century event for : 10.1, outdistancing
Grant in the last 20 yards, and creat

ea.rly-season performance.
The two members of the Australian

ite events. Templeton came close to
topping the bar at six feet in the high
jump, and the stocky Freshman prac
tically threw the shot away with a
heave of 45 feet, 6 inches.
Two very good distance men are be
ing developed in Chapman and A.
Wilson, who romped away with the
two-mile runs. Captain Bonnett ap
peared in togs for the first time this

2:02.

formances, and the appearance of
many of the veterans of last year's
intercollegiate contest.

with a fast :15.2 in the high sticks,
and came back later in the day with
a record of :24.3 in the low hurdles,
tying his own Pacific Coast record for
the distance.
Kirksey, the speedy Freshman from
Palo Alto, burned up the track in the
century event for : 10.1, outdistancing
Grant in the last 20 yards, and creat
ing the sensation of the day by his fast
ea.rly-season performance.
The two members of the Australian
team, Ric Templeton and Reg Caughey,

ite events. Templeton came close to
topping the bar at six feet in the high

holders down for the event, who are
counted on to give the team a good
fight for first place honors.
