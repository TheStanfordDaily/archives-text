There was a decided lack of that
old-time spirit of courtesy eminating
from the Stanford bleachers during
the baseball game on Saturday, and in
its place the innovation of the so-called
prep school tactics (for want of a bet
ter term). This consists of jeering and
hooting at the players of the opposing
team and disputing the decisions of
the umpire from the bleachers. Ev
erybody knows the reputation that
other institutions are laboring under
as a result of the derision cast by their
loyal supporters at visiting teams. Are
we going to set an example for others
to follow, and lead the procession for
cleaner sportsmanship, or are we go
ing to trample our ideals under foot
and adopt the tactics employed by the
bleacher enthusiasts at professional
baseball games? Courtesy to our op
ponents should be the first consider
ation in setting a standard. If certain
individuals are prone to conform to
such a standard, then they should be
requested to leave the field. Courtesy
never costs a man anything, but lack
of courtesy often puts him into disre
pute.
