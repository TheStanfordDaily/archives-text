# INTERESTING ART EXHIBIT IS PLACED IN OLD STUDIO
## Impressionistic Work of Mrs. Stark's Is Received With Enthusiasm on Campus. 
### 
A number of paintings, one hundred
and fifty in all, by Mrs. C. L. Starks,
of the Art department, are now on ex
hibition in the Old Studio. These pic
tures, executed in oil and water col
or, show a keen, concentrated ten
dency toward brilliant and stimulat
ing detail in color, as well as in line.
Besides presenting the eloquent liv
ing force in such inanimate subjects,
Mrs. Starks has succeeded admirably
in her delicate handling of light
scenes. Two of her large paintings,
both among her European studies, the
"Ballet Clirls, Paris," and the "Nude
Study," illustrate this ability. In"The
Ballet Girls" the light is painted with
a dexterity that makes it all but vi
brate with life.
Probably the best and most worth
while of all Mrs. Stark's work is the
large canvas, "My Mother." This pic
ture stands out from among the oth
ers, a simple representation of moth
erhood, which makes it appeal to all.
"My Mother" is a study in soft whites,
lavenders, and greysâ€”a portrait im
bued with the faint fragrance of lav
ender and the delicacy of old lace.
