# BEACHEY IS KILLED BY FALL OF PLANE
## Meets Death in Waters of Bay After Drop of Twenty-Five Hundred Feet. 
### 
Lincoln Beachey, foremost expo
nent of aviation in America, and Stan
ford's champion in the last Big Game,
fell to his death in San Francisco bay
yesterday, a victim of his own daring,
and a new monoplane. The bird-like
German taube failed to bear the
strain imposed upon it by Beachey in
his spectacular loop-the-loop in the
air. The wings crumpled up, first
one and then the other, and the air
man with the "charmed life" failed to
make another of his miraculous es
capes.
Beachey was an ardent admirer of
Stanford, and his memorable flight
over California Field the day of the
Big Game won a place for him in the
hearts of the Stanford rooters. Just
before the game commenced Beachey,
with the underplanes of a baby Cur
t'ss machine painted cardinal, and
each emblazoned with a block "S,"
flew over the Berkeley campus. Far
above the Campanile the birdman
twisted and somersaulted, finally vol
planing in a single swoop to the Cal
ifornia bleachers, where he dropped a
crimson football. Beachey received no
pay for his exhibition, but in recogni
tion, he was granted a sweater with
the letters"L. S. J. U." by the Execu
tive Committee of Stanford.
This, morning everywhere on the
campus one met with the expression,
"Isn't it too bad about Beachey." Stu
dents are subscribing to a fund to pur
chase a floral piece for the funeral.
Beachey will be remembered long by
the public for his spectacular flying,
but he goes down in Stanford history
as the first, and perhaps the only man,
to be awarded an "L. S. J. U." sweater.
