# Amateur Robber Rifles a Room in Chi Omega House
## Thief Enters by Fire Escape—Fails to Discriminate in Value of Articles Taken. 
### 
A great deal of comment has been
caused by the visit of an unknown
burglar, who Saturday evening entered
the Chi Omega house by means of the
fire escape, recently installed at the
rear of the building. His taste —grant-
ing the burglar to be a man—seems to
have tended toward the feminine and,
judging by the large amount of foot
gear found to be missing after the in
vasion, not unlike that of the centi
pede. It is hard to determine whether
the house was entered by a real thief
or an enthusiastic Belgian relief work
er.
The occupant of the one room which
was entered left about six-thirty in the
evening for a short walk. Upon return
ing at eight she found muddy tracks
on the window seat beside the window
opening on the fire escape. A hurried
inventory of the articles about the
room was immediately taken, which
revealed the loss of four pairs of
shoes, four pairs of kid gloves, a ring
set with four diamonds, a small purse
containing twenty cents, an initialed
hand mirror, and a book.
The marauder seemed more intent
upon obtaining a variety of articles
than securing those of the greatest
value. Perhaps it was his first experi
ence, and an eye for clever estimation
had not been developed, for, while he
pilfered a small purse containing only
a few cents, he overlooked one lying
next to it in which there was a consid
erable sum. Similarly, in his haste to
make away with kid gloves he did not
t ike pieces of jewelry near them which
greatly exceeded the gloves in value.
The climax was reached when it was
found that he had also taken .a book.
Every circumstance seemed to favor
the robber. The short space between
the fire escape and the ground was
easily bridged by a small step-ladder,
leaning against the house.
