# EXPOSITION RECOGNIZES UNIVERSITY WITH STANFORD DAY SATURDAY
## PLANS CHANGED; DATE SAME Campus Events Prevent Entire Community Attendance, But Large Delegation Is Expected 
### 
Plans are being rapidly matured for
entertainment of Stanford students,
alumni, faculty, and friends at the
Panama-Pacific Exposition next Sat
urday, Stanford Day. An effort was
made by the committee in charge of
the Stanford Day program to change
the date to some later day, owing to
the track meet, baseball game, and
social events scheduled for Saturday,
but investigation of all available dates
proved that none were better than
this week-end; consequently, Stanford
Day will be March 20.
However, the nature of the program
will be changed considerably. No at
tempt will lie made to have the Stan
ford community attend the Exposition
in a body, though as many as pos
sible of its members are urged to be
present at the exercises to be held 011
the grounds. These exercises will be
brief, and will be practically the only
program to feature the University on
Stanford Day. Stanford students, how
ever, will be given special attention
by Exposition attendants.
The principal change in the nature
of the Stanford Day celebration will be
that ; t will serve more as a recognition
by the Exposition of Stanford, rather
than a gala day of festivities for Stan
ford people. However, it is expected
that several hundred Cardinal pleas
ure-seekers will be at the fair on Sat
urday, and this band will be strength
ened by alumni of the vicinity, who
are being collected by a special com
mittee.
In addition to being Stanford Day,
Saturday will be featured with the
presence of the California Legislature,
athletic events, evening illuminations,
and concerts.
