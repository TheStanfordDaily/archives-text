one dollar will prevail.
Several features mark this year's
comic opera. First, Nineteen Sixteen's
offering will savor distinctly of the
professional. Secondly, "At the
Dragon's Eye" is a dancing show—the
chorus numbers are real chorus num
bers and will bear resemblance to the
professional stage. Thirdly, the fre
quent touches of humor are not the re
sult of puns and local jokes, but are
brought about through the introduc
tion of farcical situations and predica
ments.
An exceptionally small cast, there
being but 36 persons in the opera,—
assures perfection in the difficult
dancing numbers which the members
of "At the Dragon's Eye" are called

charge declare the production .ready
for the stage tomorrow. The first act
has already been through the finishing
process, and will not be touched

Although labeled as a dancing show,
the score of the opera contains music
al numbers of the highest calibre. W.
(1. Paul. '15. will take the calcium in a
light and airy song from bis own pen,
"Moonlight on the Cotton Fields."
When Paul sallies forth hidden behind
burnt cork and rosy lip paint, leading
a chorus of small blacks, it will lie the
cue for the audience to fall into rhap
sodies of laughter. Paul's "Campus
Moon" brings the only touch of Stan
ford into the opera. All former lunar,
effects will be totally eclipsed in this
song.
W. P. Detel's catchy waltz, "Mission
ary Maid," will star Miss Esther I,iver
sidge, '17. and W. C. Bacon. '14, in a
contralto and baritone duet. Miss Liv

W. P. Detel's catchy waltz, "Mission
ary Maid," will star Miss Esther I,iver
sidge, '17. and W. C. Bacon. '14, in a
contralto and baritone duet. Miss Liv
ersidge will be given opportunity in
"At the Dragon's Eye" to excel her
former successes.
Several changes have been made in
the cast by the 1916 committee. J. 11.
Wiggins, '10. will play the part of
Ozaki. a high priest of Budda, in place
of P. E. Keast. '16, who has resigned
from the opera cast to take the lead
of "Sherwood." 11. B. Fisher. '17. and
the Misses Laura Anderson, '18, and
Jean Campbell, '18, have been added to
the choruses of "At the Dragon's
Eye."
The one production of the opera will
be given on Thursday evening, March
2F».
The f'.rst opportunity to secure seats
for the 1916 Junior Opera, "At the
Dragon's Eye," will be given Stanford
and l J alo Alto people tomorrow after
noon. Tickets will be put on sale af
ter the customary drawing for places
in line, which will take place at 1:10
at the campus Bookstore, and at Wein
gartner's, in Palo Alto. The usual
scale of prices, r»0 cents, 75 cents, and
one dollar will prevail.
Several features mark this year's
comic opera. First, Nineteen Sixteen's
offering will savor distinctly of the
professional. Secondly, "At the
Dragon's Eye" is a dancing show—the
chorus numbers are real chorus num
bers and will bear resemblance to the
professional stage. Thirdly, the fre
quent touches of humor are not the re
sult of puns and local jokes, but are
brought about through the introduc
tion of farcical situations and predica
ments.
An exceptionally small cast, there
being but 36 persons in the opera,—
assures perfection in the difficult
dancing numbers which the members
of "At the Dragon's Eye" are called
upon to execute. The committee in
charge declare the production .ready
for the stage tomorrow. The first act
has already been through the finishing
process, and will not be touched
again until the initial dress rehearsal
next Monday evening.
Although labeled as a dancing show,
the score of the opera contains music
al numbers of the highest calibre. W.
(1. Paul. '15. will take the calcium in a
light and airy song from bis own pen,
"Moonlight on the Cotton Fields."
When Paul sallies forth hidden behind
burnt cork and rosy lip paint, leading
a chorus of small blacks, it will lie the
cue for the audience to fall into rhap
sodies of laughter. Paul's "Campus
Moon" brings the only touch of Stan
ford into the opera. All former lunar,
effects will be totally eclipsed in this
song.
