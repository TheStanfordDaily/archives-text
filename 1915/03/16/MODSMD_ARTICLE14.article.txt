# LACK OF FORESIGHT
## 
### 
A conflict of dates between organi
zations usually causes either only par
tial success or absolute failure of one
or both events scheduled for the same
time. Two events have been slated
for Friday evening, namely the Zoell
ne.r Concert, which will be held in the
Assembly Hall, under the auspices of
the Faculty Entertainment Commit
tees, and the intercollegiate Tri-State
debate between Oregon and Stanford,
which must necessarily be held in the
chapel.
It seems that the concert was ar
ranged for March 19 on September 24,
1914, and signed up in the date book
for that time. The Tri-State debate
was originally scheduled for March 12,
but at the request of Oregon was
changed by mutual consent of the
Stanford debaters to March 19, on
February 23. The debaters did not
take into consideration the fact that
another event of university import
ance had been scheduled for the same
evening. Practically the same people
who attend the concert would be like
ly to attend the intercollegiate de
bate, if it was held on another even
ing.
Debating as an intercollegiate ac
tivity has gradually fallen into an ob
solete corner in this institution. It
has been skating on a ragged edge for
a long time. The question has arisen
whether or not it will lie there cov
ered with dust and finally pass out of
existence, or whether it will be resur
rected and take its place among the
important intercollegiate events of the
year. There is a place for debating
in every University calendar. It. should
hold its own in competing for the ser
vices of members of the student body.
We earnestly hope that debating may
arise from its grave and come to life
again, but this will not be possible un
til the committee in charge of debat
ing uses more foresight in selecting
dates for forensic contests.
