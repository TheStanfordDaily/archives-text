# ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY

### Professor Vernon L. Kellogg 
Series No. 2.
Entomology used to mean mostly in
sect-collecting; now it means mostly
insect-fighting: the entomologist, who
was formerly popularly known as
"bug-hunter' is now known as "hug
killer." The discovery and realiza
tion that the farm, forest, and barn
yard products of this country suffer
an annual loss of a billion dollars
through insect attack, and that a doz
en or more of the most serious dis
eases that scourge mankind are spread
by insects, and three or four of them
are exclusively so spread, have
changed the popular attitude toward
the student of insects. The study is
recognized to be no longer merely the
idle pastime of harmless cranks, but
the serious business of trained scien
tific men. And the fruit and grain and
cotton growers, the forest conserva
tors, the stockmen and the physicians
all unite in calling loudly 011 the eco
nomic entomologist for help.
This help is being offered by a few
of the older general naturalists who
gave themselves, from special interest,
particularly to the study of insect life,
but is offered in larger measure by a
much greater number of young men—
men who have devoted themselves al
most exclusively to the specialized
study and practice of economic ento
mology, which is a study combining a
special attention to insect structure,
life-history and general habits, with
an attention to the details of crop and
forest and animal and human relations
to insect predators and parasites.
As rather more than two-thirds of
all the half-nrllion known kinds of
animals are insects, and as a discour
agingly large numbe.r of these 350,000
different insect kinds are "bad bugs,"
it is plain that the student takes on a
man's-size job when he sots out on the
career of professional economic ento
mologist. Hut that is one of the good
things about it. It is exciting work.

much of it is new work, and it offers
an inviting field for ingenuity, initia
tive and investigation. Every econom
ic entomologist, is, under present pion
eer conditions, an independent inves
tigator of animal and plant life. He
is doing continuous graduate study in
field and laboratory on a salary!
Fiut the salary, although always
enough from the start for one to live
on. and, as experience and recognition
comes, increasing to be enough for
two and three or even four o,r five, to
live on, never gets to be much more
than that. There are no such money
rewards in the work as those possible
to the unsual engineer or lawyer or
physician. But; on the other hand, I
have not heard of any economic ento
mologist starving.
The reason for this latter cheering
fact is that, up to the present, there
has been a demand for more young
men trained for the work than the
few universities and agricultural col
lege special departments of entomolo
gy have been able to turn out. The
demand comes from the government
bureau, from state departments, and
experiment stations, from county offi
cers, and sanitation organizations, and
is beginning even to come from pri
vate and corporation growers' associa
tion sources. A demand also conies to
this country—for the United States is
conspicuously more advanced in eco
nomic entomological work than any
other nation —from other countries.
Stanford entomologists have found
daces in Hawaii, Japan, Peru, the
Philippines, Po.vto Rico, Cuba, Mexico,
and Canada.
Hut the chief attraction of the work,
it seems to me, is that it is constantly
a work of study and investigation, and
that tliis study and research is mostly
out-of-doors and, barring a little tink
ering with spraying machines and
dabbling with simple chemical con
coctions, wholly a study of living na
ture.

an attention to the details of crop and
forest and animal and human relations
to insect predators and parasites.
As rather more than two-thirds of
all the half-nrllion known kinds of
animals are insects, and as a discour
agingly large numbe.r of these 350,000
different insect kinds are "bad bugs,"
it is plain that the student takes on a
man's-size job when he sots out on the
career of professional economic ento
mologist. Hut that is one of the good
things about it. It is exciting work.

much of it is new work, and it offers
an inviting field for ingenuity, initia
tive and investigation. Every econom
ic entomologist, is, under present pion
eer conditions, an independent inves
tigator of animal and plant life. He
is doing continuous graduate study in
field and laboratory on a salary!
Fiut the salary, although always
enough from the start for one to live
on. and, as experience and recognition
comes, increasing to be enough for
two and three or even four o,r five, to
live on, never gets to be much more
than that. There are no such money
rewards in the work as those possible
to the unsual engineer or lawyer or
physician. But; on the other hand, I
have not heard of any economic ento
mologist starving.
The reason for this latter cheering
fact is that, up to the present, there
has been a demand for more young
men trained for the work than the
few universities and agricultural col
lege special departments of entomolo
gy have been able to turn out. The
demand comes from the government
bureau, from state departments, and
experiment stations, from county offi
cers, and sanitation organizations, and
is beginning even to come from pri
vate and corporation growers' associa
tion sources. A demand also conies to
this country—for the United States is
conspicuously more advanced in eco
nomic entomological work than any
other nation —from other countries.
Stanford entomologists have found
daces in Hawaii, Japan, Peru, the
Philippines, Po.vto Rico, Cuba, Mexico,
and Canada.
Hut the chief attraction of the work,
it seems to me, is that it is constantly
a work of study and investigation, and
that tliis study and research is mostly
out-of-doors and, barring a little tink
ering with spraying machines and
dabbling with simple chemical con
coctions, wholly a study of living na

Entomology used to mean mostly in
sect-collecting; now it means mostly
insect-fighting: the entomologist, who
was formerly popularly known as
"bug-hunter' is now known as "hug
killer." The discovery and realiza
tion that the farm, forest, and barn
yard products of this country suffer
an annual loss of a billion dollars
through insect attack, and that a doz
en or more of the most serious dis
eases that scourge mankind are spread
by insects, and three or four of them
are exclusively so spread, have
changed the popular attitude toward
the student of insects. The study is
recognized to be no longer merely the
idle pastime of harmless cranks, but
the serious business of trained scien
tific men. And the fruit and grain and
cotton growers, the forest conserva
tors, the stockmen and the physicians
all unite in calling loudly 011 the eco
nomic entomologist for help.
This help is being offered by a few
of the older general naturalists who
gave themselves, from special interest,
particularly to the study of insect life,
but is offered in larger measure by a
much greater number of young men—
men who have devoted themselves al
most exclusively to the specialized
