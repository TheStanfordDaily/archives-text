Scaffoldings have been erected at
the front of the Memorial Church in
preparation for the removal of the nio- |
saics from the base of the upper por
tion of the facade. This is the .result
of the Hoard of Trustees condemning
the design of pond lillies, which now j
occupies the space, as architecturally
inartistic.
Signor Zampato Lorenzo has al
ready prepared several of the golden
pillar effects which will replace the
present adornments. Formerly a large
dedicatory inscription covered this
space. Inner work on the west side of
the church is progressing slowly. The
