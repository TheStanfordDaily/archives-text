# FANS WITNESS FAST BOXING TOURNAMENT
## Argall and Lytle Take Middle and Welterweight Titles. Other Finals Deferred 
### 
Boxing of every description, from
the kind that you used to see 011 Si
Perkin's old barn floor, to the big
league stuff that is staged in two
colored championship prizefights, was
handed in good measure to a great
crowd of enthusiastic fans that surged
around the ringside in Encina Gymna
sium last evening.
L. S. Argall, '15, carried away the
University title in the middleweight
division, after a close go with H. T.
Ashford, '15, who won his way into the
finals by defeating M. M. Kirksey, 'IS.
R. S. Lytle, '17, earned Ibe right to
carry away the welterweight cham
pionship after standing severe pun
ishment from C. E. Wheeler, '15, who
landed hard blows where blows hurt,
but was forced to the ropes by Lytle's
rapid-fire comeback. In their final
round, Lytle and Wheeler fought like
demons, and misses were few and far
between.
In the middleweight division Argall
defeated E. A. Bacon, '16, after a close
fight.
G. P. Ross. '14. and R. M. Good, *15,
arrived in the semi-finals after in
flicting punishment upon several con
tenders for lightweight honors. Good
and Ross will contest for the cham
pionship Friday at 5 o'clock in Encina
Gymnasium, the finals in this event
and the heavyweight having been post
poned last night on account of the
lateness of the hour, and due to the
fact that two of the fighters had al
ready been through half a dozen
rounds.
Ross was given the decision over V.
Y. Malcolm, 'IS. R. M. Good fought
A. E. Svenson, '17. to a draw, then won
an unanimous decision after a hard
scrap. G. G. Howard, '13, and Good
afforded the fans amusement in a
lightning bout, which ended in a vic
tory for Good.
In the welterweight section Lytle
and Wheeler fought into the semi
finals by out-boxing W. IT. Wass, '18,
and C. S. Milliken, '16. respectively.
The heavyweight bouts from first to
last were examples of genuine boxing.
H. W. McXulty. '17, won a close de
cision ove.r T. K. Clark. '18. W. R.
Wheatlev. '17, was given a well-earned
victory over E. T. Dutton, '15.
Genuine champ onship work came to
light when Wheatly faced .T. T. Wvlie,
'17. After three rounds of hard hit
ting. in which both contenders found
touch, the judges called for another
round. Wheatly won by clever dodging
and speedy drives. Wheatly and Mc-
Nulty oppose each other Friday after
noon for the heavyweight title. Wheat
ly was the lightest man in the large
division, being but one pound above
middleweight requirements.
