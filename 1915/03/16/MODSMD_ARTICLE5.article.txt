# EXTENSIVE PLANS ARE BEING MADE FOR 1915 ALUMNI REUNION
## EVERY CLASS WILL ATTEND Communications From All Parts of the Country Promise Hearty Support to J.E. McDowell 
### 
J. E. McDowell, '00, secretary of the
Association of Stanford Alumni, is
bending every effort to make the 1915
reunion an event to lie long remem
bered. Alumni Day is scheduled for
May 1 ;>, just two days before the end
of Senior Week.
Over half of the classes that have
graduated from Stanford have already
signified their intentions of holding
extensive meetings on the cam
pus at, that date. This list includes
those of 1895, 1896, 1597, 1898, 1899,
1900, 1904, 1907, 1910, 1912, 1913 and
1914, and all the others will undoubt
edly send their representatives. Or
dinarily each class plans its reunion
for one year in five, but this Alumni
Day will see all of the classes in ev
idence.
Following out the general plan, the
various departments will also keep
open house on Alumni Day. Already
the English Club, the three Engineer
ing Societies, the Education Society,
the J. D. Society, the Physics Society,
and the Art Club are making plans to
entertain the graduates of their de
partments.
On May 14, the same evening for
which the Promenade Concert in the
Memorial Court is slated, the various
fraternities and sororities will be ex
pected to hold alumni meetings in the
chapter houses. Cap and Gown, Cos
mopolitan Club, and other societies
will also hold reunions for their alum
ni.
The plans as detailed are very ex
tensive, and will require a great
amount of time and work for their
successful completion. Stress is laid
upon the part which the active stu
dents will play in the entertainment
of so many guests. Many hundreds
will be thrown upon the hospitality of
the campus for this great week-end,
and it is important that every man and
woman get behind the project and
boost it. Mr. McDowell expects the
support of the student body, and the
presence of every one on the campus
during Senior Week will be necessary
for the complete success of his plans.
