# "Ballots not Bullets" A Timely Appeal of Jenkin Lloyd Jones
## 
### 
'The measure of a man's culture is
the breadth of his sympathies." A
wealth of such epigrams characterized
the speech of Jenkin Lloyd .lones, who
spoke in the Chapel last night on "In
ternational Friendship." The speaker
is the head of the Abraham Lincoln
Center in Chicago. Instead of giving
a lecture, Mr. Jones talked informally,
illustrating his points with anecdotes
gathered from his experiences in the
Civil War. "Any man can like the
people lie likes, but it takes an edu
cated man to like the people he doesn't
like." "It takes a higher form of hero
ism to lead a civil life than a military
life," said the speaker. "There were
men in the Civil War who did full
duty with their bullets who failed to
do their duty with their ballots." He
explained that the Civil War would
have been unnnecessary had men used
their ballots properly.
