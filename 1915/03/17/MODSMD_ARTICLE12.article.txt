The Zoellner Quartet is indeed unique
in its composition. Father, daughter,
and two sons comprise it; thus that in
timacy, which is so integral a part of
performing this type of music, is here
attained as in no other contemporary
Quartet. They have had every ad
vantage to cultivate their art. both in
this country and in Europe. For five
years they made their home in Brus
sels, where they were always splendid
ly received. They appeared in Merlin
and in many cities of France with suc
cess. In 1912 they returned to Amer
ica.and since have played three sea
sons from coast to coast.

Quartet playing, in the type which
they exemplify, is always interesting,
for it is not. the dr.v-as-dust, academic
ally hampered kind, which plays noth
ing more modern than Beethoven. The
Zoellners play Beethoven, and play it
well; but, like all progressive artists,
they believe in bringing out the works
of contemporary musicians.
There is something additional to this
concert aside from the excellent enter
tainment which it will afford. The
Faculty Committee on Public Enter
tainment announces that any surplus
realized, which exceeds the expendi
tures of the present number and cov
ers a small obligation .remaining, as
the result of a previous entertainment,
will be contributed to the relief of Bel
gium. the country with which this
unique quartet has been so intimately
associated.
