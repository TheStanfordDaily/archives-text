### 
Chairmen of the five teams which
will contest in the Irish Marathon
race have issued a call for candidates
to contest for places on the respective
class teams in the annual distance
event. Each afternoon trials are be
ing run on the track, and the twenty
four men with the best records will be
selected to run on March 27. So fat
very few men have signified their in
tention of trying-out. Although a man
may never have donned a spike he
will not be any the worse for wear if
he runs a trial lap, and at least makes
an effort to strengthen his class team.
It is not an easy matter to find 120
men in the University who have trained
consistently and can run a quarter
mile. This is the very reason why you
should do your part. It is the un
trained, as well as the trained run
ners who will be counted on to win
victory for their class. There are
three incentives for trying-out; first,
opportunity for exercise; second, class
spirit, and third, love for competition.
Go out now; limber up; and at least
do your part in perfecting your own
class team.
