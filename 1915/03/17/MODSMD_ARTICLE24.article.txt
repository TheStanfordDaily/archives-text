# LAST ISSUE OF SEQUOIA UNDER E.H. FORD APPEARS
## Poetry and Prose Combine to Make March Sequoia of Unusual Merit. 
### 
Balanced by contributions of poetry
and prose bearing distinctive merit
and originality, the Stanford Sequoia
made ts mid-semester appearance on
the Quad this morning. As a frontis
piece the group which not long
ago stood in Memorial Court has been
chosen, and with it, in recognition of
the Founders, goes "A Tribute," by
Glenn A. Hughes, 'IG. Among other
features are to be found "The Inter
vention," a story by R. A. Griffin, '17;
"Stanford â€”at the approach of Spring,"
a poem by -Dhan Mukerji, gr.; "Cow
ardice," a story by J. W. Bennett, '15.
The story "Cowardice," by J. W.
Bennett, '15, is unusually interesting,
since it enters into the analysis of a
confessed coward by himself and tells
of his struggles to overcome his great
est defect. Mukerji, a Hindu student,
in his mystic poem on spring gives a
hint of the mysticism of the Far East.
The issue concludes with a harmoni
ous story by W. H. Waterman, 'IS,
who portrays the peculiar military
and social standards of the Mexican
revolutionists.
This issue is the last to appear un
der the direction of E. H. Ford, '15,
who resigned his position of editor,
owing to the press of other work. The
Sequoia will be subsequently handled
by J. W. Bennett, '15, who has been a
constant contributor.
