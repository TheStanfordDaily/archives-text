# Sonny on Spring

Stanford, March 17, 1915.
Dearest Ma: Spring is here and
mosquitos, frogs, and summer dresses.
Either I've got the spring fever, or the
spring fever's got me! Spring fever,
ma, i'ke typhoid feve.r, does not cause
a sudden rise in temperature, but the
pulse will insist on accelerating at
times. Hay fever will make a person
sneeze at the smallest whiff of certain
perfumes. Spring fever will make a
fellow sniff and sigh when certain
perfumes strike his nostrils. And if
they strike right his pulse will run
wild, and he will think of bungalows
and rice and fu.vniture bills. I've
known you too long to think that
you're wondering what this has to do
with me. She's a swell kind, ma, sort
of dark blonde, almost brunette, wears
her hair in a curly sort of a, —you
know how most of the girls up here
wear them. She sure can walk —say,
when I see her sluffing along in her
rubbe.r-tired tennis street shoes, dolled
up in a white skirt and a dazzling co'-
ored yellow or cerease coat, T just
want to run up and fox-trot to the fair
without a moment's delay, or a chape
rone. Are you wondering how I met
her? You see, it was like this —her
postoffice box is next to mine, and my
key happens to fit her box. One morn
ing I made a mistake, and she hap
pened to be there the same time I was.
It all came out okus. We exchanged
glances, and now we exchange tele
phone messages. As Caesar said on
the Ides of March, "to err is humane."
Much St. Patrick's Day love from your
SONNY.
