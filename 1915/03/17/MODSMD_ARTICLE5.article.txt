At NVeingartner's drug sto.re, in Palo
Alto, 150 people braved the hot sun in
hopes of being numbered among those
present when the small figures were
released. The men who didn't fit in
on the campus created a near stam
pede when they "hurried" via Penin
sula railway, or by motorcycle, private
jitney, and bicycle to the Palo Alto
dispensary, where they were more for
tunate. At two o'clock Weingartner
reported that practically every desir
able seat on the lower floor had been
sold. At this hour the Bookstore on
the campus was still disposing of the
pasteboards. The demand was heavy
