### 
Resolutions of sympathy to the fam
ily of Lincoln Beachy, the "Stanford"
aviator, were drafted at the .regular
meeting of the Executive Committee
last evening. The entire University
community was shocked by the news
of bis death last week, and the ex
pression of the deep regret of the
Student Body is embodied in the reso
lutions which follow:
"Whereas, the students of Stanford
University have been saddened by the
trag'c death of Lincoln Beaehy, who
won the admiration, rpspect and love
of the entire University on the occa
sion of the twenty-fourth annual
rugby contest between Stanford and
California when he flew over the field
as a Cardinal supporter, lie it hereby
"Resolved, That we, the students of
Iceland Stanford Junior University, do
extend our heartfelt sympathy to the
bereaved family and friends, and es
pecially to the mother who loses he,r
son in the very hour of triumph; and
be it
"Further resolved. That a copy of
these resolutions be sent to the ber
eaved family, and that a copy be pub
lished in The Daily Palo Alto and also
spread on the records of the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford Univer
sity.
In order to stimulate interest in
high school debating contests, the ex
ecutive committee authorized the pur
chase of a cup to be presented to the
Debating League of Southern Califor
nia. This cup replaces the one which
was donated in 1904, and will be
awarded to the school which first
wins it three times.
It was decided that the Student
Body would bear 75 per cent of the
expenses incurred in having an ex
pert accountant to supervise the books
of all organizations, beginning with
Ap.ril 1. This applies to the college
year. Work during vacations will be
entirely pa'd for by the Student Body,
but during regular sessions, the or
ganizations must contribute 25 per
cent towards the accountant's salary.
