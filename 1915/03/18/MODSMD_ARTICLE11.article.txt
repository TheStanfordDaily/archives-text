# GLEE CLUB TRIP TO SOUTH IS DEFERRED UNTIL AFTER FINALS
## 
### 
The Glee Club trip to Los Angeles
and vicinity, scheduled for the Easter
vacation, has been jiostponed until
May because the concerts, which were
to have been given in the high schools
during school hours were made impos
sible when the vacation week of the
southern schools was set for March 27
to April 4, the time of the Stanford in
termission. The action on the part of
the school authorities nullified the
work of the Glee Club advance man, R.
R. Speers, '18, who was sent out some
time ago to complete arrangements
for the appearances of the musical or
ganization.
Speers returned to the campus yes
terday, and reported a very favorable
reception of the Glee Club proposition
on the part of the high schools and
promises of help from the alumni. The
high schools expressed themselves as
willing and in favor of holding open
annual dates for the appearance of
the Stanford singers every year. The
tour of the north Pacific Coast by
Stanford's Glee Club last year brought
the name of Stanford before the north
erners and the members of the organ
ization last night favored instituting a
yearly trip to Southern California.
