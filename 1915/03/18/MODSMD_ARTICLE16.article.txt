# OUT OF PLACE
## 
### 
Posters of one description and an
other advertising various events have
recently been indiscriminately placed
in practically every window on the
east side of the Quadrangle and on
various trees, posts and telegraph
poles on the campus, in fact, in every
place but the right place. When bul
letin boards were constructed it was
the understanding that posters should
be placed only on such bulletin
boards, and that they be especially
discarded from the windows of the
' Quadrangle. This fact may not be
known to the managers of the var
ious organizations which have seen fit
to ignore the .rules of the Student
Body. Whether the individuals re
sponsible for such promiscuous anvei
tising knew of the ruling or not it is
evident to the most enthuiastic adver
tiser that the posters are unsightly
and obnoxious, and for this reason
necessarily out of place. It is to be
hoped that the posters now decorat
ing the windows of the Quandrangle
will be removed in the very near fu
ture and no further undecorative
schemes will be tried by ardent man
agers.
