# BENEFIT FOR BOOTH HOME AROUSES MUCH INTEREST
## 
### 
Much interest is being manifested in
the entertainment to be given in the
Assembly Hall this evening for the
benefit of the Maud Booth Ballington
Home. That the Palo Alto orphanage
greatly needs support financially at
this time is indicated by the over
crowded conditions in the boy's sleep
ing quarters. Some have even been
forced to sleep in tents during the
winter months. Money secured from
tonight's performance will augment
the fund being raised to build a com
fortable dormitory fo.r the boys. In or
der that more may patronize the bene
fit, tickets have been reduced to fifty
cents in price.
In addition to the regular program
the Stanford Glee Club will render
several selections.
