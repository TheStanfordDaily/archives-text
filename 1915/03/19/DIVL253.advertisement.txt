The Comradeship of "Bull" Durham
There is something about ripe, mellow "Bull"
Durham Tobacco that appeals to clean-cut manhood
the world over.
Wherever in the world two "Bull" Durham smokers
meet—in a hotel lobby or club in Europe or America; at cross
trails in the Klondike; in some far-off seaport on the Pacific
— each recognizes in the other a man to his own liking, a
comrade in the world-wide brotherhood of "the Makings."
A sack of "Bull" Durham is a letter of introduction that wilL
win friends in every part of the globe.
