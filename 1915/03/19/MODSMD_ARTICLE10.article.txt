# Innovation in Sale of Big Meet Tickets
## 
### 
Indications point ng to a demand
for tickets at the annual Stanford-
California track meat, April 17, that
will exceed the supply have caused
graduate managers It. W. Wilcox and
.1. A. Stroud to decide to conduct a
sale of seats similar to that used for
the rugby game last fall. There will
be a regular drawing on April fi at
th? Stanford Union and the students
and faculty members will be given
first opportunity to secure admission
tiekets to 1 he rooters' and alumni sec
tions. All of the seats will be reserved
just as they are at the intercollegiate
football game. None but those hold
ing season tickets will be allowed to
purchase student reserved seats. No
cessary information regarding the
drawing and sale to the students and
faculty members is given below.
