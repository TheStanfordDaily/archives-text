# MEAGER AUDIENCE ATTENDS DESERVING CHARITY PLAY
## 
### 
A small audience patronized the en
tertainment staged yesterday evening
for the benefit of the Maud Balling
ton Booth Home. Only a minimum
amount was cleared in excess of ex
penses.
Those that did attend witnessed an
interestingly prepared program, the
most remarkable feature of which
was the appearance of the little folks
of the home in drills, songs and
dances.
