# NEW BRIDGES WERE BUILT DURING THE MIDDLE AGES
## Interesting Stereoptican Slides Illustrate Second Lecture to Engineers by .J.D. Galloway. 
### 
Development of bridge construction
during the period known as the "Dark
Ages" was the subject of the third
illustrated lecture given yesterday af
ternoon for civil and structural engin
eering students by J. D. Galloway of
San Francisco. Illustrations of var
ious forms of bridge work accomplish
ed during this period were not con
fined to Europe but were taken from
all parts of the world in which con
struction progressed.
The presentation of the stereopti
can views was preceded by a brief
review of the decay of the Roman
Empire and the .result which its dis
memberment had upon building
throughout the world. According to
Mr. Galloway only two pieces of real
construction were accomplished dur
ing the "Dark Ages" and those were
an aquaduct and a bridge built in Asia
Minor while the remants of the Ro
man Empire were under the rule of
the Emperor Justinian.
Following the historical review,
slides illustrating bridges in use dur
ing Middle Ages were shown. The
Chinese bridges, many of which were
of the suspension type were of particu
lar interest. In general they were of
two kinds: those made entirely.of cane
and others which were suspended by
heavy iron chains. Mr. Galloway as
serted that, although the Chinese used
many laughable contrivances such as
a rope and sling for crossing the wat
er, they were nevertheless remark
able bridge builders. The longest of
the early Chinese suspension bridges
has a span of 360 feet.
The next of the series of lectures
given by Mr. Galloway will commence
with h'story of bridge construction
beginning with the modern age. It
will be given Thursday, March 25, at
3:00 p. m.in room 283 of the Engin
eering building.
