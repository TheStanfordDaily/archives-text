# De Lisle All-Stars to Oppose Varsity
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the Stanford
Varsity will play its last Saturday
game previous to the intercollegiate
match with California slated for the
week-end following. De Lisle's All-
Stars. an aggregation of farmer uni
versity stars, will afford competition.
The second team is scheduled to line
up against the Empress Theater nine
of San Francisco in the early morn
ing, thereby offering the fans the usu
al double-header.
Coach Hilly Orr has announced that
he will not present his strongest front
against the invaders. Neither Doe
Hayes nor Gus Hoever will be used in
the box. Roth of the hurlers have ex
perienced rather heavy work of late,
and fo.r this reason will be given along
desired opportunity to rest. Wicker
sham, who pitched fo.r the winning
interclass nine, has been selected to
start the game. Ave Howe, who has
yet to twirl for Stanford this year
will relieve Wickersham later in the
contest. Instead of Dent, Lander will
appear behind the plate.
The regular infield quartet, con
sisting of Workman, first base, Staf
ford, second; Stevens, short, and Mc-
Closkey, third base, will take the field.
Day is to occupy left field, Austin
cento,", and Downing the right garden.
To the majority of the followers of
baseball, the All-Star n'ne is well
loown, since practically the same team
's used every season. Among those
who compose the team are former
ccach. George Presley, and Johnny
Couch, erstwhile Vars'ty pitch ?r. Do
Lisle's lines-up in the
following batting order: Do Lisle, of.;
E. Gay, rf.; Sampson, ss.; F. Gay, 3b.;
Gillis, 2b.; Rutler, If.; Hamilton, lb.;
Presley, c.; Seitz, Couch, p.
The afternoon game will not be
<z;in until four o'clock, in order to
eliminate any conflict of time with
the Olympic track meet scheduled for
thr e o'clock. The morning contest
will commence at nine-thirty sharp.
The second Vars'ty, when it opposes
the Empress Theater nine, will form
a strong club. The battery will be
composed of Hayes and Hurley. Camp
bell will cove.r first. Dieki > second,
M-isters short and Mulford third. The
