# Sale of Opera Tickets Surpasses Expectations
## Committee Points With Pride to Few Remaining Seats and Says "Greatest Ever." 
### 
It has been said in regard to each
succeeding Junior Opera since time
immemorial that the "sale of seats"
lias exceeded all previous records.
There never was a sale of tickets for
any Stanford production, the big
game excluded, that could touch the
record atta'ned in the box office re
ceipts for "At the Dragon's Eye." In
Palo Alto the demand was far great
er than the supply, while the campus
everything excepting a couple of doz
en seats in the rear of the orchestra
section, have been snapped up by the
eager thousands who know a genuine
comic opera when they hear about it.
"All previous reco.rds shattered" is
the cry of the 1916 committee. A
glance at the blue print on exhibi
tion in the bookstore will confirm the
assertion, the red cancelling marks
cover practically the entire lower
floor, and all the desirable balcony ac
comondations.
Quality, not quanity is the slogan
of "At the Dragon's Eye." The ten
thirty closing rule need not be violat
ed on next Thu.rsday evening unless
of one's ov;n volition, for the 1910
opera will be short, sweet, and snappy.
