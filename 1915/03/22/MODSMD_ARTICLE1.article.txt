# TRI-STATE DEBATE IS VICTORY FOR STANFORD
## Both Cardinal Teams Secure Judges' Decisions UPHOLD OPPOSITE SIDES English and Fribley Down Oregon in Chapelâ€”Washington Loses to Crobaugh and Weston. 
### 
Stanford's Tri-state debaters won
a sweeping victory over their oppo
nents from the Universities oi' Wash
ington and Oregon last Friday even
ing, getting a majority decision both
at home and in Seattle.
H. It. English, '10, and .7. W. Frib
ley, 'Hi, upholding the affirmative side
of the: question, "Resolved, that the
federal government should own and
operate all interstate .railroads, act
ing as common carriers, including in
trastate lines competing with them,"
won from Oregon in the chapel. C.
B. Weston, *15, and M. Crobaugh, '18,
invading Washington's territory, prov
ed the merit of the negative side of
the same question, by winning from
their northern opponents. This is the
first time that any of these men have
represented Stanford in debate.
English opened for the affirmative,
showing first that the railroad prob
lem today is a bigger one than it us
ed to be. "Three years ago," he saio,
"the task was one of correcting a few
evils regarding .rebates and discrim
ination. but now the problem is to sup
ply the railroad needs of the country.
Ttoth the extension of present lines,
and the improvement of old ones by
double tracking, more switches and
better stock, is necessary. This means
that a vast amount of capital must be
secured. Where are the railroads go
ing to get this capital?
"The people, l:oth of this country
and Europe, have lost confidence in
railroads because of the scandals
which have been connected with them
from time to time, and for this reason
they have become unwilling to invest.
Furthermore, the market for securities
has diminished due to the fact that the
profits are not as large as they used
to be. The railroads themselves con
fess that I hey are unable to secure the
necessary capital. Increase in tin 1
rates is the only solution which they
have to offer."
P. Crockett, first speaker for Ore
gon, argued that the railroads were
unable to secure capital because of the
attacks on them by the government,
and the uncertainty resulting. "But
now, "he maintained, "the statuts of
the railroad has been settled and the
uncertainty eliminated. This fact has
restored confidence, and in the future,
capital can be secured.
"Confidence has not been restored",
declared Fribley, who spoke next. "The
newspapers may not say that it is, but
the facts show that the public is not
investing.
"The United States will never stand
for a continuous raise in the railroad
rates, and the only way capital can bp
secured is by internal conservation of
resources. This in turn can only tjr
obtained by unification of control. In
whose hands," he asked, "is this unifi
cation to take place? America would
never allow private control, but even
if it would, the government could best
handle the business through its great
er power to command cheap rates of
'nterest. Unused capital would also
be putin circulation.
"The scheme of government control
is practical. An expert, nonpartisan
commission would handle the business
efficiently and without partiality."
