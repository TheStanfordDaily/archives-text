# TRI-STATE DEBATE IS VICTORY FOR STANFORD
## Both Cardinal Teams Secure Judges' Decisions UPHOLD OPPOSITE SIDES English and Fribley Down Oregon in Chapelâ€”Washington Loses to Crobaugh and Weston. 
### 
Stanford's Tri-state debaters won
a sweeping victory over their oppo
nents from the Universities oi' Wash
ington and Oregon last Friday even
ing, getting a majority decision both
at home and in Seattle.
H. It. English, '10, and .7. W. Frib
ley, 'Hi, upholding the affirmative side
of the: question, "Resolved, that the
federal government should own and
operate all interstate .railroads, act
ing as common carriers, including in
trastate lines competing with them,"
won from Oregon in the chapel. C.
B. Weston, *15, and M. Crobaugh, '18,
invading Washington's territory, prov
ed the merit of the negative side of
the same question, by winning from
their northern opponents. This is the
first time that any of these men have
represented Stanford in debate.
English opened for the affirmative,
showing first that the railroad prob
lem today is a bigger one than it us
ed to be. "Three years ago," he saio,
"the task was one of correcting a few
evils regarding .rebates and discrim
ination. but now the problem is to sup
ply the railroad needs of the country.
Ttoth the extension of present lines,
and the improvement of old ones by
double tracking, more switches and
better stock, is necessary. This means
that a vast amount of capital must be
secured. Where are the railroads go
ing to get this capital?
"The people, l:oth of this country
and Europe, have lost confidence in
railroads because of the scandals
which have been connected with them
from time to time, and for this reason
they have become unwilling to invest.
