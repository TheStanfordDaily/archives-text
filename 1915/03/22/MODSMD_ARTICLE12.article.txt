Saturday's track competition with
the Olympic Club team resulted in a
number of good performances, par
ticularly Feg Murray's time of 24 1-5
seconds in the low hurdles. This
record breaks the Pacific Coast mark
of :24 3-r>, held jointly by Herb Whit
ted and Murray, and is within 3-5 of
a second of the world's best perfor
mance. Most of the races were hotly
contested, and the clubmen showed
to good advantage. The final score
was 77 to 45.
The mile run brought out the en
durance and strong finish of Aupperle,
who trailed Wilson to the tape, and
showed a clean pair of heels to the
veteran Millard. Millard came back
in the two mile, beating ont Chap
man by a few yards with a terrific
sprint on the home stretch.
Feg Murray ran away with the high
hurdles in:15.2, Templeton showed
to advantage by winning the novice
heat in a fast :16.
Chace's finish in the quarter was
the feature of the race. After get
ting off last, he gradually forged to
the head, and beat Lin Murray at the
tape by a good margin. Real ran a
fast lap in the novice race.
Miller in the hammer throw,
Caughey in the shot, Dingley in the
broad jump, Dykes in the high jump
and Krohn in the pole vault gave
greatest promise in the field competi
tions.

high jump, clearing the bar at 6 feat
1 1-2 inches.
