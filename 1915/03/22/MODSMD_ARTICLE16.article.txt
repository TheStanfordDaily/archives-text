# A
						DOUBLE VICTORY
## 
### 
Stanford debaters, competing against
Oregon at home and the University of
Washington in Seattle, won two clean
cut victories on Eriday evening, and
thereby captured the Tri-State debat
ing championship. The debaters and
the debating coach deserve high
tribute and the praise of all of us for
their untiring efforts and the final
triumph in the face of difficulties,
such as confront them at Stanford.
It is not an easy task for a student
to undertake the work devolving up
on a debater in any institution under
the most favorable conditions, but to
do it at Stanford, and then win out,
is especially praiseworthy.
