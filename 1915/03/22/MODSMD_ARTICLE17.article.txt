# Turkish Problems Are Explained by Goodsell
## "Turkey Has Failed in All But Minor Actions of Present War," Declares Speaker. 
### 
"Turkish Dilemmas", the problems
that have arisen from the present war
situation in the Ottoman Empire, were
clearly explained by Fred Goodsell,
California '02, at the regular Sunday
Encina assemblage yesterday evening.
A large and varied collection of beauti
ful stereoptican views illustrated the
lecture.
Goodsell emphasized the fact that
the Turkish forces had absolutely fail
ed in all but a few minor actions of
the present European conflict. This
ho attributed to the slow, antique
methods of warfare that prevail am
ong the Moslems.
The substance of his remarks fol
lows :
"Existing conditions have caused at
least a temporary cessation in the ad
vancement of the educational move
ment in Turkey. Recently many
thousands of piastres have been ex
pended annually for the construction
and maintenance of schools, especially
advanced institutions, medical col
leges and the like.
"Division of Turkey by the Allies
has already been planned. If victor
ious, Russia, England and France will
each secure a share of the Asia Min
or territory and if the Teutons achieve
success they will gain a desirable por
tion of coveted Turkey. It is impos
sible to determine what the influ
ence of higher education will be if
the country ! s divided between Euro
pean powers."
