# ZOELLNERS LIVE UP TO CAMPUS EXPECTATIONS
## Work of Quartet Shows Good Technique and Excels Similar Productions of the Year. 
### Innings 
The Zoellner Quartet, playing under
the auspices of the Faculty Com
mittee on Public Entertainment, pre
sented a program of chamber-music
Friday evening in the Assembly Hall
such as has not been heard here
since the visit of the Flonzaleys last
year. Their work is the perfsct reali
zation of ensemble music, marked by
a deep sympathy and unity of pur
pose and execution.
The Beethoven quartet with which
the Zoellners opened their program
was given a sincere and dignified in
terpretation from the deep, sustained
notes of the Adagio to the lighter
touches and whimsical motif of the
Scherzo Allegro.
A charming composition new to
most of the audience was the Iwanow
quartet, the second offering of the ev
ening. In the first movement, the Hu
moresca, the artists triumphed in their
spontaneous rendering of this vivid bit
of music. In contrast, their playing
imbued the second movement with the
deep, warm calm of a summer night.
As an encore the quartet gave a dainty
Minuet, dating from the sixteenth cen
tury.
A violin solo, which was to have
been played by Amandus Zoellner,
was omitted. The Andante Cantabile
from Tsehaikowsky's Quartet, Op. 11
was umlerstandingly given. breathing
the peace of all outdoors. This was
followed by the delightful Minuet by
Glinks.
The final number on the evening's
program comprised Them's haunting
"Genius Loci" and the novel Glazonn
ow Suite, Op. 35, which has been in
troduced to American audiences by the
Zoellners. The latter opens with a
rippling Scherzo movement which is
followed by the wiertl, exotic Orientale.
This second movement is marked by
a strangely wailing rhythm and intro
duces an effectively monotonous piz
zicato accompaniment, in tlrs num
ber the composer has brought out the
possibilities of the viola's hollow
sweetness most interestingly, arid Mr.
Joseph Zoellner, Sr., made the most of
this opportunity to display the qual
ities of his chosen instrument.

from Tsehaikowsky's Quartet, Op. 11

Glinks.
The final number on the evening's
program comprised Them's haunting
"Genius Loci" and the novel Glazonn

troduced to American audiences by the
Zoellners. The latter opens with a
rippling Scherzo movement which is
followed by the wiertl, exotic Orientale.
This second movement is marked by
a strangely wailing rhythm and intro

zicato accompaniment, in tlrs num

possibilities of the viola's hollow
sweetness most interestingly, arid Mr.
Joseph Zoellner, Sr., made the most of
this opportunity to display the qual

The Zoellner Quartet, playing under
the auspices of the Faculty Com
mittee on Public Entertainment, pre
sented a program of chamber-music
Friday evening in the Assembly Hall
such as has not been heard here
since the visit of the Flonzaleys last
year. Their work is the perfsct reali
zation of ensemble music, marked by
a deep sympathy and unity of pur
pose and execution.
The Beethoven quartet with which
the Zoellners opened their program
was given a sincere and dignified in
terpretation from the deep, sustained
notes of the Adagio to the lighter
touches and whimsical motif of the
Scherzo Allegro.
A charming composition new to
most of the audience was the Iwanow
quartet, the second offering of the ev
ening. In the first movement, the Hu
moresca, the artists triumphed in their
spontaneous rendering of this vivid bit
of music. In contrast, their playing
imbued the second movement with the
deep, warm calm of a summer night.
As an encore the quartet gave a dainty
Minuet, dating from the sixteenth cen
tury.
A violin solo, which was to have
been played by Amandus Zoellner,
was omitted. The Andante Cantabile
from Tsehaikowsky's Quartet, Op. 11
