# ANNUAL PI PHI SMOKER IS PHENOMENAL SUCCESS
## PRECEDENT OF MANY YEARS IS WELL MAINTAINED Efficient Work of Guests Insures Feasibility of Entertainment for Similar Organizations. 
### 
Exceeding the expectations of even
the most sanguine of campus dwellers,
Pi Beta Ph' yeste.rday conducted its
annual at home in the brown house be
yond the gates. In its wide appeal
to the Campus public and in its sensa
tional and thrilling denouement, Sun
day's blaze reached the high mark of
the season's fire record.
Commencing with the cries given by
an automobiling party passing the
! house, the alarm quickly reached ev
-1 ery corner of the Campus even to the
lake, as was attested by the large ag
gregation of fire fighters appearing in
bathing suits. A volunteer corps
| equipped with a garden hose and fire
[ extinguishers climbed up to the roof,
under which the fire had started and
j was rapidly gaining headway.
Immediately after the alarm was giv
en two distinct actions commenced:
the inrush of students and the outrush
!of household furnishings. The thor
oughness with which the house was
! emptied of all portable matter, while
at the same time the conflagration
in the attic was undergoing extinction,
speaks eloquently for the volunteer
fire department. At the same time
that the piano was being conveyed
! to safety without the ruffle o'f <n
' single page of music on its top, an
other pair were doing a "ten-flat"
across the street with a library table
upon which rested a drop light.
Every upstairs window spouted mat
tresses by the flock and the clouds of
dust eminating from their connection
with Mother Earth suggests that per
haps the annual blaze has become
synonomous with house-cleaning.
The fire and the furniture were out
simultaneously and it is said that the
last squad of work-basket rescuers re
entered without deposit'ng their sal
vaged goods.
As near as it is possible to deter
mine the source of the conflagration
is the same chimney that has been ig
niting the house regularly for the past
four or five years. According to an ex
pert who has attended the majority of
the parties, yesterday's fire had its
or ; t?in not more than a foot from that
of last winter's attraction. Some dam
age will result from water, smoke and
chemical, but all is well covered Dy
insurance as a result of long experi
ence.
