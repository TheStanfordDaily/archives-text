# STANFORD DAY
## At Exposition Poorly Attended by University Delegates. 
### 
A meager representation of both
campus and alumni people attended
the Stanford Day exercises at the
Panama-Pacific Exposition Saturday,
and many of the Cardinal visitors to
the fair on that day were not inter
ested enough in the celebration to be
present at the Court of the Universe,
where speeches were mads in honor
of the event.
Chancellor Jordan acted as chair
man of the day, and was the first
speaker. A handsome bronze plaque
was ])r sented to \Y. .Mayo Newhall for
the University by Leon Sloss, vice
president of the Exposition Board of
Directors. Doctor Jordan was com
missioned by President Newhall to
bring the plaque to the campus. Hon.
George E. Crowthers, of the San
Francisco Superior Court, was the
Alumni representative among the
speakers. An Exposition band served
as an escort for the Stanford delega
tion from the F'llmore Street entrance
of the grounds to the Court of the
Universe.
The plaque will be placed in the
Museum with those received from the
St. Louis and Chicago expositions.
It is cased neatly, and has on it the
words, "Presented to the Leland Stan
ford Junior University By the Pan
ama-Pacific International Exposition
in Recognition of Its Co-operation.
March 20th, 1915. San Francisco."
