# "AT THE DRAGON'S EYE" READY FOR DRESS REHEARSAL TONIGH
## 
### 
"At the Dragon's Eye" is ready for
the finishing touches, which when
completed will find the opera ready
for the stage on Thursday evening.
The first dress rehearsal will be held
tonight. Impresarios Morgan and
Forbes put tlieir ambitious charges
through a full rehearsal Saturday
morning, revealing two acts that were
surprisingly near to a state of per
fection.
The few weak places were of such a
character that, nothing stronger than
the soothing balsam of time will be
needed as a heal-ng liniment. The
principals came through their difficult
and trying situations like veterans,
while the choruses performed tlieir
intricate "setting-up" exercises in a
most professional manner.
W. G. Paul, '15, and W. P. Detels,
'14, have contributed musical numbers
that will set a new standard in mel
ody and rhythm for Stanford operatic
productions. The opening number
will introduce Miss Irma Rayburn,
'Ifi, as Cherry San. the wonderful lit
tle tea girl of the "Dragon's Eye."
Cherry San might have been Cheery
San, for the Japanese tea girl is a
character that, w'll Inn;;' find a place
in the memory of the audience as a
delightful bit of humanity.
Miss Esther Liversidge, '17, as the
"T-want-to-be-a-missionary" girl, and
W. C. Paeon, '14, as the "Let-me-save
you-because-I-love-you" man cannot
help but score what is vulgarly known
as a hit when they appear together in
Paul's "Underneath the Campus
Moon," and in Detel's "Yearning for
You." Bacon's solo, "Fairest Little
Fairy at the Fair," by Detels, is a rol
licking good combination of words and
music. A. .1. Mclnerny, '1(1, has added
no little value to the opera with bis
well-fitting lyrics.
There are laughs a-plenty in Paul's
I "Chaperone Song," which Miss Nora
j Parker, '15, and her chorus of mis
| e'lievons "American Beauties" will
offer. Paul's "Panama Pacific Fair"
| will set 1500 pairs of feet in motion,
keeping time with Bacon and P. M.
Melvin, '17. in an unusually clever
dancmg skit.
