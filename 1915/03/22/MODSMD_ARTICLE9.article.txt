# VARSITY WALLOPS DE LISLE'S STARS
## Hard Hitting by Stanford Wins 5 to 2 Gameâ€”Downing Knocks Home-Run 
### 
De Lisle's All-Stars, an aggregation
of former collegiate balltossers, were
defeated in easy fashion by the Stan
ford Varsity Saturday afternoon in a
game void of features. The Card
inals were never headed after the
first inning, finally emerging on the
long end of a 5 to 2 count.
Wickersham, who worked on the
mound for the Varsity, pitched excel
lent ball, allowing seven scattered
h'ts during the nine rounds. Six of
the visitors fanned.
The local swatsmiths found the of
ferings of Seitz, Webber and Howe
quite to their liking. Workman, Aus
tin. Downing, and McCloskey each
banged out a brace of safeties. Russ
Downing was the slugger of the day,
as he connected for a double and a
four cushion wallop.
A number of old-time Stanford
players appeared in the All-Star line
up. Sampson, baseball captain in '09.
occupied third; Louis Cass, football
skipper in '13, played left field; Pres
ley, coach, caught; and Ave Howe, ex
'ls, pitched for a few innings.
The Varsity commenced scoring in
the first inning. Austin singled to
center and was sacrificed to second by
Stafford. When Hamilton made a
wild heave from first, Austin tallied.
