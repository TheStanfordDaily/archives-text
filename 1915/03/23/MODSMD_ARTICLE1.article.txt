Tomorrow afternoon, fans, dope
sheet compilers, and reporters will be
afforded their last opportunity to wit
ness the Cardinal nine in action pre
vious to the first same of the inter
collegiate series with California, when
Santa Cla.ra will make a flying trip
to the campus to engage the Varsity

After eleven weeks of preliminary
season practice, Coach Billy Orr and
Skipper Tom Workman make the an
nouncement that previous to tomor
row's game, the team which will meet
the blue and gold aggregation next
Saturday will be given out to the
bleacherites. The name of the pitcher
who will perform mound duty for
Stanford in the Big Game will not be
definitely known until the umpire an
nounces the opposing batteries. The
position of right fielder will also be
subject to later developments, depend
ing upon the choice of Coach Jimmy
Schaeffer as to who will toe the rub
ber.
Billy Orr, who ever since the season
commenced has given the Stanford
squad h'.s best as regards advice and
training, made his last appearance on
the campus Saturday at the De Lisle's
All-Star-Varsity game. It was his in
tention of returning yesterday, but
Blankenship, the manager of the Salt
Lake Coast League Club for whom Orr
plays short-stop, insisted that the Car
dinal coach remain with the Salt Lake
team. The Coast League season is
scheduled to begin March 30.
Wednesday's game with Santa Clara
will mark the third game of the series
with the Missionites. In the first en
counter Stanford won easily 10 to 1,
but lost the second contest after a
hard fight, 2 to 1. The Varsity will
present its full quota of strength
against Santa Clara tomorrow in an
effort to register a victory.
Four twirlers will be used in the
box. Hayes, Hoever, Wickersham. and
Howe, each are to be given a two or
three inning work-out. Dent is scned
uled to appear from behind the bars
for the full distance. Workman will
hold down the initial station; Stafford
the keystone sack: McCloskey the dif
ficult corner, and Stevens shortstop.
Day will occupy left, Austin center,
and Downing right field. Noonan and
O'Neill may be afforded an opportun
ity to play later in the game.
This afternoon, .Timmle Schaeffer
brought his proteges to the campus
for practice on the local field, pre
vious to the Varsity work-out. As
has been ths custom in preceding
years, the v'sitors were put through
their paces minus a Stanford audi
ence.
Tomorrow's game with Santa Clara
is slated to commence promptly at
four fifteen. It is desirable that a big
crowd of rooters fill the bleachers in
order to give the team a final rout
ing send-off.
