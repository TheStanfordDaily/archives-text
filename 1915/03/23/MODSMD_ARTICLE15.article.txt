# A 						NEW PLAN
## 
### 
Plans have been proposed from time
to time whereby members of the staff
of The Daily Palo Alto might receive
university credit for work on the pa
per. The schemes have never met
with the favorable approval of the
staff for the reason that it was fear
ed, through faculty influence, the pa
per might lose its reputation as a
free and independent spoksman of
student opinion. Recently, represen
tatives of the English department of
fered to make an agreement with
members of the staff in which credit
would be given for work on the pa
per, but it was stipulated that the fac
ulty would in no wise control the
policy of news of the paper and wou'd
not be responsible for its contents,
The plan in brief as proposed by the
English department is to institute a
course in practical journalism; mem
bers of the staff will be enrolled in
this course and receive credit for the
work which they do; and an instructor
in the English department will meet
with the staff once a day to talk over
the news for the day, show how the
makeup could be improved, discuss the
relative merit of news and offer gener
al suggestion for improving the paper.
It would be at the option of the editor
whether or not he should act on the
suggestions made by the instructor.
From a theoretical standpoint it
would appear that the paper could be
improved materially if such a plan
were instituted. There is always
room for betterment in any undertak
ing, and it is reasonable to suppose
that an instructor could offer many
valuable suggestions. Credit in such
a plan is of secondary importance to
members of the staff. If it were to
change the attitude of the members
in taking initiative and forming judge
ment the plan would be strongly op
posed and probably never instituted.
In order to determine whether the
plan is practical the staff has decided
to try the scheme during the month
of April. No credit will be given. A
member of the English department
will meet daily with the staff to con
sider the news of the day and offer
suggestions.. If the plan proves fea

sible and the paper improves on ac
count of the system, further steps will
be taken to place the plan on a firm
basis. If it does not prove practical,
the idea will be abandoned.
