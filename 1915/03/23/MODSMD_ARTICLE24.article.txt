# EASTERN EIGHTS MAY BE INVITED TO THE COAST
## WINNING EIGHTS WILL MEET IN BIG REGATTA Event Will Be Conducted by Exposition Officials Who Will Defray All Expenses.

Pacific Coast crew men may have
an opportunity to compete with the
leading eights of the east of the
Rockies territory in the latter part of
June. The Exposition sub-finance
committee on rowing has advised that
$5400 be expended to bring the win
ner of the Harvard-Yale-Princeton
race, and the crews taking the first
two places on the Poughkeepsie
course, to the Coast to compete with
the Westerners.
It will be necessary for the general
finance committee to take action on
the .report of the sub-committee before
any money will be available for this
purpose, and what sort of a reception
the suggestion will be given by that
body cannot be foretold. There is no
doubt but that the advice of the
finance committee on rowing will
have great weight.
If the regatta is favored and the
eastern winners consent to make the
trip, the result will be that the fastest
crews of the East will line up in Oak
land Estuary against the eights of
Stanford, California and Washington.
It is almost certain that the northern
university will enter a crew, for the
original suggestion for bringing out
the Eastern crews came from Wash
ington, though the plans outlined
were along different lines.
It is impossible to predict the win
ner of the triangular Harvard-Yale-
Pr'nceton race, but it seems probable
that the first eight in that race and
the crews from Cornell and Syracuse,
Columbia or Wisconsin will be
brought out by the Exposition officials.
