# IRISH MARATHON WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE LATEST FEATURE RACES
## Sack, Siamese and Obstacle Contests Add Zest to Saturday Morning's Program. 
### 
The three feature races which will
be held on the Stanford Oval by the
Quadrangle Club Saturday morning in
conjunction with the Irish Marathon
have been devised and recommended
by Danny Carroll, '16, according to
the most improved fashion in vogue
in Australia. A 75 yard sack race, a
Siamese Race of 75 yards, and a 300
yard Obstacle race are listed on the
program of events.
The procedure to be followed in the
sack race is very interesting. The
competitors will be required to lie on
the ground in sacks, with their heels
on the starting line, until the crack
of the pistol.
To get the right effect in the Sai
mese or Three-legged event, the run
ners will be tied together with two
bandages, one around the ankles and
the other around the knees. The ob
stacles to be met in the third race are
as follows: tarpaulin, at 50 yards;
ladder rungs, at 100 yards; suspend
ed bags, 150 yards; suspended apples,
200 yards; one leg hop, to 250 yard
mark where barrels will be placed;
then run to finishing line.
The conditions of the race are so
worded that competitors must pass un
derneath the tarpaulin, and through
a space between two ladder rungs.
They shall then pass through a sus
pended bag. and take a bite from a
suspended apple without using the
hands. The next 50 yards will be
hopped to a line of barrels (the hop
ping to be performed over the en
tire 50 yards on one and the same
fcot). After crawling through the bar
rels, the competitors will race to the
finishing line.
Candidates for the contests are
asked to register at once with O. H.
Castle, *14.
