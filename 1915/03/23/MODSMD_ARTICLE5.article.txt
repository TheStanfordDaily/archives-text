# FORMER STUDENTS WILL FEATURE HISTORICAL PAGEANT PLAT ALUMNI DAT
## REUNION SET FOR MAY 15 Athletics, Stunts, a Luncheon and a Concluding Reception by Senior Class Will Fill Holiday

Literary lights among the Stanford
alnmni are working on the various
skits composing "23'', the great His
torical Pageant-Masque and Mystery
play which is scheduled for the boards
on May 15, Alumni Day. Already
most of the writers appealed to have
submitted the general outlines of their
compositions, each of which deals with
some distinct topic of Stanford history
in a burlesque way.
The play will be presented upon
the Stanford estate, although the ex
act outdoor setting has not been chos
en. The name of the pageant indi
cates the number of years which have
elapsed since the graduation of the
class of 1592, and the compound farce
and burlesque will illustrate vividly
the trials and tribulations of the stu
dent body through a score of years in
its endeavor to reach a state of perfec
tion.
Among the collaborators in this ro
mantic treatment of the development
of Stanford tiaditions, ideals, and
ideas, may be mentioned Chancellor
David Starr Jordan. President John
Casper Branner, Professor V. L. Kel
log, Kansas, '89, of the Entomology de
partment, C. K. Field, "Sunset" editor
and a member of the pioneer class of
'95, Associate Professor L. E. Pas
sett. '01, of the English department,
Miss Alice Windsor Kimball, perma
nent class secretary of '04, instructor
i
Edith Ronald Mirrielees, '07 of the
English department, J. C. Ray, '07, My
ron Stearns. 'OG, and Miss Sarah Mor
rison, '02.
The morning's program includes a
ball game between the Faculty and
the alumni. The alumni nine will be
chosen from the various Senior teams
which have opposed the Faculty in
former years and will appear in the
burlesque costumes which were worn
n those games.
An attractive looking aggregation of
ballet girls. Chinamen, Teddy Pears,
and Mermaids, should result from the
proposed line-up. The contest will be
followed by the Alumni lunch at 12:30
at the old Stanford residence.
After the burlesque in the afternoon
the alumni will proceed to the club
houses, and will plant ivy and ever
green trees around the buildings. At
5:30, the class dinners w'.ll furnish
refreshment for the merrymakers, and
these will give place to departmental
reunions an hour later.
The day's program will be concluded
with the reception held for the Alumni
by the members of the Senior class.
This function will probably talc place
in the Stanford Union.
