### 
Friday afternoon will see the com
bined aggregation of track stars from
the colleges oI Pomona and Occident
al in competition with the Stanford
varsity squad. Owing to the rulings
in vogue in the southern colleges,
Stanford will not enter any members
of the Freshman class in the var
sity heats. The imputation of the
teams from both the colleges is ex
ceptionally strong, and the Cardinal
runners will be forced to record times
in orde.r to take first place honors
in the contest.

probably send up a relay team of
Freshmen to compete with a first year
team from the Stanford squad. Man

tional contingent to take part in a
regular program of events. In case
that the Santa Clara manager agrees
to this plan, the Freshmen competi
tions will begin at 2 o'clock.
It has been the desire of the Mission
ites to make the meet with the Stan
ford Freshmen the Big Meet of the
year, and to grant numerals to the
wearers of the Red who place in the
various events. In the event that the
Santa Clara authorities refuse to send

will suggest Monday, April 5, as a
last possibility for the meet.
