# JUNIOR OPERA STARS ON EDGE TO TAKE THE LIMELIGHT TOMORROW
## Every Possible Indication Points to a Successful Staging of 1916's Production of Music Dancing, Mirth and Beauty CAST SHOWS REAL TRAINING 
### 
If the attendance at the final dress
rehearsal of "At the Dragon's Eye"
last night is indicative in even the
minutest degree of the numbers that
will witness the performance of the
19HI Junior Opera tomorrow even
ing, it is needless to say that it will
be impossible to stage a free-for-all
rush for better accomodations when
the curtain rises on the prologue.
Taking the enthusiasm of the usual
can't- come-tomorrow-let-me-come-to
day audience that was present last
night as an omen for the success of
the opera, it is needless to say that
"At the Dragon's Eye" will go down
upon the books of college operatic
productions as a step almost on a par
with Columbus' well known discovery
of America.
Gauging the success of a perfor
mance by the manner in which the fin
al dress rehearsal was staged is a
dangerous undertaking, Inasmuch as
it is always possible to say either:
"The rehearsal was a poor one—that
means a good show," or: "The re
hearsal was great—the show should
be a wonder." Last night's final pre
liminary was good in the sense that
it brought to light the weakness that
must come out before tomorrow even
ing. and at the same time indicated
what portions of the opera would
not fail to make lasting impressions
upon the audience.
Osaki, high priest of Buddha (J.
11. Wiggins, '10) will officiate at the
laying of the opera's cornerstone of
success—the prologue, which will
leava the audience in the right mental
state for the rise of the curtain. If
perchance the Japanese priest should
send a cloud of ncense over the
heads of the assembly, it will be in
cense from the God of Happiness, for
it is that little deity who will finally
guide the .fortunes of the characters
of "At the Dragon's Eye".
The entrance of Hope Hathaway of
Boston (Miss Esther Liversidge, '17)
is as impress've a bit of staging as has
been seen in a Stanford platform. The
part of Hope Hathaway who is in ev
ery sense of the word a lovable young |
lady, is a difficult one to carry, but J
Miss Liversidge gets away with it in 1
a manner that would make Miss Sarah
Bernhardt murmur, "Take me back [
to that dear Paree!" Miss Liver-|
s'dt;e makes her part fit like the fin- |
est glove, and with aid of a chorus I
of Quaker maids and others carries |
to success what in common language \
is a wonderful scene.
.1. A. Gibb, 'If), enters for his share j
of the limelight at the right moment
to start the plot rolling, and illus
trates his ability to masterfully car
ry the trying character part of the
Japanese proprietor of the Dragon's
Eye Tea House.
Miss Alice Butcher, '16, who will
be seen as an exceedingly modern
young lady, together with B. M. Mel
vin, '17 cleverly leads a stage full of
people through a set of well-arranged
antics to the tune of "That .Japanese
Rag", a "can't-sit-still-when-you-play
it" one-step.
