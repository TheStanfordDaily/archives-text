# IRISH MARATHON IS READY FOR STAGING
## Freak Events in Charge of Quadrangle Club Will Start Saturday at 10 O'clock. 
### 
Plans for the Irish Marathon and
the feature races which are to be held
in conjunction with it are fully com
awaiting for Saturday, March 27 to
start events. At ten o'clock sharp,
the entire array of Junior Week
Queeners and Junior Week Loafers
will convene on the track bleachers,
to watch the efforts of Debaters and
football men who try to get around
the oval under :50 flat.
The 7.") yard sack race and the three
legged contest over a like distance will
serve as genial appetizers for the
great laugh producer of the day—the
300 yard obstacle .race. Stanford's
foremost apple pie eaters and fire
side politicians will enter this event,
and race neck and neck for the cov
eted honor of first place. Merchan
dise orders on Wideman's for the
amount of $2.50 will be awarded to
the winners of the three races.
The Marathon, of course, will pro
vide the chief interest of the day. So
far, several of the classes have not
responded well to the call for runners,
and to make the affair a success it
is again urged that every one who
has ever run for a car or to an 8:15
get hold of some kind of suit.
Gold and silver medals will be pre
sented to the Varsity men who run the
first and second fastest laps, and like
awards will be given to the novice
runners placing first and second.
The holdovers have divided into
squads, each one of which is work
ing up a skit, and something very like
a circus is in store for the track fans
who surrender the dainty quarter in
order to reach the bleachers.
Entries in the feature races are urg
ed to report to Ot's Castle immeditely.
And what's more, the Band will
play.
