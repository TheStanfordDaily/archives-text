# Shift Appears in California Nine At Close of Practice Season. Gianelli Unable to Play in First Contest
## 
### 
This spring Jimmie Sehaeffer has
experienced the hardest task of his
career in selecting the nine to re
present California in the annual in
tercollegiate baseball series. Even
today's announcement is subject to
eleventh hour changes by the silent
blue and gold team's coach.
Rudy Gianelli, who has held down
third base in great style fo,r the en
tire season, was removed last Fri
day to the Infirmary with a bad case
of blood poisoning in his right foot.
This will keep him out of the first
game, and necessitate further changes
in the already much shaken up Cal
ifornia infield.
Captain Dodson, after an unsuccess
ful attempt to play short stop, ha
returned to his original position at
first, bass. Hayes is assured of be
ing custodian of the second sack.
Young, heavy hitting right-fielder,
has been moved into the infield, now
occupying short-stop. The position of
third base is being sought by two
men, Montgomery and Clark, the lat
ter having the edge on the berth.
There still remains a chance, how
ever, that Clark will cover the short
patch. and Montgomery the difficult
I corner.
The outfield, reading from left to
| right, will be composed of two vet
] erans. O'Hara and Adair, and the
Freshman Rohrer. If a further
change is made in the infield, Young
will resume his old place in right
field.
The hottest, fight in the blue and
gold line-up has centered in the bat
teries. Five twirlers and three catch
ers have been carried on the team
roll all season. Dodge, McMillan,
Gefkin, Street, and Dimock are pos
sibilities as pitchers, while Glenney,
Sebastian and Edwards are all in line
I for back-stop berths.
Dodge and his battery mate Glen
ney undoubtedly shade all other as
pirants for the pos ; tions. There i
almost an even chance, however, thai,
j McMillan, star south-paw, and t.'-ans
! fer from Oregon, with Sebastian
catcher on last year's varsity will br
announced as the California battery.
