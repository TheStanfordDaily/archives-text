## 
### 
This afternoon prior to the Santa
Clara game, after a long hard season
of twelve weeks duration, the team
that w'll represent the Cardinal in
the annual inter-varsity baseball clas
sic with California was announced.
Few surprises were sprung by Coach
Billy Orr.
For over a month five of the in
field positions on the nine, excluding
pitcher, have pract'cally been certain
ties. As to who will be on the firing
line for Stanford, and fill the three
contested outfield berths, hss been the
subject of much argument among the
local fans.
The choice of the Varsity twirler for
Saturday's battle has not been made
[ public by those at the helm of thr
j team, and will not be known to the
rooters until the umpire yells "The
batteries for Stanford arc —". A
