played together for the entire season,
consisting of Commandant Workman
first base; Stafford second base; Ste
vens short-stop and McCloskey third
base, will trot out onto the field to
assume their accustomed positions.
Places in the outer garden have
caused the most worry to Billy Orr.
Day is booked to play left, Austin,
center, and Downing right field. The
most contested position was that of
right field, there being a tri-cornered
fight between Noonan, Downing and
O'Neill. It is possible that Downing
and Noonan will share honors Sat
urday, each playing half the game.
In case substitutes are needed in
the infield, Austin will he brought in
to occupy second, and Stafford will
play either short-stop or third base
as the emergency demands. Should
Captain Workman he forced to leave
the game, Hayes will cover the ini
tial station. Lander is slated to sub
Dent, while O'Neill is extra man in
the outfield. Wickersham and Howe,
are third and fourth relief pitchers.
