# "Back to Simple Dances."
## 
### 
"Back to the old-style dances" is
the slogan of students of the Univer
sity of Illinois, a large number of
whom have signed a petition demand
ing more of the waltz and two-step.
The reason for the change back is
that few people are able to enjoy and
participate in the modern forms of
the terpsichorean art.
