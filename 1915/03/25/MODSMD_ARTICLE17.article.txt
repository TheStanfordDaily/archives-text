# STANFORD QUEENERS AND OTHERS GATHER AT LAKE LAGUNITA
## Large Crowd Witnesses Opening Festivities of Junior Week Last Evening. 
### 
All of Stanford that's queening and
most that's not must have been at the
lake last night, from the size of the
crowd that gathered on the banks to
watch the fireworks and hear the
music.
The band, the glee club and the
mandolin club alternated in the pro
gram of the concert. While the il
luminations played over head and re
flected on the surface of the lake
strains of music were heard from the
band and the melodious notes of the
mandolinists and singers floated out
over Lagnnita. All three organiza
tions seemed to be contesting for
chances to outdo the others in gener
osity, so numerous were the numbers
they offered.
The fireworks were set off from the
side of the lake opposite the boat
house and shot out above the heads of
the spectators. The skyrockets which
refused to shoot straight but took
their courses in an undulatory motion,
finally exploding near the surface of
the lake, were surprises and added to
the attractiveness of the display. On
the lake's west bank was a big "1916"
which shed its red and green light
over the surface.
All the canoes were pressed into
service last night and many of the
fairy gliding craft took their course
through the waters. From one of
these which went back and forth
gleamed Roman candles, and in the
darkness their source seemed to be
the waters of the lake.
