# CLASS OF '99 TO BE HOST ON SATURDAY
## Will Give Informal Feed and Program for Men on Campus After Game With California. 
### 
The class of '99 is rapidly complet
ing plans for an informal spread to
be given in the Union for the faculty,
alumni and undergraduates, after the
baseball game with California next
Saturday. All the men on the cam
pus at that time are cordially invited
to lie present and join in the general
jolly-up which will follow. Those
who are unable to attend the affair,
which will begin at 6:30, are welcome
to come later to enjoy the program
which is being arranged for the oc
casion.
The idea of a reunion of this kind
originated with T. T. C. Gregory, '99,
and was proposed by him in answer
to a toast at the recent Founders'
Day dinner. It was first intended to
be given in honor of Ralph Arnold,
newly appointed trustee and president
of the class of '99 in its last semester.
Arnold, however, is leaving for the
Last immediately after the meeting
of the Board of Trustees tomorrow
evening, and will be unable to be
present. Notwithstanding this fact, it
has been decided to stage the affair
as an aftermath to the baseball game.
The Board of Trustees is expected
to be well represented in spite of Ar
nold's absence, and Gregory is scour
ing San Francis.ro for any loose alum
ni, so that a representative crowd
will in all probability be present.
A program of special merit is being
arranged by ,T. E. McDowell and E.
W. Smith, both members of the class
of '99. Dr. H. R. Stolz has offered
his services to secure some numbers
of an athletic character, and a box
ing match will in all probability be
staged, as well as a gymnastic stunt
of some kind. A good feed is prom
ised by the hosts, and no pains are
being spared to give all a good time.
No one will be required to part with
any coin but the members of '99. The
program will begin about 7:30.
