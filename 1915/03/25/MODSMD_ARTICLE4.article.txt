After two months of hard practico
thirty-six starters are awaiting the
word "go" in the race for popular
favor which will he run on the stage
of the assembly hall tonight. Thirty
six men and women—the principals
and choruses of "At the Dragon's
Eye", are keyed up to the second,
wait'ng to apply make-up and don
costumes to appear in an opera that
for real dramatic value and resem
blance to professional efforts leads
all other Stanford musical produc
tions.
The 191G Opera is a fitting and pro
per send-off for the period known as
Spendthrift Week, "At the Dragon's
Eye" being a happy conglomeration of
dancing, singing, beauty, and love.
The plot needs no explanation. In
stead of the usual coni c opera slender
thread it is a strong chain, each link
of which unwinds itself at the pro
per moment, and finally conies to a
close with everybody, except the vil
lain, of course, living happily ever
after.
Little can be said about the cos
tumes—one glance of the eye can con
vey a more beaut'ful picture than a
dozen written rhapsodies.
If those who are not going tonight
have tears, they had best prepare to
shed them now, fo,r "At the Dragon's
Eye" is really an elixir of youth and
happiness, the kind of performance
that makes one want to be up and in
it all. instead of just a minute part
of the common herd.
