# BASEBALL FANS PRESAGE CLOSE FIGHT IN FIRST INTERCOLLEGIATE GAME
## 
### 
With the announcement of the Stan •
ford Varsity and conclusion of the pre
liminary practice season yesterday af
ternoon, a catching baseball atmos
phere is at present permeating all ov
er the campus. The comparative mer
its of the two teams and chances for
a Card nal victory are now the chief
subjects for fireside controversy of ev
ery loyal fan.
As to who will emerge on the long
end of Saturday's score is a question
solved only with great difficulty. In
general, however, it is agreed that the
final result depends upon three facts.
California is granted more than an
even chnnce, should her erratic pitch
ers perform up to standard and her

lately shaken up
infield refuse to
make some of
their customary
bobbles. Third
base, short-stop
and pitcher
loom up as the
blue and gold
weakspots. On
the other hand
Stanford is rat
ed as a likely
winners, should
her batters con
nect in proper
fashion. Of
late, the team
has been aver
aging eight hits
to the game but
whether they
can continue
at this gait is

an open icsuc. At any rate, it is an
assured i' n t nat Saturday's game will
be nc: v"!!* - -a*way for eithe.r nine.
Captain ;i nmie Dodson, who wit
nessed y torday's defeat at the hands
of Santa Clara, gave out the following
when asked for a statement:
"At'kr M-cMig Stanford play today
for tlie first iiine. 1 feel that California
is iii* a* ai' si -i tough proposition. If
we whv • 'I! be lucky. Should our
pitchers held out, we'll have an even
break. .HeJlillin will probably start,
although I'm not sure. Our team hits
a little stronger than jours, and that
may be a deciding factor."
Tom Wr-k ran. 1 eider of the Car
dinal nine, expressed h's confidence
in the aggregation that will represent
Stanford. He said:
"The to-mi v i-h tie able coaching of
Hilly Orr has shown itself capable in
all department* <»•' the game. It will
tro into tl'e field Saturday determined
to hit, and t<> she its best, —and that
best will win."
A short bio graphical fkctch of each
of the team members and substitutes
is given in the following columns.
Walter Joseph Stafford.
WobLles Slaffivd. ur.c:cu';:edly one
of the most valuable men on the

team, wi'l I< ck the i. field together
at his position on second base. He

is a veteran, having filled the same
place last year against California. His
all-around knowledge of the game, and
ability to play it, have made his pre
sence essential to the nine.
Of late he has been connecting for
hits, when the bases are occupied.
Zeta Psi is his fraternity, while San
Franc'sco is his home. Stafford ma
jors in Pre-legal.
Allan Sidney Hayes.
Doc Hayes, who made a name for
himself last year when he held Cal-

ifornia at his
mercy in the last
game of the se
ries, is one of the
two choices for
pitcher Saturday.
Hi s improve
ment in the past
two seasons has
been rapid. Hayes
has perfect con
trol, fields his po
sition in faultless
style, and keeps
the base-runners
close to the bas
es. His experi
ence and cool
head are two of
his best assets.

Hayes' fraternity is Zeta Psi, his
major Geology, and he hails from
Pasadena.
Tliomns Kdiriir Workman.
Tom Workman, the liard hitting
and game leader of the Stanford Var
sity, will hold down first base for
the third successive year, when he
will oppose Dodson of California in
the same position in the twenty-fourth
intercollegiate baseball series. The
Cardinal captain meets the ball right
on the seam, and as a result ranks with
the three leading hitters on the team.
Only five errors have been chalked
up in his fielding column during tho
entire season. Workman hails from
Los Angeles, and bis major is History.
He is a member of Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity.
Paul Norton .MoClosKey.
A two year veteran. Pete McC'ioskey
will enter his third intercollegiate ser
ies Saturday against California at bis
position on third base. This stev-

ling ball-play
er has the fac
ulty of whip
ping the sphere
across the dia
mond in time to
catch the base
runner, after
stopping a dif
ficult chance.
In previous sea
sons his only
weakness hag
been at tha bat,
but his average
this year looks
good. McC'o -
key claims Del
ta Kappa Epsi
lon as his fra
ternity, major 5
in Law, and

liails from Salada Beach.
Leslie Ferilhmml Dent,
The old reliable, Babe Dent, two
season veteran, s again bcoked to
perform back-stopping duty. Although
seemingly awkward at the plate, he
rarely fails to bring back results
that count. The easy slow swing of
his bat has scored manv runs for
Stanford. On accour* of his slugging
ability he has been asrsignc' 'lie clean
up position in the batting order. Drmt's
bee-l'ne peg down to second, to catch
a base-runner is a delight to the fans.
He claims Economics as his major
study, and Is a member of Bi>t:i Theta
Pi fraternity. Berkeley is his home.


Ha he Dent.



Donald Mcl.ain Day.
Don Day, who held down center
j field 011 the Va.vsity all last season,
I is this spring booked to occupy the
J left garden. There is not a more heau
! tiful fielder in the outfield, than Day.
■ Whenever a fly is knocked in his di
! rection a put-out is a surety. Day
| leads in the number of sacrifice hits,
J and may be depended upon to bunt
when the occasion demands. I lis bat
ting: average is consistently fair.
Day belongs to Cardinal Club, majors
in Civil Engineering, and ha'ls from
Long Beach.
August Joseph Hoever
The twirler who has seen the hard
est service on the Stanford squad this
season is Gus Hoever, and this husky
heaver is being primed to share the
pitching honors with Hayes in the
intercollegiate series. The weight of
Hoever, the heaviest man 011 the team,
is a great help to him. His chief as
set is remarkable speed, which daz
zles the opposing batters. Besides ho
works his spitter to great advantage.
Hoeve.r claims Civil Engineering as
his major, and is a member of Theta
Delta Chi fraternity. He hails from
Willows.
Charles Alphiii Austin
A football star turned into a star
centerfielder, will aptly describe
Charley Austin's situation. Earlier
in the season be was given a trial
at second base, but finally was as
signed to his natural place in center.
As a hitter, be ranks equally among
the three most dangerous swatsmiths
on the Varsity. Furthermore, Aus
tin is close to the top in number of
stolen bases. He belongs to Theta
Delta Chi. majors in Civil Engineer
ing and lives in Berkeley. •
Russell Forrest Downing.
Russ Downing, who has won a place
in the hearts of the fans by his con
sistent hitting and rifle-like peg, is a
newcomer in the ranks of Stanford
baseball, being slated to hold down
the right field berth. It is only dur
ing the last week, that the tall fly
chaser has cinched the position. Down
ing is a natural hitter, connecting for
numerous extra base drives. That
not a single error has been charged
up to him all season, speaks in it
self for his fielding. Downing majors
in Law, is a member of Encina club,
and resides in Los Gatos.
Rlaine Lawrence Stevens.
Mush Stevens, who this year is fill
ing the place vacated by former Cap
tain Terry at short-stop, is the only
new face in the veteran infield. Last
season he was utility infielder on the
Varsity, but during the past three
months has exhibited such great im
provement as to warrant his promo
tion to a regular berth. Stevens is a
mainstay to the club as regards field
ing, cutting down many hard chances.
Palo Alto is his home, while he claims
Entomology as his major.
