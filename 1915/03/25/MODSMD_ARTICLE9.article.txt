# WITH THE TEAM
## 
### 
The line-up was announced yester
day for the Stanford team which is
to meet California in the first game
of the Intercollegiate baseball series
on Saturday. It is a strong combina
tion of hard working players. The
nine which will represent Stanford
has been determined only after a
careful selection and a long period
of work-outs, extending over many
weeks. It is a combination that is
playing for the love of the sport. The
team will be in a position to give a
good account of itself, but much de
pends upon the spirit of encourage
ment back of the players as to
whether they win or lose. This en
couragement must emanate from the
fans in the bleachers. Let the en
thusiasm overflow during every in
ning; not the muckraking, jeering
type directed at the opposing team,
but the sportsmanlike pep which is
genuine, the kind that shows that you
are with the nine, win or lose.
