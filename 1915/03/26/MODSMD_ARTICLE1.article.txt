# "FEG" MURRAY STARS AS STANFORD WINS 86 TO 30
## "1916" Scores With Opera "AT THE DRAGON'S EYE" UNIQUE PRODUCTION First Production Without Paid Coach Proves That Student Directors Are Capable of Upholding the Dramatic Standard 
### 
Sensible high class drama? light I
melodramatic romance, and lowbrow
comedy, neatly and skilfully inter
woven, made up the event of events
for this season's Junior Week, namely,
the Junior Opera of the Class 'IG.
"At the Dragon's Eye", by M. P.
Detels, '15, W. G. Paul, '15, and A. J.
Mclnerny, '16, scored its hits before
a house almost packed. That the
opera was appreciated is assured by
the enthusiastic reception accorded
it by an audience that came to criti
cise as well as enjoy.
In spite of the fact that this is the
first opera entirely managed and
coached by students, old timers com
pared it more than favorably with any
other that has been presented. The
speed with which the scenes moved
along, and the snap and life present
throughout the opera bespeaks the
high standard set for dramatic vvo.rk
by Stanford organizations. The entire
presentation itself is graphic evidence
of the energy and ability of W. B.
Forbes, '15, coach, and J. R. Morgan,
'16, manager.
The plots of "At the Dragon's Eye"
were weak and somewhat inconsist
ent. but the audience was fooled into
taking little notice of this feature by
the music and clever song hits, which
did much to raise the opera to a
more than amateur standard. Fur
thermore, no one objected to being
fooled, so delightfully was it done.
The setting of the scene of "At the
Dragon's Eye" near the Japanese tea
booth of the Exposition proved par
ticularly appropriate at this time.
Scenic effects were both original and
pleasing.
The managers of the opera wisely
chose small choruses, in spite of the
fact that not eve.ry house was repre
sented. In doing so they were able to
execute better dances and better
scenes, and if there were a lack of
quality any where, it was made up by
generosity in encores. Pretty .Tanan
ese tea maids demonstrated that they
were better dancers than the Amer
ican beauties, and placed themselves
in class with the quaint Quaker girls.
Undoubtedly, the star of the perfor
mance was Cherry San, Trma Ray
burn, '16, the petite Japanese damsel
of the tea garden. To the surprise
of many, the expressive and grace
ful acting of Cherry San tended to
outshine the leading feminine role of
Hope Hathaway, who was forced to
rely on her dancing to car.ry through
the difficult role of a would-be mis
sionary to tho heathen Japanese, some
times serious, sometimes fickle. The
dancing of tlm missionary maid, Esther
Liversidge, '17, was unique and charm
ing.
The star male character was not
Ted Edgerlv, W. C. Paeon, '14, leading
rolo. but was contested by Tano, Jap
anese manager of the Dragon's Eye
Tea. Garden, J. A. Gibb, '15, and Al
exander Hercules Achilles Jones. Ex
position guide and sleuth, W. G. Paul,
'15.
Actual comparison of these two
characters is almost impossible, as
Gibb carefully worked out a portray
al of a difficult role, while Paul's slap
stick, rapid fire comedy never failed
to register.
Miss Matilda Jones of Boston, Nora
Parker, '15, never at any time relin
quished her rigid, New England -re
spect for convention and was
capable of summoning an icy dignity
which brooked no contradiction.
Cymbaline Snodgrass, Jacqueline
Wood,. '15, while perhaps overdoing
her role, in a few instances, secured
a good laugh. Harriet of the Herald,
Alice Butcher, '16, proved herself a
versatile coquette as well as an indus
trious seeker of news. The one strong
point in the character of Mercer Page,
B. M. Melvin, '17, came from song
hits that made good.
Variety added spioe to the opera
as a whole, and every scene of it
from "Moonlight on the Cotton Fields"
with pickaninnies for a background,
to "queening" under the Campus
Moon" on the Quad proved interest
ing, lively, and well worked out. In
other words, the Class of '16 scored
a success.
Ozaki, High Priest Of Buddha, J.
H. Wiggins, *10, was dignified and
cruel, and the quality of acting behind
this character can be compared to that
of Ted Edgerly, leading male role, W.
C. Bacon, '14.
Both were pleasing but not stellar
in their portrayals.

Variety added spioe to the opera
as a whole, and every scene of it
from "Moonlight on the Cotton Fields"
with pickaninnies for a background,

a success.
Ozaki, High Priest Of Buddha, J.
H. Wiggins, *10, was dignified and
cruel, and the quality of acting behind
this character can be compared to that
of Ted Edgerly, leading male role, W.

Both were pleasing but not stellar
in their portrayals.
Sensible high class drama? light I
melodramatic romance, and lowbrow

the Junior Opera of the Class 'IG.
"At the Dragon's Eye", by M. P.
Detels, '15, W. G. Paul, '15, and A. J.
Mclnerny, '16, scored its hits before
a house almost packed. That the
opera was appreciated is assured by
the enthusiastic reception accorded
it by an audience that came to criti
cise as well as enjoy.
In spite of the fact that this is the
first opera entirely managed and
coached by students, old timers com
pared it more than favorably with any
other that has been presented. The
speed with which the scenes moved
along, and the snap and life present
throughout the opera bespeaks the
high standard set for dramatic vvo.rk
by Stanford organizations. The entire
presentation itself is graphic evidence
of the energy and ability of W. B.
Forbes, '15, coach, and J. R. Morgan,
'16, manager.
The plots of "At the Dragon's Eye"
were weak and somewhat inconsist
ent. but the audience was fooled into
taking little notice of this feature by
the music and clever song hits, which
did much to raise the opera to a
more than amateur standard. Fur
thermore, no one objected to being
fooled, so delightfully was it done.
The setting of the scene of "At the
Dragon's Eye" near the Japanese tea
booth of the Exposition proved par
ticularly appropriate at this time.
Scenic effects were both original and
pleasing.
The managers of the opera wisely
chose small choruses, in spite of the
fact that not eve.ry house was repre
sented. In doing so they were able to
execute better dances and better
scenes, and if there were a lack of
quality any where, it was made up by
generosity in encores. Pretty .Tanan
ese tea maids demonstrated that they
were better dancers than the Amer
ican beauties, and placed themselves
in class with the quaint Quaker girls.
Undoubtedly, the star of the perfor
mance was Cherry San, Trma Ray
burn, '16, the petite Japanese damsel
of the tea garden. To the surprise
of many, the expressive and grace
ful acting of Cherry San tended to
outshine the leading feminine role of
Hope Hathaway, who was forced to
rely on her dancing to car.ry through
the difficult role of a would-be mis
sionary to tho heathen Japanese, some
times serious, sometimes fickle. The
dancing of tlm missionary maid, Esther
Liversidge, '17, was unique and charm
ing.
The star male character was not
Ted Edgerlv, W. C. Paeon, '14, leading
rolo. but was contested by Tano, Jap
anese manager of the Dragon's Eye
Tea. Garden, J. A. Gibb, '15, and Al
exander Hercules Achilles Jones. Ex
position guide and sleuth, W. G. Paul,
'15.
Actual comparison of these two
characters is almost impossible, as
Gibb carefully worked out a portray
al of a difficult role, while Paul's slap
stick, rapid fire comedy never failed
to register.
Miss Matilda Jones of Boston, Nora
Parker, '15, never at any time relin
quished her rigid, New England -re
spect for convention and was
capable of summoning an icy dignity
which brooked no contradiction.
Cymbaline Snodgrass, Jacqueline
Wood,. '15, while perhaps overdoing
her role, in a few instances, secured
a good laugh. Harriet of the Herald,
Alice Butcher, '16, proved herself a
versatile coquette as well as an indus
trious seeker of news. The one strong
point in the character of Mercer Page,
B. M. Melvin, '17, came from song
hits that made good.
