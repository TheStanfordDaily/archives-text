# HERE'S TO THE JUNIORS
## 
### 
To the Freshman, Junior Week with
its festive celebrations and jollities,
seems synonymous with the whole
Junior year, for of the four college
years spanning the great chasm be
tween the skull-cap and the som
brero, the third appears to the Fresh
men the most attractive. Ask any
of the alumni which period of lifei in
the University they enjoyed most, and
invariably the answer will be, "My
Freshman year." But, while a mem
ber of the infant class can make no
such comparison, it is hard for him
to appreciate enjoyment from the
graduate's angle. Few Freshmen
look forward to filling the shoes of
the Sophomores. His first year he
is interesting because he has possibili
ties. By the second year everybody
has found him out. The only advan
tage of being a Sophomore seems to
bo that he will no longer be a Fresh
man. Certainly it will be grand to be
Seniors, only there are the staggering
burdens of dignity and responsibility
to be borne, and the constant example
to be set. And graduation, which
must be the greatest moment of
achievement and happiness while at
the University, is overshadowed by the
thought of leaving Stanford, But i
with the Junior year come many
blessings and apparently no regrets.
At last after two years of listening
and absorbing, one may participate ac
tively in University affairs; has op
portunity to hear that most delight
ful music—one's own voice—in the
shaping of student policies, may back
his opinion with a vote; and lastly
receives the right to don the coveted
homely corduroys.
The class of 1918 joins in the cele
bration this week in honor of the
class of 1916, wishes the guardians of
the Freshmen, honor, happiness, and
success, —and looks forward with
keen anticipation to another Junior
Week two years hence.
