The second informal get-together
of the first year class is being plan
ned for Wednesday, April 14. Plans
so far include a hay-ride, with all the
wagons leaving promptly at 4:45 in
order that everyone may be home
early as there will be instruction the
day following, "eats" and a general
good time. It is hoped that all fresh
men will plan to be present as it will
lie the last chance to get together
this semester.
