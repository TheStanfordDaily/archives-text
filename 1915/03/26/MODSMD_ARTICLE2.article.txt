# CARDINALS AND BEAR AWAIT DIAMOND BATTLE TOMORROW
## Even Break, Say Fans, on Opening Game of Series 
### 
Two Varsities, their coaches, con
11;. 'lit and important bat boys, and
iegions of rival fans, await impa
tiently the "Play ball, batter up,"
of Umpire (leorge Hildebrand,
which will start the twenty-fourth
annual baseball series between
S'•: ford and the University of
California. All is in readiness.
S .-;:e McDonald has given the
va -'ity diamo.id the most careful

grooming in its history. The band
lias rehearsed several new triumphal
airs, and one funeral march, and the
weather man lias been asked to please
be reasonable just one more day.
Dopesters are trying to figure out
which team will win the first game,
but ball teams have a rare faculty
for upsetting predictions as was well
illustrated in the last World's Series.
However, from the performance of
each nine so far this season this
much is evident: the nine ana Gold
diamond warriors have an edge on the
offensive, as they have been a trifle
more accurate with the willow and
have had greater success at pilfering
bases than the Stanford nine. On the
other hand, the Cardinal Varsity ap
pears the strongest on the defense.
Coach Hilly Orr's proteges have had
only one fielding slump this season,
and that when Stafford was out of
the game. The infield quartet. Work
man, Stafford, Stevens, and McCloa
key, inspire confidence in the hearts
of Stanford fans, while California has
given several very weird performances
in the field. With Gianelli unable to
play bis customary position at third,
and the short stop role still inade
quately filled, it looks as though there
might be a bole in the left side of the
Berkeley crew's defense.
The team will invade the picture
show as guests of the Varsity theater
management tonight, and each man
is trying to forget for the present that




Throe Stanford Itoliahlcs —Upper, lloevor; left, Stafford; right, Austin
Billy Orr will be far from the bench
when the team takes the field tomor
row, but it's a safe bet that the coach
will be hanging around the Salt Lake
City telegraph office waiting for the
message that will be flashed to him
almost before the ninth inning is
over.
Today Captain Workman gave the
Varsity a rest, the only work being a
few rounds of hitting practice.
The game will be called promptly
at three o'clock. Student body tickets
will not be honored, and fifty cents
will be the admission fee.
