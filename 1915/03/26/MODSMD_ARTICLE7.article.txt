# SUPRISES FEATURE CLASS DAY REGATTA
## Skillful Work of Dainty Coxswain resets Dope—Juniors Fail to Fulfill Prophesies. 
### 
Tn spite of thereatening weather a
gay assembly of Junior Week queen
ers, professors, bandmen, swimmers
and campus "roughs" combined to
form the annual out-door climax of
Junior Week. Every shade and color
was amply represented, from the car
dinal of the band uniforms to the
sombre hue of the upper class "cord."
Clipping the corners on the Lagoon
course, and cleverly piloting the shell
in the straightaways, Miss 01-
cese, 'IT), the surprise coxswain of the
Senior Crew, steered the 191 shell to
victory. Johnny Goodman, varsity
coxswain, piloting the Junior craft,
steered a poor race, losing ground and
dropping strokes on the sharper am ies
of the course and due to him, and the
fact, that Green lost an oar through
failure to lock it.the Juniors, who
were picked to win, made the poorest
time and showing of the day.
