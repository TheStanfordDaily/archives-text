By a score of 86 to 30, the Stanford
varsity track squad defeated the com
bined teams of Occidental and Po
mona colleges this afternoon. F. S.
("Peg") Murray, '16, Stanford's pre
mier hurdler, was the star of the
meet, which was run off under diffi
culties owing to a cold rain and the
consequent heavy track. Murray took
the hundred-yard dash in the fastest
time for the century this season, cov
ering the distance in 0:10 1-5. He
also won first place in the low and
high hurdles, making a total of fif
teen points toward the victory.
Captain E. M. Bonnett, '15, took the
honors in the 880-yard, accomplishing
under two minutes against the odds of
the inclement weather.
With P. R. Wilson, '16, dropping
out of the mile at the conclusion of
the third lap, afte.r taking the lead
from Sturgess at the half-mile mark
and leading to the three-quarter dis
tance mark, H. V. Aupperle, '17, was
left to fight it out with the southerner.
Aupperle won by thirteen yards after
a scrappy fin'sh.
The Cardinals swept the*boards in
both huxdles and the 440-yard dash.

and Green of the southern team toed
the mark with Murray, J. K. Norton,
'16. and R. R. Templeton, '15. Norton,

ond to Murray with R. R. Templeton
third, was disqualified for tipping
three hurdles. McClain of the visitors
was awarded the place.
