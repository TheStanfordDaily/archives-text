# WHITEWASH APPLIED BY CALIFORNIANS IN FIRST SERIES GAME
## Splendid Pitching by Dodge, Plus Heavy Hitting, Gives Victory to Blue and Gold in Initial Baseball Contest Held Friday VARSITY NOT UP TO FORM 
### 
11l the first game of the twenty
fourth annual intercollegiate baseball
series held Friday afternoon on the
local diamond, California administer
ed a crushing defeat to the Stanford
Varsity, whitewashing the Cardinals
to the tune of t! to 0. Without pre
senting any alibis, the victory may be
attributed to two factors, Dodge's air
tight pitching and heavy hitting by his
team-mates.
The blue and gold nine played at
the top of its game, fielding almost
faultlessly, and hingling at the most
opportune times. Ten hard wallops
in all were secured from the usually
stingy deliveries of Hayes and Hocver,
the majority of these being bunched
in three innings, the third, fifth and
seventh, liohwer headed the batting
list with three clean singles.
Chip Dodge for California exhibited
the best form he has shown on the
diamond this season. At all times he
was cool and deliberate, making use
of a nice change of pace. A fast ball
and a wide curve that cut the corners
of the plate were his greatest assets.
Only three measly hits were secured
from Dodge, two of these being of the
scratch infield variety.
As for Stanford, there is no ques
tion in the minds of those who have
followed he,r play throughout the sea
son, that the team was considerably
off color. Not only in hitting but in
fielding did the Varsity display poor
form. The five errors chalked up in
the box score, although some of them
were due to unlucky breaks, contrib
uted in 110 small measure toward the
six runs totaled by the visitors.
That the Cardinal fans should take
Friday's contest as a basis for the out
come -of the second game of the series
scheduled for next Saturday, however,
is unwarranted. The defeat should
materially aid the Varsity, allowing
the team to bolster up_ ts weak points
and install a yet greater lighting spirit
into its game. Last year the same sit
uation faced the California nine hav
ing lost the first contest to Stanford,
but yet they were returned final vic
tors. The breaks of the game Friday
were all for California. Desiring to
take 110 just credit from the blue and
gold nine, yet these same breaks were
gold nine, yet these same breaks are
bound to change.
The game started very evenly, for
two innings neither side being able to
score. In the third frame California
broke through the ice scoring two
v runs. One down, Young shot a cork
ing double to left. Dodson flew out
to Day. Adair there-upon produced
the pinch hit that tallied Young, when
he singled to center. Adair moved to
third on Austin's misdirected peg home
and scored a moment later on Stan
ford's fumble of O'Hara's slow bounc
er. Two walks followed, populating
the bases. After delivering two balls
to Hayes of California, Doc Hayes was
relieved by Hoever, who put three
straight strikes over the plate and re
tired the side. The feat gained him
well merited applause from the
bleachers.
The fourth inning was Hoever's un
doing. With one down, Adair hit in
field and took second on Stafford' 3
wild throw to first. O'Hara scored
him with a safe single to left. Roll
wer whanged to right, moving O'Hara
up a notch. When Gianelli was hit by
a pitched ball, the bases were again
loaded. Hayes performed the pinch
hitting act by hitting to center, send
ing both O'Hara and Rohwer acrosa
the plate. The run-fest ended as lloe
ver fanned both Glenny and Dodge.
The final scoring of the day occur*
ed in the seventh. Rohwer knocked
a hot one to center that got away from
Austin and followed the runne.r to
reach third in safety. Gianelli
brought Rohwer home with a long sac
rifice fly to left.
At no time did Stanford even appear
dangerous, only six men managing to
reach first base. Hoever advanced the
farthest when he reached second base
in the third frame on an er.ror and
Austin's walk. Two were out at the
time, however, and nothing came of
the rally.
