son's the place. and all of us are the
ones that are doing to do it.

sweet shop, and every cent of profit
that The Dally Palo Alto can make
from "Sticky's" store will he turned
over to the Stanford Committee in
charge of funds intended to help the
sufferers in Europe.
Ordinarily no one objects to drop
ping in to "St'cky's" for refreshments.
In fact, most of us enjoy it. But
Thursday will he better than ever, for
every patron will be served by the
comely scribes from the Women's
Press Club, who have agreed to give
up their work for the day, and run
"Sticky's" store.
Furthermore, it's not going to cost
us a "jit" more to get our "favorite"
at "Sticky's" on Thursday. Prices
will be the same, and refreshments
will be served a la mode, a la ca.rte,
and la every other way that the mem
bers of the Women's Press Club can
figure out.
Tlvi.rsday evening The Daily Palo
Alto will call at "Sticky's" and collect
the profits of the day and turn them
over to the Campus Committee, which
will forward it to IT. C. Hoever in En*
