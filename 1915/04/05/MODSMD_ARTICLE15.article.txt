# THE 						PSYCHOLOGICAL MOMENT
## 
### 
A handful of rooters from across
the bay, seated in the east bleachers,
showed more enthusiasm than several
hundred Stanford fans at the ball
game on Friday, and, incidentally,
cheered the Blue and Gold team to a
one-sided victory. In the early stages
of the game Stanford rooters were be
hind the Stanford team, but at the
time when encouragement was needed
genuine cheering waned and gradual
ly died out. It is easy enough to back
a winning combination, but the root
ers who count are those who are be
hind the team at the turn in the tide
of the contest. It is that "never-say
die" spirit whirl* wins many a game.
TiOt us back the team from start to
finish in next Saturday's contest and
show the players that the students are
behind them all the time, and espe
cially at the psychological moment.
