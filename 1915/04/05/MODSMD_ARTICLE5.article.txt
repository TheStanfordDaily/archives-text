tion. The other two contests are of

The outlook for a Stanford victory
is auspicious, in as much as California
was forced to start the season with
only one veteran back while the Car
dinals began with four. In addition
to this, Captain Hahn found a wealth
of material in the Freshman class.
Captain Hahn is a veteran of two
seasons, having won his Circle "S"

year.

season when he played with F. S.
Pratt, '13, in the doubles.
The two Freshmen named for the
team have established enviable records
in h'gh school competitions. Johns
was winner of last year's interschol
astic held at Stanford and held the
junio.r championship for the Pacific
Coast. He was rated as the strongest
high school player in the State.
Barber, playing with McCormiclc,
won the interscholastic doubles here
both last year and the previous sea
son. He was also one cf the pair of
