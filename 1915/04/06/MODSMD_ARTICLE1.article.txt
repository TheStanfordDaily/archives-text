# NEW LIBRARY BUILDING WILL BE DEDICATED TO JANE LATHROP STANFORD
## TRUSTEES ADOPT PROPOSAL Act on Suggestion Made by the Students After Removal of the Family Group From Quad 
### 
The proposal to dedicate the new li
brary to Jane Lathrop Stanford was
acted on favorably by the Hoard of
Trustees of the University in a session
during the vacation and a resolution
adopted to allow the new building to
stand as a memorial to the mother of
the University.
At the time of the removal of the
group of the Stanford family from
Memorial Court, the suggestion was
made by a number of students and ai
umni and through the columns of The
Daily Palo Alto that to.ne suitable
memor'al should lie erected to Mrs.
Stanford. Resolutions to this effect
wore adopted by the University Con
ference.
It was pointed out at. that time that
the University stands as a memorial
to Leland Stanford Junior and the
Memorial Church is dedicated to Sen
ator Stanford, but that there is no spe
cific memorial on the campus to Mrs.
Stanford. The Jewel Fund hinds the
Stanford Library especially to the
memory of Mrs. Stanford, so that it is
very appropriate that this building be
dedicated to her.
The pronoFtfl to plac? the Memorial
Group in the main rotunda of the mu
seum was referred to the Grounds
Committee with power to act at the
same time thst the above action was
taken. Tt iÂ«> the intention of the com
