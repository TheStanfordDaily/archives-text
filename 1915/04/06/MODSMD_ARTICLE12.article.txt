# EXPERIENCES
## 
### 
Some of the Seniors at the Univer
sity of Chicago have conceived Ihe
idea of seeing how many untried
things connected with the university
life they can get a taste of before
Commencement Day. It is not an at
tempt to .repair mistakes of early col
lege days. It is too late to repair dam
ages that 1915 men may feel they
have done to scholastic ambitions.
Rather it is an attempt to make ex
cursions into the more or less out-of
the-way features of the University
world, and to investigate things that
are seldom enjoyed by a majority of
the students.
Many students at Stanford graduate
who have never been inside the Mu
seum; some have never attended a
service in the Memorial church;
others have never witnessed a minor
sport contest; many have overlooked
opportunities to meet the biggest men
in the Faculty. Can it be possible?
Some may never have crossed the
threshold of the Library nor have at
tended a class meeting or a class
function.
Fortunately there are many oppor
tunities for excursions out into the
foothills £rom the University as well
as opportunities of delving into Uni
versity experiences near to the Quad.
"The more experiences you have, the
broader is your outlook on life —your
experience." A little more than a
month remains for members of the
class of 1915 to take in some of the
features about this vast estate. Now
or never!
