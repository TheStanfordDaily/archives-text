# RESURRECTED MEMORIAL BELLS NOW IN POSITION
## Chimes, Silent For Nine Years, Soon To Toll Quarter Hour On Quad. 
### 
Once more the old Memorial Chimes
are hoisted into place, and today they
are being hung in the new bell tower
back of the Memorial Church, from
which the'r tones will once mo.re echo
over the Stanford farm.
The chimes include four bells cast
expressly for the purpose of ringing
th 2 hour 011 the Quad. One of them
was cast four times before the right
tone was produced. None of the bells
have .rung since the night of the earth
quake in 1906, du.ring which they were
thrown from a high tower over the
Memorial Church to the pavement of
the inner Quad w'thout being crack
ed. Since that time they have been
hidden in a basement under one of the
University buildings.
.Just how soon the chimes will be
gin ringing regularly is not yet
known, but their tunes will probably
not. be heard until next semester. Then
they will sound every fifteen minutes,
giving the hour in deep tones, and the
quarter in variations, just as the
Westminister chimes rung during
commencement week, but it is not cer
tain that by that time they can be con
nected with the huge clock that will
be putin the tower.
