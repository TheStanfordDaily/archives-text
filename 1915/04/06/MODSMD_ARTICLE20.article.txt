# "ELEPHANT GLIDE" IS ON ITS WAY TO THE FARM
## Kansas Sends all Other Dances to Background—They're Not Modern. 
### 
"It's a long, long way to Palo Alto,"
conies a tune from the University of
Kansas, "but we'll soon be there."
Then its "Goodbye, hesitation, fare
well, old fox trot. It's a long, long
way to Palo Alto, but we'll soon be
there."
In other words, gents, there's a wave
of modern dancing sweeping westward.
It's hit every University from Colum
bia to Kansas, and it's soon due at
Stanford, as the above anthem of the
followers of the animal walk, the tur
tle trot, and the elephant glide shows.
The fox trot and Boston are ancient
history now. We must all learn to
elephant glide. Here's the way they
do it, this dope being from the in
structions given at Kansas.
Hut the animal walk is latest. The
dancer imitates a kangaroo, bending
down and proceeding along on hands
and feet, first hay foot, then hay hand,
then straw foot, and finally straw
hand. It's a very lopsided and awk
ward movement, but, according to the
instructions, "we should worry, be
cause its a new one."
Now the elephant glide is more dif
ficult. The dancers put the feet out
side the hands in traversing the floor.
In the turtle trot the same position is
kept, but the hands are allowed to
fall outside of the feet. None of these
dances are very graceful, but then —
they're modern.
