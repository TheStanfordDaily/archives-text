# HOW WE ACQUIRED HAWAIIAN ISLANDS FROM THE CHINESE

That there is at least one man at
Stanford who is absolutely "on the
boat" was shown in a recent examin
ation given by the history department
to test the general knowledge glean
ed from newspapers by university stu
dents. A question asked "who is Os
car Underwood?" brought forth the sur
prisingly correct reply that "Under
wood is United States Senator." In
asmuch as the examination was given
on the day that Underwood became a
senator, and at 10:15 in the morning,
by allowing for three hours eiapseu
time from Washington, D. C., the re
ply could be labeled as correct. Up
to that hour Underwood had been a
member of the House of Representa
tives. The majority who took the
test were pitifully ignorant of Oscar
Underwood.
Elihu Root was described as any
thing from presidential candidate
against Taft to governor of New York,
and supreme court judge and promi
nent lawyer denouncing the trusts.
William McKinley must have groan
ed in his grave when labelled as a
strong advocate of free silver and a
leader of the popular forces of the
south against the champion of the
gold standard, Bryan.
When it came to displaying knowl
edge upon the 16th amendment to the
constitution, ignorance was bliss. The
replies varied from emphatic denial
of existence of such an amendment,
to an answer stating that the lÂ«th ad
dition established a literacy ie&i 101
immigrants. One fourth of the class
believed that the original constitution
al provision for the election of sena
tors existed, and knew nothing of
popular elections.
Rut the greatest blow of all was
dealt, when the startling statement
was read that the Hawaiian Islands
lie in the Southern Atlantic and were
acquired from China in IS9S. Other
information 011 this subject placed
these islands anywhere from North
west Alaska to the Phillippine Archi
pelago.
