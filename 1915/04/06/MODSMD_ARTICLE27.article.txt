# COLUMBIA TAKES STAND AGAINST MILITARISM
## Stanford Asked to Join in Movement of Colleges for Peace. 
### 
An appeal has come to the Univer
sity in the form of a circular letter
sent out from Columbia University to
join her in a collegiate protest against
militarism in the United States. A
large student assembly was held at Co
lumbia in December, and at that time
the anti-military spirit was universal
at the largest American university.
The following resolution was adopted,
without a dissenting vote: "Resolved,
That we, the students of Columbia Uni
versity, in mass meeting assembled,
hereby go 011 record before congress
anu the people of the United States,
as opposed to militarism in general,
and an increase in our army and
navy in particular."
The Columbia men believe they see
in the summer camps established for
drilling college men last summer, and
the proposed conscription of college
men, recently proposed by an eminent
military authority, a purpose of draw
ing college men into the spirit of mili
tarism of the day and decry the at
tempt. While claiming the love for
their country of the men of '61, they
believe, as they say, that patriotism
lies rather in building harvesters and
railroads, rather than dreadnaughts
and armies.
