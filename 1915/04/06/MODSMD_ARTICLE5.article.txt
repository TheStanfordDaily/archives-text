Coach F. L. Guerena, 11, announced
today th 2 freshman and varsity crews
which v. ill meet California and Washi
ngton next Saturday morning. The
eighteen men named lor positions and
the four substitutes will go up to Oak
land tomorrow where they wili take
up headquarters at the Hotel O' kland.
Light workouts in preparation for the
linal grind will mark the practice for
the rest of the week.
r l he varsity crew, averaging 178 3-1
pounds to the man, is the heaviest
which has over sat n a Cardinal shell.
The Freshman is considerably lighter
averaging only 171 3-4 pounds, which
poundage is also less than last year's
Freshman. Only three veterans ap
pear in the varsity line-up this year.
In spite of the fact that the majority
of the oarsmen are new, every man
won his place from a large field of
contestants, and the crew developed is

one of the strongest of recent years.
The veterans ar= Captain Jacomini,
Hulsman and Orme. The new oars
men are Maurer, McEuen, Bloeser.
Green and Worth.
Coach Hiram Conibear announced
the Washington varsity this morning.
In the past the crews representing the
: Northern institution have been an
| nounced before the squad left Seattle,
i but close competition for two seats
j prevented the naming of the varsity
j line-up until after workouts on the
Oakland Estuary during the past two
days. The crew is exceedingly light,
averaging only 107 pounds. With (lie
op.rfcct balance and all the force of
the eights which Washington has sent
flown in the past Coach Conibear be
lieves that his boat will come close to
'•ron-kins the coast record which It.
now holds. Eight varsity men have
'ecr fU'htin? for seats this year, and
some of them were unable to bold
their places before the work of ibo
recruits.
The California crew is an unknown
quantity. The definite announcement
of the line-up will not be made until
"oxt Friday. Widespread interest in

the sport has lapsed this yea.r. The
squad lias trained I'm - a long season
however, a:ul dini.:,; u h of I he time
Coach Stepheiscn has devoted liis at
tention to a pieked quad and turned
all his efforl to l.ri.:.'ing it to per-
