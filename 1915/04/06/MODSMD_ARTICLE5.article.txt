Coach F. L. Guerena, 11, announced
today th 2 freshman and varsity crews
which v. ill meet California and Washi
ngton next Saturday morning. The
eighteen men named lor positions and
the four substitutes will go up to Oak
land tomorrow where they wili take
up headquarters at the Hotel O' kland.
Light workouts in preparation for the
linal grind will mark the practice for
the rest of the week.
r l he varsity crew, averaging 178 3-1
pounds to the man, is the heaviest
which has over sat n a Cardinal shell.
The Freshman is considerably lighter
averaging only 171 3-4 pounds, which
poundage is also less than last year's
Freshman. Only three veterans ap
pear in the varsity line-up this year.
In spite of the fact that the majority
of the oarsmen are new, every man
won his place from a large field of
contestants, and the crew developed is

one of the strongest of recent years.
The veterans ar= Captain Jacomini,
Hulsman and Orme. The new oars
men are Maurer, McEuen, Bloeser.
Green and Worth.
Coach Hiram Conibear announced
the Washington varsity this morning.
In the past the crews representing the
: Northern institution have been an
| nounced before the squad left Seattle,
i but close competition for two seats
j prevented the naming of the varsity
j line-up until after workouts on the
Oakland Estuary during the past two
days. The crew is exceedingly light,
averaging only 107 pounds. With (lie
op.rfcct balance and all the force of
the eights which Washington has sent
flown in the past Coach Conibear be
lieves that his boat will come close to
'•ron-kins the coast record which It.
now holds. Eight varsity men have
'ecr fU'htin? for seats this year, and
some of them were unable to bold
their places before the work of ibo
recruits.
The California crew is an unknown
quantity. The definite announcement
of the line-up will not be made until
"oxt Friday. Widespread interest in

the sport has lapsed this yea.r. The
squad lias trained I'm - a long season
however, a:ul dini.:,; u h of I he time

Captain Jaconiini
fection. With the coach's second year
with the Ulue and Uuld oarsmen, crew
supporters believe lie will turn out u
pair of eights v\ liiclx will spring a sur
prise next Saturday.
Coacn Gtieieua lias experienced con
siderable trouble in picking the crew
011 account of the difficulty iu balanc
ing the boat with eigiit heavy oars
men. Early in the season every pos
sible combination was tried out, and
gradual shifts in the line-up even up to
the last week of practice lias develop
ed a rowing machine, which works as
a unit and in which every seat repre
sents a powerful stroke. In his sec
ond year as Stanford Crew Coach, Hus
ky Guerena has increased the admira
tion felt for him by the men because
of his able and impartial judgement
at all times. He has been assisted in
coaching by Sterling Jeffers, manager
of the crew.
Captain Jacomini is again seated at
No. 4, where he rowed last year.
Both Jacomini and Hulsman, who is
seated at the bow, will row for
the fourth time this year on a Stanford
and for the third time 011 the varsity
crew. They rowed in the 1915 Fresh
man and were drafted into the Var
sity in their Sophomore year. Huls
man has rowed No. 7 for the past two
years, and started there this spring.
In a shift in the line-up in niiu-aeasou
he was placed at low, a position which
was proving difficult to fill, and has
remained in that seat ever since. ChiCK
Orme, the third veteran, is occupying
his old seat at No. 6. He rowed in the
1916 freshman and in the varsity
boat. His powerful sweep and perfect
control have made it evident from the
first of the season that he was one of
the men who was assured of a seal
in the varsity line-up. He is the heavi
est man on the crew, weighing 190
pounds.
Maurer and McEuen, at stroke and
No. 7, were moved into their positions
directly from last year's Freshman.
With their increased experience they
will prove strong factors in the Var
sity's strength this year. Maurer has
a cool, easy stroke and the men re
spond easily to his guidance.
No. 5 is the seat in the shell which
has been most hotly contested. Bloe
ser has been tried in the position dur
ing the past ten days, and his long
reach and greater ability in keeping
the shell balanced demonstrate that
he is the man for the place. Bloe
sed rowed ! n the 1915 Freshman and
has been a member of the squad since
then, rowing 011 the Second Varsity.
Green and Worth, rowing No. 3 and
No. 2, were seated in the Second Var
sity last year and in the 101G fresh
man, of which latter Worth was cap
tain, and their experience and the
drive they are able to put into the
blade have entitled them to their seats
on the Varsity. Johnny Goodman
coxswained the 191(5 freshman aggre
gation. and last year's Second Varsity.
His ability to "talk it up to them" is
unquestioned and he will be ready on
Saturday with rapid-fire words of di
rection and encouragement.

The stroke is practically the same as
that employed by Coach Guerena last
year. It emphasizes a hard catch and
slow recovery. The crew has ably ad
apted tself to it in the process of be
ing transformed into a machine which
will drive the eight-oar through the
waters of the estuary in the quickest
possible manner.
It is Impossible to foretell the mer
its of the Freshmen before they are
seen under fire. More freshman as
pirants appeared in suits than ever be
fore at the beginning of the season
and the long grind of practice has re
sulted in the eight best men In the
class being pieked for the shell. In
general this year's freshman crew does
not appear to measure up to the stan
dard set in the past two years. The
Washington and California freshmen
are likewise largely unknown quanti
ties. though the northern enthusiasts
are boasting a stronger aggregation
than the one which was defeated by
Stanford last year.

up headquarters at the Hotel O' kland.
Light workouts in preparation for the
linal grind will mark the practice for
the rest of the week.
r l he varsity crew, averaging 178 3-1
pounds to the man, is the heaviest
which has over sat n a Cardinal shell.
The Freshman is considerably lighter
averaging only 171 3-4 pounds, which
poundage is also less than last year's
Freshman. Only three veterans ap
pear in the varsity line-up this year.
In spite of the fact that the majority
of the oarsmen are new, every man
won his place from a large field of
contestants, and the crew developed is

one of the strongest of recent years.
The veterans ar= Captain Jacomini,
Hulsman and Orme. The new oars
men are Maurer, McEuen, Bloeser.
Green and Worth.
Coach Hiram Conibear announced
the Washington varsity this morning.
In the past the crews representing the
: Northern institution have been an
| nounced before the squad left Seattle,
i but close competition for two seats
j prevented the naming of the varsity
j line-up until after workouts on the
Oakland Estuary during the past two
days. The crew is exceedingly light,
averaging only 107 pounds. With (lie
op.rfcct balance and all the force of
the eights which Washington has sent
flown in the past Coach Conibear be
lieves that his boat will come close to
'•ron-kins the coast record which It.
now holds. Eight varsity men have
'ecr fU'htin? for seats this year, and
some of them were unable to bold
their places before the work of ibo
recruits.
The California crew is an unknown
quantity. The definite announcement
of the line-up will not be made until
"oxt Friday. Widespread interest in

the sport has lapsed this yea.r. The
squad lias trained I'm - a long season
however, a:ul dini.:,; u h of I he time

fection. With the coach's second year
with the Ulue and Uuld oarsmen, crew
supporters believe lie will turn out u
pair of eights v\ liiclx will spring a sur
prise next Saturday.
Coacn Gtieieua lias experienced con
siderable trouble in picking the crew
011 account of the difficulty iu balanc
ing the boat with eigiit heavy oars
men. Early in the season every pos
sible combination was tried out, and
gradual shifts in the line-up even up to
the last week of practice lias develop
ed a rowing machine, which works as
a unit and in which every seat repre
sents a powerful stroke. In his sec
ond year as Stanford Crew Coach, Hus
ky Guerena has increased the admira
tion felt for him by the men because
of his able and impartial judgement
at all times. He has been assisted in
coaching by Sterling Jeffers, manager
of the crew.
Captain Jacomini is again seated at
No. 4, where he rowed last year.
Both Jacomini and Hulsman, who is
seated at the bow, will row for
the fourth time this year on a Stanford
and for the third time 011 the varsity
crew. They rowed in the 1915 Fresh
man and were drafted into the Var
sity in their Sophomore year. Huls
man has rowed No. 7 for the past two
years, and started there this spring.
In a shift in the line-up in niiu-aeasou
he was placed at low, a position which
was proving difficult to fill, and has
remained in that seat ever since. ChiCK
Orme, the third veteran, is occupying
his old seat at No. 6. He rowed in the
1916 freshman and in the varsity
boat. His powerful sweep and perfect
control have made it evident from the
first of the season that he was one of
the men who was assured of a seal
in the varsity line-up. He is the heavi
est man on the crew, weighing 190
pounds.
Maurer and McEuen, at stroke and
No. 7, were moved into their positions
directly from last year's Freshman.
With their increased experience they
will prove strong factors in the Var
sity's strength this year. Maurer has
a cool, easy stroke and the men re
spond easily to his guidance.
No. 5 is the seat in the shell which
has been most hotly contested. Bloe
ser has been tried in the position dur
ing the past ten days, and his long
reach and greater ability in keeping
the shell balanced demonstrate that
he is the man for the place. Bloe
sed rowed ! n the 1915 Freshman and
has been a member of the squad since
then, rowing 011 the Second Varsity.
Green and Worth, rowing No. 3 and
No. 2, were seated in the Second Var
sity last year and in the 101G fresh
man, of which latter Worth was cap
tain, and their experience and the
drive they are able to put into the
blade have entitled them to their seats
on the Varsity. Johnny Goodman
coxswained the 191(5 freshman aggre
gation. and last year's Second Varsity.
His ability to "talk it up to them" is
unquestioned and he will be ready on
Saturday with rapid-fire words of di
rection and encouragement.

The stroke is practically the same as
that employed by Coach Guerena last
year. It emphasizes a hard catch and
slow recovery. The crew has ably ad
apted tself to it in the process of be
ing transformed into a machine which
will drive the eight-oar through the
waters of the estuary in the quickest
possible manner.
It is Impossible to foretell the mer
its of the Freshmen before they are
seen under fire. More freshman as
pirants appeared in suits than ever be
fore at the beginning of the season
and the long grind of practice has re
sulted in the eight best men In the
class being pieked for the shell. In
general this year's freshman crew does
not appear to measure up to the stan
dard set in the past two years. The
Washington and California freshmen
are likewise largely unknown quanti
ties. though the northern enthusiasts
are boasting a stronger aggregation
than the one which was defeated by
Stanford last year.

No. 4, where he rowed last year.
Both Jacomini and Hulsman, who is
seated at the bow, will row for
the fourth time this year on a Stanford
and for the third time 011 the varsity
crew. They rowed in the 1915 Fresh
man and were drafted into the Var
sity in their Sophomore year. Huls
man has rowed No. 7 for the past two
years, and started there this spring.
In a shift in the line-up in niiu-aeasou
he was placed at low, a position which
was proving difficult to fill, and has
remained in that seat ever since. ChiCK
Orme, the third veteran, is occupying
his old seat at No. 6. He rowed in the
1916 freshman and in the varsity
boat. His powerful sweep and perfect
control have made it evident from the
first of the season that he was one of
the men who was assured of a seal
in the varsity line-up. He is the heavi
est man on the crew, weighing 190
pounds.
Maurer and McEuen, at stroke and
No. 7, were moved into their positions
directly from last year's Freshman.
With their increased experience they
will prove strong factors in the Var
sity's strength this year. Maurer has
a cool, easy stroke and the men re
spond easily to his guidance.
No. 5 is the seat in the shell which
has been most hotly contested. Bloe
ser has been tried in the position dur
ing the past ten days, and his long
reach and greater ability in keeping
the shell balanced demonstrate that
he is the man for the place. Bloe
sed rowed ! n the 1915 Freshman and
has been a member of the squad since
then, rowing 011 the Second Varsity.
Green and Worth, rowing No. 3 and
No. 2, were seated in the Second Var
sity last year and in the 101G fresh
man, of which latter Worth was cap
tain, and their experience and the
drive they are able to put into the
blade have entitled them to their seats
on the Varsity. Johnny Goodman
coxswained the 191(5 freshman aggre
gation. and last year's Second Varsity.
His ability to "talk it up to them" is
unquestioned and he will be ready on
Saturday with rapid-fire words of di
rection and encouragement.

The stroke is practically the same as
that employed by Coach Guerena last
year. It emphasizes a hard catch and
slow recovery. The crew has ably ad
apted tself to it in the process of be
ing transformed into a machine which
will drive the eight-oar through the
waters of the estuary in the quickest
possible manner.
It is Impossible to foretell the mer
its of the Freshmen before they are
seen under fire. More freshman as
pirants appeared in suits than ever be
fore at the beginning of the season
and the long grind of practice has re
sulted in the eight best men In the
class being pieked for the shell. In
general this year's freshman crew does
not appear to measure up to the stan
dard set in the past two years. The
Washington and California freshmen
are likewise largely unknown quanti
ties. though the northern enthusiasts
are boasting a stronger aggregation
than the one which was defeated by
Stanford last year.

Coach F. L. Guerena, 11, announced
today th 2 freshman and varsity crews
which v. ill meet California and Washi
ngton next Saturday morning. The
eighteen men named lor positions and
the four substitutes will go up to Oak
land tomorrow where they wili take
up headquarters at the Hotel O' kland.
Light workouts in preparation for the
linal grind will mark the practice for
the rest of the week.
r l he varsity crew, averaging 178 3-1
pounds to the man, is the heaviest
which has over sat n a Cardinal shell.
The Freshman is considerably lighter
averaging only 171 3-4 pounds, which
poundage is also less than last year's
Freshman. Only three veterans ap
pear in the varsity line-up this year.
In spite of the fact that the majority
of the oarsmen are new, every man
won his place from a large field of
contestants, and the crew developed is

one of the strongest of recent years.
The veterans ar= Captain Jacomini,
Hulsman and Orme. The new oars
men are Maurer, McEuen, Bloeser.
Green and Worth.
Coach Hiram Conibear announced
the Washington varsity this morning.
In the past the crews representing the
: Northern institution have been an
| nounced before the squad left Seattle,
i but close competition for two seats
j prevented the naming of the varsity
j line-up until after workouts on the
Oakland Estuary during the past two
days. The crew is exceedingly light,
averaging only 107 pounds. With (lie
op.rfcct balance and all the force of
the eights which Washington has sent
flown in the past Coach Conibear be
lieves that his boat will come close to
'•ron-kins the coast record which It.
now holds. Eight varsity men have
'ecr fU'htin? for seats this year, and
some of them were unable to bold
their places before the work of ibo
recruits.
The California crew is an unknown
quantity. The definite announcement
of the line-up will not be made until
"oxt Friday. Widespread interest in

the sport has lapsed this yea.r. The
squad lias trained I'm - a long season

Coacn Gtieieua lias experienced con
siderable trouble in picking the crew
011 account of the difficulty iu balanc
ing the boat with eigiit heavy oars
men. Early in the season every pos
sible combination was tried out, and
gradual shifts in the line-up even up to
the last week of practice lias develop
ed a rowing machine, which works as
a unit and in which every seat repre
sents a powerful stroke. In his sec
ond year as Stanford Crew Coach, Hus
ky Guerena has increased the admira

of his able and impartial judgement
at all times. He has been assisted in
coaching by Sterling Jeffers, manager
of the crew.

Coach F. L. Guerena, 11, announced
today th 2 freshman and varsity crews
which v. ill meet California and Washi
ngton next Saturday morning. The
eighteen men named lor positions and
the four substitutes will go up to Oak
land tomorrow where they wili take
up headquarters at the Hotel O' kland.
Light workouts in preparation for the
linal grind will mark the practice for
the rest of the week.
r l he varsity crew, averaging 178 3-1
pounds to the man, is the heaviest
which has over sat n a Cardinal shell.
The Freshman is considerably lighter
averaging only 171 3-4 pounds, which
poundage is also less than last year's
Freshman. Only three veterans ap
pear in the varsity line-up this year.
In spite of the fact that the majority
of the oarsmen are new, every man
won his place from a large field of
contestants, and the crew developed is

one of the strongest of recent years.
The veterans ar= Captain Jacomini,
Hulsman and Orme. The new oars
men are Maurer, McEuen, Bloeser.
Green and Worth.
Coach Hiram Conibear announced
the Washington varsity this morning.
In the past the crews representing the
: Northern institution have been an
| nounced before the squad left Seattle,
i but close competition for two seats
j prevented the naming of the varsity
j line-up until after workouts on the
Oakland Estuary during the past two
days. The crew is exceedingly light,
averaging only 107 pounds. With (lie
op.rfcct balance and all the force of
the eights which Washington has sent
flown in the past Coach Conibear be
lieves that his boat will come close to
'•ron-kins the coast record which It.
now holds. Eight varsity men have
'ecr fU'htin? for seats this year, and
some of them were unable to bold
their places before the work of ibo
recruits.
The California crew is an unknown
quantity. The definite announcement
of the line-up will not be made until
"oxt Friday. Widespread interest in

the sport has lapsed this yea.r. The
squad lias trained I'm - a long season
however, a:ul dini.:,; u h of I he time

Captain Jaconiini
fection. With the coach's second year
with the Ulue and Uuld oarsmen, crew
supporters believe lie will turn out u
pair of eights v\ liiclx will spring a sur
prise next Saturday.
Coacn Gtieieua lias experienced con
siderable trouble in picking the crew
011 account of the difficulty iu balanc
ing the boat with eigiit heavy oars
men. Early in the season every pos
sible combination was tried out, and
gradual shifts in the line-up even up to
the last week of practice lias develop
ed a rowing machine, which works as
a unit and in which every seat repre
sents a powerful stroke. In his sec
ond year as Stanford Crew Coach, Hus
ky Guerena has increased the admira
tion felt for him by the men because
of his able and impartial judgement
at all times. He has been assisted in
coaching by Sterling Jeffers, manager
of the crew.
Captain Jacomini is again seated at
No. 4, where he rowed last year.
Both Jacomini and Hulsman, who is
seated at the bow, will row for
the fourth time this year on a Stanford
and for the third time 011 the varsity
crew. They rowed in the 1915 Fresh
man and were drafted into the Var
sity in their Sophomore year. Huls
man has rowed No. 7 for the past two
years, and started there this spring.
In a shift in the line-up in niiu-aeasou
he was placed at low, a position which
was proving difficult to fill, and has
remained in that seat ever since. ChiCK
Orme, the third veteran, is occupying
his old seat at No. 6. He rowed in the
1916 freshman and in the varsity
boat. His powerful sweep and perfect
control have made it evident from the
first of the season that he was one of
the men who was assured of a seal
in the varsity line-up. He is the heavi
est man on the crew, weighing 190
pounds.
Maurer and McEuen, at stroke and
No. 7, were moved into their positions
directly from last year's Freshman.
With their increased experience they
will prove strong factors in the Var
sity's strength this year. Maurer has
a cool, easy stroke and the men re
spond easily to his guidance.
No. 5 is the seat in the shell which
has been most hotly contested. Bloe
ser has been tried in the position dur
ing the past ten days, and his long
reach and greater ability in keeping
the shell balanced demonstrate that
he is the man for the place. Bloe
sed rowed ! n the 1915 Freshman and
has been a member of the squad since
then, rowing 011 the Second Varsity.
Green and Worth, rowing No. 3 and
No. 2, were seated in the Second Var
sity last year and in the 101G fresh
man, of which latter Worth was cap
tain, and their experience and the
drive they are able to put into the
blade have entitled them to their seats
on the Varsity. Johnny Goodman
coxswained the 191(5 freshman aggre
gation. and last year's Second Varsity.
His ability to "talk it up to them" is
unquestioned and he will be ready on
Saturday with rapid-fire words of di
rection and encouragement.

The stroke is practically the same as
that employed by Coach Guerena last
year. It emphasizes a hard catch and
slow recovery. The crew has ably ad
apted tself to it in the process of be
ing transformed into a machine which
will drive the eight-oar through the
waters of the estuary in the quickest
possible manner.
It is Impossible to foretell the mer
its of the Freshmen before they are
seen under fire. More freshman as
pirants appeared in suits than ever be
fore at the beginning of the season
and the long grind of practice has re
sulted in the eight best men In the
class being pieked for the shell. In
general this year's freshman crew does
not appear to measure up to the stan
dard set in the past two years. The
Washington and California freshmen
are likewise largely unknown quanti
ties. though the northern enthusiasts
are boasting a stronger aggregation
than the one which was defeated by
Stanford last year.
