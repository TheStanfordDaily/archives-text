invaile the camp, s tor the first time
this season to engage the Varsity in
its mid-week game previous to the sec
ond intercollegiate t. s. lc ith Calif
orn'a set for rc t Saturday. Owing
to the strength of t'.ic Oakland colle
gians the e:.hil ition should prove of
especial interest to tin Cardinal fans.
Earlier in tlie spring, SI. Mary's
met the Blue ard C,nld nine on Cal
ifornia's diamond ard managed to em
erge on th' 3 long end of a 4 to 1 score.
Mrennan, who pitched for the Mission
ites, held the hard-hitting opposition
down to on" lone simile. Matches
have also boon stirred by St. Mary's
with the Oakland Const Learners and
the Sacranvanto Athletic club, in all
of which srames the collegians show
ed to marked advantß*rp.

make a similar trip to the Blue anu
Gold campus. The baseball diamond
at California is very apt to force Stan
ford to play tinder difficulties, since
the football arena with its turf infield
is used for baseball. For this reason
two practices will be held at Berke
ley previous to Saturday's game in ol
der to allow the Cardinal nine to be
come accustomed to the change from
a dirt to a grass diamond.
One change appears in the Stanford
line-up which will oppose St. Mary'?
tomorrow afternoon. Downing, who
heretofore has regularly been holding
down right field, lias been switched to
center. Aust'n will cover right, to be
relieved late.r in the game by Noonan.
Thr-e pitchers will share mound
duty, Hayes, How and Hoever, the
first starting the game. Dent of

Stafford. McHoskey and Stevens will
be on dec 1 :. Day is scheduled to worl"
in the left pasture. Since the decisive
defeat at the hands of California la :
Friday, Captain Workman has injected
into the team a lot of fire that is ex
pected to bring them out of their re
cent slump and show to excellent ad
vantage against St. Mary's. Tomor
row's game will be called promptly at
four-fifteen by umpire Heine Spencer.
