# TRUSTEES AND STUDENTS FAIL TO AGREE AS TO LOCATION OF NEW PLUNGE
## GREAT DELAY IS RESULT Mr. Stow Wishes to Locate Tank Between Gymnasium and Car Line—Students Favor Opposite Site 
### 
Definite steps toward the construc
tion of the swimming tank which is
to be built adjoining the new gymna
sium have been delayed owing to the
lack of harmony between Mr. Vander
lynn Stow, Treasurer and Business
Manager cf the University, and the
student body committee appointed by
President A. E. Worthy, '15, in regard
to the location of the tank. Mr. Stow
lias declared himself in favor of
locating the pool on the west side of
the gymnasium, between the building
and the car line, while the Stanford
men have gone on .record as favoring
a location to the east of the gym
nasium, bordering the road.
Director Stolz puts his faith in the
east-side area inasmuch as this section
of the grounds are undoubtedly sub
ject to the maximum of sunshine and
the minimum of chilling winds.
Mr. Stow maintains that the ground
adjoining the car track is the most
sti table fo.r the tank. His reason is
that there will be considerably great
er sunshine. He also believes that it
is more advisable to place it near the
car line than near the street, on which
there is more or less traffic.
I - urthermore, to build the plunge on
the site proposed by Mr. Stow would
cost at least $400 mo.re in plumbing,
the west-side location not adapting it
self to the drainage system now in
stalled in the gymnasium. Additional
cost would result from the increased
amount of plumbing that would be re
quired to enable the out-flowing wa
ters from the tank to be used for the
purpose in view—the irrigation of the
football fields.
An unnecessary but unavoidable du
j plication of expenses will lie entailed
in the construction cf the drainage
system that will carry the out-flowing
waters of the plunge toward Mayfield.
The original and only contract which
did not consider the tank, provided
solely for the drain for the shower
rooms. This drain is to be built at
a depth of but two feet, not adequate
by any means to carry off the water
of Hie plunge. An additional system
at. a depth of ten feet will have to be
constructed. A change in contract
might have avoided this added expense
to some degree, but the Trustees are
decidedly against any ehangc of con
tra et, whatsoever.
"A nickel a swim" will he the means
rf paying the d<M t arising from the
building of the plunge. Lists are now
being circulated for the signature of
thosn willing to part with a "jitney"
for the privilege of a splash in the
Stanford tank. D'reetor Stolz hopes
to show a lengthy list of names as as
surance tint, the debts contracted will
he removed without difficulty.
The gymnasium it-elf is rapidly
Hearing completion. Tin contractors
a,re working as rapidly as is consist
ent. with high grade workmanship.
Most of the interior work is ennnW
ed, the walls are plastered and the
floors ready for the finishing touches.
Farm Superintendent Hews ton esti
mates that the building will be com
pleted by the contractors v.ithin the
next month.
