# SHERWOOD TO BE GIVEN TWICE BY ENGLISH CLUB
## April 23 and 24 Are Dates Set For Famous Play RARE SETTING IS CHOSEN Largest Cast Ever Appearing in a Stanford Production Will Tread the Turf of the Old Estate 
### 
Plans for the English Club produc
tion of "Sherwood", Alfred Noyes'
beautiful tragedy of Koblnhood and his
rner.ry men, are fast nearlng complc
tiou. The first performance will be
staged on the evening of Friday, April
23. For those who will be unable to
attend an evening production, it has
been dee ded to repeat the play on
Saturday, April 24, in the afternoon.
For the evening performance an elec
tric display will be provided to en
hance the natural beauty of the loca
tion which has been chosen.
The gardens surrounding the old
Stanford house will furnish a back
ground for the drama which is the
nearest approach to the original Sher
wood forest which can be found in the
vicinity. Never before has the Stan
ford estate been thrown open to an
enterprise of this kind, and the oppor
tunity for the public is a rare one. The
scene is about a quarter mile west of
the arboretum, and is approached ei
ther by the road running through the
arboretum past the old winery, or by
the state highway. The beautiful slop
ing lawn, surrounded by towering oaks
and firs and low green hsdges makes
a stage which is almost perfect and
will need but few artificial devices to
render it suitable for either evening or
afternoon performance.
The cast is the largest which has
ever been used in dramatic produc
tion at Stanford, and will consist of
approximately one hundred and fifty
people, including principals and the
groups of minor players.
