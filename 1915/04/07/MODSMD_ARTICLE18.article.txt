# CALIFORNIA SENDS NEW AGREEMENT PROPOSALS
## Worthy Calls Meeting in Union For Discussion LOOKS TO A SETTLEMENT Terms Resemble Those of Compact Drawn by Committees. No Provision Made For Freshman Contest 
### 
Another proposal has been sent to
Stanford by the Intercollegiate Agree
ment Committee of the University of
California for a solution of the agree
ment controversy. A meeting has been
called by President A. E. Worthy, '15,
of tlie Associated Students to consider
the proposal tomorrow evening in The
Union at 7:30 o'clock.
The new compact suggested by the
California committee follows in a gen
oral way the terms of the proposed
agreement drawn up in February,
which had to be abrogated because of
the refusal of the Stanford faculty to
allow a restoration of the freshman
intercollegiate game, which was pro
vided for in the agreement.
The letter received by the Stanford
committee follows:
Inter-collegiate Agreement Committee,
Care A. E. Worthy,
Stanford University, Cal.
Gentlemen:
Tn view of the declination of
your Faculty to consent to the res
toration of intercollegiate freshman
contests, you have requested further
consideration of the Stanford-Califor
nia athletic situation.
The student bodies of both univer
sities, having approved that program
wh'ch we, as committees, agreed upon
at our last meeting, it may bo assum
ed that all its terms, with the excep
tion of the provision concerning fresh
man games, can now bo embodied in
the inter-collegiate agreement.
