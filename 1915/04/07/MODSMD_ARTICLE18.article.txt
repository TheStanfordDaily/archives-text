# CALIFORNIA SENDS NEW AGREEMENT PROPOSALS
## Worthy Calls Meeting in Union For Discussion LOOKS TO A SETTLEMENT Terms Resemble Those of Compact Drawn by Committees. No Provision Made For Freshman Contest 
### 
Another proposal has been sent to
Stanford by the Intercollegiate Agree
ment Committee of the University of
California for a solution of the agree
ment controversy. A meeting has been
called by President A. E. Worthy, '15,
of tlie Associated Students to consider
the proposal tomorrow evening in The
Union at 7:30 o'clock.
The new compact suggested by the
California committee follows in a gen
oral way the terms of the proposed
agreement drawn up in February,
which had to be abrogated because of
the refusal of the Stanford faculty to
allow a restoration of the freshman
intercollegiate game, which was pro
vided for in the agreement.
The letter received by the Stanford
committee follows:
Inter-collegiate Agreement Committee,
Care A. E. Worthy,
Stanford University, Cal.
Gentlemen:
Tn view of the declination of
your Faculty to consent to the res
toration of intercollegiate freshman
contests, you have requested further
consideration of the Stanford-Califor
nia athletic situation.
The student bodies of both univer
sities, having approved that program
wh'ch we, as committees, agreed upon
at our last meeting, it may bo assum
ed that all its terms, with the excep
tion of the provision concerning fresh
man games, can now bo embodied in
the inter-collegiate agreement.
The restoration of freshman con
tests is desired alike by both student
bodies, it constituted one of the speci
fic items in our original instructions.
The Stanford students, for their part,
gave up those contests only upon the
imperative order of your Faculty.
To cancel out that item in the pro
gram would therefore be a sacrifice
on both sides, but a sacrifice, which,
in deference to your faculty, and in
the interest of the renewal of inter
collegiate relations is surely worth
making.
Except for this single Item, we now
have a program agreeable to both stu
dent bodies and ready for execution.
We therefore make the following pro
posal :
That we submit to the California
Student Body and that you submit to
the Stanford Student Body, the adop
tion of the program that we drafted
at our last meeting eliminating the
provision for the restoration of fresh
man contests.
This will be, as we have said, a con
cession by both universities. Ou.r cov
enant with you to bar students in the
Affiliated Colleges, and to bring our
scholarship requirements for athletes
to par with yours, will of course stand.
It would be a great accomodation to
us if you would bring this matter be
fore your student body prior to Ap.r'l
10th. We shall bring the proposal to
the attention of our student body with
ing that time.
We earnestly hope that both univer
sities will lie able to secure approval
of this course from their respective
constituents, and this having been
done, we shall be glad to meet with
you again for the formal execution of
the agreement, and to facilitate one
another on the continuance of intercol
legiate contests and of the friendly
feeling which we believe now really
prevails between the students of the
two universities.
In view of the interest which the
public lias shown in our negotiations
this spring, and of the policy adopted
by our joint committee of inviting the
representation of the press to our
meetings, and apprising them of our
proceedings, we shall take the liberty
of giving the papers a copy of this
letter.
Respectfully yours,

The new compact suggested by the
California committee follows in a gen
oral way the terms of the proposed
agreement drawn up in February,
which had to be abrogated because of
the refusal of the Stanford faculty to
allow a restoration of the freshman
intercollegiate game, which was pro
vided for in the agreement.
The letter received by the Stanford
committee follows:
Inter-collegiate Agreement Committee,
Care A. E. Worthy,
Stanford University, Cal.
Gentlemen:
Tn view of the declination of
your Faculty to consent to the res
toration of intercollegiate freshman
contests, you have requested further
consideration of the Stanford-Califor
nia athletic situation.
The student bodies of both univer
sities, having approved that program
wh'ch we, as committees, agreed upon
at our last meeting, it may bo assum
ed that all its terms, with the excep
tion of the provision concerning fresh
man games, can now bo embodied in
the inter-collegiate agreement.
The restoration of freshman con
tests is desired alike by both student
bodies, it constituted one of the speci
fic items in our original instructions.
The Stanford students, for their part,
gave up those contests only upon the
imperative order of your Faculty.
To cancel out that item in the pro
gram would therefore be a sacrifice
on both sides, but a sacrifice, which,
in deference to your faculty, and in
the interest of the renewal of inter
collegiate relations is surely worth
making.
Except for this single Item, we now
have a program agreeable to both stu
dent bodies and ready for execution.
We therefore make the following pro
posal :
That we submit to the California
Student Body and that you submit to
the Stanford Student Body, the adop
tion of the program that we drafted
at our last meeting eliminating the
provision for the restoration of fresh
man contests.
This will be, as we have said, a con
cession by both universities. Ou.r cov
enant with you to bar students in the
Affiliated Colleges, and to bring our
scholarship requirements for athletes
to par with yours, will of course stand.
It would be a great accomodation to
us if you would bring this matter be
fore your student body prior to Ap.r'l
10th. We shall bring the proposal to
the attention of our student body with
ing that time.
We earnestly hope that both univer
sities will lie able to secure approval
of this course from their respective
constituents, and this having been
done, we shall be glad to meet with
you again for the formal execution of
the agreement, and to facilitate one
another on the continuance of intercol
legiate contests and of the friendly
feeling which we believe now really
prevails between the students of the
two universities.
In view of the interest which the
public lias shown in our negotiations
this spring, and of the policy adopted
by our joint committee of inviting the
representation of the press to our
meetings, and apprising them of our
proceedings, we shall take the liberty
of giving the papers a copy of this
letter.
Respectfully yours,
CALIFORNIA INTERCOLLEGIATE
AGREEMENT COMMITTEE.
