The location of the swimming tank
seems a small matter to quibble over,
and yet it is one of the thorns in the
way of going ahead with construction
work on the proposed new plunge.
of harmony between the Grounds
Committee of the Board of Trustees
and the committee appointed by the
Board of Control has resulted in hold
ing the work up. The principle con
tentions advanced by each committee
for the stand which each has taken
are diametrically opposite. It does
not seoni that it would lie very dif
ficult to determine whether the east or
the west side of the gymnasium was
most favorable as far as sunshine and
protection from the cold winds are
concerned. But in settling that ques
tion tne paramount factor to take
into consideration from the standpoint
of the Student Body is the relative
costs of a tank constructed in either
one o.r the other of the proposed
places. The Grounds Committee has
apparently waived this all-important
factor in emphasizing the superiority
of the west side. Already the Student
Body w'U be burdened by an extra
expense in laying a drain pipe to car

i'y off the water from the tank, due
to the fact that the contract for the
gymnasium drainage was let before
the tank was decided upon, and it was
practically impossible to change in
order to include drainage from the
plunge.
There seems to be a lack of cooper
ation between the two committees in
arriving at an ultimate conclusion, or
rather would we say there is a need
of more cooperation in securing the
best results.
