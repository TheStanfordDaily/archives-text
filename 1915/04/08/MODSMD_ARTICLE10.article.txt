# WEIGHTY MATTERS BUSY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
## Discusses Communication From California Intercollegiate Agreement Committee. 
### 
Besides endorsing Alumni Day as a
student as well as an alumni under
taking, the Executive Committee last
evening transacted matters very im
portant to the University. A thorough
d scussion of the communication from
the University of California Intercol
legiate Agreement Committee was
held, and the results of the delibera
tion will be brought before the stu
dents tonight.
Forty dollars was donated in behalf
of the tennis team to defray expenses
for a trip to the Ojai Tournament.
This step makes it possible for Stan
ford racquet-wielde.rs to measure up
against the premier players of Calif
ornia, and a consideration of the Var
sity line-up announced Monday leads
one to believe that the Stanford re
presentation will make a good show
ing.
It was further provided that one
hundred copies of the 1916 'Juad
should be purchased by the Student
Body for distribution among the high
schools of the state.
The year-book contains a valuable
index of information regarding Stan
ford activities and customs and
brings the University prominently be
fore the eyes of desirable preparatory
school men and women. The minutes
of the meeting follow:
