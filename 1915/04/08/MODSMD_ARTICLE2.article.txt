# Executive Committee Pledges Support of Entire Student Body in the Endeavor to Make the Great Reunion a Success. Day's Program Is Elaborately Arranged
## 
### 
The support of the Student Body in making Alumni Day the most successful event of the 1915 calendar was
pledged last evening in a motion passed by the Executive Committee.
Large numbers of Alumni will return May 15 to visit the scenes of their college experiences, and a great op
portunity of binding them psrmantly to a new and lasting interest in the University is open to the students. If
the active members now in college unite in giving these men and women a rousing good time, they will leave
the Campus impressed with reinforced loyalty towards their alma mater—a loyalty which will manifest itself
later in material benefit to Stanford activities.
All organizations are expected and urged to plan receptions for their particular alumni. Fraternity, de
partmental. and class reunions will find an important place on the program. The returning graduates will nat
urally look towards the organizations with which they were affiliated for entertainment and will want to meet
the students with whom they have most n common. In order that proper entertainment may be provided, it is
necessary that a large majority remain on the campus during Senior Week to prepare for the guests.
Assistant Registrar McDowell has charge of promoting the affair, in his official capacity ot' secretary of the
Alumni Associat'on. So far his efforts have been employed in adverstising the meeting and making general
prog.ran l arrangements.
Sub-committees all over the United States are helping to boost the undertaking. Letters describing Alumni
Day are being mailed to all living graduates and permanent class secretaries and interested alumni in all the
states are lining up the graduates in their vicinities, endeavoring to make the biggest showing on May 15.

ALUMNI
Will Return to Farm
MAY 15

The Alumni Clubs of Chicago and
New York are planning to hold ban
quets on the night of the Stanford-
California track meet and definite ar
rangements for sending out large dele
gations to the reunion from both these
cities will be completed at that time.
Another active center is Indianapolis,
where an enthus'astic alumnus is get
ting ready to dispatch a large repre
sentation from that locality.
Of course the greatest activity is be
ing shown in California, and it is safe
to say that nearly one half of all al
umni and ex-students w'U be on hand
to join in the festivities. From Ukiah
to San Diego preparations are being
made for a record invasion of the
'•ampus, and Mr. McDowell reports

that the work which has been accom
plished so far has exceeded his most
sanguine expectations.
Plar.s for the program entertain
ment are maturing rap'dly. Four of
the skits of "23," the great Mystery
Burlesque, have been received from as
many writers—Assistant Professor L.
E. Rassett, Myron Stearns, '06, Miss
3 ir; h G. Morrison, '02, and Miss E.
R. Mirrieless, '07, and others are well
on the way to completion. Next week
Mr. McDowell will confer with the
student committee which was appoint
ed by President Worthy two weeks
ago. and begin defin'te arrangements.
Letters have been sent to followers
of the National Pastime from the al
umni ranks, iti the endeavor to collect
an ex-Varsity nine to play against

the faculty team. Several responses
have been received, offering to fill
various positions in the all-star ag
gregation. Geoxge J. Presley, '07, will
probably act as captain.
All of the classes w'll be on hand,
various clubs, organizations, fraterni
ties, honor societies and departments
will hold reunions, a huge Senior Al-
I umni reception will be held, "23"' will
| be staged, a ball game will occupy the
i attentions of the more strenuous, and
Secretary McDowell will be there to
welcome every last alumni who turns
up at tho appointed t'me. Here's a
charce to write the past and present
of Stanford history. Let's get behind
the opportunity, and make it worth
while for the Alumni to return to the
Farm.
