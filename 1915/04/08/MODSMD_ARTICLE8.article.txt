# PLAN AHEAD

The students have invited the alum
ni to the campus as their guests on
May 15. Incidentally, this is the first
time in the history of the University
that the undergraduates will play host
to the graduates. The success of
Alumni Day depends on your interest
in extending hospitality to members
of twenty-three classes. The most
effective way to show this interest is
to plan to .remain on the campus un
til after May 15. The students have
placed themselves on record far
enough ahead of this date in order to
arrange accordingly. Too often, it is
our intention to get away from the
campus before the ink is dry on our
papers. We do not realize the full
significance of Senior Week and its
many attendant values and pleasures.
This year more than ever before there
is a definite, tangible reason for re
maining on the campus after exam
inations. Through the medium of the
Executive • Committee the Student
Body lias planned to hold open house
for the alumni. You are an integral
part of the Student Body, and as such
should look ahead and plan to take
part in the Alumni Day celebration.
