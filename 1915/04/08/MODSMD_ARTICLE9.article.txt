# OPERA SCORES
## 
### 
The Junior Opera Committee and
the co-authors of the production are
planning to publish the score of "At
the Dragon's Eye." This will not he
accomplished unless sufficient stu
dents show a desire to secure the
scores, and thus insure the success of
the publication. It is essential that
the music of the opera be published,
since many are desirous of securing
copies of the same. Hut the Commit
tee feels that it would hardly be right
to burden the class with the expense
of publication. The Committee hopes
that a sufficient number will sub
scribe to the scores to make the pub
lication possible.
