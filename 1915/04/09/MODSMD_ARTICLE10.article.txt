# FRESHMAN QUESTION MAY BE DECIDED BY ARBITRATION BOARD
## Student Body Vote Favors the Method of Settlement Proposed Last Evening ISSUE UP TO CALIFORNIA 
### 
Stanford students decided by a vote
ot 17(i tu 7G this afternoon to submit
a proposition to the University of
California Agreement Committee to
allow the present controversy be
tween the two institutions to be de
cided by a board of arbitration. This
method of settlement was suggested
at the student body mass meeting
held last evening. The election was
unofficial, because it was not passed
on by the Executive Committee. It
was primarily held for the expression
of student sentiment.
On the proposition of allowing
Freshmen to compete the vote stood
IS3 for competition under all condi
tions and 33 contrary. This vote will
prevent the proposition submitted by
California 011 Tuesday from being ac
cepted.
The election was to have been held
this morning, but was of necessity
postponed to re-print the ballots. The
first set printed was taken from the
printer this morning by an unauthor
ized party, who claimed to have
been sent by Student Body President
Worthy.
A desire to get away from petty
squabbles in order to arrive at some
settlement characterized all the talks
at the meeting in The Union last night.
Some of the speakers pointed out that
I any points of honor which had-arisen
in the earlier part of the controversy
had been settled, and that any differ
ence between the Universities rested
on a sincere difference of opinion on
essential parts of the agreement. This
v'ew seemed to represent the major
ity opinion of the meeting.
Under the circumstances the only
plausible action to be taken would be
a compromise, in which both sides
would concede certain points. The
idea of submitting the idea to a board
of arbitration was first suggested by
Pres'dent Worthy. Later D. R Car
.roll, '16, spoke in favor of this plan
and suggested that the board of arbi
trators consist of five men who were
neither students nor alumni of either
University, but outsiders who have
shown interest in the affairs of the
two institutions. Two of these men
might be appointed by Stanford and
two by California and these might
choose a fifth man to act as chairman,
' according to Carroll's plan. The two
I agreement committees could put ar
guments before this commission and
rely on a fair deal.
An alternative proposition which
received some support was a compro
mise on a six months rule which
would eliminate Freshmen from com
peting dur'ng their first semester in
college. Since it would settle the
| honest differences which now separate
; the two institutions this proposition
j was submitted, though it was not en
i thusiastically .received at the meeting,
i the arbitration plan being favored.
At the conclusion it was decided by
j a vote to submit the two propositions
iof retaining Freshman competition
and leaving all differences to a board
lof arbitration, to a general student
; body election.

been sent by Student Body President
Worthy.
A desire to get away from petty
squabbles in order to arrive at some
settlement characterized all the talks
at the meeting in The Union last night.
Some of the speakers pointed out that
I any points of honor which had-arisen
in the earlier part of the controversy
had been settled, and that any differ
ence between the Universities rested
on a sincere difference of opinion on
essential parts of the agreement. This
v'ew seemed to represent the major
ity opinion of the meeting.
Under the circumstances the only
plausible action to be taken would be
a compromise, in which both sides
would concede certain points. The
idea of submitting the idea to a board
of arbitration was first suggested by
Pres'dent Worthy. Later D. R Car
.roll, '16, spoke in favor of this plan
and suggested that the board of arbi
trators consist of five men who were
neither students nor alumni of either
University, but outsiders who have
shown interest in the affairs of the
two institutions. Two of these men
might be appointed by Stanford and
two by California and these might
choose a fifth man to act as chairman,
' according to Carroll's plan. The two
I agreement committees could put ar
guments before this commission and
rely on a fair deal.
An alternative proposition which
received some support was a compro
mise on a six months rule which
would eliminate Freshmen from com
peting dur'ng their first semester in
college. Since it would settle the
| honest differences which now separate
; the two institutions this proposition
j was submitted, though it was not en
i thusiastically .received at the meeting,
i the arbitration plan being favored.
At the conclusion it was decided by
j a vote to submit the two propositions
iof retaining Freshman competition
and leaving all differences to a board
lof arbitration, to a general student
; body election.
The speakers at last night's meet
ing, which was thrown open for gen
e.ral discussion, were D. 11. Carroll,
'16, S. S. Simonson, '1"), H. C. Soper,

Stanford students decided by a vote
ot 17(i tu 7G this afternoon to submit
a proposition to the University of
California Agreement Committee to
allow the present controversy be
tween the two institutions to be de
cided by a board of arbitration. This
method of settlement was suggested
at the student body mass meeting
held last evening. The election was
unofficial, because it was not passed
on by the Executive Committee. It
was primarily held for the expression
of student sentiment.
On the proposition of allowing
Freshmen to compete the vote stood
IS3 for competition under all condi
tions and 33 contrary. This vote will
prevent the proposition submitted by
California 011 Tuesday from being ac
cepted.
The election was to have been held
this morning, but was of necessity
postponed to re-print the ballots. The
first set printed was taken from the
printer this morning by an unauthor
ized party, who claimed to have
been sent by Student Body President
Worthy.
