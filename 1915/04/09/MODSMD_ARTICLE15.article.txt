# CARDINAL IS WAVING
## 
### 
Well trained Stanford men meet re
presentatives from California on court,
forum, water and diamond within the
next twenty-four hours. The men are
primed to give all that they have to
bring home a double brace of victor
ies. We have confidence that they
will be in the game from start to fin
ish, whether it be in tennis, debate
ing, rowing or baseball. This is the
njoral support which is back of the
teams, but what is needed more than
moral support is material encourage
ment, the spirit which never dies,
whether the Cardinal wins or losses.
This is the part which every stu
dent can play in "bringing home the
bacon." Success to the wearers of
the Cardinal.
