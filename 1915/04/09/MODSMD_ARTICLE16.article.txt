# ARBITRATION
## 
### 
When two factions cannot agree
upon the solution of a problem which
confronts them and they have oppo
site beliefs as to the right or wrong
of the proposition they usually sub
mit it to a non-partisan arbitration
board in order to settle their differ
ences and arrive at an amicable un
derstanding. This is the plan which
has been decided upon by the Student
Body in order to settle the question
whether or not Freshmen shall be al
lowed to compete in varsity contests.
It is reasonable to suppose that the
two parties concerned should be will
ing to agree to this plan and abide
by the decision of the arbitration
board. If they are not willing to do
this they want more than a fifty-fifty
proposition. A ray of light has been
east on the ultimate settlement of the
intercollegiate question and we cer
tainly hope that It will break forth
into bright sunlight.
