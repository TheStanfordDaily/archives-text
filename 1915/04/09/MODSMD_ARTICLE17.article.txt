## Visiting Expert Completes Series of Entertaining lectures on History of Structural Engineering. 
### 
The last of a series of illustrated
lectures being delivered by ,T. I). Gal
oway of San Francisco on "The His
tory of Bridge Construction" was giv
en yesterday afternoon in room 253
of the Engineering Building. Begin
ning with the frst attempts at bridge
building made by the Egyptians and
Assyrians. Mr. Galloway has traced in
a most entertaining manner the grad
ual progress in structural engineer
ing made by all nations of the world.
He has followed their advance through
a period whose events are termed an
cient history, through the "Dark
Ages," the Renaissance, and last the
Modern Age.
The lecture delivered this after
noon commenced with a review of the
subject of suspension and cantilever
bridges. Both types are very old and
long used by a great number of peo
ples, especially the Orientals. The
Chinese were acquainted with the
principles of the suspension bridge as
fa.v back as history is recorded. These
bridges are referred to iti the ac
counts of the travels of Marco Palo
who gave to the Western hemisphere
the first real glimpse of the East. An
interesting feature which Mr. Galo
way brought out was the fact that the
first real suspension bridge was built
in America.
