# STANFORD NINE LOOMS UP AS DANGEROUS CONTENDER
## THREE TENNIS MATCHES PLAYED AT BERKELEY TODAY RECORD CREWS WILL FLY CARDINAL ON THE ESTUARY Yesterday's Games Played With St. Mary's at California Throw New Light on Situation 
### 
A battle royal which will not be
decided until the last man is out in
the ninth inning is scheduled on the
baseball calendar tomorrow after
noon, when Captain Workman will
lead his Cardinal band against the
Blue and Gold aggregation at the
California field. This marks the sec
ond game of the twenty-fourth an
nual intercollegiate series.
To Stanford, tomorrow's struggle
for supremacy on the diamond means
everything, as her very all is staked
upon this game. If the Varsity wins,
the series is even, while If they meet
defeat, the season is over. The great
majority of the fans, the wise-ones,
have already doped California a vic
tor, basing their forecast entirely up
on last Friday's game. In so doing
they not only fail to realize that Stan
ford was in a slump, but also that
Captain Oodson's nine was playing
over its head.
Yesterday the Varsity fought St.
Mary's to a stand-still, losing out by
one run in the ninth round. Calif
ornia played the missionites imme
diately afterwards and were white
washed 3 to 0. The Cardinals annex
ed nine clean healthy wallops off St.
Mary's premier hurler Brandon, while
the Blue and Gold sluggers cleaned
two singles off Whalen, their second
best bet. Schaeffer's proteges pre
sented a great contrast to their last
exhibition 011 the campus. The Var
sity on the other hand has become
an aggregation of fighting ball-tos
sers during the last week and is
due to surprise its supporters.
Coach Jimmie Schaeffer announc
ed yesterday evening that he would
start the same line-up used in the first
intercollegiate game tomorrow against
Stanford. This means Chip Dodge
and Glenny are booked for battery
mates. Last Friday Dodge won just
praise for twirling a three hit shut
out, but in the second contest he may
anticipate some hard treatment. The
California infield will be composed of
Captain Dodson first base, Hayes sec
ond base, Young short-stop, and Gian
elli third. The slugging trio, Adair,
O'Hara, and Rohwer will occupy out
field berths.
112> r ith one possible exception, the
pitcher, Stanford will be represented
by the originally announced team. Up
on whom the burden of firing line
duty will fall is to be determined
just previous to the contest. Whe
ther 'Hayes' superior curve .ball or
Hoever's speed is to meet California is
dependent upon the form shown Sat
urday by these two hurlers. Captain
Workman, Stafford, and McCloskey
are to cover the bases, while Ste
vens as usual will hold down the
short-patch. A change in the position
but not personnel of the out-field has
been made. Day is to continue at left,
but Downing will switch places with
Austin, taking care of center. There
is no question but what the change
will make for improvement.
In the final conjecture, as regards
the probable winner of tomorrow's
game, it seems that with the new
improvement and determined fight
ing spirit evinced phis an even divi
sion of breaks and continuous .root
ers' support, the Varsity is slated for
the long end of a mighty close score.
Yet. doping baseball is like trying to
understand a woman, so what's the
use!
