# ONLY TWO DAYS REMAIN TO BUY TRACK TICKETS
## 
### 
E. C. Behrens, '14, Assistant Gradu
ate Manager, reports that all but 350
tickets to the Intercollegiate Track
Meet have been sold to Stanford men
and women up to date. Of the remain
ing supply, one hundred will gain ad
mittance to the four uppe.r rows of
the rooters' section, while the bal
ance of two hundred and fifty are in
the general section. Fans on the
Campus will have two more days in
which to secure these tickets at the
reduced rate of $1.00 each â€”Monday
and Tuesday of next week. After that
time the tickets will be sent to San
Francisco for sale at $1.50 each.
Pasteboards may also be procured
on the day of the Track Meet at the
Box Office at $1.00 each, but the de
mand on the outside has been so in
sistent for seats that it is very doubt
ful if any will be available on the final
day. Fans will find it profitable to
buy while the sale is conducted here
on the campus.
