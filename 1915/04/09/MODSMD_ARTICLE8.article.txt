# Regular Order Is Retained in Official Announcement of California Eights by Coach Stephenson
## 
### 
The Blue and Gold crews were nam
ed last night by Coach Charles Ste
phenson. The presence of Osborne in
his position at No. 5 in the varsity af
ter being out of practice for several
days with an injured hand caused a
return to the rowing order which has
marked the first crew for the past
three weeks.
Both of the California e'ghts are
liuht this year. The varsity weighs
168 pounds to the man which is only
a pound more than the Washington
average. The California
average 170 pounds.
The men will line-up as follows —
their weight appended:
Varsity—Howard, 112, coxswain;
Penny, 178, stroke; Darnell, 167, No.
7; Shaw, 178, No. 6; Osborne, 167J4,
No. 5; Falck, No. 4; Kieruff,
169, No. 3; Ckptain Merritt, 162, No.
2; Burns, 159, bow; Williams and
Weber, substitutes. Freshman—Hu
manson, 110, coxswain; Day, 171,
stroke; Captain Carter, 171, No. 7; Mc
Farland, 186, No. 6; Lamb, 187, No. 5;
Miller, 17254 No. 4; De Mound, 163, No.
3; Thornburg, l. r >7. No. 2; McNeil, 159,
bow; Spear and Howell, substitutes.
Three of the varsity oarsmen, Captain
Kieruff were drafted from the 1914
and coxswain Howard are veterans of
last year, while oarsmen, Penny and
Kierulff were drafted from the 1914
Freshman.
Dope throws the varsity race be
tween Stanford and Washington. It
will be a f'ght between a very heavy
and an extremely light crew, both
conceded to be powerful rowing mach
ines. Both eights are conceded to be
stronger than those which represent
ed these two institutions last year and
it looks as if the Pacific Coast record,
he'd by Washington is in serious dan
ger of going by. Experts, who were
conceding the race to Wash'ngton
hands down after seeing the rhythm
ical northern eight work out, have
retrenched after watching the Stanford
boat on the estuary Wednesday and
Thursday and grant Stanford a good
chance to cross the line first.
The Varsity will use the new Ward
boat, especially for a heavy crew, in
tomorrow's- race, while the Freshmen
will use the English shell. which was
the varsity hoat in last year's race.
Bad wi'l work to the di-ad-
