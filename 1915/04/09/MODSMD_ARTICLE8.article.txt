# Regular Order Is Retained in Official Announcement of California Eights by Coach Stephenson
## 
### 
The Blue and Gold crews were nam
ed last night by Coach Charles Ste
phenson. The presence of Osborne in
his position at No. 5 in the varsity af
ter being out of practice for several
days with an injured hand caused a
return to the rowing order which has
marked the first crew for the past
three weeks.
Both of the California e'ghts are
liuht this year. The varsity weighs
168 pounds to the man which is only
a pound more than the Washington
average. The California
average 170 pounds.
The men will line-up as follows —
their weight appended:
Varsity—Howard, 112, coxswain;
Penny, 178, stroke; Darnell, 167, No.
7; Shaw, 178, No. 6; Osborne, 167J4,
No. 5; Falck, No. 4; Kieruff,
169, No. 3; Ckptain Merritt, 162, No.
2; Burns, 159, bow; Williams and
Weber, substitutes. Freshman—Hu
manson, 110, coxswain; Day, 171,
stroke; Captain Carter, 171, No. 7; Mc
Farland, 186, No. 6; Lamb, 187, No. 5;
Miller, 17254 No. 4; De Mound, 163, No.
3; Thornburg, l. r >7. No. 2; McNeil, 159,
bow; Spear and Howell, substitutes.
Three of the varsity oarsmen, Captain
Kieruff were drafted from the 1914
and coxswain Howard are veterans of
last year, while oarsmen, Penny and
Kierulff were drafted from the 1914
Freshman.
Dope throws the varsity race be
tween Stanford and Washington. It
will be a f'ght between a very heavy
and an extremely light crew, both
conceded to be powerful rowing mach
ines. Both eights are conceded to be
stronger than those which represent
ed these two institutions last year and
it looks as if the Pacific Coast record,
he'd by Washington is in serious dan
ger of going by. Experts, who were
conceding the race to Wash'ngton
hands down after seeing the rhythm
ical northern eight work out, have
retrenched after watching the Stanford
boat on the estuary Wednesday and
Thursday and grant Stanford a good
chance to cross the line first.
The Varsity will use the new Ward
boat, especially for a heavy crew, in
tomorrow's- race, while the Freshmen
will use the English shell. which was
the varsity hoat in last year's race.
Bad wi'l work to the di-ad-
vantage of the heavy Stanford eight,
but the present clear skies seem to
indicate that the weather God will be
neutral in the contest.
Stanford has won seven and Calif
ornia three of the races between the
California institutions, and the Cardi
nal's winning streak has not been
broken since 190 S. The record of
Freshman contests shows only one
California victory, : n 1904, since com
petition was started in that year.
There has been little student inter
est shown in the sport at Berkeley
this season. A very small squad tur
ned out for practice at the beginning
!of the year. A determined effort is
! being made by Graduate Manager
Stroud to have a large turn-out 011 the
observation car Saturday to view the
race, and unless financ'al support is
given in this manner there is a strong
probability of crew being made a min
or sport.
Stanford and Washington have met
five times —in 1905, 1909 and annually
since 1912. The result shows three
Washington wins to Stanford's two.
Stanford won in 1909 and 1911 and
those two place little faith in the tip
those who place little faith in the tip
hunches are n. g., including Coach Gll
- believe that 1915 is Stanford's
year to win again if the two year in
termission between Cardinal victories
is to hold. Last year was the first
time the Washington Freshman enter
ed the annual regatta in recent years
and the Stanford 'ITers registered a
victory.
