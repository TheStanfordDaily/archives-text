# NINTH INNING BLUE STREAK GIVES GAME TO CALIFORNIA
## Dodson Puts Snappy Finish Onto Fast Diamond Contest, Giving Year's Baseball to Blue and Goldâ€”Stanford Battles Grittily 
### 
In a see-saw diamond battle, every
inning replete with sensations, the
California nine scored a hair-breadth
victory over Stanford Saturday after
noon, thereby annexing the intercol
legiate baseball title in the twenty
fourth annual series. With the count
even and two down, in the last half of
the ninth inning, the blue and gold
tossers finally managed to break
through the ice for the all-important
run that meant the second straight
win.
On two different occasions it seemed
to the local fans as if the game were
sewed up with Cardinal threads, but
each time the opposition came back
with a brace of tying runs. When, in
the final moments, Captain Dodson
went Hying around the bases from
first on Adair's triple like a scared
Indian, it was hard for the bleachers
to realize that the contest was over.
Captain Workman and the band of
eight players that assisted him fought
hard for a victory during every sec
ond of the game, never relaxing in
the hard pace set or giving up cour
age despite frequent unfortunate re
verses. Those wise-ones, who after
the first severe defeat at the hands of
California a week ago did not give
Stanford a chance for victory Satur
day, were forced to look up and take
notice at the game put up by the Var
sity.
Freshman Dimock. who went into
the box at a critical moment in the
sixth frame, deserves great credit for
his heady and cool pitching. Doc
Hayes, on the other hand, should have
scored a win over California by a 4
to 2 count had he been granted the
usual steady support of his team
mates, and for this reason merits no

little praise. Stanford disproved the
statement of its inability to hit by
register ng two roaring doubles and
five clean singles at opportune times.
in the first round, the Varsity ap
peared dangerous, only a c-liance of
fate preventing an almost sure score.
Austin drew a walk. After Stafford's
out to Dodson, Workman and Austin
were safe at first and second on Mc-
Millan's wild heave past the initial
station, which hit a camera man and
thereby prevented an advance of
another base. Dent's safety on a
fielder's choice moved Austin to third,
but forced Workman at second. Down
ing's out to second ended the rally.
California threw a scare into the
bleachers when Young, first up, batted
out a long double to left, only to die
on second.
The next two innings, although not
void of features, produced goose-eggs
for both sides. In the fourth round,
Stanford got to the south-paw, Mc-
Millan, for a brace of runs. Work
man ambled to first on four balls, and
promptly stole second. Dent went out
infield. Russ Downing then came
through with the pinch hit to center
that brought the captain home. Down
ing took second on the play. When
Day knocked a screeching double to
the right field foul line, Downing reg
istered. The next two batters died
before reaching first, ending the
scoring.
California, in their half of the
fourth inning, immediately tied up
matters. After O'Hara had flown to
center, Rohwer hit infield. Gianelli
scored him a moment later with a
long double that hit up against the
left field fence. Hayes followed suit
by doubling to tho same snot, tallying
