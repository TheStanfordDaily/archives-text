# SHAKE, BROTHER

### 
It has been a banner week-end of
intercollegiate activities and Stanford
has come through with a large share
of the victories. To the winner of the
Carnot medal and the victorious Var
sity and Freshman crews every one
extends a hand with a cordial "Shake
Brother." To the players on the base
hall and tennis teams the same hand
is outstretched, but with the added
words, "We'll beat them next year."
On the court and on the diamond
Stanford was defeated by superior
players, and to these men we extend
our congratulations in the unconven
tional phraseology of "Shake Brother."
