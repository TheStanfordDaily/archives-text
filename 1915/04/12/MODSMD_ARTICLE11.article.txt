# NORMAL CONDITION
## 
### 
Although campus talk during the
ensuing week will necessarily hinge
around the prospects for the track
meet on next Saturday, track men
will appreciate it if you do not over
emphasize such matters and do not
ask them questions as to the relative
merits of the entrants on both teams.
What is desired is the normal condi
tion of affairs which has existed
throughout the entire season.
