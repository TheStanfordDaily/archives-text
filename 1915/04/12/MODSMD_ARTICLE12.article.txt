## Causes Consternation and Panic Anions Celestial Cooks of Campus. 
### 
An attempt on the part of some of
I the men in the Delta Upsilon house
I to silence a bevy of howling cats and
incidentally to quell the soulful
strains proceeding from a one-stringed
violin 'n the hands of the Mariposa
cook, almost resulted in a young tong
war last night. This was the spark
j which set flame to a long-smoulde.r
ing animosity between the Celestial
servants of the respective houses, and
gave rise to a fusilade of coal, pota
toes, dirt and rocks, in which some of
the students took part. One of the
missiles crashed through a large win
dow in the Mariposa house. Panic en
sued within.
A realistic touch was added by the
firing of a gun by eome member of the
Delta Upsilon fraternity. This, how
ever, was not the cause of the wild
shrieks which followed, they beins
elicited by forcible contact with an
TriPh potato.
The antipathy to howling cats and
one-stringed violins cost the Delta
| T T psilou house its cook, who left on
account of the unusual excitement.
