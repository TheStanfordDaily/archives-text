# STANFORD CREWS SWEEP COAST REGATTA
## ELDEN RETURNS VICTORY FOR STANFORD IN CARNOT DEBATE Triumph of Cardinal Breaks the String of Five Consecutive Wins For California in Annual Intercollegiate Forensic Classic 
### 
For the first time in six years the
Carnot Modal has been won by a Stan
i'ord man. J. F. Elden, '1(5, secured the
unanimous decision of the judges in
the annual contest with California last
Friday evening, thereby breaking the
string of victories which has been
1) led up by the Blue and Gold debat
ers, and winning the prize for individ
ual excellence in speaking.
Elden was a member of both his
Freshman and Sophomore Interclass
Debating teams, and served as alter
nate on the Intercollegiate squad of
IS 13. his Freshman year.
"Resolved, that the teachers in the
primary schools of France should be
appointed by a communal authority,"
was the specific question which was
chosen from the general topic, "Edu
cation in France s'nce 1900." Elden
showed a complete knowledge of the
details of the French education sys
tem, and it was probably his clear ex
planation of the problem in hand, as
well as bis convincing and fluent de
livery and style in arguing the nega
tive side, which gave him the victory.
An analysis of the French system oc
cupied the first few minutes of his
talk. "The Minister of Public Educa
tion. a member of the Cabinet, has
control over the entire French sys
tem of education, which is the most
centralized '"n the world today," he
began. "The task of governing and
superintending this great field in de
tail requires the delegation of much
power. The.re are twenty-five Bur
eaus of Education, five of which have
to do directly with primary education.
These bureaus have divided France In
to seventeen academies, over each of
which is placed a direct appointee of
th"> central government, the Rector.
This ma 1 ? is required to he an educa
tional expert, and is assisted by the
Vcademy Inspector, who appoints the
Primary school teachers in France.
"This system places the power to

make appointments in the hands of an
efficient man, in no way connected
with politics. We have but to con
sider the evil results of our own sys
tem of appointing teachers by a local
board of education which in most cases
has no knowledge whatever of quali
fications of an instructor, to realize
how efficient this system is.
"Much has been saul concerning the
atheistic tendency of the French school
of today, and the noble baron who gave
us this medal has been quoted to up
hold the contention that they are
"Godless." Of necessity we should ex
pect to find an atheistic philosophy in
the universities, just as we find it in
our own schools of higher education,
hut in the primary schools of France
absolute neutrality of education is
strictly maintained. This is a strong
reason why teachers in the primary
schools should not be appointed by
communal authorities, for all teach
ers would then reflect the religious
ideas of the district. This would ser
iously cripple the efficiency of the
central authority, and completely
wreck any attempts at cooperation
within the nation."
"Such a system could never be equal
to the efficient one in use today, in
which politics never enter, and, in the
words of Professor Frederick Ernest
Farrington, and by which has been
centered the authority for passing
upon the eligibility of teachers in
hands which are most competent to
do the work."
The other speakers for Stanford
were A. . Coyle, '15, and A. .1. Hetting
er, '16, while E. K. Sturgis, '18, R. H.
Scott, '15, and P. Fussell, '16, repre
sented California.
The judges were Hon. William P.
Lawlor, Justice of the State Supreme
Court. Hon. Ch?.rles A. Murdock, Su
pervisor of San Francisco, and Hon. W.
C. Van Fleet, Judge of the United
tes District Court at San Francisco.
