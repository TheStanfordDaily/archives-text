"The problem of industrialism is an
international one. Other countries are
ytosHu, wth it just as we are. It
is fortunate that the laborer is uol
satisfied with his few hundreds a
year. If he were, the conditions that
exist "n the orient would also obtain
iu the Occident.
"The laborer and the capitalist are
both fashioned from the common clay.
Tyranny, injustice and greed are not
restricted to the employer class, out
the workman, when as a result of uni
fied organization he has the power to
determine his wages, shows similar
isregard for the rights of others.
"If the majority of employers were
tyrants and the majority of working
men were ready to resort to violence,
the future of industry would be ex
ceedingly black. But the great major
ity of employers want their employees
to succeed, and most laborers wish to
be law-abiding citizens, not grafters:
For the most part, the men of both
industrial classes are fighting for
equity.
"Prejudice is the cause of mutual lack
of understanding. The resultant mis
trust, suspicion and loss of confidence
are responsible for labor strife. The
finest remedy for such prejudice and
misunderstanding is personal contact.
As the present European war demon
strates. strife brings out the worst in
a man's character, while mediation
brings out his best qualities."
