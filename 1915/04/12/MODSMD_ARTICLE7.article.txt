# Northern Eights Second in Both Races
## RECORD TIMES REGISTERED Superior Show of Strength by Cardinal Wins Contest in Which Leaders Display Excellent Control 
### 
Cardinal oars crossed the line first
on the Oakland Estuary Saturday in
the best races in point ot' time and
close competition ever rowed in the
Pacific Coast regatta*. Washington
White was a last minute contender
in the varsity race and a fair second
in the Freshman hut the form and con
dition of the Stanford men told and
the Varsity and Freshman crossed the
line a length and a quarter and two
lengths and a half respectively ahead
of the close rivals. California was a
poor third in both contests, coming in
well in the rear of the winning eights.
Record Crews
The record for the triangular re
gatta was lowered in both races. The
Freshmen .lowered the time for the
two mile course made by Stanford last
year by two minutes and won the
contest in 11.1 1-5. The varsity row
ed the three miles in three minutes
under last year's time and a full min
ute under the best time of the regatta
â€”16.42, made by the 1912 Stanford
Varsity.
Following the Stanford victory it
is practically assured that the var
sity will enter the regatta to be held
on Lake Washington, Seattle, and the
Exposition .races, in July, in both of
wh'ch the picked crews of the eastern
states will be entered.
Weather conditions were perfect for
the race Saturday. The smooth estu
ary gave advantage to none of the
eights and it was certain from the
start that the race would he a sheer
test of strength and rowing ability.
A 1 iarht haze which hung over the bay,
lifted just before the F.reshman race,
assuring a good sight for the specta
tors on the banks and the many crafts
following the race.
The Freshman Race
Though the California Freshmen hit
the water first when the referee's gun
sounded, the Stanford babes took the
lead from the start and were never
passed by either of the .rivals during
the race. Stanford drew the inside
course for the first year .race, with
Washington in the middle and Calif
ornia on the outside.
Stanford started the race rowing 34,
w'th Washington hitting the same
stroke and California using 36. When
the curve was rounded the Cardinal
lead by a full length, and the two
1 adirg crev s settled down to a steady
stroke of 32 for the rest of the race.
Cali f orr>ia was well outdistanced from
the first, the splendid form of Stan
ford and Washington in sharp con
trast to the scrappy work of the Hlue
and Cold contenders.
The boats kept their position during
the whole race. It was a procession
nnd Stafford was two and a half
lengths ahead ef Washington and five
lengths in front of California wh?n
the finish was reached.
The Varsity Contest
Stanford drew the middle course in
the varsity race with Washington the
inside, and California, playing in the
hard luck that has followed them all
season, rowing in the outer lane.
Again the Cardinal oarsmen took the
lead from the start and held it dur
ing the whole course. Thit the rr.ee
