# Northern Eights Second in Both Races
## RECORD TIMES REGISTERED Superior Show of Strength by Cardinal Wins Contest in Which Leaders Display Excellent Control 
### 
Cardinal oars crossed the line first
on the Oakland Estuary Saturday in
the best races in point ot' time and
close competition ever rowed in the
Pacific Coast regatta*. Washington
White was a last minute contender
in the varsity race and a fair second
in the Freshman hut the form and con
dition of the Stanford men told and
the Varsity and Freshman crossed the
line a length and a quarter and two
lengths and a half respectively ahead
of the close rivals. California was a
poor third in both contests, coming in
well in the rear of the winning eights.
Record Crews
The record for the triangular re
gatta was lowered in both races. The
Freshmen .lowered the time for the
two mile course made by Stanford last
year by two minutes and won the
contest in 11.1 1-5. The varsity row
ed the three miles in three minutes
under last year's time and a full min
ute under the best time of the regatta
—16.42, made by the 1912 Stanford
Varsity.
Following the Stanford victory it
is practically assured that the var
sity will enter the regatta to be held
on Lake Washington, Seattle, and the
Exposition .races, in July, in both of
wh'ch the picked crews of the eastern
states will be entered.
Weather conditions were perfect for
the race Saturday. The smooth estu
ary gave advantage to none of the
eights and it was certain from the
start that the race would he a sheer
test of strength and rowing ability.
A 1 iarht haze which hung over the bay,

The Freshman Race
Though the California Freshmen hit
the water first when the referee's gun
sounded, the Stanford babes took the
lead from the start and were never
passed by either of the .rivals during
the race. Stanford drew the inside
course for the first year .race, with
Washington in the middle and Calif
ornia on the outside.
Stanford started the race rowing 34,
w'th Washington hitting the same
stroke and California using 36. When
the curve was rounded the Cardinal
lead by a full length, and the two
1 adirg crev s settled down to a steady
stroke of 32 for the rest of the race.
Cali f orr>ia was well outdistanced from
the first, the splendid form of Stan
ford and Washington in sharp con
trast to the scrappy work of the Hlue
and Cold contenders.
The boats kept their position during
the whole race. It was a procession
nnd Stafford was two and a half
lengths ahead ef Washington and five
lengths in front of California wh?n
the finish was reached.
The Varsity Contest
Stanford drew the middle course in
the varsity race with Washington the
inside, and California, playing in the
hard luck that has followed them all
season, rowing in the outer lane.
Again the Cardinal oarsmen took the
lead from the start and held it dur
ing the whole course. Thit the rr.ee
was not a procession and Washington
was a close contender during the
whole race, their prow threatening to
show ahead of Stanford at some po'nts
in the race.
As the Varsities came around the
curve Stanford and Washington were
leading almost neck and neck. On the
curve, Johnnie Goodman's careful
manipulaiton of the tiller, cutting in
on a sharp turn, cut down Washing
ton's advantage in the course. Stan
ford was saved a good length by his
work and came out 011 the straight
away leading by half a length, which
was immediately increased to a full
length. California was ten lengths be
hind at this point and in next mile
fell back fully twenty lengths, while
Stanford and Washington fought it
out for supremacy ahead.
The Last Mile
Stanford started the last mile row
ing 32 and Washington at 36, while
California had dropped down to 28.
With all their form gone, the Blue and
Gold put pure strength and fight be
hind their oars in the last third of the
course and cut down the lead by
five lengths in this period finishing
fifteen lengths behind.
Ahead the white oars hitting the
water at a 34 clip crept up on the
Cardinal rowing at 2S until they were
up within a length at the beginning of
the final spurt. Then Stanford pul
led away and finished a length and
a quarter ahead without a sprint.
The Time
As caught by the .referee, Washing
ton's time was six minutes behind
that of Stanford, the White rowing
the race in 15.43 1-5, while the Califor
nia time was 16.42 1-5. The Stanford
Freshmen covered the two miles in
11.1 1-5, Washington in 11.16 1-5 and
California in 11.1 1-5.
The ease with which the Stanford
varsity pulled the Ward boat through
the water gained enthusiastic praise
from Coach Conibear and the half doz
en Washington men who came down
from Seattle to view the race. Show
ing all the form that could be dis
played by the northern eights, the
Freshman and varsity boats drew away
from the "Merrily" and the "Seattle
Spirit, No. 2" by the sheer extra
strength contained in the Stanford
boats. And the form shown by the
sixteen Stanford men guaranteed that
all of that strength was going into the
oars.
The condition of the Stanford men
was demonstrated to be the best, none
of Captain Jacomini's or Captain Her
on's men showing much the worse for
the long grind at its finish, though
the Washington and California men
were well exhausted.
Whs hi net" 11 Stroke Too Fast
Coach Conibear was high in his
praise of the Stanford eights. He con
ceded that his men were outclassed
for strength and condition by the
Stanford men. His one comment,
made during the varsity race and at
its close, was that the Washington men
were rowing at too high a gait, their
quicker stroke not producing the re
sults of the long, slower Stanford pull.
Freshmen Get Sweaters
As the result of an agreement made
at the boat house before the race, the
Washington babes tossed their White
sweaters, with the blue "W" and '1918'
into the Stanford Freshman shell at
the close of the two mile race.
Cardinal oars crossed the line first
on the Oakland Estuary Saturday in
the best races in point ot' time and

Freshmen Get Sweaters
As the result of an agreement made
at the boat house before the race, the
Washington babes tossed their White
sweaters, with the blue "W" and '1918'
into the Stanford Freshman shell at
the close of the two mile race.
Cardinal oars crossed the line first
on the Oakland Estuary Saturday in
the best races in point ot' time and
close competition ever rowed in the
Pacific Coast regatta*. Washington
White was a last minute contender
in the varsity race and a fair second
in the Freshman hut the form and con
dition of the Stanford men told and
the Varsity and Freshman crossed the
line a length and a quarter and two
lengths and a half respectively ahead
of the close rivals. California was a
poor third in both contests, coming in
well in the rear of the winning eights.
Record Crews
The record for the triangular re
gatta was lowered in both races. The
Freshmen .lowered the time for the
two mile course made by Stanford last
year by two minutes and won the
contest in 11.1 1-5. The varsity row
ed the three miles in three minutes
under last year's time and a full min
ute under the best time of the regatta
—16.42, made by the 1912 Stanford
Varsity.
Following the Stanford victory it
is practically assured that the var
sity will enter the regatta to be held
on Lake Washington, Seattle, and the
Exposition .races, in July, in both of
wh'ch the picked crews of the eastern
states will be entered.
Weather conditions were perfect for
the race Saturday. The smooth estu
ary gave advantage to none of the
eights and it was certain from the
start that the race would he a sheer
test of strength and rowing ability.

The Freshman Race
Though the California Freshmen hit
the water first when the referee's gun
sounded, the Stanford babes took the
lead from the start and were never
passed by either of the .rivals during
the race. Stanford drew the inside
course for the first year .race, with
Washington in the middle and Calif
ornia on the outside.
Stanford started the race rowing 34,
w'th Washington hitting the same
stroke and California using 36. When
the curve was rounded the Cardinal
lead by a full length, and the two
1 adirg crev s settled down to a steady
stroke of 32 for the rest of the race.
Cali f orr>ia was well outdistanced from
the first, the splendid form of Stan
ford and Washington in sharp con
trast to the scrappy work of the Hlue
and Cold contenders.
The boats kept their position during
the whole race. It was a procession
nnd Stafford was two and a half
lengths ahead ef Washington and five
lengths in front of California wh?n
the finish was reached.
The Varsity Contest
Stanford drew the middle course in
the varsity race with Washington the
inside, and California, playing in the
hard luck that has followed them all
season, rowing in the outer lane.
Again the Cardinal oarsmen took the
lead from the start and held it dur
ing the whole course. Thit the rr.ee
was not a procession and Washington
was a close contender during the
whole race, their prow threatening to
show ahead of Stanford at some po'nts
in the race.
As the Varsities came around the
curve Stanford and Washington were
leading almost neck and neck. On the
curve, Johnnie Goodman's careful
manipulaiton of the tiller, cutting in
on a sharp turn, cut down Washing
ton's advantage in the course. Stan
ford was saved a good length by his
work and came out 011 the straight
away leading by half a length, which
was immediately increased to a full
length. California was ten lengths be
hind at this point and in next mile
fell back fully twenty lengths, while
Stanford and Washington fought it
out for supremacy ahead.
The Last Mile
Stanford started the last mile row
ing 32 and Washington at 36, while
California had dropped down to 28.
With all their form gone, the Blue and
Gold put pure strength and fight be
hind their oars in the last third of the
course and cut down the lead by
five lengths in this period finishing
fifteen lengths behind.
Ahead the white oars hitting the
water at a 34 clip crept up on the
Cardinal rowing at 2S until they were
up within a length at the beginning of
the final spurt. Then Stanford pul
led away and finished a length and
a quarter ahead without a sprint.
The Time
As caught by the .referee, Washing
ton's time was six minutes behind
that of Stanford, the White rowing
the race in 15.43 1-5, while the Califor
nia time was 16.42 1-5. The Stanford
Freshmen covered the two miles in
11.1 1-5, Washington in 11.16 1-5 and
California in 11.1 1-5.
The ease with which the Stanford
varsity pulled the Ward boat through
the water gained enthusiastic praise
from Coach Conibear and the half doz
en Washington men who came down
from Seattle to view the race. Show
ing all the form that could be dis
played by the northern eights, the
Freshman and varsity boats drew away
from the "Merrily" and the "Seattle
Spirit, No. 2" by the sheer extra
strength contained in the Stanford
boats. And the form shown by the
sixteen Stanford men guaranteed that
all of that strength was going into the
oars.
The condition of the Stanford men
was demonstrated to be the best, none
of Captain Jacomini's or Captain Her
on's men showing much the worse for
the long grind at its finish, though
the Washington and California men
were well exhausted.
Whs hi net" 11 Stroke Too Fast
Coach Conibear was high in his
praise of the Stanford eights. He con
ceded that his men were outclassed
for strength and condition by the
Stanford men. His one comment,
made during the varsity race and at
its close, was that the Washington men
were rowing at too high a gait, their
quicker stroke not producing the re
sults of the long, slower Stanford pull.
Freshmen Get Sweaters
As the result of an agreement made

made during the varsity race and at
its close, was that the Washington men
were rowing at too high a gait, their
quicker stroke not producing the re
sults of the long, slower Stanford pull.
Freshmen Get Sweaters
As the result of an agreement made
at the boat house before the race, the
Washington babes tossed their White
sweaters, with the blue "W" and '1918'
into the Stanford Freshman shell at
the close of the two mile race.
Cardinal oars crossed the line first
on the Oakland Estuary Saturday in
the best races in point ot' time and
close competition ever rowed in the
Pacific Coast regatta*. Washington
White was a last minute contender
in the varsity race and a fair second
in the Freshman hut the form and con
dition of the Stanford men told and
the Varsity and Freshman crossed the
line a length and a quarter and two
lengths and a half respectively ahead
of the close rivals. California was a
poor third in both contests, coming in
well in the rear of the winning eights.
Record Crews
The record for the triangular re
gatta was lowered in both races. The
Freshmen .lowered the time for the
two mile course made by Stanford last
year by two minutes and won the
contest in 11.1 1-5. The varsity row
ed the three miles in three minutes
under last year's time and a full min
ute under the best time of the regatta
—16.42, made by the 1912 Stanford
Varsity.
Following the Stanford victory it
is practically assured that the var
sity will enter the regatta to be held
on Lake Washington, Seattle, and the
Exposition .races, in July, in both of
wh'ch the picked crews of the eastern
states will be entered.
Weather conditions were perfect for
the race Saturday. The smooth estu
ary gave advantage to none of the
eights and it was certain from the
start that the race would he a sheer
test of strength and rowing ability.

The Freshman Race
Though the California Freshmen hit
the water first when the referee's gun
sounded, the Stanford babes took the
lead from the start and were never
passed by either of the .rivals during
the race. Stanford drew the inside
course for the first year .race, with
Washington in the middle and Calif
ornia on the outside.
Stanford started the race rowing 34,
w'th Washington hitting the same
stroke and California using 36. When
the curve was rounded the Cardinal
lead by a full length, and the two
1 adirg crev s settled down to a steady
stroke of 32 for the rest of the race.
Cali f orr>ia was well outdistanced from
the first, the splendid form of Stan
ford and Washington in sharp con
trast to the scrappy work of the Hlue
and Cold contenders.
The boats kept their position during
the whole race. It was a procession
nnd Stafford was two and a half
lengths ahead ef Washington and five
lengths in front of California wh?n
the finish was reached.
The Varsity Contest
Stanford drew the middle course in
the varsity race with Washington the
inside, and California, playing in the
hard luck that has followed them all
season, rowing in the outer lane.
Again the Cardinal oarsmen took the
lead from the start and held it dur
ing the whole course. Thit the rr.ee
was not a procession and Washington
was a close contender during the
whole race, their prow threatening to
show ahead of Stanford at some po'nts
in the race.
As the Varsities came around the
curve Stanford and Washington were
leading almost neck and neck. On the
curve, Johnnie Goodman's careful
manipulaiton of the tiller, cutting in
on a sharp turn, cut down Washing
ton's advantage in the course. Stan
ford was saved a good length by his
work and came out 011 the straight
away leading by half a length, which
was immediately increased to a full
length. California was ten lengths be
hind at this point and in next mile
fell back fully twenty lengths, while
Stanford and Washington fought it
out for supremacy ahead.
The Last Mile
Stanford started the last mile row
ing 32 and Washington at 36, while
California had dropped down to 28.
With all their form gone, the Blue and
Gold put pure strength and fight be
hind their oars in the last third of the
course and cut down the lead by
five lengths in this period finishing
fifteen lengths behind.
Ahead the white oars hitting the
water at a 34 clip crept up on the
Cardinal rowing at 2S until they were
up within a length at the beginning of
the final spurt. Then Stanford pul
led away and finished a length and
a quarter ahead without a sprint.
The Time
As caught by the .referee, Washing
ton's time was six minutes behind
that of Stanford, the White rowing
the race in 15.43 1-5, while the Califor
nia time was 16.42 1-5. The Stanford
Freshmen covered the two miles in
11.1 1-5, Washington in 11.16 1-5 and
California in 11.1 1-5.
The ease with which the Stanford
varsity pulled the Ward boat through
the water gained enthusiastic praise
from Coach Conibear and the half doz
en Washington men who came down
from Seattle to view the race. Show
ing all the form that could be dis
played by the northern eights, the
Freshman and varsity boats drew away
from the "Merrily" and the "Seattle
Spirit, No. 2" by the sheer extra
strength contained in the Stanford
boats. And the form shown by the
sixteen Stanford men guaranteed that
all of that strength was going into the
oars.
The condition of the Stanford men
was demonstrated to be the best, none
of Captain Jacomini's or Captain Her
on's men showing much the worse for
the long grind at its finish, though
the Washington and California men
were well exhausted.
Whs hi net" 11 Stroke Too Fast
Coach Conibear was high in his
praise of the Stanford eights. He con
ceded that his men were outclassed
for strength and condition by the
Stanford men. His one comment,

were rowing at too high a gait, their
