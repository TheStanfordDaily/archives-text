## Outing For Cardinal Players Is Arranged For May and June by Graduate Manager Wilcox HONOLULU LEAGUE IS HOST Harvard and Stanford Considered by Hawaiians For Favor, But Final Choice Goes to Latter 
### 
•Arrangements have been completed
by Graduate Manager Wilcox for an
nivasion of the Orient this summer by
the Stanford baseball team during the
months of May and June. The Car
dinal nine will make the trip as the
guests of the O. A. H. U. League of
Honolulu.
Earlier in the spring the Hawaiian
aggregation was debating whether to

team, but finally chose the latter nine.
In 1912 the varsity sailed to Japan at
the request of the Keio University of
Tokio, and later played in the islands.
Thirteen out of twenty games were
taken on the trip. The Stanford toss
ers won their way into the hearts of
the Hawaiians by their splendid
sportsmanship and it is in memory of
this that the Stanford varsity was
again chosen to compete with the
nines of the far east.
Fourteen men will make the voyage,
thirteen players and Manager Wilcox.

players to take the trip for several
days. Those who are eligible for the

catchers; Hayes, Hoever, Wickersham
and Howe, pitchers; Workman, Ste
vens, McCloskey and Stafford, illfi el ti

leave San Francisco on the Matsonia
May tq. two days following the com
pletion of Senior Week. The voyage
will take seven days. The team will
return either on the Siberia, June 22,
or on the China, July 2.
The O. A. IT. U. Raseb.ill League of

nines both of semi-professional char
acter and college teams. Albert Cas
tle, of Castle & Withington firm, a
