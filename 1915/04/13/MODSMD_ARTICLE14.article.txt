Most of the talks given at last
Thursday's meeting favored this
method of settlement. Believing thai
both Universities are s'nc rein their
present stand nn the Freshman ques
tion and that intercollegiate relations
are at stake, these speakers think that
the only fair method of settlement
would he by arbitration. This meth
od insure a just decision, because the
arbitrators will be above all the feel
ing that has grown up at Stanford
and California since the beginning of I
the controversy. Th;> judges chosen
will be neither student nor alumni
of either institution.
