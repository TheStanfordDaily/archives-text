# THE
						KNOCKER'S PRAYER
## 
### 
There are certain knockers in ev
ery university that are continually
complaining about the way things are
done. And these same people who
always have a grouch never Lend
their assistance to improve conditions
that they feel should be changed.
The following is an editorial which
appeared in "University Daily Kan
san," in which knockers are pictur
ed in their own light. This senti

Stanford.
"Lord, please don't let this Univer
sity grow. I've been here for four
years, and during that time I've fought
eve.ry advance of any kind. I've

Water, the Lights, the climate, the
Hills, the Student Union, the Hoard
of Administration, the Kansan and ev

that this is a pretty good school, that
things might be worse than they are.
I fear that in spite of my efforts,
something like college spirit may sur
vive and that the University may con
tinue to grow, and to become an in
creasing expense to the tax-payers. I
fear that more students will come
every year and that I shall have to
meet more competition when I got
out of school. Oh Lord, don't let this
University grow any more. Keep 't
at a standstill. Incline everybody to
listen to the kickers and not be fooled
by those who insist that the school
is not gointf to rack and ruin. Bless
the outside newspapers, the alumni,
and all knockers, and prosper them
in their destructive criticism, and ab-
