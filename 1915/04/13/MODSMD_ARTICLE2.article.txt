Campbell and Walter Christie, have
announced the officials who will take
charge of the big meet next Saturday
afternoon. Charles H. Minto, a mem
ber of the records committee of the
Pacific Coast branch of the A. A. U.,
and an experienced authority on mat
ters in both track and field, has been
chosen to act as referee. Both uni
versities may be assured of an impar
tial handling of the events and the
selection goes a long way towards as
suring the success of the meet.
"Ollie" Snedigar, the weights cham
pion of the Olympic Club, will hold
the starter's gun and will be assisted
in his duties by the veteran, John O.
Miller. '08, former holder of the rec
ord in the half mile.

ford faculty committee on athletics,
W. P. Fuller, Jr., '10, J. C. Altman,
Dr. Crawford and H. J. Ling, '15, will
act as official timers for the track
events. The judges of the finish are j
as follows: R. Dodd, J. R. Case, for-j
merly the star hurdler of the Illinois 1
track team, T. N. Putnam, Dr. Wool- j
sey and John Elliot, president of the
A. A. U. on the Pacific coast.
An experienced group of former j
athletes and fans have been chosen
to supervise the field events, J. P.
Stewart, J. Tufts, '16, F. Bock and
William Donald, a former California j
graduate manager, will take charge of ;
the pole vault. The officials of the !
broad jump are George Kretsinger, a

legiate record, 1). M. Folsom and C. S.

world's high jump record, M. Cooley,
W. R. Hamilton and ex-Captain P. B.

George Presley, '07, R. Scott and Roy 1
Cowles.
H. Check has been appointed clerk

Lynn Dozier and C. F. Laumeister.
A. S. McDonald, '10, and R. G. Sproulc
rire named as announcers, while D. W.
Bttrbank, '00, and F. Kleeburger will
act as official scorers.
The track meet will begin sharply
at 2:30 Saturday afternoon with the
mile run. The exact times of the
other events have not been figured out
as yet. As usual, competition in the
16 pound hammer throw will precede
the meet proper and will commence
this year at 1 p. m. on the old field.
The conidtion of the California
track will seriously handicap the ath
letes who go in search of records.
The packing is exceedingly loose in
many places and while the Blue and
God authorities are sparing no effort
to place the path in good condition, it
seems evident that the track will still
be very slow. The turns in the quar
ter mile track are sharp and it is
thought that this factor will add at
least a second to every lap.
