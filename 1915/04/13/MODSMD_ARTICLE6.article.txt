The professional training of G. A.
Davis. '18. is standing him in good
stead in the difficult role of "Shad
ow of a Leaf," the prophetic jester
of Sherwood Forest. Davis has played
over both the Orpheum and Panta
ges vaudeville circuits, and also in
stock under Morosco in Los Angeles
and 'n other cities along the coast.
His part is a, curious mixture of fairy
and mortal, and Davis' physique
and voice fit the character perfectly.
E. L. House, '14, plays the villain.
Prince John, with an admirable blend
ing of dignity and treachery, and suc
ceeds in making the repulsed lover
of "Maid Marian" a very real person.
House appeared before a Stanford au

played by Miss Marion Vau?hnn, "HÂ».
: The chief requirements for success in
j this part are not lacking in Miss
Vaughan. Her natural grace and
charming stage presence have been
demonstrated in former appearances
before Stanford audiences, and her
opportunities are many in "Sherwood."

advantage in the clever comedy role
of "Jenny," servant to "Maid Marian."
No chance for a laugh is overlook
ed by Miss Oi .vtis, and she it akes the
most of each "opportunity afforded.
