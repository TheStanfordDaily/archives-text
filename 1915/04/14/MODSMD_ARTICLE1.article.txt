Four Entries Allowed Each
University in the Sprints
TEAM TO LEAVE SATURDAY
The final schedule of track and Held
events for the Big Meet Saturday has
been approved by Coach Campbell of
the Stanford Varsity, and has been
sent up to the authorities at Califor
nia. The first rumber will commence
promptly at 2:30 p.m., and if the meet
is run off according to schedule, the
relay race will be over at 4 o'clock.
As usual, competition in the 1 (5-pound
hammer-throw will be held in advance
of the other events, and will occur at
one o'clock on the old field.
The correct order of track events is
as follows: Mile run, 2:3ft; 100-yard
dash, 2:40; 120-yard high hurdles,
2:4. r >; 440-yard dash, 2:50; two mile
run, 2:55; 880-yard run, 3:10; 220-
yard low hurdles, 3:25; 220-yard dash,
3:4ft; relay race, 3:55. The remaining
field events will be held during the
times that the .races are being run
off, and come in the following order:
High jump, 2:30; shot put, 2:30; pole
vault, 3:00; broad jump, 3:15. This
arrangement seems to be a very fair
distribution of the various competi
tions, and is calculated to give each
team the greatest opportunity to give
the best of which it is capable.
The team is "lying low," so to
speak, at the present time, endeavor
ing to put the finishing touches on its
condition. Trainer Maloney is doing
all in his power to place the men in
the best possible shape for the meet
April 17. and is prescribing rest as
the main essential in achieving this
result.
It Avas reported this morning in one
of the newspapers that Dick Grant
would be unable to compete in the
sprints, owing to his condition. The
report ! s entirely unfounded, and the
Sophomore will toe the mark with th째
rest of the squad next Saturday. In
order to clear up all doubt, it seems
necessary to state that both Kirksey
and Oreve will not be able to enter
the Mig .Meet.
Any man is eligible to compete in
any or all of the events, provided he
is F*o ment'oned in the list of entries
published last Monday. There will be
no heats in the sprints, and each Uni
versity will be allowed to enter four
men in both the 100 and 220. Six
men from each university may com
pete in the remainder of the track
events, and seven may compete 'n
each of the field events.
The team will leave for the scene
of aetion on the 11:34 train Saturday
morn'ng and will luneh at The Break
ers before boarding the train. No ad
ditions to the training table have been
made since it was first held on March
19. and the squad will appreciate non
reference to track affairs during th
remaining three days of "watchful
waiting."

The final schedule of track and Held
events for the Big Meet Saturday has
been approved by Coach Campbell of
the Stanford Varsity, and has been
sent up to the authorities at Califor
nia. The first rumber will commence
promptly at 2:30 p.m., and if the meet
is run off according to schedule, the
relay race will be over at 4 o'clock.
As usual, competition in the 1 (5-pound
hammer-throw will be held in advance
of the other events, and will occur at
one o'clock on the old field.
The correct order of track events is
as follows: Mile run, 2:3ft; 100-yard
dash, 2:40; 120-yard high hurdles,
2:4. r >; 440-yard dash, 2:50; two mile
run, 2:55; 880-yard run, 3:10; 220-
yard low hurdles, 3:25; 220-yard dash,
3:4ft; relay race, 3:55. The remaining
field events will be held during the
times that the .races are being run
off, and come in the following order:
High jump, 2:30; shot put, 2:30; pole
vault, 3:00; broad jump, 3:15. This
arrangement seems to be a very fair
distribution of the various competi
tions, and is calculated to give each
team the greatest opportunity to give
the best of which it is capable.
The team is "lying low," so to
speak, at the present time, endeavor
ing to put the finishing touches on its
condition. Trainer Maloney is doing
all in his power to place the men in
the best possible shape for the meet
April 17. and is prescribing rest as
the main essential in achieving this
result.
It Avas reported this morning in one
of the newspapers that Dick Grant
would be unable to compete in the
sprints, owing to his condition. The
report ! s entirely unfounded, and the
Sophomore will toe the mark with th째
rest of the squad next Saturday. In
order to clear up all doubt, it seems
necessary to state that both Kirksey
and Oreve will not be able to enter
the Mig .Meet.
Any man is eligible to compete in
any or all of the events, provided he
is F*o ment'oned in the list of entries
published last Monday. There will be
no heats in the sprints, and each Uni
versity will be allowed to enter four
