# HELLO!

### 
Democracy is an essential charac
teristic of this community. It is
the thing which hinds everyone into a
unitied group, makes us a large fam
ily. Without the democratic attitude
Stanford would not be Stanford. The
essence of this democracy is so in
grained in the hearts of all under
graduates and graduates that no one
could conceive of a Stanford with
out it.
We have always prided ourselves
that every student speaks to every
other student whether he knows him
by name or not. It is a tradition, and
one of the few real traditions, that
students are accustomed to exchange
a friendly "hello" as they pass. Visi
tors on the campus have often mar
velled at this friendly greeting when
students have said "hello" to them
the same as to any one else. And
they have commented favorably on
this cordial democratic spirit.
Recently there has been a tendency,
especially among the Freshmen, not to
exchange salutations in the unconven
tional way. There seems to be an in
different attitude as to the full signi
ficance of the expression. And if
they do exchange a "hello," they do
it half-heartedly. Although the se
mester is about over, there is still
time for everyone to get into the
habit, and this habit is an excellent
one to cultivate, so that next semester
it will lie instinctive to say "hello."
To the Freshmen entering the Univer
sity each year this democratic spirit
carries with it a world of influence.
