The musical offerings of the colored
singers from Tuskegee Institute were
enthusiastically applauded by a large
audience of appreciative hearers
gathered in The Union last evening.
Plantation songs and jubilee numbers
of the old-time darky-.revival variety
combined to create the delightful at
mosphere of the sunny South.
The songsters were: Thomas F. Ray
and Charles Anderson, second tenors,
Leroy Brown, first tenor, Luther Da
vidson, second bass, and Richard
Mann, first bass.
Humorous characterizations taken
from the works of Paul Lawrence Dun
bar were interpreted by C. W. Wood,
Director of Campaign Work at Tuske
gee, a faculty member accompanying
the singers as dramatic reader.
Mr. Wood also described briefly the
present condition and aims of Tuske
gee Institute founded by Hooker T.
