# ARBITRATION QUESTION BEFORE VOTERS
## 
### 
Dissatisfaction arising over the ar
bitration question with the University
of California in regard to Freshman
competition on varsity teams has oc
casioned the calling of an assembly
tomorrow evening at 8:00 in the Stan
ford Assembly Hall. The election on
this question wh'ch was to be held
on the Quad tomorrow has been post
poned until Friday. The primary rea
son for calling the assembly tomor
row night is that the question of
intercollegiate arbitration may be
brought before the whole student
body before the final vote is taken.
Many were prevented from voting
at the last election on account of the
absence of ballots. The women stu
dents were not included in the meet
ing held in the Union the day preced
ing the local election, and for that
reason were not acquainted with the
question upon which the vote was
taken. Athough under the unfavora
ble conditions a three to one vote was
cast in favor of arbitration, it is hoped
that by the calling of a general assem
bly where a discussion of the question
will be carried on before both the
men and women of the university, dis
satisfaction and misunderstanding will
be eliminated.
