Railroads Will Aid by Granting
Rates to Returning Alumni.
Supplementary Gathering Is
Scheduled For August 14th
EASTERNERS TO COME BACK
Plans are speeding along at a sixty- j
m'le clip for the great Alumni reun
ion and Jubilee to be held on the cam
pus May 15. Even the railroads have
lent a hand in the arrangements for
the easy conveyance of the crowd oL,
pleasure seekers, and will extend spe
cial rates of a fare and a third to all
graduates, who notify the agents, from
all points in California to the Stan
ford Campus. The sale dates going to
Palo Alto are May 10-18, and the re
turn dates, for which tlie two thirds
reduction will be given, May 12-20.
A supplementary reunion day has
been chosen for the convenience of
the Alumni who will be unable to at
tend the meeting on the fifteenth of
May. This date is announced as Au
gust. 14, and occurs coincident with a
number of educational conventions at
the Exposition in San Francisco. The
plan is heartily supported by such dis
tinguished Alumni as President W. W.
Guth. '95, of Goucher College, Balti
more, Md„ R. L. Dougherty, '09, of Cor
nell, and W. C. Taber, '98, of Washing
ton, D. C. This second reunion will
undoubtedly be well attended by mem
bers of the Faculty, who will have re
turned from their vacations by the
middle of August, and also a number
of students who will plan to remain
on the Campus while the Fair is in
progress.
From the list of graduates who ap
pear on the Alumni base-ball nine
which will oppose the Faculty team on
the morning of May 15. it certainly
looks as though the contest should be
of a fast and scrappy nature. The list
includes such stars of the Diamond as
T. T. C. Gregory, '99, Dr. Frank Hin
t'an, '02, George Presley, '07, Jimmie
Lanagan, '00, Lelar.d Cutler, 'OG, E. B.
'Irna. '04. Dr. H. P. Hill, '98, A1 Trow
el' i('vp, '0' ; , a id the following wearers
of the Varsity "S" in more recent
vear Dudley Sal s, '06, C. E. Samp
son, '09. Mow Mitchell, '10, Hruce Ball.
'11. and W. C. The'le, '09. These stick
men will all appear in the comedy
baseball suits they wore in Senior-
Alumni (finis of former years, ballet
costumes, Chinese sacks, farmers and
the like, and may be counted to save
the Faculty cracks a strenuous hid for
first place honors.
Hie Faculty line-up presents a very
formidable front. Chancellor Jordan
heads the 1 st of men at the bat. The
pitching staff consists of A. C. Whita
ker and J. C. L. Fish, a twirling celeb
rity of former yea.rs. The left field
is already cinchrd by Dr. Murray, and
it. is likely that. Dr. Angell will hold
down the short st r p acreige. The fol
lowing players will ficure pronrnentiy
in tli" ehoicp of the remaining posi
tions—Professors Kellogg, F. C. Wood
ward, C. Moser, B. O. Foster, and .T. F. |
Newsom of Palo Alto.
The alumni all over the country con
tinue to turn in satisfactory reports
concerning the success of their efforts
in interesting Eastern alumni in the
project. Dr. H. P. Kuhn, '01, of Kan
sas City, Harry Borders, '12 of St. Lou
is, Mo., and Merle Thorpe. ex-'Ofi, of
Lawrenceville. Kansas, are carrying o"»
a veritable campaign in the States of
Missouri and Kansas. C. M. Bullard.
'ex-'ll, of Seattle, and W. C. Morrow.
'99, of Tacoma, have succeeded in
arousing enthusiasm in the stat 3 of
