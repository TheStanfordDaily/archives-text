# WHOLE HOG OR NONE
## 
### 
Two youngsters are playing in the
back yard. One has a luscious, juicy,
red apple and the other asks him for
it. Nothing backward about the
youngster at all. The owner of the
apple wanted to keep his fruit for
later consumption, but in order to
keep on friendly terms with his play
mate he offered to divide the apple in
half and give one of the two pieces
away. But his companion insisted
that nothing short of the whole apple
would satisfy him. I want it all or
I'll go home and will not play with
you any more."
Picture Stanford and California in
the same light. Stanford has the ap
ple and California wants the luscious
fruit. In terms of intercollegiate dif
ferences, California insists that she
will not accept a fifty-fifty proposi
tion, but demands that Stanford come
all the way, abolishing Freshmen from
competition on varsity teams. In turn
she will bar students of the affiliated
colleges, Davis Farm School excepted,
and raise her scholarship. It is im
possible to measure just how much
California is conceding. Based on
previous years' competition the first
rule would be worthless, and the sec
ond rule is almost impossible of en
forcement. One reason fo.r this is that
the work carried by students at Cali
fornia cannot be measured tangibly
with the work required at Stanford.
The California student body voted
yesterday in favor of abolishing
Freshmen competition . No alterna
tive was presented for the students
to vote upon. The plan of arbitrat
ing the differences, as suggested by
the Stanford students in an unofficial
election last Friday, was not given
consideration on the ballot. Califor
nia demands a whole hog or none.
Stanford students have already vot
ed unanimously that they would not
accept. California's proposition. Rea

sons for this stand are known by all.
Stanford has been broad-minded
enough to propose to submit the dif
ferences to arbitration in the hope
that intercollegiate relations may not
be severed. The question will be dis
cussed at a Student Body meeting to
night and voted upon tomorrow. In
order to vote intelligently everyone
should be present at the meeting.
