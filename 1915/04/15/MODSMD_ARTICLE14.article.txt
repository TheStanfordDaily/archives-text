Editor Daily Palo Alto:
lit the minds of those most con
cerned, the matter of elimination of
Freshmen from varsity athletics does
not rank as a question for arbitration.
The reasons for having first year men
compete are clear to all of us. The
unanimous sense of every speech at
the assembly early in the semester
showed how the men felt —and why.
Hut our reasons are Stanford reasons.
1 believe that to a majority of out
siders the arguments which Califor
nia will put forth will overweigh
ou.rs. Not that they are better argu
ments, but only the very closest and
long continued acquaintance with
things as they are would enable one
to justly decide this trouble.
Why then should we take this very
excellent chance to lose something
which we don't want to lose —which,
in justice to ourselves and our Uni
versity, we must not lose? Is it so
we may continue relations with Cali
fornia? If it were so I believe that it
should not change our stand in any
way. But there is 110 likelihood of a
rupture on this score. California
can't afford it.
During the eight years I have been
in touch with Stanford affairs I recall
numerous demands, "ultimatums,"
etc., and to every one Stanford has
acceded. It has become a habit with
our friends across the bay. They are
holding out, confident that we will
give in as before. Now is a good time
to break that habit.
We will gain nothing by arbitration
—we are almost sure to lose some
thing of great value.
