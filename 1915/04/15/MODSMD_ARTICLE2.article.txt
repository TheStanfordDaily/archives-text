# "WATCHFUL WAITING" IS ATTITUDE IN RIVAL CAMPS
## Track Fans of Both Universities Predict Hotly Contested Races and a Close Score in the Annual Big Meet Next Saturday 
### Wilmer J. Gross, '16 
Now that the time for the great an
nual Track and Field Classic is draw
ing nigh, athletic fans of both Stan
ford and California are endeavoring
to forecast the ultimate result. Con
jectures as to the probable outcome of
the meet are rife on each campus,
and various authorities differ widely
in the dopesheets which they have pre
pared. This variance of opinion is
based largely on the inevitable un
certainty which attends any traciv
competition, and is especially marked
this year because of the lack of suf
ficient data upon which to make com
parisons of the relative ability of the
two squads.
Only two preliminary meets have
been held between the Stanford Yai
sity and outride teams, and the Illin
ois-California dual competition is the
one contest which gives fans an op
portunity of adjudging the merits of
the Blue and Gold squads.

The outcomc cf the Big Meet will
undoubtedly hinge on the ability of
either Stanford or California to annex
a certain number of seconds and thirds
which at present seem to be anybody's
points and will go to th? dark horses
and new men who have been develop
ed on each squad. Certain first
paces, in the hi;rc!les and mile, for
instance, arc conccded to the Cardi
nal, otli rr, in the ha inner throw, high
jump, and .'2O y lrd dash, are consider
ed to be already wo:i by the Mine and
Gold. But a great uncertainly lies in
the final results of the lift yard dash,
the two mile, and the relay—an un
certainty which can not be cleared up
until the events have been run off.
The mile run, wh'ch is scheduled for

the first place in the list of track
events, certainly looks good to the sup
porters of the Cardinal.
In "Skin" Wilson and Aupperle,
Stanford possesses two distance men
whose ability in the final spurt is un
questioned. Wilson holds the record
between the two universities for the
distance, and unless the unforeseen
happens, he will jog in with five points
to his credit in record time. Beebe,
Davis and Burgess look like Cali
fornia's best bets in this race, and
will force Aupperle to the limit for
second and third honors. F.rye and
Flood of Stanford and Al. Vcdder, Wit
ter, floss and Benton of California arc
also listed among the milers, but at
present their ability is more or less
an unknown quantity. Chapman of
Stanford is entered in the one mile
run, and if he actually competes in
this event, he may be counted upon to
•-live a good account of himself.
Peg .Murray, Otto Lachmund, G.rant,
Xeedhmi, Clemmer Johnson and Nik
lason of Stanford will measure up
against Stanton, Threlkeld, Herrick,
Claudius, Johns and Simpson of Cali
fornia in the 100-yard dash. The man
acrcss the Bay are confident in the
sprinting powers of Captain Stanton
to take five points from anything tluit
the Cardinal has to offer in the cen
tury. Be that as it may, Stanford
fans are confident in the sprinting
powers of Feg Murray to give the Cali
fornia captain the race of his life.
Those who have watched the husky
hurdler workout in the 100 are con
scious of a reserve power behind his
running that seems to be inexhaus
table, and his admirers do not hesi
tate to place the 100-ya.rd dash among
the most closely contested races of the
day, in spite of the reputation of his
rival.
Stanford has entered a winged quar
tet in the high sticks. Murray, Nor
ton and Ric Templeton are all good
for 15.2, and Halsted is never far be
hind. Preble looms up us the most
formidable contender in the Blue and
i Gold .ranks, by reason of his victory
over the champion Kelly in the South.
His teammates are Knapp, Muenter,
Klessig, Wright, and Wolongiewicz.
It is the concensus of opinion that
the 440 yard dash is the most uncer
tain race of the day. Conservative
give (ho five points to Jiinmie Todd, by
reason of his past performances and
his ability to use his head in the gruel
ing lap race. But in Chace, Wright
Lynn and Edgar Baal, Stanford has


Captain Itoimett
three sprinters who will press the
veteran to record speed. Edwards,
Dievendorff and Bert West are also
entered as Stanford hopes, and will lie
opposed by Straub, California's next
best bet, Candee, Woodruff, Gibbons,
Learner, and Lawton.
In the half, Bonnett, Stanford Cap
tain and reco.rd-holder, and Scott will
be assisted by A. Wilson, Sclinell and
West. Cuendette, Miller, and Beebe
are considered the strongest Califor
nia competitors. Their teammates are
Ryan, Cohen and Eltnendorf. Bonnett,
Cuendette, Scott and Beebe will prob
ably fight it out for the three win
ning places.
The two mile run will probably re
solve itself into an endurance test be
tween Chapman and A. Wilson of Stan
ford and P. Vedder, Swain and Taylor
of California after the sixth lap mark
has been reached. "Skin" Wilson will
also figure prominently if he is not
too exhausted from the mile run to
stand the strain of the long grind,
and Loucks and Field are liable to de
velop a considerable burst of speed on
the home stretch. Lloyd, Spendt and
Hotaling are the remaining California
entries.
Grant, Lachmund, Needham, Nikl
ason, Feg Murray and C. Johnson of
Stanford are pitted against Stanton,
Threlkeld, Arndt, Bowen, Simpson,
Claudius and Johns of California in
the 220-yard dash. It is hardly prob
able that Feg Murray will enter this
race, and the main responsibility of
gleaning points fo.r the Cardinal rests
with Grant and Otto Lachmund. Both
have done 22.3 in competition this sea
son and should be able to give Stan
ton, Arndt and Threlkeld a good rub
for winning honors.
The low hurdles race looks like an
other Stanford event. With the Coast
champion Murray and his three team
mates Templeton, Norton and Hai
sted entered on the list, at least eight
points should decorate the Stanford
half of the score-board. Muenter,
Hodge, Maker, Knight, Wright, and
Wolongiewicz are counted on by the
California dopesters to bring home a
couple of tallies.
The relay is the last race of the day,
and the prediction is ventured that it
will decide the meet. Ileal, Wright
Lynn, Chase and Murray, with Bon
nett and Dievendorff as possibilities,
will probably uphold the Stanford end
of the argument, while Todd, Stanton,
Woodruff, and Straub seem to be the
logical quartet for the Blue and Gold.
The weights are pretty evenly divid
ed between the two teams. Bedeau,
Bihlman and the Stanford record
holder Caughey have better perform
ances to their credit than any of the
California shotputters, although Lock
hardt, Liversedge and Richardson are
making a strong bid for third place
honors. Shattuck, holder of the
world's intercollegiate record of 175
feet 10 inches in the hammer throw
and his teammates C'oolidge and
Wiley, look to make a clean sweep of
points in throwing the 16-lb. weight.
Miller of Stanford has a heave of 140
feet to his credit in this event and
may force Wiley to extend himself for
the one point position.
If Christie's prediction that Nichols
will clear the bar at 13 feet in the pole
vault on the day of the meet comes
true, Stanford may have to content
herself with second place in this event.
Krohn and Templeton may be count
;d on for points at the finish, how
ever, and Gibbs of California may also
spring a surprise fo.r the bleachers.
The majority of points in the high
jump will undoubtedly go to the Blue
and Gold credit. Nichols and McFie
are slated to win two places for Cali
fornia. R. R. Templeton and Dykes
are jumping over six feet, but they
will have to register their best marks
on the day of the meet in order to
break into the scoring column.
The broad jump is also considered
to be a California event.
Now that the time for the great an
nual Track and Field Classic is draw

ford and California are endeavoring
to forecast the ultimate result. Con

and the prediction is ventured that it
will decide the meet. Ileal, Wright
Lynn, Chase and Murray, with Bon
nett and Dievendorff as possibilities,
will probably uphold the Stanford end
of the argument, while Todd, Stanton,
Woodruff, and Straub seem to be the
logical quartet for the Blue and Gold.
The weights are pretty evenly divid
ed between the two teams. Bedeau,
Bihlman and the Stanford record
holder Caughey have better perform
ances to their credit than any of the
California shotputters, although Lock
hardt, Liversedge and Richardson are
making a strong bid for third place
honors. Shattuck, holder of the
world's intercollegiate record of 175
feet 10 inches in the hammer throw
and his teammates C'oolidge and
Wiley, look to make a clean sweep of
points in throwing the 16-lb. weight.
Miller of Stanford has a heave of 140
feet to his credit in this event and
may force Wiley to extend himself for
the one point position.
If Christie's prediction that Nichols
will clear the bar at 13 feet in the pole
vault on the day of the meet comes
true, Stanford may have to content
herself with second place in this event.
Krohn and Templeton may be count
;d on for points at the finish, how
ever, and Gibbs of California may also
spring a surprise fo.r the bleachers.
The majority of points in the high
jump will undoubtedly go to the Blue
and Gold credit. Nichols and McFie
are slated to win two places for Cali
fornia. R. R. Templeton and Dykes
are jumping over six feet, but they
will have to register their best marks
on the day of the meet in order to
break into the scoring column.
The broad jump is also considered
to be a California event.
Now that the time for the great an
nual Track and Field Classic is draw
ing nigh, athletic fans of both Stan
ford and California are endeavoring
to forecast the ultimate result. Con
jectures as to the probable outcome of
the meet are rife on each campus,
and various authorities differ widely
in the dopesheets which they have pre
pared. This variance of opinion is
based largely on the inevitable un
certainty which attends any traciv
competition, and is especially marked
this year because of the lack of suf
ficient data upon which to make com
parisons of the relative ability of the
two squads.
Only two preliminary meets have
been held between the Stanford Yai
sity and outride teams, and the Illin
ois-California dual competition is the
one contest which gives fans an op
portunity of adjudging the merits of
the Blue and Gold squads.

The outcomc cf the Big Meet will
undoubtedly hinge on the ability of
either Stanford or California to annex
a certain number of seconds and thirds
which at present seem to be anybody's
points and will go to th? dark horses
and new men who have been develop
ed on each squad. Certain first
paces, in the hi;rc!les and mile, for
instance, arc conccded to the Cardi
nal, otli rr, in the ha inner throw, high
jump, and .'2O y lrd dash, are consider
ed to be already wo:i by the Mine and
Gold. But a great uncertainly lies in
the final results of the lift yard dash,
the two mile, and the relay—an un
certainty which can not be cleared up
until the events have been run off.
The mile run, wh'ch is scheduled for

the first place in the list of track
events, certainly looks good to the sup
porters of the Cardinal.
In "Skin" Wilson and Aupperle,
Stanford possesses two distance men
whose ability in the final spurt is un
questioned. Wilson holds the record
between the two universities for the
distance, and unless the unforeseen
happens, he will jog in with five points
to his credit in record time. Beebe,
Davis and Burgess look like Cali
fornia's best bets in this race, and
will force Aupperle to the limit for
second and third honors. F.rye and
Flood of Stanford and Al. Vcdder, Wit
ter, floss and Benton of California arc
also listed among the milers, but at
present their ability is more or less
an unknown quantity. Chapman of
Stanford is entered in the one mile
run, and if he actually competes in
this event, he may be counted upon to
•-live a good account of himself.
Peg .Murray, Otto Lachmund, G.rant,
Xeedhmi, Clemmer Johnson and Nik
lason of Stanford will measure up
against Stanton, Threlkeld, Herrick,
Claudius, Johns and Simpson of Cali
fornia in the 100-yard dash. The man
acrcss the Bay are confident in the
sprinting powers of Captain Stanton
to take five points from anything tluit
the Cardinal has to offer in the cen
tury. Be that as it may, Stanford
fans are confident in the sprinting
powers of Feg Murray to give the Cali
fornia captain the race of his life.
Those who have watched the husky
hurdler workout in the 100 are con
scious of a reserve power behind his
running that seems to be inexhaus
table, and his admirers do not hesi
tate to place the 100-ya.rd dash among
the most closely contested races of the
day, in spite of the reputation of his
rival.
Stanford has entered a winged quar
tet in the high sticks. Murray, Nor
ton and Ric Templeton are all good
for 15.2, and Halsted is never far be
hind. Preble looms up us the most
formidable contender in the Blue and
i Gold .ranks, by reason of his victory
over the champion Kelly in the South.
His teammates are Knapp, Muenter,
Klessig, Wright, and Wolongiewicz.
It is the concensus of opinion that
the 440 yard dash is the most uncer
tain race of the day. Conservative
give (ho five points to Jiinmie Todd, by
reason of his past performances and
his ability to use his head in the gruel
ing lap race. But in Chace, Wright
Lynn and Edgar Baal, Stanford has


Captain Itoimett
three sprinters who will press the
veteran to record speed. Edwards,
Dievendorff and Bert West are also
entered as Stanford hopes, and will lie
opposed by Straub, California's next
best bet, Candee, Woodruff, Gibbons,
Learner, and Lawton.
In the half, Bonnett, Stanford Cap
tain and reco.rd-holder, and Scott will
be assisted by A. Wilson, Sclinell and
West. Cuendette, Miller, and Beebe
are considered the strongest Califor
nia competitors. Their teammates are
Ryan, Cohen and Eltnendorf. Bonnett,
Cuendette, Scott and Beebe will prob
ably fight it out for the three win
ning places.
The two mile run will probably re
solve itself into an endurance test be
tween Chapman and A. Wilson of Stan
ford and P. Vedder, Swain and Taylor
of California after the sixth lap mark
has been reached. "Skin" Wilson will
also figure prominently if he is not
too exhausted from the mile run to
stand the strain of the long grind,
and Loucks and Field are liable to de
velop a considerable burst of speed on
the home stretch. Lloyd, Spendt and
Hotaling are the remaining California
entries.
Grant, Lachmund, Needham, Nikl
ason, Feg Murray and C. Johnson of
Stanford are pitted against Stanton,
Threlkeld, Arndt, Bowen, Simpson,
Claudius and Johns of California in
the 220-yard dash. It is hardly prob
able that Feg Murray will enter this
race, and the main responsibility of
gleaning points fo.r the Cardinal rests
with Grant and Otto Lachmund. Both
have done 22.3 in competition this sea
son and should be able to give Stan
ton, Arndt and Threlkeld a good rub
for winning honors.
The low hurdles race looks like an
other Stanford event. With the Coast
champion Murray and his three team
mates Templeton, Norton and Hai
sted entered on the list, at least eight
points should decorate the Stanford
half of the score-board. Muenter,
Hodge, Maker, Knight, Wright, and
Wolongiewicz are counted on by the
California dopesters to bring home a
couple of tallies.
The relay is the last race of the day,
and the prediction is ventured that it
will decide the meet. Ileal, Wright

Cuendette, Scott and Beebe will prob
ably fight it out for the three win
ning places.
The two mile run will probably re
solve itself into an endurance test be
tween Chapman and A. Wilson of Stan
ford and P. Vedder, Swain and Taylor
of California after the sixth lap mark
has been reached. "Skin" Wilson will
also figure prominently if he is not
too exhausted from the mile run to
stand the strain of the long grind,
and Loucks and Field are liable to de
velop a considerable burst of speed on
the home stretch. Lloyd, Spendt and
Hotaling are the remaining California
entries.
Grant, Lachmund, Needham, Nikl
ason, Feg Murray and C. Johnson of
Stanford are pitted against Stanton,
Threlkeld, Arndt, Bowen, Simpson,
Claudius and Johns of California in
the 220-yard dash. It is hardly prob
able that Feg Murray will enter this
race, and the main responsibility of
gleaning points fo.r the Cardinal rests
with Grant and Otto Lachmund. Both
have done 22.3 in competition this sea
son and should be able to give Stan
ton, Arndt and Threlkeld a good rub
for winning honors.
The low hurdles race looks like an
other Stanford event. With the Coast
champion Murray and his three team
mates Templeton, Norton and Hai
sted entered on the list, at least eight
points should decorate the Stanford
half of the score-board. Muenter,
Hodge, Maker, Knight, Wright, and
Wolongiewicz are counted on by the
California dopesters to bring home a
couple of tallies.
The relay is the last race of the day,
and the prediction is ventured that it
will decide the meet. Ileal, Wright
Lynn, Chase and Murray, with Bon
nett and Dievendorff as possibilities,
will probably uphold the Stanford end
of the argument, while Todd, Stanton,
Woodruff, and Straub seem to be the
logical quartet for the Blue and Gold.
The weights are pretty evenly divid
ed between the two teams. Bedeau,
Bihlman and the Stanford record
holder Caughey have better perform
ances to their credit than any of the
California shotputters, although Lock
hardt, Liversedge and Richardson are
making a strong bid for third place
honors. Shattuck, holder of the
world's intercollegiate record of 175
feet 10 inches in the hammer throw
and his teammates C'oolidge and
Wiley, look to make a clean sweep of
points in throwing the 16-lb. weight.
Miller of Stanford has a heave of 140
feet to his credit in this event and
may force Wiley to extend himself for
the one point position.
If Christie's prediction that Nichols
will clear the bar at 13 feet in the pole
vault on the day of the meet comes
true, Stanford may have to content
herself with second place in this event.
Krohn and Templeton may be count
;d on for points at the finish, how
ever, and Gibbs of California may also
spring a surprise fo.r the bleachers.
The majority of points in the high
jump will undoubtedly go to the Blue
and Gold credit. Nichols and McFie
are slated to win two places for Cali
fornia. R. R. Templeton and Dykes
are jumping over six feet, but they
will have to register their best marks
on the day of the meet in order to
break into the scoring column.
The broad jump is also considered
to be a California event.
Now that the time for the great an
nual Track and Field Classic is draw
ing nigh, athletic fans of both Stan
ford and California are endeavoring
to forecast the ultimate result. Con
jectures as to the probable outcome of
the meet are rife on each campus,
and various authorities differ widely
in the dopesheets which they have pre
pared. This variance of opinion is
based largely on the inevitable un
certainty which attends any traciv
competition, and is especially marked
this year because of the lack of suf
ficient data upon which to make com
parisons of the relative ability of the
two squads.
Only two preliminary meets have
been held between the Stanford Yai
sity and outride teams, and the Illin
ois-California dual competition is the
one contest which gives fans an op
portunity of adjudging the merits of
the Blue and Gold squads.

The outcomc cf the Big Meet will
undoubtedly hinge on the ability of
either Stanford or California to annex
a certain number of seconds and thirds
which at present seem to be anybody's
points and will go to th? dark horses
and new men who have been develop
ed on each squad. Certain first
paces, in the hi;rc!les and mile, for
instance, arc conccded to the Cardi
nal, otli rr, in the ha inner throw, high
jump, and .'2O y lrd dash, are consider
ed to be already wo:i by the Mine and
Gold. But a great uncertainly lies in
the final results of the lift yard dash,
the two mile, and the relay—an un
certainty which can not be cleared up
until the events have been run off.
The mile run, wh'ch is scheduled for

the first place in the list of track
events, certainly looks good to the sup
porters of the Cardinal.
In "Skin" Wilson and Aupperle,
Stanford possesses two distance men
whose ability in the final spurt is un
questioned. Wilson holds the record
between the two universities for the
distance, and unless the unforeseen
happens, he will jog in with five points
to his credit in record time. Beebe,
Davis and Burgess look like Cali
fornia's best bets in this race, and
will force Aupperle to the limit for
second and third honors. F.rye and
Flood of Stanford and Al. Vcdder, Wit
ter, floss and Benton of California arc
also listed among the milers, but at
present their ability is more or less
an unknown quantity. Chapman of
Stanford is entered in the one mile
run, and if he actually competes in
this event, he may be counted upon to
•-live a good account of himself.
Peg .Murray, Otto Lachmund, G.rant,
Xeedhmi, Clemmer Johnson and Nik
lason of Stanford will measure up
against Stanton, Threlkeld, Herrick,
Claudius, Johns and Simpson of Cali
fornia in the 100-yard dash. The man
acrcss the Bay are confident in the
sprinting powers of Captain Stanton
to take five points from anything tluit
the Cardinal has to offer in the cen
tury. Be that as it may, Stanford
fans are confident in the sprinting
powers of Feg Murray to give the Cali
fornia captain the race of his life.
Those who have watched the husky
hurdler workout in the 100 are con
scious of a reserve power behind his
running that seems to be inexhaus
table, and his admirers do not hesi
tate to place the 100-ya.rd dash among
the most closely contested races of the
day, in spite of the reputation of his
rival.
Stanford has entered a winged quar
tet in the high sticks. Murray, Nor
ton and Ric Templeton are all good
for 15.2, and Halsted is never far be
hind. Preble looms up us the most
formidable contender in the Blue and
i Gold .ranks, by reason of his victory
over the champion Kelly in the South.
His teammates are Knapp, Muenter,
Klessig, Wright, and Wolongiewicz.
It is the concensus of opinion that
the 440 yard dash is the most uncer
tain race of the day. Conservative
give (ho five points to Jiinmie Todd, by
reason of his past performances and
his ability to use his head in the gruel
ing lap race. But in Chace, Wright
Lynn and Edgar Baal, Stanford has


Captain Itoimett
three sprinters who will press the
veteran to record speed. Edwards,
Dievendorff and Bert West are also
entered as Stanford hopes, and will lie
opposed by Straub, California's next
best bet, Candee, Woodruff, Gibbons,
Learner, and Lawton.
In the half, Bonnett, Stanford Cap
tain and reco.rd-holder, and Scott will
be assisted by A. Wilson, Sclinell and
West. Cuendette, Miller, and Beebe
are considered the strongest Califor
nia competitors. Their teammates are
Ryan, Cohen and Eltnendorf. Bonnett,
Cuendette, Scott and Beebe will prob

hurdler workout in the 100 are con
scious of a reserve power behind his
running that seems to be inexhaus
table, and his admirers do not hesi
tate to place the 100-ya.rd dash among
the most closely contested races of the
day, in spite of the reputation of his
rival.
Stanford has entered a winged quar
tet in the high sticks. Murray, Nor
ton and Ric Templeton are all good
for 15.2, and Halsted is never far be
hind. Preble looms up us the most
formidable contender in the Blue and
i Gold .ranks, by reason of his victory
over the champion Kelly in the South.
His teammates are Knapp, Muenter,
Klessig, Wright, and Wolongiewicz.
It is the concensus of opinion that
the 440 yard dash is the most uncer
tain race of the day. Conservative
give (ho five points to Jiinmie Todd, by
reason of his past performances and
his ability to use his head in the gruel
ing lap race. But in Chace, Wright
Lynn and Edgar Baal, Stanford has


Captain Itoimett
three sprinters who will press the
veteran to record speed. Edwards,
Dievendorff and Bert West are also
entered as Stanford hopes, and will lie
opposed by Straub, California's next
best bet, Candee, Woodruff, Gibbons,
Learner, and Lawton.
In the half, Bonnett, Stanford Cap
tain and reco.rd-holder, and Scott will
be assisted by A. Wilson, Sclinell and
West. Cuendette, Miller, and Beebe
are considered the strongest Califor
nia competitors. Their teammates are
Ryan, Cohen and Eltnendorf. Bonnett,
Cuendette, Scott and Beebe will prob
ably fight it out for the three win
ning places.
The two mile run will probably re
solve itself into an endurance test be
tween Chapman and A. Wilson of Stan
ford and P. Vedder, Swain and Taylor
of California after the sixth lap mark
has been reached. "Skin" Wilson will
also figure prominently if he is not
too exhausted from the mile run to
stand the strain of the long grind,
and Loucks and Field are liable to de
velop a considerable burst of speed on
the home stretch. Lloyd, Spendt and
Hotaling are the remaining California
entries.
Grant, Lachmund, Needham, Nikl
ason, Feg Murray and C. Johnson of
Stanford are pitted against Stanton,
Threlkeld, Arndt, Bowen, Simpson,
Claudius and Johns of California in
the 220-yard dash. It is hardly prob
able that Feg Murray will enter this
race, and the main responsibility of
gleaning points fo.r the Cardinal rests
with Grant and Otto Lachmund. Both
have done 22.3 in competition this sea
son and should be able to give Stan
ton, Arndt and Threlkeld a good rub
for winning honors.
The low hurdles race looks like an
other Stanford event. With the Coast
champion Murray and his three team
mates Templeton, Norton and Hai
sted entered on the list, at least eight
points should decorate the Stanford
half of the score-board. Muenter,
Hodge, Maker, Knight, Wright, and
Wolongiewicz are counted on by the
California dopesters to bring home a
couple of tallies.
The relay is the last race of the day,
and the prediction is ventured that it
will decide the meet. Ileal, Wright
Lynn, Chase and Murray, with Bon
nett and Dievendorff as possibilities,
will probably uphold the Stanford end
of the argument, while Todd, Stanton,
Woodruff, and Straub seem to be the
logical quartet for the Blue and Gold.
The weights are pretty evenly divid
ed between the two teams. Bedeau,
Bihlman and the Stanford record
holder Caughey have better perform
ances to their credit than any of the
California shotputters, although Lock
hardt, Liversedge and Richardson are
making a strong bid for third place
honors. Shattuck, holder of the
world's intercollegiate record of 175
feet 10 inches in the hammer throw
and his teammates C'oolidge and
Wiley, look to make a clean sweep of
points in throwing the 16-lb. weight.
Miller of Stanford has a heave of 140
feet to his credit in this event and
may force Wiley to extend himself for
the one point position.
If Christie's prediction that Nichols
will clear the bar at 13 feet in the pole
vault on the day of the meet comes
true, Stanford may have to content
herself with second place in this event.
Krohn and Templeton may be count
;d on for points at the finish, how
ever, and Gibbs of California may also
spring a surprise fo.r the bleachers.
The majority of points in the high
jump will undoubtedly go to the Blue
and Gold credit. Nichols and McFie
are slated to win two places for Cali
fornia. R. R. Templeton and Dykes
are jumping over six feet, but they
will have to register their best marks
on the day of the meet in order to
break into the scoring column.
The broad jump is also considered
to be a California event.
Now that the time for the great an
nual Track and Field Classic is draw
ing nigh, athletic fans of both Stan
ford and California are endeavoring
to forecast the ultimate result. Con
jectures as to the probable outcome of
the meet are rife on each campus,
and various authorities differ widely
in the dopesheets which they have pre
pared. This variance of opinion is
based largely on the inevitable un
certainty which attends any traciv
competition, and is especially marked
this year because of the lack of suf
ficient data upon which to make com
parisons of the relative ability of the
two squads.
Only two preliminary meets have
been held between the Stanford Yai
sity and outride teams, and the Illin
ois-California dual competition is the
one contest which gives fans an op
portunity of adjudging the merits of
the Blue and Gold squads.

The outcomc cf the Big Meet will
undoubtedly hinge on the ability of
either Stanford or California to annex
a certain number of seconds and thirds
which at present seem to be anybody's
points and will go to th? dark horses
and new men who have been develop
ed on each squad. Certain first
paces, in the hi;rc!les and mile, for
instance, arc conccded to the Cardi
nal, otli rr, in the ha inner throw, high
jump, and .'2O y lrd dash, are consider
ed to be already wo:i by the Mine and
Gold. But a great uncertainly lies in
the final results of the lift yard dash,
the two mile, and the relay—an un
certainty which can not be cleared up
until the events have been run off.
The mile run, wh'ch is scheduled for

the first place in the list of track
events, certainly looks good to the sup
porters of the Cardinal.
In "Skin" Wilson and Aupperle,
Stanford possesses two distance men
whose ability in the final spurt is un
questioned. Wilson holds the record
between the two universities for the
distance, and unless the unforeseen
happens, he will jog in with five points
to his credit in record time. Beebe,
Davis and Burgess look like Cali
fornia's best bets in this race, and
will force Aupperle to the limit for
second and third honors. F.rye and
Flood of Stanford and Al. Vcdder, Wit
ter, floss and Benton of California arc
also listed among the milers, but at
present their ability is more or less
an unknown quantity. Chapman of
Stanford is entered in the one mile
run, and if he actually competes in
this event, he may be counted upon to
•-live a good account of himself.
Peg .Murray, Otto Lachmund, G.rant,
Xeedhmi, Clemmer Johnson and Nik
lason of Stanford will measure up
against Stanton, Threlkeld, Herrick,
Claudius, Johns and Simpson of Cali
fornia in the 100-yard dash. The man
acrcss the Bay are confident in the
sprinting powers of Captain Stanton
to take five points from anything tluit
the Cardinal has to offer in the cen
tury. Be that as it may, Stanford
fans are confident in the sprinting
powers of Feg Murray to give the Cali
fornia captain the race of his life.
