# "WATCHFUL WAITING" IS ATTITUDE IN RIVAL CAMPS
## Track Fans of Both Universities Predict Hotly Contested Races and a Close Score in the Annual Big Meet Next Saturday 
### Wilmer J. Gross, '16 
Now that the time for the great an
nual Track and Field Classic is draw
ing nigh, athletic fans of both Stan
ford and California are endeavoring
to forecast the ultimate result. Con
jectures as to the probable outcome of
the meet are rife on each campus,
and various authorities differ widely
in the dopesheets which they have pre
pared. This variance of opinion is
based largely on the inevitable un
certainty which attends any traciv
competition, and is especially marked
this year because of the lack of suf
ficient data upon which to make com
parisons of the relative ability of the
two squads.
Only two preliminary meets have
been held between the Stanford Yai
sity and outride teams, and the Illin
ois-California dual competition is the
one contest which gives fans an op
portunity of adjudging the merits of
the Blue and Gold squads.

The outcomc cf the Big Meet will
undoubtedly hinge on the ability of
either Stanford or California to annex
a certain number of seconds and thirds
which at present seem to be anybody's
points and will go to th? dark horses
and new men who have been develop
ed on each squad. Certain first
paces, in the hi;rc!les and mile, for
instance, arc conccded to the Cardi
nal, otli rr, in the ha inner throw, high
jump, and .'2O y lrd dash, are consider
ed to be already wo:i by the Mine and
Gold. But a great uncertainly lies in
the final results of the lift yard dash,
the two mile, and the relay—an un
certainty which can not be cleared up
until the events have been run off.
The mile run, wh'ch is scheduled for

the first place in the list of track
events, certainly looks good to the sup
porters of the Cardinal.
In "Skin" Wilson and Aupperle,
Stanford possesses two distance men
whose ability in the final spurt is un
questioned. Wilson holds the record
between the two universities for the
distance, and unless the unforeseen
happens, he will jog in with five points
to his credit in record time. Beebe,
Davis and Burgess look like Cali
fornia's best bets in this race, and
will force Aupperle to the limit for
second and third honors. F.rye and
Flood of Stanford and Al. Vcdder, Wit
ter, floss and Benton of California arc
also listed among the milers, but at
present their ability is more or less
an unknown quantity. Chapman of
Stanford is entered in the one mile
run, and if he actually competes in
this event, he may be counted upon to
•-live a good account of himself.
Peg .Murray, Otto Lachmund, G.rant,
Xeedhmi, Clemmer Johnson and Nik
lason of Stanford will measure up
against Stanton, Threlkeld, Herrick,
Claudius, Johns and Simpson of Cali
fornia in the 100-yard dash. The man
acrcss the Bay are confident in the
sprinting powers of Captain Stanton
to take five points from anything tluit
the Cardinal has to offer in the cen
tury. Be that as it may, Stanford
fans are confident in the sprinting
powers of Feg Murray to give the Cali
fornia captain the race of his life.
Those who have watched the husky
hurdler workout in the 100 are con
scious of a reserve power behind his
running that seems to be inexhaus
table, and his admirers do not hesi
tate to place the 100-ya.rd dash among
the most closely contested races of the
day, in spite of the reputation of his
rival.
Stanford has entered a winged quar
tet in the high sticks. Murray, Nor
ton and Ric Templeton are all good
for 15.2, and Halsted is never far be
hind. Preble looms up us the most
formidable contender in the Blue and
i Gold .ranks, by reason of his victory
over the champion Kelly in the South.
His teammates are Knapp, Muenter,
Klessig, Wright, and Wolongiewicz.
It is the concensus of opinion that
the 440 yard dash is the most uncer
tain race of the day. Conservative
give (ho five points to Jiinmie Todd, by
reason of his past performances and
his ability to use his head in the gruel
ing lap race. But in Chace, Wright
Lynn and Edgar Baal, Stanford has
