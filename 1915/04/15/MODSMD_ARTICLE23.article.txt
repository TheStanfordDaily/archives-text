# HANDEL'S "MESSIAH" TO BE produced ON MAY 2
## 
### 
The work on Handel's "Messiah,"
which is to be interpreted in the Mem
orial church on May 2, is progressing
rapidly. Extra rehearsals by the
choir are being held to insure a
thorough knowledge of all the songs.
The soloists are working separately,
the orchestra is practicing in San
Francisco, and Mr. Eaton is striving
to perfect the choir.
The Hoard of Trustees has granted
the necessary sum for engaging the
orchestra, the Penninsula Musical As<
sotion has given one hundred dollars
for the remuneration of the soloists,
and Schubert Club lias appropriated
ten dollars for necessities.
The admission will be free in order
to give music-loving people an oppor
tunity to hear a great oratorio. Owing
to the limited number of seats, tickets
will be distributed at the Registrar's
office.
