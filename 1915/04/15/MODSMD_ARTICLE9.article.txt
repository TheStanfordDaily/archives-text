# INTERCOLLEGIATE RELATIONS WILL BE DISCUSSED TONIGHT
## Arbitration to Be Topic of Students' Meeting ALL MAY VOTE TOMORROW California Decides in Favor of the Proposition Made on April 5th 
### 
Shall Stanford arbitrate intercol
-1 eg'ate troubles by means of a neutral
board, or shall she stand pat on the
questions in controversy, with the
probable result of severing athletic
relations with California? This is the
question which will be discussed at
the meeting of the students in the
Assembly Hall this evening. Both
men and women a.ve urged to be pres
ent !n full force, as a question of uni
versity policy so momentous as this
should bo familiar to all.
Membership tickets to the Associat
ed Student Body will not be needed
to cast a vote tomorrow in the elec
tion which was officially authorized
by the lOx cutive Committee last even
ing. There will be absolutely no
qualifications for either men or
women. The arbitration question will
be the only issue on the ballot, and a
cross before "Yes" means that the
voter is in favor of arbitration.
In yesterday's election California
voted ten to one in favor of the pro
posal to Stanford which was embodied
in the letter of April 5, but nothing
concerning arbitration of the diffi
culties was mentioned. The proposed
compromise is that Freshmen shall be
declared ineligible for varsity compe
tition; that students of affiliated col
leges (not including residents at the
Davis Farm) shall also be barred;
and that California's intercollegiate
athletes shall be placed under the
same scholarship restrictions as those
of Stanford.
This is practically the same propo
sition as that offered pending the de
cision as to the Freshman Intercol
legiate gameâ€”practically, but not en
tirely. No reservation was formerly
made excepting the Davis Farm stu
dents from the gene.ral rule concern
ing affiliated colleges. This is a new
clause which was inserted in the
proposition submitted to the Califor
nia voters yesterday.
The polls will be open from eleven
o'clock until two-thirty tomorrow.
