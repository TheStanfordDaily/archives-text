CARUSO
World-famous Tenor, says:
"Tuxedo completely satisfies my
tobacco taste. It is mild and has
delicious flavor. Most important
of all from a singer's standpoint,
Tuxedo does not irritate my
throat."
ity of Tuxedo which C 'aruso
praises is due to the original "Tuxedo Process" by
which the tobacco is treated. This process refines the
tobacco and absolutely removes all bite and sting.
Many thousands of men think they cannot smoke
a pipe, for fear the tobacco might burn or parch their
mouths. Tuxedo has done away with any such pos
sibility. You can smoke Tuxedo all day long, with
out any irritation whatsoever — indeed with increas
ing pleasure.
