# STUDENT SENTIMENT IS CRYSTALLIZED AT LAST NIGHT'S MEETING
## CALIFORNIA STANDS PAT Desire to Arbitrate Trouble Is Prevalentâ€”Assembly and Vote to Be Held Next Week 
### 
The crystallization of student senti
ment in regard to the intercollegiate
trouble with California was the chief
result of the mass meeting held in
the Assembly Hall last evening.
California's stand on the proposition
was emphatically expressed by a com
mittee sent last evening to confer with
tho Stanford executives. Farnum
Griffiths and Victo.r Doyle, who is
pres.dent of the California student
body, were the Blue and Gold repre
sentatives, and as such, stated that
the rival university would not consi
der arbitration in any phase unless it
was first agreed that the Freshmen
would be eliminated from varsity com
petition.
The compromise offered in the let
ter of April 5, by which students of
the affiliated colleges were to be
eliminated from competition as well
as the Freshmen, and California's
scholarship requirements were to
be raised to those of Stanford, is
their final word on the subject. The
barring of Freshmen for the first six
months only will not be considered.
With this ultimatum before it, the
meeting of some two-hundred men
proceeded to the discussion of the dif
ficulties. Of those who spoke, the
greater number were in favor of ot
tering to arbitrate the matter, thus
proving Stanford's good will and inten
tions to both California and the pub
lic at large. A few others were of the
opinion that the Cardinal should be
as stubborn as the Blue and Gold.
It was shown by the various students
who spoke that California based her
contentions on the principle at stake,
and in which she f'.rmly bel'eved. But
at. the same time California did not
take account of the principle for which
Stanford stands. In other words
California cannot see that there are
two sides to the question. She insists
on the "whole hog or none" proposi
tion.
The entire proposition as submit
ted by California, in which Freshmen
would be eliminated from varsity con
tests, affiliated college students with
the exception of those in residence at
Davis would be barred, and the Cali
fornia standard of scholarship would
be raised to the standard maintained
at Stanford, were discussed from all
angles. The ultimate conclusion wa r
that Stanford would be giving every
thing if she accepted such a proposf
tion and receiving very little in re
turn.
From a broad-minded viewpoint
was shown that not to arbitrate would
weaken the position of either side it
maintaining their contentions. If
Stanford and California believing in
their principles it seemed to most
of the speakers that they would be
willing to arbitrate the matter, as the
only logical and sane way of arriv
ing at a settlement of the difficulties.
It was contended that either side
should be men enough to abide by the
decision of an arbitration board.
A motion to postpone the election on
the proposition of arbitration, schedul
ed for tomorrow, was made by F. C.
Hamilton, '15, who later accepted an
amendment made by W. D. Fletcher,
'11, to the effect that a meeting of the
