1 rainer Harry \V. Maloney draws a
very interesting picture of the prelim
inary track season that is just closing,
and asserts his confidence in the physi
cal condition of the team in the follow
ing statement prepared for The Daily
Palo Alto:
"The track season that is just draw
ing to a close has heen a most peculiar
one. We have experienced unusual
weather conditions together with an
absence of outside competition, hoth of
which, play more than a minor part in
the moulding of a track team.
"They say that 'Time and tide
wait for no man.' This season, owing
to the heavy rains has reminded us of
high tide; and as for the time—it has
been moving along with the tide.
"However, in spite of the above
handicap, where do we find ourselves
on this, the eve of the Track meet?
Hue in a great measure to the untiring
zeal, and energy of Coach Campbell
'ind Captain Honnett, together with the
faithful and enthuiastie manner in
which each member of the Track
Squad has gone about his work, we
have been able to surmount what at
first appears to be obstacles, and now
liud ourselves at this stage of the
journey, ready for what is before us
on Saturday.
"(hi glancing around the Training
Table I see nearly thirty young ath
letes, each in splendid physical condi
tion, all looking forward to Saturday's
meet as a pleasurable prospect and
not as art ordeal which must be en*
dv.red.
"Our Track Team this year will
fare a much better balanced team at
California than they <1 id here on our
own track one year ago. Hovveier, it
is my firm opinion that we shall
'Win,' barring any unforeseen acci
dents. The margin of victory how
ever, will be but a few points."
Trainer Maloney, then, has absolute
confidence in the ability of the men
to hold the'r own against the cream
of California's track and field stars.
He has been working quietly and
r tendilv to place them in top-notch
form, and the success of his zeal will
be awarded in the result of tomor
row's meet.
Coach Campbell, too, expects to get
results from the long season's grin<J
tomorrow afternoon. > When asked
his ouiuiun as to the relative strength
of the two Varsities, he made the state*
