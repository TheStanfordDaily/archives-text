# TOMORROW
## 
### 
A well-conditioned, balanced team
will meet California track men in
their new lair tomorrow afternoon.
The men who will represent Stanford
have been under the careful tutelage
of Coach Campbell and the watchful
training of Harry Maloney for several
months. Under the direction of such
men, in whom we have absolute con
fidence, they have been trained to the
minute and can be relied upon at the
finish.
Stanford will be at a disadvantage
in competing upon a new track to
which the men are not accustomed.
However, it will be a decided advan
tage over the eight-lap track on which
they were formerly forced to compete
when track meets were held at Ber
keley.
There is not the slightest doubt that
the meet will be closely contested.
California can always be relied upon
to uncork much more than we give
them credit for. Even when this is
taken into consideration, we are con
fident that the Stanford team will
carry away a majority of the 122
points. But whether they do or not,
we will remembe,r that the highest
standards of sportsmanship should be
maintained at all costs.
