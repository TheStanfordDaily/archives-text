# HANKS ARRANGES PROGRAM OF INTERESTING READINGS
## 
### 
Stanford men and women are urged
to attend the reading to be given in
the Chapel Sunday evening at 7:30 by
N. C. Hanks, the "man who laughs at
fate." Hanks is the blind and hand
less entertainer who is paying his ex
penses while attending classes at
Stanford by giving public lectures and
readings in the vicinity.
As there is no Encina lecture Sun
day evening, it is expected that the
men of the university will attend in
large numbers. The entertainment is
by no means limited to men, how
ever, and Hanks promises features
appealing in interest to everyone.
Twenty-five cents is the price of ad
mission.
