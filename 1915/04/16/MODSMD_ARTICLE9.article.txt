# Edwin Markham Entertains Large Audience at Chapel
## 
### 
Edwin Markham, the poet, spoke to
a large audience in the Chapel yeste"-
day afternoon. His talk was of an in
formal nature, characterized by de
lightful stories and rem'niscences of
early California days. After an
absence of sixteen years, Mr. Mark
ham returns to California to address
present residents.
He read a number of selections from
his books, the first one being taken
from "California the Wonderful"
which is one of his latest works. Such
descriptions as that of the coyote
which he styles as "watchful waiting
on four legs;" or the lizard, as "a
mottled scar â€”a weathermark;" El
Capitan as "the gesture of omnipo
tence" and Yosemite Falls as "the eter
nal splendor of catastrophe," are am
ong the most pleasing touches of the
California wilds. Other selections
were "Little V'rgil," the "Poet Lore"
expressing the mission of the poet, the
"Joy of the Hills," a reminiscence of
his boyhood, and finally his master
piece, "The Man with the Hoe."
In introducing "The man with the
Hoe," Mr. Markham said:
"We are the product of internal,
physical, or mental state, and of so
c'al enviroment. Man must cooperate
in his own evolution; he advances by
looking upward to nn ideal, and each
man is responsible for his own condi
tion.
