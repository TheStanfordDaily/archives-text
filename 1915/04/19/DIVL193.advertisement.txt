William Faversham
Famous. Actor, says
"A pipe of Tuxedo keeps me feeling
physically fit and in good spirits, and,
because it is mild and doesn't bite, it
is pi -asant to the throat and keeps
my voice in good tone. "
Tuxedo Keeps

clean-cut vigor of William Faversham, both as an

ing, he always presents a figure of alert strength and
keen wits. His voice is especially engaging, clear,
carrying and sonorous.
For Tuxedo tobacco to gain a testimonial from such
a man, stating that it helps to keep him "physically
