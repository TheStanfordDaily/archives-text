# STANFORD WINS ANNUAL TRACK CLASSIC BY UPSETTING ALL CALCULATIONS IN THE FIELD
## 
### 
In addressing the enthuiastic assem
blage of rooters at the January track,
crew and baseball rally, Captain Bon
nett expressed the hope that the Var
sity track team would be able to
chr'sten California's new $85,000 oval
as well as the 1914 Rugby fifteen
christened their new turf. They did.
In spite of the fact that early for
tunes of the meet broke against the
Cardinal in nearly every way, the
members of the team did not lose
heart. Fighting grimly to the finish,
accomplishing almost miraculous feats
in the field avents, the Varsity finally
took the measure of the Blue and Gold
veterans alter the meet seemed virtu
ally over, winning out by the small
margin of 62 to 60.
Towards the end of the day's com
petitions, the score stood 56 to 52 in fa
vor of the Cardinal. Both bleachers
were on edge at the start of the relay,
for upon this event seemed to rest de
feat or victory. Lynn brought cheer
after cheer from the Stanford parti
sans when he outdistanced the re
doubtable Stanton; Chace kept up the
winning streak by taking the measure
of Woodruff ; Dievendorff shattered
"dope" to the four winds by leading
Straub to the tape by a determined
spurt on the home stretch, and gave
Be.il a six yard advantage over Todd,
who had been entrusted with the 112 nal
lap by the Blue and Gold coach.
A heart-breaking race it was —on the
home stretch the California hope cams
breast to breast with the flying Cardi
nal athlete. Down the lane they
strained, running neck and neck to the
tape. Todd received the decision of
the judges; California's .rooters piled
onto the field, ready to flaunt their
colors in a raging serpentine.
And then came the news that all was
not yet lost. Hack into the bleachers
crept the anxious Berkeley yell-lead
ers, and after then a worried band of
California rooters. The Blue and Gold
broad jumpers were losing out, was
the startling intelligence imparted to
the beachers. Sisson is ahead, if he
ran keep the lead we'll tie the meet.
Templeton has a chance to take third,
will he come through?
Down; the runway darted Temple
ton, the coolest man in all that throng.
The Cardinal hopes depended upon his
ability to cover 22 feet in his final
1 cap. Living up to his reputation of
the champion upsetter of dope, Ric
cleared the mark. Inside of two min
utes every Stanford rooter was on the
field, each intent on properly christ
ening the new oval. A glorious
christening it was, and all due to the
determined band of Stanford athletes
who transfonned what seemed to be
inevitable defeat into hard-earned itnd
will-deserved victory.
"The day was chilly at the very out
set of thr> meet. A flight haze rested
over Berkeley hills. A cold penetrat
ing breeze swept the oval, stiffening
; the athletes, and precluding all

chances of establishing any records.
The vast crowds stirred with eager
ness and expectancy. The meet would
be close; every eye followed the move
ments of the waiting athletes as they
paced nervously up and down the oval.
The Cardinal entered the meet pro
per with a decided handicap, as all
three places in the hammer throw had
gone to the Californians. The mile ev
ened things up a bit. Thanks to Skin
Wilson's watchful manoeuvering, Aup
perle broke down the Berkeley dope in
the event by worsting Burgess for sec
ond place with yards to spare.
Lachmund justified the Cardinal
predictions by running Stanton to a
close finish in the century. Three
more points. Preble then took it upon
himself to shatter all dope in the high
sticks by beating out Feg Murray for
first place. The California man gain
ed a big lead at the start, and main
tained it to the tape, although Feg
made a gallant effort to catch him on
the final sprint.
Derrol Chace then electrified the
bleachers by vanquishing the much;
touted Todd in the quarter mile dash.
Wright Lynn performed a notable
sacrifice by winding the Blue and Gold
man in the first three hundred yards.
On the home stretch Chace caught the
flying runners, and won handily by
-oven yards in the fast time of 50 3-5

Chapman practically worried him

Lloyd, who passed the lanky Freshman
on th" home stretch, thereby taking
s-cond to Vedder's notable time of 9:

four stars. The'.Stanford captain was

form that distinguished his running

The low hurdles were easily won by
Feg Murray, who came back in his ac

race with Hodge of California. Otto
Lachmund forced Eddie Stanton to the
limit in the furlong, pacing him neck
and neck for the first 175 yards. Mur
ray proved his endurance powers by
spr'nting into third place, although he
had had no time to rest from the low
hurdles grind.
The pole vault brought out another
disheartening surprise for the wearers
of tho Blue and Gold. Nichols, who
had been slated to reach a height of
13 feet by Coach Christie, did not fig

shiver in the Stanford ranks, when he
lost third place to Liversedge.
The high jump turned the tide in fa
vor of the Cardinal. Nichols. McFie,
Maker and Airola all went down to
defeat before Ric Templeton, whose
leap of 6 feet 1 1-8 inches brought five
"points from Heaven" to swell the
Stanford total. Dykes and Wheatly

Hill Sisson and Ric Templeton forced
the Blue and Gold rooters back
into their seats by taking first

Tho agile Sophomore covered 22
feet 9 inches in his try for five
points and the wiry Templeton gave
a good exhibition of his versatility by
jumping 22 feet in the effort to cap
ture the extra point, and with it the
meet. The relay went in 3 minutes

at the tape by a hair's breadth.
