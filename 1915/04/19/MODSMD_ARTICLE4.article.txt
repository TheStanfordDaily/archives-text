# SORORITY LIMITATION VETOED BY CONFERENCE
## WOMEN REPEAL FORMER RULING AS NOT BEING JUST AND FAIR. NO RESTRICTION UPON NUMBER 
### 
Women's Conference passed a rill
ing which repeals the regulation lim
iting the number of Greek letter fra
ternities among the women to eight
at a special meeting yesterday morn
ing. This action came as the result
of long discussion as to the fairness
and justness of the ruling. ,
The repealed ruling p,a,ssed in
1911 by the Women's Council of which
Miss Nina Moise, as president of Wo
men's Conference, was chairman. It
was then agreed that two hundred and
fifty of the five hundred Stanford wo
men was the limiting number which
might become members of a sorority.
The number of sororities was limited
to eight and in that way was agreed
that neither the sorority nor non-sor
oritv group should hold the balance of
power. The Council at that time was
composed of three non-sorority and
two sorority women and it was felt
that the ruling was passed by and for
the protection of the non-sorority wo
men. It also aimed to check the in
creasing number of Greek letter mem
bers among the "five hundred" and to
preserve the spirit of democracy
among the women of the University.
The recent addition of the chapter of
Chi Omega to the ranks of Greek let
ter fraternities for women has increas
ed the number of sororities to nine,
with one House Club on the Campus.
At present, there are 264 members of
sororities, including the members of
Mariposa Club.
It is argued that the spirit of the
ruling has already been broken, that
House Clubs since they elect their own
members are practically Greek letter
fraternities in everything but name,
and therefore any House Club which
is now in existence or which miiht
be formed in the future should have
the privilege of petitioning for a na
tional charter from a Greek letter
fraternity for women-
It. is further stated that the arbi
trary division of the women students
in Stanford with the two hundred aid
fifty limit creates a priviliged class
which has an opportunity to perpet
uate itself. As such it becomes a
privilege which non-sorority women
covet and by .repealing the ruling
which was in force the tendency to any
clnss distinction' will be removen and
consequently will cease to be so
greatly desired among non-sorority
members.
The present Women's Conference is
composed of fifteen women of which
three are non-sorority members, one
a member of a House Club, and elev
en sorority members.
Among the advisory members of the
Conference the sentiment was. strongly
in favor of repealing the existing rul
ing.

The repealed ruling p,a,ssed in
1911 by the Women's Council of which
Miss Nina Moise, as president of Wo
men's Conference, was chairman. It
was then agreed that two hundred and
fifty of the five hundred Stanford wo
men was the limiting number which
might become members of a sorority.
The number of sororities was limited
to eight and in that way was agreed
that neither the sorority nor non-sor
oritv group should hold the balance of
power. The Council at that time was
composed of three non-sorority and
two sorority women and it was felt
that the ruling was passed by and for
the protection of the non-sorority wo
men. It also aimed to check the in
creasing number of Greek letter mem
bers among the "five hundred" and to
preserve the spirit of democracy
among the women of the University.
The recent addition of the chapter of
Chi Omega to the ranks of Greek let
ter fraternities for women has increas
ed the number of sororities to nine,
with one House Club on the Campus.
At present, there are 264 members of
sororities, including the members of
Mariposa Club.
It is argued that the spirit of the
ruling has already been broken, that
House Clubs since they elect their own
members are practically Greek letter
fraternities in everything but name,
and therefore any House Club which
is now in existence or which miiht
be formed in the future should have
the privilege of petitioning for a na
tional charter from a Greek letter
fraternity for women-
It. is further stated that the arbi
trary division of the women students
in Stanford with the two hundred aid
fifty limit creates a priviliged class
which has an opportunity to perpet
uate itself. As such it becomes a
privilege which non-sorority women
covet and by .repealing the ruling
which was in force the tendency to any
clnss distinction' will be removen and
consequently will cease to be so
greatly desired among non-sorority
members.
The present Women's Conference is
composed of fifteen women of which
three are non-sorority members, one
a member of a House Club, and elev
en sorority members.
Among the advisory members of the
Conference the sentiment was. strongly
in favor of repealing the existing rul
ing.
