It was a meet that will long be re
membered. The dramatic finish was
not as thrilling as that of two years
ago, but the breathless suspense was
every bit as acute. And the value of
the victory was increased a hundred
fold in view of the fact that Califor
nia rooters had been so impetuous as
to start a serpentine on their own
oval before the final score had been
ascertained.
To the Stanford athletes goes the
appreciation of every loyal under
graduate and graduate. And they es
pecially are deserving of the highest
praise when we stop to consider the
uphill fight which our men made
throughput the meet, and only clinched
victory by virtue of the unconquerable
spirit which fights harder when los
ing than when victory is assured.
In this atmosphere of victory we
are too prone to consider only the
point winners who made good in the
meet and not to consider the men who
fought a losing race every inch of the
way in their respective events. We
do not stop to think of the men who
worked out daily for three months and
made a winning aggregation possible,
although, they were, not included
among the contestants in the inter
collegiato. meet. Don't forget the
other fellow who labored all season,
although his chances were negligible,
and made a winning team possible.
