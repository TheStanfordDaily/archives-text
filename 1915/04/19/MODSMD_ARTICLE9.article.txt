# THE
						DECIDING BALLOT
## 
### 
A special, election has been called
tomorrow to decide Stanford's stand
in regard to the intercollegiate agree
ment. Every student should cast a
ballot ofl. the t\yo issues which are be
fore tho Student Body. The first
proposition will be the one submitted
by California, namely that Freshmen
shall be abolished from varsity inter
collegiate competition. The second

one will bo the proposition proposed
by Stanford that the settlement of
i â– 
intercollegiate difficulles be submitted
to a non-partisan board of arbitration.
The students have expressed them
selves heretofore as absolutely op
posed to the first proposition and
therefore will vote "No" on Califor
nia's proposal.
The plan for arbitrating the inter
collegiate differences seems the only
plausible way of arriving at some set
tlement. It is the onjy fair and just
method* and as such should be sup
parted by the Stanford Student Itody.
