REMEMBER
The price you paid for those tires
which are now tread-worn and use
less. Don't throw them away, send
them to the Oakland Tire Co., 2413
Bartlett street, Oakland, California,
who pay express charges and who
will rebuild them and make them
better than ever at approximately
half the original cost. By their
method of reinforcing and replacing
the worn tread with leather and
rivets, which will wear from 5000
to 10,000 miles, the tire will be re
turned to you guaranteed Puncture
Proof, retreaded, reinforced and re
lined, having three times the orig
inal strength to withstand the
rough road. Adv.
