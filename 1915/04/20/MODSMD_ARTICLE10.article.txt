# ARBITRATION OF ISSUE ADOPTED BY STANFORD
## California Plan Rejected By Large Majority HEAVY VOTE IS POLLED Next Move in Intercollegiate Crisis Rests With State University, Which Has Not Yet Acted 
### 
Stanford voted overwhelmingly
against adopting the agreement pro
posals made by California and decided
in favor of arbitrating the differences
I etween the two universities by an
almost equally decisive vote in the
balloting today. The vote on the Cali
fornia proposal stood 51 for adoption
and 112 against. On the arbitration
question the vote was 394 in favor and
SO against—a majority of five to one
in favor of arbitration.
With this act on on the part of Stan
ford it will now be necessary for the
Associated Students at California to
take some action on the question of
arbitration. The agreement com
mittee of the State University has de
clared themselves opposed to this
method of settlement and state that
the student body will back them in
their stand but the students have
never been given an opportunity to
make any official expression ot opin
ion in the matter.
With a very few exceptions the
votes cast in favor of adopting the
California proposal also carried a
"Yes" on the question of arbitrating.
Since the two propositions were mu
tually exclusive these ballots car.
hardly be counted of importance in
the voting. They go to how
ever that most of the eighty students
who voted against arbitrating also
voted against adopting the California
nroposals and that their position was
in favor of standing out for Fresh
man participation to the point of
breaking relations.
Since many of the voters expressed
their opinion on only one of the pro
positions on the ballot the total num
ber of ballots cast was considerably
~r°ater than is shown by the vote on
either of the propositions.
