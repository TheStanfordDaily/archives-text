# DEMOCRATIC SPIRIT
## 
### 
The Women's Conference has very
wisely rescinded the ruling which lim
ited the number of sororities on the
campus to eight. The ruling has be
come inoperative because it was un
just and unfair. It took away the
personal rights and liberties of some
of the women against whom the under
graduates have no right to discrimin
inate.
The paramount reason for passing
this rule in the first place was to
make it impossible for either sorority
or non-sorority women to hold the bal
ance of power. Surely, there should be
no need for a ruling based on such a
reason. There should be no line of
demarcation between sorority and non
so.rority women. If some of the wom
en feel that there is a difference in
caste now is the time to get rid of
such notions. And the Women's Con
ference has taken a very thoughful
step to dispell this feeling by rescind
ing the ruling, and proving to all the
women in years to come that this
idea is absolutely without founda
tion.
Certainly, the ruling is not requir
ed when elections are taken into con
sideration. No women on the campus
is so narrow that she would vote for
a sorority woman in place of a non
sorority women if the latter person
were the better candidate for an of
fice. It is to be hoped that women
will never allow political aspirations
to control their elections. The demo
cratic spirit should be the same with
the women as with the men. This
spirit is the pride of the University,
and as such should be fostered by all.
After all each and every one is here
with the same hopes, same ambitions,
and same purposes to secure from this
institution a broad knowledge. It is
our part in turn to maintain the demo
cratic spirit which has long been a
cherished tradition.
