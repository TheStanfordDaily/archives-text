# SENIOR PICNIC
## 
### 
The Seniors will Rather in the final
informal get-together of their college
career tomorrow afternoon. It hardly
seems necessary to urge members of

the graduating class to attend the pic-
I
nic which has been planned. It is an
opportunity for renewing old acquain
tances and for meeting members of
the class whom you do not know. Ev
ery member of the class should know
every other member. The Senior pic
nic is the best, way of solving the
problem. Let all the Seniors be
there.
