# OLD HERMIT GOES TO LAST RESTING PLACE
## Domingo Grasso, Who Died Friday in San Mateo Hospital is Buried Today. 
### 
Domingo Grasso, hermit of the Por
tola hills, and a character known on
the campus ever since the founding of
the University, was buried this after
noon from the residence of Frank
Brecisco, in Menlo Park, where the old
man was brought after his death Sun
day evening at the San Mateo county
hospital.
The hermit was taken to the hospi
tal Friday afternoon by Mrs. Frank
Mrecisco with the aid of a Palo Alto
delivery clerk.
When brought into the hospital the
old man was paralyzed, but maintain
ed stoutly that he was not sick. He
sank rapidly, and soon lapsed into un
consciousness, from which he awaken
ed but once before passing away at
7:15 Sunday evening. On Sunday
morning he regained consciousness
for a fsw minutes.
He did not talk during his illness,
maintaining the silence that has been
characteristic of him for a decade. His
past is vague: the generally accepted
history of Domingo Grasso is that he
was brought to California as a vine
yard expert over 35 years ago. While
working in the Portola hills he discov
ered gold, and after that devoted the
greater part of his life to "mining."
Funeral expenses are being defray
ed by Mrs. Brecisco, but it is expected
that assistance will be rendered by
people of San Mateo and Santa Clara
counties.
