## Freshman Searches in Vain for New Golden Fleece. 
### 
Listen, ye diamond fans, to the
very latest!
(Jus Hoever and Charlie Austin,
buullying Sophomores, yesterday af
ternoon sent one of their vassal
Freshmen surnamed Donald McKee,
brother of last year's track captain,
on a sacred mission to discover the
whereabouts of a new Golden Fleece.
The sealed orders follow: Bring us
the Key to the Pitcher's Box, then
find the left field foul line, roll it up,
and deliver it in person!
Donald, being a willing fan. went
straight to Captain Workman. Tim
othy regretfully stated that he knew
not where the missing articles were
located, but referred the knight er
rant to Mr. McCloskey. Peter stopped
batting Hies on the Deke lawn long
enough to tell the struggling lad that
the foul line hung already rolled up
on Wobbles Stafford's door knoh,
while the key lay in the left back cor
ner in his bottom bureau drawer.
Upon interviewing the bald-headed
second baseman, Donald was in
formed that Mr. McCloskey enter
ta'ned an erroneous conception, but
that Russ Downing no doubt had both
the articles in his possession Ttnss
stopped brushing his dress-suit, in
preparation for the trip to Honolulu,
to refer the deluded youth to Jeff
Landers. Johnny interrupted his
game of craps and obligingly told
Donald the number of Bill Noonan's j
room. Upon getting in touch with
the Spider Outfielder, both Bill and
Donald searched the room in vain.
Neither the Key nor the Foul Line
could be found. Bill then cognosti
cated to the Freshman that probably
Sam McDonald in Mayfield or else
â€¢Mush Stevens in Palo Alto might un
puzzle the puzzling puzzle.
Donald, weary, footstore, hungry,
and pessimistic, sat down on the bed
and tried to solve the riddle in his
quandry. For two hours he had been
on the trail of the elusive, and al
ways just out of his grasp! He
would call up Gus or Charlie and ask
if he might stop looking long enough
to eat dinner. Over the wire he heard
the mincing words stated with innate
disgust, "You boob!"
Donald fainted.
