Freshmen surnamed Donald McKee,
brother of last year's track captain,
on a sacred mission to discover the
whereabouts of a new Golden Fleece.

find the left field foul line, roll it up,

Donald, being a willing fan. went

the foul line hung already rolled up
on Wobbles Stafford's door knoh,
while the key lay in the left back cor

that Russ Downing no doubt had both
the articles in his possession Ttnss
