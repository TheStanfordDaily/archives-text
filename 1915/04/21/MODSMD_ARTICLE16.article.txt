# PETTY LARCENY

### 
Many cases of thievery on the cam
pus have occurred during the last few
weeks. It is not the type concerned
with large robberies but rather with
the stealing of small articles. On
every hand one hears of some one los
ing notebooks which have been left
on the Quad, various articles of cloth
ing, money, jewelry, track tickets, and
sundry utilities of various descrip
tions. This is nothing more nor less
than petty larceny. It is hard to con
ceive of university students stooping
to a level to commit such offenses. It
is difficult to understand how any per
sons from outside the University can
come on the campus, commit the act,
and not be caught. Apparently it is
a mania to steal which has overcome
certain individuals.
In order to put a stop to this petty
larceny which has invaded the campus
it would be advisable for the mem
bers of the campus community to keep
everything under lock and key until
the mania has disappeared or the cul
prits are caught. It seems almost ab
surd to have to take such a step when
we have always felt that our posses
sions were safe wherever they might
be on the campus, but self-protection
is apparently the only way of elim
inating the nuisance.
