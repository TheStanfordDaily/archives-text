# HIGH-BROWISM
## 
### 
Unfortunately, many members of
this community are laboring under a
perverted notion of high-browism.
They disdain to accept the elevating
and cultivating things of life for the
reason that they will he considered
high-brows. They hesitate to broad
en their horizon of thought for the
reason that their friends may get a
wrong impression of their good inten
tions. How few appreciate listening
to a good concert or attending an art
exhibit! And if they do appreciate it,
they would not dare to go because
their actions would border on those
of a high brow. Ask a person if he
has read a certain work of philosophi
cal purport, and his looks will betray
his answer.
Presumably, a college education is

to broaden a man's viewpoint in as
many fields as possible. So many at
Stanford cringe from such a thought.
They prefer to limit their sphere of
knowledge and endeavors in order
that they will not be considered in the
class with the high-brows. They do
not stop to consider that the high
brows are the ones who limit their
field of endeavor and consider them
selves apart and better than the gen
eral run of humanity. Let us learn to
appreciate that which is uplifting and
strive for the higher things, rather
than look at them from afar and with
disdain.
