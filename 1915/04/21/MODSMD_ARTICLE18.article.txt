A Forum For Stanford 3Ien.
April 20, 1915.
To the Editor:
The universities of America are fre
quently accused of being so isolated
from the world of affairs that the men
whom they graduate do not fit into the
conditions of actual life. Surely, if a
university training is to he justified
from a practical standpoint, it must at
least equip its students to discharge
intelligently the ordinary duties of
American citizenship. To b.ring the
matter directly home, how many Stan
ford students are there who ever give
a serious thought to the questions
which are now challenging the atten
tion of the nation and the world, and
in the solution of which they must
soon take some part If they are not
to shirk their civic duty? It is a fact
that in many cases the university stu
dent might as well spend four years of
his life within the padded cell of a
jail or the cloisters of a monastery in
sofar as any real comprehension of the
problems of the outside world is con
cerned.
There is only one remedy for such
a situation. If students are to appre
ciate the civic issues of the day, they
must be given an opportunity to dis
cuss such matters in an informal, nat
ural way. This is accomplished in
other universities through. a students'
forum which meets, say, once a month
ifor the discussion of some important
issue, which may range from the
right of Great Britain to search Ameri
can ships for contraband of war to the
removal of the Stanford statue f.rom
the Memorial Court. Tt makes no dif
ference whether the matter is local or
international so long as it is worthy of
the attention of university men. The
forum should be open to all men of
the university without the payment of
any dues, and should be in charge of
a board of student directors represent
ing all departments of the university.
These directors elect a chairman to
preside over the monthly meetings, se
lect the topic for discussion, and re
quest one or more students to present
a paper or a short talk upon that top
ic, after which it is thrown open to the
forum for discussion, and any man pre
sent may express his opinion in a talk
not to exceed five minutes in length.
The famous "Oxford Union" some
times varies its program by inviting
some such man as Lloyd George to ad
dress it on a great political or social
issue, and the speaker (no matter if he
be the Premier of England) must de
fend his opinions against the incisive
thrusts of the Oxford students.
There is only one valid reason why
such a plan might not succeed at Stan
ford, â€”that Stanford students have less
brains than the men of Oxford or of
other American universities. The
writer will not believe it. Of course,
some might urge that students who are
interested in civic matters now have
plenty of opportunity to attend lec
tures or join one of the literary socie
ties. and that there arc too many or
ganizations on the Campus to permit
the formation of another. However,
educational lectures present, but one
speaker's viewpoint, and they wholly
lack the informality and free exchange
of opinion made possible by a students'

forum. As for the literary societies,
their best friends (for whom the
writer has some claim to be one)
must admit that their scope is limited
to the students of the Law and Econ
omics departments, there being one
sole Engineer in both societies put to
gether. Probably many students who
fight shy of a formal debate would
gladly welcome an opportunity to
stand up on their hind legs and ex
press their views in a plain, straight
forward way before their fellow stu
dents. Lastly, the fact that Stanford
now suffers from too many organiza
tions is the best possible reason for
combining in one big university
gathering the small discussion groups
which now meet once a week, and sev
eral of which (including the literary
societies) have expressed their wn
lingness to discontinue one of their
weekly meetings in order to join the
rest of the university family in the
Stanford students' forum. Let us per
fect our plans now, fo that next sem
ester may find the students' forum
.ready to do its share in shaping a life
of broader civic service for the average
Stanford man.
Respectfully submitted.
