# Thoughtless Vandalism Is Expense to University
## 
### 
Business Manager Stow has asked
the cooperation of Conference mem
bers in eliminating certain small nui
sances about the campus.
Otis H. Castle, '14, president of the
Conference, has sent out a letter to the
members of the Conference asking
their cooperation in bringing this mat
ter to the attention of the students.
The letter, in part, follows:
"There seems to be an epidemic of
petty thievery at Stanford. In par
ticular, University property in the
form of electric bulbs is being
taken from the Library and other
places. Mr. Stow believes that inso
far as this is done by students it is
due to thoughtlessness and lack of
realization that they are thereby indi
rectly adding to the general expenses
of education; and he thinks that mem
bers of the Conference could be influ
ential in bringing about a proper at
titude on the question. It also ap
pears that pebbles are being thrown
at the newly hung chimes. This
thing should be easy to handle when
the men are shown that even a light
blow may seriously injure one of these
hells."
