# WIDENING OF INDUSTRIAL SERVICE IS CONSIDERED
## 
### 
An extensive expansion of the Y. M. jl
C. A. industrial service in neighboring I
towns, including the organization of j j
boy scout troops, coaching of gram- j |
mar school athletics, and the teach- i
ing of English to foreigners, is being j
planned by the Stanford branch of the j
Association for the coming year. Sec- |
retary E. H. Lockwood expects to have
at least fifty men ( in the field under
the direction of P. D. Davis, '17.
During the past college year two
boy scout troops in Menlo Park and
one in Palo Alto were started, while
the Redwood "corps" was aided mater
ially; twenty men were taught the ru
diments of the English language in an
evening school organized in Redwood
City, and the athletes of the Mayfield
primary school were coached in sever
al branches of sport.
Y. M. C. A. industrial service is to
be extended along the same lines as
during past years, but on a larger
scale. There is quite a demand for
college men who will offer their as
sistance in coaching grammar-school
boys in athletics.
A new a.rm of the industrial service
w'll come into existence a year from
the coming summer, if plans mater
ialize for a vacation camp for "prep"
school graduates. With the purpose in
view of enlightening prospective Stan
ford men as to the ideals of the Univer
sity, and to enable the incoming Fresh
man to put at least one foot "on the
boat," the Y. M. C. A. will organize
a summer camp for those who have
expressed their intention of casting
their lot with the Cardinal.
