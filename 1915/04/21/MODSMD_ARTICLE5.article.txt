# TWO POUGHKEEPSIE CREWS MAY ENTER PACIFIC REGATTAS
## Lack of Funds Delaying Plans For Sending Stanford Eights to Compete in East TO BE DISCUSSED TONIGHT 
### 
The question of sending the Stanford
crew to the Washington and Pough
keepsie regattas will come before the
Executive Committee at its regular
meeting this evening. Whether the
vars'ty will enter either or both of
these races will be considered at this
meeting.
Washington has extended an invita
tion to the varsity and Freshman
eights to enter a race with their crews
at Seattle on May 15. A contest on
that date is entirely impractical how
ever as it would give the Stanford
crews only one week in which to
train and make the trip after the close
of the examinations, with no chance to
practice during examination week.
The Poughkeepsie regatta will be
lield on .June 28. This will give the
varsity ample time to get into train
ing again and to go East after the
i finals. About $2,000 was required to
make the trip in 1912. Graduate Man
! ager Wilcox states that it will be im
| possible to provide this amount out of
th regular athletic funds, and it will
be necessary for the Executive Com
mittee to find some ether means of
raising the money if it is dceided to
send the crew East.
It is impossible to tall whether
Stanford will enter the Seattle and
San Francisco regattas later in the
year, should the eastern university
crews be brought to the Coast fo.r com
petition. All of the eastern crews have
been invited and $9,000 is practically
assured from the exposition officials
and the University of Washington Un
ion to pay the expenses of the winner
of the Harvard, Yale, Princeton regatta
! and the winner and second place crew
in the Poughkeepsie regatta. Syra
| cuse, Cornell and Pennsylvania, all
I Porghkeepsie entries, have expressed a
i tentative consent to make the trip in
case they qualify.
The regatta on Lake Washington,
Seattle, will he held from July 12 to
17. and the Exposition race will he
staged somewhere about the Bay on
July 24. These dates are two months
after Stanford closes and it may be dif-
Jfeu 1 1 to keep the Stanford eight to
! gother that long for training since it
j is absolutely necessary in the case of
i some of the men that they get worn
I for the summer.
