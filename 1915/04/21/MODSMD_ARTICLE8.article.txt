# OLYMPICS VICTORIOUS OVER INDOOR SOCCERITES
## Combination Plays by Visiting Team Baffle Efforts of Stanford Players. 
### 
A defeat by a 10 to 6 score at the
I hands of the Olympic Club was
1 chalked up against the Stanford in
door soccer team in the contest held
last evening in Encina Gymnasium.
At the close of the first half the mark
stood G to 4 in favor of the Olympics
and they continued to gain steadily in
the second half. Their success was
attributed to the operation of clever
combination plays which the Cardinal
players were unable to withstand.
The Stanford lineup was as follows:
forwards, S. R. Pellas, '13 (captain),
A. L. E.rb, '15, and W. B. Blodget, '15;
goal, E. T. Dutton, '15; fullback, L. R.
Reynolds, '15; substitute, E. D.
Kneass, 'IS.
