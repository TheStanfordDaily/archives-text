# BACK TO POUGHKEEPSIE
## 
### 
It was definitely decided by the
Executive Committee last evening to
send the champion crew of the Pa
cific Coast back to Poughkeepsie to
endeavor to wipe out the defeat which
was chalked against the 1912 crew.
Stanford is represented this year by
an eight which knows no peer west
of the lloeky Mountains, and as such
has certainly earned a right to repre
sent the Pacific Coast in the classic
of American regattas.
But to send a crew to the Hudson
will need mo.re than mere enthusiasm.
It will need financial support. The
Student Body has started the fund by
appropriating $1,000 toward the neces
sary $2,800. It will be necessary for
the students, friends and alumni to
appropriate the remainder. This is
decidedly a worth-while proposition.
It is something to which every student
should want to contribute at least
something in order to insure the suc
cess of the trip. When plans for sub
scriptions have been perfected and
the canvass of the campus has start
ed, remember that your share consists
in the greatest amount that you can
afford to contribute. Back to Pough
keepsie!
