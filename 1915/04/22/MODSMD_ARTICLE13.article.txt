the Olympic Club, which also stands
as a Pacific Coast record; R. R.
Caughey's distance of 47 feet in the
shot-put, made in the interclass meet;
srd L. L. Chapman's time of 9:58.4
for the two-mile event, also made in

in the two-mile run was 9:58.1, and
v;as credited to F. L Foster, '13, but
owing to the new measurement, Chap
man ran 12 yards farther than Foster
and so the discrepancy in time is more
than made up by the added distance.
