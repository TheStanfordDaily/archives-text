# BACK TO POUGHKEEPSIE—CREW WILL ROW ON HUDSON
## Executive Committee Sanctions Trip and Appropriates Thousand Dollars if Remainder of Fund Is Raised by Subscription 
### 
The Cardinal will be waving on the
Hudson next summer and the husky
Stanford eight which cleaned up the
Coast regatta will appear in the race
at Poughkeepsie. The Executive
Committee passed a resolution last
night to send the crew to the eastern
regatta and appropriated $1,000 to
finance the trip.
Coach Guerena appeared before the
Committee and stated his reasons foi
wanting to take the crew to Pough
keepsie, and, without his urging fi
nancial support, the student body of
ficers were not slow to see the advan
tages of the trip and give official sanc
tion.
About $2,800 will be needed and
$1,800 remains to be raised. This will
be secured by subscriptions from the
students on the campus, from alumni
particularly the associations in Los
Angeles, San Francisco and New York,
and from friends of the University.
There is one source in the latter class
from which a generous contribution is
practically assured. The men on the
crew constitute the personnel of the
committee which will be in charge of
ra'sing the money during the remain
der of the semester. After they go in
to active training, immediately follow
ing examinations, the work will be tak
en ove.r by a sub-committee.
Twelve men will take the trip
East —the nine men on the crew, two
substitutes, and the coach. It is pos
sible that a manager will also go al
ong. Graduate Manager Wilcox will
go to Honolulu with the baseball team,
but if thought advisable later in the
sason, crew manager Jeffers will ac
company the Stanford men East to
look after the shell and other equip
ment.
Stanford will take its own shell, the
new Ward boat, to Poughkeepsie. Tt is
built especially for a husky crew, and
th; Stanford men will feel sure.r of a
win when seated in the boat they are
accustomed to.
Two reasons were advanced why the
student body should send the crew to
Poughkeepsie th's year. As Pacific
Coast champions they should go back

to represent the Univers'ties of the
coast in the biggest intercollegiate re
gatta in America. When the Stanford
eight made the trip three years ago it
was understood then that they were
starting a precedent which would he
followed by each winner of the tri
angular regatta. Washington, winner
in '13 and '14, has followed this prece
dent and has been a contender on the
Hudson for the past two years.
The second reason is that Stanford
craws have rather a bad reputation to
be 1 ved down in the East following
the 1912 trial and there is a crew
this year which promises to make an
especially good reputation. Coach
Guerena is very desirous of wiping out
the adverse record and sincerely be
lieves bo has eight men this year who
can do it.
Dope bears him out in this for Stan
ford undoubtedly has a better crew
than ever before. Thsy defeated
Washington tlrs year, and in doing
this bested the premier crew which
has ever been put on the water, ac
cording to tli3 avowal of coach Coni
bear. Washington took third and
fourth place in 1914 and 1913 respec
tively and finished only a length and
a quarter and three lengths behind
the winner for the two years. If this
northern eight is the best ever, and
followers of the sport believe it Is
Stanford with their length and a halt
win. stand a better chance than Wash
ington has ever had to clean up in the
East.
Hiram Conibear was confident of a
victory on the coast and intended to
take his men back to sweep the east
ern waters. Washington had six veter
ans:, including two ex-captains, in their
boat. Zimmerman, who rowed No. 8
had stroked two Poughkeepsie .races,
and Paul Hammer had steered a
course on the Hudson. Conibear had a
right to be confident, and expected to
go East as champions, but Stanford
upset the dope. Ex-Captain Wallei
said to Coach Guerena after the race.
"You've got a good crew, old man, ana
I hope you go East," and that meant
a lot.
Husky Guerena is confident of being

able to overcome *he difficulties which
caused the defeat of the Stanford men
in 1912. Only ten men took that trip
and no coach accompanied. The coach
ing committee knew nothing of condi
tions there. They we.re swamped with
advice on their arrival and from the
conflicting testimony decided that the
best thing to do would be to train as
they were accustomed to on the coast.
They rowed in the morning as they
had at Redwood and the heat and hu
midity proved too much for them. The
diet followed was the same as that us
ed on the coast and there was no
change to meet the new conditions.
Guerena, who took the trip as coxs
wain, understands eastern conditions
better now. lie has also secured
many valuable pointers from Coach
Conibear which have been learned in
the latter's two trips. He believes that
the men will be in the best condition
on the day of the race, instead of a
week before as on the previous trip.
Stanford covered Poughkeepsie course
in better time than the winners of the
raco a few days before the contest but
went stale and were unable to repeat
their performance.
The crew will train at. Redwood for
practically five weeks after college
closes and will leave the campus on
June 14. They will arrive at Pough
keepsie on the 18th. This will give
six days light training before the race
on June 26 and wil be ample time to
take the train stiffness out of their
limbs, but will not be long enough to
cause the men to be effected by the
climate. Three years ago the crew
trained on the course for seventeen
days before the regatta.
All of the men who rowed the Coast
Regatta will be eligible in the At
a meeting yesterday afternoon, they
were all enthusiastic about the t.rip
and expressed their intention of going
if sanction was given by the Executive
Committee.
It. is not certain, but is very probable
hit after rowing at Poughkeepsie, th
crew will come back and enter the re
gatta cn Lake Washington, Seattle, on
July 17, and the Expos'tion regatta on
.Tulv 24.
