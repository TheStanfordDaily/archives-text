# Maloney Abandons Post of Stanford Athletic Trainer
## 
### 
Harry Wilfred Maloney, trainer of
Stanford athletic teams, officially ten
dered his resignation from this po3i
tion last evening. This resignation
was accepted by t lie Executive Com
mittee, and a sincere vote of thanks
was unanimously passed for his effi
cient services in the last two years.
Maloney w'll pursue a medical
course at Stanford, ultimately aiming
for the degree of M. D. and the pres
sure of his studies will make it im
possible for him to retain the position
of trainer. Work at the track and
football quarters is too confining tc>
permit of his carrying both at the
same time.
The former trainer will, however,
continue at Stanford University in the
capacity of assistant to Dr. H. R.
Stt lz. '00, director of the gymnasium.
Students fc.-l that, his presence wl'l
<erve greatly to aid the pfforts of bis
successor, and Maloney's interest in
Stanford athletics can not help but*
benetit future teams.
Since hia nstallation in the fall of
191J5 Hs Stanford trainer, Maloney has
proved a useful, active, and efficient
trainer, combining the qualities of sin
cere interest and clean sportsman
ship in his handling of the athletes un
der his care. His facility in getting
the men "into the pink of condition"
just preceding any contest of impor
tance is well known to Campus fans,
and his patience and skill have bred
a spirit of loyalty to him in every
athlete who has ever benefitted from
his medical aid.
Maloney accompanied the track
teaman its tour of the Middle West
last summer, and was an invaluable
asset to the travelers. He has presi
ded at six training tables, and has
turned out a majority of winning
teams, whose success was in a great
measure due to his ability as a train
er. In his resignation, the Student
Body loses the services of an earnest,
skillful worker.
