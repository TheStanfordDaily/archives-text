R. R. Templeton, '15, was chosen
Stanford track captain for the season
of 1910 by the members of the squad,
who gathered at Pop Franklin's Stu
dio this afternoon for their annual
group picture. Templeton's upsetting

won by a fil 1-. r > to (!0 4-F> margin, Ric

Maker and Jackson. This addition of
five unlooked-for points was really
the turning-point in the tide of Stan

the broad jump, in which he took
third, and with it the point that meant
victory for the Cardinal team, is now
one of the most famous episodes of
Stanford athletic history.
