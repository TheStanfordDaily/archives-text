The Executive
Committee has
made ampie pro
vision for the
success of next
year's squad, if
the offer is ac
cepted.
it has been ru
mored about the
c a m)) us that
Coach Campbell
had tilled his hist
coaching term at
Stanford, and if
this rumor is
founded on fact,
its to be hoped
that he will re-

consider his decision.
His ability first manifested itself on
the track during his captaincy in 191"..
He proved to he an effective and capa
ble leader, and his guidance contribut
ed in no small measure to the Stanford
victory that year. His powers as a
sprinter were amply proved in tint
meet by his aggregate of 8 points—
first in the 2L'O yard dash and second
to McKee in the lftO yard dash.
He assumed the .responsibility of an
unsalaried student coach in 1914 a-d


Couch < iiin
guided his men to a decisive victory,
contributing, himself, 11 points to the
Stanford total by winning both the 220
yard dash and the 440 yard dash and
taking third in the century. Inciden
tally, he tied the intercollegiate rec
ord of 22 flat in the furlong, and dur
ing the year established the following
Stanford marks —:10 in the 100 yard
dash, :21 4-5 in the 220 yard dash, and
:49.4 in the 440 yard dash.
This year he again took up the posi
tion of coach this time at a salary, and
again he developed an all-around team
from a nucleus of selected veterans.
His record for sportsmanship and effi
ciency is unexcelled, and every true
Stanford fan is waiting for a favorable
.reply to the offer of last evening.
