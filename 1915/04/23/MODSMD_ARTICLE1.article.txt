The crew men are enthusiastic
about the trip and are going back
with a determination to make good
and prove that Stanford can produce
a crew that can win in the East. The
1912 aggregation left a splendid re;>
utation for western sportsmanship,
and the eight which makes the tii;>
this yea." will be receiv d with favor
on account < it, but their record for
the race is poor and Coach Guerena's
men hr,pc to blot out the past.
