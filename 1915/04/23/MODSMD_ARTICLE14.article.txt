News was received late this after
noon that the student body of the Uni
versity of California passed a resolu
tion today to sever intercollegiate re
lations with Stanford until an agree
ment between the universities con
tain the condition that Freshmen be
abolished from varsity competition.
r l his action was taken without con
sidering the proposition to arbitrate
the differences between the two uni
versities which was submitted by
Stanford as a solution of the inter
collegiate difficulties.
We are very sorry to know that the
California student body took this
stand and do not believe that they
voted on the subject intelligently and
with their eyes open, but .rather were
influenced to take the present stand.
Human nature, whether at California
or Stanford, is the same through and
through. The student body, taken as
a whole, is not so narrow that it could
not see that there are two sides to the
( us ton, 112 both sides had been pre
i ted to the students assembled en
masse. We cannot help but believe
that California has weakened her
principles by not being willing to ar
bitrate. If they believed so sincerely
in their principles it seems natural
that they would have been willing to
put the question before an arbitration
board and felt sure that the board
would decide in their favor. We be
lieve that the California Agreement
Committee was sincere in its stand,
but that a few individuals at the state
institution have not been sincere in
their presentation of the question of
Freshman elimination to the student
body.
We know that the members of the
California student body have been led
to believe that Stanford subsidizes
some of her athletes. As long as such
a feeling exists and is fostered on the
Berkeley campus it is impossible that
they should be able to consider the
question from an unprejudiced stand
poi nt.
ft is hoped that the California stu
dent body will reconsider its action
and that a settlement will be reached

before another athletic season rolls
around. Hack to Poughkeepsie!
