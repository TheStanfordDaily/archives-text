During the last few years it has
heen the custom for Encina Club to
entertain members of the track team
at an annual Track Encina. This
dance will be given tomorrow night
at the usual time.
Contrary to wishes of the Club var
ious individuals have conceived the
idea that this is an ordinary campus
danco and have acted accordingly.
The members of Encina Club wish it
to be understood that Encinas are ex
clusively for invited guests and that
the Encina tomorrow is particularly
for members of the 1915 Trark Team.
