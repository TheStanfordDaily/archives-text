# ECONOMICS MAJORS ADOPT HONOR CODE
## 
### 
"Adopt the straight honor system
and enforce it"was the stand taken
last night by forty-four economics
majors who met at the Union to dis
cuss the problem of cheating in exam
inations in their department.
Though opinion differed as to whe
ther the proper method of stopping
"cribbing" in the Economics depart
ment was to "stand u > and heave a
book at the man s-e?n cheating" or
speaking to him after class, the senti
ment of every one present at the maet
ing was strongly in favor of building
ill) a tradition tha u.ifair and dishon
orable methods were entirely under
the ban, not of the faculty, but ot' the
students studying economics.
Two .resolutions were adopted at the
meeting, over which S. S. Simonson,
'15, presided. The first was to make
as a tradition in the department the
custom of sitting with one seat "be
tween you and the next fellow." The
second resolution was to the effect
that the forty-four economics men pre
sent went on favor of the pledge them
selves to support the straight honor
system, in which the students rather
than the faculty would enforce the j
rule.
It was the plan of those present
last night, the majority of whom were
upperclassmen, to establish both o!'
these traditions as strongly as the law
department has built up its honor sys
tem.
Among the men who spoke at the
me ting last night were C. E. Wolcott,
'1">, 15. Williams. '10. F. C. Hamilton,
15, J. V. Word, '10, J. Hettinger,

H. W. Frantz, '17, H. V. Aupperle, '17,
