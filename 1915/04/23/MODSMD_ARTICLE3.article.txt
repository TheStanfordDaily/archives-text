# CALIFORNIA ADOPTS MOTION SEVERING ATHLETIC RELATIONS WITH STANFORD
## 
### 
"in order that there may he no
doubt concerning our settled convic
tions and policy with relation to in
tercollegiate competition, »><>, students
of the University of California, in
mass meeting assembled today, here
by resolve:
"That we will not engage in inter
colleuiate athletic varsity contests
with St uiford University except under
lite express agreement that the Fresh,
man ineligibility rule shall lie one of
the conditions to govern said eon
tests."
The above resolution was passed by
the students at the University of Cali
fornia this morning following a meet
ing of the Associated Students. This
was the only question put before the
voters and no opportunity was given
to express an opinion on the question
of submitting the differences to a
board of arbitration.
This rsfusal to submit the question
of arbitration comes as a surprise to
the members of the Stanford Inter
collegiate Agreement Committee. The
action means a practical break in re
lations without giving any considera
tion to Stanford's proposal to arbi
trate.
The resolution presents no new
Phases of the controversy and the im
portance of the vote rests in the reit
eration of the former stand made by
California without considering the con
cession of enough to the interests of
intercollegiate relations to submit the
question in which they firmly believe
themselves risrht to arbifation. Stan

.old was willing to make that conces
sion and the student body so ex
pressed itself at the balloting on
Tuesday.
E. J. Fenstermacher stated this
afternoon that California's action was
not a severing of relations. He stated
that the action taken by Stanford on
Tuesday constituted a break in itself
and California took the only stand
possible in view of that action. In
his opinion Stanford's offer to arbi
trate constituted a break of relations
and California refused to accept the
proposal. Xo such meaning was at
tached at Stanford to the fair pro
posal to go before a neutral board.
Vic Doyle, president of the Califor
nia Associated Students, said this af
ternoon that the student body took its
stand because it believed so sincerely
in its principle that t was beyond ar
bitration. He also stated that Stan
ford's proposition was included in a
report made to the student body on
the situation and there was some dis
cussion on the floor in regard to ar
bitrating, but the matter was not put
to a vote as California's proposition
had been submitted to a vote of the
Stanford student body.
President Worthy Makes Statement.
A. E. Worthy, '15, president of the
Associated Students and chairman of
the Stanford Intercollegiate Agree
ment Committee, stated this afternoon
that the refusal of California's com
mittee to put the question of arbitra
tion before the students on the ballot
'•anir as a complete surprise to him.

His statement follows:
"We are so/ry that it has been
necessary for a break to occur in in
tercollegiate relations. California was
undoubtedly sincere in her stand in
regard to Freshman elimination. But
it must be considered that there are
two sides to the question and that we
are just as firm and honest in our
conviction that Freshmen should com
pete in varsity contests. It was a
question of an honest difference of
opinion.
"We felt, and still feel, that we
would not be able to compete with
California on an even basis if we ac
cept their proposal. But the Stan
ford student body has shown its de
sire to continue relations by being
willing to submit the Freshman ques
tion to an unprejudiced arbitration
board, and to abide by the decision of
such a board, even though it might
mean a sacrifice on our part.
"Stanford was accused by the Cali
fornia Agreement Committee at the
beginning of the semester of buying
athletes. They claim to have dis
avowed these accusations, But the
feeling on the California campus is
still that we buy our athletes, and
Stanford still feels that she is unjust
ly accused. Until the students at
Berkeley realize that athletics are as
clean at Stanford as Californians
think theirs are it will be hard to
draw up an agreement.
"I believe that the leaders at C'ali
forn'a were ve.ry unfair and showed
the weakness of their position when
they refused even to consider arbitra
tion. I am firmly of the conviction
that if our side of this case was pre
sented in an impartial way to the stu
dent body at California it would be
willing to arbitrate our differences. 1
still hope that they will see the rea
sonableness of such a view."
A. E. WORTHY.
Pr< sl<Tliinks Stanford Fair.
Over the telephone this afternoon,
George J. Presley, '07, forme.r football
coach and a member of the commit
tee, refused to make a statement on
receipt of news of the action because
of his relation to the controversy un
til he should receive more information
concerning the stand of the California
student body. He holds the opinion,
however that t>e Stanford student
body has been very fair-minded in the
proposition and says:"I am in hopes
that the matte.r will be straightened
out, but I do believe that Stanford
has shown herself to be fair-minded
in this proposition. Though we be
lieve firmly in Freshman competition
we have been willing to submit the
question to arl itration in the interest
of 'ntercollegiate relations, and 1
think we were very fair in this."
R. W. Barrett, '05, the third mem
ber of the Stanford committee, when
told of the break, said: "I am very
sorry to hear of this action. It is all
uncalled for and a very foolish stand
to take. We did all that was possible
to come to an agreement by offering
to arbitrate and we cannot be ex
pected to do more."
