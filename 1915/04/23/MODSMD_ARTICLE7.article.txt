# TONIGHT'S PRODUCTION OF SHERWOOD DEFERRED
## EVENING PRESENTATION WILL BE GIVEN .MONDAY Tomorrow's Matinee to Be Played as Scheduled.â€”Cast Is Well Prepared. 
### 
The first performance of "Sher
wood." scheduled for this evening, has
been postponed until Monday night,
on account of the inclement weather.
Tomorrow afternoon's production has
not been changed, however, and will
be given as planned. All arrange
ments for the shift have been com
pleted, so that none of the charm of
the play will be lost. The same tick
ets purchased for tonight will be good,
but for those who are unable to at
tend the performance on Monday, the
purchase price of seats will be re
funded at the Dookstore.
The cast of a hundred and fifty peo
ple held ils last rehearsal yesterday
afternoon. Every role is letter per
fect, and every detail has been ar
ranged to insure a great success. The
taxis and busses will run from the
Pookstore and the Palo Alto Circle
as planned.
None of Robinhood's glory nor any
feature of the play will be marred by
this slight delay. If it is true that
tribulations strengthen the character,
the roles of Sherwood should be
played with even greater success than
expected.
The Sheriff of Nottingham, in the
hands of Sherwood Chapman, "lfi, is
a character of great i>ower and vigor.
Nottingham is the right hand man of
Prince John, Robinhood's arch-enemy,
and figures prominently in the fights
with the greenwood men.
Miss Nancy Lee Willard, 'IS. has
succeeded in making the Queen of the
Fairies exceedingly charming and
graceful, and appears to good advan
tage in her part, opposite Miss Marian
Vaughan, *10, King of the Fairies.
Professor Passett asks that the en
tire cast be at the estate at 12:30 to
morrow afternoon.
