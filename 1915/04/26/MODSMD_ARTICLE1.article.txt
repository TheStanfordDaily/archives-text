# SHERWOOD IS SUCCESS
## Shadow-of-a-Leaf and Maid Marian Score Triumphs. Others in Cast Not So Strong SCENE IS BRIGHT 
### 
The smile of Maid Marian, the voice
of Blondel, the wistful gayety of
Shadow-of-a-leaf, these are the impres
sions that rest with one after seeing
Sherwood among the trees of the Es
tate. There on the green the good
folk of great-hearted Richard's time
live again fo.r us. Picture after pic
ture in the frame of the green out
doors follow one another in colorful
success'on.
To say Sherwood is an unqualified
success would be an over-statement.
It is a sincere production of Noyes'
drama, rarely beautiful at times,
sometimes failing to keep the sym
pathy of the audience, throughout ra
ther lack'ng in force and spontaneity.
The laurels for individual starring
are shared by Miss Richard Borough,
as Maid Marian, and CI. A. Davis as
Shadow-of-a-leaf. Davis ives the part
of the fool at once a grace and a depth
which make it memorable in the his
tory of Stanford dramatics. He real
izes every possibility of a character
that Is truly that of a wind-blow leaf,
a character which he fills at once with
the gentleness and the shyness of a
wild creature. Maid Marian was at all
times exquisitely winsome. Miss Bor
ough's acting is full of charm and
spirit. She is by turns gentle and
scornful, but from beginning to end
captivating. Truly it is no wonder
that such a Marian should win the
heart of prince and of outlaw.
E. L. House as Prince John acts a
thankless role in a spirited and con
vincing manner. His stage presence is
good, his delivery finished, and his
portrayal of th? exaggerated villain is
as human as it could be made. Queen
Elinor in the capable hands of Miss
Nellita Choate proves a commanding
figure. The love, the hate, the inten
sity, of this haughty daughter of Kings
mingles a distinct admiration with the
conventional aversion which is sup
posed to be roused in the minds of an
audience by the machinations of a vil
lainess. Crafty though she is. Elinor
is ever queenly.
The trying role of Robin Hood is
but moderately well acted by F. E.
Keast. A dream-hero like the free
hearted outlaw of green Sherwood is
difficult of realization on any stage,
and Saturday's Rob : n Hood proved dis
appointing to those of us who have
ev r seen our gentle outlaw through
the mist of hero-worship. Mr. Keast
lacked force and animation in his act
ing. Robin the lover and Robin the
leader of men were alike unconvinc
ing. Neither the strength nor the
poetry of the character of Hunting
don was conveyed to the audience.
One of the most exquisite memories
of Sherwood will be the haunting song
of Blondel. the song of hoping, wander
ing, seeking in quest of the Great
king's minstrel, but to those who heard
King. J. W. Bennett is cast as the
the clear notes of his song in the for
est of Sherwood he will be none other
than Blondel seek'ng the king.
J. H. Russell is a Little John whose
quarter-staff might well command re
