# FEMININE FINANCE
## 
### 
Now that the Club House has finally
assumed a tangible, concrete-and-ma
sonry shape, the question still remains
—"How can we pay off the debt?" The
women's efforts in that direction have
been energetic and sincere, they have
racked their brains for new and attrac
tive ways of raising the desired sums
of the circulating medium.
They have held Pre-Panamas, have
sold song-books, given entertainments
without number, and still the debt on
the Club House looms formidable.
These typically feminine financial
tactics are no doulrt slowly moving to
ward the accomplishment of the desir
ed end, but the expenditure of energy
and of the community's not inexhaus
tible supply of patience would seem to
outbalance in a startling degree the
pecuniary gains involved. Why not
consider, before launching on an ar
dent campaign for the sale of donated
goods or 'square feet" to an unoffend
ing and patient public, that if the en
ergy and time spent on engineering it
were turned to persuading one or two
women to buy life memberships in the
Club House the fund would be just as
materially increased. And moreover
the person paying would be the very
one who is to derive benefit from the
use of the Club House.
We are the ones who should pay for
the Club House we have built—not the
faculty and not the men of the Univer
sity. If we but stop to think we will
see that the whole debt as it now
stands could be paid off if two hun
dred and forty women—less than half
of the Five Hundred—would buy their
life-memberships. Let the next finan
cial campaign be a campaign for life
memberships!
