### 
Women's Field Day has established
itself at Stanford by the added inter
est in athletics it has aroused among
the women of the University. Though
there may bp room for improvement In
future years, Saturday's contests prov
ed the day an undeniably successful
institution. Thanks are due to Dr. An
gel I, Dr. Stoltz, Professor Marx, and H.
W. Maloney for their interest and aid.
