# WEDNESDAY

### 
Wednesday morning will see the
election of Student Body officers for
the coming semester. Every Stanford
woman who has paid her student body
dues should cast her vote that morn
ing for the men who are best fitted
to fill the highest positions that the
college can give. Unfortunately fem
inine votes have always been too
prone to fall to the men whom we
nhink are "nice," to men we know—
whether they are qualified for an of
fice or not.
This time let the women find out the
qualifications of the candidates. If you
don't know them, ask about them. Ask
several people so you will get all sides
of the question. Then mark your
ballots for the best men. A few votes
carelessly cast may send an election
one way or another. Each vote counts
this year more than ever, for the men
who are elected Wednesday will have
a difficult situation to handle. It will
be those men who represent the stu
dent body in the present intercolle
giate crisis.
Then too, read the proposed amend
ments to the Student Body constitu
tion. Decide which stand you take
and put the c,ross on your ballot
where you think it should go. But
know exactly what you are voting for
and why. There is no excuse for the
women of the University to vote care
lessly or not at all. On Wednesday,
therefore, think—then vote.
