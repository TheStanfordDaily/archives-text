# CO-EDS
## We All Are, Says Mrs. Russell of Faculty 
### 
Heard the latest? We're all "co
eds."
In spite of the fact that the word
"co-ed" is forbidden from The Daily
Palo Alto columns, we're forced to
break a rule for once to let the
truth out. We're all "co-eds.". We
have put quotations around the word,
to show that we didn't just "slip up."
The authority for this "co-ed dope"
is Mrs. Theresa P. Russell, instruct
or in English.
"Woman are no move co-eds than
men," said Mrs. Russell, "They are
so called because they came last into
the American college. But co-educa
tion means mutual education, and both
men and women should be called co
eds. However, if the woman is the
co-ed, the man must be the ed."
Whereupon, the members of the
Gridiron class disagreed, and the men
present promptly declined to be either
"co-eds" or "eds."
