## Griffith's Statement Would Shift Responsibility For Trouble Onto Stanford WIDENS BREACH 
### 
"The resolutions passed by Califor
nia. is a reaffirmance of the position
taken at the outset of negotiations. It
turns out that the Stanford student
body has not approved of the program
adopted by their agreement committee,
which stiuation was never intimated to
us. The responsibility in the main lies
with Stanford. If she desires to repu
diate what has been accomplished and
to refuse now to sign an agreement,
California students will be sorry. They
feel that cessation of intercollegiate
relations is a misfortune, but not so
treat as it would be to postpone, as
they have done for the past ten years,
the adoption of a rule desiring to place
their athletic programme above re
proach."—Farnum Griffiths.
From this statement which appear
ed in the San Francisco Chronicle on
Saturday morning the casual reader
would l)e led to believe that the rupture
between the two universities was caus
ed by Stanford because it did not ap
prove the programme adopted by its
agreement committee. The Spokes
man for the California Agreement
Committee has made a wrong assump
tion and has apparently tried to clcan
California's hand for the blame attach
ed to the ultimatum passed on by the
student body Friday.
The facts of the case are very simple
and prove that the Stanford student
body stood by its agreement commit
tee when it did not accept the propos
al submitted to Stanford in a letter
on April 5. ,
The Agreement Committees of the
two universities met on the evening of
January 191") with the hope that
some compromise might be suggested
which would lead to an ultimate solu
tion of the difficulties. At that time
it was decided to continue athletic re
lations for the present semester under
a gentleman's agreement.
A tentative proposed agreement was
considered which looked to an ulti
mate settl ment of the question. The
terms of the tentative proposal were
as follows:
1. The Freshman ineligibility rule,
providing that first year men shall be
barred from competition in varsity
contests is to be adopted.
2. Only students enrolled in the reg
ular colleges at Berkeley shall be eli
gible to play on California teams in
intercollegiate contests with Stanford:
that is students in the so-called affili
ated colleges shall be ineligible.
3. The scholarship requirements im
posed upon the members of intercol
legiate teams shall be the same for
both universities, that is, that the Cali
fornia requirements for scholarship be
raised to those required at Stanford
for athletes.
4. Intercollegiate football, and. as
may be mutually agreeable, other
Freshman intercollegiate contests are
to be restored.
It was mutually understood by mem
bers of the Intercolleiate committees
that this tentative agreement would
not be considered by the student bodies
of either Universities if it was found
impossible to include the fourth clause,
namely concerning the restoration of
Freshman intercollegiate contests. Be
fore any action was to be taken by ei
ther student body, the faculty ath
letic committees were to consider the
restoration of the Freshman game. It
was considered and found impossible
to restore same. Tt was understood
that a new method of settlement
should be sought if this clause were
found impractical from the faculty
viewpoint. And this understanding
was emphasized by Farnum Griffths at
that time.
No new method of settlement was
sought by the California agreement
committee.
The contents of the letter of April 5
was never approved by the Stanford
Agreement committee. The Stanford
body stood back of its agreement coni
mittee by turning down California's
proposal. This in itself proves that
Stanford did not repudiate what had
been accomplished for the reason that
no basis for settlement had been reach
ed. The proposal submitted by Cali
fornia could not have been considered
unless it had been possible to reinstate
the Freshman game.
By proposing arbitration as a meth
od of settlement Stanford took the only
step toward a basis of settlement of
the question. In view of these facts
Farnum Griffiths' statement had been
proved absolutely assumed and incor
rect.

From this statement which appear
ed in the San Francisco Chronicle on
Saturday morning the casual reader
would l)e led to believe that the rupture
between the two universities was caus
ed by Stanford because it did not ap
prove the programme adopted by its
agreement committee. The Spokes
man for the California Agreement
Committee has made a wrong assump
tion and has apparently tried to clcan
California's hand for the blame attach
ed to the ultimatum passed on by the
student body Friday.
The facts of the case are very simple
and prove that the Stanford student
body stood by its agreement commit
tee when it did not accept the propos
al submitted to Stanford in a letter
on April 5. ,
The Agreement Committees of the
two universities met on the evening of
January 191") with the hope that
some compromise might be suggested
which would lead to an ultimate solu
tion of the difficulties. At that time
it was decided to continue athletic re
lations for the present semester under
a gentleman's agreement.
A tentative proposed agreement was
considered which looked to an ulti
mate settl ment of the question. The
terms of the tentative proposal were
as follows:
1. The Freshman ineligibility rule,
providing that first year men shall be
barred from competition in varsity
contests is to be adopted.
2. Only students enrolled in the reg
ular colleges at Berkeley shall be eli
gible to play on California teams in
intercollegiate contests with Stanford:
that is students in the so-called affili
ated colleges shall be ineligible.
3. The scholarship requirements im
posed upon the members of intercol
legiate teams shall be the same for
both universities, that is, that the Cali
fornia requirements for scholarship be
raised to those required at Stanford
for athletes.
4. Intercollegiate football, and. as
may be mutually agreeable, other
Freshman intercollegiate contests are
to be restored.
It was mutually understood by mem
bers of the Intercolleiate committees
that this tentative agreement would
not be considered by the student bodies
of either Universities if it was found
impossible to include the fourth clause,
namely concerning the restoration of
Freshman intercollegiate contests. Be
fore any action was to be taken by ei
ther student body, the faculty ath
letic committees were to consider the
restoration of the Freshman game. It
was considered and found impossible
to restore same. Tt was understood
that a new method of settlement
should be sought if this clause were
found impractical from the faculty
viewpoint. And this understanding
was emphasized by Farnum Griffths at
that time.
No new method of settlement was
sought by the California agreement
committee.
The contents of the letter of April 5
was never approved by the Stanford
Agreement committee. The Stanford
body stood back of its agreement coni
mittee by turning down California's
proposal. This in itself proves that
Stanford did not repudiate what had
been accomplished for the reason that
no basis for settlement had been reach
ed. The proposal submitted by Cali
fornia could not have been considered
unless it had been possible to reinstate
the Freshman game.
By proposing arbitration as a meth
od of settlement Stanford took the only
step toward a basis of settlement of
the question. In view of these facts
Farnum Griffiths' statement had been
proved absolutely assumed and incor
rect.
"The resolutions passed by Califor
nia. is a reaffirmance of the position
taken at the outset of negotiations. It
turns out that the Stanford student
body has not approved of the program
adopted by their agreement committee,
which stiuation was never intimated to
us. The responsibility in the main lies
with Stanford. If she desires to repu
