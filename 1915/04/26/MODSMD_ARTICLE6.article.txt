## Griffith's Statement Would Shift Responsibility For Trouble Onto Stanford WIDENS BREACH 
### 
"The resolutions passed by Califor
nia. is a reaffirmance of the position
taken at the outset of negotiations. It
turns out that the Stanford student
body has not approved of the program
adopted by their agreement committee,
which stiuation was never intimated to
us. The responsibility in the main lies
with Stanford. If she desires to repu
diate what has been accomplished and
to refuse now to sign an agreement,
California students will be sorry. They
feel that cessation of intercollegiate
relations is a misfortune, but not so
treat as it would be to postpone, as
they have done for the past ten years,
the adoption of a rule desiring to place
their athletic programme above re
proach."â€”Farnum Griffiths.
From this statement which appear
ed in the San Francisco Chronicle on
Saturday morning the casual reader
would l)e led to believe that the rupture
between the two universities was caus
ed by Stanford because it did not ap
prove the programme adopted by its
agreement committee. The Spokes
man for the California Agreement
Committee has made a wrong assump
tion and has apparently tried to clcan
California's hand for the blame attach
ed to the ultimatum passed on by the
student body Friday.
