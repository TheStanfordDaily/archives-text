# NEW QUAD OUT For Sale at Law Steps ON THURSDAY
## 
### 
The 1916 Quad will be placed on
sale at the Law Steps next Thursday
morning at 10 o'clock. That date has
been substituted for May 3, the time
previously announced, in order to
complete distribution of the book well
in advance of final examinations.
Many new departures furnish extra
values. Careful page arrangement,
attractive combination of ink and pa
per, and a thorough chronicle of the
college year 1914-15 make the new
yearbook deserving of a place in the
red row on the shelf.
Most of the copies have been bound
and are being allowed to set an extra
length of time in the binder's press in
order to dry the glue thoroughly on
the seamed back-bone. Such care in
binding, together with use of a solid
paper, make it possible to produce a
less bulky volume. The result will
be greater durability and convenience
without decrease of the number of
pages. The Quad contains 494 pages.
