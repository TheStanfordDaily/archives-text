# IS RETURN TO THE OLD GAME REASON FOR CALIFORNIA'S RESOLVE?
## NEGOTIATES WITH U.S.C. Blue and Gold Leaders Endeavor to Form Athletic Relations With Warren Bovard of Southern College 
### 
Suspicions are abroad that the Uni
versity of California intends to go
back to the American game of football
following the break of relations with
Stanford. In fact there are those on the
campus who believe that the only pur
pose behind the break is the desire to
return to the old game, rather than
any high-flown principle of standing
behind the ideal of Freshman elimina
tion.
Color is given to the belief that Cali
fornia intends to play the American
game by the fact that Manager J. W.
Stroud has been in Los Angeles con
ferring with Graduate Manager War
ren Rovard of the University of Sou
thern California. It is a known fact
that U. S. C. wishes to break with the
Southern Conference and secure com
petition elsewhere. An agreement be
tween the Universities of California
and Southern California might help
both of them out of their present dif
ficulties.
Rut there's a hitch. The reason the
southern university wishes to break
with its neighbors is because of the
net-work of rules which has grown up
in the conference, limiting the free
dom of the individual institutions to
the extent that Southern California
prefers being a free-lance to being
bound by the conference agreement..
The athletic policy of U. S. C. as out
lined by President Rovard, father of
the graduate manager, is the same as
that of Stanford, and seeks to have
many men out for participation .rather
than to seek winning teams from a
small squad. The ruling he especially
derides is the 'elimination of freshmen,
since it tends to limit the number of
men who will be brought out for train
ing.
"There are many reasons why we
should not go back to the American
game. In the first place of course
Rugby is a better game. In the second
place it has produced a change in all
our athletics. More men are out for all
the sports. It is only since we have had
Rugby that we have had interclass
games, interfraternity games and post
season games. Rugby is in line with
the University policy of having as
many men as possible out for foot
ball."
When told that the University of
California, might return to the old
game, Dr. Mranner said, "If they do it
would be most unfortunate. I am very
fond of Rugby. I think if we stick to
it for a little while longer on the coast
the whole continent will come around
to it. I have not seen the American
game for eight years and I am told
that it is greatly changed, but T should
be very much opposed to giving up
Rugby."
Dr. Jordan said. "If I were at th>>
head of Stanford now, the University
would never return to American font
ball. As it is it. is for my successors
to dee'de. American football was the
curse of Stanford while we had it. I
have not seen it played recently, but
tl> • entire principle back of the game
is wrong. It on the principle of
a battle instead of a game of skill, and
is really played between the coßches
Under the principles ma'ntained by
each th only wnv in which California
