# "WE MUST WIN"—U.C.

### 
ft has been suggested by a few se
lect individuals from the state insti
tution that there is a strong probab
ility that American football will be
played at Berkeley hereafter, and
rugby will be thrown into discard. Isn't
it strange when a team cannot win
year after year that the coaches and
trainers and students, that is just a
few students, decide to abondon the
sport and seek a substitute? Of course
some excuse for losing is necessary.
And now the question arises where
will California seek competition? Ap
parently there are several institutions
of collegiate rank which might appeal
more strongly to the ravenous desires
of the Berkeley bear. Colleges repre
sented by teams which could be mangl
ed every now and again. But even at
that we have the confidence that such
colleges could take care of themselves
and make more than a creditable
showing. Of course they would simply
have to let California have her own
way once in a while, because if they
didn't California would say that we
won't play, or else demand regulations
in order to give her the edge on her
opponents.
And now let us consider the colleges
which might get together in a confer
ence with California. It is intimated
that California is seeking intercolle
giate relations with Redlands Univer
sity, Whittier College, University of
Southern California and Throop Poly
technic Institute, This would cer
tainly be a popular combination from
the standpoint of competition. When
keen competition is afforded the
sport-loving public is satisfied, and of
course it is necessary for California
to please her coaches, trainers, alum
ni. students and ardent supporters.
But there is a stumbling block to
the Inclusion of one of the colleges
in the combine, namely University of
Southern California. Dr. Bovard,
president of the Methodist institution
has declared that Freshman competi
tion on varsity teams is necessary to
the best interests of athletics. Cali
fornia has issued the ultimatum that
she will not compete with Stanford
unl ss we abolish Freshmen compe
tition, for the reason that she believes
so strongly in her principle. We

would like to ask California whether
she is maintaining a principle or a
policy. Now If she believes so firmly
in the policy of abolishing Freshman,
it does not seem possible that she
would stoop to anything so low as to
permit the southern institution to use
Freshmen on varsity teams. It would
be morally degrading from the view
taken all along by California. And
yet, it is necessary to the best inter
ests of athletics in the University of
Southern California to include Fresh
men on her teams.
We have been considering the
probable plans for California athlet
ics. And now as for Stanford—HACK

permit the southern institution to use
Freshmen on varsity teams. It would
be morally degrading from the view
taken all along by California. And
yet, it is necessary to the best inter
ests of athletics in the University of
Southern California to include Fresh
men on her teams.
We have been considering the
probable plans for California athlet
ics. And now as for Stanford—HACK
TO POUGHKEEPSIE!
ft has been suggested by a few se
lect individuals from the state insti
tution that there is a strong probab
ility that American football will be
played at Berkeley hereafter, and
rugby will be thrown into discard. Isn't
it strange when a team cannot win
year after year that the coaches and
trainers and students, that is just a
few students, decide to abondon the
sport and seek a substitute? Of course
some excuse for losing is necessary.
And now the question arises where
will California seek competition? Ap
parently there are several institutions
of collegiate rank which might appeal
more strongly to the ravenous desires
of the Berkeley bear. Colleges repre
sented by teams which could be mangl
ed every now and again. But even at
that we have the confidence that such
colleges could take care of themselves
and make more than a creditable
showing. Of course they would simply
have to let California have her own
way once in a while, because if they
didn't California would say that we
won't play, or else demand regulations
in order to give her the edge on her
opponents.
And now let us consider the colleges
which might get together in a confer
ence with California. It is intimated
that California is seeking intercolle
giate relations with Redlands Univer
sity, Whittier College, University of
Southern California and Throop Poly
technic Institute, This would cer
tainly be a popular combination from
the standpoint of competition. When
keen competition is afforded the
sport-loving public is satisfied, and of
course it is necessary for California
to please her coaches, trainers, alum
ni. students and ardent supporters.
But there is a stumbling block to
the Inclusion of one of the colleges
in the combine, namely University of
Southern California. Dr. Bovard,
president of the Methodist institution
has declared that Freshman competi
tion on varsity teams is necessary to
the best interests of athletics. Cali
fornia has issued the ultimatum that
she will not compete with Stanford
unl ss we abolish Freshmen compe
tition, for the reason that she believes
so strongly in her principle. We

would like to ask California whether
she is maintaining a principle or a
policy. Now If she believes so firmly
in the policy of abolishing Freshman,
it does not seem possible that she
would stoop to anything so low as to
permit the southern institution to use
Freshmen on varsity teams. It would
be morally degrading from the view
taken all along by California. And
yet, it is necessary to the best inter
ests of athletics in the University of
Southern California to include Fresh
men on her teams.
We have been considering the
probable plans for California athlet
ics. And now as for Stanford—HACK
TO POUGHKEEPSIE!
