# ELECTIONS

### 
On the eve of the Student Body elec
tion speculation is rife as to the
probable results. The two most im
portant positions to be contested' fol
ate those of the President of the Stu
dent Body and Graduate Manager. Tn
each case there are three candidates
in the field and it will lie necessary
for one man to receive a majority of
votes cast in order to be elected.
The importance attached to these
offices is much greater this year than
ever before, due to the crisis in inter
collegiate athletic relations. The men
that are selected should not be placed
in office because of any great athletic
achievement on their part or because
they are good fellows well met. Rath
er they should be voted on because of
their peculiar qualifications to fill the
office for which they are running. It
is not impossible for every voter to
know the special qualifications of the
candidates,-and if they do not, inquiry
should be made before the ballot is
cast. All ignorant vote is worse than
no vote at all.
The Student Body President should
be a man who is broad-minded; not
easily led by the views of a few in
dividuals; does not jump to conclu
sions quickly, but when he has made
up his mind he sticks to his decision,
has time to fulfill his duties, and is
truly representative.
The Graduate Manage.r, from the
nature of his office, should be primar
ily a man with executive business
ability who has some knowledge of
the duties which he will fulfill; he
should possess a personal magnetism
and a wide business acquaintance.
And in considering the men for the
two most important offices we do not
want to lose s'ght of the importance to
the class representatives on the Ex
ecutive Committee.
You are responsible for the men
who are elected tomorrow. Vote, but
vote intelligently.
