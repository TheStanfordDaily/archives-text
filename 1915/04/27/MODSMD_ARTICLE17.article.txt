# WHEN IN DOUBT

### 
Several amendments to the consti
tution are submitted to voters tomor
row. The first of these pertains to a
change in the graduate manager sys
tem, The vote tomorrow on this prop
osition will merely be a tentative, and
in no way a final, ballot. It is placed
on the ballot in order to secure the
sentiment of the students on such a
proposed change. Xo one knows the
relative merits of the system because
the,re has not been time to consider
the advantages and disadvantages of
the proposal. It. may be efficient, it
may he very inefficient. There is cer
tainly an opportunity for politics to
play a leading role in the choice of
assistant managers. This would be a
decided disadvantage. As long as you

are in doubt as to the advisability of
the plan, vote no.
In regard to the other two amend
ments pertaining to The Daily Palo
Alto we recommend that they be rati
fied by the Student Body. The amend
ment pertaining to the salaries of the
ed'tor and the managers, and the di
vision of surplus profits has been in
effect for more than a semester. The
plan for placing the books of the pa
per under the accounting system is a
step toward efficiency.
