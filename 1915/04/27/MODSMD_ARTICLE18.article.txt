Editor of Daily Palo Alto:
I note in the published minutes of
the Stanford Executive Committee,
that along with the motion to create
assistant managers—a probably meri
torious plan—there is included a
"rider" for paying them.
The last repc.rt of the Harvard Ath
letic Association had a paragraph de
voted to the subject of assistant man
agers wherein it appears that these
offices were regarded as high college
honors and eagerly competed for by
efficient men. The report also stated
that incidentally these managers found
the positions gave them a certain
amount of useful business training
and further, through their business
acquaintanceship, good managers were
often able to 'place' themselves ad
vantageously on leaving college.
I am sorry to see that the Executive
Committee lias so poor an opinion of
the Stanford spirit that they think it
necessary to pay men for services
which students at other universities
are glad to perform for the sake of
the honor and the pleasu.re of taking
part in the outside activities.
Incidentally, 1 don't see the neces
sity of professionalizing a bunch of
students every year.

Editor The Daily Palo Alto:
There is an amendment before the
students tomorrow which has not had
sufficient publicity. And since the am
endment proposes a system which has
never been tried here at Stanford the
average student cannot hope to vote
intelligently on it at this time.
It seems to me that it would be dif
ficult for the coaches and captains to
work under such an inefficient system
where responsibility will be divided
among several assistants, thus neces
sitating a greater amount of "Red
Tape."
Under the present system, with the
establishment of the accounting sys
tem. the future graduate manager will
be able to devote attention more di
rectly to each sport.
