# SENIOR ROLL READY
## 
### 
Say, Senior, want your name to go
down to posterity?
Yes?
Well, get a move on, then, and hie
yourself to the Registrar's Office. A
scratch or two of the pen will turn the
trick, and your name will go into pre
servation for the next few thousand
years.
It's just this way: the annual Sen
ior Role is ready, according to Com
mitteeman Ronnett, and every Senior
is to sign it within the next few days,
that the notable document may be
placed in a "strong box" and sealed
under the Class Plate on the inner
Quad on Class Day, Friday, May 14.
Officers and members of committees
are to sign both after the places desig
nated for them, and on the regular
lists. Furthermore, May 8 is the last
day for signatures.
