# CREW AUTHORITIES HOLD BELIEF THAT STANFORD CAN WIN ON HUDSON
## 
### 
Stanford's 1915 crew is looked upon
on the coast generally as the best
crew ever produced west of the Rock
ies. Followers of the sport away from
the University generally believe that
this year's eight stands the best chance
of bringing the Poughkeeps'.e cham
pionship to the coast of any aggrega
tion which has made the trip East.
Stanford's reputation away from
home is shown by Coach Conibear's
statement on his return to Seattle.
The coach demonstrated that he is a
good sport at the close of the contest
and his statement to his constituents
shows the same qualities. His oni>
excuse for losing the race is that
Washington lost to a better crew. The
following appeared in The University
of Washington Daily:
"We were fairly defeated by a crew
that rowed the entire race without a
slip, and 1 have no excuses to offer,"
said Coach Conibear this morning,
speaking of Stanford's victory over
Washington Saturday. "Stanford
must be given full credit for winning,
and 1 don't wish to detract from her
glo.ry. We have a fine crew and it
took a fine crew to beat us.
"The Stanford oarsmen were more
physically fit than our men. All of
them were like Callow and Walske.
That crew compares favorably with
any in the country. The entire eight
men rowed as one machine, while our
men made two or three slips that were
costly. However, the men are not to
be blamed, for they did the besi they
knew how. I don't believe 1 am to
be blamed, either, but that is for
others to judge."
This statement assumes special im
portance when it is remembered that
Conibear considered this crew his best
ever, and intended to take them East
with the expectance of sweeping the
eastern waters. He lost the race by a
length and a quarter last year.
It is essential that the collectors ap
pointed last Friday get on the job im
diately to collect the $1.00 from ev
ery student to send the crew "Back to
Poughkeepsie."
