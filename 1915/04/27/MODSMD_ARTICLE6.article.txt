# SHERWOOD IN THE EVENING PROVES MORE CHARMING THAN WHEN ACTED BY DAY
## 
### 
"Sherwood" in the evening proved
far more charming than "Sherwood"
by daylight. The second performance of
Noyes' forest-drama came up to ex
pectations in every particular. The
acting was more finished, the illusions
more perfect.
Maid Marian and Shadow-of-a-leaf
repeated their triumphs of Saturday;
Prince John was if possible more tru
ly the villain than before; Miss Choate
as Queen Elinor added much to h?r
first interpretation. Robin Hood, in
the hands of F. E. Keast, proved that
the first performance of a play can
not always be taken as a criterion of
an acti r's work. Mr. Keast gave a
more spirit -d and convincing per
formance of the role than in the first
" esertatlon of Sherwood.
