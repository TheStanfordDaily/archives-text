# LONGER HOURS
## 
### 
At this season of the semester there
is a greater demand for books in the
Library than at any other time. There
is a limited supply of books which are
in the greatest demand. It is there
fore necessary that each student
should be given every opportunity
possible to avail himself of the priv
ilege of using these books.
rt has been suggested that the Li
brary be kept open for longer hours
from now until the end of examina
tions. The Library closing hour might
be changed from 10:00 to 10:30 or
11 o'clock on week days and 5:30 or
late.r on Saturdays. The extension of
time each day would make it possible
for more students to avail themselves
of the privileges of hour books. Back
