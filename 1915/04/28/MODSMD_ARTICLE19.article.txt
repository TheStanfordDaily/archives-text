Stanford, April 27, 1915,
Dearest Ma.:
Well, ma, exams are coming, so lets
rejoice—that'll mean more opportun
ity for mid-week-tlll-H!:30-queening.
Yours of recently at hand and con
tents carefully noted. Why the crepe
about California —she doesn't need
that sympathy? They're not as bad off
as all that, and really, if you knew
the real facts and their underlying
motives you wouldn't blame the ac
tion of their "student body." Cali
fornia has some admirable coaches
worth keeping, and you know, ma,
coaches won't keep without a victory
now and then. It's like trying to keep
butter and herring in the same ice-box
without ice in summer. And perhaps
the coaches have families to support
and take to the fair, so California did
the right thing by them —made it pos
sible for the cheers of victory to once
more ring out elatedly beneath the
verdured hills of Berkeley. As for
competition, Cal. does not need to
worry—the.re are a mob of schools
down south, business colleges and U.
S. C., and *he Pasadena Barber college,
and Junior colleges in the high
schools. As for finances, Ma, things
look bright. Tourists will gladly pay
two-bits to ride up the Campanile, and
to see the men's dancing classes in Har
mon gvm is worth every bit of a dime.
So save your crepe for my funeral,
Ma, and agree with me that Cal. did
the right thing by lie.r coaches. I'm
sure some members of their student
body think that way. Victory is no
thing to be sjieezed at, even if one has
hay-fever. Here's to the Cal. freshmen
in the Conference meet. With love.
Your SONNY.
