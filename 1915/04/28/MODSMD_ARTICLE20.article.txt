# SERIOUS AUTO ACCIDENT INJURES STANFORD MAN
## 
### 
A collision between a Buick road
ster containing Mrs. C. O. Sappington
and G. F. Helsley, '15, and the South
ern Pacific "Lark" near Redwood
last evening resulted in serious injur
ies for both occupants of the machine.
The collision occured at the last cros
sing this way from Redwood, a very
bad one as it is impossible to see the
track because of large sign boards on
each side of the road. The machine
was struck head-on by the "Lark,"
which attains a speed of nearly forty
five miles an hour when passing this
crossing, and was torn to shreds, an
explosion of the gasoline tank entirely
consuming the wreckage.
Both Mrs. Sappington and Helsley
were immediately rushed to the Red
wood Hospital. Mrs. Sappington's in
juries cannot be ascertained as yet but
Doctors Boss and Williams believe
that she may recover although her
skull is seriously fractured. Hels
ley escaped with but a few minor
cuts and contusions.
