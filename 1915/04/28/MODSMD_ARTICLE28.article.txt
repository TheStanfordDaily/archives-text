The Mechanical Engineering Society
held a meeting last evening at which
the following officers were elected to
serve next semester: president, W.
H. Warren, 'ir>, vice-president, IT. F.
Elliott. '16, sercetary-treasurer, F. G.
Hampton. '1(1.
After the business meeting Mr. H.
W. Stebbins, instructor in Mechanical
Engineering gave a very interesting
talk on "Locomotive Testing," using
tables and charts to illustrate his
points. As he has had considerable
experience of a practical nature in
this work his lecture was especially
interesting.
He divided the general subject in
to two classes, shop tests and road
tests, saying that, very few railroads
carry out complete shop tests because
of the expensive apparatus required.
Among the universities, Cornell is the
only one equipped for such work. Most
railroads carry out road tests from
time to time to determine the com
parative efficiency of different types
of locomotives as well as the heating
value of different fuels. His charts
were a great aid in illustrating the
practical side of locomotive testing.
