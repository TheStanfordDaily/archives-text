# California Claims Stanford Failed to Back Up Committee
## 
### 
The Stanford Intercollegiate Agree
ment Committee was officially in
formed of the action taken by the
California student body, breaking re
lations with Stanford, in a letter re
ceived by President A. E. Worthy, '15,
last evening. The committee is in
formed that the athletic committee is
I roceeding with arrangements for
their athletic calendar next year pro
viding for contests without Stanford.
The letter, which is printed in full
below, makes the indirect accusation,
so prevalent in recent articles in San
Francisco papers that the Stanford
student body has failed to stand be
hind the committee and that this is
the reason for the breach in relations.
This accusation is the result of the
twisted logic whereby the men in
charge of affairs at California at
tempted to construe the proposal
made on April 5 to be materially the
same as that proposal! by the intercol
legiate committees in February.
This temporary agreement provided
for a Freshman intercollegiate game.
While a compact with this clause
would have been accepted by the
Stanford student body as a compro
mise measure which would be accept
ed in the interest of retaining inter
collegiate contests and was not en
t'rely out of line with Stanford's prin
ciple of providing intercollegiate com
petition for all men who qualify, the
agreement was absolutely unsatisfac
tory when it was found to be impos
sible to include tliis clause on account
of Faculty rulings.
The letter follows:
Berkeley, Cal., April 26. 1915.
