# California Claims Stanford Failed to Back Up Committee
## 
### 
The Stanford Intercollegiate Agree
ment Committee was officially in
formed of the action taken by the
California student body, breaking re
lations with Stanford, in a letter re
ceived by President A. E. Worthy, '15,
last evening. The committee is in
formed that the athletic committee is
I roceeding with arrangements for
their athletic calendar next year pro
viding for contests without Stanford.
The letter, which is printed in full
below, makes the indirect accusation,
so prevalent in recent articles in San
Francisco papers that the Stanford
student body has failed to stand be
hind the committee and that this is
the reason for the breach in relations.
This accusation is the result of the
twisted logic whereby the men in
charge of affairs at California at
tempted to construe the proposal
made on April 5 to be materially the
same as that proposal! by the intercol
legiate committees in February.
This temporary agreement provided
for a Freshman intercollegiate game.
While a compact with this clause
would have been accepted by the
Stanford student body as a compro
mise measure which would be accept
ed in the interest of retaining inter
collegiate contests and was not en
t'rely out of line with Stanford's prin
ciple of providing intercollegiate com
petition for all men who qualify, the
agreement was absolutely unsatisfac
tory when it was found to be impos
sible to include tliis clause on account
of Faculty rulings.
The letter follows:
Berkeley, Cal., April 26. 1915.
Stanford Intercollegiate Agreement
Committee,
Care Mr. A. E. Worthy,
Stanford University, Cal.
Gentlemen:
It now becomes our duty to inform
you officially that at a meeting of the
students of the University of Califor
nia on Friday last the following reso
lution was unanimously adopted:
In order that there may be no
doubt concerning our settled con
viction and policy with relation
to inter-collegiate athletics, we
the students of the University of
California in mass meeting as
sembled hereby resolve that we
will not engage in inter-collegiate
athletic "Varsity" contests with
Stanford University except on the
express agreement that the fresh
man ineligibility rule shall be one
of the conditions to govern said
contests.'
At the meeting referred to, arbitra
tion was frankly and fairly presented
and disapproved, it is in any event
obvious of course that arbitration
could afford no relief since the Cali
fornia Student Body, much as it re
grets the cessation of intercollegiate
athletic relations, can not in justice
to its conviction on principle forego
the freshman ineligibility rule under
any conditions.
It is our understanding that the
Stanford students, on their part, are
unwilling to sign an agreement that
would be inconsistent with the terms
of the foregoing .resolution, even under
conditions and concessions such as
those heretofore proposed by your
Committee and accepted by us.
We are therefore proceeding with
other arrangements for our athletic
program for the ensuing year.
In closing this communication we
desire to express to the members of
the Stanford Tnte.rcollegiate Agree
ment Committee our appreciation ot
their patience, courtesy and conscien
tious endeavor to solve the difficulty
and our regret that their proposal of
a few weeks ago. which seemed then
to promise so happy a settlement, did
not meet with approval by the Stan
ford Faculty Committee and, as we
are now given to understand, though
we never so suspected until very .re
cently, by the Stanford Student Body
either.

In closing this communication we
desire to express to the members of
the Stanford Tnte.rcollegiate Agree
ment Committee our appreciation ot
their patience, courtesy and conscien
tious endeavor to solve the difficulty
and our regret that their proposal of
a few weeks ago. which seemed then
to promise so happy a settlement, did
not meet with approval by the Stan
ford Faculty Committee and, as we
are now given to understand, though
we never so suspected until very .re
cently, by the Stanford Student Body
either.
Respectfully and regretfully yours,
CALIFORNIA INTERCOLLEGIATE
AGREEMENT COMMITTEE.
By Victor H. Doyle, President of the
Associated Students of the Univer
sity of California.
The Stanford Intercollegiate Agree
ment Committee was officially in
formed of the action taken by the
California student body, breaking re
lations with Stanford, in a letter re
ceived by President A. E. Worthy, '15,
last evening. The committee is in
formed that the athletic committee is
I roceeding with arrangements for
their athletic calendar next year pro
viding for contests without Stanford.
The letter, which is printed in full
below, makes the indirect accusation,
so prevalent in recent articles in San
Francisco papers that the Stanford
student body has failed to stand be
hind the committee and that this is
the reason for the breach in relations.
This accusation is the result of the
twisted logic whereby the men in
charge of affairs at California at
tempted to construe the proposal
made on April 5 to be materially the
same as that proposal! by the intercol
legiate committees in February.
This temporary agreement provided
for a Freshman intercollegiate game.
While a compact with this clause
would have been accepted by the
Stanford student body as a compro
mise measure which would be accept
ed in the interest of retaining inter
collegiate contests and was not en
t'rely out of line with Stanford's prin
ciple of providing intercollegiate com
petition for all men who qualify, the
agreement was absolutely unsatisfac
tory when it was found to be impos
sible to include tliis clause on account
of Faculty rulings.
The letter follows:
Berkeley, Cal., April 26. 1915.
Stanford Intercollegiate Agreement
Committee,
Care Mr. A. E. Worthy,
Stanford University, Cal.
Gentlemen:
It now becomes our duty to inform
you officially that at a meeting of the
students of the University of Califor
nia on Friday last the following reso
lution was unanimously adopted:
In order that there may be no
doubt concerning our settled con
viction and policy with relation
to inter-collegiate athletics, we
the students of the University of
California in mass meeting as
sembled hereby resolve that we
will not engage in inter-collegiate
athletic "Varsity" contests with
Stanford University except on the
express agreement that the fresh
man ineligibility rule shall be one
of the conditions to govern said
contests.'
At the meeting referred to, arbitra
tion was frankly and fairly presented
and disapproved, it is in any event
obvious of course that arbitration
could afford no relief since the Cali
fornia Student Body, much as it re
grets the cessation of intercollegiate
athletic relations, can not in justice
to its conviction on principle forego
the freshman ineligibility rule under
any conditions.
It is our understanding that the
Stanford students, on their part, are
unwilling to sign an agreement that
would be inconsistent with the terms
of the foregoing .resolution, even under
conditions and concessions such as
those heretofore proposed by your
Committee and accepted by us.
We are therefore proceeding with
other arrangements for our athletic
program for the ensuing year.
In closing this communication we

tious endeavor to solve the difficulty
