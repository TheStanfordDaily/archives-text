back-stop duty. Three twirlers have
been signed up, Doc Hayes, Gus Hoe
ver and Wickersham. Tom Workman
will fill his accustomed position on
first base, while Wobbles Stafford is
to bold down second. The other two
places in the infield are as yet uncer
tain. owing to McCloskey's inability
to make the trip. It is not at all im
probable, however, that Maple will fill
the shortstop berth, while Stevens
will be moved over to the difficult cor
ner. Definite positions will be as
signed after trying out the different
combinations. Don Day is to play
left, Russ Downing center, and Char

official capacity of utility-man.
