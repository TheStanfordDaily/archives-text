# CLASS OF 1915 WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE ALUMNI DAY PROGRAM
## 
### 
It was definitely decided last even
ing that the Senior class should take
an active part in the ivy and tree
planting which will afford one of the
most attractive features of Alumni
Day, The members of the class will
hive the Women's Club House as their
bxse ol operations.
The remaining classes will take
their shovels and picks in the follow
ing positions in the Inner Quad: '92,
'93, '94, East Arch; '95, East Arch; '9<5.
Northeast corner; '97, Southeast cor
ner; '98, Northwest corner; '99, West
Arch; '00, West Arch; '01. Southwest
corner. The Club House and The
Union will furnish the sett'ng for the
activities of the balance of the classes,
beginning with '02.
After the informal ceremonies have
been brought to a close the various
classes will coll ct. in two main
groups, one in tbe Inner Quad and the
ether in the space between the two
club houses, and give tbe Stanford
Varsity, followed by "Hail, Stanford,
Thes 1 tree plantings will be over
about. (! p. m., and tbe alumni din
ners follow immediately.
The committee in charge wishes to
impress everyone with the fact that
undergraduates will be just as wel
come and will be enabled to have just
as good a time as the alumni. The suc
cess of the great reunion will depend
in a great measure upon the coopera
tion which is proferred by the mem
bers of tbe Student Body. The Al
umni-Senior luncheon has a formi
dable name but will in reality be a
very informal affair, and Freshmen,
Sophomores and Juniors will be as
welcome as the Seniors and gradu
ates. Alumni Hay is an integral part
of Senior Week, and its pleasures are
open to all who remain to "see the
Seniors off."
