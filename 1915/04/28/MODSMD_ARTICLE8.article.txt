# Reports Will Give Crew a Basis For Trip Finance Plans
## 
### 
Reports will be made immediately
by the crew collectors to Captain Ja
comini in order that some definite in
formation may be had on the amount
of money coming in to send the crew
back to Poughkeepsie. Collectors are
requested to make a list of all con
tributors with the amount donated
and to list also the people who will
be able to give a dollar or more on
the first of the month. This will give
a definite working basis for the plans
of the finance committee.
The problem of financing the trip
has been placed in the hands of the
crew as a finance committee and all
men on the crew are working toward
this end. both on the committee and
as collectors. When the crew goes
into training again immediately fol
lowing final examinations, the work of
superintending the finances will be
turned over to a sub-committee, in or
der to relieve the men in training
from any counter-responsibility.
The alumni and crew enthusiasts out
ride of the University can be depend
ed on to furnish a part of the funds
needed, but the undergraduates must
be countcd on for a large share of the
$l,<SrtO still needed if the eight is to be
sent to Poughkeepsie. Tt will be im
possible to raise any money from the
students after college closes and for
this reason it is urged that the col
lectors who are loafing get on the job
at once.
