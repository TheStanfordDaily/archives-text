# ORATORIO IN FINAL STAGE
## LAST REHEARSAL SCHEDULED FOR NEXT SUNDAY 
### 
After months of prepa.rat.son, all is
in readiness for the finished produc
tion of Handel's oratorio "The Mes
siah." which is to be given in the
Memorial Church on Sunday, May 2.
The final rehearsal will he held Sun
day afternoon with the thirty piece
orchestra, especially selected under
the direction of D. M. Wright of San
Francisco, and the quartet. Mr. W.
D. Allen, dean of music at the College
of the Pacific, will relieve Mr. Eaton
at the organ, as the entire production
will be under the direction of the
Church organist.
"The Messiah" is one of the fore
most examples of the oratorio, the
highest expression of sacred music. By
solo and chorus work some special
Hiblical theme is expressed, th? sub
ject of this oratorio being the com
ing of Christ. Handel's "Messiah" has
been used more for charitable pur
poses than any other producion. Th?
composer intended it to be put to such
a iisirie and it has fulfilled all expec
tations along that line.
In s'nging _ the chorus "For Unto
Us" tbe choir will interpret one of the
mo3t. intricate s lections of sacred mu
sic. The "Hallelujah" chorus is ac
cepted as the greatest piece of relig
ions music and will receive ample
interpretation under the direction of
organist Eaton.
Free tickets may be procured by
students at Ihe Reg'strar's Office un
til Thursday night, after which time
there will be a general distribution to
the public.
