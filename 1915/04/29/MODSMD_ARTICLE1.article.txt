# UNIQUE AND ORIGINAL FEATURES PRESENTED IN JUNIOR YEARBOOK
## Class Annual Is Dedicated to Professor F.C. Woodward. O.H. Castle Writes of the Wonders of the Exposition. PAGE TONE IS PLEASING 
### 
The Junior Annual of the Class of
191(1, replete with four-hundred and
seventy pages of action pictures an:l
articles summarizing the out-going
college year, was put on sale this
morning at the Law Steps following
months of untiring effort on the part of
Editor W. P. Stamford and Manager
H. F. Elliot, ably ass'sfced by a staff of
fifteen co-workers.
Features galore, unique to the Stan
ford public, are included in the new
year book, which is fast being dis
tributed to all corners of the campus.
But what will stand out above all pos
sible innovations to be found in the
Quad, is the excellence of its liter
ary style and live current cuts. The
Junior class has dedicated its annual
to Frederic Campbell Woodward, Dean
of the Law department.
When first persuing the initial pages
of the year-book three features un
known to former Junior year-books
are apparent. On the title page is
embossed the great seal of the univer
sity in cardinal color. Following an
introductory poem, "O Well-Believed
Place!" from the pen of G. A. Hughes,
the book opens with sixteen pages ot'
camera adventures on the Stanford es
tate, exhibit'ng over two score exqui
site photos of the surrounding campus
scenery. A lengthy article on the Ex
position, by O. H. Castle, '14, accom
panied by numerous views of its won
ders, succeeds.
What especially will impress favor
ably th? majority of readers and which
undeniably lends the Quad an air of
more than usual distinction, is the soft
yet clear brown ink printed upon
pleasing sepia tone paper, and the viv
id action pictures, quite in contrast
with the accustomed Rose photo here
tofore used.
Four departments of the 191G an
nual are deserving of honorable men
tion â€”athletic, college year, josh and
art assignments. The rather im
portant and arduous duty of covering
sports has been handled by \V. J.
Gross, and his work fulfills every re
quirement. C. R. Wakefield has faith
fully summarized the college year,
skilfully picturing the current gen
eral events. The art department be
yond all doubt excels that of any
Quad yet placed on sale before the
Stanford public. R. X. Wenzel, as art
editor, assisted by F. S. Murray, '16,
M. A. Oliver, '15, Dorothy Egbert and
W. W. J. Gores, '17, has contributed to
its success. Six color plates, introduc
ing the various divisions attract no in
considerable notice. The side page
sketches of Wenzel's are all consis
tent and appropriate with the themes
illustrated, a condition lacking in
Quads of past years. H- M. Levy, in
his capacity as josh editor, is pro
ducing many surprises as regards
clippings, jokes and camera snapshots
not meant for the public.
C. W. Hatch has been the official
press-agent of organizations and de
bating. Buford Williams divided his
efforts between the faculty and
classes. G. A. Hughes as dramatic
critic and Quad poet has been a note
worthy factor in making the annual
a success. Fraternities and honor so
cieties have been under the supervi
sion of A. H. Daniels. Misses Olive
Yoder and Terese Dorr oh assumed the
task of covering sororities, musical
organizations and women's organiza
tions respectively. General assign
ments were distributed among the re
maining three staff members, E. T.
Johnston. Misses Dorothy Egbert and
Katrina Johnson, thereby completing
the list of fifteen staff-members who
aided Ed'tor Staniford and Manager
Elliott in putting out. what is proba
bly the finest. Junior Annual yet
placed before campus readers.
The 1916 Quad contains approxi
mately the same number of pages as
those for the past two years. Printed
on thinner paper, it is a much more
compact and attractive volume. A
page index in the back will make easy
.reference to the contents possible.
