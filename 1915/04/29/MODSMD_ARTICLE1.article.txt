The Junior Annual of the Class of
191(1, replete with four-hundred and
seventy pages of action pictures an:l
articles summarizing the out-going
college year, was put on sale this
morning at the Law Steps following
months of untiring effort on the part of
Editor W. P. Stamford and Manager
H. F. Elliot, ably ass'sfced by a staff of
fifteen co-workers.
Features galore, unique to the Stan
ford public, are included in the new
year book, which is fast being dis
tributed to all corners of the campus.
But what will stand out above all pos

Quad, is the excellence of its liter

Junior class has dedicated its annual
to Frederic Campbell Woodward, Dean
of the Law department.

of the year-book three features un
known to former Junior year-books

embossed the great seal of the univer

introductory poem, "O Well-Believed
Place!" from the pen of G. A. Hughes,
the book opens with sixteen pages ot'
camera adventures on the Stanford es
tate, exhibit'ng over two score exqui
site photos of the surrounding campus
scenery. A lengthy article on the Ex
position, by O. H. Castle, '14, accom
panied by numerous views of its won
ders, succeeds.
What especially will impress favor
ably th? majority of readers and which
undeniably lends the Quad an air of
more than usual distinction, is the soft
yet clear brown ink printed upon
