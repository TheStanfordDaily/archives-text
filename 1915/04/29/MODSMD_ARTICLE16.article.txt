Tn order to send the championship
crew to the Poughkeepsie regatta it
is absolutely necessary that at least
$1,800 he raised among students,
alumni and friends. A campaign has
been started with the crew members,
as a nucleus of a canvassing commit
tee, to solicit funds. Collectors have
been appointed in every fraternity,
club and rooming house on the cam
pus. The appointment of these col
lectors conveys a deeper significance
than the mere fact that they will re
ceive subscriptions when given to
them. The collectors main duty con
sist in making a personal canvass of
every man or woman in the group to
which they have been assigned. This
work should be done immediately, and
entirely completed by next Monday.
Then, the crew will know how much
must be raised among the alumni and
friends. But the work in this partic
ular does not lie entirely with the col
lectors. Every student should make
himself personally responsible to con
tribute something to this fund. Every
student is a part of the University.
The crew represents the University.
In other words the crew will repre
sent you on the Hudson next June, if
you help to make the trip possible. It
is hoped that a minimum of one dol
lar will be contributed by every one
in the community. However, smaller
and larger contributions will gladly
be .received. Each and every one help
boost to send the crew back to Pough
keepsie!
