# SECOND-HAND BOOKS
## 
### 
In many eastern institutions the
University bookstores are accustomed
to buy second hand hooks at the end
of the semester and sell them the first,
of the following semester when they
are in demand. It has been suggest
ed that a similar plan might be in
stalled in the Stanford University
Bookstore. Many of the students de
sir? to sell their textbooks within the
next two weeks. Many more will
want to buy second-hand books the
first of next semester, but will be un
able to, owing to the lack of an ex

change or medium fo.r buying and
selling the same. If a plan were de
vised whereby the Hookstore might
buy second hand books at half their
original valne and then place them
on sale at 60 or 70 per cent of the
original cot:t it is almost certain that
a long felt need on the campus would
be realized.
