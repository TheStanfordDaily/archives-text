## Student-Made Telescope Will Be Installed For Use in Old Conservatory 
### 
That peculiar mushroom appearing
structure which stands on a hill be
hind the University and at the right
of the County Road will soon cease to
be a hav;n for penniless bats and ren
devouz for scheming card sharks; it
is to become an observatory.
The building was designed and
constructed two years ago by A. G.
Atchinson, '12, and was intended ul
timat ly for the benefit of astronomy
classes. Since completion, its useful
ness lias been somewhat limited by
the absence of a telascopc. The con
struction of the telescope was under
taken by W. It. Iturbeck, 'I~>, a student
of the Electrical Engineering depart
ment.
Although a miniature when compar
ed to many of the great telescopes
now in use, the instrument to bo in
stalled will he sufficiently large to be
of great advantage for demonstration
purposes. The mirror that will bo
used is at present being made by CÂ«. W.
Richie of Pasadena, the manufacturer
of the m'rrors now in use in Mount
Wilson obs rvatory at Pasadena. The
mirro.r of the Stanford telescope has a
diameter of six inches and the instru
ment a focus of five feet. The reflect
ed images of the torr?*trial bodies will
be received from an eye piece set in
the side rather than from the end.
