# Freshman Elimination Brings Crisis at U.S.C.
## University Will Leave Southern Conference Unless First Year Men Compete. 
### 
At the University of Southern Cali
fornia it is not at all improbable that
ntsrcollegiate relations with all other
i institutions will be broken off and in
terelass sports substituted, so intense
is the feeling against the barring of
Freshmen from varsity teams. Presi
dent Bovard, head of the university,
believes that the rule is killing public
support of athletics and that drastic
action in this regard is necessary.
'I he following quotation from AI
! Waddell, amateur sports editor of the
Los Angeles Times, which appeared
in a recent issue throws some inter
esting side lights on the situation:
"Ultimately, the University of South
ern California may follow the exam
ple of Columbia and abolish intercol
legiate athletics, if the f.reshman rule
is retained in the Southern California
conference agreement.
"Dr. George F. Bovard, president of
the University of Southern California,
said last night: The technicalities of
the conference agreement are killing
the public support of intercollegiate
athletics in Southern California, and
without the public support of the con
tents, it would he better to discon
tinue athletics under the present sys
tem and develop interclass sports in
A'hich all students can take an active
part.
"The president of the local univer
sity also said that, provided his en
trance credits were satisfactory, any
! man doing passing work in his full
course has an inherent right to all
the privileges of his university, and
j should be entitled to represent his
college on the athletic field. Dr. Bo
vard believes that the faculty should
determine when a man is qualified and
eligible to represent his college in any
branch of sport.
"In Southern California the fresh
man rule has been found unsuccess
ful for many reasons. The colleges
are too small. The enrollment at Po
mona and Occidental will not stand
the rigid regulations of the great east
ern institutions, and U. S. C.'s enroll
ment of students eligible under the
conference rules is also small.
"Glaze believes that the conference
rules are eating the heart out of
Southern California intercollegiate
athletics. He believes that the facul
ties should have complete control of
| athletics in their institutions and set
tle all questions of academic stand
ing and eligibility, just as each col
lege faculty decide*; upon the qualifi
cations of candidates for degress.
"If the freshman rule is continued,
j the result will he that U. S. C. will do
one of three things. Intercollegiate
athletics will be dropped and inter
class sports alone w'll be fostered by
the administration, the faculty will
meet all comers on a gentleman's
agreement system or athletics will be
conducted upon a bush league scale
| and allowed gradually to fall into
tlecay."
