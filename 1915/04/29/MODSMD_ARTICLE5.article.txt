# WILL ELECT GRADUATE MANAGER TOMORROW
## Question of Militarism to Be Placed on Ballot to Find Student Body Opinion 
### 
E. C. Behrens, '14, and A. E. Worthy,
'15, will accept the final decree of the
Stanford voters tomorrow in the race
for the graduate managership. The
election Wednesday accomplished the
elimination of one of the contestants,
but no candidate received a majority
of all the votes cast, thereby making
necessary a second ballot. Both of
the remaining candidates are mem
bers of the Law department, and
have had wide experience in Stanford
affairs.
Behrens has been serving through
out the year as assistant to Graduate
Manager Wilcox. Worthy is president
of the Associated Students and a
member of the Intercollegiate Agree
ment. Committee which until recently
carried on negotiations with Cali
forn'a.
By the action of the Executive
Committee, the question of militarism
will be placed on the ballot fox the
serious consideration of the student
body. A crusade against this idea
has been carried on in all of the uni
versities of the country by the Col
legiate Anti-Militarism League. With
the significant words of Goldwin
Smith—"Above all nations is Human
ity"—as its motto, this society has
been promulgating a peace platform
in the leading educational institutions
of the country, and now the question
conies to Stanford for the opinion of
the students.
In the words of K. G. Karsten,
of the League, "The pro
nosal strikes all college men very
e'oso at home. The Collegiate Anti-
Militarism League feels that there is
a greater field for college men than
preparation for war. Opportunities
for social service are on every side,
and their benefits far greater than
tbosp of military both nation
ally and 'nternationallv. Why should
"oi]e?e men, of all the possible re
cruits. be drafted into an inadequate
s'vtem of security? Should not they,
of all the nation, be allow d to study
more civilized methods?"
The note insists that social service
is thf proper field for the activities
of college men, and that the very na
ture of university train'ng and ideals
makes it inconsistent for university
students to enga r re in the pursuits of
war.
lallot will contain a soace for
"ieh student to h'uiself on
the subject. It is desirable that all
"'•nressinns of oninioo be absolutely
c ineere. inasmuch as the result of the
vote will be published a« Stanford's
official stand on the matter.
