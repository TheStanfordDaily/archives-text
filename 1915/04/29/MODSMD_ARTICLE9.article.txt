# COACH CAMPBELL
## Will Not Return to Lead Track Men Next Season 
### 
With the unwelcome news that
Coach E. P. Campbell, '13, of the track
squad will be unable to return to col
lege next semester substantiated, it
becomes necessary for the graduate
manager to look about fo.r a succes
sor. It is a vacancy hard to fill.
E. P. Campbell transferred to Stan
ford from the University of Nevada at
the beginning of his Sophomore year,
and beca.'iie interested in track com
petition. He was first eligible to com
pete against California in 1912, and
placed second to .Jimmie Todd in the
110.
"Nig" was electe-i captain of the
1913 Varsity, and greatly distinguished
himself in the 61 1-u—6o 4-5 meet
placing first in the furlong and sec
ond in the crntu.ry. His hold on the
respect of the squad was cons'dered
to be jToritly responsible for the out
come of the meet, and his selection as
student coach seamed to be the next
natural step.
This step was taken, and it proved
to be most fortunate for Stanford
track athletics. Th? team easily won
from the trans-bay squad, and estab
lished records in nearly all events.
Campbell himself won eleven points,
and during the season broke the Stan
ford records in the 220 and 440.
This year, Campbell's services were
again engaged, this time with a salary
attached. His ability to develop an
all-around team was sorely tested,
and he won out, despite the most dis
couraging breaks of fortune.
Campus people still hope that
Campbell will return. Rut. he is firm,
and refuses to commit himself other
than by remarking, "Just say that I
won't be back." Three Stanford vic
tories are in a great measure attribu
table to Campbell's clever leadership
—he will he soraly missed.
