# PROFESSOR KELLOGG TO AID HOOVER COMMISSION
## Leaves Important Work to Go to Belgium WILL CARRY CAMPUS FUNDS Special Effort Will Be Made to Send $500 More to War Zone Sufferers 
### 
Professor Vernon Lyman Kellogg of
the Entomology department will an
swer the call of Herbert C. Hoover
for Americans to aid h'm in the relief
work in Belgium, and leav;-:s for the
European war zone on Wednesday.
The plans of the Stanford Relief
Committee include sending funds into
Belgium to Mr. Hoover with Profes
sor Kellogg.
The treasury of the committee is
low, scarcely $250 being on hand, and
a new campaign will be started to
raise Belgian relief money. But this
time it will be on a scale that will
bankrupt no one. At least $500 is de
sired to send with Professor Kellogg
and that above the $250 on hand will
be raised through small contributions
from the students. No personal ap
peal will be made for assistance, but
various places will be provided on the
Quad where small sums can be given
for the relief work next .week.
The advantage of sending the money
now is that it can be taken directly
to the headquarters of the relief work
in Belg'um and any difficulties in
sending in the American relief will
be obviated.
Mr. Hoover needs helpers in his
work. These helpers must be Ameri
cans, for they are practically the only
nationality who are admitted into
Belgium, and to be of any material as
sistance they must be acquainted
with the language of the people. For
this reason he has sent out a personal
appeal to many college instructors
who arc especially qualified to assist
him. It. is this appeal which Mr. Kel
logg is answering.
To do this Professor Kellogg will
have to give up the meetings and
conventions of several scientific so
cieties during the summer on the pro
grams of wh'ch he has a prominent
part. Among these is the annual
meeting of the American Society for
the Advancement of Science which
meets in San Francisco in August. He
is vice-president, of the society and
chairman of the section of Zoology.

much of the supplies sent into Bel
