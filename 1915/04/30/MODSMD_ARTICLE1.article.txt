# PROFESSOR KELLOGG TO AID HOOVER COMMISSION
## Leaves Important Work to Go to Belgium WILL CARRY CAMPUS FUNDS Special Effort Will Be Made to Send $500 More to War Zone Sufferers 
### 
Professor Vernon Lyman Kellogg of
the Entomology department will an
swer the call of Herbert C. Hoover
for Americans to aid h'm in the relief
work in Belgium, and leav;-:s for the
European war zone on Wednesday.
The plans of the Stanford Relief
Committee include sending funds into
Belgium to Mr. Hoover with Profes
sor Kellogg.
The treasury of the committee is
low, scarcely $250 being on hand, and
a new campaign will be started to
raise Belgian relief money. But this
time it will be on a scale that will
bankrupt no one. At least $500 is de
sired to send with Professor Kellogg
and that above the $250 on hand will
be raised through small contributions
from the students. No personal ap
peal will be made for assistance, but
various places will be provided on the
Quad where small sums can be given
for the relief work next .week.
The advantage of sending the money
now is that it can be taken directly
to the headquarters of the relief work
in Belg'um and any difficulties in
sending in the American relief will
be obviated.
Mr. Hoover needs helpers in his
work. These helpers must be Ameri
cans, for they are practically the only
nationality who are admitted into
Belgium, and to be of any material as
sistance they must be acquainted
with the language of the people. For
this reason he has sent out a personal
appeal to many college instructors
who arc especially qualified to assist
him. It. is this appeal which Mr. Kel
logg is answering.
To do this Professor Kellogg will
have to give up the meetings and
conventions of several scientific so
cieties during the summer on the pro
grams of wh'ch he has a prominent
part. Among these is the annual
meeting of the American Society for
the Advancement of Science which
meets in San Francisco in August. He
is vice-president, of the society and
chairman of the section of Zoology.
The wid?ly accepted belief that
much of the supplies sent into Bel
glum are confiscated by the Germans
is directly denied in a letter received
by Mrs. Kellogg from Mrs. Lou Hen
ry Hoover, '98, wife of the chairman
of the relief organization. The effec
tive methods of the relief organiza
tion and its results are also pointed
out in the letter. Mrs. Hoover says:
"There is also no truth whatever in
the statement that the Germans are
eating the food. Two cases I have
known of. and doubtless there are
three or four others (but the machin
ery is so perfect that it is impossible
to understand how they can occur
without detection) where some sol
diers have succeeded in filching sup
plies from Belgian peasants; but
wtien the leakage was found out (as
it would seem it invariably must be)
and reported to the Commanding Of
ficer, the men were severely punished,
and all the food taken, which amount
ed to a few pounds, has been paid
for."
Since the Belgian relief campaign
first started at Stanford last fall
$4140.74 has been sent to the stricken
people through the Stanford relief
committee. This is besides $2500
.raised in Palo Alto. The work of the
Stanford committee will not cease
during the summer. About $1500 of
the sum raised has come from the
alumni. Though no effort will be
made to secure money from students
during the summer, the alumni com
mittee will continue : ts work over the
summer and scud in money at the
middle of every month.
Another interesting part of Mrs.
Hoover's lette.r follows:
"One thing I am personally very
sorry over is that the United States is
not really feeding Belgium. When
she started in to do it,1 had an idea
she would keep it up and do the whole
thing, but apparently, she has had so
many troubles of her own that she is
contented to make 11 p what deficit is
left by other nationalities. I am sorry
that I have not got the figures by me
at the moment, but you can see them
yourself in the reports which I have
sent you, and which I trust you .re
ceive. The British Colonies give as
much as the United States. What
Canada and little Australia and even
little New Zealand have done is per
fectly astonishing. No appeal has
ever been made in England, but con
siderable funds have been voluntarily
turned in hereâ€”very small amounts
have come from the different continen
tal countries, and the Belgian govern
ment and Belgian people outside Bel
gium have given a large proportion."
