# WHEN ALL IS OVER
## 
### 
When the last examination blank
has been blotted and a sigh of relief
has escaped from the individual who
has spent many a sleepless night in
the final grind, there remains one
thing in college life to drive away
dull care and bring contentment to
the weary mind of the individual, and
that is Senior Week. It is a delight
ful relaxation to remain on the cam
pus, void of any responsibility, fo,r
several days after the examination
period. Then it is that one can ap
preciate the lighter side of college
life.
Underclassmen are urged, and al
ways have been urged, to stay for the
all-eventful Senior Week. This year,
more than ever before, the students
are asked to take part in the gaiety
following the final examinations
There are two reasons for this em
phasis. In the first place, the alumni
are returning to the campus and the
undergraduate body should be here to
welcome them back to the farm. It
is the one opportunity to extend a
greeting to the alumni of twenty-three
classes.
In the second place, special features
are included in the program of events
which will ha of unusual interest to
the underclassmen. Juniors, in par
ticular, should have a vital interest, in
Senior Week festivities because they
will be the ones to learn from the ex
periences of this year. It is hardly
necessary to call the attention of the
Seniors to the fact that the success of
Senior Week depends absolutely on
them. Senior Week first, then the
crew back to Poughkeepsie.
