# LUDICROUS DILEMMA IS DEPICTED IN 1915 FARCE
## MAIDEN AUNT MAKES LIFE MISERBLE Character of Rehearsals Presages a Comical Production Near the Professional. 
### 
It' you were one of an exceedingly
gay little co-educational dinner party
at the home of one of your divorced
gentlemen friends, and a telegram ar
rived announcing lhat his maiden aunt
Selina would arrive for a short visit,
would you sympathize with him? And
if you were the divorced gentleman
and had h?en exceedingly aided fin
nar.cially by aunt Selina—in fact, had
your "allowance" doubled on the event
of your marriage, and aunt Selina did
not know of your divorce, what would
you do? And, if after auntie's arrival,
and after you had introduced one of
the ladies present as your "wife," and
the Japanese aid-de-camp had been
taken to the hospital and your former
wife still in love with you walks in,
thinking it was you who were ill, what
would you do? And if after all this
had happened, and a great deal more
unmentionable here, there should come
the staggering blow that your Japan
ese governess had had small pox and
the house had been put in quaranteen,
what would you do?
Make the best of it, undoubtedly,
Avery Hopwood made the best of his
opportunity in dramatizing Mary Rob
ert Rinehart's "When a Man Maries."
The people who are rehearsing for
"Seven Days" are making the most of
their opportunity—they are taking to
their parts like a thirsty soldier takes
to a glass of grape juice, putting a
glimmer of brightness upon the per
sonell of the farce that removes any
shadow of doubt as to the more than
successful accomplishment of the dif
ficult task before them —that of pre
senting comedy in a manner that dare
not be justly labeled amateurish.
