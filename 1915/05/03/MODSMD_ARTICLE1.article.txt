# "THE MESSIAH" SINGERS WIN TRIUMPH UNIQUE IN HISTORY OF STANFORD
## VIVID SETTING IMPRESSIVE Mrs. Sara Bibby Brown Excels in Interpretation of Soprano Parts in Handel's Masterpiece 
### 
"The Messiah" was a triumph. In
the setting of the Memorial Church,
with the vivid color of the orchestra
background and tiia impressiveness of
the organ accompaniment, Handel's
great work was given in a manner
which might lie a credit to any city
in the country. Soloists and chorus
alike entered itno the spirit of the
production and the result exceeded
all expectations.
The finest solo work of the evening
may undoubtedly lie ascribed to Mrs.
Sara Bibby Brown, whose interpreta
tion of the soprano parts was all that
could be desired. From the first so
prano recitative, "There were shep
herd.". abiding in the field," Mrs.
Brown proved herself an oratorio
singer of the first rank.
The reve.rence and fine feeling with
which she sang the peaceful "Come
unto Him, all ye that labor" ranked
it easily the finest air in the first part
