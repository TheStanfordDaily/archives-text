# "THE MESSIAH" SINGERS WIN TRIUMPH UNIQUE IN HISTORY OF STANFORD
## VIVID SETTING IMPRESSIVE Mrs. Sara Bibby Brown Excels in Interpretation of Soprano Parts in Handel's Masterpiece 
### 
"The Messiah" was a triumph. In
the setting of the Memorial Church,
with the vivid color of the orchestra
background and tiia impressiveness of
the organ accompaniment, Handel's
great work was given in a manner
which might lie a credit to any city
in the country. Soloists and chorus
alike entered itno the spirit of the
production and the result exceeded
all expectations.
The finest solo work of the evening
may undoubtedly lie ascribed to Mrs.
Sara Bibby Brown, whose interpreta
tion of the soprano parts was all that
could be desired. From the first so
prano recitative, "There were shep
herd.". abiding in the field," Mrs.
Brown proved herself an oratorio
singer of the first rank.
The reve.rence and fine feeling with
which she sang the peaceful "Come
unto Him, all ye that labor" ranked
it easily the finest air in the first part
of the oratorio. The ease the singer
displayed in taking the high notes
made one forget that this is one of the
most difficult solos in the whole work.
Again in the beautiful "I know that
my Redeemer liveth" Mrs. Brown's
higher tones lost none of their clarity
by the fact that they must, as in the
earlie.r air, be sung piano. Hers is a
voice of exceptional purity and ap
peal, and it carries a benediction with
every note.
The chorus, under the leadership of
Organist L. If. Eaton, showed a finish
worthy of a professional organization.
The tenors proved stronger than the
other divisions, but the work of the
cho.nis as a whole was well-rounded.
The first chorus "And the glory of the
Lord shall be revealed" was given
with much spirit. Though the work
in the succeeding three choruses
lacked some of the finish and sense of
proportion shown in the rest of their
singing, the final great Hallelujah
chorus was superbly given, a message
at once of triumph and of peace.
The tenor solos in the hands of Mr.
Carl Anderson were admirably ren
dered. Mr. Anderson's finest oppor
tunity was undoubtedly at the begin
ning of the oratorio, and he responded
by giving the well-loved "Comfort ye
my people" with depth and insight.
Mr. Charles E. Lloyd gave a satisfac
tory interpretation of the bass recita
tives and airs, his voice being of
pleasing quality.
Miss Esther Liversidge, '17, showed
great improvement in her singing af
ter the first solo. Her finest work
was shown in the air at the end of the
first part, "He shall feed His bock."
Here Miss Livcrsidetc showed he.r rich
contralto voice at its best.
