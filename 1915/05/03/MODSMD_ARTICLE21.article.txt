With this issue The Daily Palo Alto
concludes regular publication and
lays Volume 46 away on the shelf.
It is always customary for editors to
ruminate over the achievements, suc
cesses and advancements which have
occurred during their regime. For us,
let the past stand for itself. As to
our failures, let bygones be bygones,
and may future staffs profit by the ex
perience of the past.
As to the future—there is no need
of suggestions or advice. In Warren
Paul Staniford we place absolute con
fidence. We know that he has the
ability and personality to fulfill his
responsibility as editor-in-chief in a
most capable manner.
To those who have aided in the pub
lication of the paper we have just a
word. And yet words cannot express
the feeling which impels them. A mu
tual understanding among the co
workers expresses more than phrase
ology. The readers cannot fully ap
preciate the spirit of cooperation
which makes possible a successful
paper. To the members of the staff
who have faithfully and generously
devoted their time to the interests of
the paper the success of Volume 46 is
due. For this faithful and generous
unity of purpose the editor expresses
his gratitude.
