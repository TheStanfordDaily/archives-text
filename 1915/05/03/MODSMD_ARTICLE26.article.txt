# Premier Concert Given by the Barrere Players
## Individuality, With Unity of Execution and Purpose Characterizes Wood-Wind Ensemble. 
### 
The Barrere Ensemble concert Sat
urday evening proved a fitting close
to a most successful murical season.
'I he work of this organization is j
characterized by the individual merit
of the artists and by a unity of execu
tion and purpose. Whether the nine
instruments are blended as in Gou
nod's Petite Syntphonie or whether
the larger wood-winds are used as a
background for the exquisite flute
solo by M. Bar.rere, the result is per
fect harmony.
The numbers which found most
favor with the audience were perhaps
the single wind quintettes by Pierne
and Deslandres, but the insistent ap
j plauEe failed to bring the response of
jan encore until the fourth number
1 when M. Barrere gave a charm'.ng
j flute solo in addition to the Aubert
j and Le Clai.r numbers already on the
program.
