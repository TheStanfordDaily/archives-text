# LONG-SOUGHT GYMNASIUM IS AT LAST A REALITY
## STRUCTURE IS COMPLETE IN EVERY DEPARTMENT Great Drill Hall and Marble Shower Rooms Stand Out As Welcome Improvements. 
### 
The story of the new gymnasium
can best be told by figures—and but
one number is required to express
graphically what the new building
will mean to Stanford men—the show
ers number eighty.
Compared with the facilities of the
old "temporary" structure, the new
building is palatial. The interior is
all that could be desired in gymnas
ium constructiln. The massiveness of
the drill hall, which is 120x60 feet, is
the first thing that strikes the eye of
the casual observer. Seventy-two
hundred square feet of floor space
are available for drilling purposes in
this room, which opens into a fencing
room 40x60 feet. In tha event of a
dance, 12,400 square feet of hardwood
floor would be provided.
The drill hall is steel-girded, the
beams arching from the walls to the
skylights above. On the darkest day
the gymnasium is well-lighted, no ex
pense having been spared in provid
'ng ample skylights, glass doors, and
windows.
Ventilation has been considered of
prime importance—every means to in
sure fresh air at all times having
been installed. Steam will be used
for heating purposes, radiators being
set at numerous points throughout the
building.
The locker rooms are large and
airy. The lockers are ready for in
stallation, a quantity large enough to
nrovide one for every man being or
dered. The marble showers are ex
amples of the most approved type.
Two shower rooms of forty showers
each ars provided, adjacent to the
lockers. Drinking fountains conven
iently located are one example of the
numerous comforts the new gym
nasium will afford. The cost of con
struction was $100,000, not including
extras.
