A good show with good acting
seems to he the combination that the
Senior class will offer the play lov'ng
pubi c on Wednesday evening, May 12,
when the ever-popular farce, "Seven
Days," will be presented. "Seven
Days" has already established too ex
cellent a reputation as a successful
comedy to be the subject of comment
in tliis column —all that remains is to
ba done here is to glance at the cast
that will be coupled with Avery Hop
wood's laugh-producer.
Essentially good-natured and fat
Jim Wilson, divorced, but .ready again,
will be portrayed by A. R. Meinhard,
'1"). The part of Jim Wilson is the
lead, and on Meinhard's shoulders will
fall the burden of carrying a hearty
share of the lines spoken by the male
characters.
Dallas Brown, married but happy,
will be acted by F. K. Murray, '17.
Mary Roberts Rinehart, when she
wrote 'When a Man Marries," (the or-
iginal of "Seven Days") may not have
had in mind a man of Murray's type,
but Murray succeeds in preventing his
six-feat-and-then-some from clashing
with tha "newly-wed-snooky-ookums"
part he will play.
F. R. Johnston, '17, knows how to
handle his lines in the role of Tom
Harbison. The part of Harbison is a
happy one, that is, after he discovers
that the girl whom he thinks is mar
ried. is still eligible. There is much
to Johnston's role besides lines, all of
I which is exceedingly well cared for.
Flanigan of the police will speak fc.r
himself with accentuated ability under
tha guiding hand of I). P. Johnson, '15.
Johnson makes his red wig feel at
home by providing a genuine Irish
i brogue for company.
| Buford Williams, 'Ifi, as the burg
| lnr, hasn't a thing to say for himself
throughout the play. Classified as a
pantonine burgular, Williams puts in
an appearance when not expected,
striking fear and bewilderment to the
hearts of the quarantined,
It is a mooted question whether Miss
Gard, '15, or Miss Mary Sloss, '15, has
the leading feminine role. Miss Gard
plays the part of "Kit," who is some
what of a very fascinating coquette,
yet hardly a flirt in the ordinary sense
of the term. Miss Gard fairly lives
her part, entering into the spirit of the
play in a manner that imparts a de
lightful realism.
Miss Sloss acts the role of Jim's di
vorced wife, Bella Knowles. She puts
her whole self into her lines, and "gets
them over." The part of Bella has giv
en Miss Sloss opportunity to show that
she is possessed of no little acting
ability in putting over lines that re
quire real acting.
Miss Mary Flowers, '17, finds her
self perfectly at home in the ingenue
part of Ann Brown, married-but-gay.
Miss Flowers cannot but win the r.d
mlration of the audience with her in
terpretation of several highly dramatic
scenes.
Miss Edith Smith, '16, is ably caring
for the difficult role of the maiden aunt
kill-joy, Selina Carruthers. Miss Smith
is interpreting the part in a manner
that will give the maiden aunt the posi
tion in the play that she was intend
ed to hold —the beneficent despot of
the vaccinated occupants of Jim Wil
son's small-pox besieged castle.

will be acted by F. K. Murray, '17.
Mary Roberts Rinehart, when she
wrote 'When a Man Marries," (the or-
iginal of "Seven Days") may not have
had in mind a man of Murray's type,
but Murray succeeds in preventing his
six-feat-and-then-some from clashing
with tha "newly-wed-snooky-ookums"
part he will play.
F. R. Johnston, '17, knows how to
handle his lines in the role of Tom
Harbison. The part of Harbison is a
happy one, that is, after he discovers
that the girl whom he thinks is mar
ried. is still eligible. There is much
to Johnston's role besides lines, all of
I which is exceedingly well cared for.
Flanigan of the police will speak fc.r
himself with accentuated ability under
tha guiding hand of I). P. Johnson, '15.
Johnson makes his red wig feel at
home by providing a genuine Irish
i brogue for company.
| Buford Williams, 'Ifi, as the burg
| lnr, hasn't a thing to say for himself
throughout the play. Classified as a
pantonine burgular, Williams puts in
an appearance when not expected,
striking fear and bewilderment to the
hearts of the quarantined,
It is a mooted question whether Miss
Gard, '15, or Miss Mary Sloss, '15, has
the leading feminine role. Miss Gard
plays the part of "Kit," who is some
what of a very fascinating coquette,
yet hardly a flirt in the ordinary sense
of the term. Miss Gard fairly lives
her part, entering into the spirit of the
play in a manner that imparts a de
lightful realism.
Miss Sloss acts the role of Jim's di
vorced wife, Bella Knowles. She puts
her whole self into her lines, and "gets
them over." The part of Bella has giv
en Miss Sloss opportunity to show that
she is possessed of no little acting
ability in putting over lines that re
quire real acting.
Miss Mary Flowers, '17, finds her
self perfectly at home in the ingenue
part of Ann Brown, married-but-gay.
Miss Flowers cannot but win the r.d
mlration of the audience with her in
terpretation of several highly dramatic
scenes.
Miss Edith Smith, '16, is ably caring
for the difficult role of the maiden aunt
kill-joy, Selina Carruthers. Miss Smith
is interpreting the part in a manner
that will give the maiden aunt the posi
tion in the play that she was intend
ed to hold —the beneficent despot of
the vaccinated occupants of Jim Wil
son's small-pox besieged castle.
Scats for "Seven Days," will be
placed on sale immediately following
the usual drawing for places at 1:10
Monday afternoon at the Bookstore
and at Weingartner's drug store in
Palo Alto. Tickets will he fifty cents,
seventy-five cents and one dollar.
A good show with good acting
seems to he the combination that the
Senior class will offer the play lov'ng
pubi c on Wednesday evening, May 12,
when the ever-popular farce, "Seven
Days," will be presented. "Seven
Days" has already established too ex
cellent a reputation as a successful
comedy to be the subject of comment
in tliis column —all that remains is to
ba done here is to glance at the cast
that will be coupled with Avery Hop
wood's laugh-producer.
Essentially good-natured and fat
Jim Wilson, divorced, but .ready again,
will be portrayed by A. R. Meinhard,
'1"). The part of Jim Wilson is the
lead, and on Meinhard's shoulders will
fall the burden of carrying a hearty
share of the lines spoken by the male
characters.
Dallas Brown, married but happy,
will be acted by F. K. Murray, '17.
