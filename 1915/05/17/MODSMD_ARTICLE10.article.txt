# PRESIDENT BRANNER GIVES EVIDENCE OF AFFECTION IN HIS ADDRESS TO GRADUATES
## 
### 
President Branner's address to the
graduates this morning follows in full:
Men and women of the graduating
class: — I feel as if. in the large, it
were my duty to say to you: My
young friends, here are the responsi
bilities of life: what are you going
to do with them? And 1 feel that T
ouiht to be able to draw from my six
ty-five years of experience trustwor
thy rules for your guidance and your
ultimate success in meeting and deal
ing with those responsibilities. But I
regret that, on going over the accumu
lated experiences of a lifetime, I find
so little that seems good enough to
offer you. And if from this platform,
where so many wise, noble, and in
spiring things have been said, I offex
you some weather-beaten platitudes,
you must look upon them as tokens of
my affection rather than as the tools
with which you are to carve your way
in life. I have often observed regard
ing human experience, however, that
there come times in the lives of us all
when commonplace things cease to be
common, when trite sayings and
areient proverbs seem to have fresh
and quite unexpected meanings. And
I know full well that one of the finest
thimrs about student life is the sense
of loyalty, affection, and reg.ret with
which the sound-hearted student ap
proaches the end of his last year in
college. T may therefore assume that
this is a period in your lives when
some bits of human experience may
appeal to you effectively.

Most of you have not taken life very
seriously thus far. That is not
strange; we of the faculty are not
surprised at all, but we feel great
confidence in your ultimate success
notwithstanding.
Today you join the .ranks of the
alumni of Stanford University. They
are a worthy body of men and women
meetine; the serious affairs of life and
doing their duties in every quarter.
College life is like a love story
whoso climax is reached on com
mencement day. But alas, those of
us who have been looking about us
these fifty years and more, those of
11s who have lived the love story on
toward the real end—we know that
there is not infrequently tragedy just
a little beyond what seems to be its
logical climax.
Ft does seem out of place to men
tion tragedies on an occasion like
this. Fortunately most people take a
cheerful view of life, and there is
practically no voice dissenting from
the general sentiment of optimism
♦bat fills all our hearts today.
Rut some people would have us be
lieve, indeed we henr it over and over
•r:nin. that for a young man there is
-o th !r, *T as failure. Well. 1 can
t'v sav that people who believe so
••'lust have had but. limited opnortuni
for observation. Th n professors
■'i our engineering departments have
tvpr deluded you with the idea that
in engineering structure can not fail.

From first to last they have warned
you against risks from loads and
floods and fires and catastrophes of
every possible kind. And the same
thing is true in other departments;
our efforts are largely directed to
ward the teaching of young people
how to shun errors of one kind or
another. As you go forth into the
world to-day the same care must be
taken to avoid errors and failures,
not only in your professional work,
but In all the relations of life.
As I look back along the way I have
come I see it marked here and there
with the wrecks of human lives which
forty, fifty, and sixty years ago opened
as fair and promising as the flowery
paths you see before you to-day.
Some of these wrecks were my own
class mates and my own friends who
set out with high hopes and with what
seemed to be reasonable hopes; yet
they failed. What are you going to
do about this big lesson of human ex
perience? For that is what it is. Will
you ignore it- Or will you take the
precautions necessary to avoid the
dangers that, soon or late, beset every
one of us?
A great and a perfectly reasonable
''~*nnnd 's marie nowadays for safety,
the idea being not simply to save our-
from legitimate risks that
•v<rv mr must take but to avoid
"enlish and unnecessary dangers.
Those of us who are familiar with
