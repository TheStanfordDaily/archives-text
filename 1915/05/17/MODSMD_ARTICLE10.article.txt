# PRESIDENT BRANNER GIVES EVIDENCE OF AFFECTION IN HIS ADDRESS TO GRADUATES
## 
### 
President Branner's address to the
graduates this morning follows in full:
Men and women of the graduating
class: — I feel as if. in the large, it
were my duty to say to you: My
young friends, here are the responsi
bilities of life: what are you going
to do with them? And 1 feel that T
ouiht to be able to draw from my six
ty-five years of experience trustwor
thy rules for your guidance and your
ultimate success in meeting and deal
ing with those responsibilities. But I
regret that, on going over the accumu
lated experiences of a lifetime, I find
so little that seems good enough to
offer you. And if from this platform,
where so many wise, noble, and in
spiring things have been said, I offex
you some weather-beaten platitudes,
you must look upon them as tokens of
my affection rather than as the tools
with which you are to carve your way
in life. I have often observed regard
ing human experience, however, that
there come times in the lives of us all
when commonplace things cease to be
common, when trite sayings and
areient proverbs seem to have fresh
and quite unexpected meanings. And
I know full well that one of the finest
thimrs about student life is the sense
of loyalty, affection, and reg.ret with
which the sound-hearted student ap
proaches the end of his last year in
college. T may therefore assume that
this is a period in your lives when
some bits of human experience may
appeal to you effectively.

Most of you have not taken life very
seriously thus far. That is not
strange; we of the faculty are not
surprised at all, but we feel great
confidence in your ultimate success
notwithstanding.
Today you join the .ranks of the
alumni of Stanford University. They
are a worthy body of men and women
meetine; the serious affairs of life and
doing their duties in every quarter.
College life is like a love story
whoso climax is reached on com
mencement day. But alas, those of
us who have been looking about us
these fifty years and more, those of
11s who have lived the love story on
toward the real end—we know that
there is not infrequently tragedy just
a little beyond what seems to be its
logical climax.
Ft does seem out of place to men
tion tragedies on an occasion like
this. Fortunately most people take a
cheerful view of life, and there is
practically no voice dissenting from
the general sentiment of optimism
♦bat fills all our hearts today.
Rut some people would have us be
lieve, indeed we henr it over and over
•r:nin. that for a young man there is
-o th !r, *T as failure. Well. 1 can
t'v sav that people who believe so
••'lust have had but. limited opnortuni
for observation. Th n professors
■'i our engineering departments have
tvpr deluded you with the idea that
in engineering structure can not fail.

From first to last they have warned
you against risks from loads and
floods and fires and catastrophes of
every possible kind. And the same
thing is true in other departments;
our efforts are largely directed to
ward the teaching of young people
how to shun errors of one kind or
another. As you go forth into the
world to-day the same care must be
taken to avoid errors and failures,
not only in your professional work,
but In all the relations of life.
As I look back along the way I have
come I see it marked here and there
with the wrecks of human lives which
forty, fifty, and sixty years ago opened
as fair and promising as the flowery
paths you see before you to-day.
Some of these wrecks were my own
class mates and my own friends who
set out with high hopes and with what
seemed to be reasonable hopes; yet
they failed. What are you going to
do about this big lesson of human ex
perience? For that is what it is. Will
you ignore it- Or will you take the
precautions necessary to avoid the
dangers that, soon or late, beset every
one of us?
A great and a perfectly reasonable
''~*nnnd 's marie nowadays for safety,
the idea being not simply to save our-
from legitimate risks that
•v<rv mr must take but to avoid
"enlish and unnecessary dangers.
Those of us who are familiar with
the winter amusement of skating will
recall the fact that almost every
tempting stretch of ice has signals
set up here and there to mark the
thin and dangerous piaces. Are
those danger signals useful or are
they not? To be sure, some people
like to skate just as close to danger
as possible, but I am not now con
cerned with that spirit of bravado.
Unfortunately, life cannot be staked
off like an ice covered lake, for the
simple .reason that we so often carry
about within ourselves the elements
of safety and danger, of success and
failure. Moreover it can hardly be ex
pected that you should really grasp
the full meaning of the word failure
as applied to human life. And when
I speak of failure I do not mean ad
versity. Adversity is quite another
matter, for it often develops our
strength and skill and hardens our
muscles for the real work of life. But
failure, my young friends, failure is a
word to startle. How often do we
hear it said that success and happi
ness are delusions! Rut I have never
yet heard anyone maintai nthat suf
fering and failure were delusions.
And the saddest part of it is that not
only is failure a dreadful reality, but
the man who fails is not merely a
wreck himself, but like other wrecks,
he often drags down in the whirlpool
of his own disaster a devoted wife
and innocent children.
While 1 feel proud and happy and
hopeful for you as you set forth on
the glorious voyage of life this day,
i should feel that some important
thing had been overlooked if I failed
to warn you of the existence of rocks
on which so many have been wrecked.
It is quite impossible, and it is
equally unnecessary, to go into details
about the dangers and risks and perils
of life. The thing I can do is to re
fresh your memory with the fact that
such things do exist, and to urge you
to be on your guard against them, and
to keep as far away from them as you
can.
It is not longer the case of a small
boy who, in spite of warnings, or per
haps on account of them, enjoys creat
ing a sensation by skating on thin ice,
for the only risk he runs is that of
getting a very cold bath.
There is one other subject that
seems to be carefully excluded from
such occasions as this, which 1 ven
ture to touch upon very lightly. I do
so because student life is often such
a happy-go-lucky one. You have been
warned from your childhood against
the evils of money getting, against the
vulgarity of mere riches, and all that
sort of thing. I have always adviseo
young people, and 1 always shall ad
vise them, to do whatever they legiti
mately want to do, that they follow
their own tastes and abilities in
choosing a vocation, and that they do
not keep their attention too closely
fixed upon the money they are to get.

out of it, but rather on the satisfac
tion of their own intellects, and the
gratification of their noblest aspira
tions. I have not changed my mind on
that subject, and I am not likely to
change it, but I do feel that we often
fail to make plain the important truth
that every man must earn a livlihood
for himself and for those dependent
upon him. The squandering of money
cr a disregard for its value is a vice
for which society will justly punish
you should you practice it. An emi
nent lawyer who was for several years
president of the American Bar Asso
ciation, once expressed himself thus:
"Poverty to a certain extent implies
oefeat. It is dangerous for anyone
enter upon life with a contempt for
the value of money. Every dollar a
man earns by honest labor is a tro
phy of which he has a right to be
proud. There are but few things that
hinder one more in his career of use
fulness than to be in debt or to labor
under any serious financial embarass
ment. It deadens his finer sensibili
ties, it destroys his peace of mind, and
it not infrequently undermines his
principles." (Rose, 357.)
Rut even if one is not in danger of
making a mistake about matters of
this kind, there are other dangers
all about you. And unfortunately
there is no way to guard yourselves
against them all. The best and per
haps the only thing you can do is to
provide yourselves with certain guid
ing principles and to live up to them,
and, if necessary, to die for them.
Keep in mind always that the end of
a man's career is more important than
its beginning. It is the record at the
end of the race that really counts. Do
your duty as you see it without re
gard to praise or blame, and do it
every day. Look upon service to your
fellow men as one of the chief ends of
human existence. Work with no
grudging spirit toward your employer,
and give him the benefit of your head
as well as of your hands; people who
do only the tasks set for them by
others never get far in this world.
Keep up with and a little ahead of
your profession, whatever it may be.
Read good books and keep your inter
ests broad by reading outside of your
profession. Wherever you are and
whatever your calling, we expect you
to take an interest in educational mat
ters, and that yoti will cordially sup
port educational institutions, whether
state or local. For you are all pledged
to take part in the general better
ment of the conditions of your fel
low men. Keep yourselves well in
hand; power, force, steam, genius, tal
ents, ability, do work that is wanted
only when kept under proper control.
And the true gospel of life is work di
rected toward noble and useful ends,
and in such work you will find much
happiness. Do nothing too much; the
legitimate pleasures of life will last
longer if you will take them in mod
eration. Think not evil of a rich man

because he is rich, nor of a poor man
because he is poor.
I feel that some of you are likely
to be more or less uncertain and un
decided about what you are capable
of, and what you ought to do. Capa
ble? You may be reasonably sure
that you are capable of many things
that you are not going to do. But it
is highly important, under the circum
stances, that you make up your minds
what you a.re going to do, and that
you set about it at once. You are
likely to rebel more or less against
your fate, but you will not mind much
once you get adjusted to it, and set
tled down to the routine of doing
something useful and getting interest
ed in it, and enthusiastic about it. And
may you come to live it.and may your
enthusiasm last you through to the
end of the long and happy life I heart
ily wish every one of you.
