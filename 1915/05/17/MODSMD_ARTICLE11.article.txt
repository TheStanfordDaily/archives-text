# WORTHY URGES CLASSMATES TO ATTAINMENT OF HIGH IDEALS
## 
### 
The oration of A. E. Worthy, deliv
ered at the class exercises, follows:
We have arrived today at the divid
ing of the ways. The last milestone
which wa as a class will pass has
been reached. The road divides, and
its branches extend in every direction.
For the past four years we have been
travelling along life's narrow path as
a unit, each striving to prepare him
self for the service that the world ex
pects of him. Today, we pause on the
threshold that will in a few short
hours draw its curtain and leave us
in the oute.r darkness alone. It is fit
ting that we, upon this occasion, re
call some of the pleasant memories of
our college days, and then take a look
into the future to see what is before
us and what is expected of us.
Much has been freely given us dur
ing our sojourn together. As we
think on these things, we realize more
fully than ever before that Providence
has been kind to us. We have re
ceived advantages which only a very
small minority of the youth of this na
tion have received. We have been
trained and nurtured for four years
in these halls of learning, while
others, of the same age as we, have
been toiling in the field and in the
factory, that they might maintain
'heir existence, ard in many cases
that of their families. The service
that they render toward the upbuild
ing of society is very limited, because
of their lack of culture and training.
The turning point in our lives has

been reached. Just as we have been
drinking at the fountain of knowledge
and have been the recipients of all the
good things here in college, even so
it is our duty, as we part for the four
corners of the earth, both in justice
to ourselves and to those who have
been the means whereby we have at
tained this training, to strive to repay
in some measure at least, this debt to
our fellowmen.
We have often heard the statement
that it is more blessed to give than
to .receive, and that real happiness
comes only from the satisfaction of
having served someone other than
one's self. We now have the oppor
tunity to test this doctrine. This
much we do know as a premise for
this testing:—that a man's greatness
is measured nt by the wealth he is
able to secure, nor by the knowledge
he may obtain thru the medium of
books, but rather by the influence for
the better that, he exerts over human
ity. Was Lincoln great because of
his ability to split fence .rails, or be
cause he was able to master a gram
mar textbook within less than a week
without any assistance? We rever
ence his name for his genius in un
derstanding tha needs of our nation
and his ability to realize them, and
also for his unselfish convictions for
the right. The present head of our
commonwealth will go down to ever
lasting fame, net because of his won
derful knowledge, but because he has
the foresight to know what is best for
the welfare of ou.r country and the
integrity and courage of his convic
tions, no matter what the tide of pub
lic feeling may be, to carry them out.
It is because he leads men and does
not cater to their desires when he be
lieves himself right.
Today the business world is calling
for men who are honest. Without
honesty or trust there could be no
credit or stability to business. Citi
zens are looking fo.r men to carry on
the government who are free from
corruption by corporations and other
powerful influences. A generation
ago it was the exception rather than
tha rule to find such a person. The
balance is beginning to swing the
other way. Judges are realizing now
mare than ever that in order to hold
their seats they must administer jus
tice free from the influence either of
public ( pinion or of political powers.
Clients are looking for the lawyer
who has the respect of the commu
nity in which he practices, and who
stands for right and justice at all
times.
From the class of nineteen hundred
and fifteen will come the business
men, the lawyers, the doctors, the en
gineers. the journalists, and the re
ligious leaders of tomorrow. We are
now rendy to assume our position in
society. The question is. what type
of men and women are we goinn to
prove ourselves to be? Will we be
true to the Stanford ideal? ( Are we
willing to grasp the great opportunity

that is ours and carry the fame of
our alma mater to an everasting fame
lin the different parts of earth? If
we have cultivated a respect for truth
during our stay here, let us seek with
greater devotion for the same when
we are thrown upon our own re
; sources. If thru our training here in
j this great institution of learning we
jhave endeavored to be broadminded,
and to respect the opinions of others,
| let us always strive to maintain a
! balance and breadth of view which
j recognizes the individuality of our
| fellowmen. Let us no* be imprisoned
I by selfish purposes or prejudice, but
extend our lives and ideals beyond the
confines of our immediate environ
ment. The world needs men today
who can see beyond the boundaries
of state or nation; men who cultivate
respect for races other than their
own, and who recognize a common
i humanity in all the races: and, final
j ly, men who are conscious of the
brotherhood of man and the father
hood of God. and who will direct
their energies toward the fuller reali
| zation of this great principle.
To you, Dr. Rranner, and to the
: Hoard of Trustees and members of
i the Faculty, we desire to express our
| gratitude for your having been the
! means whereby we have become col-
I lege-bred men and women of the
| Stanford type. We feel not alone that
it is our duty, but also our privilege,
to prove ourselves worthy of the
name we boar. Then we will have
Isucceeded In repaying the debt that
we owe. and our deeds and accom
plishments will go down to posterity
as the test of our greatness because
we werj willing to serve.

The turning point in our lives has

been reached. Just as we have been
drinking at the fountain of knowledge
and have been the recipients of all the
good things here in college, even so
it is our duty, as we part for the four
corners of the earth, both in justice
to ourselves and to those who have
been the means whereby we have at
tained this training, to strive to repay
in some measure at least, this debt to
our fellowmen.
We have often heard the statement
that it is more blessed to give than
to .receive, and that real happiness
comes only from the satisfaction of
having served someone other than
one's self. We now have the oppor
tunity to test this doctrine. This
much we do know as a premise for
this testing:—that a man's greatness
is measured nt by the wealth he is
able to secure, nor by the knowledge
he may obtain thru the medium of
books, but rather by the influence for
the better that, he exerts over human
ity. Was Lincoln great because of
his ability to split fence .rails, or be
cause he was able to master a gram
mar textbook within less than a week
without any assistance? We rever
ence his name for his genius in un
derstanding tha needs of our nation
and his ability to realize them, and
also for his unselfish convictions for
the right. The present head of our
commonwealth will go down to ever
lasting fame, net because of his won
derful knowledge, but because he has
the foresight to know what is best for
the welfare of ou.r country and the
integrity and courage of his convic
tions, no matter what the tide of pub
lic feeling may be, to carry them out.
It is because he leads men and does
not cater to their desires when he be
lieves himself right.
Today the business world is calling
for men who are honest. Without
honesty or trust there could be no
credit or stability to business. Citi
zens are looking fo.r men to carry on
the government who are free from
corruption by corporations and other
powerful influences. A generation
ago it was the exception rather than
tha rule to find such a person. The
balance is beginning to swing the
other way. Judges are realizing now
mare than ever that in order to hold
their seats they must administer jus
tice free from the influence either of
public ( pinion or of political powers.
Clients are looking for the lawyer
who has the respect of the commu
nity in which he practices, and who
stands for right and justice at all
times.
From the class of nineteen hundred
and fifteen will come the business
men, the lawyers, the doctors, the en
gineers. the journalists, and the re
ligious leaders of tomorrow. We are
now rendy to assume our position in
society. The question is. what type
of men and women are we goinn to
prove ourselves to be? Will we be
true to the Stanford ideal? ( Are we
willing to grasp the great opportunity

that is ours and carry the fame of
our alma mater to an everasting fame
lin the different parts of earth? If
we have cultivated a respect for truth
during our stay here, let us seek with
greater devotion for the same when
we are thrown upon our own re
; sources. If thru our training here in
j this great institution of learning we

and to respect the opinions of others,

! balance and breadth of view which
j recognizes the individuality of our
| fellowmen. Let us no* be imprisoned
I by selfish purposes or prejudice, but
extend our lives and ideals beyond the
confines of our immediate environ
ment. The world needs men today
who can see beyond the boundaries
of state or nation; men who cultivate
respect for races other than their
own, and who recognize a common
i humanity in all the races: and, final
j ly, men who are conscious of the
brotherhood of man and the father
hood of God. and who will direct
their energies toward the fuller reali

To you, Dr. Rranner, and to the
: Hoard of Trustees and members of
i the Faculty, we desire to express our

I lege-bred men and women of the

We have arrived today at the divid

which wa as a class will pass has
been reached. The road divides, and
its branches extend in every direction.
For the past four years we have been
travelling along life's narrow path as
a unit, each striving to prepare him

has been kind to us. We have re

Today the business world is calling
for men who are honest. Without
honesty or trust there could be no
credit or stability to business. Citi
zens are looking fo.r men to carry on
the government who are free from
corruption by corporations and other
powerful influences. A generation
ago it was the exception rather than
tha rule to find such a person. The
balance is beginning to swing the
other way. Judges are realizing now
mare than ever that in order to hold
their seats they must administer jus
tice free from the influence either of
public ( pinion or of political powers.
Clients are looking for the lawyer
who has the respect of the commu
nity in which he practices, and who
stands for right and justice at all
times.
From the class of nineteen hundred
and fifteen will come the business
men, the lawyers, the doctors, the en
gineers. the journalists, and the re
ligious leaders of tomorrow. We are
now rendy to assume our position in
society. The question is. what type
of men and women are we goinn to
prove ourselves to be? Will we be
true to the Stanford ideal? ( Are we
willing to grasp the great opportunity

that is ours and carry the fame of
our alma mater to an everasting fame
lin the different parts of earth? If
we have cultivated a respect for truth
during our stay here, let us seek with
greater devotion for the same when
we are thrown upon our own re
; sources. If thru our training here in
j this great institution of learning we
jhave endeavored to be broadminded,
and to respect the opinions of others,
| let us always strive to maintain a
! balance and breadth of view which
j recognizes the individuality of our
| fellowmen. Let us no* be imprisoned
I by selfish purposes or prejudice, but
extend our lives and ideals beyond the
confines of our immediate environ
ment. The world needs men today
who can see beyond the boundaries
of state or nation; men who cultivate
respect for races other than their
own, and who recognize a common
i humanity in all the races: and, final
j ly, men who are conscious of the
brotherhood of man and the father
hood of God. and who will direct
their energies toward the fuller reali
| zation of this great principle.
To you, Dr. Rranner, and to the
: Hoard of Trustees and members of
i the Faculty, we desire to express our
| gratitude for your having been the
! means whereby we have become col-
I lege-bred men and women of the
| Stanford type. We feel not alone that
it is our duty, but also our privilege,
to prove ourselves worthy of the
name we boar. Then we will have
Isucceeded In repaying the debt that
we owe. and our deeds and accom
plishments will go down to posterity
as the test of our greatness because
we werj willing to serve.
The oration of A. E. Worthy, deliv
ered at the class exercises, follows:
We have arrived today at the divid
ing of the ways. The last milestone
which wa as a class will pass has
been reached. The road divides, and
its branches extend in every direction.
For the past four years we have been
travelling along life's narrow path as
a unit, each striving to prepare him
self for the service that the world ex
pects of him. Today, we pause on the
threshold that will in a few short
hours draw its curtain and leave us
in the oute.r darkness alone. It is fit
ting that we, upon this occasion, re
call some of the pleasant memories of
our college days, and then take a look
into the future to see what is before
us and what is expected of us.
Much has been freely given us dur
ing our sojourn together. As we
think on these things, we realize more
fully than ever before that Providence
has been kind to us. We have re
ceived advantages which only a very
small minority of the youth of this na
tion have received. We have been
trained and nurtured for four years
in these halls of learning, while
others, of the same age as we, have
been toiling in the field and in the
factory, that they might maintain
'heir existence, ard in many cases
that of their families. The service
that they render toward the upbuild
ing of society is very limited, because
of their lack of culture and training.
The turning point in our lives has

been reached. Just as we have been
drinking at the fountain of knowledge
and have been the recipients of all the
good things here in college, even so
it is our duty, as we part for the four
corners of the earth, both in justice
to ourselves and to those who have
been the means whereby we have at
tained this training, to strive to repay
in some measure at least, this debt to
our fellowmen.
We have often heard the statement
that it is more blessed to give than
to .receive, and that real happiness
comes only from the satisfaction of
having served someone other than
one's self. We now have the oppor
tunity to test this doctrine. This
much we do know as a premise for
this testing:—that a man's greatness
is measured nt by the wealth he is
able to secure, nor by the knowledge
he may obtain thru the medium of
books, but rather by the influence for
the better that, he exerts over human
ity. Was Lincoln great because of
his ability to split fence .rails, or be
cause he was able to master a gram
mar textbook within less than a week
without any assistance? We rever
ence his name for his genius in un
derstanding tha needs of our nation
and his ability to realize them, and
also for his unselfish convictions for
the right. The present head of our
commonwealth will go down to ever
lasting fame, net because of his won
derful knowledge, but because he has
the foresight to know what is best for
the welfare of ou.r country and the
integrity and courage of his convic
tions, no matter what the tide of pub
lic feeling may be, to carry them out.
