# WORTHY URGES CLASSMATES TO ATTAINMENT OF HIGH IDEALS
## 
### 
The oration of A. E. Worthy, deliv
ered at the class exercises, follows:
We have arrived today at the divid
ing of the ways. The last milestone
which wa as a class will pass has
been reached. The road divides, and
its branches extend in every direction.
For the past four years we have been
travelling along life's narrow path as
a unit, each striving to prepare him
self for the service that the world ex
pects of him. Today, we pause on the
threshold that will in a few short
hours draw its curtain and leave us
in the oute.r darkness alone. It is fit
ting that we, upon this occasion, re
call some of the pleasant memories of
our college days, and then take a look
into the future to see what is before
us and what is expected of us.
Much has been freely given us dur
ing our sojourn together. As we
think on these things, we realize more
fully than ever before that Providence
has been kind to us. We have re
ceived advantages which only a very
small minority of the youth of this na
tion have received. We have been
trained and nurtured for four years
in these halls of learning, while
others, of the same age as we, have
been toiling in the field and in the
factory, that they might maintain
'heir existence, ard in many cases
that of their families. The service
that they render toward the upbuild
ing of society is very limited, because
of their lack of culture and training.
The turning point in our lives has

been reached. Just as we have been
drinking at the fountain of knowledge
and have been the recipients of all the
good things here in college, even so
it is our duty, as we part for the four
corners of the earth, both in justice
to ourselves and to those who have
been the means whereby we have at
tained this training, to strive to repay
in some measure at least, this debt to
our fellowmen.
We have often heard the statement
that it is more blessed to give than
to .receive, and that real happiness
comes only from the satisfaction of
having served someone other than
one's self. We now have the oppor
tunity to test this doctrine. This
much we do know as a premise for
this testing:â€”that a man's greatness
is measured nt by the wealth he is
able to secure, nor by the knowledge
he may obtain thru the medium of
books, but rather by the influence for
the better that, he exerts over human
ity. Was Lincoln great because of
his ability to split fence .rails, or be
cause he was able to master a gram
mar textbook within less than a week
without any assistance? We rever
ence his name for his genius in un
derstanding tha needs of our nation
and his ability to realize them, and
also for his unselfish convictions for
the right. The present head of our
commonwealth will go down to ever
lasting fame, net because of his won
derful knowledge, but because he has
