# IN RETURN
## 
### 
As we depart, we go to discharge an
obligation. The obligation is three
fold. First, is the obligation to the
community in which we work. So
ciety depends upon the college trained
men and women for leaders. And
this dependence becomes increasingly
great in this growing era of scientific
advancement. To justify our college
training, we, as Stanford men and
women, must serve in the capacity of
leaders for the communities in which
we move.
Second, the obligation is to our
selves. Given the equipment, no man
can fully realize himself except
through service for others. If we do
not use the training that is ours in
meeting the needs of others we shall
lose that which we have; if we do not
apply that which we possess it van
ishes. "Every branch that beareth
not fruit will be taken away."
Third, the obligation is to our Alma
Mater. She has made possible the op
portunity which is ours. To her we
shall owe whatever success we shall
enjoy. What we have we hold in
trust. To Stanford we owe allegiance
to her name, fidelity to her ideals. In
serving others we shall serve her and
be true to our trust.
And now to each other we say fare
well and good fortune, and to Stan
ford we swear allegiance.
