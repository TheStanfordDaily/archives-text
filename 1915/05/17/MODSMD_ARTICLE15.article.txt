# PROM ATTRACTS THRONGS TO THE MEMORIAL COURT
## Band Plays Concert While Groups Pay Their Respects at Six Refreshment Booths. 
### 
The Senior Prom attracted its hun
dreds of Stanford people to the lawns
and arcades of Memorial Court Friday
evening. Men and women of the
graduating class, Faculty, visitors
from home, and representatives of the
three lower classes paid their respects
at the refreshment booths, enjoyed the
concert given by the Hand, and walked
and talked.
Senior promenaders enjoy them
selves thoughtfully. This open air
festival, coming so near the end of
Stanford years, has a way of bridging
the old with the new ways of life. So
the commencement candidates walk,
and talk, and laugh, and think all
sorts of last thoughts.
Leave takings were in order through
out the evening. Students exchanged
best wishes with professors and fel
low students " â€”in case I don't see
you again fefore 1 leave." One could
not get away from the big significance
of a Senior Prom, charged full of the
"good-bye" feeling. The last parting
seemed fa,r enough away that one
could combine his regrets with smiles.
Unique among the ceremonies of the
week, the hour combined two opposite
kinds of human feeling, and formed
lasting enjoyment.
