# OUR VOTIVE GIFTS

Class I'oem, by Agues lvendrick Gray.
Foregathered in this new-wrought court, we come
To hallow it with votive gifts of love.
An offering of branching trees we bring;
And while the chimes once mo,re ring out above,
Linking today with Stanford's yesterday,
We who as fledglings, wings half-spreading, stand,
And these, the children of her younger years,
Join here our love together, heart and hand,
Grateful for gifts made lavishly our own;
Rich gifts of strengthened will and broadened mind
Good gifts of friends and lasting fellowship,
Of vision lifted and of hearts made kind.
May this green Incense Cedar be our pledge
Of changeless fealty and remembrance high; —
Our last farewell before we tread the paths
That distant from the colonnades may lie.
May flowering shrub and Orient Deodar,
Whose long, dark branches drop in eastern grace,
And tall Italian Cypress, straight and fair,
Guard well the spirit of this friendly space.
May tendriled ivy that shall climb the heights
Of these white walls, cling, as our memories fast, —
Unloosed by winds of time or fate, —shall cling
About our Alma Mater to the last.
