# PERFORMANCE OF STANFORD IN TRACK MEET IS NOTABLE
## Eight Cardinal Tracksters Secure Honors in Pacific Coast Conference Meet. 
### 
Eight Stanford track and field stars
entered the Pacific Coast Intercol
legiate Conference Meet at the Expo
sition oval on May 8 and placed sec
ond in the final count, with a total of
:?1 points. California entered a large
complement, winning out by six tal
lies, while Oregon Agricultural Col
lege ran up 18 points fo.r third honors.
F. S. Murray, '10, was the individ
ual star of the day, corning through
with sixteen points. He nosed out
Johnson of Santa Clara for first place
in the century in 10:.2 time, but mat
ters were reversed in the furlong,
when Murray gave way to Johnson's
record-breaking :22 1-5, with Kelly
of U. S. C. third.
Kelly showed his accustomed form
in the high sticks, winning handily
from Murray in:15.2. Murray came
back, however, in the low hurdles,
with a win of :25.1 to his credit.
Peg Caughey, '18, broke into the list
of record-holders by establishing a
new mark in the shot-put, with a
heave of 40 feet 0 1-2 inches. The
former record was 40 feet 4 1-2 inches,
held by Rice of California.
Captain Ponnett of Stanford won a
pretty 880-yard dash from Peebe, the
Blue and Gold first year man, in 1
minute 57 3-5 seconds.
Sisson took his favorite event, the
broad jump, with a leap of 22 feet 3
inches, beating out Wallace of Santa
Clara and Maker of California.
The relay, which went to the Stan
ford quartet, was an exciting race
from start to finish. West, Peal and
Lynn gave Ponnett a slight disadvan
tage on the last lap. He received the
baton five yards behind Jackson of
California, but clinched the victory
and the Conference Relay Trophy
with a determined spurt on the home
stretch. Ponnett's performance was
especially creditable, inasmuch as a
scant twenty minutes separated the
half and the relay.
The date of the meet placed the
Cardinal contingent under a decided
handicap, owing to the stress of final
examinations. With a few more stars
entered, tbe Stanford team would
have made a strong bid for first
honors.
