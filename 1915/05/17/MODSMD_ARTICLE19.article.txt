# SENIOR CAST PUTS "SEVEN DAYS" OVER WITH FUN TO SPARE
## Starlight Beams Generously on Senior Farceurs in Roles of Exaggerated Mirth AUDIENCE SHOWS APPROVAL 
### 
The prescription reads liKe this:
When in doubt take a rap. You.r cas
ual readers will arch their eyebrows
until you have hammered out the first
few curses. Along toward the second
intermission the tension relaxes. Af
ter you have scornfully dashed the
last whiff of vitriol in the faces of
the players and dramatists, your out
burst assumes all the dignity and
authority of a Criticism, and people
are convinced that they had the
wrong idea all the time.
There is one disagreeable part about
reviewing a good performance. If you
know the people who took part, you
have to forego all the love taps you
had planned for your enemies.
"Seven Days" was as unassuming
and complete a success as a Senior
Week audience has been allowed to
laugh over in several years. The play
was comical; not droll, or subtle, or
swaddled in dignity, but plainly hilar
ious. "Farce" is a word of vast im
port. To live up to the name, a show
has to ignore all the polite conven
tions and serve up the joys of life with
a confidential wink. Even soft lights
and pensive music are taboo in the
love scenes. Everything is before
your eyes, all the time, and there are
no mental bridges to build.
Most of those present Wednesday
evening knew that "Seven Days"
could be a very congenial farce if it
was treated right. The fact remains
that the cast in this last Senior farce
was the best rounded and the most ex
cellent throughout which has been as
sembled during the year. Few of
those who saw the workout will think
this praise subsidized.
The story of "Seven Days" can't be
followed without a dark lantern be
cause it takes too many sidesteps.
Here is the best we can do in two
hundred words:
James Wilson thinks divorced life
is great. He invites a young married
couple and Kitty McNair, an attrac
tive maid, in to help celebrate the
first anniversary. Aunt Selina, who
holds the long end of Wilson's bank
roll. who knows nothing of Wilson's
divorce, dec'des to visit her nephew
and his wife in their feathered nest.
She arrives after the cocktails have
been passed around, in a flurry of en
thusiasm. Kitty McNair assumes the
role of wife, and the process of pull
ing the wool begins.
Holla Knowles (formerly Wilson)
drops in. fearing that her recent hus
band is ill. She also becomes jealous
of the pseudo wife. After a suitor of
Miss McNair drops in.and Flannigan,
of the police forces awakes from his
nap in the kitchen, the house is quar
antined for smallpox. With such a
good start the scramble begins. For
seven days the strange troop keeps
house. Aunt Selina has her doubts at
times, but Wilson decides that his for
me.r helpmeet is a jewel, Kitty McNair
sees her suitor in the right light, and
it all ends very happily. The Burg
lar. meanwhile, also quarantined, has
lived a gay life up and down the dumb
waiter and the chimney.
The Senior Farce didn't attain per
fection. There were drags in the ac
tion. The second act, which showed
the unhappy family in the process of
cooking and cleaning in the kitchen
was particularly held by lack of spon
taneity in dialogue. There was so
much excellence about the piece,
though, that one has to search fo.r
other defects, and they are better left
alne. Ruford Williams, as the Burg
lar. was remarkable in pantomime,
expression of movement, and gesture.
There have been few pieces of exag
gerated character work done at Stan
ford in three years which rival the
admiration earned by Williams in his
