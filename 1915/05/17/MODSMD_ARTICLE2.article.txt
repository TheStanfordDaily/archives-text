# LOCAL BELGIAN RELIEF WORK VERY CREDITABLE
## Ten Thousand Dollars Sent to Starving People Since Last October by Faculty, Alumni, Students and Palo Altans HOOVER ATTAINS SUCCESS Many Appeals For Contributions Since Last Fall Have Been Answered Quickly and Generously by Women of Faculty

When the impending exhaustion of
foodstuffs became evident in Belgium
the American and Spanish ambassa
dors negotiated with the German mili
tary authorities and the Allied gov
ernments, so that such importations
were to be facilitated and protected in
their transmission to the civil popula
tion. Mr. Herbert C. Hoover, '95, who
was made chairman of the Commis
sion for Relief in Belgium, has direct
ed a most competent and efficient re
lief work. Canada has equaled the
contributions of America, while aid
lias also poured into the fund from
Great Britain, Spain, Italy, India and
the Orient.
The first call to Stanford came
through D.r. Branner who was able to
send $2500 from the subscriptions of
the faculty and students.
A faculty committee was then or
ganized to secure regular monthly
contributions from the faculty, stu
dents and alumni. The latter have
responded to the appeals made with a
large share of the Stanford contribu
tions. Mrs. Douglass Adams, the
chairman of the branch of the corn
mi! tee, has received many letters and
contributions from those who were
giving in their own communities, but
wished to express their loyalty to
Stanford in a concrete way. Since No
vember the committee has sent an
average of $700 each month to New
York and within a week after the re
ceipt of the money the food supplies
were en route to their destination.
The May contribution was $550 from
Stanford, $100 from Palo Alto, besides
$100 which was realized from the ten
cent donations. This special fund of
$100 was added to from various
sources and is to be used by Profes
sor Kellogg as he sees fit for the re
lief of specially distressing cases.
Since Dr. Branner's call the sum of
$4,658 has been raised by the com
mittee from the faculty, which de
serves special credit for its support,
the students, and the alumni, who
have given one-half of this amount.
The committee in Palo Alto has do
nated $.1,125. Altogether $10,383 has
been collected and sent to the relief
Professor V. L. Kellogg, who was
of the Belgians.
