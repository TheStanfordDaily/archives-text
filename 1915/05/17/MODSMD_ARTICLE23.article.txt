# HISTORIAN CHRONICLES WORK AND PLAY OF THE EXPOSITION CLASS
## 
### 
Following is the history ready by
F. C. Hamilton at the exercises Friday:
The "Exposition Class" of this Uni
versity is about to step from the doors
of its alma mater. Before we leave
the dear old Quad let us reilect for a

few minutes over
the events of the
past four years.
Let us call to
mind the vic
tories and de
feats; refresh
our memories
over past hap
penings which
it has been our
pleasure to ex

perience; and chronicle the history of
the University as reflected th.rongh
the class of 1915.
It seems but yesterday that we cut
loose from our hom- surroundings,
took on a new lease of life, and with
initiative and independence set out on
a four year climb to the top of the
hill to secure the much coveted de
gree. During that time we were
to fall into many chasms, individ
ually and collectively, .receive many
scratches and bruises, but eventually
reach the summit where we stand to
day, looking forward for more worlds
to conquer.
We early learned the significance of
the old adage "In union there is
strength." It was on the first Satur
day after registration that we fell be
fore the Sophomores in the annual
underclass tie-up contest. We were
the first to enter the University after j
the "water cure" and the real old-time
tubbing had been prohibited by the
Trustees. Naturally we were more or
less self-opinionated because we had
nothing to fear at the moment, but
our defeat in the rush strongly em
phasized the subserviency of our po
sition.
The fall of 1911 was the first time
t Uo t the Stanford yearlings had to
forego the annual Freshman football
contest with the California cubs. A
decree by the Faculty, issued in May
1911, forever abolished the contest be
tween the babe teams. This, however,
did not interfere with the playing of
a Freshman schedule of eleven games
in which the Stanford 1915 team
scored 107 points to its opponents 27,
and were defeated only twice. It was
the period when several players of
varsity caliber were unearthed. The
twenty Freshmen awarded their block
numerals for competing on the class
team included Milt Haley (captain),
Wines, Hirasawa, Frost, Soper, But
ton. Rloeser, Wilson, Jacomini, Clark,
Steinhart, Erb, Risling, Sim, Ross,
Templeton, Cookson, Wunne, Hutch
inson and Thoburn. Two of these
players. Milt Haley and Bert Risling,
were later to take their places in the
ranks of the 1911 varsity team which
met defeat at the hands of the Blue
and Gold by a score of 21-3.
An innovation in class activities
was introduced by the Exposition
class on January 19, 1912. It had al
ways been the custom for the Univer
sity President to welcome the new
students to the campus in September
of each year. When 1915 entered as

Freshmen, Dr. Jordan was on a
world's peace mission in the Far East
and was thus unable to extend the
customary cordial greeting. In its
place the 1915 class planned a birth
day dinner for our honored Chancel
lor on the occasion of his sixty-first
birthday upon his return from the
Orient. We had exchanged places
w itii Dr. Jordan, being host to him on
his anniversary.
It was in our Freshman year that
Student Control was launched by the
student body. We had heard from the
time that we first set foot on the
Quad that this was"the Golden Age
of Stanford," and .rightly it may be
termed such when we stop to consider
the full significance of self-govern
ment. This is one of the most im
portant events in our four years of
activity. On the present Senior Class
more than on any other class has de
volved the responsibilities of making
Student Control a success. It was
left to us to make or break the oppor
tunities which were ours, and which
we hand down to other classes to
cherish and to strengthen.
Keeping true to tradition 1915
turned out a victorious Freshman
crew, captained by Olmstead, with
Reineman for coxswain. Other mem
bers of the crew who pulled an oar
on the 1915 eight were Hulsman,
Rahm, Haggart, Wolford, Jacomini,
Jeffers and Sinclair. It was in the
spring of the same year that Bonnett
ran his first intercollegiate race, win
ning the half mile in two minutes flat.
The same year Johnny Couch and
Avery Howe were the mainstays of
the baseball team on the pitcher's
mound. In its Freshman year 1915
did not confine its activities to ath
letics by any means. It was repre
sented on the intercollegiate debating
team by Higgins, and on the Tri-State
team by Worthy. In the interclass
debate, the team consisting of Kil
eline, Covle and Higg'ns worsted the
Sophomores in the annual forensic
melee.
We have dwelt at length on the
Freshman year for it is the one year
which stands out in every class as
the one which has meant most to the
individual members of the class. Let
us now hasten on to more recent hap
penings.
Truly this may be called "The
Clolden Age of Stanford" when we stop
to reflect on the events of the past
four years. The first step in which
we played our part was when student
affairs were placed in the hands of
the students. And with this came a
closer bond between the Faculty and
undergraduates, which has grown
stronger year by year. With it has
come a closer cooperation with the
Board of Trustees and the alumni, un
til today the four sides of the Quad
rangle are linked together as co
workers. striving for the best inter
ests of the University, casting aside
personal prejudices. We have wit
nessed the strengthening of scholas
tic standards at the University, and
275 of us are here today, having met
requirements, to present our
selves for graduation. It has been
"'•r rood fortune to be honored by
*«vo presidents during our brief resi

deuce on trie farm. In Dr. Jordan we
have a warm friend and counsellor;
in Dr. Branner, one whose entire time j
is devoted to serving the best inter
ests of the University, and one who is
ever ready to listen to our appeals
and troubles.
Members of the class have spread
the name and fame of Stanford to all
points of the compass on various trips
of athletic teams. Wherever they
went, whether in the rugby trip to
Vancouver, the baseball tour of Japan,
the crew journey to the Poughkeep
sie regatta, or the track trip to the
conference meets in the Middle West,
they carried the true Stanford spirit
of sportsmanship, and whether they
won or lost were always looked upon
with equal favor. It is the men of
Stanford that count, and not merely
their achievements on the turf, dia
mond, water or cinder path. And 1915
has contributed no small share in
I turning out its quota of real Stanford
men.
Against our friend the enemy we
have witnessed especially productive
years when we measure victories
against defeats; one defeat, one tie
and two victories in rugby; one de
feat and three victories in track; four
times winner on the water against the
Blue and Cold eights; split event in
four intercollegiate battles on the
forensic platform, and lost three out
of four intercollegiate baseball series.
In our Sophomore year, sad to say,
but nevertheless true, we were defeat
ed in the annual underclass tie-up due
to the superior number of inferior
forces. Soon after the ' semester
opened Stanford attained her major
ity in age on October 1, 1912. Just
one year later Dr. Branner was in
stalled as President of the University,
a memorable event in the eyes of each
one of us. And then in our Junior
year came the Plug-Ugly with its at
tendant consequences. The powers
that be. namely the University Con
ference. abolished the Plug-Ugly as it
was then presented and left it to the
classes of '15 and '10 to find a satis
factory substitute for the upperclass
battle. The Plug-Ugly was revised, as
we all know, by omitting the objec
tionable features and reinstating the
remains. What ; ts future will be only
time can tell. The rush itself proved
a dismal failure last semester. The
Seniors took absolutely no interest in
withholding the onslaught of the
j Juniors, and the sixteen class lacked
j even the incentive to secure their own
plug hats.
The laying of the posters when we
were Juniors gave us a world of ex
perience when it came to foiling the
vain endeavors cf the 191G class last
semester. The cup of experience is
often a bitter dose to swallow when
it carries defeat with it. but that was
price that 1915 had to pay when
she attempted to lay the Junior
posters in the fall of 1913. Last se
mester it was a different story we told
tb? campus the next morning as the
c un rose over the horizon. It was the
morning after the sixteeners had made
a fut le attempt to lav their posters.
The story was of the Juniors in stocks,
and how they had been completely
baffled in their attempt to smear the

campus with the customary third-
I year posters.
Two of the most recent happenings
i in which the class has played an ac
j tive part are th? opening of the Stan
; ford Union and the Woman's Club
House, and the crisis in intercollegiate
relations with California. The inter-
I est that the class of 191") takes in the
! Union is probably stronger than any
I other class for the reason that its
members look at its significance from
two angles, namely, as undergraduates
and alumni. As Seniors we realize
its importance as a potent force in
promoting democracy between stu
dents and faculty; and as alumni,
which we hope to be within a few
days, we can see its significance as a
commingling ground for students,
alumni. Faculty and Trustees. More
over, "We need the Union" has been
ringing in our ears since the first se
mester, and now it is an integral part
of graduate and undergraduate life.
Never in the history of athletics has
such a crisis existed in the athletic
relations between California and Stan-

ford as during the past semester. To
the Seniors, more than to any other
class, the present situation is due, be
cause on them has fallen the difficult
task of trying to adjust matters and
yet remain firm in what the Univer
s ty stood for in sportsmanship. These
are epochs of no slight importance in
comparison with the usual events of
each college generation.
Of peerades, initiations, proms, co
tillions, operas, rallies, Irish mara
thons and bonfires we have had our
full. And by the way, the 1915
Freshman bonfire reached the high
water mark in the accomplishments of
a similar nature. In interclass activ
ities, 1915 has shared the honors with
the other classes and taken a fair
sized number of victories. In base
ball the class has twice been declared
champion; in rugby, records indicate
1915 a one-time winner; three basket
ball championships have been accred
ited to the class, and two soccer vic
tories. In interclass crew racing the
1915 four has proven superior to all
others on two occasions, the last vic
tory standing out far above all others
when the shell was steered to victory
by Miss Elsie Olcese.
The Exposition Class has been well
to the fore when one stops to consider
or compare the number of athletes
that each class has contributed to
varsity teams. It is true that the
class has not stood far above others
but it has certainly held its own. In
rugby we have contributed Haley, Ris
ling, Erb, Soper, Wines and Rehm as
a galaxy of football stars to the var
sity teams.
Our track athletes are few, but
what they lack in numbers is made
up in quality. The class includes
among its members two Pacific Coast
record holders. Captain Bonnett, who
has never been defeated in an inter
collegiate race, heads the list. He is
the only four-star athlete now in the
University, having secured the dis
tinction by winning the half-mile four
times in succession against California.
He holds the Coast record of 1:54:4
in his popular distance, while Don
Dawson has recorded alongside of his
name the mark of 23 feet 7 inches in
the broad jump, making a Coast rec
ord which will probably stand for
some years to come. Bedeau has
shown his superiority in the shot put
three years in succession. In Ric
Templeton the class has been repre
sented by one of the most versatile
athletes that ever donned a spike, and
because of his superior ability he has
been chosen to captain the track team
next year.
The success of the varsity crews for
the past three years is largely due to
the material furnished from the class
of 1915. Led by Captain Jacomini.
Jeffers, Rehm, Hulsman, Wolford,
Haggart, Olmstead and Reineman
have all occupied seats in the varsity
shell. This group of oarsmen has
been the hope and marrow of the vic
torious eights, and has been largely
instrumental in making possible the
trip to the Poughkeepsie regatta this
year.
In baseball Howe, Couch. Dent, Mc-
Closkey and Downing have proved
themselves reliable at all times. Three
times have Dent and McCloskey been
nicked to face the Blue and Gold. Un
able to get along without Babe Dent,
the team has selected him to lead
their destinies next year as captain
of th? nine.
During the past four years minor
sports at Stanford have taken on a
new lease of life, and interest in them
has increased materially. Due to the
efforts of members of the '15 class
basketball was placed on an intercol
legiate basis and elevated to the rank
of a minor sport last year. One year
the entire basketball team was com
posed of players from this class,
namely Davis, Dutton, Blodgett, Ling.
Worthy, Reynolds and Farrar. Wor
thv and Reynolds have guided the
quintet through two seasons and Blod
e:et has been drafted to act as captain
"•ext year. In tennis, Hutchinson.
Sheldon and Sloss form a trio of rac
quet wielders of no ordinary ability.
The latter two captained the varsity
team ir two successive years. To soc
cer. 1915 has contributed Captain

Blodget, Hughes, Dutton, Stenhardt,
Adams and Boyle, the latter having
been selected to captain next year's
soccer team.
Perchance at first glance too much
emphasis lias been placed on athlet
ics, but let us look into other activi
ties and see whether or not the class
of 1915 has played its part. In jour
nalism. the editorship of The Daily
l'alo Alto has been entrusted to Si
monson and Hamilton; and the edi
torial work on the Sequoia to Bennett.
Miss Tisdale and Miss McCoy have
served as woman's editors on the
"Daily." Kilcline, Wynne and Hawk
ins have also been engaged in jour
nalistic work. Hagen lias wielded the
hammer in the publication of Chapar
ral during the past year with Oliver
and Olsen as art editors. Worthy and
Hawkins, as editor and manager re
spectively, are responsible for the 1915
Quad.
In debating Coyle has been the
mainstay of all forensic contests for
the past three years, and has been
ably seconded by Higgins, Weston,
Worthy and Kilcline.
Two dramatic productions of un
usual merit have gone down in the
annals as a credit to the 1915 class.
First of these was the Sophomore
play, "On the Quiet," and second, the
Junior Opera, "The College Prince,"
written by M. A. Hagen. Members of
the class who have made a name for
themselves on the Stanford stage are
the Misses Taff, Gard, Sloss, Trent,
Copper, de Vilbiss and Bryan, and the
Messrs. Forbes, Paul, Gibb, Hynemann,
Bennett, Adams, Higgins, Allen, Tho
burn and Dutton. In musical circles,
Bradford and Gibb have led and man
aged the Band for the past year;
Lynch has guided the destinies of the
Glee Club, and Bennett has made a
name for himself as a soloist.
With Bob Worthy at the helm, the
affairs of the Student Body have been
guided through many ups and downs
during the past year and weathered
the storm successfully, thanks to the
skipper at the steering wheel. L. F.
Reineman has acted as vice-president
of the Student Body and P. J. McClos
key as secretary. The class has been
represented on the Executive Com
mittee by Templeton, Bonnett, Jaco
mini, Rehm, Davis and Bedeau. In
the control of student affairs Beaver,
Bedeau, Card, Davis, Dutton, Gibb,
Hagen, Lynch, Paul, Simonson, Wor
thy and Ziser played a part as mem
bers of the University Conference.
Simonson. as Student Adviser, and
Worthy, as a representative of the
Conference were members of the Stu
dent Council.
The fate of the class has been in
the hands of eight class presidents,
namely, Jameson, Spalding, Davis,
Rehm, Wines, Jacomini, Dent and
Erb. Stiller, Miss Taff, Sinclair, Al
len, Cartwright, Stevens and Temple
ton have been vice-presidents, respec
tively. The writing and .reading of
the minutes has been taken care of by
the Misses Wallace, Burg, Van Zwa
lenburg. McCoy, Todd, McC'ord, Bry
an and Gardiner. As financiers of
the class we record the names of Al
len, Oven, Clark, Partridge, Wynne,
Ling, and Warren.
From the standpoint of scholastic
attainment Fifteen has contributed to
Phi Beta Kappa no less than thirty
four members. The list includes
Misses Browning. Conkling, Curry,
Gray, Ix)op, La Fetra, Newman, Hagel,
Overacker, Poindexter, Prout, Anna
Henrietta Rehmke, Ball. Job, Winn,
Harborer, Hobson, Kreps, Maines,
Rouiller, Sanfo.rd, Tag, Van Etten,
Wildman, Young and Girdner; and
the Messrs. Adams, Moore, Cook,
Clark, Coyle, McCabe and Piatt.
In women's activities Fifteen has
'>cen equally prominent during the
nast four years. Women in the class
have taken an active part in further
ing the success of tennis, fencing,
rowing and basketball, and within the
'nst month won the championship in
the interclass field day. Among
those who have contributed to the var
'ous activities and to conducting the
of the five hundred are the
Misses Gard, McCord, Walls, TafT.
Gardner, Hunt, McCarthy, McCoy,
Gray. Wells. Duryea, Drury, Tisdale.
Parkinson. Bassett, Wood. Knox, Cur
tis and La Fetra.
Thus we have reviewed the part
which this graduating class has

played in the last four years of Stan
ford history. What part it shall con
tinue to play in the capacity of alum
ni remains to be chronicled.
Following is the history ready by
F. C. Hamilton at the exercises Friday:
The "Exposition Class" of this Uni
versity is about to step from the doors
of its alma mater. Before we leave

players. Milt Haley and Bert Risling,
were later to take their places in the
ranks of the 1911 varsity team which
met defeat at the hands of the Blue
and Gold by a score of 21-3.
An innovation in class activities
was introduced by the Exposition
class on January 19, 1912. It had al

Truly this may be called "The

we played our part was when student

Members of the class have spread
the name and fame of Stanford to all

ringing in our ears since the first se

of graduate and undergraduate life.

to the fore when one stops to consider
or compare the number of athletes
that each class has contributed to
varsity teams. It is true that the
class has not stood far above others
but it has certainly held its own. In
rugby we have contributed Haley, Ris
ling, Erb, Soper, Wines and Rehm as
a galaxy of football stars to the var
sity teams.
Our track athletes are few, but
what they lack in numbers is made
up in quality. The class includes
among its members two Pacific Coast
record holders. Captain Bonnett, who
has never been defeated in an inter
collegiate race, heads the list. He is
the only four-star athlete now in the
University, having secured the dis
tinction by winning the half-mile four
times in succession against California.
He holds the Coast record of 1:54:4
in his popular distance, while Don
Dawson has recorded alongside of his
name the mark of 23 feet 7 inches in
the broad jump, making a Coast rec
ord which will probably stand for
some years to come. Bedeau has
shown his superiority in the shot put
three years in succession. In Ric
Templeton the class has been repre
sented by one of the most versatile
athletes that ever donned a spike, and
because of his superior ability he has
been chosen to captain the track team
next year.
The success of the varsity crews for
the past three years is largely due to
the material furnished from the class
of 1915. Led by Captain Jacomini.
Jeffers, Rehm, Hulsman, Wolford,
Haggart, Olmstead and Reineman
have all occupied seats in the varsity
shell. This group of oarsmen has
been the hope and marrow of the vic
torious eights, and has been largely
instrumental in making possible the
trip to the Poughkeepsie regatta this
year.
In baseball Howe, Couch. Dent, Mc-
Closkey and Downing have proved
themselves reliable at all times. Three
times have Dent and McCloskey been
nicked to face the Blue and Gold. Un
able to get along without Babe Dent,
the team has selected him to lead
their destinies next year as captain
of th? nine.
During the past four years minor
sports at Stanford have taken on a
new lease of life, and interest in them
has increased materially. Due to the
efforts of members of the '15 class
basketball was placed on an intercol
legiate basis and elevated to the rank
of a minor sport last year. One year
the entire basketball team was com
posed of players from this class,
namely Davis, Dutton, Blodgett, Ling.
Worthy, Reynolds and Farrar. Wor
thv and Reynolds have guided the
quintet through two seasons and Blod
e:et has been drafted to act as captain
"•ext year. In tennis, Hutchinson.
Sheldon and Sloss form a trio of rac
quet wielders of no ordinary ability.
The latter two captained the varsity
team ir two successive years. To soc
cer. 1915 has contributed Captain

Blodget, Hughes, Dutton, Stenhardt,
Adams and Boyle, the latter having
been selected to captain next year's
soccer team.
Perchance at first glance too much
emphasis lias been placed on athlet
ics, but let us look into other activi
ties and see whether or not the class
of 1915 has played its part. In jour
nalism. the editorship of The Daily
l'alo Alto has been entrusted to Si
monson and Hamilton; and the edi
torial work on the Sequoia to Bennett.
Miss Tisdale and Miss McCoy have
served as woman's editors on the
"Daily." Kilcline, Wynne and Hawk
ins have also been engaged in jour
nalistic work. Hagen lias wielded the
hammer in the publication of Chapar
ral during the past year with Oliver
and Olsen as art editors. Worthy and
Hawkins, as editor and manager re
spectively, are responsible for the 1915
Quad.
In debating Coyle has been the
mainstay of all forensic contests for
the past three years, and has been
ably seconded by Higgins, Weston,
Worthy and Kilcline.
Two dramatic productions of un
usual merit have gone down in the
annals as a credit to the 1915 class.
First of these was the Sophomore
play, "On the Quiet," and second, the
Junior Opera, "The College Prince,"
written by M. A. Hagen. Members of
the class who have made a name for
themselves on the Stanford stage are
the Misses Taff, Gard, Sloss, Trent,
Copper, de Vilbiss and Bryan, and the
Messrs. Forbes, Paul, Gibb, Hynemann,
Bennett, Adams, Higgins, Allen, Tho
burn and Dutton. In musical circles,
Bradford and Gibb have led and man
aged the Band for the past year;
Lynch has guided the destinies of the
Glee Club, and Bennett has made a
name for himself as a soloist.
With Bob Worthy at the helm, the
affairs of the Student Body have been
guided through many ups and downs
during the past year and weathered
the storm successfully, thanks to the
skipper at the steering wheel. L. F.
Reineman has acted as vice-president
of the Student Body and P. J. McClos
key as secretary. The class has been
represented on the Executive Com
mittee by Templeton, Bonnett, Jaco
mini, Rehm, Davis and Bedeau. In
the control of student affairs Beaver,
Bedeau, Card, Davis, Dutton, Gibb,
Hagen, Lynch, Paul, Simonson, Wor
thy and Ziser played a part as mem
bers of the University Conference.
Simonson. as Student Adviser, and
Worthy, as a representative of the
Conference were members of the Stu
dent Council.
The fate of the class has been in
the hands of eight class presidents,
namely, Jameson, Spalding, Davis,
Rehm, Wines, Jacomini, Dent and
Erb. Stiller, Miss Taff, Sinclair, Al
len, Cartwright, Stevens and Temple
ton have been vice-presidents, respec
tively. The writing and .reading of
the minutes has been taken care of by
the Misses Wallace, Burg, Van Zwa
lenburg. McCoy, Todd, McC'ord, Bry
an and Gardiner. As financiers of
the class we record the names of Al
len, Oven, Clark, Partridge, Wynne,
Ling, and Warren.
From the standpoint of scholastic
attainment Fifteen has contributed to
Phi Beta Kappa no less than thirty
four members. The list includes
Misses Browning. Conkling, Curry,
Gray, Ix)op, La Fetra, Newman, Hagel,
Overacker, Poindexter, Prout, Anna
Henrietta Rehmke, Ball. Job, Winn,
Harborer, Hobson, Kreps, Maines,
Rouiller, Sanfo.rd, Tag, Van Etten,
Wildman, Young and Girdner; and
the Messrs. Adams, Moore, Cook,
Clark, Coyle, McCabe and Piatt.
In women's activities Fifteen has
'>cen equally prominent during the
nast four years. Women in the class
have taken an active part in further
ing the success of tennis, fencing,
rowing and basketball, and within the
'nst month won the championship in
the interclass field day. Among
those who have contributed to the var
'ous activities and to conducting the
of the five hundred are the
Misses Gard, McCord, Walls, TafT.
Gardner, Hunt, McCarthy, McCoy,
Gray. Wells. Duryea, Drury, Tisdale.
Parkinson. Bassett, Wood. Knox, Cur
tis and La Fetra.
Thus we have reviewed the part
which this graduating class has

played in the last four years of Stan
ford history. What part it shall con
tinue to play in the capacity of alum
ni remains to be chronicled.
Following is the history ready by
F. C. Hamilton at the exercises Friday:
The "Exposition Class" of this Uni
versity is about to step from the doors
of its alma mater. Before we leave
the dear old Quad let us reilect for a

few minutes over
the events of the
past four years.
Let us call to
mind the vic
tories and de
feats; refresh
our memories
over past hap
penings which
it has been our
pleasure to ex

perience; and chronicle the history of
the University as reflected th.rongh
the class of 1915.
It seems but yesterday that we cut
loose from our hom- surroundings,
took on a new lease of life, and with
initiative and independence set out on
a four year climb to the top of the
hill to secure the much coveted de
gree. During that time we were
to fall into many chasms, individ
ually and collectively, .receive many
scratches and bruises, but eventually
reach the summit where we stand to
day, looking forward for more worlds
to conquer.
We early learned the significance of
the old adage "In union there is
strength." It was on the first Satur
day after registration that we fell be
fore the Sophomores in the annual
underclass tie-up contest. We were
the first to enter the University after j
the "water cure" and the real old-time
tubbing had been prohibited by the
Trustees. Naturally we were more or
less self-opinionated because we had
nothing to fear at the moment, but
our defeat in the rush strongly em
phasized the subserviency of our po
sition.
The fall of 1911 was the first time
t Uo t the Stanford yearlings had to
forego the annual Freshman football
contest with the California cubs. A
decree by the Faculty, issued in May
1911, forever abolished the contest be
tween the babe teams. This, however,
did not interfere with the playing of
a Freshman schedule of eleven games
in which the Stanford 1915 team
scored 107 points to its opponents 27,
and were defeated only twice. It was
the period when several players of
varsity caliber were unearthed. The
twenty Freshmen awarded their block
numerals for competing on the class
team included Milt Haley (captain),
Wines, Hirasawa, Frost, Soper, But
ton. Rloeser, Wilson, Jacomini, Clark,
Steinhart, Erb, Risling, Sim, Ross,
Templeton, Cookson, Wunne, Hutch
inson and Thoburn. Two of these
players. Milt Haley and Bert Risling,
were later to take their places in the
ranks of the 1911 varsity team which
met defeat at the hands of the Blue
and Gold by a score of 21-3.
An innovation in class activities
was introduced by the Exposition
class on January 19, 1912. It had al
ways been the custom for the Univer
sity President to welcome the new
students to the campus in September
of each year. When 1915 entered as

Freshmen, Dr. Jordan was on a
world's peace mission in the Far East
and was thus unable to extend the
customary cordial greeting. In its
place the 1915 class planned a birth
day dinner for our honored Chancel
lor on the occasion of his sixty-first
birthday upon his return from the
Orient. We had exchanged places
w itii Dr. Jordan, being host to him on
his anniversary.
It was in our Freshman year that
Student Control was launched by the
student body. We had heard from the
time that we first set foot on the
Quad that this was"the Golden Age
of Stanford," and .rightly it may be
termed such when we stop to consider
the full significance of self-govern
ment. This is one of the most im
portant events in our four years of
activity. On the present Senior Class
more than on any other class has de
volved the responsibilities of making
Student Control a success. It was
left to us to make or break the oppor
tunities which were ours, and which
we hand down to other classes to
cherish and to strengthen.
Keeping true to tradition 1915
turned out a victorious Freshman
crew, captained by Olmstead, with
Reineman for coxswain. Other mem
bers of the crew who pulled an oar
on the 1915 eight were Hulsman,
Rahm, Haggart, Wolford, Jacomini,
Jeffers and Sinclair. It was in the
spring of the same year that Bonnett
ran his first intercollegiate race, win
ning the half mile in two minutes flat.
The same year Johnny Couch and
Avery Howe were the mainstays of
the baseball team on the pitcher's
mound. In its Freshman year 1915
did not confine its activities to ath
letics by any means. It was repre
sented on the intercollegiate debating
team by Higgins, and on the Tri-State
team by Worthy. In the interclass
debate, the team consisting of Kil
eline, Covle and Higg'ns worsted the
Sophomores in the annual forensic
melee.
We have dwelt at length on the
Freshman year for it is the one year
which stands out in every class as
the one which has meant most to the
individual members of the class. Let
us now hasten on to more recent hap
penings.
Truly this may be called "The
Clolden Age of Stanford" when we stop
to reflect on the events of the past
four years. The first step in which
we played our part was when student
affairs were placed in the hands of
the students. And with this came a
closer bond between the Faculty and
undergraduates, which has grown
stronger year by year. With it has
come a closer cooperation with the
Board of Trustees and the alumni, un
til today the four sides of the Quad
rangle are linked together as co
workers. striving for the best inter
ests of the University, casting aside
personal prejudices. We have wit
nessed the strengthening of scholas
tic standards at the University, and
275 of us are here today, having met
requirements, to present our
selves for graduation. It has been
"'•r rood fortune to be honored by
*«vo presidents during our brief resi

deuce on trie farm. In Dr. Jordan we
have a warm friend and counsellor;
in Dr. Branner, one whose entire time j
is devoted to serving the best inter
ests of the University, and one who is
ever ready to listen to our appeals
and troubles.
Members of the class have spread
the name and fame of Stanford to all
points of the compass on various trips
of athletic teams. Wherever they
went, whether in the rugby trip to
Vancouver, the baseball tour of Japan,
the crew journey to the Poughkeep
sie regatta, or the track trip to the
conference meets in the Middle West,
they carried the true Stanford spirit
of sportsmanship, and whether they
won or lost were always looked upon
with equal favor. It is the men of
Stanford that count, and not merely
their achievements on the turf, dia
mond, water or cinder path. And 1915
has contributed no small share in
I turning out its quota of real Stanford
men.
Against our friend the enemy we
have witnessed especially productive
years when we measure victories
against defeats; one defeat, one tie
and two victories in rugby; one de
feat and three victories in track; four
times winner on the water against the
Blue and Cold eights; split event in
four intercollegiate battles on the
forensic platform, and lost three out
of four intercollegiate baseball series.
In our Sophomore year, sad to say,
but nevertheless true, we were defeat
ed in the annual underclass tie-up due
to the superior number of inferior
forces. Soon after the ' semester
opened Stanford attained her major
ity in age on October 1, 1912. Just
one year later Dr. Branner was in
stalled as President of the University,
a memorable event in the eyes of each
one of us. And then in our Junior
year came the Plug-Ugly with its at
tendant consequences. The powers
that be. namely the University Con
ference. abolished the Plug-Ugly as it
was then presented and left it to the
classes of '15 and '10 to find a satis
factory substitute for the upperclass
battle. The Plug-Ugly was revised, as
we all know, by omitting the objec
tionable features and reinstating the
remains. What ; ts future will be only
time can tell. The rush itself proved
a dismal failure last semester. The
Seniors took absolutely no interest in
withholding the onslaught of the
j Juniors, and the sixteen class lacked
j even the incentive to secure their own
plug hats.
The laying of the posters when we
were Juniors gave us a world of ex
perience when it came to foiling the
vain endeavors cf the 191G class last
semester. The cup of experience is
often a bitter dose to swallow when
it carries defeat with it. but that was
price that 1915 had to pay when
she attempted to lay the Junior
posters in the fall of 1913. Last se
mester it was a different story we told
tb? campus the next morning as the
c un rose over the horizon. It was the
morning after the sixteeners had made
a fut le attempt to lav their posters.
The story was of the Juniors in stocks,
and how they had been completely
baffled in their attempt to smear the

campus with the customary third-
I year posters.
Two of the most recent happenings
i in which the class has played an ac
j tive part are th? opening of the Stan
; ford Union and the Woman's Club
House, and the crisis in intercollegiate
relations with California. The inter-
I est that the class of 191") takes in the
! Union is probably stronger than any
I other class for the reason that its
members look at its significance from
two angles, namely, as undergraduates
and alumni. As Seniors we realize
its importance as a potent force in
promoting democracy between stu
dents and faculty; and as alumni,
which we hope to be within a few
days, we can see its significance as a
commingling ground for students,
alumni. Faculty and Trustees. More
over, "We need the Union" has been
ringing in our ears since the first se
mester, and now it is an integral part
of graduate and undergraduate life.
Never in the history of athletics has
such a crisis existed in the athletic
relations between California and Stan-

ford as during the past semester. To
the Seniors, more than to any other
class, the present situation is due, be
cause on them has fallen the difficult
task of trying to adjust matters and
yet remain firm in what the Univer
s ty stood for in sportsmanship. These
are epochs of no slight importance in
comparison with the usual events of
each college generation.
Of peerades, initiations, proms, co
tillions, operas, rallies, Irish mara
thons and bonfires we have had our
full. And by the way, the 1915
Freshman bonfire reached the high
water mark in the accomplishments of
a similar nature. In interclass activ
ities, 1915 has shared the honors with
the other classes and taken a fair
sized number of victories. In base
ball the class has twice been declared
champion; in rugby, records indicate
1915 a one-time winner; three basket
ball championships have been accred
ited to the class, and two soccer vic
tories. In interclass crew racing the
1915 four has proven superior to all
others on two occasions, the last vic
tory standing out far above all others
when the shell was steered to victory
by Miss Elsie Olcese.
The Exposition Class has been well
to the fore when one stops to consider
or compare the number of athletes
that each class has contributed to
varsity teams. It is true that the
class has not stood far above others
but it has certainly held its own. In
rugby we have contributed Haley, Ris
ling, Erb, Soper, Wines and Rehm as
a galaxy of football stars to the var
sity teams.
Our track athletes are few, but
what they lack in numbers is made
up in quality. The class includes
among its members two Pacific Coast
record holders. Captain Bonnett, who
has never been defeated in an inter
collegiate race, heads the list. He is
the only four-star athlete now in the
University, having secured the dis
tinction by winning the half-mile four
times in succession against California.
He holds the Coast record of 1:54:4
in his popular distance, while Don
Dawson has recorded alongside of his
name the mark of 23 feet 7 inches in
the broad jump, making a Coast rec
ord which will probably stand for
some years to come. Bedeau has
shown his superiority in the shot put
three years in succession. In Ric
Templeton the class has been repre
sented by one of the most versatile
athletes that ever donned a spike, and
because of his superior ability he has
been chosen to captain the track team
next year.
The success of the varsity crews for
the past three years is largely due to
the material furnished from the class
of 1915. Led by Captain Jacomini.
Jeffers, Rehm, Hulsman, Wolford,
Haggart, Olmstead and Reineman
have all occupied seats in the varsity
shell. This group of oarsmen has
been the hope and marrow of the vic
torious eights, and has been largely
instrumental in making possible the
trip to the Poughkeepsie regatta this
year.
In baseball Howe, Couch. Dent, Mc-
Closkey and Downing have proved
themselves reliable at all times. Three
times have Dent and McCloskey been
nicked to face the Blue and Gold. Un
able to get along without Babe Dent,
the team has selected him to lead
their destinies next year as captain
of th? nine.
During the past four years minor
sports at Stanford have taken on a
new lease of life, and interest in them
has increased materially. Due to the
efforts of members of the '15 class
basketball was placed on an intercol
legiate basis and elevated to the rank
of a minor sport last year. One year
the entire basketball team was com
posed of players from this class,
namely Davis, Dutton, Blodgett, Ling.
Worthy, Reynolds and Farrar. Wor
thv and Reynolds have guided the
quintet through two seasons and Blod
e:et has been drafted to act as captain
"•ext year. In tennis, Hutchinson.
Sheldon and Sloss form a trio of rac
quet wielders of no ordinary ability.
The latter two captained the varsity
team ir two successive years. To soc
cer. 1915 has contributed Captain

Blodget, Hughes, Dutton, Stenhardt,
Adams and Boyle, the latter having
been selected to captain next year's
soccer team.
Perchance at first glance too much
emphasis lias been placed on athlet
ics, but let us look into other activi
ties and see whether or not the class
of 1915 has played its part. In jour
nalism. the editorship of The Daily
l'alo Alto has been entrusted to Si
monson and Hamilton; and the edi
torial work on the Sequoia to Bennett.
Miss Tisdale and Miss McCoy have
served as woman's editors on the
"Daily." Kilcline, Wynne and Hawk
ins have also been engaged in jour
nalistic work. Hagen lias wielded the
hammer in the publication of Chapar
ral during the past year with Oliver
and Olsen as art editors. Worthy and
Hawkins, as editor and manager re
spectively, are responsible for the 1915
Quad.
In debating Coyle has been the
mainstay of all forensic contests for
the past three years, and has been
ably seconded by Higgins, Weston,
Worthy and Kilcline.
Two dramatic productions of un
usual merit have gone down in the
annals as a credit to the 1915 class.
First of these was the Sophomore
play, "On the Quiet," and second, the
Junior Opera, "The College Prince,"
written by M. A. Hagen. Members of

the control of student affairs Beaver,
Bedeau, Card, Davis, Dutton, Gibb,
Hagen, Lynch, Paul, Simonson, Wor
thy and Ziser played a part as mem
bers of the University Conference.
Simonson. as Student Adviser, and
Worthy, as a representative of the
Conference were members of the Stu
dent Council.
The fate of the class has been in
the hands of eight class presidents,
namely, Jameson, Spalding, Davis,
Rehm, Wines, Jacomini, Dent and
Erb. Stiller, Miss Taff, Sinclair, Al

the minutes has been taken care of by
the Misses Wallace, Burg, Van Zwa

From the standpoint of scholastic

Thus we have reviewed the part
which this graduating class has

ford history. What part it shall con

The "Exposition Class" of this Uni

players. Milt Haley and Bert Risling,
were later to take their places in the
ranks of the 1911 varsity team which
met defeat at the hands of the Blue
and Gold by a score of 21-3.

on the 1915 eight were Hulsman,
Rahm, Haggart, Wolford, Jacomini,
Jeffers and Sinclair. It was in the
spring of the same year that Bonnett
ran his first intercollegiate race, win
ning the half mile in two minutes flat.
The same year Johnny Couch and
Avery Howe were the mainstays of
the baseball team on the pitcher's
mound. In its Freshman year 1915
did not confine its activities to ath
letics by any means. It was repre
sented on the intercollegiate debating
team by Higgins, and on the Tri-State
team by Worthy. In the interclass
debate, the team consisting of Kil
eline, Covle and Higg'ns worsted the
Sophomores in the annual forensic
melee.
We have dwelt at length on the
Freshman year for it is the one year
which stands out in every class as
the one which has meant most to the
individual members of the class. Let
us now hasten on to more recent hap
penings.
Truly this may be called "The
Clolden Age of Stanford" when we stop
to reflect on the events of the past
four years. The first step in which
we played our part was when student
affairs were placed in the hands of
the students. And with this came a
closer bond between the Faculty and
undergraduates, which has grown
stronger year by year. With it has
come a closer cooperation with the
Board of Trustees and the alumni, un
til today the four sides of the Quad
rangle are linked together as co
workers. striving for the best inter
ests of the University, casting aside
personal prejudices. We have wit
nessed the strengthening of scholas
tic standards at the University, and
275 of us are here today, having met
requirements, to present our
selves for graduation. It has been
"'•r rood fortune to be honored by
*«vo presidents during our brief resi

deuce on trie farm. In Dr. Jordan we
have a warm friend and counsellor;
in Dr. Branner, one whose entire time j
is devoted to serving the best inter
ests of the University, and one who is
ever ready to listen to our appeals
and troubles.
Members of the class have spread
the name and fame of Stanford to all
points of the compass on various trips
of athletic teams. Wherever they
went, whether in the rugby trip to
Vancouver, the baseball tour of Japan,
the crew journey to the Poughkeep
sie regatta, or the track trip to the
conference meets in the Middle West,
they carried the true Stanford spirit
of sportsmanship, and whether they
won or lost were always looked upon
with equal favor. It is the men of
Stanford that count, and not merely
their achievements on the turf, dia
mond, water or cinder path. And 1915
has contributed no small share in
I turning out its quota of real Stanford
men.
Against our friend the enemy we
have witnessed especially productive
years when we measure victories
against defeats; one defeat, one tie
and two victories in rugby; one de
feat and three victories in track; four
times winner on the water against the
Blue and Cold eights; split event in
four intercollegiate battles on the
forensic platform, and lost three out
of four intercollegiate baseball series.
In our Sophomore year, sad to say,
but nevertheless true, we were defeat
ed in the annual underclass tie-up due
to the superior number of inferior
forces. Soon after the ' semester
opened Stanford attained her major
ity in age on October 1, 1912. Just
one year later Dr. Branner was in
stalled as President of the University,
a memorable event in the eyes of each
one of us. And then in our Junior
year came the Plug-Ugly with its at
tendant consequences. The powers
that be. namely the University Con
ference. abolished the Plug-Ugly as it
was then presented and left it to the
classes of '15 and '10 to find a satis
factory substitute for the upperclass
battle. The Plug-Ugly was revised, as
we all know, by omitting the objec
tionable features and reinstating the
remains. What ; ts future will be only
time can tell. The rush itself proved
a dismal failure last semester. The
Seniors took absolutely no interest in
withholding the onslaught of the
j Juniors, and the sixteen class lacked
j even the incentive to secure their own
plug hats.
The laying of the posters when we
were Juniors gave us a world of ex
perience when it came to foiling the
vain endeavors cf the 191G class last
semester. The cup of experience is
often a bitter dose to swallow when
it carries defeat with it. but that was
price that 1915 had to pay when
she attempted to lay the Junior
posters in the fall of 1913. Last se
mester it was a different story we told
tb? campus the next morning as the
c un rose over the horizon. It was the
morning after the sixteeners had made
a fut le attempt to lav their posters.
The story was of the Juniors in stocks,
and how they had been completely
baffled in their attempt to smear the

campus with the customary third-
I year posters.
Two of the most recent happenings
i in which the class has played an ac
j tive part are th? opening of the Stan
; ford Union and the Woman's Club
House, and the crisis in intercollegiate
relations with California. The inter-
I est that the class of 191") takes in the
! Union is probably stronger than any
I other class for the reason that its
members look at its significance from
two angles, namely, as undergraduates
and alumni. As Seniors we realize
its importance as a potent force in
promoting democracy between stu
dents and faculty; and as alumni,
which we hope to be within a few
days, we can see its significance as a
commingling ground for students,
alumni. Faculty and Trustees. More
over, "We need the Union" has been
ringing in our ears since the first se
mester, and now it is an integral part
of graduate and undergraduate life.
Never in the history of athletics has
such a crisis existed in the athletic
relations between California and Stan-

ford as during the past semester. To
the Seniors, more than to any other
class, the present situation is due, be
cause on them has fallen the difficult
task of trying to adjust matters and
yet remain firm in what the Univer
s ty stood for in sportsmanship. These
are epochs of no slight importance in
comparison with the usual events of
each college generation.
Of peerades, initiations, proms, co
tillions, operas, rallies, Irish mara
thons and bonfires we have had our
full. And by the way, the 1915
Freshman bonfire reached the high
water mark in the accomplishments of
a similar nature. In interclass activ
ities, 1915 has shared the honors with
the other classes and taken a fair
sized number of victories. In base
ball the class has twice been declared
champion; in rugby, records indicate
1915 a one-time winner; three basket
ball championships have been accred
ited to the class, and two soccer vic
tories. In interclass crew racing the
1915 four has proven superior to all
others on two occasions, the last vic
tory standing out far above all others
when the shell was steered to victory
by Miss Elsie Olcese.
The Exposition Class has been well
to the fore when one stops to consider
or compare the number of athletes
that each class has contributed to
varsity teams. It is true that the
class has not stood far above others
but it has certainly held its own. In
rugby we have contributed Haley, Ris
ling, Erb, Soper, Wines and Rehm as
a galaxy of football stars to the var
sity teams.
Our track athletes are few, but
what they lack in numbers is made
up in quality. The class includes
among its members two Pacific Coast
record holders. Captain Bonnett, who
has never been defeated in an inter
collegiate race, heads the list. He is
the only four-star athlete now in the
University, having secured the dis
tinction by winning the half-mile four
times in succession against California.
He holds the Coast record of 1:54:4
in his popular distance, while Don
Dawson has recorded alongside of his
name the mark of 23 feet 7 inches in
the broad jump, making a Coast rec
ord which will probably stand for
some years to come. Bedeau has
shown his superiority in the shot put
three years in succession. In Ric
Templeton the class has been repre
sented by one of the most versatile
athletes that ever donned a spike, and
because of his superior ability he has
been chosen to captain the track team
next year.
The success of the varsity crews for
the past three years is largely due to
the material furnished from the class
of 1915. Led by Captain Jacomini.
Jeffers, Rehm, Hulsman, Wolford,
Haggart, Olmstead and Reineman
have all occupied seats in the varsity
shell. This group of oarsmen has
been the hope and marrow of the vic
torious eights, and has been largely
instrumental in making possible the
trip to the Poughkeepsie regatta this
year.
In baseball Howe, Couch. Dent, Mc-
Closkey and Downing have proved
themselves reliable at all times. Three
times have Dent and McCloskey been
nicked to face the Blue and Gold. Un
able to get along without Babe Dent,
the team has selected him to lead
their destinies next year as captain
of th? nine.
During the past four years minor
sports at Stanford have taken on a
new lease of life, and interest in them
has increased materially. Due to the
efforts of members of the '15 class
basketball was placed on an intercol
legiate basis and elevated to the rank
of a minor sport last year. One year
the entire basketball team was com
posed of players from this class,
namely Davis, Dutton, Blodgett, Ling.
Worthy, Reynolds and Farrar. Wor
thv and Reynolds have guided the
quintet through two seasons and Blod
e:et has been drafted to act as captain
"•ext year. In tennis, Hutchinson.
Sheldon and Sloss form a trio of rac
quet wielders of no ordinary ability.
The latter two captained the varsity
team ir two successive years. To soc
cer. 1915 has contributed Captain

Blodget, Hughes, Dutton, Stenhardt,
Adams and Boyle, the latter having
been selected to captain next year's
soccer team.
Perchance at first glance too much
emphasis lias been placed on athlet
ics, but let us look into other activi
ties and see whether or not the class
of 1915 has played its part. In jour
nalism. the editorship of The Daily
l'alo Alto has been entrusted to Si
monson and Hamilton; and the edi
torial work on the Sequoia to Bennett.
Miss Tisdale and Miss McCoy have
served as woman's editors on the
"Daily." Kilcline, Wynne and Hawk
ins have also been engaged in jour
nalistic work. Hagen lias wielded the
hammer in the publication of Chapar
ral during the past year with Oliver
and Olsen as art editors. Worthy and
Hawkins, as editor and manager re
spectively, are responsible for the 1915
Quad.
In debating Coyle has been the
mainstay of all forensic contests for
the past three years, and has been
ably seconded by Higgins, Weston,
Worthy and Kilcline.
Two dramatic productions of un
usual merit have gone down in the
annals as a credit to the 1915 class.
First of these was the Sophomore
play, "On the Quiet," and second, the
Junior Opera, "The College Prince,"
written by M. A. Hagen. Members of
the class who have made a name for
themselves on the Stanford stage are
the Misses Taff, Gard, Sloss, Trent,
Copper, de Vilbiss and Bryan, and the
Messrs. Forbes, Paul, Gibb, Hynemann,
Bennett, Adams, Higgins, Allen, Tho
burn and Dutton. In musical circles,
Bradford and Gibb have led and man
aged the Band for the past year;
Lynch has guided the destinies of the
Glee Club, and Bennett has made a
name for himself as a soloist.
With Bob Worthy at the helm, the
affairs of the Student Body have been
guided through many ups and downs
during the past year and weathered
the storm successfully, thanks to the
skipper at the steering wheel. L. F.
Reineman has acted as vice-president
of the Student Body and P. J. McClos
key as secretary. The class has been
represented on the Executive Com
mittee by Templeton, Bonnett, Jaco
mini, Rehm, Davis and Bedeau. In
the control of student affairs Beaver,
Bedeau, Card, Davis, Dutton, Gibb,
Hagen, Lynch, Paul, Simonson, Wor
thy and Ziser played a part as mem
bers of the University Conference.
Simonson. as Student Adviser, and
Worthy, as a representative of the
Conference were members of the Stu
dent Council.
The fate of the class has been in
the hands of eight class presidents,
namely, Jameson, Spalding, Davis,
Rehm, Wines, Jacomini, Dent and
Erb. Stiller, Miss Taff, Sinclair, Al
len, Cartwright, Stevens and Temple
ton have been vice-presidents, respec
tively. The writing and .reading of
the minutes has been taken care of by
the Misses Wallace, Burg, Van Zwa
lenburg. McCoy, Todd, McC'ord, Bry
an and Gardiner. As financiers of
the class we record the names of Al
len, Oven, Clark, Partridge, Wynne,
Ling, and Warren.
From the standpoint of scholastic
attainment Fifteen has contributed to
Phi Beta Kappa no less than thirty
four members. The list includes
Misses Browning. Conkling, Curry,
Gray, Ix)op, La Fetra, Newman, Hagel,
Overacker, Poindexter, Prout, Anna
Henrietta Rehmke, Ball. Job, Winn,
Harborer, Hobson, Kreps, Maines,
Rouiller, Sanfo.rd, Tag, Van Etten,
Wildman, Young and Girdner; and
the Messrs. Adams, Moore, Cook,
Clark, Coyle, McCabe and Piatt.
In women's activities Fifteen has
'>cen equally prominent during the
nast four years. Women in the class
have taken an active part in further
ing the success of tennis, fencing,
rowing and basketball, and within the
'nst month won the championship in
the interclass field day. Among
those who have contributed to the var
'ous activities and to conducting the
of the five hundred are the
Misses Gard, McCord, Walls, TafT.
Gardner, Hunt, McCarthy, McCoy,
Gray. Wells. Duryea, Drury, Tisdale.
Parkinson. Bassett, Wood. Knox, Cur
tis and La Fetra.
Thus we have reviewed the part
which this graduating class has

played in the last four years of Stan
ford history. What part it shall con
tinue to play in the capacity of alum
ni remains to be chronicled.
Following is the history ready by
F. C. Hamilton at the exercises Friday:
The "Exposition Class" of this Uni
versity is about to step from the doors
of its alma mater. Before we leave
the dear old Quad let us reilect for a

few minutes over
the events of the
past four years.
Let us call to
mind the vic
tories and de
feats; refresh
our memories
over past hap
penings which
it has been our
pleasure to ex

perience; and chronicle the history of
the University as reflected th.rongh
the class of 1915.
It seems but yesterday that we cut
loose from our hom- surroundings,
took on a new lease of life, and with
initiative and independence set out on
a four year climb to the top of the
hill to secure the much coveted de
gree. During that time we were
to fall into many chasms, individ
ually and collectively, .receive many
scratches and bruises, but eventually
reach the summit where we stand to
day, looking forward for more worlds
to conquer.
We early learned the significance of
the old adage "In union there is
strength." It was on the first Satur
day after registration that we fell be
fore the Sophomores in the annual
underclass tie-up contest. We were
the first to enter the University after j
the "water cure" and the real old-time
tubbing had been prohibited by the
Trustees. Naturally we were more or
less self-opinionated because we had
nothing to fear at the moment, but
our defeat in the rush strongly em
phasized the subserviency of our po
sition.
The fall of 1911 was the first time
t Uo t the Stanford yearlings had to
forego the annual Freshman football
contest with the California cubs. A
decree by the Faculty, issued in May
1911, forever abolished the contest be
tween the babe teams. This, however,
did not interfere with the playing of
a Freshman schedule of eleven games
in which the Stanford 1915 team
scored 107 points to its opponents 27,
and were defeated only twice. It was
the period when several players of
varsity caliber were unearthed. The
twenty Freshmen awarded their block
numerals for competing on the class
team included Milt Haley (captain),
Wines, Hirasawa, Frost, Soper, But
ton. Rloeser, Wilson, Jacomini, Clark,
Steinhart, Erb, Risling, Sim, Ross,
Templeton, Cookson, Wunne, Hutch
inson and Thoburn. Two of these
players. Milt Haley and Bert Risling,
were later to take their places in the
ranks of the 1911 varsity team which
met defeat at the hands of the Blue
and Gold by a score of 21-3.
An innovation in class activities
was introduced by the Exposition
class on January 19, 1912. It had al
ways been the custom for the Univer
sity President to welcome the new
students to the campus in September
of each year. When 1915 entered as

Freshmen, Dr. Jordan was on a
world's peace mission in the Far East
and was thus unable to extend the
customary cordial greeting. In its
place the 1915 class planned a birth
day dinner for our honored Chancel
lor on the occasion of his sixty-first
birthday upon his return from the
Orient. We had exchanged places
w itii Dr. Jordan, being host to him on
his anniversary.
It was in our Freshman year that
Student Control was launched by the
student body. We had heard from the
time that we first set foot on the
Quad that this was"the Golden Age
of Stanford," and .rightly it may be
termed such when we stop to consider
the full significance of self-govern
ment. This is one of the most im
portant events in our four years of
activity. On the present Senior Class
more than on any other class has de
volved the responsibilities of making
Student Control a success. It was
left to us to make or break the oppor
tunities which were ours, and which
we hand down to other classes to
cherish and to strengthen.
Keeping true to tradition 1915
turned out a victorious Freshman
crew, captained by Olmstead, with
Reineman for coxswain. Other mem
bers of the crew who pulled an oar
on the 1915 eight were Hulsman,
Rahm, Haggart, Wolford, Jacomini,
Jeffers and Sinclair. It was in the
spring of the same year that Bonnett
ran his first intercollegiate race, win
ning the half mile in two minutes flat.
The same year Johnny Couch and
Avery Howe were the mainstays of
the baseball team on the pitcher's
mound. In its Freshman year 1915
did not confine its activities to ath
letics by any means. It was repre
sented on the intercollegiate debating
team by Higgins, and on the Tri-State
team by Worthy. In the interclass
debate, the team consisting of Kil
eline, Covle and Higg'ns worsted the
Sophomores in the annual forensic
melee.
We have dwelt at length on the
Freshman year for it is the one year
which stands out in every class as
the one which has meant most to the
individual members of the class. Let
us now hasten on to more recent hap
penings.
Truly this may be called "The
Clolden Age of Stanford" when we stop
to reflect on the events of the past
four years. The first step in which
we played our part was when student
affairs were placed in the hands of
the students. And with this came a
closer bond between the Faculty and
undergraduates, which has grown
stronger year by year. With it has
come a closer cooperation with the
Board of Trustees and the alumni, un
til today the four sides of the Quad
rangle are linked together as co
workers. striving for the best inter
ests of the University, casting aside
personal prejudices. We have wit
nessed the strengthening of scholas
tic standards at the University, and
275 of us are here today, having met
requirements, to present our
selves for graduation. It has been
"'•r rood fortune to be honored by
*«vo presidents during our brief resi

deuce on trie farm. In Dr. Jordan we
have a warm friend and counsellor;
in Dr. Branner, one whose entire time j
is devoted to serving the best inter
ests of the University, and one who is
ever ready to listen to our appeals
and troubles.
Members of the class have spread
the name and fame of Stanford to all
points of the compass on various trips
of athletic teams. Wherever they
went, whether in the rugby trip to
Vancouver, the baseball tour of Japan,
the crew journey to the Poughkeep
sie regatta, or the track trip to the
conference meets in the Middle West,
they carried the true Stanford spirit
of sportsmanship, and whether they
won or lost were always looked upon
with equal favor. It is the men of
Stanford that count, and not merely
their achievements on the turf, dia
mond, water or cinder path. And 1915
has contributed no small share in
I turning out its quota of real Stanford
men.
Against our friend the enemy we
have witnessed especially productive
years when we measure victories
against defeats; one defeat, one tie
and two victories in rugby; one de

times winner on the water against the
Blue and Cold eights; split event in
four intercollegiate battles on the
forensic platform, and lost three out
of four intercollegiate baseball series.
In our Sophomore year, sad to say,
but nevertheless true, we were defeat

Two of the most recent happenings
i in which the class has played an ac
j tive part are th? opening of the Stan
; ford Union and the Woman's Club
House, and the crisis in intercollegiate
relations with California. The inter-
I est that the class of 191") takes in the
! Union is probably stronger than any
I other class for the reason that its
members look at its significance from
two angles, namely, as undergraduates
and alumni. As Seniors we realize
its importance as a potent force in
promoting democracy between stu
dents and faculty; and as alumni,
which we hope to be within a few
days, we can see its significance as a
commingling ground for students,
alumni. Faculty and Trustees. More
over, "We need the Union" has been
ringing in our ears since the first se
mester, and now it is an integral part
of graduate and undergraduate life.
Never in the history of athletics has
such a crisis existed in the athletic
relations between California and Stan-

ford as during the past semester. To
the Seniors, more than to any other

cause on them has fallen the difficult

tories. In interclass crew racing the
1915 four has proven superior to all
others on two occasions, the last vic
tory standing out far above all others
when the shell was steered to victory
by Miss Elsie Olcese.
The Exposition Class has been well
to the fore when one stops to consider

that each class has contributed to
varsity teams. It is true that the
class has not stood far above others
but it has certainly held its own. In
rugby we have contributed Haley, Ris

a galaxy of football stars to the var
sity teams.
Our track athletes are few, but
what they lack in numbers is made

among its members two Pacific Coast

has never been defeated in an inter

The success of the varsity crews for

Jeffers, Rehm, Hulsman, Wolford,
Haggart, Olmstead and Reineman
have all occupied seats in the varsity

able to get along without Babe Dent,
the team has selected him to lead

During the past four years minor
sports at Stanford have taken on a
new lease of life, and interest in them
has increased materially. Due to the
efforts of members of the '15 class
basketball was placed on an intercol
legiate basis and elevated to the rank
of a minor sport last year. One year
the entire basketball team was com

Perchance at first glance too much

of 1915 has played its part. In jour

Miss Tisdale and Miss McCoy have

spectively, are responsible for the 1915
Quad.
In debating Coyle has been the
mainstay of all forensic contests for
the past three years, and has been
ably seconded by Higgins, Weston,
Worthy and Kilcline.
Two dramatic productions of un
usual merit have gone down in the

First of these was the Sophomore

Junior Opera, "The College Prince,"
written by M. A. Hagen. Members of
the class who have made a name for
themselves on the Stanford stage are
the Misses Taff, Gard, Sloss, Trent,
Copper, de Vilbiss and Bryan, and the
Messrs. Forbes, Paul, Gibb, Hynemann,
Bennett, Adams, Higgins, Allen, Tho
burn and Dutton. In musical circles,
Bradford and Gibb have led and man
aged the Band for the past year;
Lynch has guided the destinies of the
Glee Club, and Bennett has made a
name for himself as a soloist.
With Bob Worthy at the helm, the
affairs of the Student Body have been
guided through many ups and downs
during the past year and weathered
the storm successfully, thanks to the
skipper at the steering wheel. L. F.
Reineman has acted as vice-president
of the Student Body and P. J. McClos
key as secretary. The class has been
represented on the Executive Com
mittee by Templeton, Bonnett, Jaco
mini, Rehm, Davis and Bedeau. In
the control of student affairs Beaver,
Bedeau, Card, Davis, Dutton, Gibb,
Hagen, Lynch, Paul, Simonson, Wor
thy and Ziser played a part as mem
bers of the University Conference.
Simonson. as Student Adviser, and
Worthy, as a representative of the
Conference were members of the Stu
dent Council.
The fate of the class has been in
the hands of eight class presidents,
namely, Jameson, Spalding, Davis,
Rehm, Wines, Jacomini, Dent and
Erb. Stiller, Miss Taff, Sinclair, Al
len, Cartwright, Stevens and Temple
ton have been vice-presidents, respec
tively. The writing and .reading of
the minutes has been taken care of by
the Misses Wallace, Burg, Van Zwa
lenburg. McCoy, Todd, McC'ord, Bry
an and Gardiner. As financiers of
the class we record the names of Al
len, Oven, Clark, Partridge, Wynne,
Ling, and Warren.
From the standpoint of scholastic
attainment Fifteen has contributed to
Phi Beta Kappa no less than thirty
four members. The list includes
Misses Browning. Conkling, Curry,
Gray, Ix)op, La Fetra, Newman, Hagel,
Overacker, Poindexter, Prout, Anna
Henrietta Rehmke, Ball. Job, Winn,
Harborer, Hobson, Kreps, Maines,
Rouiller, Sanfo.rd, Tag, Van Etten,
Wildman, Young and Girdner; and
the Messrs. Adams, Moore, Cook,
Clark, Coyle, McCabe and Piatt.
In women's activities Fifteen has
'>cen equally prominent during the
nast four years. Women in the class
have taken an active part in further
ing the success of tennis, fencing,
rowing and basketball, and within the
'nst month won the championship in
the interclass field day. Among
those who have contributed to the var
'ous activities and to conducting the
of the five hundred are the
Misses Gard, McCord, Walls, TafT.
Gardner, Hunt, McCarthy, McCoy,
Gray. Wells. Duryea, Drury, Tisdale.
Parkinson. Bassett, Wood. Knox, Cur
tis and La Fetra.
Thus we have reviewed the part
which this graduating class has

played in the last four years of Stan
ford history. What part it shall con
tinue to play in the capacity of alum
ni remains to be chronicled.
Following is the history ready by
F. C. Hamilton at the exercises Friday:
The "Exposition Class" of this Uni
versity is about to step from the doors
of its alma mater. Before we leave
the dear old Quad let us reilect for a

few minutes over
the events of the
past four years.
Let us call to
mind the vic
tories and de
feats; refresh
our memories
over past hap
penings which
it has been our
pleasure to ex

perience; and chronicle the history of
the University as reflected th.rongh
the class of 1915.
It seems but yesterday that we cut
loose from our hom- surroundings,
took on a new lease of life, and with
initiative and independence set out on
a four year climb to the top of the
hill to secure the much coveted de
gree. During that time we were
to fall into many chasms, individ
ually and collectively, .receive many
scratches and bruises, but eventually
reach the summit where we stand to
day, looking forward for more worlds
to conquer.
We early learned the significance of
the old adage "In union there is
strength." It was on the first Satur
day after registration that we fell be
fore the Sophomores in the annual
underclass tie-up contest. We were
the first to enter the University after j
the "water cure" and the real old-time
tubbing had been prohibited by the
Trustees. Naturally we were more or
less self-opinionated because we had
nothing to fear at the moment, but
our defeat in the rush strongly em
phasized the subserviency of our po
sition.
The fall of 1911 was the first time
t Uo t the Stanford yearlings had to
forego the annual Freshman football
contest with the California cubs. A
decree by the Faculty, issued in May
1911, forever abolished the contest be
tween the babe teams. This, however,
did not interfere with the playing of
a Freshman schedule of eleven games
in which the Stanford 1915 team
scored 107 points to its opponents 27,
and were defeated only twice. It was
the period when several players of
varsity caliber were unearthed. The
twenty Freshmen awarded their block
numerals for competing on the class
team included Milt Haley (captain),
Wines, Hirasawa, Frost, Soper, But
ton. Rloeser, Wilson, Jacomini, Clark,
Steinhart, Erb, Risling, Sim, Ross,
Templeton, Cookson, Wunne, Hutch
inson and Thoburn. Two of these
players. Milt Haley and Bert Risling,
were later to take their places in the
ranks of the 1911 varsity team which
met defeat at the hands of the Blue
and Gold by a score of 21-3.
An innovation in class activities
was introduced by the Exposition
class on January 19, 1912. It had al
ways been the custom for the Univer
sity President to welcome the new
students to the campus in September
of each year. When 1915 entered as

Freshmen, Dr. Jordan was on a
world's peace mission in the Far East
and was thus unable to extend the
customary cordial greeting. In its
place the 1915 class planned a birth
day dinner for our honored Chancel
lor on the occasion of his sixty-first
birthday upon his return from the
Orient. We had exchanged places
w itii Dr. Jordan, being host to him on
his anniversary.
It was in our Freshman year that
Student Control was launched by the
student body. We had heard from the
time that we first set foot on the
Quad that this was"the Golden Age
of Stanford," and .rightly it may be
termed such when we stop to consider
the full significance of self-govern
ment. This is one of the most im
portant events in our four years of
activity. On the present Senior Class
more than on any other class has de
volved the responsibilities of making
Student Control a success. It was
left to us to make or break the oppor
tunities which were ours, and which
we hand down to other classes to
cherish and to strengthen.
Keeping true to tradition 1915
turned out a victorious Freshman
crew, captained by Olmstead, with
Reineman for coxswain. Other mem
bers of the crew who pulled an oar
on the 1915 eight were Hulsman,
Rahm, Haggart, Wolford, Jacomini,
Jeffers and Sinclair. It was in the
spring of the same year that Bonnett
ran his first intercollegiate race, win
ning the half mile in two minutes flat.
The same year Johnny Couch and
Avery Howe were the mainstays of
the baseball team on the pitcher's
mound. In its Freshman year 1915
did not confine its activities to ath
letics by any means. It was repre
sented on the intercollegiate debating
team by Higgins, and on the Tri-State
team by Worthy. In the interclass
debate, the team consisting of Kil
eline, Covle and Higg'ns worsted the
Sophomores in the annual forensic
melee.
We have dwelt at length on the
Freshman year for it is the one year
which stands out in every class as
the one which has meant most to the
individual members of the class. Let
us now hasten on to more recent hap
penings.
Truly this may be called "The
Clolden Age of Stanford" when we stop
to reflect on the events of the past
four years. The first step in which
we played our part was when student
affairs were placed in the hands of
the students. And with this came a
closer bond between the Faculty and
undergraduates, which has grown
stronger year by year. With it has
come a closer cooperation with the
Board of Trustees and the alumni, un
til today the four sides of the Quad
rangle are linked together as co
workers. striving for the best inter
ests of the University, casting aside
personal prejudices. We have wit
nessed the strengthening of scholas
tic standards at the University, and
275 of us are here today, having met
requirements, to present our
selves for graduation. It has been
"'•r rood fortune to be honored by
*«vo presidents during our brief resi

deuce on trie farm. In Dr. Jordan we
have a warm friend and counsellor;
in Dr. Branner, one whose entire time j
is devoted to serving the best inter
ests of the University, and one who is
ever ready to listen to our appeals
and troubles.
Members of the class have spread
the name and fame of Stanford to all
points of the compass on various trips
of athletic teams. Wherever they
went, whether in the rugby trip to
Vancouver, the baseball tour of Japan,
the crew journey to the Poughkeep
sie regatta, or the track trip to the
conference meets in the Middle West,
they carried the true Stanford spirit
of sportsmanship, and whether they
won or lost were always looked upon
with equal favor. It is the men of
Stanford that count, and not merely
their achievements on the turf, dia
mond, water or cinder path. And 1915
has contributed no small share in
I turning out its quota of real Stanford
men.
Against our friend the enemy we
have witnessed especially productive
years when we measure victories
against defeats; one defeat, one tie
and two victories in rugby; one de
feat and three victories in track; four
times winner on the water against the
Blue and Cold eights; split event in
four intercollegiate battles on the
forensic platform, and lost three out
of four intercollegiate baseball series.
In our Sophomore year, sad to say,
but nevertheless true, we were defeat
ed in the annual underclass tie-up due
to the superior number of inferior
forces. Soon after the ' semester
opened Stanford attained her major
ity in age on October 1, 1912. Just
one year later Dr. Branner was in
stalled as President of the University,
a memorable event in the eyes of each
one of us. And then in our Junior
year came the Plug-Ugly with its at
tendant consequences. The powers
that be. namely the University Con
ference. abolished the Plug-Ugly as it
was then presented and left it to the
classes of '15 and '10 to find a satis
factory substitute for the upperclass
battle. The Plug-Ugly was revised, as
we all know, by omitting the objec
tionable features and reinstating the
remains. What ; ts future will be only
time can tell. The rush itself proved
a dismal failure last semester. The
Seniors took absolutely no interest in
withholding the onslaught of the
j Juniors, and the sixteen class lacked
j even the incentive to secure their own
plug hats.
The laying of the posters when we
were Juniors gave us a world of ex
perience when it came to foiling the
vain endeavors cf the 191G class last
semester. The cup of experience is
often a bitter dose to swallow when
it carries defeat with it. but that was
price that 1915 had to pay when
she attempted to lay the Junior
posters in the fall of 1913. Last se
mester it was a different story we told
tb? campus the next morning as the
c un rose over the horizon. It was the
morning after the sixteeners had made
a fut le attempt to lav their posters.
The story was of the Juniors in stocks,
and how they had been completely
baffled in their attempt to smear the

campus with the customary third-
I year posters.
Two of the most recent happenings
i in which the class has played an ac
j tive part are th? opening of the Stan
; ford Union and the Woman's Club
House, and the crisis in intercollegiate
relations with California. The inter-
I est that the class of 191") takes in the
! Union is probably stronger than any
I other class for the reason that its
members look at its significance from
two angles, namely, as undergraduates
and alumni. As Seniors we realize
its importance as a potent force in
promoting democracy between stu
dents and faculty; and as alumni,
which we hope to be within a few
days, we can see its significance as a
commingling ground for students,
alumni. Faculty and Trustees. More
over, "We need the Union" has been
ringing in our ears since the first se
mester, and now it is an integral part
of graduate and undergraduate life.
Never in the history of athletics has
such a crisis existed in the athletic
relations between California and Stan-

ford as during the past semester. To
the Seniors, more than to any other
class, the present situation is due, be
cause on them has fallen the difficult
task of trying to adjust matters and
yet remain firm in what the Univer
s ty stood for in sportsmanship. These
are epochs of no slight importance in
comparison with the usual events of
each college generation.
Of peerades, initiations, proms, co
tillions, operas, rallies, Irish mara
thons and bonfires we have had our
full. And by the way, the 1915
Freshman bonfire reached the high
water mark in the accomplishments of
a similar nature. In interclass activ
ities, 1915 has shared the honors with
the other classes and taken a fair
sized number of victories. In base
ball the class has twice been declared
champion; in rugby, records indicate
1915 a one-time winner; three basket
ball championships have been accred
ited to the class, and two soccer vic
tories. In interclass crew racing the
1915 four has proven superior to all
others on two occasions, the last vic
tory standing out far above all others
when the shell was steered to victory
by Miss Elsie Olcese.
The Exposition Class has been well
to the fore when one stops to consider
or compare the number of athletes
that each class has contributed to
varsity teams. It is true that the
class has not stood far above others
but it has certainly held its own. In
rugby we have contributed Haley, Ris
ling, Erb, Soper, Wines and Rehm as
a galaxy of football stars to the var
sity teams.
Our track athletes are few, but
what they lack in numbers is made
up in quality. The class includes
among its members two Pacific Coast
record holders. Captain Bonnett, who
has never been defeated in an inter
collegiate race, heads the list. He is
the only four-star athlete now in the
University, having secured the dis
tinction by winning the half-mile four
times in succession against California.
He holds the Coast record of 1:54:4
in his popular distance, while Don
Dawson has recorded alongside of his
name the mark of 23 feet 7 inches in
the broad jump, making a Coast rec
ord which will probably stand for
some years to come. Bedeau has
shown his superiority in the shot put
three years in succession. In Ric
Templeton the class has been repre
sented by one of the most versatile
athletes that ever donned a spike, and
because of his superior ability he has
been chosen to captain the track team
next year.
The success of the varsity crews for
the past three years is largely due to
the material furnished from the class
of 1915. Led by Captain Jacomini.
Jeffers, Rehm, Hulsman, Wolford,
Haggart, Olmstead and Reineman
have all occupied seats in the varsity
shell. This group of oarsmen has
been the hope and marrow of the vic
torious eights, and has been largely
instrumental in making possible the
trip to the Poughkeepsie regatta this
year.
In baseball Howe, Couch. Dent, Mc-
Closkey and Downing have proved
themselves reliable at all times. Three
times have Dent and McCloskey been
nicked to face the Blue and Gold. Un
able to get along without Babe Dent,
the team has selected him to lead
their destinies next year as captain
of th? nine.
During the past four years minor
sports at Stanford have taken on a
new lease of life, and interest in them
has increased materially. Due to the
efforts of members of the '15 class
basketball was placed on an intercol
legiate basis and elevated to the rank
of a minor sport last year. One year
the entire basketball team was com
posed of players from this class,
namely Davis, Dutton, Blodgett, Ling.
Worthy, Reynolds and Farrar. Wor
thv and Reynolds have guided the
quintet through two seasons and Blod
e:et has been drafted to act as captain
"•ext year. In tennis, Hutchinson.
Sheldon and Sloss form a trio of rac
quet wielders of no ordinary ability.
The latter two captained the varsity
team ir two successive years. To soc
cer. 1915 has contributed Captain

Blodget, Hughes, Dutton, Stenhardt,
Adams and Boyle, the latter having
been selected to captain next year's
soccer team.
Perchance at first glance too much
emphasis lias been placed on athlet
ics, but let us look into other activi
ties and see whether or not the class
of 1915 has played its part. In jour
nalism. the editorship of The Daily
l'alo Alto has been entrusted to Si
monson and Hamilton; and the edi
torial work on the Sequoia to Bennett.
Miss Tisdale and Miss McCoy have
served as woman's editors on the
"Daily." Kilcline, Wynne and Hawk
ins have also been engaged in jour
nalistic work. Hagen lias wielded the
hammer in the publication of Chapar
ral during the past year with Oliver
and Olsen as art editors. Worthy and
Hawkins, as editor and manager re
spectively, are responsible for the 1915
Quad.
In debating Coyle has been the
mainstay of all forensic contests for
the past three years, and has been
ably seconded by Higgins, Weston,
Worthy and Kilcline.
Two dramatic productions of un
usual merit have gone down in the
annals as a credit to the 1915 class.
First of these was the Sophomore
play, "On the Quiet," and second, the
Junior Opera, "The College Prince,"
written by M. A. Hagen. Members of
the class who have made a name for
themselves on the Stanford stage are
the Misses Taff, Gard, Sloss, Trent,
Copper, de Vilbiss and Bryan, and the
Messrs. Forbes, Paul, Gibb, Hynemann,
Bennett, Adams, Higgins, Allen, Tho
burn and Dutton. In musical circles,
Bradford and Gibb have led and man
aged the Band for the past year;
Lynch has guided the destinies of the
Glee Club, and Bennett has made a
name for himself as a soloist.
With Bob Worthy at the helm, the
affairs of the Student Body have been
guided through many ups and downs
during the past year and weathered
the storm successfully, thanks to the
skipper at the steering wheel. L. F.
Reineman has acted as vice-president
of the Student Body and P. J. McClos
key as secretary. The class has been
represented on the Executive Com
mittee by Templeton, Bonnett, Jaco
mini, Rehm, Davis and Bedeau. In
the control of student affairs Beaver,
Bedeau, Card, Davis, Dutton, Gibb,
Hagen, Lynch, Paul, Simonson, Wor
thy and Ziser played a part as mem
bers of the University Conference.
Simonson. as Student Adviser, and
Worthy, as a representative of the
Conference were members of the Stu
dent Council.
The fate of the class has been in
the hands of eight class presidents,
namely, Jameson, Spalding, Davis,
Rehm, Wines, Jacomini, Dent and
Erb. Stiller, Miss Taff, Sinclair, Al
len, Cartwright, Stevens and Temple
ton have been vice-presidents, respec
tively. The writing and .reading of
the minutes has been taken care of by
the Misses Wallace, Burg, Van Zwa
lenburg. McCoy, Todd, McC'ord, Bry
an and Gardiner. As financiers of
the class we record the names of Al
len, Oven, Clark, Partridge, Wynne,
Ling, and Warren.
From the standpoint of scholastic
attainment Fifteen has contributed to
Phi Beta Kappa no less than thirty
four members. The list includes
Misses Browning. Conkling, Curry,
Gray, Ix)op, La Fetra, Newman, Hagel,
Overacker, Poindexter, Prout, Anna
Henrietta Rehmke, Ball. Job, Winn,
Harborer, Hobson, Kreps, Maines,
Rouiller, Sanfo.rd, Tag, Van Etten,
Wildman, Young and Girdner; and
the Messrs. Adams, Moore, Cook,
Clark, Coyle, McCabe and Piatt.
In women's activities Fifteen has
'>cen equally prominent during the
nast four years. Women in the class
have taken an active part in further
ing the success of tennis, fencing,
rowing and basketball, and within the
'nst month won the championship in
the interclass field day. Among
those who have contributed to the var
'ous activities and to conducting the
of the five hundred are the
Misses Gard, McCord, Walls, TafT.
Gardner, Hunt, McCarthy, McCoy,
Gray. Wells. Duryea, Drury, Tisdale.
Parkinson. Bassett, Wood. Knox, Cur
tis and La Fetra.
Thus we have reviewed the part
which this graduating class has

played in the last four years of Stan
ford history. What part it shall con
tinue to play in the capacity of alum
ni remains to be chronicled.
Following is the history ready by

players. Milt Haley and Bert Risling,
were later to take their places in the

met defeat at the hands of the Blue
and Gold by a score of 21-3.
An innovation in class activities

j even the incentive to secure their own
plug hats.
The laying of the posters when we
were Juniors gave us a world of ex
perience when it came to foiling the
vain endeavors cf the 191G class last
semester. The cup of experience is
often a bitter dose to swallow when
it carries defeat with it. but that was
price that 1915 had to pay when
she attempted to lay the Junior
posters in the fall of 1913. Last se
mester it was a different story we told
tb? campus the next morning as the
c un rose over the horizon. It was the
morning after the sixteeners had made
a fut le attempt to lav their posters.
The story was of the Juniors in stocks,
and how they had been completely
baffled in their attempt to smear the

campus with the customary third-
I year posters.
Two of the most recent happenings
i in which the class has played an ac
j tive part are th? opening of the Stan
; ford Union and the Woman's Club
House, and the crisis in intercollegiate
relations with California. The inter-
I est that the class of 191") takes in the
! Union is probably stronger than any
I other class for the reason that its
members look at its significance from
two angles, namely, as undergraduates
and alumni. As Seniors we realize
its importance as a potent force in
promoting democracy between stu
dents and faculty; and as alumni,
which we hope to be within a few
days, we can see its significance as a
commingling ground for students,
alumni. Faculty and Trustees. More
over, "We need the Union" has been
ringing in our ears since the first se
mester, and now it is an integral part
of graduate and undergraduate life.
Never in the history of athletics has
such a crisis existed in the athletic
relations between California and Stan-

ford as during the past semester. To
the Seniors, more than to any other
class, the present situation is due, be
cause on them has fallen the difficult
task of trying to adjust matters and
yet remain firm in what the Univer
s ty stood for in sportsmanship. These
are epochs of no slight importance in
comparison with the usual events of
each college generation.
Of peerades, initiations, proms, co
tillions, operas, rallies, Irish mara
thons and bonfires we have had our
full. And by the way, the 1915
Freshman bonfire reached the high
water mark in the accomplishments of
a similar nature. In interclass activ
ities, 1915 has shared the honors with
the other classes and taken a fair
sized number of victories. In base
ball the class has twice been declared
champion; in rugby, records indicate
1915 a one-time winner; three basket
ball championships have been accred
ited to the class, and two soccer vic
tories. In interclass crew racing the
1915 four has proven superior to all
others on two occasions, the last vic
tory standing out far above all others
when the shell was steered to victory
by Miss Elsie Olcese.
The Exposition Class has been well
to the fore when one stops to consider
or compare the number of athletes
that each class has contributed to
varsity teams. It is true that the
class has not stood far above others
but it has certainly held its own. In
rugby we have contributed Haley, Ris
ling, Erb, Soper, Wines and Rehm as
a galaxy of football stars to the var
sity teams.
Our track athletes are few, but
what they lack in numbers is made
up in quality. The class includes
among its members two Pacific Coast
record holders. Captain Bonnett, who
has never been defeated in an inter
collegiate race, heads the list. He is
the only four-star athlete now in the
University, having secured the dis
tinction by winning the half-mile four
times in succession against California.
He holds the Coast record of 1:54:4
in his popular distance, while Don
Dawson has recorded alongside of his
name the mark of 23 feet 7 inches in
the broad jump, making a Coast rec
ord which will probably stand for
some years to come. Bedeau has
shown his superiority in the shot put
three years in succession. In Ric
Templeton the class has been repre
sented by one of the most versatile
athletes that ever donned a spike, and
because of his superior ability he has
been chosen to captain the track team
next year.
The success of the varsity crews for
the past three years is largely due to
the material furnished from the class
of 1915. Led by Captain Jacomini.
Jeffers, Rehm, Hulsman, Wolford,
Haggart, Olmstead and Reineman
have all occupied seats in the varsity
shell. This group of oarsmen has
been the hope and marrow of the vic
torious eights, and has been largely
instrumental in making possible the
trip to the Poughkeepsie regatta this
year.
In baseball Howe, Couch. Dent, Mc-
Closkey and Downing have proved
themselves reliable at all times. Three
times have Dent and McCloskey been
nicked to face the Blue and Gold. Un
able to get along without Babe Dent,
the team has selected him to lead
their destinies next year as captain
of th? nine.
During the past four years minor
sports at Stanford have taken on a
new lease of life, and interest in them
has increased materially. Due to the
efforts of members of the '15 class
basketball was placed on an intercol
legiate basis and elevated to the rank
of a minor sport last year. One year
the entire basketball team was com
posed of players from this class,
namely Davis, Dutton, Blodgett, Ling.
Worthy, Reynolds and Farrar. Wor
thv and Reynolds have guided the
quintet through two seasons and Blod
e:et has been drafted to act as captain
"•ext year. In tennis, Hutchinson.
Sheldon and Sloss form a trio of rac
quet wielders of no ordinary ability.
The latter two captained the varsity
team ir two successive years. To soc
cer. 1915 has contributed Captain

Blodget, Hughes, Dutton, Stenhardt,
Adams and Boyle, the latter having
been selected to captain next year's
soccer team.
Perchance at first glance too much
emphasis lias been placed on athlet
ics, but let us look into other activi
ties and see whether or not the class
of 1915 has played its part. In jour
nalism. the editorship of The Daily
l'alo Alto has been entrusted to Si
monson and Hamilton; and the edi
torial work on the Sequoia to Bennett.
Miss Tisdale and Miss McCoy have
served as woman's editors on the
"Daily." Kilcline, Wynne and Hawk
ins have also been engaged in jour
nalistic work. Hagen lias wielded the
hammer in the publication of Chapar
ral during the past year with Oliver
and Olsen as art editors. Worthy and
Hawkins, as editor and manager re
spectively, are responsible for the 1915
Quad.
In debating Coyle has been the
mainstay of all forensic contests for
the past three years, and has been
ably seconded by Higgins, Weston,
Worthy and Kilcline.
Two dramatic productions of un
usual merit have gone down in the
annals as a credit to the 1915 class.
First of these was the Sophomore
play, "On the Quiet," and second, the
Junior Opera, "The College Prince,"
written by M. A. Hagen. Members of
the class who have made a name for
themselves on the Stanford stage are
the Misses Taff, Gard, Sloss, Trent,
Copper, de Vilbiss and Bryan, and the
Messrs. Forbes, Paul, Gibb, Hynemann,
Bennett, Adams, Higgins, Allen, Tho
burn and Dutton. In musical circles,
Bradford and Gibb have led and man
aged the Band for the past year;
Lynch has guided the destinies of the
Glee Club, and Bennett has made a
name for himself as a soloist.
With Bob Worthy at the helm, the
affairs of the Student Body have been
guided through many ups and downs
during the past year and weathered
the storm successfully, thanks to the
skipper at the steering wheel. L. F.
Reineman has acted as vice-president
of the Student Body and P. J. McClos
key as secretary. The class has been
represented on the Executive Com
mittee by Templeton, Bonnett, Jaco
mini, Rehm, Davis and Bedeau. In
the control of student affairs Beaver,
Bedeau, Card, Davis, Dutton, Gibb,
Hagen, Lynch, Paul, Simonson, Wor
thy and Ziser played a part as mem
bers of the University Conference.
Simonson. as Student Adviser, and
Worthy, as a representative of the
Conference were members of the Stu
dent Council.
The fate of the class has been in
the hands of eight class presidents,
namely, Jameson, Spalding, Davis,
Rehm, Wines, Jacomini, Dent and
Erb. Stiller, Miss Taff, Sinclair, Al
len, Cartwright, Stevens and Temple
ton have been vice-presidents, respec
tively. The writing and .reading of
the minutes has been taken care of by
the Misses Wallace, Burg, Van Zwa
lenburg. McCoy, Todd, McC'ord, Bry
an and Gardiner. As financiers of
the class we record the names of Al
len, Oven, Clark, Partridge, Wynne,
Ling, and Warren.
From the standpoint of scholastic
attainment Fifteen has contributed to
Phi Beta Kappa no less than thirty
four members. The list includes
Misses Browning. Conkling, Curry,
Gray, Ix)op, La Fetra, Newman, Hagel,
Overacker, Poindexter, Prout, Anna
Henrietta Rehmke, Ball. Job, Winn,
Harborer, Hobson, Kreps, Maines,
Rouiller, Sanfo.rd, Tag, Van Etten,
Wildman, Young and Girdner; and
the Messrs. Adams, Moore, Cook,
Clark, Coyle, McCabe and Piatt.
In women's activities Fifteen has
'>cen equally prominent during the
nast four years. Women in the class
have taken an active part in further
ing the success of tennis, fencing,
rowing and basketball, and within the
'nst month won the championship in
the interclass field day. Among
those who have contributed to the var
'ous activities and to conducting the
of the five hundred are the
Misses Gard, McCord, Walls, TafT.
Gardner, Hunt, McCarthy, McCoy,
Gray. Wells. Duryea, Drury, Tisdale.
Parkinson. Bassett, Wood. Knox, Cur
tis and La Fetra.
Thus we have reviewed the part
which this graduating class has

played in the last four years of Stan
ford history. What part it shall con
tinue to play in the capacity of alum
ni remains to be chronicled.
Following is the history ready by
F. C. Hamilton at the exercises Friday:
The "Exposition Class" of this Uni
versity is about to step from the doors
of its alma mater. Before we leave
the dear old Quad let us reilect for a

few minutes over
the events of the
past four years.
Let us call to
mind the vic
tories and de
feats; refresh
our memories
over past hap
penings which
it has been our
pleasure to ex

perience; and chronicle the history of
the University as reflected th.rongh
the class of 1915.
It seems but yesterday that we cut
loose from our hom- surroundings,
took on a new lease of life, and with
initiative and independence set out on
a four year climb to the top of the
hill to secure the much coveted de
gree. During that time we were
to fall into many chasms, individ
ually and collectively, .receive many
scratches and bruises, but eventually
reach the summit where we stand to
day, looking forward for more worlds
to conquer.
We early learned the significance of
the old adage "In union there is
strength." It was on the first Satur
day after registration that we fell be
fore the Sophomores in the annual
underclass tie-up contest. We were
the first to enter the University after j
the "water cure" and the real old-time
tubbing had been prohibited by the
Trustees. Naturally we were more or
less self-opinionated because we had
nothing to fear at the moment, but
our defeat in the rush strongly em
phasized the subserviency of our po
sition.
The fall of 1911 was the first time
t Uo t the Stanford yearlings had to
forego the annual Freshman football
contest with the California cubs. A
decree by the Faculty, issued in May
1911, forever abolished the contest be
tween the babe teams. This, however,
did not interfere with the playing of
a Freshman schedule of eleven games
in which the Stanford 1915 team
scored 107 points to its opponents 27,
and were defeated only twice. It was
the period when several players of
varsity caliber were unearthed. The
twenty Freshmen awarded their block
numerals for competing on the class
team included Milt Haley (captain),
Wines, Hirasawa, Frost, Soper, But
ton. Rloeser, Wilson, Jacomini, Clark,
Steinhart, Erb, Risling, Sim, Ross,
Templeton, Cookson, Wunne, Hutch
inson and Thoburn. Two of these
players. Milt Haley and Bert Risling,
were later to take their places in the
ranks of the 1911 varsity team which
met defeat at the hands of the Blue
and Gold by a score of 21-3.
An innovation in class activities
was introduced by the Exposition
class on January 19, 1912. It had al
ways been the custom for the Univer
sity President to welcome the new
students to the campus in September
of each year. When 1915 entered as

Freshmen, Dr. Jordan was on a
world's peace mission in the Far East
and was thus unable to extend the
customary cordial greeting. In its
place the 1915 class planned a birth
day dinner for our honored Chancel
lor on the occasion of his sixty-first
birthday upon his return from the
Orient. We had exchanged places
w itii Dr. Jordan, being host to him on
his anniversary.
It was in our Freshman year that
Student Control was launched by the
student body. We had heard from the
time that we first set foot on the
Quad that this was"the Golden Age
of Stanford," and .rightly it may be
termed such when we stop to consider
the full significance of self-govern
ment. This is one of the most im
portant events in our four years of
activity. On the present Senior Class
more than on any other class has de
volved the responsibilities of making
Student Control a success. It was
left to us to make or break the oppor
tunities which were ours, and which
we hand down to other classes to
cherish and to strengthen.
Keeping true to tradition 1915
turned out a victorious Freshman
crew, captained by Olmstead, with
Reineman for coxswain. Other mem
bers of the crew who pulled an oar
on the 1915 eight were Hulsman,
Rahm, Haggart, Wolford, Jacomini,
Jeffers and Sinclair. It was in the
spring of the same year that Bonnett
ran his first intercollegiate race, win
ning the half mile in two minutes flat.
The same year Johnny Couch and
Avery Howe were the mainstays of
the baseball team on the pitcher's
mound. In its Freshman year 1915
did not confine its activities to ath
letics by any means. It was repre
sented on the intercollegiate debating
team by Higgins, and on the Tri-State
team by Worthy. In the interclass
debate, the team consisting of Kil
eline, Covle and Higg'ns worsted the
Sophomores in the annual forensic
melee.
We have dwelt at length on the
Freshman year for it is the one year
which stands out in every class as
the one which has meant most to the
individual members of the class. Let
us now hasten on to more recent hap
penings.
Truly this may be called "The
Clolden Age of Stanford" when we stop
to reflect on the events of the past
four years. The first step in which
we played our part was when student
affairs were placed in the hands of
the students. And with this came a
closer bond between the Faculty and
undergraduates, which has grown
stronger year by year. With it has
come a closer cooperation with the
Board of Trustees and the alumni, un
til today the four sides of the Quad
rangle are linked together as co
workers. striving for the best inter
ests of the University, casting aside
personal prejudices. We have wit
nessed the strengthening of scholas
tic standards at the University, and
275 of us are here today, having met
requirements, to present our
selves for graduation. It has been
"'•r rood fortune to be honored by
*«vo presidents during our brief resi

deuce on trie farm. In Dr. Jordan we
have a warm friend and counsellor;
in Dr. Branner, one whose entire time j
is devoted to serving the best inter
ests of the University, and one who is
ever ready to listen to our appeals
and troubles.
Members of the class have spread
the name and fame of Stanford to all
points of the compass on various trips
of athletic teams. Wherever they
went, whether in the rugby trip to
Vancouver, the baseball tour of Japan,
the crew journey to the Poughkeep
sie regatta, or the track trip to the
conference meets in the Middle West,
they carried the true Stanford spirit
of sportsmanship, and whether they
won or lost were always looked upon
with equal favor. It is the men of
Stanford that count, and not merely
their achievements on the turf, dia
mond, water or cinder path. And 1915
has contributed no small share in
I turning out its quota of real Stanford
men.
Against our friend the enemy we
have witnessed especially productive
years when we measure victories
against defeats; one defeat, one tie
and two victories in rugby; one de
feat and three victories in track; four
times winner on the water against the
Blue and Cold eights; split event in
four intercollegiate battles on the
forensic platform, and lost three out
of four intercollegiate baseball series.
In our Sophomore year, sad to say,
but nevertheless true, we were defeat
ed in the annual underclass tie-up due
to the superior number of inferior
forces. Soon after the ' semester
opened Stanford attained her major
ity in age on October 1, 1912. Just
one year later Dr. Branner was in
stalled as President of the University,
a memorable event in the eyes of each
one of us. And then in our Junior
year came the Plug-Ugly with its at
tendant consequences. The powers
that be. namely the University Con
ference. abolished the Plug-Ugly as it
was then presented and left it to the
classes of '15 and '10 to find a satis
factory substitute for the upperclass
battle. The Plug-Ugly was revised, as
we all know, by omitting the objec
tionable features and reinstating the
remains. What ; ts future will be only
time can tell. The rush itself proved
a dismal failure last semester. The
Seniors took absolutely no interest in
withholding the onslaught of the
j Juniors, and the sixteen class lacked
j even the incentive to secure their own
plug hats.
The laying of the posters when we
were Juniors gave us a world of ex
perience when it came to foiling the
vain endeavors cf the 191G class last
semester. The cup of experience is
often a bitter dose to swallow when
it carries defeat with it. but that was
price that 1915 had to pay when
she attempted to lay the Junior
posters in the fall of 1913. Last se
mester it was a different story we told
tb? campus the next morning as the
c un rose over the horizon. It was the
morning after the sixteeners had made
a fut le attempt to lav their posters.
The story was of the Juniors in stocks,
and how they had been completely
baffled in their attempt to smear the

campus with the customary third-
I year posters.
Two of the most recent happenings
i in which the class has played an ac
j tive part are th? opening of the Stan
; ford Union and the Woman's Club
House, and the crisis in intercollegiate
relations with California. The inter-
I est that the class of 191") takes in the
! Union is probably stronger than any
I other class for the reason that its
members look at its significance from
two angles, namely, as undergraduates
and alumni. As Seniors we realize
its importance as a potent force in
promoting democracy between stu
dents and faculty; and as alumni,
which we hope to be within a few
days, we can see its significance as a
commingling ground for students,
alumni. Faculty and Trustees. More
over, "We need the Union" has been
ringing in our ears since the first se
mester, and now it is an integral part
of graduate and undergraduate life.
Never in the history of athletics has
such a crisis existed in the athletic
relations between California and Stan-

ford as during the past semester. To
the Seniors, more than to any other

cause on them has fallen the difficult
task of trying to adjust matters and
yet remain firm in what the Univer
s ty stood for in sportsmanship. These

1915 a one-time winner; three basket

tories. In interclass crew racing the
1915 four has proven superior to all
others on two occasions, the last vic
tory standing out far above all others
when the shell was steered to victory
by Miss Elsie Olcese.
The Exposition Class has been well

class has not stood far above others
but it has certainly held its own. In
rugby we have contributed Haley, Ris

a galaxy of football stars to the var
sity teams.
Our track athletes are few, but
what they lack in numbers is made

among its members two Pacific Coast

has never been defeated in an inter

During the past four years minor
sports at Stanford have taken on a
new lease of life, and interest in them
has increased materially. Due to the
efforts of members of the '15 class
basketball was placed on an intercol
legiate basis and elevated to the rank
of a minor sport last year. One year
the entire basketball team was com

namely Davis, Dutton, Blodgett, Ling.
Worthy, Reynolds and Farrar. Wor
thv and Reynolds have guided the

team ir two successive years. To soc
cer. 1915 has contributed Captain

Blodget, Hughes, Dutton, Stenhardt,
Adams and Boyle, the latter having

soccer team.
Perchance at first glance too much
emphasis lias been placed on athlet
ics, but let us look into other activi
ties and see whether or not the class
of 1915 has played its part. In jour
nalism. the editorship of The Daily

Miss Tisdale and Miss McCoy have
served as woman's editors on the

spectively, are responsible for the 1915
Quad.
In debating Coyle has been the
mainstay of all forensic contests for
the past three years, and has been
ably seconded by Higgins, Weston,

Two dramatic productions of un

the control of student affairs Beaver,
Bedeau, Card, Davis, Dutton, Gibb,
Hagen, Lynch, Paul, Simonson, Wor
thy and Ziser played a part as mem
bers of the University Conference.
Simonson. as Student Adviser, and
Worthy, as a representative of the
Conference were members of the Stu
dent Council.
The fate of the class has been in
the hands of eight class presidents,
namely, Jameson, Spalding, Davis,
Rehm, Wines, Jacomini, Dent and
Erb. Stiller, Miss Taff, Sinclair, Al

Thus we have reviewed the part

Following is the history ready by
F. C. Hamilton at the exercises Friday:
The "Exposition Class" of this Uni

Let us call to

reach the summit where we stand to
day, looking forward for more worlds
to conquer.
We early learned the significance of
the old adage "In union there is
strength." It was on the first Satur
day after registration that we fell be
fore the Sophomores in the annual
underclass tie-up contest. We were
the first to enter the University after j
the "water cure" and the real old-time
tubbing had been prohibited by the
Trustees. Naturally we were more or
less self-opinionated because we had
nothing to fear at the moment, but
our defeat in the rush strongly em
phasized the subserviency of our po
sition.
The fall of 1911 was the first time
t Uo t the Stanford yearlings had to
forego the annual Freshman football
contest with the California cubs. A
decree by the Faculty, issued in May
1911, forever abolished the contest be
tween the babe teams. This, however,
did not interfere with the playing of
a Freshman schedule of eleven games
in which the Stanford 1915 team
scored 107 points to its opponents 27,
and were defeated only twice. It was
the period when several players of
varsity caliber were unearthed. The
twenty Freshmen awarded their block
numerals for competing on the class
team included Milt Haley (captain),
Wines, Hirasawa, Frost, Soper, But
ton. Rloeser, Wilson, Jacomini, Clark,
Steinhart, Erb, Risling, Sim, Ross,
Templeton, Cookson, Wunne, Hutch
inson and Thoburn. Two of these
players. Milt Haley and Bert Risling,
were later to take their places in the
ranks of the 1911 varsity team which
met defeat at the hands of the Blue
and Gold by a score of 21-3.
An innovation in class activities
was introduced by the Exposition
class on January 19, 1912. It had al
ways been the custom for the Univer
sity President to welcome the new
students to the campus in September
of each year. When 1915 entered as

Freshmen, Dr. Jordan was on a
world's peace mission in the Far East
and was thus unable to extend the
customary cordial greeting. In its
place the 1915 class planned a birth
day dinner for our honored Chancel
lor on the occasion of his sixty-first
birthday upon his return from the
Orient. We had exchanged places
w itii Dr. Jordan, being host to him on
his anniversary.
It was in our Freshman year that
Student Control was launched by the
student body. We had heard from the
time that we first set foot on the
Quad that this was"the Golden Age
of Stanford," and .rightly it may be
termed such when we stop to consider
the full significance of self-govern
ment. This is one of the most im
portant events in our four years of
activity. On the present Senior Class
more than on any other class has de
volved the responsibilities of making
Student Control a success. It was
left to us to make or break the oppor
tunities which were ours, and which
we hand down to other classes to
cherish and to strengthen.
Keeping true to tradition 1915
turned out a victorious Freshman
crew, captained by Olmstead, with
Reineman for coxswain. Other mem
bers of the crew who pulled an oar
on the 1915 eight were Hulsman,
Rahm, Haggart, Wolford, Jacomini,
Jeffers and Sinclair. It was in the
spring of the same year that Bonnett
ran his first intercollegiate race, win
ning the half mile in two minutes flat.
The same year Johnny Couch and
Avery Howe were the mainstays of
the baseball team on the pitcher's
mound. In its Freshman year 1915
did not confine its activities to ath
letics by any means. It was repre
sented on the intercollegiate debating
team by Higgins, and on the Tri-State
team by Worthy. In the interclass
debate, the team consisting of Kil
eline, Covle and Higg'ns worsted the
Sophomores in the annual forensic
melee.
We have dwelt at length on the
Freshman year for it is the one year
which stands out in every class as
the one which has meant most to the
individual members of the class. Let
us now hasten on to more recent hap
penings.
Truly this may be called "The
Clolden Age of Stanford" when we stop
to reflect on the events of the past
four years. The first step in which
we played our part was when student
affairs were placed in the hands of
the students. And with this came a
closer bond between the Faculty and
undergraduates, which has grown
stronger year by year. With it has
come a closer cooperation with the
Board of Trustees and the alumni, un
til today the four sides of the Quad
rangle are linked together as co
workers. striving for the best inter
ests of the University, casting aside
personal prejudices. We have wit
nessed the strengthening of scholas
tic standards at the University, and
275 of us are here today, having met
requirements, to present our
selves for graduation. It has been
"'•r rood fortune to be honored by
*«vo presidents during our brief resi

deuce on trie farm. In Dr. Jordan we
have a warm friend and counsellor;
in Dr. Branner, one whose entire time j
is devoted to serving the best inter
ests of the University, and one who is
ever ready to listen to our appeals
and troubles.
Members of the class have spread
the name and fame of Stanford to all
points of the compass on various trips
of athletic teams. Wherever they
went, whether in the rugby trip to
Vancouver, the baseball tour of Japan,
the crew journey to the Poughkeep
sie regatta, or the track trip to the
conference meets in the Middle West,
they carried the true Stanford spirit
of sportsmanship, and whether they
won or lost were always looked upon
with equal favor. It is the men of
Stanford that count, and not merely
their achievements on the turf, dia
mond, water or cinder path. And 1915
has contributed no small share in
I turning out its quota of real Stanford
men.
Against our friend the enemy we
have witnessed especially productive
years when we measure victories
against defeats; one defeat, one tie
and two victories in rugby; one de
feat and three victories in track; four
times winner on the water against the
Blue and Cold eights; split event in
four intercollegiate battles on the
forensic platform, and lost three out
of four intercollegiate baseball series.
In our Sophomore year, sad to say,
but nevertheless true, we were defeat
ed in the annual underclass tie-up due
to the superior number of inferior
forces. Soon after the ' semester
opened Stanford attained her major
ity in age on October 1, 1912. Just
one year later Dr. Branner was in
stalled as President of the University,
a memorable event in the eyes of each
one of us. And then in our Junior
year came the Plug-Ugly with its at
tendant consequences. The powers
that be. namely the University Con
ference. abolished the Plug-Ugly as it
was then presented and left it to the
classes of '15 and '10 to find a satis
factory substitute for the upperclass
battle. The Plug-Ugly was revised, as
we all know, by omitting the objec
tionable features and reinstating the
remains. What ; ts future will be only
time can tell. The rush itself proved
a dismal failure last semester. The
Seniors took absolutely no interest in
withholding the onslaught of the
j Juniors, and the sixteen class lacked
j even the incentive to secure their own
plug hats.
The laying of the posters when we
were Juniors gave us a world of ex
perience when it came to foiling the
vain endeavors cf the 191G class last
semester. The cup of experience is
often a bitter dose to swallow when
it carries defeat with it. but that was
price that 1915 had to pay when
she attempted to lay the Junior
posters in the fall of 1913. Last se
mester it was a different story we told
tb? campus the next morning as the
c un rose over the horizon. It was the
morning after the sixteeners had made
a fut le attempt to lav their posters.
The story was of the Juniors in stocks,
and how they had been completely
baffled in their attempt to smear the

campus with the customary third-
I year posters.
Two of the most recent happenings
i in which the class has played an ac
j tive part are th? opening of the Stan
; ford Union and the Woman's Club
House, and the crisis in intercollegiate
relations with California. The inter-
I est that the class of 191") takes in the
! Union is probably stronger than any
I other class for the reason that its
members look at its significance from
two angles, namely, as undergraduates
and alumni. As Seniors we realize
its importance as a potent force in
promoting democracy between stu
dents and faculty; and as alumni,
which we hope to be within a few
days, we can see its significance as a
commingling ground for students,
alumni. Faculty and Trustees. More
over, "We need the Union" has been
ringing in our ears since the first se
mester, and now it is an integral part
of graduate and undergraduate life.
Never in the history of athletics has
such a crisis existed in the athletic
relations between California and Stan-

ford as during the past semester. To
the Seniors, more than to any other
class, the present situation is due, be
cause on them has fallen the difficult
task of trying to adjust matters and
yet remain firm in what the Univer
s ty stood for in sportsmanship. These
are epochs of no slight importance in
comparison with the usual events of
each college generation.
Of peerades, initiations, proms, co
tillions, operas, rallies, Irish mara
thons and bonfires we have had our
full. And by the way, the 1915
Freshman bonfire reached the high
water mark in the accomplishments of
a similar nature. In interclass activ
ities, 1915 has shared the honors with
the other classes and taken a fair
sized number of victories. In base
ball the class has twice been declared
champion; in rugby, records indicate
1915 a one-time winner; three basket
ball championships have been accred
ited to the class, and two soccer vic
tories. In interclass crew racing the
1915 four has proven superior to all
others on two occasions, the last vic
tory standing out far above all others
when the shell was steered to victory
by Miss Elsie Olcese.
The Exposition Class has been well
to the fore when one stops to consider
or compare the number of athletes
that each class has contributed to
varsity teams. It is true that the
class has not stood far above others
but it has certainly held its own. In
rugby we have contributed Haley, Ris
ling, Erb, Soper, Wines and Rehm as
a galaxy of football stars to the var
sity teams.
Our track athletes are few, but
what they lack in numbers is made
up in quality. The class includes
among its members two Pacific Coast
record holders. Captain Bonnett, who
has never been defeated in an inter
collegiate race, heads the list. He is
the only four-star athlete now in the
University, having secured the dis
tinction by winning the half-mile four
times in succession against California.
He holds the Coast record of 1:54:4
in his popular distance, while Don
Dawson has recorded alongside of his
name the mark of 23 feet 7 inches in
the broad jump, making a Coast rec
ord which will probably stand for
some years to come. Bedeau has
shown his superiority in the shot put
three years in succession. In Ric
Templeton the class has been repre
sented by one of the most versatile
athletes that ever donned a spike, and
because of his superior ability he has
been chosen to captain the track team
next year.
The success of the varsity crews for
the past three years is largely due to
the material furnished from the class
of 1915. Led by Captain Jacomini.
Jeffers, Rehm, Hulsman, Wolford,
Haggart, Olmstead and Reineman
have all occupied seats in the varsity
shell. This group of oarsmen has
been the hope and marrow of the vic
torious eights, and has been largely
instrumental in making possible the
trip to the Poughkeepsie regatta this
year.
In baseball Howe, Couch. Dent, Mc-
Closkey and Downing have proved
themselves reliable at all times. Three
times have Dent and McCloskey been
nicked to face the Blue and Gold. Un
able to get along without Babe Dent,
the team has selected him to lead
their destinies next year as captain
of th? nine.
During the past four years minor
sports at Stanford have taken on a
new lease of life, and interest in them
has increased materially. Due to the
efforts of members of the '15 class
basketball was placed on an intercol
legiate basis and elevated to the rank
of a minor sport last year. One year
the entire basketball team was com
posed of players from this class,
namely Davis, Dutton, Blodgett, Ling.
Worthy, Reynolds and Farrar. Wor
thv and Reynolds have guided the
quintet through two seasons and Blod
e:et has been drafted to act as captain
"•ext year. In tennis, Hutchinson.
Sheldon and Sloss form a trio of rac
quet wielders of no ordinary ability.
The latter two captained the varsity
team ir two successive years. To soc
cer. 1915 has contributed Captain

Blodget, Hughes, Dutton, Stenhardt,
Adams and Boyle, the latter having
been selected to captain next year's
soccer team.
Perchance at first glance too much
emphasis lias been placed on athlet
ics, but let us look into other activi
ties and see whether or not the class
of 1915 has played its part. In jour
nalism. the editorship of The Daily
l'alo Alto has been entrusted to Si
monson and Hamilton; and the edi
torial work on the Sequoia to Bennett.
Miss Tisdale and Miss McCoy have
served as woman's editors on the
"Daily." Kilcline, Wynne and Hawk
ins have also been engaged in jour
nalistic work. Hagen lias wielded the
hammer in the publication of Chapar
ral during the past year with Oliver
and Olsen as art editors. Worthy and
Hawkins, as editor and manager re
spectively, are responsible for the 1915
Quad.
In debating Coyle has been the
mainstay of all forensic contests for
the past three years, and has been
ably seconded by Higgins, Weston,
Worthy and Kilcline.
Two dramatic productions of un
usual merit have gone down in the
annals as a credit to the 1915 class.
First of these was the Sophomore
play, "On the Quiet," and second, the
Junior Opera, "The College Prince,"
written by M. A. Hagen. Members of
the class who have made a name for
themselves on the Stanford stage are
the Misses Taff, Gard, Sloss, Trent,
Copper, de Vilbiss and Bryan, and the
Messrs. Forbes, Paul, Gibb, Hynemann,
Bennett, Adams, Higgins, Allen, Tho
burn and Dutton. In musical circles,
Bradford and Gibb have led and man
aged the Band for the past year;
Lynch has guided the destinies of the
Glee Club, and Bennett has made a
name for himself as a soloist.
With Bob Worthy at the helm, the
affairs of the Student Body have been
guided through many ups and downs
during the past year and weathered
the storm successfully, thanks to the
skipper at the steering wheel. L. F.
Reineman has acted as vice-president
of the Student Body and P. J. McClos
key as secretary. The class has been
represented on the Executive Com
mittee by Templeton, Bonnett, Jaco
mini, Rehm, Davis and Bedeau. In
the control of student affairs Beaver,
Bedeau, Card, Davis, Dutton, Gibb,
Hagen, Lynch, Paul, Simonson, Wor
thy and Ziser played a part as mem
bers of the University Conference.
Simonson. as Student Adviser, and
Worthy, as a representative of the
Conference were members of the Stu
dent Council.
The fate of the class has been in
the hands of eight class presidents,
namely, Jameson, Spalding, Davis,
Rehm, Wines, Jacomini, Dent and
Erb. Stiller, Miss Taff, Sinclair, Al
len, Cartwright, Stevens and Temple
ton have been vice-presidents, respec
tively. The writing and .reading of
the minutes has been taken care of by
the Misses Wallace, Burg, Van Zwa
lenburg. McCoy, Todd, McC'ord, Bry
an and Gardiner. As financiers of
the class we record the names of Al
len, Oven, Clark, Partridge, Wynne,
Ling, and Warren.
From the standpoint of scholastic
attainment Fifteen has contributed to
Phi Beta Kappa no less than thirty
four members. The list includes
Misses Browning. Conkling, Curry,
Gray, Ix)op, La Fetra, Newman, Hagel,
Overacker, Poindexter, Prout, Anna
Henrietta Rehmke, Ball. Job, Winn,
Harborer, Hobson, Kreps, Maines,
Rouiller, Sanfo.rd, Tag, Van Etten,
Wildman, Young and Girdner; and
the Messrs. Adams, Moore, Cook,
Clark, Coyle, McCabe and Piatt.
In women's activities Fifteen has
'>cen equally prominent during the
nast four years. Women in the class
have taken an active part in further
ing the success of tennis, fencing,
rowing and basketball, and within the
'nst month won the championship in
the interclass field day. Among
those who have contributed to the var
'ous activities and to conducting the
of the five hundred are the
Misses Gard, McCord, Walls, TafT.
Gardner, Hunt, McCarthy, McCoy,
Gray. Wells. Duryea, Drury, Tisdale.
Parkinson. Bassett, Wood. Knox, Cur
tis and La Fetra.
Thus we have reviewed the part
which this graduating class has

played in the last four years of Stan
ford history. What part it shall con
tinue to play in the capacity of alum
ni remains to be chronicled.
Following is the history ready by
F. C. Hamilton at the exercises Friday:
The "Exposition Class" of this Uni
versity is about to step from the doors
of its alma mater. Before we leave
the dear old Quad let us reilect for a

few minutes over
the events of the
past four years.
Let us call to
mind the vic
tories and de
feats; refresh
our memories
over past hap
penings which
it has been our
pleasure to ex

perience; and chronicle the history of
the University as reflected th.rongh
the class of 1915.
It seems but yesterday that we cut
loose from our hom- surroundings,
took on a new lease of life, and with
initiative and independence set out on
a four year climb to the top of the
hill to secure the much coveted de
gree. During that time we were
to fall into many chasms, individ
ually and collectively, .receive many
scratches and bruises, but eventually
reach the summit where we stand to
day, looking forward for more worlds
to conquer.
We early learned the significance of
the old adage "In union there is
strength." It was on the first Satur
day after registration that we fell be
fore the Sophomores in the annual
underclass tie-up contest. We were
the first to enter the University after j
the "water cure" and the real old-time
tubbing had been prohibited by the
Trustees. Naturally we were more or
less self-opinionated because we had
nothing to fear at the moment, but
our defeat in the rush strongly em
phasized the subserviency of our po
sition.
The fall of 1911 was the first time
t Uo t the Stanford yearlings had to
forego the annual Freshman football
contest with the California cubs. A
decree by the Faculty, issued in May
1911, forever abolished the contest be
tween the babe teams. This, however,
did not interfere with the playing of
a Freshman schedule of eleven games
in which the Stanford 1915 team
scored 107 points to its opponents 27,
and were defeated only twice. It was
the period when several players of
varsity caliber were unearthed. The
twenty Freshmen awarded their block
numerals for competing on the class
team included Milt Haley (captain),
Wines, Hirasawa, Frost, Soper, But
ton. Rloeser, Wilson, Jacomini, Clark,
Steinhart, Erb, Risling, Sim, Ross,
Templeton, Cookson, Wunne, Hutch
inson and Thoburn. Two of these
players. Milt Haley and Bert Risling,
were later to take their places in the
ranks of the 1911 varsity team which
met defeat at the hands of the Blue
and Gold by a score of 21-3.
An innovation in class activities
was introduced by the Exposition
class on January 19, 1912. It had al
ways been the custom for the Univer
sity President to welcome the new
students to the campus in September

It was in our Freshman year that
Student Control was launched by the

more than on any other class has de

Truly this may be called "The

we played our part was when student

the students. And with this came a

275 of us are here today, having met

have a warm friend and counsellor;
in Dr. Branner, one whose entire time j
is devoted to serving the best inter

Members of the class have spread
the name and fame of Stanford to all
points of the compass on various trips
of athletic teams. Wherever they

Vancouver, the baseball tour of Japan,
the crew journey to the Poughkeep

they carried the true Stanford spirit
of sportsmanship, and whether they
won or lost were always looked upon

has contributed no small share in
I turning out its quota of real Stanford
men.
Against our friend the enemy we
have witnessed especially productive

ford as during the past semester. To
the Seniors, more than to any other

cause on them has fallen the difficult
task of trying to adjust matters and
yet remain firm in what the Univer
s ty stood for in sportsmanship. These
are epochs of no slight importance in

Of peerades, initiations, proms, co

tories. In interclass crew racing the
1915 four has proven superior to all
others on two occasions, the last vic
tory standing out far above all others
when the shell was steered to victory
by Miss Elsie Olcese.
The Exposition Class has been well
to the fore when one stops to consider

that each class has contributed to
varsity teams. It is true that the
class has not stood far above others
but it has certainly held its own. In
rugby we have contributed Haley, Ris

a galaxy of football stars to the var
sity teams.
Our track athletes are few, but
what they lack in numbers is made
up in quality. The class includes
among its members two Pacific Coast
record holders. Captain Bonnett, who
has never been defeated in an inter
collegiate race, heads the list. He is
the only four-star athlete now in the
University, having secured the dis
tinction by winning the half-mile four

He holds the Coast record of 1:54:4

Dawson has recorded alongside of his

the broad jump, making a Coast rec
ord which will probably stand for
some years to come. Bedeau has
shown his superiority in the shot put
three years in succession. In Ric
Templeton the class has been repre
sented by one of the most versatile
athletes that ever donned a spike, and
because of his superior ability he has
been chosen to captain the track team
next year.
The success of the varsity crews for
the past three years is largely due to
the material furnished from the class
of 1915. Led by Captain Jacomini.
Jeffers, Rehm, Hulsman, Wolford,
Haggart, Olmstead and Reineman
have all occupied seats in the varsity
shell. This group of oarsmen has
been the hope and marrow of the vic
torious eights, and has been largely
instrumental in making possible the
trip to the Poughkeepsie regatta this
year.
In baseball Howe, Couch. Dent, Mc-
Closkey and Downing have proved
themselves reliable at all times. Three
times have Dent and McCloskey been
nicked to face the Blue and Gold. Un
able to get along without Babe Dent,
the team has selected him to lead
their destinies next year as captain
of th? nine.
During the past four years minor
sports at Stanford have taken on a
new lease of life, and interest in them
has increased materially. Due to the
efforts of members of the '15 class
basketball was placed on an intercol
legiate basis and elevated to the rank
of a minor sport last year. One year
the entire basketball team was com
posed of players from this class,
namely Davis, Dutton, Blodgett, Ling.
Worthy, Reynolds and Farrar. Wor
thv and Reynolds have guided the
quintet through two seasons and Blod
e:et has been drafted to act as captain
"•ext year. In tennis, Hutchinson.
Sheldon and Sloss form a trio of rac
quet wielders of no ordinary ability.
The latter two captained the varsity
team ir two successive years. To soc
cer. 1915 has contributed Captain

Blodget, Hughes, Dutton, Stenhardt,
Adams and Boyle, the latter having
been selected to captain next year's
soccer team.
Perchance at first glance too much
emphasis lias been placed on athlet
ics, but let us look into other activi
ties and see whether or not the class
of 1915 has played its part. In jour
nalism. the editorship of The Daily
l'alo Alto has been entrusted to Si
monson and Hamilton; and the edi
torial work on the Sequoia to Bennett.
Miss Tisdale and Miss McCoy have
served as woman's editors on the
"Daily." Kilcline, Wynne and Hawk
ins have also been engaged in jour
nalistic work. Hagen lias wielded the
hammer in the publication of Chapar
ral during the past year with Oliver
and Olsen as art editors. Worthy and
Hawkins, as editor and manager re
spectively, are responsible for the 1915
Quad.
In debating Coyle has been the
mainstay of all forensic contests for
the past three years, and has been
ably seconded by Higgins, Weston,
Worthy and Kilcline.
Two dramatic productions of un
usual merit have gone down in the
annals as a credit to the 1915 class.
First of these was the Sophomore
play, "On the Quiet," and second, the
Junior Opera, "The College Prince,"
written by M. A. Hagen. Members of
the class who have made a name for
themselves on the Stanford stage are
the Misses Taff, Gard, Sloss, Trent,
Copper, de Vilbiss and Bryan, and the
Messrs. Forbes, Paul, Gibb, Hynemann,
Bennett, Adams, Higgins, Allen, Tho
burn and Dutton. In musical circles,
Bradford and Gibb have led and man
aged the Band for the past year;
Lynch has guided the destinies of the
Glee Club, and Bennett has made a
name for himself as a soloist.
With Bob Worthy at the helm, the
affairs of the Student Body have been
guided through many ups and downs
during the past year and weathered
the storm successfully, thanks to the
skipper at the steering wheel. L. F.
Reineman has acted as vice-president
of the Student Body and P. J. McClos
key as secretary. The class has been
represented on the Executive Com
mittee by Templeton, Bonnett, Jaco
mini, Rehm, Davis and Bedeau. In
the control of student affairs Beaver,
Bedeau, Card, Davis, Dutton, Gibb,
Hagen, Lynch, Paul, Simonson, Wor
thy and Ziser played a part as mem
bers of the University Conference.
Simonson. as Student Adviser, and
Worthy, as a representative of the
Conference were members of the Stu
dent Council.
The fate of the class has been in
the hands of eight class presidents,
namely, Jameson, Spalding, Davis,
Rehm, Wines, Jacomini, Dent and
Erb. Stiller, Miss Taff, Sinclair, Al
len, Cartwright, Stevens and Temple
ton have been vice-presidents, respec
tively. The writing and .reading of
the minutes has been taken care of by
the Misses Wallace, Burg, Van Zwa
lenburg. McCoy, Todd, McC'ord, Bry
an and Gardiner. As financiers of
the class we record the names of Al
len, Oven, Clark, Partridge, Wynne,
Ling, and Warren.
From the standpoint of scholastic
attainment Fifteen has contributed to
Phi Beta Kappa no less than thirty
four members. The list includes
Misses Browning. Conkling, Curry,
Gray, Ix)op, La Fetra, Newman, Hagel,
Overacker, Poindexter, Prout, Anna
Henrietta Rehmke, Ball. Job, Winn,
Harborer, Hobson, Kreps, Maines,
Rouiller, Sanfo.rd, Tag, Van Etten,
Wildman, Young and Girdner; and
the Messrs. Adams, Moore, Cook,
Clark, Coyle, McCabe and Piatt.
In women's activities Fifteen has
'>cen equally prominent during the
nast four years. Women in the class
have taken an active part in further
ing the success of tennis, fencing,
rowing and basketball, and within the
'nst month won the championship in
the interclass field day. Among
those who have contributed to the var
'ous activities and to conducting the
of the five hundred are the
Misses Gard, McCord, Walls, TafT.
Gardner, Hunt, McCarthy, McCoy,
Gray. Wells. Duryea, Drury, Tisdale.
Parkinson. Bassett, Wood. Knox, Cur
tis and La Fetra.
Thus we have reviewed the part
which this graduating class has

played in the last four years of Stan
ford history. What part it shall con
tinue to play in the capacity of alum
ni remains to be chronicled.
Following is the history ready by
F. C. Hamilton at the exercises Friday:
The "Exposition Class" of this Uni
versity is about to step from the doors
of its alma mater. Before we leave
the dear old Quad let us reilect for a

few minutes over
the events of the
past four years.
Let us call to
mind the vic
tories and de
feats; refresh
our memories
over past hap
penings which
it has been our
pleasure to ex

perience; and chronicle the history of
the University as reflected th.rongh
the class of 1915.
It seems but yesterday that we cut
loose from our hom- surroundings,
took on a new lease of life, and with
initiative and independence set out on
a four year climb to the top of the
hill to secure the much coveted de
gree. During that time we were
to fall into many chasms, individ
ually and collectively, .receive many
scratches and bruises, but eventually
reach the summit where we stand to
day, looking forward for more worlds
to conquer.
We early learned the significance of
the old adage "In union there is
strength." It was on the first Satur
day after registration that we fell be
fore the Sophomores in the annual
underclass tie-up contest. We were
the first to enter the University after j
the "water cure" and the real old-time
tubbing had been prohibited by the
Trustees. Naturally we were more or
less self-opinionated because we had
nothing to fear at the moment, but
our defeat in the rush strongly em
phasized the subserviency of our po
sition.
The fall of 1911 was the first time
t Uo t the Stanford yearlings had to
forego the annual Freshman football
contest with the California cubs. A
decree by the Faculty, issued in May
1911, forever abolished the contest be
tween the babe teams. This, however,
did not interfere with the playing of
a Freshman schedule of eleven games
in which the Stanford 1915 team
scored 107 points to its opponents 27,
and were defeated only twice. It was
the period when several players of
varsity caliber were unearthed. The
twenty Freshmen awarded their block
numerals for competing on the class
team included Milt Haley (captain),
Wines, Hirasawa, Frost, Soper, But
ton. Rloeser, Wilson, Jacomini, Clark,
Steinhart, Erb, Risling, Sim, Ross,
Templeton, Cookson, Wunne, Hutch
inson and Thoburn. Two of these
players. Milt Haley and Bert Risling,
were later to take their places in the
ranks of the 1911 varsity team which
met defeat at the hands of the Blue
and Gold by a score of 21-3.
An innovation in class activities
was introduced by the Exposition
class on January 19, 1912. It had al
ways been the custom for the Univer
sity President to welcome the new
students to the campus in September
of each year. When 1915 entered as

Freshmen, Dr. Jordan was on a
world's peace mission in the Far East
and was thus unable to extend the
customary cordial greeting. In its
place the 1915 class planned a birth
day dinner for our honored Chancel
lor on the occasion of his sixty-first
birthday upon his return from the
Orient. We had exchanged places
w itii Dr. Jordan, being host to him on
his anniversary.
It was in our Freshman year that
Student Control was launched by the
student body. We had heard from the
time that we first set foot on the
Quad that this was"the Golden Age
of Stanford," and .rightly it may be
termed such when we stop to consider
the full significance of self-govern
ment. This is one of the most im
portant events in our four years of
activity. On the present Senior Class
more than on any other class has de
volved the responsibilities of making
Student Control a success. It was
left to us to make or break the oppor
tunities which were ours, and which
we hand down to other classes to
cherish and to strengthen.
Keeping true to tradition 1915
turned out a victorious Freshman
crew, captained by Olmstead, with
Reineman for coxswain. Other mem
bers of the crew who pulled an oar
on the 1915 eight were Hulsman,
Rahm, Haggart, Wolford, Jacomini,
Jeffers and Sinclair. It was in the
spring of the same year that Bonnett
ran his first intercollegiate race, win
ning the half mile in two minutes flat.
The same year Johnny Couch and
Avery Howe were the mainstays of
the baseball team on the pitcher's
mound. In its Freshman year 1915
did not confine its activities to ath
letics by any means. It was repre
sented on the intercollegiate debating
team by Higgins, and on the Tri-State
team by Worthy. In the interclass
debate, the team consisting of Kil
eline, Covle and Higg'ns worsted the
Sophomores in the annual forensic
melee.
We have dwelt at length on the
Freshman year for it is the one year
which stands out in every class as
the one which has meant most to the
individual members of the class. Let
us now hasten on to more recent hap
penings.
Truly this may be called "The
Clolden Age of Stanford" when we stop
to reflect on the events of the past
four years. The first step in which
we played our part was when student
affairs were placed in the hands of
the students. And with this came a
closer bond between the Faculty and
undergraduates, which has grown
stronger year by year. With it has
come a closer cooperation with the
Board of Trustees and the alumni, un
til today the four sides of the Quad
rangle are linked together as co
workers. striving for the best inter
ests of the University, casting aside
personal prejudices. We have wit
nessed the strengthening of scholas
tic standards at the University, and
275 of us are here today, having met
requirements, to present our
selves for graduation. It has been
"'•r rood fortune to be honored by
*«vo presidents during our brief resi

deuce on trie farm. In Dr. Jordan we
have a warm friend and counsellor;
in Dr. Branner, one whose entire time j
is devoted to serving the best inter
ests of the University, and one who is
ever ready to listen to our appeals
and troubles.
Members of the class have spread
the name and fame of Stanford to all
points of the compass on various trips
of athletic teams. Wherever they
went, whether in the rugby trip to
Vancouver, the baseball tour of Japan,
the crew journey to the Poughkeep
sie regatta, or the track trip to the
conference meets in the Middle West,
they carried the true Stanford spirit
of sportsmanship, and whether they
won or lost were always looked upon
with equal favor. It is the men of
Stanford that count, and not merely
their achievements on the turf, dia
mond, water or cinder path. And 1915
has contributed no small share in
I turning out its quota of real Stanford
men.
Against our friend the enemy we
have witnessed especially productive
years when we measure victories
against defeats; one defeat, one tie
and two victories in rugby; one de
feat and three victories in track; four
times winner on the water against the
Blue and Cold eights; split event in
four intercollegiate battles on the
forensic platform, and lost three out
of four intercollegiate baseball series.
In our Sophomore year, sad to say,
but nevertheless true, we were defeat
ed in the annual underclass tie-up due
to the superior number of inferior
forces. Soon after the ' semester
opened Stanford attained her major
ity in age on October 1, 1912. Just
one year later Dr. Branner was in
stalled as President of the University,
a memorable event in the eyes of each
one of us. And then in our Junior
year came the Plug-Ugly with its at
tendant consequences. The powers
that be. namely the University Con
ference. abolished the Plug-Ugly as it
was then presented and left it to the
classes of '15 and '10 to find a satis
factory substitute for the upperclass
battle. The Plug-Ugly was revised, as
we all know, by omitting the objec
tionable features and reinstating the
remains. What ; ts future will be only
time can tell. The rush itself proved
a dismal failure last semester. The
Seniors took absolutely no interest in
withholding the onslaught of the
j Juniors, and the sixteen class lacked
j even the incentive to secure their own
plug hats.
The laying of the posters when we
were Juniors gave us a world of ex
perience when it came to foiling the
vain endeavors cf the 191G class last
semester. The cup of experience is
often a bitter dose to swallow when
it carries defeat with it. but that was
price that 1915 had to pay when
she attempted to lay the Junior
posters in the fall of 1913. Last se
mester it was a different story we told
tb? campus the next morning as the
c un rose over the horizon. It was the
morning after the sixteeners had made
a fut le attempt to lav their posters.
The story was of the Juniors in stocks,
and how they had been completely
baffled in their attempt to smear the

campus with the customary third-
I year posters.
Two of the most recent happenings
i in which the class has played an ac
j tive part are th? opening of the Stan
; ford Union and the Woman's Club
House, and the crisis in intercollegiate
relations with California. The inter-
I est that the class of 191") takes in the
! Union is probably stronger than any
I other class for the reason that its
members look at its significance from
two angles, namely, as undergraduates
and alumni. As Seniors we realize
its importance as a potent force in
promoting democracy between stu
dents and faculty; and as alumni,
which we hope to be within a few
days, we can see its significance as a
commingling ground for students,
alumni. Faculty and Trustees. More
over, "We need the Union" has been
ringing in our ears since the first se
mester, and now it is an integral part
of graduate and undergraduate life.
Never in the history of athletics has
such a crisis existed in the athletic
relations between California and Stan-

ford as during the past semester. To
the Seniors, more than to any other
class, the present situation is due, be
cause on them has fallen the difficult
task of trying to adjust matters and
yet remain firm in what the Univer
s ty stood for in sportsmanship. These
are epochs of no slight importance in
comparison with the usual events of
each college generation.
Of peerades, initiations, proms, co
tillions, operas, rallies, Irish mara
thons and bonfires we have had our
full. And by the way, the 1915
Freshman bonfire reached the high
water mark in the accomplishments of
a similar nature. In interclass activ
ities, 1915 has shared the honors with
the other classes and taken a fair
sized number of victories. In base
ball the class has twice been declared
champion; in rugby, records indicate
1915 a one-time winner; three basket
ball championships have been accred
ited to the class, and two soccer vic
tories. In interclass crew racing the
1915 four has proven superior to all
others on two occasions, the last vic
tory standing out far above all others
when the shell was steered to victory
by Miss Elsie Olcese.
The Exposition Class has been well
to the fore when one stops to consider
or compare the number of athletes
that each class has contributed to
varsity teams. It is true that the
class has not stood far above others
but it has certainly held its own. In
rugby we have contributed Haley, Ris
ling, Erb, Soper, Wines and Rehm as
a galaxy of football stars to the var
sity teams.
Our track athletes are few, but
what they lack in numbers is made
up in quality. The class includes
among its members two Pacific Coast
record holders. Captain Bonnett, who
has never been defeated in an inter
collegiate race, heads the list. He is
the only four-star athlete now in the
University, having secured the dis
tinction by winning the half-mile four
times in succession against California.
He holds the Coast record of 1:54:4
in his popular distance, while Don
Dawson has recorded alongside of his
name the mark of 23 feet 7 inches in
the broad jump, making a Coast rec
ord which will probably stand for
some years to come. Bedeau has
shown his superiority in the shot put
three years in succession. In Ric
Templeton the class has been repre
sented by one of the most versatile
athletes that ever donned a spike, and
because of his superior ability he has
been chosen to captain the track team
next year.
The success of the varsity crews for
the past three years is largely due to
the material furnished from the class
of 1915. Led by Captain Jacomini.
Jeffers, Rehm, Hulsman, Wolford,
Haggart, Olmstead and Reineman
have all occupied seats in the varsity
shell. This group of oarsmen has
been the hope and marrow of the vic
torious eights, and has been largely
instrumental in making possible the
trip to the Poughkeepsie regatta this
year.
In baseball Howe, Couch. Dent, Mc-
Closkey and Downing have proved
themselves reliable at all times. Three
times have Dent and McCloskey been
nicked to face the Blue and Gold. Un
able to get along without Babe Dent,
the team has selected him to lead
their destinies next year as captain
of th? nine.
During the past four years minor
sports at Stanford have taken on a
new lease of life, and interest in them
has increased materially. Due to the
efforts of members of the '15 class
basketball was placed on an intercol
legiate basis and elevated to the rank
of a minor sport last year. One year
the entire basketball team was com
posed of players from this class,
namely Davis, Dutton, Blodgett, Ling.
Worthy, Reynolds and Farrar. Wor
thv and Reynolds have guided the
quintet through two seasons and Blod
e:et has been drafted to act as captain
"•ext year. In tennis, Hutchinson.
Sheldon and Sloss form a trio of rac
quet wielders of no ordinary ability.
The latter two captained the varsity
team ir two successive years. To soc
cer. 1915 has contributed Captain

Blodget, Hughes, Dutton, Stenhardt,
Adams and Boyle, the latter having
been selected to captain next year's
soccer team.
Perchance at first glance too much
emphasis lias been placed on athlet
ics, but let us look into other activi
ties and see whether or not the class
of 1915 has played its part. In jour
nalism. the editorship of The Daily
l'alo Alto has been entrusted to Si
monson and Hamilton; and the edi
torial work on the Sequoia to Bennett.
Miss Tisdale and Miss McCoy have
served as woman's editors on the
"Daily." Kilcline, Wynne and Hawk
ins have also been engaged in jour
nalistic work. Hagen lias wielded the
hammer in the publication of Chapar
ral during the past year with Oliver
and Olsen as art editors. Worthy and
Hawkins, as editor and manager re
spectively, are responsible for the 1915
Quad.
In debating Coyle has been the
mainstay of all forensic contests for
the past three years, and has been
ably seconded by Higgins, Weston,
Worthy and Kilcline.
Two dramatic productions of un
usual merit have gone down in the
annals as a credit to the 1915 class.
First of these was the Sophomore
play, "On the Quiet," and second, the
Junior Opera, "The College Prince,"
written by M. A. Hagen. Members of
the class who have made a name for
themselves on the Stanford stage are
the Misses Taff, Gard, Sloss, Trent,

Messrs. Forbes, Paul, Gibb, Hynemann,

burn and Dutton. In musical circles,
Bradford and Gibb have led and man

Lynch has guided the destinies of the

With Bob Worthy at the helm, the
affairs of the Student Body have been

during the past year and weathered
the storm successfully, thanks to the
skipper at the steering wheel. L. F.
Reineman has acted as vice-president
of the Student Body and P. J. McClos

mini, Rehm, Davis and Bedeau. In
the control of student affairs Beaver,
Bedeau, Card, Davis, Dutton, Gibb,
Hagen, Lynch, Paul, Simonson, Wor
thy and Ziser played a part as mem
bers of the University Conference.
Simonson. as Student Adviser, and
Worthy, as a representative of the
Conference were members of the Stu
dent Council.
The fate of the class has been in
the hands of eight class presidents,
namely, Jameson, Spalding, Davis,
Rehm, Wines, Jacomini, Dent and
Erb. Stiller, Miss Taff, Sinclair, Al
len, Cartwright, Stevens and Temple
ton have been vice-presidents, respec
tively. The writing and .reading of
the minutes has been taken care of by
the Misses Wallace, Burg, Van Zwa
lenburg. McCoy, Todd, McC'ord, Bry
an and Gardiner. As financiers of
the class we record the names of Al
len, Oven, Clark, Partridge, Wynne,
Ling, and Warren.
From the standpoint of scholastic
attainment Fifteen has contributed to
Phi Beta Kappa no less than thirty
four members. The list includes
Misses Browning. Conkling, Curry,

the Messrs. Adams, Moore, Cook,

In women's activities Fifteen has

Thus we have reviewed the part
which this graduating class has

played in the last four years of Stan
ford history. What part it shall con

ni remains to be chronicled.

The "Exposition Class" of this Uni

players. Milt Haley and Bert Risling,
were later to take their places in the
ranks of the 1911 varsity team which
met defeat at the hands of the Blue
and Gold by a score of 21-3.

penings.
Truly this may be called "The
Clolden Age of Stanford" when we stop
to reflect on the events of the past
four years. The first step in which
we played our part was when student
affairs were placed in the hands of
the students. And with this came a
closer bond between the Faculty and
undergraduates, which has grown
stronger year by year. With it has
come a closer cooperation with the
Board of Trustees and the alumni, un
til today the four sides of the Quad
rangle are linked together as co
workers. striving for the best inter
ests of the University, casting aside
personal prejudices. We have wit
nessed the strengthening of scholas
tic standards at the University, and
275 of us are here today, having met
requirements, to present our
selves for graduation. It has been
"'•r rood fortune to be honored by
*«vo presidents during our brief resi

deuce on trie farm. In Dr. Jordan we
have a warm friend and counsellor;
in Dr. Branner, one whose entire time j
is devoted to serving the best inter
ests of the University, and one who is
ever ready to listen to our appeals
and troubles.
Members of the class have spread
the name and fame of Stanford to all
points of the compass on various trips
of athletic teams. Wherever they
went, whether in the rugby trip to
Vancouver, the baseball tour of Japan,
the crew journey to the Poughkeep
sie regatta, or the track trip to the
conference meets in the Middle West,
they carried the true Stanford spirit
of sportsmanship, and whether they
won or lost were always looked upon
with equal favor. It is the men of
Stanford that count, and not merely
their achievements on the turf, dia
mond, water or cinder path. And 1915
has contributed no small share in
I turning out its quota of real Stanford
men.
Against our friend the enemy we
have witnessed especially productive
years when we measure victories
against defeats; one defeat, one tie
and two victories in rugby; one de
feat and three victories in track; four
times winner on the water against the
Blue and Cold eights; split event in
four intercollegiate battles on the
forensic platform, and lost three out
of four intercollegiate baseball series.
In our Sophomore year, sad to say,
but nevertheless true, we were defeat
ed in the annual underclass tie-up due
to the superior number of inferior
forces. Soon after the ' semester
opened Stanford attained her major
ity in age on October 1, 1912. Just
one year later Dr. Branner was in
stalled as President of the University,
a memorable event in the eyes of each
one of us. And then in our Junior
year came the Plug-Ugly with its at
tendant consequences. The powers
that be. namely the University Con
ference. abolished the Plug-Ugly as it
was then presented and left it to the
classes of '15 and '10 to find a satis
factory substitute for the upperclass
battle. The Plug-Ugly was revised, as
we all know, by omitting the objec
tionable features and reinstating the
remains. What ; ts future will be only
time can tell. The rush itself proved
a dismal failure last semester. The
Seniors took absolutely no interest in
withholding the onslaught of the
j Juniors, and the sixteen class lacked
j even the incentive to secure their own
plug hats.
The laying of the posters when we
were Juniors gave us a world of ex
perience when it came to foiling the
vain endeavors cf the 191G class last
semester. The cup of experience is
often a bitter dose to swallow when
it carries defeat with it. but that was
price that 1915 had to pay when
she attempted to lay the Junior
posters in the fall of 1913. Last se
mester it was a different story we told
tb? campus the next morning as the
c un rose over the horizon. It was the
morning after the sixteeners had made
a fut le attempt to lav their posters.
The story was of the Juniors in stocks,
and how they had been completely
baffled in their attempt to smear the

campus with the customary third-
I year posters.
Two of the most recent happenings
i in which the class has played an ac
j tive part are th? opening of the Stan
; ford Union and the Woman's Club
House, and the crisis in intercollegiate
relations with California. The inter-
I est that the class of 191") takes in the
! Union is probably stronger than any
I other class for the reason that its
members look at its significance from
two angles, namely, as undergraduates
and alumni. As Seniors we realize
its importance as a potent force in
promoting democracy between stu
dents and faculty; and as alumni,
which we hope to be within a few
days, we can see its significance as a
commingling ground for students,
alumni. Faculty and Trustees. More
over, "We need the Union" has been
ringing in our ears since the first se
mester, and now it is an integral part
of graduate and undergraduate life.
Never in the history of athletics has
such a crisis existed in the athletic
relations between California and Stan-

ford as during the past semester. To
the Seniors, more than to any other
class, the present situation is due, be
cause on them has fallen the difficult
task of trying to adjust matters and
yet remain firm in what the Univer
s ty stood for in sportsmanship. These
are epochs of no slight importance in
comparison with the usual events of
each college generation.
Of peerades, initiations, proms, co
tillions, operas, rallies, Irish mara
thons and bonfires we have had our
full. And by the way, the 1915
Freshman bonfire reached the high
water mark in the accomplishments of
a similar nature. In interclass activ
ities, 1915 has shared the honors with
the other classes and taken a fair
sized number of victories. In base
ball the class has twice been declared
champion; in rugby, records indicate
1915 a one-time winner; three basket
ball championships have been accred
ited to the class, and two soccer vic
tories. In interclass crew racing the
1915 four has proven superior to all
others on two occasions, the last vic
tory standing out far above all others
when the shell was steered to victory
by Miss Elsie Olcese.
The Exposition Class has been well
to the fore when one stops to consider
or compare the number of athletes
that each class has contributed to
varsity teams. It is true that the
class has not stood far above others
but it has certainly held its own. In
rugby we have contributed Haley, Ris
ling, Erb, Soper, Wines and Rehm as
a galaxy of football stars to the var
sity teams.
Our track athletes are few, but
what they lack in numbers is made
up in quality. The class includes
among its members two Pacific Coast
record holders. Captain Bonnett, who
has never been defeated in an inter
collegiate race, heads the list. He is
the only four-star athlete now in the
University, having secured the dis
tinction by winning the half-mile four
times in succession against California.
He holds the Coast record of 1:54:4
in his popular distance, while Don
Dawson has recorded alongside of his
name the mark of 23 feet 7 inches in
the broad jump, making a Coast rec
ord which will probably stand for
some years to come. Bedeau has
shown his superiority in the shot put
three years in succession. In Ric
Templeton the class has been repre
sented by one of the most versatile
athletes that ever donned a spike, and
because of his superior ability he has
been chosen to captain the track team
next year.
The success of the varsity crews for
the past three years is largely due to
the material furnished from the class
of 1915. Led by Captain Jacomini.
Jeffers, Rehm, Hulsman, Wolford,
Haggart, Olmstead and Reineman
have all occupied seats in the varsity
shell. This group of oarsmen has
been the hope and marrow of the vic
torious eights, and has been largely
instrumental in making possible the
trip to the Poughkeepsie regatta this
year.
In baseball Howe, Couch. Dent, Mc-
Closkey and Downing have proved
themselves reliable at all times. Three
times have Dent and McCloskey been
nicked to face the Blue and Gold. Un
able to get along without Babe Dent,
the team has selected him to lead
their destinies next year as captain
of th? nine.
During the past four years minor
sports at Stanford have taken on a
new lease of life, and interest in them
has increased materially. Due to the
efforts of members of the '15 class
basketball was placed on an intercol
legiate basis and elevated to the rank
of a minor sport last year. One year
the entire basketball team was com
posed of players from this class,
namely Davis, Dutton, Blodgett, Ling.
Worthy, Reynolds and Farrar. Wor
thv and Reynolds have guided the
quintet through two seasons and Blod
e:et has been drafted to act as captain
"•ext year. In tennis, Hutchinson.
Sheldon and Sloss form a trio of rac
quet wielders of no ordinary ability.
The latter two captained the varsity
team ir two successive years. To soc
cer. 1915 has contributed Captain

Blodget, Hughes, Dutton, Stenhardt,
Adams and Boyle, the latter having
been selected to captain next year's
soccer team.
Perchance at first glance too much
emphasis lias been placed on athlet
ics, but let us look into other activi
ties and see whether or not the class
of 1915 has played its part. In jour
nalism. the editorship of The Daily
l'alo Alto has been entrusted to Si
monson and Hamilton; and the edi
torial work on the Sequoia to Bennett.
Miss Tisdale and Miss McCoy have
served as woman's editors on the
"Daily." Kilcline, Wynne and Hawk
ins have also been engaged in jour
nalistic work. Hagen lias wielded the
hammer in the publication of Chapar
ral during the past year with Oliver
and Olsen as art editors. Worthy and
Hawkins, as editor and manager re
spectively, are responsible for the 1915
Quad.
In debating Coyle has been the
mainstay of all forensic contests for
the past three years, and has been
ably seconded by Higgins, Weston,
Worthy and Kilcline.
Two dramatic productions of un
usual merit have gone down in the
annals as a credit to the 1915 class.
First of these was the Sophomore
play, "On the Quiet," and second, the
Junior Opera, "The College Prince,"
written by M. A. Hagen. Members of
the class who have made a name for
themselves on the Stanford stage are
the Misses Taff, Gard, Sloss, Trent,
Copper, de Vilbiss and Bryan, and the
Messrs. Forbes, Paul, Gibb, Hynemann,
Bennett, Adams, Higgins, Allen, Tho
burn and Dutton. In musical circles,
Bradford and Gibb have led and man
aged the Band for the past year;
Lynch has guided the destinies of the
Glee Club, and Bennett has made a
name for himself as a soloist.
With Bob Worthy at the helm, the
affairs of the Student Body have been
guided through many ups and downs
during the past year and weathered
the storm successfully, thanks to the
skipper at the steering wheel. L. F.
Reineman has acted as vice-president
of the Student Body and P. J. McClos
key as secretary. The class has been
represented on the Executive Com
mittee by Templeton, Bonnett, Jaco
mini, Rehm, Davis and Bedeau. In
the control of student affairs Beaver,
Bedeau, Card, Davis, Dutton, Gibb,
Hagen, Lynch, Paul, Simonson, Wor
thy and Ziser played a part as mem
bers of the University Conference.
Simonson. as Student Adviser, and
Worthy, as a representative of the
Conference were members of the Stu
dent Council.
The fate of the class has been in
the hands of eight class presidents,
namely, Jameson, Spalding, Davis,
Rehm, Wines, Jacomini, Dent and
Erb. Stiller, Miss Taff, Sinclair, Al
len, Cartwright, Stevens and Temple
ton have been vice-presidents, respec
tively. The writing and .reading of
the minutes has been taken care of by
the Misses Wallace, Burg, Van Zwa
lenburg. McCoy, Todd, McC'ord, Bry
an and Gardiner. As financiers of
the class we record the names of Al
len, Oven, Clark, Partridge, Wynne,
Ling, and Warren.
From the standpoint of scholastic
attainment Fifteen has contributed to
Phi Beta Kappa no less than thirty
four members. The list includes
Misses Browning. Conkling, Curry,
Gray, Ix)op, La Fetra, Newman, Hagel,
Overacker, Poindexter, Prout, Anna
Henrietta Rehmke, Ball. Job, Winn,
Harborer, Hobson, Kreps, Maines,
Rouiller, Sanfo.rd, Tag, Van Etten,
Wildman, Young and Girdner; and
the Messrs. Adams, Moore, Cook,
Clark, Coyle, McCabe and Piatt.
In women's activities Fifteen has
'>cen equally prominent during the
nast four years. Women in the class
have taken an active part in further
ing the success of tennis, fencing,
rowing and basketball, and within the
'nst month won the championship in
the interclass field day. Among
those who have contributed to the var
'ous activities and to conducting the
of the five hundred are the
Misses Gard, McCord, Walls, TafT.
Gardner, Hunt, McCarthy, McCoy,
Gray. Wells. Duryea, Drury, Tisdale.
Parkinson. Bassett, Wood. Knox, Cur
tis and La Fetra.
Thus we have reviewed the part
which this graduating class has

played in the last four years of Stan
ford history. What part it shall con
tinue to play in the capacity of alum
ni remains to be chronicled.
Following is the history ready by
F. C. Hamilton at the exercises Friday:
The "Exposition Class" of this Uni
versity is about to step from the doors
of its alma mater. Before we leave
the dear old Quad let us reilect for a

few minutes over
the events of the
past four years.
Let us call to
mind the vic
tories and de
feats; refresh
our memories
over past hap
penings which
it has been our
pleasure to ex

perience; and chronicle the history of
the University as reflected th.rongh
the class of 1915.
It seems but yesterday that we cut
loose from our hom- surroundings,
took on a new lease of life, and with
initiative and independence set out on
a four year climb to the top of the
hill to secure the much coveted de
gree. During that time we were
to fall into many chasms, individ
ually and collectively, .receive many
scratches and bruises, but eventually
reach the summit where we stand to
day, looking forward for more worlds
to conquer.
We early learned the significance of
the old adage "In union there is
strength." It was on the first Satur
day after registration that we fell be
fore the Sophomores in the annual
underclass tie-up contest. We were
the first to enter the University after j
the "water cure" and the real old-time
tubbing had been prohibited by the
Trustees. Naturally we were more or
less self-opinionated because we had
nothing to fear at the moment, but
our defeat in the rush strongly em
phasized the subserviency of our po
sition.
The fall of 1911 was the first time
t Uo t the Stanford yearlings had to
forego the annual Freshman football
contest with the California cubs. A
decree by the Faculty, issued in May
1911, forever abolished the contest be
tween the babe teams. This, however,
did not interfere with the playing of
a Freshman schedule of eleven games
in which the Stanford 1915 team
scored 107 points to its opponents 27,
and were defeated only twice. It was
the period when several players of
varsity caliber were unearthed. The
twenty Freshmen awarded their block
numerals for competing on the class
team included Milt Haley (captain),
Wines, Hirasawa, Frost, Soper, But
ton. Rloeser, Wilson, Jacomini, Clark,
Steinhart, Erb, Risling, Sim, Ross,
Templeton, Cookson, Wunne, Hutch
inson and Thoburn. Two of these
players. Milt Haley and Bert Risling,
were later to take their places in the
ranks of the 1911 varsity team which
met defeat at the hands of the Blue
and Gold by a score of 21-3.
An innovation in class activities
was introduced by the Exposition
class on January 19, 1912. It had al
ways been the custom for the Univer
sity President to welcome the new
students to the campus in September
of each year. When 1915 entered as

Freshmen, Dr. Jordan was on a
world's peace mission in the Far East
and was thus unable to extend the
customary cordial greeting. In its
place the 1915 class planned a birth
day dinner for our honored Chancel
lor on the occasion of his sixty-first
birthday upon his return from the
Orient. We had exchanged places
w itii Dr. Jordan, being host to him on
his anniversary.
It was in our Freshman year that
Student Control was launched by the
student body. We had heard from the
time that we first set foot on the
Quad that this was"the Golden Age
of Stanford," and .rightly it may be
termed such when we stop to consider
the full significance of self-govern
ment. This is one of the most im
portant events in our four years of
activity. On the present Senior Class
more than on any other class has de
volved the responsibilities of making
Student Control a success. It was
left to us to make or break the oppor
tunities which were ours, and which
we hand down to other classes to
cherish and to strengthen.
Keeping true to tradition 1915
turned out a victorious Freshman
crew, captained by Olmstead, with
Reineman for coxswain. Other mem
bers of the crew who pulled an oar
on the 1915 eight were Hulsman,
Rahm, Haggart, Wolford, Jacomini,
Jeffers and Sinclair. It was in the
spring of the same year that Bonnett
ran his first intercollegiate race, win
ning the half mile in two minutes flat.
The same year Johnny Couch and
Avery Howe were the mainstays of
the baseball team on the pitcher's
mound. In its Freshman year 1915
did not confine its activities to ath
letics by any means. It was repre
sented on the intercollegiate debating
team by Higgins, and on the Tri-State
team by Worthy. In the interclass
debate, the team consisting of Kil
eline, Covle and Higg'ns worsted the
Sophomores in the annual forensic
melee.
We have dwelt at length on the
Freshman year for it is the one year
which stands out in every class as
the one which has meant most to the
individual members of the class. Let
us now hasten on to more recent hap
penings.
Truly this may be called "The
Clolden Age of Stanford" when we stop
to reflect on the events of the past
four years. The first step in which
we played our part was when student
affairs were placed in the hands of
the students. And with this came a
closer bond between the Faculty and
undergraduates, which has grown
stronger year by year. With it has
come a closer cooperation with the
Board of Trustees and the alumni, un
til today the four sides of the Quad
rangle are linked together as co
workers. striving for the best inter
ests of the University, casting aside
personal prejudices. We have wit
nessed the strengthening of scholas
tic standards at the University, and
275 of us are here today, having met
requirements, to present our
selves for graduation. It has been
"'•r rood fortune to be honored by
*«vo presidents during our brief resi

deuce on trie farm. In Dr. Jordan we
have a warm friend and counsellor;
in Dr. Branner, one whose entire time j
is devoted to serving the best inter
ests of the University, and one who is
ever ready to listen to our appeals
and troubles.
Members of the class have spread
the name and fame of Stanford to all
points of the compass on various trips
of athletic teams. Wherever they
went, whether in the rugby trip to
Vancouver, the baseball tour of Japan,
the crew journey to the Poughkeep
sie regatta, or the track trip to the
conference meets in the Middle West,
they carried the true Stanford spirit
of sportsmanship, and whether they
won or lost were always looked upon
with equal favor. It is the men of
Stanford that count, and not merely
their achievements on the turf, dia
mond, water or cinder path. And 1915
has contributed no small share in
I turning out its quota of real Stanford
men.
Against our friend the enemy we
have witnessed especially productive
years when we measure victories
against defeats; one defeat, one tie
and two victories in rugby; one de
feat and three victories in track; four
times winner on the water against the
Blue and Cold eights; split event in
four intercollegiate battles on the
forensic platform, and lost three out
of four intercollegiate baseball series.
In our Sophomore year, sad to say,
but nevertheless true, we were defeat

to the superior number of inferior
forces. Soon after the ' semester
opened Stanford attained her major

time can tell. The rush itself proved
a dismal failure last semester. The
Seniors took absolutely no interest in

The laying of the posters when we
were Juniors gave us a world of ex

often a bitter dose to swallow when
it carries defeat with it. but that was

The story was of the Juniors in stocks,
and how they had been completely
baffled in their attempt to smear the

campus with the customary third-
I year posters.
Two of the most recent happenings
i in which the class has played an ac
j tive part are th? opening of the Stan
; ford Union and the Woman's Club
House, and the crisis in intercollegiate
relations with California. The inter-
I est that the class of 191") takes in the
! Union is probably stronger than any
I other class for the reason that its
members look at its significance from
two angles, namely, as undergraduates
and alumni. As Seniors we realize
its importance as a potent force in
promoting democracy between stu
dents and faculty; and as alumni,
which we hope to be within a few
days, we can see its significance as a
commingling ground for students,
alumni. Faculty and Trustees. More
over, "We need the Union" has been
ringing in our ears since the first se
mester, and now it is an integral part
of graduate and undergraduate life.
Never in the history of athletics has
such a crisis existed in the athletic
relations between California and Stan-

ford as during the past semester. To
the Seniors, more than to any other

tories. In interclass crew racing the
1915 four has proven superior to all
others on two occasions, the last vic
tory standing out far above all others
when the shell was steered to victory
by Miss Elsie Olcese.
The Exposition Class has been well
to the fore when one stops to consider

that each class has contributed to
varsity teams. It is true that the
class has not stood far above others
but it has certainly held its own. In
rugby we have contributed Haley, Ris

a galaxy of football stars to the var
sity teams.
Our track athletes are few, but
what they lack in numbers is made

among its members two Pacific Coast

has never been defeated in an inter

During the past four years minor
sports at Stanford have taken on a
new lease of life, and interest in them
has increased materially. Due to the
efforts of members of the '15 class
basketball was placed on an intercol
legiate basis and elevated to the rank
of a minor sport last year. One year
the entire basketball team was com

Perchance at first glance too much

of 1915 has played its part. In jour

Miss Tisdale and Miss McCoy have

spectively, are responsible for the 1915
Quad.
In debating Coyle has been the

Two dramatic productions of un
