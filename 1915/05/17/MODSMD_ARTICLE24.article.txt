The following class will was read by
.T. D. Adams at the exercises Friday:
We, the class of 1915 of Leland
Stanford Junior University, being low
in spirit, for that we expect three
flays hence to make our last corporeal
appearance upon the Stanford stage,
and leaving it as Bachelors of Arts,
to depart this life at Stanford, yet be
ing of sound mind and understand
ing. do hereby make disposition of our
estate, gathered in four years togeth
er, in manner following:
To Danny Carroll do we bequeath
next season's rugby squad, with
hopes that he may lead a team, with
Freshmen in it, against the California
befr. and so bring back a third
straight victory.
The crew, en route for laurels at
Poughkeepsie, we leave till June 26th
to Skipper .Tacomini, with a devise
over to Chic Orme, in whose bands we
confidently place our prospects for
another winning eight.
To the athletes of the cinder path
we give Ric Templeton as leader,
trusting that he and his team will
bring home another victory without
the need for that last winning jump.
And to tho baseball team we grant
Babe Dent as captain, in whose exper
ienced judgment we place the great
est confidence, and whose duty it is
to make a winning nine.
To these four captains, and to the
captains of the minor sports (who
number two from 1915's ranks) and to
the coach and trainer, and to a thou
sand loyal rooters and their leader
Johnnv Goodman, we leave in trust
the Stanford reputation for fair play,
clean sport, and good natured rivalry.
The Daily Palo Alto we bestow up
| r«n ppp] Ptaniford, the Chaparral we
sra'it to Hip Levy, and to Jim Bennett
'••r ipqv" tbe Sefuoia, with full confi
r*erc° in th<* abilities of these our
chosen editors.
The Student Body we consign to the
safe guidance of Skin Wilson, con

vinced ot his ability to run things,
and to defend from transbay accusa
tions and attacks its rights and dig
nities. And to Earl Charles, Squire
Bahrens, do we bequeath the keeping
of the Student Body's moneys, trust
ing that all his future operations will
be financial, and as successful as the
last.
To 1916 we bequeath the Sombrero,
with all of respect, dignity, and Stu
dent Body authority that go therewith.
To 1917 we grant the right to garb
themselves in corduroy, symbol of up
poiclass rank; and to them we leave
the Plugs (those relics of a custom
near discarded) which shall be only
worn when they have been well crum
pled in the .rush.
And from the wearing of the Fresh
man cap do we release 1918, giving to
them instead the cardinal hat, and
furthermore appoint them guardians
of the infant nineteen, and leave to
them its proper introduction to the
campus.
To every member of this commu
nity, from honored President to hum
ble frosh, do we bequeath the Stan
ford Union and the Woman's Club
House, for every meeting, formal or
informal, where democratic comrade
ship may be preserved and fostered,
and faculty and students meet on com
mon ground. And to the campus too
we leave, ringing again the chimes,
not less beautiful from nine years of
silenie; and a flag as well that floats
on gala days beside the Stars and
Stripes.
I hese all, our dear possessions, we
bequeath to the aforesaid beneficiaries
ibfolutely and without reserve, as is
fitting in a body near its end; but
though our course here is nearly run,
some things we cannot leave, so much
are they a part of us. These we take
with us as we go, knowing our taking
leaves but the more behind.
So what of work and play we have
had here, we take the memory, and
give a promise to cherish it; and
what we have learned, in and out of
classes, and in and out of books, of
appreciation of what is fair and true,
of strength and comradeship in right,
of ideals and abilities in action, of
that something we call the Stanford
Spirit, we cannot leave behind us. but
in the taking share with those who
stay, and so rather enrich than rob
1 the whole.
Intermingled and inextricably linked
with this will be the memories of the
Campus we are leaving, of Moorish
arches "where the red tiles rim the
blue, and of the men and women here
that we have come to know, and profit
by the knowing: President and Chan
cellor and Faculty. But of our Presi
dent we grieve to say it is beyond our
nower to grant him over to succeed
ing generations. To him especially
we pledge our lasting honor and af
i fection.
Thus having disposed of all our
earthly and spiritual possessions, and
looking forward to the hour when we
depart, in testimony of this our will
we hereby set our hand and seal, this
fourteenth day of May 1915.

befr. and so bring back a third
straight victory.
The crew, en route for laurels at
Poughkeepsie, we leave till June 26th
to Skipper .Tacomini, with a devise
over to Chic Orme, in whose bands we
confidently place our prospects for
another winning eight.
To the athletes of the cinder path
we give Ric Templeton as leader,
trusting that he and his team will
bring home another victory without
the need for that last winning jump.
And to tho baseball team we grant
Babe Dent as captain, in whose exper
ienced judgment we place the great
est confidence, and whose duty it is
to make a winning nine.
To these four captains, and to the
captains of the minor sports (who
number two from 1915's ranks) and to
the coach and trainer, and to a thou
sand loyal rooters and their leader
Johnnv Goodman, we leave in trust
the Stanford reputation for fair play,
clean sport, and good natured rivalry.
The Daily Palo Alto we bestow up
| r«n ppp] Ptaniford, the Chaparral we
sra'it to Hip Levy, and to Jim Bennett
'••r ipqv" tbe Sefuoia, with full confi
r*erc° in th<* abilities of these our
chosen editors.
The Student Body we consign to the
safe guidance of Skin Wilson, con

vinced ot his ability to run things,
and to defend from transbay accusa
tions and attacks its rights and dig
nities. And to Earl Charles, Squire
Bahrens, do we bequeath the keeping
of the Student Body's moneys, trust
ing that all his future operations will
be financial, and as successful as the
last.
To 1916 we bequeath the Sombrero,
with all of respect, dignity, and Stu
dent Body authority that go therewith.
To 1917 we grant the right to garb
themselves in corduroy, symbol of up
poiclass rank; and to them we leave
the Plugs (those relics of a custom
near discarded) which shall be only
worn when they have been well crum
pled in the .rush.
And from the wearing of the Fresh
man cap do we release 1918, giving to
them instead the cardinal hat, and
furthermore appoint them guardians
of the infant nineteen, and leave to
them its proper introduction to the
campus.
To every member of this commu
nity, from honored President to hum
ble frosh, do we bequeath the Stan
ford Union and the Woman's Club
House, for every meeting, formal or
informal, where democratic comrade
ship may be preserved and fostered,
and faculty and students meet on com
mon ground. And to the campus too
we leave, ringing again the chimes,
not less beautiful from nine years of
silenie; and a flag as well that floats
on gala days beside the Stars and
Stripes.
I hese all, our dear possessions, we
bequeath to the aforesaid beneficiaries
ibfolutely and without reserve, as is
fitting in a body near its end; but
though our course here is nearly run,
some things we cannot leave, so much
are they a part of us. These we take
with us as we go, knowing our taking
leaves but the more behind.
So what of work and play we have
had here, we take the memory, and
give a promise to cherish it; and
what we have learned, in and out of
classes, and in and out of books, of
appreciation of what is fair and true,
of strength and comradeship in right,
of ideals and abilities in action, of
that something we call the Stanford
Spirit, we cannot leave behind us. but
in the taking share with those who
stay, and so rather enrich than rob
1 the whole.
Intermingled and inextricably linked
with this will be the memories of the
Campus we are leaving, of Moorish
arches "where the red tiles rim the
blue, and of the men and women here
that we have come to know, and profit
by the knowing: President and Chan
cellor and Faculty. But of our Presi
dent we grieve to say it is beyond our
nower to grant him over to succeed
ing generations. To him especially
we pledge our lasting honor and af
i fection.
Thus having disposed of all our
earthly and spiritual possessions, and
looking forward to the hour when we
depart, in testimony of this our will
we hereby set our hand and seal, this
fourteenth day of May 1915.

To these four captains, and to the
captains of the minor sports (who
number two from 1915's ranks) and to
the coach and trainer, and to a thou
sand loyal rooters and their leader
Johnnv Goodman, we leave in trust
the Stanford reputation for fair play,
clean sport, and good natured rivalry.
The Daily Palo Alto we bestow up
| r«n ppp] Ptaniford, the Chaparral we
sra'it to Hip Levy, and to Jim Bennett
'••r ipqv" tbe Sefuoia, with full confi
r*erc° in th<* abilities of these our
chosen editors.
The Student Body we consign to the
safe guidance of Skin Wilson, con

vinced ot his ability to run things,
and to defend from transbay accusa
tions and attacks its rights and dig
nities. And to Earl Charles, Squire
Bahrens, do we bequeath the keeping
of the Student Body's moneys, trust
ing that all his future operations will
be financial, and as successful as the
last.
To 1916 we bequeath the Sombrero,
with all of respect, dignity, and Stu
dent Body authority that go therewith.
To 1917 we grant the right to garb
themselves in corduroy, symbol of up
poiclass rank; and to them we leave
the Plugs (those relics of a custom
near discarded) which shall be only
worn when they have been well crum
pled in the .rush.
And from the wearing of the Fresh
man cap do we release 1918, giving to
them instead the cardinal hat, and
furthermore appoint them guardians
of the infant nineteen, and leave to
them its proper introduction to the
campus.
To every member of this commu
nity, from honored President to hum
ble frosh, do we bequeath the Stan
ford Union and the Woman's Club
House, for every meeting, formal or
informal, where democratic comrade
ship may be preserved and fostered,
and faculty and students meet on com
mon ground. And to the campus too
we leave, ringing again the chimes,
not less beautiful from nine years of
silenie; and a flag as well that floats
on gala days beside the Stars and
Stripes.
I hese all, our dear possessions, we
bequeath to the aforesaid beneficiaries
ibfolutely and without reserve, as is
fitting in a body near its end; but
though our course here is nearly run,
some things we cannot leave, so much
are they a part of us. These we take
with us as we go, knowing our taking
leaves but the more behind.
So what of work and play we have
had here, we take the memory, and
give a promise to cherish it; and
what we have learned, in and out of
classes, and in and out of books, of
appreciation of what is fair and true,
of strength and comradeship in right,
of ideals and abilities in action, of
that something we call the Stanford
Spirit, we cannot leave behind us. but
in the taking share with those who
stay, and so rather enrich than rob
1 the whole.
Intermingled and inextricably linked
with this will be the memories of the
Campus we are leaving, of Moorish
arches "where the red tiles rim the
blue, and of the men and women here
that we have come to know, and profit
by the knowing: President and Chan
cellor and Faculty. But of our Presi
dent we grieve to say it is beyond our
nower to grant him over to succeed
ing generations. To him especially
we pledge our lasting honor and af
i fection.
Thus having disposed of all our
earthly and spiritual possessions, and
looking forward to the hour when we
depart, in testimony of this our will
we hereby set our hand and seal, this
fourteenth day of May 1915.
(Signed and Sealed)
