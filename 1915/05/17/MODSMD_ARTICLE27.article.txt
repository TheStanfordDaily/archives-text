# CROWDS AND NICKELS MIX JUBILANTLY AT CARNIVAL
## THREATENED RAINSTORM DRIVES SHOWS UNDER COVER Union House Take Place of Traditional Pike on Row. —Dance Holds Late. 
### 
On about the fortieth day the
waters receded from the face of the
earth, and made way for the 1915
Senior Carnival. For the first time in
many years, the annual Pike on the
Row lay lonely, silent of barkers' slo
gans, barren of red fi.re and funny pa
;>er, and obscured in the absence of
electric bulbs. The way of the
pleasure pilgrims lead to new shrines
of fun in the Union ana Clubhouse,
where the joy palaces had been housed
in fear of continued rain.
Some of us may have wished for the
open air dime grabbers of past years,
canvas show tents, and the feel of
soft lawn underfoot. After the fi.rst
plunge into the whirl of indoor sports
things happened too fast to allow one
to linger with Homer in the good old
days.
Let's take a chance at the Club
house. "Buy your ti-i-kets. Good for
all the shows in the house. Here, for
the sake o' the Belgians make it a
half dollar's worth." Now follow
along and watch them take your
money.
Tnside the Clubhouse the amusement
was served up by a well-attended
nickel dance, and an enterprising con
cert of Hawaiian stringed instrument
music. The dance offered good value,
and the concert provided by a dozen
"like" and guitar artists was pleasing,
though the "alluring hoola-a-" girls
failed to do their turn. A gaming
table for the benelt of the "On to
Poughkeepsie" boys, a wheel of for
tune, and a candy booth filled the ave
nues of escape.
Over in the Union, across the
meadow, they ran a vodeville perform
ance. It took your whole string of
tickets to get you and her past the
door, and by the time you were seated
you had memorized the old saw that
"a thorn by any other name sticks
just as deep." But it was an honest
and true show. Eight or nine acts
ran the gamut of Junior Opera selec
tions, duelling, and human statuary,—
there was a game of tiddledewinks go
ing on behind the scenes.
