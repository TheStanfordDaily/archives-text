# BISHOP NICHOLS ENJOINS PREPARATION FOR LIVING
## CHARACTER IS MADE BY EFFORT, NOT INSPIRATION, WARNS ELOQUENT DIVINE "COPY, CULTIVATE CHRIST" Symbolism of New Class Plate Is Figurative Thread of Baccalaureate Sermon. 
### 
Bishop William F. Nichols, D. D.,
delivered an inspiring address at the
Baccalaureate services Sunday morn
ing. A brief of the sermon follows:
"The judgment seat in the place
that is called the pavement."â€”St.
John 19:13.
The plate of the class of 1915 has
been happily placed at the church
porch. The alchemy of university
comradeship transmutes its very
bronze into the most precious metal
of memory of the being together here,
('lass Day has well voiced that senti
ment. But its nearness to the doo.r
of the sanctuary is noteworthy too.
And Class Day may throw over this
Baccalaureate Day some of its fervor
if we can fix a plate thought or two
here.
In the old Roman tribunals the seat
of judgment was called the Pavement,
just as we speak of the Bench or the
Ermine. The mosaic on which the
curule or chair stood was made a
mark of the judiciary. It was some
times portable and Julius Caesar car
ried such a Pavement with him for
formal adjudications on his cam
paigns. The significance then in my
text is plain. It marked the authori
zation act of Pilate in passing his
judgment upon Christ. The only an
alogy from it I have in mind here is
that it was a Pavement of Decision,
and the case before it was the case
of Christ. For there is a very real
sense in which that class plate in the
mosaic of the cloister so suggestively
close to the threshold of worship pre
sents the case of Christ to ingenuous
youth. If there is little or nothing in
common with the conditions of the
case as it was before Pilate, there is
hanging in the balance the issue clear
if not pressing as to whether or not
Christ shall be the animating ideal,
the master, the hero for our buoyant
hero worship in life. Most of us have,
consciously or unconsciously, our
working theories for the try-out of
what we mean or hope to be and do.
Some get them from maxims and some
from master influence. But few can
live upon epigrams, and smart sayings
in the long run need the backing of
personal worth, and so it is generally
the hero rather than the heroic which
prevails. Now the case of Christ
hinges on our clearly-cut aspiration
to choose nothing short of T-Tis Person
as our shaping example, to take Him
fnr the true "Superman," to settle
once for all that we shall aim at "the
fullness of Christ."
The worth-while life consists in the
finish we can put upon character.
That, I submit, is the chief thing in
your outlook todav. You are apprais
ing l'fe values, and have some sort of
life standards dawning if not draw
ing upon you. Seek the best. Keep
to the best. The plate tells a story
of your aims here and your culture
here as a class. The years to come
will intensify aims and culture more
as individuals. Copy Christ. Cultivate
Christ. That is the truest measure of
manhood and of womanhood. Tt. means
downright, thorough, alprt application
to character finish. Tt. does not come
of itself. Professor of Clark
University in a recent address quotes
Tennyson as having said, when some
admirer expressed delight, over the
perfection and inevitability of one of
his lines, adding that he knew It was
a pure stroke of inspiration. "Well, I
smoked pipes over that line."
And the lure of the Christ will be like
that which led St Oaudons on and on
as in his creation of the statue of Phil
lips Brooks his studies carried him
from a pure artistic interest into full
hearted acceptance of the Master into
his life.
