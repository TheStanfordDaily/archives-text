# ALUMNI OF EARLY AND RECENT YEARS JOIN IN PLEASURES OF BIGGEST COMMENCEMENT
## 
### 
They came, they saw, they con
quered, Saturday, these alumni of
whom we have heard so much. They
came to the Campus which was the
scene of their undergraduate days,
they saw the old familiar haunts,
keepers of countless secrets, and they
conquered instantly the hearts of the
Faculty and students who had re
mained to b'd them a welcome to the
Stanford Farm. The year of the Fair,
and the fact that '95, the pioneer class,
was celebrating its twentieth birth
day, cast an important glamour over
the occasion, and all of the twenty
three associations of graduates united
in good fellowship to commemorate
the day.
Graduates vs. Professors
Those of the Campus community
who were brave enough to get up at
9 a.m. witnessed the first event of the
day, the Faculty-Alumni baseball
game on the Faculty diamond. And
the fans saw one of the most hotly
contested games of indoor baseball
ever played in the quiet open air.
The game was called by Hon. John
E. .McDowell, who doffed his gleaming
straw hat to the assemblage and an
nounced the batteris as Whitaker and
Merino for the "Profs" and Trow
bridge, '05, and Presley, '07, for the
grads. The heavy stickwork "which
distinguished .the game throughout"
started in the first half of the initial
inning. The teaching staff won the
toss, and Merino stepped confidently
up to the plate. He looked to be a
very substantial player and received
a walk from the veteran Trowbridge,
who used bis head to advantage dur
ing the entire six innings. Maloney
made some pretty fencing passes and
fanned. Dr. Angell hopped to first on
Presley's error, and stole second on
Stubby Stolz's hit—and how lie did
steal third. His path was marked by
a continuous cloud of dust and he hit
into second like a bullet in full flight.
The "grand old man" reached third on
Mosher's safety, and beat it home on
Garfias' error. The husky third saek
er forgot to keep his knees together
and the elusive pill dove through,
netting the Faculty one run.
The Alumni stars came back in true
style. Presley reached third on Ma
lonev's error. Trowbridge bunted, ad
vancing Presley across the plate, and
.reaching home finally on Merino's
error.
Chancellor Jordan occupied the um
pire's easy chair at the beginning of
the second inning, receiving a hearty
ovation as he crossed the diamond.
He made his presence felt, by the num
ber of strikes called. Herman Rittig
stein played an interesting game of
hide and seek with Angell between
first and second. Herman attempted
a double steal on Barrett's strike, and
was pursued by the wily doctor. Tt
developed into a speed exhibition, and
the doctor won, tagging out the un
lucky Herman within a hair's breadth
of the sack.

Tom Gregory fanned out about the
beginning of the third inning, and be
seated himself on a sumptuous divan
subtracted from a sleepy outfielder.
The infield began to assume the ap
pearance of a barricaded fort. Ma
loney fanned again, Angell rounding
the liases on a "bile" just to show he
had some of the old stuff left. In the
, last half Bealt connected for a beauti
i fill hit, but fell flat at home because
I of "too much anxiety."
The Faculty raised Cain in the
fourth. Murray, Ponzer, and Marx all
registered safeties, and the bases were
full up. Whitaker banged a healthy
1 one over left field, and brought across
| two tallies. A succession of perfectly
j executed errors looked like four more
1 tor the Faculty, but it finally devel
-1 oped that Marx had been tagged out
in the midst of the melee. The Grads'
part of the Fourth brought out some
pretty work. Trowbridge was hurt
(?» by a pitched ball which he grace
fully allowed to roll off his leg, and
i took first on Jordan's geenrosity. He
1 crossed the plate a moment later on
Brua's hit. Rich was up next, and
i hit the ball with his head instead of
the bat, taking first on the umpire's
i kindness of heart. He stole second
during a momentary lull and finally
went through the pitcher's box for a
short cut to the home plate.
J The fifth inning netted the Faculty
two tallies. Mosher allowed himself
to be hit by the pitcher and took first.
Stolz reached first. Ponzer lined out
a single, and the bases were full. Gar
fias through Mosher out at home with
a pretty peg. Marx banged out a safe
ty, Stolz scoring on Presley's fumble
of Garflas' throw. Whitaker hit to
Garfias, who threw to the home plate
for the third consecutive time with
no one past second base. Merino
lined out a hit and Ponzer scored.
The Alumni came back In the last
half, Mosher pitching for the Faculty.
Rittigstein was safe on first, reached
second on Merino's error, and stole
third. The witty little fielder romped
home, accomplishing a sensational
slide for the fourth sco.re of the Alum
ni. The sixth and last inning brought
nothing to the Faculty. The Grads
tied up the score in the last half when
Brua hit, advanced to second, and
came home on Maloney's error. Score,
5-5.
j Both sides ended up with the appe
tizing yell:
Cigars, Cigars, Cigarettes, Beer.
Faculty, Faculty, We're right here.
The teams lined up as follows:
Faculty—Merino, c; Maloney. 1b;
Angell, ss; Stolz, 3b; Mosher. ss; Mur

Election of Officers
The annual business meeting occu
pied the attention of the Alumni As
sociation at 11:30. Leland W. Cutler.
'Ofi, of San Francisco, was elected
president for the ensuing year; Miss
E. Wright, 'Ofi, vice-president: ,T. E.
McDowell, '99: secretary-treasurer, C.
M. Bradley), '02, chairman Executive
Committee; B. W. Orandall, '07, F. L.
Guerena. '11. and R. W. Wilcox, '13,
members of the Executive Committee;
G. D. Boalt. '03. E. G. Brua, '04. and
W. R. Hamilton, '02, members of the
Advisory Board.
The Crowd Eats
The Stanford private grounds served
as the next setting for the alumni fes
tivities. Tinder the picturesque elms
and maples, the visitors were treated
to the daintiest assortment of viands
ever served up to a Stanford gather
ing. Chicken, spaghetti, stemmed
strawberries, maple parfait and cake
were on the menu, which was enjoyed
by about seven hundred people.* A
brief program of speeches preceded
the play.
Second Outdoor Success
At three o'clock the curtain went up
(figuratively speaking) on "23," the
much heralded Alumni Pageant-
Masque and Mystery Play. The scene

disclosed Professor Woodward, dis
guised as The Assistant Registrar
himself, in the act of preparing ior
this very show. Woodward was bald
headed pro tem, and carried with ease
and majesty the proverbial straw hat.
In a witty, rapid-fire monologue, the
lawyer rehearsed the trials and trou
bles of the promoter of the vast enter
prise, who "left just fifteen minutes in
which to coach his cast." The whole
situation might be summed up in the
pathetic lament, ' Everybody intended
to do it, but nobody did." And so he
named it—The Alumni Paving Asso
ciation, Ltd.
The next skit was named "In the
Good Old Uncle John Days." The
character of the old bus driver was
fa'thfully portrayed, and his guiding
powers were certainly good. C. K.
Field, '95, acted the part of the tour
ist, arid during the course of the play
let a number of his earliest attempts
were recited. The one most heartily
applauded rcns as follows:
As a man in flight
From a fire at night
With nothing but the clothes he
sleeps in.
So am I hurled
Tnto the world
With nothing on but a sheep
skin.
The concluding skit was modelled
on the miracle-mystery Everyman
order, and dealt with the Teachers'
course and the quickest way for the
new arrival from the glorious high
school to tread the flunk-out route.
Landscape Gardeners
After the play the merry-makers
proceeded to the Quad to participate
in the tree and ivy planting. The first
cicrht classes, '92-'9S, gathered in the
Inner Quad, and planted ivy in six
positions. The remaining graduates
from the '00-'l5 classes planted trees
in the enclosure between the two club
houses. At the conclusion of each
planting the classes gave their orig
inal yells, and then dispersed at 5:30
to attend the class dinners.
The Classes Dine
The reunions were well patronized,
and at each one the friends of long
ago re-assembled and talked over the
good old days. Dinners were served
at the following places: '92. '93. '94.
'95, '9S, Eating Clubs; '9fi, '97, Wom
en's Club House; '99, '07, .T. E. Mc-
Dowell's residence: '00, '03, '05, '06.

'04, Delta Gamma house: '10, '11, pic

'13. Chi Psi house: '14. barbecue at
the Faculty Clubhouse.
The newly elected members of the
Phi Beta Kappa fraternity were ini
t'ated and tendered a banquet at the
Women's Clubhouse, at 5:30 p.m.
The last event on the program of
the day v&,is the Alumni-Senior recep
tion. This soon resolved itself into a
delisilitfn 1 informal dance, and the last
hours of Alumni Day were whiled
away to the sound of the latest melo
dies.
Numbers of alumni and members of
the Faculty contributed time and
money to the enterprise, but after all
the credit for the affair belongs to
Assistant Registrar J. E. McDowell.

They came, they saw, they con

whom we have heard so much. They
came to the Campus which was the
scene of their undergraduate days,
they saw the old familiar haunts,
keepers of countless secrets, and they
conquered instantly the hearts of the
Faculty and students who had re
mained to b'd them a welcome to the
Stanford Farm. The year of the Fair,
and the fact that '95, the pioneer class,
was celebrating its twentieth birth
day, cast an important glamour over
the occasion, and all of the twenty
three associations of graduates united
in good fellowship to commemorate
the day.
Graduates vs. Professors
Those of the Campus community
who were brave enough to get up at
9 a.m. witnessed the first event of the
day, the Faculty-Alumni baseball
game on the Faculty diamond. And
the fans saw one of the most hotly
contested games of indoor baseball
ever played in the quiet open air.
The game was called by Hon. John
E. .McDowell, who doffed his gleaming
straw hat to the assemblage and an
nounced the batteris as Whitaker and
Merino for the "Profs" and Trow
bridge, '05, and Presley, '07, for the
grads. The heavy stickwork "which
distinguished .the game throughout"
started in the first half of the initial
inning. The teaching staff won the
toss, and Merino stepped confidently
up to the plate. He looked to be a
very substantial player and received
a walk from the veteran Trowbridge,
who used bis head to advantage dur
ing the entire six innings. Maloney
made some pretty fencing passes and
fanned. Dr. Angell hopped to first on
Presley's error, and stole second on
Stubby Stolz's hit—and how lie did
steal third. His path was marked by
a continuous cloud of dust and he hit
into second like a bullet in full flight.
The "grand old man" reached third on
Mosher's safety, and beat it home on
Garfias' error. The husky third saek
er forgot to keep his knees together
and the elusive pill dove through,
netting the Faculty one run.
The Alumni stars came back in true
style. Presley reached third on Ma
lonev's error. Trowbridge bunted, ad
vancing Presley across the plate, and
.reaching home finally on Merino's
error.
Chancellor Jordan occupied the um
pire's easy chair at the beginning of
the second inning, receiving a hearty
ovation as he crossed the diamond.
He made his presence felt, by the num
ber of strikes called. Herman Rittig
stein played an interesting game of
hide and seek with Angell between
first and second. Herman attempted
a double steal on Barrett's strike, and
was pursued by the wily doctor. Tt
developed into a speed exhibition, and
the doctor won, tagging out the un
lucky Herman within a hair's breadth
of the sack.

Tom Gregory fanned out about the
beginning of the third inning, and be
seated himself on a sumptuous divan
subtracted from a sleepy outfielder.
The infield began to assume the ap
pearance of a barricaded fort. Ma
loney fanned again, Angell rounding
the liases on a "bile" just to show he
had some of the old stuff left. In the
, last half Bealt connected for a beauti
i fill hit, but fell flat at home because
I of "too much anxiety."
The Faculty raised Cain in the
fourth. Murray, Ponzer, and Marx all
registered safeties, and the bases were
full up. Whitaker banged a healthy
1 one over left field, and brought across
| two tallies. A succession of perfectly
j executed errors looked like four more
1 tor the Faculty, but it finally devel
-1 oped that Marx had been tagged out
in the midst of the melee. The Grads'
part of the Fourth brought out some
pretty work. Trowbridge was hurt
(?» by a pitched ball which he grace
fully allowed to roll off his leg, and
i took first on Jordan's geenrosity. He
1 crossed the plate a moment later on
Brua's hit. Rich was up next, and
i hit the ball with his head instead of
the bat, taking first on the umpire's
i kindness of heart. He stole second
during a momentary lull and finally
went through the pitcher's box for a
short cut to the home plate.
J The fifth inning netted the Faculty
two tallies. Mosher allowed himself
to be hit by the pitcher and took first.
Stolz reached first. Ponzer lined out
a single, and the bases were full. Gar
fias through Mosher out at home with
a pretty peg. Marx banged out a safe
ty, Stolz scoring on Presley's fumble
of Garflas' throw. Whitaker hit to
Garfias, who threw to the home plate
for the third consecutive time with
no one past second base. Merino
lined out a hit and Ponzer scored.
The Alumni came back In the last
half, Mosher pitching for the Faculty.
Rittigstein was safe on first, reached
second on Merino's error, and stole
third. The witty little fielder romped
home, accomplishing a sensational
slide for the fourth sco.re of the Alum
ni. The sixth and last inning brought
nothing to the Faculty. The Grads
tied up the score in the last half when
Brua hit, advanced to second, and
came home on Maloney's error. Score,
5-5.
j Both sides ended up with the appe
tizing yell:
Cigars, Cigars, Cigarettes, Beer.
Faculty, Faculty, We're right here.
The teams lined up as follows:

Election of Officers

pied the attention of the Alumni As
sociation at 11:30. Leland W. Cutler.

president for the ensuing year; Miss
E. Wright, 'Ofi, vice-president: ,T. E.

The Crowd Eats
The Stanford private grounds served
as the next setting for the alumni fes
tivities. Tinder the picturesque elms
and maples, the visitors were treated
to the daintiest assortment of viands
ever served up to a Stanford gather
ing. Chicken, spaghetti, stemmed
strawberries, maple parfait and cake
were on the menu, which was enjoyed
by about seven hundred people.* A
brief program of speeches preceded
the play.
Second Outdoor Success
At three o'clock the curtain went up
(figuratively speaking) on "23," the
much heralded Alumni Pageant-
Masque and Mystery Play. The scene

disclosed Professor Woodward, dis
guised as The Assistant Registrar
himself, in the act of preparing ior
this very show. Woodward was bald
headed pro tem, and carried with ease
and majesty the proverbial straw hat.
In a witty, rapid-fire monologue, the
lawyer rehearsed the trials and trou
bles of the promoter of the vast enter
prise, who "left just fifteen minutes in
which to coach his cast." The whole
situation might be summed up in the
pathetic lament, ' Everybody intended
to do it, but nobody did." And so he
named it—The Alumni Paving Asso
ciation, Ltd.
The next skit was named "In the
Good Old Uncle John Days." The
character of the old bus driver was
fa'thfully portrayed, and his guiding
powers were certainly good. C. K.
Field, '95, acted the part of the tour
ist, arid during the course of the play
let a number of his earliest attempts
were recited. The one most heartily
applauded rcns as follows:
As a man in flight
From a fire at night
With nothing but the clothes he
sleeps in.
So am I hurled
Tnto the world
With nothing on but a sheep
skin.
The concluding skit was modelled
on the miracle-mystery Everyman
order, and dealt with the Teachers'
course and the quickest way for the
new arrival from the glorious high
school to tread the flunk-out route.
Landscape Gardeners
After the play the merry-makers
proceeded to the Quad to participate
in the tree and ivy planting. The first
cicrht classes, '92-'9S, gathered in the
Inner Quad, and planted ivy in six
positions. The remaining graduates
from the '00-'l5 classes planted trees
in the enclosure between the two club
houses. At the conclusion of each
planting the classes gave their orig
inal yells, and then dispersed at 5:30
to attend the class dinners.
The Classes Dine
The reunions were well patronized,
and at each one the friends of long
ago re-assembled and talked over the
good old days. Dinners were served
at the following places: '92. '93. '94.
'95, '9S, Eating Clubs; '9fi, '97, Wom

ist, arid during the course of the play
let a number of his earliest attempts
were recited. The one most heartily
applauded rcns as follows:
As a man in flight
From a fire at night
With nothing but the clothes he
sleeps in.
So am I hurled
Tnto the world
With nothing on but a sheep
skin.
The concluding skit was modelled
on the miracle-mystery Everyman
order, and dealt with the Teachers'
course and the quickest way for the
new arrival from the glorious high
school to tread the flunk-out route.
Landscape Gardeners
After the play the merry-makers
proceeded to the Quad to participate
in the tree and ivy planting. The first
cicrht classes, '92-'9S, gathered in the
Inner Quad, and planted ivy in six
positions. The remaining graduates
from the '00-'l5 classes planted trees
in the enclosure between the two club
houses. At the conclusion of each
planting the classes gave their orig
inal yells, and then dispersed at 5:30
to attend the class dinners.
The Classes Dine
The reunions were well patronized,
and at each one the friends of long
ago re-assembled and talked over the
good old days. Dinners were served
at the following places: '92. '93. '94.
'95, '9S, Eating Clubs; '9fi, '97, Wom
en's Club House; '99, '07, .T. E. Mc-
Dowell's residence: '00, '03, '05, '06.

Women's Clubhouse, at 5:30 p.m.
The last event on the program of

day ran off smoothly and was pro
nouned by all present to have been an
unqualified success.
They came, they saw, they con
quered, Saturday, these alumni of
whom we have heard so much. They
came to the Campus which was the
scene of their undergraduate days,
they saw the old familiar haunts,
keepers of countless secrets, and they
conquered instantly the hearts of the
Faculty and students who had re
mained to b'd them a welcome to the
Stanford Farm. The year of the Fair,
and the fact that '95, the pioneer class,
was celebrating its twentieth birth
day, cast an important glamour over
the occasion, and all of the twenty
three associations of graduates united
in good fellowship to commemorate
the day.
Graduates vs. Professors
Those of the Campus community
who were brave enough to get up at
9 a.m. witnessed the first event of the
day, the Faculty-Alumni baseball
game on the Faculty diamond. And
the fans saw one of the most hotly
contested games of indoor baseball
ever played in the quiet open air.
The game was called by Hon. John
E. .McDowell, who doffed his gleaming
straw hat to the assemblage and an
nounced the batteris as Whitaker and
Merino for the "Profs" and Trow
bridge, '05, and Presley, '07, for the
grads. The heavy stickwork "which
distinguished .the game throughout"
started in the first half of the initial
inning. The teaching staff won the
toss, and Merino stepped confidently
up to the plate. He looked to be a
very substantial player and received
a walk from the veteran Trowbridge,
who used bis head to advantage dur
ing the entire six innings. Maloney
made some pretty fencing passes and
fanned. Dr. Angell hopped to first on
Presley's error, and stole second on
Stubby Stolz's hit—and how lie did
steal third. His path was marked by
a continuous cloud of dust and he hit
into second like a bullet in full flight.
The "grand old man" reached third on
Mosher's safety, and beat it home on
Garfias' error. The husky third saek
er forgot to keep his knees together
and the elusive pill dove through,
netting the Faculty one run.
The Alumni stars came back in true
style. Presley reached third on Ma
lonev's error. Trowbridge bunted, ad
vancing Presley across the plate, and
.reaching home finally on Merino's
error.
Chancellor Jordan occupied the um
pire's easy chair at the beginning of
the second inning, receiving a hearty
ovation as he crossed the diamond.
He made his presence felt, by the num
ber of strikes called. Herman Rittig
stein played an interesting game of
hide and seek with Angell between
first and second. Herman attempted
a double steal on Barrett's strike, and
was pursued by the wily doctor. Tt
developed into a speed exhibition, and
the doctor won, tagging out the un
lucky Herman within a hair's breadth
of the sack.

Tom Gregory fanned out about the
beginning of the third inning, and be
seated himself on a sumptuous divan
subtracted from a sleepy outfielder.
The infield began to assume the ap
pearance of a barricaded fort. Ma
loney fanned again, Angell rounding
the liases on a "bile" just to show he
had some of the old stuff left. In the
, last half Bealt connected for a beauti
i fill hit, but fell flat at home because
I of "too much anxiety."
The Faculty raised Cain in the
fourth. Murray, Ponzer, and Marx all
registered safeties, and the bases were
full up. Whitaker banged a healthy
1 one over left field, and brought across
| two tallies. A succession of perfectly
j executed errors looked like four more
1 tor the Faculty, but it finally devel
-1 oped that Marx had been tagged out
in the midst of the melee. The Grads'
part of the Fourth brought out some
pretty work. Trowbridge was hurt
(?» by a pitched ball which he grace
fully allowed to roll off his leg, and
i took first on Jordan's geenrosity. He
1 crossed the plate a moment later on
Brua's hit. Rich was up next, and
i hit the ball with his head instead of
the bat, taking first on the umpire's
i kindness of heart. He stole second
during a momentary lull and finally
went through the pitcher's box for a
short cut to the home plate.
J The fifth inning netted the Faculty
two tallies. Mosher allowed himself
to be hit by the pitcher and took first.
Stolz reached first. Ponzer lined out
a single, and the bases were full. Gar
fias through Mosher out at home with
a pretty peg. Marx banged out a safe
ty, Stolz scoring on Presley's fumble
of Garflas' throw. Whitaker hit to
Garfias, who threw to the home plate
for the third consecutive time with
no one past second base. Merino
lined out a hit and Ponzer scored.
The Alumni came back In the last
half, Mosher pitching for the Faculty.
Rittigstein was safe on first, reached
second on Merino's error, and stole
third. The witty little fielder romped
home, accomplishing a sensational
slide for the fourth sco.re of the Alum
ni. The sixth and last inning brought
nothing to the Faculty. The Grads
tied up the score in the last half when
Brua hit, advanced to second, and
came home on Maloney's error. Score,
5-5.
j Both sides ended up with the appe
tizing yell:
Cigars, Cigars, Cigarettes, Beer.
Faculty, Faculty, We're right here.
The teams lined up as follows:

The Crowd Eats
The Stanford private grounds served
as the next setting for the alumni fes
tivities. Tinder the picturesque elms
and maples, the visitors were treated
to the daintiest assortment of viands
ever served up to a Stanford gather
ing. Chicken, spaghetti, stemmed
strawberries, maple parfait and cake
were on the menu, which was enjoyed
by about seven hundred people.* A
brief program of speeches preceded
the play.
Second Outdoor Success
At three o'clock the curtain went up
(figuratively speaking) on "23," the
much heralded Alumni Pageant-
Masque and Mystery Play. The scene

disclosed Professor Woodward, dis
guised as The Assistant Registrar
himself, in the act of preparing ior
this very show. Woodward was bald
headed pro tem, and carried with ease
and majesty the proverbial straw hat.
In a witty, rapid-fire monologue, the
lawyer rehearsed the trials and trou
bles of the promoter of the vast enter
prise, who "left just fifteen minutes in
which to coach his cast." The whole
situation might be summed up in the
pathetic lament, ' Everybody intended
to do it, but nobody did." And so he
named it—The Alumni Paving Asso
ciation, Ltd.
The next skit was named "In the
Good Old Uncle John Days." The
character of the old bus driver was
fa'thfully portrayed, and his guiding
powers were certainly good. C. K.
Field, '95, acted the part of the tour
ist, arid during the course of the play
let a number of his earliest attempts

and maples, the visitors were treated
to the daintiest assortment of viands
ever served up to a Stanford gather
ing. Chicken, spaghetti, stemmed
strawberries, maple parfait and cake
were on the menu, which was enjoyed
by about seven hundred people.* A
brief program of speeches preceded
the play.
Second Outdoor Success
At three o'clock the curtain went up
(figuratively speaking) on "23," the
much heralded Alumni Pageant-
Masque and Mystery Play. The scene

disclosed Professor Woodward, dis
guised as The Assistant Registrar
himself, in the act of preparing ior
this very show. Woodward was bald
headed pro tem, and carried with ease
and majesty the proverbial straw hat.
In a witty, rapid-fire monologue, the
lawyer rehearsed the trials and trou
bles of the promoter of the vast enter
prise, who "left just fifteen minutes in
which to coach his cast." The whole
situation might be summed up in the
pathetic lament, ' Everybody intended
to do it, but nobody did." And so he
named it—The Alumni Paving Asso
ciation, Ltd.
The next skit was named "In the
Good Old Uncle John Days." The
character of the old bus driver was
fa'thfully portrayed, and his guiding
powers were certainly good. C. K.
Field, '95, acted the part of the tour
ist, arid during the course of the play
let a number of his earliest attempts
were recited. The one most heartily
applauded rcns as follows:
As a man in flight
From a fire at night
With nothing but the clothes he
sleeps in.
So am I hurled
Tnto the world
With nothing on but a sheep
skin.
The concluding skit was modelled
on the miracle-mystery Everyman
order, and dealt with the Teachers'
course and the quickest way for the
new arrival from the glorious high
school to tread the flunk-out route.
Landscape Gardeners
After the play the merry-makers
proceeded to the Quad to participate
in the tree and ivy planting. The first
cicrht classes, '92-'9S, gathered in the
Inner Quad, and planted ivy in six
positions. The remaining graduates
from the '00-'l5 classes planted trees
in the enclosure between the two club
houses. At the conclusion of each
planting the classes gave their orig
inal yells, and then dispersed at 5:30
to attend the class dinners.
The Classes Dine
The reunions were well patronized,
and at each one the friends of long
ago re-assembled and talked over the
good old days. Dinners were served
at the following places: '92. '93. '94.
'95, '9S, Eating Clubs; '9fi, '97, Wom
en's Club House; '99, '07, .T. E. Mc-
Dowell's residence: '00, '03, '05, '06.

Women's Clubhouse, at 5:30 p.m.
The last event on the program of
the day v&,is the Alumni-Senior recep

day ran off smoothly and was pro
nouned by all present to have been an
unqualified success.
They came, they saw, they con
quered, Saturday, these alumni of
whom we have heard so much. They
came to the Campus which was the
scene of their undergraduate days,
they saw the old familiar haunts,
keepers of countless secrets, and they
conquered instantly the hearts of the
Faculty and students who had re
mained to b'd them a welcome to the
Stanford Farm. The year of the Fair,
and the fact that '95, the pioneer class,
was celebrating its twentieth birth
day, cast an important glamour over
the occasion, and all of the twenty
three associations of graduates united
in good fellowship to commemorate
the day.
Graduates vs. Professors
Those of the Campus community
who were brave enough to get up at
9 a.m. witnessed the first event of the
day, the Faculty-Alumni baseball
game on the Faculty diamond. And
the fans saw one of the most hotly
contested games of indoor baseball
ever played in the quiet open air.
The game was called by Hon. John
E. .McDowell, who doffed his gleaming
straw hat to the assemblage and an
nounced the batteris as Whitaker and
Merino for the "Profs" and Trow
bridge, '05, and Presley, '07, for the
grads. The heavy stickwork "which
distinguished .the game throughout"
started in the first half of the initial
inning. The teaching staff won the
toss, and Merino stepped confidently
up to the plate. He looked to be a
very substantial player and received
a walk from the veteran Trowbridge,
who used bis head to advantage dur
ing the entire six innings. Maloney
made some pretty fencing passes and
fanned. Dr. Angell hopped to first on
Presley's error, and stole second on
Stubby Stolz's hit—and how lie did
steal third. His path was marked by
a continuous cloud of dust and he hit
into second like a bullet in full flight.
The "grand old man" reached third on
Mosher's safety, and beat it home on
Garfias' error. The husky third saek
er forgot to keep his knees together
and the elusive pill dove through,
netting the Faculty one run.
The Alumni stars came back in true
style. Presley reached third on Ma
lonev's error. Trowbridge bunted, ad
vancing Presley across the plate, and
.reaching home finally on Merino's
error.
Chancellor Jordan occupied the um
pire's easy chair at the beginning of
the second inning, receiving a hearty
ovation as he crossed the diamond.
He made his presence felt, by the num
ber of strikes called. Herman Rittig
stein played an interesting game of
hide and seek with Angell between
first and second. Herman attempted
a double steal on Barrett's strike, and
was pursued by the wily doctor. Tt
developed into a speed exhibition, and
the doctor won, tagging out the un
lucky Herman within a hair's breadth
of the sack.

Tom Gregory fanned out about the
beginning of the third inning, and be
seated himself on a sumptuous divan
subtracted from a sleepy outfielder.
The infield began to assume the ap
pearance of a barricaded fort. Ma
loney fanned again, Angell rounding
the liases on a "bile" just to show he
had some of the old stuff left. In the
, last half Bealt connected for a beauti
i fill hit, but fell flat at home because
I of "too much anxiety."
The Faculty raised Cain in the
fourth. Murray, Ponzer, and Marx all
registered safeties, and the bases were
full up. Whitaker banged a healthy
1 one over left field, and brought across
| two tallies. A succession of perfectly
j executed errors looked like four more
1 tor the Faculty, but it finally devel
-1 oped that Marx had been tagged out
in the midst of the melee. The Grads'
part of the Fourth brought out some
pretty work. Trowbridge was hurt
(?» by a pitched ball which he grace
fully allowed to roll off his leg, and
i took first on Jordan's geenrosity. He
1 crossed the plate a moment later on
Brua's hit. Rich was up next, and
i hit the ball with his head instead of
the bat, taking first on the umpire's
i kindness of heart. He stole second
during a momentary lull and finally
went through the pitcher's box for a
short cut to the home plate.
J The fifth inning netted the Faculty
two tallies. Mosher allowed himself
to be hit by the pitcher and took first.
Stolz reached first. Ponzer lined out
a single, and the bases were full. Gar
fias through Mosher out at home with
a pretty peg. Marx banged out a safe
ty, Stolz scoring on Presley's fumble
of Garflas' throw. Whitaker hit to
Garfias, who threw to the home plate
for the third consecutive time with
no one past second base. Merino
lined out a hit and Ponzer scored.
The Alumni came back In the last
half, Mosher pitching for the Faculty.
Rittigstein was safe on first, reached
second on Merino's error, and stole
third. The witty little fielder romped
home, accomplishing a sensational
slide for the fourth sco.re of the Alum
ni. The sixth and last inning brought
nothing to the Faculty. The Grads
tied up the score in the last half when
Brua hit, advanced to second, and
came home on Maloney's error. Score,
5-5.
j Both sides ended up with the appe
tizing yell:
Cigars, Cigars, Cigarettes, Beer.
Faculty, Faculty, We're right here.

The Crowd Eats
The Stanford private grounds served
as the next setting for the alumni fes
tivities. Tinder the picturesque elms
and maples, the visitors were treated
to the daintiest assortment of viands
ever served up to a Stanford gather
ing. Chicken, spaghetti, stemmed
strawberries, maple parfait and cake
were on the menu, which was enjoyed
by about seven hundred people.* A
brief program of speeches preceded
the play.
Second Outdoor Success
At three o'clock the curtain went up
(figuratively speaking) on "23," the
much heralded Alumni Pageant-
Masque and Mystery Play. The scene

disclosed Professor Woodward, dis
guised as The Assistant Registrar
himself, in the act of preparing ior
this very show. Woodward was bald
headed pro tem, and carried with ease
and majesty the proverbial straw hat.
In a witty, rapid-fire monologue, the
lawyer rehearsed the trials and trou
bles of the promoter of the vast enter
prise, who "left just fifteen minutes in
which to coach his cast." The whole
situation might be summed up in the
pathetic lament, ' Everybody intended
to do it, but nobody did." And so he
named it—The Alumni Paving Asso
ciation, Ltd.
The next skit was named "In the
Good Old Uncle John Days." The
character of the old bus driver was
fa'thfully portrayed, and his guiding
powers were certainly good. C. K.
Field, '95, acted the part of the tour
ist, arid during the course of the play
let a number of his earliest attempts
were recited. The one most heartily
applauded rcns as follows:
As a man in flight
From a fire at night
With nothing but the clothes he
sleeps in.
So am I hurled
Tnto the world
With nothing on but a sheep
skin.
The concluding skit was modelled
on the miracle-mystery Everyman
order, and dealt with the Teachers'
course and the quickest way for the
new arrival from the glorious high
school to tread the flunk-out route.
Landscape Gardeners
After the play the merry-makers
proceeded to the Quad to participate
in the tree and ivy planting. The first
cicrht classes, '92-'9S, gathered in the
Inner Quad, and planted ivy in six
positions. The remaining graduates
from the '00-'l5 classes planted trees
in the enclosure between the two club
houses. At the conclusion of each
planting the classes gave their orig
inal yells, and then dispersed at 5:30
to attend the class dinners.
The Classes Dine
The reunions were well patronized,
and at each one the friends of long
ago re-assembled and talked over the
good old days. Dinners were served
at the following places: '92. '93. '94.
'95, '9S, Eating Clubs; '9fi, '97, Wom
en's Club House; '99, '07, .T. E. Mc-
Dowell's residence: '00, '03, '05, '06.

'13. Chi Psi house: '14. barbecue at
the Faculty Clubhouse.
The newly elected members of the
Phi Beta Kappa fraternity were ini
t'ated and tendered a banquet at the
Women's Clubhouse, at 5:30 p.m.
The last event on the program of
the day v&,is the Alumni-Senior recep
tion. This soon resolved itself into a
delisilitfn 1 informal dance, and the last
hours of Alumni Day were whiled
away to the sound of the latest melo
dies.
Numbers of alumni and members of
the Faculty contributed time and
money to the enterprise, but after all
the credit for the affair belongs to
Assistant Registrar J. E. McDowell.
'99, secretary of the Alumni Associa
tion. Largely through his efforts the
day ran off smoothly and was pro
nouned by all present to have been an
unqualified success.
They came, they saw, they con
quered, Saturday, these alumni of
whom we have heard so much. They
came to the Campus which was the
scene of their undergraduate days,
they saw the old familiar haunts,
keepers of countless secrets, and they
conquered instantly the hearts of the
Faculty and students who had re
mained to b'd them a welcome to the
Stanford Farm. The year of the Fair,
and the fact that '95, the pioneer class,
was celebrating its twentieth birth
day, cast an important glamour over
the occasion, and all of the twenty
three associations of graduates united
in good fellowship to commemorate
the day.
Graduates vs. Professors
Those of the Campus community
who were brave enough to get up at
9 a.m. witnessed the first event of the
day, the Faculty-Alumni baseball
game on the Faculty diamond. And
the fans saw one of the most hotly
contested games of indoor baseball
ever played in the quiet open air.
The game was called by Hon. John
E. .McDowell, who doffed his gleaming
straw hat to the assemblage and an
nounced the batteris as Whitaker and
Merino for the "Profs" and Trow
bridge, '05, and Presley, '07, for the
grads. The heavy stickwork "which
distinguished .the game throughout"
started in the first half of the initial
inning. The teaching staff won the
toss, and Merino stepped confidently
up to the plate. He looked to be a
very substantial player and received
a walk from the veteran Trowbridge,
who used bis head to advantage dur
ing the entire six innings. Maloney
made some pretty fencing passes and
fanned. Dr. Angell hopped to first on
Presley's error, and stole second on
Stubby Stolz's hit—and how lie did
steal third. His path was marked by
a continuous cloud of dust and he hit
into second like a bullet in full flight.
The "grand old man" reached third on
Mosher's safety, and beat it home on
Garfias' error. The husky third saek
er forgot to keep his knees together
and the elusive pill dove through,
netting the Faculty one run.
The Alumni stars came back in true
style. Presley reached third on Ma
lonev's error. Trowbridge bunted, ad
vancing Presley across the plate, and
.reaching home finally on Merino's
error.
Chancellor Jordan occupied the um
pire's easy chair at the beginning of
the second inning, receiving a hearty
ovation as he crossed the diamond.
He made his presence felt, by the num
ber of strikes called. Herman Rittig
stein played an interesting game of
hide and seek with Angell between
first and second. Herman attempted
a double steal on Barrett's strike, and
was pursued by the wily doctor. Tt
developed into a speed exhibition, and
the doctor won, tagging out the un
lucky Herman within a hair's breadth
of the sack.

Tom Gregory fanned out about the
beginning of the third inning, and be
seated himself on a sumptuous divan
subtracted from a sleepy outfielder.
The infield began to assume the ap
pearance of a barricaded fort. Ma
loney fanned again, Angell rounding
the liases on a "bile" just to show he
had some of the old stuff left. In the
, last half Bealt connected for a beauti
i fill hit, but fell flat at home because
I of "too much anxiety."
The Faculty raised Cain in the
fourth. Murray, Ponzer, and Marx all
registered safeties, and the bases were
full up. Whitaker banged a healthy
1 one over left field, and brought across
| two tallies. A succession of perfectly
j executed errors looked like four more
1 tor the Faculty, but it finally devel
-1 oped that Marx had been tagged out
in the midst of the melee. The Grads'
part of the Fourth brought out some
pretty work. Trowbridge was hurt
(?» by a pitched ball which he grace
fully allowed to roll off his leg, and
i took first on Jordan's geenrosity. He
1 crossed the plate a moment later on
Brua's hit. Rich was up next, and
i hit the ball with his head instead of
the bat, taking first on the umpire's
i kindness of heart. He stole second
during a momentary lull and finally
went through the pitcher's box for a
short cut to the home plate.
J The fifth inning netted the Faculty
two tallies. Mosher allowed himself
to be hit by the pitcher and took first.
Stolz reached first. Ponzer lined out
a single, and the bases were full. Gar
fias through Mosher out at home with
a pretty peg. Marx banged out a safe
ty, Stolz scoring on Presley's fumble
of Garflas' throw. Whitaker hit to
Garfias, who threw to the home plate
for the third consecutive time with
no one past second base. Merino
lined out a hit and Ponzer scored.
The Alumni came back In the last
half, Mosher pitching for the Faculty.
Rittigstein was safe on first, reached
second on Merino's error, and stole
third. The witty little fielder romped
home, accomplishing a sensational
slide for the fourth sco.re of the Alum
ni. The sixth and last inning brought
nothing to the Faculty. The Grads
tied up the score in the last half when
Brua hit, advanced to second, and
came home on Maloney's error. Score,
5-5.
j Both sides ended up with the appe
tizing yell:
Cigars, Cigars, Cigarettes, Beer.
Faculty, Faculty, We're right here.
