### 
Judge Benjamin F. Bledsoe, the
first alumnus to address Phi Beta
Kappa, delivered an eloquent address
on "The New Humanism in the Law"
before the open meeting of the society
on May 15. He said in part:
"A recent writer lias asserted that
you and I today have been 'eye wit
nesses of the greatest and most far
reaching revolution that is recorded in
history:—a revolution that has ex
tended throughout all the civilized na
tions of the world —a .revolution
brought about by a truly revolting
cond tion of affairs —untold suffering,
privation and death—yet successfully
waged without the loss of a single life.'
He might have added:—a revolution
in amelioration of the conditions,
rather than cf the rights, of men; a
revolution ethical instead of political;
idealistic rather than material; in aid
of social welfare as opposed to indiv
idual independence and autonomy; a
bloodless revolution in furtherance of
the powers of government!
"It might well be supposed that
what would have been 'just, honora
ble and expedient* in the time of De
mosthenes, or even in the time of
Blackstone, would be equally 'just,
honorable and expedient' today, and
that except for mere details of ad
justment, perhaps, the great body of
the law aimed to .reflect a constant de
sideratum of justice, honor and ex
ped encv, would iteelf remain constant
and inviolable. The difficulty is, how
ever. that though justice, honor and
expediency in the abstract are and
eve.r have been more or less constant
terms, in the concrete they become
variable, just as the actual conditions
of life to which they attach become
and are subject to variations. Human
progress and growth, therefore, along
social, industrial and political lines,
in themselves marking a variance
from conditions nf times past. do. or
at least should, in some similarly sub
stantial degree bring corresponding
progress and growth in the systems of
the law most directly relating thereto.
"Though the face of society is still
set like flint against infractions of the
law, and though, due to.changing con
ditions of life and business and the
ever increasing necessity for the pro
tection of the community from the un
warranted and unsocial acts of the in
dividual. more and more acts are be
ing proscribed, yet it is coming to be
the accepted fact that it is the delin
quent individual himself, and not the
crime committed by him. that men
aces the peace and dignity of the state.
In other words, society is ceasing to
regard crime per se. and is directing
; ts attention to men.
"In this wise it has been discov
ered that preventive measures are of
much greater importance and more far
reaching in their effect on the general
welfare than corrective ones.
"Toward anything which spells for
the ethical uplift of the race, our at
i titude as University men and women
j should not be one of forbearance; it
! should be one of assistance—entyhu
| siastic. whole-hearted, genuine."

Judge Benjamin F. Bledsoe, the
first alumnus to address Phi Beta

on "The New Humanism in the Law"
before the open meeting of the society
on May 15. He said in part:
"A recent writer lias asserted that
you and I today have been 'eye wit
nesses of the greatest and most far
reaching revolution that is recorded in
history:—a revolution that has ex
tended throughout all the civilized na
tions of the world —a .revolution
brought about by a truly revolting
cond tion of affairs —untold suffering,
privation and death—yet successfully
waged without the loss of a single life.'
He might have added:—a revolution
in amelioration of the conditions,
rather than cf the rights, of men; a
revolution ethical instead of political;
idealistic rather than material; in aid
of social welfare as opposed to indiv
idual independence and autonomy; a
bloodless revolution in furtherance of
the powers of government!
"It might well be supposed that
what would have been 'just, honora

mosthenes, or even in the time of
Blackstone, would be equally 'just,
honorable and expedient' today, and
that except for mere details of ad
justment, perhaps, the great body of
the law aimed to .reflect a constant de
sideratum of justice, honor and ex

and inviolable. The difficulty is, how

expediency in the abstract are and
