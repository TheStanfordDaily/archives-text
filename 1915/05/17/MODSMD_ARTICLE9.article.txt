# CHANCELLOR JORDAN TRACES GROWTH OF HUMAN KINSHIP-- RECORDS GREAT LANDMARKS IN CHANGE OF MAN'S PERSPECTIVE
## 
### 
Chancellor David Starr Jordan's ad
dress at the Commencement exercises
this morning takes the title "The

Visionary in
tlistory." The
d e velopment
of humanitar
ian prompt
ings through
the ages of
history re
veals in star
tling manner
the influences
which have

\v< rked for human kinship. Dr. Jor
dan's dccis'on to address the class of
IfM." on a subject which has long been
his intimate study, presented an un
usual and a valuable parting lecture.
That "human nature does not
change" is a half truth only. Human
nature does change very slowly, but
human perspective sometimes very
quickly. In the short course of hu
man history human nature runs in
much the same grooves. In the long
struggling race, the temper of men
may change as all else changes. It is
a matter of survival and selection.
Evan in our own times the angle of
virion is being modified. What was
once in its degree right, because no
thing better was attainable, becomes
hideously wrong when there is a
choice of bette.r things. The rise of
civilization is a movement toward the
best. It means suppression of the
second-best, the substitution of fore
thought and justice for vacillation and
violence. There have been "peace
workers," "visionaries" through all
the ages, and they have labored con
sciously or unconsciously for justice,
for equality, for the sanctity of the
life cf the individual man; this, too,
'ong before either peace or democracy
or the .rights of the individual had
ev.?r been dreamed of. Always the
best men have stood for the best at
tainable, however poor that may have
been, and from time to time there
came to them visions of that far day
when dashes of ideas should take the
place of bodily killinr-, and when all
fear and violence as arguments in
matters political, social, or financial
should vanish from the minds of men.
Xo one has yet written the whole
story of the work for democracy
which means peace, and fo.r peace
wh'ch means democracy. When it is
told with all fullness of detail, it will
be the noblest of human records.

Briefly and roughly, piecing out the
limitations cf knowledge, let us try
to interpret it.
* * *
The story began, let us say, in the
dark ages, the very dark, close to the
beginning of things, it seems to us
now, though things are still in the
beginning. For we are about as near
| creation now as any one else we ever
heard of. We a.re still in a primitive
| era along with Moses and Homer,
with Trismogistus and Ozymandias
| and the otl er fossil relics in the
sands of time. In earlier days re
cords were few and costly and the
old fables have died out one by one
, in the telling. In our more resource
i f"l times records are kept by machin
ery and the ai,r is full of their clamor-
I ous insistence.
I *
The "In-group" somewhere, some
time. let us say, was gathered round
ihe campfire, its warriors rejoicing in
victory and riot ng in plunder, its
women bewailing their dead. The
slain of the beaten "Out-group" were
being prepared for the great feast.
Rut the Visionary among them roso
to stay thei.r hand. It was to him not
seemly that young men should oat the
hearts of their opponents to consum
mate their own bravery, that wise
men should have to eat the brains of
sages to complete their own wisdom,
that men should devour their brother
men in a drunken orgy of blood.
And his fellows answered that hu
man nature dors not change; always
there had been feasts of human flesh
after a v'ctory won, and always there
would be. In no other way could the
Manes of their own fallen heroes be
comforted as they rose to Olympus
or Valhalla. And the protester was
swept aside, while the great feast
went on.
I>ut a true word outlasts the man
who speaks it.and the plea to let the
captured bury their dead at last
brought about the fall of .cannibalism.
Since writing the above, I have read
"A Defense of Cannibalism" by Mon
sieur B. Beau, translated from "La
Revue, February 15th, 1909, in which,
in allegorical form, is described a
cannibal feast. The common argu
ments lo.v war are here advanced as
pleas for cannibalism. A missionary,
protesting, is driven off by the natives,
who, nevertheless, give up the prac
tice. The chieftain insists, however,
that "It is absurd to pretend to pre
serve war while proscribing canni

balism, for this is at once the prin
cipal cause, the necessary condition
and the real justification of it."
However, human sacrifice of some
sort there had always been, and the
gods unchanging still clamored for it,
demanding now, not the slain in bat
tle, but the living "nearest and best."
And the Visionary rose again, this
time to plead that the gods should he
appeased, not with the fair bod.es of
youth, but with dumb sheep and oxen
instead. At first, perhaps out of fear,
they gave ro heed, but in the end he
and his like prevailed, and with the
lapse of time, little by little, men
came to louk with horror on any altar
stained with blood.
* * *
Two thousand years ago, tlie whole
world knows the sto.ry, the incom
parable Visionary of Nazareth raised
his vo'ce, proclaiming that all men
were brothers, Gentile or Jew, all
children of the same Father. "The
Prince of Peace" they called him, for
peace means brotherhood. But man
were in power who loved not peace
nor brotherhood. These rose in
anger and destroyed him. And yet
his word was Truth, sinking deep and
long enduring, some fragments in the
hearts of every one of us.
Among those who heard his sayings
and remembered them was much var
. iance of interpretation. Every group
j came to have its schism, and each dl
i vergent faction found the others
tainted by heresy, to be expiated only
! with blood. To betray the faith
J meant death, for death only would
| save others from contamination. Thus
I the rack and the pyre became instru
i ments of faith.
Now once more the Visionary raised
a voice, protesting against all shack
ling of the human mind, and pro
claiming man's right to call each in
his own way on God. "Dangerous
doctrine this,"the people said, and
to a stake on Oxford Common they
chained him and his rcllow Vision
ary, Ridley, "lie of good cheer, Mas
ter Ridley," said Latimer, "we shall
to-day light such a candle, by God's
grace, in England as shall not be put
out." And by the light of this "Ox
ford candle" men saw the wrong they
htod done, and the torch of intoler
| ance never again flared up in Eng
land.
❖ * *
On the field of victory the "In
group" long slew without mercy the

conquered foe. One day the Vision
ary came to plead for the lives of the
captured survivors. Better to keep
them as workers than to destroy them
wantonly. And helots being profita
ble, saving mens labor in a world
hard at the best, arose gradually the
great system of slavery, hurtful alike
to master and mai*. Whatever its
phases in later days, its primal mo
tive was mercy.
But it came to pass as time went on
and people more and more craved ex
citement that they chose strong men
f.rom among their captured slaves and
tra'ned them to fight with swords in
the arena. Thus were brave men
butchered "to make a Roman holi
day." But here again, a Visionary
stood up to condemn. It was the
monk Telemachus, who with his life
stopped the last gladiatorial combat.
They disposed of him easily, but that
day cf blood was passing. Others
saw with his eyes and sickened at the
si",lit. The system of slavery still en
dured, though as centuries passed the
mind and soul of man revolted more
and more against it.
Fourteen hundred years after Tele
machus, arose John Brown who made
his last stand against the time
honored institution. XVhen they toow
him from the gallows at Charlestown
in Virginia and laid his body in the
grave at North Elba, where it "lies
mouldering," his soul, you remember,
went marching on. "It seems," said
Thoreau at Concord, fifty years ago
in the old town hall, "It seems as if
no one eve.r died in America before.
If that man's acts and words do not
create a revival, it will be the sever
est possible satire 011 words and acts
that do." "Some eighteen hundred
years ago," Thoreau continued, "Christ
was crucified. This morning, per
chance, Captain Brown was hung. .
. . He is not 'Old Brown' any long
er. He is an angel of light."
Captu.ved, wounded, 011 the floor of
the old Engine house at Harper's Fer
ry lay the Visionary, John Brown.
"No man sent me here," he said, "It
was my own prompting and that of
my Maker. I acknowledge no master
in human form. It is perfectly right
for anyone to interfere with you so
far as to free those you wilfully and
wickedly hold in bondage. I have yet
to hear that God is a .respecter of per
sons. . . . You may dispose of me
now very easily. I am nearly dis
posed of now, but this question is

still to be settled and the end is not
yet."
And again they said, clergymen,
professors and journalists, "There
have always been slaves and there al
ways will be. It is the end and pur
pose of inferiors to take inferior
places. Human nature never changes."
Nevertheless, slavery was to pass
away foreve.r, even though "for every
drop of blood drawn by the lash, an
other was drawn by the sword." And
a million men laid down their lives to
prove that though human nature
might not change, yet it could develop
a wholly different point of view in
matters of right and justice.
♦ * *
It has happened more than once be
fore our day that Europe was red
dened with brother's blood. Feudal
lords fought against feudal lords, and
men of one faith took arms against
those of another. Soldiers of fortune
peddled out for gold the service of
their marauding bands to one prince
or to one religion, and then to an
other. No one was armed with the
awful weapons of to-day, but hate
raged everywhere, and was cherished
as a patriotic duty to an extent which
we of gentler rearing can scarcely
conceive. The worst manifestations
of to-day come in direct line from the
hatreds and cruelties of the 17th cen
tury and from which no part of the
continent of Europe was then free.
Like conditions prevailed in Asia at
that time. For instance, at Nauwon,
in Korea, three hundred years ago,
"three thousand heads of the slain
were pickled and fo.rwarded to the
Japanese Sliogun Hideyoshi, as evi
dence of victory. Later at Suclion the
trophies, thirty-nine thousand pickled
heads, were found so burdensome that
only ears and noses were sent. In
Kyoto still stands the stone monu
ment of the Mimi Dzuka or "Ear
Mound," where they were triumphant
ly buried. And here again, in Japan
as in Europe, a voice was raised fojr
better things.
"Of all tyrannies of unreason in the
modern world," says Andrew D.
White, "one holds a supremely evil
prominence. It covered the period
from the middle of the sixteenth cen
tury to the middle of the seventeenth,
and throughout those hundred years
was waged a war of hatreds, racial,
religious, national and personal, of
ambitions, ecclesiastical and civil, of


Chancellor .lonian.
aspirations patriotic and selfish, of ef
forts noble and vile. During all those
weary generations, Europe became
one broad battlefield drenched in hu
man blood and lighted from innumer
able scaffolds."
In this confused struggle appeared
heroes and martyrs, ruffians and
scoundrels. The dominant interna
tional gospel was that of Machiavelli,
a gospel of malicious opportunism.
"Into the very midst of this welter
of evil, at a point in time to all ap
pearances hopeless, at a point in
space apparently defenseless, in a na
tion in which every man, woman and
child was under sentence of death
from its sovereign, was born a man
who wrought as no other has done
for a redemption of civilization from
the cause of that misery; who thought
out for Europe the principles of right
reason in international law, who made
them heard, who gave a noble change
to the course of human affairs, whose
thoughts, reasonings, suggestions and
appeals produced an environment in
which came an evolution of humanity
which still continues."
Hugo Grotius spoke for the inalien
able rights of man, the right to be,
to think, to live, to travel, to trade,
to use the land and sea, rights which
no authority should take away. In
his day he fought against the same
old prejudice, the human nature that
can never change, the crimes that
have always been and so must ever
be, the same "unreason, bigotry, par
ty passion, individual ambition, all
masquerading as saving faith."
In prison, in poverty, in banish
ment, the Visionary of Holland to
whom more than to any one else we
owe such international justice as is
granted to us, may be granted to us
when to-day's conflict is over, wrote
against war, against intolerance,
against the double standards of mo
rality for men and nations, the idea
that what is wrong in the In-group
is right for the Outs.
Few more inspiring things have
"been seen in human history. Grotius
had apparently every reason for yield
ing to pessimism, for hating his coun
try and for despising the race. He
might have given his life to satirizing
his enemies and to scolding at human
folly. He did nothing of the sort, but
worked on, day and night to bestow
on mankind one of the most precious
blessings it has ever received, "the
blessing of international law in place
of international violence, hatred and
anarchy r . "More wonderful than the
book was the faith of the author. He
saw in ail this darkness one court sit
ting supreme to which he might ap
peal, and that court the heart and
mind of universal humanity. 'I saw,'
said Grotius, 'many and grave reasons
why T should write a work on that
subject. T saw in the whole Christian
world a license of fidhting at which
even barbaric nations might blush.
Wars were begun on trifling pretexts
or none at all and carried on without
any reverence for law Divine or hu
man. A declaration of war seemed to
let loose every crime.' " "War to ex
termination became the only means of
obtaining peace." The annulling of
oaths and treaties "inconvenient to
keep leaves," said William of Orange,
"nothing certain in the world." And
to build np a foundation of certainty
which should in time mean universal
peace, was the purpose of Interna
tional Law.
A scholar, a patriot, a lover of his
race, with no army and no claque be
hind him, Grotius was soon disposed
of. "It had not been given him to see
any apparent result of his great, gift
to mankind." From childhood till his
death in shipwreck on the Pomeran
ian Coast, he "had known nothing but
war, bigoted, cruel, revengeful war,
extending on all sides about him."
And when they took his body through
Rotterdam for burial ih his old home
at Delft, strtnes were thrown at his
coffin by the city mob. Yet in all
these two thousand years, no one else
has come nearer to the mission of
.Tesus of Nazareth, "The earth is up
held by the influence of good men.
They keep the world wholesome."
The mantle of Grotius has not fallen

to the ground; it rests on the shoul
ders of many, not one so great as he,
but all Imbued with the same spirit of
toleration and humanity.
After the seizure of Aisaee ana Lor
raine, Prussian revenge for old
French outrages, the first meeting of
the Interparliamentary Union was
called at Berlin. This Union was to
include representatives from all the
congresses, parliaments and self
governing bodies of the world, and its
purpose was to bring about rational
relations among the great nations.
The .representatives of France re
fused to attend. They would not go
to Prussia to find themselves and their
nation insulted. One only, Frederic
Passy, of Paris, took a broader view.
"I will go to Berlin," he said, "and I
will not be insulted." And he went,
and took his part in the work for a
better understanding which should at
last make war unthinkable. The pres
ent speaker remembers, as one of the
fine moments of his life, a visit to the
aged Passy at his home at Neuilly
sur-Seine, in which, forty years after,
the veteran peace-worker showed him
the photograph of this first meeting of
the Interparliamentary Union. In
this picure, there in the central seat,
the place of honor, appears the brave
deputy of France.
* * *
Little by little, by one means or an
other, arises the great appeal of the
heart and mind of universal human
ity, the appeal to keep unreasoning
anger out of the councils of the world,
to make the use of violence the last
resort and not the first in interna
t'onal disputes. In this movement de
voted women are coming to take their
part. Through the ages woman has
borne the real brunt of war. It was
a brave woman of Austria, the Bar
oness Bertha von Siittner, who first
gave to the world the story of war,
its patriotism and its intrigues, as
seen from the woman's side. This
vision of woman's sufferings, set forth
in "Waffen Nieder" turned the current
of thought for thousands of other
women and of men. "Waffen Nieder,"
Madame von Siittner once said to me,
"is not the sto.ry of my life, it made
my life." She had glimpsed the vi
sion of a better world, one ruled by
ideas and not by bayonets. To-day,
when the old half-smothered brutali
ties have broken out again, the
leagues of women rise to plead for
the sacredness of human life, calling
to the men to stop this wicked war.
Fifty years ago and more a great
battle was fought on the hills above
Desenzano, near the blue Lake of
Garda. There on the field of Solfer
ino, more than fifty thousand men
killed and wounded lay for three days
untended under the hot June sky of
Lombardy, the prey of flies and mos
quitoes. In those merciless days a
wounded soldier, like a broken mus
ket, was not worth Paving. Tt hap
pened, however, that TTenri Dunant of
Geneva, a tourist in Verona, led by
curiosity went out at last to see the
battleleld. There and then he touched
one of the first, modern notes in re
gard to war, —human sympathy. This,
he said, is no field of glory. "It is a
European calamity." And he set to
work with the help of the people of
Desenzano to relieve the suffering of
that hideous day. Then and there be
gan the Red Cross movement which
now spreads the world over.
Dunant died at Heiden in Switzer
land. October 31st, 1910, having re
ceived the Nobel Peace Prize in rec
ognition of what he had done, not for
peace directly, but to make war less
horrible.
* * *
There have been many Visionaries
in history, true to the light they saw
—men and women who have given
tlirir lives for their fellows.
Thoreau once spoke of .Tesus and
John Brown as "the ends of a chain
that, is not without its links." The
Visionaries are links of a chain which
will not end. The cause they serve
shall outlast all opposition. The in
dividual is weak enough and easily
disposed of. but his soul goes march
ing on. In a high sense "human na
ture does not change"—it responds
eternally to the call of righteousnesn.

So many human illusions and ob
sessions, Crusades, Feudalism, Inqui
sition, Witchcraft, each has gone its
way, and perished each in the day of
its apparent triumph! When men
come to see nakedly what their wick
ed institutions mean, they will no
longer live and die to maintain them.
By this same token, War is doomed.
If to-day's horror I>e not its deafh
throe, if we urn t look forward to an
other, then all thrones and empires
will go down together. "God is no<
mocked forever"; neither is man!
