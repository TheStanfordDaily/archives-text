# TRACK HONORS FALL TO STANFORD, MEN IN SUMMER MEETS
## Murray United States Champion In Both Hurdle Events at the A.A.U. Games CARDINAL STARS AID OLYMPIC CLUB TO WIN FIRST PLACE. 
### 
Stanford came to the forefront in
the wealth of track championships
that were held during the summer in
connection with the Exposition in San
Francisco. Nearly all of the Cardinal
athletes competed under the colors of
the Olympic Club which won both the
Junior and the Senior A. A. U. cham
pionships.
The first important meet of the sea
son took place Saturday, July 31, on
the Exposition oval, and in this meet
the elimination tryouts were held to
determine the Pacific Coast entries
in the larger meets to follow. Feg
Murray, '16, starred in his favorite
event, the low hurdles, negotiating the
distance in :23.3, thereby tying the
world's record. None of the times
made at any of the meets held at the
Exposition were allowed, owing to the
strong wind which swept the coarse
on each occasion.
Fred Kelly took the high hurdles in
:15, another world's record, with Mur
ray pacing him closely lur second
place. J. K. Norton, '16, took third in
the low sticks. E. M. Bennett, '15, won
the half mile in 2 minutes 1 4-5 sec
onds. T. M. Cramer, '11, placed sec
ond. W. F. Sisson, '17, took five points
in the broad jump at 22 feet 4V 2
inches. The pole vault was won by
Sam Bellah, '11, the height being 12
feet 6 inches. R. R. Caughey, '18,
heaved the shot 45 feet 4 inches for
first place. V. L. Sheldon, ex-'l5,
landed in fourth place. Horine and
Bellah were respectively third and
fourth in the javelin throw.
Winged 0 Is Winner.
The Senior Championships we.re
held the next day, and resulted in a
glorious win for the Olympic Club.
Nineteen of the 30 points credited to
to the winning team were made by
Stanford athletes. Murray was de
clared United States champion in both
hurdle events as a result of his day's
labors. Kelly topped the high sticks
in:15 flat, but in his hurry he turned
over four bar.riers, thereby losing five
points for the Southland. Murray,
right on his heels, was awarded first
place by the judges. The low hurdles
went to the Stanford chompion in the
world's record time of 23 3-5 seconds.
Kelly was in the lead during the
greater part of the .race, and was only
overhauled by inches after the last
hurdle had been passed.
Horaine again won the high jump
with a leap of 6 feet % inch to his
credit. Bellah repeated in the pole
vault, the bar being set at 12 feet
9 Inches for the winner. Caughey took
third in the shot put which was won
by Arlie Mucks of Wisconsin with a
heave of 48 feet 11% inches. W. E.
Sisson proved himself to be in the
stellar class by placing third in tho
broad jump at 23 feet.
So Stanford may boast of three
United States champions. Every
event made history; every event
brought out champions from every
section of the country. The times
were all extraordinarily fast, and best
of all, the West proved that it had the
quality, if not the quantity, among
the track and field champions of the
United States.
