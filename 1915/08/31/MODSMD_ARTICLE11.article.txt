# Rugby Dope
## 
### 
We're back again, and rugby is on
the football calendar. In casting our
fortunes with rugby it isn't necessary
to cu.rse the American version, or to
drag in the history of our diplomatic
bickerings with California.
Stanford will continue to support an
athletic policy which fosters wide
spread participation in sports, devel
ops a maximum of mental and physi
cal prowess, and minimizes the danger
of coach dominance.
Rugby is friendly eve.ry year to some
200 Stanford men who want a taste of
field competition. Those who possess
intelligence, activity, and nerve, find
places on the dozen or more teams and
"peanut league" squads, and stick
through the season.
The American game demands no less
of physical excellence, but because of
intricate and artificial rules and field
strategy, it welcomes comparatively
few men, and does not breed the
proper amount of individual resource.
Men for the varsity teams must be
chosen early, in order that they may
master jealously guarded signals, and
preconceived strategic tactics of the
coach. Free shifting of players from
team to team is unwieldy, because each
section must have different signals and
trick plays. The mediocre player is
lost in the shuffle, for the sake of
drilling a powerful machine.
Coach dominance in the old game
has not beeen eliminated. A good
coach sends his men in with rules and
regulations to meet every emergency.
Mechanical efficiency overshadows in
dividual resourcefulness.
As a spectacle rugby offers more
open play, more chance to follow the
man and the ball. The science of the
individual, not that of the coaching
committee is dominant. Revision has
not made the American game as open
as rugby. The influence of the coach
never leaves the men on the field. He
directs the contest.
Let's hear what Brown, Lannigan
and Dave Folsom have to say at the
rally.
