### 
Frederick C. Hamilton and
Russell Poorest Downing have
been added to the list of Stan
ford's honored dead. We who
are returned for another year on
the campus miss them very
badly.
Some of us feel first the sense
of loss attendant on the passing
of two Stanford men who hon
ored their alma mater and ex
tended thei.r best efforts in her
behalf. Many others realize the
loss of two close friends.
On Monday, June 14, Fred
Hamilton succumbed, following
an operation for appendicitis
which was the beginning of a
long illness at the Peninsula
hospital. Last semester Fred
completed his work as an active
worker in the Student Body by
serving as editor of The Daily
Palo Alto.
Sunday, June 5, Stanford bore
another bereavement. The day
previous Russ Downing was
fatally injured while diving into
the breakers at Waikiki beach.
Honolulu, when he sustained a
fracture of the skull. That
he was representing his uni
versity as a member of the
varsity baseball team ren
ders his loss especially sad.
Russ's likable personality made
him a friend of many hundreds.
To the students' parents we
extend our deepest sympathy.
