# UNION WANTS GUESTS
## Comforts and Fun Equipment Ready for Membership 
### 
All the advantages that a union can
offer will be given the members of the
Stanford Union this year. To begin
with, there is plenty of room for all
who wish to play pool or billiards.
The lonnging room affords comfort and
luxury and a place to meet other men.
Musical facilities are good. A ma
hogany cabinet has just been presented
by Encina club. The player piano will
be kept busy when members find that
a great amount of good music has just
been purchased. Almost every peri
odical in print is to be found in the
reading room. Writing material will
be furnished free. In the cleanly white
new barber shop, patrons find a great
convenience. "Charley" promises the
same kind of service he has given in
Encina for so many years.
Students who find their rooms too
noisy for study will find quiet and
light for late work. The Union never
closes. Adequate rooming facilities
will be provided for relatives and
friends of members. The charges are
reasonable.
All student or faculty organizations
are to feel free to hold meetings in
either the committee room or the
lounging room. Exclusive rights for
an evening or for the entire year may
be obtained by applying to the Man
ager, S. J. W. Sharp, '14.
Membership cards may be obtained
from Manager Sharp at room 6 of the
Union building, from Wideman's or the

charges. Members are requested to
carry membership cards and to see
