# Dr. Branner Agrees to Keep Office One Year
## Professor Bailey Willis Succeeds President as Head of Geology Department. 
### 
Although his .resignation was pre
sented to the Trustees at the close of
the last acaremic year, Dr. Branner
again sits in the presidential chair,
having felt that it was in accord with
his sense of loyalty to the University
to accede to the wishes of the Board
of Trustees that he keep his office fo.r
another twelve months. This was the
gist of the announcement made by
Preseident Newhall of the Trustees at
the Commencement exercises last May.
Dr. Branner's acceptance entailed
great sacrifice on his part, as he has
looked fo.rward to a period when he
might devote himself to the science in
which he is a leader. Having reached
the age of retirement Dr. Branner has
left the department of Geology, at the
head of which he has stood since the
opening of the university.
Dr. Bailey Willis succeeds Dr. Bran
ner as head of the Geology department.
Dr. Willis, a native of New York, and
a graduate of Columbia, has served in
many and varied capacities connected
with his work as geologist. He has
been with the United Statps Govern
ment on the Northern Transcontinen
tal survey; as geological explorer with
the Georgia Institute in Asia, and has
recently been engaged in making a
geological survey of Patagonia fo.r the
Argentine Republic. He has been con
nected with the faculties of Chicago
and Johns Hopkins Universities.
