# CHAPARRAL NOW "LIFE SIZE"
## Originality of New Issue Proves Value of Summer Growth 
### 
Now that new Chaparral has ap
peared on the campus the first look at
the four-color cover designed by W. W.
Gores, '17, leaves no doubt that nine
teen nineteen has really come for a
four-year stay.
Editor Levy takes his first swing at
the hammer to let us know that he is
glad to be back, that the football out
look isn't as blue as California would
paint it for us, that the freshmen are
about due for some good advice and
the crew for some congratulation. He
also announces the appointment of
W. H. Waterman, '18, to the list of
Chappies.
R. A. Griffin, '17, contributes a co
educational dilletante with a tang.
M. A. Oliver, '15, celebrates his return
to the staff with a full page half-tone
of Miss Nineteen. The featured verse
comes from the pens of E. G. Leaf, '17,
and Geroid Robinson, '17.
A double-page drawing under the
caption. "College Opens," is the work
of F. S. Murray, '16, who has been
chosen art editor of the comic for this
year. L. W. McDermott, '17, and J. M.
Wallace, '17, also make cheerful addi
tions to the art work in the issue.
The letters of Archie and the gripping
tale of the family skeleton are good
features, and those lines of type that
are used to fill in between the little
black hammer and coffin signs seem
to measure above the usual standard.
