# CARDINAL OARS STARTLE EAST
## STANFORD SHELL PRESSES CORNELL TO FINISH 
### 
If there was an easterner who said,
"I told you so," as an aftermath to the
Poughkeepsie regatta, he was carerul
to aim his words to .reach the ears of
only a few harmless friends. For the
East could not conceive just such a
nerve-shattering ending to a "well
doped" regatta.
Eastern experts placed too implicit
faith in superfluous form, technique,
in past honors, and discounted abso
lutely the value of stamina, brawn,
and determination. But even so, It
was the training and technique of
Courtney's proteges that sent them
ove.r the linish a half length ahead of
the Cardinals and we must accord to
them and to Courtney a merited
victory.
The Cornell men finished the four
mile grind in 19 minutes, 3G 3-5 sec
onds, wihle the Cardinals came in 1 1-5
seconds behind them,
Thrilling Spurt.
"Never in the history of the big col
legiate regatta," writes Frank G.
Menke, of the International News Ser
vice, "has any varsity crew put forth
such an amazing and thrilling half
mile spurt as the Leland Stanford crew
did when it finished one-half length
behind the winning Cornell shell.
"Had Stanford timed its spurt two
seconds sooner, o.r had the course been
fifty yards longer, Stanford would have
won. He.r men finished in wonderful
condition, able to row another two
miles at a record breaking clip, while
the men in the four rival crews had
been 'rowed to death' by the plucky
Californians."
Great credit is due Coach Frank
Guerena, 12, for he was pitted against
the best crew trainers in America.
After the races he said: "The boys
were up against big handicaps. They
were not overcome by stage-fright.
They are the gamest bunch of boys
that ever sat in a boat, and I believe
the crowd that saw the race today will
agree with me in that."
From the time that Stroke Rix
Maurer drove his blade into the water,
Stanford was a factor in the struggle,
and as the prow of the Cardinal shell
crept up on the faltering Cornell oars
men in the terrific drive at the finish,
thousands were cheering the West
erners.
Jiinip to Lead.
The Stanford crew got away on the
jump and held its lead until near the

mile mark. Then it slowed up a bit,
dropping slowly back of Syracuse and
then back of Cornell. Put this was
done with a purpose. Johnny Good
man wanted to be back a bit. He did
not want his eight to set the pace.
At the three-mile mark Stanford
pushed its stroke from around 32 to 34
and moved slowly up toward the sec
ond place Syracuse crew, which up to
that time had led the Stanford crew by
four lengths. Syracuse accepted the
challenge and notched its stroke to 3S,
but, although it was doing two strokes
l)er minute better than Stanford, the
Cardinals gained because of the
superior sweep and power of its every
stroke.
At the three and a half mile mark,
Stanford really showed itself. It then
lay four lengths behind the leading
Cornell boat and two back of Syracuse.
And then the wonderful spurt began.
Easily but speedily Stanfo.rd pushed
its stroke to 36 long, sweeping, perfect
strokes that shot the shell along like
a racing automobile. Cornell and
Syracuse put their whole length to
tho'r oars to beat off the Western chal
lenger; but for Syracuse it was a futile
effort and for Cornell almost the same.
The Final Dasli.
Stanford closed up the two lengths
that had separated it from Syracuse,
and then it pulled away in the lead
and in pursuit of the leading Cornell
outfit. Stanford gained a slight lead
and then dropped back.
Fifty yards to go and one hundred
feet to gain. Could Stanford make it?
That was the question that the crowd
asked itself. Stanford crept up on the
Cornell crew. The nose of the Cardi
nal shell was now on a line with the
Cornell stern. Nov/ its point was far
ther forward. Now it was half way.
Now within eight feet of the Cornell
bow. And then the revolver cracked.
Stanford had timed its spurt two sec
onds too late.
