"Gogetem" played an important role
in the regatta. Two days before the
the race the crew received a cartoon
with the slogan from "Feg" Murray at
Yosem'te. The signatures of a score
of Stanford men and women were ap

Chaplin, Papa Katzenjammer, Hawk
sliaw and Hooligan, each in a rival
shell well to the rear of the Cardinal.
