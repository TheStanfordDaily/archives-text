# STANFORD TARES FIRM STAND IN FAVOR OF RUGBY
## Summer Negotiations Disclose the Intention of California to Adopt Old Game FRIENDLY RELATIONS ARE MAINTAINED WITH NORTHERN COLLEGES. 
### 
The final break in athletic relations
between the universities of Stanford
and California was effected during the
summer months, and The Daily Palo
Alto publishes for the convenience of
its subscribers a brief outline of the
negotiations which took place between
the various committees, and official
bodies of the two colleges.
It will be remembered that during
the third week of April, Stanford stu
dents submitted the proposition of
arbitration to the leaders of Cali
fornia's student body. On Friday,
April 23, California adopted the fol
lowing motion:
"In order that there may be no doubt
concerning our settled convictions
and policy with relation to intercol
legiate competition, we, students of the
University of California, in mass meet
ing assembled today, hereby resolve:
Bar Freshmen.
"That we will not engage in inter
collegiate athletic contests with Stan
ford University except under the ex
press agreement that the Freshman
ineligibility rule shall be one of the
conditions to govern said contest."
California apparently ignored the
proposal to arbitrate, as this question
was not even submitted by the leaders
to the mass of the body. And then
California's real reason for severing
relations became apparent, through the
discovery of negotiations with U.
S. C. for closer relations. Cali
fornia wished to return to the
old game. California was well aware
that tlie Stanford faculty would
not at the present time permit a sim
ilar move on the part of the students
here, even should they wish to make
such an undesirable change. Cali
fornia, then, was bent on severing
relations, and many consider the cause
the scores of the last two football,
track, and crew competitions.
Alumni -Meet.
This was the situation at the close
of the college year. As soon as the
students of the rival universities had
had time to cool off, the alumni of each
began to arrange for a compromise
settlement, both sides evincing a de
sire for friendly reconciliation.
The Executive Committee of the
Stanford Student Body appointed Asso
ciate Professor D. M. Folsom, C. M.
Hradley, '01, and L. S. Peedy, '98, with
full power to meet the California
alumni committee Warren Olney, Jr.,
Professor Putnam, and J. K. Moffat.
After two meetings, the joint commit
tee failed to reach an agreement. The
Stanford committee then conferred
with a committee of the students, com
posed of P. R. Wilson, '16, D. P. Car
roll. '16. and E. M. Bonnett '15. The
students acquainted the alumni with
the Campus point of view, and the
alumni convinced the student leaders
that nothing could be accomplished.
Finally, the two chairmen of the
alumni committees met and decided
that reconciliation was impossible at
the present time.
President Writes.
The next step was taken by P. I.
Wheeler, President of the University
of California. Dr. Wheeler wrote a
personal letter to D.\ Pranner ex
pressing his regret that the two col
leges were at odds, and stating his
