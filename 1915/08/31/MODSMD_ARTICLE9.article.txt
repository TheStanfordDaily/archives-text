# STANFORD TARES FIRM STAND IN FAVOR OF RUGBY
## Summer Negotiations Disclose the Intention of California to Adopt Old Game FRIENDLY RELATIONS ARE MAINTAINED WITH NORTHERN COLLEGES. 
### 
The final break in athletic relations
between the universities of Stanford
and California was effected during the
summer months, and The Daily Palo
Alto publishes for the convenience of
its subscribers a brief outline of the
negotiations which took place between
the various committees, and official
bodies of the two colleges.
It will be remembered that during
the third week of April, Stanford stu
dents submitted the proposition of
arbitration to the leaders of Cali
fornia's student body. On Friday,
April 23, California adopted the fol
lowing motion:
"In order that there may be no doubt
concerning our settled convictions
and policy with relation to intercol
legiate competition, we, students of the
University of California, in mass meet
ing assembled today, hereby resolve:
Bar Freshmen.
"That we will not engage in inter
collegiate athletic contests with Stan
ford University except under the ex
press agreement that the Freshman
ineligibility rule shall be one of the
conditions to govern said contest."
California apparently ignored the
proposal to arbitrate, as this question
was not even submitted by the leaders
to the mass of the body. And then
California's real reason for severing
relations became apparent, through the
discovery of negotiations with U.
S. C. for closer relations. Cali
fornia wished to return to the
old game. California was well aware
that tlie Stanford faculty would
not at the present time permit a sim
ilar move on the part of the students
here, even should they wish to make
such an undesirable change. Cali
fornia, then, was bent on severing
relations, and many consider the cause
the scores of the last two football,
track, and crew competitions.
Alumni -Meet.
This was the situation at the close
of the college year. As soon as the
students of the rival universities had
had time to cool off, the alumni of each
began to arrange for a compromise
settlement, both sides evincing a de
sire for friendly reconciliation.
The Executive Committee of the
Stanford Student Body appointed Asso
ciate Professor D. M. Folsom, C. M.
Hradley, '01, and L. S. Peedy, '98, with
full power to meet the California
alumni committee Warren Olney, Jr.,
Professor Putnam, and J. K. Moffat.
After two meetings, the joint commit
tee failed to reach an agreement. The
Stanford committee then conferred
with a committee of the students, com
posed of P. R. Wilson, '16, D. P. Car
roll. '16. and E. M. Bonnett '15. The
students acquainted the alumni with
the Campus point of view, and the
alumni convinced the student leaders
that nothing could be accomplished.
Finally, the two chairmen of the
alumni committees met and decided
that reconciliation was impossible at
the present time.
President Writes.
The next step was taken by P. I.
Wheeler, President of the University
of California. Dr. Wheeler wrote a
personal letter to D.\ Pranner ex
pressing his regret that the two col
leges were at odds, and stating his
desire that Rugby be perpetuated.
Dr. Branner was not on the Campus,
and Vice President Stillman finally
turned the communication over to Dr.
Angell, chairman of the Faculty Com
mittee on Athletics. In the meantime
Dr. Branner heard of the letter and
from his headquarters in the East he
dispatched a night letter to the Stan
ford authorities, stating his desire for
a continuation of relations, and ex
plaining the bad impression that was
being created in the East because of
the wrangling of the two most power
ful universities of the Pacific Coast.
He further stated that he would be
glad to discuss the matter with Presi
dent Wheeler.
Associate Professor Folsom took the
two letters to the California Alumni
Committee in San Francisco, and sug
gested that the matter be left entirely
to the two Presidents. The California
committee stated that it was too late.
Evidently California had gone too far
in her new policy of returning to the
old status.
John Stroud was in the north during
this time, and soon came the announce
ment that California had returned to
the old game. This marked the final
severance of all relations. It was also
announced that Jimmie Schaeffer, as
the California coach is affectionately
known to his admirers, would go East
to learn the first principles of the
old game.
Meet Northerners.
Graduate Manager E. C. Behrens,
'14, of Stanford University, then jour
neyed North, and learned that Wash
ington was willing to engage Stanford
in any or all sports. A contract for
crew competition was signed for one
year, with the understanding that it
could be renewed as often as desirable.
Then Behrens cast about for the reor
ganization of the Track Conference.
The meet heretofore has never been
held in the North, and California's
management of the meets, exclusive of
the wishes of the other members of
the Conference has never met with
favor among the Northern Colleges.
In the new plan, there will be a
Board of Governors, embracing an
equal representation from all of the
colleges. The meets will be held alter
nately in the South and the North, the
first competition to be in the North.
The details will be worked out during
the month of December. Freshmen
will be allowed to compete in this
annual meet, Washington being per
fectly willing to allow such action
after the other colleges had agreed
to it.
The Big Game will be held November
13, probably in San Francisco. The
exact place will be chosen later.
Both of the Universities have been
playing the game for nearly ten years,
and as a. game which is really repre
sentative of Western athletics, it
should furnish more real excitement
than the Washington-California clash.
