# HAWAIIAN BALL CLUBS LOSE LAURELS TO STANFORD TEAM
## CARDINAL WINS SEVEN GAMES Remarkable Batting Averages Are Registered by Stafford, Dent and Maple 
### 
After six weeks of strenuous base
ball, the Stanford Varsity, which
sailed for Honolulu at the close of
last semester to play a brief season
in the Oaliu League, returned to Cali
fornia with the majority of games
tucked away in the win column. The
invasion of the Far East was a suc
cess from almost every standpoint,
with the exception of the lamentable
loss of Russ Downing, who met his
death while diving through the break
ers three days before departure.
Eleven players captained by Tom
Workman and managed by R. W. Wil
cox embarked on the Matsonia May
19, arriving in the Islands on the 25th.
Four days practice were allowed the
visitors before breaking into active
play. After a flying start of two vic
tories against the Punahou College
Club and the Japanese Athletic Club
by scores of 1 to 0 and 11 to 4, the
next four contests saw the Varsity on
the short end of the score. The heat,
plus the fact that the games were
played in too rapid succession is to be
held mainly responsible for this string
of defeats. Stanford then showed a
flash of form, annexing five out of
the next seven games, thereby wind
ing up the invasion with the majority
of the thirteen contests played.
Following the first few clashes, the
nine showed to excellent advantage,
despite minor injuries such as
sprained ankles and broken fingers
suffered by Noonan. Day and Dent.
Stafford led the team in hitting with
the remarkable average of .365. Dent,
Maple and Workman followed in close
order with marks of .309, .303, and
.295, respectively. The work of Doc
Hayes and Gus Hoever is also deserv
ing of special mention, as both hu.rlers
showed up well under the strain of
having to perform box duty when
deserving a rest. The keystone com
bination of Maple and Stafford was a
revelation to the Islanders. Roth men
played a gilt edge article of ball, cut
ting down many vicious drives. Lan
der proved invaluable because of his
ability to stand either behind the plate
or in the outfield, and through his con
sistent stick work.
The men who made the trip lined-up
as follows: Hayes, Hoever, p.; Dent,
Lander, c.; Workman, lb.: Stafford,
2b.; Maple, s. s.; Stevens, 3b.; Day,
Downing, Noonan, Lander, outfielders.
The return voyage was begun July fi,
all the members of the team being
enthusiastic over the hospitable treat
ment afforded them by their hosts.

held mainly responsible for this string
of defeats. Stanford then showed a
flash of form, annexing five out of
the next seven games, thereby wind
ing up the invasion with the majority
of the thirteen contests played.
Following the first few clashes, the
nine showed to excellent advantage,
despite minor injuries such as
sprained ankles and broken fingers
suffered by Noonan. Day and Dent.
Stafford led the team in hitting with
the remarkable average of .365. Dent,
Maple and Workman followed in close
order with marks of .309, .303, and
.295, respectively. The work of Doc
Hayes and Gus Hoever is also deserv
ing of special mention, as both hu.rlers
showed up well under the strain of
having to perform box duty when
deserving a rest. The keystone com
bination of Maple and Stafford was a
revelation to the Islanders. Roth men
played a gilt edge article of ball, cut
ting down many vicious drives. Lan
der proved invaluable because of his
ability to stand either behind the plate
or in the outfield, and through his con
sistent stick work.
The men who made the trip lined-up
as follows: Hayes, Hoever, p.; Dent,
Lander, c.; Workman, lb.: Stafford,
2b.; Maple, s. s.; Stevens, 3b.; Day,
Downing, Noonan, Lander, outfielders.
The return voyage was begun July fi,
all the members of the team being
enthusiastic over the hospitable treat
ment afforded them by their hosts.
