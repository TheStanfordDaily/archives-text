# ROUSING RUGBY RALLY WILL OPEN SEASON TOMORROW
## STAGE IS SET FOR UNION Record Number Should Answer Call of Captain Carroll for Candidates 
### 
A "His Rail-road" —snappy and lots
of pep—will boom out from the Union
clubroom, and re-echo from every
nook and corner of the campus tomor
row evening. Every particle of the
present bubbling over enthusiasm,
now spent in interclass clothes-tear
ing fracases, rushing, and registering,
will be in evidence under Johnny
Goodman's leadership at the initial
football .rally of the season. Closely
following, seven Stanfordites, lacking
perhaps the eloquence of Bryan, but
brimming over with Cardinal spirit
will relate good old talcs of victories
on the turf. Immediately following
Captain Danny Carroll expects to sign
up a .record number of candidates for
rugby honors. The dryest of the drys
are expected to resemble uncaged
maniacs.
Five speakers already have consent
ed to be introduced by Student Body
President P. D. Wilson. Coach Floyd
Brown, '11, who twice has led the
varsity to victory, has promised to
mount the table, and should receive
a rousing welcome. Professor Frank
Angell, chairman of the Faculty Ath
letic committee will follow in the line
light. No other member of the faculty
is such a well-known figure in the
realm of Stanford spo.rts.
Skipper Danny Carroll will then
urge "the boys" to come out. Former
graduate manager, Doc Burbank, '09,
ardent Stanford booster, winds up the
speakers already definitely secured.
Efforts are now being made to secure
two more club orato.rs from among
erstwhile Coaches Jimmy Lannigan
and George Presley, Chris Bradley,
member of the alumni intercollegiate
agreement committee, and Dutch Roth
and Doc Schaupp, former wearer of
the block "S".
The rally will commence promptly
at seven forty-five, and should include
about an hour and a half of wild-eyed
enthusiasm. Every student in the uni
versity wearing trousers and claiming
to be a man is epected to be present.
No excuses will be tolerated.
Husky Guerena, '11. who coached
the varsity eight to renown and a sen
sational second in the Poughkeepsie
regatta, is also booked to inspire some
of his fire into the yelling mass that
promises to greet him.

Season student body tickets,
now on sale on the Quad, will
have more value than ever be
fore to the holders owing to the
opening of the new student body
plunge. Admittance to the pool
will be denied unless a ticket is
presented.
In addition to admitting hold
ers to eleven Varsity, eleven
Freshman, and eight second
Varsity Rugby games, season
tickets also grant the right to
vote, and adtn't owners to track,
baseball, and basketball games.
The admission to these games
woud cost ordinarily morn than
three times the value of the
tickets, which sell for five
dollars.
All money received from
women holders of student body
tickets is turned over to the
Women's Athletic Association,
for use in promoting women's
sports at Stanford.

No excuses will be tolerated.
Husky Guerena, '11. who coached
the varsity eight to renown and a sen
sational second in the Poughkeepsie
regatta, is also booked to inspire some
of his fire into the yelling mass that
promises to greet him.

Season student body tickets,
now on sale on the Quad, will
have more value than ever be
fore to the holders owing to the
opening of the new student body
plunge. Admittance to the pool
will be denied unless a ticket is
presented.
In addition to admitting hold
ers to eleven Varsity, eleven
Freshman, and eight second
Varsity Rugby games, season
tickets also grant the right to
vote, and adtn't owners to track,
baseball, and basketball games.
The admission to these games
woud cost ordinarily morn than
three times the value of the
tickets, which sell for five
dollars.
All money received from
women holders of student body
tickets is turned over to the
Women's Athletic Association,
for use in promoting women's
sports at Stanford.
A "His Rail-road" —snappy and lots
of pep—will boom out from the Union
clubroom, and re-echo from every
nook and corner of the campus tomor
row evening. Every particle of the
present bubbling over enthusiasm,
now spent in interclass clothes-tear
ing fracases, rushing, and registering,
will be in evidence under Johnny
Goodman's leadership at the initial
football .rally of the season. Closely
following, seven Stanfordites, lacking
perhaps the eloquence of Bryan, but
brimming over with Cardinal spirit
will relate good old talcs of victories
on the turf. Immediately following
Captain Danny Carroll expects to sign
up a .record number of candidates for
rugby honors. The dryest of the drys
are expected to resemble uncaged
maniacs.
Five speakers already have consent
ed to be introduced by Student Body
President P. D. Wilson. Coach Floyd
Brown, '11, who twice has led the
varsity to victory, has promised to
mount the table, and should receive
a rousing welcome. Professor Frank
Angell, chairman of the Faculty Ath
letic committee will follow in the line
light. No other member of the faculty
is such a well-known figure in the
realm of Stanford spo.rts.
Skipper Danny Carroll will then
urge "the boys" to come out. Former
graduate manager, Doc Burbank, '09,
ardent Stanford booster, winds up the
speakers already definitely secured.
Efforts are now being made to secure
two more club orato.rs from among
erstwhile Coaches Jimmy Lannigan
and George Presley, Chris Bradley,
member of the alumni intercollegiate
agreement committee, and Dutch Roth
and Doc Schaupp, former wearer of
the block "S".
The rally will commence promptly
at seven forty-five, and should include
about an hour and a half of wild-eyed
enthusiasm. Every student in the uni
versity wearing trousers and claiming
to be a man is epected to be present.
No excuses will be tolerated.
