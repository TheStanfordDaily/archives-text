There certainly is a kink in our con
ception of charity here at Stanford.
How do you figure that payment of
five dollars for a season ticket entitles
you to a memorial window in the read
ing room of the Union? An old timer
wanted to trade his kingdom for a
horse once, but nobody pinned a medal
on him.
We are not philanthropists by a long
way. We're a lot of sure-thing
gamblers. Most of the local inhabi
tants squeezed their money hard until
the graduate manager promised that
the Stanford varsity, second varsity
freshmen, and gray jersies are going
to meet twenty or more different teams
this season on the rugby turf. There
will be in the neighborhood of thirty
five games.
Then, besides rugby, there will be
baseball, soccer, basketball, and some
other things. Just feeble attempts to
keep us from thinking the place has
gone to the dogs. All of that makes
it look as though the price of your
season ticket is a gift, doesn't it?
After all though, why shouldn't we
insist on getting something for our
money? Certainly we should. And
we have something. Read the com

season tickets.
