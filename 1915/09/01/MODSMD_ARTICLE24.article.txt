# WIGGINS AND KNOLLIN TOUR ORPHEUM CIRCUIT
## 
### 
J. H. Wiggins, '11, and E. R. Knol
-1 in, '1,3, put the knowledge of gymnas
tics they have acquired at Stanford
to good use this summer. The early
part of the summer they spent on the
Orpheum circuit, where their act
proved a great hit. A few weeks ago
they appeared in the Court of Abun
dance "at the Panama-Pacific Exposi
tion in "A Story in Living Statuary."
Spotlights and other mechanical ef
fects made their exhibition of poses
depicting the ancient and modern
Olympic games realistic.
Both Wiggins and Knollin are as
sistants in the Encina gymnasium.
