# CAMPUS IS IMPROVED
## Summer "Stanford Beautiful" Campaign Waged 
### 
The result of a summer's effort to
improve the campus where improve
ment was needed can be seen in the
various changes that have been made
under the direction of Superintendent
J. E. Hewston. New roads have been
built and old ones made over. Oiled
macadam has replaced the gravel on
Lasuen Street between the Engineer
ing Building and the Post Office, as
well as on the thoroughfare leading
from the government building to the
lake.
In order to center the equipment a
large barn has been moved to the
Corporation yards from the residence
formerly used by Mrs. Stanford. Sev
eral sheds in that vicinity have been
torn down, adding much to the general
appearance. Houses about the cam
pus have been remodeled and im
proved. The Theta Xi Engineering
fraternity has just begun the construc
tion of their new home on San Juan
Hill.
The two museum domes have been
moved to the rear of the Post Office
where it is planned to use them at a
later date in the construction of a
nursery. All of the useless wreckage
around the old gymnasium and library
has been removed; the good bricks
have been cleaned and stacked ready
for sale.
The courts in the .rear of the Physics
and History Building have been filled
in and planted in grass.
The buildings and grounds about
the campus are in better condition this
fall than for several seasons, yet Mr.
Hewston states that he has many more
improvements planned for the near
future.
