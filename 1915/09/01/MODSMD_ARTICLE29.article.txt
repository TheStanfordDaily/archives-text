Jitney Accident.
Dan Hickey, of the Palo Alto police
force, is in the Peninsula Hospital
with two badly fractured ribs as a
result of an automobile accident last
night, one cause of which was the
slippery conditions of the pavement
on the state highway following last
night's sudden thunder storm.
The accident took place between
Palo Alto and Redwood City. Hickey
was riding in a little Trumbull car
driven by Romeo O'Leary of Palo Alto.

Hummer Factory.
The Boden Automatic Hammer Com
pany, incorporated for half a million
dollars, is planning to erect a fac
tory in the vicinity of Palo Alto, and
is negotiating for a bonus from the
Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce.
The plans include the ultimate em
ployment of a working force of be
tween 250 and 300 men.
The Boden automatic hammer,
which is fed with strips of prepared
tacks and nails, makes possible the
driving-home of a nail in one blow
from any angle, and greatly adds to
the efficiency of the carpenter.
