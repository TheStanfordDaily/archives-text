# NINETEENER Pays Women's Club Dues JOINS THE 500
## 
### 
Yesterday a good freshman hit the
Quad. We need more like him. His
name is W. M. Patterson. He paid two
perfectly good dollars for Women's
Club House dues. It was this way.
He came down the inner Quadrangle.
He wanted to do the square thing by
the place he picked to go to college.
He was stopped by a sombreroed thug
â€”and he subscribed to Chappie. He
was held up by a ditto and did his
checkbook for one dollar for Sequoia.
He came through likewise for The
Daily Palo Alto. He bought a season
ticket, and everything we all should
buy.
Some one put up a good sob story
about the Women's Club House. Pat
terson saw a pretty lady that looked
appealing. He put down two dollars.
They took it.
If the freshman will go to the Union
and ask for that two dollars, Sid Sharp
says he can get it back. We hope he
does. He deserves anything he can
get.
