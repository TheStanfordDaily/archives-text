# SWORD AND SANDALS TO PRESENT ROARING COMEDY
## WILL DEPART FROM TRADITION "Stop Thief" Is Vehicle of Men's Dramatic Society for First Play of Year 
### 
"Stop Thief" has been announced
by Sword and Sandals as the first
offering of the fall dramatic season.
The dramatic society has departed
from their usual type of play to give
the college public a taste of the rapid
fire comedy that seems to find most
favor with them.
In overturning tradition, Sword and
Sandals have done throrough work.
They have chosen the most hilarious
of recent New York comedy successes,
a fitting successor to the favorite,
"Officer 666". Carlyle Moore is the
author of "Stop Thief" in which a
gentleman robber is the principal
character.
Three romances run through the
three snappy acts of this play, and a
clergyman does the rest. Into the
Carr family, who are just preparing
to celebrate a wedding, the maid
smuggles a professional thief. Valu
able articles disappear in rapid suc
cession, and are found in the pockets
of the prospective bridegroom of the
charming Caroline Carr, who begins
to think that he is an incurable
kleptomaniac.
Complications pile up unceasingly.
The crook, the police, the million
aire kleptomaniac, the pretty maid,
all co-operate in adding to the tur
moil which precedes the final solu
tion. The character of the polished
crook will be one of the most inter
esting of recent portrayals on the
Assembly Hall stage. He dupes the
family, plots with the maid, and when
finally trapped by the police threat
ens to expose the kleptomaniac.
There will be only one set of scen
ery used throughout the play, and this
will enable Sword and Sandals to
make that one especially elaborate
and effective. It will also ensure a
quick performance with no long
waits between acts.
