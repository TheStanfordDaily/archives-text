# THERE PASSETH AWAY
## The
						Unrestricted Nocturnal Class Rush 
### 
Numerous complaints that the garb
of sophomore and freshman belliger
ents was too unconventional this
morning at the end of the annual
poster fight, has lead to a ban on
future clothes-tearing enterprises.
The following statement has been
issued by Student Adviser Stanley S.
Simonson: "There will be no more
garment wrecking contests between
the underclassmen. Steps will be
taken to convince entering students
that class rivalry will be no excuse
for nakedness in public, and that the
license permitted by their set-to
with the sophomores has limitations.
Revised Contests.
"Fights in the future will have to
be similar to those held in past years,
when sophomores simply tied fresh
men and threw them into cellars or
elsewhere while the posters were laid
on the campus. Every student will
lie given to understand that he will
be liable to expulsion if he appears
in public dressed only in smiles."
The final night battle between
sophomores and freshmen this year
turned out to be a day battle, first
hostilities beginning at approximately
5 o'clock this morning.
Sophomores gathered last night
along San Francisclto creek, where
they slept until morning around bon
fires. The 'nineteen aggregation met
near the Frenchmen's Dam where
they were whipped into organization
by juniors and seniors.
It is estimated that more than three
hundred dollars worth of clothes were
ripped unceremoniously from wear
