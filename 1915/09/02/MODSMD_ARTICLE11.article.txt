Tonight is the Big Night. Every
man in the University from the skull
capped nineteener, to the oldest hold
over will be present at the rally in
spiring the 1915 football season to a
rousing send-off. The Union is the
place, seven forty-five is the time.
Every effort is being made to sur
pass in attendance all rallies of pre
vious years. It will be the first
chance fo.r the newcomers to show
their Stanford spirit, and from their
evidence in numbers the student body
will be given its initial opportunity
to size up and welcome the new broth
ers into the Cardinal fold. Every
olde.r man who has signed the great
book in the Registrar's office is cer
tain to be there.
Record Sign-up.
As this season's football schedule
shows a wealth of games with over
twenty outside teams, Captain Danny
Carroll hopes for a record number of
candidates. Every one who has ever
played football or would like to play
football will be urged to sign up and
swell the grand total.
The rally will be conducted by Yell
leade.r Johnny Goodman. By the
time he ceases to call for all the
familiar cheers, an epidemic of sore
throats is certain to be afoot on the
campus. Six speakers are to face
the inaugural mass meeting of the
new year.
Snappy Oratory.
Doctor Frank Angell, chairman of
the Faculty Athletic Committee, is
booked as the orator of the evening.
On account of the score of years that
Doctor Angell has devoted his time
to the furtherance of the best there
is in university sports, no introduc
tion is necessary.
Husky Guerena, '11, coxswain of
the varsity crew for three years, and
coach for the past two seasons, will
follow. His description of the race in
the Poughkeepsie regatta will be of
vital interest to all.
When Coach Floyd Brown mounts
the platform a royal reception will
be in store for him. A star fullback
on the varsity for three intercollegi
ates, and coach of two winning teams
makes him a popular favorite.
Doc Burbank, '09, although new to
the last two generations, is a familiar
figure in the bygone days. He has
served his alma mater as graduate
manager, and represented 'Stanford
when California made lie.r attempt to
eliminate freshmen from varsity com
petition.
Another alumni, Dutch Roth, '09,
should prove an exceedingly interest
ing speaker. Roth won his block "S"
i in the varsity brickfield, and later
j acted as student body adviser.
Tlie Skipper.
The last man to mount the table
| will be Skipper Carroll, upon whose
' shoulders rests the task of building
a winning team. Immediately fol
lowing. those striving for football
hono.rs will hand in their signatures.
Remember—the Union, seven forty
five.

chance fo.r the newcomers to show
their Stanford spirit, and from their
evidence in numbers the student body
will be given its initial opportunity
to size up and welcome the new broth
ers into the Cardinal fold. Every
olde.r man who has signed the great
book in the Registrar's office is cer
tain to be there.
Record Sign-up.
As this season's football schedule
shows a wealth of games with over
twenty outside teams, Captain Danny
Carroll hopes for a record number of
candidates. Every one who has ever
played football or would like to play
football will be urged to sign up and
swell the grand total.
The rally will be conducted by Yell
leade.r Johnny Goodman. By the
time he ceases to call for all the
familiar cheers, an epidemic of sore
throats is certain to be afoot on the
campus. Six speakers are to face
the inaugural mass meeting of the
new year.
Snappy Oratory.
Doctor Frank Angell, chairman of
the Faculty Athletic Committee, is
booked as the orator of the evening.
On account of the score of years that
Doctor Angell has devoted his time
to the furtherance of the best there
is in university sports, no introduc
tion is necessary.
Husky Guerena, '11, coxswain of
the varsity crew for three years, and
coach for the past two seasons, will
follow. His description of the race in
the Poughkeepsie regatta will be of
vital interest to all.
When Coach Floyd Brown mounts
the platform a royal reception will
be in store for him. A star fullback
on the varsity for three intercollegi
ates, and coach of two winning teams
makes him a popular favorite.
Doc Burbank, '09, although new to
the last two generations, is a familiar
figure in the bygone days. He has
served his alma mater as graduate
manager, and represented 'Stanford
when California made lie.r attempt to
eliminate freshmen from varsity com
petition.
Another alumni, Dutch Roth, '09,
should prove an exceedingly interest
ing speaker. Roth won his block "S"
i in the varsity brickfield, and later
j acted as student body adviser.
Tlie Skipper.
The last man to mount the table
| will be Skipper Carroll, upon whose
' shoulders rests the task of building
a winning team. Immediately fol
lowing. those striving for football
hono.rs will hand in their signatures.
Remember—the Union, seven forty

Tonight is the Big Night. Every
man in the University from the skull
capped nineteener, to the oldest hold

rousing send-off. The Union is the
place, seven forty-five is the time.
Every effort is being made to sur
pass in attendance all rallies of pre
