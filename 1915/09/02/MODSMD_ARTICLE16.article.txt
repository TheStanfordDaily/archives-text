# Some Hop for '19
## 
### 
This is for the benefit of the fresh
men, and the rest of you don't need
to read it, because you will all be
there tonight anyway. It stacks up
this way, 'Nineteen: Every time Sep
tember comes around, the Stanford
men get together to make sure that
rugby season doesn't start off with
a game leg. They are going to stage
a party like that this evening at the
Union, and since you belong to the
family, your presence is desired.
We are getting warm on the trail
now, so read along fast. During the
summer months a few heads got to
gether up at California, and made the
important decision that the Blue and
Gold boys wouldn't play rugby foot
ball with us this year. American
football is on the cards up there now.
Of course, there was a lot of dicker
ing all last semester, before the final
break. There were so many commit
tee meetings between our represen
tatives and theirs that we couldn't
keep track of them.
Before you ever came to Stanford
you very likely read in your home
town papers any number of times
about "freshmen exclusion", and the
"five year rule", and "Australians"
and other such things. Don't worry
if you haven't been able to make head
or tail of the whole business. Right
now we'll clear it up for you.
As reasonable people will do, we
tried to put the squabble up to an
independent arbitration board for set
tlement. My goodness, but there
were some Dig men suggested for that
board! There were Chancellor Jor
dan. and President Wheeler, and Gov
ernor Johnson. You see, we thought
that the few freshmen we raise down
here on the Farm shouldn't scare such
a big place as California. And we
knew it was foolish to imagine for a
minute that our faculty would let fel
lows play on the Stanford varsity
who weren't getting by with their
studies.
Kven at that, we were so anxious
to keep on playing rugby with the
Blue and Gold folks that we were
willing to renovate the team if an ar
bitration board thought it necessary.
Always before we have got along
pretty well with the Berkeley people,
and the Big Game is a great thing for
both universities.
Governor Johnson was anxious to

patch things up so that the two great
est universities on the coast could
play an exhibition game for the east
erners at the Exposition this year.
Stanford was willing to exclude
freshmen from that one game of
rugby. But then you can't "arbitrate
a principle", as someone at Berkeley
has said.
Just to get down to cases, the fresh
men, and scholarship, and inviolable
principle don't seem to have had a
thing to do with the break. California
was in correspondence with Southern
California two years ago, seeking a
return to American football. And
while committees from the two uni
versities were trying to reach an
agreement this last summer, Gradu
ate Manager Stroud up there was ne
gotiating for a meeting in the "old
game" with Washington. It looks as
though it wasn't dislike for rugby that
drove the Berkeley team to American
football, but unwillingness to keep
on losing games to Stanford too fre
quently.
Don't you for a minute blame the
California student body. So far as
we have been able to learn, the stu
dents don't know very much about
the actions of their higher-ups. It's
only those few heads of things that
need abuse.
Well, you see we haven't the Big
Game this year. But we have the
finest rugby schedule that has ever
been prepared for a Stanford team.
Read it on another page. There's the
material for a hummer of a football
year. Those thirty or more prelimi
nary matches lead up to the Stanford-
Santa Clara game on November 13.
It's going to be a wonderful game,
and a hard one to win.
That's why you and all the rest of
the people around here are going to
inoculate yourselves with Stanford
Spirit tonight. We've got a great sea
son of sport ahead. We are sorry
not to have the California game, but
it can't put the lid on our fun.
There is more than speech-making
to be done at the rugby rally. There
must be recruits for the squadâ€”hun
dreds of them. Better than ever be
fore. Last year 239 signed up. This
year we are after the record.
Speed up!
