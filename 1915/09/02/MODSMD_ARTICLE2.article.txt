# Nineteen Green Succumbs To Sophomore Red on Turf
## Close Contest Ends Underclass Struggles for Year. 
### 
Sophomores won the annual under
class tie-up this afternoon on the
rugby turf, binding up the wearers of
the green only after one of the hard
est rush fights that Stanford has wit
nessed.
The clash ends all hostilities be
tween the underclassmen and marks
the opening of the era of study.
Hoth sophomores and freshmen as
sembled in full force, the former in
front of the Library, and the latter
near Encina. Moth classes marched
to the scene of battle with yells and
war songs, the freshmen arriving first
on the turf.
Referee Floyd Brown opened activ
ities, delivering the two fight hungry
aggregations over to each other at
four o'clock. For a time after the
initial charge the result seemed in
doubt as the superior numbers of the
freshmen gave them an advantage
almost equal to the familiarity of the
second year fieri with conflict. Expe
rience told the tale, though, and when
timers Danny Carroll and Joe Braden
ended the squabble, the sophomores
held the stronger claim to the field.
