# PEACE LEADERS HERE
## Conference on International Policy To Be Held 
### 
Doctor David Starr Jordan, Chan
cellor of the University, and two of
his colleagues in the cause of inter
national friendship, will hold forth
next Monday in a conference on war,
peace, and international polity, hnder
the auspices of the Stanford Interna
tional Polity Club. The sessions will
be held in the Botany Lecture Hall,
room 460, Zoology Building, at two
o'clock. Chancellor Jordan will give
the opening address, followed by Dr.
John Mez of the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace, and Louis P.
Lochner, central-west director of the
American Peace Society, who came to
Stanford at the invitation of Dr. Jor
dan. There will be daily sessions
throughout the week at 2 and 7:30
o'clock.
Among the topics to be discussed
are the following: "The Place of
Physical Force in Modern Society,"
"Economics of Modern International
ism," "The Problem of Armaments
and Preparedness," "The Japanese
Problem," "Biological Aspects of
War," "International Law and Arbi
tration," and "Militarism and Dem
ocracy.'
The central idea underlying these
conferences is that of affording the
students an opportunity for free dis
cussion of the international problems,
with a view to ascertaining by scien
tific inquiry the foundations that must
underlie more rational international
relations in the future.
Similar conferences were held dur
ing ecent months at thirty eastern and
middle western universities, and the
Stanford conference will be followed
by a week's discussion at f?erkeley.
Several members of the Stanford
faculty have agreed to lead the dis
cussion on specific topics. A detailed
program will be published tomorrow.
The sessions are open to all students
and members of the faculty.
