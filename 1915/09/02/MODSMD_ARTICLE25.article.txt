Interclass football started at Cali
fornia yesterday with games between
the senior and junior and between the
junior and sophomore elevens. The
seniors and sophomo.res have three
teams each, juniors have four and
the freshmen two.
Season tickets at California have
been sold to 2300 students this fall.
This number falls short of the num
ber issued last year by 325.
Ex-President Taft, speaking in the
G.reek Theatre Monday, gave the first
of his series of lectures on the Presi
dency. He dwelt particularly on the
necessity for economy in the admin
istration of the government.
A freshman weighing 350 pounds
has been excused from drill at Cali
fornia, because his unwieldiness
caused a bugle in the line which the
captain of Company P could not
straighten.
