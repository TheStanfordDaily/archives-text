# STANFORD ADVANCES SCHOLARSHIP LEVEL
## Athletes Seem More Intelligent In The Semesters of Active Participation In Sport 
### 
A comparison of the scholarship
statistics of last year with those of
the year before reveal many inter
esting and startling facts concerning
the work of the various orgainzations
in the university.
The general average of the entire
student body was one per cent higher
in the second semestr of the year
1914-15 than in the same time the
previous year. About the same in
crease was made in the general aver
ages of the men, women, sororities,
non-sororities, fraternities and non
fraternities for the same time.
Among the sororities some radical
changes may be noted. While Delta
Delta Delta maintained its usual high
standard, Alpha Omicron Pi, which wa
standard, Alpha Omicron Pi, which
was in the lead the first semester of
1913-14, dropped to last place during
the past semester. The Alpha Phis
came up to second place last semester,
although they were last the semester
previous.
In general the fraternities remain
about the same, with a few radical
changes. Alpha Tau Omega dropped
from third place the first semester of
1913-14 to twelfth the first semester
of last year, but jumped back to
fourth last semester. A decided im
provement was made by Delta Up
silon.
The women's clubs and miscellane
ous organizations remained about the
same. Among the men's clubs, how
ever, the improvement of the Chinese
club is most startling, as it jumped
from last place to first in one year.
Another surprising feature is the
high record of Phi Beta Kappa, which
leads the list of honor and profes
sional fraternities.
Strange to relate all the athletic
teams except crew have made a bet
ter record during the semester in
which they compete than when they
are not actively engaged in training.
The band is not least in the matter
of improvement, having now an aver
age far above that of the university
at large.
Although the personnel of the Quad
staff was entirely different from the
two years under consideration, it is
interesting to note that the scholar
ship of last year's staff was very high
in comparison to that of the year
before.
Cap and Gown, Quadrangle Club
and Skull and Snakes have retained
first, second and third places respec
tively, both years. Rams Head
dropped, from second to third place
among the three dramatic clubs, giv
ing way to Sword and Sandals last
semester.
