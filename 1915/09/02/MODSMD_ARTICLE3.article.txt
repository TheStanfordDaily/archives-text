# Fair Officials Attempt to Reconcile Two Universities
## Suggestion of Neutrals Incompatible With Stanford's Policy. 
### 
After news had been announced
that the Universities of Stanford and
California had broken off all athletic
relations, the Exposition officials real
ized that the possibilities of a big
game on the stadium at the Fair were
completely shattered, unless steps to
ward reconciliation could be consum
mated. The officials chose two very
well-known neutrals to accomplish
this plan—Governor Hiram Johnson
and Mr. William F. Humphrey, presi
dent of the Olympic Club. These two
men appointed the following alumni
of the two universities to represent
their respective colleges on the com
mittee—Messrs. Oscar Sutro, Scott
Hendricks, and William Donald of
California, and Messrs. Dudley Sales,
Alfred Trowbridge, and James Lana
gan, of Stanford.
This committee of eight met at the
Olympic Club in San Francisco dur
ing the second week of August. The
Exposition officials had considered
that the freshmen elimination ques
tion was the paramount issue in the
discussion, but the main hitch soon
resolved itself into a question of
rugby vs. the old game.
To quote from a statement of the
negotiations by James Lanagan: "The
governor and Mr. Humphrey, as
neutrals, suggested that the matter of
the discussion of the freshmen rule be
postponed for a year and that the big
game be held this year. Both of these
gentlemen suggested that American
football be played. On behalf of the
Stanford delegation, I agreed to sub
mit this proposition to you (i.e., Dr.
Angell, to whom the communication
is addressed)."
After some delay, Dr. Angell being
absent at the Science Association
meeting in San Francisco, reply
from the Stanford chairman of
the Faculty Committee on Athletics
came. The letter is very logical in
its treatment of the subject and bears
of reproduction in full:
"As you probably know, we at Stan
ford have been looking forward with
pleasure, to the prospect of an Expo
sition game of football to show the
country at large the game as played
in California. For in the eight years
the two northern California universi
ties have been playing Rugby football
they have acquired sufficient skill to
give a creditable exhibition of the
game, while the play itself has the
dramatic possibilities to it that makes
it interesting to all classes of spec
tators.
Proposal Surprising.
"I am therefore somewhat surprised
that with the possibility of a first
rate, thrilling, contest, the Fair offi
cials should be willing to countenance
a game, which at its best could be
only a mediocre exhiibtion of college
football and which at its worst imght
be ridiculous.
"I presume that the gentlemen pro
posing the college game are unaware,
that at Stanford it is not merely a
question of a preference for one game
or the other as such, but that the
Rugby game has developed as the
outcome of a general athletic policy
which has worked itself out to the
satisfaction of a great majority of
students and Faculty, and with this
policy the spirit and practice of the
college game are quite incompatible.
Temporary Concession.
"1 know, however, that the athletic
authorities at Stanford are desirous
to help as best they can toward mak
ing a success of the athletics of the
Fair and I would therefore suggest
the possibility of a compromise in
virtue of which California and Stan
ford play a game of Rugby football,
Stanford agreeing, for this game, to
exclude freshmen. I am, of course,
making no suggestion on my own
initiative, but I am of the opinion,
though I may be mistaken, that the
Stanford students, for the sake of
the Fair, would compromise the fresh
men situation to the extent suggested.
"In this way, California's objections
could be met and an exhibition of
football given at the Fair comparable
to the rest of the student program."
Firm Policy Necessary.
This letter bears the signature of
Dr. Angell. Of course, the suggestion
of the two neutrals, while highly ap
preciated, can not be followed out,
as being entirely prejudicial to the
athletic policy now pursued by the
members of the Stanford student body
and Faculty. Dr. Angell's conten
tions are all very logical and sin
cere. The arguments "speak for
themselves" and no further comment
is necessary. Of course, Governor
Johnson's adherence to the old game
is inspired by a motive that is purely
personal. This style of game held
forth on the campuses of California
when the Governor was a student at
the University of California, and it is
natural that he prefers the game of
his youth, but as has been said be
fore, such a personal preference can
have no influence on the program
adopted by the Stanford Faculty and
Student Body.

have no influence on the program
adopted by the Stanford Faculty and
Student Body.
After news had been announced
that the Universities of Stanford and
California had broken off all athletic
relations, the Exposition officials real
ized that the possibilities of a big
game on the stadium at the Fair were
completely shattered, unless steps to
ward reconciliation could be consum
mated. The officials chose two very
well-known neutrals to accomplish
this plan—Governor Hiram Johnson
and Mr. William F. Humphrey, presi
dent of the Olympic Club. These two
men appointed the following alumni
of the two universities to represent
their respective colleges on the com
mittee—Messrs. Oscar Sutro, Scott
Hendricks, and William Donald of
California, and Messrs. Dudley Sales,
Alfred Trowbridge, and James Lana
gan, of Stanford.
This committee of eight met at the
Olympic Club in San Francisco dur
ing the second week of August. The
Exposition officials had considered
that the freshmen elimination ques
tion was the paramount issue in the
discussion, but the main hitch soon
resolved itself into a question of
rugby vs. the old game.
To quote from a statement of the
negotiations by James Lanagan: "The
governor and Mr. Humphrey, as
neutrals, suggested that the matter of
the discussion of the freshmen rule be
postponed for a year and that the big
game be held this year. Both of these
gentlemen suggested that American
football be played. On behalf of the
Stanford delegation, I agreed to sub
mit this proposition to you (i.e., Dr.
Angell, to whom the communication
is addressed)."
After some delay, Dr. Angell being
absent at the Science Association
meeting in San Francisco, reply
from the Stanford chairman of
the Faculty Committee on Athletics
came. The letter is very logical in
its treatment of the subject and bears
of reproduction in full:
"As you probably know, we at Stan
ford have been looking forward with
pleasure, to the prospect of an Expo
sition game of football to show the
country at large the game as played
in California. For in the eight years
the two northern California universi
ties have been playing Rugby football
they have acquired sufficient skill to
give a creditable exhibition of the
game, while the play itself has the
dramatic possibilities to it that makes
it interesting to all classes of spec
tators.
Proposal Surprising.
"I am therefore somewhat surprised
that with the possibility of a first
rate, thrilling, contest, the Fair offi
cials should be willing to countenance
a game, which at its best could be
only a mediocre exhiibtion of college
football and which at its worst imght
be ridiculous.
"I presume that the gentlemen pro
posing the college game are unaware,
that at Stanford it is not merely a
question of a preference for one game
or the other as such, but that the
Rugby game has developed as the
outcome of a general athletic policy
which has worked itself out to the
satisfaction of a great majority of
students and Faculty, and with this
policy the spirit and practice of the
college game are quite incompatible.
Temporary Concession.
"1 know, however, that the athletic
authorities at Stanford are desirous
to help as best they can toward mak
ing a success of the athletics of the
Fair and I would therefore suggest
the possibility of a compromise in
virtue of which California and Stan
ford play a game of Rugby football,
Stanford agreeing, for this game, to
exclude freshmen. I am, of course,
making no suggestion on my own
initiative, but I am of the opinion,
though I may be mistaken, that the
Stanford students, for the sake of
the Fair, would compromise the fresh
men situation to the extent suggested.
"In this way, California's objections
could be met and an exhibition of
football given at the Fair comparable
to the rest of the student program."
Firm Policy Necessary.
This letter bears the signature of
Dr. Angell. Of course, the suggestion
of the two neutrals, while highly ap
preciated, can not be followed out,
as being entirely prejudicial to the
athletic policy now pursued by the
members of the Stanford student body
and Faculty. Dr. Angell's conten
tions are all very logical and sin
cere. The arguments "speak for
themselves" and no further comment
is necessary. Of course, Governor
Johnson's adherence to the old game
is inspired by a motive that is purely
personal. This style of game held
forth on the campuses of California
when the Governor was a student at
the University of California, and it is
