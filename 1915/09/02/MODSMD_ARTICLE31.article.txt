# Improvements Are Made In Post Office Service
## 
### 
G. E. Meekins, the Stanford Uni
versity postmaster, is offering the
college public a bettered service this
year as a result of changes in system
and new facilities, in spite of the fact
that there has been no addition to
h's staff.
The improvements are in the gen
eral delivery, letter box and parcel
post departments. Those dependent
upon the office will be allowed this
year to receive their mail through
the general delivery department all
of the time if they so wish. However,
a large dependency upon this de
partment necessarily means poorer
service.
The change to combination boxes
for fraternity houses was made be
cause of the rule of the Department
that keys should not be left about
public lobbies. One hundred and
twenty of the old boxes were removed
because they had become inefficient
as a result of key losses. The new
combination boxes may be obtained
at the same price as the old boxes,
i.e., sixty to seventy-five cents per
quarter.
For one cent extra postage on send
ing a parcel, the Post Office will give
a. receipt which will act as an insur
ance. Actual parcel post insurance
rates have been reduced and the al
lowable maximum value raised.
Although according to population,
we are entitled to delivery service,
the Department denies it because of
the comparatively transient character
of the fraternity house inhabitants.
