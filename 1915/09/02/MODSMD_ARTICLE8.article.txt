Cardinal rugby fans should sit up
and take notice when perusing the
athletic calendar for the fall semester
made public tbday by Graduate Man
ager E. C. Belirens. Although there
remain as yet a few open dates not
definitely filled, already over twenty
five different teams comprising a total
of nearly forty games are scheduled
in the above schedule.
Siinta Clara Looms Strong.
The big game of the season will be
played November 13 with the Uni
versity of Santa Clara. For the past
three weeks the mission ruggers have
been practicing under the able in
struction of Coach Ybarrando, mem
ber of the All-American rugby team.
Enthusiasm is running high at the
nearby institution with the return of
more than a dozen star veterans. Sev
eral of the men who played on the
1913 whirlwind fifteen have returned
into the fold. In addition the atli

letic authorities have set out a new
turf field, which compares favorably
with any football grounds 011 the
coast. To remind the local fans of
the strength of Santa Clara, one
should recall the hard-fought 13 to 0
victory of last season, and the defeat
administered in 1912 by a 15 to 10
count. Also one should remember
California's defeat by the same aggre
gation in 1913.
»>v Competitor.
Several new clubs will be seen
among the opposition made familiar
during last season's play. The chief
of these is the Palo Alto Athletic Club,
which bids fair to equal if not surpass
the Olympic Club in strength. The
line-up includes well-known men like
Lachmund, Stolz, Risling Wallace,
Thoburn, and O'Laine (captain), be
sides many other players of like
caliber.
Two and three game series have
also been arranged with the Barbar
ian, Titan, and Olympic clubs. The
commissioner in charge states that
they will put the strongest teams in
their athletic history onto the field as
more men than ever before have an
swered to the call for players.
Freshmen Meet Many Teams.
The freshmen schedule for this sea
son may be said to surpass those of
former years, as high schools from
all over the state have been secured
as opposition. Up until October 16
two games a week have been ar
ranged for the first year ruggers with
schools chiefly around the Peninsula
and San Francisco. A post-season
with the northern, central and south
ern high school champions is almost
an assured fact. This will mean that
fast preparatory fifteens on the order
of Woodlands, Berkeley, Pomona, and
Manual Arts will be seen on the
campus.
This season's schedule has been ar
ranged so as to include games at
home and in foreign fields for four
Stanford teams, a feature in local
rugby. The varsity, freshmen, second
varsity, and Greys comprise the four
aggregations. In addition, of course,
the socalled Peanut League plans to
keep your fifteens on the field. The
total of eight teams should give every
candidate a fair chance for honors on
the gridiron.
Few Veterans Hack.
When the Stanford fan looks over
the small array of veterans and sub
stitutes back on the farm this fall,
and at the same time bears in mind
the powerful team that Santa Clara
promises to put onto the field, all con
fident predictions of a walk-away vic
tory over the missionites on Novem
ber 13 become mere atmosphere. Not
that the varsity will not whip a strong
team into shape, but a long season of
hard work and a large number of
candidates will be necessary to suc
cessfully meet the final opposition.
The loss suffered in the pack by
graduation and non-return to univer
sity is severe. Clover, Wines, and
Hall, front-rankers, are among the
missing. Soper's return, however,
should be a great help. Two powerful
middle-rankers have registered in the
persons of Rehm and Pettingill. Jim
Wylie is the only breakaway remain
ing, Deke Card having secured his
sheepskin. Jacomini, Halsted, and
McEuen are back among the forwards.
The wonderful backfield, which
made a name for its speed and re
markable team work, has scattered
to the four winds with two exceptions.
Captain Danny Carroll at center
three-quarters, and Joe Urban at
wing. There yet seems a chance that
Art Erb may register. Frank Walker,
Swigart, and Templeton are three
sterling substitutes.
When everything is considered.
Coach Floyd Brown seems assured of
no light task. Yet with a half dozen
powerful veterans, a number of good
substitutes, plenty of untried material
plus a splendid captain, Stanford be
fore many weeks are over will be
boasting of her usual powerful team.

Several new clubs will be seen
among the opposition made familiar
during last season's play. The chief
of these is the Palo Alto Athletic Club,
which bids fair to equal if not surpass
the Olympic Club in strength. The
line-up includes well-known men like
Lachmund, Stolz, Risling Wallace,
Thoburn, and O'Laine (captain), be
sides many other players of like
caliber.
Two and three game series have
also been arranged with the Barbar
ian, Titan, and Olympic clubs. The
commissioner in charge states that
they will put the strongest teams in
their athletic history onto the field as
more men than ever before have an
swered to the call for players.
Freshmen Meet Many Teams.
The freshmen schedule for this sea
son may be said to surpass those of
former years, as high schools from
all over the state have been secured
as opposition. Up until October 16
two games a week have been ar
ranged for the first year ruggers with
schools chiefly around the Peninsula
and San Francisco. A post-season
with the northern, central and south
ern high school champions is almost
an assured fact. This will mean that
fast preparatory fifteens on the order
of Woodlands, Berkeley, Pomona, and
Manual Arts will be seen on the
campus.
This season's schedule has been ar
ranged so as to include games at
home and in foreign fields for four
Stanford teams, a feature in local
rugby. The varsity, freshmen, second
varsity, and Greys comprise the four
aggregations. In addition, of course,
the socalled Peanut League plans to
keep your fifteens on the field. The
total of eight teams should give every
candidate a fair chance for honors on
the gridiron.
Few Veterans Hack.
When the Stanford fan looks over
the small array of veterans and sub
stitutes back on the farm this fall,
and at the same time bears in mind
the powerful team that Santa Clara
promises to put onto the field, all con
fident predictions of a walk-away vic
tory over the missionites on Novem
ber 13 become mere atmosphere. Not
that the varsity will not whip a strong
team into shape, but a long season of
hard work and a large number of
candidates will be necessary to suc
cessfully meet the final opposition.
The loss suffered in the pack by
graduation and non-return to univer
sity is severe. Clover, Wines, and
Hall, front-rankers, are among the
missing. Soper's return, however,
should be a great help. Two powerful
middle-rankers have registered in the
persons of Rehm and Pettingill. Jim
Wylie is the only breakaway remain
ing, Deke Card having secured his
sheepskin. Jacomini, Halsted, and
McEuen are back among the forwards.
The wonderful backfield, which
made a name for its speed and re
markable team work, has scattered
to the four winds with two exceptions.
Captain Danny Carroll at center
three-quarters, and Joe Urban at

no light task. Yet with a half dozen

The loss suffered in the pack by

Cardinal rugby fans should sit up
and take notice when perusing the
athletic calendar for the fall semester
made public tbday by Graduate Man
ager E. C. Belirens. Although there
remain as yet a few open dates not
definitely filled, already over twenty
five different teams comprising a total
of nearly forty games are scheduled
in the above schedule.
Siinta Clara Looms Strong.
The big game of the season will be
played November 13 with the Uni
versity of Santa Clara. For the past
three weeks the mission ruggers have
been practicing under the able in
struction of Coach Ybarrando, mem
ber of the All-American rugby team.
Enthusiasm is running high at the
nearby institution with the return of
more than a dozen star veterans. Sev
eral of the men who played on the
1913 whirlwind fifteen have returned
into the fold. In addition the atli

letic authorities have set out a new
turf field, which compares favorably
with any football grounds 011 the
coast. To remind the local fans of
the strength of Santa Clara, one
should recall the hard-fought 13 to 0
victory of last season, and the defeat
administered in 1912 by a 15 to 10
count. Also one should remember
California's defeat by the same aggre
gation in 1913.
»>v Competitor.
Several new clubs will be seen
among the opposition made familiar
during last season's play. The chief
of these is the Palo Alto Athletic Club,
which bids fair to equal if not surpass
the Olympic Club in strength. The
line-up includes well-known men like
Lachmund, Stolz, Risling Wallace,
Thoburn, and O'Laine (captain), be
sides many other players of like
caliber.
Two and three game series have
also been arranged with the Barbar
ian, Titan, and Olympic clubs. The
commissioner in charge states that
they will put the strongest teams in
their athletic history onto the field as
more men than ever before have an
swered to the call for players.
Freshmen Meet Many Teams.
The freshmen schedule for this sea
son may be said to surpass those of
former years, as high schools from
all over the state have been secured
as opposition. Up until October 16
two games a week have been ar
ranged for the first year ruggers with
schools chiefly around the Peninsula
and San Francisco. A post-season
with the northern, central and south
ern high school champions is almost
an assured fact. This will mean that
fast preparatory fifteens on the order
of Woodlands, Berkeley, Pomona, and
Manual Arts will be seen on the
campus.
This season's schedule has been ar
ranged so as to include games at
home and in foreign fields for four
Stanford teams, a feature in local
rugby. The varsity, freshmen, second
varsity, and Greys comprise the four
aggregations. In addition, of course,
the socalled Peanut League plans to
keep your fifteens on the field. The
total of eight teams should give every
candidate a fair chance for honors on
the gridiron.
Few Veterans Hack.
When the Stanford fan looks over
the small array of veterans and sub
stitutes back on the farm this fall,
and at the same time bears in mind
the powerful team that Santa Clara
promises to put onto the field, all con
fident predictions of a walk-away vic
tory over the missionites on Novem
ber 13 become mere atmosphere. Not
that the varsity will not whip a strong
team into shape, but a long season of
hard work and a large number of
candidates will be necessary to suc
cessfully meet the final opposition.
