Cardinal rugby fans should sit up
and take notice when perusing the
athletic calendar for the fall semester
made public tbday by Graduate Man
ager E. C. Belirens. Although there
remain as yet a few open dates not
definitely filled, already over twenty
five different teams comprising a total
of nearly forty games are scheduled
in the above schedule.
Siinta Clara Looms Strong.
The big game of the season will be
played November 13 with the Uni
versity of Santa Clara. For the past
three weeks the mission ruggers have
been practicing under the able in
struction of Coach Ybarrando, mem
ber of the All-American rugby team.
Enthusiasm is running high at the
nearby institution with the return of
more than a dozen star veterans. Sev
eral of the men who played on the
1913 whirlwind fifteen have returned
into the fold. In addition the atli

letic authorities have set out a new
turf field, which compares favorably
with any football grounds 011 the
coast. To remind the local fans of
the strength of Santa Clara, one
should recall the hard-fought 13 to 0
victory of last season, and the defeat
administered in 1912 by a 15 to 10
count. Also one should remember
California's defeat by the same aggre
gation in 1913.
»>v Competitor.
Several new clubs will be seen
among the opposition made familiar
during last season's play. The chief
of these is the Palo Alto Athletic Club,
which bids fair to equal if not surpass
the Olympic Club in strength. The
line-up includes well-known men like
Lachmund, Stolz, Risling Wallace,
Thoburn, and O'Laine (captain), be
sides many other players of like
caliber.
