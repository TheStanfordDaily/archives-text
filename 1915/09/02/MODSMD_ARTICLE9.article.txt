# A 						CROWDED CALENDAR
## May Cause Postponement of of Student Assembly 
### 
That a postponement of the first
student body assembly of the semes
ter. usually held on the Tuesday afte.r
registration, may be necessary on ac
count of the crowded calendar, is very
l kely unless the Faculty committee
on public exercises at its meeting
tomorrow sanctions the holding of
two assemblies in one week. The
Tuesday following registration is the
customary date for the holding of the
initial student body gathering. On
that date, however, at 10:15, President
Branner will greet entering men and
women at the welcoming assambly.
Unless the holding of a student
body gathering the same week as the
welcoming assembly is satisfactory to
the faculty, the student meeting will
have to be postponed two weeks, inas
much as the calendar for the week of
September 13 schedules a Tuesday
assembly at which ex-President Taft
will be the speaker.
President Branner will introduce
Dr. Edward Capps, professor of
Classical Philology at Princeton, who
will speak on a subject to be an
nounced later. Dr. Capps is a grad
uate of Illinois and later received a
degree of Ph. D. at Yale, and LL. D.
at Illinois. In 1906 and 1007 he was
editor of "Classical Philology". He
will be a guest of Dr. Branner while
at Stanford.
Student body executive, P. R. Wil
son. '16, will confer with the faculty
committee in an endeavor to secure
a morning hour in which to acquaint
those new to Stanford with student
control and to discuss the important
issues of the day.
