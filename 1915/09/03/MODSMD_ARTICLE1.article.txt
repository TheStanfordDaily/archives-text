## Accompanied By O.H. Castle, '14, He Visits Texas, Arizona and Eastern States THOUSANDS HEAR HIM SPEAK 
### 
Chancellor's Jordan's two months'
trip throughout the United States im
mediately following the Stanford
commencement was one continuous
ovation. As usual, the Chancellor
was given a reception on a par with
those tendered United States presi
dents. He was elaborately enter
tained by the most notable and influ
ential citizens and organizations of
the places at which he stopped and
at stations he was met by large
crowds.
Immediately following Senior Week,
with O. H. Castle, '14, as his secre
tary, he set out for Texas at the invi
tation of Congressman Slayden of
that state. He spoke at mass meet
ings in all of the large cities, at
boards of trade and at colleges.
Visits Portland.
The route then led back through
California to Portland, where ad
dresses were delivered before the
national convention of the Associa
tion of Women's Clubs, the Chamber
of Commerce, the teachers of Port
land, the University Club, and the
Progressive Business Men's Club.
Everywhere he was royally enter
tained.
From here the Chancellor jour
neyed to Minneapolis where he de
livered the commencement address at
Hamline University. A number of
speeches were delivered in the city
of Milwaukee. Doctor Jordan then
spoke at the commencement of the
Wisconsin State Normal at River
Falls.
At Richmond, Indiana, he talked
under the auspices of Earlham Col
lege. Here one of the most elaborate
entertainments possible was tendered
the Chancellor by the Honorable Dud
ley Foulke, the first man to introduce
a civil service bill in any legislative
body in the United States.
Receives Degree.
The commencement address at the
Women's College of Western Reserve
University, at Cleveland, Ohio, was
then delivered by Doctor Jordan. At
the commencement of the Men's Col
lege of this university he was given
the LL. D. degree. Others who were
given this degree at the same time
were Myron T. Herrick, ex-governor
of Ohio and formerly ambassador to
France; Samuel Eliot, president of the
Unitarian Association and son of
Charles Eliot, formerly President of
Harvard; and Doctor Sarolea, of Ed
inburgh University, a brilliant Bel
gium writer and professor.
After the commencement ceremonies
these men were entertained by Presi
dent Charles F. Thwing, of Western
Reserve. Present at the entertain
ment was James A. McDonald, editor
of the Toronto Globe, who is probably
the most brilliant orator in North
America today and who will be re
membered at Stanford by his address
here in 1911.
The schedule of the Chancellor
then took him to Michigan where he
gave several large addresses in De
troit and Grand Rapids and delivered
the commencement address at the
Michigan State Agricultural College.
Travels South.
Next a series of talks were given
before the two large normal schools
of Oklahoma and the University of
Oklahoma.
Speeches were made in Denver,
Colorado, at the opening of the Boul
der Chautauqua Association, and a
series of addresses were given before
the Colorado State Normal at Greeley.
At all of these places Stanford men
turned out to entertain their former
president and university clubs and
prominent men vied with each other
in offering him the best that the land
afforded.
