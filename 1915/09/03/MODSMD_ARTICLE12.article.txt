Tea wasn't served at the rugby .rally
last night, and the men who spoke
didn't ask for an accompaniment of
soft music. They just talked, and
they passed the buck up to us so hard
that no one had a chance to side
step. The words of the prophet have
come to pass, and Stanford has seen
the light.
Two hundred and eighty men are
waiting to report to Coach Brown for
the first practice tomorrow aftenoon.
Just pass it around in a whisper that
the record for football recuiting on
the Pacific Coast has been cracked
in a dozen places.
Before last evening we were all
pulling along pretty well together,—
with the exception of the person who
mailed some cards from Salt Lake
during the summer and forgot to at
tach his name, and some others of
a similar anonymous disposition. To
day and hereafter we are making it
unanimous for rugby, and for a good
fight.
Something better than 1500 men and
women are going to play bleacher
athletics to a fare-thee-well, and the
fire-side squads are going to congre
gate regularly to talk it over. All of
the men who erowded the Union last
night must have picked up a few
new ideas about sportsmanship, and
the other thing, and the death of
rugby „ football.
A few of us have thought ever since
we were freshmen that the Stanford
Spirit never came down to earth ex
cept when the Golden Bear growled.
Well, it didn't appear drooping last
night, and Berkeley was fo.rty miles
away. But it will be great to see that,
crowd of fellows take the field tomor
row afternoon at 3:30.
