# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
All customs are not worth
upholding, but to give up even
those which are childish and
harmful is one of the hardest
things in the world, and needs
a considerable amount of cour
age and broadmindedness. Has
the class of '18 the courage to
break a tradition—a bad tradi
tion? I refer to the systematic
persecution of freshmen by
sophomores and the ridiculous
class war it generates?
There will be, 1 know, the
usual number of scoffers who
will laugh at the idea of chang
ing anything; such persons
have always existed in every
community, and always will.
There will also be a few who
disagree with this protest be
cause they seriously believe
that the system of student tyr
anny is not only not foolish
but actually beneficial. It if
difficult to realize that such
persons exist in a so-called en
lightened community, but it has
been my misfortune to meet
them personally. With the
"Alligator Club", also, this will
find no sympathy. Whether
this organization exists this
year 1 am not certain, but let
those who have never heard of
it find out what it is, and ask
themselves if they are proud
of it.
Now as to the method which
the sophomore uses to "teach
the freshman his place", most
people who stop to consider the
matter will own that it is cruel,
primitive, and disgusting. A
great number of the women of
this university hardly realize
the extremes to which "tub
bing" is carried. They think
the word is a synonym for
"ducking", and many of them
are horrified when they learn
that it is neither more nor less
than partial drowning with all
its attendant agony and ensu
ing exhaustion—a form of tor
ture well known, and much
used, in the Spanish inquisition.
It is, indeed, hard to believe
that our men in a great uni
versity, in a free country, de
liberately inflict Inquisition
tortures upon one another, and
varnish over the shame and
brutality of it with the expres
sions "fun", "college life", "all
in the day's work", "makes
men of them", et cetera. If
college cannot make men —and
worth-while men—without such
processes, let us call university
education a failure.
Is not there another and bet
ter way to "teach the freshman
his place"- Isn't it the busi
ness—the duty—of those who
are already in the college to
welcome the newcomers, to try
to make them feel at home, to
treat them like gentlemen in
stead of wild beasts, upstarts
and intruders, to try and make
things pleasant for them in
stead of setting out to make
thetr first year a misery- Treat
them like gentlemen and per
haps they will behave as such.
It is the usual result, and why
should college be different from
the rest of the world?
At any rate, cannot we try
it? What the class of '18 does
the classes of the future will
do. Class of '18, have you the
courage to break the tradition?

community, and always will.
There will also be a few who
disagree with this protest be
cause they seriously believe
that the system of student tyr
anny is not only not foolish
but actually beneficial. It if
difficult to realize that such
persons exist in a so-called en
lightened community, but it has
been my misfortune to meet
them personally. With the
"Alligator Club", also, this will
find no sympathy. Whether
this organization exists this
year 1 am not certain, but let
those who have never heard of
it find out what it is, and ask
themselves if they are proud
of it.
Now as to the method which
the sophomore uses to "teach
the freshman his place", most
people who stop to consider the
matter will own that it is cruel,
primitive, and disgusting. A
great number of the women of
this university hardly realize
the extremes to which "tub
bing" is carried. They think
the word is a synonym for
"ducking", and many of them
are horrified when they learn
that it is neither more nor less
than partial drowning with all
its attendant agony and ensu
ing exhaustion—a form of tor
ture well known, and much
used, in the Spanish inquisition.
It is, indeed, hard to believe
that our men in a great uni
versity, in a free country, de
liberately inflict Inquisition
tortures upon one another, and
varnish over the shame and
brutality of it with the expres
sions "fun", "college life", "all
in the day's work", "makes
men of them", et cetera. If
college cannot make men —and
worth-while men—without such
processes, let us call university
education a failure.
Is not there another and bet
ter way to "teach the freshman
his place"- Isn't it the busi
ness—the duty—of those who
are already in the college to
welcome the newcomers, to try
to make them feel at home, to
treat them like gentlemen in
stead of wild beasts, upstarts
and intruders, to try and make
things pleasant for them in
stead of setting out to make
thetr first year a misery- Treat
them like gentlemen and per
haps they will behave as such.
It is the usual result, and why
should college be different from
the rest of the world?
At any rate, cannot we try
it? What the class of '18 does
the classes of the future will
do. Class of '18, have you the
courage to break the tradition?
MISS '18.
All customs are not worth
upholding, but to give up even
those which are childish and
harmful is one of the hardest
things in the world, and needs
a considerable amount of cour
age and broadmindedness. Has
the class of '18 the courage to
break a tradition—a bad tradi
tion? I refer to the systematic
persecution of freshmen by
sophomores and the ridiculous
class war it generates?
There will be, 1 know, the
usual number of scoffers who
will laugh at the idea of chang
ing anything; such persons
have always existed in every
community, and always will.
