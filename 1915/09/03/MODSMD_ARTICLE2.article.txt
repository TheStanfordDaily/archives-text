# FALL BASEBALL BEGUN
## Excellent New Material Out For Diamond Practice 
### 
Fall baseball began today when
Captain Babe Dent spoke to the crowd
of aspirants at the Union this after
noon. The plan for the fall work
includes the formation of a new "pea
nut league" to consist of four teams,
the Reds, Blacks, Whites and Blues.
These will be under the personal di
rection of the following varsity men:
Stafford, Reds; Noonan, Blacks;
Hayes, Whites; Hoever, Blues.
A schedule of three games a week
has been arranged, making a total of
twenty-four games in the race for
the pennant.
The league will have the use of
the varsity and auxiliary diamonds
and some real ball should be devel
oped in the course of the season.
Batting and fielding averages will
be kept and it is possible that a cup
may be offered to the non-varsity man
holding the best all-around average.
All men who did not sign up this
afternoon are requested to hand in
their names to either Woobles Staf
ford or Roc Hayes at the Zeta Psi
house before Monday. That day the
Peanut League will be in full swing,
the Blues meeting the Rpds on auxil
iary diamond, whHe the Whites cross
bats with the Blacks on varsity field.
This afternoon Captain Dent ex
pressed himself as well pleased with
the turn-out, especially the number
of men who will vie for honors on
the diamond. He predicts bright
prospects for a winning nine.
