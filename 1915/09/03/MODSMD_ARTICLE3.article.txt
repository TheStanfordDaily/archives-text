It may take a brave man to
Start proceedings, but then

he holds. And it's a cinch that
follow the leader will be the
same once somebody starts the
ball .rolling. Not exactly a ball,
because dancing on Sunday in
Palo Alto Is almost as naughty
ias rowing on Sunday on the
Hudson. But there's a good
rollicky piano that can be used,
and some cards and chips, and
pool and billiard tables that
may be used, easy chairs and
lounges that may be used, a
cigar stand that may or not be
used, magazines, some of which
may be used, —all of which re
fers to day after tomorrow.
When the Stanford Union for
the first time throws open its
doors to the Stanford man and
the guest who may be 1/500, or
if courage is there, 1/250 of the
Five Hundred. Next Sunday,
and every Sunday thereafter—
the Stanford Union for Stanford
men and women.
