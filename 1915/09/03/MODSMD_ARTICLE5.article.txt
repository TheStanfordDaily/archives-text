# ROUSING RALLY INITIATES 1915 RUGBY SEASON Speakers Insist On Independence of California Two Hundred and Eighty Students Will Attend First Practice
## 
### 
Last night the 1915 football season
was given a send-off that displays all
the earmarks of sliding along the top
rafters of success, when viewed from
most any standpoint. Several min
utes before Johnny Goodman let some
of the pent-up enthusiasm escape in
a howling "siren", there had become
a premium on standing room. When
at the close of festivities two hundred
and eighty men signified their inten
tion of donning rubgy garb, all pre
vious sign-up records were lost in the

brilliant trail of last night's comet.
Stanford spirit after once bubbling
over, ran high throughout the even
ing. Such speeches have ra.rely been
given, and rarely greeted with such
a hurst of support. To those who for
some reason were unable to be pres
ent, just glance ove.r the live, earnest
talks made by live, earnest Stanford
men.
The words of Doctor Angell are of
special significance, due to two rea
sons: first, for the past twenty years

he has been the most active member
of the faculty interested in intercol
legiate sport; and second, he is
known always to have been fair
minded and in thorough touch with
the situation. His speech teemed
with vigor:
"I'm sorry Jimmie Lannigan is not
here. He is the best coach on the
Pacilc Coast, thereby making his sen
timents of great interest to you. If
he were present now, he would say:
'Fight! Don't let California slip it

over on you.' Gentlemen, I say the
same thing: Fight.
Trieky Leaders.
The California student body is not
at fault. It is the same as the Stan
ford student body, with the identical
human traits. Rut the leaders of the
two student bodies are not the same.
Indeed there is a pronounced differ
ence. Here if you should sound a
long howl either on the Row or at
Encina, in a half hour two-thirds of


Doctor Frank Angell.

the student body would be a unit.
California must use the long distance <
telephone to raise her public opinion.
Students everywhere as at Stan
ford are led by a few leaders. We
claim, however, that student opinion
is more concentrated in our leaders.
1 wish to make no indictment against
the California student body.
Policy of Deceit.
But I wish to make a very serious
indictment against their leaders. In
the past, you remember, the alumni
especially, that I always have re
frained from saying anything unkind
ly against California. Now I must
speak. I feel that the men in charge
of athletics at California deliberately
and with full understanding tried to
deceive us. They have pursued a de
cidedly underhanded policy. Do you
mean to say that their leaders are
'trying to cleanse athletics'? I sup
pose when they played seventeen men 1
against fifteen, and again sixteen
against fifteen during the last two
years they were attempting to cleanse |
athletics. Also in the high and broad
jump during the intercollegiate track
meet they were doing some more
cleansing.
On tlie Side.
As a last resort this summer when
the annual big game between the two
universities seemed doomed, Presi
dent Wheeler of California asked
President Branner to confer with him
in an effort to settle the points at
issue. In the mean time more secret
negotiations were going on with
Washington, with U. S. C. as the in
termediary.
Gentlemen, 'fight' is the best method
to meet trickery and deceit. And I
pledge myself to keep up this fight
to the utmost!"
Husky Guerena, '11, coach of the
crew that won such signal honors in
the Poughkeepsie .regatta followed
Doctor Angell on the evening's pro
gram. The little coxcwain maintained
it was "a year or opportunity."
Omit Flowers.
"This seems to me to be a unique
rally, starting things off when there
is no big game. But fellows, shed no
tears, omit the flowers, and win a
moral victory over California for
greater than anything that can be
accomplished on the football field.
The cry arises from California that
Stanford has made ultimatums. They
insinuate that we would not stop at
any tactics to win. If either of the
two institutions takes such an atti
tude, then surely it is California.
California possess greater prestige
because of greater attendance, and
larger gate receipts from games
played on their campus.
On Our Own Feet.
So now this is the year of opportu
nity for Stanford. We can show them
we have not basked in the Berkeley
light. Good, clean athletics have
made our name, and our athletics will
continue clean. Now it is up to you.
The faculty will fight. The alumni
will fight. Now it is for you to show
that you are independent and can
flourish.
It is now up to each man to get in
and fight, and then the things that I
have predicted will surely come to
pass."
Hugby Status.
Doc Burbank, '09, one of the most
able and popular graduate managers
of the past, and also member of the
intercollegiate agreement committee
with California, presented a vivid ac
count of the present status of rugby
in the state of California. He also
compared the financial conditions and
interest in football as they are
being evinced at both Stanford and
California.
"The rugby situation of today may
be viewed from two standpoints—
general and particular. Let's first
take a look at the general outlook.
Rugby is not dead. It isn't even sick.
When stopping to analyze the condi
tion we find that north of the Te
hachipi, rugby is the only game
played in the past ten years. Ameri
can football is confined to two high
schools. Only fifty men in the state
of California know the rules of the
old game. Only one club of all the
clubs in the state have changed, and
that as a matter of course is the Uni
versity of California Club.
Ifigli School Stand.
South of the Tehachipi, we find only
three high schools have changed, and
those were compelled to do so by their
vice-principals, or other old game
men, not voluntarily. In fact the situ
ation in the south is every bit as
good as before.
The carefully conducted newspaper
propaganda carried on by California
does not present the actual facts as
regards public opinion. The players
represent the facts, and they want
rugby, as evidenced by the situation
in Los Angeles high school.
A Big Season.
As regards the particular situation.
Stanford is going to have a cracker
jack preliminary season. On the
other hand California is playing the
greatest game of poker ever tried.
It is well-n'gh impossible for them to
make such a season as they have
planned either financially satisfactory
or satisfactory to the students. Stan
ford. besides a record number of prac
tice games has a big game. And let
me tell you right now, they are going
to make you rustle. They are out
to win and continue in a class of
higher rated athletics. This should
lip a wonderful game and make lots
I of money.
Now stand pat and finish what you
have undertaken. I know that, if
| there 's a black sheep among you, he
I would be called a quitter and spotted,
j If you stand firm California must
lireak and come to you. Show nerve
due to a Stanford man as Stanford
honor is in your hands."

P. L. Wilson, '16, president of the
Associated Students, in a brief talk
urged the men to stand by their guns.
Concerning Yellow.
"You have been told tonight how
things stand. Any idea now to go
back to the old game in the students
is a yellow streak. Any arguments in
its favor by this time have been re
futed. The Stanford crew has shown
what it could do. It is the best in
the United States. Our track team
this year boasted of a world record
bolder in the hurdles.
You will do everything you can.
If there is any fellow here who is a
quitter he ought to leave. At any rate
we can take a licking—and that's one
thing California has shown us she
can't do."
Danny Carroll, '16. who will lead
the varsity this fall, spoke a ifew
words on the subject of football that
were right to the point.
Santa Cliini Game.
"It is going to be a mighty hard
job to beat Santa Clara on November
13. You know that they have always
produced a bunch of fighters and that
they are worthy of our steel. In 1912
they won a 14 to 10 game from us,
and last season it was the hardest
fight of the year that we ran up
against. California is now trying to
buy over colleges to her game.
I hope every one will sign up to
night who possibly can. Every place
on the varsity is vacant, and all men
have an equal chance."
Coach Floyd Brown concluded the
rally with predictions of rough wat
ers. if Stanford anticipates a victory
over Santa Clara.
First Practice.
"Our first practice will he at 3:30
Saturday afternoon. During week
nights practice will commence at 4:45.
This season will be conducted exactly
as those in the past.
This year presents no easy task.
Those who saw us play Santa Clara
last fall rralize what a tough propo
sition we are up against. He pre
pared to give your best. There will
be times when everything seems to
go wrong. Then don't drop the bur
den. but go all the harder.

It is a critical season for rugby.
Everybody must stand behind the
game. If there is a man here who
feels that we have made a mistake,
i
that man has no right to be called a
Stanford man."
