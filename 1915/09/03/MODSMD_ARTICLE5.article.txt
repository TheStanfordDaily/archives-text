# ROUSING RALLY INITIATES 1915 RUGBY SEASON Speakers Insist On Independence of California Two Hundred and Eighty Students Will Attend First Practice
## 
### 
Last night the 1915 football season
was given a send-off that displays all
the earmarks of sliding along the top
rafters of success, when viewed from
most any standpoint. Several min
utes before Johnny Goodman let some
of the pent-up enthusiasm escape in
a howling "siren", there had become
a premium on standing room. When
at the close of festivities two hundred
and eighty men signified their inten

brilliant trail of last night's comet.
Stanford spirit after once bubbling
over, ran high throughout the even

talks made by live, earnest Stanford
men.
The words of Doctor Angell are of
special significance, due to two rea
sons: first, for the past twenty years

he has been the most active member
of the faculty interested in intercol
legiate sport; and second, he is
known always to have been fair
minded and in thorough touch with
the situation. His speech teemed
with vigor:
"I'm sorry Jimmie Lannigan is not
here. He is the best coach on the
Pacilc Coast, thereby making his sen
timents of great interest to you. If
he were present now, he would say:
'Fight! Don't let California slip it

over on you.' Gentlemen, I say the
same thing: Fight.
Trieky Leaders.
The California student body is not
at fault. It is the same as the Stan
ford student body, with the identical
human traits. Rut the leaders of the
two student bodies are not the same.
Indeed there is a pronounced differ
ence. Here if you should sound a
long howl either on the Row or at
Encina, in a half hour two-thirds of


Doctor Frank Angell.
