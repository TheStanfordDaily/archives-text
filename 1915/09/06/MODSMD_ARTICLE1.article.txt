# WELCOMING ASSEMBLY PLANNED FOR 11:15 TOMORROW
## PRINCETONIAN WILL BE HEARD University Enrollment Exceeds Hall Capacity----Students Advised to Come Early 
### 
Eleven-fifteen tomorrow morning is
the time set for the first university
assembly of the semester. At that
time President Branner will extend a
welcome to t hose who have come
again to the Farm, and to those who
have decided to learn the turns and
traditions of Stanford.
President Rranner will introduce
Dr. Edward Capps, professor of Clas
sical Philology at Princeton Univer
sity. Dr. Capps has chosen as the
subject of his address, "The Reluctant
Student", a subject that should be of
interest to all who are more or less
human.
The old maxim to "come early and
thereby eliminate the rush" will be
in effect tomo.rrow. It is imperative
that those desirous of obtaining seats
come to the assembly immediately
upon the adjournment of the 10:15
hour. Tickets will not be required
for admission, but a count will be kept
of those entering. The seating ca
pacity of the auditorium is 1694, a
number several hundred smaller than
the student and faculty enrollment.
State law and faculty ruling will not
permit admissions to exceed seating
capacity. Unless the suggestion to
accommodate 150 on the stage is car
ried out, 1694 will be the limit of
attendance.
