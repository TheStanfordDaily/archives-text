# STUDENT IS FUTURE LEADER
## "Responsibility Goes With Education," Says Dr. Merrill 
### 
"What manne,r of persons ought you
to be in all holy living and godliness,
set, as you are, where a whole race
looks to you for light, leadership and
spiritual strength?" This was the
question Ur. Merrill asked of the stu
dents yesterday morning in Memorial
church.
Clearly and forcibly D.r. Merrill
pointed out that the American college
student of today, will be called upon
to play the leading part in the work
of reconstruction and redemption
when the war is over.
After urging the students to train
themselves conscientiously in their
years of college training D.r. Merrill
said: "To use your years of prepara
tion, your privilege of higher educa
tion for anything else or other than
for the best possible fitting of yourself
for the highest possible service is to
steal trust funds.
"America will have, when the war
is over, such powers and opportuni
ties as no other land will possess.
The leading nations of the world will
be impoverished in money and man
hood, and cursed with a lingering hate
more ter.rible to bear than their bur
dens of debt. What the countries will
need are the ideals and principles
which form the heritage of America.
"Therefore," demanded Dr. Merrill,
"there is urgent need that all over
this land there should be a re-birth of
true Americanism, a new outspoken
loyalty to the great ideals of this
country.
"It is as if the great leaders of the
past were looking to you alone to
carry forth their work. * * * Com
petition, for the time, is removed.
There is no one to do the work if you
fail."
D.r. Merrill is the pastor of the
Brick Presbyterian church, on Fifth
avenue, New York City. An unusu
ally large congregation attended,
Memorial Church being completely
filled.
