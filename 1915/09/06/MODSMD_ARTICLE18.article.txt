# FIRST RUGBY PRACTICE PLEASES DEVOTEES OF THE GAME
## FRESHMEN ARE HUSKY SQUAD Old Veterans View Seasonal Outlook With Greatest Encouragement 
### 
Close to two hundred recruits and
veterans rushed onto the field for the
initial rugby practice of the season,
held Saturday afternoon. From this
squad and additional men who come
out to swell it will be picked in the
next month and a half, the Stanford
varsity, the All-Blacks, the Greys, and
the Freshmen teams.
Saturday's practice was marked by
willingness on the part of everybody
present, including the new men out,
to do anything that would increase
the Cardinal rugby strength.' The
men in football suits went through
work-outs in snappy fashion, while a
sco.re of others kept from actual
practice by dilapidated physiques due
to rushes, fights, and other things that
go with a new term, watched and
wished they were out.
Coach Brown Gives Pointers
First Coach Floyd Brown gave : the
ruggers a talk on the futilre practice
that leads up to the Big Game with
Santa Clara November 13, and ended
with a few pointers on formations.
Following this the one hundred "and
six treshmen present were divided
into two squads, Coach Brown taking
charge of the forwards and Captain
Danny Carroll the backs. Thfe" old
men of the backfield were put through
light practice under the direction of
Art Erb, while "Fat" Rehm drilled
the forty-one odd forwards.
Veteran's of last year's varsity pres
ent on the turf Saturday afternoon
were Captain Danny Carroll, Joe
Bxaden, Jim Wylie, Art Erb, Joe Ur
ban, F. E. Rehm and Henry S. Pet
tingill. Added to this string of vet
erans was a large number of second
team men who have played on the
Stanford turf and for the Cardinal
for two or three years.
One of the pleasantest discoveries
of the day was the strength and rugby
ability of the fireshman class. The
huskies of 'nineteen were entirely at
home on the field, and handled the
ball in passes with the familiarity of
players who had practised together
for some time. Captain Carroll was
enthusiastic over the showing made
by newcomers and prophesied a strong
freshman aggregation this year. "I
haven't had a chance to see who is
who in the freshman class, but taking
the new men at random, as I did in
our practice work-outs today, they
look exceptionally good. They are
fast players, and go through plays in
nippy style. They are heavier than
most freshmen squads have been in
the past, and are out in larger num
bers.
Several old-time,rs came back to see
the first practice of the season and
to note the effect of breaking off rela
tions with California, Prominent
among these was former Coach
George Presley, who watched the
freshmen closely from the side lines.
Asked what he thought of the showing
for the first day, Presley said: "The
season will be just as good as the men
make it. If they sit around and pine,
the season will not amount to much.
However, judging from the spirit
shown here today, there will be no
sitting around and no pining, and it
looks to me as though this will be a
banner season for Stanford. We have
plenty of men out, and will have
plenty of competition. It will be hard
competition, too. Judging from this
bunch of freshmen huskies we're get
ting more rugby material than ever
before. It shows that our break with
California will not bother us materi
ally, and that we can stand it better
than they. The situation looks mighty
good."
Several others, including "Doc"
Rurbank, '09, former Graduate Man
ager, Gene Kern, '13, and Peter Flana
gan, who played with the Australian
Wallabies when they invaded United
States in 1905, watched the initial
practice from the side lines, and ex
pressed themselves well pleased with
the aspect of rugby in general as ex
pressed by the men on the turf.
Practice will be held this afternoon
and every other afternoon this sea
son. At present the teams are lined
up according to classes, but it is likely
that many changes will be made in
squads when the men are better
known.
