# FIRST RUGBY PRACTICE PLEASES DEVOTEES OF THE GAME
## FRESHMEN ARE HUSKY SQUAD Old Veterans View Seasonal Outlook With Greatest Encouragement 
### 
Close to two hundred recruits and
veterans rushed onto the field for the
initial rugby practice of the season,
held Saturday afternoon. From this
squad and additional men who come
out to swell it will be picked in the

Art Erb, while "Fat" Rehm drilled
the forty-one odd forwards.
Veteran's of last year's varsity pres

were Captain Danny Carroll, Joe
Bxaden, Jim Wylie, Art Erb, Joe Ur
ban, F. E. Rehm and Henry S. Pet
tingill. Added to this string of vet
erans was a large number of second
team men who have played on the
Stanford turf and for the Cardinal
for two or three years.
One of the pleasantest discoveries
of the day was the strength and rugby
ability of the fireshman class. The
huskies of 'nineteen were entirely at
home on the field, and handled the
ball in passes with the familiarity of
