# New Gymnasium Proves To Be "Best Ever" As Dance Hall
## 
### 
An unusual financial success in the
dance of Saturday evening is .reported
by the Swimming Club. Over one
hundred couples enjoyed the first
campus dance of the season, which
was even more of a success socially
than financially. Although the at
tendance was large, there was plenty
of room for all not only on the floor,
which is the largest in the vicinity,
but also in the courts and aisles.
Those present attest a good smooth
floor and a room so well ventilated
as to be generally cool. The ceiling
is high and the powe.rful lights
showed it up to advantage.
