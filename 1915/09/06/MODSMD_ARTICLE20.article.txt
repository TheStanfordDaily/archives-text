# Ladies Unappreciative at Union
## 
### 
Rather doubtful appreciation was
accorded yesterday to the instigators
of "open house"day at the Union by
a handful of representatives of the
five hundred. A few ladies dropped
in by twos and threes, wandered about
indifferently, and quickly took their
departure. Ardor was conspicuous by
its absence.
I'ulrss more enthusiasm is evinced
by members of the fair sex, the day
will not be kept open during the .re
mainder of the semester.
