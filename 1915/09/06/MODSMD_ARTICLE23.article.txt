# A 						Sob Story

### 
Our undergraduate existence is
moth-eaten with provincial notions.
The average student is too well sat
isfied with life as he finds it inside
the campus gates. With the exception
of world's series returns and a few
other items of healthy progress, he
takes it for granted that the rest of
the universal scheme is working itself
out beautifully.
Of course the nation isn't going to
land on the rocks if the Stanford stu
dent body doesn't supply settlement
workers for San Francisco, or stump
the state for reform candidates at the
next election. As a matter of fact,
we couldn't handle either of those jobs
very well, and our offer of services
wouldn't be received with wild enthu
siasm. We are supposed to be learn
ing to live, and to venture too far into
real life would be putting the cart
before the horse.
But there as so many chances for
us to rub shoulders with real issues
of the world, and we don't even look
at them in a friendly way. Some of
the opjyortunities come right here to
Stanford. You know there have been
conventions and meetings without
number, which have had the Assembly
Hall, or some other room on the Quad
all to themselves.
Down at the bottom of all our in
difference to real life is a mixture of
provincial conceit and laziness.
Through the four years most of us
spend here, we do pick up a wonder
ful lot of information in the class
room. After all, much of that infor
mation is either disjointed, or com
pletely lost because we don't realize
that it was sifted out of real life be
fore it ever found its way into the text
book or syllabus.
There are some good opportunities
for us to do a little laboratory work
once in a while, to see just how the
people who are working outside, use
their knowledge. If we cared to talk
to them once in a while, or listen to
them talk, or read about them, we
could check up, and fit lots of loose
ends together. You know, it would
help to see the things we hear about
in class, on a working basis.
A few months after commencement
every year, there must be a great
many graduates who wish that they
had realized that the stuff they
learned was a means to an end, and
could really be applied. Most of us
dabble at our lessons from day to day,
and know something about the assign
ments, but we don't often call to
mind that we are going to use what
we learn. â€”that we are preparing a
foundation for business, and the pro
fessions.
There is a chance this week for us
to supplement some of the things we

have learned, by attending the dis
cussions of world peace which will be
held on the Quad afternoon and even
ing. Some of us have studied about
conciliation, and men who were striv
ing toward world peace. Here we
have a chance to see some of these
men in action.
The reference to the present series
of discussions suggests many other
side-lights on the world' work which
come to us every year.
It would be a wonderful thing if
we learned that we ought to be inter
ested in them. Then there wouldn't
lie so many rows of vacant seats, and
the professors and Palo Alto people
wouldn't be so lonely when they at
tended the gatherings.
