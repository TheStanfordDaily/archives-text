The Sleepers
The curtain rises, revealing a broad
bay beyond which, at the foot of roll
ing hills, lies a motley collection of
university buildings. Under a shaggy
oak three persons can be seen asleep.
Two more are standing, talking.
Graduate Manager—Any way you
look at it, it's a problem.
Rig Man—More than that, Johnny,
it's a danger.
G. M.—Almost half a hundred thou
sand debt yet to liquidate.
B. M. —Come to think of it, just what
did rugby lack?
G. M. (wiping his altitudinous
brow) —Rather warm today; or else
my collar's too small.
B. M.—Rugby was a game, after all.
G. M.—But the papers say a storm
is due.
B. M. —I fear th««y are right. A
storm with a heavy fall in the optimis
tic atmosphere.
G. M. —It may bring a precipitation.
B, M. —It may precipitate a catas
trophe.
G. M. —We'd better get under cover.
B. M.—What must we do about it?
G. M.—Preserve our honor at all
costs.
B. M. —Tf there is any to preserve.
G. M. (excitedly)—Sh! Not so loud!
I implore you! You'll arouse those
sleepers!
B. M. —Who are they?
G. M. —Don't you know? That fat
flimsy one is Newspaper Talk. He
has his arm about Public Opinion,
who lies on the arm o£ Indignation.
B. M. —Are they a danger?
G. M.—More than that; they're a
problem. I'm not sure of any oC
them for friends. I've duped them so
long. Look, they move! We must go.
(Newspaper Talk, as they exit,
raises his head, gazes after the dis
appearing pair, showing that he has
overheard. With a look of despair he
indicates that he cannot get up with
out arousing Public Opinion and
Indignation.)
