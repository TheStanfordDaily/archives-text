# FORD DODGES A DODGE
## Cars Collide at Junction of Row and County Road 
### 
Apparently undecided which way
he wanted to go, an unknown driver
of a Dodge suddenly turned from the
county road into the Row without giv
ing the customary signal Sunday
morning and thereby compelled a
Ford, which was coming up the Row,
to demonstrate its ability to out-dodge
even a Dodge. The much-abused, but
versatile, little Ford made a heroic
effort to dodge and almost succeeded.
That is, it succeeded up to the rear
hub where the Dodge landed solidly.
The Ford careened on two wheels and
threatened to leave the ground en
tirely, but it soon .regained its normal
position and, except for a bent rod and
the loss of a nut or two, was undam
aged. One woman occupant received
slight cuts on the fingers; the others
were unhurt.
