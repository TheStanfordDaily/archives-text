# FRITZ KREISLER WILL BE ARTIST AT FIRST CONCERT
## 
### 
Fritz Kreisler will be the first at
traction offered by the Peninsula Mu
sical association this season. The
master violinist's appearance assumes
a double interest through the fact that
he has but recently returned from the
war zone. He was an officer in the
Austrian reserves and at the opening
of the war was called to the front.
He spent several months in the
trenches and upon receiving a severe
wound was released f.rom further
service.
Since his dismissal he has been
making a concert tour of the United
States and has been drawing record
audiences in every city. His concert
here is scheduled for October 7 and
will take place in the Assembly Hall.
Holders of season tickets in the Mu
sical association will be able to hear
this concert without extra charge, but
to those buying individual tickets the
merits of the attraction have raised
the price to two dollars pe.r person.
