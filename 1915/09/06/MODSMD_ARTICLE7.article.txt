# Frank Mathieu Will Coach Sword and Sandals Comedy
## 
### 
Sword and Sandals has named
Frank L. Mathieu of San Francisco to
coach the cast of "Stop Thief" through
the vicissitudes of rehearsal. Mr.
Mathieu has long been connected with
dramatics at Stanford. His last work
in the field of farce will be fresh in
the minds of the college public be
cause of the undeniable success of
"Seven Days", which was under the
direction of Mr. Mathieu.
"Stop Thief" will prove a worthy
successor to the senior farce of last
May. The complications of the Sword
and Sandals comedy should give the
audience all the mental gymnastics
they could wish. There is not a dull
moment from the first curtain to the
last.
The cast, which promises to be of
satellite quality throughout, will be
announced late this week. The play
gives an especially good opportunity
for the men in the cast, of whom
there will be twelve. Only four
women will take part. Rehearsals
will be started immediately after the
announcement of the cast and a pro
duction of professional calibre will
be possible by October 8, which is
the date set for the performance.
