# INTERCLASS GAMES FOR RUGBY SQUAD ARE ANNOUNCED
## CUT MADE THIS AFTERNOON New System Adopted Enables Closer Watching of New Men Out 
### 
A definite schedule for interclass
competition was decided upon today
by Coach Brown fo,r the rugby toilers
who weather the first week of initial
practice and make class squads.
Monday afternoon the freshmen and
sophomores will open hostilities with
a set-to on the turf. Tuesday the
juniors will meet the seniors.
Wednesday the freshmen entertain
Palo Alto high school ruggers, and
Thursday the finals of the interclass
contests will be played off. Friday
the first game between the first and
second varsity squads will be played.
Coach Brown made certain changes
in the squads tonight, reducing the
players inside the bleachers to a num
ber that could be more easily handled.
The remainder of the recruits were
sent to the oute.r field where they
were placed in charge of W. D.
Fletcher, '11.
According to Coach Brown this
change will enable the men in charge
of practice to give individuals more
attention. "Just because a man is
sent outside doesn't mean that he is
dropped from the squad," he said to
day. "Men both inside and outside
will be watched, and the men who
make good outside will be sent in on
the field with the main squad. Like
wise, the fellows inside who are in
different to advice and instructions,
or whoever does not show up regu
la,rly will be removed to the outer
squad. We will have games between
the best men from Fletcher's outer
squad and the fellows inside every
day or two.
"This system gives every man a
chance to play regularly and doesn't
force half of the players to stand
around and get cool while the others
are playing. We've found that this
new system is almost necessary be
cause practically one-half of the new
men haven't played rugby befo.re.
Captain Carroll, Bill Fletcher, the old
men, and I will now watch the new
men, and will be ready to answer
any questions they may have to ask.
We expect regular attendance by
every man who is out."
Several new recruits were added to
the strength of the freshman rugby
squad yesterday afternoon. The 'nine
teen class has now furnished mere
than half of the men who work out
daily on the turf under directions of
the veterans from last year's filteen.
It is estimated that the number of new
comers out for football will reach one
hundred and fifty by the end of the
week, if indications are correct.
A number of former ruggers ap
peared yesterday to join in the prac
tice with Joe Rraden's backfield. All
of the old men were put to snapny
practice on the outside turf while
Coach Brown and Captain Carroll put
the freshmen through stunts in for
mation and passes on the official field.
The Palo Alto Athletic Club aggre
gation visited the field yesterday af
ternoon looking for competition from
some one of the Cardinal squads. The
Paly boys were disappointed, how
ever, because Coach Brown did not
have his men ready for a real tussle,
as the teams have not yet been well
lined up.

cause practically one-half of the new
men haven't played rugby befo.re.
Captain Carroll, Bill Fletcher, the old
men, and I will now watch the new
men, and will be ready to answer
any questions they may have to ask.
We expect regular attendance by
every man who is out."
Several new recruits were added to
the strength of the freshman rugby
squad yesterday afternoon. The 'nine
teen class has now furnished mere
than half of the men who work out
daily on the turf under directions of
the veterans from last year's filteen.
It is estimated that the number of new
comers out for football will reach one
hundred and fifty by the end of the
week, if indications are correct.
A number of former ruggers ap
peared yesterday to join in the prac
tice with Joe Rraden's backfield. All
of the old men were put to snapny
practice on the outside turf while
Coach Brown and Captain Carroll put
the freshmen through stunts in for
mation and passes on the official field.
The Palo Alto Athletic Club aggre
gation visited the field yesterday af
ternoon looking for competition from
some one of the Cardinal squads. The
Paly boys were disappointed, how
ever, because Coach Brown did not
have his men ready for a real tussle,
as the teams have not yet been well
lined up.
A definite schedule for interclass
competition was decided upon today
by Coach Brown fo,r the rugby toilers
who weather the first week of initial
practice and make class squads.
Monday afternoon the freshmen and
sophomores will open hostilities with
a set-to on the turf. Tuesday the
juniors will meet the seniors.
Wednesday the freshmen entertain
Palo Alto high school ruggers, and
Thursday the finals of the interclass
contests will be played off. Friday
the first game between the first and
second varsity squads will be played.
Coach Brown made certain changes
in the squads tonight, reducing the
players inside the bleachers to a num
ber that could be more easily handled.
The remainder of the recruits were
sent to the oute.r field where they
were placed in charge of W. D.
Fletcher, '11.
According to Coach Brown this
change will enable the men in charge
of practice to give individuals more
attention. "Just because a man is
sent outside doesn't mean that he is
dropped from the squad," he said to
day. "Men both inside and outside
will be watched, and the men who
make good outside will be sent in on
the field with the main squad. Like
wise, the fellows inside who are in
different to advice and instructions,
or whoever does not show up regu
la,rly will be removed to the outer
squad. We will have games between
the best men from Fletcher's outer
squad and the fellows inside every
day or two.
"This system gives every man a
chance to play regularly and doesn't
force half of the players to stand
around and get cool while the others
are playing. We've found that this
new system is almost necessary be
cause practically one-half of the new
men haven't played rugby befo.re.
