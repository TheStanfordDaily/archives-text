# DOCTOR EDWARD CAPPS OF PRINCETON SPEAKS ON "RELUCTANT STUDENT"
## "Acceptance of Responsibility Is Keynote of Education," Says Visitor 
### 
Anyone who was not among those
who filled the Assembly Hall at the
first university gathering of the
semester at 11:15 today, is to be
pitied. For things were said at that
assembly, and big things.
President Branner accorded a
hearty greeting to the newcomers
and to the comebacks. Never was a
more hearty and a more generous
welcome accorded. And never did
the speaker so skilfully blend into
his words the bright witticisms that
are characteristic of only Dr. Branner.
President Branner welcomed the
new faculty members, mentioning
Professors Hotchkiss of Minnesota,
Tatlock of Michigan, Willis of geology
fame, and Clark B. Whittier, '97, who
have been added to the departments
of Economics, Philology, Geology, and
Law, respectively. He welcomed the
entering men and women, and told
them of cherished traditions, of mush
room traditions that are already tram
pled under foot as undesirable, and of
a tradition much neglected,â€”that of
a campus beautiful. And today, too,
was the final word said in regard to
unsanctioned underclass old clothes
raids.
Dr. B.ranner's words in regard to
the former intercollegiate situation
brought forth great applause.
"There is no peace party on this
campus and there is not going to be
one until the war is over, David Starr
Jordan to the contrary notwith
standing," he said.

D.r. Edward Capps, of Princeton,
who has won a place for himself in
the world of classical languages, an
nounced that his subject, "The Reluc
tant Student," must by all means be
surrounded by quotation marks, and
not interpreted as a direct reference
or an insinuation regarding any but
his own college. The reluctant stu
dent, as defined by Dr. Capps, is he
who as time goes on limits his oppor
tunities, the .responsibilities he will
accept, and who takes grudgingly the
opportunities the university offers.
"One type of student just drifts
along, gets out of all unpleasant tasks,
side-steps; he looks away from oppor
tunity instead of seizing it", he said.
"The acceptance of responsibilities
is the keynote of education. In an
institution whose traditions and his
tory so vividly recall wisdom in plan
ning and generosity in giving it is
only fair that the faculty ask students
to plan their work with a wisdom and
a generosity that will match that of
their college."
Dr. Capps advised the student to
regulate his distractions as carefully
as his expenditures, inasmuch as the
student is the one affectrd; and not
to ovelook the simple fact that
instructors are masters of their
subjects.
