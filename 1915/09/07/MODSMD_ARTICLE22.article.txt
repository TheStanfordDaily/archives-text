# Dark Brown Taste

It's pretty early in the year, and all
that, but suppose we begin to kid
Student Control along a bit, for fear it
might grow despondent some dark
night, and wonder what's the use, and
then start out on a regular old bender.
These legends they string around on
the rathskeller walls about wine, and
song, and the third ingredient are in
spired, and the orchestra is playing,
and it's fine. But if the students'
affairs committee ever has to open
that other eye, and decides to write
some minutes, there won't be any
poetry about it at all, and there won't
be any music for us except a swan
song.
We can talk about our self-govern
ment game now, all we want to, be
cause the way to Redwood isn't very
well lighted yet, and there haven't
been any ex's to fudge in, or anything
of that sort. So none of the outsiders
who are eavesdropping can get any
thing on us at all. There isn't a scrap
of scandal in the air except the war
clouds from the Berkeley hills, and
the city papers already know about
that.
Talk this student government idea
over among yourselves before the as
sembly comes next Friday. If you
old-timers on the campus will tell the
freshmen what we expect of them,
you will do the whole community a
good turn. Of course, you will have
to read that little red book of rules
to get posted. Honest, it reads like
a romance. Why, histories, and nov
els, and reams of poetry have been
written about the fight the rest of the
world had before it got democratic
government. It has been handed to
us on a silver plate and a lot of us
don't knew what it is all about.
Right now Stanford is beginning
the fourth year of its attempt at stu
dent government. So far we have
done pretty well. The student council,
and the student conference have
worked hard. But the whole campus
hasn't worked hard enough with them.
Pretty soon we have got to get past
the experimental stage. Henry Ford
probably had a machine that would
run four years after he got the hunch.
Fortunately, no one else wants the
job of running this Farm as a model
institution. So if we get the indi
vidual and mutual responsibility idea
working hard enough, there isn't any
real reason why a system of govern
ment "by the people and for the peo
ple", shouldnt go as well at Stanford
as it did in the Gettysburg address.

world had before it got democratic
government. It has been handed to
us on a silver plate and a lot of us
don't knew what it is all about.
Right now Stanford is beginning
the fourth year of its attempt at stu
dent government. So far we have
done pretty well. The student council,
and the student conference have
worked hard. But the whole campus
hasn't worked hard enough with them.
Pretty soon we have got to get past
the experimental stage. Henry Ford
probably had a machine that would
run four years after he got the hunch.
Fortunately, no one else wants the
job of running this Farm as a model
institution. So if we get the indi
vidual and mutual responsibility idea
working hard enough, there isn't any
real reason why a system of govern
ment "by the people and for the peo
ple", shouldnt go as well at Stanford
as it did in the Gettysburg address.
