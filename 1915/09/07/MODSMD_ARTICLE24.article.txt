# DAVEY PHOTOS FOR QUAD
## Pictures Taken Early This Semester Will Be Obtainable at Special Rates. 
### 
Organization pictures for the 1917
Quad may be taken now at Devey's.
It is imperative that all pictures
come in as soon as is possible. In
order to have all organization pictures
taken early, Mr. Davey has offered to
make a special rate of $3.00 per group
for all pictures taken before Novem
ber 15. After that date, on account
of the great amount of work to be
covered, the regular rates for groups
will be charged.
The earlier all pictures are taken,
the more attention can be given to
the individual groups. The three dol
lar rate will hold good only until the
15th of November.
Davey will also take all the Junior
individual pictures. The third year
students will be able to make appoint
ments for their pictures -as soon as
they have paid their Quad dues to
H. L. Hews, who is manager of the
annual. Dues are five dollars. The
receipt will give the holder the priv
ilege of having his class picture taken
at Davey's and will entitle him to a
copy of the Quad without paying the
usual price of $2.50.
