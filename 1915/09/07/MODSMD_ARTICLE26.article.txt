# Law School Is Largest In History of Stanford
## Department Meets With Decided Success in Summer Session Experiment. 
### 
With a total registration to date
of 369 students, the Stanford Law
department is beginning the school
year with the largest enrollment in
history. Last year at the same time
there were but 341 students regis
tered, the gain being 28. Out of the
total number in the department there
are 161 students of the law proper,
and 208 prelegal students, while last
year there were 156 law and 185 pre
legal students signed up at this time.
There will probably be at least thirty
more law students enrolled before the
close of registration, due to the fact
that graduates are not compelled to
Hie their study cards immediately.
As it is, the advance classes are so
large that the class rooms are inad
equate to hold them.
Both the students and faculty of the
summer school held for six weeks by
the Law department, pronounce the
experiment a decided success. There
was an attendance of 35 men, taking
work from Professor A. M. Cathcart,
Professor C. A. Houston, and Assist
ant Professor M. R. Kirkwood. It
is the hope of the faculty to make
this summer session permanent if
the support of the trustees can be
secured.
A glance at the personnel of the
law faculty reveals the addition of
two men to the force. Instructor W.
P. Owens hag been appointed to take
the place of Assistant Professo.r H. G.
Spaulding, and will teach the law of
crimes and moot court this semester.
Owens took his A. P. degree from
Stanford in 1914, and secured the de
gree of L. L. P. here last May. He
was prominent in dramatics and de
bating, and was honored by election
to the Order of the Coif last semester.
Professor C. P. Whittle,r, formerly
of the University of Chicago, has
been appointed to fill the chair va
cated by Professor Hoefeld, who has
gone to Yale. Professo.r Hoefeld's
place was filled by Professor Cheadle
last year.
