Maurice Costello
Famous Moving Picture Actor,
says:
"The great thing about Tuxedo is
the fact that it gives full fragrance
and flavor together with extreme
mildness. I find Tuxedo not only
the height of pipe enjoyment but
a distinct benefit because it gives
just the proper degree of relaxa
tion. Tuxedo is undoubtedly an
exceptional tobacco."

"As Popular As The
Movies"—TUXEDO
Tuxedo answers every smoke desire—every little
palate craving, every longing for the one Perfect Pipe
and Cigarette tobacco. No matter when or how you
smoke Tuxedo it sends right into your heart a glim
mer of Gladsome Sunshine. And you can just about
hear the honeybees buzz in the far-off gardens.
cjuxedo
The Pcrfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
Sings into your system a song of keen delight.
It spreads real happiness and cheer because it's smok
able, lovable, all day, all night—no matter how the
weather fits. Tuxedo s flavor is so enticingly mild
and delicately fragrant it will not irritate the most
sensitive throat.
Simply the choicest mild leaves of grand old
Kentucky Burley—ripe, rich, fragrant and mellow —
made into delicious tobacco that smokes as smooth
as cream. That's Tuxedo.
