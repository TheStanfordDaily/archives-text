### 
The Stanford Swimming Club
elected officers at its meeting in the
Stanford Union last evening. A. A.
Goldsmith was chosen manager for
the coming season, and W. R. Wheat
ley, '17, was selected as captain.
Plans for the following year were
discussed by the various members. It
was decided that no high diving ap
paratus is to be installed but that
a springing board would be installed
immediately. It was further decided
that no sliding board is to be used,
also that the new pool will not be
finished until it has been thoroughly
tried. A series of tryouts are to be
held immediately under the direction
of Instructor Brandsten who will
pick the team. The interclass meets
will also be started immediately. It
is very probable that meets will be
held with the Los Angeles Athletic
Club and the San Diego Rowing Club.
