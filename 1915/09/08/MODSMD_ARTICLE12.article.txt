# Santa Clara Rugby Outlook Bright
## 
### 
With a coterie of eight veterans, I
over a dozen second team men, and
it number of star newcomers on the
firing line, Coach Ybarrando of Santa
Clara is entertaining bright prospects
\ fo,r a powerful rugby machine to
launch against Stanford on Novem
ber 13.
Big (inme for San Francisco.
As yet no arrangements have been
j made by the graduate managers of
either university as to the field upon
which the Big Game will be staged,
other than to mutually agree that the
contest will he played somewhere in
San Francisco. The Exposition au
thorities are anxious to have the
teams meet on the Marina, where Art
Smith, the noted aviator, commenced
all his flights. At present, however,
indications point to Recreation Park
of the Pacific Coast baseball league,
with Ewing field as a possibility.

The Santa Clara football schedule,
which calls for a game every week
end until the final match in November,
begins next Sunday. Up to the pres
ent time close to seventy-five ruggers
have been turning out daily fo,r prac
tice on the new turf under the direc
tion of Ybarrando, whom it will he
remembered has played on the Ail-
American team during past seasons.
Five veterans of the required eight
needed in the pack have returned to

I college. Bates is being t.ried out in
the front rank. Hickey at lock, Ar
marel at left-middle rank, while Mul
doon and Cochinas are being used as
breakaways. Only three backfield
players remain in the fold. Schulz,
the clever, fighting half-ba/ck, who
will lead the fifteen this fall, should
lie a world of strength in initiating
passing rushes. Mulholland is booked
as first-five eights, while Curtain is
being switched between the two posi
tions of center-three-quarters and
wing.
Excellent. New Timber.
Santa Clara football enthusiasts
find themselves especially fortunate in
the splendid new material that has
entered this year. Five of these are
at present holding down regular
places on the varsity: Pie, Masters.
Benzburg, Brown, and Dodge. In ad
dition the second team boasts of a
number of strong ruggers, Donahue
appearing as the most likely candi
date for first team honors.
A new feature in Santa Clara un
dergraduate life has been established
during the past few days, in the char
acter of student self government. A
commission of three, composed of stu
dent body President Boone, Trainer
Brown, and Coach Ybarrando is to re
lieve the faculty of the reins of gov
ernment during the day time. In the
evening, however, the forme.r rules
will remain in effect.
