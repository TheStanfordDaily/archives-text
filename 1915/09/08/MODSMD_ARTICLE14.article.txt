You're here, and I'm here, in the
words of the underclass bard, but
Santa Clara is only a few miles up the
valley, so we had better care a good
deal. Apparently the mission school
plans joyously to annex the coast rug
by title from Stanford this fall, and tie
it up in red and white baby ribbon,
and mail it to Mr. Spalding for publi
cation in the 1916 football guide.
There is so much infernally clever
rugby talent on the Santa Clara cam
pus this year that we may wish Berke
ley was back on the job before
November 13 is over. Besides that,
student control has recently been in
stalled by the fathers in some form
or other, and our neighbors are apt
to feel cocky enough to get by with
almost anything.
But this column is to deal with
choi,r practice, and lyrical composi
tion, and cheers, so we'll leave Santa
Clara alone until the time comes for
us to file into one side of the Valencia
street grounds with the band playing,
and boost the contest for the cham
pionship match. For more than two
hours, then, we'll back the varsity to
the limit, and not leave anything un
done that ought to be done in the way
of playing the game from the
bleachers.
The natural question to dispose of
is, what will the band be playing and
what are we going to come back with
when the Santa Clara crowd unmuz
zles its songbirds, and all that sort
of thing? As sure as you live, there
will be a real husky crowd of Santa
Clara enthusiasts in the stands.
Naturally we don't like to throw off
on California, after all the fun we
have had in the last twenty odd years,
at the Big Games, it seems to be a
case of have to, though. We can't
yell "to hell with the Gold and Blue"
more than a few times on November
13 with any degree of satisfaction.
What it all amounts to is this, —
the Stanford varsity is going to play
rugby against Santa Clara, and there
will be a referee, and touch judges,
and water boys, and a first aid corps,
and telegraph instruments, and a rival
rooting section, and great big crowds
of alumni and pick-up spectators. In
all respects but the one item of a
Stanford rooting section, it has al
ready assumed the proportions of a
.regular game. If we lose, or win,
the headlines will be as big as they
ever were. There's no getting around
it, we need some new songs and yells.
There will be a yell leaders' tryout
this evening. In a day or two there
will be the announcement of a song
and yell contest. Figure out whether
we can afford to sit like a lot of
statues and enjoy the game.

hours, then, we'll back the varsity to
the limit, and not leave anything un
done that ought to be done in the way
of playing the game from the
bleachers.
The natural question to dispose of
is, what will the band be playing and
what are we going to come back with
when the Santa Clara crowd unmuz
zles its songbirds, and all that sort
of thing? As sure as you live, there
will be a real husky crowd of Santa
Clara enthusiasts in the stands.
Naturally we don't like to throw off
on California, after all the fun we
have had in the last twenty odd years,
at the Big Games, it seems to be a
case of have to, though. We can't
yell "to hell with the Gold and Blue"
more than a few times on November
13 with any degree of satisfaction.
What it all amounts to is this, —
the Stanford varsity is going to play
rugby against Santa Clara, and there
will be a referee, and touch judges,
and water boys, and a first aid corps,
and telegraph instruments, and a rival
rooting section, and great big crowds
of alumni and pick-up spectators. In
all respects but the one item of a
Stanford rooting section, it has al
ready assumed the proportions of a
.regular game. If we lose, or win,
the headlines will be as big as they
ever were. There's no getting around
it, we need some new songs and yells.
There will be a yell leaders' tryout
this evening. In a day or two there
will be the announcement of a song
and yell contest. Figure out whether
we can afford to sit like a lot of
statues and enjoy the game.
You're here, and I'm here, in the
words of the underclass bard, but
Santa Clara is only a few miles up the
valley, so we had better care a good
deal. Apparently the mission school
plans joyously to annex the coast rug
by title from Stanford this fall, and tie
it up in red and white baby ribbon,
and mail it to Mr. Spalding for publi
cation in the 1916 football guide.
There is so much infernally clever
rugby talent on the Santa Clara cam
pus this year that we may wish Berke
ley was back on the job before
November 13 is over. Besides that,
student control has recently been in
stalled by the fathers in some form
or other, and our neighbors are apt
to feel cocky enough to get by with
almost anything.
But this column is to deal with
choi,r practice, and lyrical composi
tion, and cheers, so we'll leave Santa
Clara alone until the time comes for
us to file into one side of the Valencia
street grounds with the band playing,
and boost the contest for the cham
pionship match. For more than two
hours, then, we'll back the varsity to
the limit, and not leave anything un
done that ought to be done in the way
of playing the game from the
bleachers.
