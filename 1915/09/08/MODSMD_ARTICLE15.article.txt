That athletic sports are made valu
able to a nation as a preparation
for war is a time worn and discredited
theory. Such is the statement made
in an article in a recent number of
the "American Physical Education
Ileview". "The pages of history",
says the writer, "prove beyond doubt
that in the wars of the olden times
when personal encounter predomi
nated and in modern warfare with
seige guns, aeroplanes and subma
rines, training in athletic sports may
be of great value.
"Athletics train not only the man
behind the gun, but the admiral and
the general. That, however, the very
general practice of athletic sports
does not of necessity make a nation
combative is well illustrated by Great
Britain and America. Here are pos
sibly the most sport loving of civil
ized nations. They are from a mili
tary standpoint strong and could be
stronger if they desired. Yet his
torically they have been for many
years desirous of peace.
"There are those who believe that
the hygienic effect of proper athletic
sports favors in the individual a
peaceful rather than a combative out
look on life. Sports between nations
lead to a greater understanding of
national sentiments and aspirations.
We may well claim for these sports
an agency in the preservation of
peace.
"Philosophers have told us that by
play, not by study, the character of
boys and men and of girls also, was
most largely formed, that athletic
sports were the best means for the
training and development of the will.
"Of one thing we may be sure. It
is. that each n ill be settling
its own problei i ..thletics in its
attempts to sol the larger one of
