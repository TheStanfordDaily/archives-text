# Professor Snyder Returns From Zoological Expedition
## Spends Slimmer Investigating Fishes to be Found in Rocky Mountain Streams 
### 
Associate Professor J. O. Snyder of
the Zoology department has returned
to the campus after spending the
greater part of the summer in a de
tailed investigation of the fishes to be
found in the streams of the Rocky
Mountains. The excursion was made
in an automobile and throughout the
trip, the pa.rty camped out and
"roughed it"in the most primitive
manner.
The expedition was conducted as a
continuation of a minute survey of
this part of the country which has
occupied the attention of Professor
Snyder for a period of over three
years. This summer ove.r thirty-five
hundred miles of territory were cov
ered. In this research work, the in
vestigator was accompanied by C. L.
Hubbs, 'in, of the Zoology department.
A complete survey of the La Hontan
basin of Nevada was finished in the
first few weeks of the trip. F.rom
there the party journeyed east to thÂ£
Honneville basin. Some time was
spent in collecting specimens of the
fishes of this region.
The Great Salt Lake country was
next subjected to this combing out
process. This region embraces num
bers of small disconnected basins
which lie at the base of the Wasatch
mountains. The greater part of the
summer was devoted to the survey of
this section.
The entire trip was pursued under
the direction of the United States Bu
reau of Fisheries. Thousands of de
sirable species were collected and
sent to the Zoology department at
Stanford where they will be studied
and classified under the supervision
of Professo,r Snyder. He estimates
that there are one or more new spe
cies in the collection.
