### 
To Townsend belongs the honor of
making the first touch-down of the
season on the Stanford turf. Town
send was first man among the seniors
to carry the ball over the line.
Freshmen versus seniors furnished
good competition for both sides yes
terday afternoon. Lack of confidence
on the part of the freshmen was the
principal drawback to a score by the
newscomers ove.r the four-year men.
The new Palo Alto Athletic rugby
team will meet the Olympic Club
fifteen at the Exposition on September
9. Captain Si Davidson has not given
out the personnel of the line-up for
the local players.
The number of ruggers out this
season continues to excel that of last
year. Several other men will join the
ranks in a few days, but as yet have
been unable to do so because of per
sonal disabilities.
Attendance at practice regularly is
what enables the coach to pick out
real rugby players, according to Coach
Floyd Brown. Consequently, regular
attendance is one of the strongest re
quirements the coach will lay down
this year.
