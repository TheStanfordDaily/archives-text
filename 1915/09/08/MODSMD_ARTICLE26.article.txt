# BASKETBALL PLAYERS TO BEGIN PRACTICE TONIGHT
## Many Candidates Expected to Report â€”Eastern Rules Will Make Faster Game 
### 
Basketball on the Pacific Coast this
season will be a far different and a
far faster game than the brand played
during the past few years. The inter
collegiate rules of the eastern states
have been adopted and it is expected
that the speed of the game will be
very much increased.
Fall practice begins tonight at the
Gymnasium, and from the number
signed up, the prospects for a winning
season appear bright. Captain W. B.
Blodget, '15, states that the prospects
of playing on one of the only two
teams to meet California this year
seems to appeal to the students, and
so he expects an extra large turn-out
when actual practice begins. Blodget,
Button, Worthy, and Dolan are back
and with Austin and Caughey, who
have had considerable experience
should form the nucleus of a winning
team.
The "Big Six League" is composed
of Stanford, California, St. Mary's, Col
lege of Pacific, St. Ignatius and Ne
vada. The big game will be with
Santa Clara, the date being set at a
little later time.
