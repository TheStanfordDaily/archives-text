# Peanut League Holds Tryouts
## 
### 
The peanut league again held base
ball tryouts on the varsity and auxil
iary fields yesterday afternoon. The
Whites defeated the Blacks on the var
sity field by a score of eight to two,
while the Blue and Reds tied by a
five to five score on the auxiliary dia
mond. Only five innings were played
by both sections, owing to a late
start. These games are not to be
counted in the series, as the competi
tion was in the nature of a tryout.
Regular scoring of the peanut league
will begin during the latter part of
the week.
