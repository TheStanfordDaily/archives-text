Glee Club men held an enthusiastic
meeting last night in which it was de
cried that the present excellent condi

extraordinary effort to work up three
trips this year. In addition to this
the members expressed themselves as
heartily in favor of appearing as often
as possible before the university

Santa Fe trip to Chicago next sum

Lake this Christmas, and a tour of
the high schools of the southern part
of the state in the spring.

composed of accordeon, banjo, piano
and drum. Sixteen dances and two
extras are on the program, the inter
