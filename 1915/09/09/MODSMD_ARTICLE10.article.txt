# Stanford's Champion Crew Will Remain Almost Intact
## W.H. Bloeser, '14, Only Man Sure to Drop Off 
### 
The same Stanford crew that so
astounded the athletic world last year
will, with but two exceptions, report
for practice when Captain "Chick"
Orme, '16, gives the word. Orme, Ja
comini, Goodman, McEuen, Marer,
Green and Hulsman are the men who
will be eligible, Bloeser leaving the
vacancy. It is possible that Jacomini
and Hulsman will not take their po
sitions.
Nothing has been heard from the
shell left in the East, but Captain Orme
expects to get in communication with
those who are caring for it within
a few days. There will be no fall
practice for crew unless it be some
cross-country running immediately
after the football season.
The number of large men in the 'l!t
class should make the freshman boat
a winner. When Captain Orme issues
the first practice call it is expected
that many new men will answer.
