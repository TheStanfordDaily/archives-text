# Square Yourself
## 
### 
If you are under obligation to some
fellow on the campus, for the love of
decency, square yourself. Pay his
carfare the next time you go to town
together. O.r if he gave you a real
smoke instead of just the makings,
take him to the movies. Almost any
thing under the sun to keep him in
a good humor, so that he will be sure
to come through again.
But don't try to elect him to the
Conference tomorrow afternoon.
The particular thing we have to do
this year is to spill some oil in our
student government machinery. Fill
those twenty-five vacancies in the
Conference with men who will have
something to brag about at the end
of the year besides their pictures in
the Quad.
Twenty new members of the Confer
ence will be chosen tomorrow from
thirteen departments, by the students
in those departments who have fifty
hours or more of university credit.
Next Thursday, five members-at-large
will be selected at a general election
of qualified voters.
You know it already, but do you ac
knowledge frankly that you must cast
your vote, and use it honestly, to se
cure your membership in the commu
nity? All our hope of keeping self
government, now that we have it,
depends on the kind of work done by
the Conference, our lower house, and
the Student Council, which is assigned
by the Conference to handle the execu
tive jobs that are necessary from time
to time. According to the rule book
of the Associated Students, the Con
ference and Student Council are the
representative governing bodies of
the Stanford men. They aren't really
that unless you register a vote.
Keep the judges busy at the polls
tomorrow. Elect competent men. You
aren't adding a new honor to theii
list, but putting them to work. We
want them to peg away so busily and
wisely that the ghost of faculty con
trol will get real sick and die.
