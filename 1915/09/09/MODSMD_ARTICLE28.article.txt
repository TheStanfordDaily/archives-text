general picture of Japan's part in in
ternational affairs since the time of itb

hashi, dealt with the arguments
brought forward in California against
the Japanese. He ridiculed the prin
cipal arguments advanced by C'ali
fornians, and stated that they were
not consistent.
"Some Americans give as their .rea
son for excluding the Japanese that
they are too quick in taking up Amer
ican customs, while others state that
the .laps do not assimilate with Amer
icans," he stated in attempting to dis
prove legislative arguments.
Doctor Mez spoke briefly 011 the
question of whether or not the Jap
anese should be granted citizenship.
"The Japanese are not inferior to
Americans, and consequently there is
no reason why they should not be
granted full citizenship," he said.
Doctor Jordan closed the discussion
with a short review of "Japanese-
American Diplomatic Relations."
This evening's topic will be "Pan-
American Relations and the Monroe
Doctrine." The conference sessions
will close tomorrow evening with a
discussion on "The Conditions of a
