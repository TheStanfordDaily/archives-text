### 
Stanford's rugby peanut league now
has about fifty new men learning the
game unde.r direction of "Bill" Fletch
er and "Stubby" Stolz. From time to
time the recruits of this league will
be sent into the inner field to join the
regular squads.
Ability to pass was the principal
feature of the freshman first-f.reshman
second team tussle yesterday. The
new men displayed a rather meagre
knowledge of the game in general,
but were well able to take care of the
ball once it passed into the backfield.
Charlie Austin has been engaged
by the student body management to
assist head rubber, L. R. Reynolds.
Saturday will give local rugby fans
ample opportunity to size up the re
spective teams now working out on
the turf. Coach Brown expects to line
u1Â» three different games, thus giving
every group of players a chance to
show what they can do.
"Jumbo" Blase, '14, lock on last
year's varsity, came back yesterday
sporting a misplaced eye-brow where
his upper lip used to be. Blase is now
engaged in road work.
