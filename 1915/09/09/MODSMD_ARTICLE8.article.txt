# Doeblers' Clothes Disappear
## Hist to Tills Tale of Woe! 
### 
J. H. Doebler left Los Angeles Sun
day, August 29, with the following
complete wardrobe in his possession:
Three suits of clothes, six pairs of
hole-proof, four B. V. D.'s, three
pairs of shoes, one pair of garters,
two semester shirts, tour other ditto,
two caps, one belt, a number of ties,
an overcoat, and an allotment of school
supplies.
Today, September 9, Doebler is at
large on the campus with only the
following wardrobe: One suit of
clothes, one pair of hole-proof, one B.
V. D., one pair of shoes, one pair of
garters, one shirt (not even a semes
ter one), one cap, one belt, one tie
and very few school supplies.
No, the sophomores didn't catch him
as he is a junior, a transfer from Los
Angeles Junior College. Burglars
didn't steal his outfit. His lay-out
was not burned up, at least he doesn't
think that it was. What happened to
his wardrobe? Merely this. He lost
his trunk. Now, isn't he out of luck?
By the way, any information about
said stray trunk will be appreciated.
