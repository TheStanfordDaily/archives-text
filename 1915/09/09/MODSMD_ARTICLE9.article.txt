# Professor Gilbert Is Engaged In Research Work During Vacation
## 
### 
Professor C. H. Gilbert of the Zool
ogy department spent the summer in
British Columbia, where he has been
intermittently engaged in research
work for the past five years. He fol
lowed the shore line from Victoria to
Prince Rupert, stopping at all of the
salmon canneries, which were in his
path.
He has devised a way of classifying
the salmon runs, which are at their
height in summer, by an examination
of the scales taken from the salmon in
the time of the run. He collected a
valuable amount of information and
he will work up a classification during
the winter, making a report of his
results to the British Columbia
Journal.
