Football will be dished up to Car
dinal rugby fans tomorrow from sun
.rise to sunset on the local turf. A
combination of four fast games has
been arranged by Graduate Manager
Behrens to afford the 1913 season a
whirlwind start. Coach Brown an
nounces bis intention of using every
man at some stage of the game, so all
candidates will be given an oppor

The afternoon's athletic activittcs
will commence at 2:30, when the
freshmen are booked to line up against
the San Francisco High School fifteen.
One hour later the main attraction is
to hold the boards. At this time a
much renovated varsity will trot out

Fisher as partner. Coleman is relief
player. Halsted is slated to lock the
pack together, with Scott as substi

The backfield is also the subject of

opposite wings. Fullback is to be en
