# FOUR GAMES ARE SLATED IN FIRST RUGBY PROGRAM
## Varsity Will Face Winged O Tomorrow In Initial Contest of Season FRESHMEN VS. POLYTECHNICS 
### 
Football will be dished up to Car
dinal rugby fans tomorrow from sun
.rise to sunset on the local turf. A
combination of four fast games has
been arranged by Graduate Manager
Behrens to afford the 1913 season a
whirlwind start. Coach Brown an
nounces bis intention of using every
man at some stage of the game, so all
candidates will be given an oppor
tunity to follow the ball into action.
The afternoon's athletic activittcs
will commence at 2:30, when the
freshmen are booked to line up against
the San Francisco High School fifteen.
One hour later the main attraction is
to hold the boards. At this time a
much renovated varsity will trot out
onto the field to lock horns with the
Olympic Clu') ruggers. Following
this contest, the All-Blacks are to
meet the newly formed Palo Alto Ath
letic Club team. In the morning at
10:30 two picked aggregations, the
Greys and the Blacks, will afford
amusement to the bleachers.
Varsity Changed.
When last year's sport followers
gaze over the line-up announced by
Coach Brown as the varsity, they will
find many strange faces and changed
positions, as only seven veterans are
included. The front rank is an en
tirely new combination, with Bihlman,
Knight, and Rehm as hookers. Single
substituting. Middle-rank shows Pet
tingill back at his old position, with
Fisher as partner. Coleman is relief
player. Halsted is slated to lock the
pack together, with Scott as substi
tute. Two veterans. Wylie and Bra
den. will act as breakaways.
The backfield is also the subject of
numerous changes. Walker, utility
man last year, will have the respon
sibility of initiating scoring rushes at
half. First and second five-eighths
have been assigned to Erb and Swi
gart, respectively. Skipper Carroll as
usual will be a tower of strength at
center-three-quarters, while Urban
and Dievendo.rf will be seen at the
opposite wings. Fullback is to be en
trusted to West, with Erb relieving
later on in the game.
The game between the Olympics
and the varsity should provide no end
of thrills and hard fighting. As the
varsity stands at present, it is bound
to lack the team work and precision
that will be evident in the club play.
Yesterday the Palo Alto Athletic Club
went down to defeat before the
Winged "O" aggregation by an over
whelming score, so the gods of vic
tory may find it difficult to award the
laurels to Stanford.
To pass, upon the merits of the
freshman-Polytechnic high school
contest would be difficult, as both are
as yet an unknown quantity. At any
rate, the hour's play should allow
dopesters to obtain a fair amount of
knowledge concerning the newcomers
on the Stanford football field.
An evenly matched game seems to
size the All-Black-Palo Alto Athletic
club match. Both fifteens contain
many excellent players, but lack team
work. When casting a summary
glance over the whole day's play
scheduled, one must admit full value
of entertainment for the season ticket
or fifty cents required for admission.
