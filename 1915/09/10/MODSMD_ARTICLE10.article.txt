# A 						Plea For Aid
## 
### 
Today's assembly brought forth a
great conglomeration of advice, facts
and figures, most of which we have
heard before, although probably ex
pressed in less oratorical fashion. And
the oldest subject of all was the ever
present plea for contributions to the
Belgian Relief Fund. But this plea
was so genuinely presented, was de
livered in such a heart-to-heart man
ner, that the most indifferent member
in the audience must have felt a thrill
of pride as he heard his University
praised in appreciative terms by one
who is actively identified with the
great American work in warring
Europe. The nine thousand dollars
contributed to the fund by the Stan
ford family has meant denial on the
part of many, and further self-abne
gation will be required of us until the
strife is ended. Let us continue to
meet this situation like true men and
women.
