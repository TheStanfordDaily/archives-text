All of us can afford to be more tol
erant of the rest of us who like to
dabble with various brands of the arts
and sciences between classes. Theso
campus people who are trying to
crowd Robert W. Service into the rum
mage basement, and turn Henry Mil
ler loose on the one-night stands, and
show us what 13ryan might have done
with proper forensic training, have
lots of fun along with their comical
ideas.
Who can say that it isn't worth their
while? This isn't a tirade against
lop-sided interest in athletics. There
isn't enough of that yet, though we
all want to see the varsity pin a dis
count tag on Santa Clara and we're
with the teams in tomorrow's games.
Just admit, though, that there may be
something about these long-hair
amusements that we have overlooked.
People who can figure out chess
plays in terms of the fourth dimen
sion, and weep over the Kreutzer
Sonata, and laugh sarcastically at the
Academy of Science have a monopoly
on self-esteem. They can tell us mem
bers of the "element" where to head
off any day. The trouble is that an
intolerant "can't see it" epidemic
spreads once in a while to the men in
charge of our ship of state.
That is wrong altogether. Admit
that these dramatic, and scientific, and
musical, and literary bugs aren't
human. Even at that, we ougnt to
take care of them in a half-hearted
sort of way. 1 luild a fence around
them fo.r self-protection, but let them
prosper. You might try to mix with
them a little. Possibly they may turn
out a couple more Irwin boys or some
one of that kind.
Do most anything you like except
make them beg for student body as

sistance when they want to stage a
concert, or a debate, or any other
kind of enterprise that will represent
Stanford with credit. At times in the
past, they have had to crawl rather
miserably before the funds were
available.
Athletics of every kind we know at
Stanford are all to the good, and we
want them all the time. A university
community, though, needs to pat some
of the other ambitions on the back
once in a while. Give them the best
equipment we are able to give, and
wish them good luck at the same time.
