# Thoburn Likes Football Prospects

Jimmy Thoburn, erstwhile Cardinal
varsity captain, now physical instruc
tor at Oakland Polytechnic School,
visited the campus yesterday, and
quite naturally fluctuated toward the
turf to "look 'em over". Thoburn's
principal comment on the appearance
of the field in general was that the
freshmen were "a husky and likely
looking bunch".
Thoburn prophesies big years for
Stanford in the near future in view r of
the prejudice among prep school men
around the bay against the American
game that California has changed to.
