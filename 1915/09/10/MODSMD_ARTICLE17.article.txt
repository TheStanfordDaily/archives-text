# FRESHMAN DEBATERS HAVE CHANCE TO MAKE TEAMS
## K.E. Lieb Tells Nineteeners of Opportunitiesâ€”Elect Temporary Officers 
### 
"There is a better chance for you to
make the debating team this year
than there has been in the last five
years", declared K. E. Leib, debating
coach, while addressing a dozen fresh
men who were present in room 214 of
the English department last night for
the purpose of organizing a freshman
debating society. Because of the small
number, regular officers were not
elected; those selected temporarily
are: W. C. Fundenberg, chairman,
and G. C. Shields, secretary.
Mr. Leib, in opening the meeting,
spoke at length regarding the method
of debating in vogue at Stanford and
characterized it as the "best debating
system in force in the United States
today." He gave in detail the plan of
the English department, which, in
effect, credits a man with one full
unit toward graduation if he has taken
part in three debates during the
semester.
Another meeting of the newly
formed society will be held next Tues
day evening to elect permanent offi
cers. Meetings will be held regularly,
thereafter, on Thursday evening.
