# SWITCHBOARD TO SUPPLY ENCINA'S MIDNIGHT OIL
## Clubmen Need No Longer Grope in Darkness After Twelve 
### 
Twice now in this world has some- j
one said, "Let there be light", and
there was light. The contrast, how
ever, conies in the fact that in the i
first instance publicity was many
centuries in forthcoming, in the last
instance publicity did its best in less
than twenty-four hours' time.
Encina Club last night decided with
a big hooray to adopt the suggestion
of Farm Superintendent Hewston that
the lights of Encina exist in life as
well as spirit after the naughty hour
of twelve.
Henceforth there will be no occa
sion for a rush and tumble fighting
finish to Encina dances; no occasion
for late queeners to fish for matches,
shoestring!, buckles, and safety pins as
preliminaries to retiring in the dark;
no occasion for flickering candles to
cast weird midnight shadows on wea
ried Beau Brummels —if the men of
Encina practice economy and keep
the electric meter turning at its cus
tomary rate of speed. For if the
monthly bill increases one iota, out
with the lights at twelve, and without
even a warning wink at 11:59. So
says Mr. Hewston, and he and the
light switch are the best of friends.
