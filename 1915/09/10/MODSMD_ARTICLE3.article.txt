# HOEVER PUT OUT
## Says "Aloha Oe" to Hula Lady Love on Deck While Boat Sails for Willows 
### 
Imaginations are not as elastic as,
say, football bladders and chewing
gum, but just for fun stretch yours
and see a city nestling under Hawai
ian hills. See a long low beach, and
waving palms and mango trees; see
a Hawaiian mango swinging in the
breeze; see a Hawaiian peach playing
her ukelele beneath the swaying
branches. Then rub your eyes and
magic! Behold Gus Hoever of Wil
lows, Cal., rambling along with a
baseball and a suit case packed with
unmentionables, mentionables, Hawai
ian junk and trophies of the chase,
previous to leaving the isles, and the
Stanford varsity.
"Goo' bye, 'Stackie'," says Gus to
the peach. "Goo' bye, old girl."
"Oh, Gussie. don't leave me. I'll
cry, I know I shall!"'
"Dry your tears. Now I can no
longer stand in Wobble's way, and I
want to give Steve a chance. And
besides, I'm sore; what's most im
portant there are going to be a swell
house party up at Willows. Cal.
You've heard of Willows, haven't you,
Stackie?"
"I've heard of the Willies."
"And Coxie goes today and they've
got a ticket already for me. Trunk's
packed. If you ever come to Willows
or Paly give the old signal. I'll have
my ear to the ground."
Whereupon Gus heaved to and
headed for his 37th good bye that
morning.
And the band on the "Siberia"
played "Aloha" and the boys were
there for a send-off. So was Gus with
a lei around his neck and a bunch of
mangoes from Stackie under his arm.
Coxie strode on board, displayed his
ticket and took out his handkerchief.
Gus stood like a statue of Mme. Morn
at a Sunday school picnic. The cap
tain heaved the gangplank and Gus
heaved a sigh. But he didn't go on
board.
"Hey, Coxie, have you got my
ticket?" he yelled.
Coxie laughed. So did every one
among those present. Even Stackie
chuckled up what should have been
her sleeve.
"You're not going home, Gus."
"The devil I ain't."
"We haven't any ticket for you."
A put-up job, and did Gus display
terrible passion? You guessed it.
