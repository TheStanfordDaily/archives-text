Judge Taft, now in the Pacific
states on one lap of his lecture tour
of the country, will arrive in Palo
Alto Tuesday morning. He is to be
driven in an automobile to the foot
ball turf where he will speak to the
members of the university and their
friends on "Our Foreign Relation
ships". According to what has been
written of the former president on
his latest tour, he will take no time
for preliminaries, but will head into
his subject with his characteristic,
easy-going, unassuming manner.
Judge Taft has been in the west a
fortnight. He has spoken several
times at the University of California,
and in San Francisco. In the Berkeley
Greek Theatre *r. Taft gave a series
of lectures on "The Presidency; Its
Powers, Duties, and Limitations". In
Seattle on Wednesday the former ex
ecutive gave what he characterized as
the first political talk of his present
tour. He described the California is
sues, and said that non-partisanship is
but a ruse of leaders to disguise real
issues.
A special platform will be erected
for Tuesday's lecture on the turf
where the bleachers form an "L" near
the training house.
Tickets for the Stanford reserved
sections G, H, and part of I are to be
had at the Registrar's office Monday
afternoon, and Tuesday morning
if any remain. The public will be
admitted without pasteboards at any
but the above mentioned gates.
