# ASSEMBLY CLARIFIES PROBLEMS
## Leads To Better Understanding of Issues Involved 
### 
"The purpose of today's assembly 13
to extend a further welcome to out
new students, and to star the year
with a better understanding of the
problems facing us."
These were the opening words of
Student Body President P. R. Wilson.
'16, at the first student body gathering
of the semester. Wilson's words, and
those uttered by his successors on the
platform were an assurance that the
gathering today could be labeled an
unqualified success, that it was not
in vain, and that those present could
"start the year with a better under
standing of the problems" that face
them.
Wilson Outlines Organization.
Wilson outlined the various govern
ing bodies of Stanford student organi
zation, then summarized the circum
stances that brought about present
intercollegiate .relations.
"It is to be regretted in a way,"
said Wilson, "that we are not meeting
California this year. Yet this is a
golden opportunity for Stanford. Wo
are going to fight a moral battle; we
are going to stand on our own feet
and we a,re going to win. Athletics
were never on a higher plane than at
the present time."
Wilson then stole a scrutinizing
glance at the future, clearly painting
a picture that showed that Berkeley
ardor would undoubtedly be dampened.
Her colors would .run, Wilson implied,
and leave a murky shade of green. A
golden year for Stanford, Wilson
prophesied, meaning that the gold
would be stolen from Calirornia, leav
ing for them the blue.

.Miss Fisher Talks to Women.
Miss Hazel Fisher, 'IG, head of the
Women's Conference, followed Wil
son, and speaking to the women, im
pressed them with the fact, that by
virtue of their registration, they have
become members of Stanford's stu
dent organizations.
Simonson Is Heard.
Student Advisor, S. S. Simonson, '14,
spoke to upperclassmen and under
classmen, emphasizing the point that
"student control is self-control", and
that the government by students is
based upon the co-operation and feel
ing of personal responsibility of every
man in the University, meaning lib
erty, not license.
"The trouble with most of us," de
clared Simonson, "and the greatest
weakness found in student control, is
not ignorance of the fundamental
principles-r-it is the shifting of re
sponsibilities."
Graduate Manager Speaks.
E. C. Behrens, '14, Graduate Man
ager, presented statistics that brought
to light a vivid comparison of the
financial situation as it was and is.
"Stanford will take up California's
slogan to go east for competition,"
Behrens said. "The track team may
go east and we haven't forgotten the
crew. Oregon is anxious to meet Stan
ford in track and baseball."
Chancellor Jordan Surprises.
The main tent today was undoubt
edly the discussion of student govern
ment and a resume and forecast of
the athletic situation. But a side
show crept in and took away some of
the glory. Mrs. Herbert C. Hoover
pulled, today's assembly out of the
rut that cut and dried assemblies have
followed since Stanford's first year.
Chancellor Jordan's appearance was
in itsef a surprise, but when he pre
sented Mrs. Herbert C. Hoover, '98,
wife of him who fathered the Union,
who labored and still labors in Bel
gium as head of the American Com
mission for Relief, the goodly round of
applause more than said, "We're glad
to see you, Mrs. Hoover."
"I bring a message from the old
guard, to say what we think of you,"
Mrs. Hoover began.
"You sent so much over to Belgium
in the way of men and money, that
you ought to have a report—you ought
to know the details, —you ought to
know of the marvelous machine that
gets food, and brings it to where it is
needed.
"There hasn't been any starvation
in Belgium this year. There hasn't
been one hungry person in Belgium
since November, unless due to per
sonal carelessness. The only thing
that lias stood between the victims of
the war and their fate was the ma
chine which you helped to putin
motion.
"Twenty-five hundred dollars came
from this campus in one day. That
brought a thrill of enthusiasm to the
men working for Belgium. Their
voices grow husky now when they
tell of it. The first money came from
Stanford. Your support was the
I greatest of all.
"Over $9,000 came from this campus
I and its influence—an entire food sup
ply for 200 people since November."

"There hasn't been any starvation
in Belgium this year. There hasn't
been one hungry person in Belgium
since November, unless due to per

"Over $9,000 came from this campus
I and its influence—an entire food sup

"The purpose of today's assembly 13
to extend a further welcome to out
new students, and to star the year
with a better understanding of the
problems facing us."
These were the opening words of
Student Body President P. R. Wilson.
'16, at the first student body gathering
of the semester. Wilson's words, and
those uttered by his successors on the
platform were an assurance that the
gathering today could be labeled an
unqualified success, that it was not
in vain, and that those present could
"start the year with a better under
standing of the problems" that face
them.
Wilson Outlines Organization.
Wilson outlined the various govern
ing bodies of Stanford student organi
zation, then summarized the circum
stances that brought about present
intercollegiate .relations.
"It is to be regretted in a way,"
said Wilson, "that we are not meeting
California this year. Yet this is a
golden opportunity for Stanford. Wo
are going to fight a moral battle; we
are going to stand on our own feet
and we a,re going to win. Athletics
were never on a higher plane than at
the present time."
Wilson then stole a scrutinizing
glance at the future, clearly painting
a picture that showed that Berkeley
ardor would undoubtedly be dampened.
Her colors would .run, Wilson implied,
and leave a murky shade of green. A
golden year for Stanford, Wilson
prophesied, meaning that the gold
would be stolen from Calirornia, leav
ing for them the blue.

.Miss Fisher Talks to Women.
Miss Hazel Fisher, 'IG, head of the
Women's Conference, followed Wil
son, and speaking to the women, im
pressed them with the fact, that by
virtue of their registration, they have
become members of Stanford's stu
dent organizations.
Simonson Is Heard.
Student Advisor, S. S. Simonson, '14,
spoke to upperclassmen and under
classmen, emphasizing the point that
"student control is self-control", and
that the government by students is
based upon the co-operation and feel
ing of personal responsibility of every
man in the University, meaning lib
erty, not license.
"The trouble with most of us," de
clared Simonson, "and the greatest
weakness found in student control, is
not ignorance of the fundamental
principles-r-it is the shifting of re
sponsibilities."
Graduate Manager Speaks.
E. C. Behrens, '14, Graduate Man
ager, presented statistics that brought
to light a vivid comparison of the
financial situation as it was and is.
"Stanford will take up California's
slogan to go east for competition,"
Behrens said. "The track team may
go east and we haven't forgotten the
crew. Oregon is anxious to meet Stan
ford in track and baseball."
Chancellor Jordan Surprises.
The main tent today was undoubt
edly the discussion of student govern
ment and a resume and forecast of
the athletic situation. But a side
show crept in and took away some of
the glory. Mrs. Herbert C. Hoover
pulled, today's assembly out of the
rut that cut and dried assemblies have
followed since Stanford's first year.
Chancellor Jordan's appearance was
in itsef a surprise, but when he pre
sented Mrs. Herbert C. Hoover, '98,
wife of him who fathered the Union,
who labored and still labors in Bel
gium as head of the American Com
mission for Relief, the goodly round of
applause more than said, "We're glad
to see you, Mrs. Hoover."
"I bring a message from the old
guard, to say what we think of you,"
Mrs. Hoover began.
"You sent so much over to Belgium
in the way of men and money, that
you ought to have a report—you ought
to know the details, —you ought to
know of the marvelous machine that
gets food, and brings it to where it is
needed.
