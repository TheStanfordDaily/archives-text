# EVEN BREAK AFFORDED STANFORD TEAMS SATURDAY
## MEDIOCRE RUGBY DISPLAYED Varsity-Olympic Game Results In Scoreless Tie---Freshmen Show Great Promise 
### 
Saturday afternoon's rugby play
permitted the award of an even break
to Stanford when considered on a
percentage basis, since victory, tie,
and defeat in order were chalked up
on the score column. A summary of
events shows that the freshmen
romped away with a 23 to t! game over
the San Francisco Polytechnic high
school, the varsity and Olympics
fought to a scoreless standstill, and
that the Palo Alto Athletic Club
closed the program by winning S to 5
from the All-Blacks.
IMi'ticult Problem.
The three hours turf entertainment
served before a large crowd had two
points of interest to local rugby en
thusiasts. First, plenty of slashing,
but far from brilliant football was
exhibited, while on the other hand
dopesters were given a clear under
standing of the gigantic problem that
faces Coach Brown this season. It
was chiefly the latter that held the
vantage boards.
After witnessing the varsity in
action, it was apparent that several
weeks of consistent hard work and
constant experimenting will be found
necessary to build up a powerful rug
by machine comparing favorably with
last year's coast champion. Only four
members of the 1914 varsity, Pettin
gill, Wylie, Carroll, and Urban, were
seen in their old positions.
Ragged Team Work,
JJinl Wylie and Joe Braderi, the pair
of Cardinal breakaways, were a tower
of strength both tth the defensive and
offensive throughout Saturday's gams.
The remainder of the pack, however,
did not class in the same constella
tion, failing to follow their lead. The
front rank combination ot' Bihlman,
Knight, and Rehm showed possibili
ties, but no particular merit, in the
first play together. Allowances should
be made for the fact that the trio
were consistently outhooked, as the |
three men have not had sufficient i
practice in their positions.
Swigart at second five played a
heady and consistent game until he
was removed on account of an injury.
He was replaced by Bacon.
Fast play on the part of the varsity
backfield was not evident. Whenever
Captain Carroll, Joe Urban, or Diev- |
endorff were permitted to handle the 1
ball together, they performed very i
creditably. The five-eighths, how- I
ever, failed to feed their speedy scor
ers. Summing up the contest as a
whole, it is safe to say that the
Winged "O" ruggers, but for costly
fumbles, off-sides and knock-ons,
would have white-washed Stanford
8 to 0.
Olympics Dangerous.
After the first five minutes in the
opening half, the local goal line was
continually the subject of dangerous
.rushes. Three Olympic scores were
narrowly averted in this period. Bacon
saved back of the line on one occasion,
while on another Austin missed a
difficult goal on a free kick. Later
Carroll saved a certain try by pre
venting Quill from crossing.
The second half developed some
warm fighting. Following Montgom
ery's unsuccessful attempt at a goal,
Walker led his team down to the Olym
pic's fifteen yard line by consistent
rushes, but the five-eighths lacked the
necessary punch. A few moments
later, until the end of the game, Stan
ford was fighting valiantly to defend
1 herself against the visitors smashing
| offense. The whistle found the pig-
I skin well in Stanford ter.ritorv.

Freshman Walkaway.
The Polytechnic high school players
, were outclassed by the freshmen right
! from the start. Davis crossed by cir
j cling the scrum from half back at
one time in the first period, while later
a passing rush from Davis to Mont
gomery to Boydston, resulted in the
latter's score. Boulware converted
both from difficult angles. The count
at half-time stood 10 to 0. In the
second period the contest did not re
main quite so one-sided. For the
freshmen, Long, Boydston, and Kat
ten registered tries, while Conlin and
Moessner scored for the visitors on
what might truthfully be termed lucky
breaks. Twenty-three to six was the
final score.
Several of the newcomers in the
ranks of Stanford footballers show
promising futures if their work Sat
urday may be taken as a basis. Flu
gel, Boulware. and Weiler played well
j among the forwards, while Davis,
I Boydston, and Katten showed to ad
vantage among the backs.
All-Blacks Lose See-Saw Battle.
C.v Davidson's I'alo Alto Athletic
[ Club, minus the majority of its regu-
I lar players managed to land on the
long end in the final match of the day,
8 to n. In the first half after Card
j had made a thirty-yard get-a-way,
Fleishman snapped the ball to Olaine
who went across for three points, but
failed to convert. Wallace, for f he
second team, tied matters in the sec
ond period. Templeton placed the
pigskin between the posts. Towards
I the end of the fray, Mcßlroy scored,
thereby annexing the contest. Sr.iith
erum, Haven, Adams and Wallace lead
the All-Blacks, while Card starred for
the clubmen.
In the forenoon the Grays demon
strated their superiority over the

to nothing. The line-ups used Sat
urday follow:

IMi'ticult Problem.
The three hours turf entertainment
served before a large crowd had two
points of interest to local rugby en
thusiasts. First, plenty of slashing,
but far from brilliant football was
exhibited, while on the other hand
dopesters were given a clear under
standing of the gigantic problem that
faces Coach Brown this season. It
was chiefly the latter that held the
vantage boards.
After witnessing the varsity in
action, it was apparent that several
weeks of consistent hard work and
constant experimenting will be found
necessary to build up a powerful rug
by machine comparing favorably with
last year's coast champion. Only four
members of the 1914 varsity, Pettin
gill, Wylie, Carroll, and Urban, were
seen in their old positions.
Ragged Team Work,
JJinl Wylie and Joe Braderi, the pair
of Cardinal breakaways, were a tower
of strength both tth the defensive and
offensive throughout Saturday's gams.
The remainder of the pack, however,
did not class in the same constella
tion, failing to follow their lead. The
front rank combination ot' Bihlman,
Knight, and Rehm showed possibili
ties, but no particular merit, in the
first play together. Allowances should
be made for the fact that the trio
were consistently outhooked, as the |
three men have not had sufficient i
practice in their positions.
Swigart at second five played a
heady and consistent game until he
was removed on account of an injury.
He was replaced by Bacon.
Fast play on the part of the varsity
backfield was not evident. Whenever
Captain Carroll, Joe Urban, or Diev- |
endorff were permitted to handle the 1
ball together, they performed very i
creditably. The five-eighths, how- I
ever, failed to feed their speedy scor
ers. Summing up the contest as a
whole, it is safe to say that the
Winged "O" ruggers, but for costly
fumbles, off-sides and knock-ons,
would have white-washed Stanford
8 to 0.
Olympics Dangerous.
After the first five minutes in the
opening half, the local goal line was
continually the subject of dangerous
.rushes. Three Olympic scores were
narrowly averted in this period. Bacon
saved back of the line on one occasion,
while on another Austin missed a
difficult goal on a free kick. Later
Carroll saved a certain try by pre
venting Quill from crossing.
The second half developed some
warm fighting. Following Montgom
ery's unsuccessful attempt at a goal,
Walker led his team down to the Olym
pic's fifteen yard line by consistent
rushes, but the five-eighths lacked the
necessary punch. A few moments
later, until the end of the game, Stan
ford was fighting valiantly to defend
1 herself against the visitors smashing
| offense. The whistle found the pig-
I skin well in Stanford ter.ritorv.

Freshman Walkaway.
The Polytechnic high school players
, were outclassed by the freshmen right
! from the start. Davis crossed by cir
j cling the scrum from half back at
one time in the first period, while later
a passing rush from Davis to Mont
gomery to Boydston, resulted in the
latter's score. Boulware converted
both from difficult angles. The count
at half-time stood 10 to 0. In the
second period the contest did not re
main quite so one-sided. For the
freshmen, Long, Boydston, and Kat
ten registered tries, while Conlin and
Moessner scored for the visitors on
what might truthfully be termed lucky
breaks. Twenty-three to six was the
final score.
Several of the newcomers in the
ranks of Stanford footballers show
promising futures if their work Sat
urday may be taken as a basis. Flu
gel, Boulware. and Weiler played well
j among the forwards, while Davis,
I Boydston, and Katten showed to ad
vantage among the backs.
All-Blacks Lose See-Saw Battle.
C.v Davidson's I'alo Alto Athletic
[ Club, minus the majority of its regu-
I lar players managed to land on the
long end in the final match of the day,
8 to n. In the first half after Card
j had made a thirty-yard get-a-way,
Fleishman snapped the ball to Olaine
who went across for three points, but
failed to convert. Wallace, for f he
second team, tied matters in the sec
ond period. Templeton placed the
pigskin between the posts. Towards
I the end of the fray, Mcßlroy scored,
thereby annexing the contest. Sr.iith
erum, Haven, Adams and Wallace lead
the All-Blacks, while Card starred for
the clubmen.
In the forenoon the Grays demon
strated their superiority over the

to nothing. The line-ups used Sat

Saturday afternoon's rugby play
permitted the award of an even break
to Stanford when considered on a
percentage basis, since victory, tie,
and defeat in order were chalked up
on the score column. A summary of
events shows that the freshmen
romped away with a 23 to t! game over
the San Francisco Polytechnic high
school, the varsity and Olympics
fought to a scoreless standstill, and
that the Palo Alto Athletic Club
closed the program by winning S to 5

last year's coast champion. Only four
members of the 1914 varsity, Pettin
gill, Wylie, Carroll, and Urban, were
seen in their old positions.
Ragged Team Work,
JJinl Wylie and Joe Braderi, the pair
of Cardinal breakaways, were a tower
of strength both tth the defensive and
offensive throughout Saturday's gams.
The remainder of the pack, however,
did not class in the same constella
tion, failing to follow their lead. The
front rank combination ot' Bihlman,
Knight, and Rehm showed possibili
ties, but no particular merit, in the
first play together. Allowances should
be made for the fact that the trio
were consistently outhooked, as the |
three men have not had sufficient i
practice in their positions.
Swigart at second five played a
heady and consistent game until he
was removed on account of an injury.
He was replaced by Bacon.
Fast play on the part of the varsity
backfield was not evident. Whenever
Captain Carroll, Joe Urban, or Diev- |
endorff were permitted to handle the 1
ball together, they performed very i
creditably. The five-eighths, how- I
ever, failed to feed their speedy scor
ers. Summing up the contest as a
whole, it is safe to say that the
Winged "O" ruggers, but for costly
fumbles, off-sides and knock-ons,
would have white-washed Stanford
8 to 0.
Olympics Dangerous.
After the first five minutes in the
opening half, the local goal line was
continually the subject of dangerous
.rushes. Three Olympic scores were
narrowly averted in this period. Bacon
saved back of the line on one occasion,
while on another Austin missed a
difficult goal on a free kick. Later
Carroll saved a certain try by pre
venting Quill from crossing.
The second half developed some
warm fighting. Following Montgom
ery's unsuccessful attempt at a goal,
Walker led his team down to the Olym
pic's fifteen yard line by consistent
rushes, but the five-eighths lacked the
necessary punch. A few moments
later, until the end of the game, Stan
ford was fighting valiantly to defend
1 herself against the visitors smashing
| offense. The whistle found the pig-

Freshman Walkaway.
The Polytechnic high school players
, were outclassed by the freshmen right
! from the start. Davis crossed by cir
j cling the scrum from half back at
one time in the first period, while later
a passing rush from Davis to Mont
gomery to Boydston, resulted in the
latter's score. Boulware converted
both from difficult angles. The count
at half-time stood 10 to 0. In the
second period the contest did not re
main quite so one-sided. For the
freshmen, Long, Boydston, and Kat
ten registered tries, while Conlin and
Moessner scored for the visitors on
what might truthfully be termed lucky
breaks. Twenty-three to six was the
final score.
Several of the newcomers in the
ranks of Stanford footballers show
promising futures if their work Sat
urday may be taken as a basis. Flu
gel, Boulware. and Weiler played well
j among the forwards, while Davis,
I Boydston, and Katten showed to ad
vantage among the backs.
All-Blacks Lose See-Saw Battle.
C.v Davidson's I'alo Alto Athletic
[ Club, minus the majority of its regu-
I lar players managed to land on the
long end in the final match of the day,
8 to n. In the first half after Card
j had made a thirty-yard get-a-way,
Fleishman snapped the ball to Olaine
who went across for three points, but
failed to convert. Wallace, for f he
second team, tied matters in the sec
ond period. Templeton placed the
pigskin between the posts. Towards
I the end of the fray, Mcßlroy scored,
thereby annexing the contest. Sr.iith
erum, Haven, Adams and Wallace lead
the All-Blacks, while Card starred for
the clubmen.
In the forenoon the Grays demon
strated their superiority over the
Blacks in a ragged game, seven tries
to nothing. The line-ups used Sat
urday follow:

Saturday afternoon's rugby play
permitted the award of an even break
to Stanford when considered on a
percentage basis, since victory, tie,
and defeat in order were chalked up
on the score column. A summary of
events shows that the freshmen
romped away with a 23 to t! game over
the San Francisco Polytechnic high
school, the varsity and Olympics
fought to a scoreless standstill, and
that the Palo Alto Athletic Club
closed the program by winning S to 5
from the All-Blacks.
IMi'ticult Problem.
The three hours turf entertainment
served before a large crowd had two
points of interest to local rugby en
thusiasts. First, plenty of slashing,
but far from brilliant football was
exhibited, while on the other hand
dopesters were given a clear under
standing of the gigantic problem that
faces Coach Brown this season. It
was chiefly the latter that held the
vantage boards.
After witnessing the varsity in
action, it was apparent that several
weeks of consistent hard work and
constant experimenting will be found
necessary to build up a powerful rug
by machine comparing favorably with
last year's coast champion. Only four
members of the 1914 varsity, Pettin
gill, Wylie, Carroll, and Urban, were

first play together. Allowances should
be made for the fact that the trio
were consistently outhooked, as the |
three men have not had sufficient i
practice in their positions.
Swigart at second five played a
heady and consistent game until he
was removed on account of an injury.
He was replaced by Bacon.
Fast play on the part of the varsity
backfield was not evident. Whenever
Captain Carroll, Joe Urban, or Diev- |
endorff were permitted to handle the 1
ball together, they performed very i
creditably. The five-eighths, how- I
ever, failed to feed their speedy scor
ers. Summing up the contest as a
whole, it is safe to say that the
Winged "O" ruggers, but for costly
fumbles, off-sides and knock-ons,
would have white-washed Stanford
8 to 0.
Olympics Dangerous.
After the first five minutes in the
opening half, the local goal line was
continually the subject of dangerous
.rushes. Three Olympic scores were
narrowly averted in this period. Bacon
saved back of the line on one occasion,
while on another Austin missed a
difficult goal on a free kick. Later
Carroll saved a certain try by pre
venting Quill from crossing.
The second half developed some
warm fighting. Following Montgom
ery's unsuccessful attempt at a goal,
Walker led his team down to the Olym
pic's fifteen yard line by consistent
rushes, but the five-eighths lacked the
necessary punch. A few moments
later, until the end of the game, Stan
ford was fighting valiantly to defend
1 herself against the visitors smashing
| offense. The whistle found the pig-
I skin well in Stanford ter.ritorv.

Freshman Walkaway.
The Polytechnic high school players
, were outclassed by the freshmen right
! from the start. Davis crossed by cir
j cling the scrum from half back at
one time in the first period, while later
a passing rush from Davis to Mont
gomery to Boydston, resulted in the
latter's score. Boulware converted
both from difficult angles. The count
at half-time stood 10 to 0. In the
second period the contest did not re
main quite so one-sided. For the
freshmen, Long, Boydston, and Kat
ten registered tries, while Conlin and
Moessner scored for the visitors on
what might truthfully be termed lucky
breaks. Twenty-three to six was the
final score.
Several of the newcomers in the
ranks of Stanford footballers show
promising futures if their work Sat
urday may be taken as a basis. Flu
gel, Boulware. and Weiler played well
j among the forwards, while Davis,
I Boydston, and Katten showed to ad
vantage among the backs.
All-Blacks Lose See-Saw Battle.
C.v Davidson's I'alo Alto Athletic
[ Club, minus the majority of its regu-
I lar players managed to land on the
long end in the final match of the day,
8 to n. In the first half after Card
j had made a thirty-yard get-a-way,
Fleishman snapped the ball to Olaine
who went across for three points, but
failed to convert. Wallace, for f he
second team, tied matters in the sec
ond period. Templeton placed the
pigskin between the posts. Towards
I the end of the fray, Mcßlroy scored,
thereby annexing the contest. Sr.iith
erum, Haven, Adams and Wallace lead
the All-Blacks, while Card starred for
the clubmen.
