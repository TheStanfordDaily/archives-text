# GUM SHOES BAFFLED
## Chi Phi Sleuths Fail to Round Up Sigma kappa Marauder 
### 
Hush! The chimes have chimed the
w-w-w-itching hours of w-w-w-one.
The boola birds chime in, and all is
still on Salvatierra save a stealthy
drip drip in the kitchen of use-to-be-
Mariposa club. It is but escaping
Searsville aqua, but the scared little
junior tucked in on the floor above
knows it not. A scream rents the air
—would have been cheapcr to have
taken out a lease—and Sigma Kappa
in evening gowns and Japanese soap
wrappers, takes the limelight.
"Girls (shriek), girls, a man, a bur
glar—in—the kitchen!"
"Quick, here's a pledge pin! Are
you sure it's a man?"
"The telephone, girls, the D. U.'s are
husky!"
"No, sir, I won't have the D. U.'s in
this house! 1 want the Chi Psis. I
like their dancing!"
"And they've got more glee club
members."
"No, girls, we want the D. U.'s.
Think of a poor burglar fighting all
those crew men. It shall be the D.
U.s. The number is 1-1-1-2."
But the poor frightened little Sigma
st-st-stuttered t-t-terribly and had
only said, "G-g-give me w-w-one, w
w-w-one, w-w-w-one," when central
got to work and gave her 1-1-1-1. And
the Chi Psis came over, but not in
evening dress, upturned Sigma Kappa
House from chimney top to cellar.
Every room, every door, all the cup
boards, all the drawers, all the chests,
hurriedly opened and examined in the
hopes of finding something that
shouln'nt be found. If there was a
burglar, he should report at once to
Chi Psi Lodge, for a pledge pin, to
Carnegie for a medal and to the D. U.s
for another assignment.
