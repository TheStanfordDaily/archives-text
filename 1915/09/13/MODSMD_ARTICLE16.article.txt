Stanford is ready to welcome Wil
lam Howard Taft. Although we don't
know whether to call him Professor, or
Judge, or just plain Mister, we are in
a mood to accept him as one who "be
longs", because he is a fellow member
of the college world. Perhaps he may
let drop a word or two about under
graduate life in the far east, by way
of making himself feel at home.
Away and above all, we are ready to
listen to his comment on diplomatic
relations, and other affairs of state.
Very likely he won't devote much time
to the Stanford-California situation,
but we must excuse that.
All of us can prepare to leave the
football bleachers tomorrow noon
with some definite opinions regarding
the national administration, and the
problems it has met, and the ones it
has still to meet. Through many years
of public life, Mr. Taft has worked in
positions wihch fitted him completely
for the comment on foreign relations
which he will present to us.
As governor-general of the Philip
pines, as secretary of war in Presi
dent Roosevelt's cabinet, as chief ex
ecutive of the United States, and as
an active observer of national policy
during the past three years, he has
rubbed shoulders with men in the con
duct of diplomacy.
It may be ventured that those of us
who esteem President Wilson already
will esteem him more intelligently,
and more heartily after we have spent
an hour with our distinguished visitor.
