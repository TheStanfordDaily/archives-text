With a text of "If ye have not been
faithful in that which is another's,
who will give you that which is your
own?" Reverend William Pierson Mor
rill, of New York, preached to a large
congregation in the Memorial Church
yesterday morning.
In the sermon he showed that it is
only by taking the thoughts and teach
ings of others and working through
them that one will secure a true faith
and religion of one's own. "How does
a man get any knowledge of his own?
That is what true education is; not
being filled with facts belonging to
other people, but being equipped with
knowledge of one's own by taking that
of other's and building on it.
"Education is the process of winning
what is on's own through the faithful
use of what is given us by other men.
It is through the use of others' pray
ers that you come most surely to a
prayer of your own."
Reverend Merrill will preach from
the pill pit of the Memorial Church for
the remainder of the month.
