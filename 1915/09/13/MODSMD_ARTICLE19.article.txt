Stanford University, Cal.,
September 8, 1915.
To the Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
It was with surprise that we read in
your issue of September sixth that the
members of the Stanford Union were
slighted or piqued because the women
of the university had not accepted
their invitation to visit the Union on
Sunday afternoon.
Was the writer really serious? Does
he call the article that appeared on
September third entitled "Equal
Rights for All" an invitation? Such
a departure in style and tone from
the usual courtesy of Stanford men
must account for the fact that we did
not understand it as an "invitation".
We read "billiards, smoking rooms â€”"
and wondered what was meant.
If our friends at the Union were em
barrassed by our disregard and appar
ent lack of appreciation, we can only
offer this explanation as the key to
the situation.
Sincerely,
LUCILE CURTIS.
