# Constitutional Election Provision Overlooked
## Custom Unwittingly Disregards a Basic Rule of Student Body Procedure 
### 
Custom has in the past overcome the
provisions ut' the Conference consti
tution to tiie extent of placing Confer
ence members in office for one year
terms, whereas the constitution pro
vides for only two-year terms. In
addition to this, vacancies have been
tilled for unexpired terms only; but
again it is found that all members are
elected for terms of two years from
time of election.
Consequently, because of the dis
covery of this constitutional provi
sion, after the recent departmental
conference elections, certain positions
are found to have more than one
claimant.
All of the old members of the Con
ference, including the members at
large who were supposedly elected for
one-year terms, will meet in the
Council room at 7:30 Thursday even
ing to decide upon the legitimacy of
these claims. New members are urged
to be present.
Student body nominations for five
members at large failed to take place
in the Chapel today as scheduled and
these nominations and the elections to
follow them have been postponed until
next week, following the decision of
the Conference Thursday concerning
the question as to whether these posi
tions are still open.
Luckily, owing to the failure of men
to return, the only contested places on
the Conference are among the repre
sentatives at large and those of the
Law department.
