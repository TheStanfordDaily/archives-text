out for the team have been given a
several weeks' workout.

est Rrandsten promises to remove this
remaining obstacle on Thursday when
the finished tank will probably be
thrown open to the students.

laying the concrete walk around the
sides, while the walls and floor, which
have been in place for some time, are
having ample time to set and dry be

earlier introduction on the library
lawn.

taking swimming lessons in connec
tion with gymnasium work.

had no place to practice, Brandsten
states that he is well pleased with the
prospect for turning out a high grade
team this year. He has had several
years experience as an instructor of
swimming and is one of the best div
ing experts 011 the coast.

he coached before coming to Stanford.

coming out are Worth, Orme, McEuen.
