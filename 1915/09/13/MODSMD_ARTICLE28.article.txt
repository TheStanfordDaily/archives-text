# POLITY CLUB MEETS
## Professor Martin Gives Last Talkâ€” Vacancy to be Filled by Professor Vann 
### 
The speakers at the conference of
the International Polity Club held last
evening were Professors P. A. Martin
and E. R. Vann.
Professor Martin's topic was "Pan
American Relations" in which he
showed in what manner the relations
between the United States and the
Latin countries may be improved. He
laid stress on the opportunity that the
European war is giving the United
States to develop trade if only the
American merchants would change
their attitudes. Professor Vann spoke
on the Monroe doctrine and its inter
pretations.
