# ENGINEERING CONGRESS SENDS INVITATION TO STANFORD
## UPPERCLASSMEN TO ATTEND President Branner Grants Ten Day Vacation Beginning September 16 
### 
All engineering students of Stan
ford have boon extended a special in
vitation tf) attend the meetings of the

senior and graduate students from
classes during this period.
The International Engineering Con
gress has as its purpose the bringing
together of engineers from all parts
of the world for personal as well as
professional discussion and for the
reading and discussion of papers on
engineering subjects. Tt is being held
under the auspices of the five senior
national engineering societies, namely:
American Institute of Mining Engi-
American Institute of Mininfl Engi
neers, American Society of Mechanical
Engineers, American Institute of Elec
trical Engineers, Society of Naval Ar
chitects and Marine Engineers.
These societies h'-vr placed the man
agement of the congress in the hands
of a. commttee consisting of thirty
members of whom Professor W. F.
Durand of Stanford is the chairman.
Professor C. D. Marx, president of the

The work of the congress is divided
among eleven sections as follows:

national engineering societies, namely:
American Institute of Mining Engi-
American Institute of Mininfl Engi
neers, American Society of Mechanical
Engineers, American Institute of Elec
trical Engineers, Society of Naval Ar

These societies h'-vr placed the man

but notwithstanding this condition
| there will be more than two hundred
i papers by foreign members presented
! in the various sections, representing
some eighteen foreign countries.
The first four days will be taken up
with individual conventions of four
of the engineering societies and the
excuse from regular classes will make
it possible for upper-classmen to at
tend these meetings also.
The work of the congress is divided
among eleven sections as follows:
1. Panama Canal.
2. Waterways and Irrigation .
3. Municipal Engineering.
4. Railways.
