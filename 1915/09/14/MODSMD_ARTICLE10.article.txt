# Domes to be Used as Hot House
## 
### 
Students who have been mystified
by the two glass domes that were
erected during the summer bthind the
post office have the mystery cleared
up at last.
It has been announced that they will
bs used as hot houses to replace those
now in back of the Museum. Flowers
raised in these hot houses will be
planted in the vicinity of the Union
and post office, beautifying the now
barren spaces along the road.
