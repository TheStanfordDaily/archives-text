## TO MEET TODAY'S WINNERS Underclass Contest Featured By Fast Open Plays and Passes 
### 
In the first interclass rugby game
yesterday afternoon, the sophomore
fifteen emerged on the long end of a
1(! to 5 score over the freshmen. The
keen rivalry existing between the
lower classmen made the contest the
fastest and best yet staged on the
Stanford turf. The victory will allow
the 1918 aggregation to play in the
finals scheduled for Thursday.
The initial try of the opening half
was a clever exhibition of the English
game. Walker .received a short kick
on 1919's thirty-yard line, and from
the sophomore half back the ball trav
eled quickly between Greve, Jeffers,
Herron, and Wallace, the latter scor
ing. Templeton converted. Wallace
registered again a few minutes later,
taking the ball from the loose at the
fifteen yard line. Templeton raised
the total to ten points.
The second period found the ball
during the majority of play in sopho
more territory. A long dribbling rush
by the 1918 pack allowed Alderton
to fall on the pigskin when ove,r the
line. Templeton failed at a difficult
conversion. Following the drop-out,
1919 forwards brought the play back
to their opponents twenty-yard line,
from where Flugel dashed over for the
lone freshmen try. Boulware kicked
a beautiful goal. The final score was
the .result of a twenty-five-yard run
by Chandler. Failure at conversion
left the total count at 16 to 5.
The sophomore ruggers showed well
yesterday. Fisher, Johnson and
Chandler were on the ball at all stages
of the game for the forwards, while
Walker, Wallace, and Templeton
played gilt edged rugby among the
backs.
