# Foxing the Joker

There's no telling liow far back in
dim history the precedent lies. But
some time or other, somebody started
lis on a system of Conference elec
tions which chuckles at definite con
stitutional rules. None of us have
much license to snarl rabidly at any
one save ourselves, since the whole
community has been dozing. The il
legal process was discovered only
yesterday, by the studtnt adviser, who
likely was feeling mean and com
bative.
It's the easiest thing in the world
for us to put ourselves on the roll
call as progressives by saying that
the short term elections of common
custom are much better than the in
flexible two-year periods prescribed
fo.r all representatives chosen at reg
ular or special elections. Not only
that, but we can put up some pretty
good talking points. Best get the an
cient history out of the way first,
though, before we let the new era
dawn.
Representatives from various de
partments have been chosen on three
different bases, since a time which
likely antedates the present organi
zation'of student control. Each de
partment is entitled to one represen
tative for every forty male students
enrolled, election being based on the
votes of electors who have fifty hours
or more of university credit.
Depending on the number of Con
ference vacancies existing fo,r a given
department, a certain number of can
didates polling the heaviest vote In
in that department have been installed
for two-year terms. Others have been
putin office for shorter periods, to
till the unexpired terms of members
absent from the university, or unable
to ?.,'ve for other reasons. Repre
sentatives-at-large have invariably
been chosen at general election, for
the space of one year.
Xow we are ready for the joker.
The Conference constitution, adopted
in 1912, says: "Members of this Con
ference, elected at a general or spe
cial election, shall serve fo.r two
years."
Simply, election of a representa
tive to fill six months or a year of an
unexpired term, or election of a rep
resentative-at-large for a one-year
term is illegal.
Next Thursday evening, the mem
bers of the Conference who hold office
from last semester, —including those
who thought they were chosen for one
semester only, will meet. The twenty
men elected last Friday will be asked
to attend, but will have no voice in
settling the difficulty, since they are
members "de facto", not qualified to
have a voice. The voting members of
the Conference will unravel kinks
either by amending the constitution,

so that in future it will allow continu
ance of the customary procedure, or
they will decide to abide by the con
stitution, and enforce the two-year
term rule universally.
There is occasion now to make our
recommendation. We favor the sys
tem of elections which has been in
effect, and think that the constitution
should be amended accordingly. In
order to avoid perversion of the "ex
post facto" principle, any change
made cannot offect the present mem
bers of the Conference who should re
tain office according to the regulation.
They should remain active until their
terms expire. Further, the election of
some of the twenty men chosen last
Fridav should be cancelled.
Fortunately, comparatively few of
the men elected last year on the short
term theory have returned to college,
so a re-election according to the
amended constitution will probably re
instate most of the recent candidates
in the Conference.
Briefly, provision should be made
for election in the future, fo.r two
year terms, and for the completion of
unexpired terms, and for election of
members at large for periods of one
year. The two-year term for candi
dates receiving the heartiest support
in a given department, is advocated
because long service tends to good re
sults when the officers are capable.
The men most favored in a depart
ment election are likely to be good
men, else they would not be indorsed
by the men who work with them, and
know them. The "idol" influence,
which regrettably drags some of our
public offices into the mire, is not
dangerous.
Election of members at large should
be for one year only. The entire qual
ifying student body, which elects mem
bers at large, is not in a position to
know what men will be most valuable
in office. Sad enough, but true, popu
lar elections to Conference have been
swayed by elements of fame which are
well in their place, but which should
have no influence in shaping student
control. So if a mistake is made in
a general election to the Conference,
it is best to have the mistake remove
itself at the end of a year.
The remaining recommendation is
that the third system of election,
namely that of emergency representa
tives, should be continued. The men
who take office to fill unexpired terms
ought not serve after the end of the
original term. Such emergency elec
tions should meet only a temporary
purpose and the emergency represen
tative can establish his right to regu
lar re-election by good licks.
When the Conference has straight
ened out the quirk, we hope that all
of us in the departments, and in the
elections at large, will take a hand in
politics. Improve on the department
elections of last week, by making the
new officers really representative.

of us in the departments, and in the
elections at large, will take a hand in
politics. Improve on the department
elections of last week, by making the
new officers really representative.
There's no telling liow far back in
dim history the precedent lies. But
some time or other, somebody started
lis on a system of Conference elec
tions which chuckles at definite con
stitutional rules. None of us have
much license to snarl rabidly at any
one save ourselves, since the whole
community has been dozing. The il
legal process was discovered only
yesterday, by the studtnt adviser, who
likely was feeling mean and com
bative.
It's the easiest thing in the world
for us to put ourselves on the roll
call as progressives by saying that
the short term elections of common
custom are much better than the in
flexible two-year periods prescribed
fo.r all representatives chosen at reg
ular or special elections. Not only
that, but we can put up some pretty
good talking points. Best get the an
cient history out of the way first,
though, before we let the new era
dawn.
Representatives from various de
partments have been chosen on three
different bases, since a time which
likely antedates the present organi
zation'of student control. Each de
partment is entitled to one represen
tative for every forty male students
enrolled, election being based on the
votes of electors who have fifty hours
or more of university credit.
Depending on the number of Con
ference vacancies existing fo,r a given
department, a certain number of can
didates polling the heaviest vote In
in that department have been installed
for two-year terms. Others have been
putin office for shorter periods, to
till the unexpired terms of members
absent from the university, or unable
to ?.,'ve for other reasons. Repre
sentatives-at-large have invariably
been chosen at general election, for
the space of one year.
Xow we are ready for the joker.
The Conference constitution, adopted
in 1912, says: "Members of this Con
ference, elected at a general or spe
cial election, shall serve fo.r two
years."
Simply, election of a representa
tive to fill six months or a year of an
unexpired term, or election of a rep
resentative-at-large for a one-year
term is illegal.
Next Thursday evening, the mem
bers of the Conference who hold office
from last semester, —including those
who thought they were chosen for one
semester only, will meet. The twenty
men elected last Friday will be asked
to attend, but will have no voice in
settling the difficulty, since they are
members "de facto", not qualified to
have a voice. The voting members of
the Conference will unravel kinks
either by amending the constitution,

so that in future it will allow continu
ance of the customary procedure, or
they will decide to abide by the con
stitution, and enforce the two-year
term rule universally.
There is occasion now to make our
recommendation. We favor the sys
tem of elections which has been in
effect, and think that the constitution
should be amended accordingly. In
order to avoid perversion of the "ex
post facto" principle, any change
made cannot offect the present mem
bers of the Conference who should re
tain office according to the regulation.
They should remain active until their
terms expire. Further, the election of
some of the twenty men chosen last
Fridav should be cancelled.
Fortunately, comparatively few of
the men elected last year on the short
term theory have returned to college,
so a re-election according to the
amended constitution will probably re
instate most of the recent candidates
in the Conference.
Briefly, provision should be made
for election in the future, fo.r two
year terms, and for the completion of
unexpired terms, and for election of
members at large for periods of one
year. The two-year term for candi
dates receiving the heartiest support
in a given department, is advocated
because long service tends to good re
sults when the officers are capable.
The men most favored in a depart
ment election are likely to be good
men, else they would not be indorsed
by the men who work with them, and
know them. The "idol" influence,
which regrettably drags some of our
public offices into the mire, is not
dangerous.
Election of members at large should
be for one year only. The entire qual
ifying student body, which elects mem
bers at large, is not in a position to
know what men will be most valuable
in office. Sad enough, but true, popu
lar elections to Conference have been
swayed by elements of fame which are
well in their place, but which should
have no influence in shaping student
control. So if a mistake is made in
a general election to the Conference,
it is best to have the mistake remove
itself at the end of a year.
The remaining recommendation is
that the third system of election,
namely that of emergency representa
tives, should be continued. The men
who take office to fill unexpired terms
ought not serve after the end of the
original term. Such emergency elec
tions should meet only a temporary
purpose and the emergency represen
tative can establish his right to regu
lar re-election by good licks.

tions should meet only a temporary
purpose and the emergency represen
tative can establish his right to regu
lar re-election by good licks.
When the Conference has straight
ened out the quirk, we hope that all
of us in the departments, and in the
elections at large, will take a hand in
politics. Improve on the department
elections of last week, by making the
new officers really representative.
There's no telling liow far back in
dim history the precedent lies. But
some time or other, somebody started
lis on a system of Conference elec
tions which chuckles at definite con
stitutional rules. None of us have
much license to snarl rabidly at any
one save ourselves, since the whole
community has been dozing. The il
legal process was discovered only
yesterday, by the studtnt adviser, who
likely was feeling mean and com
bative.
It's the easiest thing in the world
for us to put ourselves on the roll
call as progressives by saying that
the short term elections of common
custom are much better than the in
flexible two-year periods prescribed
fo.r all representatives chosen at reg
ular or special elections. Not only
that, but we can put up some pretty
good talking points. Best get the an
cient history out of the way first,
though, before we let the new era
dawn.
Representatives from various de
partments have been chosen on three
different bases, since a time which
likely antedates the present organi
zation'of student control. Each de
partment is entitled to one represen
tative for every forty male students
enrolled, election being based on the
votes of electors who have fifty hours
or more of university credit.
Depending on the number of Con
ference vacancies existing fo,r a given
department, a certain number of can
didates polling the heaviest vote In
in that department have been installed
for two-year terms. Others have been
putin office for shorter periods, to
till the unexpired terms of members
absent from the university, or unable
to ?.,'ve for other reasons. Repre
sentatives-at-large have invariably
been chosen at general election, for
the space of one year.
Xow we are ready for the joker.
The Conference constitution, adopted
in 1912, says: "Members of this Con
ference, elected at a general or spe
cial election, shall serve fo.r two
years."
Simply, election of a representa
tive to fill six months or a year of an
unexpired term, or election of a rep
resentative-at-large for a one-year
term is illegal.
Next Thursday evening, the mem
bers of the Conference who hold office
from last semester, —including those
who thought they were chosen for one
semester only, will meet. The twenty
men elected last Friday will be asked
to attend, but will have no voice in
settling the difficulty, since they are
members "de facto", not qualified to
have a voice. The voting members of
the Conference will unravel kinks
either by amending the constitution,

so that in future it will allow continu
ance of the customary procedure, or
they will decide to abide by the con
stitution, and enforce the two-year
term rule universally.
There is occasion now to make our
recommendation. We favor the sys
tem of elections which has been in
effect, and think that the constitution
should be amended accordingly. In
order to avoid perversion of the "ex
post facto" principle, any change
made cannot offect the present mem
bers of the Conference who should re
tain office according to the regulation.
They should remain active until their
terms expire. Further, the election of
some of the twenty men chosen last
Fridav should be cancelled.
Fortunately, comparatively few of
the men elected last year on the short
term theory have returned to college,
so a re-election according to the
amended constitution will probably re
instate most of the recent candidates
in the Conference.
Briefly, provision should be made
for election in the future, fo.r two
year terms, and for the completion of
unexpired terms, and for election of
members at large for periods of one
year. The two-year term for candi
dates receiving the heartiest support
in a given department, is advocated
because long service tends to good re
sults when the officers are capable.
The men most favored in a depart
ment election are likely to be good
men, else they would not be indorsed
by the men who work with them, and
know them. The "idol" influence,
which regrettably drags some of our
public offices into the mire, is not
dangerous.
Election of members at large should
be for one year only. The entire qual
ifying student body, which elects mem
bers at large, is not in a position to
know what men will be most valuable
in office. Sad enough, but true, popu
lar elections to Conference have been
swayed by elements of fame which are
well in their place, but which should
have no influence in shaping student
control. So if a mistake is made in
a general election to the Conference,
it is best to have the mistake remove
itself at the end of a year.
The remaining recommendation is
that the third system of election,
namely that of emergency representa
tives, should be continued. The men
who take office to fill unexpired terms
ought not serve after the end of the
original term. Such emergency elec
tions should meet only a temporary
purpose and the emergency represen
tative can establish his right to regu
lar re-election by good licks.
When the Conference has straight
ened out the quirk, we hope that all
of us in the departments, and in the
elections at large, will take a hand in
politics. Improve on the department
elections of last week, by making the
new officers really representative.
