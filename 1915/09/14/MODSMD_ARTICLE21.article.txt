# Some Things Considered By a Former President
## 
### 
Mr. Taft beamed. That's all in the
day's work with him very likely, but
even at that, it served to put a few
more props under the floor, and made
the house quit rolling around during
the first seconds of introduction.
"You didn't tell me that dessert
would be served in two courses, Mrs.
Jordan," he chuckled. Then the
straight arm exercise was continued
with a degree of ambition that would
have made the proverbial old town
pump groan for more oil. It's a good
thing that the man at this end is a
wild-eyed Wilson enthusiast.
For Real Work.
The first question got a voluble rise.
"No, sir, I don't think we work the
students too hard. Make special note
of the 'we', since I'm a regular member
of the college family. I want to see
you fellows get long hours of work,
and lots of it, with no vacations at all
to speak of, —except for the pro
fessors."
Professor Taft made a wink that
went the rounds of the guests, pres
ent. And Mr. Woodward was there,
and heard it, too. "Now look here,"
balked the visitor, "haven't I said
enough already to fill The Daily Palo
Alto with my pet doctrines? Let me
talk about architecture, and your foot
ball turf, and so forth."
Full of Taft.
We admitted the paper would be full
of Taft by the time his picture had
been crowded in. lie seemed con
tent to talk some more, though, after
being reminded that descriptive Stan
ford pamphlets could lie bought cheap.
The comment veered to the compara
tive good or evil of college fraterni
ties. Mr. Taft is a member of Psi
Upsilon.
Favors Fraternities.
"I am heartily a friend of the col
lege fraternity as an institution.
Grant that regulation is needed in
some college communities, and still
you don't strike the foundation. The
association with men in a college fra
ternity house is one of the valuable
experiences of undergraduate life.
That the organizations stand for an
undemocratic principle is twaddle.
The .Musical Lnugli.
"You may not know it, Mr. Taft, but
that laugh of yours influenced even
the political opposition this morning
during the address. There was a good
deal of speculation about the various
musical scales it covers. It ought to
be worth money and votes, and the'
campus would like to know if there is
a history behind it."
"No history at all, except a good
digestion," laughed the professor, or
ex-president, however you want to re
gard the title. "I have always claimed
that a good digestion makes more
friends for a man than dozens of fra
ternal connections."

"You may not know it, Mr. Taft, but
that laugh of yours influenced even
the political opposition this morning
during the address. There was a good
deal of speculation about the various
musical scales it covers. It ought to
be worth money and votes, and the'
campus would like to know if there is
a history behind it."
"No history at all, except a good
digestion," laughed the professor, or
ex-president, however you want to re
gard the title. "I have always claimed
that a good digestion makes more
friends for a man than dozens of fra
ternal connections."
Mr. Taft beamed. That's all in the
day's work with him very likely, but
even at that, it served to put a few
more props under the floor, and made
the house quit rolling around during
the first seconds of introduction.
"You didn't tell me that dessert
would be served in two courses, Mrs.
Jordan," he chuckled. Then the
straight arm exercise was continued

For Real Work.

"No, sir, I don't think we work the
students too hard. Make special note
of the 'we', since I'm a regular member
of the college family. I want to see
you fellows get long hours of work,
and lots of it, with no vacations at all
to speak of, —except for the pro
fessors."
Professor Taft made a wink that
went the rounds of the guests, pres
ent. And Mr. Woodward was there,
and heard it, too. "Now look here,"
balked the visitor, "haven't I said
enough already to fill The Daily Palo
Alto with my pet doctrines? Let me
talk about architecture, and your foot
ball turf, and so forth."
Full of Taft.
We admitted the paper would be full
of Taft by the time his picture had
been crowded in. lie seemed con
tent to talk some more, though, after
being reminded that descriptive Stan
ford pamphlets could lie bought cheap.
The comment veered to the compara
tive good or evil of college fraterni
ties. Mr. Taft is a member of Psi
