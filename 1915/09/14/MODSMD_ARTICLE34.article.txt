Peter Flannigan, of Australia, who
is well known in rugby circles, was
an interested spectator at the game
Saturday. It will be .remembered that
Flannigan was an important member
of the aggregation of Australian Wal
labies who visited the Stanford cam
pus in 1909. He says that the im
provement of the American teams is
very marked; that the game is more
open than the game of five years ago,
but that the American players fail to
get rid of the ball fast enough. He
observed that the game is slowed by
the laxity of referees in calling fouls.
Flannigan is very much interested
in the outcome of our relations with
California.
