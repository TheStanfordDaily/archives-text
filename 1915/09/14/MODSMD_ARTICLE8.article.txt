# U.S. HOLDS KEY TO WORLD PEACE
## Colonial Policy Is Not Binding Today, Says Taft Government Should Take Steps Toward International Tribunal 
### 
Ex-President Taft in a jovial mood,
and with his most jovial smile, came
down from San Francisco today and
under the bluest of blue skies, stood
(in the football turf before f>,000 Stan
ford men, women, and triends seated
in the bleachers.
He took a quip at tlie presidential
chair, at our transbay rival, at jin
goism; praised the Cardinal crew, and
told us that Stanford was willing to
admit that she knew an earthquake
when she saw one. Then Professo.r
Taft proceeded to his subject of "Our

World Relationships", to show the
change in relations between the
United States and Europe since Wash
ington first propounded his doctrine
of freedom from all entangling alli
ances. Professor Taft proceeded to
show that today this country is prac
tically a n?ighbor of the European
powers, rather than a nation widely
separated by a darkness of miles. Ho

proceeded to show that Washington's
doctrine could not be justified today
as it was then: that danger besets
our paths and that the best measure
of safety was to take firm steps to
ward permanent peace.
Speaker Issues Warning.
There was a warning in Judge
Taft'a words to the effect that we are
much closer to this war than to any
war, except one in which we were
engaged.
"The interest of neutrals to prevent

war,' he declared, "is fast becoming a
right to prevent war â€”because of our
interests in the prevention we have a
right to be consulted." Chancellor
Jordan's own thoughts were brought
in when Judge Taft said that this war
destroys men and capital; destroys
the choicest men of the nations en
gaged. "The scrubs stay at home,"


William Howard Tuft
