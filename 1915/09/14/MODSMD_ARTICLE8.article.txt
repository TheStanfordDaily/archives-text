# U.S. HOLDS KEY TO WORLD PEACE
## Colonial Policy Is Not Binding Today, Says Taft Government Should Take Steps Toward International Tribunal 
### 
Ex-President Taft in a jovial mood,
and with his most jovial smile, came
down from San Francisco today and
under the bluest of blue skies, stood
(in the football turf before f>,000 Stan
ford men, women, and triends seated
in the bleachers.
He took a quip at tlie presidential
chair, at our transbay rival, at jin
goism; praised the Cardinal crew, and
told us that Stanford was willing to
admit that she knew an earthquake
when she saw one. Then Professo.r
Taft proceeded to his subject of "Our

World Relationships", to show the
change in relations between the
United States and Europe since Wash
ington first propounded his doctrine
of freedom from all entangling alli
ances. Professor Taft proceeded to
show that today this country is prac
tically a n?ighbor of the European
powers, rather than a nation widely
separated by a darkness of miles. Ho

proceeded to show that Washington's
doctrine could not be justified today
as it was then: that danger besets
our paths and that the best measure
of safety was to take firm steps to
ward permanent peace.
Speaker Issues Warning.
There was a warning in Judge
Taft'a words to the effect that we are
much closer to this war than to any
war, except one in which we were
engaged.
"The interest of neutrals to prevent

war,' he declared, "is fast becoming a
right to prevent war —because of our
interests in the prevention we have a
right to be consulted." Chancellor
Jordan's own thoughts were brought
in when Judge Taft said that this war
destroys men and capital; destroys
the choicest men of the nations en
gaged. "The scrubs stay at home,"


William Howard Tuft
lie said, "while the men who are
worthy, the men who make the na
tions' progress are gathered in the
trenches and sacrificed. Many of the
men who are left will turn to us."
j And there was a warning in Mr.
Taft's words that told his audience
that in spite of the would-be boomers,
the optimistic headlines, danger still
j lurks for the United States. "We
i must not overlook the fact that a part
| of our success has been due to the
savings of Europe," he declared.
| "They lent us capital with which to
' build up our railroads and manufac
turers. What are they doing in
Europe now? They are burning up
their capital and coming to us to bor
row. Our pre-eminence from the war
will not be a permanent one if it it
volves our having to furnish our own
capital, because our sources of supply
1 will be more than cut in half by this
war."
i
Human Nature No Excuse for War.
The defects of human nature are
! not excuses for war, Mr. Taft ex
• plained, and are not reasons for mak
! ing no efforts to prevent it. The con
j ditions of today, as compared with
l those of 100 years ago are so altered
as to justify a departure from Wash
ington's policy.
"I am going to propose a departure,"
Mr. Taft said, "and I shall justify it
on the grounds that conditions have
also changed in Europe. We are jus
tified in our own selfish interests in
so far as our national preservation is
concerned.
"My guess is that we will not get
through this war for two years—it is
a question of endurance, resources
and money. When nations have gone
to this extent they will stop at noth
ing short of common exhaustion.
They cannot go on pouring out blood
in the colossal way in which it is
being poured out in Europe today.
Only when both nations are in a state
of exhaustion may we have a just
peace."
At that time the United States can
go among the nations of Europe with
a treaty which can be made between
Europe, Asia and America. For after
the present, war. Professor Taft ex
plained, this country will be influen
tial rsgarding the treaties that are
to he made, and should take steps to
secure permanent peace.
Agreements Proposed.
Judge Taft put himself down as in
accord with the four proposals to
lessen the probability of war, made at
the Century Club in New York, at
which Dr. Jordan was present. In
the agreement proposed there were
four platforms: First, an interna
tional court to decide all questions
between nations that are parties to
the agreement. This court can sit on
a basis of international law and equi

ty secondly, there shall be a com
mission of conciliation, above the
court, which shall settle questions of
non-justiciable nature; thirdly, an
agreement between nations to defend
any member attacked by any nation
that did not first submit its grievance
to the commission; fourthly, to hold
international congresses which would
expand the nature and influence of in
ternational law.
A Slow Process.
"You can't take a long step and
make it safely," Mr. Taft said. "The
reforms in the world's history are
made step by step. And unless a man
can justify his proposal by history
he will find that what he recommends
will not stand." And Judge Taft went
back beyond our constitution to the
Magna Charta and Bill of Rights and
showed that his plan was in accord
with historical settlements of 11011-
judiciable questions. He drew a par
allel between the proposed plan and
the colonial step toward indepen
dence —and showed that in colonial
days disputes were settled by a court
made up from the several states.
I'pliolds California.
"We let all nations who pass cer
tain qualifications come into this
country. But we exclude the Jap
anese and Chinese. We have abso
lute right to do that —yet you can
see and understand that just such
non-judiciable questions can lead to
war. Therefore what we need is a
tribunal that will take care of these
non-judiciable questions." Professor
Taft cited instances illustrating the
success of arbitration, and said that
there are precedents enough to war
rant an attempt at a league of arbi
tration between nations of the world.
Hut Force Still Necessary.
"I don't think we have come to the
time when we can dispense with
force. It is only indispensible when
treaties have been broken. Treaties
[ have bound nations to great self-sac
rifices, —nations who have given or
pledged their all to honor their obli
gations. Why then may we not expect
them to do it now?"
That arbitration may possibly carry
us into entangling alliances, Judge
Taft admitted, but his arguments went
to show that the United States would
lie justified in giving up that which
has been a useful policy since the
days of Washington.

he will find that what he recommends
will not stand." And Judge Taft went
back beyond our constitution to the
Magna Charta and Bill of Rights and
showed that his plan was in accord
with historical settlements of 11011-
judiciable questions. He drew a par
allel between the proposed plan and
the colonial step toward indepen
dence —and showed that in colonial
days disputes were settled by a court
made up from the several states.

"We let all nations who pass cer
tain qualifications come into this
country. But we exclude the Jap

see and understand that just such
non-judiciable questions can lead to
war. Therefore what we need is a
tribunal that will take care of these
non-judiciable questions." Professor
Taft cited instances illustrating the
success of arbitration, and said that
there are precedents enough to war
rant an attempt at a league of arbi
tration between nations of the world.
Hut Force Still Necessary.
"I don't think we have come to the
time when we can dispense with
force. It is only indispensible when
treaties have been broken. Treaties
[ have bound nations to great self-sac
rifices, —nations who have given or
pledged their all to honor their obli
gations. Why then may we not expect
them to do it now?"
That arbitration may possibly carry
us into entangling alliances, Judge
Taft admitted, but his arguments went
to show that the United States would
lie justified in giving up that which
has been a useful policy since the
days of Washington.
Ex-President Taft in a jovial mood,
and with his most jovial smile, came
down from San Francisco today and
under the bluest of blue skies, stood
(in the football turf before f>,000 Stan
ford men, women, and triends seated
in the bleachers.
He took a quip at tlie presidential
chair, at our transbay rival, at jin
goism; praised the Cardinal crew, and
told us that Stanford was willing to
admit that she knew an earthquake
when she saw one. Then Professo.r
Taft proceeded to his subject of "Our

World Relationships", to show the
change in relations between the
United States and Europe since Wash
ington first propounded his doctrine
of freedom from all entangling alli
ances. Professor Taft proceeded to
show that today this country is prac
tically a n?ighbor of the European
powers, rather than a nation widely
separated by a darkness of miles. Ho

proceeded to show that Washington's
doctrine could not be justified today
as it was then: that danger besets
our paths and that the best measure
of safety was to take firm steps to
ward permanent peace.
Speaker Issues Warning.
There was a warning in Judge
Taft'a words to the effect that we are
much closer to this war than to any
war, except one in which we were
engaged.
"The interest of neutrals to prevent

war,' he declared, "is fast becoming a
right to prevent war —because of our
interests in the prevention we have a
right to be consulted." Chancellor
Jordan's own thoughts were brought
in when Judge Taft said that this war
destroys men and capital; destroys
the choicest men of the nations en
gaged. "The scrubs stay at home,"


William Howard Tuft
lie said, "while the men who are
worthy, the men who make the na
tions' progress are gathered in the
trenches and sacrificed. Many of the
men who are left will turn to us."
j And there was a warning in Mr.
Taft's words that told his audience
that in spite of the would-be boomers,
the optimistic headlines, danger still
j lurks for the United States. "We
i must not overlook the fact that a part
| of our success has been due to the
savings of Europe," he declared.
| "They lent us capital with which to
' build up our railroads and manufac
turers. What are they doing in
Europe now? They are burning up
their capital and coming to us to bor
row. Our pre-eminence from the war
will not be a permanent one if it it
volves our having to furnish our own
capital, because our sources of supply
1 will be more than cut in half by this
war."
i
Human Nature No Excuse for War.
The defects of human nature are
! not excuses for war, Mr. Taft ex
• plained, and are not reasons for mak
! ing no efforts to prevent it. The con
j ditions of today, as compared with
l those of 100 years ago are so altered
as to justify a departure from Wash
ington's policy.
"I am going to propose a departure,"
Mr. Taft said, "and I shall justify it
on the grounds that conditions have
also changed in Europe. We are jus
tified in our own selfish interests in
so far as our national preservation is
concerned.
"My guess is that we will not get
through this war for two years—it is
a question of endurance, resources
and money. When nations have gone
to this extent they will stop at noth
ing short of common exhaustion.
They cannot go on pouring out blood
in the colossal way in which it is
being poured out in Europe today.
Only when both nations are in a state
of exhaustion may we have a just
peace."
At that time the United States can
go among the nations of Europe with
a treaty which can be made between
Europe, Asia and America. For after
the present, war. Professor Taft ex
plained, this country will be influen
tial rsgarding the treaties that are
to he made, and should take steps to
secure permanent peace.
Agreements Proposed.
Judge Taft put himself down as in
accord with the four proposals to
lessen the probability of war, made at
the Century Club in New York, at
which Dr. Jordan was present. In
the agreement proposed there were
four platforms: First, an interna
tional court to decide all questions
between nations that are parties to
the agreement. This court can sit on
a basis of international law and equi

ty secondly, there shall be a com
mission of conciliation, above the
court, which shall settle questions of
non-justiciable nature; thirdly, an
agreement between nations to defend
any member attacked by any nation
that did not first submit its grievance
to the commission; fourthly, to hold
international congresses which would
expand the nature and influence of in
ternational law.
A Slow Process.
"You can't take a long step and
make it safely," Mr. Taft said. "The
reforms in the world's history are
made step by step. And unless a man
can justify his proposal by history
he will find that what he recommends
will not stand." And Judge Taft went
back beyond our constitution to the
Magna Charta and Bill of Rights and

They cannot go on pouring out blood
in the colossal way in which it is
being poured out in Europe today.
Only when both nations are in a state
of exhaustion may we have a just
peace."
At that time the United States can
go among the nations of Europe with
a treaty which can be made between
Europe, Asia and America. For after
the present, war. Professor Taft ex
plained, this country will be influen
tial rsgarding the treaties that are
to he made, and should take steps to
secure permanent peace.
Agreements Proposed.
Judge Taft put himself down as in
accord with the four proposals to
lessen the probability of war, made at
the Century Club in New York, at
which Dr. Jordan was present. In
the agreement proposed there were
four platforms: First, an interna
tional court to decide all questions
between nations that are parties to
the agreement. This court can sit on
a basis of international law and equi

ty secondly, there shall be a com
mission of conciliation, above the
court, which shall settle questions of
non-justiciable nature; thirdly, an
agreement between nations to defend
any member attacked by any nation
that did not first submit its grievance
to the commission; fourthly, to hold
international congresses which would
expand the nature and influence of in
ternational law.
A Slow Process.
"You can't take a long step and
make it safely," Mr. Taft said. "The
reforms in the world's history are
made step by step. And unless a man
can justify his proposal by history
he will find that what he recommends
will not stand." And Judge Taft went
back beyond our constitution to the
Magna Charta and Bill of Rights and
showed that his plan was in accord
with historical settlements of 11011-
judiciable questions. He drew a par
allel between the proposed plan and
the colonial step toward indepen
dence —and showed that in colonial
days disputes were settled by a court
made up from the several states.
I'pliolds California.
"We let all nations who pass cer
tain qualifications come into this
country. But we exclude the Jap
anese and Chinese. We have abso
lute right to do that —yet you can
see and understand that just such
non-judiciable questions can lead to
war. Therefore what we need is a
tribunal that will take care of these
non-judiciable questions." Professor
Taft cited instances illustrating the
success of arbitration, and said that
there are precedents enough to war
rant an attempt at a league of arbi
tration between nations of the world.
Hut Force Still Necessary.
"I don't think we have come to the
time when we can dispense with
force. It is only indispensible when
treaties have been broken. Treaties
[ have bound nations to great self-sac
rifices, —nations who have given or
pledged their all to honor their obli
gations. Why then may we not expect
them to do it now?"
That arbitration may possibly carry
us into entangling alliances, Judge
Taft admitted, but his arguments went
to show that the United States would
lie justified in giving up that which
has been a useful policy since the
days of Washington.
Ex-President Taft in a jovial mood,
and with his most jovial smile, came
down from San Francisco today and
under the bluest of blue skies, stood
(in the football turf before f>,000 Stan
ford men, women, and triends seated
in the bleachers.
He took a quip at tlie presidential
chair, at our transbay rival, at jin
goism; praised the Cardinal crew, and
told us that Stanford was willing to
admit that she knew an earthquake
when she saw one. Then Professo.r
Taft proceeded to his subject of "Our

World Relationships", to show the
change in relations between the
United States and Europe since Wash
ington first propounded his doctrine
of freedom from all entangling alli
ances. Professor Taft proceeded to
show that today this country is prac
tically a n?ighbor of the European
powers, rather than a nation widely
separated by a darkness of miles. Ho

proceeded to show that Washington's
doctrine could not be justified today
as it was then: that danger besets
our paths and that the best measure
of safety was to take firm steps to
ward permanent peace.
Speaker Issues Warning.
There was a warning in Judge
Taft'a words to the effect that we are
much closer to this war than to any
war, except one in which we were
engaged.
"The interest of neutrals to prevent

war,' he declared, "is fast becoming a
right to prevent war —because of our
interests in the prevention we have a
right to be consulted." Chancellor
Jordan's own thoughts were brought
in when Judge Taft said that this war
destroys men and capital; destroys
the choicest men of the nations en
gaged. "The scrubs stay at home,"


William Howard Tuft
lie said, "while the men who are
worthy, the men who make the na
tions' progress are gathered in the
trenches and sacrificed. Many of the
men who are left will turn to us."
j And there was a warning in Mr.
Taft's words that told his audience
that in spite of the would-be boomers,
the optimistic headlines, danger still
j lurks for the United States. "We
i must not overlook the fact that a part
| of our success has been due to the
savings of Europe," he declared.
| "They lent us capital with which to
' build up our railroads and manufac
turers. What are they doing in
Europe now? They are burning up
their capital and coming to us to bor
row. Our pre-eminence from the war
will not be a permanent one if it it
volves our having to furnish our own
capital, because our sources of supply
1 will be more than cut in half by this
war."
i
Human Nature No Excuse for War.
The defects of human nature are
! not excuses for war, Mr. Taft ex
• plained, and are not reasons for mak
! ing no efforts to prevent it. The con
j ditions of today, as compared with
l those of 100 years ago are so altered
as to justify a departure from Wash
ington's policy.
"I am going to propose a departure,"
Mr. Taft said, "and I shall justify it
on the grounds that conditions have
also changed in Europe. We are jus
tified in our own selfish interests in
so far as our national preservation is
concerned.
"My guess is that we will not get
through this war for two years—it is
a question of endurance, resources
and money. When nations have gone
to this extent they will stop at noth
ing short of common exhaustion.
They cannot go on pouring out blood
in the colossal way in which it is
being poured out in Europe today.
Only when both nations are in a state
of exhaustion may we have a just
