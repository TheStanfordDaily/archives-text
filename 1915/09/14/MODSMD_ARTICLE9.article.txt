# New Feminine Talent to Appear in "Stop Thief"
## 
### 
Three new names have been added
to the cast of "Stop Thief," thus filling
the gap that was left by the failure to
name three of the femenine parts in
the play when the cast was first an
nounced.
Miss Dorothy Metz, '17, has been
chosen to play the part of the viva
cious Caroline Carr, one of the sistc.rs
of the bride. Miss Metz has not yet
appeared in Stanfard dramatics, but
should be well suited to the part.
The role of th;Â» bride of the million
aire kleptomaniac has been put into
the hands of Miss Phyllis Auzerais, 'IS.
This will also lie Miss Auzerais's first,
appearance on the Assembly Hall
stage. Miss Edith Harvey, '11*. will fill
the part of Joan Carr. another sister
of th? bride.
All three of these parts have been
assigned to newcomers to the college
stage in orde.r to try to uncover some
new talent. This is in view of the

fact that the < ther two plays of the
semester will be very limited in their
scope, the sophomore comedy allowing
only members of the second year clas3
in its east, and the Ram's Head show
giving no opportunity for feminine
stars to shine.
"Stop Thief" is one of the most am
bitious attempts we have had to give
a play requiring a professionally
clever production. The situations re
quire experienced handling; the com
edy is not of the variety that is un
avoidably obvious, as is so often the
case in college dramatics.
Much of the success of the play will
depend upon the cleverness with
which the stake "business" is carried
off. Sword and Sandals, with the .rec
ord for a high standard in dramatics
which they have behind them, should
lie able to give a performance far
above the average level of the ama
teur farce.
