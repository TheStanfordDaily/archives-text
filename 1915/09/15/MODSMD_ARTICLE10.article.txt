# Subdivision Created
## Tracts on Stanford Campus Opened for Building Sites 
### 
A replica of the Southern California
real estate development system is now
being perpetrated on the Stanford
campus. The new section experienc
ing the invasion of sewer pi pes and
water mains lies in the open field op
posite thte intersection of Alvarado
and Santa Inez streets.
Stops which are now being taken
may be the beginning of a new move
ment which will result in the subdi
vision of available portions of the
Farm into typically surburban resi
dent districts. Every tactic of the
modern real estate shark has been
employed to entice the future Stan
ford resident of domestic tendene'es.
The dwelling now in progress of
erection upon the new tract will be
occupied by C. G. Allen of the Romanic
Languages department.
