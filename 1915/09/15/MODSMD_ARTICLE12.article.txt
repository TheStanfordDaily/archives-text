In his lecture to Stanford students
this afternoon on "Intellectual Rela
tions between Argentina and the
United States," Doctor Ernesto Nel
son, Professor in the University of
La Plata, and Education Commis
sioner, kept his audience in an ex
ceptionally good humor by his con
stant good-natured wit.
"Although our government is in a
large measure a copy of that of this
country," said Doctor Nelson, "for a
long time the idea of our people had
of Americans was gained through the
fact that we had no extradition treatv
with this country."
It was pointed out that Argentina
has the cleanest elections of any coun
try in South America. The Australian
system of election is used and voting
is compulsory.
The visitor called attention to the
fact that Argentina annually appropri
ates sixty million dollars, or two
fifths of the total national revenue, to
education. He spoke approvingly of
the movement of American educators
to provide exchange scholarships be
tween this country and the South
American countries, but said that ar
rangements would have to be made
with each southern country indi
vidually.
For readers of The Daily Palo Alto,
Doctor Nelson said: "University life
in Argentina follows closely the aca
demic life of Europe and the diver
sions of students of Amercan univer
sities are unknown in the southern
republic. For my own part, I have
long favored the social life of your
colleges."
