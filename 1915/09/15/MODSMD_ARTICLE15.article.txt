# FRESHMEN ANNEX FIRST RUGBY TANGLE WITH PALO ALTO
## SCORE SHOWS 10-4 VICTORY First Year Aggregation Is Too Husky for Opponents. Lots of Speed 
### 
Tradition was swept to the winds
this afternoon on the Stanford turf,
when the fast Palo Alto high school
rugby fifteen was forced to accept de
feat at the hands of the Stanford
freshmen. The final score read 10-4.
Every minute of the game especially
the second half, was marked by fast
and furious play on the part of both
teams. The heavy weight of the 1919
pack, however, was not to be with
stood.
First Half.
Following Angell's kick-off for Palo
Alto, play was brought back well in
the visitors' territory by a series of
dribbling rushes and short kicks to
touch on the part of the freshmen.
Ten minutes after the opening whistle
Palo Alto drew blood. Pratt, high
school fullback, dropped the pigskin
between the goal posts from the thirty
yard line in the midst of play. 'Nine
teen came right back a few minutes
later, when after advancing the ball to
the ten yard mark, Davis encircled
the scrum for a pretty try. Swartz
converted an easy goal. The remain
der of the half found Stanford well
out of danger.
Second Half.
Swartz kicked off for the freshmen.
The heavy weight of the first year
pack again proved a powerful factor
in the steady advance of 1919 toward
Palo Alto's line. Repeated attacks on
the visitors' goal were only thrown
back by a clever knowledge of rugby.
Finally Summerfleld scooped up on
the twenty yard mark, and from then
on the ball was transferred from for
ward to forward in a snappy rush un
til Swartz fell over for the second try.
Swartz converted. A minute later
Wagner got away for a zig-zag run of
thirty yards only to drop the ball
when across the line. Long boots by
Piatt gained yards for Palo Alto many
times. Just previous to the close of
the half Risling shot over the fresh
men's line, but was called back by
Feferee Fletcher. Final score, 10-4.
