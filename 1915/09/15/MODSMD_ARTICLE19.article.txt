# Higher Criticism

Some of us would rather wave a
red flag at the Trustees any day than
buy season tickets, or wreck that piano
over in the Union, or play around in
the Club House, and such frivilous
things. Which all goes to show that
if some of the campus people could
have a hand on the reins of business
management, Stanford would be a
regular place.
The Farm looked pretty good though,
when we all came back from vacation.
There were the new roadway, and any
number of Quad improvements, and
other tokens of renovation. That as
phalt-coated Inner Quad isn't as an
noying as it might have been, either.
It must be that the Trustees are in
fected with the Stanford Beautiful bug
T' esident Branner told us about last
week.
And by the way, house managers and
forth, are there any weeds, or trash
> les in your back yards?
