# Peninsular Association To Stage Five Concerts
## 
### 
The Peninsula Musical Association
in its fourth season has just completed
a program for the coming year which
is undoubtedly the best it has yet of
fered. Because of the hearty co-opera
tion that has been met with throughout
the entire Peninsula in the past, and
the numerous requests that have been
received this year, it is being arranged
to have five instead of the usual four
concerts.
On Thursday evening, October 7,
Fritz Kreisler, the great Hungarian
violinist whom people have Hocked to
hear and who has achieved a world
wide reputation, will play. Superla
tives cannot praise the ability and
power of Kreisler too highly. Espe
cially since this great violinist has
returned from the battlefront, where
he played, has he become desired
everywhere: Kreisler may be placed
among the best violinists in the world;
some pronounce him the best.
Tha other concerts are also well
worth hearing. Emilio de Gogorza, the
Spanish baritone, is booked for some
time in January. He is considered to
be the most artistic baritone of the
present day. In April the Franz
Kneizel String Quartette, composed of
two violins, a 'cello j.nd a viola, will
appear here. Every member of this
quartette has played in the Boston
Symphony Orchestra. The final con
cert of the year will be given in May
by Miss Florence Hinkle, if arrange
ments can be completed. Miss Hinkle
is an American mezzosoprano whom
critics consider to be one of the most
magnetic of opera singers. If the re
sponses for the fifth concert prove
numerous enough, an extra may be
secured and placed in November. Ne
gotiations are being carried on with
the San Francisco Symphony Orches
tra, which is now being under the di
rection of Dr. Herz, formerly director
of the Metropolitan Orchestra Com
pany of New York.
Tickets are being disposed of at
$2.50 for four concerts and these may
be had by sending a check or money
order for the amount above to Miss
