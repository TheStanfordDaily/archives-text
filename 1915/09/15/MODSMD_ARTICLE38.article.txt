# LONE POINT WINS FOR JUNIORS IN EXCITING CONTEST WITH SENIORS
## 1917 Forwards Outplay Opponents in Hardfought Game. Score Six to Five 
### 
In a fast and hard fought contest
yesterday afternoon, the junior rug
gers won the right to meet the sopho
mores in the finals of the interclass
championships by defeating the "senior
team G to 5. The game was featured
by excellent playing on the part of
the 1917 forwards, and clever passing
rushes initiated by the 1910 backfield.
For Ave minutes following West's
kick-off, the seniors rendered their op
ponents goal line a source of constant
attack. Thereafter, however, when the
1!)17 pack began working in earnest,
the ball was quickly brought back into
191G territory. Following a series of
effective dribbling rushes, Murray
carried the pigskin across for the first
try. West failed at a difficult conver
sion. When the half ended the play
was well in senior territory.
The policy of allowing the 1917 pack
to bear the brunt of the battle was
continued in the next period. Again
following dribbling rushes and short
kicks to touch, the ball was taken in
attacking distance of the 1916 line.
Here Scott picked up from the loose
and registered the juniors' second try,
which also went unconverted. Fre
quently during the play, the senior
liackfield would initiate dangerous
passing rushes, only to be tackled
when a score seemed imminent. Just
previous to the pistol shot, Erb re
ceived from halfback Phillips on the
twenty-five yard line and transferred
to Bacon for a pretty try. Erb con
verted an easy goal.
