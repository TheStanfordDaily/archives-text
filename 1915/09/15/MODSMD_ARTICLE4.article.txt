# Junior Sighs: "All Vaccinations Don't Look Alike to Me"
##

"There's nothing like being vacci
nated when you have to," mournfully
declared E. B. Thompson. Thompson
because of his association with the
arm-scratching performance is not
necessarily a freshman. He is a jun
ior transfer from the University of
Illinois. Nevertheless he has a tale
of woe to tell. It runs like this.
On registration day Dr. H. R. Stolz
asked the question for the 711 th time,
"Have you a certificate showing a suc
cessful vaccination within tl last
seven years?"
"I have not," replied E. B. I\, but
politely. "That is, not here. I'll
write for it at once."
"You have two weeks," said the
doctor, "otherwise we tax you two
dollars."
Two weeks of numerous expenses
made those dollars grow in Thomp
son's esteem; two weeks of no certifi
cate made those beads of perspiration
grow on Thompson's brow. So he
boldly submitted to scalpel and virus
(whatever they may be). Now he is
wearing felt and isinglass, covering an
awe-inspiring exhibition of a "taking"
vaccination.
But shades of glorious night! The
certificate came today!
"I don't mind being vaccinated on
the arm or on the limb," said Thomp
son, "but I don't fancy being vacci
nated on the pocketbook."
