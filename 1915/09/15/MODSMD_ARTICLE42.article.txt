That the Palo Alto Athletic Club
will not quit, as rumored, seems to be
indicated by the transferring last
night of the ownership of club rooms
and equipment from Manager Si Dav
idson, '17, to the members of the club,
themselves, who are drawing up a
constitution and going ahead with
plans to enter not only the rugby field,
but to organize teams in basketball
and other lines of sport. The club
will stage a vaudeville show and dance
in the near future to raise funds.
Davidson has been quoted as saying
the club had quit and that it might
play American instead of rugby, but
the action of the club last night would
seem to contradict this.
Oak Tree Removal.
Palo Alto's street oak trees and
their removal was again the subject
of argument at the last meeting of
the city council, when a petition to re
move an oak tree from the street at
the corner of Hteh street and Homer
avenue was introduced. Councilman
Frank Cramer argued that the council
had no right to remove trees, all con
trol of the streets being vested in the
board of public works.
Ends l'astorate.
The Rev. Carl M. Wagner, for six
years pastor of the Palo Alto Metho
dist church, closes his pastorate in
Palo Alto this week. He has many
friends among students attending
Stanford.
