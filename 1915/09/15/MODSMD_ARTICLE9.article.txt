# INTERCOLLEGIATE NOW HOLDS DEBATERS' ATTENTION
## EUPHRONIA MEETS TONIGHT Unusually Large Attendance Features Nestoria Meeting Last Night 
### 
Euphronia debating society will
meet this evening to discuss Federal
ownership of interstate railroads. M.
Crobaugh, '18, will uphold the affir
mative, while M. L. McClintock, 'IS,
will speak for the negative.
C. F. Cook, 'IG, and J. B. Hafer, '18,
representing the negative of the ques
tion: "Resolved, That the interstate
railways of the United States would
be more efficiently and economically
operated under Federal ownership
than under private ownership," were
awarded the decision over the affirma
tive team composed of I. D. Aten, '15,
and J. J. Taylor, '17, in Nestoria's first
debate of the year in the Law Building
last evening.
Preliminary to the main debate of
the evening several informal discus
sions of the following subjects were
held: "Resolved, That Stanford Uni
versity should adopt ex-President
Taft's peace proposals," and "Re
solved, That the faculty of Stanford
University acted wisely in dismissing
junior and senior engineering classes
in order that the upper-classmen
might have an opportunity to attend
the engineer's convention in San
Francisco.
An unusually large audience turned
out to hear the debate on the railway
transportation question, as it fur
nished the student body in general,
and those interested in debating par
ticularly, a good opportunity to obtain
information in regard to this year's
intercollegeiate question. Represen
tatives of all classes were present in
numbers. The freshmen delegation
was commendably large.
The judges for the discussion, who
were chosen at the meeting were F. E.
Wheeler, '15, J. C. Holland, '16, and
H. A. Fr.ve, '17.
