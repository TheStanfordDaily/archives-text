# STANFORD SENDS INVITATION TO CALIFORNIA
## Executive Committee Proposes Combined Exhibitions of Rival Games To Be Played With the Olympic Club Team On Two Consecutive Saturdays 
### 
In the course of a few weeks, the novel sight of witnessing Stanford
and California playing football on the same field, but with different op
ponents, may be granted the sport loving public. Today an invitation has
been extended the institution across the bay to stage in conjunction with
Stanford a combined exhibition of rugby and American football.
s. Executive Committee Acts
Last evening the executive committee brought matters to a h ad by
deciding to invite California to a combination program of rugby and
American football games to be played on the two consecutive Saturdays,
one date to be scheduled for the California field, the other for the Stan
ford turf, with the exposition grounds as an alternative in case of dis
pute. The suggested proposal calls for the following teams to be en
gaged in demonstration .play: The American football eleven of Olympic
club versus California; and the rugby fifteen of the Olympic club versus
Stanford. The Olympic club was deemed suitable for both universities
as a number of games are included in the athletic calendars of each insti
tution with the Winged "O" aggregation.
Two-fold Purpose of Gaines
The object of staging the two contests during a single afternoon on con
secutive Saturdays is to afford the public the two-fold and now impos
sible opportunity of judging the merits of the rugby and American foot
ball from the double standpoint of player and spectator. The Stanford
community is clearly aware of what great value such a system of games
would prove to both students and the general public, to whom otherwise
there is given no such opportunity for just comparison. Stanford further
holds that such a simultaneous meeting on common ground would empha
size the consistent willingness of the student body to subscribe to such
athletic contests as will promote tTie appreciation and knowledge of uni
versity sports which are now most in the public eye.
Proposal in Detail
Bearing these points in mind, the executive committee has worked out
a plan in detail for staging the demonstration contests fair to both Stan
ford and California. It Is proposed that one half or period of either type
of football be played, to be followed at once by the first half or period of
the rival type of football. Then in the same sequence, the remaining half
of the first type would be contested, and finally the last half of the sec
ond type of football.
This exhibition would be scheduled for the first Saturday cenvenient
to the schedules of both universities, the games to be staged either at the
California field or the Stanford turf. The program for the second Satur
day would be identical with the exception of reversed location. As would
be a matter of course, the question of gate receipts would be left to the
decision of the financial director of the Olympic club, and Graduate Man
agers Behrens and Stroud. In case any of the details of the proposed field
day are regarded unfavorably by California, Stanford would welcome any
equitable changes.

Two-fold Purpose of Gaines
The object of staging the two contests during a single afternoon on con
secutive Saturdays is to afford the public the two-fold and now impos
sible opportunity of judging the merits of the rugby and American foot
ball from the double standpoint of player and spectator. The Stanford
community is clearly aware of what great value such a system of games
would prove to both students and the general public, to whom otherwise
there is given no such opportunity for just comparison. Stanford further
holds that such a simultaneous meeting on common ground would empha
size the consistent willingness of the student body to subscribe to such
athletic contests as will promote tTie appreciation and knowledge of uni
versity sports which are now most in the public eye.
Proposal in Detail
Bearing these points in mind, the executive committee has worked out
a plan in detail for staging the demonstration contests fair to both Stan
ford and California. It Is proposed that one half or period of either type
of football be played, to be followed at once by the first half or period of
the rival type of football. Then in the same sequence, the remaining half
of the first type would be contested, and finally the last half of the sec
ond type of football.
This exhibition would be scheduled for the first Saturday cenvenient
to the schedules of both universities, the games to be staged either at the
California field or the Stanford turf. The program for the second Satur
day would be identical with the exception of reversed location. As would
be a matter of course, the question of gate receipts would be left to the
decision of the financial director of the Olympic club, and Graduate Man
agers Behrens and Stroud. In case any of the details of the proposed field
day are regarded unfavorably by California, Stanford would welcome any
equitable changes.
