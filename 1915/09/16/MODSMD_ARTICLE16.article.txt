This job doesn't very often allow a
crack at the same thing more than
once in a week, because people would
think you were trying to start an up
ward and onward movement. Talk
ing about the evil of lackadaisical
elections, though, the junior class bal
lot is whiter today than it was yes
terday.
Coming down to facts, the '17 class
isn't the only organization within
hailing distance that doesn't know its
officers by sight before they are
elected, but it can serve as the horri
ble example without any malice being
intended. Since the presidency is
finally, after some wig-wagging, left
without any claimant, the juniors will
try it all over again Monday. We hope
the betting will be heavy.
