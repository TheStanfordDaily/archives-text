# Beware of Cupid, Says Professor Martin; Here's Recipe If You're In Love
## "Love-sick Are Weaklings: Campus No Place for Such People" 
### 
Are you falling in love?
If so, read this.
This is no place to fall in
love; so says Professor Lillien
.1. Martin of the Psychology de
partment.
"It's weakening to fall in
love." says Miss Martin, and
weaklings are not wanted at
Stanford.
However, just because Stan
ford is a romantic place, and
just because better men and
women than most of us have
fallen in love while here, we do
not have to be victims of Cupid.
If we follow the directions
laid down by Professor Martin
it's a tolerably safe bet that we'll
come through the year with a
free heart and hand. Here is
Professor Martin's recipe:
"Cut out social events, if you
have any tendency to fall in
love."
"If you are affected by any
certain location, cut out that
part of the Quad."
"Stay away from that thing
which excites your love, what
ever it may be."
If you heed these rules,
you're pretty safe, but if you
don't, look out. That's Miss
Martin's advice.
