# JOURNALIST TELLS VALUE OF BOOKKEEPING OK NEWS
## 
### 
Emphasizing the value of "book
keeping of public news," Arthur I.
Street, editor of "Street's Pandex of
the News," described his method of
cataloguing daily news for reference
in studying the shaping of public sen
timent, the progress of legislation and
other movements, in an address in
room 202, English Building, at 4:30
this afternoon.
Street pointed out the parallel that
should exist between the bookkeeping
of public news and that of public influ
ence. The daily newspapers of the
country correspond to the day journal
of bookkeeping, but there is nothing
lo serve as a ledger of posted news.
In the morning Street explained ills
system for the classification of news
to Assistant Professor E. W. Smith's
class in news analysis. Earlier this
afternoon he talked to Professor A.
li. Show's class for prospective high
school teachers on the value of such
a system to high school students of
history.
