# CHAPPIE CELEBRATES
## Special Edition to be Issued on Sixteenth Birthday 
### 
The next issue of the Chaparral,
which will make appearance 011
October 5, will be the "Sixteenth An
niversary Number." Even Chappie
lias decided that a birthday must come
every so often, and this being the case
the staff has decided to make the most
of the occasion. The art work for the
coming number will be of an exceed
ingly high order. A number of new
men are trying out for the art staff
and as a result the competition is
keen. Despite the fact that the issue
will be a birthday number, the editors
will use the cover page for a clever
drawing symbolic of the Pan-hellenic
rushing season.
Editor Levy states that there Is op
portunity for additional men to make
places on the staff. Levy may be
reached through box number 1357, or
may be interviewed in regard to the
nature of work desired in room 30,
Encina.
