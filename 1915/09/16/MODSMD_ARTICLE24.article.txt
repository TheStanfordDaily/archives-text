# Glee Club Reorganized
## Director Eaton Will Choose Members on Merit Hereafter 
### 
A revolutionary change in the choos
ing of members and of retaining mem
bership in the Glee Club was inaugu
rated last night when that organiza
tion voted to vest all such power in
the hands of Professor L. H. Eaton,
the director. Professor Eaton is de
termined to develop a better club than
ever before, from the best material
that has ever answered the call to
tryouts. In addition to this he an
nounces to all vocally inclined in the
university that for the next few days
tryouts are again thrown open. For
appointments with him call J. S. Hig
ley, '17, the manager.
The new director intends to "dis
cover"' or choose new members at any
time talent is found and to oust any
old member who does not qualify or
who does not work. In this way there
is to be developed a club of talented
workers even if there are found to be
only eight in the institution who
qualify.
The first meeting was most snappy
and the rehearsal was a harmonious
one in spite of the fact that the music
was absolutely new and several of the
members were freshmen.
C. Joyce, '16, was elected president
to fill the place of K. B. Uhls, '16, who
failed to return to college.
