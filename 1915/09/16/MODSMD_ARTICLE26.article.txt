# Must Choose Another President
## 
### 
On account of the withdrawal of
nominations of E. R. Heal and A. H.
VlcEuen as candidates for the office
of presidency of the junior class,
President McCullock has called for a
meeting Monday afternoon at t: 10 in
room 214. The consensus of opinion
of the class as expressed last Friday
was to the effect that nominations for
officers was to close with Wednesday's
Issue of The Daily Palo Alto, hence
the late resignations of Peal and Mc-
Euen render another meeting neces
sary.
