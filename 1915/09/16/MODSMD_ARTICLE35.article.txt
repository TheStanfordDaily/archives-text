### 
According to a bulletin issued by
the United States Public Health Ser
vice, the victories which medical sci
ence has won over disease have in
very few instances, if evsr, been de
c ded by a lucky chance. It argues
that only by utilizing the accumulated
krowlcdge of centuries and all the
information available from his con
temporaries, has the investigator been
enabled to make significant discov
eries leading to the cure or prevention
of disease.
