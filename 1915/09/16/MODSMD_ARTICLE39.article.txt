# FIGURES TELL STORY OF CREW'S FIGHT TO MAKE BOTH ENDS MEET
## Alumni and Hearst Contributions Godsends in Time of Need. Small Deficit Exists 
### 
Stanford's champion crew went back
to Poughkeepsie, gave the eastern in
vincibles a husky western scare; found
themselves on the verge of a financial
whitewash after available funds had
given out; settled a few bills by dig
ging deep into personal coffers; then
were ready for home "broke."
The nation's press more or less ac
curately had a great deal to say about
the poverty stricken Cardinal crew.
There is no need of hiding the fact
that poverty stricken is an applicable
term. The Daily Palo Alto will pub
lish in the near future an itemized
statement of the resources and expen
diture a of the crew fund, which totaled
over $3,300. The events that led to
and followed the financial crisis,
briefly follow.
Over $2,0(10 Received.
The total amount of money received
prior to the eastern journey was
$2,388.25. After paying transporta
tion to Poughkeepsie, and a share of
post-season training expenses, there
remained in the manager's bank book
credit to the sum of $528.55. The one
item of transportation, including berth,
meals, tips, fare, and so forth, reached
the total of $2,086.85. Out of the sur
plus came $187.70, expressage for the
shell from Redwood to Highlands,
New York.
N T . V. Alumni Offering Is Aid.
A contribution from New York
alumni of $105.50 buoyed up the fast
sinking fund, which promised to go
down for the third and last time upon
the payment of bills for board, laun
dry and launch hire. Twenty dollars
from Arthur Shutts, '09, a visitor at
the regatta, /and an additional $14
from New York graduates failed to
save the ship, and personal loans from
ths members of the crew and coach
were necessary.
An Empty Pocketbook.
On June 29, the day after the race,
with many Palo Alto bills still un
paid, the money on hand had been
completely offset by expenditures.
However, an involuntary S. O. S. had
gone the rounds of the national press,
and $300 came across the wires from
the San Francisco alumni. The day
following, the same amount was re
ceived from Mr. William Randolph
Hearst. This latter contribution, un
solicited, was an offering from the
gods. Out of this $600 the personal
loans of crew and coach were repaid,
and sums sufficient for berths and
meals home. Transportation had been
taken cars of by round-trip tickets.
The balance served to settle accounts
with Palo Alto merchants, after which
there remained $4.10. A contribution
of $10 made possible the paying of a
milk bill. There still remains $67.70
in unpaid accounts. Fifty-one dollars
of this is due the Hotel Cumberland,
N'ew York, which housed the crew at
the expense of the "Alumnus." Due
to a misunderstanding, however, the
'Alumnus" fund did not cover the bill.
The other debt is owed a local laundry.
