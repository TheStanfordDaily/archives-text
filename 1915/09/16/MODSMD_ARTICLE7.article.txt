# RUGBY AND AMERICAN FOOTBALL DAY PLANNED
## Student Conference Will Meet Tonight to Decide Membership and Constitutional Questions 
### 
At 7:30 in the Union this evening
will gather members of the Conference
who have been elected within the last
two years. All except recently
voted upon will have seats, the latter
being allowed only to listen.
The first opportunity to be brought
up concerns the constitution and Is
the most unique of its kind since the
inauguration of student government
at Stanford. The conference consti
tution reads that all general and
special elections shall be for two
years. This is the only clause con
cerning the matter iu point.
Elections to fill vacancies are un
derstood to be special elections and
members at large are elected at gen
eral elections. But here is where the
trouble comes in. Someone in times
past decided to hold elections to fill
vacancies for the "unexpired term,"
and to elect members at large for one
year only. Since then the constitution
has gone into hiding and this prece
dent ruled until the discovery of the
error after the recent elections.
Although in numbers they may con
stitute a quorum, last year's members,
not yet constituting a truly represen
tative body because of the legality of
the recent election and the constitu
tional right of some members so
elected to seats, will, in order not to
transgress its rights and thereby act
unconstitutionally, first decide, on the
basis of the existing constitution, the
right to seats and the length of office
of each claimant separately. Then,
with each seat legally filled and being
a body representing every man in the
university, the Conference will prob
ably decide whether the constitution
shall stand as it is or be amended to
be more in keeping with the prevalent
custom.
