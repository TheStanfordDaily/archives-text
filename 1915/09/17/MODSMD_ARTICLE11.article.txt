# STANFORD PROPOSITION UNFAIR TO U. C. SAYS STROUD
## COMMENTS ARE INTERESTING San Francisco Press is Strongly in Favor of the Double Exhibition 
### 
Although no official action has as
yet been taken by the Executive Com
mittee of the University of California
in regard to the proposed combined
exhibition of rugby and American
football, the sidelights which are given
by the unofficial statements of Gradu
ate Manager Stroud in the San Fran
cisco press indicates clearly the prob
able outcome of Stanford's proposal.
Douglas Erskine of the San Fran
cisco Examiner comments favorably
on the plan. He declares that the ex
hibition would be educational in that
it would lead to an understanding of
the two types of games but at the
same time he expresses doubt that
California will comply with the sug
gestion. The San Francisco Chronicle
describes the situation rather humor
ously by declaring that the "huskies"
at the University of California are as
anxious to accept the proposal "as a
kitten is to venture into a house full
of bloodhounds."
"Unfair,'' Sitys Stroud.
The following is the statement
which was given out by Graduate
Manager Stroud of the University of
California upon hearing of the pro
posed plan:
"It would be unfair,'' said Stroud,
"to ask us to give an exhibition of the
American game at the present time.
Our men have only recently taken up
the game. This year, and probably
for two or three years to coma, we
will look like novices, and it does not
look possible for us to give as good
a demonstration of the American game
as Stanford might be expected to give
of rugby. The Cardinal players have
all played the game for years. Our
men are just learning the American
game. How could we possibly hope
to make as good a demonstration?
hi Berkeley's Back Yard.
"If the public wants to see what
the American game is like they can
visit 11s at Berkeley, where we will be
playing every Saturday and sometimes
on mid-week days. Our boys will play
the best they can in these games and
if they do not bring out all the best
points of the American game it will
be for the reason that they have not
had time to master all the fine points
"But in regard to the Stanford idea
of playing the two styles on one field
011 the same day, nothing could be
gained by that. The rupture between
California and Stanford was caused
by the failure of the student bodies to
agree 011 a freshman rule. Stanford
insists that first year men shall be
eligible for varsity contests. We
claim that they be barred from var
sity competition. If that, matter was
settled it might be worth while for
the two universities to consider which
is the better game—rugby or inter
collegiate."

"Unfair,'' Sitys Stroud.
The following is the statement
which was given out by Graduate
Manager Stroud of the University of
California upon hearing of the pro
posed plan:
"It would be unfair,'' said Stroud,
"to ask us to give an exhibition of the
American game at the present time.
Our men have only recently taken up
the game. This year, and probably
for two or three years to coma, we
will look like novices, and it does not
look possible for us to give as good
a demonstration of the American game
as Stanford might be expected to give
of rugby. The Cardinal players have
all played the game for years. Our
men are just learning the American
game. How could we possibly hope
to make as good a demonstration?
hi Berkeley's Back Yard.
"If the public wants to see what
the American game is like they can
visit 11s at Berkeley, where we will be
playing every Saturday and sometimes
on mid-week days. Our boys will play
the best they can in these games and
if they do not bring out all the best
points of the American game it will
be for the reason that they have not
had time to master all the fine points
"But in regard to the Stanford idea
of playing the two styles on one field
011 the same day, nothing could be
gained by that. The rupture between
California and Stanford was caused
by the failure of the student bodies to
agree 011 a freshman rule. Stanford
insists that first year men shall be
eligible for varsity contests. We
claim that they be barred from var
sity competition. If that, matter was
settled it might be worth while for
the two universities to consider which
is the better game—rugby or inter
collegiate."
