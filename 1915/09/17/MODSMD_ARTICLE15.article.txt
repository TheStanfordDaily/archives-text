We can cuddle a last, lingering hope
that the executive committee of the
University of California will accept
Stanford's proposal for comparative
exhibitions of rugby and American
football. Supposedly the executive
body is blessed with an ability to act
in accord with student opinion. It
is an expression of California opinion,
shorn of Schaefferism, that is needed.
Following projection of the Stan
ford-California-Olympic Club program,
hostility has been sprinkled in the
psalm songs of Graduate Manager
Stroud, a satellite of that grand old
man of Blue and Gold athletic history.
Whether the reply of California on
Wednesday will be a mirror for 1 their
grimaces or not, is our present
concern.
No other means than the one pro
posed by Stanford could give the mem
bers of both institutions so convinc
ing a way to judge the merits of the
games which threaten to destroy a
traditional rivalry. That the Berkeley
huskies have not had time to prepare
a good performance of the old game
doesn't carry much weight. The game
furnished by California and the Olym
pic Club squads should be well enough
matched, and well enough coached to
offer a good basis for judgment.
Optimists on the neighboring cam
pus have told the world from time to
time about "so and so, an old game
star," lining up with the squad for
practice. How many men are there
on the Blue and Gold string who
weren't brought up on American foot
ball? After a month or two of drill
in the new wrinkles it would be sad
if the Californians couldn't put up an
acceptable game.
On August 25, The Daily Californian
quoted Wayne Sutton, assistant coach
at Washington, with much approval,
as follows:
"You have a month's start of us
for practice. The advantage of the
much talked of football instinct,
which comes only in two or three
years, is not as great as claimed.
A month of hard practice is a coun
ter advantage that is almost as
great."
We aren't quoting in a tone of de
rision of the speaker, or of The Daily
Californian, which indorsed his re
marks. Matter of fact, we agree with
them, and so does The Daily Cali
fornian, and the Berkeley fans, and
Messrs. Jimrnie and Johnnie, and all
the rest. The chances are, they have
enlarged upon that very idea at some
of the rallies, and gained wild ap
plause.
Stroud has got busy, and rung in
the freshman exclusion drivle again,
as the cause of the present breach.
That's the "inarbitrable principle,"
but we have had doves roosting on it
for months, in hope they might hatcTf
something.
