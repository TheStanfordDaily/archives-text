The rising curtain reveals a campus
clustered around a towering Campa
nile. A student and an athlete are
standing, entraged in argument* ru
der a tree reposes fat and jovial Mirth.
Student —Seen what Stanford has
come through with?
Athlete—You mean the reciprocity
game proposition?
Stude. —Yeh. What do you think
of it?
Ath. —1 christened that a dilemma
soon's I saw it. You know what di
lemma is, don't you?
Stude. —Something you get into and
can't get out of.
Ath. —No; you're thinking of a coun
ty fair.
Stude. —What's a dilemma, then?
Ath. —Well, it's a—it's what we're
in. You see, bo, if we accept Stan
ford's proposal we're showing willing
ness to harbor a Cardinal suggestion.
If we turn 'em down, we're showing
yellow, cold feet, and the white flag.
Stude.—What are we going to do
about it?
Ath. —Same thing we did this sum
mer. Stick our noses high in the air.
Stude. —Follow Campanile's 'exam
ple, eh?
As the two men exit, Mirth arises,
and compressing his sides tightly,
gives vent to: Ha! Ha! Ha! A di
lemma. Haw! I'm going to move
away. Too many human campaniles
sticking up and breathing in all the
pure air. Dilemma! Ha!
