# Twenty-seven Freshmen Join Debating Society. Plan to Meet Weekly
## 
### 
"Responsibility for carrying on
Stanford's debating contests is more
and more devolving upon the under
classmen because the studies in the
last college year are in many cases
too heavy to permit the seniors to
give the time necessary for debate
preparation," said F. E. Hill, '11, in
structor in the English department, in
speaking to the newly organized fresh
man debating society last night.
Same Values.
Mr. Hill explained in some detail
the advantages to be gained from par
ticipation in debates. Under the title,
"What will debating do for you?" the
speaker called attention to the fact
that debating developes the self ex
pression; presents an opportunity for
coming in contact with other minds;
and developes executive ability. Mr.
Hill, himself a former Stanford de
bater, told of the benefits gained by
himself in taking advantage of the op
portunities offered debaters, and stated
that the time spent in preparation had
paid well.
Three Classes.
Mr. Hill divided the colleges student
body into three classes: the "peas
ants,'' who come here only to learn
better ways of earning a living; the
"artisans,' who come in the hope of
becoming experts in some one profes
sion, but who do not concern them
selves about others and others' prob
lems; and the "leaders," who while
they come with a more or loss selfish
intention, also have an interest in so
ciety and social problems
Upon the conclusion of Mr. Hill's
address the freshmen elected their
permanent oflicers. \V. C. Fumlcn
berg. who was chosen temporary
chairman at last week's meeting, was
plected president, whil II. II. Heth
and J. H. Waldo were chosen for vice
president and secretary, respectively.
