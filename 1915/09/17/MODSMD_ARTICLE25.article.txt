The dangers of vocational training
l)id for much discussion. Mrs. Ella
Flagg Young, who is at the head of
Chicago's educational system says:
"The great menace of vocational train
ing is that it might be used to confine
the poor to an industrial education."
The San Francisco Chronicle furthers
this opinion. "Vocational training
tends to confine the child of poor par
ents to the trades, even though he may
have the natural qualifications for a
business or a professional career. To
be sure, there are far too many crowd
ing into the polite professions, but
it should not be for the authorities to
say who shall or who shall not be con
fined to manual labor, or what particu
lar trades should be taken up by par
ticular children.
"It is in this sense that vocational
training is undemocratic. In European
countries more accustomed to gov
ernmental regulation parents very
readily accept the idea of having their
children drafted into the various call
ings, but such a custom is repugnant
to democratic and therefore individu
alistic America."
