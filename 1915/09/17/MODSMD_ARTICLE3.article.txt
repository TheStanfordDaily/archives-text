## 
### 
Great enthusiasm, despite a scanty
attendance, was shown at the meeting
of Stanford women interested in de
hating last evening. Another meet
ing will be held next Thursday at 8
p. m.in room 227 of the History
building.
At that time it is hoped that a
women's debating society will be defi
nitely formed, this being impossible
last night, since many women who ex
pected to attend were unable to be
present. Each woman present last
night plans to bring several friends
to the next meeting and in this way
start the ball rolling for ever-increas
ing attendance.
Associate Professor L. E. Bassett,
and Miss Elizabeth L. Buckingham of
the English department faculty, and
K. E. Leib, '15, chairman of the inter
collegiate debating committee, spoke
to last night's gathering on the value
of a woman's debating society and the
hopeful prospects for such an organi
zation at Stanford. That women were
just as eligible as men to try out for
the intercollegiate debating teams was
the source of considerable comment.
