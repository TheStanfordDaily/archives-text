Vsirsiiy Personnel <'hanged.
Coach Brown in announcing the per
sonnel of the var-ity, presents a scwne
v hat changed line-up from that used
]::f-t week in the clash with the Olyin
pic Club. It is also interesting to note
the number of new varsity substitutes
that have come to the front as a re
sult of the interclass contests.
Bloeser, Knight, and Rehm are
slated to lead the pack at front rank,
Sample and Bihlman substituting.
Middle rank for Fisher and
Pettingill, with Coleman relieving.
The original trio, Halsted, lock, and
Wylie and Braden, breakaways, form
the rear rank. Murray and Chandler
; are tw*o new faces serving in the ca-
I pacity of substitutes.
Walker and Erb Interchanged.
i Some decided switching is evident
] in the back field combination booked
ito score against the Barbarians.
! Walker and Erb have interchanged
positions, the former playing first five
j eighths, and the latter half. Bacon,
I Carroll, Urban, and Dievendorff corn
! plete the attacking line in the order
named. Templeton, who has mastered
the faculty of kicking fifty yards with
j case, will hold down his first position
:on the varsity at fullback. .Teffcrs and
Wallace are the lone extra men in the
back field.
The line-up of the freshmen differs
only slightly from that used against
! Palo Alto Wednesday afternoon.
Bacon moves into front rank as a reg
ular for the first time, while Boul
ware returns to breakaway. First fivo>-
eighths is to be left in the hands of
: Slade. Two former side-line candi
dates, Morris and Wagner, are booked
for wing positions.
! Want Referee Mullineaux.
An effort is being made to secure
! referee Mullineaux to officiate during
j the afternoon matches. Halves in the
j freshmen game will be twenty-five
minutes each, while the varsity is
carded to play a thirty minute second
period. Twenty minutes will be the
order of events for the halves in the
