# SOCCER DOUBTFUL WITH CALIFORNIA
## State University Will Not Play If Freshmen Are Used. Schedule Announced 
### 
A soccer match between Stanford
and tlie University of California seems
extremely improbable following the
action by the representatives of the
two universities at an important meet
ing of the new University and Club
Soccer League in San Francisco last
night.
In accordance with the instructions
of the executive committee to arrange
soccer games with California with
provision for freshman competition,
Stanford's representatives, J. L. Rey
nolds. '15, and VV. 15. Ulodget, '15, re
served the right to play freshmen on
the Cardinal team. The University
at' California, represented by Graduate
Manager Stroud, Jimmie Schaefer, and
Soccer Captain Shafer, reserved the
right to call the game a bye, that is to
refuse to play it, if Stanford used
freshmen. If Stanford barred fresh
men, which according to the execu
tive committee ruling can not be done,
California would be willing to play.
Santa Clara University sent word
that it would not enter the league un
til next semester as all interest cen
ters around rugby football this semes
ter at the Catholic college. Father
White, Santa Clara's athletic mode
rator, is reported to have said that
Santa Clara is enthusiastic to take up
soccer as soon as the rugby season is
over. Coaches will l>e furnished by
the league to train the missionites in
the rudiments of the game, having
never played soccer before.
Stanford plays six games according
to the league schedule as announced
for the first semester. This does not
include two dates, November 20 and
27, reserved for games with Cali
fornia, should these be arranged sat
isfactorily.
Other opponents will be the Olym
pic Club, the "Cardinals," a team
made up of reserve players of the Cal
ifornia Association Sunday League,
and the University All-Stars, Stanford
and California's second team players.
Stanford will furnish the back field
and California the forwards for their
first game, October 2, and this system
will be alternated in the remaining
games.
