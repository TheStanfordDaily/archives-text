The old football fever intermingled
with recollections of last season's irre
sistible rugby machine came to its
own last Saturday while the varsity
was putting to complete rout the black
jerseyed fifteen of the Barbarian Club.
The freshmen added their mite to the
day by sending the Alameda high
school team home with the bitter taste
of non-victory. Despite the fact that
the All-Blacks emerged on the short
end of the score in their clash with
the Palo Alto Athletic Club, their ex
hibition of gameness overshadowed
defeat. In short, just about everyone
011 the well-filled bleachers returned
home with a satisfied smile.
Hut before issuing any rash state
ments to the effect that Santa Clara
now should sit up and take notice, the
Cardinal supporter must bear in mind
the fact that the opposition offered the
varsity by the Barbarians, was far
from all that could be desired. Yet
one cannot deny that the improvement
shown served as a strong tonic to pes
simistic minds. Erb is still masier in
his position at half, while the remain
ing back field litie. omitting none, per
formed in creditable style. Templeton
was at the top of his game at fullback.
Another find was discovered in th"e
person of Chandler, who occupied Wy-
lie's regular place.
Stanford started with a rush, drib
bling to the fifteen yard line. Here
Urban dodged his way across after
receiving from a line out. Templeton
failed. A minute later Braden picked
from the loose and registered. Temple
ton converted. At this point a fifty
yard passing rush initiated by Austin,
going from Lachmund to Morris to
Reeves to Piercy, resulted in a score
by the latter. The goal kick was
missed. The remaining five minutes
of the half were profitable for Stan
ford, Chandler, Urban and Carroll all
making tries which went unconverted.
Austin's football skill again was re
sponsible for a score in the opening
of the second period. After intercept
ing a pass to Walker and running
thirty-five yards, he transferred to
Lachmund, who passed to Darsie for
a try. From this point on, however,
the Barbarian forwards proved of lit
tle strength. Braden crossed the line
twice, and Pettingill and Urban each
once before the contest was over.
Final score, 31 to 6.
Fresh men Annex.
The first half of 'nineteen's bout
with Alameda proved rather listless
and uninteresting. The chief play of
note was a forty-yard drop between
the goal posts by Smith of the visiting
team, following the award of a free
kick. The second half gave evidence
of life. After a long dribbling rush
half way down the field, Caugliey
scooped from the loose and fell over
the line for the freshmen. Boulware
missed conversion. Later a perfect
passing rush from Davis, Stevens,
Boydston and Long to Morris allowed
the latter to score. Conversion failed.
Final count, 6 to 3.
Lightning Play.
Speed and rugby skill featured the
Palo Alto Athletic Club's S to G vic
tory over the All-1 Hacks. During
every second of the game the ball shot
in lightning fashion up and down the
field. Single's try in the first half
gave Stanford a winning send-off. The
next period, however, showed scores
by Card and Wood for the visitors,
one conversion bringing their tally
to eight.
College ol' Pacific's football fifteen
scored an early morning victory over
the Stanford Greys on the turf Satur
day. The Greys put up a fairly good
brand of rugby but were not equal to
the charges of the Pacific players.
At the end of the first half, the Greys
were conceded a bare chance to wfn
though they held the short zero end
of an 8 to 0 score. However, dribbling
rushes and passes in the second half
on the part of the Methodist ruggers
told the tale that the Greys were hav
ing fine practice, but practically noth
ing more. A complete change in tW
Grey's line-up was made in the sec
ond half, with little avail.
The line-ups were as follows:
Varsity—Bloeser, Knight, Rehm
(Bihlman, Sample), front rank; Pet
tingill, Fisher, middle rank; Chandler,
Hal stead. Bradsn (Murray), rear rank;
Erb, half; Walker, first five; Bacon,
Jeffers, second five; Carroll, center;
Urban, Dievendorff. wings; Temple
ton, fullback.

Freshmen—Flugel. Meese, Bacon,
Jannssen, Summerfield, Boulware,
Schwartz, Bonney (Caughey), for

The freshmen added their mite to the
day by sending the Alameda high
school team home with the bitter taste
of non-victory. Despite the fact that
the All-Blacks emerged on the short
end of the score in their clash with
the Palo Alto Athletic Club, their ex

Another find was discovered in th"e

Stanford started with a rush, drib
bling to the fifteen yard line. Here
Urban dodged his way across after
receiving from a line out. Templeton
failed. A minute later Braden picked
from the loose and registered. Temple
ton converted. At this point a fifty
yard passing rush initiated by Austin,
going from Lachmund to Morris to
Reeves to Piercy, resulted in a score

missed. The remaining five minutes
of the half were profitable for Stan

making tries which went unconverted.
Austin's football skill again was re
sponsible for a score in the opening
of the second period. After intercept
ing a pass to Walker and running
thirty-five yards, he transferred to
Lachmund, who passed to Darsie for
a try. From this point on, however,

The first half of 'nineteen's bout
with Alameda proved rather listless
and uninteresting. The chief play of
note was a forty-yard drop between
the goal posts by Smith of the visiting
team, following the award of a free
kick. The second half gave evidence
of life. After a long dribbling rush
half way down the field, Caugliey
scooped from the loose and fell over
the line for the freshmen. Boulware

passing rush from Davis, Stevens,
Boydston and Long to Morris allowed
the latter to score. Conversion failed.

Speed and rugby skill featured the
Palo Alto Athletic Club's S to G vic
tory over the All-1 Hacks. During
every second of the game the ball shot
in lightning fashion up and down the
field. Single's try in the first half
gave Stanford a winning send-off. The
next period, however, showed scores
by Card and Wood for the visitors,
one conversion bringing their tally
to eight.
College ol' Pacific's football fifteen
scored an early morning victory over
the Stanford Greys on the turf Satur
day. The Greys put up a fairly good
brand of rugby but were not equal to
the charges of the Pacific players.
At the end of the first half, the Greys
were conceded a bare chance to wfn
though they held the short zero end
of an 8 to 0 score. However, dribbling
rushes and passes in the second half
on the part of the Methodist ruggers
told the tale that the Greys were hav
ing fine practice, but practically noth
ing more. A complete change in tW
Grey's line-up was made in the sec
ond half, with little avail.
The line-ups were as follows:
Varsity—Bloeser, Knight, Rehm

Stanford started with a rush, drib
bling to the fifteen yard line. Here
Urban dodged his way across after
receiving from a line out. Templeton
failed. A minute later Braden picked
from the loose and registered. Temple
ton converted. At this point a fifty
yard passing rush initiated by Austin,
going from Lachmund to Morris to

of the half were profitable for Stan

Austin's football skill again was re

thirty-five yards, he transferred to
Lachmund, who passed to Darsie for
a try. From this point on, however,

twice, and Pettingill and Urban each

The first half of 'nineteen's bout
with Alameda proved rather listless
and uninteresting. The chief play of
note was a forty-yard drop between
the goal posts by Smith of the visiting
team, following the award of a free
kick. The second half gave evidence
of life. After a long dribbling rush
half way down the field, Caugliey
scooped from the loose and fell over
the line for the freshmen. Boulware
missed conversion. Later a perfect
passing rush from Davis, Stevens,
Boydston and Long to Morris allowed
the latter to score. Conversion failed.

Lightning Play.
Speed and rugby skill featured the
Palo Alto Athletic Club's S to G vic
tory over the All-1 Hacks. During
every second of the game the ball shot
in lightning fashion up and down the
field. Single's try in the first half
gave Stanford a winning send-off. The
next period, however, showed scores
by Card and Wood for the visitors,
one conversion bringing their tally
to eight.
College ol' Pacific's football fifteen
scored an early morning victory over
the Stanford Greys on the turf Satur
day. The Greys put up a fairly good
brand of rugby but were not equal to
the charges of the Pacific players.
At the end of the first half, the Greys
were conceded a bare chance to wfn
though they held the short zero end
of an 8 to 0 score. However, dribbling
rushes and passes in the second half
on the part of the Methodist ruggers
told the tale that the Greys were hav
ing fine practice, but practically noth
ing more. A complete change in tW
Grey's line-up was made in the sec
ond half, with little avail.
The line-ups were as follows:
Varsity—Bloeser, Knight, Rehm
(Bihlman, Sample), front rank; Pet
tingill, Fisher, middle rank; Chandler,
Hal stead. Bradsn (Murray), rear rank;
Erb, half; Walker, first five; Bacon,

was putting to complete rout the black
jerseyed fifteen of the Barbarian Club.

of non-victory. Despite the fact that
the All-Blacks emerged on the short
