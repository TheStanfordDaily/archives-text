# JUNIORS BEGIN OVER
## Will Hold Entire New Election Next Friday Morning 
### 
Wiping the political slate clean at
its meeting today, the junior class de
clared last week's election null and
void, and decided to cast a fresh bal
lot on the Quad next Friday morning.
After some misunderstanding and un
certainty as to the status of those
chosen last week, all positions were
vacated by a motion of the class, and
nominations were reopened.
For president, W. F. Sisson was
nominated by G. K. Howard; H. H.
Dievendorff by L. M. Wolff, and W. J.
Stafford by R. H. Grant. Howard was
the sole nominee for the position of
vice-president, while Miss Catherine
Wright is the only one named for sec
retary. W. H. Bonnett is also run
ning alone for treasurer.
The columns of The Daily Palo Alto
were declared open for further nomi
nations until Wednesday evening, and
Thursday is the final time set for the
withdrawal of any candidate.
In a short speech before the class,
E. R. Heal made it plain that his rea
son for declining the nomination for
president at such a late hour last
week, was that he probably will not
remain in the university for the entire
semester.
The exact status of Howard was a
puzzle which it took much time to
unravel. Some thought, in view of
the fact that he had been elected vice
president and that A. H. McEuen had
resigned from the presidency, he had
automatically become president. On
this ground a motion made by Ileal to
make Howard president was denied,
as it was felt that he was already act
ing president.
Howard himself cleared up the dif
ficulty by movine for a new election.
A motion by W. E. Licking to make
nominations entirely through the col
umns of The Daily Palo Alto, was lost,
and the nominations were then made
by the class as a body.
