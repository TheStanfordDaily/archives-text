### 
Santa Clara fifteen stretched the
score board to the limit yesterday af
ternoon in a game with the Barbarian
Club, which ended 62 to 0 against the
Berkeley organization.
The Barbarians were handicapped
by the absence of several of their star
players, particularly Austin, Lach
mund, and Reeves, who were seen in
Saturday's game against Stanford.
The Santa Clara players were on
their fset all the time and put up the
fastest series of passes and dribbling
rushes that have been exhibited on
the mission town field for some time.
