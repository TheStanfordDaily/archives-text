Some time ago, Napoleon schemed a
hunch for making the rivers of Europe
run up hill, and a lot more of that his
torical stuff. Otherwise, France
wouldn't have been cut off from the
Louisiana cane fields, and Paris
wouldn't have lacked sweetening for
its demi tasscs, and the Academy of
Science wouldn't have got busy, and
there might not be any such thing to
day as the California beet sugar in
dustry.
And if Brutus hadn't loved Rome
more, there wouldn't have been any
excuse for Mark Anthony to get by
with his big talk, and Shakespeare
wouldn't have been there to take it
down in shorthand for the benefit of
posterity.
That's just the same as saying that
hard luck keeps civilization on the
jump.
It is sort of hard to wax enthusias
tic over the joys that have cropped
out of the intercollegiate disagree
ment between California and Stan
ford. However, it seems a pretty good
guess that the freshman bonfire folly
has received a jolt it can't recover
from, even if the rival varsities get
back into harness, and carry the Rig
Game along for years to come. For
that much encouragement of good
sense we can well afford to give
thanks.
There ought to be a blaze to light
the serpentine of Stanford men the
Thursday night before the team takes
the field in its big fight of the season.
Just as much this year as any other,
for the fight will be just aa hard an it
ever was. Rut in the absence of ap
proaching conflict with our traditional
enemy, we are inclined to wonder how
big the pyre has to be. Very surely,
one fifty feet high doesn't give any
more light than one a quarter the size.
We can fan Stanford snirit in the
freshmen otherwise than by keeping
them at work on the wood pile dur
ing the fall. Teach them the songs
and yells we are going to invent with
in the next six weeks, and see that
they get their season tickets punched
full of holes. Maybe if the big fire
is foregone, more of the freshmen
will live to a ripe old age in our midst.
The faculty gets real jealous of the
time spent on that blaze every fall.
And there won't be any reason to
shiver with human svmnathy and won
der how far that fuel would go if it
were distributed somewhere.
