# Pool Ready---Fence Is Not

Only one more step, the completion
of a suitable inclosure, and Stanford's
cherished dream of a swimming pool
will become a reality. The apparatus
constructed for the purpose of prop
erly cleansing the water, tha system
for heating, and the tank itself have
all been thoroughly tested and de
clared ready for use.
In order that tha Searsville water,
which is known to possess some un
pleasant characteristics, may be made
suitable for bathing purpses, an elab
rate system of filtering has been in
stalled.
The water passes first through the
tall tower where it underges a process
of aeration. That is. the water is
driven into finely divided spray and
then by means of electric fans a strong
current of air is forced through the
showers. This peration is for the pur
pose of removing gases which lend
the objectionable odor to the Sears
ville water. Following this treatment
a certain amount of sodium hydrox
ide which is already present in the
water is coagulated by alum sulphate.
A heavy web-like precityitate pro
duced which settles to the bottom and
in so doing carries much foreign mat
ter with it. The water is next turned
into the sedimentation tanks where
all sediment caught by the alum sul
phate and sodium hydroxide are re
moved. Then follow the filtration
tanks where the water is slowly fil
tered through fine sand. The last
process is that of chlorination, an op
eration which is intended primarily to
remove bacteria.
