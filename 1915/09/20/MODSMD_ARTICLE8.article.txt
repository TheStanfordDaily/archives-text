# "UNIVERSITY TRAINING PURPOSED TO MAKE LEADERS"
## DR. JORDAN URGES IEDEALS Chancellor Shows Co-ordination Between Wisdom, Ethics and Religion 
### 
"As a man leaves college, so he is
for the rest of his days," said Chan
cellor Jordan to two hundred men
gathered in Encina Hall last night at
the second Y. M. C. A. Sunday even
ing lecture.
"Wisdom is knowing what you ought
to do next. Virtue is doing it. Reli
gion is the reason for doing it," con
tinued the Chancellor, telling some
of the vital points in shaping men's
characters.
"It's worth while to keep up physi
cal exercise as recreation. However,
football in the American style is not
a recreation; it is a business.
"The university gives a wider range
of ideas, extending beyond the sur
face. The university man is one of
the picked half million that commands
because of knowledge of facts beyond
the surface. He has the satisfaction
of leading a procession consisting
principally of himself. Others may
or may not follow. The college man
ought to control people not by force
but by brains.
"The matter of money is an impor
tant one. The financier is the man
who says, 'All that is not nailed down
is mine.' He may get rich, in prison,
and in the head lines. Men should he
perfectly straight in their financial
dealings.
"The matter of dealing with women
is vital to the college man. The great
est good is found in love—real old
fashioned, romantic love. A man sees
the best women he'll ever see in col
lege. The women see the best men
they'll ever see while in college. Col
lege men ought to pick out their mates
from college women. There is no
hurry, though, and the freshmen
should wait until the seniors have had
their pick. Don't fall in love until
you're sure of staying there. Falling
in love was not made to be a habit."
Following the main lecture, Dr. Jor
dan was called on to tell of his expe
riences with Dr. Mez, the peace advo
cate. who will give three lectures this
week in the Union for the benefit of
those who could not hear him at the
peace congress sessions.
