# INTERCLASS TITLE WON BY JUNIOR TEAM IN CLOSE GAME
## LONE THREE POINT SUFFICES Hard-Fought Contest Featured by Absence of Varsity from Both Lineups 
### 
Sixteen juniors gave the sophomores
a 3 to 0 proof of their rugby suprem
acy yesterday afternoon when they
met in the interclass finals on the
football turf. As the score indicates,
the game was not won until the last,
gun had cracked. Upperclassman
fought underclassman up and down
the field from start to finish, and the
very fight with which the rival classes
went at things tended to detract from
the brand of rugby displayed on both
sides.
This year's game was no contest in
lining up varsity players as is too
often the case in the interclass series.
Only one «"S" man appeared on the
field, when Pettingil 1 played for the
juniors.
Although the third year fifteen was
seriously handicapped by the absence
of Wylie from the strength of the
scrum, the sophomore ranks were in
turn forced to number Chandler and
Coleman among the missing. Swigart,
whose injury had prevented his ap
pearing against the seniors, was seen
again at second five.
Templeton's kick-off sent the ball
into junior territory, where it stayed
pretty consistently during the first
part of the game. Several long gains
for the 'eighteeners through Temple
ton's clever boots to touch were an
swered as consistently from the jun
ior side by West.
An injury to the upperclass half
back, Tedford, resulted in the shifting
of Dickey to half, his berth at center
three-quarters being filled by Hammon.
Following two free kicks which net
ted long gains for the juniors, Bihl
man secured the ball and bore down
toward the eighteen goal line. A
scrum on the five-yard line gave the
third-year forwards a chance to heel
the ball out to the waiting half.
Dickey passed to Ames who went over
the line for the only score of the day.
West failed to convert from a dizzy
angle.
A second count seemed imminent at
the end of the first half, f.hen the pis
tol found the ball well within sopho
more territory. Fast, close play for
some seconds after the signal.
Schwarzenbek ended the suspense
by making a short kick to touch.
The second period of play was
marked by no further tally. The play
switched from one end of the field to
the other, the sophomores menacing
the junior goal line more than once.
A pretty run by Templeton through
thirty yards of sophomore territory
was followed by a long boot from West
which whirled the ball into touch just
as the final pistol cracked.
The line-ups follow:
Juniors —Bihlman, Sample, Smith
erum, front rank; Pettingill (Scott),

Sixteen juniors gave the sophomores
a 3 to 0 proof of their rugby suprem
acy yesterday afternoon when they
met in the interclass finals on the
football turf. As the score indicates,
the game was not won until the last,
gun had cracked. Upperclassman
fought underclassman up and down
the field from start to finish, and the
very fight with which the rival classes
went at things tended to detract from
the brand of rugby displayed on both
sides.
This year's game was no contest in
lining up varsity players as is too
often the case in the interclass series.
Only one «"S" man appeared on the
field, when Pettingil 1 played for the
juniors.
Although the third year fifteen was
seriously handicapped by the absence
of Wylie from the strength of the
scrum, the sophomore ranks were in
turn forced to number Chandler and
Coleman among the missing. Swigart,
whose injury had prevented his ap
pearing against the seniors, was seen
again at second five.
Templeton's kick-off sent the ball
into junior territory, where it stayed
pretty consistently during the first
part of the game. Several long gains
for the 'eighteeners through Temple
ton's clever boots to touch were an
swered as consistently from the jun
ior side by West.
An injury to the upperclass half
back, Tedford, resulted in the shifting
of Dickey to half, his berth at center
three-quarters being filled by Hammon.
Following two free kicks which net
ted long gains for the juniors, Bihl
man secured the ball and bore down
toward the eighteen goal line. A
scrum on the five-yard line gave the
third-year forwards a chance to heel
the ball out to the waiting half.
Dickey passed to Ames who went over
the line for the only score of the day.
West failed to convert from a dizzy
angle.
A second count seemed imminent at
the end of the first half, f.hen the pis
tol found the ball well within sopho
more territory. Fast, close play for
some seconds after the signal.
Schwarzenbek ended the suspense
by making a short kick to touch.
The second period of play was
marked by no further tally. The play
switched from one end of the field to
the other, the sophomores menacing
the junior goal line more than once.
A pretty run by Templeton through
thirty yards of sophomore territory
was followed by a long boot from West
which whirled the ball into touch just
as the final pistol cracked.
The line-ups follow:
Juniors —Bihlman, Sample, Smith
erum, front rank; Pettingill (Scott),
Halsted, middle rank; Harris, Glad
stone, breakaways; Murray, lock;
Tedford (Dickey J half; J. Bacon,
