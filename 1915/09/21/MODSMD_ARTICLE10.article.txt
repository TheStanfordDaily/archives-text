The club has been organized on an
entirely new basis, the standard of
membership having been so raised that
a re-election of the older members
was necessary. An assessment for
each semester is to be levied.
A doubles tournament will be held
this Friday on the Roble gymnasium
courts for the new trophy cup, re

Club properties, and is without name,
date, or any distinguishing marks. It
is a handsome silver, gold lined cup,
and Miss Turner proposes to have it
polished and suitably engraved. The

All women tennis players of the uni
versity are to enter the contest. Mem
bers are requested to choose part
ners for this doubles tournament and

mediately.
