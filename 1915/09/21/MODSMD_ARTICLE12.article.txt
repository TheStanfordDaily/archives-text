# AMERICAN RUGBY TEAMS MAY TAKE TRIP TO ANTIPODES
## GENEROUS OFFER IS RUMORED Oxford Man is Responsible for Plan to Export Best Prep and Varsity Teams 
### 
That rugby teams may compete for
higher honors than championship of
the Pacific Coast or even the United
States as the result of an offer made
recently to the Rugby Union by a
prominent Oxford University man, is
the substance of a report which
reached The Daily Palo Alto today.
The plan, according to developments
today, is to send two teams, one senior
and one junior to invade Australia and
New Zealand, following the regular
season here.
The trips would probably be award
ed to the high school team capturing
the American championship, and the
college team that is successful over
the most competitors. Just what
series of games would have to be
played to entitle the victorious team
the trip to the South Sea is not known.
Reports of the offer were given to
Doctor Angell by Referee Mullineaux,
who, however, did not give out the
name of the Oxford man who was
willing to pay the expenses of sending
the teams to Australia. The offer has
not been brought before the Rugby
Union, formally, according to Presi
dent Palmer Puller.
But one condition is made to the
initiation of the plan this year, that
being that the war end before next
May. The reason for making this stip
ulation, according to Dr. Angell, is
that practically all the athletes of the
British colonies are now in the army
or navy of England, and therefore
American teams going to the Anti
podes would not find competition
enough to make the trip interesting.
This seems to point to the fact that
the offer is withheld from definite
action until conditions make its re
ception possible.
