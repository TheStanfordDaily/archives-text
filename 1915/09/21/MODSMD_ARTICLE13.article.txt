### 
Freshmen versus Palo Alto high
high school will be tomorrow's mid
week attraction for Stanford rugby
fans. This will be the second mix-up

teens, and indications tend to prove
that the contest will be lively and to
the point from start to finish.

squads the frashmen held the better
end of the 10 to 4 score at the final
crack of the gun. However, since that
time the Palo Alto players have de
feated Centervill? and Belmont by de
cisive scores, and feel in shape to give
the campus players a harder run for
their money this time. The Stanford
babies hav3 also defeated Alameda
high school in the interim.

ers upon producing season paste
boards. or digging down in their je ins
