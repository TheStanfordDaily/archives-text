# Dry As Dust
## 
### 
This kind of thing is as dry writing
as it is reading, and we know it, so yon
haven't anything on the writer. Too
bad to talk about unpleasant alterna
tives, but the Stanford men are either
going to make student control work, or
let it fizzle. Whichever happens, no
one will dispute our claim to the credit.
We have all got to vote, individually
and collectively. Help to elect five
competent representatives-at-large to
the Conference Thursday. Fill up the
nominations column in The Daily Palo
Alto tomorrow evening. This election
is getting a late start, but let's put
some zip in it anyway.
There is a man's work ahead for
everyone of the five who is chosen.
Whether he is equal to the job or not
there is no question about the job. ft
is a regular one. Student government
is ours, as long as we show something,
but we have only an option on it. Some
people say it is a joke. There is no
need to take issue on that point now,
but for goodness sake let's turn the
laugh if there is any cause for one.
Cast vour vote for srnod men.
