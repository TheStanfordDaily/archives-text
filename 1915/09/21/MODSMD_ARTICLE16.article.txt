Yesterday afternoon one of the proof
readers, or a copy boy, or same other
inspired member of the staff, squared
a grudge against the editorial We.
The person lost a couple of pet para
graphs which sought in a modest way
to throw additional light on our atti
tude toward the freshman bonfire.
For the benefit of one of the most
careful readers of this column we
print the lost portion of the document
as follows:
There have been murmurs that
Stanford should forego the bon
fire, and serpentine, and big Thurs
day night rally for the team this
year. If those demonstrations
had been inaugurated as a com
munion of love for California, it
would be very well to wrap them
In lavender and moth balls, and
lay them aside. Hut they weren't.
Where we can afford to use mod
eration is in reducing the size of
the bonfire. My saving a lot of
good wood we can take to our
selves a lesson in economy. The
cords of fuel which burn merrily
after all the community is asleep,
and well on into the next morning,
do no one any benefit. The avail
able light from a smaller ftile is
just as great. And the hours spent
by freshmen in building the rally
fires of past years might have
been spent better.
That ends the ancient history. Dur
ing the next few weeks it won't be
amiss at any time to ask how the sons
and yell writers are getting along with
their new efforts.
