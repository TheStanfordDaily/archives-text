TO THE POINT
Tennis, as it is played today has
found a new place in the field of
sports. The final contest for the sin
gles title was between two Califor
nians, and the final match for the dou
bles title today will be between two
teams from California. This supre
macy of the west is due in part to the
favorable climate of the Pacific coast's
tennis champion-producing state, it is
also due in 110 small degree to the fact
that the game has been played more
generally in the west than in the east.
New York Times (editorial), Sept. 8.
Not even a smile in that! It's seri
ous stuff. And even more serious is
the comment on the "wonderful tennis
facilities" that exist in every Cali
fornia hamlet. Serious, yet ludicrous.
Unconsciously and automatically, the
N. Y. editorial omits Stanford Univer
sity, Cal. The editorial writer could
not help himself. Whether you call
this campus a hamlet or an othello,
its a cinch that "tennis facilities"
is no term to apply. For there is a
sign over our tennis courts which
reads: "Visitors please keep out or
refrain from comment." Behold a
sour extract, a sandwich from the
graduate manager's report of a year
ago:
Chess expense $ 12.00
Debating 139.83
Tennis .55
Track 1288.62
Rugby 6126.75
Some sandwich that. Whether it's a
club or a Manhattan cannot be deter
mined. but that there's cheese in it is
certain.
