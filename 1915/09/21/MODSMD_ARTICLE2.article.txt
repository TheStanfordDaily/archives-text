# ASSISTANT YELL LEADERS
## Will be Named by Executive committee Tomorrow Following Final Tryout on Bleachers 
### 
Owing to the fact that it is impos
sible to have concerted cheering while
the yell leader tryouts are in progress,
it has been decided to bring the con
test for assistants to a conclusion to
morrow. Originally it was planned to
run the trials until Saturday, but
owing to the above reason, the last
bleacher vote will be taken Wednes
day afternoon. Following tomorrow's
game votes will be counted by the
executive committee at its regular
meeting, at which the two assistants
will be elected.
At Saturday's game the newly
elected leaders will wave arms with
Johnny Goodman.
