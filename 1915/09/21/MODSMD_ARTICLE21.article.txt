# Vacation Is Spent In Production of Pageants
## G. A. Hughes, '16, Springs Into Prominence as His Plays Win Popularity 
### 
Varied and interesting as have been
the occupations undertaken by Stan
ford men during the summer vaca
tions, it has remained for G. A.
Hughes, ' IG, to add what is perhaps
the most unusual of all student vaca
tion work; that of writing pageants.
During the past summer Hughes,
aside from writing several pageants,
assisted in the direction of three dra
matic spectacles and one play. The
largest of these, the Long Beach Pa
geant Play, which was written by
Hughes during the summer of 1914,
was the largest pageant of its kind
ever given west of St. Louis.
Cast Numbers 1200.
In the course of this presentation,
which was financed by the city of
Long Beach, twelve hundred people
were required. The cast was made
up largely of students of the Long
Ueach high school. The object of the
pageant was to present in realistic
form the history of California from
the earliest days, through the Spanish
era and up to the present day. Hughes
paid the greatest attention to detail,
presenting with accuracy the life and
customs of the people of the various
periods.
Perry Newberry, one of the best
known pageant masters of the west,
was in direct charge of the play.
Hughes had written the manuscript
during the previous summer and with
Newberry began his rehearsals in
March, fully two months before the
date set for opening. Immediately
upon the close of school in May,
Hughes returned to Long Beach and
was present during the final re
hearsals.
Presentation Successful.
The pageant was repeated four
nights and attracted capacity audi
ences at each performance. The pre
sentation was hailed as a success
throughout the southern part of the
state, with the result that the writer
at once sprang into considerable
prominence.
As a direct result of the success of
the Long Beach pageant, Hughes ac
companied Director Newberry to Car
mel where the two presented a mission
pageant, written by the Stanford man.
This spectacle was later shown twice
in the Court of the Universe at the
Exposition. Both performances in San
Francisco were witnessed by 25,000
people.
The next step in Hughes' eventful
summer was a return to Carmel, where
he presented"The Man from Home."
Harry Leon Wilson, one of the authors
of the well known play assisted in
the direction of this production.
At Exposition.
"The Pageant of Monterey," depict
ing the early Spanish-American con
flicts, was then written by Hughes
for presentation at the Exposition,
where it was staged by Hughes and
Newberry. One troop of United States
cavalry, two hundred United States
marines, the University of California
glee club, and Mile. La Gai's ballet
dancers were necessary for this spec
tacular production which was given
twice before immense audiences.
As the prospective civil engineer
seeks work as a surveyor during his
summer's vacation, so Hughes takes
nit the work of writing pageants, as
he intends to follow up dramatic writ
ing as a profession. Hughes' tenta
tive plans for next summer include a
pageant of Hawaiian history to be
given in Honolulu.

presenting with accuracy the life and
customs of the people of the various
periods.
Perry Newberry, one of the best
known pageant masters of the west,
was in direct charge of the play.
Hughes had written the manuscript
during the previous summer and with
Newberry began his rehearsals in
March, fully two months before the
date set for opening. Immediately
upon the close of school in May,
Hughes returned to Long Beach and
was present during the final re
hearsals.
Presentation Successful.
The pageant was repeated four
nights and attracted capacity audi
ences at each performance. The pre
sentation was hailed as a success
throughout the southern part of the
state, with the result that the writer
at once sprang into considerable
prominence.
As a direct result of the success of
the Long Beach pageant, Hughes ac
companied Director Newberry to Car
mel where the two presented a mission
pageant, written by the Stanford man.
This spectacle was later shown twice
in the Court of the Universe at the
Exposition. Both performances in San
Francisco were witnessed by 25,000
people.
The next step in Hughes' eventful
summer was a return to Carmel, where
he presented"The Man from Home."
Harry Leon Wilson, one of the authors
of the well known play assisted in
the direction of this production.
At Exposition.
"The Pageant of Monterey," depict
ing the early Spanish-American con
flicts, was then written by Hughes
for presentation at the Exposition,
where it was staged by Hughes and
Newberry. One troop of United States
cavalry, two hundred United States
marines, the University of California
glee club, and Mile. La Gai's ballet
dancers were necessary for this spec
tacular production which was given
twice before immense audiences.
As the prospective civil engineer
seeks work as a surveyor during his
summer's vacation, so Hughes takes
nit the work of writing pageants, as
he intends to follow up dramatic writ
ing as a profession. Hughes' tenta
tive plans for next summer include a
pageant of Hawaiian history to be
given in Honolulu.
Varied and interesting as have been
the occupations undertaken by Stan
ford men during the summer vaca
tions, it has remained for G. A.
Hughes, ' IG, to add what is perhaps
the most unusual of all student vaca
tion work; that of writing pageants.
During the past summer Hughes,
aside from writing several pageants,
assisted in the direction of three dra
matic spectacles and one play. The
largest of these, the Long Beach Pa
geant Play, which was written by
Hughes during the summer of 1914,
was the largest pageant of its kind
ever given west of St. Louis.
Cast Numbers 1200.
In the course of this presentation,
which was financed by the city of
Long Beach, twelve hundred people
were required. The cast was made
up largely of students of the Long
Ueach high school. The object of the
pageant was to present in realistic
form the history of California from
the earliest days, through the Spanish
era and up to the present day. Hughes
paid the greatest attention to detail,
presenting with accuracy the life and
customs of the people of the various
periods.
