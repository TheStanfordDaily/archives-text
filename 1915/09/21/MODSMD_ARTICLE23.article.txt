# SLIGHT CHANGE IN CAST OF "STOP THIEF"
## New Set of Scenery Being Preparedâ€”Largest Setting Ever Used on Campus 
### 
Two weeks of rehearsal have
brought the action of "Stop Thief" to
the point where the situations are tail
ing definite shape in the hands of the
Sword and Sandals cast. The first act
is practically letter-perfect, giving the
actors ample time to work up the stage
business to a place where they can
work with the rapid fire style which
the comedy demands.
A slight change has been made in
the cast. The part of the bride has
been given up by Miss Phyllis Auze
rais, '18, who was originally cast for
this role, and it will be assumed by
Miss Marian Vaugh'an, 'IG. Miss
Vaughan has recently appeared in
"Men and Women" and in "Sherwood."
The new set of scenery which is be
ing prepared for the performance, will
till the entire Assembly Hill stage.
This is the largest set which has ever
been used on the campus. The com
plications of the whirlwind comedy
make an unusual setting necessary,
and the scene as laid will have three
doors to the right and three to the
left of the stage. In and out of these
doors at the most opportune and inop
portune moments come the characters
in the entangled farce.
Only the one set of scenery will be
nsad and this will make the usual be
tween-acts yawning spaces conspicu
ous by their absence. The only
changes will be those of costume and,
in the case of the maid and the thief,
those of personality, as they put on
their masks of suavity before the other
characters in the play.
