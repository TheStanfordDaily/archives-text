# Pay Day, Jitneys at Bay, But Jackies Do Not Come This Way
## 
### 
Yo ho! An' a bottle o' rum,
Here's a tale o' the main!
Yesterday at eight Del Is the look-out
on the battleship Oregon shifted the
binnacles and piped the paymaster's
launch off port side. He signaled the
captain and the quartermaster drop
ped the hauser over the jib-boom.
They hoisted the bags 011 deck, and in
half an hour every jacky on board had
his hands full of cash.
Yesterday at eight bells the look-out
for the jitney bus union stationed at
the fair grounds shifted his specs anil
piped the paymaster's launch sidling
up to port side the good ship Oregon,
lie had a hunch, and in half an hour
had signaled twenty-six other jitney
drivers to help relieve the jackies of
their cash, for jackies have no pock
ets in their jeans. The stunt was a
trip to the Stanford Farm.
However, 110 self respecting jacky
could carry seven months' pay in his
hands for twelve hours, and today
when the jitney men assembled to
take the sailors on board, not a man o'
the men had a cent on his person.
It is rumored that the navy shifted
to "Port" last night.
It may be seven months more before
the jackies get paid again. Maybe
they'll visit the Stanford Farm then.
