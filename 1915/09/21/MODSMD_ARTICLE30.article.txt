# Sing a Song of Santa Clara Old Favorites Will Not Do
## 
### 
Considerable interest is being shown
this year in the prize song and yell
contests recently announced. Many
of the old bleacher favorites won't do
at all this year, owing to the fact that
the big game with Santa Clara has
replaced that with the University of
California. .
No less than nine of the Stanford
rooting songs will have to undergo
extensive improvements before they
will be fit for service. New words to
the old tunes, or, btetter yet, new
tunes, also, will have to be originated
before October 10, when all contribu
tions must be handed to varsity yell
leader, J. H. Goodman, '16.
Among the best, known bleacher bal
lads which will have to go by the board
because they contain references to the
"Berkeley bear" are "Sons of the
Stanford Red," "Berkeley's Tomb
stone," the "fighting," "bum-bum"
and "rah rah" songs, "The Conquering
Cardinal" and the more recent "Cali
fornia's Burial"; "The Cardinal is Wav
ing," both words and music of which
are the work of W. G. Paul, '15, and
"The Victorious Cardinal," Ihe words
of which are by M. A. Hagen, '15, and
the music by M. Blumenthal, '16.
