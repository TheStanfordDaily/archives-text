# KICK-OFFS
## 
### 
Three men have been promoted from
the outside squad to the inner turf ag
gregations so far this week by Coach
Brown and his assistant, Bill Fletcher.
They are Joe Maltby, senior, and Wood
and Sheedy, freshmen.
Jim Wylie and his cold, Roscoe
Chandler and his hip. and Dick Cole
man plus his cold, have been placed
on the sick list for a few days. Ail of
these men were unable to enter the
sophomore-junior same yesterday af
ternoon.
The best rooting of the season, so
far, featured the contest yesterday be
tween the sophs and juniors. Ac
cording to some of the faithful ones,
who have been watching the games
since games began—this season —a
little of the keen interclass rivalry and
spirit injected into the rooting sec
tion as a whole on regular days would
help to make some of Stanford's yells
echo around Santa Clara.
Malcom Tedford will be kept from
practice for several days as the result
of his collision with Frank Walker in
yesterday's gam?. "Mutt" Temple
ton has invited Teddy to join the Fra
ternal Order of the Crutch, until the
two can be seen in action on their
pins again.
