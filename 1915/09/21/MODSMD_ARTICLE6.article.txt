Failure of upperclassmen to
nominate candidates-at-larg(E
for the University Conference as
expected, on the Quad today,
makes imperative that at least
five nominations be made to
morrow in the columns of The
Daily Palo Alto. These nomi
nations must reach The Daily
Palo Alto by 2 o'clock, to insure
publication, which is the only
legal manner of announcing can
didates. Due to short notice,
unusual interest in the election
is needed, and it is hoped that
this notice will bring a flood of
nominations. The polls will be
open Thursday morning and
afternoon.
