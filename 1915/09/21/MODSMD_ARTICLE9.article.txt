# TRACK TEAM STRONG
## Will Compete for Title in Meet at Exposition Saturday 
### 
Stanford will send to the champion
ship track meet on the Pacific Asso
ciation of the Amateur Athletic Union,
to be held under the auspices of the
Exposition at the Exposition athletic
grounds next Saturday, a track team
unusually large and well balanced,
considering the character of the meet.
The aggregation as a whole is in
good shape for this time of year and
includes, besides several "S" men, a
number of prep school stars of repu
tation.
Peg Murray and Bill Losh are both
entered for the two sprints, but it is
probable that Murray will not enter
the longer event, the 220, for the rea
son that he intends to enter both
hurdles. His assistant in the hurdles
will be Johnny Norton. Wright Lynn,
who is rapidly getting into condition,
and Norton will take care of the Car
dinal interests in the quarter.
In the mile will be entered L. L.
Chapman, the sophomore who last
year took third in the two-mile, and M.
Price, a freshman of good prep school
experience.
The field events boast of a longer
list of contestants. Bob Krohn, who
has been consistently working out
since the beginning of college, will
undoubtedly enter his favorite event,
the pole vault. The high jump will be
entered by W. R. Wheatly, '17, who
has recovered from his accident on
the turf, and by C. E. Later, a fresh
man who has been doing well in
practice.
Wheatly will also enter the running
hop, step and jump. His partner will
be C. Smead, holder of the interschol
astic world's record in this event.
Smead and Hill Sisson will take care
of the broad jump.
Vernon King is entered for the ham
mer throw, Reg Caughey for the shot
put and Bart Gillespie for the discus.
