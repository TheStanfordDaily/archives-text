# CAPTAIN MALONE, U.S.A., WILL INVADE CAMP OF PEACE
## SPEAKS THURSDAY EVENING Military Training to be the Subject and the Union the Place 
### 
"In the camps of the enemy," is the
situation which Captain P. 15. Malome,
Second Infantry, U. S. A., will face
on next Tuesday evening when he ad
dresses a body of Stanford men and
women on the subject of "The train
ing camp as it is today, a proposed
system of military training, and the
need of national preparation as in
surance against war." The talk,
which will not be more than thirty
minutes in length, will be made from
the steps of the Stanford Union. It
commences at 7:30.
Captain Malome is undoubtedly well
qualified to speak on the subject of
training camps and the nation's un
preparedness for war as any officer
now active in the United States Army.
In recognition of his ability in train
ing camp work he has, for the past
summer months, been specially ap
pointed by the War department to take
charge first, of the students, and later
of the business and professional man's
training camp at the Presidio, San
Francisco. He has received the finest
military education, being a graduate
of the national military school at West
Point and a distinguished graduate
of the staff and line officers school at
Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In addi
tion to these advantages Captain Ma
lom? has seen actual service in the
Philippines and Cuba, where he took a
prominent part in the famous battle of
San .Toan Hill. He has also served on
the general staff at Washington, D. C.
Although a solider first and fore
most, Captain Malome is known both
as a distinguished writer and a force
ful speaker. In many of his articles,
one of which may be found in the Cen
tury Magazine for .Tune, 1913. he deals
with the psychology and history of
war. However, his investigations
have by no means been limited to
this field.
The suggestion of presenting to
Stanford students another view of a
great national problem was enthusi
astically received by Chancellor Jor
dan and President Branner.
The Stanford Hand, it is hoped, will
be on hand Tuesday evening to insure
the success of Captain Malome's visit.
Immediately following the talk, a
short smoker with light refreshments
will be held in the Union where every
one will be welcome.
