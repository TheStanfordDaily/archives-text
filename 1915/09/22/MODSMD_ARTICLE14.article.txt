Somewhere, somehow, somebody that
is honest and kind hearted, but very
tired, or lazy, or plumb sick may see
this. Maybe if he doesn't have to think
hard, he will be glad to know what
we think about the quarantine on nom
ination meetings and elections. We
think it ought to be lifted at sunrise
tomorrow.
There is nothing to this talk about
an epidemic of sleeping sickness, and
hookworm affection having reached
the campus. That isn't the name of
the disease at all, and people who use
such vulgar words don't know what
they are talking about.
Listen to the cause of the whole
trouble. Just a measly little bug, and
there isn't a word in the English lan
guage to name it, so we must import
one. Ennui is the way you.spell the
infirmity, and we don't care how you
pronounce it. Anyway, it means that
the joke will be on us if we don't take
a hand in our local government.
The only way you can cure yourself
is to take a cold bath tomorrow before
you go to class. Do that, or sit up all
night,—anything to keep you awake,
and you can be confident of voting at
the Conference elections.
Indications are that the campus is
slowly recovering anyhow. Though
scarcely anybody took part in the
junior class nominations last week,
there were all of eighteen seniors
out today. That is good, but do even
better tomorrow because we want to
keep student control away from the
faculty. That is an inside tip.
