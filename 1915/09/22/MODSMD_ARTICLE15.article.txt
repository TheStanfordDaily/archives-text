# ANNUAL PAJAMA PEERADE STAGED BY ENCINA MEN
## 
### 
Three hundred Encina Hall men
went on their annual rampage about
the campus last night "dressed" in
pajamas of all styles; slit legs, sleeve
less, loose-fitting, hobbles and other
designs without number. After a
noisy march through Encina from bot
tom to top and vice versa, the parade
"made its way" to Roble where the
men received the inspection of one
hundred Roble residents. The next
place to be honored by the paraders
was Wilson's which was given a thor
ough inspection.
"Halie" Dent, baseball captain, Beta
Theta Pi; "Chick" Orme, crew captain.
Delta Upsilon, and "Danny" Carroll,
football captain, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
were enthusiastically cheered by the
"army of three hundred." As a diver
sion, the parade course was made to
include all sorority porches, making
window space a scarce commodity for
the time being. Realizing that the pa
raders were working hard, the Delta
Upsilon members hauled two boxes
of apples out of their larder and set
them along the march.
The annual pajattia picture was then
taken on the steps of Encina.
