## Santa Claran Says We Are Too Generous With Cigars 
### 
Father White, moderator of athlet
ics at Santa Clara college, has one
grudge against the men of Stanford:
they are too generous with cigars.
Not that Father White objects to
cigars—he enjoys them in moderate
quantities,—for he is young, lively,

lows, in spite of the two rather digni
fied appellations that are attached to
his names.
Father White has much to say of
Santa Clara. "Everything is going
fine with us this year," he said this
afternoon at a conference held in the

the regular squads.
"I am heartily in favor of the plan
suggested of sending two teams to
Australia each year. I understand
that this Oxford man has offered five
thousand pounds, though I don't know
details of the proposition.
"We've had two of the biggest ral
lies ever held on the campus already
this year. Santa Clara is for rugby
and rugby only, no matter what other
colleges decide to play.
"While we are at it, we are going
to show you real competition in rugby,
and then we're coming up to beat
you in track and baseball."
