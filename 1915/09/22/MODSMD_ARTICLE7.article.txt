# STAND ON RUGBY PUBLISHED
## OFFICIAL STATEMENT ISSUED BY DR. ANGELL 
### 
Stanford's first official statement
issued to preparatory schools and out
siders regarding the Cardinal stand
011 the rugby situation was made pub
lic today by Dr. Frank Angell, chair
man of the faculty athletic committee.
Stat ments by individuals have been
mad? publicly, and have fairly well
expressed the student body opinion,
but the present articles under the
head, "Stanford Policy in Athletics,"
represent the official action of all ath
letic committees that have any author
ity in regard to sports played by the
university, being signed by Dr. Angell
for the faculty, Herbert R. Stolz of
the physical department, and E. C.
Behrens, graduate manager.
That Stanford has taken the stand
for rugby because rugby is a better
form of sport for the majority than
any other brand of football is the as
sertion of the committee that has
compiled the articles. The statement
has been sent to every preparatory
school in California, and has been
worked up as the result of inquiries
regarding Stanford's official stand, as
is explained in the preliminary para
graph, which says:
To meet inquiries in regard to Stan
ford's position in the present football situ
ation as well as to settle rumors, we be.'
to submit the following statement which
is also practically a statement of Stan
ford's general athletic policy.
The college game of football was abol
ished by the Stanford faculty and the
rugby game taken up by the students as
an outcome of a deliberate policy of in
creasing participation and pleasure in ath
letic sports in general and in football in
particular.
The College Sport.
Briefly, the football conditions ;:t Stan
ford formerly were what they are today
in a great majority of American colleges ;
a relatively small squad of men, signifi
cantly termed "material" is trained and
drilled by a coach according to his ideas
of tactics and strategy, with the purpose
of forming a varsity team to play inter
collegiate games This is in no sense a
college sport.
In this respect the change to rugby
football at Stanford brought about results
which we consider desirable : the number
of football players has greatly increased
and the period of play has often lasted
up to the end of the semester instead of
stopping absolutely with the "big game."
Men of all sizes and weights have entered
into the sport, most of them with small
hope and many with no intention of "mak
ing" the varsity. Besides sporadic class and
departmental games, a regularly organ
ized volunteer league has played through
the season and the limit of the number
of players was the limit of the capacity of
the three football fields. An unexpected
outcome of the change to rugby football
was the increase in the numbers of those
taking part in other sports: the number
of track and field men grew rapidly and a
regularly playing baseball league came
into existence. The tradition then, of in
tercollegiate teams being developed on a
basis of college sport is growing up at
Stanford. That the conditions are ideal
we do not pretend, but that athletic atmos
phere has been remarkably improved with
in the last ten years is a common remark
of the older alumni.
American a Business.
At the present juncture Stanford has
been urged to take tip the college game
on the grounds that the game has been
opened up and freed from certain objec

tionable features of ten years ago. We
think there can he no reasonable doubt
of the truth of these statements, but it
is also evident that the game has grown
in complication with the inevitable ten
dency of necessitating an earlier selection
of a team, which again is opposed to the
Stanford idea. This tendency is shown in
the.east in convening teams for practice
before the opening of college and even in
keeping a team at work during the vaca
tion. This is not sport; it is business,
the business of winning intercollegiate
games. Furthermore, we desire to say
frankly that any game whose rules call
for two officials on the field of play to
watch (teams) eleven players is quite in
compatible with the system of sponta
neous athletics which we are trying 1o
establish at Stanford. PÂ«ut the changes
in the college game hardly meet the ob
jections which lead to its abolition here.
As noted above, the sport as it exists at
the great majority of American colleges
consists in the drilling of a small and rap
idly diminishing number of players to
form a team to play intercollegiate
matches This is one of the conditions
which, in place of pleasure of competition,
has developed the "win-at-any-cost" spirit
prevalent in American football. It is still
a game where weight is at a premium
over agility : the combined average weight
on the Yale-Harvard teams last fall was
about iBq pounds, and the crack Exeter
school eleven averaged above 180. The
light and agile stars of the rugby same
whose clever work has delighted specta
tors during the past eight years, would
have but little chance to "make" a high
class college team.
Oi.n Brand Coaches Gone.
Again we find that the college game is
still a coach's game in the double sense
that it has been devised by coaches and
the actual movements of the players are
dictated by a coach. Rugby is a player's
game in the sense that it was developed
by players for the pleasure of players
who themselves initiate the tactics to meet
the situations of the game. This is what
is meant by the saying that in rugby the
player thinks for himself and in the col
lege game the coach thinks for him.
Which of these games is preferred by the
public, is a question which we presume
will be answered more according to tem
perament and custom than according to
reason, but which is more democratic in
spirit and more helpful in the develop
ment of character and in the qualities of
leadership in high school and college stu
dents are questions which so far as our
observation goes, are to be answered very
decisively in favor of the rugby game.
Stan ford Coach "Footrall Instructor."
The coach, so-called, at Stanford, is
elected as "instructor in football" and his
functions are mainly those of organizing
and instructing. At present his work is
chiefly with Freshmen. He confers with
the leading players on the status of the
teams, but the actual shaping of the play
during a game is left to the players, more
especially the captain. The Palo Alto high
school, which the New Zealand experts
pronounced Ihe best exponents of rugby
football coming under their observation
in this country, have for four years had
no coach. The popular belief that they
copied the Stanford players is incorrect:
the school devised its own system of prac
tice and worked out its own tactics ac
cording to Australian and New Zealand
models.
The argument that the college game is
American and the rugby English is, of
course, an appeal to prejudice that has
nothing to do with the merits of the
fame: no Particular demerit attaches it
self to handball, tennis, golf and intercol
legiate rowing because they are of British
origin.
"Farm" Wii.i. Stand Tat.
So far as we know the student body
feeling at Stanford is for rugby; if the
sentiments of the student body officials,
the president, vice-president and manager
I index the students are strongly for the
