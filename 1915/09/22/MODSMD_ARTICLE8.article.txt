# CONFERENCE VOTING TOMORROW
## Student Council to be Chosen at First Meeting to be Held Following Election 
### 
The election of Student Conference
members-at-large, which will be held
on the Quad tomorrow, is the first
to be conducted under the provisions
of the new amendment passed by the
Conference at its last meeting. Ac
cording to the newly passed amend
ment the five members of the Confer
ence chosen at large will hold office
for one year instead of two as was the
constitutional provision previously.
Owing to failure on Tuesday to
nominate the candidates-at-large,
nominations appear tonight in the col
umns of The Dally Palo Alto. The
polls will be open tomorrow on the
Quad both morning and afternoon and

it is hoped that a keen interest will
he shown in the election which has
thus far been hampered by a bad start.
Following the election, the Confer
ence, with its newly elected members,
will convene for the first, time tomor
row evening. Much of the internal
business of the Conference was post
potied at the last meeting until the
body might meet with the five new
additional members who are to be
chosen by the student body election
on the Quad tomorrow. The Student
Council for the coming year will lie
chosen at this meeting, the Confer
ence officers selected from the newly
assembled body, and numerous other
resolutions considered.
