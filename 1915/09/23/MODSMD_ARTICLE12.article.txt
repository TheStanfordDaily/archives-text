# Makes Preparations to Keep Santa Clara Rugby Game
## SEVENTEENERS MAY AWARD WHITE SWEATERS FOR INTERCLASS Financial Support in Form of Loan and Gift Extended to Stanford Band 
### 
Means of furthering interest among
alumni in the big game this year with
Santa Clara was the main topic of
discussion at the regular weekly meet
ing of the Executive Committee held
last night in the Union. As the result
of plans proposed a committee of
three consisting of J. It. Braden, '16,
W. P. Staniford, 'IG, and A. S. Hayes,
'10, was appointed to further work
of advertising the Big Game and to
advise on means suggested of stimu
lating enthusiasm at the big event on
November 13.
Fraternities to Help
All fraternities on the campus will
be asked by the Executive Committee
to send out letters to alumni, asking
for support in making this year's Big
Game the greatest ever and for sug
gestions for new bleacher stunts to
entertain fans at the annual contest.
Similar letters will be sent out by
Encina Hall, and it is planned to have
a series of bleacher stunts by alumni,
in addition to the regular features to
be carried out by the student body.
It was decided that because of the
close running of the four highest jun
ior candidates for the two positions
as assistant varsity yell leaders, it
would lie best to give the "fans" two
more chances to judge and express
their choice. The 'seventeeners still
in the running are L. W. McDermott,
W. Gilroy, .1. 1). McLachlan, and.1. P.
Mackel.
The class of 1917 was allowed its
I>reference in the matter of awarding
either white sweaters with red nu
merals or red sweaters with white
numerals, as has been generally the
custom heretofore, for the players in
the winning interclass rugby team.
After hearing the complete report
of the financial condition of the band,
it was decided to give outright to that
organization one hundred and fifty
dollars and to loan it one hundred
dollars more for a year without in
terest.
Party for Visitors.
Provision was made to stage a party
next Saturday, September 2.*, for the
li nefit of the Titan Club ruggers of
Oakland, and the players of the Palo
j Alto Athletic Club.
F. F. Walker, '18, and E. R. Martin,

i nuts and other refreshments at ath

Means of furthering interest among
alumni in the big game this year with
Santa Clara was the main topic of
discussion at the regular weekly meet
ing of the Executive Committee held
last night in the Union. As the result
of plans proposed a committee of
three consisting of J. It. Braden, '16,
W. P. Staniford, 'IG, and A. S. Hayes,
'10, was appointed to further work
of advertising the Big Game and to
advise on means suggested of stimu
lating enthusiasm at the big event on
November 13.
Fraternities to Help
All fraternities on the campus will
be asked by the Executive Committee
to send out letters to alumni, asking
for support in making this year's Big
Game the greatest ever and for sug
gestions for new bleacher stunts to
entertain fans at the annual contest.
Similar letters will be sent out by
Encina Hall, and it is planned to have
a series of bleacher stunts by alumni,
in addition to the regular features to
be carried out by the student body.
It was decided that because of the
close running of the four highest jun
ior candidates for the two positions
as assistant varsity yell leaders, it
would lie best to give the "fans" two
more chances to judge and express
their choice. The 'seventeeners still
in the running are L. W. McDermott,
W. Gilroy, .1. 1). McLachlan, and.1. P.
Mackel.
The class of 1917 was allowed its
I>reference in the matter of awarding
either white sweaters with red nu
merals or red sweaters with white
numerals, as has been generally the
custom heretofore, for the players in
the winning interclass rugby team.
After hearing the complete report
of the financial condition of the band,
it was decided to give outright to that
organization one hundred and fifty
dollars and to loan it one hundred
dollars more for a year without in
terest.
Party for Visitors.
Provision was made to stage a party
next Saturday, September 2.*, for the
li nefit of the Titan Club ruggers of
Oakland, and the players of the Palo
j Alto Athletic Club.
