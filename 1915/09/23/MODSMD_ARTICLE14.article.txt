# The 						Vicious Ego
## 
### 
Ours hasn't been a code of courage,
but one of savage bigotry.
Since the beginning of undergraduate
history at Stanford, free-for-alls
among the classes have fed and fat
tened on a crude spark of pugnacity
that lurks in all of us. Some mem
bers ot' the community have jumped
into the brawls with a grin and a yell.
Others have followed them through
fear of ridicule and contempt. And
out of such a code has developed the
ghastly spectre called "yellow streak,"
which every man fears.
Only one form of our traditional in
terclass strife has justified itself. That
solitary one is the annual freshman
sophomore tieup, fought in the light
of day, and subject to rigid censorship.
Other orgies of the night, which draw
devotees of truth into frenzies of con
flict, should be cursed, condemned, and
destroyed.
Such a denunciation hits the Plug-
Ugly, in all its forms and stages.
There is no sentiment of tradition that
can glorify vicious practice. With the
Plug-Ugly rush should go its prelude,
the junior poster fight. The rites of
the junior-senior mix. have during the
years, ruined physical manhood. And
who can say that a scrap of printed
doggerel, or the mad joy of conflict
can stand the gaff?
With the rest of the grand scheme
of misplaced energy and manliness
must go the impromptu fights between
underclassmen, preliminary to the
formal rush. They lie at the bottom
of a rotten blindness, and diseased
mentality.
All men respond to the pulse of
combat. We can't dispense with the
combative germ. We do not want to,
in fact, but we want to build appro
priate methods for expression of that
rivalry. Don't tear all the plush lin
ing out of our vaunted culture.
Early today conjecture tended to at
tribute the death of E. S. Puller, '19,
to the iire-poster laying struggle be
tween underclassmen on September 1.
Now we know the tragedy followed a
natural illness. The fact remains that
"it might have been," which is after
all a very real cause for reform.
Spurious lights should be taboo. Class
spirit needs a new nurse.
