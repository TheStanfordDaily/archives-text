# California Frosh Defeat St. Mary's
## 
### 
Playing a fast game, featured by
open work formations and forward
passes, the University of California
freshmen defeated the varsity team of
St. Mary's yesterday afternoon by a
6 to 0 score. The game was consid
ered to be one of the best played on
the Berkeley field this year. St. Mary's
outclassed the babes in defensive play,
and Moy and Fitzpatrick were a com
bination that proved a puzzler to the
California tackles. The freshmen
were in the game all the time when
it came to offensive play, Sappington,
an American player from the east,
Moses and Shea being the particular
stars.
