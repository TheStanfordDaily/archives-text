Word comes from the University of
California that rugby football may be
reduced in the ranks to that of a minor
sport. There is a large number of
men at the university who would play
rugby if they were given the oppor

ican football would not participate in
rugby, tliere are many others who have
been dropped from the American
squad who would form the nucleus
of a rugby team. The putting of such
a team in the tield is not considered
detriment.nl to the advancement, of the
