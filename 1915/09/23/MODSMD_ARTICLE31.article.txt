# ANDERSONS AHEAD IN NEW BAWL-OUT RACE
## Show Lead of One Name Over Browns, Who Number 11 in Fall Directory 
### 
The first man in college this semes
ter is an Adams and her first name is
Agnes. Adams, Agnes Irene, Coalinga,
History, US Ruble, is how it appears in
the bawl-out, the first proof sheets of
which were posted in front of the
Registrar's office today. An Adams,
too, can claim second honors in the
semi-annual directory. As a matter
of fact, seven Adamses start the list of
close to two thousand names which
will comprise the bawl-out this se
mester. Of course the last name in
the final arrangement will be Zenobia,
Zanzibar, or Yreka, but at present it's
merely Cecil, Harlan Edward, a pre
legal major, a member of Encina Club,
and the modest community of .Modesto.
The Anderson's, however, jumped
the gun in the annual race for bawl
out popularity, starting off leading the
Browns by one name. Twelve Browns,
eleven Andersons, and seven Adamses
are the handicaps that the Clarks,
and Smiths will have to overcome to
win the semi-annual tournament in
nomenclature.
