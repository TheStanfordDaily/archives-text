# SKIN SHOWS 'EM
## That When It Comes to Guiding Guests About the Campus He Ranks With the Top-Notchers 
### 
Paul R. Wilson may be an excel
lent student body president, but as an
ollicial guide for celebrities who visit
the campus he more resembles a
freshman in a sorority house on bis
first offense. The blow that stunned
Father occurred yesterday
Father White of Santa Clara, who |
was a welcome visitor in the after- j
noon, desired to see a few of the sights :
previous to departure. Hence Skin
in chief command, with a couple of
extras, performed the spieler act.
After giving the Library a most
hasty once-over Wilson rushed the
party over to the Memorial church
Now, here is where the elongated guide
lowered his average pitifully. To
speak plainly, he booted every chance.
Pointing his thumb toward a white
bowl set on a pedestal, Skin casually
remarked: "That's a funny place for
a wash basin."
"My dear fellow," mocked Father,
"that's where the baptizing ceremony
takes place."
An amazed "Oh!" was emitted by
Wilson. A second later trying to pass
it off, Paul again spoke words of wis
dom. "Say, isn't that the darndest
place for a stepladder," again wagging
his long thumb.
"Old man, ws used to call those pul
pits in our day," once more came out
mockingly.
"That one across there is the as
sistant pulpit then," Wilson eagerly.
The scene changes to the Museum.
Once inside, our ambitious prexy let
out this infantile gush of words:
"Say, Father, let's ldolc at the stiffs.
They're great."
Hut they couldn't find any. To
speak plainly again. Skin showed ab
solutely nothing.
Finally, when the war was over, and
some unusual regr. ts. thank yous, and
good-byes had been cast forth, Father
White, showing a Hit of teeth, quaintly
remarked: "My boy, I'd be pleased
to show you the campus when I'm
down this way again."
Wilson now boasts he has seen the
Memorial church and the Museum
from the inside.
