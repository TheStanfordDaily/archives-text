### 
Evelyn Schyler Fuller, '19, regis
tered from Washington, D. C., in the
Economics department, passed away
last night at the home of Congressman
E. A. Hayes near San Jose after an
extended illness which began shortly
after Fuller arrived on the cam
pus. The immediate cause of death
was a burster! appendix.

friends as Lynn, was eighteen years
of age. He is the son of F. J. D. Fuller,
an architect at the national capital,
and is said to be a nephew of Former

ond at Washington, besides his

was not in condition to be initiated
the ceremonies were nostponed until

that Fuller did not receive any blows
or injuri a in the lights or rushes that

nl consequent death. Dr. Robert

j F'liller, said this afternon that the in
. tinal troubles which finally led to
' a bursted appendix were of long
j .nwth ard could not have resulted
| from a blow received in the scrim
mage. According to Dr. Reynolds and
; several of Fuller's friends, the de
