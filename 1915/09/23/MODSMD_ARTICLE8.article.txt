# Executive Committee Ma Up Interest of Alumni in
## CALIFORNIA REJECTS FOOTBALL COMPARISON 
### 
The University of California's Ex
ecutive Committee announced last
night that they could not consider
Stanford's proposal to play an exhibi
tion game of American football in
conjunction with Stanford's exhibition
of rugby.
Last week Stanford sent California
an invitation to play their next game
of American football against the Olym
pic Club at the Exposition grounds,
offaring in turn to play the Olympic
ruggers the following week. In this
way it was thought that the public
could get a very clear idea of the rela
tive merits of the two games, but after
due consideration California has de
cided not to give the public this op
portunity.
The argument put forth by Graduate
Manager Stroud is that the issue lays
in the freshman eligibility ruling and
not in the type of game played, and
that the proposed games would not
simplify matters at all. He also ob
jects to the exhibition on the grounds
that the test would not be a fair one
since Stanford's rugby machine is
well oiled and running smoothly while
California's is up against practically a
new game.
