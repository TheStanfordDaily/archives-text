# POLICY OF NEW STUDENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE EXPLAINED
## PROFESSOR FOLSOM SPEAKS Council Members Now Miller, Noonan, Jacomini, Rehm and Stanford 
### 
The policy of the Faculty Committee
on Student Affairs, the personnel of
which is changed this fall, was out
lined and suggestions to the student
body government made last night by
Professor 1). M. Folsom, in a talk
before the regular weekly gathering
of the Student Conference.
Professor Folsom said: "The Trus
tees still hold the Faculty Committee
on Student Affairs responsible for
student government and this commit
tee has delegated its power to the
Student Conference. I will not state
the policy of the present committee,
but will say that it does not belive in
government by rule. The Conference
may wipe out rulings of past faculty
committees as long as it sticks to
three rules which the present com
mittee upholds. The first of these
which prohibit the bringing of liquor
on the campus and forbid disorderly
conduct, are considered as of major
importance by the committee. The
third, the hazing rule, is of minor im
portance but must be enforced by the
Conference.
"Those to whom student govern
ment is responsible are not satisfied
with its success to date. There have
been many members on the Faculty
Committee in the pa st who have dis
approved of student self-government.
The present committee feels that the
weakest point in that government at
present is the lack of a strong execu
tive and believes that the Conference
should take over the executive author
ity. This is my chief advice.
"Many suggestions have been made
by those in the faculty. One of these
is that a paid proctor find and report
cases to the Council. Another is that
a faculty member sit with the Con
ference to make suggestions, but not
to vote.
"The work of the Conference should
be chiefly one of prevention rather
than discipline. Where cases demand,
the heads of fraternities should be
made responsible to the student gov
ernment.
"The older heads among the stu
dents should see that no such dis
turbance as occurred among upper
classmen this fall should ever be per
mitted.'
Election decided that the five mem
bers of the Student Council should be:
C. M. Miller, '14, VV. F. Noonan, '16,
G. A. Jacomini, '15, F. E. Rehra, '15,
and W. P. Staniford, '16. The presi
dent of the Conference chosen is C. M.
Miller, and secretary, G. C. Collins, '17.
It was resolved that VV. H. Stammer,
'14, and J. H. Goodman, '16, who are
representatives-at-large holding office
from last year according to the recent
correct interpretation of the constitu
tion, and H. L. Loud, '14, and A. S.
Flack, '15, who tied for representative
from the Law department, he permit
ted to take seats in the Conference.
VV. G. Paul, '15, was also a member
at-large elected for two years, but
action was unnecessary in his case
as he was elected this fall to repre
sent the Law department for a two
year term.

The present committee feels that the
weakest point in that government at
present is the lack of a strong execu
tive and believes that the Conference
should take over the executive author
ity. This is my chief advice.
"Many suggestions have been made
by those in the faculty. One of these
is that a paid proctor find and report
cases to the Council. Another is that
a faculty member sit with the Con
ference to make suggestions, but not
to vote.
"The work of the Conference should
be chiefly one of prevention rather
than discipline. Where cases demand,
the heads of fraternities should be
made responsible to the student gov
ernment.
"The older heads among the stu
dents should see that no such dis
turbance as occurred among upper
classmen this fall should ever be per
mitted.'
Election decided that the five mem
bers of the Student Council should be:
C. M. Miller, '14, VV. F. Noonan, '16,
G. A. Jacomini, '15, F. E. Rehra, '15,
and W. P. Staniford, '16. The presi
dent of the Conference chosen is C. M.
Miller, and secretary, G. C. Collins, '17.
It was resolved that VV. H. Stammer,
'14, and J. H. Goodman, '16, who are
representatives-at-large holding office
from last year according to the recent
correct interpretation of the constitu
tion, and H. L. Loud, '14, and A. S.
Flack, '15, who tied for representative
from the Law department, he permit
ted to take seats in the Conference.
VV. G. Paul, '15, was also a member
at-large elected for two years, but
action was unnecessary in his case
as he was elected this fall to repre
sent the Law department for a two
year term.
The policy of the Faculty Committee
on Student Affairs, the personnel of
which is changed this fall, was out
lined and suggestions to the student
body government made last night by
Professor 1). M. Folsom, in a talk
before the regular weekly gathering
of the Student Conference.
Professor Folsom said: "The Trus
tees still hold the Faculty Committee
on Student Affairs responsible for
student government and this commit
tee has delegated its power to the
Student Conference. I will not state
the policy of the present committee,
but will say that it does not belive in
government by rule. The Conference
may wipe out rulings of past faculty
committees as long as it sticks to
three rules which the present com
mittee upholds. The first of these
which prohibit the bringing of liquor
on the campus and forbid disorderly
conduct, are considered as of major
importance by the committee. The
third, the hazing rule, is of minor im
portance but must be enforced by the
Conference.
"Those to whom student govern
ment is responsible are not satisfied
with its success to date. There have
been many members on the Faculty
Committee in the pa st who have dis
approved of student self-government.
