The first fellow who ever undertook
to write a rule book for people who
want to be fetched up in the bonds of
etiquette had no trouble at all. No
precedent to worry about, no "heart
and home" column to tell him an oys
ter fork was a pie knife, when he
would have mankind believe it was an
almond dish.
All of those easy preliminaries were
attended to away back in Ben Jon
son's time though, and one who would
harmonize the elements today must
proceed with caution. Listen to this,
and see if it isn't trite, and hashed
over:
Start to class some morning with
your courses all prepared, so that you
are serene and happy, and speak tc
everybody you see on the Quad. Ex
cept your enemies of course. But to
ward everyone else, show the kindli
est feeling in the world. Not patron
izing, but downright gracious, anc
convivial, and enthusiastic. Pile it or
a bit. thick if necessary.
By the time you have spent all
morning under pressure, being jovial
and nice, go 011 home to lunch, because
you have earned it. And when you
hear a nineteener or some one else
answer somebody on the 'phone in an
insulted tone call him for it.
Then go down to the post office for
the 1:30 mail, and be sure you don't
stand up close to the boxes so nobody
behind you can see what's going on.
And when a professor conies in bow
to him, and duke him if you want to,
though it's not necessary. When you
start home with your friends don't
monopolize the sidewalk.
After dinner, study hard, and then
be sure you turn the light out, and
go to bed.
That stuff is all balled up, and it is
common, and ordinary, and doesn't get
past at all. So we'll devote more time
to hard study before we try the lesson
on manners.
