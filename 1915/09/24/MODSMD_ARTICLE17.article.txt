# Hamilton Memorial Library is Given to The Daily Palo Alto
## 
### 
Foundation of a new and permanent
library at Stanford will be made in
the course of the next week or two by
Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Hamilton of
Long Beach. Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton
are the parents of Frederick C. Ham
ilton, recent editor of The Daily Palo
Alto, who passed away at the Penin
sula Hospital a month after being
graduated with the 1915 class. The
new reference library will be known
as the Frederick C. Hamilton Memo
rial Library, and will be for use of
The Daily Palo Alto.
The plan of the founder is to estab
lish a permanent fund, the income
from which will be turned over each
year to the editor of The Daily Palo
Alto to add to the memorial library in
whatever way he considers fitting.
The initial endowment this year will
be used to secure a cabinet for books
and files, a metal plate cabinet, book
plates, files, a large dictionary and
a Who's Who. The addition of a num
ber of books each year will mean that
The Daily Palo Alto will build up an
extensive reference library.
Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton decided that
the library should be for the use of
The Daily Palo Alto, which was the
main activity of their son while at
Stanford. Their aim in establishing
the library is to aid other students
who are interested in the same work
as that in which their son spent what
proved to be the most fruitful years
of his life.
Frederick C. Hamilton was editor of
The Daily Palo Alto from January to
May of this year. He was active in
many other student affairs at Stanford,
being president of the Y. M. C. A.,
class historian, a member of Encina
Club, Quadrangle Club, Press Club,
