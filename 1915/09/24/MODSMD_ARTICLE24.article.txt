# CREW AID UNEXPECTED
## Former California Football Captain Sends Money 
### 
The Stanford crew fund has re
ceived ten dollars from Wolff Ran
some, a famous University of Cali
fornia football player and captain in
the early days, sent through Jackson
E. Reynolds, '9G, a Stanford player of
the same time, who is now general
attorney for the Jersey Central Rail
way of New York. Ransome is an
officer of the Ransome Concrete Ma
chinery Company of New Jersey.
Ransome sent his check to Rey
nolds at the same time the newspapers
had stories of the financial difficulty
of the Stanford crew, and Reynolds
sent it to an alumnus on the Pacific
Coast, from whom it has recently come
into Crew Captain Orme's hands.
Ransome's letter to Reynolds and
Reynold's letter of transmission are
interesting in connection with the
present athletic spirit between the two
universities. They are as follows:
"My Dear Jack:
I am enclosing a check for $10.00
as a contribution toward the ex
pense of maintaining the Stan
ford Crew 011 the Hudson. While
I am not a Stanford man, I realize
that Stanford teams have always
needed a lot of assistance, and I
suppose this one is no exception
to the rule. They may need a
tug boat; but here's hoping that
this small contribution will do
the trick.
With kindest regards, I remain,
Yours very truly,
(Signed) A. W. RANSOME."
Reynold's letter of explanation, sent
to Chick Orme with Ransoine's check,
follows:
"I enclose herewith a self-ex
planatory letter from Wolff Ran
some and his enclosed check for
$10.00, which I wish to turn over
to the custodians of the fund col
lected for sending the Stanford
Crew to the Hudson River this
year.
Wolff Ransome was captain of
the University of California foot
ball team at the latter end of my
active days on the Stanford foot
ball team. His contribution was
entirely unsolicited and indicates
pretty well the spirit of the old
days when we used to fight each
other like the devil on the football
field and renew old acquaintance
afterwards.
Yours sincerely,
(Signed) JACK REYNOLDS, '96."
Those were the good old days.
