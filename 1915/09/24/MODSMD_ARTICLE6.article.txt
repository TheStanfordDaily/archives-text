# VARSITY VS. TITANS IN TOMORROW'S BIG CONTEST
## FRESHMEN MEET OAKLAND First Team to Appear With Practically New Lineup in Backfield 
### 
Stanford varsity will meet the Ti
tans for tomorrow's big game on the
turf, the clash being scheduled for
three o'clock in the afternoon. The
freshmen will open hostilities in the
afternoon with a charge at the squad
sent down by the Oakland Technical
School, while the day's series of turf
specialties will be brought to a close
with a contest between the second
varsity fifteen and the Palo Alto Ath
letic Club.
Hnckfielri Shifted.
Several changes in the varsity line
up will greet fans as the main squad
trots out on the field. Rehm has been
restored to middle rank. Frank
Walker will be switched to his former
place at half back, and Art Erb will
return to fullback's position. Ric
Templeton has reported to duty, but
will serve as substitute at fullback.
With Townsend at first five, and E.
Bacon at center, it means practically
a new backfield line-up with the ex
ception of Captain Carroll. A new
line of substitutes will grace the bench
at the same time, Adams, Hanimon,
Jacomini, and Smitherum.
Titans Are Strong.
In last year's preliminary series the
Titans were strong opponents for the
first and second varsity squads here,
and the fact that the club boasts many
former Berkeley and California play
ers in its ranks promises that the con
test tomorrow will be one of veterans.
Oakland Technical School will send
down Jimmie Thoburn's squad of hus
kies to show the freshmen how to play
rugby as it was played in the good old
days when the ex-captain led the Car
dinals against Australian invaders.
What the Palo Alto Athletic Club can
do will depend on how hard the var
sity grudged the 8 to 6 loss to the blue
jerseys one week ago on the turf.
The feature of the morning will be
the game between the picked fifteen
from Bill Fletcher's squad and the
third varsity.
