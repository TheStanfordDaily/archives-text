the affairs of their department in a
more satisfactory manner. A meeting
was called at 1:*i0 this afternoon to
discuss the advisability of taking some
such action, and the plan meeting with
unanimous approval was adopted im

C. M. Miller, '14, read a tentative
constitution which had been prepared
to give the students an idea of the
nature of the plan, and this was ac
cepted without a dissenting vote. The
support of student control and the per
petuation of the honor system in the
Law department are two of the things
in which the association will lie vitally
interested.

treasurer, of the organization.
Professor P. C. Woodward, who pre

and a short business meeting was held,
at which committees were appointed
to arrange for the annual law smoker
and to draw up the constitution in
permanent form. An assessment of
fifty cents was levied for the smoker.
