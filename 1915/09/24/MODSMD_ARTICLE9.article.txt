# Garnet Holme Players In Shakespeare Tonight
## Well known Theatrical Company to Present Taming of the Shrew 
### 
"The Taming of the Shrew" as pre
sented by the Garnet Holme players
of San Francisco, will hold the boards
of the Assembly Hall this evening.
Although these players form an organ
ization similar to the Ben Greet
Shakespearean company, the scenery
used in tonight's production will not
be strictly Eliabethan as is the case
with the Greet company. Three sets
of scenery will be used for the pro
duction.
The Garnet Holme company have re
cently been identified with out-of-door
productions, having acted in the Muir
Woods and Redwood Canyon theatres.
The production of Rip Van Winkle,
which was given this summer on Mt.
Tamalpais was enacted by these
players.
