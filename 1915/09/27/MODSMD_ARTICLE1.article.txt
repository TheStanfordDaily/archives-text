# CARDINAL ROUTS TITANS IN SATURDAY'S HEADLINER
## NINETEENERS BEAT OAKLAND Freshmen Display Near-Varsity Form—---All-Blacks Give P. A.A.C. Third Game 
### 
The completion of Saturday after
noon's rugby calendar marked the at
tainment of two more scalps on the
Stanford belt of victories and also one
defeat. Two features of the day's play
that stood out foremost to Cardinal
fans were the new experimental line
shift in the varsity line-up and the ex
cellent showing made by the first year
aggregation.
It is apparent from the Titan-varsity
game, that at present not more than
one or two positions on the varsity
have in any manner been definitely as
signed to any one player. In the back
field this condition is characteristic.
Erb, Carroll, and Urban were all given
try-outs in unfamiliar positions. The
scrum showed few changes, however,
Petti ngill and Soper both being ab
sent from the pack formation.
The curtain-raiser, between the
freshmen and the Oakland Technical
high school, without throwing any
undue bouquets, was a revelation to
followers of Stanford football pros
pects. Both team combination and a
finger count of stars were brought to
light in a most pleasing way. This
contest, was from the spectator's view
point the most entertaining of the
afternoon.
Fast work on the part of the Titan
forwards rendered the first few min
utes' play of the main attraction an
even break. Halsted set the ball
arolling, however, when following
Templaton's attempt at penalty goal,
he gathered in the ball from the fast
asleep Titans and touched down for
the initial try. Templeton converted.
This was the only score of the half
featured by loose and open rugby.
The second period proved more
fruitful as regards compilation of
points. Shortly after the kick-off the
ball was brought well down into Tita
territory. Here Carroll procured and
snapped to Urban who perfomed one
of his usual sideline dashes for an
other score, which went unconverted.
A mid-season passing rush initiated
by Erb and handled by Walker, Urban
and finally Carroll, resulted in the
latter's try. Templeton added two
more points to Stanford's total. The
final consisted of Urban's thirty-yard
zig-zag spurt across the line for a
clever try. Conversion by Templeton
let' the count at 18 to 0.
Fast Opening' Gtiiue.
The manner in which the freshmen
handled themselves in the opener with
the Oakland Technical scool left every
body in good umor. Boydston, Long,
and Davis among the backs, and
Winham, Boulware, and Flugel among
the forwards measured up to all re
quirements.
The first two Lrys fell to Long. He
dribbled across from a ten-yard line
out and covered. In the second in
stance he received from Boydston after
the latter's long run, and registered.
Both scores went unconverted. The
next points were hung up by Davis
who encircled the scrum from a ruck
on the fifteen yard line. Winham con
verted. The fourth try followed the
best passing rush of the afternoon.
The pigskin was transferred for fifty
yards from Davis to Katten to Morris
to Davis to Long, who finally ended up
across the line. Failure to place be
tween the goal posts left the score at
14 to 0.

When darkness was settling on the
field late in the afternoon, the second
varsity found themselves pretty badly
beaten by the nearby club players
from Palo Alto. Eighteen to six was

the score. Stolz and Risling each
counted twice for the visitors, while
Cashel and Card went over once
apiece. None of the tries were con
verted. The half dozen points piled
up by Stanford were the result of a
successful penalty kick by West, and a
try by Murray.

The completion of Saturday after
noon's rugby calendar marked the at
tainment of two more scalps on the
Stanford belt of victories and also one
defeat. Two features of the day's play
that stood out foremost to Cardinal
fans were the new experimental line
shift in the varsity line-up and the ex
cellent showing made by the first year
aggregation.
It is apparent from the Titan-varsity
game, that at present not more than
one or two positions on the varsity
have in any manner been definitely as
signed to any one player. In the back
field this condition is characteristic.
Erb, Carroll, and Urban were all given
try-outs in unfamiliar positions. The
scrum showed few changes, however,
Petti ngill and Soper both being ab
sent from the pack formation.
The curtain-raiser, between the
freshmen and the Oakland Technical
high school, without throwing any
undue bouquets, was a revelation to
followers of Stanford football pros
pects. Both team combination and a
finger count of stars were brought to
light in a most pleasing way. This
contest, was from the spectator's view
point the most entertaining of the
afternoon.
Fast work on the part of the Titan
forwards rendered the first few min
utes' play of the main attraction an
even break. Halsted set the ball
arolling, however, when following
Templaton's attempt at penalty goal,
he gathered in the ball from the fast
asleep Titans and touched down for
the initial try. Templeton converted.
This was the only score of the half
featured by loose and open rugby.
The second period proved more
fruitful as regards compilation of
points. Shortly after the kick-off the
ball was brought well down into Tita
territory. Here Carroll procured and
snapped to Urban who perfomed one
of his usual sideline dashes for an
other score, which went unconverted.
A mid-season passing rush initiated
by Erb and handled by Walker, Urban
and finally Carroll, resulted in the
latter's try. Templeton added two
more points to Stanford's total. The
final consisted of Urban's thirty-yard
zig-zag spurt across the line for a
clever try. Conversion by Templeton
let' the count at 18 to 0.
Fast Opening' Gtiiue.
The manner in which the freshmen
handled themselves in the opener with
the Oakland Technical scool left every
body in good umor. Boydston, Long,
and Davis among the backs, and
Winham, Boulware, and Flugel among
the forwards measured up to all re
quirements.
The first two Lrys fell to Long. He
dribbled across from a ten-yard line
out and covered. In the second in
stance he received from Boydston after
the latter's long run, and registered.
Both scores went unconverted. The
next points were hung up by Davis
who encircled the scrum from a ruck
on the fifteen yard line. Winham con
verted. The fourth try followed the
best passing rush of the afternoon.
The pigskin was transferred for fifty
yards from Davis to Katten to Morris
to Davis to Long, who finally ended up
across the line. Failure to place be
tween the goal posts left the score at
14 to 0.

When darkness was settling on the
field late in the afternoon, the second
varsity found themselves pretty badly
beaten by the nearby club players
from Palo Alto. Eighteen to six was

the score. Stolz and Risling each
counted twice for the visitors, while
Cashel and Card went over once
apiece. None of the tries were con
verted. The half dozen points piled
up by Stanford were the result of a
successful penalty kick by West, and a
try by Murray.

verted. The half dozen points piled
up by Stanford were the result of a
successful penalty kick by West, and a
try by Murray.

The completion of Saturday after
noon's rugby calendar marked the at
tainment of two more scalps on the
Stanford belt of victories and also one
defeat. Two features of the day's play
that stood out foremost to Cardinal
fans were the new experimental line
shift in the varsity line-up and the ex
cellent showing made by the first year
aggregation.
It is apparent from the Titan-varsity
game, that at present not more than
one or two positions on the varsity
have in any manner been definitely as
signed to any one player. In the back
field this condition is characteristic.
Erb, Carroll, and Urban were all given
try-outs in unfamiliar positions. The
scrum showed few changes, however,
Petti ngill and Soper both being ab
sent from the pack formation.
The curtain-raiser, between the
freshmen and the Oakland Technical
high school, without throwing any
undue bouquets, was a revelation to
followers of Stanford football pros
pects. Both team combination and a
finger count of stars were brought to
light in a most pleasing way. This
contest, was from the spectator's view
point the most entertaining of the
afternoon.
Fast work on the part of the Titan
forwards rendered the first few min
utes' play of the main attraction an
even break. Halsted set the ball
arolling, however, when following
Templaton's attempt at penalty goal,
he gathered in the ball from the fast
asleep Titans and touched down for
the initial try. Templeton converted.
This was the only score of the half
featured by loose and open rugby.
The second period proved more
fruitful as regards compilation of
points. Shortly after the kick-off the
ball was brought well down into Tita
territory. Here Carroll procured and
snapped to Urban who perfomed one
of his usual sideline dashes for an
other score, which went unconverted.
A mid-season passing rush initiated
by Erb and handled by Walker, Urban
and finally Carroll, resulted in the
latter's try. Templeton added two
more points to Stanford's total. The
final consisted of Urban's thirty-yard
zig-zag spurt across the line for a
clever try. Conversion by Templeton
let' the count at 18 to 0.
Fast Opening' Gtiiue.
The manner in which the freshmen
handled themselves in the opener with
the Oakland Technical scool left every
body in good umor. Boydston, Long,
and Davis among the backs, and
Winham, Boulware, and Flugel among
the forwards measured up to all re
quirements.
The first two Lrys fell to Long. He
dribbled across from a ten-yard line
out and covered. In the second in
stance he received from Boydston after
the latter's long run, and registered.
Both scores went unconverted. The
next points were hung up by Davis
who encircled the scrum from a ruck
on the fifteen yard line. Winham con
verted. The fourth try followed the
best passing rush of the afternoon.
The pigskin was transferred for fifty
yards from Davis to Katten to Morris
to Davis to Long, who finally ended up
across the line. Failure to place be
tween the goal posts left the score at
14 to 0.

When darkness was settling on the
field late in the afternoon, the second
varsity found themselves pretty badly
beaten by the nearby club players
from Palo Alto. Eighteen to six was

the score. Stolz and Risling each
counted twice for the visitors, while
Cashel and Card went over once
apiece. None of the tries were con
verted. The half dozen points piled
up by Stanford were the result of a
successful penalty kick by West, and a
try by Murray.
