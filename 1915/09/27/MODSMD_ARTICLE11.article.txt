# OLYMPIC SOCCERITES DOWN STANFORD TEAM
## 
### 
Pacing a heavy wind which died
down at half-time, Stanford's soccer
eleven took the short end of a 4 to 1
score in its contest with the Olympic
Club Saturday afternoon on the Ocean
Shore grounds, San Francisco. Lack
of organization among the forwards,
only two of whom had played for
Stanford before, was another cause
for Stanford's loss. Loose play and a
paucity of combination work marked
the work of the forward division as a
whole.
Dutton at fullback and Ford, a
transfer from the University of Ore
gon. in a forward berth did excellent
individual work. Rlodget scored
Stanford's lone try just before the end
of the first half, evading fullbacks
and goal keeper by neat footwork.
Lydon and Gloor.in the first half, and
Anderson and .lackson in the second
period registered goals for the strong
Olympic team.
In the first half the ball was in Stan
ford territory ninety per c?nt of the
time, but in the latter portion of the
game Stanford kept the ball in the
neighborhood of the Olympic goal but
failed to score owing to lack of coop
eration in the forward ranks.
Following is the Stanford line-up in
the Olympic Club game Saturday:
McMahon, Kester, Blodget, Reynolds,
Ford, forwards; McClung. Boyle, Al
derton, halfbacks; Endersbv Dutton,
fullbacks; Ring, coal.
