Announcement of sophomore play
tryouts always brings the happy as
surance that we are going to see some
brand new adventurers on the Assem
bly Hall boards. That is a bit com
forting all by itself. But the local
public doesn't want to be indulgent.
It wants to be forced to admit that
new lustre has been added to the dra
matic firmament. So if the harvest
isn't rich at the preliminary tryout
today, we hope the coaching commit
tee will advertise for more recruits,
and look them over carefully.
