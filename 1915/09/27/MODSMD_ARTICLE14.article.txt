More damage has been done by peo

heads, than you can well imagine.
Now take the case of the four students
who tried to get through the gate on
someone else's season tickets last
Saturday. If all the campus grew
rabid, and hounded them, and called
them crooks, the worst kind of injus
tice might be done.
Think straight before you condemn
those four people, because they may
be as square as you are. Perhaps,
just before they started over to the
field, somebody changed tickets on
them in fun. Or maybe they thought
the tickets were transferable. You
can't tell. A whole bunch of our lea
guers around here seem to have the
same idea.
Perish the thought, but if the partic
ular parties in question knew they
were fudging, and really intended to
feed their pocketbooks off of their self
respect, the defense becomes pretty
weak. And besides, their pocketbooks
must be in sore need of nourishment.
People who would do a trick like that
are poor citizens, and we don't want
much to do with them. The lenders
of the tickets have some pretty tall
explaining to do, also.
