Dearest Ma.—A big accident hap
pened here the other day. The new
swimming hole was opened at last.
Nobody knows just who did it. Just
think, ma, of the poor gent who has
been using bis Sat. nights for the mov
ies for the past two weeks instead of
—you know what, Satur. night is re
served for. But that ain't me, I assure
you; so rest assured. There was a
grand rush for the perfumed Sears
vine. Perfumed Searsville, ma, is like
dish water with the soap wrung out.
Ordinary S'sville smells like you know
what and tastes 79 times worse.
There's tar soap in it, ma, and mix
vomica, which 1 never tasted, but
which sounds bad enough to be de
leted by the censor.
The Searsville water, ma, comes
from a well up near an old cemetery.
But it's specially prepared for internal
use before being ushered into the new
tank. The water passes through a
turkish towel, which divides it (the
water) into its respective parts, i.e.,
hydrogen, oxygen, and germs. Then
electric fans get into action and waft
attar of roses across the path of the
water. The germs are completely car
ried away by this. The heavy breeze
divides the remaining water into atoms
and mollycules. Seems to me atoms
ought to be sprayed through an ato
mizer but that's somebody else's busi
ness. After this the water is carried
to a sentiment tank which collects
bugs and a tax to help pay for the pool.
So you see, ma, there is no reason un
der the sun why you should object
to my swimming up here. Come and
see for yourself.
YOUR LOVING SONNY.
