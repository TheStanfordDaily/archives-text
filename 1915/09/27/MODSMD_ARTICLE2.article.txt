# MYSTERIOUS CULT HAS PHENOMENAL GROWTH
## Theta Xi Starts Organization at Californiaâ€”Spreads to the "Farm" 
### 
An organization of doubtful origin
and probably still more dubious char
acter is, through the efforts of enthu
siastic, energetic and possibly greedy
proselyting, spreading speedily over
the campus. Curiosity and "kale"
seem to be the requisites for initia
tion into (he secrets of its occult phi
losophy or shady history. Evidently
many possess both in sufficient quan
tities because the number of initiates
is fast growing. A week ago last night
there were just three members of the
body on the campus. Now the num
ber is near three hundred.
On September 19, a Theta Xi from
Ames, who says that the organization
has spread throughout the universities
of the East, introduced it at California,
on that date initiating thirty members
of Theta Xi. Its growth at the state
institution has been phenomenal,
where it is claimed that there are now
three thousand members. On that
that same evening three of the before
mentioned Theta Xi's came to the
"Farm." By Thursday, the entire
house had joined. 1U- Saturday night
there were fifty members at Stanford.
Tt is claimed that the number now ap
proaches three hundred.
