# MALONE NOT TO SPEAK
## J.C. Ray, '07, Will Give Address in Place of Army Man 
### 
Although Captain Paul B. Malone,
Second Infantry, U. S. A., did not re
ceive permission of the War depart
ment to address an audience in the
Stanford Union tomorrow evening, the
benefit of the address will not be lost,
since J. C. Ray, '07, has been prevailed
upon to mount the platform in Captain
Malone's stead.
For the past summer Ray has at
tended the business men's training
camp at the Presidio, San Francisco,
and upon graduation received an ex
cellent recommendation for a commis
sion in the volunteer service. He is a
close friend of Captain Malone and
both by association and because of at
tending lectures delivered at the train
ing camp has an intimate knowledge
of the subject matter which formed
the content of Captain Malone's pro
posed talk.
All preparations which will insure
the success of the evening are now
complete. The Stanford Band will be
present as a feature of the program.
Seats within the Union for the faculty
members", their wives, and all women
of the university will be provided. The
talk will commence at 7:30, and will
be followed by light refreshments to
all while the men will enjoy the added
pleasure of smokes with their "eats."
Although not permitted by the War
department to speak, Captain Malone
will be present as an interested
visitor.
