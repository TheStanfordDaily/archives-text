# High Finance Arrives
## Sophomore Treasurer Will Wield His Power at Class Play Tryouts 
### 
Sophomore dramatists, playwrights,
or what you will, believe that a bird
in the hand gathers no moss. Those
in charge of the class play, "Bobby
Burnit," are going to be sure that at
least, a few spondulics come sailing
into class coffers before the last day
of the college year. They are going
to establish a customs house at the
Cardinal Club where tryouts for parts
in "Bobby Burnit" will be held tomor
row afternoon. They are going to in
sist that sophomores do their duty and
pay their dues before entering the por
tals that lead to fame, perhaps.
The class treasurer will be on hand
to perform the delicate operation. It
might be safely called a vaccination
of the pocketbook, inasmuch as the
receipt will be an anti-toxin against
further financial attacks. Tryoutees
today were taxed ten jitneys, and try
outees tomorrow will be taxed ten
jitneys. Nineteen eighteen's treasurer
is a genius.
