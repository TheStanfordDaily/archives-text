# More Benefits Will Be Derived from Guild Fee
## Change in Policy insures Hospital Service at Much Reduced Cost 
### 
Managers of the Stanford Guild
fund, to which each student is re
quired to contribute $2 each semester,
announce that in the future the Guild
will increase the privileges to stu
dents who are so unfortunate as to
require medical attention during the
college year. In the past the Guild
has merely paid all hospital bills at
the Peninsula Hospital in excess of
$1 per day, leaving all doctor and med
icine bills to be paid by the student.
Frmo now on the Guild will pay the
board of special nurses when they are
absolutely necessary and will settle
all bills for inoculation against epi
demics.
Although no set rule fill be made,
it is the intention of the Guild to as
sist in the payment of surgeon's bills,
as well as to help out students who
are burdened with exceptionally large
doctor's bills. The motto of the Guild
this year will be to increase the privil
eges of the student to as great an ex
tent as a sound policy will permit.
