# Taming of Shrew Scores
## Leads in Shakessperean Comedy Are Well Taken 
### 
The shrew was tamed with much
gusto on the part of her lord and mas
ter Friday evening on the Assembly
Hall stage. As a first class perfor
mance of Shakespeare in hilarious
mood, the production was an undeni
able success. As a benefit for the
Seaman's Institute the results were
more doubtful. But a small audience
gathered to witness the excellent
work of the Garnet Holme company.
Miss Pearl Cook in the part of Kath
erine, the unmanageable, was every
inch a shrew. She stamped and scold
ed her way through the five acts of
the play and lost none of her spirit
with her final submission to Petruchio.
Hers was a charming and well-round
ed performance in every particular.
Petruchio in the hands of Richard
Chamberlain proved to be an equally
sympathetic interpretation. He man
aged to reconcile in masterly fashion
the demands of the part with our more
modern ideas on the subject of the
proper extent of masculine sway in
the household. Minor parts were taken
satisfactorily. *
