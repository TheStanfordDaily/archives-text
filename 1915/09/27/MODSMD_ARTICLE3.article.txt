# SATURDAY RUGBY
## As She Is Seen by One Five Hundredth of the Other Half 
### 
Football was awfully exciting Sat
urday. There were three games and
\'e won all but one of them. They say
that the freshman game was the best
one. They ran around so hard that it
looked as if they were going to wear
the lawn out terribly, especially on
the side where the Polytechnic boys
all stood.
Mr. Long, who stands at the center
of three men near the back of the field,
ran over the end of the field with the
ball three times. The most exciting
time was at the very last when the
gun shot off. It didn't, scare anybody
at all, but some of our men got the
ball and just kept on throwing at each
other until Mr. Long got it and put
it on the lawn around the edge. Mr.
Smith looked kind of funny Saturday.
His hair was all cut off and it let the
sun get in his eyes dreadfully. It's
good that he doesn't wear that band
thing around his hair any more, be
cause it made him look so much like
Mr. Carroll that it.was hard not to
get them mixed up.
The game with the Titans was nice
because they looked so handsome and
so much like Stanford men in their
red sweaters. The front part of their
team was good too, because they used
the ball a lot when they all put their
heads together and kicked. The nic
est way to score though was the gen
tlemanly way that the varsity did their
first one. Mr. Templeton tried to kick
the ball somewhere or other, but it
didn't get there. The Titans were all
standing around, and Mr. Halstead
just picked it up and set it gently on
the ground, and it was three points
for us. It would be so much more
sensible if they did it that way all the
time instead of wearing out the grass
and hitting each other and getting all
tired out.
The Palo Alto people beat the other
Stanford team pretty much. Nobody
stayed to see it though, they don't
seem to sit on the bleachers so very
much when we are getting beaten, do
they?
