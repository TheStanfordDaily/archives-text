## 
### 
"Nam," Chinaman and erstwhile
waiter at the Cardinal Club, is stop
ping for tiie present in the Palo Alto
city jail.
Behind this bare announcement lies
the story of the rise and fall of an am
bitious celestial who failed to make
his "get-away,"
About a week ago, Nam entered the
employ of M. J. Cody, Cardinal Club
house manager, as a waiter. Members
of the club noticed at once upon his
arrival that their wardrobes and jew
elry collections were diminishing with
unusual rapidity.
Cody decided that being house man
ager carried with it the duties of de
tective and policeman. He followed
"Nam" to his lodgings.
"Where things you takkee from Car
dinal Club," speak Cody.
"Yes, vellee nice day," return China
man.
"Look here," say mad Cody, "I'm not
here for any funny business. Let me
in."
Cody "corned" right on in.
Here is the "police" list of Cardinal
Club properties he found:
One suit of clothes, 3 B. V. D.'s, 2
spectacles, 1 gym suit, 3 rings, 1
sweater, 2 fountain pens, collection of
club and frat. pins, collection of china,
and one forged check awaiting to be
cashed.
"Where get stuff." ask Cody.
"Me name Hon. J. 'Nam' Walling
ford, reply "Nam." ".Me honest, am
bitious chinaman."
"Nam" now awaits trial.
