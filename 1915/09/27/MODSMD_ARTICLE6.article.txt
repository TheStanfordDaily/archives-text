# SANTA CLARA LOOMS FORMIDABLE
## Clean Sportsmanship Characterizes Mission Players 
### 
After witnessing the spirited rally
at Santa Clara Saturday evening, and
being a spectator at their splendid
victory over the Olympic Club fifteen
the following afternoon, even the most
candid observer must admit that the
mission institution will be both a de
sirable and dangerous opponent for
Stanford November 13, the date of the
Big Game.
The keynote of the speeches deliv
ered by Father White, moderator of
athletics, Coach Tommy Ybarrando,
Captain Schulz, and many others
prominent in forming studant opinion,
was the demand for clean and gentle
manly sportsmanship in all contests.
To a man, there was a declaration
made for good losers rather than poor
winners. A high tide of enthusiasm
was apparent throughout the rally,
which closed with a rousing sky
rocket for Stanford University.
Another point especially interesting
to note, was the favorable attitude
toward rugby displayed by students,

faculty and players alike. Further
more Stanford's stand in her past rela
tions with California was commended.
The old game stood in disrepute.
Yesterday's battle between Santa
Clara and the Winged "O" ruggers
proved to be the best match of the
football season to date. Predictions
and prophecies heretofore circulated
about the campus regarding the
strength of the mission team proved
entirely correct. Although the con
test was hard-fought from start to
finish, clean play featured Santa
Clara's rugby style.
Tommy Ybarrando, who is about as
popular a coach as ever undertook
the task of developing teams at Santa
Clara, has gathered a wealth of fast
and rugged material to form a nucleus
for a winning varsity. Already the
players have been instilled with the
spirit not to rest for one second dur
ing the game. This in great measure
was responsible for the S to 3 voctory
over the Olympic Club.
