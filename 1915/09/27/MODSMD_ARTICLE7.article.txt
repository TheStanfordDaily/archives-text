# RUGBY NOT DEAD, SAYS BEHRENS
## South Is Interested In Spite of Hostile Faculties 
### 
"Rugby interest in the southern
part of the state is not dead in spite
of the action of faculties of high
schools making it necessary for stu
dents there to play the American
game," said Graduate Manager Reh
rens, who returned yesterday from an
extended trip to Los Angeles and
vicinity.
"There is still a large rugby follow
ing in the south," said Behrens yes
terday." Newspaper and other pres
sure makes playing the game in high
schools impossible, but two and pos
sibly three young clubs will stay by
rugby. There are the Arden and
Marathon clubs of Los Angeles. They
will begin a series of games, and the
result of them will tell whether or not
a team from the south will come to
Stanford to play.
Arbitrary Changes,
"Three student bodies in Los An
geles were not consulted before prin
cipals changed to American. A large
number of the students and in many
cases the majority is still in favor of
rugby, but schools are controlled by
principals who force regulations for
Seven men were chosen Friday af-

athletic contests on the student bod
ies. The Los Angeles Athletic Club
called off rugby because officers of
the clubs were afraid of getting in
bad with the schools if they persisted
in playing anything but the old game."

While nothing can be done by Stan
ford at present to change the situa
tion in high schools of the south, Beh
rens believes that the present strong
interest for rugby will not be stilled
by conditions that are forced upon stu
dent bodies. It is probable that the
two strong clubs now playing rugby
will grow five or six teams when the
followers of the popular game gather
together. Arrangements have already
been made by the Arden and Mara
thon clubs to play a series of games
fin Manual Arts high school field in
Los Angeles, and according to Beh
rens, other rugby clubs are likely to
follow these two thriving athletic or
ganizations. That there is plenty of
materia] for several teams is not
doubted. All that is needed is organ
ization, and this is likely to follow
now that the opponents of rugby have
taken a definite stand.
