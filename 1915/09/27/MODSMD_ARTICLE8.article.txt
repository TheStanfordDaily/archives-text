# Judges Choose Intercollegiate Debaters to Meet The Blue and Gold and Southern California Teams
## 
### 
That, interest in debating at Stan
ford is increasing seems to be indi
cated by the large number of men who
competed in the intercollegiate try
outs. All three judges unite in mak
ing the statement that this year's try
outs were the best, both as to numbers
and as to quality, of any staged at
Stanford in recent years.
The men who were picked by the
judges, Professors A. M. Cathcart and
C. A. Huston of the Law department,
and Associate Professor L. E. Hassett
of th 3 English faculty, are as follows:
FT. C. Rlote, '18, M. Crobaugh, '18, J.
W. Fribley, '16, S. W. Grathwell, '16,
A. ,T. Hettinger, '16, M. L. McClintock,
'18, and A. Morosco, '16.
From the squad two teams and an
alternate will be chosen, this element
of uncertainty insuring close compe
tition up to the hour when the varsity
and second varsity trios are picked, a
fortnight or so before the debates. The
alternate will act as substitute should
any vacancy occur in either team.
Five of the seven men selected have
had experience on previous intercol
legiate debates. Hettinger has served

as alternate and as speaker in two
previous forensic encounters with Cal
ifornia, besides participating in last
year's Carnot. Fribley and Crobaugh
were members of last year's tri-state
squads. Crobaugh and McClintock
spoke in the freshman-sophomore de
bate last spring. In his freshman
year Morosco served on the intercol
legiate trio that broke California's
string of victories with a Stanford win.
Grathwell, a transfer from Pacific
University, Oregon, has had consid
erable experience in debating at the
northern institution. Blotc, although
a new man. shows excellent ability on
the platform.
F. E. Hill, '11, instructor in the Eng
lish department, and K. E. Leib, '15,
chairman of the debating committee,
will act as debating coaches, each
training one squad of three or four
men.
