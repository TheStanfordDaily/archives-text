# BEAUTY SHOW COMING
## Cap and Gown Plan Dansant and Cabaret for "Vanity Fair" 
### 
October 30 will be a closed date on
the college calendar. Cap and Gown
figured that it was time to stage some
thing and they are going to do it. In
stead of the time honored pre-Panama,
which by virtue of the present show
of nations along the Marina loses con
viction in name if not in nature, the
ladies will revert to type and name
their production "Vanity Fair."
The Union and the Women's Club
house will be used as a setting for the
passing show that will be arranged
for the delectation of all campus
dwellers. In the Union there will be
a dansant that will rival the favorite
produce cf the California building.
A cabaret will put the most versatile
vaudeville stars of the campus again
in the limelight. A beauty show will
give all comers all the advantages
with none of the drawbacks of a van
tage point on engineering corner. A
dog show will offer prizes to the most
belover campus pets, canine and oth
erwise. Every department of that
most feminine of magazines. "Vanity
Fair," will be presented in terms of
the 500. Frenehiness and femininity
will be the keynotes of the gamut of
frivolity which will be sonnded.
