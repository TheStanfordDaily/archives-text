Harking back, we timidly touch that
"inarbitrable principle" which the
Inner Shrine up at Berkeley has pious
ly lisped, as the cause of intercolle
giate disagreement.. First Stanford
tried to put the freshman elimination
question, and the rest of that sob stuff
up to an independent settlement board.
After Jimmie and Johnnie had be
come the high priests of American
football, we wanted to spill a game of
rugby on the field alongside their
product, just for the fun of compari
son. That offer was damned, so we
must resort to indoor sport. In the
shape of a contrast on paper.
Jimmy Lanagan, '00, is the hero and
creator of the Lanagan regime in Stan
ford athletics. He coached varsity
squads during the transition period,
and helped to bridge the gap between
the traditional "American" and the
new "English" breeds of play.
Along comes an article from Mr.
Lanagan's pen, which reveals the two
types of play in their nakedness, and
takas stock of them. The study will
he printed serially in The Daily Palo
Alto, and will make its first appear
ance tomorrow.
There are no fireworks in the com
parison. but it is so plumb full of
sense, and the writer has so much
sportsmanship and information in his
credit column, that some thousands of
people are going to read and believe.
Publication of Mr. Lanagan's comment
isn't a fad, like our editorial jibes at
the senior election farce, and that sort
of thing. We have a "mission" to per
form for the sake of intercollegiate
relations. And this treatise of Coach
Lanagan's will start us on the inside
track.
Maybe some of you think that the
Big Game with California is a dead
and buried issue. Well, most of us
don't think so. A few shots of elixir
like the one Mr. Lanagan has con
cocted are hound to frisk things up,
sooner or later. We aren't addressing
this package of new life to Messrs.
Stroud and Schaeffer or their immedi
ate cohorts. We just hope that some
day we can get the ear of real stu
dent opinion at Berkeley, and put a
bug of intelligence in it that will buzz,
and squirm, and have a good old time.
