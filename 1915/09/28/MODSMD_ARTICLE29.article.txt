# TRAINING RULES FOR RUGBY START MONDAY
## Reynolds Reports Men in Good Health; Injured Men Are Again Playing 
### 
Training rules will go into effect
next Monday, October 4, at five o'clock.
After that time candidates for the
rugby squads will be obliged to cease
"clowning," late hours, smoking and
liquor.
Three outside squad members, Pe
louze, Keagen. and Lytle, have been
promoted to the third varsity on the
inner turf.
Trainer Reynolds reports that his
department at the football field is now
devoid of cripples. Pettingill, who
had a bad ankle is almost ready for
real practice again, while Dubendorf
trusted his knee to indulge in some
light exercise yesterday. Tedford, who
was injured in the interclass game, is
now traveling unaided, and will be
able to enter the game at the end of
the week.
Possibly the most serious of the few
accidents which have happened on the
football field this season took place
last Friday when L. Wark, '19, broke
three ribs. During the past few years
Wark has been the mainstay of the
Long Reach high school eleven and is
one of the fastest short distance run
ners in the state. Needless to say,
Wark will lie out of the game for the
remainder of the season.
