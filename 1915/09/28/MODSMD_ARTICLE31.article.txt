# MERCHANTS BOOST TENNIS
## Interfraternity Court Winners to Receive Clips Donated by Palo Alto Men 
### 
The interfraternity tennis tourna
ment which is to be played on the cam
pus in the near future, is being boost
ed by Palo Alto merchants as well as
by the students. Wilson's has donated
a permanent cup for the singles,
while Thoit's has given two cups for
the doubles. These trophies are to be
permanent and will add much to the
cups, which are already in the posses
sion of the tennis men. In the inter
fraternity tennis tournament held two
years ago the Kappa Alpha men were
winners. Lin Murray, the sensational
Stanford representative in the eastern
tournaments of last year, won the
singles and with Chapman succeeded
in annexing the doubles. The frater
nity men this year are about even in
playing ability, which means a close
tournament.
