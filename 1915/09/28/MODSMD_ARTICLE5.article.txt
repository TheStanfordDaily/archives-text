# Fraternity and Club Men to Compete for New Swimming Prize
## 
### 
With the swimming tank finally in use,
Manager A. A. Goldsmith, '16, of the
swimming team, is again busy arrang
ing a schedule of meets. The first
contest on the calendar will be the
interclass affair which was originally
set for last Saturday, but which has
now been postponed until Friday af
ternoon and Saturday of this week.
The following week has been set
aside for an interfraternity and inter
club meet. Wideman and Son have
put up a trophy for this meet in the
form of an elaborate shield. The con
ditions specified by Widemans in of
fering the prize are that it be a per
petual challenge trophy to remain for
a period of one year in the hands of
the fraternity or club which annexes
the largest number of points in the
annual interclub contests.
Every fraternity and club on the
campus will be invited to enter a
team in the meet. According to Man
ager Goldsmith, the men in Encina
Hall will not be allowed to compete
as a whole but will have to enter
teams from the three eating clubs.
This was done to prevent the hall men
from having undue advantage over
organizations with smaller member
ships.
Six events have been scheduled for
the meet. They are the 50-yard, 100-
yard, 300.yard dashes; back-stroke,
diving and relay. Five places will
count in each event being scored 5
for first, 4 for second, 3 for third, 2 for
fourth and 1 for fifth position.
Preliminary heats in the events will
be run off on the Friday before the
meet. About eight men will be quali
fied for each race. Entries will be re
ceived at. any time from now on.
