## STUDENT CONTROL AT STAKE Will Not Interfere Until Men Show That They Are Incapable of Action 
### 
Confidence in the power of students
of the University of Washington
to regulate their own affairs was ex
pressed by President Suzallo at the
opening assembly of the new year, but
a hard-fisted disciplining was prom
ised if they failed to display a dssire
and an ability to correct such evils as
might develop.
"You must show yourselves striving
to be reasonable, moral and refined in
every avenue where your sontaneous
interests lie," he told the students who
packed the auditorium in Meany hall
to greet him for the first time. "What
ever problems we find together here
shall be treated in democratic fashion.
Whatever is wrong you, not I, will
study and correct. Only when you
show yourself morally insensitive to
real issues of human right and wrong,
unwilling to study your plights, and
incapable of action, shall I interfere.
Then I shall interfere with an iron
hand.
"For when men give up or lose their
citizenship, the sacred right and priv
ilege of cooperation, they can no long
er rule; they must be ruled by those
who are charged by authority and the
personal power, for this must be an
orderly world."
