SWORD AND SANDALS
stakes its reputation on
" Stop Thief"
IJust as "The Only WayÂ®* was the greatest piece of seri- C]
ous dramatic work the university has ever witnessed, so, q|
we feel, will "Stop Thief" set a standard for comedy pro- sj
dnctions at Stanford. Dj
Sword and Sandals believes that theatricals have a n3
place in the undergraduate life of the university; at the G]
same time we acknowledge that our patrons should be q|
offered more than mere "spirit" as an inducement for n]
attendance. jxj
Sword and Sandals promises value received on the even- 3
ing of October the eighth. "Stop Thief' will exceed
your greatest expectations. We say this unconditionally K
because we are willing to stake our reputation upon this ifl
comedy of comedies. If you admire amateur theatricals Cj
come and enjoy the evening with us; if you are a skep
tic, come and let us convince you that "Stop Thief" is all h
we say for it. K
