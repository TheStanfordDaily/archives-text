Just as the timekeeper's gun an
nounced the end of the game, with
St. Ignatius leading the freshmen by
three points, Morris, for the babes,
zigzagged across the line for the
tieing score.
The second half on today's contest
was replete with hard and fast play
ing, following a scoreless first half.
Up to the last moment it appeared as
if the Stanford freshmen's clean slate
would be chalked up with defeat, until
the dime-novel finish was executed.
Play in detail follows:
First Half
Twenty-five minutes of exciting
rugby, somewhat ragged, with no ap
parent advantage for either side aptly
characterizes the opening period. At
no time did the ball come within more
twenty yards of either goal line.
The majority of play was monopolized
by the forwards, considerable hard
play and spirit being exhibited. The
end of the half found the pigskin well
in the visitors' territory. Score, oto 0.
