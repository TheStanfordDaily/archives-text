# TURF MAY [illegible] INTERSCH [illegible]C CONTEST
## POSSIBILITY LOOMS BRIGHT First Move Now Up to Executive Committee to Sound Will of League 
### 
Possibilities of a Stanford Inter
scholastic in rugby now loom up more
as probabilities than they have at any
time since the former high school
championship contests were discon
tinued on the Cardinal turf as the
result of action by the principals of
schools in the state confederation.
That such a game would be bene
ficial both to Stanford and to the high
schools interested in rugby is the be
lief of a large number of people prom
inent. in athletic affairs here. Dr.
Frank Angell, chairman of the fac
ulty committee in charge of athletics,
suggests that Stanford offer a cup to
the high school team winning the final
game played on the Stanford turf, and
that the student body pay the expenses
of the squads competing at Stanford.
Care must be taken in attempting to
bring about such a game, according to
Dr. Angell, who says: "We must get
together with leaders in the present
interscholastic league, which is some
what shot to pieces as the result of the
action of the southern schools. It is
not our business to compete with the
present league. We wish simply to
help out, and we must find out what
members think of a proposition for
a final game at Stanford. We ought
to have the game here, because Stan
ford is now the center of rugby inter
est in this country, and we should help
the high school teams."
Graduate Manager Behrens com
mented favorably on the suggested in
terscholastic high school game on the
Stanford turf, and says there is a
strong probability that the matter
will be taken up by the Executive
Committee. Behrens believes, how
ever, that Stanford should "go slow
until the attitude of principals is
sounded."
Coach Floyd Brown also favors a
game to bring high school men in
contact with college rugby players.
"It will stimulate interest in rugby,"
he said, "and will keep the schools
standing out for the open game
leagued together."
Just what can be done, or will be
done, is a matter for the Executive
Committee to decide. At present the
plan of an interscholastic is simply an
idea favored by practically everyone
at Stanford, and one which will un
doubtedly be accorded a good recep
tion from schools interested in rugby,
â–  now that, headquarters for the sport
have changed.
