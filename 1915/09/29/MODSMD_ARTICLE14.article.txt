# 'Rah for Our Side
## 
### 
Somebody has written a song, but
he isn't going to grab that ten dollars,
so none of you real clever people need
to get scared and quit trying. The
thing isn't a song anyway, because
there is 110 music to it. And besides,
it cusses the Blue and Gold until the
colors run together, and get all mussy,
and ugly.
Now that's all right, but California
is off us this year, and Ave mustn't be
bothered with thinking a lot of hot
stuff that won't have any effect. Save
it up in case of a demand next fall,
What we need to do this season is
to be provincial, and conceited, so
that we can't sing or yell about any
thing except Stanford. Create a mo
nopoly 011 the bouquet market, and be
ready to put a winning edge 011 the
varsity, when that Santa Clara gamo
is called.
The kind of songs we need is tha
sort that claims our men are the king
pins on the field, and that this is the
chosen country, and gives the enemy
nothing. Leave definite mention of
the rival out of the scheme. Then 110
matter whether we play Santa Clara
or California, or someone else in
years to come.
There must be lots of new songs
and yells, and revision of nine of the
old stand-bys if they are to do service
again. The Mission students are
working hard on bleacher stunts. So
far Stanford is poorly supplied with
sideline ammunition, and the time is
short. Probably two good assistants
to the yell leader will be picked to
night, but they have little to work
with. There is money in song and yell
writing, too, but it makes us sore to
have to talk about that, so if you don't
know the details we won't tell you.
