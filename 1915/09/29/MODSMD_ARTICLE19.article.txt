# Library Receives Rare Books of Art from the Japanese Government
## 
### 
The Japanese government, through
their Commissioner General to the
Panama-Pacific International Exposi
tion, has sent as a gift to the univer
sity three large and beautiful volumes
entitled, "Japanese Temples and Their
Treasu res."
These books contain an outline of
the history of Japanese art, supple
mented with over five hundred collo
type plates and colored woodcuts of
architectural monuments, sculpture,
paintings, and allied arts. The three
volumes are a result of laborious in
vestigation by the most able of .Jap
anese scholars. The present edition
is published by the government of
Japan in very limited numbers so the
university feels the honor of the gift.
This is not the only recent addition
to the library. A twenty volume set
of translations of German classics has
just arrived and will be placed where
those interested may have easy access
to them. They contain the best litera
ture of Germany in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries. It is worthy of
note, that the "Life of Theodore Fon
taine" and many of his works are in
the set,, translated into English by
Professor William A. Cooper of the
German department of Stanford.
