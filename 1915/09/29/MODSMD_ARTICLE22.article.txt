# War Handicaps Histology Work
## 
### 
On account of the present European
war the Histology department has
been unable to obtain slides, cover
glasses, oils and stains, inasmuch as
those articles are made only in Ger
many. Professor F. M. McFarland of
the Histology department reports that
only a very few slides are obtainable
in the United States and these are
held at fabulous prices. As a result
the department will have to leave out
part of the course this year.
