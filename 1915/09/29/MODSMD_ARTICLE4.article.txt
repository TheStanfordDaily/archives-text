# Financial Outlook or the Stanford Crew Begins to Brighten
## Poughkeepsie Admirers Offer to Ship Shell to Coast 
### 
Once more Dame Fortune smiles
on the financially embarrassed but
victorious Stanford crew and brings
much needed and unexpected relief.
The assistance which has come within
the last twenty-four hours to the
husky oarsmen was sent from two
quarters. Almost simultaneously
with the receipt of a check from Pres
ident Branner for the remaining in
debtedness of sixty-eight dollars, came
the message from Poughkeepsie, say
ing that the Stanford shell would be
shipped to the Pacific Coast free, if
the crew so desired.
The night letter from the Stanford
enthusiasts at Poughkeepsie is signed
by Peter H. Troy, formerly mayor of
that city. The message is addressed
to C. H. Orme, *11», and reads as fol
lows:
"Committee of Stanford crew ad
mirers will defray expenses of ex
pressing shell back at once. Please
wire instructions to have shell turned
over to Honorable William H. Frank,
chairman, committee of shipment.
PETER H. TROY."
Mr. Troy has not confined his gen
erous acts toward the Stanford crew
to this one occasion. As president of
the Automobile Club of Poughkeepsie
he used his influence to make the stay
of the visiting westerners one which
will long be remembered. Among
other things he was personally respon
sible for numerous auto trips which
the crew enjoyed.
The generous disbursement of Pres
ident Branner is one which will be
keenly appreciated by every member
of the Stanford eight. The sixty-eight
dollar indebtedness was owed, for the
most part, to the hotel at which the
crew stopped in New York, while
other minor expenses made up the
remainder of the item.
Although th*> generous offer of the
Poughkeepsie citizens has not as yet
been formally accepted a decision will
be reached after a conference of the
Executive Committee.
