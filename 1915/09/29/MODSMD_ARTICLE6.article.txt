# JIMMY LANAGAN BEGINS REVIEW OF THE FOOTBALL MARKET TODAY
## Rugby and American Game Under the Spotlight 
### James F. Lanagan, '00 
NOTE.—Mr. Lanagan is known to American sports lovers as an em
inent coach and student of both the styles of football which are keep
ing Stanford and the University of California at athletic loggerheads.
He knows the games as they are being played today, and presents,
along with his comments, a solid record for intelligence and integrity.
'1 he first installment of his article sketches the early development of
both sports in the United States.
We have been hearing so much about so-called "American Football"
during the past few months that it may seem startling to say that there
is really no such thing. Rugby football, the game in which the ball is ad
vanced both by kicking and carrying it, was introduced into this coun
try a long time ago, and for some years was played according to Eng
lish rules. It was strictly an "on side" game,—that is to say, no
player who was ahead of the ball could either play the ball or inter
fere in any way with an opponent until he had been put on side.
Birth af "American Game"
The eastern universities introduced two rules which changed the
method ol play to such an extent that the so-called "American game"
was developed. The first change allowed players off side to interfere
with and ward off would-be tacklers. This resulted in the develop
ment of organized and effective interference to clear the way for the
man carrying the ball. The second rule gave to one side the undis
turbed possession of the ball, but required that the side must make five
yards in three attempts or forfeit the ball to the opponents.
Shifting the Line-ups
So, it was no longer necessary to have a scrimmage formation. The
forwards were placed on a single line and the backs brought up close
to the line so that the ball might be quickly passed to one of them. As
time went on, various minor rules were found necessary, but the two
rules just mentioned are at the bottom of all the difference between the
college game and rugby football. Whether the changes made by Amer
ican tinkerers with the rules have improved the game is a matter about
which there is very grave doubt.
Hughy on Pacific Coast
Rugby was introduced on the Pacific Coast in 1906. About the cir
cumstances surrounding its introduction, the less said the better. There
was considerable prejudice against the game because it was "English,"
because it was a different game from that played by the eastern colleges,
and because the students really had little or no choice in the matter.
The writer confesses his share in that prejudice. Intercollegiate rivalry
was strong enough to make the students at both California and Stanford
take hold of the game with a will. In nine years, both colleges have
succeeded in developing a high degree of skill at the game.
English Game Thrives
In spite of the unfavorable circumstances surrounding the introduc
tion of the game, it may fairly be said that rugby has been a great
success, almost from the beginning. More men both in and out of
college, have played it than ever played the college game, the athletic
clubs have taken it up, and numerous football clubs have been organ
ized and have played through every season. British Columbia, Aus
tralia and New Zealand have sent teams to compete with the local play
ers. We have had more and better opponents in rugby than we ever
had or ever can have in American football.
(in the second installment of this article, which will appear tomor
row on page two, the writer will develop a close analysis of rugby
and American football.)
