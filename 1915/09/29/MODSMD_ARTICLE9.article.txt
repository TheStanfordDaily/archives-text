# SENIOR CLASS ELECTS SEMESTER'S OFFICERS BY A WRITE BALLOT
## 
### 
The senior class yesterday elected
its officers by a white ballot, waiving
the formality of an election, due to the
fact that there was only one nominee
for each position. Those elected are
F. S. Murray, president: J. M. Tufts,
vice-president: Miss Helen Overman,
secretary: F. W. Riser, treasurer.
