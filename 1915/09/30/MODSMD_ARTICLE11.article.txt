# Speaking of Art
## 
### 
The dramatic budget is all swaddled
in comedy. Three topline attractions
dated between now and the morning
of November (i, with nary a Greek quo
tation or a heaving sigh in any one
of them. Sword and Sandals, Mas
quers, and the Sophomores are all
promising to make us chuckle, or
money refunded at the box oflice.
Now we aren't set against the hu
morous impulse the least bit. And
nobody has a call to turn his back in
disgust, and then seek seclusion from
the low brows, and spout Chaucer's
prologue by way of purifying himself.
All the organizations around the
campus need money, and we know it
by heart. According to local history,
the stage societies can wring more
sheckels out of our funny inclinations
than they can out of tear-sopped hand
kerchiefs. Hence the comedy.
Besides, there is something about
the Assembly Hall that puts a string
of sick jokes by a lot better than it
does the most worthy of the IJig
Ideas. All of us who have played
around here a few years have seen
some crippled comedy railroaded to
glory, while better achievements were
left limping pitifully.
As long as we demand ragtime
amusement, and the dramatic organi
zation k are reduced to the ranks of
the money grubbers, and the Assem
bly Hall is the only place for exhibi
tion, the classics will be kept on the
shelf.
Some talk is going around, and it
buzzes pretty ambitiously, about an
outdoor theater. We had a taste of
the sensation last semester, when
"Sherwood" was staged out on the
Kstate. A whole big crowd of tho
elite enjoyed that performance. Mod
esty forbids that we say we were there,
too. But it's a fact.
Frankly, we thought it was a bit
risky to mount the flimsy bleacher
contraption. And there were rough
edges galore, on the seats, and in the
stage effects, and so forth that would
be smoothed up if we had a permanent
place for taking aesthetic exercise.
What there ought to be is a cute little
nook somewhere in the hills, maybe,
with trees, and fresh air, and blue
sky all around. If the ghosts of the
Bard and these other immortals
wouldn't dance in a place like that,
what do they exnect?
Perhaps the Trustees would like to
help us raise Art out of the dust.
Some private help has already been
assured, and there are enough bugs
around the campus who would fork
out a quarter. It wouldn't take much
money to build our little outdoor ven
ture. And then the people who are
crazy about pageants, and drayma,
could play around all day, and they
wouldn't need much financial backing.
And those who are similarly bent
ennld look on, and artistic stock would
lie boosted.

prologue by way of purifying himself.
All the organizations around the
campus need money, and we know it
by heart. According to local history,
the stage societies can wring more
sheckels out of our funny inclinations
than they can out of tear-sopped hand
kerchiefs. Hence the comedy.
Besides, there is something about
the Assembly Hall that puts a string
of sick jokes by a lot better than it
does the most worthy of the IJig
Ideas. All of us who have played
around here a few years have seen
some crippled comedy railroaded to
glory, while better achievements were
left limping pitifully.
As long as we demand ragtime
amusement, and the dramatic organi
zation k are reduced to the ranks of
the money grubbers, and the Assem
bly Hall is the only place for exhibi
tion, the classics will be kept on the
shelf.
Some talk is going around, and it
buzzes pretty ambitiously, about an
outdoor theater. We had a taste of
the sensation last semester, when
"Sherwood" was staged out on the
Kstate. A whole big crowd of tho
elite enjoyed that performance. Mod
esty forbids that we say we were there,
too. But it's a fact.
Frankly, we thought it was a bit
risky to mount the flimsy bleacher
contraption. And there were rough
edges galore, on the seats, and in the
stage effects, and so forth that would
be smoothed up if we had a permanent
place for taking aesthetic exercise.
What there ought to be is a cute little
nook somewhere in the hills, maybe,
with trees, and fresh air, and blue
sky all around. If the ghosts of the
Bard and these other immortals
wouldn't dance in a place like that,
what do they exnect?
Perhaps the Trustees would like to
help us raise Art out of the dust.
Some private help has already been
assured, and there are enough bugs
around the campus who would fork
out a quarter. It wouldn't take much
money to build our little outdoor ven
ture. And then the people who are
crazy about pageants, and drayma,
could play around all day, and they
wouldn't need much financial backing.
And those who are similarly bent
ennld look on, and artistic stock would
lie boosted.
The dramatic budget is all swaddled
in comedy. Three topline attractions
dated between now and the morning
of November (i, with nary a Greek quo
tation or a heaving sigh in any one
of them. Sword and Sandals, Mas
quers, and the Sophomores are all
promising to make us chuckle, or
money refunded at the box oflice.
Now we aren't set against the hu
morous impulse the least bit. And
nobody has a call to turn his back in
disgust, and then seek seclusion from
the low brows, and spout Chaucer's
prologue by way of purifying himself.
