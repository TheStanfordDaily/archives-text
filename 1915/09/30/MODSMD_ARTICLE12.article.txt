# Rugby and American Game Under the Spotlight

### James F. Lanagan, '00 
The Taste Lingers
Where, in the old days, men stopped playing football directly they
left college, we find that the teams of the athletic clubs and the various
rugby clubs are composed, to a very large extent,, of ex-college play
ers. This can mean only one tiling,—that the players themselves en
joy the game and want to continue to play it just as long as they are
physically fit to do so. if attendance and enthusiasm are criterions,
the public lias been and is very favorable to rugby. The success of
rugby football, in spite of all obstacles, must have a reason, and the
writer is convinced that that reason is that it is a better game than
the so-called "American football," —better for spectators, better for
players and better as a factor in our general scheme of education.
To begin with, rugby is a much faster game; the ball is in play
practically all of the time, excepting when kicked out of bounds. The
very short delays on line-outs are really necessary to give the men the
occasional relaxation they need. American football at its best is a
very slow game. It is particularly slow under the new and compli
cated rules. It is necessary to line up after each down, and after that
the signal must be given and the play started. People who have seen
good rugby sometimes find it difficult to sit through a game of Amer
ican football.
Brain vs. Brawn
In rugby, the ball is advanced primarily by skill, and not by force.
No man who is off side may interfere with or obstruct an opponent or
play the ball until he is on side. American football is war on a small
scale. Its basic strategy consists in suddenly throwing against one or
two men such an overwhelming force of off sids interferers as to allow
the man carrying the ball to advance without being tackled. In rugby
there is all the attractiveness of sudden and violent personal contact,
without the unfair element of an attack by four or five players upon
one or two opponents.
Rugby is really football. Every player must be able to kick and
to kick well. iThe kicking attack is used in a general way to advance
the ball to a point from which an attempt to score may be made. It
is really only the finish of the attack that brings out the brilliant and
spectacular passing rush. In American football, the kicking is done by
one or two specialists. Nobody else aver kicks the ball. The specialist
punter may and does gain considerable ground for his team, but the
main part of the attack consists in carrying the ball.
Football In Fact
Rugby requires an all round development. A really good player
must be able to kick with either foot, carry the ball, and to take part
at any time in a passing or dribbling rush. There is no place for the
specialist. When the necessity for any particular line of ability arises,
one man is just as likely to be called upon as another.

Where, in the old days, men stopped playing football directly they
left college, we find that the teams of the athletic clubs and the various
rugby clubs are composed, to a very large extent,, of ex-college play
ers. This can mean only one tiling,—that the players themselves en
joy the game and want to continue to play it just as long as they are
physically fit to do so. if attendance and enthusiasm are criterions,
the public lias been and is very favorable to rugby. The success of
rugby football, in spite of all obstacles, must have a reason, and the
writer is convinced that that reason is that it is a better game than
the so-called "American football," —better for spectators, better for
players and better as a factor in our general scheme of education.
To begin with, rugby is a much faster game; the ball is in play
practically all of the time, excepting when kicked out of bounds. The
very short delays on line-outs are really necessary to give the men the
occasional relaxation they need. American football at its best is a
very slow game. It is particularly slow under the new and compli
cated rules. It is necessary to line up after each down, and after that
the signal must be given and the play started. People who have seen
good rugby sometimes find it difficult to sit through a game of Amer
ican football.
Brain vs. Brawn
In rugby, the ball is advanced primarily by skill, and not by force.
No man who is off side may interfere with or obstruct an opponent or
play the ball until he is on side. American football is war on a small
scale. Its basic strategy consists in suddenly throwing against one or
two men such an overwhelming force of off sids interferers as to allow
the man carrying the ball to advance without being tackled. In rugby
there is all the attractiveness of sudden and violent personal contact,
without the unfair element of an attack by four or five players upon
one or two opponents.
Rugby is really football. Every player must be able to kick and
to kick well. iThe kicking attack is used in a general way to advance
the ball to a point from which an attempt to score may be made. It
is really only the finish of the attack that brings out the brilliant and
spectacular passing rush. In American football, the kicking is done by
one or two specialists. Nobody else aver kicks the ball. The specialist
punter may and does gain considerable ground for his team, but the
main part of the attack consists in carrying the ball.
Football In Fact
Rugby requires an all round development. A really good player
must be able to kick with either foot, carry the ball, and to take part
at any time in a passing or dribbling rush. There is no place for the
specialist. When the necessity for any particular line of ability arises,
one man is just as likely to be called upon as another.
