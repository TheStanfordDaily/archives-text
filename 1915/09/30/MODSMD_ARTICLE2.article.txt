# MASQUERS WILL GIVE BIG JINKS PROGRAM
## Unique Dramatic Departure Is Announced by Women's Society for October 22 
### 
Masquers announce a decided dra
matic departure for the evening of
Friday, October 22, in the Assembly
Hall. A "jinks" program of excep
tional originality and interest will in
troduce novelties in the field of pan
tomime, one-act drama, "mystery,"
musical and vaudeville acts. Some of
the most talented players on the cam
pus will assist the masquers in their
unique venture.
"The Shepherd in the Distance," a
pantomimic romance in black and
white conceived by Holland Hudson,
will be the feature of the evening.
This humorous conceit won distinct
approval in New York, where it was
produced at the Band-Box theatre by
Winthrop Ames. J. R. Morgan, '16,
who played the role of the "shepherd"
this summer in Los Angeles, the only
city where the pantomime has been
staged outside of New York, will por*
tray the same character in the Mas
quers' production, which will be un
der his direction. Miss Nellita Choate,
'17, who scored in "Sherwood" last
semester, will enact the role of the
"Princess." The remainder of the cast
will be announced later and will in
clude Miss Elizabeth Taff. '15, Miss
Florence Stewart, 16. and W. E. Cur
tis, '16.
