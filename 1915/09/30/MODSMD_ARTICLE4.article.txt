Unique costumes will not only be
worn by those who preside over ta

part at the European market earlier
in the year. Italian organ grinders,
Spanish fortune tellers, Trish dumb
bell swingers and many other strange
ly dressed concessionaires will attract
attention of patrons and passersby.
The market will open at nine and con

Not only are the women of Stanford
and Palo Alto interested in the suc

of San Francisco, Burlingame and
