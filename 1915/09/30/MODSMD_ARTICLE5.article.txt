# CALIFORNIA STUDENT DECRIES POLICIES OF LEADERS
## CLAIMS SCHOLARS MISLED C.H. Runckel Edits Publication Criticizing Blue and Gold Athletic Stand 
### 
Sentiment of students at the Uni
versity of California, as reflected in
Student Opinion, the new open l'orum,
denounces the arbitrary methods dis
played by Blue and Gold athletic lead
ers in their switch from rugby to
American football. The current issue
of the magazine, of which C. H. Runc
kel is editor, is termed the "first in
surrecto number," which implies that
more of the same sort may be ex
pected.
Revolutionary Article.
The revolutionary attitude toward
big stick tactics of Graduate Manager
Stroud and his associates, is set forth
in an article written by the editor.
Runckel, in discussing his declara
tions over telephone this afternoon
said:
"My statements regarding unauthor
ized assumption of power by the grad
uate manager and other leaders, are
not merely an expression of my per
sonal convictions. They are fact, and
are based on fact."
Runckel's renovation is not intended
as a denunciation of Graduate Man
ager Stroud, or of anyone else per-
j sonally, but condemns a system which
allows them free sway. The points
made in his article, continued by him
personally, were in effect:
Football (iianiic ( minthomed.
The change to American football
was made during the summer vaca
tion on Stroud's initiative, without the
knowledge or consent of the California
student body. Quoting the writer:
"In so far as the constitution of the
Associated Students gives the grad
uate manager any power to shape the
policy of the undergraduate body, it
is radically undemocratic. His duties
are professionally administrative, and
for him to control our policy is an
impossible condition."
Rugby Favored.
In the telephone conversation today
Runckel said: "Personally, as I said
in Student Opinion, 1 am strongly in
favor of rugby, but 1 made no at
tempt to reflect campus opinion on
that score for a very good reason. All
we have seen on the lield this season
has bean American football. Further
more the student publications, with
the exception of Student Opinion, have
boosted American football to the ex
clusion of every other thought. The
predominance of the old game has
been so assertive that whatever senti
ment there is in favor of rugby haa
had no chance for expression.
Rugby Future Debatable.
"i think, however, that if a student
vote were taken now, the decision
would support the action of the gradu
ate manager and others in charge.
Personally, though 1 believe there is
a strong sentiment in favor of rugby,
and what may happen in the future is
an unknown quantity."
Douglas Erskine, sporting editor of
the San Francisco Examiner, takes
the new developments of the situation
as further opportunity to lament the
loss of the Big Game between Stan
ford and California, which he char
acterizes as the supreme attraction
in the Pacific sporting world.

Stroud and his associates, is set forth
in an article written by the editor.
Runckel, in discussing his declara
tions over telephone this afternoon
said:
"My statements regarding unauthor
ized assumption of power by the grad
uate manager and other leaders, are
not merely an expression of my per
sonal convictions. They are fact, and
are based on fact."
Runckel's renovation is not intended
as a denunciation of Graduate Man
ager Stroud, or of anyone else per-
j sonally, but condemns a system which
allows them free sway. The points
made in his article, continued by him
personally, were in effect:
Football (iianiic ( minthomed.
The change to American football
was made during the summer vaca
tion on Stroud's initiative, without the
knowledge or consent of the California
student body. Quoting the writer:
"In so far as the constitution of the
Associated Students gives the grad
uate manager any power to shape the
policy of the undergraduate body, it
is radically undemocratic. His duties
are professionally administrative, and
for him to control our policy is an
impossible condition."
Rugby Favored.
In the telephone conversation today
Runckel said: "Personally, as I said
in Student Opinion, 1 am strongly in
favor of rugby, but 1 made no at
tempt to reflect campus opinion on
that score for a very good reason. All
we have seen on the lield this season
has bean American football. Further
more the student publications, with
the exception of Student Opinion, have
boosted American football to the ex
clusion of every other thought. The
predominance of the old game has
been so assertive that whatever senti
ment there is in favor of rugby haa
had no chance for expression.
Rugby Future Debatable.
"i think, however, that if a student
vote were taken now, the decision
would support the action of the gradu
ate manager and others in charge.
Personally, though 1 believe there is
a strong sentiment in favor of rugby,
and what may happen in the future is
an unknown quantity."
Douglas Erskine, sporting editor of
the San Francisco Examiner, takes
the new developments of the situation
as further opportunity to lament the
loss of the Big Game between Stan
ford and California, which he char
acterizes as the supreme attraction
in the Pacific sporting world.
Sentiment of students at the Uni
versity of California, as reflected in
Student Opinion, the new open l'orum,
denounces the arbitrary methods dis
played by Blue and Gold athletic lead
ers in their switch from rugby to
American football. The current issue
of the magazine, of which C. H. Runc
kel is editor, is termed the "first in
surrecto number," which implies that
more of the same sort may be ex
pected.
Revolutionary Article.
The revolutionary attitude toward
big stick tactics of Graduate Manager
Stroud and his associates, is set forth
in an article written by the editor.
