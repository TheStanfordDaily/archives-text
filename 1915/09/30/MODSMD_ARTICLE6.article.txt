# AUSTRALIAN TRIP LOOMS UP
## Regular Schedule With Rugby Squads of Antipodes Sought That Further Details May be Taken Up 
### 
That plans are now under way to
arrange a series of games for prepar
atory school and collegiate champions
with rugby clubs of Australia and New
Zealand, was the statement given out
today by Doctor Frank Angel 1 of the
faculty athletic committee.
One reason for not giving out the
name of the Oxford man who wishes
to make the contribution of five thou
sands per year to defray expenses of
two teams in the Antipodes is that
plans must be made for a regular
schedule of games across the seas. It
is argued that a trip by American
rugby teams would not prove effective
if the teams merely played any club
that desired games.
According to the original statements
regarding the offer given out last
week, difficulty would be experienced
now in making up a series of sche
dules with Australian teams because
so many of the athletes of the British
colonies are fighting in Europe. For
that reason it is suggested that, ar
rangements for trips of United States
rugby champions be stopped until the
war ends.
However, according to Doctor An
gell, inquiries regarding a possible
schedule have already been sent to
Australia, and in the course of a month
or so, definite information regarding
the rugby situation in the Southern
Islands will be here. The actual plans
will be given the public later.
