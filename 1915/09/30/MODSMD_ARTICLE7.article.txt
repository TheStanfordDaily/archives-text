# SOPHOMORE PLAY CAST ANNOUNCED
## 
### 
Fourteen sophomores were chosen
last night by Coach Arthur Cyril for
the roles of the second year play,
"Bobby Burnit," to be presented No
vember 5, in the Assembly Hall. Three
minor parts, two for women, and one
male role, are still undecided.
The cast chosen for "Bobby Burnit"
is practically new to Stanford play
goers, though several members have
had considerable experience in other
places. The only local production
which seems to have served to train
the sophomores is "Sherwood," the
out-door production of the English
Club given on the Stanford Estate last
May.
On vis Takes Lead.
Cordon A. Davis easily captured the
leading role in "Bobby Burnitt," that
of .voting, inexperienced, Robert Bur
nit. victim of his more shrewd part
ners in the business left by the death
of an elder Burnit. Davis pleased
spectators at "Sherwood" last year by
his portrayal of "Shadows of a Leaf."
Biff Mates, the Bowery tough, stand
pat friend of Bobby Burnit, is admir
ably suited to L. W. Brown. Brown
has the physical qualifications for this
role of a boxer, gymnasium instruc
tor. and pugnacious individual in gen
eral. Variety is offered in this role,
when Biff falls in love with the fair
stenographer. Nellie Pratt, a part
taken by Miss Florence Mason.

by Burnit, will be interpreted by Miss

his deep voice, will carry out. P. H.

Tuck in "Sherwood," will defend and
attempt to straighten out the legal
complications which young Bobby
