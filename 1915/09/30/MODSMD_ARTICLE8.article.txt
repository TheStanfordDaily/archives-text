# EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ELECTS ASSISTANT YELL LEADERS
## GILROY AND MACKEL CHOSEN Cards Will Be Sent All Alumni to Stimulate Big Game Enthusiasm 
### 
The choice of two assistant yell
leaders was finally accomplished by
the Executive Committee at its meet
ing last evening. Relying on the
bleacher votes taken Saturday and
Wednesday, the committee elected J.
P. Mackel and William Gilroy to aid
Yell Leader Goodman.
Cards to be Sent Alumni.
A report was heard from the com
mittee appointed to stimulate the in
terest of Stanford alumni in the big
game with Santa Clara on November
11. It was decided to send either a
postcard or letter to every alumnus,
setting forth the fact that the game
this year will be just as good if not
better than has ever been played here
tofore, and urging each one to make
an effort to be in San Francisco on
the day of the match. All classes and
organizations will be informed that
Stanford students expect to turn out
en masse and that plans for reunions
should be begun at once. Communica
tion with every alumnus will entail
the sending of over 4,500 cards and
letters.
Fifteen dollars was appropriated to
be added to a fund which is being col
lected to purchase some kind of a tes
timonial for John Elliot, retiring pres
ident of the Pacific Coast Amateur
Athletic Association. Various colleges
and clubs on the coast will contribute,
the University of California having
agreed to give the same amount sub
scribed by Stanford. Just what will
be given to President Elliot has not
yet been decided.
Athletic Lectures Authorized.
A series of talks to be given track
and baseball men by experts from San
Francisco was authorized, and the ex
penses of such lectures guaranteed.
Men especially fitted to give instruc-
tiou in the various branches of these
sports will be secured from time to
time during the year.
Guerena Considered.
There was some discussion regard
ing the crew coach for the coming sea
son, and although no action was taken,
the name of Frank Guerena, last year's
successful coach, was considered. It
is possible that Guerena will not be
available, however, due to the fact that
his business may demand all of his
time. Nothing certain will be known
for at least a month.

Regular meeting of the Executive
Committee, September 29, 1915.

should be begun at once. Communica
tion with every alumnus will entail
the sending of over 4,500 cards and
letters.
Fifteen dollars was appropriated to
be added to a fund which is being col
lected to purchase some kind of a tes
timonial for John Elliot, retiring pres
ident of the Pacific Coast Amateur
Athletic Association. Various colleges
and clubs on the coast will contribute,
the University of California having
agreed to give the same amount sub
scribed by Stanford. Just what will
be given to President Elliot has not
yet been decided.
Athletic Lectures Authorized.
A series of talks to be given track
and baseball men by experts from San
Francisco was authorized, and the ex
penses of such lectures guaranteed.
Men especially fitted to give instruc-
tiou in the various branches of these
sports will be secured from time to
time during the year.
Guerena Considered.
There was some discussion regard
ing the crew coach for the coming sea
son, and although no action was taken,
the name of Frank Guerena, last year's
successful coach, was considered. It
is possible that Guerena will not be
available, however, due to the fact that
his business may demand all of his
time. Nothing certain will be known
for at least a month.

postcard or letter to every alumnus,
setting forth the fact that the game
this year will be just as good if not
better than has ever been played here
tofore, and urging each one to make
an effort to be in San Francisco on
the day of the match. All classes and
organizations will be informed that
Stanford students expect to turn out
en masse and that plans for reunions
should be begun at once. Communica
