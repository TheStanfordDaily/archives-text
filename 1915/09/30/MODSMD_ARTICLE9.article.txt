### 
Doctor H. R. Stolz was elected pres
ident of the Golf Club at a meeting
held in the vestry last night. Officers
elected with him for the present year
are C. Corbt, secretary, and Profes
sor R. E. A Hard ice, treasurer. These,
with L. S. Miller, '17, and F. H. Slade,
'18, will constitute the executive com
mittee.
Among the events scheduled for the
near future are a barbecue to be given
on the links, a dance and tournaments
with the Menlo Country Club, the In
gleside Golf Club, and the San Jose
Golf Club. The tournaments will start
within the next two or three weeks,
the exact dates to be announced later.
A report on the condition of the
links showed that the grass had bsen
cut on the first nine holes and that
the first five greens are now ready
for play. Work is progressing rapidly
on the others, and after the first rains
the fair-greens will be put into shape.
At present the number of Palo Alto
people admitted to the club is limited,
but this will in all probability be
amended at the next meeting so that
all Palo Alto people, who desire to do
so, may join the club and. upon the
payment of an initiation fee and the
regular dues of five dollars a year,
have full privileges of the links.
