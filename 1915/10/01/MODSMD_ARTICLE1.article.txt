# VARSITY WILL LINE UP AGAINST OLYMPICS TOMORROW
## AGAIN ARRANGE POSITIONS Strength of the Visiting Fifteen Presages Best Game of Season to Date 
### 
Stanford's varsity will be put to
a severe test tomorrow afternoon,
when it meets the Winged "O" rugby
club for the second time this season.
The freshmen arc to afford the cur
tain raiser in their match with the
San Jose high school fifteen, while the
second varsity, according to custom,
will close the day's play by lining up
against the College of Pacific.
Olympics Dangerous.
Beyond a doubt, the varsity-Olympic
club game will prove to be the closest
and hardsst fought contest of the sea
son. Three weeks ago the varsity
found its hands full in holding the
white jerseyed ruggers to a scoreless
tie. Last Saturday Santa Clara barely
managed to defeat the Olympics by an
eight to three count. The Winged "O"
officials have gathered together a gal
axy of stars with which they hope to
annex the coast championship. Furth
ermore one is not mis-stating the facts
when one says they are going to come
mighty close to winning the title.
Varsity Line-up Changed.
Several changes in the varsity line
up have been made by Coach Brown
during the course of the past week.
Owing to injuries, neither Pettingill
nor Adams are included on the active
list. The front rank shows Soper in
the fold once more as hooker, with
Knight and Bloeser as mates. Fisher
and Rehm are booked for the middle
rank berths, Jacomini substituting.
Lock is again assigned to Halsted.
The usual pairs of breakaways, Wylie
and Hraden, complete the scrum.
Erb, one of the best pilots of any
Stanford backfield, will be back at his
old position at half. The problemat
ical five-eighths offers an entirely new
combination for Cardinal fans to pon
der over. Urban is to hold down first
five, where he has been playing the
past few days. Long, freshman cen-
ter three-quarters, occupies the sec
ond five-eighths berth. Captain Car
roll is scheduled to resume his regu
lar place at center. The wing posi
tions find liic Templeton and Dieven
dorff playing opposite each other. Rob
Templeton once more is chosen for
last defense at fullback.
Freshmen Promise Victory.
The freshman-San Jose high school
game should put the bleacher athletes
in good humor for the big match of
the day. Only slight changes have
been made in the personnel of the
first year team. As yet their string
of victories remains unbroken and un
doubtedly will continue so tomorrow.
A glance over the second varsity
candidates, shows the strongest ag
gregation yet put on the field. The
final contest with the College of Pa
cific should prove more than inter
esting, as the Tigers last week piled
up a big score on the Barbarian club.
In the morning at eleven o'clock,
the third varsity and Berkeley high
school will again try conclusions on
the local turf. The opening contest
of the afternoon is scheduled to com
mence promptly at two o'clock. The
line-ups as announced this morning
by Coach Brown follow:
