## Southern Clubs Warn North to Strengthen Teams or Else Lose Title 
### 
Evidence that rugby in the southern
part of the state is still prospering,
and is now gaining strength in spite
of actions of southern high schools,
is found in the telegram received this
morning by Graduate Manager Beh
rens from A. P. Michael Narlian, a
British rugby player of international
fame, now managing a new team that
has been formed in Los Angeles. This
brings the number of rugby clubs now
playing in Los Angeles up to three.
The telegram reads:
"At enthusiastic meeting tonight in
vitation of California Rugby Union ac
cepted for northern trip. Practice
starts Saturday with sixty men signed
up. Advise northern teams to all
strengthen up as we expect to win
state championship. If life of rugby
depends upon Southern California, the
game will live a thousand years.
A. P. Michael Narlian."
Start Playing at Once.
The first contest for the southern
teams will be staged tomorrow. The
two clubs now thoroughly organized
and ready for practice are the Mara
thons and the Ardens. The former is
under the management of Pat Higgins,
while Hugh Blue will lead the Ardens.
Practically the same squad of men
that went out for rugby with the Los
Angeles Athletic Club is now signed
up with the three teams, in addition
to a number of high school players.
However, the teams will not be able
to play under the name of the L. A.
A. C„ owing to the fact that the south
ern athletic club discontinued rugby
to fall in line with the high schools
from whom most of its athletic mem
bers come.
.lust when the southern squads will
come north to meet the Stanford, Santa
Clara, and Olympic Club teams has not
been decided, but Graduate Manager
Behrens stated today that a series of
games in the vicinity of the bay is
now practically assured. Details of
the southerners' invasion of local terri
tory will be settled later when the
exact strength and status of the teams
playing in Los Angeles has been de
cided as the result of a. series of games
which begins tomorrow.
