# CALIFORNIA TO DEFAULT SOCCER GAMES TO STANFORD
## TAKE ANTI-FRESHMAN STAND Cardinal-Allies Match Will Be Played Here Tomorrow Morning 
### 
California will default to Stanford
in soccer if Stanford plays freshmen,
according to the stand taken by the
Blue and Gold representatives at the
meeting of the University and Club
Soccer League in San Francisco held
last night. Interest in the long and
stormy league session centered around
the possibilities of a Stanford-Cali
fornia match.
Stanford Uphold.
Stanford maintains the right to play
freshmen, which is in accordance
with the rulings of the league. Cali
fornia at first took the stand that if
Stanford used first-year men she would
reserve the right to call the game a
hye—that is, to call it off and yet not
default. According to the rules of the
league California has no right for such
action, but can only default the game.
Relinquishing this stand, California
then proposed to default the league
match, but meet Stanford at a later
hour on the same day in a game in
which no freshmen be allowed to com
pete. Stanford's representatives re
fused to accept this proposition.
Two (■aines Scheduled.
Stanford was to have met California
in two soccer matches at the end of
the league's fall season, November 20
and 27, but present indications make
their occurrence improbable.
Stanford was represented at last
night's meeting by W. B. Blodget, '15,
J. L. Reynolds, '15, Student Body Pres
ident P. R. Wilson, 'IG, and D. B. Car
roll, '16. H. W. Maloney, Stanford
soccer coach, president of the league,
and Graduate Manager E. C. Behrens,
'14, one of its honorary vice-presi
dents, were also present. Soccer Cap-
tain Shafer and Soccer Coach Gar
mendia represented the University of
California.
New Teams in League.
Partial reorganization of the league
was effected at last night's gathering.
A team of U. S .Marines from the Pre
sidio, with home grounds on the Ma
rina at the Exposition, was admitted
to the league, taking the place of the
Casuals, a pick-up organization re
cruiting players from the San Fran
cisco leagues.
The team made up of Stanford and
California second-string players which
has until now been known as the
"University All-Stars," remains in the
league but under the new name, the
"Allies."
Allies Opponents Tomorrow.
Tomorrows league games are Stan
ford vs. Allies, and California vs.
Olympic Club, the Marines drawing
the bye.
A large crowd will undoubtedly be
on hand at the soccer field tomorrow
