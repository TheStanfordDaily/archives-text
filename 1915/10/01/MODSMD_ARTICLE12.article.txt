# CALIFORNIA TO DEFAULT SOCCER GAMES TO STANFORD
## TAKE ANTI-FRESHMAN STAND Cardinal-Allies Match Will Be Played Here Tomorrow Morning 
### 
California will default to Stanford
in soccer if Stanford plays freshmen,
according to the stand taken by the
Blue and Gold representatives at the
meeting of the University and Club
Soccer League in San Francisco held
last night. Interest in the long and
stormy league session centered around
the possibilities of a Stanford-Cali
fornia match.
Stanford Uphold.
Stanford maintains the right to play
freshmen, which is in accordance
with the rulings of the league. Cali
fornia at first took the stand that if
Stanford used first-year men she would
reserve the right to call the game a
hye—that is, to call it off and yet not
default. According to the rules of the
league California has no right for such
action, but can only default the game.
Relinquishing this stand, California
then proposed to default the league
match, but meet Stanford at a later
hour on the same day in a game in
which no freshmen be allowed to com
pete. Stanford's representatives re
fused to accept this proposition.
Two (■aines Scheduled.
Stanford was to have met California
in two soccer matches at the end of
the league's fall season, November 20
and 27, but present indications make
their occurrence improbable.

night's meeting by W. B. Blodget, '15,
J. L. Reynolds, '15, Student Body Pres
