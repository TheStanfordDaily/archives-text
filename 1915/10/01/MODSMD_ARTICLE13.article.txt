# Crew Declines Offer of Poughkeepsie Admirers
## Crew Men Enjoy Banquet at the Home of Professor Trent 
### 
That Stanford shall not accept the
generous offer of the citizens of Pough
keepsie to prepay the expressage of
the Stanford shell to the Pacific Coast
is the concensus of opinion gathered
from Stanford crew enthusiasts since
the arrival of the message from the
East yesterday. A telegram of sincere
thanks has been sent by the Graduate
Manager to the Poughkeepsie "Com
mittee of Stanford Admirers" with the
explanation that the Stanford student
body feels it a duty to provide funds
for the transportation of the shell to
the Pacific Coast.
This decision does not mean that
the shell will remain interned for an
indefinite period at Poughkeepsie. As
soon as the necessary money for ship
ment has been provided the boat will
be returned via the Panama Canal.
Professor P. J. Treat of th? History
department acted as host at dinner
last evening to the entire Stanford
crew. Professor C. D. Marx. Or. Frank
Angell, Professor F. C. Woodward, and
crew coach, F. L. Guerena. Dinner
was served at f>:3o at the home of Pro
fessor Treat on Salvatlerra street.
Following dinner an informal dis
cussion of crew ensue. After re
rowing the Poughkeepsie race, the
party devoted the remainder of the
evening to a consideration of plans for
the 1916 crew season.
