# The 						New Allies
## 
### 
Comes the pleasant intelligence that
a group of Blue and Gold soccerites
are rusticating to the Farm tomor
row to link up with some of our Stan
ford players. We're glad to welcome
them, and that's no mistake.
With an aggregation composed of
forwards from the transbay camp, and
Cardinal hacks, it isn't too much to
hope that there, will soon be a slump
in intercollegiate disagreement stock.
Nothing but an edict from the Inner
Council at Berkeley could keep Cali
fornia and Stanford soccer teams from
competition under the league regula
tions. All followers of the sport want
to see the contests, and to take part
in them.
Since the players can't meet as
rivals, they are going to combine
forces. Tomorrow will show whether
the Circle C and Circle S can form a
fighting unit. And this time, we are
betting on the Allies.
Rugby hasn't been short circuited
in Southern California. About the
time the varsity lines up against the
Olympics tomorrow, sixty ruggers
down in Los Angeles will cut some
preliminary capers. Which is just an
other way of saying that the leaven is
beginning to work.
