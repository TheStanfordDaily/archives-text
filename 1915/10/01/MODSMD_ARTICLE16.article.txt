# SWIMMERS ARE ELIMINATED
## Preliminary Meet Decides Contestants for Tourney Tomorrow Morning 
### 
Preliminary heats in the interclass
swimming meet events were held in
the plunge this afternoon. In four
of the eight scheduled events it was
necessary to hold elimination races.
The finals of the meet will be run off
tomorrow morning at 10:30 o'clock.
While the meet will determine class
superiority in water sports it will in
reality serve principally to give Coach
Brandsten and the Stanford public in
general an idea of the ability of the
men from whom the varsity swimming
team will have to be drawn. No ad
mission will be charged to the meet,
which will serve as the dedication of
the long awaited tank.
