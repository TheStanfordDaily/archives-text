### 
October 16 has been definitely set
as the date for the Gymnasium Club
dance, which by arrangement with the
Physical Training department, will be

Besides the regular sixteen rounds of
music with two extras on the side
lines, there will be a program of
stunts between the halves.
Arrangements have been completed
for an exhibition by the club members
to include 20-man pyramid building,
