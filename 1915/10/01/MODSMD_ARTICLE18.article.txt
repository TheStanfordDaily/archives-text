# Rugby and American Game Under the Spotlight
## 
### James F. Lanagan, '00 
NOTE. —With today's installment, Jimmy Lanagan's comparison of rugby
and American football is concluded.
There seems to be 110 question but that a much larger number of
men in colleges and schools may take part in the game of rugby. No
signals are necessary in the game. Situations in attack and defense
develop so rapidly that it is practically impossible to devise and put into
operation any scheme whatever. The result is that any player may at
any time take part in a game, even if he has never seen any of his
fellow players before. Stanford's experience in this respect has been
very fortunate. There are, at present, about four times as many men
actually playing football 011 the different campus fields than played the
American game in 1905. In that year, the Olympic Club was the only
football organization outside of colleges which competed with Stan
ford. It was then very di Hi cult for the Olympic Club to keep its team
together. Now we have four clubs playing the game and playing with
an enthusiasm and an enjoyment which the college football players
never knew.
Individual Resource
American football is, essentially, a coach's game. The strategy of
attack and defense is worked out entirely by the coaches, and each man
is drilled to do his own particular part in each play. Seldom, if ever,
does he have any notion of the strategy of the game or of the reasons
why certain things are done. He does not have to think; that is done
for him. He listens for a number, and when he hears that number, he
proceeds to do his little part in the particular movement which is being
executed. The quarterback, of course, must keep in mind all of the
strategy that has been taught him by the coaches. At the eastern uni
versities, the football material will average up about the same over a
period of four or five years. In spite of that fact, we find that, some
times, a college will lose the big football game for four or five years in
succession. The difference is in the coaching system. It is not meant
that one could play rugby without instruction, but, ones upon the field,
every player must think for himself. When a situation suddenly con
fronts him, he must solve it and solve it instantly. He cannot lean
on anybody else. Therein lies the greatsst value of the game.
The Coach's Battle
The only excuse for football or anything else in college or school
life is that it forms a valuable part of our general scheme of education.
If that be the test, then the verdict should be for rugby as against
American football. It gives the player all the benefits of the strict dis
cipline and physical exercise of the American gams and, in addition,
it makes him stand on his own feet and use his own brains.

attack and defense is worked out entirely by the coaches, and each man
is drilled to do his own particular part in each play. Seldom, if ever,
does he have any notion of the strategy of the game or of the reasons
why certain things are done. He does not have to think; that is done
for him. He listens for a number, and when he hears that number, he
proceeds to do his little part in the particular movement which is being
executed. The quarterback, of course, must keep in mind all of the
strategy that has been taught him by the coaches. At the eastern uni
versities, the football material will average up about the same over a
period of four or five years. In spite of that fact, we find that, some
times, a college will lose the big football game for four or five years in
succession. The difference is in the coaching system. It is not meant
that one could play rugby without instruction, but, ones upon the field,
every player must think for himself. When a situation suddenly con
fronts him, he must solve it and solve it instantly. He cannot lean
on anybody else. Therein lies the greatsst value of the game.
The Coach's Battle
The only excuse for football or anything else in college or school
life is that it forms a valuable part of our general scheme of education.
If that be the test, then the verdict should be for rugby as against
American football. It gives the player all the benefits of the strict dis
cipline and physical exercise of the American gams and, in addition,
it makes him stand on his own feet and use his own brains.
