# COAST COUNTIES SCHOOLS WANT STANFORD REFEREES
## 
### 
Graduate Manager E. C. Behrens
has received a letter from A. B. Hand
sky, secretary of the Coast Counties
Athletic League, asking Stanford to
furnish referees for the rugby games
to be played in the league this season.
The letter came as a surprise to Beh
rens, who understood that all of the
schools in Monterey and San Benito
counties had changed to the American
game.
The Coast Counties Athletic League
takes in four high schools, Gilroy, Hol
lister, Watsonville, and Salinas, each
of which is capable of putting a strong
fifteen in the field. The league now
turns to Stanford to furnish officials
for games, though all expenses will be
borne by the school treasurers.
