# Plans Progressing For Annual Smoker Of Law Department
## 
### 
Plans for the annual smoker of the
Law department, which will probably
be held a week from next Wednesday,
October 13, are fast nearing comple
tion. This smoker is given every year,
chiefly for the benefit of the sopho
mores and freshmen in the Pre-legal
department, that they may meet the
older men who are actually taking
law, and become acquainted with the
honor system and other traditions.
The new organization of the stu
dents of the department is proving to
be a great help in transacting the bus
iness of the smoker. C. S. Davis, gr.,
chairman of the committee, is arrang
ing for an attractive program of stunts
and music, intended to add spice to
the more instructive entertainment of
speeches by the law faculty and O. H.
Castle, '14, president of the new asso
ciation of law students.
The Union will probably be the
scene of the smoker. Tf so. it will be
the first time for years that it has
not been held in the Faculty Club
house.
The committee especially wishes to
impress the underclassmen with the
importance of the smoker, and urges
them to keep the date open so that
they will be able to attend. A good
supper is promised, and no one will be
allowed to depart hungry.
