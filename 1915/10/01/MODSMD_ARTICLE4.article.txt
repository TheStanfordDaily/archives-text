# Racqueters Off On Initial Round of Club Tournament
## Organizations Enter Stars to Compete for Cups Offered 
### 
The annual interfraternity tennis
tournament began this afternoon on
the Stanford courts. Twenty frater
nities and clubs have entered teams,
many close matches being assured.
Among the entrants are found the
names of the best tennis material in
Stanford, so the final result of the play
may be difficult to prophesy. Two cups
were donated by Thoits Brothers to be
played for in the doubles, while one
cup was put up by Wilson's to be
played for in the singles.
It has been planned to finish this
tournament by next Monday. Tour
naments in the past have been dragged
out for a week or two, but by running
both the preliminary and first rounds
off today, the play should come to the
finals by Monday. Tennis captain, .T.
S. Hutchinson, '16, has announced the
following drawing for the singles and
doubles.
