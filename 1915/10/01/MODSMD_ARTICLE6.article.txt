## PRINCIPAL ROLES STRONG Performance of Professional Caliber Will Be Staged Next Friday 
### 
On a wedding day things in general
might be supposed to run smoothly
over a strata of suppressed excite
ment. but in the Carr family the ex
citement is on the surface and the
train of events proceeds in a way that
is anything but well ordered. "Stop
Thief" presents a fabric of complica
tions embroidered with laughs that
will make the most ennuied of cam
pus fans sit up and take notice.
Pretty Thief Makes Trouble.
Around the pretty maid, who ten
minutes after her arrival has man
aged to upset the mental calculations
of most of the Carr family, and her
confederate, Jack Doogan, center most
of the thrills of the play. Together
they take every opportunity to make
capital of the absentmindedness of
the old father and to convince the
distracted bridegroom that he is an
incurable kleptomaniac. Things dis
appear and turn up again in mysteri
ous fashion, and "with wedding pres
ents lying al] over the place" as the
maid tells Doogan over the telephone,
complications pile up with trip-ham
mer rapidity.
Seat Sale October 8.
October 8 is the date set for "Stop
Thief" and tickets will go on sale
early next week. Aside from the fact
that this is the first play of the sea
son, the fact that farce is a new field
for Sword and Sandals' should
mark the performance as notable.
"Stop Thief" is not merely broad
farce, however. Its dramatic situa
tions will call for most able acting on
the part of the principals.
The part of Nell is taking form in
the hands of Miss Esther Liversidge,
'17. At one moment she is the demure,
respectful parlor maid. With light
ning rapidity she becomes the clever,
resourceful accomplice of Doogan.
With equal ease Buford Williams, '16,
in the part of the crook assumes and
lays his mask of respectability. The
other parts do not necessarily call for
such a measure of versatility in act
ing, but will none the less prove ex
acting in their demands on all mem
bers of the cast.
