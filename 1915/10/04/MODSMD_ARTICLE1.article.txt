# OLYMPICS SWAMPED IN EXCITING BOUT WITH VARSITY
## MID-SEASON FORM EXHIBITED Freshmen Down San Jose High 52 to O--—All-Blacks Victorious 
### 
Dame Fortune smiled on Stanford's
football hopes Saturday with the re
sulting clean sweep of four victories
featured by the glorious walk-away of
a varsity over a highly touted Olympic
Club fifteen. Throughout the long
hours of play the deluge of Cardinal
scores followed in such rapid succes
sion that even a mathematical brain
would have become dazed. The task
of staging a more exciting and enter
taining athletic exhibition than the
rugby contests displayed on the local
turf Saturday would indeed be difficult.
Varsity Outplays Winded "0. w
Dopesters, who figured on a close
game, were much surprised when the
final count of 48 to 13 was returned at
the conclusion of tha Winged "O" bat
tle. The good all-around play put up
by the Varsity was a revelation to the
bleachers. Precisional clock-work
passing rushes of the backfleld com
pleted without the usual miscues kept
the rooting section on its feet during
the greater part of the game.
Not since California was routed last
November, have such pleasing pass
ing rushes been exhibited.
The Stanford forwards, opposed by
a dangerous pack, kept things all their
own way. Time and again the ball
was hooked back to the half like
greased lightning. Furthermore the
Olympic pack found itself surpassed
both in line-outs and dribbling duels.
Twelve Tries for Stanford.
The total Stanford score shows
twelve tries and eight conversions. A
transferring process, Wylie to Erb, to
Urban, to Rehm, to Soper, and at
length to Dievendorff over thirty yards
produced the initial try. Bloeser
picked and registered a minute later
following a long dribbling attack.
Neither try was converted by Rob Tem
pleton. Lachmund almost evened up
matters at this point by sprinting
across for a score. Hale added two
points. Soper to Halsted for twenty
yards continued the count for Stan
ford. Conversion failed. Carroll to
Ric Templeton. who covercd thirty
yards, plus a goal added five more
points. When Carroll received Tem
pleton's cross kick and dashed fifteen
yards, the fifth try was completed.
Again Hob Templeton converted. Ur
ban dashed forty yards through the
entire Olympic team for a try a min
ute later. Templeton failed to con
vert. A ninety yard rush between Erb,
Fisher, Braden, Carroll, and Temple
ton produced the last score of the half.
Score, 27-5.
The same brand of merriment con
tinued in the second period. Shortly
after the opening whistle, Halsted ran
thirty yards for a try. Templeton con
verted. Hawks managed to add a few
points to the Winged "O" total by go
ing over the line. Hale converted.
Bihlman's weight produced another
score after Rehm had made a long
run down the field. Ric Templeton
failed to convert. Urban next was in
the limelight, and quite a brilliant
light, by scooting sixty yards for a
try. Ric Templeton converted. A
Carroll, Templeton. and Soper combi
nation allowed the latter to go over,
for the next three points. Again a
goal was made by Templeton. Hawks'
thirty yard run caused the last Olym
pic score, which went unconverted.
Rehm just before the end of the game
wound up the affair by falling over the
line for the final try. No conversion.
Freshmen Blank San Jose.
San Jose in their match with the
freshmen proved no opposition at all,
as the 52 to 0 score will indicate.
Points were hung up by the first year
ruggers almost as fast as they could
run, rendering the contest uninterest
ing. Boydston registered on three oc
casions, Boulware twice, while Smith,
Stevens, Morris, Wagner, Bonney,
Caughey, and Katten each went across
once
Those who remained to witness the
College of Pacific line-up against the
All-Blacks were rewarded with a good
close game. Henry gave the visitors
a lead by scoring the only try of the
first half. Bacon evened up matters
with a spurt over the line early in
the second period. .Johnson's try and
Townsend's conversion laid the con
test on ice, leaving the final count 8
to 3 in favor of Stanford.
