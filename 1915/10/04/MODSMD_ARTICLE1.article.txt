# OLYMPICS SWAMPED IN EXCITING BOUT WITH VARSITY
## MID-SEASON FORM EXHIBITED Freshmen Down San Jose High 52 to O--â€”All-Blacks Victorious

Dame Fortune smiled on Stanford's
football hopes Saturday with the re
sulting clean sweep of four victories
featured by the glorious walk-away of
a varsity over a highly touted Olympic
Club fifteen. Throughout the long
hours of play the deluge of Cardinal
scores followed in such rapid succes

would have become dazed. The task
of staging a more exciting and enter

greased lightning. Furthermore the
Olympic pack found itself surpassed
both in line-outs and dribbling duels.
Twelve Tries for Stanford.
The total Stanford score shows
twelve tries and eight conversions. A
transferring process, Wylie to Erb, to
Urban, to Rehm, to Soper, and at
length to Dievendorff over thirty yards
produced the initial try. Bloeser
picked and registered a minute later
following a long dribbling attack.
Neither try was converted by Rob Tem

matters at this point by sprinting
across for a score. Hale added two
points. Soper to Halsted for twenty
yards continued the count for Stan
