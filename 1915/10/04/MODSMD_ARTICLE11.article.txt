# "STOP THIEF" DRAWING TO BE TOMORROW AFTERNOON
## ONE O'CLOCK IS HOUR NAMED Record Sale of Pasteboards Is Expected For Initial Play of the Season 
### 
Tickets for "Stop Thief" will go on
sale tomorrow at the Bookstore and
at VYeingartner's drug store in Palo
Alto. The drawing for numbers will
be held at 1:10 and the sale will take
place immediately afterward. The
performance is slated for Friday even
ing at the Assembly Hall.
New scenery has been purchased by
Sword and Sandals for this play and
one set will be used throughout the
three acts. It will be the first time
in the history of Stanford dramatics
that the doors in the canvass walls
gracing the Assembly Hall stage will
be of real wood. The importance of
the entrances and exits which go to
make up the complications of this
comedy will go far to maks it doubly
desirable that the doors will slam
when they are supposed to slam.
Rehearsal is rapidly rounding the
play into shape and Friday's produc
tion promises to be up to the usual
Sword and Sandals standard. The
part of the millionaire bridegroom
which has been entrusted to W. G.
Paul, '15, will be one which enlists
most of the sympathies of the audi
ence. He is n.ade by the clever Doo
gan and the maid to think that he is
a kleptomaniac. Another difficult part
calling once more for the acme of ab
sentmindedness will be that of the
father of the bride. This role is in
the hands of J. C. Cross, '17.
