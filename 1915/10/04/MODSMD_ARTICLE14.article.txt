(From Greek Hoot)

This is going to tell all about a eer
taiu tradition, and the freshman elec
tion ou the Quad today, and a few red
hats. And it's real live stuff, every
bit of it, except the part about the
delapidated tradition, and the few
sophomores.
Nineteen nominated class officers a
week ago today, and put two or more
candidates in the running for every
office save that of vice-president. This
morning and afternoon freshmen
flocked around the ballot box quite
considerably.
Sometime during the morning or af
ternoon, some sophomores conceived
the notion that the Quad was being
desecrated. They handed together in
small bat noisy riot squads, and noti
fied upperclassmen in charge that if
the obnoxious freshmen and their poll
ing apparatus weren't removed, there
would be all sorts of things to pay.
Now we are surprised at some of
those sophomores. And the tradition
about freshman elections on the Quad,
if there is such a thing, belongs with
the Plug Ugly and some other things.
We aren't raising our freshmen up
to be hewers of wood and fetchers of
water. There isn't any place on the
campus too good for their class meet
ings and elections. Key them down
by -ill means, when they need disci
pline. But in the words of the old
philosopher, use the bean in choosing
a time and place. We are trying to
raise a crop of Stanford men and
women, and judging from the election
returns, it has begun to sprout.
