ation Graduate Manager Stroud has
asked all coaches of the old game
and other men who have a good knowl
edge of the line points, to meet at
Berkeley on October 6 and form the
' Football Officials' Association of Cali
fornia." They will watch the game
between California and the Commer
cial Club on that day and then will
discuss many of the new points of the
old game. The association is formed
to give all the members a better idea
of the American game as it is played
now, so that thsy will be able to act
as referees in games, and be able to
coach teams in a more efficient
manner.
