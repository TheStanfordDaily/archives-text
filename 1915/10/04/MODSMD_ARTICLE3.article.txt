# FOURTH SERIES OF WEST MEMORIAL TALKS ENDED
## Last Lecture Given Sunday--â€”Dr Slattery Leaves For Home 
### 
Reverend Dr. Charles Slattery, rec
tor of Grace church, New York, deliv
ered the third and last of the Raymond
F. West memorial lectures on "Immor
tality, Human Conduct, and Human
Destiny,' as the regular Sunday morn
ins sermon in the Memorial church.
Throughout his lectures on "Immor
tality" Dr. Slattery dealt with the sub
ject in its very broadest sense. Such
qualities as the power of discrimina
tion, truth, hope, and love were taken
as examples of things which have ex
isted from the beginning of mankind
and have therefore been proven to be
immortal.
As an illustration of the immortality
of discrimination Dr. Slattery cited
the present situation in France. Since
France has chosen to preserve her na
tional honor even when it means the
destruction of her ancient and beauti
ful cities, the honor of France has
survived, and is therefore immortal.
Similarly the immortality of hope,
truth, and love were proven.
Dr. Slattery left the campus for
San Francisco at three o'clock yes
terday. From there he will return im
mediately to New York.
