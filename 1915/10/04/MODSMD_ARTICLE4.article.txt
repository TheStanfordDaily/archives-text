# KREISLER WILL PLAY
## Ticket Sale For Concert Is Unusually Large 
### 
A crowded house for the Kreisler
concert on Thursday evening is as
sured by the unusually large seat sale
to date. Almost all the tickets have
been sold, although a few seats arc
still available. As the first event of
the musical year, the Kreisler con
cert should be an artistic and finan
cial success. This is the second time
the great Austrian violinist has ap
peared at Stanford. He gave a conccrt
in March of last year under the aus
pices of (he faculty committee on pub
lic entertainment.
Kreisler has always held a place
high in the favor of concert goers, but
his popularity lias reached a higher
point than ever since his return from
the war. The violinist was an officer
in the Austrian reserves and upon the
outbreak of the war was called to the
front. He served in the Austrian
trenches until a wound made his dis
charge necessary.
