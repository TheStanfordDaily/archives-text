# PROFESSOR KELLOGG IS LEADING BELGIAN RELIEF
## HEADQUARTERS AT BRUSSELS Supervises Feeding of Seven Millions of Destitute People 
### 
Professor V. L. Kellogg, of the Ento
mology department, according to a tel
egram recently received by Mrs. Kel
logg, will probably not return to Stan
ford until the beginning of next semes
ter. Leaving May 8, 1915, to help in
the work of feeding destitute mill lions
in Europe under the Commission of
Relief for the Belgians, of which Mr.
H. C. Hoover, 9">, is the head, Profes
sor Kellogg expected to return for the
opening of college in September. Later
he applied for and was granted an ex
tension of six weeks by the Stanford
Board of Trustees, feeling that it was
his duty to remain, owing to the enor
mity of the task before the commission.
During the summer he has had
charge of the work in Northern
France, feeding about three million
people. The French in this portion
of the country are not destitute, hav
ing money to pay for the food fur
nished: but they were unable to se
cure provisions and appealed to the
commission for aid last April. Mr.
Hoover felt that he had 110 right to
use the money for the Belgians to
feed the French, but the conditions
were so terrible that he agreed to fur
nish food providing it was paid for.
Thus a new field was opened, of which
Professor Kellogg has had charge
since the beginning.
A few weeks ago, however, he was
transferred to Brussels. Mr. Oscar T.
Crosby, a prominent engineer of New
York, who has had charge of the Bel
gian field, was obliged to leave for
Switzerland. Professor Kellogg vol
unteered to remain in his stead. He is
now supervising the work of feeding
seven million Belgians, three million
of whom are destitute and four mil
lion able to pay for their food.
The commission is the only avenue
for provisions entering Belgium, as
the British food blockade extends to
Ihe war-ridden country, and the Eng
lish will not allow stores to enter by
any other commercial or charitable
channel. It was only upon the guar
antee of Brand Whitlock, American
ambassador to Belgium, who prom
ised that none of the food would reach
tiie Germans, that England allows
even this commission to bring food to
the unfortunate people.
