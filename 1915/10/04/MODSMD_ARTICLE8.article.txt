Superior individual team work won
for the Stanford soccerites in their
game with the Allies, a combination
team of Stanford and California play
ers, Saturday afternoon, the final
score being 4 to 0.
Speed marked the entire game, in
spite of the fact that the Stanford men
had played a snappy practice game the
same morning, since the Californians
failed to appear at the time set for
the game.
At noon the five California men who
played forward berths for the Allies
arrived and it was decided to play the

As a result of one of many excellent
dribbling rushes Sid Adams scored
Stanford's first goal in the initial half

again registered a goal as the culmina
tion of a dribbling rush toward the
Allies goal by the Stanford forwards.
Another penalty goal kick by Blodget
ended the point winning, and made
the final score read: Stanford 4, Al
lies 0.
H. W. Maloney refereed during the
first half, turning over the whistle to
Donald Morrison, chairman of the ex
