# RUGBY MATERIAL OF SOUTH PRESAGES COMPETITION
## MANY EXPERIENCED STARS Veterans Are Reinforced and Aided by Galaxy of Good High School Players 
### 
Southern California will have one of
the strongest rugby contingents ever
put into the field this year by reason
of the number of veterans who have
signed up to play the open game, and
week at Los Angeles Riding Academy
who are now practicing three times
each week at Los Angeles Riding
Academy headquarters, and playing
a game every Saturday afternoon.
Graduate Manager Behrens has re
ceived a list of men who are out for
the Arden and Marathon teams, and
scrutiny of the southern aggregation
shows that the team which invades
the bay district from the south will
contain veterans of five or more years'
experience at the rugby game, both
with U. S. C., L. A. A. C., and high
school teams.
In the forward department, Frank
Toolan, probably the best hooker on
the Pacific Coast, and "Truck" Man
ning, stand out as stars, while many
other players well known in the south
are on the list. The average weight
of the scrum, judging from the can
didates for the forward berths, will
be more than one hundred and seventy
pounds.
In the backfield ara found lighter
men, but fast and experienced play
ers. Fred and Karl Haney, Paul Wil
son. "Mow" Mitchel, and "Dutch"
Blair bespeak speed and certainty in
the backfield actions. The fact that
they will be playing with players with
whom they have practised for several
years means a veteran backfield in
every respect.
At present the training the south
erners are going through each week
consists of practice in formations
every Saturday afternoon. In addi
tion to the present healthy squad now
appearing regularly for practice. Man
ager A. P. Michael Narlian expects
many other high school players to an
swer the call and report for duty soon.
