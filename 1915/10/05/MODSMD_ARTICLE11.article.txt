# MONTESSORI SYSTEM IS DISCUSSED BY ITS FOUNDER
## GUEST OF THE CHANCELLOR Advocates Laboratory of Child Study for the College Curriculum 
### 
Dr. Maria Montessori, founder of
the famous Montessori educational
system for children, visited Stanford
University today as the guest of Dr.
and Mrs. David Starr Jordan. Dr.
Montessori believes that her system
has a place in the curriculum of every
modern university and that university
students and professors should study
the Montessori sytem not as a prepa
ration for assuming teaching duties,
but as a psychological study to be
conducted along experimental labora
tory lines.
"Most laboratories of this class are
not real laboratories," said Madame
Montessori, "for the subject is lacking.
In the Montessori system the labora
tory is the school and the subjects,
the children, are right there."
Dr. Mont ssori criticised the present
day process of turning out teachers
as unfinished, the scientific study of
the subject of their future work, the
child, being omitted from Iheir course
of training.
"My system," said Madame Montes
sori, "can be looked on from the point
of view of the scientific laboratory for
the study of the child life. The way to
prepare children to be studied psy
chologically is to educate them."
That this psychological study of
children is similar to watching a cine
matographic performance, whereas
the usual laboratory studies are like
examining a photograph or lantern
slide, was another of Dr. Montessori's
statements when interviewed by a
Daily Palo Alto representative this af
ternoon. In this interview the words
of Madame Montessori, who spoke in
Italian, were translated by the pri
vate interpreter and companion who
accompanied her.
Dr. Jordan, who was present, clev
erly characterized the Montessori sys
tem as "elective education for chil
dren, just as university education in
Stanford is elective in nature for
young men and women."
Children are better and more quick
ly prepared for university work by
the Montessori system, claims its
