# FRESHMEN VERSUS PALO ALTO
## Baby Squad to Entertain Turf Fans Tomorrow 
### 
Finals in the series of three games
between Palo Alto high school and
the Stanford freshmen will he played
off tomorrow afternoon on the turf at
four-thirty.
The two previous games between
the hahy squads of the neighborhood
have been probably as good exhibi
tions of rugby as have been seen on
the Stanford turf this year, taking all
things into consideration, and it is ex
pected that a good number of fans will
grace the bleachers to see the last of
the string of contests.
A 10 to 4 defeat plus a. 11 to 3 defeat
is not enough to discourage a Palo
Alto high school squad, and the prep
school ruggers are planning to vindi
cate former scores chalked up against
them this year, by breaking up th?
freshmen possibilities of three in a
row. Practically, the same squads
will be used, it is announced, as were
seen in the last games of the two
teams.

Since the game of two weeks ago,
both teams have been stowing away
victories over similar line-ups, which
is just as much as saying that the
high school players and the first year
men are exceedingly well matched.
Season tickets or quarter dollars will
entitle fans to space on the planks
of the bleachers.
The probable line-ups:
Palo Alto High—Collier, Edwards,
front rank: Clark, lock; Woodward,
Hawley, middle rank; TO. Lodar, A.
Loder, rear rank; Angell, wing To
ward; Shone, half; Nagel, Sheldon,
I five-eighths; Morris, center; Green,
| Kirksey, wings: Pratt, fullback.
Stanford Freshmen—Flugel, Caugh
ey, Bacon, front rank; Swarts, Sum
merfi Id, middle rank; Poulware,
Zane, Janssen, rear rank; Davis, half;
