# Between Yawns
## 
### 
These crazy days that make you
wonder if it is still last summer or al
ready next winter, breed the most
irresponsible mixture of optimism and
resignation. Of a morning it is so
cold that the person who takes a
shower before breakfast has some
thing to brag about. Before noon,
temperature is so abundant in the
class rooms that you look up between
naps, and rake your brain to figure
out the identity of the old boy who
is holding forth on the platform.
Finally afternoon comes. About the
time you get well started at cursing
classes and reading references, and
professors, you yawn and look at the
alarm clock. It's nearly dinner time
then, and nothing done, but what's the
difference. So you put up the books.
In the evening you have a hangover
of the same complacent sort.
Well, we haven't a blanket cure to
suggest that will gladden the hearts
of our instructors. Tt is just some
calamity howling, written between
yawns, and doesn't make any attempt
toward solution.
Thanksgiving is coming, we tell
ourselves, and then we'll all have a
rest. So is Christmas, but a lot of
things not nearly so pleasant must
happen before. Examinations are
starting this week in full tilt. And
like other things, freshmen, examina
tions come and go. You and the rest
of us want to start off on the right
foot. Like so many other difficult
jobs, it has to be done.
