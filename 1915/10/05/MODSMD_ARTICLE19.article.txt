# New Campus Improvements Include Road to Lagunita
## 
### 
Among the new campus improve
ments which are in course of con
struction at the present time, is a rock
boulevard to extend from the short
road leading past the post office, to
Lagunita. This road, which will be
finished within a few weeks, is as yet
unnamed, but has already become
popular as an avenue on which to
build.
Within a few rods the university is
erecting a two story dwelling of nine
rooms, for whom is as yet a secret.
Aside from this, it is the plan to turn
the extremely ornamental, but thus
far useless glass domes removed from
the wings of the Chemistry building,
to some account. They will be con
verted, according to present intention,
into a conservatory for fine plants and
shrubs.
The ditch which is being dug in the
vicinity of the post office is also evi
dence of the constructive policy of the
university. Its purpose is to extend
the gas main from the Women's Club
house to connect number 2 and 4,
Lasuen.
