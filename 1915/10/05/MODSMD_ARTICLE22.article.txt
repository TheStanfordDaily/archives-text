# Muir Woods Production Proves to Be a Success
## Cardinal Players Score Hit in "Simoon," a Play of the Arabian Desert 
### 
A program consisting of three one
act plays in which the Cardinal play
ers of Stanford figured prominently,
assisting the Garnet Holme players
and the San Francisco Press Club was
rendered at Muir Woods Sunday.
"Our Career," produced by the Garnet
Holme cast under the management of
Mrs. D. F. Easton, dealt with familiar
incidents of college life and activities.
The Cardinal players, under the di
rection of Glenn Hughes, *IG, staged
"Simoon," a play in which the Ara
bian desert is made the scene of ac
tion. Miss Nellita Choate, '17, and
Gordon Davis, 'IS, both well known m
Stanford dramatic circles, took the
leading parts. Glenn Hughes acted
the part of "Yousseff," a desert sheik.
"My Turn Next," a farce in one act,
was given by the San Francisco Press
Club. The cast included many of
the most clever actors and actresses
around the bay. The scene of the play
depicted amusing happenings in front
of a San Francisco drug store.
More than one thousand people at
tended the production, being delighted
by the wonderful scenic trip to the
top of Mount Tamalpias, going to and
from Muir Woods. There is a possi
bility that "Simoon" will be repeated
in Palo Alto before a late date.
