questions of most importance to us
at the present time," said Dr. Mez, ad
dressing the women of Roble Club last
evening. "It is the duty of all women
to oppose war, and to stand firmly to
gether in their opposition, whether
in active public work or within their
homes. One of the greatest social
movements of the day is that for
peace, and it is nonsense to say that
little can be accomplished along this
line. Bertha Suttner, who was to
Austria what .lane Adams is to Amer
ica, says in her little book, "Lay Down
Your Arms," that if humanity will
stand together and say "No More
War," there will be no more. This lit
tle book is being read all over Ger
many today, and is eagerly sought by
the soldiers in the trenches who are
sick of war."
Dr. Mez announced that Jane Ad
ams will be in San Francisco to speak
before the Peace Conference which
will be held from the 10th to the 14th
of October in that city. An attempt
