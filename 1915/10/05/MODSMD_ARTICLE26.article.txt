# GERMAN PAPERS ARRIVE
## Library Receives Foreign Periodicals for Juneâ€”Others Expected Soon 
### 
Although intermittent, the supply of
periodicals from Germany for the
Stanford library has not entirely
ceased. The last consignment, re
ceived a few days ago, was made up
for the most part of weekly magazines
extending up to the month of June.
The periodicals for the summer
months are expected at any time.
All current literature from Ger
many is obtained through a central
agency in New York. Up to the time
of Italy's entrance into the war, the
New York agency maintained a branch
office in Leipzig and shipped maga
zines and periodicals through Ttaly
from that point. Although slow by
this route, the arrival of the literature
was assured. Since the entrance of
Italy on the side of the allies, Holland
furnishes the only port of exit.
The present German blockade, how
ever, does not seem to interfere with
the daily papers sent by mail. At no
time since the beginning of the war
has the Stanford library been without
the German dailies for any great
period.
