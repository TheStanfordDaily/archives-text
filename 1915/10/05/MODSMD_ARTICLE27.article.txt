the Blacks in the peanut league yes
terday afternoon "by a 10 to 0 score.
During the six innings played, the
Blacks had men on but twice, and
these were cut off by double plays.
The Whites did not hit hard, but hits
were obtained when most needed.
Shriver and Ryan had their eyes on
the ball, getting two bingles each.
Games are played on Monday, Tues
