"Hear the invisible choir," says one.
"It's only an Eyetalian organ
grinder," says another.
"You're both wiong," advises Dr.
Stolz, "That's only our new r phenom,
Knollin."
And passersby stop, look and lis
ten to E. R. Knollin a-playing the

squad how to dance the Spanish fan
dango and a few other concoctions of
the- god of terpsichore.

Wiggins, will be featured during the
intermission of the gym club dance,
