# Stanford Students Urged to Relieve Suffering Belgium
## Speakers Explain Present Needs of Relief Commission 
### 
An organized campaign to enlist
every Stanford student us a worker
for the relief of stricken Belgium was
started last evening. All members of
fraternities, clun houses and Encina
Hall were reached by a speaker while
special letters have been sent to stu
dents living off the campus.
Professor M. R. Kirkwood of the
Law department heads the movement
among the men of the university,
while the women are being ap
proached by Mrs. T. P. Russell of the
English department. Although the
tactics employed are dissimilar, the
result is expected to be the same. In
stead of relying on speakers to solicit
help for the Belgians, the campaign
among the women is to be waged by
a system of committees. After the
appointment of an original commit
tee by Mrs. Russell, this committee
will in turn choose others to act under
its direction.
The speakers at the fraternities and
Encina Hall attempted to make plain
the real conditions in Belgium as they
are given by the Belgian Relief Com
mission, of which TT. C. TToover,
is the head. The present apathy in
the United States concerning the fate
of the unfortunate Belgians was
shown to be unwarranted. Tt. was
pointed out that of the fifty million
dollars which has been spent under
the direction of the commission, only
six has been contributed by the United
States.
The above criticism was by no
means intended for the Stanford com
munity, which was declared to have
been most liberal in its contributions.
The point made, however, was that
before the winter is over peasants of
Belcium would be dying of starvation
if relief is not brought them. Every
one was urged to sign a card pledging
whatever contribution he feels able to
contribute.
