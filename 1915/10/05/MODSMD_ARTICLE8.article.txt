# SWORD AND SANDALS COMEDY DRAWS WELL
## Large Sent Sale Forecasts Success for First Dramatic Production of the Season 
### 
A long line of ticket buyers filed
past the Bookstore this noon when tlio
tickets for "Stop Thief" went on sale.
The pictures of the cast, were placed
in the windows on the Quad this
morning and an unusually well
staged production is promised.
"Stop Thief" promises to supply
combinations that will make a snappy
variety of mental sprinting necessary
to keep tip with them. The action
starts off with a dash in the first act,
gathers impetus in the second, in the
third gets its second wind, and ends
up with a final spurt of speed.
From the first part of the play,
where valuables disappear with dis
maying and trackless frequency, to
last, where they all reappear with
equal regularity, the action holds one
gasp-getter after another. With a
thief in th? play who adroitly pur
loins the watch of "the best detective
in Rhode Island," and another who
holds all of fifteen people at the point
of a pistol. with their thirty hands in
the air, it is no wonder that the timid
minister, played by J. IT. Russ?ll, '17,
earnestly longs for a bracing draught
of grape juice.
Tin ford Williams. '1(>, does remark
able character work in the part of the
gentleman crook, whose last piece of
professional work before h? strikes
the straight and narrow for Nell's
sake is the frame-up which supplies
the thrills and laughs for the evening.
A great part of Williams' acting in
this role is done when he has not a
line to say.
