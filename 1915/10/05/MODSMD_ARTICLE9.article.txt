# KREISLER PROGRAM APPEALS
## Noted Artist Will Play Wide Range of Selections at Thursday Concert 
### 
Fritz Kreisler's program for Thurs
day evening has been announced by
the Peninsula Musical Association.
The list of selections will appeal to
all. The Handel Sonata and Viotii
Concerto which open the program wiil
be appreciated especially by the musi
cians in the audience, while the re
maining two numbers will be broader
in their appeal.
The first two numbers will be new
to Kreisler's Stanford audience, as
they did not appear in the program
when he last played here. The ten
shorter selections which will conclude
the evening are of a more popular
nature. The favorite "Moment Musi
cal" by Schubert and Kreisler's own
delightful "Caprice Viennois" will b.3
two of the best known selections in
the last groups.
A new composition which Kreisler
has made popular with American au
diences is the charming Dvorak "In
dian Lament," which the violinist has
arranged for his chosen instrument.
With Mr. Kreisler conies Carl Lam
son, who was his accompanist at last
year's concert here. His sympathetic
work at the piano will be well remem
bered.
