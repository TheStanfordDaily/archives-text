# Sword and Sandals Cast to Stop Thief Friday Evening
## 
### 
"Stop Thief," shout fifteen people at
once in the third pet of the Sword and
Sandals play. TII3 funny part of it is
that the very same thief has been
wandering in their midst for some two
acts and this is tho first time that they
discover the distressing fact. Hut if
they were more perspicacious in the
first act there would have been no
play, Sword and Sandals would have
settled long ago on some serious
drama, and the college public would
have been robbed of their prospective
two hours of joy on Friday evening.
While the whole Carr family and
their friends are distractedly seeking
a solution for the alarming and intri
cate course events are taking, up to
the time the roll of bonds are found
in the chocolate pot and four one thou
sand dollar bills are unearthed from
the linen closet, the laughs come thick
and fast.
The thief, played by Buford Wil
liams, '16. who makes escapes and re
appearances in dazzling fashion, final
ly stops as requested and on his knees
with Xell adds one of the most neces
sary features of the happy ending.
During the course of the evening be
manages to transfer everything to
someone's else pocket, from the pock
etbook he leaves with the unseeing
minister to his own marriage license
which is found nn Dr. Willoughby.
The part of the minister, for which 0.
W. Hatch was originally cast, has
now been turned over to .T. H. Russell,
'17, who will doubtless prove equally
effective in the role.
