# DAILY TO POST WORLD'S SERIES REPORTS FRIDAY
## FIRST NEWS HERE AT ELEVEN Fans Will Enjoy the Inning by Inning News Service at D.P.A. Office 
### 
The first returns from the initial
game of the great world series, to be
played by the American Red Sox and
the National Phillies at Philadelphia
next Friday, may be seen posted in
front of the office of The Daily Palo
Alto about eleven o'clock Friday morn
ing, providing rain does not necessi
tate a postponement of the game.
By special arrangement with the
United Prass service, details of
each game will be given the campus
fans, from the first to the last play of
the series.
For the benefit of Palo Alto fans,
The Daily Palo Alto reports will be
posted at the Regent also.
Dope on the opposing teams is plen
tiful. On paper Carrigan's men have
the advantage over Moran's machine
in both the inner and outer gardens.
Philadelphia is relying on her pitch
ing staff to offset this theoretical han
dicap, with Alexander as her main
stay. It will be doubly necessary for
the Phil lie moundsmen to pitch better
ball than the Sox twirlers because of
the difference in the hitting power of
the two teams.
Boston has another apparent advan
tage in the fact that her line-up in
cludes eleven big series veterans,
while the Phillies are practically new.
