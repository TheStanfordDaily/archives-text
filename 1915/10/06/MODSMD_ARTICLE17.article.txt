# The 						Joyful Art (Of Giving)

### 
Some people on the campus say
they are convinced that the name of
sweet charity has been dragged in the
dust. And there aro weird philoso
phies abroad, to the effect that charity
begins at home, and others of those
old legends which we carry around so
often in the same pocket with our
wallets.
How much of that talk is penurious
piking, and how much of it is on the
level? Take the case of the fellow
next to you at the dinner table, who
conies out with a statement that every
donation to the Belgian or Polish fund
is a criminal neglect of poverty close
around us. We wonder if he should
be classed as a thoughtful citizen, or
as a poor imitation who is counting
the costs of his last excursion to the
city.
The problem presents itself baldly.
We know that the Associated Charities
are still on the job in San Francisco,
and in a thousand other parts of the
United States. And the Maude Booth
home for children in Palo Alto, be
sides. Human sympathy is sprinkled
according to scientific formula today,
and it is no trick at all to find out
where your dollar or dime will do good
work.
Can we then in the face of crying
poverty at home, justify our interest
in the relief ships that are going to
Europe? Has the meloldramatic ap
peal of the Belgian, and Polish horrors
got the best of our moral senses? Lots
of people roundabout say it has.
Frankly, a great many of those people
would be the last to give a penny or
an old coat either at home or abroad.
We mustn't ignore the claims of
needy people near at home. But that
isn't a license for ignoring the suffer
ing millions in Europe. The help we
can give both is worthy.
Personally or editorially, whichever
it is, we believe that the Stanford man
or woman who deposits his mite for
the Belgians, is going to beat the other
fellow by several laps when it conies
time to race down to the post office,
and mail his monthly subscription to
the home missionary society.
So if your ability to give is limited
to our own United States, fire away,
and we pray that you will be blessed
as you deserve. But don't say you are
ag'in the Belgians on principle.
