## Fifteen Shouts Bring Clever Burglar to Halt 
### 
The little woman who put the gai in
gaiety, and who made all San Fran
cisco and the exposition sit up and
take notice of hsr classic and modern
dancing, dropped in unexpectedly 011
a rehearsal of "Stop Thief" last night
and clapped her hands in delight at
the Sword and Sandal staging of the
New York comedy. Mile. Louise La
(Jai enjoys th? distinction of being the
only dancer who appeared by request
on an exposition platform.
She was on a tour of the Peninsula
last evening and found time to peek
over the Assembly Hall footlights. She
was liberal in her praise of the Stan
ford actors, and labeled their efforts
unusually brilliant for amateur talent.
Mile. La Gai, with a charming French
accent, broke forth in a series of su
perlatives regarding the beauties of
the Quad, which stood out wierdly
against the black sky.
