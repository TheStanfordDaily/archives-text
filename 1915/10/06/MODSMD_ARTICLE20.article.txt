Oregon Faculty
Threatens Athletics
The University of Oregon is threat
ened with complete isolation as far as
intercollegiate athletic relations with
other institutions go. The faculty is
seriously considering the proposition
of restricting all athletics to that of
strictly an interclass nature.
It is rumored that trouble is brew
ing for the University of Washington
owing to the fact that in order to have
room for two games with California
it was necessary to drop Oregon from
her list. The northern colleges want
Washington to compete nearer home.
It is said that Idaho, backed by the
smaller colleges, is threatening to re
fuse to compete with Washington un
less Oregon is put back on her list.

Women Handicapped
Because the women of the fresh
man class seemed too important, the
women's sophomore student council
of the University of Montana met and
imposed the following regulations:
All freshmen girls shall wear
"frosh" green ribbon, at all times, in
all places, 011 every occasion;
Freshmen who wish to display ths
pictures of men shall do so only on
condition that these pictures be pinned
to the curtain and that said picture
be labelled with the correct name, age,
and relationship.

Washington
Coacli Connibear of the University
of Washington crew, will have a hard
time turning out either a freshman or
a varsity crew that will compare fa
vorably with crews of the past. Of
the first year men, only nine of them
weigh over 150 pounds, while the var
sity crew will have only five veterans
back, only three of these being 011 last
season's eight.

from the British war office, announc

year, will be allowed the option of re
turning and completing their college
work. The demand in the present war
for fully qualified doctors appears to
be very great.

Oregon Faculty
Threatens Athletics
The University of Oregon is threat

owing to the fact that in order to have
room for two games with California
it was necessary to drop Oregon from
her list. The northern colleges want

It is said that Idaho, backed by the
smaller colleges, is threatening to re
