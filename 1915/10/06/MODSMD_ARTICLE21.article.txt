April is the poem "By Grace of Bat
tle," the work of Frank Ernest Hill,
'11, instructor in the English depart
ment. The poem follows:
I.
The oak, the sweep of hill, the early
stars
Set in the golden pallor of the sky,
The dimming globes of cloud above
the stars,
The smell of earth.
The bird-calls, and the wonder things
should lie
So silently—O, what a nameless birth!
Too near to God, too wonderful to die —
Beautiful, beautiful!
It.
The oak, the sweep of hill, the stars,
the clouds,
The smell of earth, and on the earth
the shift
Of blood-daubed limbs, and staring
at the clouds
Faces, —stark grey;
And shattered trunks that have no
eyes to lift,
And crying birds and feebly cringing
prey—
Both cursing Death because it is not
swift!
Horrible, horrible!
