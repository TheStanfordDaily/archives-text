# Fritz Kreisler Comes to Stanford from War
## Famous Violinist's Pictures Are Being Sold to Aid Destitute Musicians 
### 
Tomorrow evening the most beloved
of violinists, Fritz Kreisler, will make
his bow before an audience which fills
the Assembly Hall to the doors. Ever
since the boy Kreisler first toured the
United States the artist's visits to this
country, have been a veritable series
of triumphs. Hut this year he comes
back to us from the war zone and thB
remembrance that he might never have
come again gives his art a new ap
preciation for us.
Mr. Kreisler on this trip is endeavor
ing to help the many destitute musi
i cians of his native city by giving his
j admirers opportunity to obtain his au
! tographed photo and sending the
money thus procured back to Vienna
to aid his fellow artists. The photo
graphs may be obtained at the con
cert, and the proceeds will be used
for the aid of musicians of all nation-
I alities who are now in Vienna.
Kreisler's program will include two
typically Viennese numbers, his own
"Caprice Viennois," and an arrange
j ment of a Viennese popular song,
j Since the war Kreisler's nationality
seems so much more a part of his per
sonality that these purely Austrian
numbers will assume an added inter
est. The concert will begin punctu
ally at 8: in, and all not in their seats
by then will be obliged to wait until
the completion of the first number.
