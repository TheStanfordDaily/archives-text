# KICK-OFFS
## 
### 
Captain Danny Carroll will "take
things easy" for the next few games,
according to reports, to get his ankle
in condition for regular rugby. How
ever, the captain's help among re
cruits for the team will prove as valu
able as his speed and accuracy at the
center three-quarter position.
Freshmen and the third varsity in
dulged in an impromptu fray yester
day afternoon on the turf. The new
men have improved in strength so far
that they demonstrated their ability to
show the third varsity some new
stunts.
Line-outs, backfield against back-
Held, and scrum against scrum, will
lie the program for the next two after
noons to get the rugby squads in trim
for the series of games scheduled Sat
urday.
