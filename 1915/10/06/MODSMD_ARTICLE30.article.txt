# Peanut League Ball Game Is Close
## 
### 
One of the best games of the sea
son was played on the varsity diamond
yesterday afternoon. The Blacks,
with Stevens, varsity shortstop, in the
box, defeated the Whites by a 3 to 2
score. The game was hard fought
from the start, and the final result
was always in doubt. Clark, for the
losers, pitched good ball but was not
accorded good support. There was lit
tle hitting on either side. The next
peanut league game will lie played
Thursday.
