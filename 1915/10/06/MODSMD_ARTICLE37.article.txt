# UNKNOWN MARAUDERS ENTER LAGUNITA AND REDWOOD BOAT HOUSES
## Rowing Machines Are Disabled by Removal of Brass Castingsâ€”Oars Missing 
### 
Thieves not long ago entered the
boat houses at Redwood and Lagunita,
removing therefrom student body
property valued at approximately $50.
The greatest damage resulting from
a visit of the crew enthusiasts was
the loss of two large brass castings
which were taken bodily from the new
Spaulding rowing machines in the La
gunita boat house. These castings
weighed fifteen pounds each and
would possibly have brought a dollar
a pound for the brass in them.
Two oars, practically new, consti
tuted the main property loss from the
Redwood establishment. The buglars
entered the place after chopping a
hole in the roof. It was through this
aperture that the two oars were re
moved. Members of the crew ex
pressed heartfelt thankfulness that
the new shell was still interned at
Poughkeepsie, as that also might have
been appropriated as a souvenir of the
Eastern regatta.
