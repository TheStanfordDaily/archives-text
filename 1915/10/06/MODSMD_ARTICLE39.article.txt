# Freshman Native Sons in Minority
## 
### 
From the cards filed in the office of
the Student Adviser, it is observed
that eight different nations, excluding
America, are represented by the men
of the freshman class. The various
nations contributing to the foreign ele
ment. in the class are: Canada, 5;
Brazil, 1; Alaska, 2; Hawaiian
Islands, 1; Mexico, 1; China, 4;
Philippine Islands, 2; Japan, 1. This,
together with the fact that from the
255 on file, out of 100 new men. there
are 160 from outside the stale, shows
the prestige that the University has
beyond the boundaries of Californ'a.
