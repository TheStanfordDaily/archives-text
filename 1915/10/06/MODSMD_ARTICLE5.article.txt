## 
### 
Forty-eight of Uncle Sam's jackies
stopped over for an inspection of tlie
Quad this morning, while on an auto
mobile tour of the Peninsula. Two
battleships, the South Dakota and th?
Oregon, and two cruisers, the
Milwaukee and Denver, were repre
sented in the aggregation of sailors.
It was originally planned to accord a
welcome to the visitors to the Quad,
and a postponement of the naval out
ing caused disappointment on the cam
pus. Today's arrival was unexpected,
and gave no opportunity for a stu
dent body gathering.
