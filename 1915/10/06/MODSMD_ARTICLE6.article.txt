# STANFORD-SANTA CLARA GAME SLATED FOR EWING FIELD
## MODERATE PRICES TO PREVAIL University Representatives Hold Meeting at Olympic Club to Decide Issues 
### 
Representatives of Santa Clara and
Stanford holding forth informally at
the Olympic Club yesterday evening
unanimously agreed to stage the title
rugby match at Ewing field, San Fran
cisco. Prices for pasteboards to the
coast football classic have been set
at one dollar for members of the two
student bodies, and a dollar and a
half for the general public. Next No
vember 13 will mark the first time
since 1903 that the Bay City has been
the scene of any intercollegiate
contest.
Ewing Field was constructed last
year at high cost by the owners of the
San Francisco Coast League ball
club, and so represents a well planned,
modern plant. Recreation Park was
judged out of the question on account
of its small size and seating capacity.
Preparations are already well under
way to commence immediately on the
work of putting the field in good con
dition. Correct estimates place the
seating capacity of Ewing field at
twenty thousand, with plenty of space
for standing room. Boxes each con
taining room for eight are to be put
on sale for twenty dollars apiece to
conveinence San Francisco society.
Decision was also reached by the
joint committee last night that each
university should hold its pre game
rally in the city the evening before
the big game. Arrangements are be
ing made so that Santa Clara rooters
may make the St. Francis their hom?,
while the Palace has been set aside for
Stanford.
The group that met last night at the
Olympic Club were Father Joseph Mc-
Quide, chairman, Chief of Police
White, Managers E. C. Behrens and L.
T. Milburn, of Stanford and Santa
Clara, George Presley. Jimmie Lana
gan, Doc Burbank, Father White, mod
erator of athletics at Santa Clara,
Martin V. Merle, Frank Hennessy, and
Rob rt Flood. This same committee
of eleven will supervise all arrange
ments for the intercollegiate match
and incidental features.
