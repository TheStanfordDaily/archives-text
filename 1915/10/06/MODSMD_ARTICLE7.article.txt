# 1918 Jolly-Up Date Set
## Stunts and Dancing to be Feature on Night of October 15 
### 
Innovations galore are to feature
the annual sophomore jolly-up to be
given at the Gymnasium on the even
ing of October 15, according to plans
perfected at a meeting of the commit
tee, headed by 11. X. Stiver, '18, held
at the Cardinal Club last night.
All sophomores, together with the
transfer women and those of the
freshman class, will be jollied into
good humor by the apple cider, dough
nuts, and cones to be served. Stunts
and short sketches have also been pro
vided for, and a three-piece orchestra
will furnish the music for the dance.
In order that the modest among the
1918 people will have a good time,
each person will have a name tag for
introduction.
