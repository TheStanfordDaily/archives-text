# ANTIPODES TRIP PLANS MATURING, SAYS REV. MULLINEAUX
## EXPECT TO TAKE FORTY MEN Visit Will Be the First Rugby Invasion of South by Americans 
### 
That plans for the trip of two Amer
ican teams to the Antipodes are now
actively under way, and that it is
merely a question of getting teams
to oppose two American squads, once
they are sent over to Australia, is the
substance of a letter received by The
Daily Palo Alto from Reverend M. Mul
lineaux, who has charge of the pro
posed expedition.
According to Reverend Mullineaux,
his friend, an Oxford scholar who
wishes to pay the expenses of forty
players to Australia and New Zealand,
would like the trips to start during
the coming year, but if they are pre
vented in 1916 by the present war,
which has practically devoided the
Antipodes of rugby material, the
same offer will be made again next
year.
Anxious to Wet Teams Started
The donor of the fund to send the
two teams to Australia is anxious to
get the trips under way, and has in
structed Reverend Mullineaux to com
municate with New Zealand and Aus
tialian rugby officials. This he has
done, and it is expected that the status
of conditions will be known as soon
as a reply is received, probably in the
course of a month or six weeks.
Ilenefactor Is Modest
Speaking of the Oxford man who is
willing to pay the expenses of a high
school and a coll?ge team to the south,
Reverend Mullineaux says:"I don't
think the public will ever know the
name of the man in question. He is
a very quiet man and hates notoriety."
"Thsre is a letter on the way to New
Zealand rugby men telling them of
the offer, and asking for the views of
Australia as well as their own. When
things are in shape, I shall lay the
matter before the Rugby Union here.
"My friend thinks a visit would be
very welcome after the war, and is of
the opinion that the games would be
even, as the colonies have lost so
many prominent players.
"It is hoped that double headers will
be played twice a week, with an occa
sional third match, thus giving the
game a stimulus that cannot be ob
tained in any other way."
Reverend Mullineaux's friend is now
on his way to England, but expects to
lie back on the Pacific Coast about
Christmas time, when lie will arrange
details of the Australian-New Zealand
trips, provided they can be undertaken
in the spring or summer of 1916.
