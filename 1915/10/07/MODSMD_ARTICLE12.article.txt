Plans were set on foot by the Execu
tive Committee at its meeting last
svening, for a university dance to be
given in the near future, the proceeds
of which will be used to help defray
the expenses of a football training
table. D. B. Carroll, '16, J. R. Braden,
'lfi, and F. P. Walker, *18, were ap
pointed to arrange details, and fix an
appropriate time and place. Friday,
October 15, was suggested as a prob
able date, the only thing scheduled for
that evening being the sophomore
jolly-up. if this is chosen, the sopho
more class will be asked to change the
time for its dance. It is likely that the
new gymnasium will be the scene of
the dance, although nothing definite
has been decided.
