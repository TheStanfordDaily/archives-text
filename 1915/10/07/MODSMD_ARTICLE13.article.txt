# WILL BULLETIN WORLD'S SERIES
## Play by Play Service Begins Tomorrow at Eleven 
### 
All arrangements have been com
pleted by The Daily Palo Alto for the
best of World Series service, begin-

ning tomorrow morning about eleven
o'clock and following the games
through until the last play. An opti
mistic v!ew is taken by the Weather
Man's attitude, and there seems to be
little doubt but that the game will be
gin on Friday, as scheduled. Boston
played yesterday, displaying fine form

, and taking a double header from New
York. Both teams are in fine fettle, and
! there seems to be no doubt but that

the series will be a scrap
py one, There is not the
slightest evidence of any
such mental and physical
slump as caused the Ath
letics to lose four straight
games to the Boston
Braves last year.
With Alexander pitch
ing the first game for the
Phillies, odds seem to be
somewhat in favor of Mo
ran's machine for the op-

ening battle. Paper dope has lost
some of of its influence with the bet
ting fans and odds for the series are
not a great deal against the Quaker
City team. Last year's series did much
to upset confidence placed in statistics,
while this fact and Alexander are.
making the bets about even.
