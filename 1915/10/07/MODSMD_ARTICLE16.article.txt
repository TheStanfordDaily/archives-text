# What Verdict?
## 
### 
The proposal of the recently retired
student affairs committee for 8 o'clock
classes, which was indorsed by the
Women's Conference last evening, will
rouse heated discussion pro and con.
The values and disadvantages of the
suggested change are decidedly debat
able, and The Daily Palo Alto will
welcome printed discussion.
Briefly, the revised program of the
day would be: first period, S:00 to
8:50; second period, 9:00 to 9:50;
recess, 9:50 to 10:30; third period,
10:30 to 11:20; fourth period, 11:30
to 12:20.
First thought brands the proposal
as an attempt at freak regulation. The
adverse critic will decry the early ris
ing time, and will discount the benefit
of a mid-morning intermission. It is
too short a time to permit transaction
of class or committee business, ad
dresses, or other profitable occupation.
Back answers the advocate that 8
o'clock is the regular and accepted
hour for beginning the day in the busi
ness world, lie also maintains with
some ability that class nominations,
elections, many committee meetings
might be disposed of in the morning,
and so clear the evenings of super
abundant work. Not only that, but
many departmental lectures might be
held during the intermission, which
are now impossible because there is
uo available time for meeting.
Acceptance or rejection of the plan
will rest finally with the Academic
Council. General expressions before
that time will be useful, and there is
much to be said on both sides.
