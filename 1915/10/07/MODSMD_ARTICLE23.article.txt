### 
Stanford debaters are rapidly round
ing into shape for the intercollegiate
contests a month hence with the Uni
versity of California and the Univer
sity of Southern California.
F. E. Hill, '11, instructor in the Eng
lish department, and K. E. Leib, '15,
chairman of the intercollegiate debat
ing committee, are drilling the two
groups which comprise the squad of
seven men chosen in the recent tryout.
Practice debates 011 various phases of
the question picked for the intercolle
giate debates are being held several
times a week.
Friday evening in the English semi
nar room of the Library, the two
groups will oppose each other 011 the
question, "Resolved, That governments
can finance railroads more efficiently
than private corporations."
Final Acceptance 01' Date
Leib has received a letter from the
the University of California in final
acceptance of Friday evening, Novem
ber 12, as the date for the debate. The
exact San Francisco auditorium in
which the annual forensic contest will
be staged is to be selected this week
end when- the student debating pow
ers of the two universities will hold
a conference. As the usual large au
dience is expected, and as this will
be the only field in which Stanford
and the University of California are to
meet this year, it will be necessary to
pick an auditorium with sufficient
seating capacity.
A tentative list of judges for the
Stanford-California debate will be
submitted to Stanford by California in
a few clays.
