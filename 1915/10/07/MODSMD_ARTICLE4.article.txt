# Chappie Sallies Forth in Gay Style Tomorrow
## October Birthday Issue Contains Full Ballast of Deadly Laughing Gas 
### 
Weighted down with a full ballast of
laughing gas. Chaparral will cast off
tomorrow morning and go sailing
down the Quad with birthday greet
ings and inside information regarding
Pan-Hellenic for all. Chappie's inside
information this month, both for qual
ity and quantity, has never been
equalled. Every bit of available space
has been utilized. Even the usual dil
ettante has given way to smaller bits
of humor that may be swallowed at
a gulp.
The front page birthday poem is
from the pen of Glenn Hughes, '16. and
is entitled. "Sixteen Years Ago." Peg
Murray's first Snoppy Quop makes its
appearance in an exhibition of art
that may remind someone of a duty
that they slighted that very morning.
Unusually clever and numerous are
the drawings that stand out in Chap
parral's October pages. Promising
new artists are coming to light in fas
ter order than in the past. A double
page cut, labled "Chappie's Salon of
Exposition Art," features a "nude de
scending a well known campus stair
way," and "a study of a young girl."
The Salon work is by artists of na
tional reputation.
Art Editor Murray has masterfully
executed a cover that stands supreme.
Upon reflection, any person that gazes
upon the same may rightfully blush,
although the drawing is modesty per
sonified.
The advertising pages reveal, among
other things, a startling announce
ment regarding a favorite who will
soon grace the Assembly Hall stage.
