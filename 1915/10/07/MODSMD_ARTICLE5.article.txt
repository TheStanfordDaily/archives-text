# Frown on Grabbing of Preps
## Skull and Snakes Will Apportion Visiting Athletes 
### 
That the spider attitude toward prep
school flies which is being assumed
by some of the fraternities on the
campus must be discontinued, was the
opinion of the members of the Execu
tive Committee, expressed last last
night. It seems that some of the
houses have an idea that they must
afford entertainment for all the likely
high school men who come to Stan
ford on visiting athletic teams, and
with that end in view have gathered
them Into their respective folds in
great numbers.
The entertainment of these men is
in the hands of a committee of Skull
and Snakes, and any interference
with its arrangements work disadvan
tage to Stanford. Each fraternity will
be allotted a certain number to care
for when occasion demands and must
confine itself to the entertainment of
that number in the future.
