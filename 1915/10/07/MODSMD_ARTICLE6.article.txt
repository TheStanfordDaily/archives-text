# START FIRST CLASS AT EIGHT, WOMEN'S NEW PLAN
## WOULD HAVE A DAILY RECESS Conference Wants Forty Minutes Every Morning Devoted to Recreation 
### 
Beginning of classes at eight o'clock
in order to gain a free period in the
middle of the morning, was indorsed
by the Women's Conference and a
number of women students present at
the Conference meeting held last even
ing in the Women's Clubhouse. The
following extraction from a letter sub
mitted by the Committee on Student
Affairs appointed last May, was read
and discussed before the vote was
taken.
"In order to make way for closer
relations among all groups of stu
dents, we recommend that the sche
dule of hours be so readjusted that
the forty minutes from 9:30 to 10:30
a. m. be kept free from any regular
university lectures. This could be ac
complished by opening the day's work
at 8:00 o'clock and closing at 12:20.
