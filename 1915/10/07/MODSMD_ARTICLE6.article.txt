# START FIRST CLASS AT EIGHT, WOMEN'S NEW PLAN
## WOULD HAVE A DAILY RECESS Conference Wants Forty Minutes Every Morning Devoted to Recreation 
### 
Beginning of classes at eight o'clock
in order to gain a free period in the
middle of the morning, was indorsed
by the Women's Conference and a
number of women students present at
the Conference meeting held last even
ing in the Women's Clubhouse. The
following extraction from a letter sub
mitted by the Committee on Student
Affairs appointed last May, was read
and discussed before the vote was
taken.
"In order to make way for closer
relations among all groups of stu
dents, we recommend that the sche
dule of hours be so readjusted that
the forty minutes from 9:30 to 10:30
a. m. be kept free from any regular
university lectures. This could be ac
complished by opening the day's work
at 8:00 o'clock and closing at 12:20.
The resulting forenoon schedule would
be as follows:
First period, 8:00 to 8:50.
Second period, 9:00 to 9:50.
Assemblies, 9:50 to 10:30.
Third period, 10:30 to 11:20.
Fourth period, 11:30 to 12:20.
The principal argument against this
measure was the crowded condition of
libraries and rest rooms which would
result when there were no assemblies,
but it was decided to leave this prob
lem to the faculty. It is believed that
if the students as a whole want this
change it will go through, but will not
be put into practice until next fall.
This is the first, open meeting held
by the Women's Conference. It is a
step toward giving the women of the
university a clearer idea of the scope
and working of their part of student
government. This was done in order
to make clearer to the women the
duties and responsibilities of the rep
resentatives whom they elect to the
conference.
