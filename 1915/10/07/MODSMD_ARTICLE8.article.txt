# Campus to Dance for Rugby Training Table
## 
### 
Definite arrangements have
l>e?n made for the holding of the
football benefit dance in the
gymnasium on Friday evening,
October 15. All profits derived
from the affair will be used to
help pay the expenses of the
training table. Some time ago
the sophomore class was given
the gymnasium on this evening
for their jolly-up, but if
possible, that date will now
be changed. Members of the
football squad will be permitted
to break training to the extent
of two hours of dancing on the
evening of the benefit entertain
ment. but will have to stop
promptly at 10 o'clock. The
Stanford Band has offered to co
operate to the extent of furnish
ing the music free of charge.
