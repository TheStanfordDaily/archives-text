# KREISLER IS MASTER OF ART
## Concert This Evening Will Be Broad in Appeal 
### 
Fritz Kreisler's program for this
evening at the Assembly Hall is iden
tical with that which he played last
Sunday for his opening concert in
San Francisco. Sunday afternoon at
the Cort proved one of the most de
cided triumphs for any musician in the
history of San Francisco music. It is
a typical Kreisler program which has
been arranged for this evening. The
selections include a balance of classic
and lighter numbers, thus insuring
a broad appeal.
Kreisler has long been ranked
among the greatest violinist of our
day. There are those who will claim
for Kubalik a greater technical excel
lence. and those who will attribute to
Elman a greater depth and strength
of interpretation. Hut Fritz Kreisler
stands alone in his capacity for feeling
and dramatic expression, while his ad
mirers will admit of none who sur
pass him in perfection of technique.
Unlike many artists who are con
tinually before the public, Kreisler
does not refuse to play the lighter
numbers which his audiences have
learned to love through his interpre
tation. His method of encoring is the
pleasing fashion of repeating the num
ber which won his hearers' en
thusiasm.
On his last visit to San Francisco,
lie played his "Caprice Viennois"
three times before his audience would
allow him to continue his program.
This same number he played twice in
Sunday's concert at the Cort, finally
responding to the clamor of applause
with the "Humoresque," always a fa
vorite with Kreisler admirers.
