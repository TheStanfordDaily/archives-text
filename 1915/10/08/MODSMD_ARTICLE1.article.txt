# SIX RUGBY GAMES ARE SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW
## VARSITY TO MEET BARBARIANS First Year Fifteen Ready to Contest With Berkeley High Aggregation 
### 
Six games will be the contribution
of the Stanford rugby department to
meet the demands of fans tomorrow,
five games on the home turf and one
at San Mateo.
The feature match of the day will
be between the varsity and the Bar
barians. It will be scheduled about
three o'clock at| home'. In the last
contest between the Barbs and the
varsity the former were in too poor
condition to put up an effective resist
ance. However, several new men have
been drafted into the club line-up, and
it is also probable that the Barbarians
will be strengthened by union with
another well known squad from the
bay district. In case this consolidation
takes placei in time for tomorrow's
game, the bleachers will be treated to
an even contest.
Varsity Practically rneiianged
The varsity line-up will be the same
as that of last week-end game, except
that Swigart will open the game in
place of Dievendorff at wing. Joe Ur
ban and Long, freshman, will hold
down five-eighths as they did last Sat
urday.
Freshmen will charge on the Berke
ley high school squad again for the
opening game of the afternoon. A
heavy Berkeley scrum means that the
freshmen will probably have to play a
different style of game from that they
have been successfully carrying out in
the last few contests. No change has
been made in the freshman line-up
over that of last Wednesday.
The final attraction of the after
noon will be between St. Ignatius and
the second varsity on the home turf.
The St. Ignatius players gave the
freshmen the hardest tussel they have
had this season a week ago, and can
be counted on to put up a lively and
fighting game against the All-Blacks,
both teams depending to a large ex
tent on thei work of their forwards
to determine results.
In the morning Oakland Technical
school players, not strangers here, will
demonstrate Jimmy Thoburn's rugby
theories, this time to the third varsity
squad. One other gam© between the
so called Stanford Pinks, or fourth
varsity, and Fremont high school will
open the day's pigskin festivities. A
squad from the peannt league will
journey down to San Mateo to meet
the high school team of that center.

game, the bleachers will be treated to
an even contest.
Varsity Practically rneiianged
The varsity line-up will be the same
as that of last week-end game, except
that Swigart will open the game in
place of Dievendorff at wing. Joe Ur
ban and Long, freshman, will hold
down five-eighths as they did last Sat
urday.
Freshmen will charge on the Berke
ley high school squad again for the
opening game of the afternoon. A
heavy Berkeley scrum means that the
freshmen will probably have to play a
different style of game from that they
have been successfully carrying out in
the last few contests. No change has
been made in the freshman line-up
over that of last Wednesday.
The final attraction of the after
noon will be between St. Ignatius and
the second varsity on the home turf.
The St. Ignatius players gave the
freshmen the hardest tussel they have
had this season a week ago, and can
be counted on to put up a lively and
fighting game against the All-Blacks,
both teams depending to a large ex
tent on thei work of their forwards
to determine results.
In the morning Oakland Technical
school players, not strangers here, will
demonstrate Jimmy Thoburn's rugby
theories, this time to the third varsity
squad. One other gam© between the
so called Stanford Pinks, or fourth
varsity, and Fremont high school will
open the day's pigskin festivities. A
squad from the peannt league will
journey down to San Mateo to meet
the high school team of that center.
The line-ups follow:
Varsity—Bihlman, Soper, Knight
(Rehm, Smitherum), front rank;
Rehm, Jacomini (Dubendorf, Fisher),
middle rank; W.vlie, Halsted,
Braden (Scott), rear rank; Erb
(Walker), half; Urban, Long (Swi
gart), five-eighths; Carroll, center;
Templeton, Swigart (Dievendorff),
wings; Templeton (Erb), fullback.
Freshmen —Flugel, Caughey, Bacon
(Meese), front rank; Swarts, Sum
merfield (Janssen), middle rank;
Boulware, Zane, Bonney (Flood), rear
rank; Davis, half; Katten, Boydston,
five eighths; Pelonze (Smith), center;
Morris, Stephens (Sheedy, Wagner),
wings; Rogers, fullback.
Second varsity—Single, Kellogg,
Sample (Scovel), front rank;
Hoover, Coleman (Krehbiel), middle
rank; Chandler, Murray, Johnson
(Fisher), rear rank; Townsend (Malt
bv), half; Greve, Gladstone, five
eighths; Hammon (Hayes), center;
Wallace, E. Hacon (Heron), wings;
West, fullback.
Third varsity—Nesbit, Curtice, Kin
ney (Owen, Sayre), front rank; Stead
man, Hough (Dean), middle rank;
Wood, Bowes. Brinkmeyer (Earl, Neu
ner), rear rank; Ilauser (Phillips),
half; Dickey, Henry (Jeffers), five
eighths; Lyttle, center; Phillips,
Ames (Brandt, Graham), wings; Mc-
Cormack, fullback.
Six games will be the contribution
of the Stanford rugby department to
meet the demands of fans tomorrow,
five games on the home turf and one
at San Mateo.
The feature match of the day will
be between the varsity and the Bar
barians. It will be scheduled about
three o'clock at| home'. In the last
contest between the Barbs and the
varsity the former were in too poor
condition to put up an effective resist
ance. However, several new men have
been drafted into the club line-up, and
it is also probable that the Barbarians
will be strengthened by union with
another well known squad from the
bay district. In case this consolidation
takes placei in time for tomorrow's
game, the bleachers will be treated to
an even contest.
