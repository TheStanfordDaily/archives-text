# A 						Nervous Job
## 
### 
Every once in a while somebody
comes through with a big bundle of
public spirit, but forgets to put the
return address on it, so that the cam
pus wouldn't know whom to thank
even if it wanted to take the trouble.
That is just what the sophomore class
has done, and these fireworks are set
off by way of appreciation.
Of course you are wise, and when
ever you see anybody throwing bou
quets around like a million dollars
in stage money, you wonder what's the
reason. Just this: We've got to make
a request of the Roble girls, and it
takes such an unholy lot of nerve that
we want them to be in a good humor.
Because if they can be made to think
the community will be grateful, the
favor will be grantedâ€”just like that.
Listen to the story of the sopho
mores: They had their hearts set on
a class jolly-up that was to be staged
next Friday evening. It was going to
be a great affair, and the high lights
were already painted in. But that was
the only possible date for a football
dance. Later in the month, the var
sity squad coudn't have attended. And
Stanford people are sadly in need of
the zip that party will afford.
The sophomores have not grumbled
about the disaster to their own little
private party. They are strong for
the team, like the rest of us, and any
thing goes with them. But they need
the money that jolly-up would have
brought. Because this show called
"Bobby Burnit," scheduled for Novem
ber 5, is going to put a kink in their
bank roll. At any rate it might, if
the house isn't filled.
Now then, Roble has something to
say about the rest of this, and we don't
want to slip anything over. If the sec
ond year class might hold its jolly-up
November 6, the evening following the
play, plenty of money would roll in,
apd wo could have a lively sophomore
week-end. Because the jolly-up would
be an open party.
We know November 6 is the night
for the Roble Formal, and that it is a
closed date, unless you Roble people
want to help out. The sophomores
were swindled out of their date, for the
good of the rugby team, and for the
health of Stanford enthusiasm. Can't
you share November P> with them? It's
their only chance.
