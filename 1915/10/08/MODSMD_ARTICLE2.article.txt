# Fritz Kreisler Charms With Perfection of Art
## Artists' Own Compositions Won Especial Favor With Concert Audience Last Evening 
### 
Fritz Kreisler's personality is com
pelling, but his music is great from its
very independence of his own nature.
It is a thing impersonal and unfet
tered, and in its freedom lies its great
ness.
The first number of last evening's
program was Handel's A Major sonata,
followed by a brilliant Tartini Fugue,
characterized by a captivatingly defi
ant swing.
A .Minor Concerto Best
The finest number of the evening
was undoubtedly the A Minor Con
certo by Viotti. It possessed all the
capacity for tenderness; all the fire
and abandon that we remember in the
Kreisler of the years before there
was war to call him from his music.
This concerto made tremendous de
mands upon the man at the piano, and
Mr. Damson was not disappointing.
He brought from his instrument all
the color that an orchestra might lend
to the background for the master's
violin.
ftodowski Opens Third Group
A plaintive Godowsky number op
ened the third group on the program.
This was followed by Kreisler's treat
ment of a Beethoven theme. The
shimmering fairv-like swing of this
won such favor that the violinist
played it over before proceeding to
the next number. After the yearning
Mendelssohn "Song Without Words"
came Schubert's ever popular "Musical
Moment," which was again demanded
twice by the audience. Chopin's "Ma-
zurka" was delightfully graceful in
execution. Another number which the
artist was forced by the continued
applause to repeat was his own ar
rangement of a Chaminade serenade,
which through its sheer charm made
us forget that Kreisler was showing
an almost incredible technical perfec
tion in his execution of the high notes
at the conclusion. Kreisler's playing
never descends to the level of a mere
display of acrobatic technique. He
makes us forget the medium of ex
ecution in the music itself.
Liefoesfreud Final Encore
The beautiful "Indian Lament," by
Dvorak, showed the insight into the
life of the red man which made the
new world symphony possible. Fol
lowing his arrangement of a Vien
nese popular song and Granados
Spanish dance, Kreisler played his
own Caprice Viennois. Under his
bow the instrument seemed to fling
out the very spirit of Vienna. As a
final encore he gave the favorite
"Liebesfreud."
