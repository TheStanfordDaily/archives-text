# RUGBY MEN NOT IN GAMES MUST FIND BLEACHER SEATS
## 
### 
All men who are not scheduled to
play in the Wednesday sanies are ex
pected to keep off the inner turf, ac
cording to instructions issued by
Coach Floyd Brown yesterday. Com
plaints have been made by fans from
the bleachers that men passing up
and down along the side lines obstruct
the view, and this, added to interfer
ence with the freshman game, has
been the cause of the order that all
men who wish to practice on Wednes
day must go to the outside field, or
find space in the bleachers while teams
are competing on the turf.
