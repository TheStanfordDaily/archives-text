# Cotillion of Class of 1918 Is Set for Thanksgiving Eve
## 
### 
"November 24, is the date and the
new gymnasium is the place for the
1918 cotillion." This-was the decision
of the sophomore committee, which
met for the first time at the Delta
Gamma house last evening. Discus
sion, embellished by a host of novel
suggestions and sparkling ideas, ran
rife, with the result that a large
amount of material was organized as
a basis for future operations.
The committee of which H. P. Houser
is chairman, was subdivided into sec
tions in order that every phase of the
social event may receive the attention
of members who have exhausted every
possibility in their particular field.
Nothing in addition will be attemp
ted by the committee as a whole until
October 12, when the body will assem
ble to hear the reports from the inves
tigations carried on by its various
branches.
