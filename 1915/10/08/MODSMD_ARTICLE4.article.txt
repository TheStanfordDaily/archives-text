# Masquers Will Produce Vaudeville October 22
## 
### 
Masquers promise a vaudeville bar
gain for the evening of Friday, Octo
ber 22, in the Assembly Hall, whera
they will offer a "jinks" program of
sparkling originality for the sum of
twenty-five cents. Owing to the fact
that Ram's Head Society will not stage
their annual burlesque this semester
the Masquers' Jinks is expected to
supply the campus demand for novil
dramatic offerings of the lighter sort.
Miss Ellen Galpin, of Los Angeles,
will present "The Maker of Dreams,"
a one-act fantasy in which she will
portray the leading role. Miss Galpin
has had eminent success as a pro
ducer in the south. Another unusual
offering will be a modern black and
white pantomime, "The Shepherd in
the Distance," which will reflect the
newest ideas of Gordon Craig in scenic
effects and lightning. J. 11. Morgan.
'10, one of the cleverest Ram's Head
stars, will stage the pantomime in
addition to playing one of the princi
pal roles.
Miss Margery Bailey, '.14, who
starred in the Masquers' production of
Ibsen's "Pillars of Society," last se
mester, will display a very different
phase of her talent in an original of
fering replete with humor and jollity.
Professional musical acts will lend
added interest to the jinks, which
promises to set a new dramatic stan
dard in originality and humor.
