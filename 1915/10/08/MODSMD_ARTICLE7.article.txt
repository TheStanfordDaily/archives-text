# Market on Circle in Palo Alto Tomorrow to Feature Nickel Dance
## 
### 
Tomorrow's market on the circle in
Palo Alto will not be all food stuffs
and clothing, but amusement of the
lighter vein is planned to appeal to
even the most fastidious. He who
would spend a mere jitney and enjoy
himself will find oportunity in the
nickel dance which will take place on
a specially prepared floor. All day
dancing will be in order, with music
furnished by well known Stanford one
step artists. Refreshments on the
sidelines, served by pretty Palo Alto
maidens should prove alluring.
Franklin's studio has been convert
ed into a playhouse in preparation for
the hourly performance of modern
"vodvil." Singing and dancing at a
nominal price will lie offered by the
Misses Marie de Forest, Katherine
Shelton, Florence Ackarman, Weslie
Jones. Isabel Young, and Hortense
Williams, of Stanford and Miss Har
ker's school. The first show will be
at ten o'clock.
Taxicabs that will go anywhere
have been donated by the Andrus and
Thompson companies, which will turn
full proceeds to the relief fund. The
price of ten cents has been named for
the latest creation from the pens of
David Star Jordan and Raymond Mac
donald Alden, the verse entitled "Bel
gium," which has been bound so as
to make an attractive gift.
