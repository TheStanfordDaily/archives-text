# VARSITY RUGGERS WALK OVER BARBARIANS. TALLY 80-3
## SCORE EVERY THREE MINUTES Scientific Backfield Work Earns Freshman Victory Over Berkeley High 
### 
One touchdown for every three min
utes of play was the record of the var
sity against the Barbarians Saturday
afternoon when the referee's final
whistle ended the eighteenth Cardinal
romp through the black-jerseyed line,
disclosing the lop-sided score of
80 to 3.
The varsity didn't play the Barba
rians Saturday—it played against ihe
score, attempting to appease the de
mands of the bleachers and "make it
a hundred." At no time in the game
were the Barbs able to put up a fair
resistance to the charges of the Stan
ford first, though the form of the lat
ter was not entirely up to expecta
tions.
Varsity Score Large
Scoring began before the varsity had
been in action two minutes, when
Danny Carroll sidled over the line,
following a thirty yard passing rush,
in which Ric Templeton and Joe Ur
ban figured strongly. The example
once set, practically every player on
the varsity followed suit, and before
the half was ended eight more passing
rushes had resulted in tries, seven of
which "Dink" Templeton converted.
Bert West, playing for the Barba
rians, saved his team from being
whitewashed early in the first half,
when he dropped a twenty yard pen
alty kick between the goal posts. The
initial period ended with the Barbs on
the defense and the score 41 to 3.
Kiulit Tries in Second Half
In the second half Danny Carroll
again started the score on its upward
roll with a twenty yard d;ish and a
cross kick to Rehm, who passed the
ball to Long to he carried over the
line. During the half, the varsity
crossed the line eight more times. Jim
Wylie carried the oval over three
times. Joe Braden crossed twice,
Long, Knight, Carroll and Urban each
tried once. Templeton converted six
of the second half tries.
Freshmen \re Victorious
The freshmen squad encountered
one of the strongest opponents of the
season in Berkeley high school, but

the 115 to score. In t'~ 'If the
