## SATURDAY DATE SET FOR SKITS English Club Initiates Dramatic Feature With View To Creating Interest 
### 
Three bright one-act plays, modern
and full of action, will he presented
by the English Club at the Palo Alto
Playhouse next Saturday evening, at
eight o'clock. The plays are "Simoon,"
by August Strindberg; "A Christmas
Present," by Arthur Sohnitzler, and
Granville Barker, and "A Good
Woman," by Arnold Bennett.
The object of the English Club in
staging' these little dramas is to com
bine literary merit with dramatic in
terest by putting before the college
and Palo Alto public short, bright
acts, such as one might see at the
Orpheum or in a "little theatre."
In the selection of the three skits
named, an attempt has been made to
give a variety.
"Simoon," an Arabian costume play
with highly dramatic qualities, proved
a tremendous success when played
on October 3 in Muir Woods, Woodland
theatre, before a large audience.
The skit, "A Good Woman," is a
sparkling farce comedy, a satire on
the stock situation-play. It is of the
modern drawing-room type of drama.
"A Christmas Present" is full of
lively, clever humor, it is one of the
"Anatol Series," popularized by Holl
brook Blinn at the Princess Theatre
in New York.
