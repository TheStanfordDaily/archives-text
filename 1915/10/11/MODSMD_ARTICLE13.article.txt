This column has discovered a soul,
and has joined the uplift brigade, and
is headed straight for the bow-wows.
Tt is subsidized by the queer people
hereabout who spell Art with italics
instead of a question mark.
We just now read an announcement
that English Club is going to lob some
dramatic curves across the footlights
in Palo Alto next Saturday night.
Three simon-pure plays in one even
ing, served up with so much pep that
your boastful rough will be peeved be
cause he has to admit he enjoyed them.
Some of us have this large league
stuff doped wrong, and don't even ad
mit that there is good basis for an ar
gument. Mental dyspepsia is frisking
around in our midst. When something
comes along that has a kick in it,
whether drayma, or lit'rature, or what
not, why get indignant because it hap
pens to be the product of a real long
hair?
The three sketches chosen by the
English Club are modern, and straight
forward. When they have something
to say, they don't stutter. And they
offer, strangely enough, entertainment.
Arnold Bennett's "A Good Woman,"
and Strindberg's "Simoon," ' and
Schnitzler's "Christmas Present" make
a combination you can't break single
handed.
True enough, they have been dubbed
"art." That isn't a curse, but only
one way of saying they hit the ball.
Lots of people are glad that the local
stage magnates have taken a notion to
serve us with a change of diet now
and then. Masquers Society is going
to do more of the good work next
month.
Broadway comedy is good. We
admit it, and use the comps regularly.
But it is a good thing to know that
there are a few live ones among the
Big ideas.
