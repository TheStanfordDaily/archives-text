## Lack of Water Costs Palo Alto Firm $25,000 
### 
Catching fire from an unknown
cause at about 1:30 last night the J. F.
Parkinson planing mill, valued at $25,-
000, burned to the ground in an hour
and a half. There is 110 insurance on
the building, which is situated at the
junction of the San Jose and Campus
street cars.
An alarm was turned in by the San
Jose car men, of the Peninsula Line,
returning to Palo Alto on their 1:30
trip. The city tire department an
swered the alarm, but was of 110 use
because the pressure could not be
had for more than half an hour. By
that time the Are had made too much
headway to be extinguished, but it.was
kept from spreading to the surround
ing buildings on which showers of
sparks were falling. The main build
ing and all the outer buildings and
piles of lumber in its proximity were
entirely destroyed.
