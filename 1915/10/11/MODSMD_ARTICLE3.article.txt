# All-Blacks to Play
## 
### 
St. Ignatius will play the second
varsity tomorrow afternoon at 4:30.
Saturday's St. Ignatius-second var
sity battle was the most closely
contested match of the day. Al
though the All-Blacks won at that
time by a 3 to 0 score, a second vic
tory is by no means certain.
St. Ignatius will us& the same
team as on Saturday. The second
varsity line-up has not yet been
announced.
