# "STOP THIEF" PLAYERS GAIN MERITED SUCCESS
## SITUATIONS HOLD AUDIENCE Paul, Williams and Cross, Star In Difficult Masculine Roles 
### 
"Stop Thief!" shouted everyone at
once. And he stopped and came hack
and got married, rt was the iirst time
during the whole evening that anyone
on the stage managed to hold still for
more than a few seconds, for the hap
penings in the Sword and Sandals of
fering of Friday came thick and fast.
The play called for acting that was
alive and convincing and the cast rose
to the occasion with a well-rounded
performance, \lthough we may doubt
whether the play chosen was of the
type wich is now most needed in Stan
ford dramatics, it was undeniably well
presented in every detail.
Mridegroorn in Distress
Individual honors were difficult to
apportion Friday evening. W. G. Paul
was admirably cast as the distressed
bridegroom. His "happiest-man-in-
America" expression was surpassed
only by his growing dismay at the ap
parent certainty of his own guilt. The
actor succeeded in making the bride
groom's honest dismay show beneath
his forced naturalness.
The same difficult feat of acting a
part within a part may be put on the
credit side of the' for TCuford
Williams. His Jack Doogan took the
audionce into his confidence in most
engaging fashion while he duped the
Oarr family at every turn. Williams,
like Paul, did some of his best acting
while thlines went to the rest of the
characters.
Cross Does Fine Work
Some of the finest work of the even
ing was done by J. C. Cross in the
part of the father of the bride. Cross
made the most, of every opportunity to
make the forgetful old man one of the
out-standing figures of the perfor
mance. Without sacrificing at any
point the audience's sympathy for the
character. Cross gave the role its full
comedy value, and his reiterated,
"Why will I he so absent-minded,"
brought forth gal"Â® of laughter.
Among the women in the cast Miss
Esther Liversldge and Miss Mary
Flowers took the honors. Miss Flow
ers as the fussy Mrs. Carr. gave one
of the most memorable characteriza
tions of recent Stanford dramatics.
Tier acting mors* than outbalanced the
effect of her somewhat youthful make
up.
Miss Liversldge brought out the pos
