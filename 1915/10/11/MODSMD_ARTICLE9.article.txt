# Large Sum Cleared at Belgian Market
## Belgian Senator Expresses Gratitude on Behalf of His Country 
### 
Over three thousand dollars finally
came to rest In the bank vault to the
credit of the Belgian relief fund, after
changing hands at the Palo Alto mar
ket Saturday. This amount is nearly
three times as great as that which was
cleared at the first European municipal
market held in the Circle last spring.
The net receipts were wired today
to Mr. Lyndon Hates, New York, chair
man of the American committee for
the relief of Belgium. In New York,
the thrae thousand dollars will change
hands again, when converted into that
grain most needed by the war-stricken
populace. One of the 48 ships now in
use for relief work will convey the
grain to Rotterdam, where it will be
received by Professor V. L. Kellogg of
Stanford. Professor S. S. Seward, now
in the province of Limbourg, will also
welcome the arrival of the foodstuff.
Stanford men and women contribut
ed a large share* to the Belgian fund,
not only by their purchases and enjoy
ment of amusements provided, but by
their participation in the market activ
ities. The ever popular jitney dance
netted $21, which sum represents the
tax on 421 couples. Thirty dollars was
the amount brought in by the side
show which featured .T. H. Wiggins,
'10, E. R. Knollin, '12, in gymnastics,
Miss Dorothy Metz, '17, and Miss Car
lotta Sawyer, '17, in fencing, Manton
Barnes, '17, and P. H. Solon, gr., in
music.
The Ely vaudeville, featuring Stan
ford and Palo Alto women, cleared $:)3.
J. R. Mackel, '17, and Miss D. V. Dorn,
16. in Ihe guess-yoflr-weight enterprise
managed to glean $11 worth of evasive
small change. Miss E. L. Buckingham,
I '09, and Dare Stark, '17, captured $17
! by fortune telling.

I ator do la Fontaine of Belgium, who

l ing done in the cause of his people.
