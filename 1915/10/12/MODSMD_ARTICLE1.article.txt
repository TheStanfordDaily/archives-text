# BERKELEY PUBLICATION FAVORS RENEWED RELATIONS
## EDITORIAL REFLECTS OPINION Requests That California Listen to Clear Argument from Stanford 
### 
Despite California's recent switch
to American football and the apparent
absolute severance of relations with
Stanford, there is evidently a growing
sentiment on the Blue and Gold cam
pus for patching up difficulties previ
ous to next semester. This sentiment
bubbles out in the editorial of The
Student Opinion, the new college peri
odical, which was scattered broadcast
at California yesterday.
Editor R. L. Johns, 'IT, looks for
ward to the season of spring sports,
as it stands under the present condi
tions, with a somewhat dubious air.
He advocates a speedy settlement of
the difficulties regarding the second
semester, but to temporarily leave the
football problem unsettled. Johns
further requests that California listen
to a clear Stanford argument and in
addition to know just what she wants
herself, in other words, to have a clear
conception of her own stand. The
editorial as printed in the eighth issue
of The Student Opinion given out to
the public yesterday follows:
"We'd lik3' to see California and
Stanford relations in some way
patched up, even if it be only to play
a game of marbles for keeps. We as
suredly can not meet Stanford on the
gridiron now we've changed the style
of football. We ought to be able to
find some basis of agreement that
would open up a more brilliant pros
pect for spring sports. Track, base
ball, and tennis relations were all sev
ered when it.was agreed to disagree
with Stanford about football.
"California looks forward to no big
spring sport prospects. Let's quit
talking and get the whole matter of
relations settled. Hear Stanford's
side of the tangle, and know where we
stand ourselves."
