# FRESHMAN RUGGERS TO MEET LOWELL HIGH TOMORROW
## VISITORS A STRONG FIFTEEN Experts Predict Contest Will be One of the Fast Open Backfield Variety 
### 
Lowell High School's rugby squad
will cover the turf tomorrow after
noon in a contest with the frsshman
team. The game will be called at 4:30
on the inner field.
The baby squad was given a drub
bing last night at the hands of the
Stanford varsity, and will be in a
mood to take revenge on the San
Francisco players, who, however, are
strong contenders, being doped among
the three highest in the Hay prepara
tory school series.
It is probable that practically the
same freshman line-up will be used
as in last Saturday's game. However,
it is expected that a decidedly differ
ent sort of a game will be 1 put up this
time, owing to the fact that the Lowell
squad is lighter than the Berkeley
huskies, who forced the first year men
to win their way to the last week end
victory via the scrum route.
Freshmen games have been among
the best seen on the turf this year,
owing largely to the open plays which
this season's youngest squad has been
featuring, and it is noticeable that a
goodly number of fans have graced
the stands at every contest.
