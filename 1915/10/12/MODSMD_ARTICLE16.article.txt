# A 						Harvest Theme
## 
### 
We understand that tomorrow a
committee of ninetieeners will be in
structed in the arts and crafts of gath
ering in the annual fuel harvest. So
except for necessary timber, the fresh
man bonfire is all ready for release of
our illuminated pep carnival. Get be
hind the idea where you belong, be
cause that blaze is a necessary part of
the color scheme.
Below are printed a few notions
about a rally pyre that can be touched
off without loss of common sense, pub
lic decency, and enthusiastic fresh
men. They aren't original or inspired,
so we pass them along gratis, and
hope they will sink in deep.
The size of the bonfire should be
limited to a third, or a half the size
of the ones which have futilely licked
the skies in years past. This doctrine
isn't preached because California isn't
on the map this season. The football
blaze has always been a folly, in so
far as it has been a waste of good
wood. A smaller pile furnishes as
much available light for our war
dance, and no set of figures has been
presented in denial.
Construction of the pyre should not
be started until two weeks before the
night of the conflagration. Many first
year men have been carried to the
edge of the campus at the end of the
first semester, and dropped off, be
cause of too assiduous efforts on the
bonfire. Let the freshmen locate and
cinch their sources of supply now, but
leave the building until a necessary
time.
For the good of class finances, and
of their "rep" with outsiders, the
youngsters should be urged against
wrecking fences, chicken coops, and
like implements in the mad scramble
for combustible wood. Other classes
before you have tried that and got
soaked for costs, '19. Be careful about
the3o midnight pilgrimages.
Who should limit the size of the con
flagration, and how much? The ex
exutive committee can make the move,
or Skull and Snakes, or someone else.
Somebody should. And the serpentine
won't suffer a bit.
