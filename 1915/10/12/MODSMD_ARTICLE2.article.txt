# WILL HOLD TRAINING TABLE DANCE FRIDAY
## 
### 
Date conflicts between the sopho
mores and the Executive Committee
were settled today and the training
table dance will be held in the Gym
nasium Friday evening in place of the
second y;ar jolly-up, which has now
been postponed to the evening of No
vember 6.
Tickets for the training table dance
are now on sale at the Bookstore and
programs will be given out Thursday
afternoon. Chairman D. B. Carroll,'l6,
announces that the committee in
charge of the training table dance has
left nothing undone that will add to
the pleasure of the evening. Music
will be supplied by the Stanford Band.
All proceeds will go toward support
ing the training table at the S. A. E.
house this season.
Sophomores are now planning an in
novation, a sophomore week-end, at
which the second year students will
attempt to entertain the rest of the
campus, if present plans are un
changed. The sophomore play, "Bob
by Burnitt," will be presented in the
Assembly Hall on Friday evening, No
vember and the jolly-up will be held
the following evening. Some opposi
tion was expected to this plan because
November is the data of the Roble
Formal, usually a closed date. How
ever, Roble Club has called a special
meeting this evening at the request of
the Executive Committer and will in
all probability be able to favor the
sophomores by opening the date.
