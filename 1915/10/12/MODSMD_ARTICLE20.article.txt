# Peanut League Game Close
## 
### 
One of the best games ot' the pres
ent season was played in the Peanut
League yesterday afternoon, when the
Hlacks defeated the Whites by a 6 to
4 score. Stevens, varsity shortstop,
pitched excellent hall for the losers,
but was accorded poor support in the
pinches. Clark pitched good ball in
all but one inning, the third, in which
the Whites made all four or their runs.
Mitchell, second baseman for the win
ners, made one' of the longest bits of
the year when he connected for a
three-bagger in the fourth frame,
(lames will be played on Tuesday and
Thursday afternoons on tho varsity
diamond.
