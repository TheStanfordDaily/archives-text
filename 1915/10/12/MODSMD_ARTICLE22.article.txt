Joaquin Miller, by turns miner, law
yer, editor, judge, and poet, stands
among the most picturesque figures
in American literature. 11 is "Colum
bus," the beauty and strength of which
carries an especial appeal on Discov
ery day, October 12, combines the
purely American appeal with a lesson
to all humanity:
Behind him lay the gray Azores,
Behind the Gates of Hercules,
Before him not the ghost of shores,
Before him only shoreless seas .
The good mate said: "Now must we
pray,
For lo! the very stars are gone.
Brave Admiral, speak. What shall I
say?"
"Why, say, "Sail on! sail 011! and on!' "
They sailed and sailed as winds might
blow
Until at last the blanched mate said:
"Why, now not even God would know
Should I and all my men fall dead.
These very winds forget their way,
For God from these dread seas is
gone.
Now speak, brave Admiral, speak and
say"—
He said: "Sail on! Sail 011! and on!"
They sailed. They sailed. Then spake
the, mate:
"This mad sea shows his teeth to
night;
He curls his lip, he lies in wait,
With lifted teeth as if to bite!
Brave Admiral, say but one good word :
What shall we do when hope is
gone?"
The words leapt like a leaping sword:
"Sail 011! sail 011! sail on! and on!"
Then, pale and worn, he kept his deck,
And peered through darkness, Ah
that night
Of all dark nights! And then a speck—
A light! A light! A light! A light!
It grew, a starlit flag nnfurled!
He gained a world; he gave that
world
Its grandest lesson: "On! sail on!"
