William Bradbock Herms, member
of the Berkeley board of education,
and professor of parasitology in the
University of California,is a little
dubious as to the exact motive of
Professor Kellogg, who has named a
n.'wly discovered louse "Trichodectes
herms," in his honor, especially as
this new aphis is said to thrive most
abundantly on goats.
"Trichodectes herms" was discov
ered by E. M. Ledyard of Manila, grad
uate of the University of California, in
the investigation of an outbreak of
goat disease. Not being familiar with
thai species of lice found on the goats,
he sent specimens to California,
which were sent on to Professor Kel
logg, leading authority on parasites of
animals and birds. Finding the louse
an entirely new species, Professor
Kellogg returned the honor conferred
upon him, by immortalizing the name
of Herms in connecting it with this
new parasite.
