# BOOST COSMOPOLITAN IDEAS, ADVICE OF PROFESSOR
## GERMAN SCOPE IS NATIONAL Americans Approach Broad World Vision Most Nearly, Says H.C. Brown 
### 
"American Philosophy and Cosmo
politan Idea" was the subject taken
by Professor H. C. Brown of the Phi
losophy department in his talk before
the Cosmopolitan Club, assembled last
evening in the Engineering building.
Professor Brown opened his talk
by defining national philosophy as the
"effort of a people to justify their cul
ture and ideals," and by stating that
such an effort was generally opposed
to the sound "cosmopolitan idea." As
an example of the belief in the fore
going statements the old German phi
losopher, Fichte, was quoted. Fichte
taught that the real purpose of exist
ence must first lie realized in the par
ticular nation to which we, ourselves,
belong, and that after this purpose
has been grasped it should be spread
over the entire race.
The impossibility of such an out
come for the nations of America was
explained by Professor Brown in his
statement that "the accident of Amer
ican composition is opposed to a uni
tary racial genius." This, in other
1 words, may be interpreted to mean
that the population of America is com
posed of such a large number of dif
ferent races that it would be impossi
ble for them to agree on "the purpose
of their existence." The German na
tion was cited as a nation which pos
sesses unitary racial genius and is
mightily opposed to the cosmopolitan
idea.
Professor Brown further explained
that owing to the conglomeration of
races in America we are obliged to
promot: efficiency of human inter
course regardless of class, racial, geo
graphical, and national limits. Hence,
our philosophy must recognize the pe
culiar capacities and values of each
people and our cosmopolitanism must
express a harmony of the capacities of
all peoples rather than a subordina
tion of humanity to a prescribed idea
of a particular race. Further, if na
tions bear the attitude that nations
are to each other as individuals, which
is one of tb contentions of the Ger
man nation, internationalism is apt
to be regarded as a Utopian error.
