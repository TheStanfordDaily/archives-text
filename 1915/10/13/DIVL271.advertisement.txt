No, Philburt, ! am not a-arguing with you.
I'm just a-telling you
—when you want a real smoke, get behind a pipeful of
Tuxedo and watch all the big and little Worries that
have been a-besieging you, evacuate their trenches
and make a rushin' advance to the rear. Those fragrant
whiffs of "Tux" make them feel too joyful —no self
respecting Worry can stand for that.
The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
The combination of the best smoking-tobacco leaf in the
world and the best method ever discovered for refining
and mellowing tobacco puts Tuxedo in a class by itself.
Kentucky's ripest, mildest Burley
leaf, when treated by the original
"Tuxedo Process" loses every trace
of bite — develops a wonderfully
pleasing fragrance and llavor that
are not found in any other tobacco.
No other manufacturer knows
the "Tuxedo Process"; that's why
no imitator ever equals Tuxedo!
