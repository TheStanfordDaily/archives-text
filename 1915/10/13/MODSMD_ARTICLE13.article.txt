# FRESHMEN TAG LOWELL HIGH SCHOOL AFTER HARD FIGHT
## FINAL SCORE TOTALS 16 TO 0 Victory is Result of Clever Style of Rugby-Contest Runs Very Even 
### 
Although sixteen tallies were count
ed against Lowel high school in their
match with the freshmen this after
noon, the game was exceedingly even
and hard-fought. Open play and
clever rugby were in evidence.
First Half
After five minutes of play, there was
little to choose between either team,
Lowell, however, managing to keep
th 3 hall well out of danger. Short
passing rushes, clever dribbling on the
part of the first year ruggers, finally
permitted Swarts, for the freshmen,
to go five yards to a score following
a ruck close to the line. Boydston
converted. Threa more points were
added a moment later, when the ball
was transferred l'rom Boydston to Pe
louze to Stephens for a second try
after covering some twenty yards.
Score, 8-0.
Second Half.
Right from the jump, the Lowell
aggregation kept the freshmen on a
continual defense. Near trys were a
frequent occurrence, until finally a
free-kick by Boydston to touch, after
twelve minutes of play, put the ball
well out of danger. Stephens, wing
for the freshmen, at this point broke
through for a score, after scurrying
forty yards along the side line, de
ceiving his opponents with fake passes.
Boulware missed conversion. Polouze
innnediaetly followed suit with an
other forty-yard spurt through a scat
tered fielrl for the last try. Boulware
added two points. Final score, lfi-0.
