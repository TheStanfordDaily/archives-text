Nobody has ever paid much atten
tion to the large, and probably dissi
pated profession of social secretaries.
Their lives are sung neither in verse,
drama, or O. Henry, but we bet they
have a gay time playing around on the
brink of the social whirl. What makes
us appreciate their unhappy lot is the
quandry which has risen because the
sophomores want to throw a campus
party the night of the Roble formal.
For a fact, we should quit trying to
figure the percentages of the contest
ants if the public weal weren't being
bandied around like that poor little
campaign pup. Rut it is, surely.
Briefly, the background for mis
agreement in this: The executive
committee last week settled on next
Friday as the only feasible date for a
football dance, the proceeds of which
will go toward support of the varsity
training table. The sophomores grace
fully relinquished a prior claim to
that night for their jolly-up. Being in
real need of the money that would
come from the entertainment they
sought another opening.
November 6, scheduled only for the
Roble formal, was the only evening
on the calendar which could possibly
be considered. Roble was asked to
share that evening, despite the fact
that it was by unwritten precedent, a
closed date. Last night the girls at
Roble Club voted that the campus
can't reasonably ask such a suicidal
favor.
The attitude of the Roble members
was expressed in a letter to The Daily
Palo Alto, which we regret cannot be
printed because there is not sufficient
space. Fairly presented, the points
are: the underclass festival would,
because of nominal charge, attract
many club girls from the more expen
sive formal dance; the Roble func
tion is by precedent a closed date;
the request for cooperation with the
sophomores was not officially pre
sented ; there might be some other
date open to the sophomores.
An honestly meant answer to those
arguments follows: A sufficient num
ber of Roble girls should because of
loyalty and interest attend the formal;
even precedent should at times give
way to the good of a greater number;
if the request was not properly pre
sented no slight was intended; no
other date is available to the sopho
mores, which would not injure more
extensive interests, and threaten the
class exchequer.
This evening o. - tomorrow there will
be a second Roble Club meeting, at
which the first decision may be re
versed. Neither the financial need of
the sophomores, or the loneness of
November f>. as a possible date for
their party, or the opportunity for
service to the student body are in
flated. And we are pulling wishbones
ovrr that Roble verdict.

versed. Neither the financial need of
the sophomores, or the loneness of
November f>. as a possible date for
their party, or the opportunity for

Nobody has ever paid much atten
tion to the large, and probably dissi
pated profession of social secretaries.
Their lives are sung neither in verse,
drama, or O. Henry, but we bet they
have a gay time playing around on the
brink of the social whirl. What makes
us appreciate their unhappy lot is the
quandry which has risen because the
sophomores want to throw a campus
party the night of the Roble formal.
For a fact, we should quit trying to
figure the percentages of the contest
ants if the public weal weren't being
bandied around like that poor little
campaign pup. Rut it is, surely.
Briefly, the background for mis
agreement in this: The executive
committee last week settled on next
Friday as the only feasible date for a
football dance, the proceeds of which
will go toward support of the varsity
training table. The sophomores grace
fully relinquished a prior claim to
that night for their jolly-up. Being in
real need of the money that would
come from the entertainment they
sought another opening.
November 6, scheduled only for the
Roble formal, was the only evening
on the calendar which could possibly
be considered. Roble was asked to
share that evening, despite the fact
that it was by unwritten precedent, a
closed date. Last night the girls at
Roble Club voted that the campus
can't reasonably ask such a suicidal
favor.
The attitude of the Roble members
was expressed in a letter to The Daily
Palo Alto, which we regret cannot be
printed because there is not sufficient
space. Fairly presented, the points
are: the underclass festival would,
because of nominal charge, attract
many club girls from the more expen
sive formal dance; the Roble func
tion is by precedent a closed date;
the request for cooperation with the
sophomores was not officially pre
sented ; there might be some other
date open to the sophomores.
An honestly meant answer to those
arguments follows: A sufficient num
ber of Roble girls should because of
loyalty and interest attend the formal;
even precedent should at times give
way to the good of a greater number;
if the request was not properly pre
sented no slight was intended; no
other date is available to the sopho
mores, which would not injure more
extensive interests, and threaten the
class exchequer.
This evening o. - tomorrow there will
be a second Roble Club meeting, at
which the first decision may be re
versed. Neither the financial need of
the sophomores, or the loneness of
November f>. as a possible date for
their party, or the opportunity for
service to the student body are in
flated. And we are pulling wishbones
ovrr that Roble verdict.
