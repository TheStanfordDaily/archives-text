more comedy to be presented in the

of the second year play.
Rehearsals are held fonr times
every week in the Engineering base

chosen for the play are well suited
to the parts for which they are se

to persuade members of the cast to
act naturally, to bring the popular
comedy up to a perfection that can be
compared with that enjoyed by so
many theater-goers about five years
ago when "Hobby Burnit" enjoyed a
record run all over the country.
