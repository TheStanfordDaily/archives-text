## Declares This Country Should Come Into Closer Touch With Southern Republics

"More interest should be taken by
the United States in Argentine and
Chile," said Mrs. W. F. Rice, of the
Women's College and Preparatory
School of Santiago, Chile. "Commer
cially, the Argentine Republic is of
much greater importance that has
ever been realized. Imports to tne
value of $120,000,000 from England,
and $72,000,000 from Germany were
shipped into this republic during the
year which ended in the August be
fore the beginning of the present war."
Mrs. Rice believes that the United
States should endeavor to come in
closer touch with South America.
Mrs. Rice is making a tour of the
colleges and universities of Cali
fornia with Miss Alice Johnston, sec
ietary for the Methodist Women's
Missionary Society in California, Ari
zona, and Nevada. Miss Johnston's
aim is to gain the support of college
women, and yesterday spoke to the
Methodist women of Stanford.
