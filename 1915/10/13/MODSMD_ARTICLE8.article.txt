# POLICY IN ATHLETICS COMMENDED BY GRADUATES
## ALUMNI GREATLY INTERESTED Think Present Attitude is In Keeping With Democratic Ideals of Stanford 
### 
"Stanford's Policy in Athletics," the
first official statement, of the univer
sity regarding the Cardinal stand on
th a rugby situation made public by
Doctor Frank Angell on September 20,
is meeting with evident approval as
shown by letters received from two
alumni today. Comment on the uni
versity's stand included in the epistles,
is of exceeding interest to all involved
members of the Stanford campus.
G. I). Hoalt, '03, attorney in San
Francisco, proves very determined in
his support of Stanford's oTicial state
ment in a letter sent to Registrar Mc-
Dowell. Hoalt last year was presi
dent of the alumni association, and at
present is a member of the advisory
board. Extracts from the note follow:
"In my very humble opinion, the at
titude taken by the various athletic
representatives and interests at Stan
ford as set forth in this statement, is
thoroughly in keeping with the well
known democratic ideals of the uni
versity, and should receive the hearty
support of the entire alumni, for un
doubtedly tlie statement crystalizes
the heretofore rather nebulous alumni
ideas in respect to the establishing of
a well defined Stanford athletic policy.
"As our back yard consists in some
twenty-three hundred of 'farm,'
with most approved and modernized
climatic appointments, affording un
limit d facilities for the development
of clean, manly sport, there would
seem to be little reason why we should
go out of the way or deviate one iota
from the already well established high
athletic standards of Stanford, in an
endeavor to seek questionable ath
letic relations in the sanitary back
yard of our neighbors, the Merritt-
Christy-Schafer family, especially
when the atmosphere of the last men
tioned back yard, is more or less con
taminated by certain unholy influences
which are no wise in keeping with
Stanford standards and ideals."
S. S. Berry, '09, zoologist of Rod
lands, furnishes a clear conception of
the situation in Southern California
as regards the switcli to American
football. He is a brother of the Barry
that broke the niilo interscholastic
record two years ago. Portions of his
letter, written to Doctor Frank Angell,
follow:
"Thank you for sending me a copy
of the circular letter on the Stanford
athletic policy, especially since most |
of the papers down here either j
printed it incompletely or not at all.
1 am glad you sent it out, for particu
larly here in the south where rugby
lias been having such hard sledding
lately, it has been difficult to make
people understand that the question
was something more than merely 'let
ting the young chaps choose whatever
game they want to play.' Had it even
been left to 'the young chaps,' 1 think
most of them would have stuck to
rugby, and in the case of the local
school, if not the whole Citrus Belt
League, a more general appreciation
of th: real matter at issue would have
undoubtedly been decisive. As it was,
the influence of IT. C., U. S. C., and the
Los Angeles sporting editors was suf
ficient. to smother opposition and rail
road things as they pleased.
