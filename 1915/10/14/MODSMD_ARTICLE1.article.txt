# DOCTOR JORDAN SENT AS SPECIAL ENVOY TO WILSON
## DELEGATE PEACE CONGRESS To Urge President to Cooperate in Calling Conference of Neutral Nations 
### 
The International Peace Congress
closed its session in San Francisco
yesterday by choosing Chancellor Jor
dan to go as a special envoy to Presi
dent Wilson to urge the chief execu
tive to adopt the recommendations of
th' 3 peace organizations that a confer
ence of all neutral nations be called
to end the European war. According
to San Francisco newspapers Dr. Jor
dan accepted the commission and
stated that he would leave at once for
Washington.
Efforts made by The Daily Palo
Alto today to gat a statement from
Dr. Jordan were unsuccessful. Inas
much as his plans as announced last
week would find him leaving San
Francisco for the East on Saturday,
it is more than probable that Chancel
lor Jordan will soon be in the White
House conferring with President
Wilson.
Congress Adopts Resolutions
Eleven resolutions in all were
adopted by the International Peace
Congress. The resolution that named
the special envoy to Washington de
clared that all indications pointed to
the fact that the warring nations
would welcoma any action by neutrals
to bring about peace. The resolution
further respectfully urges the chief
executive to cooperate with other neu
tral countries in the calling of a con
ference which would constitute a vol
untary court of continuous mediation.
Professor Willis Speaks
Professor Bailey Willis, head of the
department of Geology, spoke
prior to the adoption of the res
olutions. Dr. Willis held to the
opinion that permanent peace
could never be assured unless
sufficient police power was available
to back up the demands of the peace
advocates. Mr. Edward Berwick, of
Pacific Grove, known as the donor of
the Berwick Prize, was also heard.
