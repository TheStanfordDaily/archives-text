# LIBRARY AND MUSEUM WILL BE MOST IMPOSING STRUCTURES
## Thomas Welton Stanford Gives Large Sum to Finance Art Gallery Building 
### 
Preliminary work on the new Stan
lord Quadrangle, which will occupy a
site between the present Quadrangle
and Encina Hall, will begin in a few
months.
Plans for the Thomas Welton Stan
ford Art Museum, which is to be the
first building 011 the new Quad to bo
erected, have been approved, and ac
tual building operations will start at
a not far distant date. As fast as
funds become available for the pur
pose more buildings will be con
structed until the entire Quadrangle
is completed.
When finished, this new Quadrangle
will equal the old one in size and will
cover the tract of land bounded by
Lasuen, the Encina sidewalk, the car
tracks and the road to the site of
the old Encina gymnasium. It will
differ from the present Quad in sev
eral respects.
Differs from Old Quad.
Instead of having two groups of
buildings separated by a court like
the front facade of the original Quad,
the front of the new group of build
ings will be unbroken by any court
but will be composed of a large two
story edifice with a smaller one-story
structure on each side.
There will be no inner court in the
new Quad, the new library buildings,
which will be the largest and most im
posing of the new edifices, occupying
a central position. A number of
smaller courts will separate the
library from the outer buildings. The
two wings will extend from the mam
body of the Library to the side of the
new Quad facing the old Quad.
In spite of these architectural dif
ferences the new Quad will have the
same arcades, the same brown sand
stone walls and red-tiled roofs as the
old one.
