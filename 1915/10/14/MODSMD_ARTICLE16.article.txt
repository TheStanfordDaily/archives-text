Again we whisper, to tlie tune of
soft music, that we are for Art. That
is a pretty safe thing to root for, be
cause no one knows exactly what you
are driving at. May be cookery, or
queening, or cubist impressions.
Since it is broad daylight, our cour
age waxes great, so we shall stick
right to the center of the road, and
say that there should be an open air
theater, arena, or some such thing,
where pageants, spectacle plays, and
visiting orators might test their
wings. All of that under the open
sky, in the fresh air, and away from
the maudlin world.
Other people and interests have a
hankering for the same kind of toy.
Sword and Sandals, English Club, and
Professor G. James Pierce of the pub
lic exercises committee have all, inde
pendently and at various times pro
posed a crusade for the out-door
shrine.
During the day many ideas and
curious notions flit across the campus.
Lots of them are directed to the same
purpose, but because there is no com
bination or cooperation they flutter a
while, and then give up the ghost. So
it is with our good hunches.
Rather apparently, such a venture
as the out-of-door theater can be
made a reality by united effort. It
can not be, in many a long day, or at
least can not be so successfully real
ized by independent flights of en
thusiasm.
We know that there are other or
ganizations than the ones named
which would rally around the crusade
banner. Many or us would hail a co
operative meeting of the English Club,
Sword and Sandals, Masquers, and the
exercises committee, and of other in
terested organizations. They want a
common object, which would benefit
the university. Such a possession as
an amphitheater, in the hills, —any-
where under the canopy should be ob
tained and conducted for general good
and use.
Here is no opportunity for inde
pendent enterprise or adventure. Make
it a Stanford keepsake. A union meet
ing of members of all interested soci
eties is desireable. And hurrah for
Art.
