# ARCHIE RICE SHOWS RUGBY SUPERIOR TO AMERICAN FOOTBALL
## Comparative Statistics Produced on Olympic Club Contests With Rival Varsities 
### Archie Rice, '95 
In a city or 60,000 people, with a
.street car service to a surrounding
population of 220,000, with 0,000 stu
dents, the attendance at the American
football same between California and
the Olympic Club was comparatively
less than at the Stanford .'anie Satur
day. Here there are but 2,000 stu
dents in a country-sido population
ot hardly 8,000 people, yet at
the Stanford-Barbarian Club game
of rugby football there was an attend
ance of but ten per cent less than that
of Berkeley. The total attendance at
all preliminary games this season
seams to show that California lias but
ten percent larger attendance than
Stanford.
Below are some actual comparative
figures on rugby and the revised
American football taken at these two
contests by Archie- Bice, '95:

These two recent games fairly rep
sent the playing percentages that ap
ply to the like features under each
cods. The fastest American game
may go 220 plays and advance the ball
2500 yards, while the fastest rugby
game will run 375 plays and advance
the ball 5500 yards.
Rugby is played on a 55 per cent
larger field by 37 per cent more men
and is twice as fast.
