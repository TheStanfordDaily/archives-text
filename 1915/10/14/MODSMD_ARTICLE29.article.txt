# DIVINE HARASSED BY SEARSVILLE HABITAT
## Dr. Slattery's Discomfort While Guest at Union to Result in Untold Blessing

The Union building will soon be fur

Professor Pearce Mitchell,
Stanford University, Calif.
Dear Pearce:
Dr. Slattery, the distinguished rec
tor of Grace church, New York, came
to Stanford as the West Memorial lec
turer. By the way, I did not see you
at the lectures.
Professor Peirce, chairman of the
Public Exercise Committee, escorted
the reverend gentleman to the Union,
where he was to sleep.
Being a literary man, he has read of
wild life in the West, but being a par
son he has prayed constantly to be
delivered from battle, murder, and
sudden death. Little, therefore, did
he dream that he would be the leader
in any murderous scene in the quiet
peace of the Stanford Union. Picture,
then, dear friend, this gentleman, a
clergyman, in the middle of the night,
after a feverish journey across the
continent, in his chamber. Is he
asleep? No, sir! He is awake, in his
nightie, up and about, patiently, per
sistently—while asking for grace to
control the words of his mouth and
the meditations of his heart —chasing
and slaughtering the übiquitous and
agile mosquito! Rest he could not,
and when morning came he presented
his fevered face at my office, with
cruel evidences of the sharp and ruth
less damage done to a noble counte
nance.
Being a man of peace, and hating
bloodshed, he begged to be released
from the> fight and by the good graces
of the representative of the Law, Pro
fessor Woodward, the man of the gos
pel slept the sleep of the just beneath
another roof, in another room, mos
quito proof, with good angels about
his head.
A little mosquito netting, my good
sir, would have saved a bloody tragedy
and the fair name of Stanford and the
Union! And lest the retort polite,
'What are you doing to help us,' should
be my fate, I am today sending to
your treasurer five dollars, a contribu
tion to my life membership, in the
fond hope that it may find its way to'
the hardware store.
Yours cordially,
D. CHARLES GARDNER,
P. S.—lf it should be necessary to
retint the room, send the bill to the
committee on public exercises. If
public exercise is their function, they
ought to have chased the mosquitoes
out before putting the gentleman in!*i
Woodward credits his hospitality to
his account at the Bank of Heaven!"

The Union building will soon be fur
nished with sereens for the windows
and doors. A movement of such im
portance must have some deep seated
cause. Perhaps it may be found in
the following:
"Stanford University, California,
October 4, 1915.
Professor Pearce Mitchell,
Stanford University, Calif.
Dear Pearce:
Dr. Slattery, the distinguished rec
tor of Grace church, New York, came
to Stanford as the West Memorial lec
turer. By the way, I did not see you
at the lectures.
Professor Peirce, chairman of the
Public Exercise Committee, escorted
the reverend gentleman to the Union,
where he was to sleep.
Being a literary man, he has read of
wild life in the West, but being a par
son he has prayed constantly to be
delivered from battle, murder, and
sudden death. Little, therefore, did
he dream that he would be the leader
in any murderous scene in the quiet
peace of the Stanford Union. Picture,
then, dear friend, this gentleman, a
clergyman, in the middle of the night,
after a feverish journey across the
continent, in his chamber. Is he
asleep? No, sir! He is awake, in his
nightie, up and about, patiently, per
sistently—while asking for grace to
control the words of his mouth and
the meditations of his heart —chasing
and slaughtering the übiquitous and
agile mosquito! Rest he could not,
and when morning came he presented
his fevered face at my office, with
cruel evidences of the sharp and ruth
less damage done to a noble counte
nance.
Being a man of peace, and hating
bloodshed, he begged to be released
from the> fight and by the good graces
of the representative of the Law, Pro
fessor Woodward, the man of the gos
pel slept the sleep of the just beneath
another roof, in another room, mos
quito proof, with good angels about
his head.
A little mosquito netting, my good
sir, would have saved a bloody tragedy
and the fair name of Stanford and the
Union! And lest the retort polite,
'What are you doing to help us,' should
be my fate, I am today sending to
your treasurer five dollars, a contribu
tion to my life membership, in the
fond hope that it may find its way to'
the hardware store.
Yours cordially,
D. CHARLES GARDNER,
P. S.—lf it should be necessary to
retint the room, send the bill to the
committee on public exercises. If
public exercise is their function, they
ought to have chased the mosquitoes
out before putting the gentleman in!*i
