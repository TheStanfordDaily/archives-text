# LAW SMOKER SNAPPY
## Music and Refreshments Follow Talks by Faculty Members 
### 
Short, snappy speeches, music, eats,
smokes and Stanford spirit were the
elements which combined to make last
night's law smoker one of the best-ever
held. The speeches were made by
O. H. Castle, '14, President of the Law
Association, Daan F. C. Woodward, and
Professor A. M. C'athcart. Instruc
tor W. B. Owens, who was scheduled
to address the men, was unable to be
present.
A program of vocal and instrumen
tal music followed the speeches, which
in turn were followed by the expec
tantly awaited "eats."
P. O. Solon, '17, and M. M. Barnes,
'17, entertained with banjo and guitar,
while a stringed instrument quartet
played informally after the regular
program. A solo by W. C. Bacon, gr.,
and a piano solo by J. D. McLachlan,
'17, were added attractions.
Having by far the largest depart
ment to draw from, the lawyers' semi
annual get-to-gether was well at
tended, the Union being crowded to
the limit throughout the evening.
Nearly one-fifth of the entire student
body is registered in the pre-legal and
law section, and the entertainment
was made worthy of the large de
partment.
