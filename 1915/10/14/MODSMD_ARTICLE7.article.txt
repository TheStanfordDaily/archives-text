# FOURTEEN SONGSTERS WIN MEMBERSHIP TO GLEE CLUB
## SIX WEEK TRYOUT CONCLUDED Manager Higley Outlines Alluring Vacation Trips to Honolulu and Chicago 
### 
After six weeks ot' tryouts I)r. L. H.
Eaton, director of the Glee Club, lias
announced the selection of fourteen
new men. The new voices chosen
have been submitted to the most care
ful tests, and their selection to the
organiaztion is a recognition of their
extraordinary qualities. In the opin
ion of Dr. Eaton, Stanford has now
the material for one of the best glee
clubs that has evei gathered on the
Assembly Hall stage.
The new men to join the ranks of
the first tenors are O. J. Gilliland, '16,
H. H. Jope, '18, F. J. Galliano, '18,
The second tenors are strengthened
by the addition of H. T. Poyd. '19, and
J. Murphy, '19. The first base section
has been replenished by the selection
of J. M. Maltby, '16, L. 13. McMurtry,
'19, E .C. La Forge, '19, and J. P.
Shamberger, '19, while D. S. Rathbun,
'18, M. S. Donaldson, '18, D. F. Kuzell,
'19, and D. M. Smith, '19, have been
added to ths second basses.
J. S. Higley, '17, manager of the
Glee Club, has outlined some very al
luring possibilities in the way of trips
and innovations for the club this sea
son. The Hawaiian Promotion Com
mittee has offered to lend its aid in
connection with that of th& Univer
sity Club of Honolulu in case the
Stanford singers should find it possi
ble to make the trip to Honolulu dur
ing the Christmas vacation. There is
also a fair chance that the Glee Club
may make a trip to Chicago during
the spring vacation, since each year
the Santa Fe railroad takes a glee club
from one of the western colleges.
The first concert which the club will
give in San Jose has been slated for
the early part of November. Later in
the season the Mandolin and Glee
clubs hope to give a combination con
cert in the Assembly Hall. This un
usual blending of musical talent is
one which Stanford students have not
enjoyed for many years.

Club is as follows:
