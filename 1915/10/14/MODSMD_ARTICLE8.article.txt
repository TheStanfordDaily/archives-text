# Cast of "A Good Woman" Is Named for Saturday
## English Club Triple Bill Promises Variety in Stanford One-Act Plays 
### 
The cast for Arnold Bennett's "A
Good Woman," which will be one of
the features of the English Club pro
gram of one-act plays to be given
Saturday evening at the Playhouse,
has been announced.
F. C. McColloch, '17, will take the
part of James Brett, a war clerk. Mc-
Colloch has already estblished a repu
tation on the Stanford stage through
his forceful work in "Ready Money"
and "Pillars of Society."
Gerald O'Mara, a civil engineer, will
be played by J. C. Cross, '17, whose
triumph of last week in "Stop Thief"
has placed him permanently in the
Who's Who of Stanford dramatics.
This part will offer Cross work in an
entirely different field from that of
the Sword and Sandals comedy, for
from an old man he will turn to the
impersonation of a youngster over
flowing with life and spirits.
Miss Dorothy Egbert, '16, who ap
peared in "Sherwood" last semester
will assume the. part of the spinster,
Rosamund Fyfe, in Bennett's sprightly
comedy. This play, one of the Eng
lish author's "polite farces" is a satire
on the overdrawn drawing-room
drama of the stock theatre. If played
with utter seriousness it might be
taken for an extreme example of this
only too common type of play, but
with the subtleties of the lines brought
out in the acting it is among the most
perfect of satires.
"A Christmas Present," by Arthur
Schnitzler and Granville Baker,, and
"Simoon," by August Strindberg, will
round out. this program into one of
three utterly different acts. In spite
of the contrast which these plays
offer each other, each one of the three
is of standard value in its class.
