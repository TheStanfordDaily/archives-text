# Chappie Desires More Writers of Dilettante
## 
### 
Unless Stanford humorists develop
greater ability in the art of writing
"dilettantes" for Chaparral than they
are exhibiting at present, Editor 11. M.
Levy, '10, threatens to abandon this
popula# feature of the campus comic.
Never before in the history of Chap
pie, s-ince its founding in October, '99,
has the dirth in this style of writing
been so marked as at present.
According to Levy, the chief draw
hack io those few attempts at dilet
tantes which reach the editor's desk
is the lack of "punch." "Dilettantes
are useless unless they 'put over' their
punch, and ones of the desired kind
are not forthcoming at present," says
Levy. Those interested in trying to
write the required type of "shorts"
may obtain additional information
from Levy, who is anxious to develop
dilettante writers.
Levy has another complaint. Not
enough sophomores and freshmen are
trying out for the Chaparral staff.
There is an excellent opportunity for
good comic writers to make the staff
during the present year.
Work 011 the November number of
Chappie is already well under way.
Football will be the big feature, a
j three-color rugby cartoon now being
prepared for the cover design.
