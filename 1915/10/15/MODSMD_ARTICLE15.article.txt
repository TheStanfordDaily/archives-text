# RARE VOLUME OBTAINED BY STANFORD LIBRARY
## 'Human Anatomy," Printed in Basil in Added to Collection of Books 
### 
The Stanford Library has recently
been enriched by the acquisition of a
rare and valuable work on human
anatomy by Vesalius, printed at Basel
in 1543. In order that this scientific
treasure may be fully appreciated, Pro
fessor A. W. Meyer, head of the anat
omy department, has been prevailed
upon to give some facts concerning
the volume. The following is a resume
of Professor Meyer's statement con
cerning the ancient book:
This work by Andreas Vesalius is
the groundstone of modern, not an
cient human anatomy. The anatomy
of his day was animal, not human.
Vesalius was the first anatomist of
any note to venture a contradiction
of the great authority, Galen, who
lived in the second century after
Christ. Vesalius broke completely
with Galen and his animal anatomy.
It is not only the loyalty to first
hand observation instead of authority
or dogma that characterizes this
work, but the beauty and accuracy of
the illustrations. Although they are
not the work of the Titan himself, as
was originally supposed, they never
theless show the work of an artist of
talent and seem to indicate a com
prehension of what is drawn.
