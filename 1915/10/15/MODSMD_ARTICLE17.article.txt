Stanford, Oct. 14, 1915.
Dearest Ma:—Hard days these, with
midsummer exes and dances. Have
been hemitizing in the library quite a
lot of late until 10, reading history.
Guess you was down to see the world
series returns. No, I wasn't—The
Daily Palo Alto did the work nobly,
only nobody could read the writing
on the wall. Have an ex tomorrow so
can't write much now. It will be a
humdinger, as the old prof rules wi'fh
an iron hand and his questions wear
brass Iftiuckles. Great work old Duffy
Lewis did, wasn't it, ma? Wonder if
he's the guy that put the Duffy in the
pure malt whisky of that name? How
should you know? Only tliot. perhaps
vou might have seen the advs. same as
T did. Gee, Doth Hooper and Lewis
banged out homers yesterday. Duffy
batted .144 ma. If you ever batted
that high in anybody's affections you'd
appreciate that, average. Guess you
have batted .1000. Remember me to
your husband, by the way. Eight hits
In 18 times A.B. —not so bad, eh what
ma? Every time ho laid on the ball,
a couple of runs were chalked up.
And Harry Hooper, who used to go to
St. Mary's, somewhere up north in
the tulles, made a homer. A homer
ma, is related to an ordinary run as
a trip around the world is to a walk
to spit out of the window. Got 71 in
an exam last week —it was a pipe.
Never had to study for it —wanted to
test my memory. Luderus chalked up
7 hits out of 16 times A.B. Eddie
Burns, a native son. came through
with the mitt o.k. 1 met him once—
great fellow. Reminds me a bit of
father. I'm off now to pay some bills,
and the month's just half over. Edu
cation is no bargain. Much love and
an ocsulatory greeting, your
SONNY.
