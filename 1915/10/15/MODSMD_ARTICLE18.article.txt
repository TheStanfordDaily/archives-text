# MONTHLY CONTRIBITION TO BELGIANS FROM CAMPUS
## 
### 
With the return of approximately
three-fourths of the reports from the
Belgian Relief Campaign among the
men and women upon the campus the
committee in charge has every reason
to believe that $100 may he forwarded
each month from the Stanford commu
nity to the stricken nation.
This morning $95 in cash has been
accounted for from the canvas among
the men, with many outside districts
still to be heard from. This includes
contributions in cash and not the
monthly installments which have been
pledged. This inflation, on the other
hand, is offset by the fact that many
of the initial payments are yet to lie
made.
Owing to the fact that tlie canvas
among the women is not yet com
pleted, no definite report from them
can be made at the present time.
