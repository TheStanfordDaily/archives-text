# Inter class Tennis Starts on Friday
## 
### 
Another tennis classic in the form of
interchips university championships
will bo played 011 the Stanford courts
beginning next Friday afternoon.
This tournament is to be conducted
along entirely different lines than any
previous tournament. Members of
each class will bo forced to compete
against ono another for the class
championship, and by the process of
elimination the one left in the final
round will be entitled to play the
winners of the other classes. The
tournament has been divided into
throe sections, the freshmen compet
ing with the sophomores for the un
derclass championships and the juniors
against seniors for the upperclass
championships. The winners of the
two sections will then compete against
each other for the university cham
pionship. In this final tournament
there will be both singles and doubles.
The winners of the class champion
ships will be awarded numerals, as
will the winners of the singles and
doubles.
Another important change from tho
regular routine is to be found in the
exhibition games which are to be
played by members of the varsity
squad. These first team men will com
pete against one another in the hope
of finding and correcting faults which
would otherwise go unnoticed. All
men interested in the interclass tour
nament and who wish to compete must
hand in their name to the class cap
tains. Captain J. S. Hutchinson will
manage the seniors, H. Weishoff the
juniors, Van Dyke Johns for the soph
omores, and G. Clover for the fresh
men.
