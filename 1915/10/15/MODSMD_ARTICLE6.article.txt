# WINGED "0" WILL AGAIN LINE UP AGAINST VARSITY
## Santa Clara Second String Will Meet All-Blacks-Babes Play Fremont 
### 
Two stellar athletic attractions are
booked for the Stanford turf tomor
row afternoon, which promise to keep
a well filled bleachers on the nervous
edge from the opening whistle to the
final gun-shot. For the third time
this season the white-clad Olympic
ruggers are to hook up with the var
sity, while the All-Blacks are primed
for a match with the Santa Clara sec
ond aggregation. A little jaunt to the
exposition grounds has been arranged
for the freshmen, who are to line up
against Fremont high school on the
Marina.
Olympic Team Improved
Two weeks ago Stanford ran
through the Winged "O" fifteen for
scores like sand through a tin horn.
Tomorrow, however, the clubmen are
bringing a well-balanced team to the
campus, which will make its support
ers sit up and take notice.
Only slight changes have been made
by Coach Brown in the personnel of
the varsity. The front rank combina
tion will be Soper, Bihlman, and
Knight, with Rehir °nd Bloeser right
behind at middle rank. The pack will
be locked together by Halsted. The
usual pair of breakaways, Wylie and
Braden, will skirt the scrum.
Itackfield Changes
Art Erb is scheduled to initiate the
backfield passing rushes.from his po
sition at half. The five-eighths this
week find still another switch. Wal
ker v.-ill hold down first five, with Ur
ban following. As has been a custom
for three seasons, Danny Carroll will
occupy center three-quarters. Ric
Templeton and Swigart complete the
line as opposite wings. Last defense
again falls to Hob Templeton.
When the Santa Clara and Stanford
second stringers have their get-to
gether, a battle royal should ensue of
more or less hair-raising nature. The
mission team line-up includes a half
[ dozen men who have seen service on
| the varsity, and a number of substi
| tutes. The All-Blacks, however, will
present their full quota of strength as
: opposition.
Freshmen vs. Fremont
Fremont high school versus the Stan
| ford freshmen on the exposition Ma
j rira should produce some excellent
| rugby for the benefit of the fair vis
| itors. The first year line-up remains
j practically unchanged from that of
Wednesday's game.
During the forenoon Cogswell will
j meet the third varsity on the local
J turf. The All-Black-Santa Clara game
j will l)e called at 2:30 o'clock, while
I the varsity-Olympic contest will com-
I mence one hour later. The C>reys are
I scheduled to journey to San Jose to
J meet the College of Pacific.
