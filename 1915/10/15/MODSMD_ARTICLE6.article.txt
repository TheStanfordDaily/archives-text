# WINGED "0" WILL AGAIN LINE UP AGAINST VARSITY
## Santa Clara Second String Will Meet All-Blacks-Babes Play Fremont 
### 
Two stellar athletic attractions are
booked for the Stanford turf tomor
row afternoon, which promise to keep
a well filled bleachers on the nervous
edge from the opening whistle to the
final gun-shot. For the third time
this season the white-clad Olympic
ruggers are to hook up with the var
sity, while the All-Blacks are primed
for a match with the Santa Clara sec
ond aggregation. A little jaunt to the
exposition grounds has been arranged
for the freshmen, who are to line up
against Fremont high school on the
Marina.
Olympic Team Improved
Two weeks ago Stanford ran
through the Winged "O" fifteen for
scores like sand through a tin horn.
Tomorrow, however, the clubmen are
bringing a well-balanced team to the
campus, which will make its support
ers sit up and take notice.
Only slight changes have been made
by Coach Brown in the personnel of
the varsity. The front rank combina
tion will be Soper, Bihlman, and
Knight, with Rehir Â°nd Bloeser right
behind at middle rank. The pack will
be locked together by Halsted. The
usual pair of breakaways, Wylie and
Braden, will skirt the scrum.

backfield passing rushes.from his po

week find still another switch. Wal

for three seasons, Danny Carroll will
