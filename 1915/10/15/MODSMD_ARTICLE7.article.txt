# English Club Will Show Three Skits
## 
### 
A man about, town, an Arabian
maiden, a war clerk, a spinster, a
married woman, a desert shirk, a civil
engineer, and a French soldier will
each in turn play his bit of life on the
stage of the Playhouse in Palo Alto
tomorrow evening.
To transpose Shakespeare for the
nonce, the stage will be a world
wherein we see by turns London, Ara
bia. Vienna. Satire, tragedy, comedy,
will succeed each other. There is va
riety promised by the English Club
players for tomorrow's program that
would make a vaudeville bill confess
to sameness. The standard of the per
formance will be of a quality to at
tract a professor, the interest would
hold a sophomore in the engineering
department in his seat.
Arabian cruelty and mystery will
be the theme of the first play of the
evening, Strindberg's "Simoon." It is
full of oriental color and dramatic fire.
The revenge motive which runs
through the play finds its best expres
sion in the character of Biskra, which
Miss Nellita Choate, '17, interprets
with dramatic power.
The other offerings of the evening
will be Bennett's "A Good Woman,"
and Schnitzler's "Christmas Present."
The performance will begin promptly
at eight o'clock at the Playhouse, lo
cated on the corner of Ohanning and
Bryant streets in Palo Alto. Admis
sion will be thirty-five cents. There
are no reserved seats.
