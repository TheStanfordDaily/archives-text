degree from Cooper Medical College,
which has since become the Medical
department of Stanford, of which Dr.
Wilbur has been the head since 1910.
Well Fitted for Position
It was the executive and administra
tive ability shown in this position
which chiefly called him to the atten
tion of the Board of Trustees as the
man best fitted to assume the presi
dency of the university.
Dr. Wilbur has gained a very sub
stantial reputation as a teacher, and
as a practicing physician has won a
place so high in the esteem of the
medical profession that he is con
stantly called into consultation in dif
ficult cases.
lias Improved Medical School
Under Dr. Wilbur's direction ar.d
inspiration, the Stanford Medical
School has constantly raised its stan
dards, until they are on a par with
those of any such institution in the
country. In many directions, Dean
Wilbur" and the Stanford Medical
School have been pioneers in medical
education throughout the west.
Many medical and scientific socie
ties claim Dr. Wilbur as a member.
He is a fellow of the American Asso
ciation for the Advancement of Sci
ence; a member of the American

Academy of Medicine, of which he
was president in 1912-13; and belongs
to the Association of American Physi
cians, the American Medical Associa
tion and the California Academy of
Medicine.
He was married in 1898 to Miss
Marguerite May Blake, of San Fran
cisco, a graduate of Stanford in 1897,
and is the father of five children.

John Casper Branner came into of
fice when Chancellor Jordan retired
in 1913. At that time he announced
that he would hold the presidency for
only two years. When the two years
were up, however, the Trustees per
suaded Dr. Branner to continue in
office, with the understanding that he
would remain only until such time as
his successor should be selected.
Therefore, upon receiving word from
the Trustees that Dr. Wilbur was their
choice, Dr. Branner tendered his res
ignation, timing his retirement for the
end of this semester, in order that Dr.
Wilbur may have time to familiarize
himself with some of the details of
his new task.
No Definite Plans
Dr. Branner has no plans for the
immediate future, except that, he will
devote some time after he relinquishes
the presidency to revisions of his
Portuguese grammar and his text book
on geology. He will continue to oc
cupy his office in the Geology building
after retirement, and will live on the
campus. He retires upon Carnegie
pension.
Dr. Branner was born in New Mar

LL. D. degree from a considerable
number of universities. From 1885 to
1892 he was professor of geology in
the University of Indiana, which was
then under the presidency of Dr. Jor

Wilbur Is Stanford Graduate
Dr. Wilbur, an alumnus of Stanford, is a young man for the position

to California when he was a boy.
Graduating from the Riverside high

year. In 1809 he received the M. D.
degree from Cooper Medical College,
which has since become the Medical
department of Stanford, of which Dr.
Wilbur has been the head since 1910.
Well Fitted for Position
It was the executive and administra
tive ability shown in this position
which chiefly called him to the atten
tion of the Board of Trustees as the
man best fitted to assume the presi
dency of the university.
Dr. Wilbur has gained a very sub
stantial reputation as a teacher, and
as a practicing physician has won a
place so high in the esteem of the
medical profession that he is con
stantly called into consultation in dif
ficult cases.
lias Improved Medical School
Under Dr. Wilbur's direction ar.d
inspiration, the Stanford Medical
School has constantly raised its stan
dards, until they are on a par with
those of any such institution in the
country. In many directions, Dean
Wilbur" and the Stanford Medical

education throughout the west.
Many medical and scientific socie

He is a fellow of the American Asso

Academy of Medicine, of which he
was president in 1912-13; and belongs
to the Association of American Physi

John Casper Branner came into of

only two years. When the two years

No Definite Plans

Wilbur Is Stanford Graduate
Dr. Wilbur, an alumnus of Stanford, is a young man for the position

degree from Cooper Medical College,
which has since become the Medical
department of Stanford, of which Dr.
Wilbur has been the head since 1910.
Well Fitted for Position
It was the executive and administra
tive ability shown in this position
which chiefly called him to the atten

man best fitted to assume the presi
dency of the university.
Dr. Wilbur has gained a very sub
stantial reputation as a teacher, and
as a practicing physician has won a
place so high in the esteem of the
medical profession that he is con
stantly called into consultation in dif
ficult cases.
lias Improved Medical School
Under Dr. Wilbur's direction ar.d
inspiration, the Stanford Medical
School has constantly raised its stan

Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Dean of the Stanford Medical School,
has been appointed to succeed Dr. John Casper liranner as president of
the university, subsequent to the latter's resignation taking effect De
cember 31, 1915.
On October 12, the Board of Trustees, in compliance with its
agreement with President Branner, informed him that the choice of
his successor had been made. Dr. Branner replied immediately by ten
dering his resignation. The trustees held a special meeting on the next
day, drawing up resolutions accepting the resignation and appointing
Dr. Wilbur to fill the office, his term to commence on the first day of January,
1916. A copy of these resolutions, together with a letter from W. Mayo New
hall, President of the Board of Trustees, came to President Branner yester
day, and he today made the matter public.
Wilbur Is Stanford Graduate
Dr. Wilbur, an alumnus of Stanford, is a young man for the position
which he will hold, being but forty years of age. He was born in Boones-

boro, lowa, on April 13, 1875, but came
to California when he was a boy.
Graduating from the Riverside high
school, he entered Stanford, from
which lie received his A. B. degree in
ISOG and his Master's the following
year. In 1809 he received the M. D.
degree from Cooper Medical College,
which has since become the Medical
department of Stanford, of which Dr.
Wilbur has been the head since 1910.
Well Fitted for Position
It was the executive and administra
tive ability shown in this position
which chiefly called him to the atten
tion of the Board of Trustees as the
man best fitted to assume the presi
dency of the university.
Dr. Wilbur has gained a very sub
stantial reputation as a teacher, and
as a practicing physician has won a
place so high in the esteem of the
medical profession that he is con
stantly called into consultation in dif
ficult cases.
lias Improved Medical School
Under Dr. Wilbur's direction ar.d
inspiration, the Stanford Medical
School has constantly raised its stan
dards, until they are on a par with
those of any such institution in the
country. In many directions, Dean
Wilbur" and the Stanford Medical
School have been pioneers in medical
education throughout the west.
Many medical and scientific socie
ties claim Dr. Wilbur as a member.
He is a fellow of the American Asso
ciation for the Advancement of Sci
ence; a member of the American

Academy of Medicine, of which he
was president in 1912-13; and belongs
to the Association of American Physi
cians, the American Medical Associa
tion and the California Academy of
Medicine.
He was married in 1898 to Miss
Marguerite May Blake, of San Fran
cisco, a graduate of Stanford in 1897,
and is the father of five children.
Commended by Dr. Kraimer
President Branner says of the fu
ture head of Stanford: "Dr. Wilbur
is not only one of the most prominent
alumni of Stanford University, but his
successful organization and adminis
tration of the medical school and his
high standing in the medical profes
sion strongly recommended him to the
Board of Trustees. He is familiar
with the early history of the univer
sity and with the conditions that must
be met by the new president, both in
and out of the institution."
John Casper Branner came into of
fice when Chancellor Jordan retired
in 1913. At that time he announced
that he would hold the presidency for
only two years. When the two years
were up, however, the Trustees per
suaded Dr. Branner to continue in
office, with the understanding that he
would remain only until such time as
his successor should be selected.
Therefore, upon receiving word from
the Trustees that Dr. Wilbur was their
choice, Dr. Branner tendered his res
ignation, timing his retirement for the
end of this semester, in order that Dr.
Wilbur may have time to familiarize
himself with some of the details of
his new task.
No Definite Plans
Dr. Branner has no plans for the
immediate future, except that, he will
devote some time after he relinquishes
the presidency to revisions of his
Portuguese grammar and his text book
on geology. He will continue to oc
cupy his office in the Geology building
after retirement, and will live on the
campus. He retires upon Carnegie
pension.
Dr. Branner was born in New Mar
ket, Tennessee, on July 4, 1850. He
took the degree of B. S. from Cornell
in 1874 and that of Ph. D. from Indi
ana in 1885. He has also received the
LL. D. degree from a considerable
number of universities. From 1885 to
1892 he was professor of geology in
the University of Indiana, which was
then under the presidency of Dr. Jor
dan. In 1892 Dr. Jordan called Presi
dent Branner to Stanford, where he
has remained ever since.

nation, the resolutions of the Board
