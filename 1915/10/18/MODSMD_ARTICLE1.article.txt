# DOUBLE VICTORY WON ON STANFORD TURF SATURDAY
## ALL-BLACKS VS. SANTA CLARA Varsity Plows Through Olympics for Big Score---Freshmen Annex Close Game 
### 
Both at home and abroad Stanford
football teams were returned victo
rious during Saturday's play, every
one of the five contests resulting fa
vorably to the Cardinal hopes. The
varsity trampled over the Winged "O"
aggregation to the sound of 49 to 8,
Santa Clara second stringers fell be
fore the All-Blacks 10 to 8, while the
freshmen annexed 16 to 13 over the
Oakland high school ruggers.
As regards general excitement, the
Santa Clara-Stanford second varsity
match took the laurels for the after
noon's games on the home ground. A
more evenly contested bout would
have been impossible to stage.
First Half Scoreless
The first half proved void of actual
scores, although there were many in
stances of near tries. Soon after the
whistle announced the opening of the
second period, Johnson for the All-
Blacks dashed ten yards after taking
from the ruck for the initial try. West
converted. At this point the mission
aggregation took a new lease on life
which resulted in heavy casualties.
Shellenback, after an extended drib
bling rush, managed to cover across
the line for three points. Jackson
failed at goal. Mulholland to Con
ners for twenty yards permitted the
latter to register a few minutes later.
Jackson's conversion left the count 8
to 5 in Santa Clara's favor,
llainmon and West Sliine
Stanford came right back with a
thirty yard passing rush, Clreve to
Gladstone to Haninion, the last named
making a spectacular hurdle for a
side-line try, thereby tying the score.
With the count even, West did the im
possible by placing the pigskin square
between the posts for a beautiful con
version that gave Stanford the shade
in a hard-fought battle.
Varsity Swamps Olympics
Making all allowances for the Olym
pic Club's being considerably strength
ened over its past appearance, the
manner in which the varsity piled up
tallies almost at will was criminal in
nature. Erb, Bloeser, Hie Templeton,
Swigart, Braden, and Wylie, on three
occasions, should be credited with
well-earned tries in the first half.
Three conversions were hung up by
Holi Templeton. The Olympic Club
managed to pile up eight points while
the varsity was playing tag with the
ball. Each time Lachmund was the
pivot, scoring a try, and initiating a
passing rush which permitted Milli
ken to register. Hale converted once.
The second period proved a pleas
ing repetition. Knight, Templeton,
Braden and Dievendorff all took turns
at crossing the danger line. Bob Tem
pleton added to the score board total
with a conversion and a penalty goal.
The Winged "O" energy was all spent,
in patching up some suitable means
of defense.
Fresh man-Oakland (Jame Close
Oakland high school proved rather
a tough proposition for the Stanford
freshmen to handle with any degree
of success as the final score of 10 to 13
will indicate. Trys by Davis, Pelouzo,
Boydston, and Stephens, plus a brace
of conversions by Boulware made the
total. A good crowd of exposition fans
turned out to see the unusual athletic
attraction.

As regards general excitement, the
Santa Clara-Stanford second varsity
match took the laurels for the after
noon's games on the home ground. A
more evenly contested bout would
have been impossible to stage.
First Half Scoreless
The first half proved void of actual
scores, although there were many in
stances of near tries. Soon after the
whistle announced the opening of the
second period, Johnson for the All-
Blacks dashed ten yards after taking
from the ruck for the initial try. West
converted. At this point the mission
aggregation took a new lease on life
which resulted in heavy casualties.
Shellenback, after an extended drib
bling rush, managed to cover across
the line for three points. Jackson
failed at goal. Mulholland to Con
ners for twenty yards permitted the
latter to register a few minutes later.
Jackson's conversion left the count 8
to 5 in Santa Clara's favor,
llainmon and West Sliine
Stanford came right back with a
thirty yard passing rush, Clreve to
Gladstone to Haninion, the last named
making a spectacular hurdle for a
side-line try, thereby tying the score.
With the count even, West did the im
possible by placing the pigskin square
between the posts for a beautiful con
version that gave Stanford the shade
in a hard-fought battle.
Varsity Swamps Olympics
Making all allowances for the Olym
pic Club's being considerably strength
ened over its past appearance, the
manner in which the varsity piled up
tallies almost at will was criminal in
nature. Erb, Bloeser, Hie Templeton,
Swigart, Braden, and Wylie, on three
occasions, should be credited with
well-earned tries in the first half.
Three conversions were hung up by
Holi Templeton. The Olympic Club
managed to pile up eight points while
the varsity was playing tag with the
ball. Each time Lachmund was the
pivot, scoring a try, and initiating a
passing rush which permitted Milli
ken to register. Hale converted once.
The second period proved a pleas
ing repetition. Knight, Templeton,
Braden and Dievendorff all took turns
at crossing the danger line. Bob Tem
pleton added to the score board total
with a conversion and a penalty goal.
The Winged "O" energy was all spent,
in patching up some suitable means
of defense.
Fresh man-Oakland (Jame Close
Oakland high school proved rather
a tough proposition for the Stanford
freshmen to handle with any degree
of success as the final score of 10 to 13
will indicate. Trys by Davis, Pelouzo,
Boydston, and Stephens, plus a brace
of conversions by Boulware made the
total. A good crowd of exposition fans
turned out to see the unusual athletic
attraction.

bling rush, managed to cover across
the line for three points. Jackson
failed at goal. Mulholland to Con
ners for twenty yards permitted the
latter to register a few minutes later.
Jackson's conversion left the count 8
to 5 in Santa Clara's favor,
llainmon and West Sliine
Stanford came right back with a
thirty yard passing rush, Clreve to
Gladstone to Haninion, the last named
making a spectacular hurdle for a
side-line try, thereby tying the score.
With the count even, West did the im
possible by placing the pigskin square
between the posts for a beautiful con
version that gave Stanford the shade
in a hard-fought battle.
Varsity Swamps Olympics
Making all allowances for the Olym
pic Club's being considerably strength
ened over its past appearance, the
manner in which the varsity piled up
tallies almost at will was criminal in
nature. Erb, Bloeser, Hie Templeton,
Swigart, Braden, and Wylie, on three
occasions, should be credited with
well-earned tries in the first half.
Three conversions were hung up by
Holi Templeton. The Olympic Club
managed to pile up eight points while
the varsity was playing tag with the
ball. Each time Lachmund was the
pivot, scoring a try, and initiating a
passing rush which permitted Milli
ken to register. Hale converted once.
The second period proved a pleas
ing repetition. Knight, Templeton,
Braden and Dievendorff all took turns
at crossing the danger line. Bob Tem
pleton added to the score board total
with a conversion and a penalty goal.
The Winged "O" energy was all spent,
in patching up some suitable means
of defense.
Fresh man-Oakland (Jame Close
Oakland high school proved rather
a tough proposition for the Stanford
freshmen to handle with any degree
of success as the final score of 10 to 13
will indicate. Trys by Davis, Pelouzo,
Boydston, and Stephens, plus a brace
of conversions by Boulware made the
total. A good crowd of exposition fans
turned out to see the unusual athletic
attraction.
