# ENGLISH CLUb PLAYS PROVE DRAMATIC TREAT
## ACTORS TRIUMPH IN SIMOON Gordon Davis as French Soldier Sets High Standard for Stanford Dramatics 
### 
The English Club plays of Saturday
evening were an oasis in our desert
of dramatic inanity. Beyond their
merit as individual performances,
stands their importance as an effort
to give local audiences plays of liter
ary merit, an effort which is destined
to find appreciation.
The most artistic performance of
the evening was certainly Strind
berg's "Simoom." As Biskra, the Ara
bian maiden, Miss Nellita Choate was
admirable. She sounded with equal
power the notes of hate, yearning,
and cruelty.
Davis Is Strong
Gordon Davis as the French soldier
is responsible for a. piece of acting
which lias of late no parallel in Stan
ford dramatics. His interpretation of
Guimard was full of beauty and in
tensity. G. A. Hughes made the most
of a part with no great dramatic op
portunities. His Youssef was strong
and picturesque. It is to him, how
ever, that credit is due for the direc
tion of all three plays.
In "A Christmas Present" Miss
Laura Stevick and Sherwood Chap
man gave a satisfactory performance
of a most difficult bit of drama. Al
though the individuality of the char
acters was but roughly sketched in
the denouement lost none of its charm
thereby.
Faroe Scores
Bennett's clever farce, "A Good
Woman," might also be charged with
absence of subtlety in the acting. But
though it was burlesque rather than
satire, it was undeniably good. F. C.
McColloch showed us that he is not
always serious behind the footlights
by keeping the audience in chuckles
at his stolid mock-romantic James
Brett.
J. C. Cross acted the part of the
susceptible and self-sacrificing Gerald
with spirit and with a naive faculty
for letting the audience see how ridic
ulous the fair Rosie really could make
herself. The kimona clad lady was
made to patter and weep around the
stage in a most effective manner by
Miss Dorothy Egbert.
