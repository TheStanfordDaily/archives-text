# The 						Staff

### 
We are glad to announce today the
staff promotions and elections which
follow a seven-week tryout period.
The members of the staff whose
names appear once more on the list,
have worked hard and well since the
beginning of the semester. Two new
ly appointed sophomores, and ten
freshmen are a valuable addition to
the roll.
Frank Jacques Leard, '17, of Great
Falls, Montana; Anita Allen, '17, of
Palo Alto, and Herbert Stanton Mar
shutz, '17, of Los Angeles, are ad
vanced to the position of news editors.
Their efforts in the interest of The
Daily Palo Alto have been consistent
and intelligent, and the promotions are
announced with sincere pleasure.
Lawrence Walker Brown of Oak
land, and James Mhoon Sawtelle of
Tucson, are added to the roster of
sophomores. The freshman members
of the staff are: Carl Albert Randan
of Los Angeles; William Bryan Ad
ams of San Jose; Neil H. Petree of
San Jose; William McDermott Owen
of Los Angeles; Walter Emil Bruns
of Oakland; William Denney Smalley,
'18, of Pasadena; Joseph Aloysius
Murphy of Chico; William Scripps
Kellogg of Altadena; Albert C. Bob
bins, Jr., of Los Angeles, and Landis
Osborn Weaver of Fresno.
Three women who by their efforts
have qualified for election to the staff
at this time are the Misses Hester Rob
inson, '18, of Trabuco; Fannie Knox,
'18, of Palo Alto; and Gladys E. Mc-
Cue, '16, of Palo Alto.
The day of staff appointments is
also, unhappily enough, the occasion
for publishing the resignations of
some valued assistants. C. R. Wake
field, '1(i, who for two years and a half
served creditably as a reporter, and
as news editor, has resigned because
of pressure of other work. G. C. Col
lins, '17, who for two years has been
of unusual value, is also obliged to
drop his work with the staff.
Other resignations are deemed
necessary by the men concerned, and
which we acknowledge with regret,
are those of P. S. Gage, '18, A. I). Wil
kie, '18, E. I). Kneass, '18, and J. L.
Hankins, '18.
