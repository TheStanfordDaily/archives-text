# Mission Town Ruggers Defeat Titans Sunday by Overwhelming Score
## 
### 
The University of Santa Clara rugby
team literally smeared the Titan Club
yesterday on the college turf by a 41
to 0 score. The game, while one
sided, was hard fought and interesting
throughout. It was featured by fast
passing rushes on the part of the Mis
sion town baekfield and a wonderful
drop kick from the forty-yard line
for three points by Hates, Santa Clara
front-ranker.
The line-ups were as follows: San
ta Clara —forwards, Keating, Amarel,
O'Neil, Hates, Schellenback, Hiekey,
Pye, Higgins, and Coschino; Hacks,
Diaz, Scholz, Fowler, Wassum, Mul
holland, Fitzpatrick, Curtin, Milburn,

Titan Club —forwards, Haronidas,
Lewis, Helgrian, Link, Newar, Miller,
and Hamilton; backs, Montgomery,
Sage, Fishburn, August, Forbes, Sla
ter, Krone, Coleman, and Cole.
