# DR. MACDONALD PLEADS FOR SERVICE TO HUMANITY
## DELIVERS FORCEFUL SERMON Emphasizes Demands Upon Youth in Morning Address and Encina Meeting 
### 
Before one of the largest congrega
tions that has attended the Memorial
church this semester, Dr. John A.
Macdonald, editor of the Toronto
"Globe," spoke yesterday morning on
"The Success of the North American
International Achievement." Dr. Mac
donald, who is well known both as a
public speaker and peace advocate,
occupied the university church pulpit
for the second time in four years.
According to Dr. Macdonald, the
world's history for the past four years
has been marked by two outstanding
events. The first of these was the
celebration of one hundred years of
peace between the United States and
England, and the second was the co
lossal failure of the civilization of
Europe.
"North America must suffer for
Europe's madness in the present
strife, but when the war is over we
shall find that the friendship of the
United States and Canada is stronger
than ever before. These two friendly
nations with their four thousand
miles of unfortified boundary lines,
will set a powerful example before
the bankrupt nations of Europe," said
the Canadian newspaperman, who em
phasized the importance of applying
North American international meth
ods to Europe.
"It will demand the services of the
young men of today to bring peace
and justice to this crucified world,
and the men of the United States, the
greatest of the world's republics, will
have to take a leading part in this
work."
Appealing to the men oÂ° Stanford
and of all other universities to pre
pare to serve rather than to exploit
mankind in their life work, Dr. John
A. Macdonald, who delivered such a
forceful sermon in the Memorial
church yesterday morning, spoke last
night to the men in the Encina hall.
Dr. Macdonald was introduced by
President Hranner, who recalled in
his introductory talk the visit of Dr.
Macdonald to the Stanford campus
four years ago. The largest audience
that has attended an Encina meeting
this semester was present last night
to hear the noted Canadian newspa
perman and peace advocate.
"The scarcity of young men in the
world upon the close of this war will
call the greatest activity on the part
of the present generation of Ameri
cans, for they will have to take the
place of the best men in all countries
who are now in battle," said Dr. Mac
donald.
"It will demand the highest type of
moral character to enable the young
men to live up to the demands that
will be made upon them.
"This war is a great socializing
event in the history of mankind in
that it is bringing all classes of people
to a realization of similar responsibili
ties. After the war is over we will
never be able to go back to the 'dog
eat dog' methods of earlier times, for
we will have come to a realization of
the futility of such practice.
"In order to perform a real service
one must have a love tor mankind and
an interest in all men. The power of
a personality is measured not in tech
nical power but in the high aim of
the individual, and back of everything
is the character and motive of self."
