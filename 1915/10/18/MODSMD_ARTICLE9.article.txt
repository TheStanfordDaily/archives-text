# JOLLY-UPS FOR ALL
## Four Classes to Gather Friday Evening Simultaneously 
### 
Four jolly-ups and the Masquers'
jinks all on one evening, will be the
treat of next Friday to Stanford stu
dents. If plans of the jolly-up com
mittees of four classes are successful
Friday's string of festivities will be
gin as shortly after seven o'clock as
possible and will continue to the usual
closing time of midnight.
The plan now is to hold Masquers'
jinks early enough so that the jolly
ups can be on in full force before ten
o'clock, and to make this possible,
Class Presidents F. S. Murray, '16, H.
H. Dievendorff, '17, and N. R. Allen,
'18, will unite in a request that Mas
quers open the jinks Friday evening
in the Assembly Hall before eight
o'clock if possible.
Seniors and juniors will unite for
one jolly-up to be held in Encina Club
room. Appropriate stunts are being
planned by the joint jolly-up com
mittee.
The sophomore jolly-up was at first
planned for last Friday night in the
gym, but was postponed until Novem
ber 6, to make way for the training
table dance. However, owing to the
refusal of Roble Chili to open the date
of the Roble Formal at the request of
the Executive Committee, the jolly-up
could not be held at that time. Some
thing entirely new in the way of jolly
up stunts is promised by the second
year committee that has charge of the
Friday night entertainment in the gym.
As soon after nine o'clock as possi
ble the freshman class will gather at
the Armory in Palo Alto for its first
jolly-up. A five-piece class orchestra
will furnish the music. An attractive
stunt program and novel refreshments
are promised by the freshman com
mittee.
To co-operate with the Jolly-up com
mittees Masquers has made soft shirts
in order at the jinks in the Assembly
Hall and students can go directly from
the program to the jolly-up.
