## PLAYERS SEEK COMPETITION Peter Claudeanos, Leader of Prison Club, Writes to Stanford President 
### 
Stanford may compete in chess with
San Quentin as the result of an inter
esting letter which lias been received
from a convict of San Quentin prison.
The president of the San Quentin
Chess Cluh challenges the Stanford
Chess Club to a series of correspon
dence games. The club, which is com
posed entirely of convicts, numbers
about sixty. In his letter the challen
ger boasts that his fellow members
are considered good inside the prison;
but on the outside they are mas
ters at the game. The Chess Club will
meet tomorrow night at Encina to ar
range a series of contests with the
Palo Alto Chess Club and tlie faculty
members who are followers of the
game.
The following is the letter:
"San Quentin, Cal.,
October 11, 1915.
Mr. Burbank:—
My Dear Sir. —Please excuse me for
taking the liberty in addressing to you
this letter, not knowing you at all.
The writer, if you will excuse me,
is a prisoner confined in this prison
and your name was given to me and
told to write to. We have here a chess
club with over sixty members; and
games going on by correspondence
with different players in the state.
Some in San Diego, San Jose, Alame
da, Oakland, San Francisco and the
University of California. The presi
dent of the California Chess Club and
a Professor Leroy of the same place
are at present matched up with differ
ent members of our club. We are also
playing two games with San Fran
cisco ( liess Club of San Francisco.
Now I wish in behalf of our club,
San Quentin Chess Club, to challenge
your club in two games of chess simul
taneously, games to be played accord
ing to your club rules, if your club
wishes. \lso if there is any member
that would care to play a couple of
personal games with any one of us in
here we would be glad to have him.
We have in here chess players that
are considered good in here, but out
side, masters at the game.
You would hardly realize the treat
that it gives us to have the pleasure
of playing some of you gentlemen.
As we are all locked up here for a
long time it is hard for us to find out
side talent and have to resort to these
means to get in touch with some. Mr.
Stephenson of the University of Cali
fornia has just begun a personal game.
Hope that I may hear good news
from you soon, I remain,
Yours cordially,
PETER CLAUREANOS.
President of San Quentin Chess Club,
San Quentin, Cal."
