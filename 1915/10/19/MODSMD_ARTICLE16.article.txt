# World Legislature Is Belgian's Theme
## Senator La Fontaine Advances Theory for Establishment, of Universal Congress 
### 
"A proposal for a World Legisla
ture," was the subject on which Dr.
Henri La Fontaine, president of the
Belgian senate, addresesd the stu
dents of law this morning during the
10:15 hour.
"Present international law is for
the most part conventional," he be
gan. "It is a law made at conferences
of national representatives, some of
which include only a few states and
others most of the nations of the
world. The Hague Conference is an
example of the latter, sometimes
called a world parliament, but in real
ity not a parliament as we understand
one, but a meeting of ambassadors.
"It seems impossible to secure a
law chamber that would represent the
forces of the world, and with certain
changes, the form of The Conference
should he followed."
Senator La Fontaine then suggested
certain changes, among which were
the shifting of the place where the
calling of the congress, and the publi
of proceedings in all languages,
conference is held, the mechanical
cation of proceedings in all languages.
Dr. La Fontaine is in this country to
advance his theories on a world legis
lature and to further American inter
est in the movement, so that when the
present war is over, the United States
may take the lead in work of this kind,
hast evening lie addressed the Inter
national Polity Club of Stanford at the
home of Professor F. C. Woodward, on
"New International Law."
