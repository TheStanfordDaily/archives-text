# Unwelcome Jests

### 
There are roughs. And then again,
there are roughs. .lust the same as
there are varying grades ot' 'most
everything on the campus. The two
types are never seen in company, so
it is easy to sort them out, and label
them.
Now then, for a more detailed ac
count of the roughs on the one hand,
and the roughs on the other. Mem
bers of the first type are usually regu
lar guys. The only possible quarrel
any of us can have with them is that
*' .ey have a devilish way of getting by,
lat proper people can't imitate.
As for the second species, there isn't
thing to be said, except that its
embers belong to the genus "low
row," and that they are mentally un
kempt, and crawl very close to the
sod. Some people fall into that class
once in a while by mistake, but tumble
to themselves, and climb out. We con
gratulate them.
It's the chronic, bona fide rough
necks we want to sink the hooks into,
and here goes. Some of them broke
the lock on the Gym fence last Friday
and Saturday nights. Then with lad
ders stolen from tlie filtration plant
or elsewhere (never returned by the
way), they made their way to gallery
seats in the windows.
Prom their various points of van
tage they watched the football and
Gym Clul) dances. Some of them got
as far toward heaven as the roof
beams inside. And then followed a
brave assortment of catcalls, and
higher criticism of the "class" pres
ent, and other tokens of their breed.
There is a Conference ruling which
makes "roughing" at campus parties
a breach of good conduct, and there
fore a subject for discipline. That
law was never made necessary by the
self-respecting fellows in cords who
liked to watch the social game front
tiie outside occasionally. For the pol
luting cause you must look away be
neath them, at those demonstrative
creatures who constitute the inglori
ous brotherhood of unwelcome jests.
