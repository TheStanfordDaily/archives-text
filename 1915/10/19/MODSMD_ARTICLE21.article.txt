# PROFESSOR FAIRCLOUGH DISCUSSES CLASSIC ARCHITECTURE
## Roman and Grecian Styles Declared Predominant at Exposition 
### 
The Exposition City draws its ele
ments from various lands and various
ages, but amid all these elements the
dominant note is struck by the clas
sical styles of Greece and Rome.
The general conception of the
walled city, with its open courts, its
colonnades, and its lofty buildings, is
a variation upon the plan of an impe
rial forum of Rome, such as that of
Trajan, which was also a walled city
shut off from the more bustling every
day life of the world's metropolis, and
embracing broad piazzas, great basili
cas or temples, noble colonnades,
lofty columns, imposing statuary,
stately triumphal arches, and pictur
esque fountains.
The severity of the Doric order does
not appeal strongly to modern tasto,
and for specimens of this art at the
exposition we must turn to certain
state buildings, like that of Oregon,
outside the city proper. The other
classical orders, however, are freely
used. Greek Ionic columns fringe
the Court of Palms, and Roman Ionic
ones form the colonnade running
north from the Four Seasons court.
Rut the most conspicuous order is
the Corinthian, of all Greek orders the
most popular today, as it was in an
cient Rome. Much of the glory of the
exposition is due to the lavish use of
this ornate and beautiful order.
In the chief structural material of
the palaces the architects have suc
cessfully initiated the creamy traver
tine of ancient Rome. They also show
Rome's iutiuence in the use of mate
rials simulating marbles of various
colors. In the great palaces, they
have been inspired by such huge
structures as the Roman Thermae.
Tims Machinery Palace is strikingly
reminiscent of the l\iths of Caracalla.
