# TRUSTEES PROVIDE FOR A ROBLE POOL
## To Be Constructed in Connection With New Women's Gymnasium Near Geology Building 
### 
Provision has recently been made by
the Board of Trustees for the con
struction of a swimming pool for the
women, which will equal that of the
men. The site chosen is that already
allotted to the new women's gymna
sium, west of the Geology building. A
large rectangular bole has been dug,
but work will not be resumed until a
committee formulates definite plans.
Temporary dressing rooms will be
built around the tank, for use until the
gymnasium is constructed.
