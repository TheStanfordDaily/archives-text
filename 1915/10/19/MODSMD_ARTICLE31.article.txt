# LARGE CAST COMING WITH MLLE. LA GAI
## Famous Dancer Brings Brilliant Troupe for "The Gypsy" and "I Pagliacci" 
### 
A cast of forty people will be seen
on the stage of the Stanford Assembly
Hall Friday evening, October 129, when
.Mile. Louise La Gai, the dancer, with
her company presents "I Pagliacci"
and"The Gypsy." "I Pagliacci" will
be acted and danced in pantomime, to
the accompaniment of the largest Vic
trola in the world. "The Gypsy" will
include a revue of Hungarian and Rus
sian dancing, with a special portrayal
of the Hungarian ballot.
.Mile. La Gai comes to Stanford with
the same company that won the little
dancer additional fame at the exposi
tion this summer. Fifteen thousand
people—the largest audience ever as
sembled for any performance at the
fair —gathered at one time to hear and
see Mile. La Gai. It was by popular
demand that a half dozen similar per
formances were staged. Many of the
dancer's offerings are from her own
pen. "The Gypsy," a story of Hunga
rian love, is one of these, and includes
a dance of mirth, and a duel dance.
Society girls, ranging in age from
sixteen to twenty—three are part of
the La Gai ballet. Some of the cast
were seen on the Orpheum stage a
few months ago, and are declared by
critics exceptionally talented dancers.
Mile. La Gai herself was a child of the
dance, having first stepped before the
limelight when seven years old. She
lias studied in St. Petersburg, in Eng
land, France and Italy. Her career
includes two seasons with the ballet of
the Paris opera, a tour of London, and
the provinces, an American visit, then
Paris again. Since 1912 Mile. La Gai
has been with her own company in the
east. During the past summer session
at the University or California, she
taught a class of I .">OO women how to
dance. Among her pupils was Ted
Shawn, husband of ltuth St. Denis. As
a dancing teacher, Mile. La Gai won
her way into the hearts of all the
transbay population.

Gypsy" may now be bought from Glee
Club members and at the bookstore.
