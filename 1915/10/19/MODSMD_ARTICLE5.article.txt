# Players are Named for Friday Evening Jinks
## Many Dramatic Stars to Shine in Numerous Clever Skits Staged by Masquers 
### 
The Masquers' jinks will hold forth
Friday evening in the Assembly Hall,
beginning promptly at 8 o'clock, in or
der to co-operate with the class jolly
ups which are scheduled for a later
hour that evening. An extremely orig
inal and interesting vaudeville pro
gram is assured for the admission fee
of twenty-five cents.
Miss Ellen Galpin, J. R. Morgan, and
P. E. Leland will offer "The .Maker of
Dreams," a pretty phantasy by Oli
phant Down, with a charming mix
ture of pathos and irresponsibility.
Through this clever playlet runs a
strain of tender human passion that
is irresistible in appeal. "Pierrot,"
who at one moment is singing snatch
es of delightfully nonsensical verse
and at another is absorbed in the phi
losophy of tears, becomes a distinct
achievement in the hands of J. R.
Morgan, while Miss Galpin will have
a splendid opportunity as the "Pier
rette." P. E. Leland will demonstrate
a new phase of his talent in the grate
ful role of the manufacturer.
The professional skill of Miss Car
rie Goebel Weston, "violiniste excen
trique," needs no comment. Local
