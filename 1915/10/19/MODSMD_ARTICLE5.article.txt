# Players are Named for Friday Evening Jinks
## Many Dramatic Stars to Shine in Numerous Clever Skits Staged by Masquers 
### 
The Masquers' jinks will hold forth
Friday evening in the Assembly Hall,
beginning promptly at 8 o'clock, in or
der to co-operate with the class jolly
ups which are scheduled for a later
hour that evening. An extremely orig
inal and interesting vaudeville pro
gram is assured for the admission fee
of twenty-five cents.
Miss Ellen Galpin, J. R. Morgan, and
P. E. Leland will offer "The .Maker of
Dreams," a pretty phantasy by Oli
phant Down, with a charming mix
ture of pathos and irresponsibility.
Through this clever playlet runs a
strain of tender human passion that
is irresistible in appeal. "Pierrot,"
who at one moment is singing snatch
es of delightfully nonsensical verse
and at another is absorbed in the phi
losophy of tears, becomes a distinct
achievement in the hands of J. R.
Morgan, while Miss Galpin will have
a splendid opportunity as the "Pier
rette." P. E. Leland will demonstrate
a new phase of his talent in the grate
ful role of the manufacturer.
The professional skill of Miss Car
rie Goebel Weston, "violiniste excen
trique," needs no comment. Local
music lovers await Miss Weston's
first campus appearance with much
interest. The "Song liailats and Dev
il's Ditties," promised by Miss Mar
gery Bailey insure a decided comedy
treat. Miss Bailey's talent as a com
eidenne is of professional calibre and
certain to find a definite appeal.
.Miss Nellita Clioate and.1. R. Mor
gan will portray the leading charac
ters in "A Romance in Black and
White," a pantomimic masterpiece of
lights and draperies. Miss Choate's
brilliant work in "Sherwood" and "Si
moon" is of recent memory, while
Morgan has been identified as the star
of numerous Ham's Head shows. This
ull ifine conceit of Holland Hudson
glides along with the swiftness
of a motion picture and a profes
sional production of decided original
ity is assured. The complete cast of
the pantomime follows:

The Masquers' jinks will hold forth
Friday evening in the Assembly Hall,
beginning promptly at 8 o'clock, in or
der to co-operate with the class jolly
ups which are scheduled for a later
hour that evening. An extremely orig
inal and interesting vaudeville pro
gram is assured for the admission fee
of twenty-five cents.
Miss Ellen Galpin, J. R. Morgan, and
P. E. Leland will offer "The .Maker of
Dreams," a pretty phantasy by Oli
phant Down, with a charming mix
ture of pathos and irresponsibility.
Through this clever playlet runs a
strain of tender human passion that
is irresistible in appeal. "Pierrot,"
who at one moment is singing snatch
es of delightfully nonsensical verse
and at another is absorbed in the phi
losophy of tears, becomes a distinct
achievement in the hands of J. R.
Morgan, while Miss Galpin will have
a splendid opportunity as the "Pier
rette." P. E. Leland will demonstrate
a new phase of his talent in the grate
ful role of the manufacturer.
The professional skill of Miss Car
rie Goebel Weston, "violiniste excen
trique," needs no comment. Local
music lovers await Miss Weston's
first campus appearance with much
interest. The "Song liailats and Dev
il's Ditties," promised by Miss Mar
gery Bailey insure a decided comedy
treat. Miss Bailey's talent as a com
eidenne is of professional calibre and
certain to find a definite appeal.
.Miss Nellita Clioate and.1. R. Mor
gan will portray the leading charac
ters in "A Romance in Black and
White," a pantomimic masterpiece of
lights and draperies. Miss Choate's
brilliant work in "Sherwood" and "Si
moon" is of recent memory, while
Morgan has been identified as the star
of numerous Ham's Head shows. This
ull ifine conceit of Holland Hudson
glides along with the swiftness
of a motion picture and a profes
sional production of decided original
ity is assured. The complete cast of
the pantomime follows:
