# Nursery and Hothouse to Be Built Behind Clubhouse
## 
### 
A new step toward the beautifica
tion of the campus will be the trans
fering of the nursery from its present
location behind the medical building,
to a position between the two glass
domes recently placed near the road
that runs west from the post ofiice.
The domes will be connected by a
glass passageway to be used as a hot
house in connection with the nursery.
In the past the nursery has been
situated behind the medical building,
its large collection of valuable and
beautiful flowers hidden from visit
ors and students. In its new location
it will not only be of greater access
to the students wishing to purchase
flowers, but will also add much to the
attractiveness of the barren surround
ings of the buildings behind the post
office and the Women's Clubhouse.
J. E. Hewston, Farm Superintend
ent, has charge of the work.
