# FALL CREW TRAINING FOR FRESHMEN STARTS
## ORME MEETS MEN TOMORROW First Year Aspirants to Have Preliminary Workouts This Semester 
### 
Crew Captain C. H. Orme, '16, an
nounces that he is now ready to com
mence the preliminary instruction of
all freshmen who intend to sign up
for crew next spring and, at present,
are not engaged in other activities.
The nineteeners who are in a position
to take advantage of the opportunity
offered, are requested to report at the
Lagunita boatliouse tomorrow after
noon at five o'clock.
Since there is no water in the lake
and the rowing machines are not yet
ready for use, the greater part of the
time, at least for the present, will be
devoted to setting up exercises and
the task of getting in condition.
It should be borne in mind that this
early practice will not confer a par
ticular advantage on any one group
of men. The plan is being carried out
as a method of saving time. After the
men who start now have received in
struction in the fundamentals of the
sport, they may be left to themselves
to some extent when the large aggre
gation appears next semester.
