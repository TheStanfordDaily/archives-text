# Varsity Ruggers Win Matinee Argument from Town Club by Superior Condition and Forward Tactics
## GAME CLOSER THAN ONESIDED SCORE WOULD INDICATE Ragged Backfield Play Prevents Numerous Likely Trys. Score 28 to 3 
### 
Good competition was afforded the
Stanford Varsity this afternoon on the
home turf by the Palo Alto Athletic
club, a 28 to 3 count resulting:. The
initial half found the visitors well on
the defensive, but the second period
showed the tables somewhat reversed.
The Cardinal pack showed to ex
cellent advantage in all departments
of the same. The backfield, however,
seemed to have lost its usual com
bination charm. The game in detail
follows:
First Half
After ten minutes of unsuccessful
attack, during which time the club
players were twice forced to cover
behind their own line, a forward rush
from llalsted to Braden for thirty
yards allowed the latter to score.
Bob Templeton converted a difficult
goal. Following the kick-off. Urban
received from Walker and skirted the
blind side forty yards for a try. Tem
pleton added two points. A moment
later the same combination, Walker
to Urban, registered a try after a
short run. Templeton again con
verted. Wylie to Swigart for twenty
yards plus another conversion raised
the Stanford total to twenty. Just as
the whistle blew, Kirksey, for the
visitors, tore sixty yards for a
clever try. Kirksey failed to convert.
Score, 20-3.
Second Half.
With eight sideline men relieving,
the varsity presented a different ap
pearance. Although given many op
portunities, the backfield, through
ragged play, refused to materialize a
raft of points. Opening blood of the
period followed clever dribbling by
Card and covering by Chandler.
West failed to convert. Ric Temple
ton made a short sideline plunge for
the second try. A beautiful conver
sion by West raised the total to 2S
to 3, at which point the count re
mained until the end of the same.

attack, during which time the club
players were twice forced to cover
behind their own line, a forward rush
from llalsted to Braden for thirty
yards allowed the latter to score.
Bob Templeton converted a difficult
goal. Following the kick-off. Urban
received from Walker and skirted the
blind side forty yards for a try. Tem
pleton added two points. A moment
later the same combination, Walker
to Urban, registered a try after a
short run. Templeton again con
verted. Wylie to Swigart for twenty
yards plus another conversion raised
the Stanford total to twenty. Just as
the whistle blew, Kirksey, for the
visitors, tore sixty yards for a
clever try. Kirksey failed to convert.
Score, 20-3.
Second Half.
With eight sideline men relieving,
the varsity presented a different ap
pearance. Although given many op
portunities, the backfield, through
ragged play, refused to materialize a
raft of points. Opening blood of the
period followed clever dribbling by
Card and covering by Chandler.
West failed to convert. Ric Temple
ton made a short sideline plunge for
the second try. A beautiful conver
sion by West raised the total to 2S
to 3, at which point the count re
mained until the end of the same.
