Peculiar and opulent fortunes have
swooped down on the place. Only a
couple of years ago we used to stand
agape in the middle of Lasuen street,
and peer squint-eyed and wondering
at a few sparsely lunged motorcycles.
They were wont to amble about the
campus in wheezing tributes to Mam
mon, with singular jolts and eclat.
Otherwise the rustic solitude of the
Farm was atune with infinite quiet.
Nowadays the air is pungent with
the odor of spent gasoline, and poig
nant with the death-rattle of dull care.
Cars of varied pedigree fan the ether
uii and down our thoroughfares.
Wealth in our midst is noisy, and
reckless, and he who stands agape and
squint-eyed in the road purifies him
self, and becomes fit company for the
angels.
We are of those who walk, —not for
exercise, or because Heaven in
tended it so, —but we just walk. Also
we ponder deeply at the speed of the
fortunate automobiles, which move
without effort. And mean with envy
we scowl at the way some of them
have of dodging each other madly, car
ing not at all for us. And we remark
that sometimes some of them pene
trate the night without lights.
All of which is prejudiced exaggera
tion, but smatters slightly of truth.
And if someone should get bumped
tonight, tomorrow would be too late to
cut down the speed and so forth.
