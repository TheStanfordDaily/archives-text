# French Club May Stage Play
## 
### 
An Assembly Hall play may be
staged by the Stanford French Club
this year as a result of plans consid
ered last night when the club met at
the Chi Omega house. In past years
French plays have been produced suc
cessfully at Stanford and it is hoped
to revive the custom of presenting
them. Several small playlets in
French will be given at regular meet
ings of the club later in the year.
Moliere's "Le Bourgeois Gentil
homme" was interpreted at last night's
gathering by a cast composed of J. A.
Sellards, gr., H. L. Ward, '19, J. C.
Cross, '17, W. Harry, gr., and P. L.
Vaudoit, '18.
