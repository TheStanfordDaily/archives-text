# JINKS TICKETS FRIDAY
## Masquers' Sale to Start at 7:30 Curtain at 8 
### 
Tickets for the Masquers' jinks will
be placed on sale promptly at 7:30
o'clock Friday evening at two l>ox
offices in front of the Assembly Hall,
where tlie curtain will rise at 8 o'clock
sharp, in order that the program may
lie given in its entirety by 9:30. The
class jolly-lips scheduled for the same
evening will not start until after the
close of the jinks and there will be
no deviation from the plan to start the
performance on time.
The final dress rehearsal for "A Ro
mance in Black and White," the
clever pantomime which promises to
be the feature of the Masquers' pro
gram, will be held tonight in the As
sembly Hall. A princess, a shepherd,
a goat and a beggar vivify the nine
scenes of this original black-and
white fantasy, which refuses to be
placed in any of the accepted dramatic
categories. Baskt designs, Russian
dancing, Audrey Beardsley eccentrici
ties and old Egytian frieze-like hand
ling of hands and feet pass before the
audience in rapid succession, while at
one side of the stage W. B. Curtis, '16,
as the "Maker of Sounds," beats out
measure for measure by means of muf
fled drum and cymbal clashes, the va
rious pantomimic changes.
