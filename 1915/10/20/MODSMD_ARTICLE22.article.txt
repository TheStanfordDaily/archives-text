Sounds Like Refreshments
'Twas the night before something
or other, and there was nothing stir
ring in the house. There couldn't he
—the Sorority had retired, and all the
spoons were in the spoon holder.
Therefore there was nothing stirring.
Dorothy Le Suer, Palo Alto, Graph.,
24, Alpha Phi, was dreaming of Graph.,
120, and Honolulu, and so forth for
ever. She heard the breakers at Wai
kiki boom boomingly—but halt! She
sat up suddenly! The booming break
ers were caused by a noise below —on
the first floor. Dorothy, being a
graphic major, knew where to draw
the line. So she investigated. Noises
on the firet floor are supposed to cease
at 10:30 —they usually slow down
about 10:27. Armed with flashlight,
kimona, a bust of Napoleon, and a
small statue of the Alpha Phi house
father, Dorothy invaded the dark pre
cincts of floor I. The queer noise was
issuing from still lower depths—ver
ily from below board.
"I expect underhand work," quoth
Miss Le Suer.
Whereupon she opened the cellar
door, and threw the bust of Napoleon,
and the calcium light on one pale
countenance—that of Les Miller, '17.
Les blushed to the roots of his hair—
from there on the blushes blended into
the glaring hue of the scalp.
Dorothy slammed the door shut.
Only a piteons wail kept her from
phoning the cops. With her ear to the
keyhole, she heard Delta Chi's expla
nation.
"For the love of Mike and Punch
Judah, open the front door. You
locked her out. I was just investi
gating one of the six best cellars to
get into the house."
Never mind what time it was.
