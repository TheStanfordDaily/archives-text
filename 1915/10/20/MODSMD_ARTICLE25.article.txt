# PROFESSOR FAIRCLOUGH DISCUSSES CLASSIC ARCHITECTURE
## Roman and Grecian Styles Declared Predominant at Exposition 
### 
Note.â€”In today's issue we print the
concluding section of Professor Henry
It. Fairclough's discussion of exposi
tion architecture. The article follows:
Thoroughly classical is the idea, so
beautifully worked out, of supplement
ing the architecture with mural paint
ings and statuary. The colonnades of
the Roman Fora were adorned with
many pictures by Greek and native
artists, and in both the sheltered
spaces and the open courts were to be
seen bronze and marble statues. But
the most notable artistic effect which
the sunny skies of California have
permitted is the exquisite color
scheme of Jules Guerin, whose suc
cess will often J>e cited henceforth
as proof of the aesthetic correctness
of the Greeks in coloring their marble,
both in statuary and architecture.
In decorative friezes, sculptured re
liefs and various ornamental acces
sories we find classical motives repro
duced with such fidelity that one is
at times inclined to question their ap
propriateness. An instance of this is
the use of the ox-skull. But the Vic
tories crowning the gables, the out
spread eagles, the Canepliori, the
Caryatides and Roman lamps are both
significant and intrinsically beautiful.
The exposition domes have come
from Rome by way of Constantinople
and Paris. The half domes, too, re
mind us of ancient Roman churches
as well as such monuments as Con
stantino's Basilica. But nothing is
more distinctively reminiscent of
Rome than the great triumphal arches
which lead to the Court of the Uni
verse. The Column of Progress, too,
finds its prototype in the famous col
umn of Trajan, though the ship motif,
monotonously decorating the shaft, is
a feeble substitute for the elaborate
pictorial reliefs in Rome.
The classical features of the expo
sition culminate in the Fine Arts Pal
ace. The romantic and even spiritual
atmosphere investing the wonderful
creation is perfectly obvious, but
equally obvious is the fact that this
vision of beauty is classical in con
ception, general character and impor
tant details. We are transported in
imagination to a reconstructed Villa
of Hadrian or the palace of an impe
rial park. Mural paintings and sculp
tured friezes, the latter strikingly
Greek in tone, adorn the rotunda.
Many of the statues scattered about
are peculiarly classical in sentiment.
A landscape touch, reminiscent of
Sicily, is given by the papyrus in the
lagoon.
