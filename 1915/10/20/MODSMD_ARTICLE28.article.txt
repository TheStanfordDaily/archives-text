.Marines To Play
Stanford Soccerites
Stanford's peaceful campus will be
invaded Saturday by the fast U. S.
Marines' soccer team which will meet
the Stanford eleven at 10:30 a. m. on
the soccer field. As the Stanford-
Marines game on the exposition Ma
rina a fortnight ago was declared by
Coach H. W. Maloney to lie the best
in which Stanford lias ever played, a
first class soccer exhibition may be
anticipated.
