# Queening to All Jolly Ups To Be Au Fait Friday
## 
### 
"Gonna queen to the Masquers'
jinks Friday?"
"Yep. Are you?"
"Nope. I'm gonna go to the
jolly-up afterwards and I'd have to
ditch my girl."

Are you in this fix? Hear this then,
queener:
For the first time in years queen
ing at a Stanford jolly-up will be in
order—you won't have to sneak her
off or break a tradition—it will be the
proper thing under certain circum
stances.
Inasmuch as Masquers wants queen
ers at the jinks, and inasmuch as Mas
quers and the jolly-up committee are
uniting In this big Friday night stunt
with the show followed by class get
togethers, it has been decreed that
queeners can queen after the jinks
to the jolly-ups, it being understood
that all masculine queeners get the
feminine queeners to the proper jolly
up, for all classes need their fair
members Friday night.
Not that everyone has to queen—or
is expected to queen—for once the fair
ones are relieved of their fifty cent
pieces they—meaning both the fair
ones and the fifty cent pieces—will
become the property of the class for
the time being. Robber dances inter
mingled among straight dances will
be the sure preventive of queening be
tween the hours of 9:40 and 12:00,
for (he upperclassmen at Enoina, the
sophomores at the Gymnasium, and
the freshmen at the Armory.
