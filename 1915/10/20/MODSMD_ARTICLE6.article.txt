# College Graduates on Kaiser's Staff Aid to War Correspondents
## 
### 
Officers of von Kluck's army, who
were graduates of the German univer
sities, extended every conceivable
courtesy to the American correspon
dents following the invasion of Bel
gium, according to Arno Dosch, cor
respondent of the New York World
and the World's Work, in the course
of a brief conversation here yesterday.
Mr. Dosch, who is to lecture at the
Armory on the night of October 27,
declared that frequently in their effort
to follow the victorious army to the
French frontier, the correspondents
were halted by rear guards and sen
tries, and military officials left be
hind in the various communities.
In every case, Mr. Dosch averred,
these detentions would have meant
disaster to the American war corre
spondents had it not been for the
courteous intervention of the German
officers to whom they appealed.
"It is a queer thing," said Mr.
Dosch, "but we had no difficulty what
ever in identifying these officers as
college men, as each bore on his vis
age the 'schlager,' or dueling marks.
As is well known, there is quite a dif
ference in the character of these
marks, some of them being mere
scratches, while others are deep fur
ries. These are usually indicative of
the character of the man, and we in
variably enlisted the aid of an officer
who bore the deeper scars.
"They went to the bat for us at
once, and were particularly solicitous
on learning that we also were college
men. Tliey are fine fellows, all of
them, and quite conversant with the
history of American colleges. Stan
ford is well known to them, as are
Harvard, Yale and other Institutions
of similar rank."
