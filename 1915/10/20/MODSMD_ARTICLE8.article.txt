## Vanity Fair Pet Show Promises Many Entries 
### 
Have you entered your favorite ca
nine in the Vanity Fair dog show?
Only ten days remain before the beau
ties and joys of Vanity Fair will be
here, so "get busy" and enter your
pet. The advance agent of Cap and
Gown announces that all classes of
stuffed and live stock are to be shown.
For the small sum of ten cents one
may enter their favorite, whether bird
or beast.
Ribbons are to be awarded the prize
winners by the famous stock connois
seur who judged at the Vendome Hog
Show. Already entries have been
made in the Russian wolf hound, Tlos
ton bull, spaniel, and Scotch collie
class. Many of the dogs which took
blue ribbons at the recent Stockton
show are to be brought to Stanford on
October 30. Keenest sort of competi
tion is expected in the "cur" class.
Any entries may be made through
Miss Kleanor Walls at the Delta Gam
ma house.
