# NEW YELLS TO GREET BLEACHERS SATURDAY
## 
### 
A. A. Goldsmith, '16, has been
awarded the prize of five dollars for
the submission of the best yell. This
yell, and one other by A. S. Hutchin
son, '18, will be used on the bleachers
from now on.
The song contest was practically a
failure, none of the songs submitted
being what the committee desired. A
little time is still left before the Big
Game with Santa Clara, and the con
test will be left open until next Sat
urday night. If nothing is produced
up to that time, it will be necessary
to change the words of some of the
old songs.
The new yells will be printed very
shortly, and distributed in the bleach
ers. If successful songs are submit
ted they will also be printed.
