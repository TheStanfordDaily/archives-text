of view of the jolly-up committee,
the poet was right.
Here's the whole proposition in a
nut shell:
Queening's going to be in order
at the jolly-ups, under certain cir
cumstances. Said circumstances are
these —first, a couple of seats at the
Masquers' jinks; second, occupation
of said seats at the jinks; third, an
revoir to said seats—and hay-foot
straw-foot to the jolly-up, which
ever one it may be.

these questions for the poor over
worked jolly-up committees:
"Suppose she belongs at the frosh
jolly-up and T belong with the
seniors. What then?"
"Who pays the dues if a fellow
queens?"
"Wouldn't it break a tradition to
pay her half dollar?"
Such as these the committee re
fuse to worry about, having done
their duties in preparing for good
times, and given permission for
queeners to queen, if necessary, un
der proper conditions, namely—see
paragraph 3.
