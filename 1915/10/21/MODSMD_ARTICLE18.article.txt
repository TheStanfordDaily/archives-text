The baleful ghost of the Plug Ugly
poster fight and Quad rush between
the two upper classes, shows symp
toms of revival. Insomuch as the date
for the traditional rites of brawn and
barbarism lies only a few weeks off,
it has a good sized corner on campus
attention.
Rules for the conduct of the two
night soiree have been drafted by
a senior class committee, and will be
submitted for the approval of the Con
ference this evening. We wish pray
erfully that the Conference would deal
the Plug Ugly a mighty swat, and put
it on the shelf with the rest of the
relics.
Perhaps, away back in the dim
dawning of our undergraduate life,
when the Palo Alto tree was a sap
ling, the Plug Ugly had some values.
It may have helped to weld the scat
tered ideas of our predecessors into
realization that here at Stanford there
was a field for college traditions, and
enthusiasm, and a will to play hard.
Many rough beginnings develope into
sturdy community interest, and we
must always be tolerant of their
crudity.
With the passing years has come
need for a new brand of pep-producer,
and it can't be built of artificial strife
between men whose interests are mu
tual, even though the touted es
sence of "class spirit" is sprin
kled broadcast through siphon
bottles, or other effervescent means.
Class spirit and college spirit
have a different significance than they
had in the pioneer days. The early
days of experiment, and striving to
ward real campus customs is passed.
The Plug Ugly may be regulated
and pruned until it becomes as safe as
need be asked. Still it offers no ex
cuse as a vehicle for the expression
of junior and senior prowess. Shorn
of its spice, it remains only as an arti
ficial echo of other and older days.
Nothing is good because it is tradi
tional, if there is no other justification.
