# Nineteeners Bow to College of Pacific
## Opponents' Team Work Forces Freshman to Accept Short End of 36-0 Score 
### 
Stanford Freshman suffered a se
vere defeat, at the hands of the Pacific
"Timers" yesterday afternoon. Every
minute of play was fought by both
teams. Superior team work of the Pa

freshmen. No starring was done by
either team.
The freshmen were on the defensive
during the entire game and only once
forced the Pacific team to defend its
own line. The score at the end of the

was a repetition of the first, the final
score registering 3<i-0 in favor of the
Pacific players.
