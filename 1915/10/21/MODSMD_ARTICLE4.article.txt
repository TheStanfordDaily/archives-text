# Lowell Swimmers Will Offer Fast Competition In First Cardinal Meet
## 
### 
Interest in Stanford's newest sport,
swimming, will be given its first real
opportunity of expression at the var
sity and Lowell high school contest
in the local plunge Saturday morning.
At that time the men who have been
under Coach Brandsten's training
since the opening of the tank will have
their first chance to show their ability
against outside competition.
Lowell Is Bay Champ
For more than eight years, the
teams from Lowell high school have
defeated all other teams from schools
about the bay. Several times Lowell
has' attained the state championship
in this sport among the preparatory
schools.
Despite the unusual ability of the
high school swimmers, the Stanford
men will be able to give them a good
fight for the meet. In every event
except the 440 yard race, and perhaps
the 220 yard dash, the local team will
have dependable men. On the other
hand, Lowell's strongest points are in
the distance events.
Fourteen Men oil Squad
Although definite selection of the
ten men who will represent Stanford
lias been postponed by Coach Brand
sten, it is reasonably certain that the
squad will lie picked from the follow
ing swimmers: Orme, McGaffey, Pen
niman, Goldsmith, Brokenshire, Worth,
Pedley, Buckland, Wright, Lee, Iredell,
Flowers, Hess, and Noyes.
Probable entries in the 50-yard dash
will be Orme, McGaffey and Penniman.
The same three men will be seen in
the 100-yard event. Penniman is the
star in the century race, having made
it in one minute, five seconds.
Penniman, Goldsmith and Broken
shire are candidates for the 220-yard
j race, while Brokenshire, Goldsmith
and Worth arc out for the 440-yard
grind. Pedley has shown up surpris
ingly well in the breast-stroke 100-
yard dash during the past few days,
and will swim this event with Buck
j land. In the backstroke race, Buck
land is in a class by himself, with Tre
, dell and Pedley ranking next. "Gun
boat" Flowers is Stanford's chief hope
in the plunge for distance. His best
dive this year is 58 feet. Goldsmith
is second man in this event, with ITess
and Noyes also possibilities.
The four-man relay team will be
picked from the following six sprint
ers: Ornie, McGaffey, Penniman,
Buckland, Iredell and Pedley.
