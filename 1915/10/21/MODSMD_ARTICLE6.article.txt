# COMPETITION FOR QUAD EDITORSHIP IS ADVISED
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ACTS Freshman Ruggers Will Play Chico Normal School For Big Game 
### 
The recently proposed plan to put
the position of Quad editor on a com
petitive basis received the recommen
dation of the Executive Committee at
its meeting last evening. A commit
tee was appointed to confer with the
present editor, R. A. Griffin, '17. Some
system of tryouts must be arranged,
and Griffin's advice on the matter will
be sought, inasmuch as he was the
originator of the plan in a communica
tion to the Student Conference, and
will put it into effect if adopted.
Student Bod.v May Control Quad
Such a change, if made, will put the
Quad under the control of the Asso
ciated Students on the same foot
ing as other student publications. The
only difference will be in the manner
of elections, as only members of the
class will vote for the edidtor.
If a fair and suitable plan can be
made for the choosing of the manager
under the same system, the Executive
Committee will recommend the regu
lation of this office as well.
Whether or not the committee's rec
ommendation will be adopted rests
with the student body, as the matter
will be submitted to a general vote.
