# I FAVOR STANFORD'S POLICY IN ATHLETICS WITH COMPETITION FOR THE MANY--—DR. R.L. WILBUR
## 
### 
"Was my election a surprise? That
depends upon the definition of sur
prise," replied Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
when queried by a Daily Palo Alto
representative who invaded the new
Stanford President's home last night.
"No, it wasn't a shock. Nor a blow.
My trip Friday was but a coincidence."
At any rate Dr. Wilbur was not great
ly concerned regarding his election —
for he is a big man in every way,
physically, mentally, and personally,
which, by the way, puts him in the
class with his two predecessors.
Advocates Kugby
Dr. Wilbur went on record laat
night as an advocate of rugby foot
ball, not because it is the game most
fitted to the conditions and circum
stances desired at Stanford. He is
not opposed to American football, as
such. He deems it an unsatisfactory
means to the end which should be
sought in college athletics—competi
tion and enjoyment for the greatest
possible number.

"I am interested in competition for
all," Stanford's President-elect said,
"and not in one big event that comes
after a period in which evprvbody ex
cept the team chews gum. Every man
should be doing something, even if
only walking. Intercollegiate compe
tition is desirable but not necessary,
and should not cause needless sacri
fices.
"A little more leniency on the part
of the University of California would
have avoided the breach in relations.
To the man on the outside the condi
tion of things looks foolish. Compe
tition with California was carried on
without interruption for a long time.
It looks like bad management some
where.
Ts For Freshman Participation
"Why hasn't a freshman <ns much
right to play as a sophomore or a
junior? If the attitude is real sports
manship I see no reason for a fresh
man rule. Any man registered and
doing his work should be allowed to
play."
Tt was in this light that Dr. Wilbur
viewed the freshman rule as unneces
sary if the proper spirit prevailed. He
considers the first year man who is
obeying scholarship requirements as
an integral part of the university stu
dent body. The instances of men en
tering college merely for athletic
glory and then dropping, he numbered
as too few to cause such concern as
was exhibited of late.
"The position of student control in
the university depends entirely upon
the student leaders," Dr. Wilbur de
clared. "High character among stu
dent leaders is necessary in order to
have government of high character.
Poor leaders means poor administra
tion."
Dr. Wilbur returned to his work at
the Stanford Medical School in San
Francisco Tuesday after a three day
outing in the mountains of northern
California. He stated last night that
he expects to confer with President
Branner in a few days regarding the
new head for the medical work. No
selection has been made as yet. Ac
cording to Dr. Wilbur, John Maxon
Stillman will continue to serve as
vice-president of the university.

play."
Tt was in this light that Dr. Wilbur
viewed the freshman rule as unneces
sary if the proper spirit prevailed. He
considers the first year man who is
obeying scholarship requirements as
an integral part of the university stu
dent body. The instances of men en
tering college merely for athletic
glory and then dropping, he numbered
as too few to cause such concern as
was exhibited of late.
"The position of student control in
the university depends entirely upon
the student leaders," Dr. Wilbur de
clared. "High character among stu
dent leaders is necessary in order to
have government of high character.
Poor leaders means poor administra
tion."
Dr. Wilbur returned to his work at
the Stanford Medical School in San
Francisco Tuesday after a three day
outing in the mountains of northern
California. He stated last night that
he expects to confer with President
Branner in a few days regarding the
new head for the medical work. No
selection has been made as yet. Ac
cording to Dr. Wilbur, John Maxon
Stillman will continue to serve as
vice-president of the university.
"Was my election a surprise? That
depends upon the definition of sur
prise," replied Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
when queried by a Daily Palo Alto
representative who invaded the new
Stanford President's home last night.
"No, it wasn't a shock. Nor a blow.
My trip Friday was but a coincidence."
At any rate Dr. Wilbur was not great
ly concerned regarding his election —
for he is a big man in every way,
physically, mentally, and personally,
which, by the way, puts him in the
class with his two predecessors.
Advocates Kugby
Dr. Wilbur went on record laat
night as an advocate of rugby foot
ball, not because it is the game most
fitted to the conditions and circum
stances desired at Stanford. He is
not opposed to American football, as
such. He deems it an unsatisfactory
means to the end which should be
sought in college athletics—competi
tion and enjoyment for the greatest
possible number.
Favors Athletics For All
"I am interested in competition for
all," Stanford's President-elect said,
"and not in one big event that comes
after a period in which evprvbody ex
cept the team chews gum. Every man
should be doing something, even if
only walking. Intercollegiate compe
tition is desirable but not necessary,
and should not cause needless sacri
fices.
"A little more leniency on the part
of the University of California would
have avoided the breach in relations.
To the man on the outside the condi
tion of things looks foolish. Compe
tition with California was carried on
without interruption for a long time.
It looks like bad management some
where.
Ts For Freshman Participation
"Why hasn't a freshman <ns much
right to play as a sophomore or a
junior? If the attitude is real sports
manship I see no reason for a fresh
man rule. Any man registered and
doing his work should be allowed to
play."
