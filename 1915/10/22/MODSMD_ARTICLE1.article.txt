# HIGH JINKS GET AWAY AT EIGHT O'CLOCK SHARP
## NO SEATS WILL BE RESERVED Masquers Announce First Come First Served as Slogan. Doors Open 7:30 
### 
Masquers announce that there will
be no reserved seats for their vaude
ville jinks this evening. Tickets are
twenty-five cents each and will be
put on sale at two box offices in front
of the Assembly Hall at 7:30 o'clock.
"First come, first served," will be the
slogan and promptly at 8 o'clock Miss
Margery Bailey, one of the most tal
ented players in the history of Stan
ford dramatics, will open the pro
gram with her newest ideas in song,
verse and "devil's ditties." Anyone
who witnessed the productions of
"Seven Sisters," "Quality Street," or
"Pillars of Society," will appreciate
the announcement of Miss Bailey's
reappearance.
The dress rehearsal for "A Romance
in Black and White," which was held
Wednesday evening in the Assembly
Hall under the direction of J. R. Mor
gan. proved an unqualified success.
The cast has mastered the various
bits of stage "business" and panto
mime with professional understand
ing and W. I?. Curtis, '16, as the "Maker
of Sounds," enacts his unique role
with rare appreciation of comedy val
ues. Miss Nellita Choate handles the
most difficult part in the production
with charming grace and her gestures
are artistic in the extreme. Her in
terpolated dance is one of the most
delightful Hits of the pantomime. F.
K. Murray, who scored in "Seven Days"
last semester, is admirably suited as
the stalwart "Visier." Miss Dorothy
Egbert, who won much praise for her
portrayal of "A Good Woman" last
week, displays her versatility in a
totally different effort as the maid.
Miss Egbert, Miss Stella Connelly and
Miss Elizabeth Jndah suggest old
Egyptian figures as they glide through
the pantomime with kaleidoscopic
rapidity.
Famous Violinist Will Play
Miss Carrie Goebel Weston, a young
violinist of national fame whom Mas
quers have engaged especially for the
evening, will play some of her most
interesting selections accompanied by
Miss Marion Prevost, a talented pian
ist. Mies Weston's appearance prom
ises a decided musical treat.
J. R. Morgan, P. E. Leland and Miss
Ellen Galpin will close the program
with a "Prunella"-like phantasy, "The
Maker of Dreams," which will be
staged under the direction of Miss Gal
pin, who produced the playlet recently
in Los Angeles. This delightful
sketch radiates the joy of life, though
at times its brightness is dimmed by
the shadow of an unrequited yearning.
Miss Galpin's professional experience
promises an unusual production. She
spent one year abroad with F. R. Ben
son's players at Stratford-on-Avon and
has won eminent success as a pro
ducer of artistic plays. With the as
sistance of Morgan and Leland "The
Maker of Dreams" should be one of
the features of the program.
