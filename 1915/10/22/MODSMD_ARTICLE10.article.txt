# TRIPLE BILL ON RUGBY CALENDAR FOR TOMORROW
## VARSITY VS. DAVIDSON SQUAD Freshman-Woodland Game at Exposition---Titans to Meet All-Blacks 
### 
A trio of rugby tangles of high class
calibre have been cast by Manager
Behrens for the morrows' entertain
ment of the Stanford enthusiasts
which are scheduled to commence at
2:30 o'clock and not be completed
until the dinner hour.
Cy Davidson's Palo Alto Athletic
Club will make its second appearance
of the week, when it lines up against
the varsity. According to their versa
tile manager, the clubmen will exhibit
a considerably bolstered line-up, fea
turing new satellites in the football
world.
On the other hand, Coach Brown in
selecting the varsity was forced to
keep three regulars on the side-lines
in the persons of Erb, claiming two
cracked ribs; Urban, harboring a
Charley horse, and Pettingill, com
plaining of an injured ankle. The
pack presents the identical formation
used in last Saturday's bout with the
Olympic club, Smitherum, Soper, and
Knight are booked for front rank,
while liloser and Rehm follow at mid
dle rank. Halsted again locks the for
wards together, with Wylie and Bra
den completing as breakaways.
Freshman Davis has been named to
fill Erb's shoes at half. Walker and
Long will hold down the five-eighths
berths. Center as usual is filled by
Captain Carroll. Templeton and Swi
gart occupy the opposite wing posi
tions. Fullback calls for Dink Tem
pleton.
