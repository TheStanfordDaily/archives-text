# Everybody to Jolly-Up Queeners or Neutrals
## Music to Start at Fall of Masquers' Curtain at Encina and Gymnasium 
### 
Now conies a suffrage movement
among a militant section of Stanford's
five hundred with the announcement
that queening isn't the a la mode way
of getting to the jolly-ups tonight, in
spite of the fact that the old univer
sity tradition concerning the class
affairs has been waved for the time
being to enable Masquers to co-ope
rate with seniors, juniors, sophomores
and freshmen in making tonight a
merry occasion.
However, in spite of this equal suf
frage movement, Masquers will make
queening in soft shirts in order, and
everyone will get from the Assembly
Hall by hook or crook to the gym
nasium or Encina Club room either
as a neutral or on a co-operative
basis.
Seniors and juniors will assemble
at Encina at 9:30, and underclassmen
will fluctuate toward the gymnasium
at the same time. At the upperclass
Jolly-up practically all time will be
used for dancing. Stunts will be in
orderpart of the time at the sopho
more and freshman jolly-up in the
gymnasium, though robber dances in
termingled with straights, will be the
feature of the evening.
Owing to the limited time for both
jolly-ups everyone is requested by the
jolly-up committees to make record
time from the Assembly Hall or else
where to the scenes of get together,
as music will begin promptly after
the fall of the curtain on the last act
of the Masquers' jinks.
