The Men's Conference, in session
last evening, voted by a lame margin
to allow repetition of the Plug Ugly
next month, probably on November 5
and G. The permission was granted
in a manner confessedly halting, and
in suhserviance to ethereal apostro
phes to the sacred and hoary tradition
of the Plug Ugly. The discussion and
vote were caused by presentation of
a request for the privilege of cele
brating the interclass brawl. That
request, ostensibly from the senior
class, was given birth by the willy
nilly vote of a scant gathering of
seniors yesterday afternoon. In the
face of such stuttering arguments for
continuation of the rites, a genuine
expression of upperclass sentiment
commends itself.
* * * *
We have taken an attitude toward
the upperclass relic of ancient days
and misguided enthusiasm. It is one
of contempt ,and whole-souled con
demnation. For the consideration of
other Stanford people wiio may in
cline to a like inclination, we submit
a few gems of intellect which should
be a panacea for all the calamity
cries that will be showered upon you.
* * * *
Don't be fooled into thinking that
all that is traditional is sanctified,
and unassailable. Though the doc
trine of "historic institution" is de
livered to you in epic doses, and fond
ly wrapped in Cardinal bunting, don't
lose your nerve. .Many a relic of the
dark ages lingers on in the world,
that should have been killed off lons
ago.
* * * *
Stanford spirit will not go to the
dogs along with the Plug Ugly. Sure
ly, some of us believe that Stanford
spirit, and college enterprise are built
of better stuff than empty-headed con
flict, decked out in a vapid pretext of
class loyalty. Members of the senior
and junior classes have no excuse for
a free-for-all broil which lacks the
elements of fair contest, aims at noth
ing better than a momentary excite
ment of physical rage, and worst of

all, does those things in the name of
university intelligence.
* * * *
There is to our knowledge no other
institution of equal repute with that
of Stanford, which fosters a display
of illogical animus between members
of upperclasses. Similar rushes have
been removed over the face of the
United States as things unworthy,"
smattering too much of brute indul
gence. Grant the value of the under
class frays if you will, and we take
no vehement exception. Perhaps they
mould raw material into community
enthusiasm. But by the laws of pro
gression, we pass from the stage of
novices in the game of college life.
* * * *
Whatever use the Plug Ugly poster
fight and rush may have boasted in
the early beginning is become empty
pretense. There is little real zest for
the scrimmages. They are illogical
avenues to physical combat which has
no essence of sport,—they have no
objective goal. The impulse of real
competition is lacking, since the suc
cess of juniors in the Quad rush is as
recurrent as the days of the week.
The poster fight is open to criticism as
a thing unregulated, artificial, and
based 011 wrong notions of physical
assertion.
* * * Ns
The Plug Ugly has dwindled to a
pitiful shadow of college enthusiasm,
and its decline is the rightful fate of
a vicious custom. That it has maimed
and injured men is common knowl
edge. Someone says all the rough
stuff has been chopped out. That
isn't true, but if it is, why let the tame,
pale ghost linger after the vain-glori
ous brute has died?

The Plug Ugly has dwindled to a
pitiful shadow of college enthusiasm,
and its decline is the rightful fate of
a vicious custom. That it has maimed
and injured men is common knowl
edge. Someone says all the rough
stuff has been chopped out. That
isn't true, but if it is, why let the tame,
pale ghost linger after the vain-glori
ous brute has died?
The Men's Conference, in session
last evening, voted by a lame margin
to allow repetition of the Plug Ugly
next month, probably on November 5
and G. The permission was granted
in a manner confessedly halting, and
in suhserviance to ethereal apostro
phes to the sacred and hoary tradition
of the Plug Ugly. The discussion and
vote were caused by presentation of
a request for the privilege of cele
brating the interclass brawl. That
request, ostensibly from the senior
class, was given birth by the willy
nilly vote of a scant gathering of
seniors yesterday afternoon. In the
face of such stuttering arguments for
continuation of the rites, a genuine
expression of upperclass sentiment
commends itself.

We have taken an attitude toward
the upperclass relic of ancient days
and misguided enthusiasm. It is one
of contempt ,and whole-souled con
demnation. For the consideration of
other Stanford people wiio may in
cline to a like inclination, we submit
a few gems of intellect which should
be a panacea for all the calamity
cries that will be showered upon you.
* * * *
Don't be fooled into thinking that
all that is traditional is sanctified,
and unassailable. Though the doc
trine of "historic institution" is de
livered to you in epic doses, and fond
ly wrapped in Cardinal bunting, don't
lose your nerve. .Many a relic of the
dark ages lingers on in the world,
that should have been killed off lons
ago.

Stanford spirit will not go to the
dogs along with the Plug Ugly. Sure
ly, some of us believe that Stanford
spirit, and college enterprise are built
of better stuff than empty-headed con
flict, decked out in a vapid pretext of
class loyalty. Members of the senior
and junior classes have no excuse for
a free-for-all broil which lacks the
elements of fair contest, aims at noth
ing better than a momentary excite
ment of physical rage, and worst of

all, does those things in the name of
university intelligence.
* * * *
There is to our knowledge no other
institution of equal repute with that
of Stanford, which fosters a display
of illogical animus between members
of upperclasses. Similar rushes have
been removed over the face of the
United States as things unworthy,"
smattering too much of brute indul
gence. Grant the value of the under
class frays if you will, and we take
no vehement exception. Perhaps they
mould raw material into community
enthusiasm. But by the laws of pro
gression, we pass from the stage of
novices in the game of college life.
* * * *
Whatever use the Plug Ugly poster
fight and rush may have boasted in
the early beginning is become empty
pretense. There is little real zest for
the scrimmages. They are illogical
avenues to physical combat which has
no essence of sport,—they have no
objective goal. The impulse of real
competition is lacking, since the suc
cess of juniors in the Quad rush is as
recurrent as the days of the week.
