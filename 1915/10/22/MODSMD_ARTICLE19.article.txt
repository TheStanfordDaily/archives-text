# GLEE CLUB'S LA GAI PROGRAM IS UNIQUE
## Performance to be Given Oct. 29â€”Seat Sale Commences Next Tuesday 
### 
Innumerable features mark the La
Gai performance which the Glee Club
will present next Friday night as dis
tinct from any past dramatics on a.
Stanford stage. Aside from the very
nature of the"I Pagliacci," and"The
Gypsy," the cast stands outside of the
realms of those personnels which
have been seen in the Quad playhouse.
In La Tzigane, there will appear a
cast of twenty-seven experienced
dancers, nineteen of these being girls.
A full cast will offer in pantomime "I
Pagliacci," the grand opera with the
fascinating melodies, and tense plot
known to all music lovers. "I Pagli
acci," a story of Italia minstrels, por
trays a play within tLj play.
Mile. La Gai will have a special
J university orchestra of fourteen
j pieces, besides the giant victrola
which will be used for the operatic
numbers. Standing eight feet high,
| this great talking machine puts over
; a volume of sound equal to that of
j ten average sized Victrolas. An ordi
nary record is used, but the resulting
melody is hard to distinguish from a
genuine orchestra, or operatic selec
tion. This huge mechanism is at its
best in rendering piano accompani
ments, or solos. This machine played
to 15,000 people assembled in the
Court of the Universe at the exposi
tion, and was plainly heard in every
corner.
Negotiations are now under way to
secure realistic scenic effects as back
ground for the array of color the La
Gai costumes will present. It is hoped
that genuine trees and shrubbery may
be used.
Reserved seats for La Gai will be
put on sale at the Hookstore and at
Weingartner's drug store Tuesday
at the usual time of one o'clock.
Prices will lie fifty, seventy-five cents
and one dollar.
