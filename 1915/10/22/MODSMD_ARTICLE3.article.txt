# UPPER CLASSES VOTE ON PLUG UGLY WEDNESDAY
## CONFERENCE FAVORS RUSH BY A BARE MAJORITY 
### 
Retention or discard of the Plug Ugly poster fight and rush will be determined by the express
desire of members of the senior and junior classes. Polling stations for the use of each class will
be kept open on the Quad next Wednesday from 10:15 until 2:30. Student opinion has an oppor
tunity to crystalize its approval or condemnation of the time-honored conflicts which are engaging
the attention of all Stanford men who think. That the universal ballot is a sole means of establish
ing the merits of the two-night fight was the decision reached today by F. S. Murray, '16, and H.
11. Dievendorff, '17. the presidents of the senior and junior classes, respectively.

Honestly, and heartily, and with frank avowal, The Daily Palo Alto wants to see the Plug
Ugly mishap carted to the brink of a deep hole in the ground and dropped. The proposal of the
class presidents for an expression of student opinion, is a fair means of determining how close to
the hearts of Stanford men the pugnacious Relic lies. There is no other vehicle for an untrammeled
and complete expression of individual conviction than the one decided upon,â€”namely, a free and
fearless use of the printed ballot.
