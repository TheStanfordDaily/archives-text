# STRONG OPPOSITION IS REGISTERED
## 
### 
By a narrow margin of votes,
the Student Conference last even
in went on record as favoring the
Plug' Ugly rush between the senior
and junior classes. The decision
followed a heated discussion on
hoth sides of the question. Those
who spoke for and in defense of
the upperclass melee made up for
apparent lack of numbers and ar
guments by repeated assertion that
Stanford needs some such tonic to
keep the blood flowing in her veins,
and by emphasizing the fanciful
opprobrium wihch would follow
a showing of "yellow," with the
result that the seemingly minority
opinion prevailed. Those who
spoke against the Plug Ugly laid
stress on its evident evils, and the
trouble which it has caused during
the many years of its existence,
and its lame excuse as an expres
sion of upperclass prowess.
Senior Petition Granted
Following a report by F. S. Mur
ray, president of the snior class, to
the effect that the nineteen-sixteeners
were in favor of the rush, it was de
cided that the senior petition be
granted. This petition reads as fol
lows: "We respectfully request the
Conference that a Plug Ugly be held
this year in November, the rules of
which are to be decided by the junior
and senior classes, in accordance
with rnlings of the Conference."
Last year's rulings were to the
effect, that it be permissible to op
pose the placing of posters on the
campus by the juniors, but, once down,
they must stay; the posters must be
submitted to the Student Council; the
rush must be held in front of the li
brary and may be stopped at anv
time. Two years ago, the I'lng Ugly
show was forbidden and any attempt
by the classes to reinstall this will no
doubt be subjected to the strictest
censorship by the Conference.
As matters now stand, the junior
and senior classes have it in their
power, subject to the Conference rul
ings, to regulate the Plug Ugly rush.
Therefore, the nature of the fracas is
us yet undecided.
Medical Lunch Kooin
The Conference adopted u resolu
tion that a letter be written to Presi
dent Ilranner, asking him to have a
lunch room installed in the Medical
building. This will be for the benefit
of the Medical students, who find it
very inconvenient to go home for the
noon-day meal.
Strict Play Herniation
As a reminder concerning partici
pation in Stanford plays, notices were
sent to the various dramatic societies
warning them to be more careful in
the future that no one takes part in
more than one play a semester, no
matter how small the part, and that
those on probation be prohibited en
tirely from participation.
The minutes follow:
Regular meeting, October 21, 1915.
MSC to accept library committee re
port concerning queening and mutila
tion of books. Committee's work to
continue.
Final report of sophomore-fresh
man fight deferred for further inves

By a narrow margin of votes,
the Student Conference last even
in went on record as favoring the
Plug' Ugly rush between the senior
and junior classes. The decision
followed a heated discussion on
hoth sides of the question. Those
who spoke for and in defense of
the upperclass melee made up for
apparent lack of numbers and ar
guments by repeated assertion that
Stanford needs some such tonic to
keep the blood flowing in her veins,
and by emphasizing the fanciful
opprobrium wihch would follow
a showing of "yellow," with the
result that the seemingly minority
opinion prevailed. Those who
spoke against the Plug Ugly laid
stress on its evident evils, and the
trouble which it has caused during
the many years of its existence,
and its lame excuse as an expres
sion of upperclass prowess.
Senior Petition Granted
Following a report by F. S. Mur
ray, president of the snior class, to
the effect that the nineteen-sixteeners
were in favor of the rush, it was de
cided that the senior petition be
granted. This petition reads as fol
lows: "We respectfully request the
Conference that a Plug Ugly be held
this year in November, the rules of
which are to be decided by the junior
and senior classes, in accordance
with rnlings of the Conference."
Last year's rulings were to the
effect, that it be permissible to op
pose the placing of posters on the
campus by the juniors, but, once down,
they must stay; the posters must be
submitted to the Student Council; the
rush must be held in front of the li
brary and may be stopped at anv
time. Two years ago, the I'lng Ugly
show was forbidden and any attempt
by the classes to reinstall this will no
doubt be subjected to the strictest
censorship by the Conference.
As matters now stand, the junior
and senior classes have it in their
power, subject to the Conference rul
ings, to regulate the Plug Ugly rush.
Therefore, the nature of the fracas is
us yet undecided.
Medical Lunch Kooin
The Conference adopted u resolu
tion that a letter be written to Presi
dent Ilranner, asking him to have a
lunch room installed in the Medical
building. This will be for the benefit
of the Medical students, who find it
very inconvenient to go home for the
noon-day meal.
