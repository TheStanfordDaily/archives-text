For the first time in the history of
Stanford, the Cardinal will have an
officially recognized swimming team
in competition with an outside rival
tomorrow morning when the varsity
swimmers will meet the Lowell high
school men in the Stanford plunge.
The success of this meet will have
an important effect upon the future
status of swimming in the universitv.
Coach Hrandsten has done all in his
power to develop a good, all-around
team in a comparatively short period,
and judging by the time made in the
various trial races, his efforts have
not been in vain. The one important
question now before those interested
in furthering the sport is the interest
that will be shown by the students.
Holders of season tickets will be sub
mitted without further charge, while
admission to all others has been set
at twenty-five cents.
Lowell will bring a ten-man team
to compete with the ten men to be
chosen by Coach Brandsten. Among
the visitors will be a number of the
best high school swimmers in the
state. The high school boys have
been using the Olympic Club tank for
a number of years and have been
thoroughly coached by Sid Caville, in
structor of swimming for the athletic
club.
