### 
Three victories, two at home, and
one at the exposition, was the Stan
ford allotment of Saturday's rugby
spoils. Against the stubbornest com
petition encountered by the varsity
for a month or more the Stanford
first scored a 36 to IS' victory Satur
day afternoon over the Palo Alto Ath
letic Club. The varsity was weakened
by the absence of Art Erb and Joe
Urban and a number of regulars in
the second half, while the clubmen
had new strength in the form of Tho

Reeves.

The varsity opened the contest with
a twenty-yard passing rush by Car

forty-yard charge by Frank Reeves.
Kirksey for the Palo Altans crossed

pounced upon by Jimmie Thoburn for
the first score of the clubmen. Four

bling rush was the retaliation of the
varsity, stopped only by a scrum on
the Palo Alto five-yard line, from
which Halsted dove over. Temple
ton's conversion brought the score to
2<> to S at the end of the first half.

Templeton secured two more units.
The clubmen then forced the first
