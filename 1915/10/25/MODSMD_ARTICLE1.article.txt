### 
Three victories, two at home, and
one at the exposition, was the Stan
ford allotment of Saturday's rugby
spoils. Against the stubbornest com
petition encountered by the varsity
for a month or more the Stanford
first scored a 36 to IS' victory Satur
day afternoon over the Palo Alto Ath
letic Club. The varsity was weakened
by the absence of Art Erb and Joe
Urban and a number of regulars in
the second half, while the clubmen
had new strength in the form of Tho
burn, Stolz, Henry, Murray, and
Reeves.
Opposition Is Strong
The varsity opened the contest with
a twenty-yard passing rush by Car
roll and Swigart, resulting in a try
by the latter. Following this came a
forty-yard charge by Frank Reeves.
Kirksey for the Palo Altans crossed
the line but lost the ball, which was
pounced upon by Jimmie Thoburn for
the first score of the clubmen. Four
more tries in close succession fol
lowed for the varsity, Rraden, Soper,
Hloeser, and crossing the line, the lat
ter making two scores. "Dink" Tem
pleton added six points by three con
versions.
Toward the end of the half "Feg"
Murray dribbled the ball through the
varsity line, and Kirksey cinched an
other three points for the club by fall
ing over the Stanford line. A drib
bling rush was the retaliation of the
varsity, stopped only by a scrum on
the Palo Alto five-yard line, from
which Halsted dove over. Temple
ton's conversion brought the score to
2<> to S at the end of the first half.
Second Half Even
Following the Palo Alto kick-off,
Captain Carroll and Ric Templeton
carried out a clean passing rush that
brought the varsity score to 29 points.
A neat forty-yard boot by "Dink"
Templeton secured two more units.
The clubmen then forced the first
squad men over the fifty-yard line. A
fast passing rush by Stolz, Thoburn,
Kirksey, and Cashell permitted the
latter to register three points. Kirk-
sey converted.
Another converted try by the clul) /
pack shot the Palo Altan tally up to
the final 18 points. As a grand finale,
Carroll, Swigart, and Soper delivered
a fast twenty-yard rush, which gave
the varsity a standing of 34. Te;n
pleton ended hostilities, making the
final score 36 to 18.
In the All-Black-Titan game, Stan
ford took the better end of a 28 to
score. The second varsity rung ui»
a try early in the contest when Glad
stone crossed and West converted.
The lonely Titan score followed close
ly. In the last minute ol' the |
Hayes crossed the line after a one- i
yard fall.
The second varsity adapted itself to
i the second half moonlight session
I more easily than the Titans, and suc
! ceeded in finding the line in spite of
' semi-darkness for four tries. Three
j were converted by B.vt West. The
J final score stood 28 to 3.
The freshmen met Woodland half
way at the Marina turf of the expo
sition, and showed their appreciation
I of a five thousand grandstand crowd
II by taking a t> to 3 victory from the
! lust year's Northern California chain
i pions. The game was close through
out. Stevens made the only try of the
