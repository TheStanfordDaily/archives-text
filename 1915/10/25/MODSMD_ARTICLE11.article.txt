# More Noise!
## 
### 
The date of the game with Santa
Clara continues to bound toward the
front of the calendar with joyous hops.
Outbursts of zeal and confidence waft
themselves up to us, from the Mission
university. We read proud boasts of
the rival campus, painted on our
fences and sidewalks, and written in
the reports of games that are being
played 011 the neighboring turf.
Starting with last Saturday, the
buck is passed to the bleacher ath
letes, and we want to sing and yell
with all the known varieties of zip.
The new yells, and the songs meet
requirements. We got the hang of
them at the first practice. After this,
beginning Wednesday, we can put up
a bona fide exhibition of noise.
The elements of enthusiasm are
combining, and turning their spot
light 011 the event of November 13 at
Ewing Field. Some few thousands of
the alumni have been given the high
sign, and there will be a gay round of
class dinners, and a Stanford jubilee
in San Francisco the night before the
game.
The stage is set for a great big
party. Let loose with the vocal weap
ons, and we can cut some capers. The
yell leaders are all willing to help.
