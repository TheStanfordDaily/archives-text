Stanford University,
October 24th.
It seems to me that the sentiment
expressed in the issue of The Daily
Palo Alto of Friday, October 22d, is
erroneous in character to say the
least. This paper is owned and pub
lished by the Students of Stanford
University and should therefore ex
press the sentiments of these students
rather than that of the editor. The
University Conference is elected by,
and certainly is a representative body
of Stanford men, and at their last meet
ing they decided not only to allow a
Plug Ugly this year, but also to make
it as much of a success as possible.
In direct opposition to this Conference
ruling Hie Daily Palo Alto, owned and
published by the Students of Stan
ford University, printed many falla
cious paragraphs intended to mislead
the student body as to the action taken
by the Conference and also as to the
real character of the Plug Ugly. •
One of the first statements made in
these gems of intellect was that the
Conference went on record as favor
ing the Plug Ugly "by a narrow mar
gin of votes." This vote, to be exact,
was 18 to 9, showing that the Uni
versity Conference was in favor of
an upperclass rush by the majority of
two to one, not a very "lame" or "nar
row" margin! In the second •place,
look in any old Quad and see what a
part in university life the Plug Ugly
played—this "interclass brawl," "pug
nacious relic" and "vainglorious
brute," as the D. P. A. calls it, was
almost as much of a landmark in the
fall semester as the Big Game.
This is a question "engaging the at
tention of all Stanford men who
think," you say. I can't help but think
that many who are opposing the Plug
Ugly are doing so either because they
haven't enough pep to crawl out of
their white collars and get into a good
rough house, or else they're afraid
that maybe they might get ited up, or
mussed up, or otherwise slightly
soiled in this awful, horrible, blood
thirsty "free-for-all broil."
1 suggest that the rush be held after
the Big Game on November 18th and
19th, or 19th and 20th, or even the
first week in December, and let the
juniors all get their own Plugs and
really wear them for awhile as they
used to. With so much time, a clever
show could be worked up, good post
ers prepared, and those who recall
the Plug Ugly of the old days will
look forward to its renaissance.
So it is not only the privilege, but
the duty of all senior and junior men
with red blood in their veins to vote
in favor of the Plug Ugly on Wednes
day, and we'll show the knockers that
we can have a good, wholesome scrap
without any attending evils; and,
what is more, we can raise some pep
around here, which is needed more
than anything else.
F. S. MURRAY, '16.
