The Daily Palo Alto welcomes com
munications from members of the stu
(lent body. Above all things, we want
contributors to be confident of fair
treatment at the hands of the copy
reader. Consequently, we try hard
to refrain from damnatory comment
upon the viewpoint of others.
We print the above, in unsullied
entirety, a statement by F. S. Murray,
president of the senior class. Since
The Daily Palo Alto is enthusiastical
ly taking part in an attack on the
Plug Ugly tradition, which we believe
is pernicious, we crave indulgence for
piking from the letter of our agree
ment with contributors, in the inter
est of Truth.
Eighteen to nine is stated as the
sum of the Conference vote in favor
o!" the Plug Ugly at the meeting of
last Thursday. The statement is
grossly mistaken, and we hasten to
submit some verified figures of our
own. Of the 32 Conference members
present at the meeting, IS voted to re
tain the Plug Ugly, on the authority
of ('. M. Miller, Ml, president, anil (J.
C. Collins, '17, secretary. Of the re
maining 11 men, one did not vote, ac
cording to the belief of Miller and

others,, though 110 formal count was
taken.
After the meeting, that one man
stated that he did not understand the
question before the body, and conse
quently did not vote, but stated that
he was heartily opposed to the Plug
Ugly. We shall be tdad to give bis
name on request.
Two of the 18 men who voted for
the Plug Ugly, voted "reluctantly, and
under mistaken knowledge" of the
question at issue. They stated after
the meeting that they were wholly in
favor of abolishing the upperclass
rush. Both of tlieni have signed state
ments which appear on the front page
of this issue, and we shall furnish
their names on request.
Those who are apt at figures will
reach the undisputable conclusion that
the sentiment inside the Conference
at its last meeting, was 16 for, and 16
against the Plug Ugly. Which we re
gard as rather interesting support of
the promise that The Daily Palo Alto
lias not yet violated its obligations to
the student body. So help us, God.
If more than one of the members
present did not vote either way lie lias
escaped the notice of the president of
the Conference, and of others who
were rather interested in the vote.
And if there were more than one,
those members more probably inclined
toward abolition of the Plug Ugly than
in its behalf.

present at the meeting, IS voted to re
tain the Plug Ugly, on the authority
of ('. M. Miller, Ml, president, anil (J.
C. Collins, '17, secretary. Of the re
maining 11 men, one did not vote, ac
cording to the belief of Miller and

others,, though 110 formal count was
taken.
After the meeting, that one man
stated that he did not understand the
question before the body, and conse
quently did not vote, but stated that
he was heartily opposed to the Plug
Ugly. We shall be tdad to give bis
name on request.
Two of the 18 men who voted for
the Plug Ugly, voted "reluctantly, and
under mistaken knowledge" of the
question at issue. They stated after
the meeting that they were wholly in
favor of abolishing the upperclass
rush. Both of tlieni have signed state
ments which appear on the front page
of this issue, and we shall furnish
their names on request.
Those who are apt at figures will
reach the undisputable conclusion that
the sentiment inside the Conference
at its last meeting, was 16 for, and 16
against the Plug Ugly. Which we re
gard as rather interesting support of
the promise that The Daily Palo Alto
lias not yet violated its obligations to
the student body. So help us, God.
If more than one of the members
present did not vote either way lie lias
escaped the notice of the president of
the Conference, and of others who
were rather interested in the vote.
And if there were more than one,
those members more probably inclined
toward abolition of the Plug Ugly than
in its behalf.
