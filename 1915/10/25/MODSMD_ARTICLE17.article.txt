# Boxer Trouble Subject of Encina Talk
## 
### 
A realistic account of the part
played by the armies of the allied na
tions in suppressing the Boxer upris
ing in China was given last night by
Father Joseph M. Gleason in a talk
before the men of Encina.
Father Gleason was throughout the
war the only English speaking chap
lain. He explained the duties of army
chaplains, and gave a comprehensive
report of the taking of Pekin, the place
of the last great stand of the Chinese.
