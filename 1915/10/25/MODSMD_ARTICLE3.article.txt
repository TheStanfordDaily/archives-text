# THRONGS MEET EDISON
## Noted Inventor is Given Hearty Welcome by Students 
### 
Practically the entire Stanford stu
dent body turned out Saturday morn
ing to see Thomas A. Edison, who vis
ited the campus while on an auto
mobile tour of tlie Santa Clara valley.
Though the great inventor appeared
on the Assembly Hall stage, lie made
no speech, but smilingly saluted the
students in acknowledgement of their
rousing cheers.
Both President Branner and Mr.
Thomas Addison, general manager of
the Pacific Coast branch of the Gen
eral Electric Company, who was Edi
son's host for the day, spoke to the
students. Mr. Addison spoke of the
unlimited energy Mr. Edison had been
showing in his visit to the Exposition,
and stated that he had set a pace
which young men would have found
hard to maintain. Dr. Branner
brought to light an early experience
he had had as an employee of the
electrical wizard.
"Sky Rocket," Pleases Inventor
Following the speeches the students
gave a "skyrocket" yell for Mr. Edi
son, which he was able to hear despite
his partial deafness. Mr. Edison was
introduced to Dr. Branner by Profes
sor Ryan of the Electrical Engineer
ing department. As soon as formal
introductions were made Dr. Branner
pressed close to Mr. Edison and speak
ing loudly into the almost deaf inven
tor's ear, said: "I do not suppose, Mr.
Edison, that you remember me, but
over thirty years ago you sent me to
South America to look for a filament
for your carbon lamp."
As Dr. Branner made this state
ment, the great inventor's face lit up.
"Yes, yes, I remember. So you're the
Back of the successful accomplish
ment of the difficult survey lies the
story of adventures and experiences
of several Stanford men in the
but little known regions of South
America.
Decius originally entered the ser
vice of the Argentine government as
an assistant to .T. R. Pemberton, '09,
graduate in geology and a former Car
dinal athlete, who was at that time
engaged in making a study of the An
des mountains in Patagonia. The
work of the Stanford men in this sur
vey has since proved to have been cor
rect, but at the time of the submis
sion of the report, the Argentine ad
ministration had changed, and the
successors of Pemberton's employers
were opposed to further dealings with
the Americans. While stranded in
Buenos Ayres, Decius, because of his
excellent work in the Patagonia sur
vey. came to the attention of I)r. Mo
reno, who as director general of ter
ritories commissioned him to make a
detailed geological survey of the
southern portion of the Argentine
Republic.
With little more than good wishes
to his account, Decius undertook the
immense task. The country was in
accessible in the extreme, while cli
matic conditions hindered the work to
no small extent, but Decius completed
the survey of over 4,500 square miles
in six months. In "making good" in
this work, Decius improved the repu
tation of the entire delegation of
American geologists who had done
work for the Argentine government,
and permanently placed the standing
of Stanford men on a high footing
with the South American republic.
Dr. Bailey Willis of the Stanford
Geology department is especially well
pleased with the success of the survey
made by Decius.
"Decius had a task assigned to him
as difficult as any man could possibly
handle," said Dr. Willis, "and it is
very gratifying to the members of the
department to know that his work
was unusually successful."
