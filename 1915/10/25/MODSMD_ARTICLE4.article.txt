# Masquers Show Great Ability in Presenting Clever Variety Stunts
## 
### 
Masquers is to be congratulated.
Anyone should bo congratulated who
will put on a dollar attraction and
give it for a fourth of that price to
a community that doesn't know what
it wants in dramatics. Masquers
showed us Friday evening what we
really want.
"The Shepherd in the Distance"
found high favor with the audience
which filled the Assembly Hall looking
for a variety show. Miss Nellita Choate
triumphed in her graceful work as
the princess. The whole cast put a
professional finish into the panto
mime from the infinitesmal Wazir and
his humble giant to the agile goat,
his graceful master, and the villain
ous Gluri-Wurri. "The Maker of
Sounds added a most delightful ele
ment to black and white drama with
measured clicks and moans and booms
with which he accompanied the act
ors about the stage.
.Miss Margery Bailey's ballad sing
ing is pleasantly reminiscent of the
art of the Fuller sisters who visited
us last March. Her songs would seem
to belong in the setting of an early
Victorian parlor rather than before
the glare of footlights.
Another individual performance
which called forth tremendous enthu
siasm was the playing of .Miss Carrie
Goebel Weston, violinist. Though the
roughs didn't know where the applause
should come in, they knew what they
liked and dapped vigorously.
"The Maker of Dreams" was a
charming bit of work for which most
of the credit is due to Miss Ellen
Galpin. Miss Galpin, besides giving
the part of Pierrette all its value, was
the producer of this little play. ,T. R.
Morgan made the most or his waywarci
Pierrot, and P. L. Leland was kind
liness itself in the role of the genial
maker of dreams.
