# FATE OF UPPERCLASS RUSH HANGS IN BALANCE
## SENTIMENT IS "THUMBS DOWN" ON ANNUAL FRACAS FOR GROWN UPS 
### 
In the columns below we are giving space to estimates of the
Plug Ugly, written by a few who represent every phase of Stanford
community interest. Of course, we asked for them, and were glad
to get them. Why light another cigarette nonchalantly, blow a cloud
of smoke into the faces of the Opposition, and pretend that we are
printing the statements out of indulgence, as though we could do just
as well without them?
And moreover, to confess entirely, we approached a few people
who weren't willing to help us put a sleeping powder in the Plug
Ugly diet. The fact remains, that when the list of possible contribu
tors was made out. we hastily picked very few bad bets. And those
who had something to say, rest secure on the admission of the entire
campus, that they are real Stanford men, that they are men who
thin;j. who think independently of raucous jibes, and who are pre
eminently blessed with an ability to think straight.

H. 31. Levy, '!(»: The Plug Ugly has
lost all excuse for being. The idea of
the old days has been forgotten. It
doesn't represent a real get-together
spirit, and therefore ought to go by
the boards.
Wright I, >iiii, *17: I can't see the
object of the Plug Ugly fight. It has
lost its original object in my sight.
litiford Williams '|<>: The Plug
Ugly has resolved itself into a fight of
individuals. I am opposed to it if it
involves a show.
W. D. Fletcher, '12: As the Plug
Ugly lias been in the last seven years
it is a farce, and not a force in the
way that it is intended. It has de
generated from the old spirit it had
before 1906.
/. IJ. West, '17: The Plug Ugly Is
out of keeping with upperelass spirit.
It is now in the nature of an under
class affair, and ought to be abolished
as an upperelass traditional fight.
Professor F. Woodward: I hone
the Plug Ugly will not be revived. It
is beneath the dignity of upperclass
men, and I know of no other univer
sity where it would be tolerated. Se
rious injury is too likely to result.
J. F. Flden, '1(5: It is time that we
abolish an institution which has so
little place in Stanford, and substitute
some worthy tradition in its place.
A, F. Worthy, The Plug Ugly
is no good in its present form. It
ought to be knocked out.
0. If. Castle, 'II: Experience has
shown that it is impossible to regulate
the Plug Ugly, and I now believe that,
lor the good of Stanford, the rush
must go. The absence of it can never
lie positively objectionable to those
who like it, in the way that its pres
ence is to those forced to participate
against their will.
Professor ('. I). .Marx: The Plug
Ugly is one of the most childish things

in the university, and t hope the stu
dents will do away with it. We ex
pect foolish actions from freshmen
and sophomores, but not from upper
classmen.
McDermott, '17: The Plug
Ugly as it now exists is worthless, and
I believe that it cannot be revived.
('. IT. Miller, Ml: I believe in the
Plug Ugly when run right, but am
not for it as it now stands. If the
classes pass it by only a bare major
ity I would vote against it in Council.
W. (i. Paul, '1">: The Plug Ugly as
it now stands is a farce, and I am
against it in its present form. I be
lieve in it as it was in the beginning,
but think it would be impossible to re
vive it.
C. 11. Ornte, '1(>: I am absolutely
and unconditionally against the Plug
Ugly. It is utterly worthless in its
present form, and it would be impos
sible to bring back the old time spirit.
\V. L. Miller, *17: It's a dead insti
tution, and the best thing we can do
with it is to let it stay dead.
Dr. Frank Angell: I never could
see much good in our Plug Ugly. Too
many good men are injured by it. It
ought to be cut out.
W. F. \ooiisiii, '10: The Plug Ugly
hasn't any real meaning or influence
now. It ought to be abilished.
Dr. 11. I{. Stolz, '<>!>: The Plug Ugly
has always struck me as a very child
ish play for seniors. It is something
we've outgrown. As far back as I
can remember it has had very few
proponents, and has been kept now
not because it was wanted but be
cause it was a tradition. It ought to
be done away with.
11. \Y. Maloney: If the Plug Ugly
could be changed so that it would be
strictly under the supervision of the
Student Conference, T would be for it,
but I believe that that strict super
vision is necessary.

In the columns below we are giving space to estimates of the
Plug Ugly, written by a few who represent every phase of Stanford
community interest. Of course, we asked for them, and were glad
to get them. Why light another cigarette nonchalantly, blow a cloud
of smoke into the faces of the Opposition, and pretend that we are
printing the statements out of indulgence, as though we could do just
as well without them?
And moreover, to confess entirely, we approached a few people
who weren't willing to help us put a sleeping powder in the Plug
Ugly diet. The fact remains, that when the list of possible contribu
tors was made out. we hastily picked very few bad bets. And those
who had something to say, rest secure on the admission of the entire
campus, that they are real Stanford men, that they are men who
thin;j. who think independently of raucous jibes, and who are pre
eminently blessed with an ability to think straight.

\V. L. Miller, *17: It's a dead insti
tution, and the best thing we can do
with it is to let it stay dead.
Dr. Frank Angell: I never could
see much good in our Plug Ugly. Too
many good men are injured by it. It
ought to be cut out.
W. F. \ooiisiii, '10: The Plug Ugly
hasn't any real meaning or influence
now. It ought to be abilished.
Dr. 11. I{. Stolz, '<>!>: The Plug Ugly
has always struck me as a very child
ish play for seniors. It is something
we've outgrown. As far back as I
can remember it has had very few
proponents, and has been kept now
not because it was wanted but be
cause it was a tradition. It ought to
be done away with.
11. \Y. Maloney: If the Plug Ugly
could be changed so that it would be
strictly under the supervision of the
Student Conference, T would be for it,
but I believe that that strict super
vision is necessary.
