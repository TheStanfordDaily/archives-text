# GRADUATE WINS PRAISE
## L.C. Decius, '13, Explores Distant Land on Geology Survey 
### 
To L. C. Decius, '13, graduate in
geology, who returned to the campus
last week for the first time since he
obtained his degree, belongs the dis
tinction of being the first white man
to penetrate the interior of Tierra do)
Fuego, the extreme southern portion
of South America.
Accompanied by only a few native
Indians, Decius spent the greater part
of the two years since graduation in
making a survey of this heretofore
unexplored country for the govern
ment of the Argentine Republic. So
satisfactory was the work of the Stan
ford man that Dr. Ruiz Moreno, di
rector general of territories for Ar
gentina, has written to Secretary
Lane of the department of the Inte
rior officially commending Decius and
stating among other things that "the
United States has a right to be proud
of men of Decius' type."
man? Well! Well!" were Mr. Edi
son's words as he affectionately pat
ted Dr. Branner's back.
At no time during the inventor's
visit on the campus did he manifest
as much interest in anyone or any
thing as at the moment when Dr.
Branner recalled to him the days
when he was still working on one of
the first of his great history-making
inventions.
The stop at Stanford was the only
one made on the tour of the Penin
sula. It was through Professor Ryan
of the Electrical Engineering depart
ment, an old friend of the noted in
ventor, that the visit of Mr. Edison to
the campus was arranged.
