## L.C. Decius, '13, Explores Distant Land on Geology Survey 
### 
To L. C. Decius, '13, graduate in
geology, who returned to the campus
last week for the first time since he
obtained his degree, belongs the dis
tinction of being the first white man
to penetrate the interior of Tierra do)
Fuego, the extreme southern portion
of South America.
Accompanied by only a few native
Indians, Decius spent the greater part
of the two years since graduation in
making a survey of this heretofore
unexplored country for the govern
ment of the Argentine Republic. So
satisfactory was the work of the Stan
ford man that Dr. Ruiz Moreno, di
rector general of territories for Ar
gentina, has written to Secretary
Lane of the department of the Inte
rior officially commending Decius and
stating among other things that "the
United States has a right to be proud
of men of Decius' type."
