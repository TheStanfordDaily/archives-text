# TRADITION NO LONGER CALLS FOR RETENTION OF QUAD "ROUGH HOUSE"
## Junior-Senior Fight Today Does Not Resemble Traditional Struggle 
### 
A brief glance at the history of/Jie
Plug Ugly rush, its inception, devel
opment and ultimate decline, t'iking
into consideration the motives which
gave birth to such an institution,
brings borne a realization tKat what
is left of the relic of form?c days, is
not only useless, but liarir.ful .
There was a time years ago, when
the Plug Ugly had a purpose. The
welding together of the upperclasses
by a good natured rpirit of rivalry,
mixed with fun, wa? its chief mission
in the early life of Stanford.
The most important part of the Plug
Ugly when first begun, was the play
given by the juniors. At that time the
third year men were given the best
of attention in their efforts to charac
terize affairs of university life. Es
pecially were the unpleasant incidents
made to look ridiculous, laughed off,
and forgotten. It was not uncommon
for the juniors to make over a thou
sand dollars from the gate receipts
of the show.
Good natured plug smashing by the
seniors followed tbo play, as the crowd
made its way toward the Quad, where
it disbanded. There was no rush.
Gradually, however, the show grew
worse, becoming more of a bad-fiav
ored joke: The seniors would try to
break it up by hurling epithets and
vegetables at the players, and a gen
eral "rough house" ensued, later de
veloping into a rush on the post ofiice
steps. Injuries became so numerous
that the Quad rush was substituted.
Then followed the poster fight, with
its attendant abuses, prominent
among them, an all-night swig at the
forbidden canteen.
With the abolition of the show by
the Student Conference last year, the
Plug Ugly lost the last semblance of
its former self in the days when it
had a purpose, it has grown away
from the original idea, both in prin
ciple and form, and there is no longer
an excuse for its existence.
It is not only demoralizing to stu
dent activities, but it sets a poor ex
ample for the underclasses, and pre
sents untold opportunity for trouble
to student government, as experience,
the best criterion, has proved.
