Referring to the suggestion of A. J.
Hettinger, in an accompanying com
munication, that The Daily Palo Alto
has cornered the market for Plug
Ugly discussion, we have sundry re
marks to address to the campus pub
lic. By way of preface, attention is
called to an article in column four of
page one of this isSue, written by a
number of the most influential advo
cates of the Plug llgly.
* * * *
We present a fair remark, and ir
refutable argument as follows: As
planned by a senior committee last
week, and approved by a scant ma
jority vote in the Conference, the Plug
Ugly would have been installed with
out a vestigate of approval of the
members of the upperclasses.
# * * *
That a great number of seniors and
juniors are opposed to the Plug Ugly,
even the Opposition must grant. By
means of the campaign which The
Daily Palo Alto has entered, and by
no other means under the canopy, the
way has been paved for a democratic,
and independent expression of opin
ion. By encouraging a decision at the
polls, and joining in denunciation of
"railroad" methods, The Daily Palo
Alto has met its obligations to its
readers.
* * * *
Having put forth its best effort to
assure the campus that whatever dis
position is made of the Plug Ugly, will
be made by the students of the upper
classes, The Daily Palo Alto has used
positive, but above-board means of
cursing the rush. Outspoken declara
tions of partisanship have appeared in
every issue of the paper which has de
voted itself to opposition of the Plug
Ugly custom.
* $ * . *
In other words, The Daily Palo Alto
does not favor being a mirror for the
grimaces and disputes of student fac
tions. There is a bigger duty imposed,
which is to jump off the fence on the
side of right as The Daily Palo Alto
regards risht. Our columns are open
to contributors at all times, both pro
and con. But we look for general sup
port in asserting our right to the con
trol of editorial policy, both in the
editorial column and in the news treat
ment of an issue which rouses in us
decided convictions.
