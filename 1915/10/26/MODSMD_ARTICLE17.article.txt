Yesterday's Issue of The Dally Palo
Alto contained estimates of the Plug
Ugly "by a few who represent every
phase of Stanford community inter
est."
It is my misfortune to be one of an
other few whom the editorial staff
erroneously assumed to represent
some phase of "Stanford community
interests" until it found that it be
longed to the "opposition." Immedi
ately, then, these who sinned by think
ing differently from the editorial staff
forfeited their so-called representa
tive character, were placed among the
sinners, and characterized as • the
"very few bad bets."
Frankly, 1 never thought of being
a "representative" individual, until
yesterday morning when a news edi
tor of The Daily Palo Alto made the
accusation. As such he asked my
views on the Plug Ugly, for publica
tion, along with the others, in The
Daily Palo Alto.

I made the mistake of not thinking
like the editor, and immediately lost
any representative character, also
the privilege of going into print. The
opinion was worth little, and aside
from a possible regrettable violation
of the spirit of fair play The Daily
Palo Alto was probable a better sheet
without it.
I do want to raise two questions,
however, regardless of the merits of
the Plug Ugly.
First, is a square deal for The
Daily Palo Alto to solicit statements
for publication, then "light another
cigarette nonchalantly" and toss these
same statements away because the ed
itor picked a "bad bet," and didn't
get just what he wanted?
Second, does a man who at 10:30 a.
m. is thought to represent some
phase, however small, of Stanford
community life, necessarily lose this
character by the time the Daily Palo
Alto goes to press because his views
do not coincide with those of the
editor?
