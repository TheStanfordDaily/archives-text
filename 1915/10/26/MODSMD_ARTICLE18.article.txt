						Plug Ugly Sidelight

### 
May I be permitted in jour columns
to add a voice against that futile and
dangerous, not to add vicious spec
tacle, the Plug Ugly. My own expe
rience may he of interest to the level
headed student who is trying to get
all of the evidence on the question be
fore he casts his ballot in the matter.
In the rush of 1909 as a junior I went
forth to battle on the Law Steps for
the honor of 1911. To hear the blood
curdling speeches with which our ora
tors urged on the lax (or wiser) stu
dents to the fray, as they preached
the doctrine of class loyalty, was to
become fired with a false patriotism
which made the smashing in of all
senior's faces a sacred duty.
On the evening of the fray we went
into it to carry the fight, and many
were the old grudges settled, and new
enmities started as the upperclasses
—guardians of the dignity of the Stu
dent Body—mauled each other in un
seemly brawl on the Quad. During
the struggle the athletes in training,
who I have noted are ever the advo
cates of retaining the Plug Ugly,
urged us on from the side lines, and
supplied restoratives to the brothers
in the fray. When it was over I was

found on a table in front of the Inn
by a search party. For twenty-one
weeks I lay in the hospital, spending
a large portion of the family income
on specialists' consultation fees, aiul
for the next, twelve months was par
alyzed or worse in the mountains of
Southern California.
This experience is noted as typical,
although each Plug Ugly has pro
duced its quota of victims. It is
merely stated to show the danger
which is within this rush, and with
the hope that it will keep some of the
voters of the upper classes from vot
ing to resuscitate the moribund Plug
Ugly. I only make this statement in
an effort to discount the demagogues
of the student body who will preach
class loyalty, red blood, and tradi
tions —admirable sentiments in them
selves, but totally unrelated to Plug
Uglies.
This particular rush disrupts the
academic side of the university for
a week, brings the upper classes into
unseemly and undignified personal
combat, and opens the contestants to
the probability of injury, all for noth
ing. I trust that the Plug Ugly may
die. AN ALUMNUS, '11.
