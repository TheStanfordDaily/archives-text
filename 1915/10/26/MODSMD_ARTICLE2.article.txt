scrums with the Stanford freshmen on
the local green tomorrow at four
o'clock. The town hoys will be ac
companied by a threat and promise to
afford fans the sight of a rugby thril
ler and a high school victory. Recent
tradition appears to refute Palo Alto's
argument, inasmuch as the youngsters
have successfully lost three straight
games to their elders. The close
scores that were chalked up on the
miniature blackboard, however, have
not been forgotten, and they guaran
tee a fight with plenty of zip for to
morrow's contest.
Three defeats listed as 10 to 4, 11
to 3, and H to 6. have left Palo Alto
in a mood that may be labeled as
characteristically determined, and

equally resolved to make it four
straight.
By fathering a student body ticket,
or being the proud possessor of the
quarter part of a dollar, one may gain
bleacher space tomorrow.
