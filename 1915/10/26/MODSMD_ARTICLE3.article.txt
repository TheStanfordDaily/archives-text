# "HELLO GIRLS"
## Friendly California Graduate Would Have Democratic Greeting for Women Too 
### 
California may go Stanford one
better, by modifying and enlarging
upon one of our traditions of the
Quad.
A campaign at the transbay col
lege to inoculate the undemocratic
spirit of the campus with democ
racy in the form of the "hello"
habit, has taken a turn that may
include the women in the bargain.
Under the title, "Men are Shy,"
a communication in Thursday's
Daily Californian from Miss Ebba
Braese, '15, says in part:
"It would, to be sure, be a relief
to set aside formalities, to agree
one and all (man and woman alike)
to say 'Hello' to one's fellow as the
spirit moves him. I'm sure the
woman would be willing, if the man
would meet her half way. But it
would be hard on her, if the re
sponsibility of taking the initiative
in this matter should still rest
wholly upon her."
Funny one of our senior sisters
doesn't suggest the same thing—
probably our farmers wouldn't be
so slow as California's men in ac
cepting the suggestion.
