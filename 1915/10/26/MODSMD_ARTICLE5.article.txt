## Manager Hopes to Arrange Meet With High School Stars 
### 
Success on the part of the Stanford
swimming team in overwhelmingly de
feating the Lowell high school men
last Saturday has caused Manager A.
A. Goldsmith, 'Ifi, and Coach Ernest
Brandsten to open negotiations for a
contest between the Cardinal team and
an all-star aggregation of swimmers
from the San Francisco high schools.
Although the Lowell squad is by far
the best team among the city high
schools, many of the fastest individ
ual swimmers are members of other
trams.
It is believed that a team composed
of all the city high school stars would
give the Cardinals a hard fight. Coach
Brandsten has not yet had a real op
portunity to determine the full abil
ity of the men under his training and
is eager to run off some close meets.
