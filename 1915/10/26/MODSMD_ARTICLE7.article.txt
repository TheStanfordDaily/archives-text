# Senior Holds Belief That the Fight Has Already Died a Natural Death

.lust what reasons there are for the |
exhumation and wild endeavor to re- i
store that "sacred and time-honored |
tradition" known as the Plug Ugly, '
must certainly require a brain of great
power to perceive. The traditional
fight of the upper classes, long since
without purpose or justification, has
languished and died a natural death.
For the past few years it has managed
to survive simply on a false feeling
of honor, that the classes discontinu
ing it were quitters and that no class
wished to take the initiative. It must
be clear to every thinking person, that
it takes more than a false motive of
this kind to support such a tradition.
It requires a unity and an enthusi
astic spirit which can only come of
something with a more laudable aim
and purpose than the Plug.
Conditions Are (iiauged
As has been said frequently, the con
ditions under which the Plug Ugly
had its conception have long since
passed. Then it is clear that there
can be no real reason now for its ex
istence. A hollow custom and tradi
tion, fed only on a false enthusiasm,
we have only to look to the half
hearted semblance of a scrap that
takes place in froi.t of the library and
on the Quad to see what a useless lot
of folly it is.
If half the zeal were displayed at
the time of the fi.mlit that there is in
orating about what a wonderful thing
it is before the fight, there probably
would be a good fight. But as it is
there is a rough and tumble scuffle
| over the paved steps for a few mo
ments with the cut and dried result
that the defenders are swamped.
The juniors having won such a re
markable fight, such a tremendous
battle, can stick out their chests and
boast gloatingly over their grand suc
cess. As a matter of fact, every one
who goes through it comes back feel
ing completely disgusted with such
a rank farce —just how long would in
terest persist in the rush, in which
we rightfully pride ourselves in hav.-
j ing the best underclass fight in the
country, if it was undertaken in the
half-hearted manner characteristic of
the Plug Ugly? There is not a man
who goes into the rush who does not
have a spirit of enthusiasm and vim
so far superior to anyone of the little
handful of upperclassmen who gather
for a few minutes' orgy with flailing
arms and kicking feet. There is a
simple reason for this. It is found in
the fact that there is a purpose and a
motive for the rush. This affords the
enthusiasm and fire that it takes to
make it a success. We hope that it
will long continue the success that it
lias been in the past. It certainly
would not do so if fed 011 forced, un
natural incentive upon which the Plug
Ugly is obliged to subsist.
Tradition Is a Joke
There is a lot of chatter about tra
dition. Tradition is a good thing as
long as there is anything back of it.
Certainly there is somethng to most
of our Stanford traditions, for they
have a purpose. But the Plug Ugly
lias 110 excuse for being. Further
more, as a giver of "pep," which is 0110
great defense, it is a most distinct
failure.
At the present time there are many
, more channels through which super
fluous energy is allowed to escape
than at the time when the Plug was at
its prime. Football and other athlet
ics engage the attention and entire
energy of a great portion of the stu
dents. If a little of the supposed en
ergy of the Plug was directed toward
helping the teams much more would
be accomplished.
Plug Ugly 1h si Farce
It all simmers down to this—with
out the show, the Plug is a farce. To
bring back the show with all its at
tendant abuses, which cannot be
avoided from the inherent nature of
the thing, would be suicidal to student
government. Why ruin our chance to
make student government a success
by a useless, meaningless, childish
squabble among the upper classes,
which promotes only bitter feeling
and accomplishes absolutely nothing
and adds nothing worthy to life at
Stanford.
