# Senior Holds Belief That the Fight Has Already Died a Natural Death

.lust what reasons there are for the |
exhumation and wild endeavor to re- i
store that "sacred and time-honored |
tradition" known as the Plug Ugly, '
must certainly require a brain of great
power to perceive. The traditional
fight of the upper classes, long since
without purpose or justification, has
languished and died a natural death.
For the past few years it has managed
to survive simply on a false feeling
of honor, that the classes discontinu
ing it were quitters and that no class
wished to take the initiative. It must
be clear to every thinking person, that
it takes more than a false motive of
this kind to support such a tradition.
It requires a unity and an enthusi
astic spirit which can only come of
something with a more laudable aim
and purpose than the Plug.
Conditions Are (iiauged
As has been said frequently, the con
ditions under which the Plug Ugly
had its conception have long since
passed. Then it is clear that there
can be no real reason now for its ex
istence. A hollow custom and tradi
tion, fed only on a false enthusiasm,
we have only to look to the half
hearted semblance of a scrap that
takes place in froi.t of the library and
on the Quad to see what a useless lot
of folly it is.
If half the zeal were displayed at
the time of the fi.mlit that there is in
orating about what a wonderful thing
it is before the fight, there probably
would be a good fight. But as it is
there is a rough and tumble scuffle
