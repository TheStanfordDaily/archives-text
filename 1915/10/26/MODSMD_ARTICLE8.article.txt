# CIRCULAR LETTERS WARN LIBRARY DISTURBERS MEN'S CONFERENCE ADVISES LESS CONVERSATION
## 
### 
Queening, conferences, and tete-a
tetes of all kinds in the Library have
been tabooed by a committee appoint
ed at a Conference meeting held Oc
tober 8. The complaint has been
stated in the form of a circular letter,
drafted by A. H. Morosco, "Ifi, .T. M.
Tufts. '16, and C. M. Irwin, *16. A
copy of this letter has been sent all
campus organizations in the hope that
every student will be reached.
A few of the most important fea
tures of the letter are here quoted:
"A feeling has grown in our student
body that the library is an excellent
meeting place, a room which in real
ity is a conversation hall. A large
number of students need to be dis
abused of this idea â€”they should hold
a different opinion of the functions
of the library."
"It should be definitely understood
that it is a place for undisturbed read

ing and study and tliat. every person
in tlie reading room for that purpose
j has the right of freedom from annoy
ance by the conversation of his neigh
bors. Conversation or other distract
ing noises are offenses against the
rights of others."
"Another abuse of privileges is the
mutilation of books. Many of our
students do not hesitate to annotate
and otherwise mark library books
even more freely than they would
their own property. Some do not hes
itate to appropriate for their own pur
poses certain useful maps, disregard
ing the rights of suceeding genera
tion of students who will be depend
ent upon this same material."
"It is to the interest of all students
t that present conditions be improved,
not only for the resultant advantage
| to themselves, but also as a demon
stration of the effectiveness of student
control."
