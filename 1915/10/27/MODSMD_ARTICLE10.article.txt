(By OTIS H. CASTLE.)
The writing of this article floes not represent an overwhelming de
sire to burst into (lie Plug Ugly controversy. On the contrary, it is
written by request of The Daily Palo Alto. This explanation is offered
to make clear its point of view, the point of view of those who regard
the Plug Ugly with some affection, but believe that for the good of Stan
tord it must go. Did you never have the experience of finding that your
old hound was a confirmed chicken thief, and shedding a tear as you
went out in the back lot, shot him?
Mii rders Self-resjiect
The Plug Ugly of recent years includes three elements, the farce,
the rush, and poster night. Probably no college men want to retain
the farce. The difference between college men and Rah Rah Boys is
that the former are somewhat endowed with self-respect. The Plug
I gly tarce murders self-respect. "Right!" say those of you who have
ever stood on that platform for an hour uttering mirthless, inane and
putrid drivel.
Hopelessly (hie-sided
I he tact that a man is a junior who was once a sophomore is 110
powerful reason why he should not take part in a rush if he wants to.
But the present Plug Ugly rush is hopelessly one-sided, and so dan
gerous that it is criminal. Many of us would not object to a practi
cable and peppy substitute, but where is your substitute? For two or
three years various committees have earnestly labored to evolve onp;
and in vain. During further years of experimenting, hoping, and watcli
tul waiting lor a substitute, shall we continue to disgust spectators and
invoke ultimate death to some participant with our present annual
Grim Jest?
The promised 5,000 word screed of the Plug Ugly adherents is not
yet at hand; but we may expect they will favor the rush and farce be
cause they are traditions, because they promote "pep," and because they
are fun.
I radition" is the legerdemain of Stanford, the alchemy whereby
we transmute all that is base into pure gold. And none of 11s has the
slightest idea what a tradition is. In our class meetings a man moves
"to establish a tradition;" and forth from his forehead springs the tra
dition in shining mail. Let all who believe that our present Plug Ugly
rush and farce an hallowed traditions, let all who have a vote to cast
tomorrow, read the "History of the Plug Ugly" in The Daily Palo Alto
for February 20, 1 ,014. j
"Pep* a Tin God?
"Pei)!" It would be difficult to prove that the temporary "pep" of
the Plug Ugly, born of emotional excitement, is ever carried over into
any worth-while projects. At any rate, shall we commit all wrongs in
the name of "pep"? Shall we make of "pep" a tin god and at his altar
sacrifice the reputation of Stanford for common sense?
They speak of fun; and in fact for some of us the Plug Ugly does
afford a strange pleasure. But to an almost equal number it brings
pain and disgust. Then who should give way, those for whom the sac
rifice would mean mere absence of pleasure, or those for whom it would
mean the presence of an objectionable thing?
Cannot be Regulated
The poster nights certainly are fun. For many of us they will be
among our best college memories. They give "pep." They give friends.
They give the most royal sport that red-blooded man can know. But
there is another side. Two years ago poster night was a series of in
decencies that shook the very foundations of Student Control. President
Summerfield and Student Adviser Schaupp, speaking in Conference, said,
"Men, you must abolish the Plug Ugly now. Poster night can never be
regulated. It is incompatible with Student Control. Either the one
must go, or the other." And a lot of us shook our wise young heads,
and said it could lie regulated, and again and again when the issue was
up, voted to retain the Plug Ugly. Now we are a couple of years' more
experienced, and we realize that it cannot be regulated; that Schaupp
and Summerfield were right. Two years from now the present seniors
and juniors, if they vote to retain the Plug Ugly, will know that those
men were right. For sooner or later Student Control will split wide
open on the rock of the Plug Ugly; and that is as certain as summer
follows spring.

They speak of fun; and in fact for some of us the Plug Ugly does
afford a strange pleasure. But to an almost equal number it brings
pain and disgust. Then who should give way, those for whom the sac
rifice would mean mere absence of pleasure, or those for whom it would
mean the presence of an objectionable thing?
Cannot be Regulated
The poster nights certainly are fun. For many of us they will be
among our best college memories. They give "pep." They give friends.
They give the most royal sport that red-blooded man can know. But
there is another side. Two years ago poster night was a series of in
decencies that shook the very foundations of Student Control. President
Summerfield and Student Adviser Schaupp, speaking in Conference, said,
"Men, you must abolish the Plug Ugly now. Poster night can never be
regulated. It is incompatible with Student Control. Either the one
must go, or the other." And a lot of us shook our wise young heads,
and said it could lie regulated, and again and again when the issue was
up, voted to retain the Plug Ugly. Now we are a couple of years' more
experienced, and we realize that it cannot be regulated; that Schaupp
and Summerfield were right. Two years from now the present seniors
and juniors, if they vote to retain the Plug Ugly, will know that those
men were right. For sooner or later Student Control will split wide
open on the rock of the Plug Ugly; and that is as certain as summer
follows spring.

went out in the back lot, shot him?
Mii rders Self-resjiect
The Plug Ugly of recent years includes three elements, the farce,
the rush, and poster night. Probably no college men want to retain
the farce. The difference between college men and Rah Rah Boys is
that the former are somewhat endowed with self-respect. The Plug
I gly tarce murders self-respect. "Right!" say those of you who have
ever stood on that platform for an hour uttering mirthless, inane and
putrid drivel.
Hopelessly (hie-sided
I he tact that a man is a junior who was once a sophomore is 110
powerful reason why he should not take part in a rush if he wants to.
But the present Plug Ugly rush is hopelessly one-sided, and so dan
gerous that it is criminal. Many of us would not object to a practi
cable and peppy substitute, but where is your substitute? For two or
three years various committees have earnestly labored to evolve onp;
and in vain. During further years of experimenting, hoping, and watcli
tul waiting lor a substitute, shall we continue to disgust spectators and
invoke ultimate death to some participant with our present annual
Grim Jest?
The promised 5,000 word screed of the Plug Ugly adherents is not
yet at hand; but we may expect they will favor the rush and farce be
cause they are traditions, because they promote "pep," and because they
are fun.
I radition" is the legerdemain of Stanford, the alchemy whereby
we transmute all that is base into pure gold. And none of 11s has the

"to establish a tradition;" and forth from his forehead springs the tra
dition in shining mail. Let all who believe that our present Plug Ugly
