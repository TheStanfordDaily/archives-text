The writing of this article floes not represent an overwhelming de
sire to burst into (lie Plug Ugly controversy. On the contrary, it is
written by request of The Daily Palo Alto. This explanation is offered
to make clear its point of view, the point of view of those who regard
the Plug Ugly with some affection, but believe that for the good of Stan
