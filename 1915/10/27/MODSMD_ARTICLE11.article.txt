# Umm! How She Dances Mile. Le Gai Has Treat
## 
### 
Edison, or somebody very great,
said that this is the dancing age. Fact.,
there are lots of dancing ages nowa
days- anywhere from 11 to 411 and up.
But, you understand! This is indeed
the dancing age. Pantomime crackcd
a big hit over the heads of the Mas
quers' audience on Friday last. Pan
tomime has cracked a hit wherever
an audience has stopped-looked-and
listened. From what has percolated
from near and far to this typewriter
listens well to the effect that on Fri
day next, "T Pagliacci," in panto
mime. is going to land big in the hi;
hearts of a big audience with a thud
that will be taken for a seismograph
disturbance everywhere between May
field and Manila Hay—except in San
Francisco, of course.
"I Pagliacci" in pantomime is the
feature, the big league affair that Mile.
Le Gai. the dancer, will bring to the
Assembly Hall Friday evening.
Frankly, there will not be any
operatic singing by real humans—
isi'-;hs of gratitude)—but umm! how
she dances—and they all dance that
way! The captivating Pagliacci mel
odies will come from a specially con
structed victrola that is bigger than
a house, and that lets out. more noises
than a circus caliope and sounds like
Caruso celebrating a big event. It's
worth seeing and hearing alone.
In"I Pagliacci" Mile. Le Gai is to
be assisted by a number of noted
French and Russian dancers, while in
"La Tzigane," she will have the corps
of girls who have been under her
training. "I Pagliacci" was chosen
because of its intense action, swift
story of passion,- admirably adapted
for silent dramatic interpretation.
