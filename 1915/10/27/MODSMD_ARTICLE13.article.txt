# UPPERCLASSES DECIDE FATE OF PLUG UGLY TOMORROW
## SEPARATE POLLS TO BE KEPT Conference May Perpetuate Action If Against the Rush 
### 
Whether the Plug Ugly, in its pres
ent character, lives or ceases to live
depends on the action of the upper
classes in the election to be held to
morrow. Through the medium of the
secret ballot, a true and representa
tive opinion should be secured, which
will accurately reflect the sentiments
of seniors and juniors.
An adverse vote from either class
will be sufficient to abolish the Plug
Ugly, inasmuch as the polls will be
maintained separately. It is very
probable that if the upperclass vote
condemns the fracas in its present
form, the Conference will relegate it
to permanent death.
Let every junior and senior use his
right of franchise tomorrow. Whether
the vote be yea or nay, it should be
a large one, truly representative of
upperclass sentiment. Full instruc
tions as to time and manner of voting
are printed above.
