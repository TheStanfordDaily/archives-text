The speed and rushes of the first
year backfield was a source of pleas
ure to the bleachers, and in the main
may be held responsible for the heavy
toll of points.
First Half
Following O'Laine's kick-off, Palo
Alto rushed the play into freshman
territory by snappy passes, only to
see the first year ruggers bring the
1 all right back to the five-yard line,
wnere Davis encircled a ruck for the
initial try. Boulware failed at con
version. An avalanche of Stanford
scores followed. Hoth Meese and
Sa.vre managed to cross the visitors'
line when in close proximity to the
goal. Xo conversions resulted. A
thirty-yard run by Pelotize and pass to
Bonne.v awarded the latter the next
try. Conversion again failed. After
a beautiful backfield rush on the part,
of freshmen for forty yards, Davis se
cured from a ruck close to the line,
shot to Stephens, who fell over. Boul
ware missed a difficult goal. Just be
fore the completion Palo Alto made a
hard fight for points, but was thrown
lack. Score, 15-0.

Second Half.
Palo Alto started to make the play
hum right from the kick-off. A burst
of speedy passes kept the first year
goal continually harassed, until finally
Kirkse.v hurdled across. O'Lane missed
conversion. After ten minutes of
slam-bang football, Stanford evened up
the half's score when Davis registered
from a ruck close to the line. As
darkness already left the ruggers on
the field a hazy group of zig-zagging
players, the second period was called
a few minutes early. Final score was
20 to 3.
