# Bookstore Secrets Will Be Probed by Two Committees
## 
### 
Accountant L. S. Reading of the
Stanford Bookstore, is planning to
have a representative committee of 25
men inspect the accounts and stock
of the Bookstore to remove an erro
neous impression on the part of the
student body, that, the bookstore is
being conducted on the lines of a Wal
lingford corporation, and wishes to
get-rich-quick at the expense of the
students through the leverage of a
monopoly.
To prove this, Professor R. L. Green,
president of the Bookstore corpora
tion, Accountant L. S. Reading, Guy C.
Miller, ex-'O2, manager, and a number
of the directors will be at the store
Monday at 2 o'clock to meet this com
mittee and Wednesday at the same
hour to meet a committee composed of
women.
Mr. Reading also states that the di
rectors and the president serve with
out compensation and have no money
invested with the exception of a nomi
nal sum of one dollar, which is re
turnable upon demand.
All money, above that expended for
salaries, expenses and taxes, is re
turned to the students, who hold profit
sharing certificates.
