# Plug Ugly Is On Trial—- Not The Daily Palo Alto
## 
### 
The Daily Palo Alto throws its best effort into a final plea against
the Plug Ugly. The time and place for voting are known to all upper
classinen. We hope that a deep sense of obligation to themselves and to
the university will draw record numbers to the polling boxes.

A right to unrestricted use of the printed ballot is precious to us as
members of an enlightened community. Because no other method than
democratic election is a respectable or tolerable means of settling the
Plug Ugly's fate The Daily Palo Alto has opposed arbitrary retention of
the soiree.

Unnoted and uncontrolled by more than a tenth of the senior stu
dents, and unknown to any junior delegation, a Plug Ugly propaganda
was laid before the Conference last Thursday for approval. After trans
parent garments of courage, class loyalty, and tradition-worship had
been draped about the sick custom, the Conference gave a faltering
consent.

Since first attacking railroad tactics toward the upperclass rush,
The Daily Palo Alto has consistently preached a doctrine of enmity
against the unlovely legacy which we believe has become vicious, and
without excuse. We have used the privilege, and accepted the obliga
tion of declaring for the right, as we regard it, and as right is regarded
by other clear consciences and untrammeled minds.
********
Some there are who believe honestly in the Plug Ugly. Toward
them we pledge hearty respect, though not support. The red-fire de
nunciations of The Daily Palo Alto's "biased" attitude which have been
delivered, and which will be distributed tonight and tomorrow, proceed
from those few who would have foisted the Plug Ugly on the campus
whether or no.
♦ ill*****!!!
The attitude maintained by The Daily Palo Alto has been the only
one open to, or acceptable from a publication which is nothing, if not
endowed with an independent mind. We trust that diatribes levelled at
The Daily Palo Alto will cause 110 one to forget that after all, the
question to be decided tomorrow is retention or abolition of the Plug
Ugly. Nothing more.
