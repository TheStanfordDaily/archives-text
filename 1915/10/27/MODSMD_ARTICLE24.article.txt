I feel inclined to object to the as
sumption that the pep we need around
here, any spirit worth while to the
college, is going to be engendered by
an organized upperclass rush. Sounds
like foolishness to me, seniors and
juniors working up a spirit worth any
thing to themselves, their classes or
the university by one night or a couple
of nights of rough house in the col
lege year; or gaining anything at all
except a rough-and-tumble good time
for the exuberant huskies who really
get fun out of it. I would have no
objection to their getting that kind of
fun if they would refrain from making
it a matter of loyalty and honor for
other men to get into it or run the
risk of ostracism. We know that the
whole enterprise is fraught with dan
gers of all sorts, has proved thorough
ly undesirable in times past, and is
the kind of thing likely to degenerate
into a source of scandal at any time.
If the juniors want to celebrate their
entrance into man's estate why don't
they devise something new, a hat they
can really wear to indicate their
standing, for instance, instead of re
peating a freshman performance.

Editor The Daily Palo Alto:
For the benefit of any upperclass
men who are reluctant to upset a "tra
dition" by giving up the Plug Ugly
rush, let me say that I was in colleje
when the Plug Ugly was instituted,
and that there was no interclass fight
planned or intended as a part of it.
Incidentally, I believe, after the really
clever and spectacular performance of
the Plug riles was over, members of
the senior class assailed the juniors
and did their best to batter the hats.
This informal encounter followed the
performance each year, but. it was not
until sometime after 1903 that the or
ganized fight became a recognized
part of the Plug Ugly celebration.
(The Plug Ugly itself dates from
1898.) 1 may say, here, that it has
been a matter of regret to some old
timers that the opportunity of devel
oping an artistic and unique pageant
out of the Plug Ugly has been disre
garded while the cheap and easy scrap
is cherished and perpetuated.
A GRADUATE.
