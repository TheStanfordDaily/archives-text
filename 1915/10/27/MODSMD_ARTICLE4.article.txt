### 
The Vanity Fair bench show lias
just received three new entries, two in
the Scotch collie class and one in the
airdale. They are the property of
"Dad" Mercer, the best dog connois
seur in Santa Clara valley. "Dad" ap
praises the three at two thousand dol
lars, so Stanford dogdom is to have
real prize winners as all three have
won ribbons at recent shows.
One trained dog-fish, by name "Min
nie," recently capitvated by Miss Mar
garet Evans, '17, is to be in a class by
herself. Its trainer predicts a blue
ribbon without competition. "Medics"
have entered their best specimens in
the stuffed owl class.
Resides this concession, another top
notcher will be the Dansant where
every person will have a free dance
if he is lucky in bucking the roulette
wheel. There is to be a real orches
tra behind the palms, and best of all,
there will lie a dozen beauties to dance
with at the Union. Doors of the dan
sant will open at eight sharp.
Tickets are a nickel a dance or six
tor a quarter.
