# Shots Exchanged On Quad
## C. Smythe, ’18, B. Bates, ’18, Chief Characters in Gun Play 
### 
Clarence Smythe, '18, shot and prob
ably fatally injured B. Bates, '18, last
night, following a quarrel between the
two men. Twelve people witnessed
the shooting, which occurred on the
Quad.
It is claimed that the fight was the
result of a quarrel over a girl with
whom Bates is in love. Bates claimed
that Smythe was forcing his atten
tions on Miss Nellie Pratt, also '18,
and attacked Smythe, who was forced
to shoot in self defense.
When the shooting occurred, Smythe
was seized by witnesses. He admitted
his guilt today.
Hates was given first aid by Bobby
Burnit, '18 —which lets the rest of the
story out —it was a rehearsal of the
sophomore play in the Assembly Hall
last night. Other details of the shoot
ing will be given out on the evening
of November 5, when "Bobby Burnit"
holds sway in the Assembly Hall.
