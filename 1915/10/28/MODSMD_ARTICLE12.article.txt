# BIG GAME TICKETS DRAWN FOR MONDAY
## Applications Will be Accepted at Graduate Manager's Office One More Day 
### 
One more day only remains for ap
plicants to make out brown slips en
titling them to tickets in the rooters'
section at the Big Game November 13,
at Ewing field, and to part company
with checks or currency to the value
of one dollar per pasteboard to be re
reived.
According to Graduate Manager
Behrens, a number of women have
hesitated about signing up for tickets
because they objected to entering the
Union building. To overcome this sit
uation, Behrens has requested that
women make their applications
through the window on the northeast
corner of the Union building.
Drawing Monday
Drawing for Big Game tickets will
be Monday afternoon from the window
of the Graduate Manager's office. In
order that there will be no discrimi
nation, numbers will be put into a
hat, and all who have signed up and
paid for Big Game card boards will
draw from the derby. Tickets will
be given out following the drawing.
Tickets for Saturday's special of
two all-star games, the varsity versus
the southern all-stars, and the fresh
men versus the Chico Normal big
game, will be twenty-five-cents for
all holders 01 season tickets, and fifty
cents for others. New bleachers
stunts, new songs and yells, and an
A-number-one concert by the Band
will be the treat in store for fans to
Saturday's contests, in addition to
what will undoubtedly be the best con
tests of the year.
