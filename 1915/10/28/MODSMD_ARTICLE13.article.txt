# COTILLION LIMITED
## Committee Restricts Number to One Hundred and Fifty Couples 
### 
Tickets for the sophomore cotillion
will go on sale at the Bookstore Mon
day afternoon, according to Chairman
of the Cotillion Committee, H. P. Hau
ser. Not more than one hundred and
fifty tickets will be sold, and possi
bly the number will be limited to less
than that amount.
It is thought that the extra floor
space of the gymnasium will accom
modate more than the usual number
of dancers at the annual second year
affair, but members of the committee
are unwilling to increase the number
of tickets to be sold over that of last
year for fear of overcrowding the ball
room.
The class of '18 has encountered a
new cotillion problem in the form of
decorations to be put up. The gym
nasium is so much larger than Encina
Hall that entirely new plans must be
worked out to meet the new needs.
