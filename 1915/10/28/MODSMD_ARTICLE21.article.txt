Ever since the memory of most of
us knows not otherwise, campus peo
ple have esteemed the Stanford Hook
store along with the top-notch pro
ducts of John I), and George Randolph
Chester. The Bookstore is convinced
of two facts concerning nuhiin
ion. First, it has cloude ;>••« '
effective co-operative n . w ■ V
imputations of graft: s*
caused some residents ti lu t .
selves in the face by goi> ■ '
purchase.
Consequently we want to call at
tention to investigations of Bookstore
accounts, and all its business machin
ery, which will be made by committees
of representative men and women next
week. The men have been invited to
make an inspection Monday afternoon.
Wednesday afternoon a number of
women students will be given the free
dom of the store.
By its open sesame plan, the Book
store intends to prove that no indi
vidual other than payed employees re
ceives one penny of reward for ser
vices or investment. Furthermore, the
Bookstore hopes to convince the cam
pus that the store belongs to campus
people, that articles can be purchased
cheaper at the Bookstore than else
where, and that all profits are distrib
uted among members of the profit
sharing system.
