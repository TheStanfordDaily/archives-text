# BABIES PLAY BIG GAME
## First-Year Fifteen to Meet the Strong Chico Team 
### 
Stanford's freshmen will encounter
what will probably be their hardest
game of the year Saturday afternoon
w hen they meet the heavy fighting ma
chine of Chico Normal School in the
Big Game of the year for the Cardi
nal youngsters. The northern state
normal champions will arrive 011 the
campus Friday afternoon, and will
leave for a visit to the exposition im
mediately after the game.
That the Chico Normal players are
serving a winning brand of rugby is
evidenced by the 19 to 0 defeat which
they recently inflicted 011 Woodland
high school, last year's northern cham
pions. Last Saturday's freshman
game found the Woodland players in
no mean strength and the home
youngsters were forced to their ut
most 011 the Marina to put over the
two tries necessary for the 6 to 3 vic
tory which they secured. To date the
Chico players have made it a habit to
whitewash all opponents, and it is not
an impossibility that the freshman
may meet their second defeat at the
hands of the Butte county ruggers.
The Chico squad has an almost in
vincible forward pack of huskies av
eraging around one hundred and sev
enty pounds to the man. Judging from
the recent freshman exhibitions, the
baby backfield will do the most effec
tive scoring.
Following is the list of men who will
be in the Chico Normal aggregation:
Hartwell, Mello, Herman, front rank;
Meradith, F. Ferguson, middle rank;
Williams, Betty, Hail, rear rank;
Deveny, half; It. Ferguson (captain),
Leineger, five-eighths; Thomas, cen
ter; Boyd, Hill, wings; McNeely, full
back; Margason, Gribble, Miller, Ruth,
substitutes. C. A. Stebbens, coach.
