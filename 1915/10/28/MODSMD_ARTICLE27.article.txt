But variety now and then is relished
by the the best of women. Hence and
therefore the change. By pure luck 1
saw a woman's baseball game the
other day. Don't know whether or not
you've had that luck, but then you've
been to sewing meetings, so you'll get
my drift. I was greatly surprised by
the wing on one of the girls—but it's
safer not to mention any names. The
only dif. between feminine and real
baseball is the kind of ball they play
and the language they use. Now sup
pose you was on first, ma, and the
enemy runner turned the wrong way,
then turned up her nose the wrong
way when you called her for it. You'd
say something that would be dilated
by the censor and passed up by the
N. B. of C. But in this the same line
of talk ran like this: "Dearie, you
turned the wrong way." "Oh, did I
turn the wrong way? I don't think I
did." "You certainly did. Oh, May,
have you the rule book handy?" "Well
I couldn't run into the fence —I didn't
run the wrong way, anyhow." "Honey
pet, you know you did." "Gee, I'm
sorry, love. But I was running so
fast." "Well I'll forgive you this
time, dearie. But don't let it happen
again." "No, I promise." Imagine
nine innings of that, ma, then rest
your brain. Christmas is coming—
and now we're entering on our last
lap—fully chaperoned—for the pre
liminaries to the finals. Here's to our
profs—may the best man win. A mile
of love, your
SONNY.
