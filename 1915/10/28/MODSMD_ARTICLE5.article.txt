# Students Are to Audit Accounts of Bookstore
## Undergraduate Committees of Men and Women Chosen to Make Inspection 
### 
Twenty-five men have been picked
to serve on the committee which will
audit the accounts of the Stanford
Bookstore. Accountant L. S. Reading
has made this provision in order to
remove the erroneous impression that
through monopoly methods books are
being made to cost more to the stu
dent than they would if purchased
elsewhere.
Miss Nellita Choate, '17, has been
conferring with Manager Guy Miller,
ex-'O2, and, together, they are compil
ing a list of the names of representa
tive college women. This committee
will be asked to inspect the Book
store next Wednesday at two o'clock.
Mr. Reading states that in reality
the Stanford Bookstore soils its goods
to the students at a substantial reduc
tion. This is made possible by its
ability to pay cash and get a discount.
Besides this, the holders of the profit
sharing certificates receive a still fur
ther concession in the form of a rebate.
It is hoped that the committees will
see for themselves and prove to the
student body that by trading with the
Bookstore they will benefit themselves
because the larger the volume of busi
ness carried on by the store the greater
the discount they can get from the
wholesalers and the lower the price
for which they can supply the stu
dents with books.
