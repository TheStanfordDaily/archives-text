# LE 						GAI CALLED OFF
## Performance Cancelled Owing to Small Seat Sale 
### 
Mile. Le Gai, the dancer, and her
company will not appear in the As
sembly Hall as scheduled tomorrow
evening. A consultation with her
manager resulted in the above decision
after the returns of Palo Alto and
campus seat sales had been told him.
Enough pasteboards had not been dis
posed of, in his estimation, to justify
bringing Mile. Le (la* and her com
pany to Stanford.
Purchasers of tickets may have
money refunded by applying to the
office where accommodations were
bought.
