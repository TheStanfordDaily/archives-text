# EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE VOTES FOR BIG GAME SHOW
## CABARET IS TYPE SELECTED Frank L. Guerena is Again Chosen as Crew Coach for Stanford 
### 
Graduate Manager Behrens was in
structed by the Executive Committee
at its meeting last evening, to make
arrangements for a football cabaret
show to be staged after the Big Game
with Santa Clara. Although nothing
definite has been decided on as yet,
a proposal to hold this entertainment
at the Palace Motel mec with some
favor. The idea is to have a reason
ably priced dinner at the Palace to
draw the Stanford crowd together and
prevent the Cardinal supporters from
scattering throughout the city. As
there will be no play in San Fran
cisco suitable for a football crowd, on
the evening of November 13, this plan
will probably be favored over one
including a theater party.
Queening 1 in Order
Entertainment will no doubt be se
cured from the various vaudeville
houses if the plan carHes. It is in
tended that queening lie in order as
matters now stand. 1
