VANITY FAIR, she is coming to town
A 11( l she's bringing her box, her best bonnet and gown
of All-Hallows, she's chosen, they say,
| 11 which to bewitcli all your senses away—
To tempt you with trifles and style, and entrance
Y°u with hints about beauty, and gossip and dance.
F {, ir lasses and lads all, if yon would be fair
Altogether to play in sweet Vanity's train,
| t's pick up your pennies and once you are there
Revel all night at the VANITY FAIR.
