# FOOTBALL OFFERING ON SATURDAY APPROACHES BIG GAME CALIBER
## Varsity vs. All-Stars is a Headliner, with Final Contest for the Freshmen and All Black-Santa Clara Mix-Up Completing Attractive Schedule. 
### 
Saturday's football calendar ap
proaches as near to the Big Game cli
max both in quality and excitement
as could possibly be arranged without
the customary bonfire and rally. To
state that rugby of rare and enticing
nature will be handed out on a silver
platter to the bleacher warmers would
be no exaggeration. Three stellar ath
letic attractions, the most top-notch
exhibitions that the preliminary sea
son has to offer, will be condensed in
side of three hours.
Of the three headliners, the South
ern All-Stars versus the Stanford Var
sity, must l»e awarded the shade.
When the visiting luminaries with
their natty new suits of blue and white
stripes trot out onto the turf, a Big
Game spirit is sure to pervade.
Southerners Arrive
Twenty-six southerners with Mike
Narliah in charge arrived this morn
ing on the Lark at Palo Alto, where
they were met by a Skull and Snakes
delegation and taken out to the cam
pus in a large bus. During the morn
ing hours, Pat Miggins, who is acting
in his usual position of coach in com
pany with Narlian, gave the squad a
light work-out.
Visitors Formidable
Judging from the pantomime exhi
bition the visitors went through, there
can be no doubt but the team will be
of A-number-one caliber. The for
wards compose a heavy, rugged aggre
gation that looms dangerous. The
backfield in addition contains nothing
but fast rugby players of a high brand.
All-Star Line-up
This morning Pat Iliggins an
nounced the official Southern All-Star
line-up. The front rank is composed
of two University of Southern Cali
fornia ruggers, Toolin and Barton, and
Saunders, former preparatory player
of note. Middle rank is assigned to
Bill Eaton, '18, and Harris, another
University of Southern California star.
Mike Kiely, captain last year of the
Santa Clara fifteen, will lock the pack
together. Breakaway positions find
Deke Gard, skipper of the 1914 Cardi
nal team, and Walton, captain of the
Los Angeles Athletic Club aggrega
tion and also of the Southern All-
Stars, completing the scrum.
In the backfield, Blair, leader of
the Manual Arts fifteen last year, is
placed at half. Truck Manning, of the

University of Southern California, and
Red Wilson, a preparatory satellite,
are stationed at the two five-eighths.
Hush Meadows, erstwhile Santa Clara
and University of Southern California
athlete, is booked to hold down center
three-quarters. Haney and Blake, well
known speedsters, are to circle the
field at wing. Last defense falls to
Law, the famous Irish international.
Varsity in Condition
Since all the regulars on the var
sity are once more in prime condition
with the exception of Court Knight,
Coach Brown is able to select a for
midable team to oppose the invaders.
Smitherum, Soper and Sample coin
pose the hooking trio, while Bloeser
and Rehm hold up the middle rank.
The usual rear line, reading from left
to right, shows Wylie, Halsted, and
Braden on deck.
Art Erl) is back at half. Five-eighths
gives the fans an ohl combination tried
three weeks ago, of Urban and Long.
Captain Carroll holds down center,
with Swigart and Templeton at oppo
site wings. Dink Templeton again
fills the fullback position.
Freshmen liaise Curtain
The Freshman-Chico Normal en
gagement is scheduled as the curtain
raiser of the day's festivities. The
game promises to be of more than or
dinary interest for the reasons that
this is to be the final contest of the
first year season, and besides, the
Chico aggregation shows excep
tional strength. The northerners ar
rive on the campus after dinner to
night and will be distributed among
the various houses. In announcing
the freshman line-up, Coach Brown
makes only one change from the team
personnel used last Wednesday against
Palo Alto high school. Caughey, be
ing once more in condition, is placed
at one of three front rank positions.
Following tomorrow's contest, nu
merals will be awarded eighteen fresli
men players.
Santa Clara in Trim
The sun-down match, Santa Clara
second varsity versus the Stanford
second varsity, should equal any of
the day's entertainments as regards
genuine excitement. Those who wit
nessed the last struggle between these
two teams, which resulted in a 10 to 8
Cardinal win, are not likely to miss
the Mission-All-Black game tomorrow
afternoon. No surprise should be ex
pressed if Santa Clara ends with a
slight majority of points, as they are
hot after the laurels.
The initial game and last of the
freshman season will commence
promptly at two o'clock. The remain
ing two contests will be run off one
hour apart. Albert Watson, who ref
ereed last Wednesday, will officiate
in the Southern All-Stars game, while
Peter Flannigan is to blow the whistle
during the freshman argument. Von
Monderchied of Oakland will referee
the final contest.
Admission price has been fixed at
twenty-five cents for season ticket
holders and a half dollar for the gen
eral public.

third varsity in the morning.
