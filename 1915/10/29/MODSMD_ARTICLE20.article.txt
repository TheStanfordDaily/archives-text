# Santa Clara to Meet Olympics
## 
### 
The University of Santa Clara foot
hall team will play their hardest game
of the preliminary season when they
meet the ruggers of the Olympic Club
next Sunday on the Mission town turf.
Santa Clara has registered two wins
over the city team already this year,
I but Manager Burbank will have a hard
team to beat on Sunday with such men
; as Slater, Hayes, Austin, Hawks, Han
ley, Lachmond, Hest, Montgomery,
Muldoon, Quill, Guerin, and Flanagan
in the line-up.
Coach Ybarrando will choose the
men to play against the Winged "O's"
that he will probably send on the field
against Stanford. The players who
: have been on the injured list are all
I out now, and a real estimate of Santa
Clara's strength will be possible after
J Sunday's game.
