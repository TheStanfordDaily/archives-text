### 
"Vanity Fair" reveals all its beau
ties and mysteries tomorrow evening
when the doors of the Clubhouse and
the Union open at seven o'clock and
lets fun hold sway until the chimes
strike twelve. Miss Miriam Harrier,
'14, is the clever originator of the
plan, the gate receipts of which are
to help fill the co.i'ers of Cap and Gown
in order that the debt on the floor of
the Clubhouse may be paid.
Clever fashion models, depicting the
most extreme styles, are being exhib
ited by each sorority. All are vying
with each other in trying to reveal the
most stunning, artistic, and ravishing
creation. These dainty bits of femi
ninity will be on parade, and one will
see at a glance that Paris is no longer
the leader of fashion.
Not to be outdone by mere woman,
the latest masculine attire is to be
shown in the concession, "Better
Dressed Men." Feminine models will
show you how you should appear for
every occasion, so wait their assist
ance before selecting the material for
that new suit.
Stanford is to have the opportunity
of seeing some of the" riiiest dogs in
this part of the country when the
bench show opens Saturday evening.
The keenest competition is expected
in the Scotch Collie class, as all dogs
entered are champions, having won
ribbons in every ring in which they
have been shown. Every campus fa
vorite has been entered from "Dad"
Mercer's prize winners to the canine
owned by the Kappa Alpha Theta So
rority.
Have yon ever visited a French gar
den? One need no longer go to gay
Paree, for Mile. Frou Frou is to be
the charming hostess of this garden
fete. She is one of the cleverest of
comediennes, her name having ap
peared in electric lights before the
"Little Theatre" in New York. As an
entertainer Mile. Frou Frou has 110
equal.
All campus talent has been busy
turning out the cleverest sort of
"Vogue" posters to be in a department
by themselves. Be sure and get one
to adorn the walls of your boudoir.
They are being made especially for
Encina rooms, so don't miss the
chance to procure a work of art.
The "Hall of Fame" is to be the
best of all the concessions, as Cap
and Gown has more dope on the celeb
rities than all the Quad staff put to
gether. Flash lights are to be there
by the score, as 10:30 artists have been
busy for the last month at the cactus
gardens, the lake, and even the
"movies."
The Dansant in the Union should
rival all other concessions. A real
orchestra is to send forth harmony
from behind the palms, and there is
to be the exhibition dancing every half
hour. Twelve of the most attractive
women of the university are to bo
there to dance with you. though queen
ing is in order. A free dance is to go
to any one who can buck the roulette
wheel. Why not take a chance at a
nickel a dance or six for a quarter.
