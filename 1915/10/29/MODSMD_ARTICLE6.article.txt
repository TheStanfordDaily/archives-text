# NIGHT BATTLE IN PALO ALTO
## Thieves Driven From Postoffice By Local Police Force 
### 
Two buildings in Palo Alto, the
Standard Oil Company and the post
o'lice, wore entered and robbed earlv
this morning by a couple of daring
yeggmen, who, after a bloodless bat
tle in the post office with the police
officers, made a clear get-away. All
the drawers in each desk and behind
the stamp and registry windows were
jimmied open with a railroad spike,
but nothing of any value was taken
except a few dollars in change. All
stamps and mail matter was left un
disturbed.
The robbers were discovered by
Night Watchman Dan Hickey about 3
a. m„ at work inside the building
which had been entered by a small
window in the rear. Officer W.
Evans had just gone off duty as the
miniature battle commenced.
About eight shots were exchanged
and considerable damage was done to
doors and windows, but no one was
injured, although the surrounding,
peacefully-slumbering residents of
Palo Alto thought from the noise of
conflict that the European war had
broken out in their college town.
The robbers arc indefinitely do
scribed as medium sized men with
dark caps pulled down over their
faces. They escaped down the high
way toward San Jose and 'at present
are being pursued by the police. The
other robbery was not discovered until
this morning. Nothing of great value
has been reported missing.
This is the latest of several post
office robberies that have taken place
around the bay during the last few
weeks, and the postal authorities are
determined to put a stop to them.
