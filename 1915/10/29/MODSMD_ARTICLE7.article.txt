# Theta Delt Freshman Saves House Silver From Woman Thief
## 
### 
While answering the telephone, late
last night, at the Theta Delta Chi
house, Robert Sample Driver, '19, en
countered and, after a brief struggle,
overpowered a woman who jumped at
him from behind some portieres. She
had the silverware wrapped up in
a napkin on the dining room table.
She plead with him and, crying soft
ly, told him that she was a junior and
lived at Madrona Hall and that she
was a kleptomaniac. Begging for se
crecy, she walked out doors with him
and when the Acacia house was
reached she admitted that she was
not a student and that she had been
in Palo Alto but a few days. This con
vinced Driver that she was an adven
turess and he seized her and started
back to the Theta Delta Chi house to
summon the police. In a moment that
Driver was not looking, she drew a
bottle of chloroform from her dress
and attempted to commit suicide. The
attempt was frustrated by the pres
ence of mind and quickness of Driver
who dashed the poison bottle from her
lips before she had time to swallow
any of the contents.
At the Theta Delta Chi house a coun
cil was held and it was decided to re
lease her to avoid notoriety.
She started to walk to Palo Alto and
was picked up by a taxi driver who
took her to the Circle. There she dis
appeared and at a late hour this af
ternoon Chief of Police Noble has .been
unable to apprehend her.
Chief Noble stated to a representa
tive of The Daily Palo Alto that she
has been staying at the Hotel Larkin.
She left a suitcase filled with clothes
which the chief is holding in hopes
that he may get some clue as to her
whereabouts, either through the con
tents, or an attempt to recover it.
