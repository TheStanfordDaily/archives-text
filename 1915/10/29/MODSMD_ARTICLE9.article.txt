# SORORITIES TO CHANGE PRESENT RUSHING SYSTEM
## PAN-HELLENIC IN UPHEAVAL Committee Named to Consider Plans Submitted by All Houses 
### 
Due to dissatisfaction among the
sorority women of Stanford with the
system of rushing which has been used
for the last few years, and to its evi
dent impracticability, some radical
change is thought advisable by the
Pan-Hellenic Association. With this
idea in view, each sorority was re
quested to think of some new plan to
improve the present system, and these
suggestions were presented at a meet
ing of the Pan-Hellenic Association
last Monday.
Although the details of the plans
suggested have not been given out for
publication, the general trend favors
either waiting until the Wednesday
before Thanksgiving to begin rushing,
or pledging on matriculation day. The
idea of second semester or sophomore
pledging was rejected by the houses,
but it was decided to include some
scholarship requirement.
In order to facilitate the acceptance
of some plan, the sorority representa
tives agreed to enlist the aid of a com
mittee to consist of President Uran
ner, two professors, two sorority
alumnae, one faculty woman and one
woman outside of university circles.
Those chosen are Professor F. C.
Woodward, Reverend D. Charles Gard
ner, Mrs. P. .1. Treat, iMiss Elizabeth
L. Buckingham, Mrs. H. J. Ryan and
Mrs. John P. Merrill, of Atherton.
This committee is authorized to
evolve a general plan which the Pan-
Hellenic Association has bound itself
to accept for one year, reserving,
however, the right to make sugges
tions. If any suggestions are made,
they will be incorporated into the plan
which will then go on trial during the
rushing season next fall.
