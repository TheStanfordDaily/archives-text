Stanford Seconds, —Santa Clara
Seconds, 0.
Stanford varsity had no trouble Sat
urday afternoon in demonstrating its
superior organization over that of the
Southern California All-Stars, though
the latter gave the Cardinal firsts the
stiiTest fightkig competition they have
encountered on the Farm this year.
The principal weakness of the visit
ors was in the backfleld, shattered by
loss of two good men and by lack of
team practice of the men behind the
scrum.
Forwnrds Battle
' Stanford scored first when Sample
fell over the line lor which "Dink"
Tenipleton converted. Within less
than two minutes after this score
(lard of the southern pack pushed over
the varsity line following a five yard
scrum. Law's convert tied the score
and fans stood up in anticipation of
a lively tussel for victory by either
side.
For a time the forwards battled back
and forth over the fifty yard line.
After a punting contest and a drib
bling rush, Joe Urban and Danny Car
roll succeeded in cinching the second
Cardinal score, which was converted.
The forwards were responsible for
the next two tries by the varsity, both
of which were made by Rill Dloeser.
Joe llraden crossed the All-Star line
once more but lost the ball to Fish
burn. The score at the end of the
half stood 16 to 5 for the Caridnals.
Varsity on Defense
In the second half conditions
changed materially. The varsity was
forced to the defense, and was allowed
but one score by the sontherners. To
ward the middle of the half. Urban,
Carroll, and Ric Templeton staged a
thirty-yard charge which, with "Dink"
Templeton's boot, was good for the
only five points made during the half
by either team. The final score stood
21 to 5.
Freshman Game Stubborn
The freshman-Chico game was fea
tured by some of the most stubborn
playing that has been witnessed this
season. The freshmen demonstrated
their superior knowledge of the rugby
game in general, but met defeat
through the workings of the wonder
ful Cliico scrum, a pack who have
played together for five years and who
move with the regularity of a clock.
They allowed the freshmen to get the
ball from the scrum but three times
during the game. Chico's kick-off
started the ball zig-zagging up and
down the field until a dribbling rush
by the freshmen ended in Zane's seiz
ing the hall and passing to Flugel,
who scored. Hail for Chico made the
first score, which went unconverted.
Once more the northerners forced the
freshmen back to the five yard de
fense, and Hail crossed the line for
1 a try which was converted by Captain
Ferguson. The end of the half found
i tallies 8 to 3 with odds against the
babes.
Tn the second half the first year
back field made gain after gain on the
Normal players, only to lose ground
by the effective boots to touch by the
Chico back field. Early in the the half
i Flugel secured a cross kick by Wil
cox, and passed to Morris, who crossed
the line for the only score of the half.
For a time another score seemed in
sight for the freshman, but the half
ended with no additional points for
either side. The final score stood
8 to 6.
R. F. Pelouze of Eagle Point, Ore
gon, was chosen captain of the fresh
men just before the game with Chico
Normal. Pelouze plays in the back
field, and has been seen with the var
sity several times this year. He is a
member of Sigma Nu fraternity.
Blacks Win Over Mission
The last game of the day between
Santa Clara seconds and the Stanford
All-Rlacks was full of thrills while it
lasted. The game was called after
one half owing to darkness. Wallace
for Stanford made the only score of
the contest by falling over the line
after a twenty-yard run.
