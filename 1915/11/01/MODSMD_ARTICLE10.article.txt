# ALL-STAR COACH SAYS RUGBY IS FAR FROM DEAD IN SOUTH
## PAT HIGGINS ENTHUSIASTIC High School Students Play the Open Game In Spite of Hostile Faculty

"Rugby hasn't died and isn't going
to die in Southern California," says
I'at Higgins, erstwhile Australian
player, U. S. C. coach, Occidental
coach, and booster in general for
rugby. The American game has been
put into high schools by principals,
who were influenced by California, and
by newspaper sporting editors of Los
Angeles, all of whom favor the Amer
ican game and refuse to give rugby
space in their columns.
"When the trip of the Southern All-
Stars is over, we arc not going to quit
playing. The men on our squad are
playing for the love of the game. They
will continue to play weekly probably
for the entire year. We are just get
ting started with our schedule now.
When we get back we have a series of
games scheduled with Manual Arts
and Polytechnic, two of the largest
high schools in Los Angeles.
"Roth of these schools were forced
to play American because their princi
pals preferred it. However, in the
interclass games at both schools, in
which the players themselves deter
mine the style of game, rugby is in
variably the form of football chosen.
This proves that rugby can't die out
just because its opponents have put
over rulings forbidding it as an inter
scholastic game."
The view r s of Higgins were strongly
substantiated by A. L. Walton, captain
of the Los Angeles Athletic Club team
last year, and present skipper of the
Southern All-Stars.
"The number of serious accidents
in the American game is astonishing
people," shid Walton yesterday. "If
this continues it is not at all improb
able that rugby will again be taken up
in schools of the south. Our team
here is made up largely of business
men, who come out because they en
joy the gahie, and can play it with
reasonable assurance that they will
be able to go to work on the follow
ing day.
"I think there is a chance that U.
S. C. may change back to rugby again,
if favorable terms could be made for
a game with Stanford. Stanford al
ways has been more popular than
California in the south. American
