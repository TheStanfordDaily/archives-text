# Freshman Bonfire
## 
### 
The Big Game with Santa Clara is
the item of immediate importance on
our calendar. Bleacher prowess and
enthusiasm must receive their final
boost on Thursday night, November 11,
when the bonfire serpentine will add
its fiery stimulus to the spirit of tbe
rally for the team.
One big part of the pep factory must
be built by the freshmen, â€”namely, the
wood pile. To the freshmen as pur
veyors of fuel, we address a word of
encouragement. We urge upon them
a display of energy, cooperation and
well organzied work.
Construction of the rally pyre will
be started next Thursday morning.
All men of the 1919 class must be
ready to lend their hands to the task.
With a full week in which to throw
the beams and boxes in place, the job
can be completed.
By leaving commencement of actual
building until the one week limit, the
necessity for rapid, and carefully or
dered labor is increased. The out
standing advantage is that the stress
of the work and guarding is condensed
into a brief period, with ensuing ad
vantage to scholarship and safety of
the job.
We want to see all freshmen at
work. Detailed assignments will be
announced tomorrow.
