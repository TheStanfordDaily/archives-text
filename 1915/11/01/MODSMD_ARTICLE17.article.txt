# MOTORISTS WARNED
## 
### 
November 1, 1915.
To All Automobile and Motorcycle
Drivers:
Innumerable complaints of unneces
sarily fast driving and of the open
muffler nuisance on the Campus and
especially about the Quadrangle have
been made to the office of the Univer
sity President. Classes are being dis
turbed every few minutes by tbe pass
ing machines, which are driven with
exhaust open and often at a high rate
of speed. Not only by day is instruc
tion in classroom interrupted, but by
night the residents of the Campus are
disturbed by the thoughtlessness of
the would-be speedsters.
Your earnest co-operation in abat
ing this evil is asked. Every motor
driver using the Campus should be in
terested in this effort to improve pres
ent conditions without the imposition
of annoying regulations and restric
tions. However, if such parties will
not accept a responsibility which is
personal, the problem will be turned
over to the estate authorities.
Will you help in this campaign for
sane driving?
S .S. SIMONSON,
Student Adviser.
