# High School Rugby Progresses
## 
### 
Rugby in the nearby high schools is
going better than ever this season.
The league championship has narrowed
down to four teams. Palo Alto meets
San Jose next Saturday at San Jose
to decide which team will play the
winner of the Herkeley-Alameda game
to be played on the same date. The
winner of this final game will play
Woodland for the northern title, which
means the state championship this
season, as rugby is not being played
in the south.

Steps toward the abolition of the
underclass rush have been taken
among the upperclassmen of the Uni
versity of Illinois.
