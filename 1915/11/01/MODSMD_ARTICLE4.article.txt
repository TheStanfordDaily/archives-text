# STUDENT COMMITTEE WAITS ON BOOKSTORE
## Management Demonstrates That Dividends Depend on Volume of Business 
### 
A complete explanation of the pur
poses and methods of the Stanford
Bookstore was given to the student
committee chosen to inspect the insti
tution, this afternoon.
Professor R. D. Green, who has been
president of the bookstore for nine
teen years, went into a detailed ac
count of its evolution from a coopera
tive association of students, buying
and selling the books without faculty
supervision, to the present well estab
lished business. During the first
years of the life of Stanford, the mana
ger was a student, who could give lit
tie time to the business, with the
result that it soon became incompe
tent to meet, the needs of its patrons
and fell into disrepute in the business
world. The result was the present
organization run by the faculty, not
for profit, but for the benefit of the
students.
This organization did a business of
approximately $45,000 during the fiscal
year of 1914-15, and incurred expenses
amounting to about $9,000, or of
the gross sales. Thus a 20 r /r profit
must be made to break even, and this
could not be done if the sales were
less than $45,000. However, Account
ant L. S. Reading estimates that with
out any increase in the fixed expenses,
a business of $05.000 could be done,
and for every dollar over $45,000 there
would be 20 cents clear to go to the
students under the profit sharing sys
tem. If all the students were pur
chasing bare necessities from the
Bookstore, the sales would amount to
about $125,000 per year, but $80,000
of this is going into other channels.
The refund on this amount at 20 r U
would be $10,000, or a discount, of
about 14'£ over the whole amount of
purchases, allowing for slight increase
in expenses. Thus the amount of the
dividend rests entirely with the
students.
On Wednesday afternoon a commit
tee of women will visit the Bookstore
for the same purpose of inspection,
after which Accountant Reading will
issue a detailed report of the Book
store business.
