### 
Two hundred rooters howled around
the S. A. E. house Friday evening un
der the leadership of Yell Leader
Johnny Goodman. Practically all the
men along the Row and at Encina
turned out to participate in the dem
onstration of the football spirit. Jim
my the well known rugby
expert and critic, spoke on the Stan
ford spirit as it exists in the school
at the present time. In a brief but
convincing talk he outlined our policy
in the rugby situation in regard to
California, and urged that the Stan
ford students get behind the Big (lame
as such a stand is necessary in order
to exist in athletic activities. Advis

ory Coach George Presley also spoke
on the break between California and
Stanford and pointed out that this
year of all years is the crucial one
for Stanford. "Forget that a Cali
fornia-Stanford game ever existed," he
said, "and get behind the team and
consider that we have just as redoubt
able a rival in Santa Clara Univer
sity."
Captain Danny Carroll was the last
speaker to address the cheering
crowd. He also emphasized the fact
that this year was a precarious one
for Stanford and showed that the team
needed the combined support of all
the student body in order to accom
plish a victory in the Big Game.
