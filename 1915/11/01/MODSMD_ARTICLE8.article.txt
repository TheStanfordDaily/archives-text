### 
Intersectional club championship of
California in rugby will be decided to
morrow afternoon on the Marina at
the exi>osition when the Southern All
Star team meets the Northern All-

ceptional interest, as the northerners
have a strong team, while the show
ing of the Los Angeles players Satur
day afternoon against the Stanford
varsity convinced fans that the south
erners were rugby artists of ability.
The All-Star Northern team will be
made up entirely of players from the
Olympic, Barbarian, Titan, and Palo
Alto athletic clubs.
The probable line-up of this squad
is: Slater (O), Moessner (lt>. Quill
fO), Millikin (O), O'l-.aine (P. A).,
Frates (B), Partridge (Ot, Querin (O).
Cashel IP. A.), Tlioburn (P. A.), for
