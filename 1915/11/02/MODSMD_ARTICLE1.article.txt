# RIVAL RUGBY CAMPS READY FOR FINAL TOUCHES
## EXPERIMENTAL STAGE PASSED Cardinal Squad Numbers Fifty. Santa Clara Will Have Pick From Forty Men 
### 
Experimenting is nearly at an end
in the rival rugby camps of Stanford
and Santa Clara. From now on until
November 13, Coach Brown and Coach
Ybarrando will devote their entire
attention to perfecting team play and
all around effectiveness. The squads
of both institutions were out yester
day, Stanford using fifty men, the var
sity second team and substitutes,
while Santa Clara will pick her fifteen
from forty players. Training table
has been in vogue on the campus for
some time and went into effect at the
Santa Clara a Fighting Squad
Stanford meets the strong Olympic
Club team next Saturday in the final
game of the preliminary season, while
Santa Clara will hold forth with the
All-Star southern aggregation on the
following day. This just reverses the
taltles of last week when the Cardinal
players met the All-Stars and the Mis
sion town ruggers played the club
men. These games should give the
dopesters good opportunity for com
parative scores. Then again, a bet
ter conception may be had of what
the final line-ups will look like.
Mission town university yesterday.
A fighting team, with very strong
forwards, a backfield of fair ability,
and a number of stars of the first or
der, characterizes the University of
Santa Clara football team. Coach
Ybarrando has put his men through a
season of the hardest training and the
final line-up is beginning to take a
definite shape. Three of the best play
ers, namely Bates, Fowler, and Mil
burn, are not in the best form, owing
to injuries, but "Doc" Brown, the
trainer, states that every man will be
in trim for the Big Game.
Judging from the placing of the men
in recent games, the line-up of Santa
Clara should look very much like this
on the eventful 13th: Keating, Bates,
Amarel (O'Neil), front rank; Cos
chino, Oilman (Raftis, Korte), middle
rank: Pye, Hickey (Schallenback),
Higgins (Muldoon), rear rank; Diaz,
half; Scholz, Fowler (Mulbolland),
five-eighths; Fitzpatrick, center
three; Curtin, Milburn (Bensberg),
wings; Jackson (Wassum), fullback.
Australians Present in Line-up
The above players present a for
midable line-up to oppose any team.
Bates and Pye are Australian rugby
men of note. Diaz at half is fast. Cap
tain Scholz and Curtin have shown
their ability on many occasions, and
