# Luck Beguiles Davis,’18 He Receives a Fortune Loses and Regains It
## 
### 
G. A. Davis, 'IS, is suffering from
fluctuating fortune.
It's a disease new to most of us.
Here's Davis' history for the past
two months.
September 1, he arrived on the cam
pus, a normal sophomore .
September 30, he fell heir to a large
fortune, through the death of a near
relative. Davis didn't know whether
to be glad or sad.
So he did neither—he spectulated,
and lost his fortune.
Soon he regained it.
Again he lost it.
Then he received it back.
Davis did this about twenty times
in rapid succession last month. He
is still losing and regaining his for
tune, now daily. He has a premoni
tion that this thing will happen four
times more. Davis is hoping that
these fluctuations will end with the
wheel of fortune pointing his way.
So are the rest of us—for we'll wish
Davis the best of fortune, after we
see him as "Bobby Burnit" in the
sophomore play next Friday evening
in the Assembly Hall.
Tickets to "Bobby Burnit are now
on sale at the Bookstore and Wein
gartner's in Palo Alto.
