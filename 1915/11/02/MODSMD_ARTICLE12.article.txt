# FRESHMEN RUSH PYRE FOR BONFIRE RALLY
## 
### 
Freshmen have been at work for the
past two weeks on the bonfire, which
is to be touched off one week from
Thursday at the annual rally before
the Big Game.
Framework of the pyre is nearly
completed, corner poles and part of
the frame having been constructed
during the past week. R. Derby, '19,
who is in charge of the construction
work, asks for larger crews turning
out armed with saws, hatchets, or
hammers.
Guard work will commence tonight.
One member of the committee will
take charge each night. Freshmen on
the Row will be chosen at the discre
tion of the committeeman in charge
to guard each successive night up to
Saturday, when the freshman class as
a whole will become sentries.
