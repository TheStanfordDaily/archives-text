# RUGBY AND YELLS TURF BILL OF FARE TOMORROW
## P.A. ATHLETIC CLUB ON DECK Large Turn Out of Fans Urged for the Big Rally at Final Mid-Week Contest 
### 
Rugby a la carte is on the bill of
fare with a song and yell rally as a
side dish for the Stanford turf tomor
row. Si Davidson's Palo Alto Blues
and the Cardinal varsity will charge
down on the pigskin after the 'cir-k-off
at 4:30 in what is probably the last
mid-week rugby classic of the 1915
season. With the big fray but ten
days distant, fans will regard tomor
row's affair from a different
than that with which they Kave earlier
contests with the town bunch the
usual once-over.
In addition to te varsity, Floyd
Brown will send Hob Johnson and Bob
Pelouze into battle with the regulars.
Pelouze is captain of the 1919 fifteen,
while Johnson was recently promoted
to the varsity aggregation. Both
these men are in San Francisco today
treading the turf of Ewing field.
Yell Leader Goodman announced to
day that bins should be out in goodly
numbers tomorrow to practice songs
and yells for the Santa Clara func
tion. The band will be on deck. Good
man wishes to impress rooters with
the idea that the days before the 13th
are numbered and that now is the time
to learn to yell effectively and intelli
gently.
Breathing space on the splinters
may be enjoyed by allowing an upper
cut on the five-dollar cardboard, or by
sliding a round silver piece known as
"two bits" under the rusty bars.
