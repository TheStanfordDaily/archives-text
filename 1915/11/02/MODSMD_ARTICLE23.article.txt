# Outdoor Entertainment Big Need lor Stanford

### 
To the Editor: —
Permit nie to add a word to your discussion of the need of an outdoor
theatre at Stanford, it seems lamentable, to say the least, that in what
we choose to call the leading university of the West, there is no provision
whatever for artistic outdoor dramatic performances. On all sides of us,
at Carmel, the University of California, Bohemian Grove, and Muir Woods,
are excellent open-air theatres, maintained for the purpose of advancing
that form of dramatic art which flourishes so easily and successfully in
California. Yet among the natural amphitheatres of the Palo Alto iiills,
with proscenium arches of magnificent oaks, there is not the semblance
of an attempt at the adaptation of natural beauty to the uses of the drama.
********
If there is a tendency at present toward monotony in local produc
tions, is it not due in a great measure to the limitations of the Assembly
Hall stage? This seems very probable indeed to me. It has already been
suggested in this paper that Stanford dramatic societies co-operate in an
effort to secure such a theatre. Various members of the faculty have
promised their earnest assistance in such an effort. Student and faculty
co-operation should be able to reach many sources of individual aid. Then
something definite could be learned regarding the plausibility of such a
scheme.
********
The advantages of such a theatre are almost too obvious to require
mention. The Berkeley Greek Theatre has attracted world-wide attention,
and has attracted world stars to its stage. It has been the greatest in
fluence of the entire West in the development of the drama. This is the
day of the pageant, the spectacle-play, and the open-air drama. Any artis
tic and play-loving community which does not recognize this fact is behind
the times and so loses all opportunities of participating in a movement
which is as cultural as it is enjoyable.
It#******
Here is the proposition: A good outdoor theatre can be erected at a
surprisingly low price. It may be of a rustic type, located in the hills, or
it may be more artificial, but still attractive, located near the Quad. Its
upkeep will be practically nothing; its life exceedingly long. It will be
at the service of any student organization. It will lend itself to tragedy,
comedy, pageantry, or musical shows. Above all it will give variety.
If there is sufficient interest in the matter to warrant investigation,
let there be action at a union meeting of representatives from the various
campus organizations which should be most closely identified with the
project.
