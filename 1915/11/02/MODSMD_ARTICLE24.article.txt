speare play, and to write tlnit criti
cism. It is 7:3b p. in.
Pete (slams down books, lights the
"tungsten," and makes himself "com

bad a keen time at the dance Satur
day. As the reader will remember,
our main aim is to have a good time —
was to trace through them his devel
opment as a dramatist and . . . .
