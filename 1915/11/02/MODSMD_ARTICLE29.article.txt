# LOCKWOOD WRITES OF WORK AMONG CHINESE
## Orientals Active in Y.M.C.A. According to Former Stanford Secretary 
### 
E. H. Lockwood, formerly general
secretary of the Y. M. C. A. at Stan
ford, is engaged in Y. M. C. A. work
in China at the present time. Below
is at letter written by him to R. E.
Needham/16, Stanford's Y. M. C. A.
president:
September 24, 1915.
Care of Y. M. C. A.,
Shanghai, China.
My dear Roy: —
A mail goes tomorrow and I want
to get a note off to you on it.
We have been about a week on Chi
nese soil and our impressions are va
ried. I wish you could meet with me
the men who are in this work in China,
i They are mighty capable men, but
more than that, a splendid spirit of
fellowship runs through their work,
uniting them in a remarkable way. I
have met some of tlie men in Japan
on the way out, and since coming have
met many more in this country.
They are a hard working crowd,
spending long hours under trying
! conditions. This means sacrifices for
themselves and for their wives. On
the other hand, there are compensa
! tions in the way of results such as
I are not seen at home. I stood the
other night at the head of the stairs in
the Shanghai Y. M. C. A. and saw
about six hundred men streaming in
for the evening schools. Each man
is in some way brought into personal
! relationship with a Christian man
I while he is attending the school. In
addition to this number in evening
educational classes, there are about
five hundred in the day school. This
makes a total enrollment of over
j eleven hundred students. When the
! enrollment was made for Bible studv
I
j classes the other evening, about three
i hundred men signed up: and they ex
] pect to have about five hundred in
| evening school Bible study, for which
!no credit is given. The secretarial
j staff conference which I attended the
other morning brought about thirty
i Chinese men around a table. Several
| were returned Chinese from America,
but most of them were graduates from
Chinese colleges. A few evenings
later I attended the board of directors'
; meeting, and they spent three hours
| talking about the work. Most of these
[ men were returned students from
America, holding positions of respon
; sibility. One was the president of the
j Chinese Express Company, another
the owner of a large cotton mill, a
third was the operating manager of a
railroad, and so on around the table.
1 suppose that some evenings find
the crowd on the bleachers cheering
the team. I wish I could have at least
one sack of peanuts to eat on the side
lines. Perhaps when I get back, Cali
fornia will have returned to rugby and
1 will have a chance to see the Car
dinal triumphant once more.

My dear Roy: —
A mail goes tomorrow and I want
to get a note off to you on it.
We have been about a week on Chi
nese soil and our impressions are va
ried. I wish you could meet with me
the men who are in this work in China,
i They are mighty capable men, but
more than that, a splendid spirit of
fellowship runs through their work,
uniting them in a remarkable way. I
have met some of tlie men in Japan
on the way out, and since coming have
met many more in this country.
They are a hard working crowd,
spending long hours under trying
! conditions. This means sacrifices for
themselves and for their wives. On
the other hand, there are compensa
! tions in the way of results such as
I are not seen at home. I stood the
other night at the head of the stairs in
the Shanghai Y. M. C. A. and saw
about six hundred men streaming in
for the evening schools. Each man
is in some way brought into personal
! relationship with a Christian man
I while he is attending the school. In
addition to this number in evening
educational classes, there are about
five hundred in the day school. This
makes a total enrollment of over
j eleven hundred students. When the
! enrollment was made for Bible studv
I
j classes the other evening, about three
i hundred men signed up: and they ex
] pect to have about five hundred in
| evening school Bible study, for which
!no credit is given. The secretarial
j staff conference which I attended the
other morning brought about thirty
i Chinese men around a table. Several
| were returned Chinese from America,
but most of them were graduates from
Chinese colleges. A few evenings
later I attended the board of directors'
; meeting, and they spent three hours
| talking about the work. Most of these
[ men were returned students from
America, holding positions of respon
; sibility. One was the president of the
j Chinese Express Company, another
the owner of a large cotton mill, a
third was the operating manager of a
railroad, and so on around the table.
1 suppose that some evenings find
the crowd on the bleachers cheering
the team. I wish I could have at least
one sack of peanuts to eat on the side
lines. Perhaps when I get back, Cali
fornia will have returned to rugby and
1 will have a chance to see the Car
dinal triumphant once more.
