# Quad Pictures Must Be Turned In On the Dot
## All Organizations Must Apply for Space Before December 
### 
Two weeks remain for Juniors to
have their class pictures taken for the
Quad. All who have paid their Quad
dues of five dollars may make appoint
ments at once with Frank Davey.
Those who have not paid should send
the money at once to H. L. Hews, 1917,
Quad manager.
Organizations must make applica
tion for space and pay for the same
before December 1, though to allow
for any changes in membership the
time set for the pictures to be taken
is February 1. Davey has made a spe
cial rate for the Quad this year and
organization pictures if taken early
will be at the unusually low rate of
three dollars per group.
All fraternities will be required to
have group pictures this year for the
Quad in order to secure uniformity
in the cuts used in that department.
Sororities will have the usual style of
individual photographs. If such pho
tos are taken anywhere but at Davey's
the rules for background must lie ob
served. All pictures of this nature
will have to be taken with medium
gray background instead of with the
light background required last year.
