# DR. JORDAN'S NEW BOOK "WAR AND BREED" IS OFF PRESS
## ARTICLES TOTAL FOUR SCORE Contributions by Rendtorff and Irwin Added to Book for Appendix 
### 
Few writers of the present century
can point to a list of their publications
for the past year with greater pride
than can David Starr Jordan, whose
publications for 1914-1." total nearly
four score. Chancellor Jordan's edi
torials and articles on various phases
of war and peace have appeared in
practically every newspaper of note
throughout the United States. There
has hardly been a month but that the
table of contents of one or more maga
zines contained the name of Stanford's
Chancellor as the author of article,
editorial or thesis.
"War and Breed" Latest Work
"War and the Breed," Dr. Jordan's
latest effort, is off the press of the
Beacon Company of Boston. In
graphic style, convincing and logical,
the writer shows the "Relation of War
to the Downfall of Nations." In his
preface, dated Stanford University,
March 20, 191"), Chancellor Jordan
says:
"This booK is written to show the
relation of war to the downfall of na
tions. The certainty that war leads
toward a racial decadence by the ob
literation of the most virile elements,
these being thereby left unrepresented
in heredity, is becoming widely ac
cepted as the crucial argument against
the war system of the world, stand
ing second only to the final argument
of the human conscience that murder
remains murder even when done on a
gigantic scale under the sanction of
the state and the blessing of the
church."
Stanford Writers Add Articles
In the appendix to his latest work
Chancellor Jordan has added "The
Decline of German Literature in the
I Thirteenth Century," by Professor
i Karl (5. Rendtorff of Stanford, and
which is here published for the first
time. Although a partial digression,
the article bears upon the main argu
ment inasmuch as it shows the re
sult of war upon the literature of Ger
many. From the San Francisco
Chronicle has been taken for the ap
pendix, an article by Will Irwin on
'"Peace and Degeneracy," written from
experiences at the front.
"War and Breed" aims straight and
true to teach the lesson that was con
tained in the thesis of Darwin, stated
in his Descent of Man, 1871; the best
are killed, the inferior remain to
I propogate their kind.
Race Future Depends on Present
"By the law of heredity," Dr. Jor
dan says, "like the seeds, so is the
harvest, and the future of the race
repeats the qualities of those war
does not use. This thesis is logically
without flaw, but to demonstrate its
actual validity through the results of
experiments of nations is a task of the
most complex character. For a na
tion does not miss that which it has
not had, and all considerations of
value of strains of inheritance are
mixed inextricably with results of ed
ucation, organization, commerce, in
dustrialism, opportunity and immi
graton,â€”influences which may seem
to transform a nation in a manner
quite independent of the real capacity
of its people. However, to show that
the thesis is true in fact as well as
sound in theory, is the purpose of this
book."
