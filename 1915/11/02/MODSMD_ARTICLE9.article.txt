# Two Radical Changes Announced in Law Department Grading
## 
### 
A raidcal change in the standards
and marking system of the Law de
partment has just been announced by
Dean F. C. Woodward. The innova
tions come as an action of the faculty
of the Law school.
There are five provisions in all,
three of which are to take place im
mediately. The first makes the grade
of condition a thing of the past in
all second and third year professional
courses. Hereafter anything below
wil be a failure, whereas former
ly grades between and 60% were
conditions. This does not include
courses which are required for the
A. B. degree, as the faculty did not
think it advisable to adopt a system
for such work differing from that pre
vailing throughout the other depart
ments of the university. The reasons
for abolishing the condition are that
experience has proven that students
who incur conditions rarely get cred
itable grades upon re-examination,
and that it is better in any event for
the course to be repeated.
Scholarship Standard liaised
The second provision is that re
examinations for first year courses
may be had on a special date set by
tbe instructor, or may be taken at the
following regular date. If not taken,
the condition becomes a failure. The
third rule provides for examination
