The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
The original "Tuxedo Process" turns out the finest
finished product in the smoke-world. Tobacco without
one particle of harshness or bite in it — so soothing and
mild and pleasant you never want to stop smoking it,
and never have to. It's all-day-long enjoyment with
Tuxedo, from the first bracing
smoke in the morning to the
last restful pipe at night.
You try it for a week —in pipe
or cigarette— early and often.
Stack it up against the best you
ever smoked — and you'll find
something better in Tuxedo.
