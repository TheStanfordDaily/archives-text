# STUDENTS GET BOOKS AT LOWEST RATE POSSIBLE
## COMMITTEE OF WOMEN MEETS Bookstore Invites Inquiries Concerning Management of Business 
### 
That the Stanford student is getting
his books at the lowest figure now
possible and that it rests in his own
hands to make the price still lower
was the gist of an explanation of the
working of the Stanford Bookstore
given to a committee of Stanford
women who visited the store today.
It has been estimated that only
about one-third of the money which is
annually expended for books at Stan
ford finds its way into the Bookstore.
If the whole volume of business which
goes elsewhere could be carried on by
the Bookstore, the students would be
able to get their books at a lower rate
than that at which the store is now
aide to supply them. The larger the
business, the larger the quantities
in which the Bookstore can purchase
and the lower the price at which the
student may get his supplies.
If, instead of the $45,000 which was
the sum of the business done at the
Bookstore in the fiscal year 1914-1915
the whole of the $120,000 spent annu
ally by the students for books was
spent at the Bookstore, the profit
sharing system now in force would
make the actual amount of cash
turned back to the students each year
about two hundred per cent greater.
That certain supplies may be ob
tained more cheaply elsewhere is due
always either to some mistake or to
the fact that the Bookstore is not able
to buy the supply in sufficiently large
quantities to lower the price on them.
The manager, Guy Miller, '02, would
welcome any inquiries as to prices or
other matters which are not clear to
any of the students. If any one
wishes explanation of any point
doubtful in his mind it will be most
gladly given.
