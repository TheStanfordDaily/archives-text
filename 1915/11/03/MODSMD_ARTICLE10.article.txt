# VARSITY SWAMPS PALO ALTO TEAM
## 
### 
In the final mid-week contest of the
season, the Stanford varsity proved
itself to lie in excellent trim by snow
ing the Palo Alto Athletic Club under
a 22 to 0 count. The aggregation col
lected by Manager Davidson was both
strong on paper and on the field.
The varsity forwards showed up ex
ceptionally well after once getting
into action. The visiting defense
seemed of little value when the pack
meant business. One of the pleasing
features of the game was the Erb,
V-'alker, Urban, Carroll combination,
which rarely failed to gain ground.
The halves were twenty and thirty
minutes. Peter Flanagan held the
whistle. The game in detail follows:
First Half.
Templeton kicked off. After five
minutes of repeated forward and
backfield attack, Stanford brought the
play up to the ten-yard mark, when
a scrum was called for held ball. As
the pigskin shot out of the pack, Wylie
bolted across for a try. Templeton
and Erb converted. After once find
ing their stride, the varsity kept up
a continuous hammering on the Palo
Alto goal line. Finally the Walker,
Carrol] to Pelouze combination per
mitted the freshman wing to score,
after covering thirty yards. Temple
ton converted. The usual gun-shot try
concluded the half. Ric Templeton
received on Palo Alto's thirty-flve
yard line, ran in, and then the ball
wns transferred from Pelouze to

W.vlie to Rehm, who registered. Tem
pleton failed at conversion. Score
13-ft.
Second Half.
Following a short kick-off from Palo
Alto, Stanford sailed right along at
her usual gait. The first score of the
period fell to Erb, who, after swoop
ing from the loose, wriggled twenty
yards across. Ric Templeton missed
a difficult goal. Dink Templeton came
in the score column a minute later
by dropping a penalty goal forty
yards, square between the posts, upon
a free-kick award. The next Cardinal
tally was somewhat in the nature of
a gift. Danny Carroll received
Cashel's kick when over the line, and
merely touched down. Templeton
atjain failed to convert. At this point
C'y Davidson's proteges took a de
cided brace, keeping the varsity busy
throwing back a persistent offense.
The end of the half found the ball
at midfield. Final score, 22-0.
