# Going Shopping?

We want to talk business today.
Business is an important topic. Not
because of laziness in particular, but
because someone else has got away
with the discussion in a way we can't
hope to improve, we resort to quota
tion marks.
"There can be no doubt that mer
chants are the life impulse of college
publications. Student enterprise would
go a very short way on its own totter
ing legs. The campus world is not
a thing apart and independent. If
students assume the right to enti r
business relations with men, they mil fit
cut the tape at the finish.
"Financial responsibility is a desir
able part of liberal education. Prove
to the business houses who support
The Daily Palo Alto and others of
your possessions, your willingness to
come back at them. You aren't ob
jects of charity. You want to trans
act business by giving value for what
you receive. Make an effort to give
your patronage in exchange for adver
tisements. Let the donations go to the
aid of widows and orphans.
"Advertisers in general are the most
reliable men in business. This is true
of the people who advertise their ser
vices in The Daily Palo Alto. You
can't go far wrong if you look them
over, and then try them out, aud tell
them why you came their way. You
feel a duty to help elect a good stu
dent body president, and play fair on
the football turf. You are against
crabbing at the umpire. You don't
like to see a fellow beat his bills, or
fudge in his ex's. Your duty to the
advertisers is as active as any one of
these. Fly to it."
