# Faculty Member Voices Plea for Local Open-Air Theater
## 
### 
To the Editor: —
Ex-President Taft's coming to Stan
ford was a satisfaction in fact but a
problem in prospect. The university
and the community wished to honor
itself as well as Mr. Taft by seeing
and hearing him. This was impos
sible in the Assembly Hall, the seat
ing capacity of which is nearly 200
less than the number of students reg
istered. Several suggested recourse
to the football bleachers, and the
Committee on Public Exercises de
cided to try them. The results, good
and bad, everyone knows, but they
may be summarized in a colloquy be
tween two members of the faculty.
Asked what comment he had to make
on the use of the bleachers for that
occasion, one man said, "Pretty hot."
"Yes," the other replied, "but think
how much hotter half those people
would have been if they had been kept
out of the Assembly Hall."
But unsuitable as the bleachers
themselves are for academic func
tions, and for spectacles, plays, and
concerts, they nevertheless show, how
desirable a real open-air theatre is
in this climate. Coming, as most of
the pioneers did, from parts of the
earth with climate rather severe, the
early leaders of the university brought
with them the habit of excluding
rather than welcoming the air and
sunshine. They slept, ate, exercised
and lived indoors; they were obliged
to before they migrated hither; and
only slowly have we all come to see
that the more we do, the more com
pletely we live, out of doors, the
better.
liiviiliuiblc to rniversity
The need of a larger place of as
sembly, and the desirability of having
it fit and express the natural advan
tages which we, consciously and un
consciously, possess, lead naturally to
the thought of an outdoor theatre. It
should be easily accessible, by street
car as well as carriage, it should be
sheltered from wind and undue heat,
it should be so screened that neither
slare nor ugliness should distress its
occupants, and it should provide rea
sonable comfort for those on and be
fore the stage. Such places can be
found. On the slopes around Lagunita
are two at least, and the shade of the
Arboretum may offer more. But with
the increasing number of alumni and
friends of the university wishing to at
tend its commencements, its Founders'
Days, its Twenty-fifth Anniversary and
other celebrations, we need room. The
out-of-doors offers the space. Can we
not utilize some of it?

To the Editor: —
Ex-President Taft's coming to Stan
ford was a satisfaction in fact but a
problem in prospect. The university
and the community wished to honor
itself as well as Mr. Taft by seeing
and hearing him. This was impos
sible in the Assembly Hall, the seat
ing capacity of which is nearly 200
less than the number of students reg
istered. Several suggested recourse
to the football bleachers, and the
Committee on Public Exercises de
cided to try them. The results, good
and bad, everyone knows, but they
may be summarized in a colloquy be
tween two members of the faculty.
Asked what comment he had to make
on the use of the bleachers for that
occasion, one man said, "Pretty hot."
"Yes," the other replied, "but think
how much hotter half those people
would have been if they had been kept
out of the Assembly Hall."
But unsuitable as the bleachers
themselves are for academic func
tions, and for spectacles, plays, and
concerts, they nevertheless show, how
desirable a real open-air theatre is
in this climate. Coming, as most of
the pioneers did, from parts of the
earth with climate rather severe, the
early leaders of the university brought
with them the habit of excluding
rather than welcoming the air and
sunshine. They slept, ate, exercised
and lived indoors; they were obliged
to before they migrated hither; and
only slowly have we all come to see
that the more we do, the more com
pletely we live, out of doors, the
better.

The need of a larger place of as
sembly, and the desirability of having
it fit and express the natural advan
tages which we, consciously and un
consciously, possess, lead naturally to
the thought of an outdoor theatre. It
should be easily accessible, by street
car as well as carriage, it should be
sheltered from wind and undue heat,
it should be so screened that neither
slare nor ugliness should distress its
occupants, and it should provide rea
sonable comfort for those on and be
fore the stage. Such places can be
found. On the slopes around Lagunita
are two at least, and the shade of the
Arboretum may offer more. But with
the increasing number of alumni and
friends of the university wishing to at
tend its commencements, its Founders'
Days, its Twenty-fifth Anniversary and
other celebrations, we need room. The
out-of-doors offers the space. Can we
not utilize some of it?
