# PLANS ARE COMPLETE FOR 1918 COTILLION
## Japanese Scheme of Decoration Chosen—California Building Orchestra to Play 
### 
A sojourn in a minature Japan is
the treat in store for the Cotillion
goers who will gather for revelry on
Thanksgiving eve. The problem of
decorating the high, girdered upper
structure of the gymnasium has been
solved by a plan to introduce a false
ceiling of white flowers beneath the
beams in such a way that they will
be almost totally hidden from view.
Under this fragrant screen are to be
hung numerous Japanese lanterns
from which a soft luster will be shed
upon the scene of festivity below.
A charming representation of a snujll
Japanese tea house has been planned
for the center of the (loor and will
\ serve as a screen for the now famous
I California building orchestra. In
j contrast to the decorations made from
• the small white flowers, the numerals
of the Sophomore class are to be
made up of large chrysanthemums.
I These are to be placed in bold relief
upon one of the wall surfaces.
The ticket sale for the Cotillion
commenced Monday afternoon and up
i to this time over one-third of the en
tire number have been sold.
