# Murray and Floete on Track are Stars of Exposition Meet
## 
### 
Stanford track men again proved
their superiority by winning the ma
jority of the events on the exposition
track yesterday. "Feg" Murray, '16,
romped away with the 150-yard low
hurdles in the excellent time of 17 3/5
seconds. He also placed a close sec
ond to C. E. Floete, 'lit, in the 100-yard
dash, the latter beginning his track
work for Stanford in good style by
winning the event in 10 1/5 seconds.
The time is considered exceptional as
the track was very slow. The 600-
yard relay race was won by Berkeley
high school.
