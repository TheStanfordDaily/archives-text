# Baseball Veteran Dies at Home in Palo Alto
## T.K. Phillips, University Press Bookbinder, Remembered the Invention of Catching Mitts 
### 
With the death of Thomas K. Phil
lips, last night in Palo Alto, passed
into history one of the few remaining
men who saw baseball come into its
own in the United States.
"Dad" Phillips has been in charge
of the bookbinding department of the
University Press for the last twelve
years anil many students have heard
him tell of the first time a baseball
mitt was ever used. He was a team
mate of A. (J. Spalding, the famous
maker of athletic goods, and it was in
the company of Spalding that he saw
the mitt used.
Phillips was a member of the fa
mous Rockton nine which defeated
every team in the state of Illinois and
then cleaned up the New York Red
Socks forty or fifty years ago.
"It was in one of the games that
the Rockton squad played," he was
wont to reminisce, "that Spal
ding and I noticed a peculiar
popping sound every time the first
baseman of tlie opposing team re
ceived the ball. Our curiosity was
aroused and so we investigated. He
had a piece of metal that fitted the
palm of his hand which was covered
with leather. We had never seen any
thing like it before as the players
in those days caught the swiftest ball
with the bare hand. He explained
that lie had received an injury to his
hand and did not want to be put out
of the game, so lie invented the mitt.
T think it was here that Spalding first
got tlie idea of the finger mitt that
later made him famous."
Phillips was for years the head of
the bookbinding department of Phil
lips and Stilwell in San Francisco.
This firm was one of the first of its
kind in San Francisco and "Dad" was
with the firm from its beginning.
