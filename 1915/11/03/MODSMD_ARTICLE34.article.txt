# Timely Intervention Saves Encina from Serious Blaze
## 
### 
Timely intervention prevented what
might have been a serious conflagra
tion in room 133 of FJncina Hall last
night. When C. P. Leh, '17, accom
panied by friends, entered his room
at 8:30 o'clock, be was met by a cloud
of smoke.
The table, waste basket, and carpet
were ablaze. Fire fighters were im
mediately pressed into service, and the
burning articles promptly smothered.
The greatest loss, Leh declares, will
be several reams of valuable lecture
notes.
