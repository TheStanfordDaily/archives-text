# California Varsity Meets Nevada
## 
### 
In preparation for the game with
Washington next Saturday, the Uni
versity of California football team
met the Nevada aggregation which
played the California freshmen last
Saturday. The practice game was
played today on the Berkeley field.
California is having a great deal of
trouble with tlie end positions. Cohen
is out for the season with an injury
and Hazeltine has not proven a suc
cess. Montgomery was tried out with
(lianelli today in an effort to secure
a suitable combination.
