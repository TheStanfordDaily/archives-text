# Bobby Burnit is Ready Says Margery Bailey
## Smith Comedy Ideal Sophomore Play Is Opinian of Stanford Dramatic Star 
### 
"Everything seems to be in readi
ness for 'Bobby Burnit,' says Miss
.Margery Bailey, after watching a
sophomore play rehearsal, at the re
quest of The Daily Palo Alto.
"The conscientious manner in
which the cast has gone at the me
chanical work of producing a play is
to be heartily commended."
According to Miss Bailey "Bobby
Burnit" is a "typical sophomore play,
full of life and action, and also full
of villains and doddering old men.
The big difference in 'Bobby Burnit'
is that villains in the pla> are good
villains, and the doddering old men
are really shakey old scouts.
Stone Is Menacing
"The part of Stone, political boss,
by A. L. Wilkie is particularly good.
It is not overdone, though it is strong
enough to make one feel that Stone is
menacing. He says things in his
voice as though he meant them.
"The ease of the actors in 'Bobby
Burnit' is commendable. For sopho
mores, the actors appear experienced.
There are a number of unusually
clever comic scenes, and one of the
best is where Bates, Bowery tough,
appears to be killed by one of Burnit's
rivals. This is well handled.
Davis Meant for Serious Drama
"Gordon Davis, leading man, is an
actor meant for serious drama; in
consideration of this, his work in farce
is to be commended. His words bub
ble forth with effervescent and rapid
enthusiasm.
"Ed Kneass carries his part excep
tionally well. Incidentally, 'Bobby
Burnit' is a typical sophomore play
in one other way. It is all men and
no women in the important parts,—
there is poor chance for the girls of
the class.
Miss Mhsoii Convincing
"Of the three small women's parts,
Miss Florence Mason's interpretation
is by far the most convincing, although
her part is one of the smallest. Her
clear, full, voice carries well, her ac
tion appears to be unstudied and spon
taneous—it is really gracefully con
sideration for an audience which likes
always to see natural and unaffected
work upon the stage."
