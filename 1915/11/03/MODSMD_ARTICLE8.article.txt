# A 						THOUSAND ROOTERS BUY BIG GAME TICKETS
## General Public Will be Permitted to Purchase Pasteboards After November 8 
### 
Tickets for the Big Game are now
being distributed at the Graduate Man
ager's office on presentation of re
ceipts received by applicants last
week. One thousand rooters will
adorn the yell section this year. It is
the plan to have the Cardinal fans
form the initials of the university,
"L. S. J. U."
Tickets for the general sections have
also been made ready for distribution
at the Graduate Manager's office. Sev
eral sections have already been re
served for Stanford alumni and stu
dents who are not numbered among
the one thousand rooters.
At present, sale of tickets is open to
alumni of the university, and will be
held for them until November 8, when
sale will be thrown open to the gen
eral public.
Sale of Tickets good
Graduate Manager Behrens is well
pleased with the sale of tickets to
date, and believes that Ewing field
will be packed with a record crowd,
provided outside interest in the Big
Game can be judged by that mani
fested on the campus and by alumni.
No seats will be reserved for either
Stanford or Santa Clara students after
this week. Consequently, all applica
tions must be in by the end of the
week, if advantage is to be taken of
the preferred sections of the bleachers.
