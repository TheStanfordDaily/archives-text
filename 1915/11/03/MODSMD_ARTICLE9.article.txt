# Varsity Practices in City
## Twenty-two Men Tryout Ewing Field Yesterday 
### 
Coach Brown took twenty-two men
of the Stanford varsity to San Fran
cisco yesterday to practice on Ewing
field, the scene of the Big Game this
year. A light workout only was in
dulged in, the men trying to get ac
customed to the rather hard turf of
the former baseball diamond, and the
situation of the touch lines in respect
to the bleachers. After lunching at
the Ilof Brau cafe, the team witnessed
the game between the Northern and
Southern All-Stars.
