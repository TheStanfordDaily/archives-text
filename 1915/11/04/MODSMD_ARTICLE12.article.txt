# FRESHMAN SCHOLARSHIP LOW
## Ninety-three First Year Men Receive Double "Smokeups" 
### 
Freshmen living off the campus have
a rougher scholastic road to travel
than those situated otherwise, if the
scholarship report made today by
Student Adviser S. S. Simonson, '15,
be taken as an index. The report re
fers only to freshmen who have been
"smoked-tip" in more than one subject
and \\ ho have automatically come un
der the surveillance of the Committee
on Scholarship.
One hundred and eighty-five, or 5.8%
of the total enrollment of the univer
sity recently received double warn
ings from the Scholarship Committee.
Of this number one-half are freshmen.
Of the ninety-three freshmen who are
listed by the Scholarship Committee,
forty-two, or nearly 45% live off the
campus. The following statement of
percentages shows the proportions of
the delinquent students among all
campus orsanizationos.
From the fifty-one freshmen residing
on the campus who received a double
warning, fraternities claim the sur
prising total of thirty-four, or 68%.
The boarding houses follow next with
ten men or 189' of the total, while
Encina foots the list with only seven
or 14% of the entire number.
Double Smoke-lips for lss
Three fraternities are in close com
petition for the lowest freshman schol
astic standing while three others are
enjoying total exemption from the
warning notices. The freshmen from
fraternity number one in the first
group received five double warning
notices, two others follow closely with
four, thereby tying for second place,
while house number four received
three of the notices. The remaining
fraternities, with the exception of
three, received one or two of the double
"smoke-ups."
No statistics are available for the
women living on or off the campus.
The total number of women inclusive
of the four classes receiving double
warnings is fifteen, or exactly 8% of
total number warned. Since, rough
ly, 2~>'' of the student body are women,
their scholarship record is consider
ably ahove that of the men.
