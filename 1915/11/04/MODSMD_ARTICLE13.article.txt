# Sophomore Play Seat Sale Exceeds Semester's Record
## Costumes and Scenes for Bobby Burnit Almost Ready 
### 
"Bobby Burn it," sophomore play,
has enjoyed a sale to date that shat
ters the record of other dramatic pro
ductions at Stanford this year, though
as yet an attendance over all former
second year plays is not entirely as
sured.
Owing to a legal holiday no draw
ing was held at Weingartner's in Palo
Alto Tuesday afternoon, but sale of
tickets opened yesterday. A number
of good seats are still on sale there,
and a few are left at the Bookstore.
Scenes, costumes, and other details
of production are being made ready by
the play committee. Coach Arthur
Cyril believes that final touches in
rounding the sophomores into a cast
have been easily put on in the last
few rehearsals in the Assembly Hall.
