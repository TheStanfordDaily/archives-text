## OUTLINECOMPETITIVESYSTEM Executive Committee Advises Sophomores---Big Game Well Advertised 
### 
A plan for the competitive selection
of future editors and managers of the
Stanford Quad was accepted by the Ex
ecutive Committee last evening, and
recommended for adoption to the pres
ent. sophomore class. It was also
recommended that the proposition be
voted on as an amendment to the con

Plan in Detail
The plan as outlined is to conduct
tryouts to test the efficiency of sec

vision of an advisory board consisting
of the manager and editor of the pres
ent Quad, two members appointed by
the President of the A. S. S. U., and
manager and editor of the previous
year's Quad, â€”the last two to be ex
olficio members without a vote.
This board will keep in touch with
the candidates and will eliminate those
whose work is inefficient, recommend
ing not less than three for election.
The board will also offer suggestions
for improving the Quad.

This is practically the plan which
is in force at California, where it has

dation of the board will naturally
have an advantage. Those recom
mended will not be graded.
