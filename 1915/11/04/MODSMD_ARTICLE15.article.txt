# PLAN FORMULATED FOR HOLDING QUAD TRYOUTS
## OUTLINECOMPETITIVESYSTEM Executive Committee Advises Sophomores---Big Game Well Advertised 
### 
A plan for the competitive selection
of future editors and managers of the
Stanford Quad was accepted by the Ex
ecutive Committee last evening, and
recommended for adoption to the pres
ent. sophomore class. It was also
recommended that the proposition be
voted on as an amendment to the con
stitution of the A. S. S. U.
Plan in Detail
The plan as outlined is to conduct
tryouts to test the efficiency of sec
ond year candidates under the super
vision of an advisory board consisting
of the manager and editor of the pres
ent Quad, two members appointed by
the President of the A. S. S. U., and
manager and editor of the previous
year's Quad, â€”the last two to be ex
olficio members without a vote.
This board will keep in touch with
the candidates and will eliminate those
whose work is inefficient, recommend
ing not less than three for election.
The board will also offer suggestions
for improving the Quad.
Follows California Plan
This is practically the plan which
is in force at California, where it has
been very successful. It does not pre
vent others from running independent
ly, but those who have the recommen
dation of the board will naturally
have an advantage. Those recom
mended will not be graded.
Hig (tame Advertising
Graduate Manager Behrens pre
j sented a report on the big game adver
tising, outlining the campaign which
he has launched. One hundred large
bill boards have been placed at vari
ous points in both Oakland and San
Francisco. Aside from these the
Southern Pacific Company will place
cards in all railroad stations in the
state.
Twenty-five thousand stamps have
been printed which are being placed
on all letters going out of the Stan
ford Post Office, and from several of
the large business houses of San
Francisco. Letters are also being sent
to Stanford alumni, telling how to get
to the game; where Stanford head
quarters will be, and other informa
tion.
Football Sliotv Undecided
The plan to hold a dinner and cab
aret show at the Palace Hotel after
the game is thought by some to be
impracticable, as it is impossible to
get accommodations for less than two
dollars a head. Just what will be done
is as yet undecided. The minutes
follow:
Regular meeting, November 3, 1915.
President Wilson in the chair.
Carroll absent.
Minutes read and approved.

ball show.
Decided that President appoint two
men to arrange further details.

MSC that the following method of
selecting future Quad editors and
managers be recommended for adop
tion to the class of 1918, and also that
it be voted upon as an amendment to
