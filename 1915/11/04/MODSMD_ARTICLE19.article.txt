To the Presidents of House Clubs
and Fraternities:
Bleacher enthusiasm is sick.
You know it is, and you can
throw some jolts into the men
under your charge. They don't
know the songs and yells.
Neither do you. Make a racket
over the small blacks tonight,
and send your boys to the field
Saturday with the right idea.
