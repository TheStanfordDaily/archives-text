Everything is up to par except the
harmony program. Rooters' tickets
for the Big Game have had a brisk
sale, and the undergraduate stands
will he as well filled as ever they were
in the old days. Members of the
alumni body have responded heartily
to advance notices of the gala day in
San Francisco. Applications for gen
eral admission tickets are flooding the
graduate manager's office. Notices of
the intercollegiate rugby match are
catching the public eye in all parts of
the state. All sports followers on the
Coast will know that a football classic
is on the cards. And still the Stan
ford bleachers slumber.

That is our side of it.

The ticket sale among Santa Clara
students, and among their compatriots
in other Catholic schools in California
is brisk, too. Their alumni members,
as well as ours, have seen the game
of November 13 in prospect as it will
be in fact, —an unrivaled exhibition of
rugby art. Santa Clara's block of
tickets is shrinking rapidly. So far,
the members of the rival institutions
are running neck and neck in their
answer to the call of the contest. But
just here is the place where the anal
ogy is smashed to pieces.

Santa Clara students, and their sup
porters in sister schools, alumni,
friends, families, and professors are
all following the sway of the yell lead
ers. They are ready to play the game
from the side lines, and have learned
the songs and yells in such a way that
they can sing and yell them.
* * * *
If we don't realize now how miser
ably the songs and yells are going, we
shall read it in the papers of Novem
ber 14. Practice, get the idea, and
make a noise around the dinner tables.
Start in tonight, even if somebody has
to leave his dessert to play the piano
for you. Make the Saturday practice
a good one.
