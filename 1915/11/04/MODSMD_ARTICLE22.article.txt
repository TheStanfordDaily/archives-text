## TRAGEDY IN SIX CHAPS. 
### 
Chap. I —John Doe, '18, writes
day post-card to his auntie in San
Francisco, telling her four things: that
lie would celebrate Frisco Day at the
Expo Tuesday; that he would leave
Stanford Monday evening to attend a
dance, in the city; *hat he would love
to bunk on the family spare-ribs couch
in the dining room; that the key
should be left under the door-mat, as
he would not hope to seek bed before
1:30 a. m.
Chap. II —John Doe, '18, gives card
to a friend bound for S. F. Friend will
mail card at first opportunity.
Chap. Ill —John Doe, '18, has a
whooping big time Monday night lay
ing incense on the altar of Terpsichore,
and stealing powder for his blue-clad
manly shoulders from fair debutantes.
At 1 a. m., John Doe feels very much
like seeking a cheerupodist. He takes
his lady home and heads N. N. E. for
the key under the mat.
Chap. IV —At 1 a. m.the friend who
was bound for San Francisco on Sun
day evening is bound to make it seven
rounds. Suddenly his jaw drops
(wasting precious liquid): "Shay,
waiter, will yu be sho kind ash to mail
thish-ic card at onsh —it's very impor
tant-ic. Mark-ic it rush. Another
beerr."
Chap. V—John Doe, *18, spends fifty
(.10) minutes blowing into a keyhole
trying to make his gym-locker key do
the work of a Yale.
Chap. Vl—John Doe, '18, sleeps un
der a door-mat.
