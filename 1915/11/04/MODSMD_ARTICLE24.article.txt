# Local Musical Talent Should be Used at Dances---Graduate
## 
### 
To the Editor: —
It is noted that the music for the
Cotillion is to be furnished by a San
Francisco orchestra. The liberty is
taken to criticise that procedure
which is entitled to as drastic a
criticism as anyone might be capable
of applying. I am not alone in my
belief, but what I shall write I be
lieve and am personally responsible
for.
There is absolutely no sound rea
son why outside music should be
hired, and there are the following
numerous reasons why campus mu
sic should be given preference.
1. There are musicians at Stan
ford that are as capable as the out
siders who play here as far as dance
music is concerned, at least.
2. Local musicians freely donate
their services when the cause is
just. They work hard at charity
entertainments while others enjoy
themselves. Ask outsiders to do
nate their services and see what you
get. Still when there is a big Uni
versity function, music is needed
and money is paid for the needs,
outside organizations are given the
plum. Where is the reciprocity?
3. For forty-three dollars the Co
tillion will have a six-piece orches
tra with a strange name, while for
the same price the campus will fur
nish an eight-piece orchestra and
give three dollars back or if two
dollars be added, a nine-piece or
chestra. The six-piece orchestra I
assume will consist of a violin, pi
ano, cornet, clarinet, trombone, and
traps. Local orchestra would add
for the same price a flute, cello, and
bass viol. The combination may of
course be rearranged at pleasure,
but you are paying the outside com
bination for three players that are
not present.
4. A considerable number of Stan
ford students are earning their way
by means of music. The relation
among the students should be close
enough so that the seekers of an
education should be helped toward
their goal. Those outsiders are act
ively engaged in another field—let
them stay there, we owe them noth
ing. They do not hesitate to cut our
throat as has been proved. If any
one doubts this last statement I am
glad to verify it personally, but
rather not place the verification on
paper.
In conclusion: This article is not
written with the idea of benefiting
me personally as I have served my
time, but is written with the idea of
helping those that are yet to serve.
My belief is that you will travel
far before you find musical organi
zations and musicians as capable as
those at Stanford in a community no
larger.
Respectfully,
G. P. ROSS, '14.
