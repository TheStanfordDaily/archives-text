In last night's issue of The Daily
Palo Alto, the following errors were
noted in tlie interview with Miss Mar
gery Bailey regarding "Bobby Burnit,"
sophomore play.
Miss Bailey was misquoted in the
following paragraphs:
According to Miss Bailey "Bobby
Burnit" is a typical sophomore play,
full of life and action, and also full
of villains and doddering old men.
The big difference in "Bobby Burnit"
is that villains in the play are good
villains, and the doddering old men
are really shakey old scouts.
Stone Is Menacing
"The part of Stone, political boss,
by A. L. Wilkie is particularly good.
It is not overdone, though it is strong
enough to make one feel that Stone is
menacing. He says things in his
voice as though he meant them."
In the first paragraph quotations
were omitted at the end of the first
sentence, after "mon," through a proof
reader's error. In the last sentence
of the second paragraph, the word
"strong" was omitted before "voice,"
through a similar error. The sentence
should read: "He says things in his
strong voice as thouch he meant
them."
