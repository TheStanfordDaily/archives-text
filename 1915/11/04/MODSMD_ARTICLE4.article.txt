# Rowing Machines and Barges are Ready for Crew
## 
### 
Fall crew received a double impetus
yesterday by the installation of two
new Spalding rowing machines in the
Lagunita boatliouse and the transpor
tation of the two training barges to
the Redwood boatliouse. The new
rowing machines are exact duplicates
of the two that were unceremoniously
removed from the Lagunita early in
the semester. They were installed by
a representative of the Spalding house
in San Francisco.
Although no actual work upon the
water will commence until after the
Big Game, it was deemed wise to have
the barges in readiness for the late
semester practice. It is hoped that by
such practice much time will be
gained at the beginning of the next
semester.
Over a score of ambitious freshmen,
not actively engaged in other sports,
have been reporting for instruction at
the lake. The number of feather
weights signing up for the coveted
position of coxswain, has, up to this
time, been almost equal to that of
the oarsmen.
Crew Captain C. H. Orme, '10, ur
gently desires that all freshmen who
intend coming out for crew and who
are not retained at present by some
other sport, report for fall practice
as soon as possible. Those who are
now participating in a sport for a
gymnasium credit will be able to
transfer to crew next Monday, Novem
ber 8.
