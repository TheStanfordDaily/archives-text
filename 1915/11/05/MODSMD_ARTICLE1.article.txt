## INTERCOLLEGIATE NEXT WEEK Final Practices Prepare Men for California and U.S. C. Clashes 
### 
One week from tonight Stanford will
clash with the University of Cali
fornia in the annual intercollegiate
debate in San Francisco. As this is
about the only contest in which the
heretofore rival institutions will com
pete this year, interest should be
greater than ever before.
On the same evening that the Cardi
nal and Blue and Gold speakers con
tend in the north, another trio of
Stanford orators will meet the Uni
versity of Southern California on a
Los Angeles platform.
Hold Filial Practices
Final practice debates are being
held at frequent intervals by the in
tercollegiate squad. On .Monday even
ing debating coaches K. E. Leib, '15,
and F. E. Hill, '11, will argue on the
affirmative against the University of
Southern California team. A few days
ago they opposed the affirmative ar
guments of the California trio, sup
porting the negative side of the ques
tion. The men are rapidly rounding
into the best of shape, according to
Leib.
Order of Speakers
Decision has been made as to the
order in which the individual speakers
on the two teams will appear. S. W.
Grathwell, transfer, will make the in
itial address against California. He
will be followed by .T. W. Fribley, '16,
and A. J. Hettinger, '16. Hettinger
will also deliver the final affirmative.
On the U. S. C. trio, the men will
speak in the following order: A. Mo
rosco, '16, M. L. McClintock, 'IS, and
M. Crobaugh, '18. McClintock wlil also
have charge of the rebuttal.
