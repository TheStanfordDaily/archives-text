## ELEVENTH HOUR LINE-SHIFT All-Blacks Vie With Palo Alto Aggregation—-Juvenile Match Arranged 
### 
Would-be dopesters, press pencil
pushers, and fans of all descriptions,
will be granted their last opportunity
tomorrow afternoon to witness the
Stanford varsity in action, when they
oppose the Winged "O" fifteen in the
final preliminary match of the season.
The All-Blacks are scheduled to meet
the fast Palo Alto Athletic Club as
the opener of the bill.
Juveniles Promise Amusement
What promises to be one of the
bright features of the rugby card will
be a mimic battle waged between the
Lytton Pewees and the Channing In
domitables during the first and sec
ond varsity intermission. No end of
amusement is sure to be derived by
the bleachers from this juvenile cham
pionship contest, since none of the
tads measure past the four-foot mark
or tip the scales ove.r ninety pounds.
Varsity Line-up Switched
In announcing the Cardinal line-up
for tomorrow's game, Coach Brown
makes an eleventh hour line-shift from
that used in any of the practice tan
jrlcic; +>!ia Thn front trio find
Knight, who is back in the game hav
ing recovered from an injury to his
knee, and Soper and Sample as hook
ers. Mloeser and Pettingill, a new
combination, form the middle berths.
Lock position is to be held down by
Rehm. The usual fast pair of break
aways, Braden and Wylie, complete
the scrum.
Erb is to act as pivot of the back
field at half. Five-eighths show a
Walker-Urban combination. Danny
Carroll stands out for center three
quarters. Left and right wings will
be occupied by Pelouze and Ric Tem
pleton, .respectively. Last defense
falls to the younger of the
brothers, Dink Templeton.
Tradition Continued
In opposing the Olympic Club to
morrow, a custom of the past few
years is being continued, since the
Winged "O" aggregation has closed
the Stanford preliminary season regu
larly in the past. Also Palmer Ful
ler, who will officiate as referee, has
held the whistle in the final practice
game of the varsity for several sea
sons. Forty-minute halves will be in
order.
All-lthicks Game Fast
When the All-Blacks line-up against
the Palo Alto Athletic Club, an even
contest should result as Floyd Brown
has assembled as powerful coterie of
second string players as has been seen
on the turf this fall. This game as
the curtain raiser will commence
promptly at two o'clock. Every one
is requested to be in the rooting sec
tion early since the yell leaders prom
ise a full day's work for the splinter
warmers.
