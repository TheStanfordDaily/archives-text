# The 						Last Chance
## 
### 
Tomorrow the varsity will make its
final practice appearance. Stanford
men and women will have a last op
portunity to pledge their support from
the bleachers in an unfaltering burst
of noise and song. Last evening the
members of many organizations on
the campus staged vocal programs
during the dinner hour and afterward.
All of us who tried, got a strangle
hold on the songs and yells that will
be a big part of our stock in trade
November 13.
Repeat the exercise tonight, show
«»ii jrnn'vo «-nt when the veil leaders
call on you tomorrow afternoon, and
keep up the good work all of next
week. Our supply of sideline ammu
nition is good, and our present duty
is to learn how to use it best. Pre
pare yourselves to come back at the
Santa Clara stands.
Enthusiasm for the rugby classic,
and loyalty to the team have roused
themselves to a strength that is able
to take hold of the coming game, and
to help win it. The rally last night
was whole souled and spontaneous.
Carry your enthusiasm over to the
game tomorrow and give it some disci
pline. All together. Telegraph re
ports of the Washington-California
game will be announced at the field.
Report for duty, and make the last
preliminary game a goer.
