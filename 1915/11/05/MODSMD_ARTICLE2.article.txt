# RALLY ROUTS CAMPUS QUIET
## Four Hundred Rooters Show that Big Game Spirit Abounds 
### 
"You fellows show this kind of pep
on the day of the Big Game and the
team will do the rest," were the words
of Captain Danny Carroll, following
the prolonged cheers and yells of some
four hundred Stanford .rooters who
gathered at the impromptu rally called
last night at the Sigma Alpha Epsllon
house by Yell Leader Johnny Good
man.
Captain Carroll's sentiments were
echoed by Soper, Pettingill, Erb, Wy
lie, Rehm, Swigart. Chandler, and
Hloeser, who were forcibly ejected
by enthusiastic .rooters from hiding
places in the training table house to
the rostrum on the front porch.
Captain Carroll was the first speak
er railed to the front. Danny ex
pressed his and the team's apprecia
tion of the noisy visit to the training
table quarters, and delivered a few
impressions .received as the result of
a day's visit in San Francisco with a
number of Santa Clara alumni and
students. The Cardinal skipper
summed his views up in the following
brief phrase: "They have the spirit,
fellows, and let's not be outdone."
