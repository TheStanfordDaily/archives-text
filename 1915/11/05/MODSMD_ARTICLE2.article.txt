# RALLY ROUTS CAMPUS QUIET
## Four Hundred Rooters Show that Big Game Spirit Abounds 
### 
"You fellows show this kind of pep
on the day of the Big Game and the
team will do the rest," were the words
of Captain Danny Carroll, following
the prolonged cheers and yells of some
four hundred Stanford .rooters who
gathered at the impromptu rally called
last night at the Sigma Alpha Epsllon
house by Yell Leader Johnny Good
man.
Captain Carroll's sentiments were
echoed by Soper, Pettingill, Erb, Wy
lie, Rehm, Swigart. Chandler, and
Hloeser, who were forcibly ejected
by enthusiastic .rooters from hiding
places in the training table house to
the rostrum on the front porch.
Captain Carroll was the first speak
er railed to the front. Danny ex
pressed his and the team's apprecia
tion of the noisy visit to the training
table quarters, and delivered a few
impressions .received as the result of
a day's visit in San Francisco with a
number of Santa Clara alumni and
students. The Cardinal skipper
summed his views up in the following
brief phrase: "They have the spirit,
fellows, and let's not be outdone."
Whereupon, four hundred fans j
stretched their lungs to full capacity
to show that they were not going to
he outdone, in noise at least.
Coach Floyd Brown gave a brisk
summary of the qualities of the two
teams, "There are not ten men in col
lege, not even 011 the team, who really
realise what opposition we are going
to have 011 the day of November 13,"
he said. "Hardly any one realizes
what a team it is that we must op
pose." Incidentally, the Coach
warned said four hundred rooters that
time to support the team from the
bleachers had long since arrived, and
that in spite of a poor beginning in
bleacher support, the student body
ought to fall in line for the final
stretch beginning with the game to
morrow with vim and pep of the
"good old days."
The rally was brought to a prema
ture end by failure of the rooters pres
ent to locate the .remainder ot' the
team, a number of the more modest
and bashful members having taken
refuge in the hills, according to re
ports circulated.
"Hail, Stanford, Hail." and "Var
sity" brought the evening's rally to a
fitting close.
