# Stanford's Stand in Break With California Upheld
## San Francisco Examiner Advises Arbitration of Difficulty 
### 
The following article in regard to !
the athletic situation of Stanford and j
California, and its effect on the ath
letics of the two universities is an
expression of editorial opinion from
the San Francisco Examiner. Inci
dentally the writer voices the view
which Stanford has held throughout
the trouble when it advises arbitra
tion of the difficulty.
"It must be evident to the students
of Stanford and the University of Cal
ifornia that the interest in their ath
letic events this year is languid to the
point of coma. This is an undesirable
contrast to the sharp and general at
tention all the contests received when
the two universities were contending,
one against the other.
"There was much stimulus for both
in the generous contests on track and
field and water. By not contending
each loses just that much stimulus,
which was felt in every department of
college life, causing better work and
higher ideals in scholarship as well i
as promoting clean living and benefi
cent care of the body.
"Now, do not the universities feel
that they owe something to the gen
eral public in this matter? They have
fallen out over athletic technicalities.
By doing so and severing athletic rela
tions they have robbed the public of
the pleasure of observing wholesome
and high-minded sport.
| "Can't the two great institutions be
| brought together again so they can
| resume their sports in a way to ele
vate all athletics? There cannot be
! such a wide difference of view that an
honorable compromise is impossible.
"Let The Examiner' suggest that
j the whole quarrel be taken right out of
i university control and submitted to
i a board of arbitration —a sort of Hague
peace tribunal. Let that board be
composed of three of the recognized
authorities on athletics of the West or
of the United States. Then have each
university present to the board its full
statement and make its complete ar
gument.
"And then let the decision of the
board—sure to be unbiased and im
partial—be conclusive on both uni
versities. Then we can have the
thrilling, man-making contests again
—and everybody will be happy."
