# STATISTICIAN TELLS BUSINESS THEORIES
## Frank H. Storm, Harvard Graduate, Addresses Economics Majors and Professors 
### 
Before an audience composed for
the most part of economics majors and
professors, Mr. Frank 14. Storm, Har
vard graduate, and representative of
Habsou's Statistical Organization of
Massachusetts, spoke this morning on
an interesting and beneficial stage of
Economics in regard to the conducting
of business, big and little, along lines
which are both safe and productive of
good results.
He stated that the law of action and
reaction could as easily be applied to
Economics as Mathematics, and used
this theory in showing that the times
of depression in this country have
always been followed by prosperous
business stretching over as large an
area. This theory is one that has
neither been proved or disproved but
which has worked out to a big success.
Mr. Storm claims that a business
man may regulate his business along
safe and sane lines if he pays partic
ular heed to the underlying causes of
depressions and rises which are con
stantly taking place in our country.
' The question is asked, 'How may a
business man conduct his business in
accordance with this theory?' The
reply is this: holding true to the the
ory that an area of prosperity is fol
lowed by one of depression, the expe
dient thing then is to buy over a
broad list, install new and up to date
equipment which is needed, buy in
large quantities whatever the article
is, and increase the overhead expenses
in preparation for the rise which is
certain to come.' Psychology is a very
potent factor in business. Men not
knowing these economic conditions
buy and equip a! tne wrong time,
generally at a period when an area
of prosperity has reached its climax.
They are lead to believe that this
prosperous condition is to last indefi
nitely."
Mr. Storm claims that the depression
which this country is in at the pres
ent time started in the latter part of
1913 and at the present time a period
of prosperity is about to be felt which
will be as large as the depression
which has just passed.
