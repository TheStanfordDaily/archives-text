# Rugby Semi-Finals Tomorrow
## 
### 
The semi-finals of the California In
terscholastic Federation in .rugby
football will be played tomorrow be
tween four prominent high schools.
Palo Alto will meet San Jose high in
their annual game, while Berkeley
high will play Alameda high, for the
right to meet the winner of the Palo
Alto-San Jose game.
The final contest will determine the
preparatory school championship, as
the southern schools are not playing
.rugby this year. From all appear
ances it would seem that Palo Alto
will mix with Herkeley in the last
rugby event.
