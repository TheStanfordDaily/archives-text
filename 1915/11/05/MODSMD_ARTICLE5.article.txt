Approximately two hundred rugby
players will be the guests of the Grad
uate Manager Saturday evening at the
monster outdoor barbecue to be
served on the baseball field at 5:30,

diamond after it was found that the
former place could not be secured for
the big outdoor feed.

ber of outside squads, all that have
been playing the varsity this year,
have been invited and it is the plan to
make the banquet the greatest affair
of its kind held this year. This is
the first time the rugby artists have
had a barbecue as guests of the Grad

team has enjoyed one for each of the
last several years.

nished by a number of Stanford's best
actors, including "Blondy" Paul,
