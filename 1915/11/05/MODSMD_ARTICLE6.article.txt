# OUTDOOR THEATER FOR STANFORD LOOKS PROBABLE
## COMMITTEE ARRANGE PLANS Scheme Will be Laid Before Board of Trustees at Next Meeting 
### 
An outdoor theatre for Stanford was
raised yesterday from a mere possi
bility to a probability when a commit
tee composed of representatives of
faculty and student organizations met
to discuss the question of such a
structure.
A committee was appointed to
choose a suitable site for an open-air
theatre and to consider a style of ar
chitecture for the structure. Esti
mates of the probable cost of several
styles of theatre will be submitted by
this committee to the Board of Trus
tees. Dr. Branner has expressed his
interest in the project and will pre
sent the idea at the next meeting of
the Trustees.
Location Suggested
A location just beyond the women's
boat house at Lagunita has been sug
gested. At this place the s age would
be just before the double row of pines
by the side of the lake and the seats
would be built up on the slope of the
hill behind. Other sites are under
discussion.
A second committee co-oposul...of
.1. R. Morgan, '16, W. G. Paul, '15, Miss
Margery Bailey, '14, and Professor L.
E. Bassett, chairman, has been ap
pointed to take charge of the question
of raising the funds which will be
necessary for the construction of the
theatre. The committee in charge of
finding the location and the style of
structure to be used, is as follows:
Professor W. H. Cairuth, G. A.
Hughes, '16, W. B. Curtis, '16, and Pro
fessor G. J. Peirce, chairman.
