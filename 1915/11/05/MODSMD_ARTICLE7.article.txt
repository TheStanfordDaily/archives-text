# Soccer Men to Meet Winged-0 Tomorrow for the Championship
## 
### 
Stanford will have two complete
soccer teams in the field tomorrow for
the first time in the history of the
sport on the campus. The varsity
team will meet the Olympic Club team
in the season's big game on the Stan
ford field at 3:30 o'clock, while the
Allies, composed entirely of Stanford
players, will meet the Marines in San
Francisco.
With the improbability of the series
of games with the University of Cali
fornia, the Olympic Club game prom
ises to be the last one of the season,
and upon its outcome depends the
leadership of the University and Club
Soccer League. Stanford, Berkeley,
and the Olympics are now tied for
first place, but inasmuch as the Olym
pics have defeated the California play
ers a win on the part of the Cardinal
team will win the championship and
the silver medals offered by the expo
sition. Owing to the injury to Plod,net
in the recent Marine game, the Stan
ford line-up will be broken up, and
considerable shifting of places has
been necessary.
The line-ups for the teams follow:
Stanford varsity—Ring, goal; Dutton
and Adams, fullbacks: Williams, Rey
nolds, Movie (captain), halfbacks;
McMahon, H. Henderson, Keste.r, S.
Adams, Ford, forwards. Allies —
Honey, uoal; Yuvell, Endersby, full
hacks; Alderton, Warren, halfbacks:
flertel (McClung), Kyle. Wing, Kist
ler, Srhnell, Ford, forwards.
