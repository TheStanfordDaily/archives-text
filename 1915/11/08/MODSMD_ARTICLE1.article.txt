# VARSITY HANDS DEFEAT OF 29 TO 11 TO WINGED 0
## GAME WAS BELOW STANDARD All-Blacks Lose to Palo Alto Club, 16 9—Baby Ruggers Delight Bleachers 
### 
In the season's final preliminary
match Saturday afternoon, the Stan
ford varsity compiled a 29 to 11 pack
age of football pills and handed them
personally to the white-clad Olympic
Club ruggers. The seeming lop-sided
count, however, may not be taken as
any basis for comparing the play of
the two fifteens. To even the division
of spoils, the AU-Blaks lost to a bet
ter team in the Palo Alto Athletic
Club 1G to . What was probably the
day's feature consisted of a battle
fought between a pair of diminutive
rugby squads, none of whom differed
much in size from the football.
The showing made by the varsity
Saturday was not quite up to expecta
tions. Numerous opportunities to an
nex trys were thrown away by fre
quent occurrence of knock-ons, for
ward passes, and general over-anxiety.
Tries Put Over l ast
The early minutes of the initial pe
riod showed even play. Finally the
varsity started the ball-a-rolling, the
half nearly a third over. Swigart re
ceived from Walker on the fifteen
yard mark, and then proceeded to
cloage and squirm his way ove.r the
opponents' line. Kic Templeton
missed a difficult angle. Braden
came right back with another try
after scooping the ball from the rear
of a five-yard ruck. Conversion re
sulted. The bell was rung again when
Templeton, "Braden, and Soper trans
ferred the elusive leather in that or
der, permitting Soper to fall across.
At this stage of the merriment, an
| Olympic try for a penalty field goal
| failed, but Lachmund paved the way
for a score immediately afterward.
After sprinting as if in the hundred
yard dash final heat, he passed to
Hawks who tallied the first Winged
"O" t.ry. Montgomery failed to get
the proper result from an opportunity
at conversion.
Even I'lay in Second Halt'
Carroll and Templeton opened the
second half by covering half the
length of the field, leaving play 011 the
five yard line. Here Johnson took
from the scrum and shot over. Tem
pleton converted a difficult trial eas
ily. Erb followed for Stanford with
a clever bit of rugby. Stringing his
backfleld out to the left for a passing
rush when on the forty-yard mark,
lie played the ball himself on the blind
side instead of the usual backfield
routine and went the entire distance
for a heady try.
At this point Stanford was granted
some excellent defensive practice, all
of which was not taken advantage of,
as both Milliken and Mehrtens sco.red
for the visitors. Montgomery con
verted the first of these two tries.
Stanford came back by raising her
total to twenty-four. Erb to Dieven
dorf to Johnson called for three
points. All credit for the final try
belongs to Halsted, who after cleverly
blocking a free kick, later registered
from a resulting five yard scrum.
All-(Slacks 011 Short End
The opening half of the Palo Alto
Athletic Club-All-Black match proved
close and interesting. Affairs started
auspiciously by having the ball travel
from Wilcox to Greve to Bacon and
finally to Wark, the wing finding a
hole. No conversion by West. Dutch
Rea followed suit for the opposition
from a scrum on the Cardinal line,
j Kirksey missed goal. Wallace then
| tallied for Stanford, which again went
j unconverted. Rogers closed the half
with a forty-yard run through a scat
tered field. The second period was a
Palo Alto Athletic Club rampage,
i Tries by Davidson and Stevens, plus a
j field goal raised their score to 19 to 6.

The early minutes of the initial pe
riod showed even play. Finally the
varsity started the ball-a-rolling, the
half nearly a third over. Swigart re
ceived from Walker on the fifteen
yard mark, and then proceeded to
cloage and squirm his way ove.r the
opponents' line. Kic Templeton
missed a difficult angle. Braden
came right back with another try
after scooping the ball from the rear
of a five-yard ruck. Conversion re
sulted. The bell was rung again when
Templeton, "Braden, and Soper trans
ferred the elusive leather in that or
der, permitting Soper to fall across.
At this stage of the merriment, an
| Olympic try for a penalty field goal
| failed, but Lachmund paved the way
for a score immediately afterward.
After sprinting as if in the hundred
yard dash final heat, he passed to
Hawks who tallied the first Winged
"O" t.ry. Montgomery failed to get
the proper result from an opportunity
at conversion.
Even I'lay in Second Halt'
Carroll and Templeton opened the
second half by covering half the
length of the field, leaving play 011 the
five yard line. Here Johnson took
from the scrum and shot over. Tem
pleton converted a difficult trial eas
ily. Erb followed for Stanford with
a clever bit of rugby. Stringing his
backfleld out to the left for a passing
rush when on the forty-yard mark,
lie played the ball himself on the blind
side instead of the usual backfield
routine and went the entire distance
for a heady try.
At this point Stanford was granted
some excellent defensive practice, all
of which was not taken advantage of,
as both Milliken and Mehrtens sco.red
for the visitors. Montgomery con
verted the first of these two tries.
Stanford came back by raising her
total to twenty-four. Erb to Dieven
dorf to Johnson called for three
points. All credit for the final try
belongs to Halsted, who after cleverly
blocking a free kick, later registered
from a resulting five yard scrum.
All-(Slacks 011 Short End
The opening half of the Palo Alto
Athletic Club-All-Black match proved
close and interesting. Affairs started
auspiciously by having the ball travel
from Wilcox to Greve to Bacon and
finally to Wark, the wing finding a
hole. No conversion by West. Dutch
Rea followed suit for the opposition
from a scrum on the Cardinal line,
j Kirksey missed goal. Wallace then

j unconverted. Rogers closed the half
with a forty-yard run through a scat

Palo Alto Athletic Club rampage,
i Tries by Davidson and Stevens, plus a

After sprinting as if in the hundred
yard dash final heat, he passed to
Hawks who tallied the first Winged
"O" t.ry. Montgomery failed to get
the proper result from an opportunity
at conversion.
Even I'lay in Second Halt'
Carroll and Templeton opened the
second half by covering half the
length of the field, leaving play 011 the
five yard line. Here Johnson took
from the scrum and shot over. Tem
pleton converted a difficult trial eas
ily. Erb followed for Stanford with
a clever bit of rugby. Stringing his
backfleld out to the left for a passing
rush when on the forty-yard mark,
lie played the ball himself on the blind
side instead of the usual backfield
routine and went the entire distance
for a heady try.
At this point Stanford was granted
some excellent defensive practice, all
of which was not taken advantage of,
as both Milliken and Mehrtens sco.red
for the visitors. Montgomery con
verted the first of these two tries.
Stanford came back by raising her
total to twenty-four. Erb to Dieven
dorf to Johnson called for three
points. All credit for the final try
belongs to Halsted, who after cleverly
blocking a free kick, later registered
from a resulting five yard scrum.
All-(Slacks 011 Short End
The opening half of the Palo Alto
Athletic Club-All-Black match proved
close and interesting. Affairs started
auspiciously by having the ball travel
from Wilcox to Greve to Bacon and
finally to Wark, the wing finding a
hole. No conversion by West. Dutch
Rea followed suit for the opposition
from a scrum on the Cardinal line,
j Kirksey missed goal. Wallace then
| tallied for Stanford, which again went
j unconverted. Rogers closed the half
with a forty-yard run through a scat
tered field. The second period was a
Palo Alto Athletic Club rampage,
i Tries by Davidson and Stevens, plus a
j field goal raised their score to 19 to 6.
