# SOPHOMORES SCORE IN PRESENTATION OF BOBBY BURNIT
## ACTING SAVES TRITE PLAY Davis Makes Winning Hero With Strong Support in Brown, Kneass and Wilkie 
### 
If the varsity scores as well on the
13th as the sophomores (lid on the stli
there will be no kicks as to the out
come of the Big Game. Seventeen
eighteeners kept things on the move
through the four periods of play in a
truly sophomoric and satisfactory
fashion. The bored theatre-goer may
say that the choice of play was not all
that it might have been, but at least
lie did not remember to make that ou
servation until he was well 011 his
way home and the Assembly Hall was
dark.
Granted that the characters and
situations we,re somewhat stereotyped,
spontaneity in acting made a success
of a play which would have proved
far less convincing and entertaining
011 the professional stage.
Hubby and Hi ft' Win Favor
In the title role, Gordon Davis was
as winning and earnest a Bobby as
you could find. As lie confidently in
formed us, he had a hand "with all
the trumps," and he proceeded to mis
play every card in his hand with a
boyish enthusiasm that was appalling.
Scarcely more engaging was the
Hobby of a year late r who had learned
the game and was getting the trick.,
he had lost before. Next to the lov
able Bobby in the hearts of the audi
ence Friday evening we must place
our joyous Biff. He was a good judge
of men, that Biff Bates, and he worked
for Bobby Burnit and for his lady love
with undaunted heart. Lawrence
Brown didn't act Biff Bates, he was
Biff Bates, and he buoyantly demon
strated that worthy's propensity to
come up smiling at every turn of late.
kueass Second to None
As sort of a good angel to that
precious pair we iind the dearest,
crustiest old man that ever lived for
a night 011 the Assembly Hall stase.
Ed Kneass did an unforgettable piece
of character work as old Daniel John
son. He was gruff; he was crabbed;
and he won our hearts. Enough. In
cidentally we might remember that il
was straight acting and good acting
that did this, for Kneass did not have
the aid of whiskers in which amateur
old men are wont to appear.
Another part which carried convic
tion despite the necessity of a slight
make-up that of Sam Stone in the
hands of Alfred Wilkie. He was the
epitome of political bossdom without
overdrawing the part at any point.
We knew he could lie well, but when
lie was telling the truth we believed.
Wilkie's hard man with a big heart
won our respect.
Villains Abound
Villains—straight villains — were
numerous Friday evening. Silas
Trimmer earned our scorn throughout
the play. Harry Buffum handled this
difficult impersonation admirably. His
voice was triumphantly squeaky. J. T.
Reynolds gave the role of the suave
Applerod all of its value. His one
object was to inspire a healthy dis
like, and he did it more than ade
quately. Dana Burks made the best
of the part of Smytlie, the man who
was too weak to be a good crook, and
with the heli) of the genial Biff put
over some excellent comedy. B. H.
Hearle as Har.ry Chalmers was grat
ifyingly breezy. Pete, the impish of
fie boy, was well done by R. J. Durney.
The women in "Bobby Burnit" were
not called upon for any acting. The
requirements of the play did not asK
them to go beyond the realms of look
ing charming, and in this they more
than succeeded. Misses Laura Ander
son, Florence Mason, and Dorothy Le
Seur all took .rather thankless parts
in a very pleasing manner.

the aid of whiskers in which amateur
old men are wont to appear.
Another part which carried convic
tion despite the necessity of a slight
make-up that of Sam Stone in the
hands of Alfred Wilkie. He was the
epitome of political bossdom without
overdrawing the part at any point.
We knew he could lie well, but when
lie was telling the truth we believed.
Wilkie's hard man with a big heart
won our respect.
Villains Abound
Villains—straight villains — were
numerous Friday evening. Silas
Trimmer earned our scorn throughout
the play. Harry Buffum handled this
difficult impersonation admirably. His
voice was triumphantly squeaky. J. T.
Reynolds gave the role of the suave
Applerod all of its value. His one
object was to inspire a healthy dis
like, and he did it more than ade
quately. Dana Burks made the best
of the part of Smytlie, the man who
was too weak to be a good crook, and
with the heli) of the genial Biff put
over some excellent comedy. B. H.
Hearle as Har.ry Chalmers was grat
ifyingly breezy. Pete, the impish of
fie boy, was well done by R. J. Durney.
The women in "Bobby Burnit" were
not called upon for any acting. The
requirements of the play did not asK
them to go beyond the realms of look
ing charming, and in this they more
than succeeded. Misses Laura Ander
son, Florence Mason, and Dorothy Le
Seur all took .rather thankless parts
in a very pleasing manner.
If the varsity scores as well on the
13th as the sophomores (lid on the stli
there will be no kicks as to the out
come of the Big Game. Seventeen
eighteeners kept things on the move
through the four periods of play in a
truly sophomoric and satisfactory
fashion. The bored theatre-goer may
say that the choice of play was not all
that it might have been, but at least
lie did not remember to make that ou
servation until he was well 011 his
way home and the Assembly Hall was
dark.
Granted that the characters and
situations we,re somewhat stereotyped,
spontaneity in acting made a success
of a play which would have proved
far less convincing and entertaining
011 the professional stage.
Hubby and Hi ft' Win Favor
In the title role, Gordon Davis was
as winning and earnest a Bobby as
you could find. As lie confidently in
formed us, he had a hand "with all
the trumps," and he proceeded to mis
play every card in his hand with a
boyish enthusiasm that was appalling.
Scarcely more engaging was the
Hobby of a year late r who had learned
the game and was getting the trick.,
he had lost before. Next to the lov
able Bobby in the hearts of the audi
ence Friday evening we must place
our joyous Biff. He was a good judge
of men, that Biff Bates, and he worked
for Bobby Burnit and for his lady love
with undaunted heart. Lawrence
Brown didn't act Biff Bates, he was
Biff Bates, and he buoyantly demon
strated that worthy's propensity to
come up smiling at every turn of late.
kueass Second to None
As sort of a good angel to that
precious pair we iind the dearest,
crustiest old man that ever lived for
a night 011 the Assembly Hall stase.
Ed Kneass did an unforgettable piece
of character work as old Daniel John
son. He was gruff; he was crabbed;
and he won our hearts. Enough. In
cidentally we might remember that il
was straight acting and good acting
that did this, for Kneass did not have
the aid of whiskers in which amateur
old men are wont to appear.
