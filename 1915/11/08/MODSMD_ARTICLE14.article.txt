# "These College Boys"
## 
### 
Unseemly tales were alloat on the
campus today, to the effect that some
zealous Stanford students last night
streaked the mission church at Santa
Clara with lurid slogans of battle and
brag. We were pleased, and .relieved
from premature blushes of shame
when Father Thornton, president of
the neighboring university, discredit
ed the rumors. So far as we are able
to believe, the exchange of hostilities
down to date is no more than a prank
ish acknowledgment that the students
at Santa Clara and at Stanford are
putting on their war paint.
The moralist always has a come
back. If people insist on getting into
trouble face of his advice, he
* old you so." If nothing
; r ml:>- goes wrong, but he
v : ii: . noise anyway, he cau
. ;..y * i iuteV nave been." And there
is uisuineiii. We adopt the sec
ond method of displaying superior
wisdom.
Hard as it is to believe, some fervid
but misguided supporters of the Car
dinal might have taken it into their
heads to paint the Santa Clara church,
or chop down a few trees, or some
thing of that sort. And none of us,
in our sane moments, would want to
answer for them. There is a great
difference between the licensed bub
bles of enthusiasm known as "rah
rah stuff," and vandalism.
In closing, there are a few scraps of
advice which we distribute gratis. To
those members of the community who
have it in mind to spread fear and
wisdom among the heathen who live
down the valley, we recommend cau
tion, and good judgment. And the
freshman guard might keep closer
tab on the wood pile every day, and
at all hours between now and Thurs
day night.
