The place is the Farm, and the time
Sunday evening. Si Halingwire and
his wife, Sciatica, meet on the rear
veranda.
Scia—Howdy, Si. Say, what do I
see a-prowling aroun' that there barn
—another one of them thieving crit
ters?
Si —Them's special de-tecters ahired
to keep an eye on the barn. I don't
want nuthin' more stole.
Scia—You poor fish! The horse
was stole last night, and there ain't
nothin' more to take but the old jin
ricky, an' a sack of barley, an' some
old shoes.
Si —I 'llow that's true enuf in its
way, Scia, my gal, but when an only
horse is stole I take no more chances.
T hired two Pinkhamtons.
Scia —Expensive, T reckon?
Si—Let that be what it may. An'
I bought two new locks fo.r each door.
There's bars across all the winders
now. An' old Tom Edison over to Mc
carty's a-wired an autermatic alarum
which when even a spider crawls
within a radius of a mile will arouse
the hull town. Them detecters is aw
lus on the job—there ain't goin' to be
no horse stole ternight.
Scia—You poo.r pescadero! There
ain't no horse to be stole!
Si —Be that as it may be. Remem
ber what Bill vEsop said —a horse in
the barn is worth two on a bush.
Scia—You should have had your
Pinkhamtons last night.
Si —None o' yer T-told-yer-so's.
Scia —Come in the house, old man,
and I'll sing you that new ditty I
wrote, entitled: An ounce of preven
tion is worth a gallon of fire extin
guisher.
