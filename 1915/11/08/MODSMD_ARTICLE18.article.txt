# TO RUSH WORK ON BONFIRE
## Freshmen to Continue Construction Rain or Shine Until Pyre Is Completed 
### 
"From now until we have completed
the bonfire, work will be rushed from
morning to night, rain or shine," said
Construction Chief Derby today. "In
order to complete the pyre on time it
will be necessary for all freshmen to
report every afternoon and as often
as possible during the morning hours.
We will not stop work because of
rain."
The blaze of yesterday did not ma
terially damage the pyre. The big
work now remaining is that of gath
ering additional material and filling
in the structure.
