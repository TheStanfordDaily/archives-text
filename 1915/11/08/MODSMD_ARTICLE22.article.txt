being played in San Francisco. The
scores of the sets were 6-1, 6-3, 3-6,
6-1. Johns has on all previous occa
sions more than held his own with

seemed to be Halm's day. He played

Johns Defeats Champion
The whole tennis world was aroused
at the news of the defeat of William
Johnson, the national champion, by
IT. V. Johns, '18, and then again when
H. L. Hahn, '16, put Clarence Griffin,
the western champion and joint hold
er of the national doubles champion
ship, out of the running. Both match
es were of a sensational character,
the play between Johns and Johnston
being the best that San Francisco has
seen since the national championships
were held at the exposition. The
set scores tell a clear story, 4-6, 6-4,
6-3, 4-0, S-6. The match between Hahn
and Griffin was excellent as a tennis
exhibition. The scores of the sets
were 4-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3.
Stanford, except for the work of R.
L. Murray, has never been known as
an institution where tennis champions
were trained. Johns was not accord
ed a chance by the experts, and Tlalin
was conceded only an outside chance
against Griffin. Alia Barber, '18, and
IT. L. Hahn, '16, will meet Johnston
and Griffin, the national doubles
champions, in the Pacific Coast finals
this afternoon.
