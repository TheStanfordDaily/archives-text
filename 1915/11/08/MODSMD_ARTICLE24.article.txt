The Stanford Tnsurrectos, an inde
pendent baseball team made up of
Stanford students, lost a rather poor
ly played game to the strong hospital
nine at Agnews, by a 12 to 2 score
yesterday. The Insurrectos nine was
considerably weakened by the absence
of several strong players. Wicker
sham pitched a fairly good game for
the losers, but received poor support.
The Agnew team were helped by the
addition of two Coast Leaguers to
their line-up. Hildebrand called the
balls and strikes.
