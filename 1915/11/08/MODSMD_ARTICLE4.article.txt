# Santa Clara Tries To Send Stanford Win Up in Smoke
## 
### 
Athletic rivalry and rugby enthu
siasm were fanned to actual fire and
color Sunday by two warlike invasions
of rival camps, when the bonfire was
initiated with an impromptu blaze,
and the Santa Clara campus awoke
yesterday morning blushing under an
unauthorized coat of ,red paint.
A squad of local rooters visited the
Santa Clara campus under the cover
of darkness and carefully and leisure
ly decorated the Mission campus with
a bright and thick cardinal coat of
color. Not to be outdone, a half dozen
Santa Clara students secured a high
power automobile and visited the Stan
ford campus yesterday afternoon.
Their visit almost cause;l freshmen
and others to bid farewell to pros
pects of the annual bonfire for Thurs
day evening.
Posed As Sightseers
Finding a group of freshmen on
guard, the incendiaries posed as sight
seers from the city, and asked stu
dents for information .regarding Stan
ford. About five o'clock, finding that
the first year men had deserted the ; r
posts visitors motored to Encina Hall,
back past the bonfire, heaved a lighted
fagot into the pyre, and dashed off
! past the Quad toward Palo Alto.
They were chased by men playing ten
nis in front of Encina, who were un
able to head the machine off, and by
one other student on a motorcycle.
Hoses were rushed to the field and
brought into play and the fire was
headed off before it gained much bead
way, though for a time the pyre
! looked doomed.
Reports give evidence that the fire
bugs made their way toward San Jose
in short order, after the general
alarm which awakened the sleeping
Farm. As the result of the activity on
both sides, and the "warlike rivalrv
manifest from the camp "to the south,
freshmen have doubled their guards
all over the campus.
