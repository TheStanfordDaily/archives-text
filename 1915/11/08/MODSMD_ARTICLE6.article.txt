P. R. Wilson, 'in. president
of t lie Associated Students, ex
pressed himself today concerning
pre-game rivalry between Stanford
and Santa Clara as follows:
"We don't want to put a damper
on the enthusiasm that is being
brought about at both institutions
by the nearness of the T?ig Game.
Excursions to Santa Clara are all
right. A little red paint does no
harm â€”if it is applied at the right
time and in the proper places.
There should be no painting of uni
versity buildings and university
property, or other acts which would
merit, the term 'vandalism.'"
