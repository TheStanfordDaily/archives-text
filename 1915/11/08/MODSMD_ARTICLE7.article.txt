### 
Stanford students, alumni, and
friends will gather at the Palace Hotel
Saturday evening to celebrate the re
sult of the contest, whatever it be,
with a dinner, dance, and cabaret, as
the result of arrangements completed
this afternoon between Graduate Man
ager Behrens for Stanford and the
managers of the Palace.
Festivities at the Palace will begin
promptly at seven o'clock with the
dinner. The cabaret will be included
with this important feature. Stunts
will be supplied by both local and San
Francisco theatrical talent. Accord
ing to Manager Behrens, it will be
one of the best aggregations of enter
tainers that Stanford students have
secured for one evening's fun.
Dance Follows Dinner
The Big Game dance will follow af
ter the dinner in the ball room of the
Palace. Lively music will add to the
spirit of the occasion, and it is prom
ised that this new feature of the Big
Game celebration will be one of the
most popular innovations in this year's
program of original Big Game extras.
By special arrangement with the
n aaageio Oi Lh>â€¢ t >ji"duuciiu
Manager Behrens has been able to se
cure the moderate price of a dollar
and fifty cents per student for this un
usual evening's entertainment. This
includes the dinner at the Palace,
which is promised to be up to the
usual standard set by that popular
hotel.
Tickets for the dinner, cabaret, and
dance must be purchased at the Grad
uate Manager's office in the Union
building between tomorrow and next
Friday evening, if reservations are to
be made.
The change from the annual Bis
Game theater to the dinner and ball
is expected to prove a popular one,
as it offers more opportunity for life
and good fellowship by every one
present. Queening is to be in order,
and provision will be made to care
for the women of the university.

McLaclilan, '17, and Phil Solon,
