# Washington Varsity Puts a Twist in Tail Of Golden Bear, 72-0
## 
### 
Overwhelmed b> team work and han
dicapped by an absolute lack of knowl
edge of defensive tactics, California's
varsity was whitewashed by the Uni
versity of Washington Saturday, to
the tune of seventy-two to nothing.
After the whistle blew in the first
quarter, Washington took the ball,
after running it well up the field, and
started a triumphal procession which
was checked but few times during the
entire game.
As soon as the Washington men
saw that California had no idea of a
defense, straight line bucks were em
ployed. They only failed to make
their yards a few times and then on
forward passes.
California is playing the type of
football that was invented by Stagg
of Chicago some five years ago and
has been practically discarded by all
coaches. The scheme provides for re
peated line shifts to make interfer
ence for the man who carries the ball.
Tliis formation is easy to break up
when it is used more than a few times
in the course of a game.
Rugby tactics cropped up on the
California side repeatedly. They could
not tackle a man and keep him down.
When a California man would be about
to tackle lie would invariably slow up
as though he were going to pass.
Antiquated formations, an idea that
the proper place to tackle was above
the midriff and a lack of faculty to
lyoak up interference caused the score
to pile up rapidly. In the last quarter
Coach Dobie had almost his entire
second string on the field. Had Cali
fornia played the second team instead
of the Washington Varsity, the score
would have been nearly the same.
