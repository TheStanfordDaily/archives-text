# CHAPPIE TURNED LOOSE ON QUADRANGLE TOMORROW
## BIG GAME IS IN LIMELIGHT Everyone Will Have to Cease Study to Laugh at Jovial Jester 
### 
Chaparral's Big Game number will
be turned loose tomorrow. With these
few words the .reader should seek se
clusion and enter into convulsions of
laughter. Chappie's expedition down
the Quad will be the signal for all
university work to cease; everybody
from Harry the .lap down to the High
Lord of the Admiralty will be reading
the November issue of the comic. For
the jovial jester has something up his
sleeve besides his vaccination mark,
his elbow —and his funny-bone.
Hidden behind a brilliant rugby
cover, the work of Paul Rockwood,
'19, and smuggled between a hundred
or so of jokes and short verse, are
pages of art work of the usual alti
tudinous standard. F. S. Murray, '15,
starts things moving with his second
Snoppyquop, which if laugh-producing
finalities can be taken as the basis of
judgment, deserves its full page posi
tion. Walter Gores, '17, is the name
under a page drawing which should
make both sexes sigh with envy. A
full page of delightfully original
rugby cartoons by Miss Ruth Taylor,
'Ift, holds the limelight in the center
of the book.
Chappie revives an old custom to
morrow with a red-hot echo of Sword
and Sandal's offering of "Stop Thief."
Editor Levy in his "Now Thats"
takes a slant at Saturday's classic,
voicing a plea to leave the frame
work of the Palace intact after the
fray; extends a big glad-hand to Ray
Lyman Wilbur, and registers a mo
tion to put journalism on a sounder
basis on the Farm. The Plug Ugly
also comes in for a share of editorial
attention.
Those who augment the staff in
completing the Gig Game number are;
Miss M. Bailey, '14, R. V. Higgins, '16,
R. A. Donaldson, '17, B. V. Curler, '17,
H. Eickhoff, '18, F. J. Taylor, '18, J. C.
Kerr, '18, 13. C. Wohlford, '18, A. D.
Wilkie. '18, N. H. Stearn, '18, P. C.
Rockwood, '19, Miss Ruth Taylor, '19,
