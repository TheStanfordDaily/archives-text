# Battle of Wits
## 
### 
Goninum y Interest and thought at
Stanford are criss-crossed and dis
tracted by an awesome number of or
ganizations. All of them, with their
blazoned and bejewelled tokens, fall
readily into the good, bad, and indif
ferent category.
* * Ht *
We make 110 attempt to throw a
spotlight on the various ins and outs
which serve as load-stones for stu
dent activity, or to label them accord
ing to their merits. The only con
clusion we seek is that for most of
us, the day's work is a jumble, and
that we trail about the campus with
our noses close to the ground.
* * * *
There are so many roll calls to an
swer during the week, and so many
things that have to be done as a mat
ter of obligation to different societies
that very few of us have time even
to wonder what it is all about. In
dividual desires and promptings tend
to be squelched by the routine that
must he followed "just because."
* * * *
Strange though it may be, this is
an editorial boost for the intercolle
giate debate which will be held next
Friday evening in San Francisco. De
bating is one of the sorts of under
graduate enthusiasm which has to
flutter on cropped wings at Stanford.
Everybody is apologetic, and ready to
admit that it is a sorry and unholy
truth. Yet the active few continue to
prate their forensic wares to empty
seats, for the reason that the rest of
us haven't time to be bothered.
* * * *
The clash of wits between the men
of California and Stanford this week
will have a good setting in the Girls'
high school. Plenty of room. Berke
ley students will be there aplenty.
They always are. Uncultured heathen
of the Bay cities will say "this should
be worth hearing," and numbers of
them will attend. We hope to be there
in company with others from the
Farm. The date is a convenient one,
and the opportunity is a real one,
and none of us need have any campus
cares 011 our minds.
# # * *
Because there will be some good
brain fodder and some big men pres
ent, and things like that help to purify
the soul.
