# Assent to Assist Costs Allen Fifteen

Deing sophomore president is a
fierce job.
Niel R. Allen, '18, says so. He ought
to know.
Here's Allen's latest woe. ft came
by mail.
November 4, 1915.
Dea.r Mr. Allen. â€”Did you know
that since you asked the girls to
be on the sopliomo.re Cotillion com
mittee, that you are to see that
everyone of them goes? Perhaps
you know it and so it is of no use
to tell you, but 1 heard indirectly
that so far none of the girls were
Koins;, and were wondering if they
were. I suppose that it is no busi
ness of mine to be telling a presi
dent what lie is to do and what not;
1 only want to lie sure that you
know about it and that you will see
that they will go.
A. STUDENT.
Allen says he didn't know his duty.
He does now. There are three girls
on the sophomore Cotillion commit
tee. It costs about two-and-a-half a
head to queen to the Cotillion: at
that rate Allen is in for about fifteen
seeds if he does his duty, and pays
the bills like a sport.
