# Painty Invaders Are Unavoidably Detained at S.C.
## 
### 
According to advice received late
this afternoon the four Stanford
men who were detained at Santa
Clara last night, were turned loose
at 1 o'clock today. The men are
all in good shape, but report a very
interesting story. A number of
moving picture firms had men on
hand for the occasion including the
Pathe Weekly.' Films were taken
of the Stanford men scrubbing the
large block "S's" from the walks
and fences, and the men were pho
tographed after the Santa Clara
barber had shaved their heads in
various fashions to suit the Mission
town students. Other than this the
boys report a royal reception.
They were fed in great style, and
the prominent men of the univer
sity all came around to shake
hands with them.

Somewhere in Encina Hall this
morning, three alarm clocks tatooed
thei.r usual call at seven. But no kind
hand reached out to still the consid

on the Santa Clara campus today
three sons of Stanford Red are en
gaged in eradidcating from the ways
and byways of the Mission college
the very same paint that was applied
in goodly quantities the night before.
Dame Rumor arose early today and
ran around wildly tearing lie.r hair,
shrieking a chant of hate. She could
not be stilled sufficiently to give out
very liable information. But between
gasps Dame Rumor declared as fol
lows:
"Six Stanford men invaded the
Santa Clara campus fast night intent
on hoisting the Cardinal above the
Mission Hag. The knightly and night
ly adventurers ran into an ambush:
a fight ensued, â€”and as a result J. M.
Quinby, '18, B. T. Millard, '17,
V. E. Haley, '18, and W. F. Bur
bank, '16, are held for ransom,
F. Burbank, '16. are held for ransom,
interned in a Santa Clara domicile
when not engaged inartistic endea
vors on sidewalk and wall. P. H.
Hear.le, '18, escaped after a close
shave and a hair-raising experience.
Verily, 'tis said Hearle will have to
see Charley Meyer in order to have
the impromptu hair cut improved for
exhibition purposes. R. B. Carter, '18,
also made a successful get-away.
Today Santa Clara genius suggest
ed that the Cardinal invaders white
