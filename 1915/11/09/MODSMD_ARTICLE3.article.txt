# Painty Invaders Are Unavoidably Detained at S.C.
## 
### 
According to advice received late
this afternoon the four Stanford
men who were detained at Santa
Clara last night, were turned loose
at 1 o'clock today. The men are
all in good shape, but report a very
interesting story. A number of
moving picture firms had men on
hand for the occasion including the
Pathe Weekly.' Films were taken
of the Stanford men scrubbing the
large block "S's" from the walks
and fences, and the men were pho
tographed after the Santa Clara
barber had shaved their heads in
various fashions to suit the Mission
town students. Other than this the
boys report a royal reception.
They were fed in great style, and
the prominent men of the univer
sity all came around to shake
hands with them.

Somewhere in Encina Hall this
morning, three alarm clocks tatooed
thei.r usual call at seven. But no kind
hand reached out to still the consid
erate voice of Big Ben. Somewhere
on the Santa Clara campus today
three sons of Stanford Red are en
gaged in eradidcating from the ways
and byways of the Mission college
the very same paint that was applied
in goodly quantities the night before.
Dame Rumor arose early today and
ran around wildly tearing lie.r hair,
shrieking a chant of hate. She could
not be stilled sufficiently to give out
very liable information. But between
gasps Dame Rumor declared as fol
lows:
"Six Stanford men invaded the
Santa Clara campus fast night intent
on hoisting the Cardinal above the
Mission Hag. The knightly and night
ly adventurers ran into an ambush:
a fight ensued, —and as a result J. M.
Quinby, '18, B. T. Millard, '17,
V. E. Haley, '18, and W. F. Bur
bank, '16, are held for ransom,
F. Burbank, '16. are held for ransom,
interned in a Santa Clara domicile
when not engaged inartistic endea
vors on sidewalk and wall. P. H.
Hear.le, '18, escaped after a close
shave and a hair-raising experience.
Verily, 'tis said Hearle will have to
see Charley Meyer in order to have
the impromptu hair cut improved for
exhibition purposes. R. B. Carter, '18,
also made a successful get-away.
Today Santa Clara genius suggest
ed that the Cardinal invaders white
wash fences for the benefit of a mov
ing picture camera.
This morning a telephone message
to Graduate Manager Behrens re
quested that a mob of Stanford men
"attempt a rescue of the captives, for
moving pictures." Behrens replied
that lie appreciated the opportunity,
and admired the nerve of the southern
college, but that he couldn't see the
idea for dust—or was there another
reason?
Father White, Athletic Moderator,
assured Behrens that the Cardinals
will be released in time for the Big
Came. Which is an encouraging bit
of information.
Santa Clara Writes
The Daily Palo Alto today received
the following self-explanatory letter,
dated November 7, from members of
the Santa Clara student body:
"Last night, or rathe.r, early this
morning, the students of Santa Clara
royally welcomed their fellow-colle
gians from Stanford. You see, it was
this way. Santa Clara always keeps
open house, so in the wee hours of the
morning, Sunday morning at that, sev
eral Stanford students paid us an in
formal visit. But it so happened that
we all were not in a fit condition to
receive them. You know, we are
taught here that one should not re
ceive visitors while garbed in pajamas
only. So we were forced to forego the
pleasure of their company, and told
the servant to have them leave their
cards.
The Kuiiiiy Part of It
The funny part of it was that our
Stanford callers had forgotten to bring
their cards with them. So they de
cided to print some, and set at it with
a will. When we arose this morning
at 6:30, we found the Stanford cards
painted in rod all over our side-walks,
on the steps of the Administration
Building, on a tree in front of the
Chapel, on the grand-stand, the goal
posts, and over the little hole in the
wall where spectators of games are
relieved of a little round silver piece
before occupying a place on the rick
ety bleachers. And just think! They
used two cans of perfectly good red
paint."
