The California varsity is playing
Schaeffer's game this season, and
Stanford is playing rugby, and things
are looking up. We saw it by the pa
pers. Alumni of the Herkeley insti
tution, the press, and followers of
spo.rt up and down the coast are
clamoring for a splurge of undergrad
uate independence and intelligence,
and a return to the old basis of inter
collegiate competition.

Love-taps have been directed in
various degrees of disgust, sorrow,
and rebellion at the sick semblance of
sport which was foisted on the bleach
ers last Saturday when Washington
vrjtrliril the Blue and Gold.

3 fog of lies, effrontery,
ed bludgeoning with
which the Inner Precinct across the
bay has shielded its manipulations, is
lifting itself high above the Herkeley
hills. Stanford is not alone in think
ing that the California student body
and the Blue and Gold varsity have
better duties than to serve longer as
a meal ticket for one whose foibles
ate rancid.
* * * *
Not until the product of his labor
was laid blushing and bare last Satur
day have sports enthusiasts realized
that one man, aided by his henchmen,
has been able to distort the vision of
the public eye as Schaeffer has done
at California. Surrounded by his con
fidantes, he has nurtured diplomatic
trickery, soft-pedaled student opinion,
and kept, his job.

With Stanford, the critical period is
passed this season. We have found a
worthy rival, and we have a sports
man's game, played in the open, by
fifteen men, —not by one. California's
test lias not yet come. If she play's
the "old game" next year, there will
be no confidence, no enthusiasm, no
hope of victory. This first season
the game has been a novelty, and it
has been cuddled by excited conjec
ture. Next year it will be what it
must be under Schaeffer's tutelage,—
a fiasco. We say amen to the plea for
an honorable desire of Stanford and
California to patch up differences.
