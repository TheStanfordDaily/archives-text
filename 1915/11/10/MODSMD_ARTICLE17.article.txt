# To Bonfire Guardians
## 
### 
The attention of bonfire guar
dians is called to the university
regulation prohibiting the bringing
of intoxicating liquor in the univer
sity community, and drunkenness
either in the university community
or elsewhere. Pre-game excite
ment and the exigencies of cam
pus watching in no way afford ex
cuse for violation of this .rule. The
Student Council is pledged to main
tenance of the regulation. Such a
time of pressure as that of the
present must tighten rather than
loosen the hold of the students on
their self-government.

Student Adviser.

G. A. JACOMINI,
