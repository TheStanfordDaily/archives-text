# STUDENT VOLUNTEER CONVENTION PLANNED

### 
Students are invited to attend the
sessions of the second annual con
ference of the Intercollegiate Student
Volunteers Association of Northern
California. Meetings will be held in
Berkeley next Saturday and Sunday,
Nov. 13 and 14. The first conference
was held at Stanford last spring and
some good results were obtained.
More results are looked for from this
conference. A large delegation is
wanted to represent Stanford Univer
sity. Those students desiring de
tailed information may call up Miss
Eileen Everett at the Women's Club
house; Mr. J. B. Watson, at the Y. M.

Apts., Palo Alto, telephone I J . A. 488 K.
The Student Volunteers has been
called the largest fraternity in the
world. It has grown from the now
historical "Haystack meeting" where
four students at Williams, taking
refuge from a storm under the shelter
of a haystack, made it their life pur
pose to win the world fo.r Christianity
and civilization.
The formal organization was effect
ed by Dwight L. Moody in 1886. It has
since spread all over the world, and
has sent seven thousand members
abroad. Five thousand members at
tended the seventh quadrennial con
vention held in Kansas City two years
ago.
Those at Stanford and other col
leges interested in this work are in
vited to attend the conference at
Berkeley. Among the speakers will
be Dr. Bell, Bishop McDowell, Dr. Pa
delford, Mr. Donohugh, and Bishop
Stuntz, formerly of India and now
representing South America at this
gathering.
