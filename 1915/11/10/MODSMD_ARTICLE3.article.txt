# NEVER AGAIN!
## Is Sentiment of Cardinals Captured in Santa Claran Ambush 
### 
If you talk with P. H. Hearle, '18,
or B. T. Millard, '17, you will learn
more about Santa Clara than you ever
hoped to know —or hope to learn by
experience. Hearle and Millard spent
12 hours *s the honored guests of the
missionites. Hearle declares that the
dormitories of the southern school can
be emptied of their human contents —
fully armed, ready for battle —in the
amazing time of 28 seconds.
"Where you goin', gents?" said
Santa Clara.
"Oh, just lookin' around," replied
Stanford.
"Guess you'd better let us show
you," said the missioners.
The six sons of the Cardinal saw
sixty of the enemy, and agreed with
Santa Claran sentiment. Millard says
the Palo Alto gang might have run
like sixty, but sixty mo.re were ready.
Contrary to yesterday's reports, the
Stanford captives were not required
to eradicate carmine pigment f.rom the
ways and by-ways of Santa Clara.
"They were proud of the paint,"
said one of the raiders. "I never saw
as many cameras in my life as were
flashed on us down there. All the
scrubbing was faked. They asked us
how California used to handle cap
tives. We said we were always treat
ed O. K. And we were then treated
that way down the.ve."
The barber shop in the mission town
was deserving of moving picture
limelight. With a ten-foot. Stanford
banner for a barber-cloth, horse
clippers were applied in a manner not
passed by the National Board of Land
scape Gardeners.
