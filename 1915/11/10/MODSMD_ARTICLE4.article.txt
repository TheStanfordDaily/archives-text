# TO DANCE AT WAKE OF SANTA CLARA
## Dinner, Cabaret and Dance Will Entertain Local Contingent Saturday Evening 
### 
With the last strains of "Hail,
Stanford, Hail," next Saturday after
noon on Ewing field, .Cardinal rooters
will begin a general exodus from the
scene of the big fray to the Palace
Hotel, where managers, waiters,
clerks, bell-boys, and everyone con
nected witli the big establishment will
unite to make the Stanford people feel
at home for the rest of the evening.
Tt. is thought that this evening at the
Palace will prove infinitely more pop
ular than the football show of old, and
that ample opportunity for everyone
to enjoy a lively and fitting aftermath
will be eagerly embraced by all who
are within reasonable reach of the
Palace Hotel. Roth men and women
are expected to make the Palace Ho
tel their headquarters while in the
city, as the result of special offers
made to the student body of the col
lege through Graduate Manager Beh
rens by the managers of the popular
hostlery.
Because the Graduate Manager has
assured the Palace an attendance of
at least three hundred and fifty peo
ple at the dinner in the evening, stu
dents who expect to take advantage
of the dollar-fifty rate for the even
ing's enjoyment, including dinner, are
requested to make reservations at
once. Tickets are on sale at the Grad
uate Manager's office, and will be sent
to the fraternity and sorority houses
before the end of the week.
