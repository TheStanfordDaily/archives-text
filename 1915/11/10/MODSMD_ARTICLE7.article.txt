# Dissatisfaction Felt By Old Californian
## That the Rival Institutions Will Heal Breach Is Big Hope 
### 
The disastrous defeat and lack of
enthusiasm of the California-Washing
ton game last Saturday has brought
to light a sentiment which has lain
dormant in the breast of many of the
numerous alumni of the state insti
tution and which needed onlv the
J
| least spark to set it aflame. That
j their alma mater should be cheapened
I by the withdrawal of the captain when
he was uninjured, by the sending in of
all of the substitutes, the pathetic ef
fort of a team which was struggling
hopelessly without a knowledge of the
rudiments of the game, is something
that sticks.

"I never felt so sorry for anyone as
' I did for those game, untaught kids
|on the field last Saturday,' says
' Robert Roos, a University of
j California alumnus and a former
i player on the varsity team,
j "Every lover of sport, every lover of
i California, and every Stanford man
! would like to see the athletic relations
between California and Stanford ,re
| siiraed. In a word, there is a crying
need for a change in the system that
controls athletic relations at the uni
j versity. President Wheeler has grant
j ed student control, therefore the stu
dents themselves must set things
! right."
Douglas Erskine, the sporting edi
j tor of the San Francisco Examiner,
sums a grievance up as follows.
! "First and foremost the University of
I California and Stanford should get
together and sinking all petty dif
, ferer"es .''frnnv 1 relation; in all
branches of sport. Give the students
j back their old 'Big Game,' their base
i ball series, their boat race, in fact all
: branches of sport. Give the public the
joy of these struggles, which they
have nobly supported for twenty-three
years."
