# Stanford Relies On Her Superior Offense

### Captain George Montgomery of the Olympics Capt. George G. Montgomery 
That the rugby fans of this state
will be given the privilege of viewing
a wonderful exhibition of the same
when Stanford and Santa Clara "lock
horns" is conceded by everyone who
has in any wise kept in touch with the
rugby situation this year. There is
is just enough difference between the
methods of play adopted by the two
varsities to add spice to the contest
and a strong element of uncertainty
to the result.
IMay Good Rugby
Floyd Brown has developed this
year a team which I believe to be the
finest attacking aggregation in the his
tory of Pacific Coast rugby. Minus,
perhaps, some of the individual stars
of years gone by, the Stanford players
are working together and for one an
other in a manner which only real
rugby can produce. The forwards are
strong, fast and have acquired the art
of passing the ball and feeding the
backs in a manner which is most be
wildering to all opposition. The
backs, with their individual speed and
fine team work, are well able to take

care of the rest; and it is no unusual
sight to see the team take the ball
the entire length of the field in a
passing and dribbling rush in which
practically every man takes a part.
S. C. Good on Defense
On the other hand Santa Clara, al
though by 110 means devoid of attack,
nevertheless seems to have leaned
more strongly toward defense, and I
believe its team to be much superior
in this department of the game. Every
man of them, from their fighting
bunch of forwards to the fullback
seems to be possessed of a deadly
tackle. It is here that their chances
of victory seem to lie.
From my observation based entirely
on the games which the Olympic Club
has played against the twe varsities,
the question seems to resolve itself
into whethe.r or not a strong attack
can defeat a good defense. Stanford
has trebled Santa Clara's points
against the Olympic this year, but we
have done much scoring against the
Cardinals. However, taking all things
into consideration, I think Stanford
should win by at least eleven points.
