# Cardinal Victory to Be Won Only by the Hardest Fighting
## 
### G.K. Howard, '17 
There exists among large numbers
of football followers on the Stanford
campus a feeling of self satisfaction
and absolute conviction that Satur
day's rugby classic will find the Car
dinal varsity a top-heavy winner when
the eighty minutes of play have once
again become mere history. Such a
state of mind may be classed as noth
ing else than hair-brained over-confi
dence.
Fans and enthusiasts who have kept
in touch with the work of both fifteens
since the beginning of the season en
tertain not the slightest doubt but that
this year's Big Game will be a close
and extremely hard-fought affair.
Neither by comparative weights, speed,
fighting spirit, o.r scores, can one
prophesy any other kind of outcome.
.May Score First
What is more, the initial ten min
utes of Saturday's conflict will find
the Stanford rooters gazing with open
mouths at the determined rush of the
Santa Clara aggregation. The work
of the mission forwards will come in
for special comment. Indeed it should
occasion no surprise if the enemy's
pack gets away with the first try of
the contest. The eight men that con
stitute their scrum are a rugged,
tough and fast moving lot of rovers.
Time and again one will see them
break through for dangerous on
slaughts toward the home goal line.
liacktield Untried
The Santa Clara backfield, however,
is a speculative combination. The

new unit plays Saturday for the first
time together. Just how they will
figure in long passing rushes is diffi
cult to estimate, but the fact that they
have never worked as a machine be
fore must be borne in mind.
Only four tries have been tallied
against Santa Clara during the entire
season, while Stanford's goal line has
been crossed with great frequency. On
the othe.r hand, the home team has
rolled ui) a much larger total of points
than has Santa Clara. One may nat
uially infer then that the missionites
are superior on the defense, while
Stanford shines on the offense. This
being true, the old adage of the Wal
labies and All-Hlacks that "a good at
tack is the best defense," points fa
vorably to the Cardinals.
Predictions Without Itasis
Prediction of a score really shows
a lack of reason, but still it is great
sport, if the Stanford pack manages
to draw an even break with the mis
sion scrum, then the Cardinal back
field will attach a victory by perhaps
a 19 to 11 count. Should the Santa
Clara forwards have the edge, then
a much closer score, something like
16 to 13 will result. Any way one fig
ures the Red and White team is going
to register at least a pair of tries.
Hut despite this fact, in company with
numerous confident Stanford fans we
are led to believe that Floyd Brown's
proteges will emerge successful after
a trying battle in which winner or
loser are separated only by a narrow
margin.
