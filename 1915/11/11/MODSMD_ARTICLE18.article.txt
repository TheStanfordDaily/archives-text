# Santa Clara Team Strong
## 
### 
The public can rest assured that
when Coach Ybarrando selects his
final fifteen to uphold the honor of
the "Rod and White," it shall be the
most polished team capable of .repre
senting Santa Clara.
Our record this year is certainly an
enviable one and our strong defensive
work has prevented many a score.
Holding the Olympic Club to three
scores in as many games and easily
defeating them on every occasion are
some of the varsity achievements.
On November 13 the .rugby fans will
have an opportunity of seeing the two
greatest rugby machines in the state
in action, and realizing the respective
merits of both teams, I feel confident
the Santa Clara Varsity will do justice
to itself, whether victorious or de
feated.
