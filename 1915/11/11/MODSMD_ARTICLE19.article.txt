# Stanford Has the Edge
## 
### F.J. Gard, '14 
After seeing both of the teams in
action it seems to me that Ewing field
is going to see a mighty close run for
honors on the 13th. If either fifteen
is to he conceded it the edge should
he Stanford, and I look for the Farm
boys to make Saturday's game a Car
dinal win by two o.c three tries.
Santa Clara has a fast bunch of for
wards and some goers behind the
scrum in Diaz and Scholtz. The Stan
ford forwards ought to make it an
even break with the Missionit.es, how
ever, and if they do this our backfleld
can be counted on for the rest. It
will be a tussle between Santa Clara
trying to make it a contest of for
wards and Stanford working to give
the backfleld a chance to speed things
up.
