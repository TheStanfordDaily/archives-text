# "I Believe That We Will Win" Says Captain Danny Carroll
## Captain Expresses Squad's Appreciation For Work of Coach Floyd Brown 
### 
"The football season is nearly fin
ished. A world of meaning is ex
pressed in these half dozen words.
The period when days and nights are
governed by strict training rules is
almost over, and many hopes of mak-

ing the freshmen or varsity teams
have been confirmed or shattered.
"The result of the voluntary disci
pline of the football squad is now evi
dent. The men who have been chosen
to play on the varsity are in excellent
physical condition.
"The team which will represent
Stanford at Ewing field on Saturday
is very different from the one which
played the Olympic Club in the first
game of the season. Instead of fifteen
players wearily lumbering along with


Captain Danny Carroll
no idea of combination we now have
a well oiled rugby machine. For this
happy state of affairs the everlasting
and untiring efforts of Coach Floyd
Brown are solely responsible. He be
gan the season with only a few veter
ans, but with the exercise of a whole
lot of patience and perseverance and
by changing playe.rs from position to
position he has built up a team which
will worthily represent Stanford. Of
course the players have co-operated
with him. That was to be expected.
They are still loyally endeavoring to
follow his instructions, and if they
go into the game on Saturday able as
well as willing to practice what he has
taught them—if they produce the
football which they have exhibited oc
casionally this year—l believe Stan
ford will win.
"After the Coach, the sincere thanks
of the entire university are due to the
second and third varsity men and the
members of the Peanut League, whose
self sacrificing efforts have made the
production of this year's freshman and
varsity teams possible.
"If we win it will only be with the
aid of a spirit of dogged determina
tion to give the best we have. Santa
Clara without the assistance of sev
eral of her best players has answered
every question asked of her, and an
swered them well. I believe we will
win because the Stanford spirit will
not allow this team to be beaten, and
because I know that every man who
has made the varsity will enter the
game firmly resolved to take every
oliiMico to insure our being victorious."
