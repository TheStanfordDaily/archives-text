"Before picking a likely winner of
the Big (ianie, I would like to give an
expression of thanks and praise to
the members of the second varsity

spirit they have displayed during the

such men building and training the
varsity, rugby is going to continue to
maintain its high standard.
"This year we have been very for
tunate in the matter of injuries, and
so in case of defeat will have no ex-

cusos to offer. Saturday's game will
he a battle from start to finish. The
teams are well matched, and for this
reason it would he the height of folly
to name the victor, as only the sods
of chance can foretell the final result.
Stanford will he up there fighting all
the time, ard whether win or lose, the
students will he proud of them."
