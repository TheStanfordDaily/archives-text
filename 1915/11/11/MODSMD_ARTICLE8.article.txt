The varsity and substitutes are an
nounced, and just as those before us
have done since the beginning, we
greet them with hearty confidence.
This season has been a vital one in
Stanford athletic history. We com
mend and congratulate all men and
women of the university who have
thrown their will and their effort to
ward fulfillment of the community
purpose. They have measured up to
a deep obligation, and have fashioned
enthusiastic success out of materials
which some would have made us be
lieve were only a dismal hope.
So the gratitude and good cheer of
each of us is due not only to the big
men who have won their right to face
Santa Clara. We think also, and
warmly of the boys who have quali
fied only for the honored twilight
squads, after a grilling workout. They
are ready to play the game for Stan
ford from the bleachers next Satur
day with us common mortals. And
in meeting out praise we don't neg
lect the unassuming and ungifted stu
dents who have had nothing more to
add to the cause than their good in
tentions and loyal boosts. Out of the
combined labor has come a Hig Game
which fills all requirements of the tra
ditional task-master.
Bring on the Rally!
