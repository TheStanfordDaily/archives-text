# FIGHTING SPIRIT OF STANFORD FLARES AT RALLY
## ASSEMBLY HALL IN UPROAR Speakers Urge Support of Team in New Era of Athletics for Stanford 
### 
Stanford Spirit, long smouldering,
broke forth into flames last night,
ignited first by the flare of Roman
lights at the Hall and along the Row,
then continuing with an amazing ve
locity during the rally at the Assem
bl\ Mali, and finally capping the cli
max when hundreds serpentined about
the huge blazing pyre.
The like of such a football rally lias
not been seen about the campus for
many a day. Five actual dyed in the
wool orators aided by three yell lead
ers kept a packed Assembly Hall in
continual uproar of enthusiasm. When
the surprise package consisting of a
welcome talk by President Branner
concluded the wild cheering, football
was affixed upon every one and every
thing as the only official topic for dis
cussion between now and 2::'.0 Sat
urday afternoon.

Chris Bradley, '99, prominent in
undergraduate literary activities, spoke
with a mixture of seriousness and hu
mor that registered a decided hit.
For this reason, he heads the collini.
He said in part as follows:
"Last Saturday I paid five dollars
to sec 1 a football game at California.
This is the most money I ever paid
to see a parade without features. It
didn't even have a lioat. The greatest
funeral that ever took place at
Berkeley was that of James Garfield
Schacffer.
Freshmen Are Pioneers
"You know who started this trou
ble, and you know who will finish it.
The present freshman class is in a
sense a pioneer class, and has a won
derful work ahead. This duty is big
ger than the Big Game, and you are
the calibre of men to do things.
"The Big Game is neither with Cal
ifornia nor Santa Clara. The Big
Game is to make the right impression
on the public by a clean, sportsman
like, and manly policy loth at home
and in the outside world. Remember
it is not the Big Game, but The Big
Game in a broader sense that counts.
Couch Given Reception
When Floyd Brown stood up to talk,
he was forcibly hoisted upon the plat
form , and then given a .royal recep
tion. He said in brief:
"1 wish tonight to thank the entire
squad for the loyalty displayed
through the entire season. 1 question
that the student body recognizes their
sacrifice and spirit. Let us not for
get them. The team that will repre
sent Stanford Saturday compares very
favorably with those in the past, and
can be depended upon to fight every
inch of the way. The student body
must get behind them throughout
each one of the eighty minutes of the
same. This spirit coupled with a
fighting team will defeat Santa Clara."
Former Coach George Presley ex
horted the rooters to back the team
to the limit.
New Era in Atlilctics
"Tonight marks a new epoch in
Stanford athletics. New conditions
have arisen to meet new situations.
The question is, are we big enough
to meet them. The coach, and squad
have given their item of proof. Two
things must happen on Saturday.
First we must defeat Santa Clara de
cisively, and second a real Big Game
atmosphere with enthusiasm and
spirit must abound. The very life

of Stanford athletics depends upon
this. Let's get behind the team now
and show them that Stanford spirit
is just as good as it ever was."
Team in Condition
Trainer Doc Reynolds added his
mite by vouching for the condition of
the team.
"I want to say those in charge
of the training quarters never ques
tioned Santa Clara's ability. The team
has been conditioned so as to be in
perfect trim, and they compose a good,
clean fighting bunch of fellows. They
are filled with the Stanford spirit and
will work hard all the way."
The evening closed with a short
talk by Doctor Branner. The Presi
dent of the university was greeted
with a double ovation.
"I here place upon you the official
blessing of the university. I know
the team and student body will give
a splendid account of itself Saturday.
I wish you all good luck and a happy
time, and I'll be there to enjoy it with
you."

have given their item of proof. Two
things must happen on Saturday.
First we must defeat Santa Clara de
cisively, and second a real Big Game
atmosphere with enthusiasm and
spirit must abound. The very life

of Stanford athletics depends upon
this. Let's get behind the team now
and show them that Stanford spirit
is just as good as it ever was."
Team in Condition
Trainer Doc Reynolds added his
mite by vouching for the condition of
the team.
"I want to say those in charge
of the training quarters never ques
tioned Santa Clara's ability. The team
has been conditioned so as to be in
perfect trim, and they compose a good,
clean fighting bunch of fellows. They
are filled with the Stanford spirit and
will work hard all the way."
The evening closed with a short
talk by Doctor Branner. The Presi
dent of the university was greeted
with a double ovation.
"I here place upon you the official
blessing of the university. I know
the team and student body will give
a splendid account of itself Saturday.
I wish you all good luck and a happy
time, and I'll be there to enjoy it with
you."
Stanford Spirit, long smouldering,
broke forth into flames last night,
ignited first by the flare of Roman
lights at the Hall and along the Row,
then continuing with an amazing ve
locity during the rally at the Assem
bl\ Mali, and finally capping the cli
max when hundreds serpentined about
the huge blazing pyre.
The like of such a football rally lias
not been seen about the campus for
many a day. Five actual dyed in the
wool orators aided by three yell lead
ers kept a packed Assembly Hall in
continual uproar of enthusiasm. When
the surprise package consisting of a
welcome talk by President Branner
concluded the wild cheering, football
was affixed upon every one and every
thing as the only official topic for dis
cussion between now and 2::'.0 Sat
urday afternoon.

Chris Bradley, '99, prominent in
undergraduate literary activities, spoke
with a mixture of seriousness and hu

For this reason, he heads the collini.
He said in part as follows:
"Last Saturday I paid five dollars
to sec 1 a football game at California.
This is the most money I ever paid
to see a parade without features. It
didn't even have a lioat. The greatest
funeral that ever took place at
Berkeley was that of James Garfield
Schacffer.
Freshmen Are Pioneers
"You know who started this trou
ble, and you know who will finish it.
The present freshman class is in a
sense a pioneer class, and has a won
derful work ahead. This duty is big
ger than the Big Game, and you are
the calibre of men to do things.
"The Big Game is neither with Cal
ifornia nor Santa Clara. The Big
Game is to make the right impression
on the public by a clean, sportsman
like, and manly policy loth at home
and in the outside world. Remember
it is not the Big Game, but The Big
Game in a broader sense that counts.
Couch Given Reception
When Floyd Brown stood up to talk,
he was forcibly hoisted upon the plat
form , and then given a .royal recep
tion. He said in brief:
"1 wish tonight to thank the entire
squad for the loyalty displayed
through the entire season. 1 question
that the student body recognizes their
sacrifice and spirit. Let us not for
get them. The team that will repre
sent Stanford Saturday compares very
favorably with those in the past, and
can be depended upon to fight every
inch of the way. The student body
must get behind them throughout
each one of the eighty minutes of the
same. This spirit coupled with a
fighting team will defeat Santa Clara."
Former Coach George Presley ex
horted the rooters to back the team
to the limit.
New Era in Atlilctics
"Tonight marks a new epoch in
Stanford athletics. New conditions
have arisen to meet new situations.
The question is, are we big enough
