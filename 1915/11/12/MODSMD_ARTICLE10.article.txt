# Game More Strenuous Than California Ever Gave Cardinal
## 
### William Unmack 
The first big rugby game that Santa
Clara ever played was Thanksgiving
day 1907, and her opponent was the
Barbarians, in those days the stellar
club rugby aggregation. In those days
rugby at Santa Clara was a worse
conglomeration than at Stanford. The
Santa Clara boys tried all sorts of
stunts and if they failed to tackle
their man, they tried to stop him in
any other manner that they could.
Ssiiiln Clara Worthy Opponent
Santa Clara really did not*make her
mark until 1912 as a rugby college,
but since then the very calibre of
he.r game, the very serious manner in
which the Catholic college boys have
gone about their work to improve
their rugby standards, and their rapid
rise to fame have all been factors that
have made the public stop and take
notice, and further than that there is
an element of sportsmanship that the
Santa Clara men show that is going
to make her a worthy opponent fo.r
Stanford.
Stanford is going to win 011 Satur
day, but get this —there will be 110
72 to 0 score. Picking scores is a

gamble but on the play of tbc two
teams this year—and mind you this is
only a guess—the score will probably
be about 20 or 25 to 12 points or there
abouts.
Three Tries for .Missionites
Santa Clara knows too much about
the game for even such a wonderful
back field as Captain Danny Carroll
has associated with him to pile up any
I score that will approach the 72-0
i slaughter. Bear in mind that Santa
Clara is going to score at least two
1 tries and probably three, and 1 don't
| fee how the Stanford defense is going
;to prevent ttie collegians from the
! Mission town from penetrating their
j line for these tries at least.
No matter which way you look at it
j Saturday's game is going to be the
j greatest exhibition of rugby played
Iby any team in this state. The rugby
I standards today have reached the
height of perfection and if California
I were still playing rugby the men at
j Berkeley would be playing just such
a high class improved game as Stan
ford and Santa Clara have shown this
year.
