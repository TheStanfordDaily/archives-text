# Winners Cannot Be Picked Until Last Whistle Has Blown

### Father White 
"Tomorrow at 2:30 the greatest mo
ment in Santa Clara's athletic history
will have arrived. She will for the
first time meet Stanford in a real in
tercollegiate football game, a game
that will be second in importance to
none of the Stanford-California games
of years gone by. Along with every
body else, who is interested in college
affairs, I have been requested for my
answer to the question, 'Who will
win?'
Result I'licertiiln
"I would like to be able to say
promptly and without reasonable
doubt, 'Santa Clara.' But I cannot.
Neither (thank Goodness) can T say,
Stanford.' Viewed from some points
it looks all Stanford, from others very
much Santa Clara. With Stanford go
experience, speed and combination in
the backfield, and the known ability
to go at top speed under the strain
of the crucial game. With Santa Clara
go indomitable grit, exceptional speed
in the forwards, impregnable defense

in the backfield, and an uncanny way
of rising to great occasions and play
ing way above their ordinary form.
Stanford will meet the hardest tack
ling, the swiftest following on that she
has ever faced . Will her smooth,
machine-like combination play con
tinue in spite of this? Perhaps.
Santa Clara will bear the unwonted
strain of a real Big Game, and will
face the most determined as well as
the experienced and skillful foe that
she has yet encountered. Will her
fighting spirit, her powerful forwards,
her hard-tackling backs prove equal
to these exceptional demands? Per
haps.
Worthy lfiviils
"Had 1 any other word with which
to answer these questions, T would
venture a prediction. Unfortunately,
I have not. I can only say that, win
or lose, the lied and White will find
a knightly foe in the Cardinal. If
Stanford proves master of the day,
the first to acclaim her victor will be
Santa Clara."
