# MULLINEUX BELIEVES GAME WILL BE CLOSE
## Work of Forwards Will Be Decisive Factor of Contest on Ewing Field 
### Rev. M. Mullineux 
Saturday, November 13, will see the
beginning of what every rugby enthu
siast hopes will be a long sevies of
contests between Stanford and Santa
Clara. The rivalry between the two
universities is not quite of the inter
collegiate brand (and perhaps this is
ja good thing), but whenever these ex-
| ponents of the rugby code have met I
during the past few seasons, the foot
ball produced has been ahead of any
thing- shown at the- so-called Big
Games. This year's game will be no
exceptionâ€”a fine exhibition of the
rugby game is assured. How fine we
; cannot tell, but certain it is that the
Ewing field in San Francisco will
witness no such fiasco as disgraced
the Berkeley field last Saturday.
Team Strength Unknown
It is difficult, to form anything like
an accurate estimate of the strength
of the two teams. Santa Clara has
| never had their full strength in the
j field for a game, owing to injuries,
and there have been constant changes
in the Stanford line-up. I have, how
i ever, seen much of the players in ac
' tion, and make my forecast on the
general character of the play, and
not on the scares made during any
I particular or games.
Itncklicld Broken I'p
On the whole, Stanford is the more
! polished team of the two. It has a
great scoring machine in the backfield
but not so good as last year. That
wonderful "triangular scoring pivot"
(Austin, Lachmund, and Carroll) of
the 1914 team is missing, and Carroll
is certainly not so dangerous in the
present combination. There is a lack
of real understanding in this year's
j trio. On the other hand, there is a
marked improvement in the forward
i play. The game with the Palo Alto
! club on October 21' produced the finest
! brand of football I have ever seen in
| California, and the work of the for
| wards reminded me of the open.
I brainy play of the All-Blacks. That
game, however, revealed the weakness
of the Stantord team, as did last Sat
urday's Olympic game. There is a
lack of deadliness in the tackling, and
the defense has often failed against
a robust attack.
Prune Tickers Are Fighters
Against this wonderful scoring
team, with its lack of strength in de
fense, Santa Clara will send fifteen
fighters. The prune pickers have one or
two dangerous men in their backfield,
but as a team the Stanford backs have
the edge on them, although they will
find the mission defense hard to
pierce. The issue of the game will de
pend on the way the forwards control
the ball. The Cardinal pack has a
finer football sense, but the Santa
Clara men are fighters and play one
i of those "on the ball" games that do
so much to upset the plans of a more
skillful team. Their defense also is
distinctly good, and this is a great
I asset.
i Score Hill be Close
112 look for a close contest. If the
Santa Clara forwards in any way dom
inate the scrum, the game will be very
close, and not more than fi points
should separate the teams at the end.
If, however. Stanford controls the
scrum, I think they should be returned
winners by about 15 points.
