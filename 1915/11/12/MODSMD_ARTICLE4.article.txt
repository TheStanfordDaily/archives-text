# IF STANFORD WINS, BACKFIELD WILL TURN TRICK, SAYS DOUGLAS ERSKINE
## 
### Douglas Erskine 
Your letter asking me to give you
.'in article on the coming game be
tween Stanford and Santa Clara re
quests that I give my opinion on the
probable winner. As one sporting
editor to another I want to tell you
that you can't get me to step into any
such trap as that.
Suppose I said I expected to see
Stanford win, those wild youths from
Santa Clara might drag me out of
my bed some night—or morn ins; or
whatever time it is a newspaperman
goes to bis bed, and show me a lot
of stars that Father Hicard never
knew a think about.
If I was to declare mvself as favor
ing Santa Clara's chances, I would

be leaving myself open to a sudden
attack sometime from a lot of Farm
hands who would not hesitate, judg
ing by their prior reco.rd, to paint me
cardinal from head to foot. When it
comes to painting anything red 1 pre
fer to do the painting myself.
Having been an American citizen
for many years. I believe in being
neutral, and even to oblige a fellow
sporting editor I cannot allow myself
to be dragged into war. even of the
wordy kind.
Honestly, I think it will be a great
name. I have seen both teams in ac
tion and really believe that they are
well matched. Stanford appears to
have a shade in speed in its backfleld,
which is offset by the superior speed
of the Santa Clara forwards. I can

not see where there is any difference
in the scrum work, both sides being
proficient in booking and heeling.
T look for a close sco.re, and have
an idea which I will impart to you
and your readers only, that if Stan
ford is going to win it will be through
some brilliant work by those king
pins of opportunists, Danny Carroll,
Joe Urban and Ric Templeton.
Hut tell the Stanford boys not to
feel too gay until this thing is all
over. Santa Clara has a fighting
bunch, always has had, in fact, and
those lads will never «i"it until the
I all goes dead after the final pistol.
I hope that the day will be fine,
that the crowd is commensurate with
the importance of the occasion, and
that the better team will win.
