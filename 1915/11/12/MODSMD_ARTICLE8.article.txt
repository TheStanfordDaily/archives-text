# Stanford Day
## 
### 
All roads lead to Ewing field. Com
bined with our enthusiasm for Santa
Clara's defeat, those couple of thou
sand of us who heard Chris Bradley
talk at the rally last night are primed
to play a bigger Big Game than we
ever thought about painting in the
scheme before.
Many seniors and holdovers, and
graduates thought there has never
been another such address on the eve
of contest, in these last four years or
more of pre-game rallies. Today the
belief is stronger. There was bright
color in the Stanford Spirit Chris
Mradley spoke of, and we feel the
goodness of it all over.
He told us to play the game all day
in San Francisco tomorrow, in the
midst of strangers in the streets; to
play it from the bleachers so that the
spectators will know that Stanford
breeds pluck that keeps its cheer even
through changes of weather. And he
gave us intelligent reason to believe
in the bigness of our duty to make this
Big Game with a new rival, one of
untarnished fact.
The other speakers, and the demon
strations of loyalty indoors and on the
Inner Quad, and around the bonfire
carried us on to stronger resolve. So
that we are ready to make tomorrow a
Stanford day.
