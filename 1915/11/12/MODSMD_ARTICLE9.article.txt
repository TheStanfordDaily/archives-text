# Stanford Should Win Game By Ten Points
## 
### Raymond Bartlett 
There used to be a sign that Fall
was here—a sign as sure as changing
autumn leaves or the latent rush of
blood to the freshman skull. Along
in October, the reddening, latter days,
when bills come in and hours fail,
something happened at the "farm."
You could sense it in the air, a
strained and sudden something, steal
ing through the sultry open and pres
ent even in the staid quarters of the
class room. Stanford slumped. The
team staggered, slipped and rolled
completely over. Game stocks fell,
the wailers wailed and over Berke
ley way the Bruins chortled. The
Cardinal, to be inelegant, went for
the time, precisely on the bum.
How often this happened is a mat
ter of history. We know that it was
only a rift in the red mist, that re
covered and swept goalwards for
gains, or failing never faltered. But
this year it is different.
Host Yet to Come
Six weeks ago, in September, to be
historically correct, Stanford's team
looked bad. There was little unity,
the gang lacked the old "pep" and
Floyd was mentally perturbed. Santa
Clara looked good at this stage of

the game, the Mission Town was fight
ing mad and Stanford's stock went for
a song on Santa Clara's principal
boulevard. Here was Stanford's
slump with a vengeance. But the big
thing is that it all happened in ad
vance. The worst came first and now,
believe me, the best is coming last.
Stanford looks a winner today. The
team has an oiled completeness in
attack that generally wins. You can't
stand still and win football games.
Stanford is always on the move. Her
three-quarter line has the punch and
unless this business of experting foot
ball games gets an awful setback —
it looks right now as if Stanford
should win Saturday's game by at
least ten points.
Pencil Athletes. Wrong
Sitting-down athletes, the boys who
hate figured Stanford's chances at
100 to 1, let us say, had better hesi
tate. Santa Clara is facing her first
big chance. The boys from down
south are fighters in the Muldoon
sense. They don't know the word
halt. Stanford will face this kind of
business and we all know what that
means. There will he a battle of the
real kind —not mere hostilities, social
badinage, but rather a test of brains
and courage.
