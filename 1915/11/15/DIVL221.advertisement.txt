Good Sport and Good Smoke
Go Together
There's more crisp, brisk, youthful vigor in an ounce
of "Bull" Durham than in a pound of any other
tobacco ever rolled up into a cigarette. It's the co
partner of the go-ahead spirit—the delight of the fresh,
unjaded taste that goes with enthusiasm and energy.
This grand old tobacco —the favorite of three genera
tions —is today the liveliest smoke in the whole world.
"Bull Durham
SMOKING TOBACCO
Within the last two years tha "roll-your-own" idea has
spread amazingly. I housands of men have learned that
their own hand-rolled "Bull"Durham cigarettes have a fresh
ness and fragrance impossible to obtain in any other
way. Made exclusively from mi'd,
ripe Virginia-North Carolina "bright"
tobacco leaf, "Bull" Durham is
unique in its mellow-sweet flavor.
Try it once and you'll smoke it
always.
