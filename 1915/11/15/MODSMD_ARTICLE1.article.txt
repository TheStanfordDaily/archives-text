# STANFORD WINS ANNUAL DEBATE FROM U.C. TRIO
## TEAMS ARE WELL MATCHED Superiority in Refutation and Rebuttal Gives Cardinal Advantage 
### 
Superiority in refutation and rebut
tal won the twenty-second annual in
tercollegiate debate with California
for Stanford in a closely contested
platform battle Friday evening in the
auditorium of the Girls' High School,
San Francisco.
Stanford upheld the affirmative of
the question, "Resolved, That the Fed
eral Government should own and op
erate all railroads engaging in inter
state traffic, except interurban electric
lines crossing state boundaries." Cal
ifornia argued the negative.
oruth well Opens Debate
S. W. Grathwell, transfer, opened
the debate for Stanford, pointing out
the fundamental economic truth that
a railroad is a natural monopoly and
not intended for competitive manage
ment. He exposed some of the evils of
competition, including duplication in
construction of stations and offices, in
issuance of bonds, in legal depart
ments, in advertising, and in through
trains; and demonstrated the im
mense economic waste of the present
extensive system of misrouting of
freight.
Paul Fussell was the first California
speaker to take the platform. He at
tempted to discount Grathwell's argu
ments by offering statistics which were
aimed to prove that the United States
railroads under private management
were the best in the world and lowest
in freight rates, contending that the
present system was satisfactory.
After a few words in refutation, J.
W. Fribley, '18, second Stanford speak
er, outlined a practicable plan for ad
ministration of the nation's railroads ;
by the government, by which a com
mission of railroad experts would con
trol a centralized system, lie pro
ceeded to explain how the evils of the
present railroad situation would be
bettered by government ownership.
One-eighth of the total railroad capi
talization of the United States is in
the hands of receivers at present, he
said.
S. K. Burke of California, in the sec
ond negative speech, sought to tear
down the arguments of the affirmative.
Then he brought out reasons for favor
ing government regulation as opposed
to government ownership.
Hettinger Forceful Speaker
In refutation of negative speeches,
A. .1. Hettinger, '1(5, scored some
sfong points, proving that the present
condition of railroads in the United
States was unsatisfactory, that gov
ernment ownership would be better,
and that such ownership would not
entail political and other evils. . Het
tinger also did some strong construc
tive work, showing that government
| ownership of railroads would prove
America's great opportunity after the
1 present war to properly supply the
| needs of increased American trade
with Europe and the rest of the world.
That government ownership would
he accompanied by political and other
! evils was the strongest argument ad
vanced by J. E. Johnston, third Cali
fornia orator, who showed instances
of "porkbarrel" methods in rivers and
harbors and in military administration,
advocating government control by
commission as a more effective mode
of regulation than ownership by the
government.
"The affirmative have maintained
government ownership would he pos
sible. but has not shown that it will
he possible," said S. K. Burke of Cali
i fornia, who summed up the negative
i stand.

| Stanford Kehutfal Strong
j A fiery and convincing rebuttal
j s;>eech by Hettinger clinched the de-
I cision in favor of Stanford. Hettinger
plead with the negative to make their
analogies more analagous—"to bring
them back to earth," —and pointed out
instances of California fallacies. ITe
repeated the fundamental economic
truth upon which the affirmative hased
their case. In conclusion he said:
"The negative in failing to meet every
argument we have put squarely before
you, have proved our case better than
we could hove hoped to do ourselves."
Chief Justice F. M. Angellotti of the
Supreme Court of California, and As
sociate Justices .1. E. Richards and F.
11. Kerrigan of the district court of ap
peals, acted as judges. S. T. Miller, Jr.,
assistant professor of the Stanford
Economics department, presided as
chairman. H. C. Blote, '18, of Stan
ford, and Miss Carrie Tessin of Cali
fornia, served as alternates.
