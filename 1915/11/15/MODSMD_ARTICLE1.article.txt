# STANFORD WINS ANNUAL DEBATE FROM U.C. TRIO
## TEAMS ARE WELL MATCHED Superiority in Refutation and Rebuttal Gives Cardinal Advantage 
### 
Superiority in refutation and rebut
tal won the twenty-second annual in
tercollegiate debate with California
for Stanford in a closely contested
platform battle Friday evening in the
auditorium of the Girls' High School,
San Francisco.
Stanford upheld the affirmative of
the question, "Resolved, That the Fed
eral Government should own and op
erate all railroads engaging in inter
state traffic, except interurban electric
lines crossing state boundaries." Cal
ifornia argued the negative.
oruth well Opens Debate
S. W. Grathwell, transfer, opened
the debate for Stanford, pointing out
the fundamental economic truth that
a railroad is a natural monopoly and
not intended for competitive manage
ment. He exposed some of the evils of
competition, including duplication in
construction of stations and offices, in
issuance of bonds, in legal depart
ments, in advertising, and in through
trains; and demonstrated the im
mense economic waste of the present
extensive system of misrouting of
freight.
Paul Fussell was the first California
speaker to take the platform. He at
tempted to discount Grathwell's argu
ments by offering statistics which were
aimed to prove that the United States
railroads under private management
were the best in the world and lowest
in freight rates, contending that the
present system was satisfactory.
