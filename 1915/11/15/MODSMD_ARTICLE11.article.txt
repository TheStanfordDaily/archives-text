# DANSANT BIG SUCCESS
## Stanford People Flock to Palace Hotel After Game 
### 
As a substitute for the annual foot
ball show, the dinner dansant at the
Palace Hotel was a big success for
the ballroom was crowded and nearly
one hundred people were turned away
for the lack of table space. The cab
aret show consisted of a few acts by
Farm talent aided by a roaming Ha
waiian orchestra. Dancing followed
the entertainment. Many alumni were
present, as the Palace was the Stan
ford headquarters.
