# CALIFORNIA SCORES ON WASHINGTON TEAM
## Phenomenal "Comeback" of Blue and Gold Baffles Every Dopester 
### 
California "came back" at Seattle
; last Saturday, holding the University
;of Washington football team to a 13
1 to 7 score in the second game with
j the northerners. The score was a sur
prise to football fans, coming as it did
one week after the 72 to 0 whitewash
on the Berkeley gridiron November 6.
Through the entire game the Blue
and Gold players were on their feet
I
and played a hard, sure defensive
i game. The line-ups of the two teams
! were practically the same as in the
first, game.
For the first three quarters of the
j game the Californians played the
northerners to a standstill, holding
them to a 0 to 0 score. A few trick
plays put the Washingtonians in the
lead. Following this the Berkeley
players recovered themselves and
managed to tie the score. The final
points which gave Washington her
victory were made just before the
whistle blew.
Sharp of California was the indi
vidual star of the game. No weak
I points were evident on the Blue and
I Gold line-up, such as were the fea
ture of the first game between the two
| colleges on the Berkeley field, one
week ago.
