# Santa Clara Bleachers Give Cardinal Rooters Real Big Game Test

### 
What is the chief difference between
a Big Game and a preliminary con
test? Is it always the brand of foot
hall played? True, the type of play in
Saturday's game was superior to any
thing seen on the varsity field this
season, but it was not for this reason
alone that the contest will be Riven
a full sized niche in the Big Game
hall of fame. No, the real reason that
the struggle on Ewing field will be
classed with the Big (James of the past
is that the rooting and pep of the con
testants' backers was up to form.
Santa Clara is a small college, but
it brought no evidence of this handi
cap to the Ewing field bleachers. The
Mission rooters were on the job

shown by the bleachers that Santa
Clara is given Big Game rating. For

to share In Santa Clara's promotion to
the Big Game league join in saying
that it was a real Big Game —that
struggle staged on the turf and in
the bleachers under the shadow of
Lone Mountain.
