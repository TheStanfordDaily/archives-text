resignation of Wilmer J. Gross from
the position of managing editor of
The Daily Palo Alto. The serious ill
ness of Mr. F. W. Gross requires his
sou's absence from Stanford during
the remainder of the college year. The
former managing edidtor has already
assumed new duties in the firm of
Jackson and Gross in San Jose.
Since he began work on The Daily
Palo Alto in January of 1913, Gross
has been a valuable aid. In the progres
sive offices of reporter, news editor,

been stamped with singular skill,
judgment, and energy. Campus jour
nalism loses a man of unusual
strength.

cessfully for two and onehalf
years in various news depart
ments of the paper, is welcomed
to the position of managing editor.
The staff of The Daily Palo Alto has
