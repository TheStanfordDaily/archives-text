# Week-end Frolics
## 
### 
The varsity rusgers have received i
full measure of campus approval, anc
everybody admits it. The same ai
Ewing field was a good game, and al
Stanford people are proud of the ac
knowledged fact that the Cardinal hat
again identified itself with gooc
sportsmanship. To the new members
of the varsity we extend particulai
greeting, for behaving admirably undet
fire, and for meeting their obligations
as we were sure they would do.
Thanks to the Stanford debating
squad for its splendid supremacy over
California, and to the other trio which
kepi the University of Southern Cali
fornia orators guessing last Friday
evening. The past one has been a
proud week-end for Stanford teams.
And now the center of attention be
comes spring sports. Are we going
to reach a basis for competition with
California? Here's hoping for an an
swer very soon.
