.1. S. Doraii Injured
J. S. Doron, '19, sustained a broken
collarbone as the result of a fall dur
ing the serpentine after the Big Game.
He was among the leaders of the pro
cession as it passed under the goal
posts and the sudden halt, due to the
congestion there, threw Doron head
long ove,r those who were on the
ground in front of hint, causing a clean
fracture of the bone. He was removed
from the Held to the Lane Hospital
where his injuries were -treated by
the resident physician. He will be
unable to use either his arm or shoul
der for about three weeks. Do.ron is
a member of the Theta Xi fraternity.
Los Angeles Sends Greetings
Graduate Manager Behrens received
the following telegram prior to the
game from the Los Angeles Stanford
Club:
Manager Behrens:â€”
The greatest meeting of Los Angeles
Stanford men ever held sends hearti
est congratulations to Stanford's great
est football team. Cardinal enthusi
asm has reached its highest level in
Southern California. We are with you
to a man.
HARLAN SHOEMAKER, Sec'y.
Thirteen Inevitable
Santa Clara used every means pos
j sible to avoid the use of the "unlucky"
number thirteen. The thirteenth tick
et to the big game was bought by an
outsider and sweater number thirteen
was discarded. Then, feeling that they
were safe and luck was with them,
they calmly engaged section thirteen
for their rooters section.
Fire in Stanford Bleachers
A fire that might have cost the loss
I of much life and property had it not
been quickly extinguished, started in
the Stanford section of the bleachers
near the center of the field. A cigar
ette thrown among the confetti started
the conflagration, which was fed by a
rooter's cape and an oflicial program.
It was due only to the presence of
mind of those near tl.at a larger fire
was avoided.
Juveniles Tie
As a curtain raiser to the day's chief
attraction, two juvenile fifteens of the
grammar schools of Palo Alto and Ala
meda had a lively set-to on the turf.
After two ten minute halves the game
ended with the score tied at zero.
Art Smith Performs
A counter attraction that served to
enliven things between halves and the
short period before the game began
was the appearance of Art Smith in
his tiny red .racer. After swerving and
skidding across the turf and perform
ing a few hair-raising turns he stop
ped in front of the Santa Clara root
ing section and led them in a few yells.
Stunt Men Entertain
*
Between halves the stunt men un
der the direction of H. Ling, '19, played
a mimic game of the old style in cos
tiunes of all sorts and descriptions,
much to the amusement of the rooters
and those in the general sections.
Even Art Smith in his little red racer
failed to detract attention from the
game.
Governor Johnson Attends
The appearance of Governor John
son, caused no little excitement among
the Stanford rooters and he was given
a booming skyrocket which he readily
acknowledged.
Crowd Lines Fences
Enthusiastic fans who were minus
the price of admission packed the
mountain west of the park and even
tried to force their way into the
grounds by tearing out boards in the
fence.
