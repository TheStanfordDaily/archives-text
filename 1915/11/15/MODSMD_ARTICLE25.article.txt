# Fall Crew Training for New Men Will Begin In Earnest
## 
### 
Since the close of the football sea
son now makes it possible for a large
number of men to obtain their gym
nasium credit through other sports,
Crew Captain C. 11. O.rme, '16, an
nounces that he is prepared to begin
fall crew training in earnest. All new
men who expect to turn out for crew,
either this semester or next, are to .re
port at the Lagunita boathouse every
evening at five o'clock until further
notice is given.
Although some time will be spent in
work upon the machines and in taking
i "setting-up" exercises, regular work
at the oars is soon to commence. The
two oared barges have been removed
to the Redwood boathouse, and it is
probable that toward the end of this
week excursions to the bay will be
made. The call for all men to turn
out includes those who are contending
for the position of coxswain.
