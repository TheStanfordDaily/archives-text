# STANFORD AGAIN WINS BIG GAME
## Cardinal Ruggers Defeat Santa Clara 30 to 0 in Sensational Struggle---Attendance 15,000 
### 
After eighty long minutes of gruel
ling, slashing, sensational football,
a brilliant victory by a Stanford var
sity was again made history, when
the plucky Santa Clara fifteen was at
last forced to accept a 30 to 0 defeat
at Ewing field Saturday afternoon.
The vanquished, although fighting
with unending courage, were sur
passed in every department of the
game and the score may be taken as
a fair criterion of the comparative
merits of the opposing teams.
Mission Strong at Start
At the outset of the great battle, the
mission ruggers showed to best ad
vantage, keeping the ball in Cardinal
territory for over eight minutes. Then
the fight surged back into Santa Clara
ground, where stubborn defense kept
repeated attack from materializing
into actual points. The turning point
of the game came when, after twenty
six minutes of scoreless play, Frank
Walker shot diagonally twenty yards
through the Santa Clara team for the
psychological try. The lightning fash
ion in which the play was executed
left both the opposition and the on
lookers paralyzed for the moment.
Thereafter, and especially following
Soper's dash across the goal line, there
was no doubt as to the outcome. Dur
ing the early play Stanford bad been
sizing up the strength, weaknesses
and tricks of 'heir rivals, but now
were prepared to tally points by de
termined whirlwind offense.
For Santa Clara to have emerged on

the long end of Saturday's tangle
would have been impossible under the
most favorable conditions for their
style of play was radically at fault
All emphasis was laid on defense,
while offense was left to take care ol
itself. It was a case of the All-Blacks'
motto, "Attack is the best defense,"
proved only too true. Only on one or
two occasions did the ball traverse af>
far as the mission wings during back
field rushes.
The greatest surprise of the day
was the splendid work of the Cardinal
forwards. Such a superb exhibition of
grit, brain, and skill has rarely char
acterized a California rugby contest.
Repeatedly Hraden and Wylie encir
cling the struggling packs would ad
vance the ball many yards toward
Santa Clara's line. Smitherum, Sam
! pie, and Soper dribbled to perfection,
while Rehm and Bloeser proved both
invincible and invaluable.
Stanford Stars Are Legion
When mentioning those who deserve
places in the realm of stars, one must
not forget the work of Art Erb. From
his position at halfback, he proved
the sturdiest link in the chain of the
Stanford varsity. His clever direction
; of both the backfield and scrum kept
| the mission defense continually guess
ing. As the ball passed down the line
! from Walker to Urban to Carroll to
Templeton, we find a discouraging
i quartette for any opposition to tackle.
In fact, they were all stars and not a
one of the team that represented Stan
' ford failed to be covered with glory.

For Santa Clara, Diaz, Mulholland,
Oochina and Kaftus seemed to shine
ji'st a little brighter than their hard
fighting mates. A bright feature ol
the contest was the perfect goal kick
ing of Ric Templeton, who converted
six chances with seeming ease and
j thereby added twelve points to Stan
| ford's total.

Bloeser and Pettingill missed scoring
trys by bare inches. Santa Clara de
fense proved superb. Diaz saved with
a boot to his own 25 yard line. Erb

over the line, where Jackson covered.
Another interchange of boots follow
ing the drop-out finally permitted
Walker to mark on 40 yard line. Dink

dribbling. Ttere a free kick was
awarded Santa Clara for the off-side

Walker Registers First
From a scrum following the line-out,
Frban and Carroll executed a beauti
! ful fiO yard run. Milburn intercepted
a pass on his own 5 yard line, and the
ball was forced out. About this time
Scholz, first five, and Giltnan, middle
rank, were .replaced by Wassum and
Cocliina. A series of goal line scrums
then were in order, but Diaz managed
to kick to his 20 yard line. At this
point Walker received from Erb, and
darted through his opponents like a
sharp knife through pape.r for a timely
try. Ric Templeton converted an easy
goal. Score, 5-0.

ten yards from the line, and the Stan
ford front ranker drove over. Ric
Templeton converted from a rather
difficult angle. Score, 10-0. Bate
kicked off to Carroll, and after a se
ries of boots, the ball went out on
Stanford's 40 yard mark. Right from

menced dribbling toward their oppo
nents' lino. A dozen scrums and line
outs finally allowed the ball to reach
touch on Santa Clara's 20 yard line.

Diaz received from the line-out, and
booted to midfleld. From here the
mission pack dribbled to Stanford's
35 only to have .Joe Urban register the
longest and most brilliant run of the
afternoon. Scooping from the loose

through the entire opposition for the
first t.ry of the second half. Ric Tem

pack with short dashes by the back
field brought play back to Santa Clara
10 yard line. A beautiful boot by Full
back Templeton placed the ball out on
Santa Clara's 20 yard mark. From
here Sample, Soper, and Smitherum
dribbled to the one yard line. The
mission fifteen, after dribbling twenty
ya.rds by a passing rush swiftly execut
ed between Mulholland, Fitzpatrick,
Milburn, and Hate, took the play to
Stanford's forty. From hard midfield
fighting Stanford advanced by boots by
Walker and E,rb to the mission 3 yard
line, where excellent defense held.
Long return kicks by Diaz and Jack
son brought play to Stanford's forty.
A forward pass by Milburn, following
the line-out called Santa Clara back
to Stanford thirty, after a backfield
passing rush had allowed one of her
men to cross the Cardinal line. The
bleachers went wild, but were calmed
when Woodward called the play back
again.
Numerous punting duels in which
Dink Templeton starred followed in
the next few minutes, also featured
by a multitude of rucks and scrums.
Finally following a scrum on Stan
ford's forty, Wylie and Braden showed
their ability by dribbling to Santa
Clara's forty, where Wylie secured,

between Templeton and .lackson, rival
fullbacks, advanced the ball fifteen
yards further. From the line-out
Templeton to Wylie to Smitherum took

to administer to Walker's knee, which
was severely wrenched. Score, 25-0.
Siiiitlicriiin and Itelim Iteplaced
The customary deadly dribbling by
the eight men composing the Stanford
pack took the ball following the kick
off to Santa Clara's forty. Only per
sistent kicks to touch by little Diaz
and Jackson kept the Cardinal attack
from having immediate effect. Car
roll threw a scare into the mission
bleachers by making a dash toward
the Santa Clara goal line, but his short
kick across was covered for a drop
out. Smitherum, after fighting gamely
finally had to be relieved, as bis leg
refused to stand the strain. Knight
was given quite a hand when lie trot
tod out as substitute. When Rehm,
Knight, Wylie and Mraden dribbled
over, Santa Clara once more was
forced to drop-out. Krb marked at
midfleld, from where Dink Templeton
punted to Santa Clara's fifteen. Re
peated charges advanced play to the
five yard line, where scrums and rucks
galore took place. Rehm, who had
been a giant both on attack and de
fense, at last had to give way to llal
sted on account of a weak ankle.
Wit.li only live yards to go, a lightning
rush from Krb to Urban to Car
roll to Templeton allowed the lat
ter to make the final try of the game.
Ric converted his own score. A min
ute later Referee Woodward's whistle
announced the end of a great game.
