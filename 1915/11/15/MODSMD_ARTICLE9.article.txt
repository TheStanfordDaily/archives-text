# STANFORD AGAIN WINS BIG GAME
## Cardinal Ruggers Defeat Santa Clara 30 to 0 in Sensational Struggle---Attendance 15,000 
### 
After eighty long minutes of gruel
ling, slashing, sensational football,
a brilliant victory by a Stanford var
sity was again made history, when
the plucky Santa Clara fifteen was at
last forced to accept a 30 to 0 defeat
at Ewing field Saturday afternoon.
The vanquished, although fighting
with unending courage, were sur
passed in every department of the
game and the score may be taken as
a fair criterion of the comparative
merits of the opposing teams.
Mission Strong at Start
At the outset of the great battle, the
mission ruggers showed to best ad
vantage, keeping the ball in Cardinal
territory for over eight minutes. Then
the fight surged back into Santa Clara
ground, where stubborn defense kept
repeated attack from materializing
into actual points. The turning point
of the game came when, after twenty
six minutes of scoreless play, Frank
Walker shot diagonally twenty yards
through the Santa Clara team for the
psychological try. The lightning fash
ion in which the play was executed
left both the opposition and the on
lookers paralyzed for the moment.
Thereafter, and especially following
Soper's dash across the goal line, there
was no doubt as to the outcome. Dur
ing the early play Stanford bad been
sizing up the strength, weaknesses
and tricks of 'heir rivals, but now
were prepared to tally points by de
termined whirlwind offense.
For Santa Clara to have emerged on

the long end of Saturday's tangle
would have been impossible under the
most favorable conditions for their
style of play was radically at fault
All emphasis was laid on defense,
while offense was left to take care ol
itself. It was a case of the All-Blacks'
motto, "Attack is the best defense,"
proved only too true. Only on one or
two occasions did the ball traverse af>
far as the mission wings during back
field rushes.
The greatest surprise of the day
was the splendid work of the Cardinal
forwards. Such a superb exhibition of
grit, brain, and skill has rarely char
acterized a California rugby contest.
Repeatedly Hraden and Wylie encir
cling the struggling packs would ad
vance the ball many yards toward
Santa Clara's line. Smitherum, Sam
! pie, and Soper dribbled to perfection,
while Rehm and Bloeser proved both
invincible and invaluable.
Stanford Stars Are Legion
When mentioning those who deserve
places in the realm of stars, one must
not forget the work of Art Erb. From
his position at halfback, he proved
the sturdiest link in the chain of the
Stanford varsity. His clever direction
; of both the backfield and scrum kept
| the mission defense continually guess
ing. As the ball passed down the line
! from Walker to Urban to Carroll to
Templeton, we find a discouraging
i quartette for any opposition to tackle.
In fact, they were all stars and not a
one of the team that represented Stan
' ford failed to be covered with glory.

For Santa Clara, Diaz, Mulholland,
Oochina and Kaftus seemed to shine
ji'st a little brighter than their hard
fighting mates. A bright feature ol
the contest was the perfect goal kick
ing of Ric Templeton, who converted
six chances with seeming ease and
j thereby added twelve points to Stan
| ford's total.
