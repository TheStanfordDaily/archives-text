# CAMPAIGN STARTED BY UNION TO COLLECT MONEY DUE
## LIFE MEMBERSHIPS UNPAID Promises Must Be Liquidated to Remove the Interest-Bearing Debt 
### 
In an effort to collect all outstand
ing subscriptions for life membership
to tbe Stanford Union, almost a thou
sand letters are being sent from the
central accounting office to men who
have failed to pay up their pledges.
This work is being carried on under
the supervision of the Hoard of Gov
ernors, and will be conducted vigor
ously until all outstanding subscrip
tions have been paid.
The pledges secured during the five
years before actual construction was
begun on the Union building would
have been sufficient to cover the cost
of building had they all been paid.
As it is, however, the Hoard of Gov
ernors has been obliged to bor.row
money to put the Union in running
condition, with the result tha there is
an interest bearing debt of $10,7r>0.
At present there are 298 fully paid
life memberships, which, at $r>o each,
amount to $14,900. If all pledges were
in this fund would be almost doubled,
furnishing ample funds to pay the
debt.
Life Memberships Needed
As matters stand now, the income
from current student memberships
and rentals will, as far as can be
foreseen, cover the operating expenses
of the Union, but will not leave a safe
fund for interest payments or sinking
fund charges for meeting the indebt
edness when due. It is therefore im
perative that all life memberships he
paid, and when the movement to ac
complish this is well started there
