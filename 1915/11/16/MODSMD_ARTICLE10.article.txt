### 
That the Stanford Glee Club will
make a trip to Honolulu during the
Christmas vacation has at last be
come a fact. Manager J. S. Higley,
'17, has arranged with Manager C. E.
Stone of the Great Northern Steam
ship and Navigation Company for a
two weeks' tour beginning December
1G and lasting until December 31.
Sailing from San Francisco imme
diately after "ex week," the club will
go to Los Angeles where members
will spend several days and give at

least one concert. From here they
will sail directly to Hilo and after
visiting the famous Hilo volcanoes,
will proceed on to Honolulu where
they will give their principal con
certs. This will he the longest trip
that the Glee Club has ever taken and
marks a change in the policy of re
stricting audiences to those of the Pa
cific Coast. Members of the club who
will make the trip have not as yet
been announced, but it is expected
that between thirty-five and forty
men will go.
