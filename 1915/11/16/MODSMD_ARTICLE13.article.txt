# PROSPECTS FOR OPEN AIR THEATER ARE PROMISING
## MR. STOW IS ENTHUSIASTIC Representatives of Dramatic Clubs to Meet Friday for Discussion 
### 
The open air theater project is
booming. The present interest in the
idea of an outdoor theater points to
the building of such a structure in
the very near future. Yesterday af
ternoon a meeting of the representa
tives of various entertainment soci
eties was attended by Vanderlynn
Stow, treasurer of the Hoard of Trus
tees. Mr. Stow is enthusiastic for the
immediate construction of a suitable
building. When approached Friday
morning by members of the committee
who had been discussing the possi
bility of an outdoor theater, he was
eager to meet with the entire mem
bership of both committees.
Suggest Architectural Arrangement
At yesterday's meeting, Herman
Rosse of Stanford Park was also pres
ent and made several suggestions for
the architectural arrangement of the
theater. Another meeting of repre
sentatives of the campus dramatic so
cieties will take place Friday after
noon in room 210 of the English build
ing. Mr. Stow will again be present
and will outline a plan for the Trus
tees' support in the construction of
an outdoor theater which will be in
keeping with the rest of the univer
sity buildings. To supplement Mr.
Stow's proposals for ways and means
toward getting a theater for Stanford
which shall be a feature in working
toward the campus beautiful as well
as a prominent factor in the life of
the university, Mr. Rosse will again
attend to give suggestions for the style
of the building. He is well known
iie.re for his work in decorating the
Holland building at the exposition.
