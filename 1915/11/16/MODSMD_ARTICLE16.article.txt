Stanford teams have crossed the
water and made athletic history on
the Hawaiian Islands and in the Far
East on many occasions in recenl
years, but never "since the mind ol
man runneth not to the contrary," has
a Stanford musical organization at
tempted to leave the Pacific Coast
Tt is to be hoped that this year's trip
planned to Honolulu by the Glee Clut
marks a new era and may be extended
in the future.
Stanford Glee Club has journeyed tc
the more distant parts of California
and to the neighboring states on its
trips during the Christmas holidays
and has received merited praise from
its audiences on these occasions
Lack of finances prevented more am
bitious plans which would make the
Glee Club equally well known and
well praised in other lands from being
carried into effect.
Congratulations are due the man
agement of the club for the success
of their efforts in arranging for the
appearances in Honolulu this year
May the trip be portent ous for the
future. â€”Contributed.
