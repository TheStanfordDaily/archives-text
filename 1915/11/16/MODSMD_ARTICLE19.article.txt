# Notable Athletic Critics Favor Rugby Over Old Game
## 
### 
Reports on the Big dame in several
prominent newspapers show that the
critics of note are gradually turning
back to rugby, if their sympathies
were ever in any other direction.
Charles A. Home of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle says, 'There was a
double punch for Stanford in winning
'the' Big Came, when the Blue and
Gold had lost to Washington by a 72
to 0 score. The old graduate who pre
fers the old game was taught a lesson
Saturday. It was an effective demon
stration when the two grammar school
teams played a "pigmy game." When
the grammar school boys are playing
this rugby, what hope is there of the
old game coming back. We do not
need it. Rugby has been established."

Raymond S. Bartlett of the same
paper says, "Saturday's game was a
vindication of rugby's might, and in
no small way. The spectators got
everything; speed, strength, plenty of
old game tackling, and enough excel
lent punting to satisfy any one who
played football under the fighting
leadership of Brickley."

Douglas Erskine of the San Fran
cisco Examiner says that Saturday's
game was one of the finest exhibi
tions of football (not just rugby, but
football); a mighty contrast from
opinion expressed in the criticism of
the American game, recently played at
Berkeley, by the same writer.
Not Close, Mussy Playing:
Helen Dare says, "Simply immense,
none of this close, mussy playing, but
real clean sport."
William Unmack says, "30 to 0 is
not indicative of the play. It was a
real Big (lame."
Dr. Frank Angell places the game
with Santa Clara before the recent
Stanford-California contests in both
the type of football played and in the
spirit of the rival teams on the field.
"It was the first time in eight or nine
years that the Big Game rivals
cheered each other before they left
the field. I have never seen Stanford
and California teams go off the field
together, but the two teams left in
one bunch last Saturday. In real
sportsmanship the contest exceeded
former Big Games."
