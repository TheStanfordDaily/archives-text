Portraits and monotypes by Celia
Seymour and Shirley Williamson are
now on exhibition in the Old Studio
at the end of the ear line. Mrs. Sey
mour's pastel studies cover a wide
range of portrait subjects. Her strik
ing study of Otis Skinner as the beg
gar in "Kismet" is perhaps the strong
est piece of her exhibited work. The
portrait of the musician and settle
ment worker, Charles Mannes of New
York, is sympathetically handled.
"Haby Mary Edna" is a charmingly
fresh child study.
The monotype process which is used
in making Miss Williamson's land
scape studies is one comparatively
new in art. The monotypes of Clark
Hobart on exhibit in the Fine Arts
Palace at the exposition are some of
the best examples we have of this
type of work.
These monotypes are made by paint
ing on copper or zinc plates and then,
while the paint is still wet. transfer
ing the impression on to paper. They
may also be painted in the first place
on canvas, and very artistic effects
are obtained through the use of this
medium. The very nature of the pro
cess admits of but one impression be
ing made. The work must be done
within an hour, for if a longer time
than that is consumed in making the
original picture, the paint will dry
and will not be transferable. Miss
Williamson's monotypes are colorfully
pleasing. Some of her studies of
trees are especially attractive.
