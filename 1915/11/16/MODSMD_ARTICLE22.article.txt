Introduction
Willie Smith's mother's .back yard
was butted up against Jimmie Jones'
mother's back yard. As a matter of
fact, Mrs. Smith's clothes line fas
tened onto the same post as did Mrs.
Jones' clothes line. In other words,
the Smith family and the Jones fam
ily were the best of friends.
Prelude
Willie Smith and Jimmie Jones

gether and fought each other in a
friendly fashion until one day Jimmie
told Willie that he (Willie) would
have to quit putting "dobie" marbles
in the ring against his (Jimmie's
"crockies."
Whereupon Willie told Jimmie that
he (Jimmie) could go to thunder.
Jimmie, did, and went over to play
"Keeps" in a big ring with Billie Wil
liams. Willie continued to play
"keeps" in a little ring, now with
Petie Wilson.
