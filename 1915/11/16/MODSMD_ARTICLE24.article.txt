# Rumor of Return to American By Stanford Is Unfounded
## Graduate Manager Denies Report That Stanford Will Meet Oregon Colleges in Football 
### 
Graduate Manager Behrens this af
ternoon denied the truth of a rumor
coming from Portland that arrange
ments had been made for the return
of Stanford to American football. A
press report to San Francisco from
the Oregon city, received this morn
ing, stated that "belief is prevalent
here that Stanford University will re
turn to American football."
"This statement is absolutely false,"
said Behrens. "We have made ar
rangements to meet the Oregon Uni
versity in baseball next spring, but
nothing was ever done in regard to
football."
It is believed that the Portland dis
patch was based on the statement is
sued by Physical Director Stewart of
the Oregon Agricultural College,
which stated that Stanford had ar
ranged for athletic competition with
Oregon institutions and that plans for
a new Pacific Coast athletic confer
ence were under way, and would have
to be brought before the Northwestern
Conference in December.
The Stanford competition with the
northern universities pertains only to
track and baseball. Behrens made ar
rangements for these contests while
on the trip to the northwest last sum
mer.
