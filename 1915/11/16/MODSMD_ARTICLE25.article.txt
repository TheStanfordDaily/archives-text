under-currents and secret motives
governing the big and little govern
ments of Europe than any American
living. If you want to know anything
aliout the secret purposes, the secret
corruptions, the jealousies and rival
ries; in fact, if you want to know
anything about "invisible government"
in Europe ask David Starr Jordan,
and he can tell you, and he will not
waste any words in the process. He
is a Wendell Phillips as an agitator,
with mo,re philosophy in his agitation.
He is a sentinel on the house tops,
taking a survey of slow, plodding civ
ilization. In his assaults upon war he
is a 42-centimeter gun. He can tell
the story of the destructiveness of war,
and its evil inlluences better than any
man living. He knows the by-paths
of Europe. He has solved the mys
teries of the Balkans, and this is a
life work. He can tell you why a cer
tain little country doesn't go into a
certain alliance. He can trace the
relationships on thrones and point out
the influence of wives and queens.
David Star.r Jordan is a man you
do not meet every day. He is a big
man physically, and a giant mentally.
