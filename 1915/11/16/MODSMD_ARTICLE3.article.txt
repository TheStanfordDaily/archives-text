# WHISKY TRIPLES POLES "WHY NOT EGGS?" ASK WISCONSIN PROFESSORS
## 
### 
If whiskey will cause a man to
seo three telephone poles where be
fore there was only one, why won't
it cause a hen to lay three eggs in
one day?
Reasoning along this line, profes
sors at the University of Wisconsin
are experimenting with treating a
number of hens to Scotch whiskey
(straight) in an attempt to settle
the controversy which has arisen
over this point.
Everything seems to be in favor
of the plan working out per sche
dule, as the resemblance of tele
phone poles and eggs is very
marked. The big question arises
as to whether the hens would ac
tually lay three eggs, o.r whether
they would only imagine that they
had laid that many. In case the
latter proves to he true, it is sug
gested that the professors also
drink some Scotch and join the
hens in the new indoor sport known
as "one times one bottle makes
three."
