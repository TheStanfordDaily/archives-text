# MATRICULATION PLEDGE DAY ACCEPTED BY PAN-HELLENIC
## LAWYER SYSTEM TO BE USED Will Necessitate Summer Rushing and Early Return of Women to Campus 
### 
Sorority rushing on the campus has
been changed from the three weeks'
formal rushing with bidding day at
tlie end of tlie third week, to matricu
lation day pledge. Under the new sys
tem, Which will be inaugurated next
September, part of the rushing will
have been accomplished during the
summer, part in the few days before
registration, and that which follows
will be informal, and will lack that
strain on all concerned which accom
panied former seasons.
The lawyer system will be used in
bidding. Each new student who has
received one or more bids will be
asked by a lawyer, or some other neu
tral person, to be chosen by Pan-
Hellenic, to write out a list of houses
she would like to join, in order of
preference, and she will receive her
bid of highest preference, and will be
given no information concerning bids
from other houses.
A commission, composed of Dr. J. C.
Hranner, Dr. D. C. Gardner, Professor
F. C. Woodward, Mrs. P. J. Treat, Mrs.
H. J. Ryan. Miss E. L. Buckingham,
and Mrs. J. F. Merrill, was delegated
by Pan-Hellenic to consider plans for
a new system which had previously
been drawn up by all the houses, and
find some suitable substitute for the
undesirable one of last year.
Matriculation pledge day will be
given a trial next year, and if found
to be desirable will be used in future
years.
The details of the system have not
been worked out as yet but will be
settled at the meeting next Monday,
after reports from the committees in
vestigating tbe lawyer system have
Veen made.
