"Tux" is the happy smoke. It just packs the
smoker's calendar so plumb full of fragrant delight
that a gloomy day can't crowd itself in edgewise.
That mild, soothing taste of " Tux" has introduced
many a man to the joy of pipe-smoking and a regular
unending procession of happy days.

CJ The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
By far the most pleasant pipe-smoke in the world is
Tuxedo. Think of the supreme satisfaction of being able
to smoke your pipe all day, and day after day, without a
particle of discomfortl You can do it with Tuxedo—be
cause Tuxedo is made wonderfully mild and absolutely
biteless by the original "Tuxedo Process."
That process is what makes Tuxedo different from any
other tobacco made. Others have tried to imitate it, but
never successfully. Just try Tuxedo for a week and you'll
smoke it ever after.
