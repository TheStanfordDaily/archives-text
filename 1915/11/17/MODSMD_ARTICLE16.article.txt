The desired interest in the proposed
open air theater has been awakened
in individuals and organizations out
side of the student body and faculty of
the university.
The Board of Trustees are for the
project and are willing to aid in fur
thering it. Vanderlynn Stow, treas
urer of the Hoard, attended the last
meeting of the representatives of the
societies interested, and is enthusi
astic for the immediate construction
of a suitable building. He is eager to
discuss plans for the structure.
Herman Rosse, an alumnus of the
university who designed the Holland
building at the exposition, is another
booster for the open air theater who
has been willing to give overt expres
sion to his enthusiasm by joining in
the discussion of plans at the last
meeting of representatives.
Effective organization has been
made by university bodies for the fur
therance of the project. What re
mains now is the real work of carry
ing plans and projects into effect. Mr.
Rosse and Mr. Stow will again be
present at the meeting next Friday af
ternoon to give suggestions to the
committee in charge.
The open air theater has ceased to
he a possibility for a future Stanford
student body. It can be realized im
mediately and be ready for use before
the oldest of us go out into the cold
world. Now is tho time to put plans
into execution. And it can be done—
everybody's willing.
