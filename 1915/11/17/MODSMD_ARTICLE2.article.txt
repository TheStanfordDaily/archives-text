# RUSSIAN LECTURES
## Horrors of Siberia Pictured By Escaped Prisoner 
### 
In the uniform and chains of his Si
berian prison, Lieutenant Swartzko
pensky, one of a little band of five
who survived the desperate break for
liberty made by fourteen rebels from
Siberia, last night told the story of
his fearful experiences and revealed
the mechanism of the Russian govern
ment before an audience that packed
the chapel to capacity.
Sou of Revolutionist
The son of a revolutionist who was
put to death by the government for his
opinions, and himself sentenced to life
imprisonment because of bis refusal
to fire on a starving mob led by Max
im Gorki, Swartzkopensky was able
to give a startling revelation of the
Russian militarist and spy system, and
his story of the treatment of Jews in
Russia was worthy of Zangwill. His
personal anecdotes of the greatest fig
ure in Russian literature, Tolstoi, and
of the revolutionist, Gorki, formed one
of the most interesting elements in
the lecture.
French to Speak Thursday
The Sociology Club, who arranged
for Swartzkopensky's visit wishes to
announce that on Thursday evening.
W. J. French of San Francisco, will
speak on "Industrial Accidents and
Their Prevention," in room 228, Eng
lish building. The lecture promises
to he one of interest to the university
at large, and particularly to those stu
dents interested in the betterment of
existing labor conditions in our great
cities.
