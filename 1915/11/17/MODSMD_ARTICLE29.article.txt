# EASTERN EDUCATOR URGES CULTURE IN FRATERNITY
## Exhorts Such Organizations to Direct Energies in More Varied Channels 
### 
Dr. L. If. Harris, instructor of Eng
lish at the University of Illinois, is
the author of an interesting article
appearing recently in one of the load
ing magazines. The article is enti
tled "Culture and the College Fra
ternity," and deals with the lack of
culture influence which the fraternity
exercises on its members.
He says that some fraternities "go
in for athletics, society, and politics;
but," he asks, "how many go in for
culture?"
His article ends with an exhortation
for the fraternity, "the strongest and
most close-knit of college organiza
tions," to transform its potential
forces into active dynamic energy di
rected toward culture."
