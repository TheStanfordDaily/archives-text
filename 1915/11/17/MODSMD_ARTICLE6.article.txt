## CAUGHEY AND PELOUZE OUT Freshman Team Practicing for Meet With Alameda High School on Saturday 
### 
Coach Brandsten's swimming squad
lias been considerably strengthened
by tbe addition of a number of men
who have heretofore (levotod their ac
tivities to rugby, and the work of de
veloping a good all-around team is
progressing rapidly. Despite the cold
weather of late, swimming continues
to be exceedingly popular, due to the
heating of the water in the tank.
Weather conditions will not greatly
interfere with the continuation of the
tank sport, training being continued
throughout the year.
\e>v Recruits Are Fast
Two of the most promising of the
new recruits to the swimming squad
are Reg Caughey, front ranker on the
freshman football team, and Bobby Pe
louze, freshman captain and back field
star. Both are good men in the
sprints.
F.reshmen members of the squad are
busy this week training for the meet
with the Alameda high school team on
Saturday afternoon, while the entire
number of men out for swimming are
preparing for the Santa Clara contest
planned for the following week.
Kntire Squad to he on Hand
A number of the best varsity swim
mers this season a.re freshmen, and
tbe nineteeners promise to give the
Alameda team a hard contest. The
other members of the varsity team
will be on hand Saturday, but will not
be used in the outside meet. They
will, however, run off a contest among
themselves. The three Olympic Club
stars who will give exhibitions during
the freshman-Alameda meet have not
been definitely selected, but will prob
ably be Ernie Smith, Ludy Langer and
George Cunha.
