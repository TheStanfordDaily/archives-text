# FINANCIAL STATUS OF STUDENT BODY IS SOUND
## SWIMMING NEWEXPENSE ITEM Graduate Manager Satisfied With Big Game Attendance and Receipts 
### 
January 1 of the new year will find
the Associated Student Body treasury
in 'a sound and healthy condition,"
says Graduate Manager E. C. Behrens,
"though we will not be as well off as
we have been in some previous years.
"We are facing a problem of finance
that will prove a critical one for the
university. This is brought about by
several conditions. First and most im
portant, of course, is the break with
California. Neither Stanford nor Cali
fornia will enjoy the same dividends
as have been split between the two
universities in past years. However,
from all reports that I have received,
1 am led to believe that we have
weathered the storm, financially, much
better than has California. Certainly,
we are in the lead in other ways.
Have Practiced Economy
"We have had to cut in expenses
this year, and have made a good start
by economizing in rugby equipment,
though nothing has been sacrificed
that was essential to the team. How
ever. we have had to support swim
ming and soccer from the treasury
with no income from those sports. In
time swimming will probably be self
supporting. but while it is being es
tablished as a minor sport, it will be
a steady though not unusually heavy
drain on the treasury.
Nearly 17,000 at llitr flume
"Then, too, there have been ex
penses in the line of advertising the
Big Game that we did not have before.
However, it proved a good investment,
as can be seen by the crowd which
saw the Stanford-Santa Clara game.
It was numbered between fifteen and
seventeen thousand, and estimates
from experts in the city place the at
tendance at the Big Game at least one
thousand more than that of the Cali
fornia-Washington same one week be
fore. I believe that ou,r final check
in this office will substantiate those
figures.
Sending Crew Fast
"As to the future â€”we will have'suf
fieient money to support the teams in
the usual fashion, though we cannot
be extravagant. We must figure on
sending the crew east next summer,
an additional expense this year. We
cannot expect much money from the
baseball season, though track is very
promising, for we have several good
meets scheduled.
Full Depreciation in Report
"The Graduate Manager's report for
this year will probably show a de
crease in funds of the student body for
the reason that we have made a more
careful inventory than ever before.
Depreciation has been taken off prac
tically every bit of property that the
student body owns, that we could have
a sounder estimate of our actual
financial standing. This will not look
well, coming at this critical time, I
admit, but 1 believe that we will be
better off if our inventory is slightly
under value, than if it is inflated.
Full Schedule .Mnv Shut Out I*. C.
"If we are ever to agree with Cali
fornia and re-establish athletic rela
tions, 112 believe it must be done this
year. By the end of the year we will
have made agreements with other col
leges that will fill our schedule. We
i are now well able to continue without
relations with California, in so far as
finances are concerned, though we
cannot be too careful for the first year
or two.
"Another shortage in income was
brought about by the popular prices
for tickets to this year's Big Game.
This means a decrease of ten to twelve
thousand dollars in gate receipts, and
it will cut materially into the budget
i we make up for the rest of the sports
at the end of the football season."
