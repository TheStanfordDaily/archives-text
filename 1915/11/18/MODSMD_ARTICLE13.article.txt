# DAVID STARR JORDAN MAY LEAVE FOR BERNE
## URGED TO ATTEND CONGRESS Peace Advocates from Every Country to Convene at Swiss Capital 
### 
Chancellor Jordan will probably
leave New York for Switzerland about
the first of next month to attend the
International -Peace Congress which
will meet in Berne during the month
of December. Newspaper dispatches
recently quoted Dr. Jofllan as saying
that if not officially represented, the
United States will have prominent
peace delegates present when the
cause of world peace is furthered at
the gathering in the Swiss capital. A
telegram received here indicates that
Dr. Jordan will be one of those who
will take the trans-Atlantic journey.
May Make Two Trips
Mrs. Jordan, who recently returned
from a visit with Knight Jordan, '10,
at Provo, Utah, today declared that
she has heard nothing definite in re
gard to Chancellor Jordan's European
trip. Mrs. Jordan expressed the opin
ion that Dr. Jordan will not attend
the convention that will take the first
tentative steps toward peace, if he can
avoid it. Tt is Mrs. Jordan's belief
that he would prefer being present
when the final stages are reached.
However, Chancellor Jordan is being
urged from all sides to attend. Should
he leave for Rerne in December, he
will again make the journey when
final peace matters come up.
Xoted Advocates to Attend
Prominent peave advocates from
many quarters of the globe will con
vene in the Swiss capital. Dr. Louis
P. Lochner, recently at Stanford, Fan
nie Fern Andrews, prominent interna
tional figure in peace and education,
and Jane Addams, are some of those
who are sure to attend.
In the event that Chancellor Jordan
postpones the convention voyage, he
will return to the west about Decem
ber 15.
