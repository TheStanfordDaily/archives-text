# "Union Hours"
## 
### 
This is addressed to faculty men.
When we were freshmen and heard
about a proposed Stanford Union for
the first time, some of the things we
heard were that the Union would be
a place where all of the men of the
University, both faculty and students,
would come together on a common
ground, and where they could be
joined by alumni when they drift
back to the campus. The trustees
were to come in, too, and then the four
sides of the quadrangle of Stanford
life would be represented at the Union
which was to belong to all Stanford
men.
And then when the Union was ready
we heard the same sentiments on the
night when it was formally opened. It
was emphasized that these were the
ideas of Herbert C. Hoover as a part
of his plan to have the Union bring
back to Stanford the old democracy
of the days of the pioneers.
But this is addressed to faculty men
and we are wandering. Some of you
have made it a point to spend a part
of your time at the Union and for you
we have all praise. The rest we urge
to follow this example. The Union
will only become a common meeting
place for faculty and students when
the faculty and students meet there.
This is a truism that may have been
overlooked.
We have the very highest praise foi
the faculty man who has announced
regular hours when he may be seen
at the Union daily. If a goodly num
ber of you would do this, there is little
doubt that the ideal of the Father of
the Stanford Union would be realized.
And there's one other thing we
might say. We have noticed a ten
dency for the faculty men who come to
the Union to clique together. That is
a good thing in its place, but its place
is the Faculty Club House. If we were
going to complain of this we'd have to
address the students as well as you,
for they are equally to blame. So we
won't —but it's a tendency to be
avoided.
