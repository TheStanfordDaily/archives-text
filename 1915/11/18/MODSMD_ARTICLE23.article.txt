## 
### 
W. H. Shockley of Palo Alto gave a
lecture on "Siberia" last night before
the members of the Geology and Min
ing Society at the Theta Delta Chi
house. Mr. Sliockey was sent out by a
London company to investigate re
ported gold fields along the Siberian
coast similar to the gold fields of
Alaska. The lecture which was illus
trated by the stereopticon dealt with
this investigation.
