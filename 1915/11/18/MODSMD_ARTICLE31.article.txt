# CHANCELLOR'S NEW BOOK WILL POINT WAY OUT OF WAR
## "The Great War Must End In a Draw" Is Decision of Struggle's Futility 
### 
Chancellor Jordan's next venture
Into bookland will be the publication
by Bobbs-Merril Co., of "Ways to Last
ing Peace." This volume of nearly
35,000 words will be for the most part
made up of a selection of many plans
that have come to L)r. Jordan from in
terested persons who hope to point out
the way to everlasting peace among
the nations of the world.
Although "Ways to Lasting Peace"
is the topic of a lecture deliv
j ered on October 10 at the International
Congress in San Francisco, the vol
ume will contain a vastly greater
amount of material than was ever
crowded into one speech. At this lec
ture Chancellor Jordan spoke without
notes, covering lightly part of the
ground that he had taken up in his
work.
In the first few pages of "Ways to
Lasting Peace" the writer, with
characteristic definiteness and frank
ness, pictures the problem that will
confront the world at the close of the
European conflict. Dr. Jordan says,
in part:
War's End Means Struggle
"At the end of the war we shall have
without doubt the greatest intellec
tual and political struggle since the
reformation. On the one hand will be
those who hope to continue the old
war system; on the other, those who
will wish to bring Europe into some
government of a federation in which
armaments will be reduced, and in
which individual states will cooperate
instead of tormenting and defying one
another."
Cannot Continue Old System
"To continue the old is impossible
—it has fallen by its own weight. It
is certain that the Treaty of Peace
will not settle all of the problems
which the war has raised and empha
sized. It may not settle any of them."
(■rent Duty Wests 011 Youth
"The young men of Europe and
America have resting on their shoul
ders the most important duty of many
centuries—the duty of bringing free
dom to the suppressed people of a con
tinent and of bringing lasting security
to a crippled world.
"The peace of contentment finds the
ideal in intellectual and physical re
pose; the absence of discordant fac
tors, and the harmony of life."
Armed l'eace Is Kalanced llate
"The armed peace is a condition of
balanced hate, the peace which comes
at the cessation of war. In its na
ture this has more of war, than of
peace. Real peace is found in the
permanence of law."
War Must End in Draw
"To bring the war to a close by any
process is one of the most difficult
undertakings which we can conceive.
Cnless some unforseen element ap
pears, the great war must end in a
draw."

peace. Real peace is found in the
permanence of law."
War Must End in Draw
"To bring the war to a close by any
process is one of the most difficult
undertakings which we can conceive.
Cnless some unforseen element ap
pears, the great war must end in a
draw."
Chancellor Jordan's next venture
Into bookland will be the publication
by Bobbs-Merril Co., of "Ways to Last
ing Peace." This volume of nearly
35,000 words will be for the most part
made up of a selection of many plans
that have come to L)r. Jordan from in
terested persons who hope to point out
the way to everlasting peace among
the nations of the world.
Although "Ways to Lasting Peace"
is the topic of a lecture deliv
j ered on October 10 at the International
Congress in San Francisco, the vol
ume will contain a vastly greater
amount of material than was ever
crowded into one speech. At this lec
ture Chancellor Jordan spoke without
notes, covering lightly part of the
ground that he had taken up in his
work.
In the first few pages of "Ways to
Lasting Peace" the writer, with
characteristic definiteness and frank
ness, pictures the problem that will
confront the world at the close of the
European conflict. Dr. Jordan says,
in part:
War's End Means Struggle
"At the end of the war we shall have
without doubt the greatest intellec
tual and political struggle since the
reformation. On the one hand will be
those who hope to continue the old
war system; on the other, those who
will wish to bring Europe into some
government of a federation in which
armaments will be reduced, and in
which individual states will cooperate
instead of tormenting and defying one
another."
Cannot Continue Old System
"To continue the old is impossible
—it has fallen by its own weight. It
is certain that the Treaty of Peace
will not settle all of the problems
which the war has raised and empha
sized. It may not settle any of them."
(■rent Duty Wests 011 Youth
"The young men of Europe and
America have resting on their shoul
ders the most important duty of many
centuries—the duty of bringing free
dom to the suppressed people of a con
tinent and of bringing lasting security
to a crippled world.
"The peace of contentment finds the
ideal in intellectual and physical re
pose; the absence of discordant fac
tors, and the harmony of life."
Armed l'eace Is Kalanced llate
"The armed peace is a condition of
balanced hate, the peace which comes
at the cessation of war. In its na
ture this has more of war, than of
peace. Real peace is found in the
permanence of law."
War Must End in Draw
"To bring the war to a close by any
process is one of the most difficult
undertakings which we can conceive.
Cnless some unforseen element ap
pears, the great war must end in a
draw."
