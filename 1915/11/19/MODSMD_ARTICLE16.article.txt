# ANNUAL UNDERCLASS RUSH REGULATED BY CONFERENCE
## DEFINITE RULES ARE ADOPTED Low Scholarship of Freshmen Is Discussed With View to Improvement 
### 
Definite rules to govern the under
class fights of the future were adopted
by the Student Conference at its meet
ing last evening. Following a report
of the the committee appointed to look
into the matter of regulating hostili
ties between the sophomores and fresh
men, it was voted to accept the recom
mendations of this body without
amendment.
liules in Detail
The .rules as adopted are: First,
hostilities shall not commence before
the Monday night preceding registra
tion and shall not continue after the
annual tie-up rush; second, no tear
ing or stripping of clothes will be
tolerated; third, all night fights shall
terminate at daybreak; and fourth,
the two classes shall assemble on the
Monday preceding the opening of hos
tilities and receive Instructions from
the student adviser concerning the
conduct of the rushes. These rules
are accepted in order to mitigate the
evident evils which have sprung up
during the last few years in connec
tion with the fights.
Low Scholarship Discussed
The causes fo.r the extremely low
scholarship of the freshman class and
means to improve conditions were
discussed. It is thought that the poor
record has been brought about to a
great extent by the fact that so many
freshmen and transfers live off the
campus. About forty-five per cent of
all the new men in the university have
rooms in Palo Alto or other neigh
boring towns and about fifty per cent
of all the double smoke-lips went to
these men. A committee consisting of
W. P. Staniford. '16, W. F. Noonan, '16,
R. N. Wenzel, '16, G. C. Collins, '17,
and W. H. Stammer, '14, chairman,
was appointed to secure further infor
mation on the matter, and, if this is
actually the cause of the slump in
scholarship, to recommend some plan
to get the men on the campus where
they may be more closely watched.
