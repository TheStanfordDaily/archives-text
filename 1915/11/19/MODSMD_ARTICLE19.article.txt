# "Hearts and Flowers"
## 
### 
The flowers that bloom in the spring
are entirely out of the question, and
even if this were not a fact, it would
be none the less a breach of good
form for dancers to sport anything
but artificial floral decorations at the
approaching cotillion. Besides artifi
cial roses are the denier cris this
season.
With the annual sophomore ball but
five days distant, it is high time for
us to warn all new "farm hands" and
any old ones that are given to back
sliding, against what they may think
is essential to a formal dance, namely:
flowers and carriages.
Once a year the sophomores break
into the social limelight and have
their little fling. They are going to
have it Wednesday evening at the Gym,
so let's all help them have it right.
They say that there shall be no flow
ers or carriages at the cotillion, and
they have the right idea. There will
be no departure next Wednesday from
the tradition of former years, for this
is a custom in which there is no room
for improvement. • The Farm is no
place for frills.
If this we.re a modern Utopia we
would not be registering our annual
warning. But alas, there are those of
us who would be obliged to walk to
Palo Alto for a month if flowers and
carriages were the vogue. Therefore,
those who roll in wealth, we bag to
save your money for vacation. And,
come to think of it, how many orchids
would it take to put you on the list of
Paly pedestrians yourself?
