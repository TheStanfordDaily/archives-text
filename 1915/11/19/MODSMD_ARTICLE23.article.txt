Stanford TJ., Nov. 19, 1915.
Dearest Ma—My weakly letter.
Your letter scolding me for not writ
ins received today. 1 felt quite badly
about it. But then I found your check
enclosed; everything's o-kay with me
now, ma. How is it with you? You
see it was this way—exams are com
ing, and before getting ready to study
for them, I had to do a bit of stuff that
slipped my memory last month. Back
work, they call it up here. That's a
good name because if you don't get
the dope finished, you're set back. To
morrow there's going to be a big
swimming meet and the women are
going to be allowed among those pres
ent. I hate to think what that's going
to do to all existing records. Take a
hike back through the years and de
cades, ma, and remember how you and
your heart quickened their pace when
you saw your husband-to-be-maybe
enter upon the scene. Quite an accel
eration, yeh bo! Then elasticize your
imagination and think of a guy swim
ming with his fairest little fairy a. t. p.
If I can run the quarter in 62 alone —I
ought to be able to do it in 2(5 if some
girls were among those present.
Think you not so? If you was going
to be here and F was going to swim—
enuf sed! I wish you and me all kinds
of happiness. Write and send another
check to your
SONNY.
