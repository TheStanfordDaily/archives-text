A correspondent signing himself
"Football Fan" has come out in the
Bulletin to ask the gentle reader why
he let himself be led into believing the
second Washington-California game
wasn't just a political move to keep
the American game from celebrating
its own funeral at California. He says
—but let him speak for himself:
(From The Bulletin.)
Sporting Editor, The Bulletin. Sir —
Of course the most interesting thing in
the world today is the war. But if
the war can be sidetracked for just a
minute or two the next most interest
ing thing , in California, at least, is
the stupid campaign that is being
waged against that splendid sport—
rugby football.
The said campaign was running its
normal course when the first Wash
ington-California party was given over
at Berkeley. The utter annihilation
of the Bears had its expected psycho
logical effect. Not four days elapsed
before a considerable body of student
opinion was complaining that the
break with Stanford had been engi
neered by one Stroud during the sum
mer vacation, and that rugby had been
eliminated by the mere flat of the same
gentleman during the same vacation
—and all "without the consent of the
governed," the students.
And this, of course, was quite cor
rect, except that Stroud shouldn't have
been singled out for all the blame.
There are higher-ups.
It was an open, glaring and appar
ent fact that 72-0 had almost annihi
lated the campaign against rugby.
Something had to be done. The sec
ond game with Washington couldn't
be abandoned. Its abandonment would
mean a loss of prestige greater than
an abandonment of Gallioli. And in
the little campaign here loss of pres
tige would have a tremendous effect
on the general situation. On the other
hand, anothe.r Californian debacle
would settle the issue. What was to
be done?
13-7!
Did anyone—lawyer, diplomat, sol
dier or statesman—ever pull off such
a clever coup de theater in the whole
of his checkered career? Surely a
Frenchman would say that this was a
"geste Beiiinois."
And, sir, will it get by? Is that por
tion of the great American people liv
ing in this state so gullible that even
THAT can be put over on it?
I have seen every American inter
collegiate contest between California
and Stanford, beginning in 1597 and
ending in 1905, most of the prelimi
nary games of those seasons, and all
the after-season games, and I saw that
Washington team plow through for
its eleven touchdowns, and when you
tell me that California, one week later,
held that steam roller to 13-7 I un
hesitatingly say, "bunk, bunk, and
bunk again!"
If any of the old-timers, such as
Percy Hall, "Wreck" Womble, "Loco
motive" Smith, "Pete" Kaarsberg,
Charley Fickert. Chet Murphy, et al.,
actually saw the 72-0 affair, it would
be interesting to get their expert opin
ions as to whether the California team
could possibly have held Washington
to a 13-7 score just seven days later,
two of which days were spent in travel
to Seattle.
You are to be congratulated on the
"benevolent neutrality" you have
maintained for rugby. It is to be
hoped that Stanford and Santa Clara
stick it out, and that they administer
to Berkeley the sound licking she de
serves when she is brought back into
the fold. She is big enough to stand
it, and it will do her good. Yours, etc.,
FOOTBALL FAX.
