# NEW PALO ALTO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA HAKES FIRST BOW
## Musical Organization Is Ambitions in Program Presented in Assembly Hall 
### 
Making a very creditable attempt to
present a most ambitious program,
the Palo Alto Symphony Orchestra
| made its second annual how before
the local public last evening in the
Assembly Hall. The workers for and
in this orchestra are to be congratu
lated. Their work has improved per
ceptibly since last year; their efforts
to give the people of Palo Alto the best
within their power are commendable.
In last evening's concert, the ab
sence of numbers which are usually
rated to be within the reach of ama
teurs was notable. This young or
ganization, led by John Kimber, '17,
has chosen to aim high and all credit
is due it in the effort. Rut there is
such a thing as overweighing a pro
gram with heavy numbers, and if the
Palo Alto Symphony Orchestra may
lie said to have erred in any direction
it is in this.
Last evening's performance was,
however, certainly a step in a laud
able direction, and the movement has
been carried on with sincerity and
earnestness.
