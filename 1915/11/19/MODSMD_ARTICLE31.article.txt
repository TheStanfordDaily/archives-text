# JUNIORS MUST HAVE QUAD PICTURES BY DECEMBER 1
## Organizations Should Reserve Space Immediately and Have Pictures Taken Before February 
### 
Over two hundred and fifty of the
junior class members have had their
Quad pictures taken to date. There
are still some pictures to be taken,
however, and Quad Manager Hews has
made the announcement that the date
by which the pictures must be in has
been set at December 1.
Organizations wishing space in the
annual must make application for the
amount required before December 1.
Organization pictures must be in be
fore February 1, but any which can
be taken at once should be turned in
as soon as possible. The earlier the
photos are in, the smaller will be the
possibility of errors occurring on ac
count of the unavoidable rush near
publication time.
