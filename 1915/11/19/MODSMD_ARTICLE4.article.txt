# Nickel Crawl to Pay for New Men's Dorm; Dance Excites Encina
## 
### 
A nickel crawl for a new men's
dormitory!
This is a startling statement.
A new men's "dorm"? But con
tinue.
The new men's dormitory is not
to supplement or augment or tor
ment Encina, hut merely for the or
phans of the Maud Booth Home, of
South Palo Alto.
Nickel crawls have proven popu
lar. In fact, a well known scientist
says this is the age of the nickel
crawl. We used to crawl across
the floor for a nickel when we were
very young. We can crawl across a
hardwood floor to our heart's con
tent next Tuesday evening, at Ra
mona hall. The nickels will help
the building of a boys' "dorm" at
the Maud Booth Home.
Tuesday, in fact, will be Maud
Booth day.in the afternoon Mrs.
Leonard T. Ely will give a song
recital at four o'clock. In the even
ing everybody will danceâ€”for a
nickel a dance.
A committee consisting of the fol
lowing are to have charge of the
evening: Misses Bob Shelton, '18,
Dorothy Le Seur, 'IS, Marie de For
est, '16, Madeline Evans of Palo Alto,
Stella Connelly, '16, Margaret
Evans, '17.
