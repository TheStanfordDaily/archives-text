# TEN STANFORD RUGGERS NAMED AS NATIONAL STARS
## RUGBY UNION PICKS RIVALS All American-All British Match Will Hold Forth on Marina Next Thursday 
### 
At a meeting of the California Rug
by Union, held last night at the Olym
pic Club in San Francisco, the com
mittee on selecting teams to meet in
the All-American-All-British clash at
the Exposition on Thanksgiving day,
chose thirty ruggers of well known
worth to fill the coveted positions.
Stanford is exceedingly well repre
sented on both teams, six Cardinal
players being picked for the All-Brit
ish fifteen, while four Stanford men
will play on the All-American line-up.
Four former Stanford men will wear
the all-star shields. Both teams are
strong and apparently well balanced.
Best of all, they seem to be evenly
matched, the American team probably
having the stronger backfleld, while
the Britishers excell in the forwards.
The line-ups for the all-star game
will be as follows, although subject to
change by the committee:
All - American — Forwards, Soper,
O'Neil, O'Laine, Bloeser, Rehm, Hick
ey, and Guerin; backs, Walker, Aus
tin, Lachmund, Fitzpatrick, Milburn,
Kirksey, and Montgomery.
All-British —Forwards, Bate, Flan
agan, Cashel, Braden, Wvlie, Pye, and
Walton; backs, Erb, Ric Templeton,
Hawks, Carroll, Higgins, Stolz, and
Dink Templeton.
It will be noticed that there are only
seven men picked as forwards. The
committee will choose the other two
men today.
