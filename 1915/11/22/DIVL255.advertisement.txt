Roll Your Own!"
A fresh hand-rolled cigarette of "Bull" Durham
makes a smoke that's as lively and brisk as a pure
ivory billiard ball. "Bull" Durham has the alert, healthy,
youthful taste —the snap and sparkle that give the
punch to a cigarette. That's why so many more
thousands of live smokers have become "roll-your
own" enthusiasts during the last few years.
