### 
"Ideals are structural and benefi
cent," said Rabbi Stephen A. Wise of
the Free Synagogue, New York, in his
so.rnion in the Memorial church yes
terday. The subject of the sermon
was "Ideals and Idealists," and a jus
tiflcation of these was given in a con
vincing style.
"The most hopelessly impractical
man is he who is without ideals, for
he imagines that whatever is, ought
to be, that whatever has been, shall
for all time remain, and he resents
being roused from the lethargy of his
worship of the god of things as they
ought to be.
"Better the idealist who is imprac
tical, than the man without ideals who
is too practical, who is ready to prac
tice anything. The impractical ideal
ist is frequently admirable, though
sometimes pathetic, but the over
practical man without ideals is not
seldom a malign influence. Let him
who would have an ideal life fill his
life with ideals.
"Education is not needed in order to
pndow a man with ideals, but we have
the right to ask that its effect shall
not be to rob men of their ideals.
Mark Twain rightly pitied the men
who arrive at the point when their
illusions cease to be and they, in turn,
enter upon the realities of life.."
