# BRAZIL IS SUBJECT OF ILLUSTRATED TALK BY DR. BRANNER
## AUDIENCE FILLS THE CHAPEL "Don't Go to South America to Get Rich" Advises Stanford President

Although Dr. Branner has often
given his advice to students who have
asked him about work in South

mahogany and others are gotten from
the native forests of the northern
parts of the country. I do not believe
