# BRAZIL IS SUBJECT OF ILLUSTRATED TALK BY DR. BRANNER
## AUDIENCE FILLS THE CHAPEL "Don't Go to South America to Get Rich" Advises Stanford President 
### 
Although Dr. Branner has often
given his advice to students who have
asked him about work in South
America, he told the audience which
filled the chapel last night that his
universal reply had been, "Do not go
to Brazil or any part of South America
expecting to make a fortune, unless
you are under contract with some re
sponsible company and for definite
work. When that work has been com
pleted I feel sure that you will come
back to the United States."
Language Is Portuguese
Dr. Branner spoke of the language
of Brazil. "Contrary to the opinion
of most people the national tongue is
not Spanish, but is Portuguese. There
are certain colonies where Spanish
and German are spoken, but the per
son expecting to become acquainted
with the people and their customs,
will find himself as helpless as a
baby.
"The greater portion of the country
is pastoral and the cattle-raising in
dustry rivals any in the world. All
such products as rubber, cocoa, nuts,
mahogany and others are gotten from
the native forests of the northern
parts of the country. I do not believe
I have eve.r seen an artificial orchard
in Brazil."
Field for Work in Itrazil
One of the strongest points of the
talk was that any man who wishes to
do a really great and splendid piece of
constructive work can go to South
America and becomc a teacher. "On
my last trip there," he said, "I was
asked by the governor of the state of
San Paulo to find fo.r him a man to
take charge of the schools of the state,
112 knew intimately most of the mis
sionaries who have done the more im
portant work and T know that their
greatest success has been in connec
j tion with t lie schools that they have
established. They did not so down
there and say, 'My friends you are a
bad lot; we have coino to Christian
ize you.' They worked with the peo
ple and influence has been in educa
tion."
Accompanying the lecture, Dr.
Branner showed a number of ste.reop
ticon views taken during his many
trips to South America, fn some of
them he was shown carrying on his
work with the Stanford men who have
heen taken to the southern country.
