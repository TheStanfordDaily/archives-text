Before the Union was really built,
and while a few staunch souls were
boosting the grand Idea, the rest of
us used to gasp with wonder, and
were convinced that the institution
would be a Wonderful Thing under
the sun. After the gray walls were
finished, and the doors were opened,
many of us stayed aloof in a reverent
spirit of indifference. Today grateful
quantities of us know that the Union
is a proud possession, and a place that
offers friendly joys and comforts.

Members of the community, students
and faculty alike, are now regarding
the Union from a new viewpoint.
They say to hang with the notion that
its chief value is that of show-place to
brag about to admiring tourists and
envious collegians from the tall and
uncut. The 520 students who have
invested their semester fees, and the
half of the faculty men who have done
the same, are convinced that the Union
is 011 earth for the pleasure of Stan
ford people. Similarly rewarded are
the 500 alumni and students who have
fully or partially paid for life mem
berships. They are all getting their
fun.

Like many other things, the Union
is growing better each day of its life.
It is acquiring personality. It is 110
longer a building, with sundry books
and rugs and pool tables. More and
more we realize that it is a club, a
gathering place for friendly commun
ion or congenial solitude. Pictures,
and tokens, and trophies are finding
their way to the walls from all the
four corners. In short, we have with
us the Stanford Union.
* * * *
We admire and appreciate the suc
cess that is being attained by the gov
ernors of the L T nion, and by the man
ager, and by the members. We put
our o.k. on the faculty men who are
announcing office hours in the Union.
The campaign for membership is
bouncing along under the impulse and
guidance of those who know the
Union from the inside and are strong
for it. Next semester we hope there
will be 800 or more names on the
roster of student members. And the
other half of the faculty. The present
five-hundred-odd boosters are going to
turn the trick.
