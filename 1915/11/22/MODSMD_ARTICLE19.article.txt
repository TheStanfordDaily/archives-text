# SUPERINTENDENT BUILDS
## J.E. Hewston Will have New Residence Behind Post Office 
### 
Superintendent .1. E. Hewston is
building a new home 011 the cam
pus, situated directly behind the post
office. It is a large shingled house of
two stories and has nearly reached
completion.
Hewston is also overseeing the erec
tion of the new Corporation Yards sit
uated near the Engineering depart
ments. Tiiis building will combine all
the shops and working forces con
nected with the university grounds
consisting of carpenter, blacksmith,
painting, plumbing, and electrician
shops, with storerooms and a general
office.
Previous to this the shops have been
scattered about the grounds and there
has been little chance to develope an
efficient system on an economical
basis. Hewston believes the new plan
will be a decided commercial advan
tage. The building itself is of brick,
which will be covered with yellow
pebble dashes, corresponding to the
finish 011 the forge and foundry build
ing nearby.
