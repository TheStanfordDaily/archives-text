Berkeley Defeats Palo Alto
Palo Alto high school's rugby fif
teen lost to the heavier and faster
Berkeley High team Saturday after
noon on the dirt field of the Grove
street ball grounds, Oakland, by a
score of 24 to 3. Berekeley thereby
won the right to meet Stockton for the
championship of the California Inter
scholastic Federation. Kirksey made
Palo Alto's lone try immediately after
the opening of the second half.
Blind Student Hanks to Lecture
N. C. Hanks has neither eyesight
nor hands, but he is to lecture on "An
Hour of Optimism" this evening in the
Palo Alto Masonic Temple. Hanks,
who attends university classes in Eng
lish and History, has been called the
"man who laughs at fate," and he de
serves this title, for he faces life with
a smile. He will leave Stanford in a
few days on a long lecture tour, but
hopes to return to the university next
fall.
Film Conij:aity Busy
Active work on the production of
their initial film, "Wanda," is being
carried on by the Palo Alto Film Cor
poration at the country home of its
president, H. T. Goethe, near Loyola.
Movies of the Big Game and bonfire
rally were taken by this company as
a part of a college film to be pro
duced in the near future.
