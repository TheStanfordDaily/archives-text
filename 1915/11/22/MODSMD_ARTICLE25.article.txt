# JOHNS UPSETS DOPE
## National Tennis Hating Committee in Dilemma Over Champion 
### 
H. V. Johns, '18, one of Stanford's
star tennis players, has made the task
of the national tennis rating commit
tee very hard for the 1915 season. In
all previous years, the national cham
pion has without question been given
the position of number one in the
American rating. The defeat of Wil
liam Johnston, the American cham
pion, by Johns a few weeks ago, has
presented a se.rious problem to the
rating committee. Should Johnston be
given the number one rating? Some
of the committee believe that John
ston's defeat by a college man proves
that his national championship was a
lluke, and that the head position
should be given to McLaughlin or
Williams.
