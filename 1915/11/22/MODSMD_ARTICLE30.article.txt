# RAMON A HALL TO BE MAGNET FOR NICKELS
## Five Cent Pieces Will Be Garnered to Benefit Booth Boys 
### 
Ramona Hall will act in the capacity
of a magnet tomorrow evening. Which
in itself is quite a phenomenon. Hut
add the fact that the Ramona Hall
magnet will for one evening possess
the power of attracting nickels and
you have a just claim for considera
tion by the manager of the Seven Won
ders of the World.
It is all for chairty.
When the clock strikes twelve to
morrow evening the all-powerful mag
netic Ramona Hall will give place to
the just common ordinary Ramona
Hall. But in the interval between
supper time and the witching hour,
Ramona Hall will draw to its maple
floor a throng of merrymakers who
will dance to their hearts' content.
For a nickel. The money will help
build a boys' dormitory for the Maud
Booth Home in Soutb Palo Alto.
The scene of tomorrow evening's
activities is located at the corner of
University avenue and Ramona street,
opposite the First National Bank.
