PIQUANT FASHIONS —in hats, blouses, skirts, shoes,
scarfs, sweaters and coats for Sports Wear, modes
adapted particularly to the "jeune fille."
Piquant—because they seem
to "arrive" with so little effort.
There's an artistic negligence
in their seeming indifference
to the mode. For it is only
through the utmost care in
designing that these fashions
achieve the wanted piquance.
For the "jeune fille"—every need and vanity—from boot to
chapeau—from "intimate wear" to Sports Coat.
Write for a copy of the Bon wit Teller Gift Book.
You'll find it helpful in Christmas ideas.
