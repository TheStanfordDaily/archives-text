### 
Rugby will bo played in all the high
schools of San Francisco next year,
according to a resolution passed by
the San Francisco Athletic League, at
a meeting of the directors held in the
Olympic Club last night. "When the
choice of the style of game came to a
vote there was not a dissenting repre
sentative, showing that all of the city
schools are in favor of the game.
Lowell high won the championship
this year after a number of hard
played games. It is hoped now that
the new schools around the bay,
especially the military academies, that
have changed over to American foot
ball during the season just finished,
will come back into the rugby fold.
This will probably be brought about by
a lack of competition.
