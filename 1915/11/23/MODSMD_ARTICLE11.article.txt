# Opera Committee Plans
## 
### 
Junior operas which are completed
may be submitted by the authors in
person to the committee at the Alpha
Phi house on the afternoon of De
cember 5. All operas under construc
tion should be reported to a meftiber
of the committee and must be com
pleted immediately after the Christ
mas holidays, ready for submission.
Dick Morgan, *16, has been chosen
by the committee as coach for the 1917
musical show. He has had more to do
with Stanford productions than per
haps any other person. Last year he
collaborated with W. H. Forbes, '15,
in producing the successful 1910 opera.
