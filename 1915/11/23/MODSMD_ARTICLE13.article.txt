## PREPARE FOR SPRING SPORTS Stanford Student Body President Sends Letter to A. S.U.C. Executive 
### 
As a move toward healing the exist
ing breach in athletic relations be
tween the University of California and
Stanford so that the two universities
may compete in spring sports next
semester, the following letter lias been
sent to the president of the Associated
Students of the University of Cali«
fornia by P. Ft. Wilson, '15, president
of the Associated Students of Stanford
University:
November 22nd, 1915.
Mr. (lias. Street,
I'res. Associated Students,
University of California,
Berkeley, Calif.
Dear Sir:
In view of the approach of spring
sports and the athletic differences ex
isting between California and Stan
ford, some definite step should he taken
to bring the two colleges to a mutual
understanding.
Inasmuch as the principal which
hrouuht the severance of athletic rela
tions was the freshman rule, and both
colleges being equally firm upon the
stand they have taken, I suggest, on
the part of the Stanford Student Body,
that a board of arbitration lie appoint
ed to settle the dispute. In order to
reach a speedy and correct solution of
the difficulty, a board composed of men
belonging to neither institution would
arrive at a clearer and better settle
ment.
Such a board would give an unbiased
opinion, and the Associated Students
of Stanford will abide by such opinion.
Hoping that this suggestion will
meet with the approval of the Asso
ciated Students of the University of
California, I beg to remain.
Very truly yours,
(Signed) P. It. WILSON,
President A. S. S. U.
The letter to the California student
body president was sent by Wilson to
day and in all probability will be
brought l>efo.re the Berkeley executive
body at. a meeting in the near future.
Its reception by California will prob
ably show what possibility there is of
the two universities reaching an agree
ment, as submission of the question to
a neutral body seems to be the only
way to reach a solution of the prob
lem separating the two student bodies.
