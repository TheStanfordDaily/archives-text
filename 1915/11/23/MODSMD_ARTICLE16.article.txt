Hastily but fervently we liope that
the Stanford-California squabble will
be entrusted to firm, clear, and un
trammeled minds. We want those
minds to thresh justice out of the
the freshman rule, scholarship re
quirements, and all the rest of the dip
lomatic discord. And may their deci
sion be law!
Spring sports top the athletic pro
gram, and the students of neither uni
versity want to send their teams East
for competition until there has been
some fun on Western soil.
We hope that the proposal of P. R.
Wilson, fairly made, will be fairly re
ceived and fairly arbitrated into hon
orable fact. The public clamors for,
and the student bodies need a basis
for sp.ring competition.
To this latest step toward a lost and
soiled sportsmanship we wish good
luck. Stanford and California cannot
reach a football agreement this year.
They can be kept in disagreement over
other sports only by criminal folly.
We hope that the proposal for arbitra
tion will reach the ears of all Cali
fornia students.
