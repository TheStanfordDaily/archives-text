# Alumnus Handles Student Control
## Dr. Branner Exhorts Alumni to Tell Fewer Tales of " Good Old Days" 
### 
That student control at Stanford
during the four years of its existence
has not been entirely successful, but
that it is now developing along the
right lines, is the belief of a num
ber of Stanford faculty members and
prominent students as expressed in
contributions to an article on "Pro
gress of Student Control" in the cur
rent number of the Stanford Alumnus,
which was issued today.
"Good Old Days"
Among the various matters brought
out in the discussion of the problems
of student control, the Alumnus editor
calls attention to the advice given by
Dr. Hranner in an address to the
alumni, "That they should go a little
lightly in their tales of the 'good old
days.' " It is the opinion of the editor
that the old grads are given to em
broidering their tales with after
thoughts which "sound attractively
devilish to the undergrads, and help to
perpetuate ideals that don't do any
good."
The report of the Committee on Stu
dent. Affairs, which was appointed last
May for the specific purpose of "re-
I viewing the experience with student
control in order to determine what
modifications if any ought to be made
in the organization or conduct of the
! system," is given in full. The com
' mittee, composed of Professors M. S.
Wildman, and C. A. Huston, Mrs. E.
\V r . Allan, dean of women, Associate
i Professors S. I. .Miller, E. P. Lesley,
i and 1). M. Folsom, came to the conclu
i sion that they would avoid "any pro
; posal which would indicate a desire
|to recall or restrict any rights or
! powers now enjoyed by the students,"
the committee confining its work to a j
J letter of suggestions and criticisms
! sent the student conference.
Many Approve System
D.r. Jordan and Dr. Branner have
