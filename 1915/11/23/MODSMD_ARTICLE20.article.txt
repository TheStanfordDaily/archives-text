# BASKETBALL SEASON IS OPENED BY LARGE SQUAD
## Many Veterans Included in Yesterday's Line-up of Promising New Material 
### 
Fo.vty men came out for basketball
yesterday afternoon at the first prac
tice held this season. This number,
according to Captain W. B. Blodget,,
'15 will be increased considerably in
the next few days. Six or seven vet
erans are included in the squad, but
from the quantity of promising new
material, the former varsity players
will have a hard tussle to retain their
positions this year.
A series of interclass games will be
gin next week. Practices are now be
ing held from 5 to 6 p. m. every school
day. Basket-shooting practices occu
py the hour preceding the .regular
practice. Extra baskets will be put
into place to afford ample opportunity
for practice at this necessary branch
of the sport. After the Sophomore Co
tillion the gymnasium iloor will be
resined and putin the best of condi
tion for basketball.
