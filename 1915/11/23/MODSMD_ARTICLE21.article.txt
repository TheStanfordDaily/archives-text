# SOPHOMORE AMD SENIOR TO SETTLE INTERCLASS TITLE
## H.L. Hahn, ’16, and H.V. Johns, ’18, Will End Long Drawn-Out Tennis Tournament Tomorrow 
### 
H. L. Halin, '16, and H. V. Johns, *18,
will play the final match tomorrow of
the singles play in the annual inter
class tennis tournament. This will be
the last match in a .rather long and
drawn-out, but hotly contested tourna
ment. Differing from previous tourna
ments of the same order, the men who
represented their respective classes in
the interclass play had to first defeat
all others in their own classes. This
necessarily made the tournament
longer than usual, but every one was
given an opportunity to play. Hahn
and Johns won their way into the
finals by defeating the junior and
freshman representatives.
Phi Beta Kappa held their regular
semester's initiation of newly elected
members last night.
