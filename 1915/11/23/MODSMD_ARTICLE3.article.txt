Have you helped the Belgians?
Have you helped the Club Mouse?
How about the Maude Booth
Home?
In other words, are you generous?
If so—here's a way to help some
one right at home, without sacrific
ing a cent.
Tomorrow night the Sophomore
Cotillion will begin a grand march
at 8:15, which isn't very newsy,
and hasn't much bearing on your
help, except that after said grand
march and after every other dance,
you and all the rest of us will
want to sit down. The sophomores
need couches and sofa pillows to
furnish the gymnasium.
Ordinarily, the sophomores have
simply raided Encina rooms and
decorated the club room for the co
tillion. but this year Chairman H.
P. Hauser has faced a new prob
lem in preparing a larger and more
distant hall for the annual second
year formal.
People who have couches and sofa
pillows are requested to phone to
Fneina and leave word, that the
sophomores may gather them up
with a wagon Wednesday afternoon.
The furnishings will be returned
Thursday or Friday.
