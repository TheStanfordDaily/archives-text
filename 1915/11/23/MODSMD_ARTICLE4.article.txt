# PAN-HELLENIC PLANS NEARING COMPLETION
## 
### 
Pan-Hellenic has not as yet drawn
up the contract which is to govern
sorority rushing next year under the
new system of Matriculation Pledge
Day. The general sentiment of the
houses is toward a restriction on the
length of the period of rushing on the
campus before registration day. There
will very likely be a general rule
against meeting trains and a few other
rules, but the contract will not be so
involved, nor will the .rules be so In
tricate as in previous rushing seasons.
