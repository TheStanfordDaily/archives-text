# TRUSTEES TO CONSIDER PLAN FOR OUTDOOR THEATER
## FINANCIAL PROPOSALS MADE Structure Suggested Will Have Seating Capacity of Four Thousand 
### 
Representatives of the campus or
ganizations interested in getting an
open air theater for Stanford met yes
terday afternoon with Mr. Vanderlynn
Stow, Treasurer of the Board of Trus
tees, to make definite plans for pro
ceeding with the work of a theater.
The proposal for a structure to seat
4000 people and to cost from $14,000
to $IS,OOO, was submitted by Mr. Stow
to the Finance Committee of the Board
of Trustees at a meeting scheduled for
this morning. This body will decide
what financial help the Board will
probably give in the building of an
outdoor theater.
Trustees to Consider Plans
Plans for the theater and whatever
means the Finance Committee may de
cide upon for financing the structure
will then be submitted to the meeting
of the Board of Trustees scheduled for
next week.
If the plans are acceptable to the
Board of Trustees, the Grounds Com
mittee of the Board will meet with
the campus open-air theater committee
and work on the choice of a site for
the theater. Mr. Stow has made the
suggestion that the two committees
later make a trip to the Bohemian
Grove and see the outdoor theater
there before settling on definite plans
for a theater here.
To Form Permanent Association
Steps will be taken at once to form
a permanent organization on the cam
pus to take charge of the open-air
project. It will be composed of one
member from each of the undergradu
ate entertainment and dramatic soci
eties, two members each from the Fac
ulty Committee on Public Entertain
ment and the Faculty Committee on
Public Exercises, and one or more
members from the Board of Trustees.
This organization will be permanently
identified with the management and
financing of the proposed outdoor
stage.
