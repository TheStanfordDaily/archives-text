# Grace Before Meat

We prepare to embark on the boun
tiful fun of another Thanksgiving at
home, and we wish that we might suc
cessfully wish you all the same. Any
way, prosit! And that's not idle bunk.

Sadly enough, we must abbreviate
the greetings, and hasten to purify
our eternal soul by the declaration of
a social grievance. Because there are
few things better than a clear con
science to blaze the road to a good
vacation.

Heaps of abuse should be turned
broadside on some specimens of public
initiation comedy. Not on initiation
performances as an institution, be
cause they possess all the latent in
gredients of good sport. There are
a few pernicious examples of mis
guided humor, however, which need
to be spiked.

At present there are numerous and
indignant rumors abroad on the cam
pus. We hope that they will curb the
genius of future neophytes who feel
themselves drawn toward the unlovely
goal of raw and unrefined comedy.

Few of us are inclined to judge the
morals of Stanford initiates by the
poisoned chestnuts which they some
times distribute among the men and
a few women in their audiences. The
fellows who stand unabashed and
chortle indecencies on initiation day
would blush for shame to hear them
selves through a phonograph.
* * * *
Pressure of time in which to pre
pare their skits, and unnatural exhu
berance pave the way for insurgent
expressions of vulgar impulse which
slumbers under daily restraint, but
which grabs at the chance to take a
holiday.
* * * *
So we grant the dangers which beset
the manufacturers of public enter
tainment. But we believe the peril
can be kept under thumb if enough
moral suasion is used by the initiates
themselves. And we want to see
nothing but good initiation entertain
ment in the time to come.
