To the Edito.r:
Dear Sir. —In your editorial of No
vember 22 the statement is made that
only half the members of the Faculty
have become members of the Stanford
Union. L venture to suggest that per
haps many of these would join if the
facilities for so. doing were placed be
fore them. Unless my case is an ex
ception, some of us have never had an
opportunity to join. Before the Club
house was built 1 received a letter
soliciting life memberships, but that
was not within my means. On the
opening night last year illness kept
me at home, otherwise I would have
joined then. Since that time no one
has either asked me to join or sent me
an application blank. Now if anyone
will bring me a blank or send me one
I will gladly make application for
membership and if he will inform me
of the name of the treasurer I will
gladly pay my dues. I know it will be
said that I ought to be interested
enough and patriotic enough to hustle
around and get an application blank
myself,—all of which is probably true,
yet it is probably also true that 1 do
not differ very greatly from the aver
age run of mankind when 1 forget or
neglect to do this.
If there is any considerable number
of persons, eligible to membership,
who can lie gotten as easily as this
one, would it. not be a good plan for
the officers of the Union to see that
at least the facilities for joining the
Union are placed before them?
Very sincerely yours,
S. I). TOWN LEY.
