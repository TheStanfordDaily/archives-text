# MME. GADSKI WILL SING HERE
## Noted Soprano is Secured for Concert on December 9 
### 
Johanna Gadski will appear here on
the ninth of December. This decision
was reached this morning by the Ex
ecutive Committee of the Peninsula
Musical Association when they found
that it would be possible to procure
this famous artist for a concert in ad
dition to the regular annual series.
This is the first time that the As
sociation has planned on Riving an
extra concert in the series and if it
is successful, the plan will be carried
out in future years. Mme. Gadski is
undoubtedly the foremost dramatic
soprano before the American public
today and it is some time since she
has visited the coast. She will sing
in Oakland, Berkeley, and San Fran
cisco, and then will go to Los Angeles.
After her engagement in the south,
the sop.rano will return and give her
concert here.
Owing to the heavy demand that will
be made for seats and the limited seat
ing capacity of the Assembly Hall,
orders for tickets should be sent at
once by mail. Holders of season tick
ets may get the coupons for the extra
concert at the price of one dollar for
the two seats. The general public will
be supplied at the price of two dollars
per single ticket.
