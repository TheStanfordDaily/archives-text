## 
### 
With six Stanford ruggers playing
on each team, the All-British fifteen
defeated the All-American aggrega
tion in one of the finest rugby exhi
bitions ever staged on the coast by a
17 to lfi score last Saturday on Ewing
held in San Francisco.
As the score shows, the game was
very close and hard fought. The
teams were evenly matched, and rep
resented the cream of the rugby world.
It would be hard to pick out any in
dividual stars, but the playing of Ric
Templeton was a feature. His kicking
helped the winners score to the tune
of eight points. The Stanford men
who played were Sope.r, Bloeser,
Rehm, Pettingill, Walker, and Urban
on the All-American; Braden, Wylie,
Erb, Hie Templeton, Carroll, and
