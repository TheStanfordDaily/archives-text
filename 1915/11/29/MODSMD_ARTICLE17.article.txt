The Hoard of Trustees feels that it
is unable at the present time to pro
ceed on its own resources with the
construction oL' an open air theater
which would cost as much as eighteen
thousand dollars. That was the
amount named in a tentative proposal
which was submitted by Mr. Vander
lynn Stow last week. Too many other
holes have been dug for the sinking of
university funds. Moreover the trus
tees think that campus people should
not be burdened with any financial
.responsibility which might attend the
venture. We accept those decisions
respectfully, and with approval.

Many of us believe so firmly in Stan
ford's urgent need for an outdoor the
ater and congregation place for gen
eral assemblies that we don't want to
let the cat die. We are convinced
that Stanford culture, fun, comfort,
and indeed, economy recommend con
struction of a substantial theater Now.
And since we are flighting for the
structure, and are unwilling to see it
discarded on the scrap heap of for
lorn hopes, we must present good and
sufficient reasons why we shouldn't
wait for the theater to become a fact.

Originally, in our enthusiasm, the
many of us who are keen for the the
ater thought that the trustees might
go fifty-fifty with other interested peo
ple—that they might provide half the
necessarv sum free of strings, and

lend the other half at interest. Such a
plan was submitted by Mr. Stow. Now j
then we ask a question.
# * * *
Since it is undesirable to beleaguer
students and faculty with money trou- :
bles to the extent of half the cost of '
the enterprise, will the Hoard of Trus
tees deem it advisable to subscribe the
entirety of a smaller sum?

Happily, in the matter of building
an open air theater we can cut our
coat according to the available cloth.
And without sacrificing anything of
quality or utility. The structure in its
final proportions need not date from
the beginning. Dimensions and equip
ment may be increased from time to
time while we are garnering the ad
vantages of that portion of the theater
which is available At Present. We
think that a few thousand dollars will
Kive us the proper start, —one that can
grow like the proverbial acorn. And
with that conviction we shall approach
the trustees again.

A location must be chosen which will
lend itself most kindly to the capacity
of the pocketbook. Perhaps the shelv
ing hills somewhere near Lagunita are
best. Maybe there is a nook in the
Arboretum or somewhere else. Above
all, many students and professors, and
trustees feel the demand for an open
air theater. Tt lies before some of us
who are willing to work, to convince
ourselves that the basis of the theater,
and a usable one can be obtained
without prohibitive expense. Because
Stanford is a great university. And
a great university needs an open air
theater. The creeping impulse of the
money grabber bids us add that the
expense of dramatic productions and
of temporary accommodations for uni
versity functions would slump ma
terially.
