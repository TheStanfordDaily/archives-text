# Trustees Lack Funds For Outdoor Theater
## Finance Committee Believes Project Should be Postponed Until Later Date 
### 
Plans for the immediate growth ot
an outdoor theater for the Stanford
campus encountered a stumbling block
Wednesday when the Finance Commit
tee of the Board of Trustees concluded
that lack of funds must prevent fa
vorable action on such a proposition
at the present time. Although the de
sirability and need of a Stanford out
door stage lias now been recognized
by trustees, faculty and student body,
the decision of the Finance Committee
was unfavorable to the assumption of
heavy financial obligation. The tenta
tive proposal submitted by Vander
lynn Stow, business manager and
treasurer of the university, called for
a structure to cost between $14,000
and $18,000.
As expressed in a letter from Mr.
Stow, the Finance Committee is firmly
convinced that it would be undesirable
to burden faculty, alumni, or students
with further financial responsibility.
And insomuch as the trustees, because
of numerous financial demands feel
unable at present to build a structure
of the proposed nature unaided by
subscriptions, it was decided that the
matter be temporarily laid aside.
Whether or not the trustees may
deem it possible to expend a smaller
sum on the commencement of an out
door structure which would be of un
usual value to the campus community,
lias not yet been ascertained. Since
an outdoor gathering place would
eliminate the expense of temporary
arrangements for numerous university
meetings, some plan may be accepted.
If a substantial but unpretentious bo
ginning were made on a desirable site,
extension and improvement could be
left to future years. Mr. Stow's letter
follows:
November 24th. 1915.
Professor George J. Peirce,
Stanford University,
California.
My Dear Sir: —1 presented the
proposition of the out-of-door the
ater to the Finance Committee of the
Hoard of Trustees this morning and
regret to say, as I know all the other
members of that Committee do also,
that they could not recommend such
a proposition at the present time.
Neither the members of the com
mittee nor President Branner are
willing that the Faculty members.
Alumni and Student Body should
assume any more responsibilities
than they have at present, and think
that if there is need for such a the
atre the funds should be appropri
ated by the Trustees. Unfortunte
ly, the Trustees have not the funds
available at the present time and,
consequently, so far as they are con
cerned the project must wait.
Regretting the necessity of writ
ing you as 1 do, I remain
Yours very truly,

As expressed in a letter from Mr.
Stow, the Finance Committee is firmly
convinced that it would be undesirable
to burden faculty, alumni, or students
with further financial responsibility.
And insomuch as the trustees, because
of numerous financial demands feel
unable at present to build a structure
of the proposed nature unaided by
subscriptions, it was decided that the
matter be temporarily laid aside.
Whether or not the trustees may
deem it possible to expend a smaller
sum on the commencement of an out
door structure which would be of un
usual value to the campus community,
lias not yet been ascertained. Since
an outdoor gathering place would
eliminate the expense of temporary
arrangements for numerous university
meetings, some plan may be accepted.
If a substantial but unpretentious bo
ginning were made on a desirable site,
extension and improvement could be
left to future years. Mr. Stow's letter
follows:
November 24th. 1915.
Professor George J. Peirce,
Stanford University,
California.
My Dear Sir: —1 presented the
proposition of the out-of-door the
ater to the Finance Committee of the
Hoard of Trustees this morning and
regret to say, as I know all the other
members of that Committee do also,
that they could not recommend such
a proposition at the present time.
Neither the members of the com
mittee nor President Branner are
willing that the Faculty members.
Alumni and Student Body should
assume any more responsibilities
than they have at present, and think
that if there is need for such a the
atre the funds should be appropri
ated by the Trustees. Unfortunte
ly, the Trustees have not the funds
available at the present time and,
consequently, so far as they are con
cerned the project must wait.
Regretting the necessity of writ
ing you as 1 do, I remain
Yours very truly,
VANDERLYNN STOW,
Treas. & Bus. Mgr.
