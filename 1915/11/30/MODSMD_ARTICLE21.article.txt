# HIGH SCHOOL RUGBY STARS PLAN GAMES
## San Francisco Aggregation Will Meet Sacramento Valley Teams in Vacation 
### 
Through the activities of a group of
| Sacramento valley rugby boosters, a
schedule of contests between an all
i star aggregation of San Francisco high
school players and a number of val
ley teams lias been arranged for the
j Christmas vacation. The San Fran
| cisco team will be composed of play
| ers from each of the city high schools,
and will be very largely the same team
! that recently met the Woodland fifteen.
That the competition will be keen
is shown by tlio fact that the all-stars
will tackle a picked team made up of
the Chico Normal School fifteen and
the Chico high school squad. The
Chico Normal was the team which de
| feated the Stanford freshmen in the
| nineteeners' big game of the season,
j and should be able to give the San
1 Francisco players a good fight without
j the assistance of the best Chico high
' school players.
Games will also be played with
j Stockton, Sacramento and other val
ley towns.
