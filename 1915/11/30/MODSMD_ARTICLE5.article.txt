# DOCTOR JORDAN WILL COME HOME
## To Abandon Peace Trip and Continue Lecture Tour 
### 
Chancellor Jordan will not join the
Ford peace party when it leaves for
Denmark next Saturday. A telegram
to M.rs. Jordan received this morning
stated that Dr. Jordan will fill his
lecture engagements in the east and
south, and will return to Stanford
about December 9. However, from the
contents of the telegram it is certain
that Chancellor Jordan has not given
up the idea of a European journey, but
will cross the Atlantic next year, prob
ably in early spring, when it will be
possible for him to make a stay much
longer than that allotted to the Ford
party, which returns in six weeks.

The probability of the holding of tlie
peace, conference at Rerne looms up
uncertain. Originally scheduled for
the middle of December, the scarcity
of delegates necessitated a postpone
ment. Should the congress meet in
Europe as originally planned, it is
most probable that Chancellor Jordan
will be present.
Unless his plans are changed. Dr.
Jordan will resume his class room lec
tures in international arbitration and
biology here next semester. His sche
dule will carry him back to Stanford
through the southern and southwest
ern states.
