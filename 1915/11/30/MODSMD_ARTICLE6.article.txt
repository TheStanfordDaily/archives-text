# JACOMINI ELIGIBLE FOR CREW RACE ON HUDSON
## 
### 
Prospects for a winning caliber crew
for the coming season are brightened
by (lie receipt of a letter from Martin
.1. Rogue, chairman of the stewards
committee of the Intercollegiate Row
ing Association, saying that G. A. Ja
comini, '15, will be eligible for the
next intercollegiate race on the Hud
son. This brings the total of crew
veterans for the coining season to
seven.
According to Captain C. 11. Ortne,
'16, there will be a good turn-out for
the second varsity boat next spring
and besides seven of last year's crew,
j six of the freshmen are to report for
the second boat.
Mail} Freshmen Out
The response of the freshmen to the
I call for candidates for the 191!) crew
has broken all previous records.
Forty-five are out for regular seats in
the boat and fifteen for coxswain. The
candidates for coxswain are the light
est that have ever reported for fresh
man trials. More than half of those
trying out weigh under 110 pounds
and one candidate tips the scales at 9.".
Nearly all the work up to the pres
ent has been on the machines at the
boat house, though a few work-outs
have been held at Redwood in the

shells. After being thoroughly trained
in the rudiments of the stroke all the
candidates are given a chance in the
shells. Next semester work will be
gin in earnest at Redwood and 011 the
lake. All the boats are available for
use at the present time with the ex
ception of the varsity shell which is
still in the east. The shells at Red
wood have been repainted and re
paired and are now ready for the
spring practice.
Meeting Tomorrow at I'liion
There will lie a meeting in the Union
at. 1:10 tomorrow for all varsity crew
men to consider the agreement with
Washington for the two scheduled
races to take place next semester, ft
is probable that only one race will be
lowed with Washington, as the re
gatta at Poughkeepsie will be held on
June 17 next year, a date earlier than
usual, and the end-semester examina
tions will also prevent continued
training for a second race. The agree
mrat as it now is calls for one race
here and one at Washington, and it is
probable that the question as to the
advisability of a second race will be
settled before Graduate Manauer Heli
reim leaves to attend the Northwest
Con ferenee.
