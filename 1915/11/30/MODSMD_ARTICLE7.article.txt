# ALL-AMERICAN RUGGERS WILL AGAIN MEET ALL-BRITISH
## International Rivals Will Settle Dispute Raging Over Close Contest 
### 
International rivalry will again ex
press itself in the form of rugby next
Sunday afternoon when the All-Star
British squad meets the Ail-Star
American team for the second time
on Ewing field to settle disputes
brought about by the lone point that
gave the foreigners the edge over the
Yankees afte.r last Saturday's contest
was finished.
Discussion over the relative merits
of the two teams has run rife since
the game and boosters for the two
squads have been able to agree on
but one point, that being that the All-
Britishers and the All-Americans
handed out about the best brand of
rugby that lias been seen in the vicin
ity for some time. Consequently, an
other game is welcomed by rugby fans
of the bay district.
Game At 2:80 P. M.
The contest next Sunday will be
called promptly at 2:30, and seventy
minutes of hard fighting and fast rug
by will begin. Practically the same
line-ups will be used by managers of
both teams, and the contest will take
the nature of a return struggle to de
termine which nationality is best as a
rugby exponent in spite of the fact
that the game is called, according to
the announcement of the California
Rugby Union, purely for exhibition
purposes.
