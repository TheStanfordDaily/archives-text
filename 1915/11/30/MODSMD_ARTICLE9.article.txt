# U.C. STUDENTS TO BALLOT ON ARBITRATION
## SUBMIT STANFORD PROPOSAL California Executive Committee Decides to Submit Question to Student Body 
### 
A general discussion of the proposal
to arbitrate intercollegiate differences
made by Stanford last week will take
place at a meeting of the University
of California student body to be held
tomorrow afternoon at live o'clock.
The California executive committee de
cided at a special meeting held last
night that the question was too large
for such a small body to decide, and
took action to bring the matter before
the students.
Students Must Decide
"The whole student body must settle
the question," said Charles E. Street,
president of the Associated Students of
California, this morning over the tele
phone. "It is entirely open for dis
cussion, and is not for any one person
or group of persons to decide."
No fixed resolution has been drafted,
according to Street, but whatever is
decided by the students in the infor
mal discussion tomorrow, will be in
corporated into a letter which will be
sent to Stanford. Whether or not
there will be a secret vote by ballot, on
a formal resolution adopted at the
meeting, is a matter yet to be decided.
