isn't that lovely!!
Take the trail of any real wise smoker with a pipe between
his teeth and snatch a mellow whiff of fragrant "Tux."
Then you'll right away hunt up the nearest tobacco shop
and gladly intern a dime in exchange for a green tin of pure
smoke-delight.
"Tux" is going ahead of them all with a speed that makes it look
like a race between a 60-horse-power motor-car and a steam roller.
It's the fastest - growing brand of smoking tobacco in the world.
The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
Tuxedo is the original Burley smoking tobacco, that made pipe
smoking possible to many men, and the
original "Tuxedo Process" has never
been duplicated. It stands today as the
most effective treatment for making the
natural leaf deliciously mild and delight
fully fragrant and for removing every
trace of 'bite."
Spend a week with Tuxedo. Then
it will be just one week after another.
YOU CAN BUY TUXEDO EVERYWHERE
