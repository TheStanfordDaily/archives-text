Some few weeks ago a co-ed —not a
freshman, at that—was ove.rheard ask
ing why the football rallies were be
ing held on the S. A. E. lawn. It hap
pened that the person to whom the
question was addressed was a man,
so the information was given.
The incident causes one to wonder
whether the Five Hundred are awake
to the responsibilities which rest with
them as members of the Associated
Students.

Co-education at Stanford carries
with it equal privileges, duties and
obligations on the part of the women
of the university as well as the men.
This citizenship presupposes a knowl
edge of the principles of student con
trol, a general fund of information re
garding the prevalent customs and
traditions, and a general knowledge of
"who's who and why." In short, the
women of the university owe it to
themselves and to the university to
"get on the boat."

Student body elections will be held
shortly. Do the women in general
know anything of the candidates' qual
ifications beyond their appearance and
terpsichorean abilities? Do they know
anything of the existence of a merit
system in regard to elections of cer
tain student body officers?

Student government is being care
fully weighed at the present time, and
its defects are becoming obvious. The
remedies are simple and lie with the
students, —which by all means includes
the university women. If our ship of
state is seaworthy the Five Hundred
need have no fears. Get on the boat!
