Dear Mamma: —Oh, 1 have been hav
ing such an exciting time lately, learn
ing about everything. I thought it
would be dreadfully dull when foot
ball was over. It was such fun to
watch them frolicing and punting
around on the grass. Mr. Braden is
the new captain for next year. I am
just crazy about him. He is so ver
satile. He can play football like an
angel in disguise, and on Sunday he
carries flowers just beautifully, and
he is on the Executive Committee. I
asked some one what that was the
other day. They said it was a kind
of committee of athletes that meet and
decide how to run everything. They
meet in the Union. I found out what
that was the other day, too. It is a
large whitish house by the carline
with a barber shop and the Y. M. C. A.
No one ever seems to go around there
much —sort of like the Club House, T
guess. The Executive Committee must
be very grand. Mr. Carroll is on it
too. lie is a football scintillator.
Football must make one very execu
tive. It seems to have done that to
most of them. Other people are fa

nious too. though. Mr. Hettinger went
instead of Dr. Jordan to Europe in a
Ford. That is getting famous, I guess.
I would adore to go out for some col
lege activity, mamma, it would be so
stimulating. But I never seem to have
time. Why, 1 have five queening dates
before Friday as it is, one tonight at
eight. Well, it's 7:40, 1 must hurry
now and get tomorrow's studying done
before it's too late.
Ever your affectionate
DAUGHTER.
