# WAT D'YUH KNOW 'BOUT
## HIP? 
### 
Tomorrow night a dark mystery was
enacted on the campus. These people
who never queen are myste.ry enough,

but this is a more
so. Tomorrow
night was the
meeting of a liter
ary honor society
at the usual time
and place. It was
announced in a
temperance paper
that way. The lit
erary ones met.

Who was absent from the jovialness?
The most jovial was not there. Where
was Hip when P.ress Club met tomor
row night? He is far too literary to
miss a meeting. Here we have the
mystery.
Tomorrow night some students of
astronomy were walking through the
cactus gardens. They were. They
turned a corner. They did. From his
knees on the path arose a fat man
and fled. He was a nice fat man. His
hair was black. His face wasâ€”like
Hip's. A maiden disappeared after the
fleeing one. She was fair to look on.
They could not see her in the dark.
They scented mystery. They marked
the spot with a roughly hewn wooden
crass. It was a memorable spot. Day
after tomorrow morning they .returned
to the scene of the miss-tery. Sure
enough, beside the monument were
two knee-prints. They were examined
with magnifying glasses. They were
those of a "heavy person. (If he were
an athlete with records in the press
we would know how much Hip weighs.
It would "help the mystery.) The
knee-prints were compared with those
of Fat Rehm and other famous crimi
nals. They resembled none. On the
contrary they bore the unmistakable
stamp of Hip's English tweeds. If
Hip promises to queen for once to the
next Encina we will consent to say
nothing of all this.
