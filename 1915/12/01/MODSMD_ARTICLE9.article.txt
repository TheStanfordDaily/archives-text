Mr. Staniford above
Has edited the D. P. A.
All semester but today—
Has Mr. Staniford above.
His honor list is pretty long;
We couldn't tell you all that's
on it
In this our pink edition sonnet—
His honor list is pretty long.
Before he saw the Stanford Quad
As football captain, it would seem
He led the Fresno second team —
Before he saw the Stanford Quad.
Of clubs and things he is a member
1 he names of which would never
rhyme here,
To mention which we haven't
time here—
So many that we can't remember.
We've worked a lot for him this fall
The time is over all too soon
For hear! W r e'd work till crack
o' doom
On D. P. A. stuff for our Paul.
