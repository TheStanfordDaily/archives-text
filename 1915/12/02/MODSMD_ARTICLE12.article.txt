# CALIFORNIA WILL NOT ARBITRATE
## Blue and Gold Stand On Freshman Question Is Firm STANFORD'S OFFER REFUSED Vote Taken at Assembly Shows Unwillingness to Accept Impartial Decision 
### 
The University of California for
mally rejected the proposal of Stan
ford Student Body President P. R.
Wilson to submit differences that keep
the two universities from an athletic
agreement to a neutral body for set
tlement and abide by that body's de
cision yesterday afternoon at a meet
ing held in Harmon gymnasium.
The decision of the California stu
dent body was unanimous, not one
dissenting speaker or vote raising a
voice against the resolution of Cali
fornia Student Body President Charles
E. Street, which was sent today to
Stanford. The ballot on the resolu
tion was taken orally, after a number
of speakers had talked against sub
mission of differences to a neutral
committee.
Honud to Stand Pat
According to speakers at the Cali
fornia meeting, the Berkeley student
body cannot agree with Stanford be
cause of a difference of principles
which cannot be arbitrated, namely
the freshman ineligibility question.
California is doubly bound now, states
the letter to P. R. Wilson, to stick
positively to the stand taken on the
freshman question since agreements
have been entered into with the Uni
versity of Washington.
But one way is left by which the
two universities can agree, according
to the letter, that via the agreement
committee system in vogue last se
mester. California would instruct her
committee to hold out positively for
freshman exclusion, and the two
agreement committees would begin ex
actly at the places where they were
farced to part way last May.
Provided both student bodies are se
rious in their contentions and in their
declarations, no way now remains
open for an agreement, except that
one or the other side give up its stand.
The California letter to the Stan
ford student body follows:
Dec. 1, 1915.
Mr. P. It. Wilson, President Associ
ated Students, Stanford Univer
sity, California.
Dear Sir: â€”Your letter to me of
Nov. 22. 1915, was today duly sub
mitted at a mass meeting of the As
sociated Students of the University
of California. At that meeting, I
was by resolution, duly and regu
larly adopted by unanimous vote,
instructed to send through you to
the Associated Students of Stanford
University, the enclosed reply.
Very truly yours,
(Sinned) CHARLES E. STREET, Jr.,
President.
Resolution
Re it resolved, That the President
of the Associated Students be and is
hereby instructed to send the follow
ing communication in reply to the
letter of Nov. 22, 1915, from the
President of the Associated Students
of Stanford Univeristy to the Pres
ident to the Associated Students oL'
the University of California regard
ing a renewal of intercollegiate ath
letic relations between the two uni
versities :
Berkeley, Calif., Dec. 1. 1915.
From the Associated Students of the
University of California to the
Associated Students of Leland
Stanford University.
In answer to your letter of Nov. 22,
1915, regarding the possible renew
al of intercollegiate athletic rela
tions. we wish to say at the outset
that the present breech notwith
standing, we feel toward you only
the most cordial friendship and
good will.
When the results of the Stanford-
Santa Clara game were announced
on California field, our rooting sec
tion applauded and responded en
thusiastically to the Yell Leader's
(rail for cheers for the Stanford Var
sity. We intend this attitude to
wards you shall continue regardless
of the present regrettable break and
we take this opportunity to state
that, we do not regard the repeated
public utterances of some of your
supporters charging us with insin
cerity and hypocrisy as expressing
in any sense the feeling of the Stan
ford students. The very fact that
you desire a renewal of relations
with us is In itself a disavowal of
such charges.
The present b.reak is the result of
a difference of opinion on the ques
tion of the freshman ineligibility
nile. This difference last year
proved irreconcilable. We then
stated repeatedly that the rule was
to us so much a matter of principle
that without it Ave could not con
scientiously maintain athletic rela
tions much as we value them. There
fore we could not arbitrate this
question. To that view we still ad
here and furthermore we are now
doubly bound to insist upon a fresh
man ineligibility rule because it has
been made the fundamental part of
our agreements with other colleges
and universities, notably the Uni
versity of Washington.
Finally, and this of course we
must say frankly, it will be under
stood that iii any negotiations that
may be open with you or with any
other university, we will be bound
to preserve all obligations we have
assumed toward the University of
Washington, between whom and our
selves there prevail the most friend

ly and cordial relations.
We hold you to be our friends too,
and if you desire to have our respec
tive intercollegiate agreement com
mittee meet for negotiations consist
ent with our intercollegiate athletic
policy as outlined in this letter we
shall be glad to instruct our repre
sentatives accordingly.
Very respectfully,
(Signed) *
CHARLES E. STREET. .Tr..
President, A. S. U. C.
