# Happy Days

### 
Now is the time of year when pre
exaniination excitement sets our wits
all askew. Just the same as during
the week or two preceding the Big
Game or any other sporting event,
only multiplied. Tourists, and vaude
ville skit writers, and reformers 011
the hunt for rah-rah nonsense, could
get a bigger ear- and eye-full by drop
ping in 011 us now, than 011 the wildest
night of undergraduate celebration
that was ever staged in fiction.

We spend our off-time in varied and
ridiculous forms of entertainment,
either indoors or out. At any rate,
those of us who spend our solitary
hours in sane and sober study act
that way when we are gregarious.
Conversation at the meal table is like
a medley of rag-time lyrics set to an
accompaniment of saw-mills and
sirens.
* * * *
Everybody talks drivel. Except
once in a while when somebody
curses an instructor who has an
nounced an examination fo.r the re
stricted period under the alias of
"written lesson." Then we all aban
don our fun for a few seconds and
consign the party to his proper
pigeon-hole.

When the star pianist hits it up
after the noon or evening meal, sun
dry people discover of a sudden that
they can sing, or else decide that they
don't care whether they can or not, —
and the jubilee rants along for an
hour, unabated.

That is the formula we all use for
getting through the final ordeal. We
aren't wasting time, but just kidding
our nervous selves along, and keeping
up to par, or a little above. It's the
regular thing, and everybody under
stands, and it is a great invention.
* * * *
Lawn sports are part of the scheme.
Baseball and football in the front
yard, and so forth. We started to rave
along, according to mood, but per
force we change to moralize, as an
after-thought. When you people on
the Row are playing ball early and
late, keep a weather eye on the pas
sers-by. You have them bisoned.

The Conference has sent a request
out from time to time that some
regard be paid the people who
have to use the sidewalks. And
using the walks 011 Lasuen is a
real adventure. Just keep that in
mind, or some of the complaints we
have heard will go to the Conference
or Council, and then the secretary
will have to go to the bother of send
ing out long circular letters again.
