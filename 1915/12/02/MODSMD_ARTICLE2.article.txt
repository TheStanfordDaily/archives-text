# Hard Contest In Store for Stanford Swimmers
## Olympic Club Will Send Strong Team to Compete in Meet on Saturday 
### 
Stanford swimmers will encounter
the strongest competition they have
been Riven this season when they
meet the Olympic Club team in the
local plunge next Saturday afternoon.
Although the men under Coach Brand
sten's training have been successful
in winning all preliminary contests,
they have never met a team which will
at all compare with that to be sent
by the Olympic Club. Both the Car
dinal and club teams have good men
in all events, and the fight promises to
be close in all of the nine scheduled
races.
Tryouts are being held today and
will continue tomorrow for the water
polo team which will meet the Mer
cury polo team. No attempt has been
made heretofore to organize a water
polo team among the Cardinal swim
mers, but many of the men on the
squad have had experience on high
school teams and expect to get in
shape to meet the experienced visit
ing aggregation.
