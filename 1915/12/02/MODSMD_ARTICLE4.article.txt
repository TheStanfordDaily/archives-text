# BEHRENS AND WILSON AT CONFERENCE IN NORTH TODAY
## Freshman Question Bears Brunt of Argument With Forces Closely Matched 
### 
Graduate Manager Ea.rl C. Rehrens
and Student Body President Paul R.
Wilson line up today with Manager
John A. Stroud of California, to whip
northern colleges into a new confer
ence which will take in practically
all of the colleges of the coast. Wheth
er or not Stanford will lie able to join
a league of colleges for spring sports
will depend largely on the stand to lie
taken on the freshman question in
the north.
Neither California nor Stanford is
a member of the Northern conference
as it now exists, l>nt both have been
invited to send representatives to the
meeting at Portland with the view of
entering into what will probably be
called the Pacific Coast Conference.
Itehrens Suggested Conference
Graduate Manager Hehrens sug
gested the idea last summer of a Pa
cific Coast Conference to take in all
colleges from Los Angeles to Seattle.
At that time the idea was favored by
the northerners, and indications since
that time have been that Stanford is
still high in favor in Washington and
Oregon.
Just how the matter stands cannot
be justly judged by indications, for
both Stanford and California have re
ceived encouragement on their stands
from other colleges. The whole mat
ter will undoubtedly come to a head
and be fought to a decisive finish
today and tomorrow at Portland by
Hehrens for the Cardinal and Stroud
for the Blue and Gold. Which gradu
ate manager will win out will depend
on the stands which Washington State,
University of Washington, University
of Oregon. Oregon Agricultural, and
Whitman College have instructed their
delegates to take at the conference.
Graduate Manager Hehrens stated
before leaving the campus that he ex
pected California and the University
of Washington to stand out for fresh
man ineligibility, and all other insti
tutions to insist on pa.rticipaton of
first year men.
