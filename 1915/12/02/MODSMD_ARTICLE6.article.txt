Glee Club Trip Sanctioned
Official sanction was given to the
Glee Club to make a trip to Honolulu
during the Christmas holidays. This
removes the last obstacle from the
path of the Cardinal singers, and
makes the trip a certainty. It is ex
pected that the club will pay expenses
from the concerts given during the
tour, but to secure the members
against any possibility of financial
embarrassment, it was voted to lend
the club not more_ than $150 on per
sonal notes to be repaid February 1,
1916.
Crew La u mil Ordered
The contract was given to the Mari
time Motor Company, of Portland, to
build a launch for the use of the crew,
with provision for the installment of
an engine at a later date. This action
was taken on the recommendation of
Crew Captain Orme, after an exhaus
tive investigation of the merits of vari
ous propositions, and the securing of
bids from different builders. The hull
alone will cost approximately $200.
