# All-Stars Meet On Ewing Field Sunday
## Britishers Will Attempt to Repeat Their Victory of Last Week 
### 
All-star rugby will be presented to
the football enthusiasts for the third
time this season, when the All-Amer
ican and All-British fifteens meet on
Ewing field in San Francisco next Sun
day. This will he the second meeting
of these two teams, the game last
week resulting in a 17 to 16 win for
the Britishers.
The rugby exhibited on Ewing field
last Saturday was of such high order
that the fans are expected to flock in
great numbers to the game Sunday.
The admission will be 50 cents for
adults and 25 cents for children. One
of the best arguments in favor of rug
by and against American football is
the possibility of having such contests,
and having them in a successful man
ner; and the utter impossibility of
doing this in American football.
The line-ups which follow show
Stanford to be well represented:
All - American — Forwards, Soper,
O'Neil, O'Laine, Bloeser, Rehm, Hick
ey, Guerin, and Pettingill; backs,
Diaz. Walker, Uachmund, Fitzpatrick,
