# The 						New Idea

Once, when we were real young 011
the campus, people used to refer to
the English Club with varying inflec
tions of tolerant awe, and wonder what
it was all about. They spoke their
opinions in a barbarian mixture of
scorn, amusement, and respect. And
the popular notion was that any
blooming higli-brow who was dry
enough to qualify for membership
could call Dante by his front name,
and quote Aliltonian odes in classic
Latin.
* * * *
We don't subscribe our approval to
the opinion of English Club which ex
isted once on a time. This is all mere
ly a matter of record. Swaddled in
such a cloak of aesthetic hokus-pokus,
the members of English Club lived
contemporaneously with regular peo
ple, but otherwise were classed with
the bugs. So they enjoyed their meet
ings together, and wrote things, and
read stuff, and cared not a rap for
the public mind.
* * * *
Once a year, it is true, English Club
people came forth witli a dramatic pro
duction, and shared fun with other
people. And from time to time they
published a book that had particular
value for Stanford people, and helped
to keep alive good old traditions. But
those things didn't allay suspicion.
They werent intimate enough. How
far back such a separation of English
Club interests from the ken of the
general campus dates we don't know.
But so it existed three years ago.
* â™¦ * *
This is a tribute to the work English
Club is doing on the campus now, and
has been engaged with during three
years or more. We don't discount the
goodness of the club in earlier years.
Simply, we point out that the organi
zation has broadened itself. It has
taken other folks increasingly into
the range of its benefits. And the cam
pus attitude has become one of hearty
admiration.

The English Club has accomplished
its policy of profit-sharing by definite
means. Under its control The Stan
ford Sequoia has recovered from in
ertia. and is rapidly on the upgrade,
with a community appeal, and with
a fast growing subscription list. Last
semester the English Club presented
a dramatic spectacle which demanded
enthusiastic comment, namely: Noyes*
Sherwood.
* * * *
Early this fall appreciative people
were treated by English Club to three
playlets of distinct literary and dra
matic merit. Books of Stanford sto
ries are again on sale at the Book
store. thanks to English Club. Next

semester a powerful play will be
staged bv English Club actors. Mon
day evening, English Club will give
us au opportunity to listen to Alfred
Noyes, a groat and famous poet.
* * * *
Easily we can sec the growth of an
unappreciated society to a position
in which it appears in generous meas
ure a caterer to public enjoyment.
