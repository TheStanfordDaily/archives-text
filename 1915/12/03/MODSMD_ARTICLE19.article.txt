# Dramatic Soprano Will Hold Sway Thursday
## Madame Gadski to Repeat Program Given at Cort Including Wagner Arias 
### 
Looking younger than ever but with
an art matured by years, Mine. Gadski
is with us again. This is the way in
which Walter Anthony of the Chroni
cle describes the appearance of the
diva at the Cort concert yesterday
evening. The program of her San

Francisco concert is the same which
she will give in the Assembly Hall
after he.r return from the south.
Paul Eisler, who accompanies Mme.
Gadski at the piano, and who gives
two solo numbers 011 the program is
an artist in every sense of the word.
He works with an ease and musician
ship which are a delight to lovers of
finished work.
Miss Sarah Havker, secretary of the
Peninsula Musical Association, an
nounced this afternoon that season
ticket holders whose checks for the
Gadski concert did not reach the sec
retary until today, too late for ac
knowledgment by mail, will find their
coupons left for them at Weingartner's
drug store Saturday morning, where
the exchange of seats will take place.


Mine. Gadski
