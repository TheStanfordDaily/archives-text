# OLYMPICS VS. STANFORD
## Cardinal Swimmers Buck Stiff Competition Tomorrow 
### 
With two contesting teams so evenly
matched that the relay is expected to
be the deciding event of the day, the
Stanford swimming team will meet
the Olympic Club aggregation in the
local plunge tomorrow afternoon in
the big water sports event of the
present semester. Though the Cardi
nals have been improving wonderfully
under the coaching of Ernie Brand
sten, they will be forced to swim
against some of the best sprinters in
the United States. Among the stars
who will line up for the club team are
Norman Ross, Bond, Coule, Walton
spiel, Gardiner, and Shaw. All of
these men have made enviable records
as aquatic experts.
Clubmen Conceded Sprints
The visitors are conceded first place
in a number of the sprint events,
while the varsity men are expected to
capture the longer races and several
special events. Stanford will be rep
resented by Caughey, Orme, and Mc-
Claffey in the 50-yard dash. Ross and
Gardiner will be the club entries in
this event. Ross recently swam sev
eral exhibition dashes in the new tank,
in which he showed his ability at both
the 50- and 100-yard sprints. Caughey
and Orme, however, are expected to
be able to press the Olympic swim
mer to his full limit.
In the relay, Coach Brandsten will
use the five sprint stars on the var
sity squad. Orme, Caughey, Penni
man, McGaffey, and Kinney are the
men who will be relied upon in this
important event. They will probably
be opposed by Ross, Bond, Gardiner,
Resleure, and Shaw.
Polo Game Planned
Aside from the meet with the Olym
pic Club, the water carnival planned
for the afternoon will include a water
polo game between a picked Stanford
team and the Olympic Club team. This
event is expected to be one of the ex
citing contests of the afternoon. Ludy
Langor, world's champion 440-yard
and 880-yard swimmer, and water polo
star will in all probability play on
the Stanford team in this game, as
the contest has been arranged largely
for exhibition purposes. Aside from
his appearance in the polo game, Lan
gor, together with George Cunlia, will
swim exhibition races. Cunha's ap
pearance is being looked forward to
because of his record in match races
with Kahanamoku, the world's cham
pion sprinter. C'unha is now general
ly rated as being the champion's equal
in all his record holding events. Lan
gor, a Los Angeles swimmer, has won
practically all his races in the long
distance events in recent champion
ship tournaments. His mark in the
