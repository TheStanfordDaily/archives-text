# Alfred Noyes Not The Typical Poet That We Expect, Says Dr. Alden
## 
### 
"Alfred Noyes, though England's
Tennysonian poet, is not what you
usually will expect. He is a jovial
sort of person, that one can shake
hands with and talk to just as a friend,
rather than as a great literary man."
This is the description of England's
great poet who will appear before
Stanford people Monday evening in
the Chapel under the auspices of the
English Club and department, as given
by Dr. R. M. Alden, who met Alfred
Noyes some time ago at the Univer
sity of Illinois.
Noyes Is Jovial
"When Alfred Noyes was at Prince
ton, he mixed around with men of
the clubs just as one of them. lie
was chosen to take the position of
Henry Van Dyke at Princeton, when
Van Dyke took a leave of absence.
Though he is an Englishman, Noyes
has an American wife, and has spent
a number of years in United States.
"So far as is known, Noyes is the
only poet who is making his living
entirely through writing poetry. His
verse has found ready sale to maga
zines, and his several volumes have
been in steady demand ever since they
have been published."
Admission to the Alfred Noyes lec
ture will be by ticket. Tickets are
on sale at the Bookstore and at Wein
gartners.
