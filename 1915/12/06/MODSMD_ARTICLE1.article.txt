# AMERICAN STUDENTS OVER-SPECIALIZE SAYS NOYES
## WAR HAS MADE US CALLOUS Noted English Poet Hopes Stanford Will Stand By Rugby 
### 
'Your American student is too
prone to specialize 111 his studies. He
loses what should he most truly valu
able in his education," said Mr. Alfred
Noyes today in speaking of the Ameri
can college. The poet is a broad
shouldered, clean-cut young man, with
a forceful, straightforward manner.
"Art and literature do not receive
their share of attention from the
American college man," declared Mr.
Noyes. "He seems to find any knowl
edge of literature—particularly the
hest of current literature—superflu
ous and rather "beneath his dignity.
The student, at an English university
has his own library of selected books,
to which he adds from time to time,
but I doubt if you will find this with
(he American student.
"He avowedly seeks the practical side
of a university training, but he over
looks ihe fact that the man best fitted
to meet all situations is the man whose
education has been broadest. It is
only 'through this breadth of interest
that the botanist may know the es
sence of the stars, the astronomer the
beauty of the flowers. It is only
through his study of literature and
art that the engineer may understand
the heart of his fellowman, may have
something in common with the world
as he will find it after college."
Mr. Noyes was interested to know
that Stanford still plays rugby, al
though while at Oxford his participa
tion in athletics was principally in
crew and soccer.
War Affects Athletics
"Ah, then you must feel the -effects
of the war on your athletics. It Is
rather too bad that yon have never
been able to meet an English team at
football. "This war," he continued,
"seems to be making us all callous in
our attitude toward calamity and •suf
fering. I do not believe that there is
a ship in the world today that is large
enough to rouse more than passing
and desultory comment, shonld it bp

"I arrived just too late to -see your
exposition," said Mr. Noyes, "though
I hope to see some of It before it Is
too late. However, It Is the cwratry
which I am most anxious to know.
There may be a fair nearer home for
me some time, but California never
comes nearer."
