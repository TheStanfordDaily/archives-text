# CHANCELLOR RETURNS THURSDAY
## 
### 
Contrary to the confused reports of
eastern and western newspapers there
is no mystery surrounding the where
abouts of Chancellor Jordan. He is
not lost; nor was ever lost. Chan
cellor Jordan will arrive on the Sun
set Limited from the southland Thurs
day morning. He is now fulfilling
lecture engagements in Arizona and
Southern California. According to a
telegram received by Mrs. Jordan from
Phoenix, Dr. Jordan several times re
fused to reconsider his refusal of

Henry Ford's invitation to join the
peace ship. Though repeatedly urged
to attend the Ford Peace Conference
with Mrs. Jordan, Stanford's Chancel
lor chose to fulfill his lecture appoint
ments in the southern and southwest
ern states. His telegram names
Thursday as the definite date of
home-coming.
Just how long Chancellor Jordan
will remain on the campus is uncer
tain. Unless important matters arise.
it is believed he will be on band at ;
the installation of Dr. Wilbur as pres- I
ident or the university in January, and
will remain to deliver classroom lec- i
tures in international arbitration and I
Biology. However, in the event of j
important matters arising in the east,
Dr. Jordan will no doubt leave at once. I
A European journey is very likely,
should the Berne Peace Conference
meet in the spring, or should other
vital matters arise pertaining to
peace.
Mrs. Jordan Entertains
Mrs. Jordan entertained Professor
Henry Landes of the University of
Washington yesterday. Dr. Landes is
state geologist and head of the depart
ment of Geology at the University of
Washington . His visit to California
pertains to the shipping of the Wash
ington exhibits from the exposition.
