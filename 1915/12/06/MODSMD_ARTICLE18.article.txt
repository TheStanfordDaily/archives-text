# Goodbye, Dr. Branner
## 
### 
We accept the privilege of wishing
goodbye and good fortune to Dr. Bran
ner, who leaves the campus and his
duties as the second president of
Stanford tomorrow, and faces toward a
new turn in the road. It seems that
people often have most misgivings
when they want to express deepest
sentiments of gratitude and affection.
Words are unfriendly.
* # * *
All the sincerity we know how to
feel is eager for expression in this
God-speed, yet we feel hopeless to tell
Dr. Branner as we would like to, that
our lasting good-will is his to carry
away. Perhaps he knows anyway, so
that he will see in every printed ex
pression, and hear in every uttered
word, and feel in every hand-clasp the
deeper and silent reverence which is
part of our regard for him.
* * * *
Many of us have not known Dr.
Branner personally,â€”if that means
the sort of acquaintance which is built
of conversations, and an exchange of
names in greeting as we passed him
on the Quad. But the big truth re
mains that all Stanford people have
known him intimately, because during
two years he has grown to be part of
Stanford.
* * * *
Freshmen, seniors, instructors, and
all the grades of Stanford people be
tween, have felt the presence and the
influence of President Branner. He
has been for us the embodiment of
Stanford integrity, and charity, and
achievement. As his predecessor in
office was.and as we hope that all his
successors in the years to come will
be. Dr. Branner has been a man whom
we call with pride a Stanford Man.
# * * *
Or. Branner is with us today for the
last time as Stanford's president. He
will return to us, and will always be
one of the Old Guard. We promise
him our friendship.
