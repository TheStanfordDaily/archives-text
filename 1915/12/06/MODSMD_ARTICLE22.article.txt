We quote Macbeth.
"Oh the sweet sleep that knits up
the raveling slet?ves of care"— or
something to that effect. Tt's ages
since Sunday school days.
But on the train that left San Fran
cisco at 2:30 a. m.after the closing
exercises at the fair, Shakespeare was
applauded. He was proved correct.
The 2:30 a. m. carries all sleeping
cars. If there are no accommodations
on the seats, you sleep standing up.
The 2:30 a. m. is the milk train —so
called, perhaps, because its existence
is the very milk of human kindness to
those stalled in the big city after the
witching hour of 11:45.
Everybody was knitting Saturday
night. It seemed that raveled sleeves
we.re the vogue. The train was crawl
ing along around Belmont, pausing to
milk a cow here and there. Everybody
was asleep. The train stopped at Bel
mont. Tn the buzzing of flys and
voices—suddenly somebody opened a
door and shouted: "Palo Alto!"
Shakespeare and Macbeth and the
knitting party were forgotten. It.was
action that was wanted. There was
action. John Hoe, gr., and his chosen
one gathered up their knitting, the
raveling sleeves and their exposition
souvenirs, and—
Left the train at Belmont!
We surmise they milked a cow for
breakfast or rode one home. Frankly,
that point is irrelevant.
