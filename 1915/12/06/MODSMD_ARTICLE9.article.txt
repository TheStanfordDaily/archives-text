Sh! Our finger is on our lips.
For the idea is to keep this dark.
Buford Williams, '16, mustn't see
it. He is bashful, modest, and looks
with contemptuous disdain upon
anything that bears the minutest re
semblance to publicity. Williams is
a business manager and knows the
advantages of advertising. Yet he
says soft pedal. Which is all very
queer. Usually moving picture act
ors—movie stars, if you will —pay
high prices for having their names
proclaimed from the house-tops.
But 110 go Williams. Even though
he may soon be sharing the lime
light with Mary Pickaford,'lB, Char
lie Chaptlips, '17, and Theta Delta
Bera, '1!) (we changed the names so
we won't be sued) he is paying a
vast sums to keep his name from the
public gaze. But you can't conceal
news. Buford may act with the
Palo Alto Film Corporation—it's up
to Buford or up to the film com
pany—one or the other; that's a
minor point.
