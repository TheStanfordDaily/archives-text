# "EVERYBODY'S QUAD" 1917 SLOGAN
## 
### 
"Everybody's Quad," the largest
Quad that has ever joined the cardinal
bound row on the sfielf will be pub
lished by the Union Lithograph Com
pany of San Francisco. Fo.r the first
time the lithograph process will be
used in the Quad. The innovation
should win the favor of everyone from
A to Z in the bawl-out.
Five hundred pages with more pho
tographs than ever before will make
the lit 17 annual the largest Stanford
year book ever published. The new
process will give more opportunity for
using pictures through the whole vol
ume. Many new departures are being
planned. It will literally lie "Every
body's Quad." Professors and under
graduates from frosh to holdovers will
see their faces on the pages. Pictures
will adorn pages that have hitherto
been decorated solely by line upon line
of type.
Editor R. A. (Iriflin and Manager M.
L. Hews have announced that the Quad
will be printed in two colors. The cuts
will be in sepia and the printed matter
in black ink. The usual number of
four-color plates will be used to head
the more important departments.
More space than ever will be devoted

to the athletic teams, and action pic
tures of stars of turf and cinder-path
will be featured.
The photographic finishing and en
larging for the Quad is being done by
special arrangement with Marsh and
Company of San Francisco.
Besides being the largest Quad in
Stanford annals, the 1917 year book
will come in the nature of a decennial
anniversary of the big earthquake. A
special department nf full page views
will show the university as it stood
before the 190fi tremblor, as it was im
mediately afterward, and as we know
it today.
This year there have been more pic
tures to date than ever before. Put
those few remaining who claim affilia
tion with the third year class should
have their class photos added at once
j to the list in order that the 1917 an
nual may live up to its slogan—
I "Everybody's Quad."
Organization pictures have not been
j coming in so fast. Application for
space must be made immediately, and
absolutely no organization pictures re
ceived later than February 1 will be
accepted for publication. Space must
be paid for before this date.
