# STANFORD ALUMNI TO BE CONSULTED ON ATHLETICS
## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ACTS Membership In New Pacific Coast Conference Is Problem 
### 
After hearing Student Body Presi
dent Wilson's repart of the Pacific
Northwest Conference convention, and
his account of the formation of a new
combination to be called the Pacific
Coast Conference, with California,
Washington, Oregon, and Oregon Agri
cultural College as members, the Ex
ecutive Committee this afternoon
adopted the following resolution:
That any action concerning Stanford's
entry into the Pacific Coast Confer
ence be referred to the San Francisco
and other alumni of the university.
This action was taken after a thor
ough discussion of the question and
it was felt that the matter was of too
great importance to be decided at once.
An expression of more mature opinion
is desired by the committee before
anything is done.
An invitation to join the new con
ference, which excludes freshmen
from varsity competition, was extend
ed to Stanford while Wilson and Beh
rens were in the north. No action was
taken at that time.
Graduate Manager Behrens has not
yet returned to the campus, but is ex
pected back eithe.r this afternoon or
tomorrow morning.
No other business was transacted by
the Executive Committee.
