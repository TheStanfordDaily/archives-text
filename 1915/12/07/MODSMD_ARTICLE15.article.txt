## Heads Original Poems Which Prove Buoyant, Virile, and Sincere 
### 
"This war will do one of two things
for modern literature," said Mr. Al
fred Noyes yesterday evening in the
chapel. "Eithe.r it will destroy the
decadent tendency toward pessimism
in European writing today and give
literature a fresh start in Europe, or
it will kill modern literary effort there
entirely and will place in the hands of
this country the future of the litera
ture of the world."
Mr. Noyes' own poetry as he read it
to us last evening, certainly shows no
signs of this destroying pessimism. It
is virile, buoyant, and has the unmis
takable ring of sincerity. From the
first poem, ' The Admiral's Ghost," in
which Mr. Noyes made feel that he
knows the 'salt, sharp sea" as only
the native of a sea-fa.ring nation can,
the poet ran the gamut of gaiety and
pathos. The last poem read was called
"Intercession," and was written for
Intercession Day which was celebrated
last January in England.
