With today's issue, volume 47 of The
Daily Palo Alto is completed. The
editor uses this inadequate means, of
expressing appreciation of the work
which ha* been done ungrudgingly by
the staff during the semester. The
staff ot' The Daily Palo Alto carries
less dead wood than any other campus
organization. The members of the
staff give more time and effort to Stan
ford w r elfare than do the members of
any other organization of students.
They earn little beside the joy which
comes from working well, and the re
spect of the people who work with
them.
This swan song is nearly finished.
The Daily Palo Alto will be directed
by competent hands next semester. In
closing we give our official blessing.
