# Belgian Workers Sail for America
## Professors V S. Kellogg and S.S. Seward Will Return to Campus 
### 
Professors Vernon S. Kellogg and S.
S. Seward of the Stanford faculty, now
on leave of absence in Europe to aid
in Belgium relief work, sail today for
home on the Holland-American line,
according to two cablegrams received
on the campus this morning. Both
men were at The Red House, the Lon
don headquarters of H. C. Hoover,
when cablegrams we,re sent to Stan
ford.
Contrary to reports circulated on the
campus and in this neighborhood sev
eral times during the last week, Pro
fessor Kellogg will not go to Poland to
assume charge of relief work there.
During the last few months he has
been working in Poland at the request
of the German government and promi
nent. Polish people, investigating con
ditions. Presumably his work of in
vestigation lias been finished, and a
report has been made of conditions
there. This report was recently par
tially printed in a number of American
newspapers.
Professor Seward of the English de
partment has been in Belgium since
the early part of last summer. Both
he and Professor Kellogg will be on
the campus in time to take up instruc
tion at Stanford the first days of next
semester. Professor Kellogg heads
the department of Entomology.
Doctor Frank Angell, who leaves
Stanford Friday, will enter in the relief
service, supposedly in Belgium, though
his exact position has not vet been
chosen.
