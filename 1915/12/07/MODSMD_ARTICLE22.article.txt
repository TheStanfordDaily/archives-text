To the Editor:
With your permission 1 should like
to correct a misapprehension into
which your reporter has fallen in his
notice of my address before the Sociol
ogy Club last night. lam afraid I did
not make my meaning clear. Far from
intending to criticize adversely the
the present personnel of the California
Commissions which 1 had occasion to
mention, 1 had meant to express the
very high opinion I hold not only of
their devotion to their duties but also
of the ability with which they have
discharged them. The points I had
wished to make were first, that these
duties were made unnecessarily diffi
cult by the combination in a single
body of administrative and judicial
functions and second, that the experi
ence of other states forbids us to look
forward very confidently to the perma
nence of the standards of achievement
set by our present commissions unless
we can continue to fill positions on
them with men of the professional
training and the professional ideals
needed fo,r the essentially judicial
functions committed to them.
Yours very truly.
C. A. HUSTON.
