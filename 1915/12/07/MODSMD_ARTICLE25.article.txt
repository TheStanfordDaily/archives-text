Oli, strike the gladsome joyous lyre
And sing a song of glee,
Of lazy days, of breezy days,
Of loafing by the sea.
Of evenings spent away from books
That threat to make us lean;
O: 1 fond farewell to midnight oil—
We'll annoint with gasoline.
Hut stay—if you were leaving now,
With parchment and degree
To step the treadmill wheel of life —
What would your song then be?
Say, would you wear a half-mast face
And sing a doleful tune?
How college days passed like a flash. —
Were over much too soon.
If you were planning such a dirge
To make you downright blue and
glum.
Remember that these happy days
Are tastes of bette.r ones to come.
