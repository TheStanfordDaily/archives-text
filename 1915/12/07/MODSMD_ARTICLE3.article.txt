# GAY AND GIDDY CHAPPIE DUE
## Merry Finals Number Will Stir Things Up Friday 
### 
Look for a decided change in the
weather Friday morning, when the
Merry Finals number of Chaparral
stirs things up on the Quad. If you
happen to have your weather eye on
the campus barometer you may see
it throw up its hands before its face
in shame and holy horror, for the De
cember funny book offers something
in the way of weather and atmosphere
entirely foreign to Peninsula climes.
F. S. Murray's cover is epoch-making.
It will set you to thinking—it will set
the weather Gods to thinking, and it
will make the weather cock on the
farm barn turn around and upside
down in frantic bewilderment.
Fast and fancy art work and much
of it, characterizes the contribution of
old jester this month. "A Star of the
East," a finished piece of work by W.
W. (lores, '17, is the eye-opener listed
as frontispiece.
Snoppy-Quop number three is fun
nier than ever. Art Editor Murray
offers our most popular movie come
dian engrossed in conversation with
something that must be a cross be
tween the Pope and your aunt's bird
cage. Jim Wallace, '17, comes to the
front with an illustrated war bulletin,
i that shows Wallace at his best. As a
| hint to the early or late shopper, Chap
pie offers a picture gallery or tentative
j Christmas presents for the whole
family.
Lost among a million or more jokes
and short verse, Editor H. M. Levy, '16,
has inserted much clever and capri
cious literary matter, prominent
among which are an assortment of
Christmas "Thank You" letters, some
"Campus Con-versation," a bit of Walt
Mason-like verse titled, .'The Eve Be
fore New Years," and a page of red
fire labeled "Bobby Burnit." Editor
Levy himself offers "Now That," re
garding our extension of arbitration
to Stroud university; says "Thumbs
Down" on finals; extends a cheery
word about Xmas gifts; puts in a
' good word for making swimming a
minor sport, and announces the elec
tion of three new men to the ranks
of Hammer and Coffin Society,

Look for a decided change in the
weather Friday morning, when the
Merry Finals number of Chaparral
stirs things up on the Quad. If you
happen to have your weather eye on
the campus barometer you may see
it throw up its hands before its face
in shame and holy horror, for the De
cember funny book offers something
in the way of weather and atmosphere
entirely foreign to Peninsula climes.
F. S. Murray's cover is epoch-making.
It will set you to thinking—it will set
the weather Gods to thinking, and it
will make the weather cock on the
farm barn turn around and upside
down in frantic bewilderment.
Fast and fancy art work and much
of it, characterizes the contribution of
old jester this month. "A Star of the
East," a finished piece of work by W.
W. (lores, '17, is the eye-opener listed
as frontispiece.
Snoppy-Quop number three is fun
nier than ever. Art Editor Murray
offers our most popular movie come
dian engrossed in conversation with
something that must be a cross be
tween the Pope and your aunt's bird
cage. Jim Wallace, '17, comes to the
front with an illustrated war bulletin,
i that shows Wallace at his best. As a
| hint to the early or late shopper, Chap
pie offers a picture gallery or tentative
j Christmas presents for the whole
family.
Lost among a million or more jokes
and short verse, Editor H. M. Levy, '16,
has inserted much clever and capri
cious literary matter, prominent
among which are an assortment of
Christmas "Thank You" letters, some
"Campus Con-versation," a bit of Walt
Mason-like verse titled, .'The Eve Be
fore New Years," and a page of red
fire labeled "Bobby Burnit." Editor
Levy himself offers "Now That," re
garding our extension of arbitration
to Stroud university; says "Thumbs
Down" on finals; extends a cheery
word about Xmas gifts; puts in a
' good word for making swimming a
minor sport, and announces the elec
tion of three new men to the ranks
of Hammer and Coffin Society,
