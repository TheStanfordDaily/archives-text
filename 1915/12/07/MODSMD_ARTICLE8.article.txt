# SORORITIES TO PLEDGE AT MATRICULATION HEREAFTER
## SUMMER RUSHING RESULT Pan-Hellenic Adopts Contract Providing for Lawyer Bidding System 
### 
After a construction period of about
one month, the sorority houses on the
campus have drawn up a contract to
govern next year's rushing. The old
system of formal rushing has been
entirely done away with, giving place
to Matriculation day pledging. The
new system involves summer rushing,
an early return to the campus on the
part of the women, with bidding by the
lawyer system on freshman matricula
tion day, and informal rushing and
bidding the rest of the semester.
The strain on all concerned which
has accompanied former rushing sea
sons will be lacking under the new
plan, as a great part of the rushing is
over by the time classes begin.
