## ALUMNI BODIES UNANIMOUS FOR EXCLUSION OF THE FIRST YEAR MEN P.R. Wilson in Letter Asks Berkeley Executive to Aid Arbitration 
### 
In view of the resolution passed by
the Stanford Executive Committee at
its final meeting last semester, to
place the matter of athletic relations
between Stanford and California be
fore the alumni of the University and
to abide by their decision, and also
in view of the conclusion reached by
the various alumni bodies, Student
Body President P. R. Wilson has sub
mitted the following letter to Charles
E. Street, President of the California
student body:
Wilson's Letter.
Mr. Chas. E. Street,
President Associated Students,
University of California,
Berkeley, California.
Dear Sir:
A group of Stanford Alumni
have recently suggested to the
Stanford Student Body that the
agreement committees of the two
universities, that is, Stanford and
California, meet with a view of
bringing back athletic competition
between the two institutions.
The suggestions of the commit
tee were as follows:
1. That a general disavowal of
intent to imply improper conduct
on the part of either university
in the conduct of its athletic af
fairs be made by the student ex
ecutive committees of each uni
versity.
Kliniinnte Freshmen.
2. That Stanford eliminate fresh
men from participation in Inter
collegiate Athletics upon three
conditions as follows:
a. That the University of Cali
fornia agree to require of athletes
the same relative standard of
scholarship as that required at
Stanford.
b. That students from the Af
filiated colleges be barred from
Intercollegiate contests, with cer
tain modifications.
c. That the students of the Agri
cultural Farm at Davis be barred
from participation in Intercollegi
ate contests, with certain modifi
cations.
Agreement Should lÂ»e Easy.
Inasmuch as this is practically
what the committees agreed upon
before the break, it should be
comparatively easy for them to
arrive at a definite settlement.
1 have notified Mr. Barrett,
chairman of our committee, and
all that is needed for an early
restoration of athletic .relations
between California and Stanford,
is a meeting between the two
agreement committees. I suggest,
therefore, that you notify your
committee of our willingness to
meet with them and that the date
for the meeting be set for the early
part of next week. I should sug
gest Monday as a very convenient
day.
Hoping that you may find it
within your powe.r to act promptly
in this matter, I beg to remain,
Very sincerely yours,
(Signed) P. R. WILSON.
The basis for settlement in the above
letter is taken verbatim from a report
of the Alumni Committee of San Fran
cisco, sent to Wilson January 4, after
an exhaustive consideration of the
trouble between the two universities.
This committee is composed of Leland
W. Cutler, Fred L. Berry, John T.
Nourse, Richard W. Barrett, A. L.
Trowbridge and W. II. B. Fowler.
.Mutual Concessions.
The recommendation made by this
committee was not actuated by any
feeling that there is a necessity for
the elimination of freshmen, but rather
I in a spirit of mutual concession. Due
to the fact that California feels so
j strongly than the first-year men must
go, the committee deemed it just and
equitable to give them up in return
for a higher scholarship standard at
California and the elimination of stu
dents from the Affiliated Colleges and
Davis, with certain modifications.
Wiinfs Itughy.
In addition to the recommendations
1 regarding freshmen, the San Francisco
Alumni Committee went on record as
favoring the retention of rugby. The
reasons given for taking this stand are
that rugby is not. only a better game
for the athlete from a mental and
physical point of view, but is also
more interesting to the spectator. The
committee also believes that rugby is
the game of the future for American
colleges.
Whether or not Stanford and Cali
fornia meet in football, it was recom
mended that immediate stops be taken
to insure competition in track, base
ball, rowing, tennis, basketball and
soccer. Xo special recommendation
was made in regard to joining the
Pacific Coast Conference, but the indi
vidual sentiment of the committee is
that post-season competition is unde
sirable.
liOS Angeles Opinion.
The opinion of the alumni in and
around Los Angeles was strongly in
favor of giving up freshmen if neces
sary for the resumption of athletic re
lations with the Blue and Gold. While
the feeling is general that playing
freshmen is not a cardinal sin, it was
j felt that more good could be done by
! their elimination.
As far as the merits of rugby and
American football were concerned, the
former was an easy favorite with the
i Southerners, but a good majority of
| them feel that, notwithstanding the
j superiority of rugby, more is to be
; gained by playing the American game.
Among those who spoke in favor of
changing was "Deke" Gard, captain of
Stanford's victorious varsity of 1914.
The general sentiment of the Port
land alumni is to get together at. any
cost. They feel that the Big Game is
the real thing, and that any obstacle
which stands in its way should be
swept aside.
