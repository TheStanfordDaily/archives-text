# Glee Club Makes "Hit" in Hawaii
## 
### 
Stanford Glee Club scored a decisive
hit for the University with a holiday
excursion to the Hawaiian Islands on
the "Great Northern." Three appear
ances were made hy (lie Stanford sing
ers.
The Club gave one concert in Hono
lulu and one on the boat each way,
making three appearances in all. The
steamer concerts were naturally given
good receptions, but the main per
formance, which was given at the
Royal Hawaiian Opera House in Mono
lulu drew an immense audience and
was enthusiastically received. The
Hawaiian newspapers were very pro
fuse in their praise of the entertain
ment, speaking highly not only of the
chorus and solo work of the Club, but
of the stunt work by J. R. Morgan. '16
and J. A. Patten, '15.
According to those who made the
trip, the people of the Hawaiian
Islands are excellent hosts. The Stan
ford Alumni and the Hawaiian Country
Club had a varied assortment of enter
tainments for the "songsters," some
of which were, bathing at the renown
ed beach at llilo, a visit to the promi
nent nearby plantations, a tour of the
city of Honolulu, and a trip to the
volcano of Kilauea, which is always I
in eruption. Contrary to the usual
tour taken by a university organiza
tion, this one was a financial success,
being well managed by the president
of the Club, C. F. Joyce, '16 and the
manager, J. Higley, '17.

Stanford Glee Club scored a decisive
hit for the University with a holiday
excursion to the Hawaiian Islands on
the "Great Northern." Three appear
ances were made hy (lie Stanford sing
ers.
The Club gave one concert in Hono
lulu and one on the boat each way,
making three appearances in all. The
steamer concerts were naturally given
good receptions, but the main per
formance, which was given at the
Royal Hawaiian Opera House in Mono
lulu drew an immense audience and
was enthusiastically received. The
Hawaiian newspapers were very pro
fuse in their praise of the entertain
ment, speaking highly not only of the
chorus and solo work of the Club, but
of the stunt work by J. R. Morgan. '16
and J. A. Patten, '15.
According to those who made the
trip, the people of the Hawaiian
Islands are excellent hosts. The Stan
ford Alumni and the Hawaiian Country
Club had a varied assortment of enter
tainments for the "songsters," some
of which were, bathing at the renown
ed beach at llilo, a visit to the promi
nent nearby plantations, a tour of the
city of Honolulu, and a trip to the
volcano of Kilauea, which is always I
in eruption. Contrary to the usual
tour taken by a university organiza
tion, this one was a financial success,
being well managed by the president
of the Club, C. F. Joyce, '16 and the
