# Intercollegiate Peace

Stanford has extended the olive
branch to California â€”and it is a
good, substantial branch 011 which the
particular bird of the dove variety
which presides over intercollegiate
relations should have 110 trouble in
lighting and resting for many a day.
The suggestions of the San Francisco
alumni, voicing sentiments similar to
those of other alumni organizations,
seem to offer a basis of settlement of
the present difficulties which should
lead, in the near future, to an agree
ment between the two universities.
The expressed wish of most of the
students of both California and Stan
ford that the old friends should settle
their differences and fight it out for
supremacy in spring sports is in a
fair way to be realized.
We realize that President Wilson's
letter to President Street of the As
sociated Students of the University of
California contains a big concession in
the offer to give up the use of fresh
men in intercollegiate competition. It
is a big concession because the desire
for freshman participation is based
on a fundamental principle here at
Stanford which is seldom expressed
in words but underlies our whole
scheme of things, that every man shall
be given an equal chance and the
greatest amount of consideration on
the athletic field regardless of his
class or his ability in the sport.
California will also make substan
tial concessions if an agreement is
reached based 011 the suggestions
made by the San Francisco alumni.
Stanford has long been at a disad
vantage in meeting California because
of a higher standard of scholarship
required by the Stanford faculty than
by the California faculty for partici
pation in athletics. This handicap
will be removed if the scholarship re
quirements at California are raised to
the same level.
The abolition of students in the Af
filiated colleges and at Davis Farm
will cut out a large number of stud
ents from participation. It is true
that their residence away from the
University has made participation for
them extremely difficult, but in glanc
ing over the pages of athletic history
the names of a number of stars will
be revealed who registered in these
departments in the University.
Since charges of professionalism
against certain Stanford students
made unofficially were one of the pri
mary reasons for the break in inter
collegiate relations, the requirement
that a disavowal of the intent to make
all such charges is important and
must be met, if the two universities
are to reach an agreement. Since any
intent to make such charges has also
been denied by the California mem
bers of the Intercollegiate Agreement
Committee, this provision should
cause no halt in agreement proceed
ings.
California students have often
made the statement that they desire
to return to athletic relations with
Stanford. If these statements were
sincerely made, and we believe they
were, there should be no trouble in
resuming relations. The first, step,
which is always the hardest, has been
taken.
