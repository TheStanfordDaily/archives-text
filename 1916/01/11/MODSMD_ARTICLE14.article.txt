## Dr. Bailey Willis Praises Stanford Ex-President In Article on "Geology I" 
### 
Dr. Bailey Willis, head of the Geol
ogy department, is the author of the
leading article of the December
"Alumnus," published during the latter
part of the holidays. Under the title
"Geology I," D.r. Willis tells of Dr.
Branner's department, summing up his
tribute to the retiring president of the
university and former head of the
Geology department in the final para
graph: "The power that in Geology 1
gave dull facts inspiring force, the sin
cerity, earnestness and human sym
pathy that draw strong men to him,
the idealism wedded to common sense
that distinguishes him; all these Dr.
Branner has left us as a priceless leg
acy for his department."
"No farewell to Dr. Branner," is the
title of an article dwelling on the fact
that while Dr. Branner is no longer
president of the university, lie is still
the same "strong friendly man, with
a twinkle in the eye and a sympathetic
though unobtrusive understanding of
the problems of young men."
