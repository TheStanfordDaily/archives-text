# Track Team May Compete in East
## 
### 
That the Stanford track team will
invade the realm of the Eastern col
leges next summer, is now practically
assured. Graduate Manager Behrens
has begun negotiations for participa
tion in the big contest of the year, the
annual meet of the Intercollegiate
Amateur Athletic Association of
America. Not until the meeting of
the Association officials in March, will
it be definitely known whether or not
the Cardinal will be able to take part
in the East's big track event.
First Far Fast Trip.
Although Stanford lias sent several
track teams to the middle west, no
attempt has heretofore been made to
match the Cardinal against the col
leges of the extreme east. In case the
arrangements for Stanford's partici
pation in the 112. C. A. A. A. A. meet aro
satisfactorily completed, attempts
will lie made to schedule a dual con
test with one of the big eastern uni
versities, to take place immediately
preceding or following the big con
test.
Though several of last year's star
track men will bo lost to the team, by
far the majority of the point winners
in the Stanford-California meet of last
year will again be on the squad,
which will bo strengthened by the ad
dition of a number of reliable con
testants.
