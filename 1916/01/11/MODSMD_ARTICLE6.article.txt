# CREW PREPARES FOR 1916 SEASON
## 
### 
With a new coaching launch en
route from the factory in Seattle to
Redwood Hay, and the Stanford shell
on its way back from New York, prep
arations for the 1910 rowing season
are well under way, and active train
ing on the part of the team will begin
at once. Until the launch and shell
arrive, and are put into service on
Redwood Hay, Lagunita will serve for
training purposes.
Seven Veterans Hack.
That Stanford will have a winning
crew is practically assured, as seven
of last year's eight men will again
bo out for the team. Hloeser is the
only one of the men out of the com
petition, he being barred by the five
year rule. Last year's veterans who
will compete for places on the crew
are Captain-elect Orme, ex-Captain
Jacomini, McEwen, Rogers, Croon,
Worth, Rohm, and Hulsman, while
Coxswain Johnny Goodman will lie
on hand to guide the shell. To direct
this aggregation, "Husky" Guerena,
the "Hero of Poughkeepsie," will con
tinue as head coach of the Cardinal
crews.
Tn addition to the increased con

venience brought about by obtaining
the new launch, which though it cost
$ 1000, is expectcd to be an economy,
there will be other improvements as
well. Among these will be a complete
new set of aluminium oars. Because
of the success of the new oars in the
east, a pair of the metal blades were
experimented with here, and found so
satisfactory that Graduate Manager
Hehrens has ordered twelve of the
new oars. They are more expensive
than those formerly used, but as they
are both stronger and lighter, it was
though advisable to equip the shell
with oars similar to those used by
practically all of the Eastern crews.
Hiiek to I'ouglikeepsfe.
Though the date for the Pough
keepsie meet was originally set for
June 17, there has been some talk of
changing ti e race to July 4. In either
case, Stanford will be represented
in the Eastern classic. Stanford has
been invited to enter in the Hudson
race, whether they win the Pacific
Coast championship or not, but for the
present the chief interest will center
around the race with Washington 011
either April 8 or 15.
