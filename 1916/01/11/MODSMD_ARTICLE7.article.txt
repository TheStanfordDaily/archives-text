# Dr. A.T. Murray Is New Faculty Athletic Head
## Named to Succeed Dr. Frank Angell As Chief of Important Faculty Committee 
### 
Professor A. T. Murray of the
Greek department is the new chair
man of the Faculty Athletic commit
tee, taking the place of Dr. Frank
Angell, who is now in Europe on re
lief work. Dr. Angell has been head
of the Faculty Athletic committee for
many years and is largely responsible
for the stand which Stanford has
taken on athletic questions. No other
change was made in the committeee.
No Changes in I'olicy.
Professor Murray has been keenly
interested in athletics for some time,
and says that no change will be made
in the Cardinal policies in the future.
The Stanford athletic policy, as the
faculty sees it, was clearly outlined
in a letter by Dr. Angell, which
was made public with the full ap
proval of the faculty committee and
President Ray Lyman Wilbur.
No Clin nee for American.
According to the letter, there is no
chance for introduction of "the inter
ference game of football," American,
on the Stanford campus, because it
brings with it conditions that are ab
solutely unfavorable to college ath
letics.
The letter follows:
Acting President J. M. Stillman,
Stanford University.
My Dear Sir:
Early this semester, a state-
ment defining the athletic policy
of this University, was sent out,
as you will remember, signed by
the chairman of the Faculty Ath
letic Committee, the Physical
Director, and the Manager of the
Associated Students.
This document stated that in
the opinion of the writers the old
or interference game of football,
which had been abolished at the
University nine years, was still
in conflict with the principle of
general participation in athletes
which led to its abolishment.
The Athletic committee endorses
the views set forth in the docu
ment referred to and takes this
opportunity of making a formal
statement of its views.
The committee finds that the
factors which led to the abolish
ment of the old or interference
game of football at this Univer
sity are still operative. It is still
a coaches' game and not a play
ers' game. At this University we
stand in intercollegiate competi
tion for matching the skill and
muscle of the students themselves
and not for a competition of the
ingenuity and driving power of
hired men.
The selection of players on the
basis of weight instead of skill is
as common as it was when the
game was abolished at Stanford.
The nature of a game itself car
ried out by a system of signals
bars it from the broad and elas
tic participation wq find in all
player-made games.
Under these conditions this
committee desires to announce
formally that the interference
game of football has 110 prospect
of being admitted to the rank of
intercollegiate games at Stanford
University.
Very truly yours,
FRANK ANGELL.
