# Professors Return From Relief Work in Belgium
## V.L. Kellogg is Supplanted by Dr. Angell On Commission In Europe. 
### 
Professors S. S. Seward and V. L.
Kellogg have returned to the campus
from their work 011 the relief com
mission in Belgium. Both will resume
their classes this semester. Professor
Kellogg had charge of the relief work
over the whole of Belgium and North
ern France, and his place on the com
mission will be taken by Dr. Frank
Angell, who left the campus last
month for Europe.
Professor Seward, while in Belgium,
was in charge of the work in Hasselt,
in Limburg. He describes the relief
work as very efficiently organized.
The country is divided into provinces
and communes, with one man in
charge of the distribution of supplies
in each commune.
California has been prominent in
the relief work in Europe, there
being eight Californians on the com
mission. Under the able drection of
Mr. Hoover the conditions have been
materially improved in Belgium. It
was in great measure due to the ef
forts of Professor Kellogg that the
commission was allowed by the Ger
man authorities to distribute supplies
in Northern France.
