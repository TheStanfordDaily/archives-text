A pretty girl,
A summer night,
A man,
And he'll succeed, O!
Because his pipe
Is filled with sweet
And mel-
Low, rich TUXEDO!
Get yourself properly Tux-ified and you'll make
all rivals look as though they were tied to a post —
'cause there's no tobacco made that rivals Tuxedo for
speeding things up.
You just can't taste the savory flavor and whiff the snappy
fragrance of "Tux" without feeling the spirit of hustle
shooting through your whole system.

The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
And no wonder! For there's no tobacco leaf in the
wide world so rich as the choice,
ripe Burley that Tuxedo is made
of. When this wonderful leaf is @
mellowed to perfect mildness and
every last bit of bite taken out by
the original "Tuxedo Process" you
have a smoke that's packed full
of life and joy and satisfaction.
Try Tuxedo for a week.
