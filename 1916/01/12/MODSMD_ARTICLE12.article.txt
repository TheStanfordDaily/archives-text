As the result of the letter of Student

dent Charles Street of the University
of California Student Body, a meeting
of the agreement committees of the
two universities will he held next Fri
day evening at the Palace Hotel in
San Francisco, at which, it is ex
pected, Stanford and California will
come to an agreement and resume
athletic relations.
President Street of California ex
pressed strong belief that there will
he no difficulties in the way of agree
ment, once the freshman elimination
question is settled.
Meeting Arranged bj Plione.
The agreement meeting of the com
mittees from the two institutions was
arranged by phone between Wilson
and Street yesterday. Street phoned
to Wilson as soon as the letter from
the Stanford executive reached Berk
eley.
California is willing to make dis
avowal of any indirect charges that
may have been made concerning the
Stanford attitude 011 athletics and
professionalism. This California did
disavow in a letter to Stanford last
semester.
Now that the Stanford policy in re
gard to first year athletes has been
changed as the result of recommenda
tions from alumni bodies along the
coast, it seems likely that no dif
ficulties will be encountered in reach
ing a basis on which Stanford and
California teams can compete.
Stanford will be represented at the
meeting by 11. W. Barrett, George
Presley, A. W. Ambrose, E. C. Beh
rens and P. R. Wilson. In case Am
brose is not able to attend the meet
ing, R. W. B. Fowler will substitute.
.Meet at the Palace.
The meeting will be called at the
Palace Hotel at 6:30 p.m. It is
thought that a brief business meeting
will be sufficient to bring matters to
a point at which the graduate man
agers of the universities can begin
work on schedules for spring sports.
