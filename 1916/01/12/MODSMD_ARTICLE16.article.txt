# Try-Outs
## 
### 
Tryouts for positions on The Daily
Palo Alto staff will start immediately
to continue over a five week period.
Candidates will report at the office to
morrow at 2 o'clock.
This announcement is more than an
offer of an opportunity to people in
terested in journalism to try out for
The Daily, it is a sincere invitation
extended with the hope that it will be
accepted. The .staff, right now, is the
smallest it has been for a consider
able time. There are vacant places
to be filled by people who are willing
to give a part of their time and a lot
of energy to working on the paper
during the tryout period and after.
The vacant places won't be filled by
putting new names on the list of staff
members alone, for the people who
are leaving were workers.
There is no magical "Open Sesame"
which will admit to the staff nor is
there any political clique that will
have to be mollified by the candi
dates.
The final selection will be made on
merit shown during the tryout period.
Candidates need not be freshmen.
Both men and women of other classes
will be appointed.
