# ESTATE IS OPENED TO HOME BUILDERS
## Board of Trustees to Lease Campus Sites For Terms of Years to Non-University People 
### 
Outsiders may build on the campus
on terms not very different from those
now available to members of the fac
ulty, according: to plans now being
completed by the Stanford Hoard of
Trustees. For a number of years there
has been some demand for such a
lease. As a result, the Hoard of Trus
tees is now drawing up lease forms
by which it will permit non-university
people satisfactory to the board to
lease residence plots either on the
basis of ground rental, to increase
by ten-year intervals, or on a basis
of a ilat rental for a term not to ex
ceed forty years.
Unlike the case where the leases
are made by faculty people, the Hoard
of Trustees will not advance money
for the building of residences by out
siders. All connections for water,
gas and sewers will be paid for by the
lessees, who will also have to pay for
their own sidewalks. All improve
ments will revert to the university at
the expiration of the lease.
Many people now living elsewhere
will probably take advantage of this
offer by which they can build on very
desirable campus sites. This move by
the trustees may eventually result in
the building lip of a large community
around the university.
Approve President's House Plans.
Plans for the new president's house,
drawn by Louis Mullgardt, who de
signed Mullgardt's Tower and the
Court of Ages at the Panama-Pacific
Exposition, were approved by the
Hoard of Trustees. Husiness Manager
Stow was authorized to call for bids
for the construction of the president
ial residence. Decision has not yet
been reached as to the exact site of
the proposed mansion.
Plan Inauguration Hay IjiiiHi.
Formal cognizance was taken by the
trustees of 1 lie notification by the Fac
ulty Committee on public exercises
that the installation ceremonies at the
inauguration of I'resident Wilbur will
be on Saturday afternoon, January 22.
It was decided to hold the luncheon
at Encina Hall, at noon of that day,,
as on the occasion of the installation
of President Hranner.
I
Maintain Appointment Secretary.
An appropriation was made from
the general funds by the board for
maintenance of the office of appoint
ment secretary lor this semester. The
appointment secretary's office is a
general clearing house for Stanford
graduates seeking positions, and com
panies and institutions desiring their
services. Hereafter the maintenance
of this office will probably be cared
for in the regular budget as form
erly.
The special gymnasium fee for
women which was voted last year,
when it was supposed that a swim
ming pool for the women would be
completed by the beginning of this
semester, will not be collected, the
pool not having been built.

Formal cognizance was taken by the
trustees of 1 lie notification by the Fac
ulty Committee on public exercises
that the installation ceremonies at the
inauguration of I'resident Wilbur will
be on Saturday afternoon, January 22.

I
Maintain Appointment Secretary.
An appropriation was made from
the general funds by the board for
maintenance of the office of appoint
ment secretary lor this semester. The
appointment secretary's office is a
general clearing house for Stanford
graduates seeking positions, and com
panies and institutions desiring their
services. Hereafter the maintenance
of this office will probably be cared
for in the regular budget as form
erly.
The special gymnasium fee for
women which was voted last year,
when it was supposed that a swim
ming pool for the women would be
completed by the beginning of this
semester, will not be collected, the
pool not having been built.

H. \V. Mosby, of the Queensland ex

Or. T. Matsura of the Japanese Im

A collection of coal tar products
was donated by the Barrett Manu
facturing company.
Outsiders may build on the campus
on terms not very different from those
now available to members of the fac
ulty, according: to plans now being
completed by the Stanford Hoard of
Trustees. For a number of years there
has been some demand for such a
lease. As a result, the Hoard of Trus
tees is now drawing up lease forms
by which it will permit non-university
people satisfactory to the board to
lease residence plots either on the
basis of ground rental, to increase
by ten-year intervals, or on a basis
of a ilat rental for a term not to ex
ceed forty years.
Unlike the case where the leases
are made by faculty people, the Hoard
of Trustees will not advance money
for the building of residences by out
siders. All connections for water,
gas and sewers will be paid for by the
lessees, who will also have to pay for
their own sidewalks. All improve
ments will revert to the university at
the expiration of the lease.
Many people now living elsewhere
will probably take advantage of this
offer by which they can build on very
desirable campus sites. This move by
the trustees may eventually result in
the building lip of a large community
around the university.
