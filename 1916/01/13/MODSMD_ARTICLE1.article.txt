# ASSEMBLY TO CONSIDER CONCILIATION IS AUTHORIZED
## NEXT WEEK PROBABLE TIME Executive Committee Accepts Recommendations of San Francisco Alumni 
### 
An assembly of the student body to
consider the matter of conciliation
with California was authorized by the
Executive Committee at its meeting
held last evening. Just when it can
be held it not yet certain, but it
will probably be some time next week.
At this meeting the entire question
will be brought before the students.
It was found impossible to have the
assembly before the meeting of the
Intercollegiate Agreement Commit
tees, which is scheduled for tomorrow
night. Aside from the lack of time,
there is also a dearth of definite ma
terial to present for discussion. After
the meeting there will be information
of a more tangible nature on which
to proceed.
Siiu Francisco Report Accepted.
The report of the San Francisco
Alumni Committee relative to inter
collegiate relations was read, and the
recommendations were accepted in
full. This committee, which advised
the elimination of freshmen and the
retention of rugby, is the official com
mittee appointed by President P. R.
Wilson to consider and report on in
tercollegiate affairs. It is greatly due
to the nature of this report that pros
pects for a reconciliation are so
bright.
Los Anueles Resolutions.
The formal resolutions adopted by
the Stanford Club of Los Angeles were
read, no action being taken. The sen
timent of the Southern alumni coin
cides with that of San Francisco in
regard to tlie elimination of freshmen.
Actuated by a desire to further the
the best interests of Stanford, and
believing that, in the present crisis,
those interests can best be served by
giving up freshmen, they offer the
following advice:
"Be It Resolved by the Stanford
Club of Los Angeles that while the
members of that organization pledge
themselves to the support of the
course adopted by the Student Body
of Leland Stanford Junior University,
whatever it may be, they earnestly
urge the adoption by the University of
the so-called Freshman Rule,' barring
students of freshman standing from
competition in all intercollegiate con
tests."
