# White Sox Want Terry
## Comiskey and Rowland Seriously Consider Former Stanford Man 
### 
According to reports from eastern
baseball circles, Zeb Terry, '14, for
mer star shortstop and captain of the
Stanford team, is being seriously con
sidered by owner Comiskey and Man
ager Rowland of the Chicago White
Sox for a regular berth on the Sox
American League team during the
coming season.
Manager Rowland says that Terry is
one of the best prospects he has ever
seen. There is a great possibility that
Weaver will be shifted to third base
so that the former Cardinal star can
work out in his old position at short
stop. Terry, however, has a hard row
to hoe, with such men as Moriarity,
Blackburne, Jones, McMullen and
Weaver in line for the berth.
