# FATE OF FRESHMAN HANGS ON WEATHER
## Disturbed Palo Alto Quietude on Motorcycle and Will Have to Take Consequences 
### 
V. C. Summer field, '19, from Reno,
Nev., is happy for one reason, and one
only. The one and only is—ah, but
that's the story.
'Way back in the dark and muddy
ages of the last days of last semester,
Summerfield violated the sacred slum
ber and placid stillness of Palo Alto
by dashing down the main thorough
fare at the appalling speed of enough
miles per hour to make the natives
wake up and take notice. This hap
pened on one of those gray and grim
motorcycles that shoot out from under
you when you're not looking.
No, he wasn't caught. Exam week
came and went, and took Summerfield
far away to Reno. He wishes he had
stayed there. His trial is set for the
very near future. Summerfield hates
trials.
"Oh, for that dear Reno, Nevada,"
he sighs.
But he's happy for one reason—this
isn't fine weather.
