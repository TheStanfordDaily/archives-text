# Masquers to Offer Year's First Drama
## Three Well Known One-Act Plays Will Be Presented On February 4 
### 
Three one-act plays by modern
dramatists are the choice of Mas
quers Society tor the first theatrical
offering of the college year. On Fri
day evening, February 4, the Assembly
Hall footlights will illuminate J. M.
Ikirrie's "Rosalind," Maeterlinck's
"The interior," and Hartley Manner's
"Happiness." These three well known
one-act plays form a combination that
will offer sheer comedy, pathos, and
the darker side of life in more than
pleasing form and proportion.
Masquers selected their cast late
this afternoon. The choice of play
ers for their spring dramatic venture
requires that unusual care be used
in the selection of the leading parts
for the trio, inasmuch as a wide range
of character portrayal in the carrying
of the different roles will be demanded.
The decision to offer three plays in
stead of one was made by Masquers
some time ago. The success of the so
ciety's "Jinks," and of the three-part
English Club evening, last semester,
was evidence of the popularity of this
form of amousement.
Mr. Arthur Cyril, of San Jose, has
been selected as coach for the produc
tion of February 4. Mr. Cyril will be
remembered for his work with the
cast of "Bobby Purnit," the 1918 So
phomore play, which set a new stand
ard of success both financially and
dramatically.
