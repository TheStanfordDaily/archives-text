Eighty-three new students arrived
on the campus 011 registration day to
begin tlicir work in the University.
The list is swelling from day to day
as late newcomers arrive, and Stan
lord is glad to have them all. The
following bit of advice is addressed to
them, especially to the freshmen who
are entering college for the first time.
Student government is something
you will come in contact with every
day you are at Stanford. In the ord
inary run of things you will be aware
of this only in the sense that you are
aware of being governed by the fed
eral authorities at Washington. Rea
sonable government is a thing we be
come accustomed to and though it
affects 11s vitally we take little notice
of its detailed activities. May the
times you will run up against student
government in any unpleasant fashion
be few.
You know that you have had 110
trouble in avoiding conflict with gov
ernment before you came to Stanford.
If you did have such a misfortune you
know where the trouble lay.
The use of a reasonable amount of
common sense combined with a thor
ough knowledge of what student gov
ernment is will be a guarantee for
you against any such misfortunes at
Stanford. New students entering
Stanford in the fall have a big advant
age over Christmas freshmen in that
student government is thoroughly ex
plained at a general assembly held at
the first of the year for that purpose.
But you can get just the same infor
mation by seeking the proper sources.
The Student Adviser will be glad to
have a talk with the new men and ex
plain all the workings of student gov
ernment. That is oue of the things
for which he draws his pay, and he
will be glad to have you help him
earn it. He can give you the Manual
of Student Control, in which you will
find most of the important points writ
ten down. The Dean of Women and
the Secretary of the Y. W. C. A. can
help out the women in the same way
that the Student Adviser can aid the
men.
