# Grand Opera in San Jose, Friday.
## 
### 
Real grand opera does not often
come to any but the largest of cities.
Theater-goers of San Jose and the vi
cinity will have the opportunity to
morrow night only, of hearing some
excellent voices in the well known
opera, "Carmen." The La Seala Grand
Opera company, with Alice Gentle,
lately featured by the San Francisco
Bulletin in the Christmas song recital,
will appear at the Victory theater.
