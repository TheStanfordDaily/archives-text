# TRACK MEN DON SPIKES FOR THE INITIAL WORKOUTS
## 1916 PROSPECTS ARE BRIGHT Record Squad Expected to Answer Call of Captain Ric Templeton 
### 
With attention of campus fans as
well as the outside public centered on
spring sports, and with the time ripe
for team building, cinder path knights
of the Cardinal hue are flocking to
training quarters to open the 1916
season.
To date there are some thirty run
ners, jumpers, hurdlers and hurlers of
experience lined up to make the back
bone of the squad for the coming sea
son. In addition to the veterans, a
goodly number of promising new can
didates have been mentioned or have
mentioned themselves.
Hope Favors Stanford.
Sporting writers of the coast are
giving the Stanford squad a sendoff
by stating in their columns that the
local team will resplendant in strength
and will be more than a match for all
coast rivals, including California.
Campus authorities, who probably
know the situation better, are not so
generous in their prophecies.
Certain it is .though, that the farm
track squad will equal that of
most former years, if dope can be
relied upon. Among the big leaguers
who will lead the team are Ric Tem
pleton, Feg Murray, Johnny Norton,
Bill Sisson, Skin Wilson and Reg
Caughey. A strong gathering of best
bet point winners can be relied upon
to join in the race for points at each
meet. This gathering includes such
men as Grant, Aupperle, Kirksey,
Heal, Lynn, Krohn, Dykes, Bihlman,
Chapman, and King.
\eo<l New 31 en.
There arc 1 daces for new men on
the squad. This point will be em
phasized at the rally, next Tuesday
evening, at the Union, when speed ar
tists of renown will tell how Stanford
will win in the future, as they have !
won in the past, provided Stanford
men go out for athletics to compete
rather than to root.
Weefs for This Season.
Meets for this season are now being
arranged by Graduate Manager E. C. I
Melirens. Attractions for the Stan
ford track athlete are stronger than
ever before this year, by reason of the
choice collection of meets which are
now being arranged by Graduate
Manager Behrens. In addition to the
usual neighborhood meets in which
Stanford men have participated, it is
probable that Cardinal runners and
strong men will partake in several
excursions for the purpose of placing
the Stanford stamp on meets else
where, as well as in the state. Pro
vided everything is agreeable with the
eastern authorities in charge, it is
probable that one unusual trip to the
far east will be slated as the treat in
store for men who stick by the squad
until the post season contests are
open.
