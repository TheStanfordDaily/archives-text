# TRACK MEN DON SPIKES FOR THE INITIAL WORKOUTS
## 1916 PROSPECTS ARE BRIGHT Record Squad Expected to Answer Call of Captain Ric Templeton 
### 
With attention of campus fans as
well as the outside public centered on
spring sports, and with the time ripe
for team building, cinder path knights
of the Cardinal hue are flocking to
training quarters to open the 1916
season.
To date there are some thirty run
ners, jumpers, hurdlers and hurlers of
experience lined up to make the back
bone of the squad for the coming sea
son. In addition to the veterans, a
goodly number of promising new can
didates have been mentioned or have
mentioned themselves.
Hope Favors Stanford.
Sporting writers of the coast are
giving the Stanford squad a sendoff
by stating in their columns that the
local team will resplendant in strength
and will be more than a match for all
coast rivals, including California.
Campus authorities, who probably
know the situation better, are not so
generous in their prophecies.
Certain it is .though, that the farm
track squad will equal that of
most former years, if dope can be
relied upon. Among the big leaguers
who will lead the team are Ric Tem
pleton, Feg Murray, Johnny Norton,
Bill Sisson, Skin Wilson and Reg
Caughey. A strong gathering of best
bet point winners can be relied upon
