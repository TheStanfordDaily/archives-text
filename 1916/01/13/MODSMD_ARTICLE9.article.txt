In Honor of Professor Ryan.
The telephonic connections with
New York are to be arranged through
the courtesy of the Transcontinentat.l
Telephone company, which company
originally planned to hold the affair
in the honor of Professor Ryan, in
recognition of his work in the ad
vancement. of electrical science. When
the. proposal was made to Professor
Ryan, he at once desired to make the
undertaking a university affair, rather
than a private one, as had been
planned by the telephone people, and
if is consequently, through his cor
tesv, that the installation ceremonies
will in this way he directly carried
to the New York alumni. Professor
Ryan has tried to minimize his part
in this feature of the program, but
the telephone company consented to
turn the affair over to the University
only on tlie understanding that it be
recognized as an honor to the head
of Stanford's Electrical Engineering
department.
The transcontinental conversation
will be held at "> o'clock, Pacific time,
which will be S o'clock New York
time, a suitable hour for the banquet.
Those who will be allowed to "listen
in" on the Stanford end of the line
will soon be designated. Student
Itody President Wilson and Graduate
Manager Pehrens will select the stud
ents who will have this honor. Other
organization heads will choose the re
mainder of the "fortunate one hund
red."
