Yells and speeches will be the menu
of the evening next Tuesday, when the
men of Stanford gatlnr for the an
nual spring-sports rally and pep ex
change. The exact time and meeting
place has not been decidfyi definitely,
as Yell Leader Johnny Goodman is
not sure that the Union will be large
enough to accommodate the crowd ex
pected at the rally. Encina Hall may
be called upon to furnish standing
room.
Student Body President P..R. Wil
son is negotiating with a number of
alumni of San Francisco, some of the
old guard, who are expected to con
vince Cardinal athletes, vets and new
comers. that Stanford teams will win
in the future just as they have in the
past, when the same old guard were
here.
Captains "Chick" Orme of the crew,
"Babe" Dent of the baseball nine, and
"Ric" Templeton of the track squad
will vie with each other in attracting
athletes to their respective folds,
with tales of former years, humor,
wit, and â€”in fact, just oratory in gen
eral.
in view of iho favorable turn
which athletic prospects have taken,
it is expected that an unusual number
of aspirtants to Stanford teams will
be in evidence.
However, the primary object of the
meeting is to hold a real Stanford
get-together, with real Stanford pep
bubbling out of everyone, to take
stock of the chances that Cardinal
athletes have during the coming sea
son. For that reason Yell Leader
Johnny Goodman, who will be master
of ceremonies from start to finish, has
lined up men who know how to speak.
