# MEETING OF AGREEMENT COMMITTEES IS POSTPONED
## Representatives of Stanford and California Will Confer Monday 
### 
Due to the inability of two mem
bers of the California Intercollegiate
Agreement to be present at the meet
ing scheduled for tonight, the concil
iation council has been postponed un
til Monday evening. At this time rep
resentatives of the two universities
will gather at the Palace Hotel, in
San Francisco, to consider the rec
ommendations made in the report of
the San Francisco Alumni Committee.
Stanford's representatives will be
George Presley, '07; R. W. Barrett,
'04; W. H. B. Fowler, '05; E. C. Beli
rens, '14, and P. R. Wilson, '16, while
California will send Farnum Griffiths,
Charles Street, Professor M. C. Lynch
and J. C. Hotehkiss. The time set for
the meeting is 6:30 p.m.
Prospects are bright for an under
standing between the two universities,
according to Street. With the fresh
man question out of the way, there is
little doubt but what an agreement
can he reached when the committees
get together.
