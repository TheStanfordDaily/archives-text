# DR. WHITAKER HEARD ON MISEMPLOYMENT
## Problem of Misemployment Is More Important Than Problem of Unemployment 
### 
In an address on "The Menace of
the Misemployed," before the Sociol
ogy Club, last evening, the Rev. Rob
ert Whitaker of Los Gatos voiced a
strong plea for co-operative methods
in business and industry, and empha
sized in his indictment of the com
petitive system, the enormous waste
of labor involved in the problem of
misemployment.
"This question," stated the speaker,
"is even more important than that of
unemployment, for owing to the lack
of organization and coherency in the
present system, 60 per cent of the
employed are engaged in unproduc
tive labor —they are duplicating each
other's work and are working inef
fectively." The speaker included the
professions in his classification of mis
employed, stating that the enormous
superfluity of professionally trained
men resulted in a large class of un
productive laborers, or parasites.
The speaker favored as the solu
tion of this condition, the diffusion of
labor, under which everyone would
do a certain amount of productive, or
manual labor. Re ended his speech
with a plea for the placing of the
mantle of responsibility on the right
shoulders —those of the educated,
non-productive class.
A most interesting and lively infor
mal discussion followed upon the lec
ture, and several of Mr. Whitaker's
arguments were challenged by Dr.
Gardner, the chairman of the meet
in';-, and by various members of the
club.
A business meeting was called im
mediately after the lecture, and the
president announced that the speaker
for the next month will be Professor
Adams of the History department.
