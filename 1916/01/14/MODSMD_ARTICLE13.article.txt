# DR. FITCH ARRIVES TOMORROW
## Comes as Special Preacher and University Lecturer 
### 
Arriving at the Palo Alto depot on
the 4:55 train tomorrow morning, Dr.
Albert Parker Fitch, president of the
Andover Theological Seminary, will
come to Stanford to act as special
preacher in the Memorial Church and
lecturer to the University.
Dr. Fitch will make his first public
appearance on the campus Sunday
morning, when he will preach at the
Memorial Church at 11 o'clock. Mus
ical numbers for this service will be
an anthem by the choir, Himmel's "In
cline Thine Ear," in which Miss Es
ther Liversidge, '17, will be the solo
ist; and a soprano solo, "Be of Good
Comfort," by Miss Edith Harvey, '17.
Is a Forceful, National Speaker.
Dr. Fitch's method is not one of dry
theological discussion, nor does it on
the other hand, endeavor to stir up
emotion alone. He does not believe in
making his hearers appreciate relig
ion as "a good thing," unless they
connect up that feeling with action.
In his addresses he will speak to
the men and women of Stanford as a
college man talking to other college
people with twentieth-century Ideals.
As a speaker, he is forceful, direct,
personal, and presents a striking ap
peal to university men and women.
A public reception will be tendered
Dr. Fitch in the Union, Sunday after
noon. from 3 to 6 o'clock. At this
I time opportunity will be offered for

men and women of the University to
become personally acquainted with
the visitor. President and Mrs. Hay
Lyman Wilbur, and Dr. and Mrs. D.
Charles Gardner will be present at
this reception.
First Talk Monday Night.
On Monday evening Dr. Fitch will
deliver his iirst address to the men
and women of the University, when
he speaks 011 the important subject,
"What Religion Can Do for Men and
Women," in the Memorial Church.
This lecture will begin at 8 o'clock,
in order not to interfere with the
chapter meetings of the fraternity
houses, representatives of which met
with Chaplain Gardner last evening
to arrange for the effective advertis
ing of the Fitch meetings 011 the Row.
It is especially important that there
be a large attendance at this initial
talk, as the three lectures form a
series, and lack greatest effect if the
first is missed.
Tuesday and Wednesday evenings
the meetings will begin at 7:30. "The
Exceeding Difficulties of Belief" is
the subject of the Tuesday night ad
dress. The subject of the final talk
will be "Religion in Action."
Members of the Y. W. C. A. will as
semble in the Women's Clubhouse at
4:30, Tuesday afternoon, to hear Dr.
Fitch deliver a speech to that organ
ization.
