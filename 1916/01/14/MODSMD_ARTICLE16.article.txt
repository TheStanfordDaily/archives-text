in the past, he composed of both Stan
ford and California players, was de
termined last night, when Coach Ma
j loney received word from Captain
| Shafor stating the desire of the Rerk
j eley players to participate in the
j series. Owing to the failure of the
California delegates to apear at the
recent meeting of the representatives
of the league, it was thought that the
entire team would he composed of
! Stanford men. However, this failure
was due to the illness of Captain
Shafor, and in a letter from him to
! Coach Maloney it was learned that
' the Rlue and Gold men were more
i than anxious to be in the league.
The Allies will play their first game
