Dr. Albert Parker Fitch comes to
Stanford with a reputation of having
impressed and held the interest of col
lege audiences. It is a reputation
backed up by the statements of college
men who have heard him, religious
and unreligious alike, and not one
built up by "press agent stuff." He
is a man who is worthy to follow
Sherwood Eddy in enlightening us on
religious questions.
Preparations for his visit to Stan
ford have been made by a group of
Stanford men and women who have
been working on those preparations
for many weeks with an assurance
that Dr. Fitch has something worth
while to tell the campus.
We welcome him to the campus
and pledge hearty support during his
stay here. Success from his lectures
will depend upon two things. The
first of these is that the University
people go to hear him. He would
eeem to be a good man to give a trial
by hearing his first talk. Every man
will have to judge for himself after
that regarding attendance at the
others.
The second qualification for suc
cess is that Dr. Fitch impress his
Stanford audiences as be has those at
other universities. He has the repu
tation of giving his Ideas clearly and
candidly, enlivened by bis virile per
sonality, with little of the emotion
which characterizes the revival ser
mon. If he does this at Stanford the
fulfillment of the second qualification
is guaranteed.
