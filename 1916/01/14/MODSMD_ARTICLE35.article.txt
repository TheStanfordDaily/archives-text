# STANFORD SONGSTERS LAUDED FOR MODEL CONDUCT
## Traveling Companions of Glee Club Write Praise to Secretary Clark 
### 
Judging from the reports that have
been arriving at the campus of late,
the Stanford Glee Club scored a
double hit during the Honolulu trip.
Not only has much praise been given
as to the manner in which the song
sters captured the immense audience
which gathered at the Royal Hawaiian
Opera House on the opening night, but
especially to the admirable conduct
of the club on the S. S. Great North
ern, while enroute to and from the
Islands.
At the instigation of Mr. Everts, a
Fresno lawyer who was a passenger
on the same boat, a letter was sent
to the University authorities, which
voiced the sentiments of the other pas
sengers and the captain of the steam
er, who had been commenting among
themselves as to the conduct of the
college party.
The following was received at the
president's office a few days ago:
On Board S. S. Great Northern,
Dec. 28th, 1915.
George A. Clark,
Secretary to President,
Stanford University, Cal.
Dear Sir :
We take the liberty of writiug
you in reference to the conduct
of your Stanford University Glee
Club boys. We have made the
round trip with these young men,
have been with them for the past
ten days—at Hilo, at Honolulu —
and under various circumstances,
and it is with more than pleasure
that we can say to you, sir, that
they have conducted themselves
as perfect gentlemen—no coarse
ness, no profanity, no drinking
marked their action. They are
young men that can lie trusted
any place. Their parents and
your University should be proud
of them. Those of us who are
Californians are proud of a Uni
versity that, can send forth such
clean, representative young men.
Knowing the deep interest, that
yourself and faculty take in their
young men, we believed that you
would l>e glad to hear of the ac
tions of these young gentlemen.
We remain,
Very respectfully,
(Signed)
Mrs. and Mrs. F. P. Newport,
Central Building, Los Angeles.

O. L. Everts, Fresno, Cal.
