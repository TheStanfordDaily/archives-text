# MASQUERS MEET BUT FAIL TO CHOOSE CAST
## 
### 
Masquers Society met today with
Coach Arthur Cyril of San Jose, for
the purpose of selecting the cast for
the three one-act plays which the
society will put on in Assembly Hall
on Friday evening, February 4. No
decision was reached at this time,
however, but the cast will probably
be chosen Monday. The plays which
Masquers Society will put on are by
well known modern dramatists.
"Rosalind" is by J. M. Barrie. The
other two plays, "The Interior" and
"Happiness" are by Maeterlinck and
J. Hartley Manners, respectively.
