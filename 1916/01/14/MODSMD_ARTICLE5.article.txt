# Faculty Axe Falls Hard
## 
### 
California fraternities are in many
cases suffering depletion of their
ranks, due to the number of students
who flunked out of college. In one
case the entire roll of freshmen mem
bers was unable to return. It is said
the number of students who flunked
last semester exceeds by 75 per cent
the record of previous semesters.
This is probably due to a great ex
tent to the attractions of the Expo
sition.
