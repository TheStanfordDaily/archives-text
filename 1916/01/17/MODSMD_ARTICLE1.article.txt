Seminary, deeply impressed a large
congregation in the Memorial Church
yesterday morning, when he made his
first public appearance at Stanford.
In the afternoon, Dr. and Mrs. Fitch
were guests of honor at a reception
in the Union, from 3 to 6 o'clock.
President and Mrs. Ray Lyman Wil
bur, Chancellor and Mrs. David Starr
Jordan, and Dr. and Mrs. D. Charles
Gardner were among those present at
the informal gathering.
Talks to Students Tonight.
Tonight Dr. Fitch will deliver his
first informal talk to the men and
women of the University, on the sub
ject, "What Religion Can Do for Edu
cated Men and Women." This meet
ing, which will be in the Memorial
Church, has been set for 8 o'clock, so
as not to interfere with the house
meetings of the fraternities and soror
ities.
Dr. Fitch will be introduced by
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, this
being the first appearance of Stan
ford's new executive on a University
platform since the assumption of his
new duties.
