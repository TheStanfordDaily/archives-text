Dr. Fitch displayed a forceful earnest
ness and sane rationality, which,
coupled with his splendid personality,
made his message effective. A portion
of his sermon follows:
"Character is the only infinitely
precious thing. No one attains char
acter who lets himself slip down the
incline of careless and self-indulgent
life, or who walks the smooth line of
the commonplace existence, conform
ing to the average standard of affairs
about him. But the man who gets
character turns his face to heaven
and climbs up the steep road to spir
itual self-control.
Strict Accountability to Soul.
"There isn't anything in the world
that can do away with the necessity
of personal struggle, personal holi
ness and personal consecration in

the strictest accountability to his own
soul.
"Always where you find men, there
you will find on their shoulders the
honorable chafing of a Cross; always
in their faces, the stern brightness of
the soldier's eye. Always where there
are men. they are men because they
were both aide and desirous to take
the cup of moral effort, and to drink
it, and to find in it a rapture which
makes any easier course dust and
ashes forever."

Preaches Forceful Sermon.
In his sermon yesterday morning,
Dr. Fitch displayed a forceful earnest
ness and sane rationality, which,
coupled with his splendid personality,
made his message effective. A portion
of his sermon follows:
"Character is the only infinitely
precious thing. No one attains char
acter who lets himself slip down the
incline of careless and self-indulgent
life, or who walks the smooth line of
the commonplace existence, conform
ing to the average standard of affairs
about him. But the man who gets
character turns his face to heaven
and climbs up the steep road to spir
itual self-control.
Strict Accountability to Soul.
"There isn't anything in the world
that can do away with the necessity
of personal struggle, personal holi
ness and personal consecration in
human life. There is no virtue in
any precept of philosophy or no view
of it which can release a man from
the strictest accountability to his own
soul.
"Always where you find men, there
you will find on their shoulders the
honorable chafing of a Cross; always
in their faces, the stern brightness of
the soldier's eye. Always where there
are men. they are men because they
were both aide and desirous to take
the cup of moral effort, and to drink
it, and to find in it a rapture which
makes any easier course dust and
ashes forever."
Condemning the practice of follow
ing the lines of least resistance in
life, and emphasizing the supreme im
portance of character bnilding by
moral effort, Dr. Albert Parker Fitch,
president of Andover Theological
Seminary, deeply impressed a large
congregation in the Memorial Church
yesterday morning, when he made his
first public appearance at Stanford.
In the afternoon, Dr. and Mrs. Fitch
were guests of honor at a reception
in the Union, from 3 to 6 o'clock.
President and Mrs. Ray Lyman Wil
bur, Chancellor and Mrs. David Starr
Jordan, and Dr. and Mrs. D. Charles
Gardner were among those present at
the informal gathering.
