# Committees Will Discuss Spring Sports Competition
## 
### 
Representatives of Stanford and
California will gather this evening at
the Palace Hotel in San Francisco for
the meeting which was to have been
held last Friday, but which was post
poned 011 account of the inability of
two California representatives to be
present at that time. It is expected
that the members of. the agreement
committee will come to some under
standing and that a compromise will
be reached which will make it pos
sible for the Cardinal and Blue and
Gold to compete in spring sports.
This will include track, baseball, crew,
basketball, tennis and soccer.
Practically the only difficulty which
stands in the way of spring competi
tion is the freshman rule, and, now
that Stanford has changed the policy
formerly adhered to in regard to first
year men, the prevailing opinion
seems to be that this rule will cause
little trouble. The reconciliation
with California will not necessarily
have any bearing on the situation with
regard to the Pacific Coast Confer
ence.
Stanford will be represented by R.
W. Barrett, '04; George Presley, '07;
W. H. B. Fowler, '06; E. C. Behrens,
'14, and P. R. Wilson, '16; while Cali
fornia's committee consists of Farnum
Griffiths, Charles Street, Professor M.
C. Lynch and .T. C. Hotchkiss.
