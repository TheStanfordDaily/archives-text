# STANFORD TEAMS NEED COACHES Spring Sports Bring Faculty-Student Issue to Climax
## TRAIN MEN; NOT TEAMS Professor A.T. Murray Faculty Committee Must Find Substitute For Discarded Coaching System 
### 
Stanford teams may have to enter
into spring sport competition minus
the usual finishing touches that come
through careful training at the hands
of skilled coaches, according to indi
cations now prevalent. The situation
is brought on by the edict of the fac
ulty that no more paid coaches be en
gaged by the Stanford student body.
The edict hits baseball and track
harder than other sports, as no trouble
is expected at rugby and crew head
quarters. The Faculty Athletic Com
mittee, of which Professor A. T. Mur
ray is now the head, and Graduate
Manager Behrens as well as the base
ball and track leaders of the Univer
sity. are now trying to find a way out
of the dilemna which spring sports
are now facing.
Faculty Ruling.
Some time ago the faculty passed
a ruling that no more professional
coaches were to be engaged, because
the coaching system at the time had
led to many unfavorable conditions in
the University. No substitute system
was provided by the faculty for pro
fessional coaches, and it has been left
to the Faculty Athletic Committee to
unearth a plan for training Stanford
athletes.
According to Professor Murray, the
Faculty Athletic Committee is on the
side of the student body, represented
by the graduate manager and team
captains who demand coaches for
teams, but is unable to permit paid
coaches owing to the faculty decision,
which the athletic committee is forced
Ideal System Outlined,
to carry out.
"The ideal system would be to have
the University engage an expert in
each line of sport, to be employed in
the gymnasium," says Professor Mur-
ray. "Athletics take the place of phy
sical training in the gymnasium, and
there is no reason why athletics
should not be taught by directors as
well as gymnasium work or swimming
by authority of the University.

"This cannot be done at once be
cause the trustees have never appro
priated funds to employ experts in
athletic training. Eventually, I be
lieve that such an ideal condition will
come about. At present we must find
a gradual way of working to it. It Is
possible that we may be able to find
work in connection with the gymnas
ium for coaches of spring sports to do.
"1 am not in favor of reverting back
to the old coaching system, by which
an expert is hired merely to turn out
a winning team. We must have some
one to train everyone interested in the
particular branch of sport in which
the expert is employed."
Committees .Meet.
A meeting of the Faculty Athletic
Committee with a student committee
composed of Graduate Manager Beh
rens, baseball Captain "Babe" Dent,
and track Captain "Ric" Templeton,
was held a few days ago at Professor
Murray's home. The general con
census of opinion at the meeting grad
ually resolved itself into the state
ment as expressed above by Professor
Murray.
Graduate Manager Behrens believes
that some method must be found to
provide for experts in the different
sports, which are not provided for,
as well as journalistic, forensic, dra
matic, and other activities of the Uni
versity, though more students partici
pate in them than in the above men
tioned lines of work.
"The issue ought to be brought
squarely before the Student Body,"
says Behrens. "Perhaps we can im
press the authorities with the import
ance of the situation, and secure some
provision for training the teams, and
placing them on an equal footing with
competitors."
It is thought that President Wilbur
will give the matter his attention as
soon as inauguration is over and he
has time to work out a solution of
the athletic coaching problem. In the
meantime, both the Faculty Athletic
Committee, Graduate Manager Beh
rens and Captains Dent and Temple
ton are trying to work out temporary
relief.

Committees .Meet.
A meeting of the Faculty Athletic
Committee with a student committee
composed of Graduate Manager Beh
rens, baseball Captain "Babe" Dent,
and track Captain "Ric" Templeton,
was held a few days ago at Professor
Murray's home. The general con
census of opinion at the meeting grad
ually resolved itself into the state
ment as expressed above by Professor
Murray.
Graduate Manager Behrens believes
that some method must be found to
provide for experts in the different
sports, which are not provided for,
as well as journalistic, forensic, dra
matic, and other activities of the Uni
versity, though more students partici
pate in them than in the above men
tioned lines of work.
"The issue ought to be brought
squarely before the Student Body,"
says Behrens. "Perhaps we can im
press the authorities with the import
ance of the situation, and secure some
provision for training the teams, and
placing them on an equal footing with
competitors."
It is thought that President Wilbur
will give the matter his attention as
soon as inauguration is over and he
has time to work out a solution of
the athletic coaching problem. In the
meantime, both the Faculty Athletic
Committee, Graduate Manager Beh
rens and Captains Dent and Temple
ton are trying to work out temporary
relief.
Stanford teams may have to enter
into spring sport competition minus
the usual finishing touches that come
through careful training at the hands
of skilled coaches, according to indi
cations now prevalent. The situation
is brought on by the edict of the fac
ulty that no more paid coaches be en
gaged by the Stanford student body.
The edict hits baseball and track
harder than other sports, as no trouble
is expected at rugby and crew head
quarters. The Faculty Athletic Com
mittee, of which Professor A. T. Mur
ray is now the head, and Graduate
Manager Behrens as well as the base
ball and track leaders of the Univer
sity. are now trying to find a way out
of the dilemna which spring sports
are now facing.
Faculty Ruling.
Some time ago the faculty passed
a ruling that no more professional
coaches were to be engaged, because
the coaching system at the time had
led to many unfavorable conditions in
the University. No substitute system
was provided by the faculty for pro
fessional coaches, and it has been left
to the Faculty Athletic Committee to
unearth a plan for training Stanford
athletes.
According to Professor Murray, the
Faculty Athletic Committee is on the
side of the student body, represented
by the graduate manager and team
captains who demand coaches for
teams, but is unable to permit paid
coaches owing to the faculty decision,
which the athletic committee is forced
Ideal System Outlined,
to carry out.
"The ideal system would be to have
the University engage an expert in
each line of sport, to be employed in
the gymnasium," says Professor Mur-
ray. "Athletics take the place of phy
sical training in the gymnasium, and
there is no reason why athletics
should not be taught by directors as
well as gymnasium work or swimming
by authority of the University.

"This cannot be done at once be
cause the trustees have never appro
priated funds to employ experts in
athletic training. Eventually, I be
lieve that such an ideal condition will
come about. At present we must find
