# Something Just as Bad?
## 
### 
Stanford can have no more coaches
paid by the Student Body! What is
the substitute? Coaching by profes
sionals has its defects, which have
been brought home to us poignantly
by the events of the past year. Hut
it also has strong advantages.
********
Trained teams cannot be turned out
without trained individuals to man
the fighting machines. Men have
trained at Stanford and have enjoyed
the season's sport under the pro
fessional coaching system.
********
Is there a substitute for training
men under the professional coaching
system with no disadvantages? We
are open to conviction on that point.
Individuals will not receive training
if the men employed as coaches either
by the Student Body or the gymnas
ium are not experts. That's a self
evident truth. The first requirement
for the success of the new system, if
it is to be put into practice, is, tlie'n,
the employment of expert coaches.
Trained men alone will not make
trained teams. And deplorable as the
fact may be, men will not turn out
for athletics in large numbers if the
only light ahead year after year dis
plays the specter of defeat. In that
case few individuals will be trained.
If the new system is successful,
the coaches will have to be experts
who can train teams and men.
********
And in the meantime there is no
provision for spring sports. Coaches
employed by the University to work
under the gymnasium authorities can
not be procured this year because of
the lack of funds. The available ma
terial for coaches is being rapidly
snapped up, and Stanford will be left
in a hole if some action is not taken
immediately to secure the right men.
We respectfully appeal to the Aca
demic Council and the Faculty Ath
letic Committee to reconsider their
action in banning student paid coaches
for this year, in the absence of a pro
vision for experts to take their
places.
