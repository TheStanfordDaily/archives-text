The scene is tlie Quail. Two sopho
mores coming in opposite directions
meet with surprised looks nil around.
Ist Soph.—Well, if it isn't Bill
Boogie! Thot you wore at Cali
fornia.
2nd Soph.—Was. Transferred.
Thought I'd like a change. How's the
boy? The old man still got the Pick
ard limousine?
Ist—Still got it. Sure glad to see
you here. You've got the hunch.
Come to a college.. We've got the
spirit. Where you off to?
2nd —Over to join the Union. Come
along.
1st —Sorry; can't do it. Don't be
long.
2nd —What! Don't you belong?
Say, if we had a joint like that over
at Cal. I might have stayed. Come
on and join with me.
Ist—Can't, Bill. Just subscribed to
a magazine, and I'm broke for that
sort of thing.
2nd —I'm almost gone, too. Just
signed for The Daily Palo Alto and
the Chaparral—getting two copies of
the funny book; one for the wife.
What'd you sign for?
Ist—Cosmopolitan. Some good stuff
in it.
2nd —Yes, some. And you won't
join the Union?
Ist—Wish I could afford it, Bill.
2nd —You're the boss. What you
doin' Friday night?
1st —Friday I'm going up to 'Frisco
for a little blow out. I sort of owe
a treat here and there. Count your
self in.
2nd —Thanks; sure thing. Won't
you change your mind about the
Union ?
Ist—Oh, I might, next semester,
when—when they
2nd—When they give free drinks
with each package of chewing gum,
1 suppose?
1st —You guessed it.
