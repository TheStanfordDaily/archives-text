# Last Call is Made for Quad Pictures
## Delinquents Are Given Another Chance to Appear in 1917 Annual 
### 
A last word of warning is being sent
out by H. L. Hews to those organiza
tions and societies which have failed
to have their pictures taken for the
Quad. Hews states that it is impera
tive for all organizations to have pic
tures taken immediately, for, in order
to comply with the engraving contract
it is necessary that they be in the
hands of the engraver not later than
February 1.
From present indications and the
many new features that the editor and
manager are introducing, this year's
book will eclipse both in general
make-up and in material all former
Junior annuals. The binding is of
rich red leather, stamped with gold,
and finished so as to match well with
the rest of the book.
In order that the pictures of the
juniors entering the second semester
may be included, several forms are
being held open and space may be re
served by communicating immediately
with the manager. There also remain
a few juniors who failed to have their
pictures taken last semester. As the
staff is endeavoring to make this
"everybody's Quad," they are especi
ally desirous that all members of the
1917 class be included. It has there
fore been decided to give those delin
quent ones until February 1 to have
pictures taken. This date, however,
is definitely set as the last that pic
tures can he accepted, both of indi
viduals and of the groups.
