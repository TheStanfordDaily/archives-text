# A 						Sad Case! Help Wanted!
## She Couldn't Figure It Out!

A sad case! Help! She needs it!
She was really quite a sensible look
ins girl. It's a shame that one so
young and fair should be so helpless.
Try as she would, she simply could
not find when and where her classes
were held. Some one whispered
something about a schedule being a
great help to the lost and forlorn.
She entered the Registrar's sanctum
and asked for a sched.
"You can get one at the Business
Office, 250."
The girl paled at the words. The
Registrar noticed that she seemed to
totter and grope at her surroundings,
as if about to faint away. In amaze
ment he stared.
"At the Business Office, 250." She
repeated the words slowly, as if their
full meaning was just dawning upon
her.
"At the Business Office, 250—two—
fifty! And I've only got 87 cents in
the bank. This is—awful!"
Before the Registrar could enlighten
her, she staggered from the office and
became lost in the maze of the Quad.
