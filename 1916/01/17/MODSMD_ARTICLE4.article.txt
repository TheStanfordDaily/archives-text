# Postpone Spring Sports Rally Until Thursday
## Fitch Meetings Necessitate Delay. Hooters and Athletes to Meet In Encina Club Room 
### 
Stanford men will be obliged to hold
up their pent in spring sports' pep
and noise for some seventy-two or
more hours, owing to the change made
by Student Pody leaders in the time
of the rally planned for tomorrow
night. The rally will be held Thurs
day evening in Encina Club room,
that no conflict will be made with
the Dr. Fitch meetings.
Originally it was planned to hold
the spring sports rally last Thursday,
which is the traditional jubilee night
for track, baseball, and crew argu
ments. Then, owing to the intercol
legiate agreement meeting between
Stanford and California committees,
slated for tonight, Student Body Pres
ident P. R. Wilson and Yell Leader
Johnny Goodman decided to postpone
the rally until after the agreement sit
uation had been solved.
The Fitch meetings were planned
during the last semester and are un
der the auspices of the University.
In order that every man in the Uni
versity might be able to attend both
meetings, it has been thought best to
hold the rally next Thursday, one
week later than usual. However, be
cause of the generosity of the gods of
rain, Captains Orme of the crew,
"Ric" Templeton of track, and "Babe"
Dent of the diamond, do not feel that
the delay will cause any material loss
of time in spring training.
Yell Leader Johnny Goodman prom
ises plenty of interesting speeches,
including the captains of the teams,
Crew Coach "Husky" Guerena, and
Professor A. T. Murray, head of the
Faculty Athletic Committee, who will
deliver his initial speech to the men
of the University since taking charge
of athletics.
After the usual limbering up of all
safety valves to Cardinal lungs and
Adam's apples, all men present who
wish to sign up for any of the spring
sports will be given opportunity to
do so.
