# WOMEN'S CLUB HOUSE HAVING CAMPAIGN FOR MEMBERS
## NEW PRESIDENT ELECTED Improvements Made Possible by Receipts From Numerous Alumnae Teas 
### 
Members of the Stanford Women's
Club House Association are now
carrying on a campaign to raise the
membership, and to give all those who
were not here on registration day a
chance to belong. Dues of $1.50 may
be paid to the house representatives
before Wednesday night, when the
campaign closes, and after that time
are payable to Miss Beth Wright, '09,
secretary and treasurer of the Club
House Association.
Mrs. F. H. Fowler, '07, has been
elected president of the Club House
Board, to fill the vacancy made by the
resignation of Mrs. J. P. Treat, '07.
Work is to begin at once on the side
walk leading to the main entrance of
the Club House. This has been made
possible by the Alumni teas of last
semester. It is the intention of the
alumni to continue these teas on Wed
nesday afternoons, and all undergrad
uates are urged to attend. An ad
mission of 15 cents will be charged.
