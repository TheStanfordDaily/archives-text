Here is the policy of the Faculty
Athletic Committee on the coach
issue, as outlined by Profesor A. T.
Murray, who has taken the place
of Dr. Frank Angel 1 as head of
the committee:
I—Athletes, rather than teams,
should be coached.
2—Experts should be employed
by the University to train athletes.
They would do the work of the
coach.
3 —Stanford teams will probably
be on this ideal basis soon.
4—Something must be done to
relieve the present situation, and
provide some one to coach Stan
ford athletes.
