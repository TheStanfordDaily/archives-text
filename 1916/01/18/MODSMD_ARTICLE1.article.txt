# LINK SCHOLARSHIP AND RELIGION ADVISES DR. FITCH
## Classifies Into Three Groups Students Who Fail to Unite Forces 
### 
Approximately five hundred men and
women were present in the Memorial
Church, last evening, to hear Dr. Al
bert Parker Fitch, president of Aiul
over Theological Seminary, speak on
"What Religion Can I)o for Educated
Men and Women." Dr. Fitch im
pressed his audience with his rational
clearness of thought, his vigorous
straightforwardness and his striking
personality.
He was introduced by the new presi
dent of the University, Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur, as "one of the foremost men
in religion in America." This was Dr.
Wilbur's first public speech since be
coming president.
Second Lecture Toniglit.
Tonight Dr. Fitch will deliver bis
second address to the men and women
of the University, in the old chapel,
room 100, at 7:30 o'clock, his subject
being, "The Exceeding Difficulties of
Belief."
Dr. Fitch will deliver the final lec
ture of the series tomorrow evening on
"Religion in Action."
That religion and scholarship de
pend on each other for their fullest
realization was the keynote of Dr.
Fitch's talk last evening. He pointed
out three divisions of university stud
ents who deprecate the union of piety
and learning.
"The first group," he said, "come
from homes where high ethical con
ditions are linked with obsolete
modes of religious expression, to col
lege, where they find a cool, cautious,
neutral, critical attitude, which when
analyzed, proves to be futile, coward
ly, irreligious, insincere. This group
condemns the sentimental, aesthetic
idea of religion only, without gaining
any clear-cut idea of it tp replace the
one discarded.
"The second group is an exasper
ating one," continued l)r. Fitcli. "It
is smaller here than in the east, and
consists of those chiefly interested
in the practical or beneficent aspect
of religion, and who want to do some
kind of actual work rather than pre
pare for the bigger things.
"We have religious leaders enough,
such as they are. What we
want is not more, but better, leaders.
We don't want near-scholars, pseudo
scholars, half-scholars, for leaders in
religion. We want men and women,
who, by serious, patient, constructive
scholarship have won the right to
take the lead in the greatest of human
interests.
"The third group thinks religion in
terferes with what they consider to
be the more important things in life.
This group includes the little, impos
sible prigs of college life. They de
spise religion, as incompatible with a
scholastic temperament. They are
cool, cautious, lucid, moderate, sane,
exasperating. They need to get wide,
inclusive human interests. The defect
and peril of the purely scholastic life
is the danger of becoming de-human
ized.
"With all of the increase in schol
astic learning, still the world is in
profound moral and spiritual degrada
tion. The mind of the race has out
stripped its soul. We have the ap
palling spectacle of man destroying
himself by the inventions of his own
intellect. At this very moment, on
the continent of Europe, this sinister
spectacle is presented. Man's own
mind is committing suicide on a tre
mendous scale.
"The world could not lie more mis
erable than it is tonight, were it not
that world could become more learned
and less religious. Religion needs no
apology and needs no defense. It
needs to be clearly and intelligently
expressed."
