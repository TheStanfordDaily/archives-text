# INAUGURATION TICKETS IN GREAT DEMAND BY ALUMNI
## Students to Hear President at Assembly Preceding the Official Ceremony 
### 
That a large number of Stanford
alumni will be on hand to witness the
inauguration of President Ray Lyman
Wilbur on Saturday, is evidenced by
the requests for tickets which are
coming to the Registrar's office by
each mail. The demand that the for
mer Stanford students are making for
admission has already proved the wis
dom of the restrictions which have
been placed on attendance at the cere
monies.
Because of the impossibility of ad
mitting all students to the Memorial
( liurch at the time of the installation
exercises, a special University assem
bly for students will be held in the
Assembly Hall at 11:15, Friday morn
ing, at which President Wilbur will
speak. Admittance to the assembly
will be by ticket only. Students may
obtain tickets at the Registrar's office
on Thursday, and on Friday morning.
Only tickets for IG9G persons, the seat
ing capacity of the hall, will be given
out.
Announcement of the distribution of
tickets for the inauguration was made
by the President's office today. Ad
mittance will be by ticket only. Mem
bers of the faculty, graduate students
and departmental assistants, may ob
tain tickets, one for each person, on
Wednesday and Thursday, at the Reg
istrar's office.
Seniors and .Juniors to the number
of five hundred may obtain tickets on
personal application and on presenta
tion of their registration cards at
the Registrar's office on Friday after
noon.
Alumni may obtain tickets on ap
plication to the Registrar before Fri
day noon. Members of the University
Chorus will be given tickets at their
rehearsal.
