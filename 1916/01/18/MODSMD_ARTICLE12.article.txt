# Peace Pact Brings Diamond Hopes
## Large Squad, Including Seven Veterans, Hampered by Weather Conditions 
### 
With a series of baseball sanies
with the University of California a
probability, instead of a bare possibil
ity, the number of diamond aspirants
out this season should be greatly in
creased. The prospects of a Cardinal
victory in a majority of the baseball
games are excellent. Six veterans of
intercollegiate contests, Captain Dent,
Hayes, Hoover, Stafford, Stevens and
Noonan, are back in college. Aside
from these men, there arc several
other promising candidates who will
report for regular Varsity berths.
There are some holes that need to be
filled, however, and Captain Pent is
anxious to have as many out as pos
sible.
Had weather has delayed the first
official workout, but regardless of
this, a number of men have been out
in suits nearly every-night. Plans
for the coming season will be dis
cussed in detail at the rally on Thurs
day night, and the schedule will be
made public in a few days. Until that
time, baseball enthusiasts must be
contented with light practices on the
Varsity diamond, when the weather
permits.
