# An Appreciation

### 
A year and eight days ago, on January
9, 1915, representatives of Stanford and
California, composing the Intercol
legiate Agreement Committee, met in
San Francisco for the first discussion
of the new compact which would gov
ern intercollegiate relations. After
nearly a year of purposeless wrang
ling at the two Universities and of
hard work on the part of the commit
tee members, and a few days of con
structive work with no wrangling, the
agreement is ready to be submitted
to the students of the two Univer
sities.
Stanford owes a debt of gratitude to
her members of the agreement com
mittee. They are big men, who have
done a big work for the University,
taking lots of knocks without grumb
ling in the meantime. They have con
tended for and secured the most that
could be obtained at every point of
the agreement game. For the most
part this fact has been appreciated
and undergraduates give the members
of the committee the great credit due
them for their work.
The Stanford Student Body owes it
to these men to back them up in the
agreement they have entered into.
That agreement has only been reached
by mutual concessions at both Univer
sities.
Members of the Alumni associations,
almost to a man, approved the terms
of the agreement before it was given
the stamp of approval by the agree
ment committee. Stanford's repre
sentatives were relying on the judg
ment of these other alumni as well
as their own when they agreed to the
compact, subject to the ratification of
the Associated Students.
Stanford students will be given an
opportunity to ratify the agreement
at the first possible opportunity for
an assembly, which will be in a few
days. Any disapproval of the com
mittee's action should be given care
ful consideration before it is allowed
to lead to action. If the disapproval
extends to only certain portions of the
agreement it would be well to con
sider the merits of the instrument as
a whole before condemning it.
