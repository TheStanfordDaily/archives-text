# Dr. Jordan Favors Contingency Clause
## Amendment to Preparedness Bills Would Be a Pledge Against Aggression 
### 
Chancellor Jordan today put him-!
self in accord with the movement that
has been started in New York and San
Francisco to have a contingency
clause attached to the appropriation
bills for "preparedness." This clause
would have unexpended balances
turned back into the treasury if
Europe should make peace with par
tial or total disarmament.
A riedire Against Vgirression.
"This would be a pledge against
aggession on our part," Dr. Jordan
stated, "and would increase our moral
influence in Europeâ€”impaired by the
movement towards an armament on j
the European scale, fitted for aggress
ion as well as for defense."
Outsider Stir I'p Mexico.
In regard to the present incessant
turmoil in Mexico, I)r. Jordan said
that it is the belief of many who are
well informed that the continuous rev
olutions have been in part stimu
lated by money from the outside. It
is also true, he said, that several men
who have extensive landholdings in
Mexico have tried to bring about mili
tary intervention, and ultimate annex
ation. Mexico has great potential re
sources, and these would be more val
uable if under our administration.
