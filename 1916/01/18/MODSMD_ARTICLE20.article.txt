Editor The Daily Palo Alto:
It is with awe and admiration that
one contemplates the methods of the
Hoard of Directors of the Stanford
Union. We are informed that only
members will be allowed to partake of
the festive bean when the new chop
house is completed. Being a member
of the exclusive organization, I would
like to know why the common herd
is allowed to wander at will thru our
barber shop and haberdashery? If
Frank Tagawa is going to invest 2,000
seeds for the edification of the elite
and is to be protected from the rabble,
why should not Charley and Otto also
be guarded? Is it because they did not
invest to the same extent, or are we
to assume that the slimser of hash is
a more desirable tenant than tho pur
veyor of socks and haircuts, and con
sequently to be zealously guarded? I
make my protest for the protection of
posterity. If outsiders are allowed in
one part of the building sooner or
later they will demand admission to
the rest of it. With the sanctity of
our bean hall violated, how can Stan
ford Aristocracy continue to hold its
present enviable position? Let the
Hoard of Directors continue the good
work. Why discriminate?
John Van der Swank.
