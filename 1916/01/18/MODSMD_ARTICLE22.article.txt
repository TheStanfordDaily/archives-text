Off campus visitors with good ears
Thursday night, won't need ear
trumpets to test their hearing. A
ronsing rally in Encina and a concert
in the Assembly Hall will produce a
medley if not melody. The conflict of
dates may cause a heart struggle for
some. Why not produce Gorgonzola
at the rally? According to press re
ports, he sure can yell.
From the looks of things in the
streets and around the Quad, the
! powers that be are installing some
new pipe courses. Hooray!
You can write home to your rheu
matic friend who feared to seek an
education for that reason, that this is
I
I the place for him. He can find cool
and soothing mud-baths in many se
cluded places. Or, if he prefers some
thing more modern, there's the swim
ming tank.
