# Urges Co-operation in Present Coach Problem
## Doctor Stolz Urges Co-operation in Present Situation 
### 
That the proper solution of the
coach problem will come through co
operation between students and fac
ulty in the selection of coaches, rather
than through a clash of the issues or
through edicts from the faculty, is
the opinion of Dr. Herbert R. Stolz,
director of Physical Training at En
cina gymnasium, and member of the
Faculty Athletic Committee.
I)r. Stolz believes that "there is no
occasion for distrust between faculty
and students and sums up his views
of the situation and problems in the
following statements:
"As a Stanford graduate who has
had some opportunity for observing
the trend of athletics here and at
other universities, I confess to a cer
tain pride in the high standards of
sportmanship and excellence which
Stanford athletes have mainained for
so many years. The place of athletics
in college life is assured, and it re
mains for us to make the most of
them.
"It is evident that outside competi
tion, especially intercollegiate compe
tion, is the strongest motive for that
â€¢general participation which is the
Stanford policy, and it seems to me,
therefore, that properly regulated out
side competition should be encour
aged, together with the less ambitious
activities which are confined to the
members of the University.
"In order to set real satisfaction
from any game or exercise it is es
sential that we do it well, and this is
peculiarly true in intercollegiate ath
letics, because the satisfaction is not
limited to the players but is shared
by all the members of the University
and by the alumni. It would seem em
inently fitting therefore, that instruc
tors should be employed to teach our
athletes skill.
"At the same time, since the ath
letic fields afford the best opportunity
for experience in self-government, the
choosing of teams and the handling of
teams should be wholly in the hands
of the players themselves. Is this not
the principle of our student govern
ment?
"On the other hand, the responsibil
ity of the University is such that it
must evolve and carry out a definite
policy in regard to so important a fac
tor in education as athletics have
proven to be. The University should
choose those who are to instruct in
athletics because these men will have
a very considerable influence upon all
whom they teach and should be care
fully selected for character and skill.
Moreover, those who instruct in ath
letics should be entirely independent
of the pressure to win games, and
this can scarcely be the case if the
instructor is responsible to an ever
changing student body.
"The Ideal arrangement, it seems to
me, will be a frank co-operation
among the alumni, the faculty, and the
undergraduates, the matter of general
policy to be determined by alumni and
the faculty, while the immediate initia
tive is the province of those who are
actually engaged in athletics."
