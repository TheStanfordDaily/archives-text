# English Club Will Present "The Second Mrs. Tanqueray"
## To Stage Play On Evening of March 3rdâ€”Arthur Cyril is Chosen Coach 
### 
"The Second Mrs. Tanqueray" will be
staged by the English Club as this
semester's dramatic offering by the
organization which gave us "Sher
wood" last spring. The date set for
the production is March 3rd, four
weeks after the Masquers' evening of
one-act plays. The play will be put
on in the Assembly Hall this spring,
as an outdoor production was the
order last year.
In choosing the Pinero drama of
which Paula Tanqueray is the center
of interest, the English Club is trying
an experiment. It is giving tho col
lege public a standard play of a na
ture practically untried in college
dramatics.
The question as to whether a woman
who has sinned can ever be happily
married is not a new one to drama.
It lias lieen answered in the affirma
tive by Mr. Davies in "Outcast," it
lias been evaded in more plays than
we could name, it has been answered
in a decided negative by Mr. Pinero
in"The Second Mrs. Tanqueray."
Arthur Cyril of San .lose will coach
the English Club play. Mr. Cyril has
also been named as coach of the Mas
quers' production, and will be remem
bered as the producer of the sopho
more comedy of last semester, "Hobby
Mtirnit." He should lie especially well
equipped to handle the difficulties of
rounding an amateur cast into shape
for such a big undertaking, as he has
played in"The Second Mrs. Tan
queray" on the professional stage.
The cast has not yet been definitely
chosen for the Pinero production, but
the play will offer unusual opportun
ity for good acting. The part of the
wayward lady who gives her name to
the play will be one of the most try
ing roles ever enacted on the Assem
bly Hall stage. It is not the only part
which will bring out real acting, how
ever. for the difficulties of the play
will call for an all-star cast. Tryouts
will soon be held in order that re
hearsals may begin early.
