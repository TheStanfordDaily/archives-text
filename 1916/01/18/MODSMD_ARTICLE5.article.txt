### 
Following practically every detail !
of the report from the San Francisco
alumni, the intercollegiate agreement
committees of Stanford and California 1
last night reached an understanding !
whereby the two universities will com
pete in spring sports. The only thing
which is now lacking to make the
conciliation complete is the ratifica
tion of the action by the two student
bodies. An assembly of the Stanford
students will be held at an early
date, and the proposition as it now
stands will be put up for discussion
and will be voted on.
Football Not Mentioned.
Nothing official was said about foot
ball at last night's meeting, and as
matters now stand Stanford will stick
to rugby and California to the Ameri
can game. Thus, if the students rati
fy the work of the Intercollegiate
Agreement. Committee, the Cardinal
will meet the Blue and Gold in track,
crew, baseball, tennis, basketball and
soccer.
Terms of Agreement.
The first article in the agreement
pact provides that no student in a de
partment or college not requiring reg
ular university entrance credit, shall
be allowed to compete in intercolle- I

giate athletics. This is expected to
exclude most of the students of the
affiliated colleges, as, unless they have
the same requirements as those de
manded by the regular academic de
partments, athletes from Hastings
Law School, the Medical, Dental and
Pharmacy departments will be ineli
gible. Davis Agricultural School also
comes under this rule.
Higher Scholarships.
No student shall be allowed to com
pete in any branch of intercollegiate
athletics who did not satisfactorily
complete two-thirds of the university
work for which he was registered dur
ing the preceding semester. The orig
inal registration filed at the end of
the semester will be used to ascertain
whether or not he has complied with
this condition. It is further provided
that the student must satisfactorily
complete at least ten hours work.
Freshmen Eliminated.
In return for these concessions
made by California, Stanford agrees to
eliminate freshmen from all intercol
legiate athletics.
The same rule was kept in regard
to the numbers of years for competi
tion: that is, a man may compete for
four fall and four spring semesters in
five years.
