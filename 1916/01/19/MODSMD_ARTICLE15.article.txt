The circumstances with which
necessity lias surrounded the stud
ents' part in the Installation of Presi
dent Wilbur are as outstanding as
anything which has been said or
printed to date as an argument in
favor of an outdoor theater. Five
hundred of nearly two thousand will
witness the installation of the new
president of the University. This fact
alone, unsupported by the flourishes
of oratory, shows the need of some
place at Stanford where the faculty
and students can all be seated, with
enough room left for alumni and uni
versity visitors.
The truth of the statement that un
certain weather conditions might
have prevented the use of an outdoor
theater for the Installation is 110 ar
gument against the need of such a
structure or against its usefulness if
constructed. There are at least ten
months in the year when weather
conditions can be counted on suffici
ently to plan 011 holding exercises out
of doors.
This is not a tirade against the ac
tions of any particular body. The
very best lias been done in the plan
ning of the Installation under the ex
isting possible places for the service.
Holding the Installation in the Mem
orial Church is highly preferable to
erecting a temporary structure for
the purpose—to providing a cheap
substitute for the structure reallv
needed.
But in the future Stanford will re
peatedly have occasions for the use
of an outdoor theater. The comfort
ing thought is that, this need will he
pressing itself forward so continually
that the structure will eventually be
erected. The sooner it is done, the
greater will be the good derived.
