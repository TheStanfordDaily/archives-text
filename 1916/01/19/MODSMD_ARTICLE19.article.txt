Editor The Daily Palo Alto:
The Hoard of Governors wish to
make the following statement of their
policy with regard to the restaurant
and many other enterprises in the
Union building.
The Union was intended by its
founders to he a gathering place for
Stanford men—alumni, faculty and
students—and to provide the facilities
usually found in similar clubs. Such
facilities include the reading room,
the pool and billiard tables, the to
bacco counter, the bed rooms and the
restaurant. To maintain these it has
been necessary to increase the income
in every possible way. There were
two rooms which could be used for a
haberdashery and barber shop, there
was a demand for such conveniences,
and the leases were made. These
conveniences have nothing to do with
the Union as a club, they are strictly
business affairs, and the leases were
adjusted on that basis.
The restaurant, however, is a part
of the club life of the Union. It
was left uncompleted when the build
ing was opened, for lack of funds, and
arrangements for a large investment
had to be made before it could be in
stalled. In order to assure low prices
the rental had to be very reasonable,
for it was realized that one of the
real needs of the student body was
good food, in pleasant surroundings,
at low cost. Finally an arrangement
was worked out by which the pro
prietor furnished most of the cost
of completing the building, and re
ceives in return several years credit
on bis rent account. The Union de
rives 110 direct profit whatever from
the restaurant, and must content it
self with the satisfaction of having
made it possible, and the hope that it
will be recompensed for its share of
the outlay by increased membership.
Under these conditions it is proper
that the advantages of the restaurant
should be restricted to the members
of the Union and their guests. The
whole plan and purpose of the Union,
as well as the necessary business ar
rangements, do not allow it to main
tain a public restaurant.
The Board of Governors
of the Union.
