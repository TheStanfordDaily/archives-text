# HARDER TO MISBELIEVE THAN BELIEVE, SAYS DR. FITCH
## MEETING IN CHURCH TONIGHT Chapel Proves Too Small For Crowd Desiring to Hear Religious Lectures 
### 
Owing to the limited capacity
ot" the chapel, I)r. Fitch will speak
in the Memorial Church tonight.

"Men go wrong in spite of college,
not because of it,"was one of the
initial statements by Dr. Albert Par
ker Fitch, in his second lecture to the
men and women of the University, last
evening, in the old chapel. He took
for his subject, "The Exceeding Dif
ficulties of Belief." Dr. John Maxson
Stillman, vice-president of the Uni
versity, introduced him.
Final Address Tonight.
Tonight Dr. Fitch will deliver the
final address of his series to the stud
ents of Stanford on "The Religious
Instinct and the Christian Experi
ence." Last night the chapel was
crowded to overflowing with Dr.
Fitch's hearers.
Unbelief More Difficult Than Belief.
Last evening Dr. Fitch said, in part:
"It is perfectly trufc that there is
not much Christian religion in the
world, but it is also true that what
there is of it is precious and beyond
comparison in value to the human
race.
