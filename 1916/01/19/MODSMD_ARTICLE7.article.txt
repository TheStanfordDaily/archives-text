# HARDER TO MISBELIEVE THAN BELIEVE, SAYS DR. FITCH
## MEETING IN CHURCH TONIGHT Chapel Proves Too Small For Crowd Desiring to Hear Religious Lectures 
### 
Owing to the limited capacity
ot" the chapel, I)r. Fitch will speak
in the Memorial Church tonight.

"Men go wrong in spite of college,
not because of it,"was one of the
initial statements by Dr. Albert Par
ker Fitch, in his second lecture to the
men and women of the University, last
evening, in the old chapel. He took
for his subject, "The Exceeding Dif
ficulties of Belief." Dr. John Maxson
Stillman, vice-president of the Uni
versity, introduced him.
Final Address Tonight.
Tonight Dr. Fitch will deliver the
final address of his series to the stud
ents of Stanford on "The Religious
Instinct and the Christian Experi
ence." Last night the chapel was
crowded to overflowing with Dr.
Fitch's hearers.
Unbelief More Difficult Than Belief.
Last evening Dr. Fitch said, in part:
"It is perfectly trufc that there is
not much Christian religion in the
world, but it is also true that what
there is of it is precious and beyond
comparison in value to the human
race.
"A benign and gracious will is be
hind this system. How can one be
lieve that a man who places honor
ahove money, virtue aliove fame, his
ideals above his life, is nothing but
a curious, mechanistic machine? The
difficulties of unbelief appear, candidly,
to be distinctly greater than those of
belief. One accepts one's views on
faith, whatever those views be. No
one can prove the world a truly me
chanistic thing. A few phenomena
support this hypothesis, but more ap
pear to indicate otherwise.
"Every man is a man of faith. All
of us have got to believe in some
thing. The testimony of the ages,
veritable and valid, the testimony of
expert souls, also veritable and valid,
and the imperious need of one's own
soul urge one to pledge one's life to
the sublime hypothesis.
Iteligion and Theology Differ.
"There is a distinction between re
ligion and theology. Religion is an
art, a way of life, an experience oi
sublime ethical values. Theology is
the scionce of that experience. -It is
only vital when progressive, and only
valuable when plastic. Just because
theological tenets are going out of
use, there is no reason why religion
should be abandoned.
"Never think for a moment when
the intellectual husk of religion falls
off, that religion itself has been de
stroyed. Still men need the sacri
fice of love; still they need the sub
duing and the elevating of the spirit;
still they need the light' and peace of
j moral victory; still men cry by the
j law of the universe to its Maker, and
I receive from Him strength to lace
I their battle and peace for their pain;
| still that spirit answers.
Lose Faith l*y Not I'sing 11.
"There are practical, ethical reasons
why men lose faith. They lose it.
by lack of exercise. Many men lose
their faith because they won't use
what faith they've got. They are vic
tims of their own mental and spirit
ual inertia.
"Some men use religious skepticism
as a cloak for moral obliquity. Such
men can find (!od only when they re
pent of their sin. Character is the
condition of one's spiritual insight.
There are men in this world in whose
lives there is the living God, and who
therefore know that he is. In their
own experience, they discover that He
can enable them in all times of sor
row. perplexity and distress to abide
in the abundance of His peace.
"I believe the time will come when
the world will be as full of the ac
knowledgement of the Lord as the
water covers the sea. Tn that univer
sal experience will be the one uni
versal proof."
