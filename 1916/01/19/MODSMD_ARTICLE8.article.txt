# Pop Kessler Will Dish Out Eats for Rival Journalists
## 
### 
When the roll is called Saturday
evening in "Pop" Kessler's, on Cali
fornia street, San Francisco, at the
first annual intercollegiate journal
istic banquet, it is expected that at
least a hundred representatives of the
student publications of Stanford and
the University of California will an
swer to their names.
The trans-bay college is sure of a
shipment of over sixty delegates.
Manager Fletcher of the "Pelican"
complains that he is finding difficulty
in keeping the number down, inas
much as every man who has heard of
the affair is trying to affiliate him
self with some college publication ono
way or another.
It is necessary that a fairly accur
ate approximation of the number that
will attend from Stanford he secured
within the next twenty-four hours. H.
It. Harvey, '16, manager of the "Chap
arral," wants to know just who will
he there, so he can get enough eats,
etc., etc., clever place-cards, and pro
grams to go around.
Male members of the staffs of The
Daily Palo Alto, Chaparral, Sequoia.
Quad, and campus representatives of
recognized newspapers—in short,
those of the Fourth Estate—are in
cluded in the aggregation who will
be welcomed around the festive hoard.
Kessler's, at 116 California street,
is the place, and 6::?0, Saturday, the
time. Seventy-five cents per plate will
be charged. Special rates can be
secured on the Southern Pacific by
clubbing together and procuring com
mutation books. "Hen" Harvey—P.
O. Box I.ls7—wants to know at once
if you are coming. Remember that
"Pop" can sure handle the big eats.
And 'tis said he can get away with
the funniest speech this side of Battle
Creek.
