# Frosh Speeds Hahn Pleads "Not Guilty"
## 
### 
Some people are born lucky; others
achieve luck, and others have good
fortune thrust upon them. V. D. Sum
merfield, '19, was born with luck,
achieved some not long ago, and the
other day had additional luck thrust
upon him in Judge Lakin's court, in
Palo Alto. Summerfteld was "pinched
fer speedin'" on University avenue.
He procured H. L. Hahn, '16, Varsity
tennis star, to defend him in the court
of law.
Hahn weighed the evidence and
found it wanting. In the first place,
the arresting "officer"was not a reg
ular officer at all; he said he saw the
defendant speeding by the light of the
moon. Hahn turned to his pocket
almanac and found that it rained on
the night of the arrest. Furthermore,
the arresting "officer" rode an Evin
rude motorcycle, carrying no speed
ometer, or tape-measure. Hahn in
vestigated the law and found that
"some mechanical means of measur
ing speed must, be provided.''
Again, the defendant was accused of
exceeding 30 m.p.h. Hahn noted that
the Evinrude couldn't do 30 even in
smooth waters. When Hahn told the
court all this at the trial, the other
day, the arresting "constalmle"
" 'llowed as how he could pretty nigh
calc'late speed," and said he had a fair
"idee" of just how fast the defendant
was moving. He didn't "need no
speedometer." The complaining "of
ficer" worked in a Palo Alto store,
and made the arrest because "Chief
Noble alwus done him a good turn
when he got a clianst."
"Not guilty," said Judge Lakin, '08.
Summerfteld, '19, sighed happily.
