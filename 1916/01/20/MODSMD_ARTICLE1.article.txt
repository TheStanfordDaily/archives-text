# FINAL FITCH MEETING IS RINGING CHRISTIAN APPEAL
## MANY HEAR LAST ADDRESS Noted Speaker to Keep Office Hours in the Vestry to Meet Students 
### 
Analyzing the aspirations that in
evitably result from man's inborn re
ligious instinct, and demonstrating
how they can be attained through
Christian experience, Dr. Albert Par
ker Fitch, head of Andover Theolog
ical Seminary, deeply moved his hear
ers last evening in the final address
of his series of lectures to the men
and women of the University.
So large an audience was present
that Dr. Fitch talked in the Memorial
Church instead of in the old chapel
room. Speaking from the subject,
'The Religious Instinct and the Christ
ian Experience," he said, in part:
Two Instinctive Aspirations.
"There is a two-fold aspiration aris
ing from one's inherent instinct. The
first part of this two-fold aspiration
is a result of the sense of the eternal
realities behind material manifesta
tions. Man has an ineradicable con
viction that the world seems to hold
before our mortal vision an obscuring
veil, behind which is that something
not ourselves which makes for right
eousness."
Dr. Fitch then traced the develop
ment of the Christian conception of
God during the ages, first as some
tliing dimly seen, then as a huge force,
and finally as expressed in the person
of Christ himself, who put moral and
spiritual beliefs into life.
Concludes Lecture Series.
The lecture last night concluded the
series to be given this w r eek by Dr.
