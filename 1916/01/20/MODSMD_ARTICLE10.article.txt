# Captain Dent Outlines Eight Reasons for the Paid Coaching System
## 
### 
Prospects of playing baseball this
season without an efficient paid coach
seems to have roused the ire of num
erous Stanford men interested in ath
letics, as well as the 191G baseball
captain, "Babe" Dent. The veteran
Cardinal backstop makes the follow
ing remarks in regard to the new pro
posed system and in defense of the
past way of handling diamond affairs
on the campus.
"I advocate the paid coach system,
such as Stanford has had in the past,
for the following reasons:
Must Have Coach.
"First, it is absolutely necessary to
have a competent instructor, especi
ally in baseball, to teach the many
men not only the rudiments of the
game, but the fine points. The man
who is capable of instructing these
fine points, cannot afford to do it with
out some adequate compensation.
"Second, the players themselves
look up to a man that is known by
reputation as being a competent coach
and as having had some excellent
baseball experience, lie is generally
an older man than the players them
selves, and they will have more con
fidence in him.
Conch Selects Impartially.
"Third, in picking the final lineup,
t lie coach takes a huge burden from
the captain's shoulders. The coach
is an outside man, with no feeling
of partiality whatsoever. While, in
reality, the captain would do as near
right, as possible, he is given a feeling
of relief if the task of selecting the
team is on an older and better judge
of ball players shoulders and not his
own.
"Fourth, the peanut league, with its
great number of men out, brings up
another problem. These men need an
experienced and well known man ovei
them more than the Varsity candi
dates. It is practically impossible foi
the captain to handle these men with
out excellent help.
"Fifth, a baseball coach, known tc
the students as a man who truly rep
resents the standards of the 'Nationa
pastime,' will stimulate interest in the
game and do much toward getting men
out, which is and should bo the Stan
ford policy.
"Sixth, one of the greatest reasons
for having a paid coach, in my mind
is the fact that we are again com
peting with the University of Cali
fornia, and they have a paid coach
of good ability. Without one wo
would be placed at a serious disad
vantage in our first Big Game sincc
the agreement.
"Seventh, it is not only possible, but
most probable, that Stanford can ob
tain a paid basoliall coach that does
not advocate winning the games at anv
cost.
"Eighth, in conclusion 1 would ask
those interested to look hack at for
mer Cardinal baseball coaches. They
have been paid instructors, and as the
men who worked under them will tes
tify, they were clean sports, working
for the best interests of the Stanford
teams."
