# New Storm Drain To Be Laid
## 
### 
Work will begin soon on laying the
new storm-drain down Lasuen street,
along the east side of the Quad. This
eighteen-inch drain will be in addi
tion to the small one already in place,
and is expected to care for the usual
over if ow of water at the Engineering
corner, which has caused much in
convenience in the past.
