## 
### 
Chancellor Jordan has been pro
moted. To his list of degrees an
other has been added—let's call it
I). C., which does not mean District
of Columbia, or Director of Con
cessions.
This morning, while Dr. Jordan
was traveling down the Quad, think
ing of bionomics, international con
ciliation, and Henry Ford, a woman
accosted him. The woman carried
a strange bundle, an unusually ani
mated bundle. From behind news
papers there kicked vigorously a
pair of legs—yellow, flesh-colored
legs—and, a wealth of beautiful
feathers!
Chancellor Jordan stopped, look
ed, and listened.
Pardon me," said the stranger,
"but I—I—"
"Speak on, good woman," said our
Chancellor.
"Pardon me," she repeated, "but
I—could you tell me what's the mat
ter with Oswald; he's sick?"
Oswald was a husky rooster. And
D. C. stands for Doctor of Chickens.
