# BENEFIT DANCES FOR CREW AND TRACK SANCTIONED
## CLIFF IRELAND GIVEN FOB Executive Committee Discusses Basketball as a Major Sport 
### 
Official sanction for two dances was
given by the Executive Committee at
its meeting last evening, one to be
given by crew ami one by track. The
dates for neither function have as yet
been definitely chosen, but as soon as
suitable times have been decided upon,
they will be announced. The crew
dance, however, will probably be given
on February 11. The proceeds of
these dances will go toward defraying
the expenses of the coming season.
Details as to the scene of festivities,
music and program have not been ar
ranged to date, but will no doubt be
decided in the near future.
Discuss Basketball sis .Major,
There was some discussion con
cerning making basketball a major
sport, but the matter was tabled, pend
ing the preparation of a report to be
made by supporters of the move at
the next meeting of the Executive
Committee. It was argued last night
in favor of the proposition, that bas
ketball is a major sport in all the
large universities 'the east except
several of the larger coast colleges.
At present there is considerable agita
tion along the same lines at California,
and it is very likely that basketball
will take rank with football, track,
crew and baseball at that institution.
