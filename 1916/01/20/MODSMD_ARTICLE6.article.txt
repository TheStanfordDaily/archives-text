# FANS RALLY TONIGHT IN ENCINA
## 
### 
If you are being rushed, Phi Beta
Kappa, tell 'em you've got a date for
tonight. Then forget your misery and
show up at Encina, with the regular
gents when they start the noise that
spells spring athletics for the farm.
He on hand with your noise-pro
ducer rubber-lined. Johnny Goodman
and his two young hopefuls will put
a double punch into every yell. En
cina roof won't stand the strain. The
only doubt as to its coming off will
be whether it is crew, baseball or
track that gives the final wrench to
the hinges that keep the red tiles
stuck onto the hall rain-shedder.

Captains Templeton, Ornie and Dent
will produce evidence in favor of thoir
regular spring occupations.
Seven-thirty will see the first ora
torical sky-rocket of the evening fire
works cleave the roof, and the follow
ing conflagration will more than take
the place of the freshman rugby bon
fire of the fall. The first year men
can take out the pep they spend on
building their November splurge in
just pure noise for the rally tonight.
All the strength every man has will
go into the yells, with care to leave
just enough energy to be able to push
a pencil across the paper when he
signs 111) for his favorite spring sport.
