# FRIENDLY CO-OPERATION ASSURED STUDENTS BY DR. MURRAY
## OPPOSED TO COACHING EVILS Faculty Not to Deprive Athletes of Expert Training, Says New Athletic Chairman 
### 
"You want to know how I feel in
athletics," was the abrupt opening re
mark of Professor A. T. Murray, head
of the Faculty Athletic Committee,
when he was introduced last night as
the first speaker of the spring sports'
rally program. "You want to know
what you're up against. Well, you're
not up against anything but cordial
friendliness."
Whereupon, Professor Murray went
straight to the point and explained
why he was against professional
coaches under the old system, but in
favor of expert training of Stanford
athletes, though lie had no solution of
the present problem to offer.
Favors Intercollegiate Contests.
"I am mightily in favor of intercol
legiate athletics. However, there are
some men in our faculty who do not
think intercollegiate athletics are
worth the candle. T do not think they
are in a majority, but there are Stan
ford faculty men who would vote for
abolition of intercollegiate athletics
now.
"Bonfire nonsense has done more
harm than good. The bonfire may
have made some pep but it also made
some people thing there's more non
sense to intercollegiate athletics than
there really is. We want a stimulus
in athletics to make men go out.
What is better than a rival you want
to beat; rivalry such as conies only
in intercollegiate contests?
Athletes Need Coaching.
"What do 1 think about the coach
business? 1 believe in sports for
everyone; not for just a few who are
going to he drilled into a team by a
hammering process by someone hired
to make them win. I am not op
posed to having Stanford teams
coached as well as their rivals, for I
believe that expert training is needed
in athletics as well as in anything
else.
"Put a coach hired by the student
body feels that his place is to win.
Stanford has had both good and bad
coaches in the last few years. In
view of the conditions as they are,
there isn't any likelihood that we'll
go back to the old system with its
evils.
Not Opposed to Expert Training.
"How are we to get expert train
ing? I am not opposed to expert
training, understand me. The gym~
nasium should engage a set of experts
to take charge of athletics. We
haven't money to do this now, and 1
don't know whether the trustees will
give it. I don't know what we are to
do, but I don't feel that we can sanc
tion employment of a professional
coach, and possibly cause the faculty
to set down its foot on all. It isn't
worth taking a chance now."
That the student body believes with
the Faculty Committee in principle in
standing for athletics as sport and
not as a team, was the opinion of
Captain "Ric" Templeton of the track,
who was second speaker.
Students Must Control, Says "ltie."
"However," continued Captain Tem
pleton, "There are certain activities in
the student body which are dictinct
ly student body activities. Some
activities must be under student con
trol. This is true of athletics, just as
it is true of The Daily Palo Alto, or
of dramatics.
"The plan is that the students shall
pay for the expert in the gymnasium,
but the faculty shall keep him under
their control. It might be all right,
but we don't want to lose our voice
in affairs.
"It would be O. K. to co-operate
with the faculty in choosing the
coach, but the plan of placing him en
tirely under the gymnasium would
make athletics revert to gym work,
not for the fun of it, but for the credit
it would bring. We can get men
whom we jointly think are best. The
right man would be O. K., but the
wrong man would have to get out.
(Jet Men Out For Sports' Sake.
"We want men to come out for the
sport in it, and to make track work
more interesting this year, we are
going to have some experts come back
to talk to the men on the field, both
new and old, and tell them how to
improve. It isn't signing up that
counts; it is coming out on the field."
Captain "Babe" Dent of the baseball
j nine gave the Faculty Athletic Com
mittee due credit for raising the
! standard of athletics at Stanford, but
! held that the only way to have suc
cessful athletics is to have them un
! der student control. "I feel that the
| only way is to have an outside coach.
| I hope either to have an outside coach
I or a suitable substitute." Captain
Dent called for new men as well as
veterans to join the ranks of the ball
| tossers this semester.

Stanford is the Cornell of the west,
in sofar as crew is concerned. Orme
promised to have a larger squad than

"You want to know how I feel in
athletics," was the abrupt opening re
mark of Professor A. T. Murray, head
of the Faculty Athletic Committee,
when he was introduced last night as
the first speaker of the spring sports'
rally program. "You want to know
what you're up against. Well, you're
not up against anything but cordial
friendliness."
Whereupon, Professor Murray went
straight to the point and explained
why he was against professional
coaches under the old system, but in
favor of expert training of Stanford
athletes, though lie had no solution of
the present problem to offer.
Favors Intercollegiate Contests.
"I am mightily in favor of intercol
legiate athletics. However, there are
some men in our faculty who do not
think intercollegiate athletics are
worth the candle. T do not think they
are in a majority, but there are Stan
ford faculty men who would vote for
abolition of intercollegiate athletics
now.
"Bonfire nonsense has done more
harm than good. The bonfire may
have made some pep but it also made
some people thing there's more non
sense to intercollegiate athletics than
there really is. We want a stimulus
in athletics to make men go out.
What is better than a rival you want
to beat; rivalry such as conies only
in intercollegiate contests?
Athletes Need Coaching.
"What do 1 think about the coach
business? 1 believe in sports for
everyone; not for just a few who are
going to he drilled into a team by a
hammering process by someone hired
to make them win. I am not op
posed to having Stanford teams
coached as well as their rivals, for I
believe that expert training is needed
in athletics as well as in anything
else.
"Put a coach hired by the student
body feels that his place is to win.
Stanford has had both good and bad
coaches in the last few years. In
view of the conditions as they are,
there isn't any likelihood that we'll
go back to the old system with its
evils.
Not Opposed to Expert Training.
"How are we to get expert train
ing? I am not opposed to expert
training, understand me. The gym~
nasium should engage a set of experts
to take charge of athletics. We
haven't money to do this now, and 1
don't know whether the trustees will
give it. I don't know what we are to
do, but I don't feel that we can sanc
tion employment of a professional
coach, and possibly cause the faculty
to set down its foot on all. It isn't
worth taking a chance now."
That the student body believes with
the Faculty Committee in principle in
standing for athletics as sport and
not as a team, was the opinion of
Captain "Ric" Templeton of the track,
who was second speaker.
Students Must Control, Says "ltie."
"However," continued Captain Tem
pleton, "There are certain activities in
the student body which are dictinct
ly student body activities. Some
activities must be under student con
trol. This is true of athletics, just as
it is true of The Daily Palo Alto, or
of dramatics.
"The plan is that the students shall
pay for the expert in the gymnasium,
but the faculty shall keep him under
their control. It might be all right,
but we don't want to lose our voice
in affairs.
"It would be O. K. to co-operate
with the faculty in choosing the
coach, but the plan of placing him en
tirely under the gymnasium would
make athletics revert to gym work,
not for the fun of it, but for the credit
it would bring. We can get men
whom we jointly think are best. The
right man would be O. K., but the
wrong man would have to get out.
(Jet Men Out For Sports' Sake.
"We want men to come out for the
sport in it, and to make track work
more interesting this year, we are
going to have some experts come back
to talk to the men on the field, both
new and old, and tell them how to
improve. It isn't signing up that
counts; it is coming out on the field."
Captain "Babe" Dent of the baseball
j nine gave the Faculty Athletic Com
mittee due credit for raising the
! standard of athletics at Stanford, but
! held that the only way to have suc
cessful athletics is to have them un
! der student control. "I feel that the
| only way is to have an outside coach.
| I hope either to have an outside coach
I or a suitable substitute." Captain
Dent called for new men as well as
veterans to join the ranks of the ball

Stanford is the Cornell of the west,

"Put a coach hired by the student

"You want to know how I feel in
athletics," was the abrupt opening re
mark of Professor A. T. Murray, head
of the Faculty Athletic Committee,
when he was introduced last night as
the first speaker of the spring sports'
rally program. "You want to know
what you're up against. Well, you're
not up against anything but cordial
friendliness."
Whereupon, Professor Murray went
straight to the point and explained
why he was against professional
coaches under the old system, but in
favor of expert training of Stanford
athletes, though lie had no solution of
the present problem to offer.
Favors Intercollegiate Contests.
"I am mightily in favor of intercol
legiate athletics. However, there are
some men in our faculty who do not
think intercollegiate athletics are
worth the candle. T do not think they
are in a majority, but there are Stan
ford faculty men who would vote for
abolition of intercollegiate athletics
now.
"Bonfire nonsense has done more
harm than good. The bonfire may
have made some pep but it also made
some people thing there's more non
sense to intercollegiate athletics than
there really is. We want a stimulus
in athletics to make men go out.
What is better than a rival you want
to beat; rivalry such as conies only
in intercollegiate contests?
Athletes Need Coaching.
"What do 1 think about the coach
business? 1 believe in sports for
everyone; not for just a few who are
going to he drilled into a team by a
hammering process by someone hired
to make them win. I am not op
posed to having Stanford teams
coached as well as their rivals, for I
believe that expert training is needed
in athletics as well as in anything
else.
"Put a coach hired by the student
body feels that his place is to win.
Stanford has had both good and bad
coaches in the last few years. In
view of the conditions as they are,
there isn't any likelihood that we'll
go back to the old system with its
evils.
Not Opposed to Expert Training.
"How are we to get expert train
ing? I am not opposed to expert
training, understand me. The gym~
nasium should engage a set of experts
to take charge of athletics. We
haven't money to do this now, and 1
don't know whether the trustees will
give it. I don't know what we are to
do, but I don't feel that we can sanc
tion employment of a professional
coach, and possibly cause the faculty
to set down its foot on all. It isn't
worth taking a chance now."
That the student body believes with
the Faculty Committee in principle in
standing for athletics as sport and
not as a team, was the opinion of
Captain "Ric" Templeton of the track,
who was second speaker.
Students Must Control, Says "ltie."
"However," continued Captain Tem
pleton, "There are certain activities in
the student body which are dictinct
ly student body activities. Some
activities must be under student con
trol. This is true of athletics, just as
it is true of The Daily Palo Alto, or
of dramatics.
"The plan is that the students shall
pay for the expert in the gymnasium,
but the faculty shall keep him under
their control. It might be all right,
but we don't want to lose our voice
in affairs.
"It would be O. K. to co-operate
with the faculty in choosing the
coach, but the plan of placing him en
tirely under the gymnasium would
make athletics revert to gym work,
not for the fun of it, but for the credit
it would bring. We can get men
whom we jointly think are best. The
right man would be O. K., but the
wrong man would have to get out.
(Jet Men Out For Sports' Sake.
"We want men to come out for the
sport in it, and to make track work
more interesting this year, we are
going to have some experts come back
to talk to the men on the field, both
new and old, and tell them how to
improve. It isn't signing up that
counts; it is coming out on the field."
Captain "Babe" Dent of the baseball
j nine gave the Faculty Athletic Com
mittee due credit for raising the
! standard of athletics at Stanford, but
! held that the only way to have suc
cessful athletics is to have them un
! der student control. "I feel that the
| only way is to have an outside coach.
| I hope either to have an outside coach
I or a suitable substitute." Captain
Dent called for new men as well as
veterans to join the ranks of the ball
