All arrangements arc complete for
tlio exchange of greeting by telephone
between members of Stanford Univer
sity and the New York Alumni,
which lias been made possible
through the courtesy of Mr. John .1.
Tarty, cbief engineer of the Ameri
can Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany. The accommodations have
been doubled by the expedient of giv
ing each person but one receiver.
This will not lessen the efficiency
of the service, and will make room
for two hundred instead of one hund
red people to listen over the wires.
The reception will take place at 5
o'clock, in the Union.
The list of students who will have
places on the telephones, follows:
Misses Hazel Fisher, '16, Margery
