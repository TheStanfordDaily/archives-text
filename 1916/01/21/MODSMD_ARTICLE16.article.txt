The first big pep revival of the year
came and went with last night's rally
—and there was plenty of pep pres
ent. But because it was successful
is no reason why it should be followed
by the usual sequel of a revival —
backsliding.
There was a sane note in the rally
last night in giving advice to the men
to sign up. No man was urged to
sign if his only purpose in doing so
was to lend his name to swell the list
of persons out for spring sports. Cap
tain Tompleton put the point con
cisely, when he urged all men to come
out on the track who intended to
fight it out to the end of the season.
Rut he urged nobody to come out and
crowd the track and field at the be
ginning of the season who was doing
it at the instigation of some body of
upperclassmen and who intended to
drop out at the earliest opportunity
that it could be done with the proper
finesse.
Now, if at any time, Stanford needs
the sixpport of men on the athletic
fields who are out to stick. Rut the
first of the season "hopes" who last
only for a short period will only
hinder progress. The man who is out
for the sport, and who has the intent
to do everything possible to help
strengthen spring athletics during the
whole season will find that plenty o£
use can be made of him by the men
in charge.
Stanford needs strong aggregation:;
this year in track, crow and baseball,
for there is a big future in sight for
each of these sports during the sea
son. Gogetem.
Seniors were conspicuous by their
absence from the front seats in the
Assembly Hall, this morning. Some
one stands as authority for the state
ment that speaking to wooden benches
will make any man a blockhead. II
it's true, we ask providential inter
vention for Stanford assembly speak
ers, for they seem to be doomed for
ever to look over a few rows of empty
seats in talking to the students.
The first rows were vacant this

morning and there were seniors
enough present, to fill tliein. If every
fourth year man on entering the As
sembly Hall take a seat in one of the
first rows, as a matter of course he
should, as a matter of custom, the
present embarassing situation created
for speakers would he removed.
