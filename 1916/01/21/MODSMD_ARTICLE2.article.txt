# Ballot Delayed on Athletic Agreement
## Executive Committee Postpones Assembly As Result of Dr. Wilbur's Request 
### 
Final details in the Stanford-Uni
versity of California agreement ques
tion will be settled, so far as Stan
ford is concerned, it is expected, on
Tuesday, February 1, when the ac
tion of the Stanford Executive Com
mittee and the Agreement Committee
is presented to the student body at
an assembly and is voted on by ballot
for ratification.
Student body leaders will outline
the steps which diplomacy with Cali
fornia took, and will explain the sit
uation which makes it seem expedient
as well as necessary to eliminate
freshmen from competition. The con
cessions on both sides will be ex
plained by Student Body President P.
It. Wilson.
It was planned to hold this meeting
next week and settle the matter at
the earliest, possible date. However,
Dr. Wilbur has requested that the
assembly and ballots be postponed un
til a more certain policy on the part
of the faculty has been settled upon,
and for that reason ratification of the
arts of the Agreement Committee and
the Executive Committee will be held
tip until then.
