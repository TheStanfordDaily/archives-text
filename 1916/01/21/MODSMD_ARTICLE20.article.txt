to allow us to remain on earth to wit
ness its inauguration. His tender lov
ing heart has seen fit to spare us to
take part with you this day. A great
sense of thankfulness pervades my
being that He willed it thus and '
deem it proper I should give public
testimony of my gratitude. Our hearts
go out to you in u peculiar manner. I
think that we both feel a personal and
individual interest in each one of you;
in fact, it seems to me that you have
become a part of our lives. Our hearts
have yearned for a work which might
rouse our interest in the life of the
young and in this field our hearts are
filled almost to overflowing with deep
est interest. While we are permitted
j to remain in this life we shall watch
closely your efforts to improve your
opportunities and closely follow the
j results when you go forth to battle
| with the world. I believe there are
loved ones beyond the life here who
are joining us today in our prayers for
the success of this institution. Four
of our trustees have been called to
Ihe world beyond this, but I feel sure
| they, too. continue to remember us
j and our needs.
Project Horn of Sorrow.
An impression has gone forth that
we were indifferent to religious in
fluences here, and to religious instruc
tion being given here. I am quite
sure that this impression would not
exist if all could be made to under
stand that this project was born of a
| great sorrow, the greatest that pai
ients can endure; that the Creator has
led us through the deep waters out
into the sunshine of faith and belief
in a future life; that we have wholly
and entirely given our lives to Him,
and only ask that He will guide us
to do His will; that every stone that
lias been laid in the building of this
University hut numbers the prayers
that have been offered up to our
Heavenly Father for strength, guid
ance and help. That we should forget
His love and mercy and be indifferent
,as to the Christian influence to be
J used among the students, would be an
J impossibility. We desire all of these 1
young men and women to pay due rev
j erence to the Creator, to remember
j His precepts and to obey His will;
j and so live that their deeds will tell
better than words their love for the
| Master There is only one failure
i for you and that is not to be true to
the best you know. Always lie gentle
j in manner, resolute in purpose, and
I you will develop characters on which
others can depend; and you can safe-
Ily dispense with the more brilliant
| qualities if you can be depended upon
J for truthfulness, honesty of purpose,
[ and each example of a good student
j will reach out and have an undyin?
j influence.
| Secret of Christian Growth.
One who has passed from earth
' life lias said, "Kind words and liberal
estimates and generous acknowledge
ments and ready appreciation, unsel
fish delight in the excellence of other ;,
these are the best signs of a large in
tellect and a noble spirit. To be true,
to be loving, is the secret of Christian
i growth." I hope each one of you will
hold up this ideal before you and then
you will go forth as missionaries into
the world. This is what we wish,
what we hope, and what we pray for.
