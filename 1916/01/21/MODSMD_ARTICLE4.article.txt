# BASEBALL TOMORROW
## Stanford to Meet Leaguers on Varsity Diamond 
### 
Baseball season opens tomorrow af
ternoon when the Cardinal squads
meets a team of semi-professional
ball tossers and ex-Coast Leaguers
under the leadership of Tommy Sliee
lian and Charlie Swain, both one-time
stars of the Sacramento Coasters.
The opposing team is in reality the
same set of diamond artists that have
appeared on the Stanford field for
the past few years, only at former
times they were led by Cliff Ireland.
The game will be called at 3 sharp,
taking place on the Varsity diamond,
which is in excellent condition, beins;
well packed down by the recent rains.
Season tickets or 2. r > cents will admit
spectators. The Stanford team has
not been chosen as yet, so Captain
Dent wishes all baseball candidates
to lie on hand. As underclassmen
will not be permitted at the Installa
tion exercises the baseball game
should draw a good crowd.
