# NEW PRESIDENT WINS STANFORD Dr. Wilbur Outlines Ideals of Founders in Talk
## 
### 
In a spirit of frank friendliness and j
genuine interest, President Wilbur j
met the students in assembly this
morning. A glimpse of Stanford as
it was in the early days, of the life
as it was when he came to the campus
as a student and of the first ideals of
the University, prefaced the new ex
ecutive's remarks concerning the fu
ture of his alma mater.
Among the early characteristics of
Stanford, the one which Dr. Wilbur
urged the present students most to
emulate was the spirit of contest
which prevailed. "The only way to
come to the top," he said, "is by
struggling. I therefore urge you to
get into college activities, for it is
greatly on account of them that you
will be remembered.
Iliizing Has >'o Place.
"The protection of Stanford's good
name is a traditional ideal in the
University," he continued. "And the
practice of hazing is entirely foreign
to that good name. It is a combina
tion of cowardice and bullyism, and
will have to go if student control is
to succeed. One advantage of an al
umnus president is that he is able to
feel genuine pride in the University's
achievements, but there is also the
disadvantage that he can see and de
plore its evils.
Limitation of Students.
"As to the future, it will be neces
sary to place a limit on the number
of students allowed to enter Stan
ford. With the ,>rt sent endowment
we cannot hope to expand extensively
and still do justice to our work. This
policy will not interfere with any ex
itsing student organizations, although
it is natural that the number of ad
isting student organizations, although
crease. The existing departments
will be developed to completion with
the present endowment. If it is pos
sible to secure additional endowment,

the University will develop along any ]
line that seems worth while.
"It is my hope that all students may
be able to live on the campus, anil
this will mean new dormitories. It is
a mistake for a person to classify
himself with any particular clique—
he should be one of the group. The
best in a college can only be secured
by mixing with the students as well
as in student activities.
Biggest Problem.
"My biggest problem, however, will
be to fill the gaps in the ranks of
the faculty, made by the retirement
of the men who have been with the
University for years. If I can suc
ceed in filling them well, the future
of Stanford will be assured.
"One's experience here in Stanford
should be such that he will learn to
be a good citizen of the United States.
He should be ready and willing to do
active servie for the country in which
he lives."
Mrs. Stanford's Letter.
in conclusion, President Wilbur
read an address which Mrs. Stanford
prepared to deliver at the occasion of
Chancellor Jordan's installation, but
which she did not give. It was found
among some letters which she had
marked not to lie opened until after
her death. The letter follows:
My husband has expressed the wish
that I would address a few words to
the student body. Perhaps it is be
fitting that 1 should do so, for since
the first conception of this work Mr.
Stanford and myself have been in uni
son and we have not only conferred
together earnestly and deeply, but we
have made this work a subject of deep
and earnest prayer. We fully realize
our own weakness and our inability
to accomplish anything by ourselves.
We are not deserving of praise for
what we have done; we are merely
following out a great plan that was
conceived by one far greater than our
selves, our Heavenly Father, and we
are but lowly instruments in his lov
ing hands.
Ite True To Best.
Our hearts have been more deeply
interested in this work than you can
| conceive. It was born in sorrow biic
lias now become a great joy to om 1
hearts. While Mr. Stanford lias di
lated ou book education 1 desire to
impress upon the minds of each one of
these students, both male and female,
that we have at heart and very closely
the hope that you will each strive to
place before yourselves a high moral
standard; that you will resolve to go
forth from these class rooms determ
ined in the future to lie leaders with
high aims and pure standards; and
live such lives tiiat it will lie said of
you that you are true to the best you
know. I hope your lives will be truly
earnest, not in the sense of going
forth to acquire great wealth and
great names; but to be conscientious
I workers, to be helpful to others, to
I
| send cheer and goodwill to those who
| need lifting up, and to always follow
i the Golden Rule, "to do unto others as
I you would have others do unto you."
j Necessity of Patience.
For a while you will be obliged to
practice great patience. You have
gathered together from different parts
of the United States, strangers to eacn
other, and everything is at present 1111- !
organized. It will take you some time
to accustom yourselves to your new
surroundings, and to the different ele
ments you will come in contact with;
consequently we are desirous that you
should lie tolerant until all of the
machinery is in good working order.
I am also anxious that these young
men should treat the young ladies who
have entered this institution with the
greatest deference; that they will be
in their ambition for a thorough edu
cation. We have started you both
helpful in aiding and cheering them
on the same equality and we hope for
the best results.
Tribute to Labor.
Many of the young men who have
entered this institution have come not
only to improve their mental faculties,
but to teach their hands to lie skilled
in manual labor and for these young
men my heart goes out with great
sympathy and hope; for many will
have nothing but the work of their
hands to sustain them in the future.
We are anxious that they should have
all the advantages possible. I feel
tiiat the laborers of our country have
not that encouragement and cheer
they should receive from those who
have had superior advantages and
larger means. Skilled laborers should
be held in higher esteem and given
more respect and consideration. 1
have in my mind the engineers who
carry our great railroads across the
continent and our great leviathans
across the oceans; they stand at the
helm faithfully through darkness and
storms, and hold our lives, its it were,
in their hands. To their watchfulness
and faitfulness we certainly have to
trust ourselves. They as a class are
our most self-sacrificing, heroic and
daring men. I never cross the con
tinent or the ocean without asking
blessings and reward to be bestowed
. upon them from the Highest Source
for their faithful service to mankind.
Day Sacred to Founders.
Perhaps it will not be improper for
Ime to say to these young men and
j women who have gathered here as
students that this day is held by us us
one of the most sacred of our lives.
We thought it a sacred day when we
laid the cornerstone of this institution,
and how often we have wondered ii
it would be our Heavenly Father's will

the first conception of this work Mr.
Stanford and myself have been in uni
son and we have not only conferred
together earnestly and deeply, but we
have made this work a subject of deep
and earnest prayer. We fully realize
our own weakness and our inability
to accomplish anything by ourselves.
We are not deserving of praise for
what we have done; we are merely
following out a great plan that was
conceived by one far greater than our
selves, our Heavenly Father, and we
are but lowly instruments in his lov
ing hands.
Ite True To Best.
Our hearts have been more deeply
interested in this work than you can
| conceive. It was born in sorrow biic
lias now become a great joy to om 1
hearts. While Mr. Stanford lias di
lated ou book education 1 desire to
impress upon the minds of each one of
these students, both male and female,
that we have at heart and very closely
the hope that you will each strive to
place before yourselves a high moral
standard; that you will resolve to go
forth from these class rooms determ
ined in the future to lie leaders with
high aims and pure standards; and
live such lives tiiat it will lie said of
you that you are true to the best you
know. I hope your lives will be truly
earnest, not in the sense of going
forth to acquire great wealth and
great names; but to be conscientious
I workers, to be helpful to others, to
I
| send cheer and goodwill to those who
| need lifting up, and to always follow
i the Golden Rule, "to do unto others as
I you would have others do unto you."
j Necessity of Patience.
For a while you will be obliged to
practice great patience. You have
gathered together from different parts
of the United States, strangers to eacn
other, and everything is at present 1111- !
organized. It will take you some time
to accustom yourselves to your new
surroundings, and to the different ele
ments you will come in contact with;
consequently we are desirous that you
should lie tolerant until all of the
machinery is in good working order.
I am also anxious that these young
men should treat the young ladies who
have entered this institution with the
greatest deference; that they will be
in their ambition for a thorough edu
cation. We have started you both
helpful in aiding and cheering them
on the same equality and we hope for
the best results.
Tribute to Labor.
Many of the young men who have
entered this institution have come not
only to improve their mental faculties,
but to teach their hands to lie skilled
in manual labor and for these young
men my heart goes out with great
sympathy and hope; for many will
have nothing but the work of their
hands to sustain them in the future.
We are anxious that they should have
all the advantages possible. I feel
tiiat the laborers of our country have
not that encouragement and cheer
they should receive from those who
have had superior advantages and
larger means. Skilled laborers should
be held in higher esteem and given
more respect and consideration. 1
have in my mind the engineers who
carry our great railroads across the
continent and our great leviathans
across the oceans; they stand at the
helm faithfully through darkness and
storms, and hold our lives, its it were,
in their hands. To their watchfulness
and faitfulness we certainly have to
trust ourselves. They as a class are
our most self-sacrificing, heroic and
daring men. I never cross the con
tinent or the ocean without asking
blessings and reward to be bestowed
. upon them from the Highest Source
for their faithful service to mankind.
Day Sacred to Founders.
Perhaps it will not be improper for
Ime to say to these young men and
j women who have gathered here as
students that this day is held by us us
one of the most sacred of our lives.
We thought it a sacred day when we
laid the cornerstone of this institution,
and how often we have wondered ii
it would be our Heavenly Father's will
(Continued on pace three)
In a spirit of frank friendliness and j
genuine interest, President Wilbur j
met the students in assembly this
morning. A glimpse of Stanford as
it was in the early days, of the life
as it was when he came to the campus
as a student and of the first ideals of
the University, prefaced the new ex
ecutive's remarks concerning the fu
ture of his alma mater.
Among the early characteristics of
Stanford, the one which Dr. Wilbur
urged the present students most to
emulate was the spirit of contest
which prevailed. "The only way to
come to the top," he said, "is by
struggling. I therefore urge you to
get into college activities, for it is
greatly on account of them that you
will be remembered.
Iliizing Has >'o Place.
"The protection of Stanford's good
name is a traditional ideal in the
University," he continued. "And the
practice of hazing is entirely foreign
to that good name. It is a combina
tion of cowardice and bullyism, and
will have to go if student control is
to succeed. One advantage of an al
umnus president is that he is able to
feel genuine pride in the University's
achievements, but there is also the
disadvantage that he can see and de
plore its evils.
Limitation of Students.
"As to the future, it will be neces
sary to place a limit on the number
of students allowed to enter Stan
ford. With the ,>rt sent endowment
we cannot hope to expand extensively
and still do justice to our work. This
policy will not interfere with any ex
itsing student organizations, although
it is natural that the number of ad
isting student organizations, although
crease. The existing departments
will be developed to completion with
the present endowment. If it is pos
sible to secure additional endowment,

the University will develop along any ]
line that seems worth while.
"It is my hope that all students may
be able to live on the campus, anil
this will mean new dormitories. It is
a mistake for a person to classify
himself with any particular clique—
he should be one of the group. The
best in a college can only be secured
by mixing with the students as well
as in student activities.
Biggest Problem.
"My biggest problem, however, will
be to fill the gaps in the ranks of
the faculty, made by the retirement
of the men who have been with the
University for years. If I can suc
ceed in filling them well, the future
of Stanford will be assured.
"One's experience here in Stanford
should be such that he will learn to
be a good citizen of the United States.
He should be ready and willing to do
active servie for the country in which
he lives."
Mrs. Stanford's Letter.
in conclusion, President Wilbur
read an address which Mrs. Stanford
prepared to deliver at the occasion of
Chancellor Jordan's installation, but
which she did not give. It was found
among some letters which she had
marked not to lie opened until after
her death. The letter follows:

storms, and hold our lives, its it were,
in their hands. To their watchfulness
and faitfulness we certainly have to
trust ourselves. They as a class are
our most self-sacrificing, heroic and
daring men. I never cross the con
tinent or the ocean without asking
blessings and reward to be bestowed
. upon them from the Highest Source
for their faithful service to mankind.
Day Sacred to Founders.
Perhaps it will not be improper for
Ime to say to these young men and
j women who have gathered here as
students that this day is held by us us
one of the most sacred of our lives.
We thought it a sacred day when we
laid the cornerstone of this institution,
and how often we have wondered ii
it would be our Heavenly Father's will
(Continued on pace three)
In a spirit of frank friendliness and j
genuine interest, President Wilbur j
met the students in assembly this
morning. A glimpse of Stanford as
it was in the early days, of the life
as it was when he came to the campus
as a student and of the first ideals of
the University, prefaced the new ex
ecutive's remarks concerning the fu
ture of his alma mater.
Among the early characteristics of
Stanford, the one which Dr. Wilbur
urged the present students most to
emulate was the spirit of contest
which prevailed. "The only way to
come to the top," he said, "is by
struggling. I therefore urge you to
get into college activities, for it is
greatly on account of them that you
will be remembered.
Iliizing Has >'o Place.
"The protection of Stanford's good
name is a traditional ideal in the
University," he continued. "And the
practice of hazing is entirely foreign
to that good name. It is a combina
tion of cowardice and bullyism, and
will have to go if student control is
to succeed. One advantage of an al
umnus president is that he is able to
feel genuine pride in the University's
achievements, but there is also the
disadvantage that he can see and de
plore its evils.
Limitation of Students.
"As to the future, it will be neces
sary to place a limit on the number
of students allowed to enter Stan
ford. With the ,>rt sent endowment
we cannot hope to expand extensively
and still do justice to our work. This
policy will not interfere with any ex
itsing student organizations, although
it is natural that the number of ad
isting student organizations, although
crease. The existing departments
will be developed to completion with
the present endowment. If it is pos
sible to secure additional endowment,

the University will develop along any ]
line that seems worth while.
"It is my hope that all students may
be able to live on the campus, anil
this will mean new dormitories. It is
a mistake for a person to classify
himself with any particular clique—
he should be one of the group. The
best in a college can only be secured
by mixing with the students as well
as in student activities.
Biggest Problem.
"My biggest problem, however, will
be to fill the gaps in the ranks of
the faculty, made by the retirement
of the men who have been with the
University for years. If I can suc
ceed in filling them well, the future
of Stanford will be assured.
"One's experience here in Stanford
should be such that he will learn to
be a good citizen of the United States.
He should be ready and willing to do
active servie for the country in which
he lives."
Mrs. Stanford's Letter.
in conclusion, President Wilbur
read an address which Mrs. Stanford
prepared to deliver at the occasion of
Chancellor Jordan's installation, but
which she did not give. It was found
among some letters which she had
marked not to lie opened until after
her death. The letter follows:
My husband has expressed the wish
that I would address a few words to
the student body. Perhaps it is be
fitting that 1 should do so, for since
the first conception of this work Mr.
Stanford and myself have been in uni
son and we have not only conferred
together earnestly and deeply, but we
have made this work a subject of deep
and earnest prayer. We fully realize
our own weakness and our inability
to accomplish anything by ourselves.
We are not deserving of praise for
what we have done; we are merely
following out a great plan that was
conceived by one far greater than our
selves, our Heavenly Father, and we
are but lowly instruments in his lov
ing hands.
Ite True To Best.
Our hearts have been more deeply
interested in this work than you can
| conceive. It was born in sorrow biic
lias now become a great joy to om 1
hearts. While Mr. Stanford lias di
lated ou book education 1 desire to
impress upon the minds of each one of
these students, both male and female,
that we have at heart and very closely
the hope that you will each strive to
place before yourselves a high moral
standard; that you will resolve to go
forth from these class rooms determ
ined in the future to lie leaders with
high aims and pure standards; and
live such lives tiiat it will lie said of
you that you are true to the best you
know. I hope your lives will be truly
earnest, not in the sense of going
forth to acquire great wealth and
great names; but to be conscientious
I workers, to be helpful to others, to
I
| send cheer and goodwill to those who
| need lifting up, and to always follow
i the Golden Rule, "to do unto others as
I you would have others do unto you."
j Necessity of Patience.
For a while you will be obliged to
practice great patience. You have
gathered together from different parts
of the United States, strangers to eacn
other, and everything is at present 1111- !
organized. It will take you some time
to accustom yourselves to your new
surroundings, and to the different ele
ments you will come in contact with;
consequently we are desirous that you
should lie tolerant until all of the
machinery is in good working order.
I am also anxious that these young
men should treat the young ladies who
have entered this institution with the
greatest deference; that they will be
in their ambition for a thorough edu
cation. We have started you both
helpful in aiding and cheering them
on the same equality and we hope for
the best results.
Tribute to Labor.
Many of the young men who have
entered this institution have come not
only to improve their mental faculties,
but to teach their hands to lie skilled
in manual labor and for these young
men my heart goes out with great
sympathy and hope; for many will
have nothing but the work of their
hands to sustain them in the future.
We are anxious that they should have
all the advantages possible. I feel
tiiat the laborers of our country have
not that encouragement and cheer
they should receive from those who
have had superior advantages and
larger means. Skilled laborers should
be held in higher esteem and given
more respect and consideration. 1
have in my mind the engineers who
carry our great railroads across the
continent and our great leviathans
across the oceans; they stand at the
helm faithfully through darkness and
storms, and hold our lives, its it were,
in their hands. To their watchfulness
and faitfulness we certainly have to
trust ourselves. They as a class are

ceed in filling them well, the future
of Stanford will be assured.
"One's experience here in Stanford
should be such that he will learn to
be a good citizen of the United States.
He should be ready and willing to do
active servie for the country in which
he lives."
Mrs. Stanford's Letter.
in conclusion, President Wilbur
read an address which Mrs. Stanford
prepared to deliver at the occasion of
Chancellor Jordan's installation, but
which she did not give. It was found
among some letters which she had
marked not to lie opened until after
her death. The letter follows:
My husband has expressed the wish
that I would address a few words to
the student body. Perhaps it is be
fitting that 1 should do so, for since
the first conception of this work Mr.
Stanford and myself have been in uni
son and we have not only conferred
together earnestly and deeply, but we
have made this work a subject of deep
and earnest prayer. We fully realize
our own weakness and our inability
to accomplish anything by ourselves.
We are not deserving of praise for
what we have done; we are merely
following out a great plan that was
conceived by one far greater than our
selves, our Heavenly Father, and we
are but lowly instruments in his lov
ing hands.
Ite True To Best.
Our hearts have been more deeply
interested in this work than you can
| conceive. It was born in sorrow biic
lias now become a great joy to om 1
hearts. While Mr. Stanford lias di
lated ou book education 1 desire to
impress upon the minds of each one of
these students, both male and female,
that we have at heart and very closely
the hope that you will each strive to
place before yourselves a high moral
standard; that you will resolve to go
forth from these class rooms determ
ined in the future to lie leaders with
high aims and pure standards; and
live such lives tiiat it will lie said of
you that you are true to the best you
know. I hope your lives will be truly
earnest, not in the sense of going
forth to acquire great wealth and
great names; but to be conscientious
I workers, to be helpful to others, to
I
| send cheer and goodwill to those who
| need lifting up, and to always follow
i the Golden Rule, "to do unto others as
I you would have others do unto you."
j Necessity of Patience.
For a while you will be obliged to
practice great patience. You have
gathered together from different parts
of the United States, strangers to eacn
other, and everything is at present 1111- !
organized. It will take you some time
to accustom yourselves to your new
surroundings, and to the different ele
ments you will come in contact with;
consequently we are desirous that you
should lie tolerant until all of the
machinery is in good working order.
I am also anxious that these young
men should treat the young ladies who
have entered this institution with the
greatest deference; that they will be
in their ambition for a thorough edu
cation. We have started you both
helpful in aiding and cheering them
on the same equality and we hope for
the best results.
Tribute to Labor.
Many of the young men who have
entered this institution have come not
only to improve their mental faculties,
but to teach their hands to lie skilled
in manual labor and for these young
men my heart goes out with great
sympathy and hope; for many will
have nothing but the work of their
hands to sustain them in the future.
We are anxious that they should have
all the advantages possible. I feel
tiiat the laborers of our country have
not that encouragement and cheer
they should receive from those who
have had superior advantages and
larger means. Skilled laborers should
be held in higher esteem and given
more respect and consideration. 1
have in my mind the engineers who
carry our great railroads across the
continent and our great leviathans
across the oceans; they stand at the
helm faithfully through darkness and
storms, and hold our lives, its it were,
in their hands. To their watchfulness
and faitfulness we certainly have to
trust ourselves. They as a class are
our most self-sacrificing, heroic and
daring men. I never cross the con
tinent or the ocean without asking
blessings and reward to be bestowed
. upon them from the Highest Source
for their faithful service to mankind.
Day Sacred to Founders.
Perhaps it will not be improper for
Ime to say to these young men and
j women who have gathered here as
students that this day is held by us us
one of the most sacred of our lives.
We thought it a sacred day when we
laid the cornerstone of this institution,
and how often we have wondered ii
it would be our Heavenly Father's will
