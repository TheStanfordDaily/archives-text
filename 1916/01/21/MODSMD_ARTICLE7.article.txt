# NEW PRESIDENT WINS STANFORD Dr. Wilbur Outlines Ideals of Founders in Talk
## 
### 
In a spirit of frank friendliness and j
genuine interest, President Wilbur j
met the students in assembly this
morning. A glimpse of Stanford as
it was in the early days, of the life
as it was when he came to the campus
as a student and of the first ideals of
the University, prefaced the new ex
ecutive's remarks concerning the fu
ture of his alma mater.
Among the early characteristics of
Stanford, the one which Dr. Wilbur
urged the present students most to
emulate was the spirit of contest
which prevailed. "The only way to
come to the top," he said, "is by
struggling. I therefore urge you to
get into college activities, for it is
greatly on account of them that you
will be remembered.
Iliizing Has >'o Place.
"The protection of Stanford's good
name is a traditional ideal in the
University," he continued. "And the
practice of hazing is entirely foreign
to that good name. It is a combina
tion of cowardice and bullyism, and
will have to go if student control is
to succeed. One advantage of an al
umnus president is that he is able to
feel genuine pride in the University's
achievements, but there is also the
disadvantage that he can see and de
plore its evils.
Limitation of Students.
"As to the future, it will be neces
sary to place a limit on the number
of students allowed to enter Stan
ford. With the ,>rt sent endowment
we cannot hope to expand extensively
and still do justice to our work. This
policy will not interfere with any ex
itsing student organizations, although
it is natural that the number of ad
isting student organizations, although
crease. The existing departments
will be developed to completion with
the present endowment. If it is pos
sible to secure additional endowment,

the University will develop along any ]
line that seems worth while.
"It is my hope that all students may
be able to live on the campus, anil
this will mean new dormitories. It is
a mistake for a person to classify
himself with any particular cliqueâ€”
he should be one of the group. The
best in a college can only be secured
by mixing with the students as well
as in student activities.
Biggest Problem.
"My biggest problem, however, will
be to fill the gaps in the ranks of
the faculty, made by the retirement
of the men who have been with the
University for years. If I can suc
ceed in filling them well, the future
of Stanford will be assured.
"One's experience here in Stanford
should be such that he will learn to
be a good citizen of the United States.
He should be ready and willing to do
active servie for the country in which
he lives."
Mrs. Stanford's Letter.
in conclusion, President Wilbur
read an address which Mrs. Stanford
prepared to deliver at the occasion of
Chancellor Jordan's installation, but
which she did not give. It was found
among some letters which she had
marked not to lie opened until after
her death. The letter follows:
My husband has expressed the wish
that I would address a few words to
the student body. Perhaps it is be
fitting that 1 should do so, for since
the first conception of this work Mr.
Stanford and myself have been in uni
son and we have not only conferred
together earnestly and deeply, but we
have made this work a subject of deep
and earnest prayer. We fully realize
our own weakness and our inability
to accomplish anything by ourselves.
We are not deserving of praise for
what we have done; we are merely
