# YOUNGER GENERATION TO BE BUILDERS OF STANFORD
## DR. STILLMAN LOOKS AHEAD New Executive Will Exert Wide Influence Upon Policies of University 
### 
Vice-President John Maxson Still
man, speaking on behalf of the fac
ility of Stanford, said:
It is to be regretted that matters of
high public service have prevented
our honored President Emeritus Dr.
J. C. liranner, from extending felicita
tions to his successor and welcoming
him on behalf of the faculty. His
absence has necessitated that that
honorable privilege should fall upon
losk worthy shoulders.
Pioneers liegnii Stanford's Work.
Near to a quarter of a century has
passed since Stanford University
opened its gates to the ambitious
youth of America and of other na
tions. Its honored first President and
his pioneer faculty were all young—
so very young they seem to us now —
scarcely any over forty and many
much younger. They came together
inspired by the high enthusiasm of
their leader, to build on this far
western border of the continent a new
University which should embody the
best experience of the past unhamper
ed by the bondage of outworn tradi
tions. That the results have realized
all their dreams would indeed be
much to claim. How well they have
succeeded it is perhaps too soon to
judge, liut something of value, I be
lieve, they have achieved, and this it
is that has given to Stanford Univer
sity whatever distinction it bears in
the academic world.
Younger tJeneraition to Control.
Those who labored in the earliest
years are gradually making place for
a younger generation of scholars and
administrators, into whose hands must
soon pass the responsibility for the |
future progress ol' Stanford Univer- i
sity. j
The inauguration today of Hay Ly- I
man Wilbur as successor in the presi- !
dency to the honored elder scholars, [
David Starr Jordan and .John Casper j
Branner, felicitously signalizes the ad
vent of a new era in the life-history
of our University. The office of Presi
dent. of Stanford University is by the
Deed of Trust invested with great
authority and necessarily, therefore,
with correspondingly great responsi
bilities. It is made the duty of the
Trustees to give the President such
powers as will enable him to control
the educational part of the University
to such an extent that lie may justly
be held responsible for the course of
study therein and for the good con
duct and capacity of the professors
and teachers. To this end the Board
of Trustees has enacted that he shall
lie primarily responsible for the en
forcement of discipline in the Univer
sity; that all nominations to the fac
ulty shall come from him, that he
shall be chairman of the Academic
Council and of its Executive Commit
tee, that he shall be the head of the
faculty of any schools which may in
future lie organized, that he shall with
the approval of the Board of Trustees
designate the executive heads of the
various departments and that they
shall hold office at his will. It is fur
ther provided that he shall be the of
ficial medium of communication be
tween the faculties and the Trustees
and between the students and the
Trustees.
President Kxerts Powerful Influence.
Endowed with such powers it fol
lows that the President of the Univer
sity is in position to exert a profound
influence upon the organization and
the academic policies of the Univer
sity. And with such powers must go
great responsibilities. It is no slight
burden of care and labor that accom
panies the high honor of the presi
dency of Stanford. Clearness of vis-
I ion, patience, breadth of knowledge,
! sympathetic understanding, and high
ideals of educational aims, must lie
associated with a judicial temper and
administrative capacity of a high
1 order, that Trustees, faculty, alumni
and students may harmoniously co
operate throughout the years to bring
forth from the soil of the University
the finest fruitage of scholarship, of
loyalty and of public service. Stan
ford University looks back upon a life
history of inspiring leadership under
scholars of great renown, whose ser
vices are her priceless heritage. She
is justly proud of the reputation that
she has achieved under their able
leadership. In these pioneer decades
of her existence she has had many
serious problems to solve —many dif
ficulties to meet, many obstacles to
overcome. But the laborers in her
fields have had rich compensations for
their labors, their occasional anxieties
and disappointments, in the fellow
ship of unselfish workers, and in the
realization of progress achieved.
Problems Not Diminishing.
Let us not cherish the illusion, how
ever, that the problems will lie less
serious, nor the difficulties fewer, that
are to meet the next generation of
Stanford scholars and administrators.
If, as f believe, the stability and per
petuity of democratic institutions
must in the long run depend upon

I popular education, technical, intellect- !
' ual. and ethical, it must lie patent to j
every intelligent observer that the j
task which faces the American Uni- !
versity is great enough to tax to the ■
utmost the wisdom of the future j
guardians of the destiny of Stanford. 1
Facing these problems of the future j
it is a matter o!' congratulation and I
encouragement that no unimportant ;
share in the development of Stanford j
I will fall upon her own children —al-
ready there are many graduates of
Stanford in her faculty—many of
them of the highest promise; alread v I
| her sons are represented by able
j alumni upon her Hoard of Trustees —
| and her alumni are rapidly making
; their places of influence in all fields i
of activity and in all quarters of the |
globe. I
Confidence In I)r. Wilbur.
And to you, President Wilbur, we
| look with hope and confidence to find
j a leader who shall marshal the en- j
| ergy and enthusiasm of this new gen- j
i eration of Stanford workers to in-
I creasing efficiency of service. You
] are a graduate from the pioneer days
of Stanford; as student, as teacher,
.as head of an important department;
you are familiar with her intimate
history, her achievements, her ideals
j and her traditions. We know r your
loyal devotion to the interests of your
i alma mater, and we have trust in
! your ability and your courage to sue
f
! cessfully advance her usefulness lo
I still higher planes of service.
You enter upon your office with the
! consciousness that you are no
' stranger to students, alumni, to fac-
I
ulty or trustees, and with the knowl
edge that you have from all their re
spect and loyal support.
Stanford Facility Welcomes.
j All of Stanford welcome you with
i loyal hearts. And we of the faculty,
for whom I assume to speak—and
more especially for those who soon
must pass from the active service of
the University, it is our earnest wis.i.
that when another quarter century
shall have passed, when your head
lias silvered in the service of this, our
University, and you shall sometime
stand upon this platform as Presi
dent Emeritus, that that Greater Stan
ford that is lo lie, with gratitude and
affection may greet you with that
greatest of benedictions—"Well done,
thou good and faithful servant."
