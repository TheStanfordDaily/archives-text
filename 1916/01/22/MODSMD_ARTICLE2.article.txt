# WELCOME EXTENDED BY PRESIDENT NEWHALL FOR TRUSTEES
## Expresses Appreciation of Loyal Service of Retiring Executive 
### 
William Mayo Newhall, president of
tlu; Hoard of Trustees, extended the
Trustees' welcome to President Wil
bur. After reading the resignation of
Dr. Branner, dated October 12, the
resolution of the Hoard of Trustees
accepting the resignation and appoint
ing Dr. Wilbur as his succossor, and
Dr. Wilbur's letter of acceptancc, lie
continued:
Possibly little, if anything, might bo
added to the words of the Hoard as
expressive of its sentiments towards
Dr. Hranner, but certainly an expres
sion of regret at his absence on this
occasion is not inappropriate.
Tribute to Or. Hranner.
Knowing the characteristic modesty
of the man it is not improbable that
an escape from our expressions might
lie welcome to him. In bis absence
the expressions of our proper recogni
tion will eliminate the somewhat un
savory feature of seeming fulsome
ness. What might be said of the man
that is not already known and rec- j
ognized? Hut little. I lis long and
most acceptable association with this
University is the best inscription for
his memorial of retirement. Dr. Hran
ner, for myself and for your host of
friends, I place a wreath of tribute
and of memory on the arm of your
vacant chair.
Founding Grant.
Dr. Wilbur, in accordance with our
academic procedure, you are presented
with a copy of the Founding Grant, as
symbolic of the authority and obliga
tion of Presidential office. Accept
them with the full significance of the
duties and requirements attending the
office. In the name of the Hoard of
Trustees I now formally invest you
with the authority and dignity of
Presidential office.
Sir; The duties and requirements
of your office are 110 small and incon
sequential matters. You arc charged
with not only the administration of
this University, but with the stand
ardization of the student body, not
only of today but for years to come.
You are charged not only with the
education of those student bodies but
with the putting of them out in the
world the better standardized for hav
ing been students of this University.
Need of Citizenship.
If a University cannot make of its
students better citizens—and all the
term citizen imports—for having been
a member of a University, then that
University is not a success. It is
more than not a success. It is a fail
ure. It is accepted that the first and
most important requirements of citi
zenship are respect and obedience of
the laws under which they live. The
rules and regulations of the University
are the laws of the land under which
the student lives. A training of re
spect and obedience for those rules
and regulations is the first step of cit
izenship for which the student should
be educated as he goes out into the
world.
Question of Import.
To me the question of most import
for our student bodies is not so much
of what they might have acquired of
cultural and vocational knowledge, as
what advantage that has been for re
lation and intercourse with their fel
low men and as commendable citi
zens in their respective communities.
Trustees' Good Wishes.
Sir; You have before you, as your
predecessors have had, the problems
and complexities of influencing and
moulding the characters and standards
of our country's youth. With all its
problems and complexities there is ex
tended to you by the Board of Trus
tees the heartiest good wishes in your
efforts and for your success.
