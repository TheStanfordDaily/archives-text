# PRESIDENT'S RECEPTION INFORMAL
## Two Hundred Will Be in on Gotham Telephone Line 
### 
President and .Mrs. Wilbur will r -?o
to the Stanford Union immediately
after the completion of the inaugura
tion formalities, and will there greet
their many friends. The gathering at
the Union will not be of the nature of
a formal reception, but will simply
serve as an opportunity for Stanford
people to meet the new president, and
to become better acquainted with him.
Inasmuch as the Union was originally
intended as the common meeting place
for all Stanford students, alumni and
faculty, tlie meeting of the new presi
dent and the students will be particu
larly appropriate on this day of IV.
Wilbur's odicial installation into of
fice.
At "> o'clock, following the "good
fellowship" meeting, representatives
of the Stanford students, alumni, fac
ulty, Hoard of Trustees, and I niver
sit.v women, will exchange greetings
with the New York Stanford alumni.
One hundred sets of double telephone
receivers have been installed in the
Union, and will be used by practically
two hundred Stanford people, who will
be able to "listen in" on the conver
sation to be carried on with alumni
in New York.
It had been hoped that I>r. John
Casper Branner would be present it
the New York alumni gathering, and
that bis voice would be heard on the
day of bis successor's installation, but
Stanford's president emeritus is now

on his way to Panama. In bis stead,
Professor Charles D. Marx, president
of the American Society of Civil En
gineers, who is now in the east, will
be heard from.
President Wilbur will speak to Mr.
Thoreau Crony 11, president of the New
York alumni. Following a cornet
solo from the eastern end of the line,
Dr. Wilbur will greet the president,
of the New York Stanford Women's
club. Chancellor Jordan will then

ber of short talks, to be announced at
