# EDUCATION MUST MEAN POWER
## President Wilbur University Should Solve Social Problems of Age Youthful Ideals and Hopes Centered Around Stanford 
### 
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, in accepting the presidency of Stanford, outlined
to some extent his policy for the future development of the university and
dwelt on his hdpes and ambitions that the institution of which he is an
alumnus may not only continue its present noble work, but become of greater
service to individuals and the world at large, llis address follows:
Men and Women of Stanford:
This day brings me a great responsibility, honor, and the hope that I may
prove worthy of the position of President and merit the many kind words that
have been said to me and of me by Stanford men. I accept the responsibility,
am grateful for the honor, and will strive with all that is in

back to those early days.

ers, the absence of traditions, the presence of both Senator and Mrs. Stanford,
the beautiful buildings, the University's surroundings, all conspired to foster
in me a deep love for Stanford. My associates had with me the privilege of
working under that rare group of men of character and learning, Imbued with
the spirit of the Argonauts, that had been gathered from many quarters by a
young and forceful president. To a degree in their very origin and training
they typified the West, as we know it —a composite of the best, the most virile,
the most venturesome spirits front all parts of a new and noble land. It is 110
wonder there was a swing, a force to those early years that we can .hardly
hope to see duplicated. It did much to engender that loyalty and faith that
have carried Stanford University triumphantly through the death of its Found
ers, the great government law suit, the lean years of building, and the destruc
tion wrought by the earthquake.

My own growth has been alongside
that of Stanford; my heart has been
with it through all of its years. Now,
as one of its sons, to be designated as
its leader is one of those sacred re
sponsibilities that can only be under
taken with a spirit of humility
panied by a firm endeavor to do one's
best. Looking back to my first years,
and thinking again of the place given
by me to Dr. Jordan as a man and as
an ideal, I feel the great responsibilty
upon me as intensified. It is to the
young men and young women of Stan
ford that are coming bore now, as wo
alumni did at the beginning, that i
propose to devote my life. 1 see in
them boys and girls like my class
mates. To them and to those who
follow them did Senator and Mrs.
Stanford devote their fortune, their
best efforts, their love. To these stud
ents. we of the faculty look to carry
on our work when we lay it down, to
represent our best thoughts, to fulfill
our hopes. To this end are they here.
To this end have they been taken out
of the ordinary current of life to spend
a few years with us.
Stai 11 ford's Task.
What is there in a University that
it should have such a chance, such a
responsibility? It seems to me that
there is 110 worthier task, with broader
possible scope, with higher human
possibilities, than that offered by the
University. It should be the seat, of
the greatest aspirations of the human
mind. Its very breath should be that
of catholicity, of idealism, and above
all, truth. Trivialities, prejudice, nar
rowness, should have no place. An
inculcation of the love of truth, of the
joy of seeking truth, should be its
main duty. Not a mere seeking after
abstract truth, but after a knowledge
of life, of life processes, human rela
tionships, such as will lead to knowl
edge of nature's laws and a desire to
conform to them, to be useful, to be of
service, and to serve the truth. The
University should not be something
apart from the life of the world about
it. It. should break down barriers that
tradition or ignorance have built up,
and it should stand out in a master
ful relationship with all worthy en
deavors. setting standards, stimulating
progress.
Democrat*} of Intellect.
The University is necessarily a part
of the educational system. It must
be jealous of its prerogatives; it re
quires some form of certification for
work previously done in order that it
may devote its energies to real Uni
versity work, and must give proper
credit to those who complete (he var
ious stages of its curriculum. It must
have high standards to prevent waste
of its time on the incompetent, the
idler, and the trifier. Nevertheless, we
must not take our University degrees
too seriously. A Bachelor of Arts
from the University of "Hard Knocks"
may mean power, courage, manhood,
development, while an A. B. from an
actual University too often means that
some one else has paid the bills for a
period of genteel idling, social fol-de
rol, and a minimum of honest en
deavor. It is important to realize that
(lie University should be a place for
democracy of the intellect and that 't
should keep open door for those cap

able of using its facilities, for those
who aspire to learn, to lead, to be use
ful—those who have high aspirations.
Snobbishness, superiority, patronizing
of the less fortunate, should be im
possible The University professor
should be looked upon as a highly de
veloped, useful citizen; not as some
thing apart, imponderable, cloud
scraping. The type of education so
popular in the past, so eminently im
practical, except in the general train
ing it gave, has done much to cultivate
an abnormal view of the University
and its chief exponent, the professor.
Now human knowledge is so wide
spread, so useful, so essential in busi
ness, trade, commerce, and the pro
fessions, we must insist that the Uni
versity take its rightful place in
human affairs and be rightly evaluated
by those both without and within.
Kccriiitiiig Ground for Youth.
To the universities, their teachers,
| their research workers, must we look
for the solution of many great social
j problems, and for the control of those
unnecessary diseases that, devour the
! very marrow of the race. To the uni
-1
versities must we turn for facts in
! order that we may face with open
; oyes the world as it is and strive to
make it the world that it should be.
The universites must lead in the fight
| against oppression, evil, ignorance,
filth. We cannot be neutral in these
! struggles. We must be positive forces,
making the University the recruiting
ground for youth, arming them for
the big tasks of the race.
.Hake HOOlll for the New.
Stanford has already done much
'along this line. We can do much
more. We can stand for the things
we choose to stand for and should
! elect to do well what we select to do.
Stanford, to be a real university, must
keep an atmosphere favorable to re
search. to new ideas, to thinkers of
all sorts. Merely to retail acquired
I book knowledge to successive groups
of students would be a sorry life for
i a real University man. He must add
something new, must study old prob
lems in new ways, ever be thinking,
[ studying. As a University worker he
must know the solutions of the past
i and yet stand 011 the edge of that great
I field of the unknown > that is still dark.
Each year should see light let in,
fresh conquests made, definite steps
forward. The wonderful, immutable
laws of nature, when once ascertained,
are dependable, and give us new power
in making life sweeter, more effective,
safer.
The desire to learn new things must
J lie in the air. Merely to set up baubles
to encourage scholarship and research
| may be expedient, but we cannot ex
pect a man who considers these as
worth much, or at least, as goals at
tained, to go far along the plodding
road of new thought or new discovery.
No I'laee for Stagnation.
There can be 110 place for the men
tally stagnant; no place for those
who fail to grow each year. The Uni-
I versity must be untrammeled in its
right (o riil itself of the incompetent
and indolent among its students and
I the ineffectives and mediocrities in its
j faculty. It cannot hope to lead, to
inspire, if if is weighed down by such
burdens. Indefinite or life term ol
professors is meant to give security
.and scope for wide training, deep
knowledge, profound study, not to pro
vide an easy and permanent resting
place for those who once arrive. We
professors should keep our high re
sponsibilities in mind. We cannot con
form to any one pattern. Some of us
must needs be primarily, teachers;
others, investigators. It will be my
solemn duty to try to see that the
teachers of Stanford in the future
reach that same high quality of char
acter and scholarship that makes the
University of today. I must, with the
help of my associates, protect the
future students of Stanford and try
to see that they come in contact with
real men and real minds. T hope and
trust that the Faculty will use me to
protect them in their work, to assume
as far as possible administrative du
ties that interfere with their devotion
to the special work before them.
A Foster Parent.
The University occupies the position,
no matter how hard it may try at
times to avoid it, of foster parent to
the youths who come to it. We look
upon the family and its purity as the
greatest influence upon our boys and
girls. Environment means so much.
We must keep the University environ
ment clean; we must keep our stu
dents exposed to men of high charac
ter and scholarly attainments. There
must be an atmosphere favorable to
healthful lives, physical exercise, clean
minds, and clean bodies. The gospel
of work should need no particular
advocacy in a University whose object
is "to qualify its students for personal
success and direct usefulness in life."
Maintain a Standard. *
There is now a well understood and
accepted standard of Stanford life. \t
is in the hands of the students to see
whether they will maintain it at a
high level —whether they will demon
strate that student self-government
makes for character building. Why
not reserve Stanford for men and
women with a purpose high enough to
putin their proper place the distract
ions of University life that can be of
great service if not over-done? Why not
keep Stanford free from the curse of
luxury, of aimlessness, of mere money
spending? Why not free ourselves
promptly from those who early demon
strate that they have not the instincts
of the true man or woman, so that we
will not run the risk of placing the
name of Stanford upon those who are
unworthy?
Legacy of Founders.
Our founders pondered long over the
various ways they might be of the
most service to the students of Stan
ford. Mrs. Stanford saw the. need for
some form of religion, felt the en
nobling effect of high example and
high precept. She built this splendid
church, made it free from the man
made creed and varieties of religion,
but devoted it to the best that is in
us, to the highest hopes and yearnings
of life, to that Power which means
something different to each one of us,
but stands with all of us for faith,
hope and charity—for that which is
pure, ennobling, self-denying, loving.
We must be deeply thankful to Mrs.
Stanford for this, her watchful care
and solicitude, and we must help t.)
foster those influences so cherished by
her. Let each man choose his own
method of worship, but we can here
give our students the chance to hear
the words of those who seek to inter
pret the religious thought and teach
ing of the day or to guide us in the
ethical aspects of human conduct.
Part <>t' Alumni.
The Alumni of Stanford are now
becoming fully grown. They will mean
much more each year than ever before.
The mirror to the outside world the
effects of their training. In them and
in their acts are seen the results of
the University's work. Theirs is the
responsibility of the older brother for
the younger, so far as the student is

concerned, and of the independent son
to the parent, so far as the Faculty
is concerned. They must give their
confidence and support to the Faculty.
The Faculty is ever changing and
should be fully up to date. The Alumni
are almost sure to reflect their own
period of training and the ideals of
their own student days. It is perhaps
because of this that many institutions
complain of a hampering influence ex
erted upon the universities by various
alumni, of abnormal athletic stimula
tion, and other abuses. Stanford has
been most forutnate in its Alumni.
Many of them kept in close touch with
the growth and changes in the Uni
versity. If the Alumni will keep fully
informed, if they will use the Presi
dent, if need be, to help them to get
the facts, 1 am sure that Stanford will
go far in the generation to come. I
count on the assistance of the Alumni
at every step.
Intensify Development.
Stanford has won a well established
place among universities. Its growth
having almost reached the limit of its
present endowment, it is necessary to
choose its work and develop thorough
ly its chosen fields in order to retain
its present elements of strength. The
first step is to limit the number of
those to be received as students. The
next step must be to ascertain by carc
ful study how by cooperation and mu
tual interest we can get the most out
of the University's income, give most
to the students, and do the most crea
tive work. We must decide in how
far we are justified in teaching sub
jects equally well taught in dozens of
other places. We must confine our
elementary work to subjects that lead
somewhere. One of our strongest fea
tures is that in certain professional
departments careful supervision of the
work of an entering student is possible
from the freshman year onward. With
the establishment of a maximum num
ber for students it is inevitable that
more and more advanced students will
be received and a higher average grade
of work done. This will mean less
elementary work of a general type, but
it need not interfere with the Univer
sity's handling such work where it
can be done better than in the second
ary schools. The great development
of these schools will soon free us
from the necessity of handling many
preparatory studies. Where in the
University elementary work is not
carefully supervised and at least in
part handled by the full professor, the
master, it is apt to be given less well
than by those in a secondary school
devoting their life to teach certain sub
jects. Too much beginning work is
done in Universities either as a chore
or by advanced students, earnest but
lacking that breadth of view essential
in teaching the elements of any sub
ject.
Value of Major Department.
There is great value in the major
department system. It is a splendid
thing to learn to do at least one thing
well, to do some advanced work in a
subject. The major department system
has shown at Stanford a tendency t.>
crystallize, to become inelastic. It
must be more compressible here, moro
expansile there, if it is to meet the
changing requirements of the time. Its
best feature, the opportunity of the ex
pert to advise and assist the student
in planning bis own education, has
been sadly neglected in some depart
ments. It is in danger of falling of its
own weight in many particulars unless
those who manage it become more in
, terested in its application and more
liberal in their interpretation of it and
lend themselves readily to that coop
oration which is necessary to the needs
of new types of training required for
special work, special research, voca
tional preparation, some modification
must be found that will stand for
effectiveness and be elastic enough to
meet individual requirements and new
needs.
With proper coordination of the ex
isting departments, with the elimina

tioa of courses that practically dupli
cate others, with a consistent main
tenance of high standards of scholar
ship there is every reason to believe
that the University has sufficient re
sources available to make the brand
of Stanford upon a scholar, be he
chemist, philologist, or historian, upon
a teacher, engineer, physician, lawyer,
or journalist, mean thorough training,
and we hope superior merit.
Stanford's Resources.
We have a large endowment, a Hoard
of Trustees made up of unselfish men,
deeply interested in every phase of the
University's welfare, a splendid Facul
ty, a loyal group of Alumni, a fine stu
dent body, beautiful buildings, and a
healthful, inspiring environment. Our
country is new, very new\ Here in
California the product of the mingled
races of the Occidental world meet on
the ever nearer border of the Orient.
Who can forsee what this will mean in
moral, mental, and spiritual develop
ment. A great intellectual and artistic
future seems to open before us. Let
us here at Stanford welcome it, freeing
ourselves as heretofore from the tyran
ny of precedent, of the past, except in
so far as the past has shown the right
principles of conduct and has discover
ed facts. Let us be conservative 'n
holding to that which is good and true
and essential, and above all to justice,
but radical in our willingness to re
ceive and understand the new while
' discarding promptly the trivial and the
transient. We can be free to give that
legitimate scope to active minds essen
tial in order to make a university. It
' is largely a matter of men —of men of
character, of men whose trained men
tal processes permit them a wide
j range. It is a great privilege to be
a part of such a real University, either
'as a student, teacher or trustee. One
of the great features of such a Univer
sity must be loyalty. I want to say to
the Trustees, Faculty, and Alumni that
in this period when these young people
are entrusted to use we must not for
get to teach them something of the
growth and history of our own coun
try, of the principles leading its early
founders to begin on this continent
' new forms of democratic government.
They must be taught their deep re
responsibility as citizens and as guard
ians of those human rights, won after
!so many bitter contests. Without a
' proper safeguarding of those rights,
I without abiding loyalty and love of
I country, we may find that all else is
dross, because the essentials of con
trol are in the hands of those not sym
pathetic with the beautiful and in
i spiring ideals of our country.
>1 iittial Responsibility.
We must all tlie.n together stand
ready to do our utmost to defend and
to develop our institutions and our
country. Upon us, with the advan
, tages of university associations, falls
a full measure of responsibility. An
! education which brings with it
i dilettantism is as empty as a decorated
; egg shell. Education should be from
tlie heart outwards, should strengthen
the foundations of. character, enhance
the spirit of helpfulness, the desire to
be worth while in the days, be they
few or many, that lie before us. Edu
cation should make us loyal—loyal co
our University, to our country, above
all to truth.
Let us here at Stanford, Trustees,
Faculty, Alumni, and students, to
gether do our best as unselfish citi
zens to develop a university of serv
ice, of citizenship in its broadest sense,
of character—a place where truth is
paramount. In a word, a university
I of quality and of usefulness.

We must keep the University environ
ment clean; we must keep our stu
dents exposed to men of high charac
ter and scholarly attainments. There
must be an atmosphere favorable to
healthful lives, physical exercise, clean
minds, and clean bodies. The gospel
of work should need no particular
advocacy in a University whose object
is "to qualify its students for personal
success and direct usefulness in life."
Maintain a Standard. *
There is now a well understood and
accepted standard of Stanford life. \t
is in the hands of the students to see
whether they will maintain it at a
high level —whether they will demon
strate that student self-government
makes for character building. Why
not reserve Stanford for men and
women with a purpose high enough to
putin their proper place the distract
ions of University life that can be of
great service if not over-done? Why not
keep Stanford free from the curse of
luxury, of aimlessness, of mere money
spending? Why not free ourselves
promptly from those who early demon
strate that they have not the instincts
of the true man or woman, so that we
will not run the risk of placing the
name of Stanford upon those who are
unworthy?
Legacy of Founders.
Our founders pondered long over the
various ways they might be of the
most service to the students of Stan
ford. Mrs. Stanford saw the. need for
some form of religion, felt the en
nobling effect of high example and
high precept. She built this splendid
church, made it free from the man
made creed and varieties of religion,
but devoted it to the best that is in
us, to the highest hopes and yearnings
of life, to that Power which means
something different to each one of us,
but stands with all of us for faith,
hope and charity—for that which is
pure, ennobling, self-denying, loving.
We must be deeply thankful to Mrs.
Stanford for this, her watchful care
and solicitude, and we must help t.)
foster those influences so cherished by
her. Let each man choose his own
method of worship, but we can here
give our students the chance to hear
the words of those who seek to inter
pret the religious thought and teach
ing of the day or to guide us in the
ethical aspects of human conduct.
Part <>t' Alumni.
The Alumni of Stanford are now
becoming fully grown. They will mean
much more each year than ever before.
The mirror to the outside world the
effects of their training. In them and
in their acts are seen the results of
the University's work. Theirs is the
responsibility of the older brother for
the younger, so far as the student is

concerned, and of the independent son
to the parent, so far as the Faculty
is concerned. They must give their
confidence and support to the Faculty.
The Faculty is ever changing and
should be fully up to date. The Alumni
are almost sure to reflect their own
period of training and the ideals of
their own student days. It is perhaps
because of this that many institutions
complain of a hampering influence ex
erted upon the universities by various
alumni, of abnormal athletic stimula
tion, and other abuses. Stanford has
been most forutnate in its Alumni.
Many of them kept in close touch with
the growth and changes in the Uni
versity. If the Alumni will keep fully
informed, if they will use the Presi
dent, if need be, to help them to get
the facts, 1 am sure that Stanford will
go far in the generation to come. I
count on the assistance of the Alumni
at every step.
Intensify Development.
Stanford has won a well established
place among universities. Its growth
having almost reached the limit of its
present endowment, it is necessary to
choose its work and develop thorough
ly its chosen fields in order to retain
its present elements of strength. The
first step is to limit the number of
those to be received as students. The
next step must be to ascertain by carc
ful study how by cooperation and mu
tual interest we can get the most out
of the University's income, give most
to the students, and do the most crea
tive work. We must decide in how
far we are justified in teaching sub
jects equally well taught in dozens of
other places. We must confine our
elementary work to subjects that lead
somewhere. One of our strongest fea
tures is that in certain professional
departments careful supervision of the
work of an entering student is possible
from the freshman year onward. With
the establishment of a maximum num
ber for students it is inevitable that
more and more advanced students will
be received and a higher average grade
of work done. This will mean less
elementary work of a general type, but
it need not interfere with the Univer
sity's handling such work where it
can be done better than in the second
ary schools. The great development
of these schools will soon free us
from the necessity of handling many
preparatory studies. Where in the
University elementary work is not
carefully supervised and at least in
part handled by the full professor, the
master, it is apt to be given less well
than by those in a secondary school
devoting their life to teach certain sub
jects. Too much beginning work is
done in Universities either as a chore
or by advanced students, earnest but
lacking that breadth of view essential
in teaching the elements of any sub
ject.
Value of Major Department.
There is great value in the major
department system. It is a splendid
thing to learn to do at least one thing
well, to do some advanced work in a
subject. The major department system
has shown at Stanford a tendency t.>
crystallize, to become inelastic. It
must be more compressible here, moro
expansile there, if it is to meet the
changing requirements of the time. Its
best feature, the opportunity of the ex
pert to advise and assist the student
in planning bis own education, has
been sadly neglected in some depart
ments. It is in danger of falling of its
own weight in many particulars unless
those who manage it become more in
, terested in its application and more
liberal in their interpretation of it and
lend themselves readily to that coop
oration which is necessary to the needs
of new types of training required for
special work, special research, voca
tional preparation, some modification
must be found that will stand for
effectiveness and be elastic enough to
meet individual requirements and new
needs.
With proper coordination of the ex
isting departments, with the elimina

tioa of courses that practically dupli
cate others, with a consistent main
tenance of high standards of scholar
ship there is every reason to believe
that the University has sufficient re
sources available to make the brand
of Stanford upon a scholar, be he
chemist, philologist, or historian, upon
a teacher, engineer, physician, lawyer,
or journalist, mean thorough training,
and we hope superior merit.
Stanford's Resources.
We have a large endowment, a Hoard
of Trustees made up of unselfish men,
deeply interested in every phase of the
University's welfare, a splendid Facul
ty, a loyal group of Alumni, a fine stu
dent body, beautiful buildings, and a
healthful, inspiring environment. Our
country is new, very new\ Here in
California the product of the mingled
races of the Occidental world meet on
the ever nearer border of the Orient.
Who can forsee what this will mean in
moral, mental, and spiritual develop
ment. A great intellectual and artistic
future seems to open before us. Let
us here at Stanford welcome it, freeing
ourselves as heretofore from the tyran
ny of precedent, of the past, except in
so far as the past has shown the right
principles of conduct and has discover
ed facts. Let us be conservative 'n
holding to that which is good and true
and essential, and above all to justice,
but radical in our willingness to re
ceive and understand the new while
' discarding promptly the trivial and the
transient. We can be free to give that
legitimate scope to active minds essen
tial in order to make a university. It
' is largely a matter of men —of men of
character, of men whose trained men
tal processes permit them a wide
j range. It is a great privilege to be
a part of such a real University, either
'as a student, teacher or trustee. One
of the great features of such a Univer
sity must be loyalty. I want to say to
the Trustees, Faculty, and Alumni that
in this period when these young people
are entrusted to use we must not for
get to teach them something of the
growth and history of our own coun
try, of the principles leading its early
founders to begin on this continent
' new forms of democratic government.
They must be taught their deep re
responsibility as citizens and as guard
ians of those human rights, won after
!so many bitter contests. Without a
' proper safeguarding of those rights,
I without abiding loyalty and love of
I country, we may find that all else is
dross, because the essentials of con
trol are in the hands of those not sym
pathetic with the beautiful and in
i spiring ideals of our country.
>1 iittial Responsibility.
We must all tlie.n together stand
ready to do our utmost to defend and
to develop our institutions and our
country. Upon us, with the advan
, tages of university associations, falls
a full measure of responsibility. An
! education which brings with it
i dilettantism is as empty as a decorated
; egg shell. Education should be from
tlie heart outwards, should strengthen
the foundations of. character, enhance
the spirit of helpfulness, the desire to
be worth while in the days, be they
few or many, that lie before us. Edu
cation should make us loyal—loyal co
our University, to our country, above
all to truth.
Let us here at Stanford, Trustees,
Faculty, Alumni, and students, to
gether do our best as unselfish citi
zens to develop a university of serv
ice, of citizenship in its broadest sense,
of character—a place where truth is
paramount. In a word, a university
I of quality and of usefulness.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, in accepting the presidency of Stanford, outlined
to some extent his policy for the future development of the university and
dwelt on his hdpes and ambitions that the institution of which he is an
alumnus may not only continue its present noble work, but become of greater
service to individuals and the world at large, llis address follows:
Men and Women of Stanford:
This day brings me a great responsibility, honor, and the hope that I may
prove worthy of the position of President and merit the many kind words that
have been said to me and of me by Stanford men. I accept the responsibility,
am grateful for the honor, and will strive with all that is in
Proud to be me to measure up to the work betore me. i have tried to
of Stanford think out why | was chosen to lead here at Stanford, to
understand why many of my old friends seem to take the
choice as a natural one. I take pride in believing that it is because I am con
sidered a typical Stanford man, familiar with this I'niversity and what it has
stood for. I came here as a boy twenty-three years ago, and my thoughts go
back to those early days.
The hazy, idealistic dreams of boyhood are hard to define, difficult to

realize, and usually merge into tho maze of emotions and experiences that
make up lite as we meet it from day to day.
My youtht'u dreams were crude—first to lie a great collector of birds, and
Lo to unexplored portions of the earth after new species; and second, to he a
physician, skilled in surgery and the care of the sick. An inspiring teacher
of civ'cs flir ted my interest so much that I seriously

hearty program of the University, the inspiration of its
1 eginniug, its new president—all appealed to me. and in spite of other sug
gestions, there was never a doul t in my mind as to where I would go to pro
pare for medicine.
The charm of those early days has never leftme. The freedom, the whole
some, unconventional ways, the personal association with enthusiastic teach-


President Haj Lynum Wilbur
ers, the absence of traditions, the presence of both Senator and Mrs. Stanford,
the beautiful buildings, the University's surroundings, all conspired to foster
in me a deep love for Stanford. My associates had with me the privilege of
working under that rare group of men of character and learning, Imbued with
the spirit of the Argonauts, that had been gathered from many quarters by a
young and forceful president. To a degree in their very origin and training
they typified the West, as we know it —a composite of the best, the most virile,
the most venturesome spirits front all parts of a new and noble land. It is 110
wonder there was a swing, a force to those early years that we can .hardly
hope to see duplicated. It did much to engender that loyalty and faith that
have carried Stanford University triumphantly through the death of its Found
ers, the great government law suit, the lean years of building, and the destruc
tion wrought by the earthquake.

My own growth has been alongside
that of Stanford; my heart has been
with it through all of its years. Now,
as one of its sons, to be designated as
its leader is one of those sacred re
sponsibilities that can only be under
taken with a spirit of humility
panied by a firm endeavor to do one's
best. Looking back to my first years,
and thinking again of the place given
by me to Dr. Jordan as a man and as
an ideal, I feel the great responsibilty
upon me as intensified. It is to the
young men and young women of Stan
ford that are coming bore now, as wo
alumni did at the beginning, that i
propose to devote my life. 1 see in
them boys and girls like my class
mates. To them and to those who
follow them did Senator and Mrs.
Stanford devote their fortune, their
best efforts, their love. To these stud
ents. we of the faculty look to carry
on our work when we lay it down, to
represent our best thoughts, to fulfill
our hopes. To this end are they here.
To this end have they been taken out
of the ordinary current of life to spend
a few years with us.
Stai 11 ford's Task.
What is there in a University that
it should have such a chance, such a
responsibility? It seems to me that
there is 110 worthier task, with broader
possible scope, with higher human
possibilities, than that offered by the
University. It should be the seat, of
the greatest aspirations of the human
mind. Its very breath should be that
of catholicity, of idealism, and above
all, truth. Trivialities, prejudice, nar
rowness, should have no place. An
inculcation of the love of truth, of the
joy of seeking truth, should be its
main duty. Not a mere seeking after
abstract truth, but after a knowledge
of life, of life processes, human rela
tionships, such as will lead to knowl
edge of nature's laws and a desire to
conform to them, to be useful, to be of
service, and to serve the truth. The
University should not be something
apart from the life of the world about
it. It. should break down barriers that
tradition or ignorance have built up,
and it should stand out in a master
ful relationship with all worthy en
deavors. setting standards, stimulating
progress.
Democrat*} of Intellect.
The University is necessarily a part
of the educational system. It must
be jealous of its prerogatives; it re
quires some form of certification for
work previously done in order that it
may devote its energies to real Uni
versity work, and must give proper
credit to those who complete (he var
ious stages of its curriculum. It must
have high standards to prevent waste
of its time on the incompetent, the
idler, and the trifier. Nevertheless, we
must not take our University degrees
too seriously. A Bachelor of Arts
from the University of "Hard Knocks"
may mean power, courage, manhood,
development, while an A. B. from an
actual University too often means that
some one else has paid the bills for a
period of genteel idling, social fol-de
rol, and a minimum of honest en
deavor. It is important to realize that
(lie University should be a place for
democracy of the intellect and that 't
should keep open door for those cap

able of using its facilities, for those
who aspire to learn, to lead, to be use
ful—those who have high aspirations.
Snobbishness, superiority, patronizing
of the less fortunate, should be im
possible The University professor
should be looked upon as a highly de
veloped, useful citizen; not as some
thing apart, imponderable, cloud
scraping. The type of education so
popular in the past, so eminently im
practical, except in the general train
ing it gave, has done much to cultivate
an abnormal view of the University
and its chief exponent, the professor.
Now human knowledge is so wide
spread, so useful, so essential in busi
ness, trade, commerce, and the pro
fessions, we must insist that the Uni
versity take its rightful place in
human affairs and be rightly evaluated
by those both without and within.
Kccriiitiiig Ground for Youth.
To the universities, their teachers,
| their research workers, must we look
for the solution of many great social
j problems, and for the control of those
unnecessary diseases that, devour the
! very marrow of the race. To the uni
-1
versities must we turn for facts in
! order that we may face with open
; oyes the world as it is and strive to
make it the world that it should be.
The universites must lead in the fight
| against oppression, evil, ignorance,
filth. We cannot be neutral in these
! struggles. We must be positive forces,
making the University the recruiting
ground for youth, arming them for
the big tasks of the race.
.Hake HOOlll for the New.
Stanford has already done much
'along this line. We can do much
more. We can stand for the things
we choose to stand for and should
! elect to do well what we select to do.
Stanford, to be a real university, must
keep an atmosphere favorable to re
search. to new ideas, to thinkers of
all sorts. Merely to retail acquired
I book knowledge to successive groups
of students would be a sorry life for
i a real University man. He must add
something new, must study old prob
lems in new ways, ever be thinking,
[ studying. As a University worker he
must know the solutions of the past
i and yet stand 011 the edge of that great
I field of the unknown > that is still dark.
Each year should see light let in,
fresh conquests made, definite steps
forward. The wonderful, immutable
laws of nature, when once ascertained,
are dependable, and give us new power
in making life sweeter, more effective,
safer.
The desire to learn new things must
J lie in the air. Merely to set up baubles
to encourage scholarship and research
| may be expedient, but we cannot ex
pect a man who considers these as
worth much, or at least, as goals at
tained, to go far along the plodding
road of new thought or new discovery.
No I'laee for Stagnation.
There can be 110 place for the men
tally stagnant; no place for those
who fail to grow each year. The Uni-
I versity must be untrammeled in its
right (o riil itself of the incompetent
and indolent among its students and
I the ineffectives and mediocrities in its
j faculty. It cannot hope to lead, to
inspire, if if is weighed down by such
burdens. Indefinite or life term ol
professors is meant to give security
.and scope for wide training, deep
knowledge, profound study, not to pro
vide an easy and permanent resting
place for those who once arrive. We
professors should keep our high re
sponsibilities in mind. We cannot con
form to any one pattern. Some of us
must needs be primarily, teachers;
others, investigators. It will be my
solemn duty to try to see that the
teachers of Stanford in the future
reach that same high quality of char
acter and scholarship that makes the
University of today. I must, with the
help of my associates, protect the
future students of Stanford and try
to see that they come in contact with
real men and real minds. T hope and
trust that the Faculty will use me to
protect them in their work, to assume
as far as possible administrative du
ties that interfere with their devotion
to the special work before them.
A Foster Parent.
The University occupies the position,
no matter how hard it may try at
times to avoid it, of foster parent to
the youths who come to it. We look
upon the family and its purity as the
greatest influence upon our boys and
girls. Environment means so much.
We must keep the University environ
ment clean; we must keep our stu
dents exposed to men of high charac
ter and scholarly attainments. There
must be an atmosphere favorable to
healthful lives, physical exercise, clean
minds, and clean bodies. The gospel
of work should need no particular
advocacy in a University whose object
is "to qualify its students for personal
success and direct usefulness in life."
Maintain a Standard. *
There is now a well understood and
accepted standard of Stanford life. \t
is in the hands of the students to see
whether they will maintain it at a
high level —whether they will demon
strate that student self-government
makes for character building. Why
not reserve Stanford for men and
women with a purpose high enough to
putin their proper place the distract
ions of University life that can be of
great service if not over-done? Why not
keep Stanford free from the curse of
luxury, of aimlessness, of mere money
spending? Why not free ourselves
promptly from those who early demon

of the true man or woman, so that we
will not run the risk of placing the

ers, the absence of traditions, the presence of both Senator and Mrs. Stanford,
the beautiful buildings, the University's surroundings, all conspired to foster
in me a deep love for Stanford. My associates had with me the privilege of
working under that rare group of men of character and learning, Imbued with
the spirit of the Argonauts, that had been gathered from many quarters by a
young and forceful president. To a degree in their very origin and training
they typified the West, as we know it —a composite of the best, the most virile,
the most venturesome spirits front all parts of a new and noble land. It is 110

My own growth has been alongside
that of Stanford; my heart has been
with it through all of its years. Now,
as one of its sons, to be designated as
its leader is one of those sacred re

taken with a spirit of humility
panied by a firm endeavor to do one's
best. Looking back to my first years,
and thinking again of the place given
by me to Dr. Jordan as a man and as
an ideal, I feel the great responsibilty
upon me as intensified. It is to the
young men and young women of Stan
ford that are coming bore now, as wo
alumni did at the beginning, that i
propose to devote my life. 1 see in
them boys and girls like my class
mates. To them and to those who
follow them did Senator and Mrs.
Stanford devote their fortune, their
best efforts, their love. To these stud
ents. we of the faculty look to carry
on our work when we lay it down, to
represent our best thoughts, to fulfill
our hopes. To this end are they here.
To this end have they been taken out
of the ordinary current of life to spend
a few years with us.
Stai 11 ford's Task.
What is there in a University that
it should have such a chance, such a
responsibility? It seems to me that
there is 110 worthier task, with broader
possible scope, with higher human
possibilities, than that offered by the
University. It should be the seat, of
the greatest aspirations of the human
mind. Its very breath should be that
of catholicity, of idealism, and above
all, truth. Trivialities, prejudice, nar
rowness, should have no place. An
inculcation of the love of truth, of the
joy of seeking truth, should be its
main duty. Not a mere seeking after
abstract truth, but after a knowledge
of life, of life processes, human rela
tionships, such as will lead to knowl
edge of nature's laws and a desire to
conform to them, to be useful, to be of
service, and to serve the truth. The
University should not be something
apart from the life of the world about
it. It. should break down barriers that
tradition or ignorance have built up,
and it should stand out in a master
ful relationship with all worthy en
deavors. setting standards, stimulating
progress.
Democrat*} of Intellect.
The University is necessarily a part
of the educational system. It must
be jealous of its prerogatives; it re
quires some form of certification for
work previously done in order that it
may devote its energies to real Uni
versity work, and must give proper
credit to those who complete (he var
ious stages of its curriculum. It must
have high standards to prevent waste
of its time on the incompetent, the
idler, and the trifier. Nevertheless, we
must not take our University degrees
too seriously. A Bachelor of Arts
from the University of "Hard Knocks"
may mean power, courage, manhood,
development, while an A. B. from an
actual University too often means that
some one else has paid the bills for a
period of genteel idling, social fol-de
rol, and a minimum of honest en
deavor. It is important to realize that
(lie University should be a place for
democracy of the intellect and that 't
should keep open door for those cap

able of using its facilities, for those
who aspire to learn, to lead, to be use
ful—those who have high aspirations.
Snobbishness, superiority, patronizing
of the less fortunate, should be im
possible The University professor
should be looked upon as a highly de
veloped, useful citizen; not as some
thing apart, imponderable, cloud
scraping. The type of education so
popular in the past, so eminently im
practical, except in the general train
ing it gave, has done much to cultivate
an abnormal view of the University
and its chief exponent, the professor.
Now human knowledge is so wide
spread, so useful, so essential in busi
ness, trade, commerce, and the pro
fessions, we must insist that the Uni
versity take its rightful place in
human affairs and be rightly evaluated
by those both without and within.
Kccriiitiiig Ground for Youth.
To the universities, their teachers,
| their research workers, must we look
for the solution of many great social
j problems, and for the control of those
unnecessary diseases that, devour the
! very marrow of the race. To the uni
-1
versities must we turn for facts in
! order that we may face with open
; oyes the world as it is and strive to
make it the world that it should be.
The universites must lead in the fight
| against oppression, evil, ignorance,
filth. We cannot be neutral in these
! struggles. We must be positive forces,
making the University the recruiting
ground for youth, arming them for
the big tasks of the race.
.Hake HOOlll for the New.
Stanford has already done much
'along this line. We can do much
more. We can stand for the things
we choose to stand for and should
! elect to do well what we select to do.
Stanford, to be a real university, must
keep an atmosphere favorable to re
search. to new ideas, to thinkers of
all sorts. Merely to retail acquired
I book knowledge to successive groups
of students would be a sorry life for
i a real University man. He must add
something new, must study old prob
lems in new ways, ever be thinking,
[ studying. As a University worker he
must know the solutions of the past
i and yet stand 011 the edge of that great
I field of the unknown > that is still dark.
Each year should see light let in,
fresh conquests made, definite steps
forward. The wonderful, immutable
laws of nature, when once ascertained,
are dependable, and give us new power
in making life sweeter, more effective,
safer.
The desire to learn new things must
J lie in the air. Merely to set up baubles
to encourage scholarship and research
| may be expedient, but we cannot ex
pect a man who considers these as
worth much, or at least, as goals at
tained, to go far along the plodding
road of new thought or new discovery.
No I'laee for Stagnation.
There can be 110 place for the men
tally stagnant; no place for those
who fail to grow each year. The Uni-
I versity must be untrammeled in its
right (o riil itself of the incompetent
and indolent among its students and
I the ineffectives and mediocrities in its
j faculty. It cannot hope to lead, to
inspire, if if is weighed down by such
burdens. Indefinite or life term ol
professors is meant to give security
.and scope for wide training, deep
knowledge, profound study, not to pro
vide an easy and permanent resting
place for those who once arrive. We
professors should keep our high re
sponsibilities in mind. We cannot con
form to any one pattern. Some of us
must needs be primarily, teachers;
others, investigators. It will be my
solemn duty to try to see that the
teachers of Stanford in the future
reach that same high quality of char
acter and scholarship that makes the
University of today. I must, with the
help of my associates, protect the
future students of Stanford and try
to see that they come in contact with
real men and real minds. T hope and
trust that the Faculty will use me to
protect them in their work, to assume
as far as possible administrative du
ties that interfere with their devotion
to the special work before them.
A Foster Parent.
The University occupies the position,
no matter how hard it may try at
times to avoid it, of foster parent to
the youths who come to it. We look
upon the family and its purity as the
greatest influence upon our boys and
girls. Environment means so much.
We must keep the University environ
ment clean; we must keep our stu
dents exposed to men of high charac
ter and scholarly attainments. There
must be an atmosphere favorable to
healthful lives, physical exercise, clean
minds, and clean bodies. The gospel
of work should need no particular
advocacy in a University whose object
is "to qualify its students for personal
success and direct usefulness in life."
Maintain a Standard. *
There is now a well understood and
accepted standard of Stanford life. \t
is in the hands of the students to see
whether they will maintain it at a
high level —whether they will demon
strate that student self-government
makes for character building. Why
not reserve Stanford for men and
women with a purpose high enough to
putin their proper place the distract
ions of University life that can be of
great service if not over-done? Why not
keep Stanford free from the curse of
luxury, of aimlessness, of mere money
spending? Why not free ourselves
promptly from those who early demon
strate that they have not the instincts
of the true man or woman, so that we
will not run the risk of placing the
name of Stanford upon those who are
unworthy?
Legacy of Founders.
Our founders pondered long over the
various ways they might be of the
most service to the students of Stan
ford. Mrs. Stanford saw the. need for
some form of religion, felt the en
nobling effect of high example and
high precept. She built this splendid
church, made it free from the man
made creed and varieties of religion,
but devoted it to the best that is in
us, to the highest hopes and yearnings
of life, to that Power which means
something different to each one of us,
but stands with all of us for faith,
hope and charity—for that which is
pure, ennobling, self-denying, loving.
We must be deeply thankful to Mrs.
Stanford for this, her watchful care
and solicitude, and we must help t.)
foster those influences so cherished by
her. Let each man choose his own
method of worship, but we can here
give our students the chance to hear
the words of those who seek to inter
pret the religious thought and teach
ing of the day or to guide us in the
ethical aspects of human conduct.
Part <>t' Alumni.
The Alumni of Stanford are now
becoming fully grown. They will mean
much more each year than ever before.
The mirror to the outside world the
effects of their training. In them and
in their acts are seen the results of
the University's work. Theirs is the
responsibility of the older brother for
the younger, so far as the student is

concerned, and of the independent son
to the parent, so far as the Faculty
is concerned. They must give their
confidence and support to the Faculty.
The Faculty is ever changing and
should be fully up to date. The Alumni
are almost sure to reflect their own
period of training and the ideals of
their own student days. It is perhaps
because of this that many institutions
complain of a hampering influence ex
erted upon the universities by various
alumni, of abnormal athletic stimula
tion, and other abuses. Stanford has
been most forutnate in its Alumni.
Many of them kept in close touch with
the growth and changes in the Uni
versity. If the Alumni will keep fully
informed, if they will use the Presi
dent, if need be, to help them to get
the facts, 1 am sure that Stanford will
go far in the generation to come. I
count on the assistance of the Alumni
at every step.
Intensify Development.
Stanford has won a well established
place among universities. Its growth
having almost reached the limit of its
present endowment, it is necessary to
choose its work and develop thorough
ly its chosen fields in order to retain
its present elements of strength. The
first step is to limit the number of
those to be received as students. The
next step must be to ascertain by carc
ful study how by cooperation and mu
tual interest we can get the most out
of the University's income, give most
to the students, and do the most crea
tive work. We must decide in how
far we are justified in teaching sub
jects equally well taught in dozens of
other places. We must confine our
elementary work to subjects that lead
somewhere. One of our strongest fea
tures is that in certain professional
departments careful supervision of the
work of an entering student is possible
from the freshman year onward. With
the establishment of a maximum num
ber for students it is inevitable that
more and more advanced students will
be received and a higher average grade
of work done. This will mean less
elementary work of a general type, but
it need not interfere with the Univer
sity's handling such work where it
can be done better than in the second
ary schools. The great development
of these schools will soon free us
from the necessity of handling many
preparatory studies. Where in the
University elementary work is not
carefully supervised and at least in
part handled by the full professor, the
master, it is apt to be given less well
than by those in a secondary school
devoting their life to teach certain sub
jects. Too much beginning work is
done in Universities either as a chore
or by advanced students, earnest but
lacking that breadth of view essential
in teaching the elements of any sub
ject.
Value of Major Department.
There is great value in the major
department system. It is a splendid
thing to learn to do at least one thing
well, to do some advanced work in a
subject. The major department system
has shown at Stanford a tendency t.>
crystallize, to become inelastic. It
must be more compressible here, moro
expansile there, if it is to meet the
changing requirements of the time. Its
best feature, the opportunity of the ex
pert to advise and assist the student
in planning bis own education, has
been sadly neglected in some depart
ments. It is in danger of falling of its
own weight in many particulars unless
those who manage it become more in
, terested in its application and more
liberal in their interpretation of it and
lend themselves readily to that coop
oration which is necessary to the needs
of new types of training required for
special work, special research, voca
tional preparation, some modification
must be found that will stand for
effectiveness and be elastic enough to
meet individual requirements and new
needs.
With proper coordination of the ex
isting departments, with the elimina

tioa of courses that practically dupli
cate others, with a consistent main
tenance of high standards of scholar
ship there is every reason to believe
that the University has sufficient re
sources available to make the brand
of Stanford upon a scholar, be he
chemist, philologist, or historian, upon
a teacher, engineer, physician, lawyer,
or journalist, mean thorough training,
and we hope superior merit.
Stanford's Resources.
We have a large endowment, a Hoard
of Trustees made up of unselfish men,
deeply interested in every phase of the
University's welfare, a splendid Facul
ty, a loyal group of Alumni, a fine stu
dent body, beautiful buildings, and a
healthful, inspiring environment. Our
country is new, very new\ Here in
California the product of the mingled
races of the Occidental world meet on
the ever nearer border of the Orient.
Who can forsee what this will mean in
moral, mental, and spiritual develop
ment. A great intellectual and artistic
future seems to open before us. Let
us here at Stanford welcome it, freeing
ourselves as heretofore from the tyran
ny of precedent, of the past, except in
so far as the past has shown the right
principles of conduct and has discover
ed facts. Let us be conservative 'n
holding to that which is good and true
and essential, and above all to justice,
but radical in our willingness to re
ceive and understand the new while
' discarding promptly the trivial and the
transient. We can be free to give that
legitimate scope to active minds essen
tial in order to make a university. It
' is largely a matter of men —of men of
character, of men whose trained men
tal processes permit them a wide
j range. It is a great privilege to be
a part of such a real University, either
'as a student, teacher or trustee. One
of the great features of such a Univer
sity must be loyalty. I want to say to
the Trustees, Faculty, and Alumni that
in this period when these young people
are entrusted to use we must not for
get to teach them something of the
growth and history of our own coun
try, of the principles leading its early
founders to begin on this continent
' new forms of democratic government.
They must be taught their deep re
responsibility as citizens and as guard
ians of those human rights, won after
!so many bitter contests. Without a
' proper safeguarding of those rights,
I without abiding loyalty and love of
I country, we may find that all else is
dross, because the essentials of con
trol are in the hands of those not sym
pathetic with the beautiful and in
i spiring ideals of our country.
>1 iittial Responsibility.
We must all tlie.n together stand
ready to do our utmost to defend and
to develop our institutions and our
country. Upon us, with the advan
, tages of university associations, falls
a full measure of responsibility. An
! education which brings with it
i dilettantism is as empty as a decorated
; egg shell. Education should be from
tlie heart outwards, should strengthen
the foundations of. character, enhance
the spirit of helpfulness, the desire to
be worth while in the days, be they
few or many, that lie before us. Edu
cation should make us loyal—loyal co
our University, to our country, above
all to truth.
Let us here at Stanford, Trustees,
Faculty, Alumni, and students, to
gether do our best as unselfish citi
zens to develop a university of serv
ice, of citizenship in its broadest sense,
of character—a place where truth is
paramount. In a word, a university
I of quality and of usefulness.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, in accepting the presidency of Stanford, outlined
to some extent his policy for the future development of the university and
dwelt on his hdpes and ambitions that the institution of which he is an
alumnus may not only continue its present noble work, but become of greater
service to individuals and the world at large, llis address follows:
Men and Women of Stanford:
This day brings me a great responsibility, honor, and the hope that I may

name of Stanford upon those who are
unworthy?
Legacy of Founders.
Our founders pondered long over the
various ways they might be of the
most service to the students of Stan
ford. Mrs. Stanford saw the. need for
some form of religion, felt the en
nobling effect of high example and
high precept. She built this splendid
church, made it free from the man
made creed and varieties of religion,
but devoted it to the best that is in
us, to the highest hopes and yearnings
of life, to that Power which means
something different to each one of us,
but stands with all of us for faith,
hope and charity—for that which is
pure, ennobling, self-denying, loving.
We must be deeply thankful to Mrs.
Stanford for this, her watchful care
and solicitude, and we must help t.)
foster those influences so cherished by
her. Let each man choose his own
method of worship, but we can here
give our students the chance to hear
the words of those who seek to inter
pret the religious thought and teach
ing of the day or to guide us in the
ethical aspects of human conduct.
Part <>t' Alumni.
The Alumni of Stanford are now
becoming fully grown. They will mean
much more each year than ever before.
The mirror to the outside world the
effects of their training. In them and
in their acts are seen the results of
the University's work. Theirs is the
responsibility of the older brother for
the younger, so far as the student is

concerned, and of the independent son
to the parent, so far as the Faculty
is concerned. They must give their
confidence and support to the Faculty.
The Faculty is ever changing and
should be fully up to date. The Alumni
are almost sure to reflect their own
period of training and the ideals of
their own student days. It is perhaps
because of this that many institutions
complain of a hampering influence ex
erted upon the universities by various
alumni, of abnormal athletic stimula
tion, and other abuses. Stanford has
been most forutnate in its Alumni.
Many of them kept in close touch with
the growth and changes in the Uni
versity. If the Alumni will keep fully
informed, if they will use the Presi
dent, if need be, to help them to get
the facts, 1 am sure that Stanford will
go far in the generation to come. I
count on the assistance of the Alumni
at every step.
Intensify Development.
Stanford has won a well established
place among universities. Its growth
having almost reached the limit of its
present endowment, it is necessary to
choose its work and develop thorough
ly its chosen fields in order to retain
its present elements of strength. The
first step is to limit the number of
those to be received as students. The
next step must be to ascertain by carc
ful study how by cooperation and mu
tual interest we can get the most out
of the University's income, give most
to the students, and do the most crea
tive work. We must decide in how
far we are justified in teaching sub
jects equally well taught in dozens of
other places. We must confine our
elementary work to subjects that lead
somewhere. One of our strongest fea
tures is that in certain professional
departments careful supervision of the
work of an entering student is possible
from the freshman year onward. With
the establishment of a maximum num
ber for students it is inevitable that
more and more advanced students will
be received and a higher average grade
of work done. This will mean less
elementary work of a general type, but
it need not interfere with the Univer
sity's handling such work where it
can be done better than in the second
ary schools. The great development
of these schools will soon free us
from the necessity of handling many
preparatory studies. Where in the
University elementary work is not
carefully supervised and at least in
part handled by the full professor, the
master, it is apt to be given less well
than by those in a secondary school
devoting their life to teach certain sub
jects. Too much beginning work is
done in Universities either as a chore
or by advanced students, earnest but
lacking that breadth of view essential
in teaching the elements of any sub
ject.
Value of Major Department.
There is great value in the major
department system. It is a splendid
thing to learn to do at least one thing
well, to do some advanced work in a
subject. The major department system
has shown at Stanford a tendency t.>
crystallize, to become inelastic. It
must be more compressible here, moro
expansile there, if it is to meet the
changing requirements of the time. Its
best feature, the opportunity of the ex
pert to advise and assist the student
in planning bis own education, has
been sadly neglected in some depart
ments. It is in danger of falling of its
own weight in many particulars unless
those who manage it become more in
, terested in its application and more
liberal in their interpretation of it and
lend themselves readily to that coop
oration which is necessary to the needs
of new types of training required for
special work, special research, voca
tional preparation, some modification
must be found that will stand for
effectiveness and be elastic enough to
meet individual requirements and new
needs.
With proper coordination of the ex
isting departments, with the elimina

tioa of courses that practically dupli
cate others, with a consistent main
tenance of high standards of scholar
ship there is every reason to believe
that the University has sufficient re
sources available to make the brand
of Stanford upon a scholar, be he
chemist, philologist, or historian, upon
a teacher, engineer, physician, lawyer,
or journalist, mean thorough training,
and we hope superior merit.
Stanford's Resources.
We have a large endowment, a Hoard
of Trustees made up of unselfish men,
deeply interested in every phase of the
University's welfare, a splendid Facul
ty, a loyal group of Alumni, a fine stu
dent body, beautiful buildings, and a
healthful, inspiring environment. Our
country is new, very new\ Here in
California the product of the mingled
races of the Occidental world meet on
the ever nearer border of the Orient.
Who can forsee what this will mean in
moral, mental, and spiritual develop
ment. A great intellectual and artistic
future seems to open before us. Let
us here at Stanford welcome it, freeing
ourselves as heretofore from the tyran
ny of precedent, of the past, except in
so far as the past has shown the right
principles of conduct and has discover
ed facts. Let us be conservative 'n
holding to that which is good and true
and essential, and above all to justice,
but radical in our willingness to re
ceive and understand the new while
' discarding promptly the trivial and the
transient. We can be free to give that
legitimate scope to active minds essen
tial in order to make a university. It
' is largely a matter of men —of men of
character, of men whose trained men
tal processes permit them a wide
j range. It is a great privilege to be
a part of such a real University, either
'as a student, teacher or trustee. One
of the great features of such a Univer
sity must be loyalty. I want to say to
the Trustees, Faculty, and Alumni that
in this period when these young people
are entrusted to use we must not for
get to teach them something of the
growth and history of our own coun
try, of the principles leading its early
founders to begin on this continent
' new forms of democratic government.
They must be taught their deep re
responsibility as citizens and as guard
ians of those human rights, won after
!so many bitter contests. Without a
' proper safeguarding of those rights,
I without abiding loyalty and love of
I country, we may find that all else is
dross, because the essentials of con
trol are in the hands of those not sym
pathetic with the beautiful and in
i spiring ideals of our country.
>1 iittial Responsibility.
We must all tlie.n together stand
ready to do our utmost to defend and
to develop our institutions and our
country. Upon us, with the advan
, tages of university associations, falls
a full measure of responsibility. An
! education which brings with it
i dilettantism is as empty as a decorated
; egg shell. Education should be from
tlie heart outwards, should strengthen
the foundations of. character, enhance
the spirit of helpfulness, the desire to
be worth while in the days, be they
few or many, that lie before us. Edu
cation should make us loyal—loyal co
our University, to our country, above
all to truth.
Let us here at Stanford, Trustees,
Faculty, Alumni, and students, to
gether do our best as unselfish citi
zens to develop a university of serv
ice, of citizenship in its broadest sense,
of character—a place where truth is
paramount. In a word, a university
I of quality and of usefulness.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, in accepting the presidency of Stanford, outlined
to some extent his policy for the future development of the university and
dwelt on his hdpes and ambitions that the institution of which he is an
alumnus may not only continue its present noble work, but become of greater
service to individuals and the world at large, llis address follows:
Men and Women of Stanford:
This day brings me a great responsibility, honor, and the hope that I may
prove worthy of the position of President and merit the many kind words that
have been said to me and of me by Stanford men. I accept the responsibility,
am grateful for the honor, and will strive with all that is in
Proud to be me to measure up to the work betore me. i have tried to

understand why many of my old friends seem to take the
choice as a natural one. I take pride in believing that it is because I am con
sidered a typical Stanford man, familiar with this I'niversity and what it has
stood for. I came here as a boy twenty-three years ago, and my thoughts go
back to those early days.
The hazy, idealistic dreams of boyhood are hard to define, difficult to

realize, and usually merge into tho maze of emotions and experiences that
make up lite as we meet it from day to day.

1 eginniug, its new president—all appealed to me. and in spite of other sug
gestions, there was never a doul t in my mind as to where I would go to pro
pare for medicine.
The charm of those early days has never leftme. The freedom, the whole
some, unconventional ways, the personal association with enthusiastic teach-


President Haj Lynum Wilbur
ers, the absence of traditions, the presence of both Senator and Mrs. Stanford,
the beautiful buildings, the University's surroundings, all conspired to foster
in me a deep love for Stanford. My associates had with me the privilege of
working under that rare group of men of character and learning, Imbued with
the spirit of the Argonauts, that had been gathered from many quarters by a
young and forceful president. To a degree in their very origin and training
they typified the West, as we know it —a composite of the best, the most virile,
the most venturesome spirits front all parts of a new and noble land. It is 110
wonder there was a swing, a force to those early years that we can .hardly
hope to see duplicated. It did much to engender that loyalty and faith that
have carried Stanford University triumphantly through the death of its Found
ers, the great government law suit, the lean years of building, and the destruc
tion wrought by the earthquake.

My own growth has been alongside
that of Stanford; my heart has been
with it through all of its years. Now,
as one of its sons, to be designated as
its leader is one of those sacred re
sponsibilities that can only be under
taken with a spirit of humility
panied by a firm endeavor to do one's
best. Looking back to my first years,
and thinking again of the place given
by me to Dr. Jordan as a man and as
an ideal, I feel the great responsibilty
upon me as intensified. It is to the
young men and young women of Stan
ford that are coming bore now, as wo
alumni did at the beginning, that i
propose to devote my life. 1 see in
them boys and girls like my class
mates. To them and to those who
follow them did Senator and Mrs.
Stanford devote their fortune, their
best efforts, their love. To these stud
ents. we of the faculty look to carry
on our work when we lay it down, to
represent our best thoughts, to fulfill
our hopes. To this end are they here.
To this end have they been taken out
of the ordinary current of life to spend
a few years with us.
Stai 11 ford's Task.
What is there in a University that
it should have such a chance, such a
responsibility? It seems to me that
there is 110 worthier task, with broader
possible scope, with higher human
possibilities, than that offered by the
University. It should be the seat, of
the greatest aspirations of the human
mind. Its very breath should be that
of catholicity, of idealism, and above
all, truth. Trivialities, prejudice, nar
rowness, should have no place. An
inculcation of the love of truth, of the
joy of seeking truth, should be its
main duty. Not a mere seeking after
abstract truth, but after a knowledge
of life, of life processes, human rela
tionships, such as will lead to knowl
edge of nature's laws and a desire to
conform to them, to be useful, to be of
service, and to serve the truth. The
University should not be something
apart from the life of the world about
it. It. should break down barriers that
tradition or ignorance have built up,
and it should stand out in a master
ful relationship with all worthy en
deavors. setting standards, stimulating
progress.
Democrat*} of Intellect.
The University is necessarily a part
of the educational system. It must
be jealous of its prerogatives; it re
quires some form of certification for
work previously done in order that it
may devote its energies to real Uni
versity work, and must give proper
credit to those who complete (he var
ious stages of its curriculum. It must
have high standards to prevent waste
of its time on the incompetent, the
idler, and the trifier. Nevertheless, we
must not take our University degrees
too seriously. A Bachelor of Arts
from the University of "Hard Knocks"
may mean power, courage, manhood,
development, while an A. B. from an
actual University too often means that
some one else has paid the bills for a
period of genteel idling, social fol-de
rol, and a minimum of honest en
deavor. It is important to realize that
(lie University should be a place for
democracy of the intellect and that 't
should keep open door for those cap

able of using its facilities, for those
who aspire to learn, to lead, to be use
ful—those who have high aspirations.
Snobbishness, superiority, patronizing
of the less fortunate, should be im
possible The University professor
should be looked upon as a highly de
veloped, useful citizen; not as some
thing apart, imponderable, cloud
scraping. The type of education so
popular in the past, so eminently im
practical, except in the general train
ing it gave, has done much to cultivate
an abnormal view of the University
and its chief exponent, the professor.
Now human knowledge is so wide
spread, so useful, so essential in busi
ness, trade, commerce, and the pro
fessions, we must insist that the Uni
versity take its rightful place in
human affairs and be rightly evaluated
by those both without and within.
Kccriiitiiig Ground for Youth.
To the universities, their teachers,
| their research workers, must we look
for the solution of many great social
j problems, and for the control of those
unnecessary diseases that, devour the
! very marrow of the race. To the uni
-1
versities must we turn for facts in
! order that we may face with open
; oyes the world as it is and strive to
make it the world that it should be.
The universites must lead in the fight
| against oppression, evil, ignorance,
filth. We cannot be neutral in these
! struggles. We must be positive forces,
making the University the recruiting
ground for youth, arming them for
the big tasks of the race.
.Hake HOOlll for the New.
Stanford has already done much
'along this line. We can do much
more. We can stand for the things
we choose to stand for and should
! elect to do well what we select to do.
Stanford, to be a real university, must
keep an atmosphere favorable to re
search. to new ideas, to thinkers of
all sorts. Merely to retail acquired
I book knowledge to successive groups
of students would be a sorry life for
i a real University man. He must add
something new, must study old prob
lems in new ways, ever be thinking,
[ studying. As a University worker he
must know the solutions of the past
i and yet stand 011 the edge of that great
I field of the unknown > that is still dark.
Each year should see light let in,
fresh conquests made, definite steps
forward. The wonderful, immutable
laws of nature, when once ascertained,
are dependable, and give us new power
in making life sweeter, more effective,
safer.
The desire to learn new things must
J lie in the air. Merely to set up baubles
to encourage scholarship and research
| may be expedient, but we cannot ex
pect a man who considers these as
worth much, or at least, as goals at
tained, to go far along the plodding
road of new thought or new discovery.
No I'laee for Stagnation.
There can be 110 place for the men
tally stagnant; no place for those
who fail to grow each year. The Uni-
I versity must be untrammeled in its
right (o riil itself of the incompetent
and indolent among its students and
I the ineffectives and mediocrities in its
j faculty. It cannot hope to lead, to
inspire, if if is weighed down by such
burdens. Indefinite or life term ol
professors is meant to give security
.and scope for wide training, deep
knowledge, profound study, not to pro
vide an easy and permanent resting
place for those who once arrive. We
professors should keep our high re
sponsibilities in mind. We cannot con
form to any one pattern. Some of us
must needs be primarily, teachers;
others, investigators. It will be my
solemn duty to try to see that the
teachers of Stanford in the future
reach that same high quality of char
acter and scholarship that makes the
University of today. I must, with the
help of my associates, protect the
future students of Stanford and try
to see that they come in contact with
real men and real minds. T hope and
trust that the Faculty will use me to
protect them in their work, to assume
as far as possible administrative du
ties that interfere with their devotion
to the special work before them.
A Foster Parent.
The University occupies the position,
no matter how hard it may try at
times to avoid it, of foster parent to
the youths who come to it. We look
upon the family and its purity as the
greatest influence upon our boys and
girls. Environment means so much.
We must keep the University environ
ment clean; we must keep our stu
dents exposed to men of high charac
ter and scholarly attainments. There
must be an atmosphere favorable to
healthful lives, physical exercise, clean
minds, and clean bodies. The gospel
of work should need no particular
advocacy in a University whose object
is "to qualify its students for personal
success and direct usefulness in life."
Maintain a Standard. *
There is now a well understood and
accepted standard of Stanford life. \t
is in the hands of the students to see
whether they will maintain it at a
high level —whether they will demon
strate that student self-government
makes for character building. Why
not reserve Stanford for men and
women with a purpose high enough to
putin their proper place the distract
ions of University life that can be of
great service if not over-done? Why not
keep Stanford free from the curse of
luxury, of aimlessness, of mere money
spending? Why not free ourselves
promptly from those who early demon
strate that they have not the instincts
of the true man or woman, so that we
will not run the risk of placing the
name of Stanford upon those who are
unworthy?

Our founders pondered long over the

ers, the absence of traditions, the presence of both Senator and Mrs. Stanford,
the beautiful buildings, the University's surroundings, all conspired to foster
in me a deep love for Stanford. My associates had with me the privilege of
working under that rare group of men of character and learning, Imbued with
the spirit of the Argonauts, that had been gathered from many quarters by a
young and forceful president. To a degree in their very origin and training
they typified the West, as we know it —a composite of the best, the most virile,
the most venturesome spirits front all parts of a new and noble land. It is 110
wonder there was a swing, a force to those early years that we can .hardly
hope to see duplicated. It did much to engender that loyalty and faith that
have carried Stanford University triumphantly through the death of its Found
ers, the great government law suit, the lean years of building, and the destruc
tion wrought by the earthquake.

My own growth has been alongside
that of Stanford; my heart has been
with it through all of its years. Now,
as one of its sons, to be designated as
its leader is one of those sacred re
sponsibilities that can only be under
taken with a spirit of humility
panied by a firm endeavor to do one's
best. Looking back to my first years,
and thinking again of the place given
by me to Dr. Jordan as a man and as
an ideal, I feel the great responsibilty
upon me as intensified. It is to the
young men and young women of Stan
ford that are coming bore now, as wo
alumni did at the beginning, that i
propose to devote my life. 1 see in
them boys and girls like my class
mates. To them and to those who
follow them did Senator and Mrs.
Stanford devote their fortune, their
best efforts, their love. To these stud
ents. we of the faculty look to carry
on our work when we lay it down, to
represent our best thoughts, to fulfill
our hopes. To this end are they here.
To this end have they been taken out
of the ordinary current of life to spend
a few years with us.
Stai 11 ford's Task.
What is there in a University that
it should have such a chance, such a
responsibility? It seems to me that
there is 110 worthier task, with broader
possible scope, with higher human
possibilities, than that offered by the
University. It should be the seat, of
the greatest aspirations of the human
mind. Its very breath should be that
of catholicity, of idealism, and above
all, truth. Trivialities, prejudice, nar
rowness, should have no place. An
inculcation of the love of truth, of the
joy of seeking truth, should be its
main duty. Not a mere seeking after
abstract truth, but after a knowledge
of life, of life processes, human rela
tionships, such as will lead to knowl
edge of nature's laws and a desire to
conform to them, to be useful, to be of
service, and to serve the truth. The
University should not be something
apart from the life of the world about
it. It. should break down barriers that
tradition or ignorance have built up,
and it should stand out in a master
ful relationship with all worthy en
deavors. setting standards, stimulating
progress.
Democrat*} of Intellect.
The University is necessarily a part
of the educational system. It must
be jealous of its prerogatives; it re
quires some form of certification for
work previously done in order that it
may devote its energies to real Uni
versity work, and must give proper
credit to those who complete (he var
ious stages of its curriculum. It must
have high standards to prevent waste
of its time on the incompetent, the
idler, and the trifier. Nevertheless, we
must not take our University degrees
too seriously. A Bachelor of Arts
from the University of "Hard Knocks"
may mean power, courage, manhood,
development, while an A. B. from an
actual University too often means that
some one else has paid the bills for a
period of genteel idling, social fol-de
rol, and a minimum of honest en
deavor. It is important to realize that
(lie University should be a place for
democracy of the intellect and that 't
should keep open door for those cap

able of using its facilities, for those
who aspire to learn, to lead, to be use
ful—those who have high aspirations.
Snobbishness, superiority, patronizing
of the less fortunate, should be im
possible The University professor
should be looked upon as a highly de
veloped, useful citizen; not as some
thing apart, imponderable, cloud
scraping. The type of education so
popular in the past, so eminently im
practical, except in the general train
ing it gave, has done much to cultivate
an abnormal view of the University
and its chief exponent, the professor.
Now human knowledge is so wide
spread, so useful, so essential in busi
ness, trade, commerce, and the pro
fessions, we must insist that the Uni
versity take its rightful place in
human affairs and be rightly evaluated
by those both without and within.
Kccriiitiiig Ground for Youth.
To the universities, their teachers,
| their research workers, must we look
for the solution of many great social
j problems, and for the control of those
unnecessary diseases that, devour the
! very marrow of the race. To the uni
-1
versities must we turn for facts in
! order that we may face with open
; oyes the world as it is and strive to
make it the world that it should be.
The universites must lead in the fight
| against oppression, evil, ignorance,
filth. We cannot be neutral in these
! struggles. We must be positive forces,
making the University the recruiting
ground for youth, arming them for
the big tasks of the race.
.Hake HOOlll for the New.
Stanford has already done much
'along this line. We can do much
more. We can stand for the things
we choose to stand for and should
! elect to do well what we select to do.
Stanford, to be a real university, must
keep an atmosphere favorable to re
search. to new ideas, to thinkers of
all sorts. Merely to retail acquired
I book knowledge to successive groups
of students would be a sorry life for
i a real University man. He must add
something new, must study old prob
lems in new ways, ever be thinking,
[ studying. As a University worker he
must know the solutions of the past
i and yet stand 011 the edge of that great
I field of the unknown > that is still dark.
Each year should see light let in,
fresh conquests made, definite steps
forward. The wonderful, immutable
laws of nature, when once ascertained,
are dependable, and give us new power
in making life sweeter, more effective,
safer.
The desire to learn new things must
J lie in the air. Merely to set up baubles
to encourage scholarship and research
| may be expedient, but we cannot ex
pect a man who considers these as
worth much, or at least, as goals at
tained, to go far along the plodding
road of new thought or new discovery.
No I'laee for Stagnation.
There can be 110 place for the men
tally stagnant; no place for those
who fail to grow each year. The Uni-
I versity must be untrammeled in its
right (o riil itself of the incompetent
and indolent among its students and
I the ineffectives and mediocrities in its
j faculty. It cannot hope to lead, to
inspire, if if is weighed down by such
burdens. Indefinite or life term ol
professors is meant to give security
.and scope for wide training, deep
knowledge, profound study, not to pro
vide an easy and permanent resting
place for those who once arrive. We
professors should keep our high re
sponsibilities in mind. We cannot con
form to any one pattern. Some of us
must needs be primarily, teachers;
others, investigators. It will be my
solemn duty to try to see that the
teachers of Stanford in the future
reach that same high quality of char
acter and scholarship that makes the
University of today. I must, with the
help of my associates, protect the
future students of Stanford and try
to see that they come in contact with
real men and real minds. T hope and
trust that the Faculty will use me to
protect them in their work, to assume
as far as possible administrative du
ties that interfere with their devotion
to the special work before them.
A Foster Parent.
The University occupies the position,
no matter how hard it may try at
times to avoid it, of foster parent to
the youths who come to it. We look
upon the family and its purity as the
greatest influence upon our boys and
girls. Environment means so much.
We must keep the University environ
ment clean; we must keep our stu
dents exposed to men of high charac
ter and scholarly attainments. There
must be an atmosphere favorable to
healthful lives, physical exercise, clean
minds, and clean bodies. The gospel
of work should need no particular
advocacy in a University whose object
is "to qualify its students for personal
success and direct usefulness in life."
Maintain a Standard. *
There is now a well understood and
accepted standard of Stanford life. \t
is in the hands of the students to see
whether they will maintain it at a
high level —whether they will demon
strate that student self-government
makes for character building. Why
not reserve Stanford for men and
women with a purpose high enough to
putin their proper place the distract
ions of University life that can be of
great service if not over-done? Why not
keep Stanford free from the curse of
luxury, of aimlessness, of mere money
spending? Why not free ourselves
promptly from those who early demon
strate that they have not the instincts
of the true man or woman, so that we
will not run the risk of placing the
name of Stanford upon those who are
unworthy?
Legacy of Founders.
Our founders pondered long over the
various ways they might be of the
most service to the students of Stan
ford. Mrs. Stanford saw the. need for
some form of religion, felt the en
nobling effect of high example and
high precept. She built this splendid
church, made it free from the man
made creed and varieties of religion,
but devoted it to the best that is in
us, to the highest hopes and yearnings
of life, to that Power which means
something different to each one of us,
but stands with all of us for faith,
hope and charity—for that which is
pure, ennobling, self-denying, loving.
We must be deeply thankful to Mrs.
Stanford for this, her watchful care
and solicitude, and we must help t.)
foster those influences so cherished by
her. Let each man choose his own
method of worship, but we can here
give our students the chance to hear
the words of those who seek to inter
pret the religious thought and teach
ing of the day or to guide us in the
ethical aspects of human conduct.
Part <>t' Alumni.
The Alumni of Stanford are now
becoming fully grown. They will mean
much more each year than ever before.
The mirror to the outside world the
effects of their training. In them and
in their acts are seen the results of
the University's work. Theirs is the
responsibility of the older brother for
the younger, so far as the student is

concerned, and of the independent son
to the parent, so far as the Faculty
is concerned. They must give their
confidence and support to the Faculty.
The Faculty is ever changing and
should be fully up to date. The Alumni
are almost sure to reflect their own
period of training and the ideals of
their own student days. It is perhaps
because of this that many institutions
complain of a hampering influence ex
erted upon the universities by various
alumni, of abnormal athletic stimula
tion, and other abuses. Stanford has
been most forutnate in its Alumni.
Many of them kept in close touch with
the growth and changes in the Uni
versity. If the Alumni will keep fully
informed, if they will use the Presi
dent, if need be, to help them to get
the facts, 1 am sure that Stanford will
go far in the generation to come. I
count on the assistance of the Alumni
at every step.
Intensify Development.
Stanford has won a well established
place among universities. Its growth
having almost reached the limit of its
present endowment, it is necessary to
choose its work and develop thorough
ly its chosen fields in order to retain
its present elements of strength. The
first step is to limit the number of
those to be received as students. The
next step must be to ascertain by carc
ful study how by cooperation and mu
tual interest we can get the most out
of the University's income, give most
to the students, and do the most crea
tive work. We must decide in how
far we are justified in teaching sub
jects equally well taught in dozens of
other places. We must confine our
elementary work to subjects that lead
somewhere. One of our strongest fea
tures is that in certain professional
departments careful supervision of the
work of an entering student is possible
from the freshman year onward. With
the establishment of a maximum num
ber for students it is inevitable that
more and more advanced students will
be received and a higher average grade
of work done. This will mean less
elementary work of a general type, but
it need not interfere with the Univer
sity's handling such work where it
can be done better than in the second
ary schools. The great development
of these schools will soon free us
from the necessity of handling many
preparatory studies. Where in the
University elementary work is not
carefully supervised and at least in
part handled by the full professor, the
master, it is apt to be given less well
than by those in a secondary school
devoting their life to teach certain sub
jects. Too much beginning work is
done in Universities either as a chore
or by advanced students, earnest but
lacking that breadth of view essential
in teaching the elements of any sub
ject.
Value of Major Department.
There is great value in the major
department system. It is a splendid
thing to learn to do at least one thing
well, to do some advanced work in a
subject. The major department system
has shown at Stanford a tendency t.>
crystallize, to become inelastic. It
must be more compressible here, moro
expansile there, if it is to meet the
changing requirements of the time. Its
best feature, the opportunity of the ex
pert to advise and assist the student
in planning bis own education, has
been sadly neglected in some depart
ments. It is in danger of falling of its
own weight in many particulars unless
those who manage it become more in
, terested in its application and more
liberal in their interpretation of it and
lend themselves readily to that coop
oration which is necessary to the needs
of new types of training required for
special work, special research, voca
tional preparation, some modification
must be found that will stand for
effectiveness and be elastic enough to
meet individual requirements and new
needs.
With proper coordination of the ex
isting departments, with the elimina

tioa of courses that practically dupli
cate others, with a consistent main
tenance of high standards of scholar
ship there is every reason to believe
that the University has sufficient re
sources available to make the brand
of Stanford upon a scholar, be he
chemist, philologist, or historian, upon
a teacher, engineer, physician, lawyer,
or journalist, mean thorough training,
and we hope superior merit.
Stanford's Resources.
We have a large endowment, a Hoard
of Trustees made up of unselfish men,
deeply interested in every phase of the
University's welfare, a splendid Facul
ty, a loyal group of Alumni, a fine stu
dent body, beautiful buildings, and a
healthful, inspiring environment. Our
country is new, very new\ Here in
California the product of the mingled
races of the Occidental world meet on
the ever nearer border of the Orient.
Who can forsee what this will mean in
moral, mental, and spiritual develop
ment. A great intellectual and artistic
future seems to open before us. Let
us here at Stanford welcome it, freeing
ourselves as heretofore from the tyran
ny of precedent, of the past, except in
so far as the past has shown the right
principles of conduct and has discover
ed facts. Let us be conservative 'n
holding to that which is good and true
and essential, and above all to justice,
but radical in our willingness to re
ceive and understand the new while
' discarding promptly the trivial and the
transient. We can be free to give that
legitimate scope to active minds essen
tial in order to make a university. It
' is largely a matter of men —of men of
character, of men whose trained men
tal processes permit them a wide
j range. It is a great privilege to be
a part of such a real University, either
'as a student, teacher or trustee. One
of the great features of such a Univer
sity must be loyalty. I want to say to
the Trustees, Faculty, and Alumni that
in this period when these young people
are entrusted to use we must not for
get to teach them something of the
growth and history of our own coun
try, of the principles leading its early
founders to begin on this continent
' new forms of democratic government.
They must be taught their deep re
responsibility as citizens and as guard
ians of those human rights, won after
!so many bitter contests. Without a
' proper safeguarding of those rights,
I without abiding loyalty and love of
I country, we may find that all else is
dross, because the essentials of con
trol are in the hands of those not sym
pathetic with the beautiful and in
i spiring ideals of our country.
>1 iittial Responsibility.
We must all tlie.n together stand
ready to do our utmost to defend and
to develop our institutions and our
country. Upon us, with the advan
, tages of university associations, falls
a full measure of responsibility. An
! education which brings with it
i dilettantism is as empty as a decorated
; egg shell. Education should be from
tlie heart outwards, should strengthen
the foundations of. character, enhance
the spirit of helpfulness, the desire to
be worth while in the days, be they
few or many, that lie before us. Edu
cation should make us loyal—loyal co
our University, to our country, above
all to truth.
Let us here at Stanford, Trustees,
Faculty, Alumni, and students, to
gether do our best as unselfish citi
zens to develop a university of serv
ice, of citizenship in its broadest sense,
of character—a place where truth is
paramount. In a word, a university
I of quality and of usefulness.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, in accepting the presidency of Stanford, outlined
to some extent his policy for the future development of the university and
dwelt on his hdpes and ambitions that the institution of which he is an
alumnus may not only continue its present noble work, but become of greater
service to individuals and the world at large, llis address follows:

Part <>t' Alumni.
The Alumni of Stanford are now
becoming fully grown. They will mean
much more each year than ever before.
The mirror to the outside world the
effects of their training. In them and
in their acts are seen the results of
the University's work. Theirs is the
responsibility of the older brother for
the younger, so far as the student is

concerned, and of the independent son
to the parent, so far as the Faculty
is concerned. They must give their
confidence and support to the Faculty.
The Faculty is ever changing and
should be fully up to date. The Alumni
are almost sure to reflect their own
period of training and the ideals of
their own student days. It is perhaps
because of this that many institutions
complain of a hampering influence ex
erted upon the universities by various
alumni, of abnormal athletic stimula
tion, and other abuses. Stanford has
been most forutnate in its Alumni.
Many of them kept in close touch with
the growth and changes in the Uni
versity. If the Alumni will keep fully
informed, if they will use the Presi
dent, if need be, to help them to get
the facts, 1 am sure that Stanford will
go far in the generation to come. I
count on the assistance of the Alumni
at every step.
Intensify Development.
Stanford has won a well established
place among universities. Its growth
having almost reached the limit of its
present endowment, it is necessary to
choose its work and develop thorough
ly its chosen fields in order to retain
its present elements of strength. The
first step is to limit the number of
those to be received as students. The
next step must be to ascertain by carc
ful study how by cooperation and mu
tual interest we can get the most out
of the University's income, give most
to the students, and do the most crea
tive work. We must decide in how
far we are justified in teaching sub
jects equally well taught in dozens of
other places. We must confine our
elementary work to subjects that lead
somewhere. One of our strongest fea
tures is that in certain professional
departments careful supervision of the
work of an entering student is possible
from the freshman year onward. With
the establishment of a maximum num
ber for students it is inevitable that
more and more advanced students will
be received and a higher average grade
of work done. This will mean less
elementary work of a general type, but
it need not interfere with the Univer
sity's handling such work where it
can be done better than in the second
ary schools. The great development
of these schools will soon free us
from the necessity of handling many
preparatory studies. Where in the
University elementary work is not
carefully supervised and at least in
part handled by the full professor, the
master, it is apt to be given less well
than by those in a secondary school
devoting their life to teach certain sub
jects. Too much beginning work is
done in Universities either as a chore
or by advanced students, earnest but
lacking that breadth of view essential
in teaching the elements of any sub
ject.
Value of Major Department.
There is great value in the major
department system. It is a splendid
thing to learn to do at least one thing
well, to do some advanced work in a
subject. The major department system
has shown at Stanford a tendency t.>
crystallize, to become inelastic. It
must be more compressible here, moro
expansile there, if it is to meet the
changing requirements of the time. Its
best feature, the opportunity of the ex
pert to advise and assist the student
in planning bis own education, has
been sadly neglected in some depart
ments. It is in danger of falling of its
own weight in many particulars unless
those who manage it become more in
, terested in its application and more
liberal in their interpretation of it and
lend themselves readily to that coop
oration which is necessary to the needs
of new types of training required for
special work, special research, voca
tional preparation, some modification
must be found that will stand for
effectiveness and be elastic enough to
meet individual requirements and new
needs.
With proper coordination of the ex
isting departments, with the elimina

tioa of courses that practically dupli
cate others, with a consistent main
tenance of high standards of scholar
ship there is every reason to believe
that the University has sufficient re
sources available to make the brand
of Stanford upon a scholar, be he
chemist, philologist, or historian, upon
a teacher, engineer, physician, lawyer,
or journalist, mean thorough training,
and we hope superior merit.
Stanford's Resources.
We have a large endowment, a Hoard
of Trustees made up of unselfish men,
deeply interested in every phase of the
University's welfare, a splendid Facul
ty, a loyal group of Alumni, a fine stu
dent body, beautiful buildings, and a
healthful, inspiring environment. Our
country is new, very new\ Here in
California the product of the mingled
races of the Occidental world meet on
the ever nearer border of the Orient.
Who can forsee what this will mean in
moral, mental, and spiritual develop
ment. A great intellectual and artistic
future seems to open before us. Let
us here at Stanford welcome it, freeing
ourselves as heretofore from the tyran
ny of precedent, of the past, except in
so far as the past has shown the right
principles of conduct and has discover
ed facts. Let us be conservative 'n
holding to that which is good and true
and essential, and above all to justice,
but radical in our willingness to re
ceive and understand the new while
' discarding promptly the trivial and the
transient. We can be free to give that
legitimate scope to active minds essen
tial in order to make a university. It
' is largely a matter of men —of men of
character, of men whose trained men
tal processes permit them a wide
j range. It is a great privilege to be
a part of such a real University, either
'as a student, teacher or trustee. One
of the great features of such a Univer
sity must be loyalty. I want to say to
the Trustees, Faculty, and Alumni that
in this period when these young people
are entrusted to use we must not for
get to teach them something of the
growth and history of our own coun
try, of the principles leading its early
founders to begin on this continent
' new forms of democratic government.
They must be taught their deep re
responsibility as citizens and as guard
ians of those human rights, won after
!so many bitter contests. Without a
' proper safeguarding of those rights,
I without abiding loyalty and love of
I country, we may find that all else is
dross, because the essentials of con
trol are in the hands of those not sym
pathetic with the beautiful and in
i spiring ideals of our country.
>1 iittial Responsibility.
We must all tlie.n together stand
ready to do our utmost to defend and
to develop our institutions and our
country. Upon us, with the advan
, tages of university associations, falls
a full measure of responsibility. An
! education which brings with it
i dilettantism is as empty as a decorated
; egg shell. Education should be from
tlie heart outwards, should strengthen
the foundations of. character, enhance
the spirit of helpfulness, the desire to
be worth while in the days, be they
few or many, that lie before us. Edu
cation should make us loyal—loyal co
our University, to our country, above
all to truth.
Let us here at Stanford, Trustees,
Faculty, Alumni, and students, to
gether do our best as unselfish citi
zens to develop a university of serv
ice, of citizenship in its broadest sense,
of character—a place where truth is
paramount. In a word, a university
I of quality and of usefulness.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, in accepting the presidency of Stanford, outlined
to some extent his policy for the future development of the university and
dwelt on his hdpes and ambitions that the institution of which he is an
alumnus may not only continue its present noble work, but become of greater
service to individuals and the world at large, llis address follows:
Men and Women of Stanford:
This day brings me a great responsibility, honor, and the hope that I may
prove worthy of the position of President and merit the many kind words that
have been said to me and of me by Stanford men. I accept the responsibility,
am grateful for the honor, and will strive with all that is in
Proud to be me to measure up to the work betore me. i have tried to

stood for. I came here as a boy twenty-three years ago, and my thoughts go
back to those early days.

1 eginniug, its new president—all appealed to me. and in spite of other sug
gestions, there was never a doul t in my mind as to where I would go to pro
pare for medicine.
The charm of those early days has never leftme. The freedom, the whole
some, unconventional ways, the personal association with enthusiastic teach-


President Haj Lynum Wilbur
ers, the absence of traditions, the presence of both Senator and Mrs. Stanford,
the beautiful buildings, the University's surroundings, all conspired to foster
in me a deep love for Stanford. My associates had with me the privilege of
working under that rare group of men of character and learning, Imbued with
the spirit of the Argonauts, that had been gathered from many quarters by a
young and forceful president. To a degree in their very origin and training
they typified the West, as we know it —a composite of the best, the most virile,
the most venturesome spirits front all parts of a new and noble land. It is 110
wonder there was a swing, a force to those early years that we can .hardly
hope to see duplicated. It did much to engender that loyalty and faith that
have carried Stanford University triumphantly through the death of its Found
ers, the great government law suit, the lean years of building, and the destruc
tion wrought by the earthquake.

My own growth has been alongside
that of Stanford; my heart has been
with it through all of its years. Now,
as one of its sons, to be designated as
its leader is one of those sacred re
sponsibilities that can only be under
taken with a spirit of humility
panied by a firm endeavor to do one's
best. Looking back to my first years,
and thinking again of the place given
by me to Dr. Jordan as a man and as
an ideal, I feel the great responsibilty
upon me as intensified. It is to the
young men and young women of Stan
ford that are coming bore now, as wo
alumni did at the beginning, that i
propose to devote my life. 1 see in
them boys and girls like my class
mates. To them and to those who
follow them did Senator and Mrs.
Stanford devote their fortune, their
best efforts, their love. To these stud
ents. we of the faculty look to carry
on our work when we lay it down, to
represent our best thoughts, to fulfill
our hopes. To this end are they here.
To this end have they been taken out
of the ordinary current of life to spend
a few years with us.
Stai 11 ford's Task.
What is there in a University that
it should have such a chance, such a
responsibility? It seems to me that
there is 110 worthier task, with broader
possible scope, with higher human
possibilities, than that offered by the
University. It should be the seat, of
the greatest aspirations of the human
mind. Its very breath should be that
of catholicity, of idealism, and above
all, truth. Trivialities, prejudice, nar
rowness, should have no place. An
inculcation of the love of truth, of the
joy of seeking truth, should be its
main duty. Not a mere seeking after
abstract truth, but after a knowledge
of life, of life processes, human rela
tionships, such as will lead to knowl
edge of nature's laws and a desire to
conform to them, to be useful, to be of
service, and to serve the truth. The
University should not be something
apart from the life of the world about
it. It. should break down barriers that
tradition or ignorance have built up,
and it should stand out in a master
ful relationship with all worthy en
deavors. setting standards, stimulating
progress.
Democrat*} of Intellect.
The University is necessarily a part
of the educational system. It must
be jealous of its prerogatives; it re
quires some form of certification for
work previously done in order that it
may devote its energies to real Uni
versity work, and must give proper
credit to those who complete (he var
ious stages of its curriculum. It must
have high standards to prevent waste
of its time on the incompetent, the
idler, and the trifier. Nevertheless, we
must not take our University degrees
too seriously. A Bachelor of Arts
from the University of "Hard Knocks"
may mean power, courage, manhood,
development, while an A. B. from an
actual University too often means that
some one else has paid the bills for a
period of genteel idling, social fol-de
rol, and a minimum of honest en
deavor. It is important to realize that
(lie University should be a place for
democracy of the intellect and that 't
should keep open door for those cap

able of using its facilities, for those
who aspire to learn, to lead, to be use
ful—those who have high aspirations.
Snobbishness, superiority, patronizing
of the less fortunate, should be im
possible The University professor
should be looked upon as a highly de
veloped, useful citizen; not as some
thing apart, imponderable, cloud
scraping. The type of education so
popular in the past, so eminently im
practical, except in the general train
ing it gave, has done much to cultivate
an abnormal view of the University
and its chief exponent, the professor.
Now human knowledge is so wide
spread, so useful, so essential in busi
ness, trade, commerce, and the pro
fessions, we must insist that the Uni
versity take its rightful place in
human affairs and be rightly evaluated
by those both without and within.
Kccriiitiiig Ground for Youth.
To the universities, their teachers,
| their research workers, must we look
for the solution of many great social
j problems, and for the control of those
unnecessary diseases that, devour the
! very marrow of the race. To the uni
-1
versities must we turn for facts in
! order that we may face with open
; oyes the world as it is and strive to
make it the world that it should be.
The universites must lead in the fight
| against oppression, evil, ignorance,
filth. We cannot be neutral in these
! struggles. We must be positive forces,
making the University the recruiting
ground for youth, arming them for
the big tasks of the race.
.Hake HOOlll for the New.
Stanford has already done much
'along this line. We can do much
more. We can stand for the things
we choose to stand for and should
! elect to do well what we select to do.
Stanford, to be a real university, must
keep an atmosphere favorable to re
search. to new ideas, to thinkers of
all sorts. Merely to retail acquired
I book knowledge to successive groups
of students would be a sorry life for
i a real University man. He must add
something new, must study old prob
lems in new ways, ever be thinking,
[ studying. As a University worker he
must know the solutions of the past
i and yet stand 011 the edge of that great
I field of the unknown > that is still dark.
Each year should see light let in,
fresh conquests made, definite steps
forward. The wonderful, immutable
laws of nature, when once ascertained,
are dependable, and give us new power
in making life sweeter, more effective,
safer.
The desire to learn new things must
J lie in the air. Merely to set up baubles
to encourage scholarship and research
| may be expedient, but we cannot ex
pect a man who considers these as
worth much, or at least, as goals at
tained, to go far along the plodding
road of new thought or new discovery.
No I'laee for Stagnation.
There can be 110 place for the men
tally stagnant; no place for those
who fail to grow each year. The Uni-
I versity must be untrammeled in its
right (o riil itself of the incompetent
and indolent among its students and
I the ineffectives and mediocrities in its
j faculty. It cannot hope to lead, to
inspire, if if is weighed down by such
burdens. Indefinite or life term ol
professors is meant to give security
.and scope for wide training, deep
knowledge, profound study, not to pro
vide an easy and permanent resting
place for those who once arrive. We
professors should keep our high re
sponsibilities in mind. We cannot con
form to any one pattern. Some of us
must needs be primarily, teachers;
others, investigators. It will be my
solemn duty to try to see that the
teachers of Stanford in the future
reach that same high quality of char
acter and scholarship that makes the
University of today. I must, with the
help of my associates, protect the
future students of Stanford and try
to see that they come in contact with
real men and real minds. T hope and
trust that the Faculty will use me to
protect them in their work, to assume
as far as possible administrative du
ties that interfere with their devotion
to the special work before them.
A Foster Parent.
The University occupies the position,
no matter how hard it may try at
times to avoid it, of foster parent to
the youths who come to it. We look
upon the family and its purity as the
greatest influence upon our boys and
girls. Environment means so much.
We must keep the University environ
ment clean; we must keep our stu
dents exposed to men of high charac
ter and scholarly attainments. There
must be an atmosphere favorable to
healthful lives, physical exercise, clean
minds, and clean bodies. The gospel
of work should need no particular
advocacy in a University whose object
is "to qualify its students for personal
success and direct usefulness in life."
Maintain a Standard. *
There is now a well understood and
accepted standard of Stanford life. \t
is in the hands of the students to see
whether they will maintain it at a
high level —whether they will demon
strate that student self-government
makes for character building. Why
not reserve Stanford for men and
women with a purpose high enough to
putin their proper place the distract
ions of University life that can be of
great service if not over-done? Why not
keep Stanford free from the curse of
luxury, of aimlessness, of mere money
spending? Why not free ourselves
promptly from those who early demon
strate that they have not the instincts
of the true man or woman, so that we
will not run the risk of placing the
name of Stanford upon those who are
unworthy?
Legacy of Founders.
Our founders pondered long over the
various ways they might be of the
most service to the students of Stan
ford. Mrs. Stanford saw the. need for
some form of religion, felt the en
nobling effect of high example and
high precept. She built this splendid
church, made it free from the man
made creed and varieties of religion,
but devoted it to the best that is in
us, to the highest hopes and yearnings
of life, to that Power which means
something different to each one of us,
but stands with all of us for faith,
hope and charity—for that which is
pure, ennobling, self-denying, loving.
We must be deeply thankful to Mrs.
Stanford for this, her watchful care
and solicitude, and we must help t.)
foster those influences so cherished by
her. Let each man choose his own
method of worship, but we can here
give our students the chance to hear
the words of those who seek to inter
pret the religious thought and teach
ing of the day or to guide us in the
ethical aspects of human conduct.

sponsibilities that can only be under
taken with a spirit of humility
panied by a firm endeavor to do one's
best. Looking back to my first years,
and thinking again of the place given
by me to Dr. Jordan as a man and as
an ideal, I feel the great responsibilty
upon me as intensified. It is to the
young men and young women of Stan
ford that are coming bore now, as wo
alumni did at the beginning, that i
propose to devote my life. 1 see in
them boys and girls like my class
mates. To them and to those who
follow them did Senator and Mrs.
Stanford devote their fortune, their
best efforts, their love. To these stud
ents. we of the faculty look to carry
on our work when we lay it down, to
represent our best thoughts, to fulfill
our hopes. To this end are they here.
To this end have they been taken out
of the ordinary current of life to spend
a few years with us.
Stai 11 ford's Task.
What is there in a University that
it should have such a chance, such a
responsibility? It seems to me that
there is 110 worthier task, with broader
possible scope, with higher human
possibilities, than that offered by the
University. It should be the seat, of
the greatest aspirations of the human
mind. Its very breath should be that
of catholicity, of idealism, and above
all, truth. Trivialities, prejudice, nar
rowness, should have no place. An
inculcation of the love of truth, of the
joy of seeking truth, should be its
main duty. Not a mere seeking after
abstract truth, but after a knowledge
of life, of life processes, human rela
tionships, such as will lead to knowl
edge of nature's laws and a desire to
conform to them, to be useful, to be of
service, and to serve the truth. The
University should not be something
apart from the life of the world about
it. It. should break down barriers that
tradition or ignorance have built up,
and it should stand out in a master
ful relationship with all worthy en
deavors. setting standards, stimulating
progress.
Democrat*} of Intellect.
The University is necessarily a part
of the educational system. It must
be jealous of its prerogatives; it re
quires some form of certification for
work previously done in order that it
may devote its energies to real Uni
versity work, and must give proper
credit to those who complete (he var
ious stages of its curriculum. It must
have high standards to prevent waste
of its time on the incompetent, the
idler, and the trifier. Nevertheless, we
must not take our University degrees
too seriously. A Bachelor of Arts
from the University of "Hard Knocks"
may mean power, courage, manhood,
development, while an A. B. from an
actual University too often means that
some one else has paid the bills for a
period of genteel idling, social fol-de
rol, and a minimum of honest en
deavor. It is important to realize that
(lie University should be a place for
democracy of the intellect and that 't
should keep open door for those cap

able of using its facilities, for those
who aspire to learn, to lead, to be use
ful—those who have high aspirations.
Snobbishness, superiority, patronizing
of the less fortunate, should be im
possible The University professor
should be looked upon as a highly de
veloped, useful citizen; not as some
thing apart, imponderable, cloud
scraping. The type of education so
popular in the past, so eminently im
practical, except in the general train
ing it gave, has done much to cultivate
an abnormal view of the University
and its chief exponent, the professor.
Now human knowledge is so wide
spread, so useful, so essential in busi
ness, trade, commerce, and the pro
fessions, we must insist that the Uni
versity take its rightful place in
human affairs and be rightly evaluated
by those both without and within.
Kccriiitiiig Ground for Youth.
To the universities, their teachers,
| their research workers, must we look
for the solution of many great social
j problems, and for the control of those
unnecessary diseases that, devour the
! very marrow of the race. To the uni
-1
versities must we turn for facts in
! order that we may face with open
; oyes the world as it is and strive to
make it the world that it should be.
The universites must lead in the fight
| against oppression, evil, ignorance,
filth. We cannot be neutral in these
! struggles. We must be positive forces,
making the University the recruiting
ground for youth, arming them for
the big tasks of the race.
.Hake HOOlll for the New.
Stanford has already done much
'along this line. We can do much
more. We can stand for the things
we choose to stand for and should
! elect to do well what we select to do.
Stanford, to be a real university, must
keep an atmosphere favorable to re
search. to new ideas, to thinkers of
all sorts. Merely to retail acquired
I book knowledge to successive groups
of students would be a sorry life for
i a real University man. He must add
something new, must study old prob
lems in new ways, ever be thinking,
[ studying. As a University worker he
must know the solutions of the past
i and yet stand 011 the edge of that great
I field of the unknown > that is still dark.
Each year should see light let in,
fresh conquests made, definite steps
forward. The wonderful, immutable
laws of nature, when once ascertained,
are dependable, and give us new power
in making life sweeter, more effective,
safer.
The desire to learn new things must
J lie in the air. Merely to set up baubles
to encourage scholarship and research
| may be expedient, but we cannot ex
pect a man who considers these as
worth much, or at least, as goals at
tained, to go far along the plodding
road of new thought or new discovery.
No I'laee for Stagnation.
There can be 110 place for the men
tally stagnant; no place for those
who fail to grow each year. The Uni-
I versity must be untrammeled in its
right (o riil itself of the incompetent
and indolent among its students and
I the ineffectives and mediocrities in its
j faculty. It cannot hope to lead, to
inspire, if if is weighed down by such
burdens. Indefinite or life term ol
professors is meant to give security
.and scope for wide training, deep
knowledge, profound study, not to pro
vide an easy and permanent resting
place for those who once arrive. We
professors should keep our high re
sponsibilities in mind. We cannot con
form to any one pattern. Some of us
must needs be primarily, teachers;
others, investigators. It will be my
solemn duty to try to see that the
teachers of Stanford in the future
reach that same high quality of char
acter and scholarship that makes the
University of today. I must, with the
help of my associates, protect the
future students of Stanford and try
to see that they come in contact with
real men and real minds. T hope and
trust that the Faculty will use me to
protect them in their work, to assume
as far as possible administrative du
ties that interfere with their devotion
to the special work before them.
A Foster Parent.
The University occupies the position,
no matter how hard it may try at
times to avoid it, of foster parent to
the youths who come to it. We look
upon the family and its purity as the
greatest influence upon our boys and
girls. Environment means so much.
We must keep the University environ
ment clean; we must keep our stu
dents exposed to men of high charac
ter and scholarly attainments. There
must be an atmosphere favorable to
healthful lives, physical exercise, clean
minds, and clean bodies. The gospel
of work should need no particular
advocacy in a University whose object
is "to qualify its students for personal
success and direct usefulness in life."
Maintain a Standard. *
There is now a well understood and
accepted standard of Stanford life. \t
is in the hands of the students to see
whether they will maintain it at a
high level —whether they will demon
strate that student self-government
makes for character building. Why
not reserve Stanford for men and
women with a purpose high enough to
putin their proper place the distract
ions of University life that can be of
great service if not over-done? Why not
keep Stanford free from the curse of
luxury, of aimlessness, of mere money
spending? Why not free ourselves
promptly from those who early demon
strate that they have not the instincts
of the true man or woman, so that we
will not run the risk of placing the
name of Stanford upon those who are
unworthy?
Legacy of Founders.
Our founders pondered long over the
various ways they might be of the
most service to the students of Stan
ford. Mrs. Stanford saw the. need for
some form of religion, felt the en
nobling effect of high example and
high precept. She built this splendid
church, made it free from the man
made creed and varieties of religion,
but devoted it to the best that is in
us, to the highest hopes and yearnings
of life, to that Power which means
something different to each one of us,
but stands with all of us for faith,
hope and charity—for that which is
pure, ennobling, self-denying, loving.
We must be deeply thankful to Mrs.
Stanford for this, her watchful care
and solicitude, and we must help t.)
foster those influences so cherished by
her. Let each man choose his own
method of worship, but we can here
give our students the chance to hear
the words of those who seek to inter
pret the religious thought and teach
ing of the day or to guide us in the
ethical aspects of human conduct.
Part <>t' Alumni.
The Alumni of Stanford are now
becoming fully grown. They will mean
much more each year than ever before.
The mirror to the outside world the
effects of their training. In them and
in their acts are seen the results of
the University's work. Theirs is the
responsibility of the older brother for
the younger, so far as the student is

concerned, and of the independent son
to the parent, so far as the Faculty
is concerned. They must give their
confidence and support to the Faculty.
The Faculty is ever changing and
should be fully up to date. The Alumni
are almost sure to reflect their own
period of training and the ideals of
their own student days. It is perhaps
because of this that many institutions
complain of a hampering influence ex
erted upon the universities by various
alumni, of abnormal athletic stimula
tion, and other abuses. Stanford has
been most forutnate in its Alumni.
Many of them kept in close touch with
the growth and changes in the Uni
versity. If the Alumni will keep fully
informed, if they will use the Presi
dent, if need be, to help them to get
the facts, 1 am sure that Stanford will
go far in the generation to come. I
count on the assistance of the Alumni
at every step.
Intensify Development.
Stanford has won a well established
place among universities. Its growth
having almost reached the limit of its
present endowment, it is necessary to
choose its work and develop thorough
ly its chosen fields in order to retain
its present elements of strength. The
first step is to limit the number of
those to be received as students. The
next step must be to ascertain by carc
ful study how by cooperation and mu
tual interest we can get the most out
of the University's income, give most
to the students, and do the most crea
tive work. We must decide in how
far we are justified in teaching sub
jects equally well taught in dozens of
other places. We must confine our
elementary work to subjects that lead
somewhere. One of our strongest fea
tures is that in certain professional
departments careful supervision of the
work of an entering student is possible
from the freshman year onward. With
the establishment of a maximum num
ber for students it is inevitable that
more and more advanced students will
be received and a higher average grade
of work done. This will mean less
elementary work of a general type, but
it need not interfere with the Univer
sity's handling such work where it
can be done better than in the second
ary schools. The great development
of these schools will soon free us
from the necessity of handling many
preparatory studies. Where in the
University elementary work is not
carefully supervised and at least in
part handled by the full professor, the
master, it is apt to be given less well
than by those in a secondary school
devoting their life to teach certain sub
jects. Too much beginning work is
done in Universities either as a chore
or by advanced students, earnest but
lacking that breadth of view essential
in teaching the elements of any sub
ject.
Value of Major Department.
There is great value in the major
department system. It is a splendid
thing to learn to do at least one thing
well, to do some advanced work in a
subject. The major department system
has shown at Stanford a tendency t.>
crystallize, to become inelastic. It
must be more compressible here, moro
expansile there, if it is to meet the
changing requirements of the time. Its
best feature, the opportunity of the ex
pert to advise and assist the student
in planning bis own education, has
been sadly neglected in some depart
ments. It is in danger of falling of its
own weight in many particulars unless
those who manage it become more in
, terested in its application and more
liberal in their interpretation of it and
lend themselves readily to that coop
oration which is necessary to the needs
of new types of training required for
special work, special research, voca
tional preparation, some modification
must be found that will stand for
effectiveness and be elastic enough to
meet individual requirements and new
needs.
With proper coordination of the ex
isting departments, with the elimina

tioa of courses that practically dupli
cate others, with a consistent main
tenance of high standards of scholar
ship there is every reason to believe
that the University has sufficient re
sources available to make the brand
of Stanford upon a scholar, be he
chemist, philologist, or historian, upon
a teacher, engineer, physician, lawyer,
or journalist, mean thorough training,
and we hope superior merit.
Stanford's Resources.
We have a large endowment, a Hoard
of Trustees made up of unselfish men,
deeply interested in every phase of the
University's welfare, a splendid Facul
ty, a loyal group of Alumni, a fine stu
dent body, beautiful buildings, and a
healthful, inspiring environment. Our
country is new, very new\ Here in
California the product of the mingled
races of the Occidental world meet on
the ever nearer border of the Orient.
Who can forsee what this will mean in
moral, mental, and spiritual develop
ment. A great intellectual and artistic
future seems to open before us. Let
us here at Stanford welcome it, freeing
ourselves as heretofore from the tyran
ny of precedent, of the past, except in
so far as the past has shown the right
principles of conduct and has discover
ed facts. Let us be conservative 'n
holding to that which is good and true
and essential, and above all to justice,
but radical in our willingness to re
ceive and understand the new while
' discarding promptly the trivial and the
transient. We can be free to give that
legitimate scope to active minds essen
tial in order to make a university. It
' is largely a matter of men —of men of
character, of men whose trained men
tal processes permit them a wide
j range. It is a great privilege to be
a part of such a real University, either
'as a student, teacher or trustee. One
of the great features of such a Univer
sity must be loyalty. I want to say to
the Trustees, Faculty, and Alumni that
in this period when these young people
are entrusted to use we must not for
get to teach them something of the
growth and history of our own coun
try, of the principles leading its early
founders to begin on this continent
' new forms of democratic government.
They must be taught their deep re
responsibility as citizens and as guard
ians of those human rights, won after
!so many bitter contests. Without a
' proper safeguarding of those rights,
I without abiding loyalty and love of
I country, we may find that all else is
dross, because the essentials of con
trol are in the hands of those not sym
pathetic with the beautiful and in
i spiring ideals of our country.
>1 iittial Responsibility.
We must all tlie.n together stand
ready to do our utmost to defend and
to develop our institutions and our
country. Upon us, with the advan
, tages of university associations, falls
a full measure of responsibility. An
! education which brings with it
i dilettantism is as empty as a decorated
; egg shell. Education should be from
tlie heart outwards, should strengthen
the foundations of. character, enhance
the spirit of helpfulness, the desire to
be worth while in the days, be they
few or many, that lie before us. Edu
cation should make us loyal—loyal co
our University, to our country, above
all to truth.
Let us here at Stanford, Trustees,
Faculty, Alumni, and students, to
gether do our best as unselfish citi
zens to develop a university of serv
ice, of citizenship in its broadest sense,
of character—a place where truth is
paramount. In a word, a university
I of quality and of usefulness.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, in accepting the presidency of Stanford, outlined
to some extent his policy for the future development of the university and
dwelt on his hdpes and ambitions that the institution of which he is an
alumnus may not only continue its present noble work, but become of greater
service to individuals and the world at large, llis address follows:
Men and Women of Stanford:
This day brings me a great responsibility, honor, and the hope that I may
prove worthy of the position of President and merit the many kind words that
have been said to me and of me by Stanford men. I accept the responsibility,
am grateful for the honor, and will strive with all that is in

understand why many of my old friends seem to take the
choice as a natural one. I take pride in believing that it is because I am con
sidered a typical Stanford man, familiar with this I'niversity and what it has
stood for. I came here as a boy twenty-three years ago, and my thoughts go
back to those early days.
The hazy, idealistic dreams of boyhood are hard to define, difficult to

realize, and usually merge into tho maze of emotions and experiences that
make up lite as we meet it from day to day.

gestions, there was never a doul t in my mind as to where I would go to pro
pare for medicine.
The charm of those early days has never leftme. The freedom, the whole

ers, the absence of traditions, the presence of both Senator and Mrs. Stanford,
the beautiful buildings, the University's surroundings, all conspired to foster
in me a deep love for Stanford. My associates had with me the privilege of
working under that rare group of men of character and learning, Imbued with
the spirit of the Argonauts, that had been gathered from many quarters by a
young and forceful president. To a degree in their very origin and training
they typified the West, as we know it —a composite of the best, the most virile,
the most venturesome spirits front all parts of a new and noble land. It is 110
wonder there was a swing, a force to those early years that we can .hardly
hope to see duplicated. It did much to engender that loyalty and faith that
have carried Stanford University triumphantly through the death of its Found
ers, the great government law suit, the lean years of building, and the destruc
tion wrought by the earthquake.

My own growth has been alongside
that of Stanford; my heart has been
with it through all of its years. Now,
as one of its sons, to be designated as
its leader is one of those sacred re
sponsibilities that can only be under
taken with a spirit of humility
panied by a firm endeavor to do one's
best. Looking back to my first years,
and thinking again of the place given
by me to Dr. Jordan as a man and as

informed, if they will use the Presi
dent, if need be, to help them to get
the facts, 1 am sure that Stanford will
go far in the generation to come. I
count on the assistance of the Alumni
at every step.
Intensify Development.
Stanford has won a well established
place among universities. Its growth
having almost reached the limit of its
present endowment, it is necessary to
choose its work and develop thorough
ly its chosen fields in order to retain
its present elements of strength. The
first step is to limit the number of
those to be received as students. The
next step must be to ascertain by carc
ful study how by cooperation and mu
tual interest we can get the most out
of the University's income, give most
to the students, and do the most crea
tive work. We must decide in how
far we are justified in teaching sub
jects equally well taught in dozens of
other places. We must confine our
elementary work to subjects that lead
somewhere. One of our strongest fea
tures is that in certain professional
departments careful supervision of the
work of an entering student is possible
from the freshman year onward. With
the establishment of a maximum num
ber for students it is inevitable that
more and more advanced students will
be received and a higher average grade
of work done. This will mean less
elementary work of a general type, but
it need not interfere with the Univer
sity's handling such work where it
can be done better than in the second
ary schools. The great development
of these schools will soon free us
from the necessity of handling many
preparatory studies. Where in the
University elementary work is not
carefully supervised and at least in
part handled by the full professor, the
master, it is apt to be given less well
than by those in a secondary school
devoting their life to teach certain sub
jects. Too much beginning work is
done in Universities either as a chore
or by advanced students, earnest but
lacking that breadth of view essential
in teaching the elements of any sub
ject.
Value of Major Department.
There is great value in the major
department system. It is a splendid
thing to learn to do at least one thing
well, to do some advanced work in a
subject. The major department system
has shown at Stanford a tendency t.>
crystallize, to become inelastic. It
must be more compressible here, moro
expansile there, if it is to meet the
changing requirements of the time. Its
best feature, the opportunity of the ex
pert to advise and assist the student
in planning bis own education, has
been sadly neglected in some depart
ments. It is in danger of falling of its
own weight in many particulars unless
those who manage it become more in
, terested in its application and more
liberal in their interpretation of it and
lend themselves readily to that coop
oration which is necessary to the needs
of new types of training required for
special work, special research, voca
tional preparation, some modification
must be found that will stand for
effectiveness and be elastic enough to
meet individual requirements and new
needs.
With proper coordination of the ex
isting departments, with the elimina

tioa of courses that practically dupli
cate others, with a consistent main
tenance of high standards of scholar
ship there is every reason to believe
that the University has sufficient re
sources available to make the brand
of Stanford upon a scholar, be he
chemist, philologist, or historian, upon
a teacher, engineer, physician, lawyer,
or journalist, mean thorough training,
and we hope superior merit.
Stanford's Resources.
We have a large endowment, a Hoard
of Trustees made up of unselfish men,
deeply interested in every phase of the
University's welfare, a splendid Facul
ty, a loyal group of Alumni, a fine stu
dent body, beautiful buildings, and a
healthful, inspiring environment. Our
country is new, very new\ Here in
California the product of the mingled
races of the Occidental world meet on
the ever nearer border of the Orient.
Who can forsee what this will mean in
moral, mental, and spiritual develop
ment. A great intellectual and artistic
future seems to open before us. Let
us here at Stanford welcome it, freeing
ourselves as heretofore from the tyran
ny of precedent, of the past, except in
so far as the past has shown the right
principles of conduct and has discover
ed facts. Let us be conservative 'n
holding to that which is good and true
and essential, and above all to justice,
but radical in our willingness to re
ceive and understand the new while
' discarding promptly the trivial and the
transient. We can be free to give that
legitimate scope to active minds essen
tial in order to make a university. It
' is largely a matter of men —of men of
character, of men whose trained men
tal processes permit them a wide
j range. It is a great privilege to be
a part of such a real University, either
'as a student, teacher or trustee. One
of the great features of such a Univer
sity must be loyalty. I want to say to
the Trustees, Faculty, and Alumni that
in this period when these young people
are entrusted to use we must not for
get to teach them something of the
growth and history of our own coun
try, of the principles leading its early
founders to begin on this continent
' new forms of democratic government.
They must be taught their deep re
responsibility as citizens and as guard
ians of those human rights, won after
!so many bitter contests. Without a
' proper safeguarding of those rights,
I without abiding loyalty and love of
I country, we may find that all else is
dross, because the essentials of con
trol are in the hands of those not sym
pathetic with the beautiful and in
i spiring ideals of our country.
>1 iittial Responsibility.
We must all tlie.n together stand
ready to do our utmost to defend and
to develop our institutions and our
country. Upon us, with the advan
, tages of university associations, falls
a full measure of responsibility. An
! education which brings with it
i dilettantism is as empty as a decorated
; egg shell. Education should be from
tlie heart outwards, should strengthen
the foundations of. character, enhance
the spirit of helpfulness, the desire to
be worth while in the days, be they
few or many, that lie before us. Edu
cation should make us loyal—loyal co
our University, to our country, above
all to truth.
Let us here at Stanford, Trustees,
Faculty, Alumni, and students, to
gether do our best as unselfish citi
zens to develop a university of serv
ice, of citizenship in its broadest sense,
of character—a place where truth is
paramount. In a word, a university
I of quality and of usefulness.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, in accepting the presidency of Stanford, outlined
to some extent his policy for the future development of the university and
dwelt on his hdpes and ambitions that the institution of which he is an
alumnus may not only continue its present noble work, but become of greater
service to individuals and the world at large, llis address follows:
Men and Women of Stanford:
This day brings me a great responsibility, honor, and the hope that I may
prove worthy of the position of President and merit the many kind words that
have been said to me and of me by Stanford men. I accept the responsibility,
am grateful for the honor, and will strive with all that is in

stood for. I came here as a boy twenty-three years ago, and my thoughts go
back to those early days.

gestions, there was never a doul t in my mind as to where I would go to pro
pare for medicine.
The charm of those early days has never leftme. The freedom, the whole
some, unconventional ways, the personal association with enthusiastic teach-


President Haj Lynum Wilbur
ers, the absence of traditions, the presence of both Senator and Mrs. Stanford,
the beautiful buildings, the University's surroundings, all conspired to foster
in me a deep love for Stanford. My associates had with me the privilege of
working under that rare group of men of character and learning, Imbued with
the spirit of the Argonauts, that had been gathered from many quarters by a
young and forceful president. To a degree in their very origin and training
they typified the West, as we know it —a composite of the best, the most virile,
the most venturesome spirits front all parts of a new and noble land. It is 110
wonder there was a swing, a force to those early years that we can .hardly
hope to see duplicated. It did much to engender that loyalty and faith that
have carried Stanford University triumphantly through the death of its Found
ers, the great government law suit, the lean years of building, and the destruc
tion wrought by the earthquake.

My own growth has been alongside
that of Stanford; my heart has been
with it through all of its years. Now,
as one of its sons, to be designated as
its leader is one of those sacred re
sponsibilities that can only be under
taken with a spirit of humility
panied by a firm endeavor to do one's
best. Looking back to my first years,
and thinking again of the place given
by me to Dr. Jordan as a man and as
an ideal, I feel the great responsibilty
upon me as intensified. It is to the
young men and young women of Stan
ford that are coming bore now, as wo
alumni did at the beginning, that i
propose to devote my life. 1 see in
them boys and girls like my class
mates. To them and to those who
follow them did Senator and Mrs.
Stanford devote their fortune, their
best efforts, their love. To these stud
ents. we of the faculty look to carry
on our work when we lay it down, to
represent our best thoughts, to fulfill
our hopes. To this end are they here.
To this end have they been taken out
of the ordinary current of life to spend
a few years with us.
Stai 11 ford's Task.
What is there in a University that
it should have such a chance, such a
responsibility? It seems to me that
there is 110 worthier task, with broader
possible scope, with higher human
possibilities, than that offered by the
University. It should be the seat, of
the greatest aspirations of the human
mind. Its very breath should be that
of catholicity, of idealism, and above
all, truth. Trivialities, prejudice, nar
rowness, should have no place. An
inculcation of the love of truth, of the
joy of seeking truth, should be its
main duty. Not a mere seeking after
abstract truth, but after a knowledge
of life, of life processes, human rela
tionships, such as will lead to knowl
edge of nature's laws and a desire to
conform to them, to be useful, to be of
service, and to serve the truth. The
University should not be something
apart from the life of the world about
it. It. should break down barriers that
tradition or ignorance have built up,
and it should stand out in a master
ful relationship with all worthy en
deavors. setting standards, stimulating
progress.
Democrat*} of Intellect.
The University is necessarily a part
of the educational system. It must
be jealous of its prerogatives; it re
quires some form of certification for
work previously done in order that it
may devote its energies to real Uni
versity work, and must give proper
credit to those who complete (he var
ious stages of its curriculum. It must
have high standards to prevent waste
of its time on the incompetent, the
idler, and the trifier. Nevertheless, we
must not take our University degrees
too seriously. A Bachelor of Arts
from the University of "Hard Knocks"
may mean power, courage, manhood,
development, while an A. B. from an
actual University too often means that
some one else has paid the bills for a
period of genteel idling, social fol-de
rol, and a minimum of honest en
deavor. It is important to realize that
(lie University should be a place for
democracy of the intellect and that 't
should keep open door for those cap

able of using its facilities, for those
who aspire to learn, to lead, to be use
ful—those who have high aspirations.
Snobbishness, superiority, patronizing
of the less fortunate, should be im
possible The University professor
should be looked upon as a highly de
veloped, useful citizen; not as some
thing apart, imponderable, cloud
scraping. The type of education so
popular in the past, so eminently im
practical, except in the general train
ing it gave, has done much to cultivate
an abnormal view of the University
and its chief exponent, the professor.
Now human knowledge is so wide
spread, so useful, so essential in busi
ness, trade, commerce, and the pro
fessions, we must insist that the Uni
versity take its rightful place in
human affairs and be rightly evaluated
by those both without and within.
Kccriiitiiig Ground for Youth.
To the universities, their teachers,
| their research workers, must we look
for the solution of many great social
j problems, and for the control of those
unnecessary diseases that, devour the
! very marrow of the race. To the uni
-1
versities must we turn for facts in
! order that we may face with open
; oyes the world as it is and strive to
make it the world that it should be.
The universites must lead in the fight
| against oppression, evil, ignorance,
filth. We cannot be neutral in these
! struggles. We must be positive forces,
making the University the recruiting
ground for youth, arming them for
the big tasks of the race.
.Hake HOOlll for the New.
Stanford has already done much
'along this line. We can do much
more. We can stand for the things
we choose to stand for and should
! elect to do well what we select to do.
Stanford, to be a real university, must
keep an atmosphere favorable to re
search. to new ideas, to thinkers of
all sorts. Merely to retail acquired
I book knowledge to successive groups
of students would be a sorry life for
i a real University man. He must add
something new, must study old prob
lems in new ways, ever be thinking,
[ studying. As a University worker he
must know the solutions of the past
i and yet stand 011 the edge of that great
I field of the unknown > that is still dark.
Each year should see light let in,
fresh conquests made, definite steps
forward. The wonderful, immutable
laws of nature, when once ascertained,
are dependable, and give us new power
in making life sweeter, more effective,
safer.
The desire to learn new things must
J lie in the air. Merely to set up baubles
to encourage scholarship and research
| may be expedient, but we cannot ex
pect a man who considers these as
worth much, or at least, as goals at
tained, to go far along the plodding
road of new thought or new discovery.
No I'laee for Stagnation.
There can be 110 place for the men
tally stagnant; no place for those
who fail to grow each year. The Uni-
I versity must be untrammeled in its
right (o riil itself of the incompetent
and indolent among its students and
I the ineffectives and mediocrities in its
j faculty. It cannot hope to lead, to
inspire, if if is weighed down by such
burdens. Indefinite or life term ol
professors is meant to give security
.and scope for wide training, deep
knowledge, profound study, not to pro
vide an easy and permanent resting
place for those who once arrive. We
professors should keep our high re
sponsibilities in mind. We cannot con
form to any one pattern. Some of us
must needs be primarily, teachers;
others, investigators. It will be my
solemn duty to try to see that the
teachers of Stanford in the future
reach that same high quality of char
acter and scholarship that makes the
University of today. I must, with the
help of my associates, protect the
future students of Stanford and try
to see that they come in contact with
real men and real minds. T hope and
trust that the Faculty will use me to
protect them in their work, to assume
as far as possible administrative du
ties that interfere with their devotion
to the special work before them.
A Foster Parent.
The University occupies the position,
no matter how hard it may try at
times to avoid it, of foster parent to
the youths who come to it. We look
upon the family and its purity as the
greatest influence upon our boys and
girls. Environment means so much.
We must keep the University environ
ment clean; we must keep our stu
dents exposed to men of high charac
ter and scholarly attainments. There
must be an atmosphere favorable to
healthful lives, physical exercise, clean
minds, and clean bodies. The gospel
of work should need no particular
advocacy in a University whose object
is "to qualify its students for personal
success and direct usefulness in life."
Maintain a Standard. *
There is now a well understood and
accepted standard of Stanford life. \t
is in the hands of the students to see
whether they will maintain it at a
high level —whether they will demon
strate that student self-government
makes for character building. Why
not reserve Stanford for men and
women with a purpose high enough to
putin their proper place the distract
ions of University life that can be of
great service if not over-done? Why not
keep Stanford free from the curse of
luxury, of aimlessness, of mere money
spending? Why not free ourselves
promptly from those who early demon
strate that they have not the instincts
of the true man or woman, so that we
will not run the risk of placing the
name of Stanford upon those who are
unworthy?
Legacy of Founders.
Our founders pondered long over the
various ways they might be of the
most service to the students of Stan
ford. Mrs. Stanford saw the. need for
some form of religion, felt the en
nobling effect of high example and
high precept. She built this splendid
church, made it free from the man
made creed and varieties of religion,
but devoted it to the best that is in
us, to the highest hopes and yearnings
of life, to that Power which means
something different to each one of us,
but stands with all of us for faith,
hope and charity—for that which is
pure, ennobling, self-denying, loving.
We must be deeply thankful to Mrs.
Stanford for this, her watchful care
and solicitude, and we must help t.)
foster those influences so cherished by
her. Let each man choose his own
method of worship, but we can here
give our students the chance to hear
the words of those who seek to inter
pret the religious thought and teach
ing of the day or to guide us in the
ethical aspects of human conduct.
Part <>t' Alumni.
The Alumni of Stanford are now
becoming fully grown. They will mean
much more each year than ever before.
The mirror to the outside world the
effects of their training. In them and
in their acts are seen the results of
the University's work. Theirs is the
responsibility of the older brother for
the younger, so far as the student is

concerned, and of the independent son
to the parent, so far as the Faculty
is concerned. They must give their
confidence and support to the Faculty.
The Faculty is ever changing and
should be fully up to date. The Alumni
are almost sure to reflect their own
period of training and the ideals of
their own student days. It is perhaps
because of this that many institutions
complain of a hampering influence ex
erted upon the universities by various
alumni, of abnormal athletic stimula
tion, and other abuses. Stanford has
been most forutnate in its Alumni.
Many of them kept in close touch with
the growth and changes in the Uni
versity. If the Alumni will keep fully
informed, if they will use the Presi
dent, if need be, to help them to get
the facts, 1 am sure that Stanford will
go far in the generation to come. I
count on the assistance of the Alumni
at every step.

responsibility? It seems to me that
there is 110 worthier task, with broader
possible scope, with higher human
possibilities, than that offered by the
University. It should be the seat, of
the greatest aspirations of the human
mind. Its very breath should be that
of catholicity, of idealism, and above
all, truth. Trivialities, prejudice, nar
rowness, should have no place. An
inculcation of the love of truth, of the
joy of seeking truth, should be its
main duty. Not a mere seeking after
abstract truth, but after a knowledge
of life, of life processes, human rela
tionships, such as will lead to knowl
edge of nature's laws and a desire to
conform to them, to be useful, to be of
service, and to serve the truth. The
University should not be something
apart from the life of the world about
it. It. should break down barriers that
tradition or ignorance have built up,
and it should stand out in a master
ful relationship with all worthy en
deavors. setting standards, stimulating
progress.
Democrat*} of Intellect.
The University is necessarily a part
of the educational system. It must
be jealous of its prerogatives; it re
quires some form of certification for
work previously done in order that it
may devote its energies to real Uni
versity work, and must give proper
credit to those who complete (he var
ious stages of its curriculum. It must
have high standards to prevent waste
of its time on the incompetent, the
idler, and the trifier. Nevertheless, we
must not take our University degrees
too seriously. A Bachelor of Arts
from the University of "Hard Knocks"
may mean power, courage, manhood,
development, while an A. B. from an
actual University too often means that
some one else has paid the bills for a
period of genteel idling, social fol-de
rol, and a minimum of honest en
deavor. It is important to realize that
(lie University should be a place for
democracy of the intellect and that 't
should keep open door for those cap

able of using its facilities, for those
who aspire to learn, to lead, to be use
ful—those who have high aspirations.
Snobbishness, superiority, patronizing
of the less fortunate, should be im
possible The University professor
should be looked upon as a highly de
veloped, useful citizen; not as some
thing apart, imponderable, cloud
scraping. The type of education so
popular in the past, so eminently im
practical, except in the general train
ing it gave, has done much to cultivate
an abnormal view of the University
and its chief exponent, the professor.
Now human knowledge is so wide
spread, so useful, so essential in busi
ness, trade, commerce, and the pro
fessions, we must insist that the Uni
versity take its rightful place in
human affairs and be rightly evaluated
by those both without and within.
Kccriiitiiig Ground for Youth.
To the universities, their teachers,
| their research workers, must we look
for the solution of many great social
j problems, and for the control of those
unnecessary diseases that, devour the
! very marrow of the race. To the uni
-1
versities must we turn for facts in
! order that we may face with open
; oyes the world as it is and strive to
make it the world that it should be.
The universites must lead in the fight
| against oppression, evil, ignorance,
filth. We cannot be neutral in these
! struggles. We must be positive forces,
making the University the recruiting
ground for youth, arming them for
the big tasks of the race.
.Hake HOOlll for the New.
Stanford has already done much
'along this line. We can do much
more. We can stand for the things
we choose to stand for and should
! elect to do well what we select to do.
Stanford, to be a real university, must
keep an atmosphere favorable to re
search. to new ideas, to thinkers of
all sorts. Merely to retail acquired
I book knowledge to successive groups
of students would be a sorry life for
i a real University man. He must add
something new, must study old prob
lems in new ways, ever be thinking,
[ studying. As a University worker he
must know the solutions of the past
i and yet stand 011 the edge of that great
I field of the unknown > that is still dark.
Each year should see light let in,
fresh conquests made, definite steps
forward. The wonderful, immutable
laws of nature, when once ascertained,
are dependable, and give us new power
in making life sweeter, more effective,
safer.
The desire to learn new things must
J lie in the air. Merely to set up baubles
to encourage scholarship and research
| may be expedient, but we cannot ex
pect a man who considers these as
worth much, or at least, as goals at
tained, to go far along the plodding
road of new thought or new discovery.
No I'laee for Stagnation.
There can be 110 place for the men
tally stagnant; no place for those
who fail to grow each year. The Uni-
I versity must be untrammeled in its
right (o riil itself of the incompetent
and indolent among its students and
I the ineffectives and mediocrities in its
j faculty. It cannot hope to lead, to
inspire, if if is weighed down by such
burdens. Indefinite or life term ol
professors is meant to give security
.and scope for wide training, deep
knowledge, profound study, not to pro
vide an easy and permanent resting
place for those who once arrive. We
professors should keep our high re
sponsibilities in mind. We cannot con
form to any one pattern. Some of us
must needs be primarily, teachers;
others, investigators. It will be my
solemn duty to try to see that the
teachers of Stanford in the future
reach that same high quality of char
acter and scholarship that makes the
University of today. I must, with the
help of my associates, protect the
future students of Stanford and try
to see that they come in contact with
real men and real minds. T hope and
trust that the Faculty will use me to
protect them in their work, to assume
as far as possible administrative du
ties that interfere with their devotion
to the special work before them.
A Foster Parent.
The University occupies the position,
no matter how hard it may try at
times to avoid it, of foster parent to
the youths who come to it. We look
upon the family and its purity as the
greatest influence upon our boys and
girls. Environment means so much.
We must keep the University environ
ment clean; we must keep our stu
dents exposed to men of high charac
ter and scholarly attainments. There
must be an atmosphere favorable to
healthful lives, physical exercise, clean
minds, and clean bodies. The gospel
of work should need no particular
advocacy in a University whose object
is "to qualify its students for personal
success and direct usefulness in life."
Maintain a Standard. *
There is now a well understood and
accepted standard of Stanford life. \t
is in the hands of the students to see
whether they will maintain it at a
high level —whether they will demon
strate that student self-government
makes for character building. Why
not reserve Stanford for men and
women with a purpose high enough to
putin their proper place the distract
ions of University life that can be of
great service if not over-done? Why not
keep Stanford free from the curse of
luxury, of aimlessness, of mere money
spending? Why not free ourselves
promptly from those who early demon
strate that they have not the instincts
of the true man or woman, so that we
will not run the risk of placing the
name of Stanford upon those who are
unworthy?
Legacy of Founders.
Our founders pondered long over the
various ways they might be of the
most service to the students of Stan
ford. Mrs. Stanford saw the. need for
some form of religion, felt the en
nobling effect of high example and
high precept. She built this splendid
church, made it free from the man
made creed and varieties of religion,
but devoted it to the best that is in
us, to the highest hopes and yearnings
of life, to that Power which means
something different to each one of us,
but stands with all of us for faith,
hope and charity—for that which is
pure, ennobling, self-denying, loving.
We must be deeply thankful to Mrs.
Stanford for this, her watchful care
and solicitude, and we must help t.)
foster those influences so cherished by
her. Let each man choose his own
method of worship, but we can here
give our students the chance to hear
the words of those who seek to inter
pret the religious thought and teach
ing of the day or to guide us in the
ethical aspects of human conduct.
Part <>t' Alumni.
The Alumni of Stanford are now
becoming fully grown. They will mean
much more each year than ever before.
The mirror to the outside world the
effects of their training. In them and
in their acts are seen the results of
the University's work. Theirs is the
responsibility of the older brother for
the younger, so far as the student is

concerned, and of the independent son
to the parent, so far as the Faculty
is concerned. They must give their
confidence and support to the Faculty.
The Faculty is ever changing and
should be fully up to date. The Alumni
are almost sure to reflect their own
period of training and the ideals of
their own student days. It is perhaps
because of this that many institutions
complain of a hampering influence ex
erted upon the universities by various
alumni, of abnormal athletic stimula
tion, and other abuses. Stanford has
been most forutnate in its Alumni.
Many of them kept in close touch with
the growth and changes in the Uni
versity. If the Alumni will keep fully
informed, if they will use the Presi
dent, if need be, to help them to get
the facts, 1 am sure that Stanford will
go far in the generation to come. I
count on the assistance of the Alumni
at every step.
Intensify Development.
Stanford has won a well established
place among universities. Its growth
having almost reached the limit of its
present endowment, it is necessary to
choose its work and develop thorough
ly its chosen fields in order to retain
its present elements of strength. The
first step is to limit the number of
those to be received as students. The
next step must be to ascertain by carc
ful study how by cooperation and mu
tual interest we can get the most out
of the University's income, give most
to the students, and do the most crea
tive work. We must decide in how
far we are justified in teaching sub
jects equally well taught in dozens of
other places. We must confine our
elementary work to subjects that lead
somewhere. One of our strongest fea
tures is that in certain professional
departments careful supervision of the
work of an entering student is possible
from the freshman year onward. With
the establishment of a maximum num
ber for students it is inevitable that
more and more advanced students will
be received and a higher average grade
of work done. This will mean less
elementary work of a general type, but
it need not interfere with the Univer
sity's handling such work where it
can be done better than in the second
ary schools. The great development
of these schools will soon free us
from the necessity of handling many
preparatory studies. Where in the
University elementary work is not
carefully supervised and at least in
part handled by the full professor, the
master, it is apt to be given less well
than by those in a secondary school
devoting their life to teach certain sub
jects. Too much beginning work is
done in Universities either as a chore
or by advanced students, earnest but
lacking that breadth of view essential
in teaching the elements of any sub
ject.
Value of Major Department.
There is great value in the major
department system. It is a splendid
thing to learn to do at least one thing
well, to do some advanced work in a
subject. The major department system
has shown at Stanford a tendency t.>
crystallize, to become inelastic. It
must be more compressible here, moro
expansile there, if it is to meet the
changing requirements of the time. Its
best feature, the opportunity of the ex
pert to advise and assist the student
in planning bis own education, has
been sadly neglected in some depart
ments. It is in danger of falling of its
own weight in many particulars unless
those who manage it become more in
, terested in its application and more
liberal in their interpretation of it and
lend themselves readily to that coop
oration which is necessary to the needs
of new types of training required for
special work, special research, voca
tional preparation, some modification
must be found that will stand for
effectiveness and be elastic enough to
meet individual requirements and new
needs.
With proper coordination of the ex
isting departments, with the elimina

tioa of courses that practically dupli
cate others, with a consistent main
tenance of high standards of scholar
ship there is every reason to believe
that the University has sufficient re
sources available to make the brand
of Stanford upon a scholar, be he
chemist, philologist, or historian, upon
a teacher, engineer, physician, lawyer,
or journalist, mean thorough training,
and we hope superior merit.
Stanford's Resources.
We have a large endowment, a Hoard
of Trustees made up of unselfish men,
deeply interested in every phase of the
University's welfare, a splendid Facul
ty, a loyal group of Alumni, a fine stu
dent body, beautiful buildings, and a
healthful, inspiring environment. Our
country is new, very new\ Here in
California the product of the mingled
races of the Occidental world meet on
the ever nearer border of the Orient.
Who can forsee what this will mean in
moral, mental, and spiritual develop
ment. A great intellectual and artistic
future seems to open before us. Let
us here at Stanford welcome it, freeing
ourselves as heretofore from the tyran
ny of precedent, of the past, except in
so far as the past has shown the right
principles of conduct and has discover
ed facts. Let us be conservative 'n
holding to that which is good and true
and essential, and above all to justice,
but radical in our willingness to re
ceive and understand the new while
' discarding promptly the trivial and the
transient. We can be free to give that
legitimate scope to active minds essen
tial in order to make a university. It
' is largely a matter of men —of men of
character, of men whose trained men
tal processes permit them a wide
j range. It is a great privilege to be
a part of such a real University, either
'as a student, teacher or trustee. One
of the great features of such a Univer
sity must be loyalty. I want to say to
the Trustees, Faculty, and Alumni that
in this period when these young people
are entrusted to use we must not for
get to teach them something of the
growth and history of our own coun
try, of the principles leading its early
founders to begin on this continent
' new forms of democratic government.
They must be taught their deep re
responsibility as citizens and as guard
ians of those human rights, won after
!so many bitter contests. Without a
' proper safeguarding of those rights,
I without abiding loyalty and love of
I country, we may find that all else is
dross, because the essentials of con
trol are in the hands of those not sym
pathetic with the beautiful and in
i spiring ideals of our country.
>1 iittial Responsibility.
We must all tlie.n together stand
ready to do our utmost to defend and
to develop our institutions and our
country. Upon us, with the advan
, tages of university associations, falls
a full measure of responsibility. An
! education which brings with it
i dilettantism is as empty as a decorated
; egg shell. Education should be from
tlie heart outwards, should strengthen
the foundations of. character, enhance
the spirit of helpfulness, the desire to
be worth while in the days, be they
few or many, that lie before us. Edu
cation should make us loyal—loyal co
our University, to our country, above
all to truth.
Let us here at Stanford, Trustees,
Faculty, Alumni, and students, to
gether do our best as unselfish citi
zens to develop a university of serv
ice, of citizenship in its broadest sense,
of character—a place where truth is
paramount. In a word, a university
I of quality and of usefulness.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, in accepting the presidency of Stanford, outlined
to some extent his policy for the future development of the university and
dwelt on his hdpes and ambitions that the institution of which he is an
alumnus may not only continue its present noble work, but become of greater
service to individuals and the world at large, llis address follows:
Men and Women of Stanford:
This day brings me a great responsibility, honor, and the hope that I may
prove worthy of the position of President and merit the many kind words that
have been said to me and of me by Stanford men. I accept the responsibility,
am grateful for the honor, and will strive with all that is in
Proud to be me to measure up to the work betore me. i have tried to

understand why many of my old friends seem to take the
choice as a natural one. I take pride in believing that it is because I am con
sidered a typical Stanford man, familiar with this I'niversity and what it has
stood for. I came here as a boy twenty-three years ago, and my thoughts go
back to those early days.
The hazy, idealistic dreams of boyhood are hard to define, difficult to

realize, and usually merge into tho maze of emotions and experiences that
make up lite as we meet it from day to day.

hearty program of the University, the inspiration of its
1 eginniug, its new president—all appealed to me. and in spite of other sug
gestions, there was never a doul t in my mind as to where I would go to pro
pare for medicine.
The charm of those early days has never leftme. The freedom, the whole
some, unconventional ways, the personal association with enthusiastic teach-

ers, the absence of traditions, the presence of both Senator and Mrs. Stanford,
the beautiful buildings, the University's surroundings, all conspired to foster
in me a deep love for Stanford. My associates had with me the privilege of
working under that rare group of men of character and learning, Imbued with
the spirit of the Argonauts, that had been gathered from many quarters by a
young and forceful president. To a degree in their very origin and training
they typified the West, as we know it —a composite of the best, the most virile,
the most venturesome spirits front all parts of a new and noble land. It is 110
wonder there was a swing, a force to those early years that we can .hardly
hope to see duplicated. It did much to engender that loyalty and faith that
have carried Stanford University triumphantly through the death of its Found
ers, the great government law suit, the lean years of building, and the destruc
tion wrought by the earthquake.

My own growth has been alongside
that of Stanford; my heart has been
with it through all of its years. Now,
as one of its sons, to be designated as
its leader is one of those sacred re
sponsibilities that can only be under
taken with a spirit of humility
panied by a firm endeavor to do one's
best. Looking back to my first years,
and thinking again of the place given
by me to Dr. Jordan as a man and as
an ideal, I feel the great responsibilty
upon me as intensified. It is to the
young men and young women of Stan
ford that are coming bore now, as wo
alumni did at the beginning, that i
propose to devote my life. 1 see in
them boys and girls like my class
mates. To them and to those who
follow them did Senator and Mrs.
Stanford devote their fortune, their
best efforts, their love. To these stud
ents. we of the faculty look to carry
on our work when we lay it down, to
represent our best thoughts, to fulfill
our hopes. To this end are they here.
To this end have they been taken out
of the ordinary current of life to spend
a few years with us.
Stai 11 ford's Task.

it should have such a chance, such a

the establishment of a maximum num
ber for students it is inevitable that
more and more advanced students will
be received and a higher average grade
of work done. This will mean less
elementary work of a general type, but
it need not interfere with the Univer
sity's handling such work where it
can be done better than in the second
ary schools. The great development
of these schools will soon free us
from the necessity of handling many
preparatory studies. Where in the
University elementary work is not
carefully supervised and at least in
part handled by the full professor, the
master, it is apt to be given less well
than by those in a secondary school
devoting their life to teach certain sub
jects. Too much beginning work is
done in Universities either as a chore
or by advanced students, earnest but
lacking that breadth of view essential
in teaching the elements of any sub
ject.
Value of Major Department.
There is great value in the major
department system. It is a splendid
thing to learn to do at least one thing
well, to do some advanced work in a
subject. The major department system
has shown at Stanford a tendency t.>
crystallize, to become inelastic. It
must be more compressible here, moro
expansile there, if it is to meet the
changing requirements of the time. Its
best feature, the opportunity of the ex
pert to advise and assist the student
in planning bis own education, has
been sadly neglected in some depart
ments. It is in danger of falling of its
own weight in many particulars unless
those who manage it become more in
, terested in its application and more
liberal in their interpretation of it and
lend themselves readily to that coop
oration which is necessary to the needs
of new types of training required for
special work, special research, voca
tional preparation, some modification
must be found that will stand for
effectiveness and be elastic enough to
meet individual requirements and new
needs.
With proper coordination of the ex
isting departments, with the elimina

tioa of courses that practically dupli
cate others, with a consistent main
tenance of high standards of scholar
ship there is every reason to believe
that the University has sufficient re
sources available to make the brand
of Stanford upon a scholar, be he
chemist, philologist, or historian, upon
a teacher, engineer, physician, lawyer,
or journalist, mean thorough training,
and we hope superior merit.
Stanford's Resources.
We have a large endowment, a Hoard
of Trustees made up of unselfish men,
deeply interested in every phase of the
University's welfare, a splendid Facul
ty, a loyal group of Alumni, a fine stu
dent body, beautiful buildings, and a
healthful, inspiring environment. Our
country is new, very new\ Here in
California the product of the mingled
races of the Occidental world meet on
the ever nearer border of the Orient.
Who can forsee what this will mean in
moral, mental, and spiritual develop
ment. A great intellectual and artistic
future seems to open before us. Let
us here at Stanford welcome it, freeing
ourselves as heretofore from the tyran
ny of precedent, of the past, except in
so far as the past has shown the right
principles of conduct and has discover
ed facts. Let us be conservative 'n
holding to that which is good and true
and essential, and above all to justice,
but radical in our willingness to re
ceive and understand the new while
' discarding promptly the trivial and the
transient. We can be free to give that
legitimate scope to active minds essen
tial in order to make a university. It
' is largely a matter of men —of men of
character, of men whose trained men
tal processes permit them a wide
j range. It is a great privilege to be
a part of such a real University, either
'as a student, teacher or trustee. One
of the great features of such a Univer
sity must be loyalty. I want to say to
the Trustees, Faculty, and Alumni that
in this period when these young people
are entrusted to use we must not for
get to teach them something of the
growth and history of our own coun
try, of the principles leading its early
founders to begin on this continent
' new forms of democratic government.
They must be taught their deep re
responsibility as citizens and as guard
ians of those human rights, won after
!so many bitter contests. Without a
' proper safeguarding of those rights,
I without abiding loyalty and love of
I country, we may find that all else is
dross, because the essentials of con
trol are in the hands of those not sym
pathetic with the beautiful and in
i spiring ideals of our country.
>1 iittial Responsibility.
We must all tlie.n together stand
ready to do our utmost to defend and
to develop our institutions and our
country. Upon us, with the advan
, tages of university associations, falls
a full measure of responsibility. An
! education which brings with it
i dilettantism is as empty as a decorated
; egg shell. Education should be from
tlie heart outwards, should strengthen
the foundations of. character, enhance
the spirit of helpfulness, the desire to
be worth while in the days, be they
few or many, that lie before us. Edu
cation should make us loyal—loyal co
our University, to our country, above
all to truth.
Let us here at Stanford, Trustees,
Faculty, Alumni, and students, to
gether do our best as unselfish citi
zens to develop a university of serv
ice, of citizenship in its broadest sense,
of character—a place where truth is
paramount. In a word, a university
I of quality and of usefulness.
