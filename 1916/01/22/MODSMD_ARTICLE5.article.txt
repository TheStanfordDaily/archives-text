Forre st Starkey Fisher, of the class
of lS!i!t, spoke first on behalf of the
Alumni. In congratulating Dr. Wilbur
and assuring him of tlie support and
cooperation of the Alumni, he spok \
in part, iis follows:
This signal event is one without ex
ample iu the life of Stanford I'niver
sitlt marks the fulfillment of the
hopes of her Alumni. It is the first
time that Stanford University luis call
ed to the highest office within her gift
an alumnus. It charges anew our
memory with the current of passing
years ard the events which have

touched the life of our University.
Conceived in the tender memory of an
only child this rich endowment of love
took tangible form and drew to its
service the men and women who were
to found the I'niversity. There was
no history rich in tradition and no
precedent horn of past endeavor to
Snide those who were to build here.
For tiiis leadership a true American
scholar must be chosen, a man of high
attainments and purpose, strong in
his design to overcome every barrier,
virile of mind and body, of creative
force, and above all a man of pro
phetic vision and infinite faith. The
future was concerned with this struc
ture which he and his co-workers were
to build here and the young men and
women of the years to come were vo
receive here the lessons which were
to mould their lives, determine their
worth as citizens, prescribe the limits
of their scholarship, develop their
character, and school them in the
practices of the world into which they
were to go, so that they might assume
and discharge to the fullest extent the
duties imposed upon them in mature
life. Surely here was a great respon
sibility but a greater opportunity. For
this high office Dr. David Starr Jordan
was chosen and the love and reverence
alike of those who have shared his
labors and those who have gone out
as graduates evidence how well he
has fulfilled his mission. These were
the pioneers, the pathfinders of west
ern education, and a span of twenty
five years of their influence has in
delibly placed its mark upon the in
stitutions, learning and citizenship of
this state and nation. For here they
builded a university, here they im
planted the tenets of truth, loyalty
and integrity, and here many of those
men and women still labor secure in
the love and esteem of our ever in
creasing alumni, and the thought of
the state and nation is constantly be
ing enriched by their influence.
Dr. Wilbur as Student.
It was my privilege to know Dr.
Wilbur in many of the relations of
life at Stanford. As a student he was
humble and earnest with a devotion
to work that was constant and in
spiring. He did not permit his work
to draw him into seclusion, but on
the contrary sought the companion
ship of other students. He always
took a lively interest in all student
body matters and had much to do with
shaping affairs in the early days. As
a friend he was helpful and kindly
and many students of his day were the
recipients of his generosity, little
knowing his own deprivations. He
was genial and sociable in intercourse,
with a natural humor all his own, and
withal lie was dignified and respect
ful. Not seeking personal honors he
was an earnest advocate of any cause
he espoused.* As a teacher lie was di
rect and sincere in his methods, arous
ing the interest and inquiry of the
student by a force of his own. As
dean of the medical school his work
has received universal commendation
and needs no comment here, and while
his work which he now takes up will
be judged by the future, we who know
Dr. Wilbur are confident that it will
be characterized by the high standards
of those who have gone before.
A Look at the Future.
As we look into the future we see
under the leadership of Dr. Wilbur
and those who are to follow him a
university of perfect dimensions, rich
in character and worthy tradition
rather than magnitude. The univer
sity of which we have all dreamed,
where teacher and student work in
perfect accord for the realization of

their ideals, and where harmony and
the absence of discord permit the or
ganization to lie welded into an har
monious whole. What shall we say
has counted most for the success
which has attended the work of Dr. ;
Jordan, Dr. Planner, Dr. Wilbur, and
the others who have labored here, and
the students who have gone out into
the world and arisen above the com
mon average of mankind? Wast
application and work? Yes and still
something moreâ€”integrity of purpose
and self denial. No success in this
or any other walk in life has come
without it, and the harvest of the
future will lie gathered by those who
understand and practice it. Here is
contained the sermon of every success
the world knows. Self denial lias
brought Dr. Wilbur back today as
president of his alma mater.
Alumni Support Assured.
Speaking for the Alumni of our
University 1 bring to Dr. Wilbur the
assurance of their full cooperation and
support, to the members of the faculty
a full measure of our gratitude and
regard for their efforts in the past,
and to the members of the Board
of Trustees we bring our hearty appre
ciation and thanks for this, the honor
to our fellow alumnus.
And now it is with confidence that
we leave the University to this leader
ship., knowing that such stewardship
shall bring to full realization that old
phophecy, "lie that overcometh shall
inherit these things." Then shall
Stanford become a great university
and justly so.
