# RAY LYMAN WILBUR IS FORMALLY GIVEN OFFICE
## DR. JORDAN LEADS CEREMONY Memorial Church Is Filled to Doors to Greet Alumnus President 
### 
A reverent congregation felt the
bigness of today's inaugural ceremonv
in the Memorial Church, which conse
crated the third President of Stanford
to the duty which has been fulfilled
reverently by those men who have
followed the Founders in the high
places of the Quadrangle. The pulse
of sincerity and of venerable purpose
made its impress on two thousand
people, and turned their thought from
the common place of every day regard
for Stanford to a livened understand
ing of lofty purpose and great effort..
Expectant Hundreds Await.
Expectant hundreds awaited the en
trance to the Church of Dr. Wilbur,
and his escort of faculty members,
alumni, and trustees. The first notes
of a sublime processional march gave
notice of their approach. The officials
of the ceremony, some hundred in
number, were assigned seats in the
nave of the building, and a hush which
hung over the auditorium preceded the
introductory address of Chancellor
David Starr Jordan.
Message from Dr. Hraiiner.
Early in the course of his remarks,
Dr. Jordan read a message of good
will from President Emeritus Branner,
which was flashed by wireless from
shipboard off Cape Hatteras. The
words were, "Best wishes from the
high seas â€”-Branner." The words of
the Chancellor were uttered with a
depth of feeling that found response
in the minds of the audience.
Line of March.
Starting from the council room, the
processional, led by the marshalls,
Professors Harold Chapman Brown
and John Pearce Mitchell, proceeded
| directly across the Quad to the church.
| The Advisory Board of the Alumni
I Association came first in line, and
were followed by the Academic Coun
cil, Registrar O. L. Elliott, Chaplain
David Charles Gradner, Chancellor
j Jordan. President Wilbur, President
Xewhall, of the Board of Trustees, and
j the Board of Trustees, in order.
In his introductory remarks. Dr.
I Jordan said:
"Almost a quarter of a century ago
j it was my fortune to lie called on to
I assist in the inauguration of a new
! president of Stanford. At that time
I said, 'Our I'niversity has no history
to fall back upon; no memories of
great teachers haunt its corridors. In
I none of its rooms appear the traces
which show where a great man has
j lived and wrought. No tender asso
; ciations cling ivy-like to its fresh new
! walls. It is hallowed by no traditions.
It is hampered by none. Traditions
and associations it is our to make.'
Nov. Have Memories.
"Now all this is changed and von,
Dr. Wilbur, are a part o' this change,
j The memories of great teachers now
I haunt these corridors. Some of these
i have passed to other institutions, and
j some of the greatest have passed away.
Among these, we remember, Miller
'first dead of Stanford's scholars,' War
ner, Thoburn, Richardson, Dudley,
Matzke, Newcomer, Fliigel. Mrs.
Barnes, Bergstrom. with Stearns
Browne, Wriulit and others whose un
timely deaths seemed especially sad
There is ivy on our walls now, in
spiritual if not in botanical fact. Tra
ditions there are in abundance, hal
lowing for the most part but some
times hampering. The Stanford spirit
is a finger post which still points for
ward, even though it may no longer
lie true as we boasted to the President
of Harvard twenty-five years ago that
I Stanford has not a single graduate of
whom she is ashamed.' There may lie
one or two now, but not many. Of
her graduates Stanford is proud and
not ashamed.
"Stanford lias her traditions now,
those that hallow and tiiose that ham
per. You have been with us, Dr. Wil
bur, twenty-four years, long enough
to know these kinds apart. To the
keenness of a scholar, an administra
tor, a man of the world, you add the
loyalty of an alumnus. For these rea
sons, and for more, I am happy and
proud as a representative of our Uni
versity, of its very first class in fact,
| to place in your hands the insignia of
j office, the signs of responsibility, the
i keys that open and can never
the doors that lead to wisdom, effi
ciency and loyal service.
A message of congratulations was
today received by President Wilbur
from his predecessor, Dr. John Casper
Pranner, who is now on the high seas
enroute for Panama.
