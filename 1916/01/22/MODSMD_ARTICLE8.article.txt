Stanford is proud of her first
alumnus president, both for his own
personality and because he is one of
our large family. Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur has already won our confidence
during the short period of his term
in office which has passed.
His installation marks the fourth
milestone in the progress toward put
ting the University in the hands of its
graduates. The first were passed
when three alumni were successively
elocted to the Board of Trustees â€”
George Edward Crothers, '9~>, who
served on the Board from 1902 to 1908,
Herbert C. Hoover, '9.~>, and Ralph Ar
nold, '99, members of the present
board.
The journey is well started and the
signs of the times point to good pro
gress ahead. May Dr. Wilbur's ad
ministration be prosperous and long
and the end of it see that journey well
near completion.
