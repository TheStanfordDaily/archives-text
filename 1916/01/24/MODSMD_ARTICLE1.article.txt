# DR. BRANNER RETURNS FROM SOJOURN IN PANAMA
## ARRIVES IN NEW YORK CITY Investigating Committee Now Prepared to Report on Canal 
### 
After spending several weeks in
Panama in investigating the condition
of the Cucaracha slide, Dr, John Cas
per Branner today returned to New
York. Together with other prominent
geologists, Dr. Branner was appointed
by President Wilson and the National
Academy of Science, to investigate the
geological conditions of the great
slides which have been tying up the
transportation on the canal. The
committee is now ready to report to
the president of the National Academy
of Science, who will in turn render a
report of the committee's findings to
President Wilson.
Professor Willis Explains.
Professor Bailey Willis, head of the
Stanford Geology department, who is
familiar with the conditions prevail
ing in the canal zone, today explained
the magnitude of the trouble that the
canal engineers have been experi
encing.
"Over ten million cubic yards of
earth and rock have slipped into the
Culebra Cut via the Cucaracha Slide,
during and following the excavation
between Gold Hill and Contractor's
Hill, at the summit of the Isthmus,"
said Professor Willis. "The rock
formations around these hills, which
tower to a height of three hundred
and fifty feet on either side of the
canal, are of soft clay, and contain a
substance which swells when it be
comes moistened. The clay, thus
loosened, takes in the torrential rains
until it becomes almost liquid. The
whole mass of clay is not affected at
once, but there are sliding planes
through which the water penetrates,
causing groat bodies of clay to
loose and slide into the canal.
"The problem of handling the enor
mous masses of material which are
continually sliding into the canal is
a serious one, involving the cost of
several millions of dollars. It was in
the hope that the geologists and
physicists would be able to devise
means to prevent further sliding, that
the committee of which I)r. Branner
was a member was sent to the canal.
Control of Slides.
"There seem to be several ways to
control the slides. Stop the soaking
rains. Solidify the clay. Suspend the
force of gravity. Any one of these
will do the trick. And the canal en
gineers have been putting all of them
into practice. By letting the slides
slide, they drain and become imper
vious; they undergo chemical changes
and they become inert; and they set
tle so that gravity no longer affects
them dangerously. The engineers are
letting them slide till they are dead,
in the principle that the only, good
slide is a dead slide."

After spending several weeks in
Panama in investigating the condition
of the Cucaracha slide, Dr, John Cas
per Branner today returned to New
York. Together with other prominent
geologists, Dr. Branner was appointed
by President Wilson and the National
Academy of Science, to investigate the
geological conditions of the great
slides which have been tying up the
transportation on the canal. The
committee is now ready to report to
the president of the National Academy
of Science, who will in turn render a
report of the committee's findings to
President Wilson.
Professor Willis Explains.
Professor Bailey Willis, head of the
Stanford Geology department, who is
familiar with the conditions prevail
ing in the canal zone, today explained
the magnitude of the trouble that the
canal engineers have been experi
encing.
"Over ten million cubic yards of
earth and rock have slipped into the
Culebra Cut via the Cucaracha Slide,
during and following the excavation
between Gold Hill and Contractor's
Hill, at the summit of the Isthmus,"
said Professor Willis. "The rock
formations around these hills, which
tower to a height of three hundred
and fifty feet on either side of the
canal, are of soft clay, and contain a
substance which swells when it be
comes moistened. The clay, thus
loosened, takes in the torrential rains
until it becomes almost liquid. The
whole mass of clay is not affected at
once, but there are sliding planes
through which the water penetrates,
causing groat bodies of clay to
loose and slide into the canal.
"The problem of handling the enor
mous masses of material which are
continually sliding into the canal is
a serious one, involving the cost of
several millions of dollars. It was in
the hope that the geologists and
physicists would be able to devise
means to prevent further sliding, that
the committee of which I)r. Branner
was a member was sent to the canal.
Control of Slides.
"There seem to be several ways to
control the slides. Stop the soaking
rains. Solidify the clay. Suspend the
force of gravity. Any one of these
will do the trick. And the canal en
gineers have been putting all of them
into practice. By letting the slides
slide, they drain and become imper
vious; they undergo chemical changes
and they become inert; and they set
tle so that gravity no longer affects
them dangerously. The engineers are
letting them slide till they are dead,
in the principle that the only, good
slide is a dead slide."
