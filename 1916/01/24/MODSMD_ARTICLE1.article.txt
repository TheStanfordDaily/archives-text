# DR. BRANNER RETURNS FROM SOJOURN IN PANAMA
## ARRIVES IN NEW YORK CITY Investigating Committee Now Prepared to Report on Canal 
### 
After spending several weeks in
Panama in investigating the condition
of the Cucaracha slide, Dr, John Cas
per Branner today returned to New
York. Together with other prominent
geologists, Dr. Branner was appointed
by President Wilson and the National
Academy of Science, to investigate the
geological conditions of the great
slides which have been tying up the
transportation on the canal. The
committee is now ready to report to
the president of the National Academy
of Science, who will in turn render a
report of the committee's findings to
President Wilson.
Professor Willis Explains.
Professor Bailey Willis, head of the
Stanford Geology department, who is
familiar with the conditions prevail
ing in the canal zone, today explained
the magnitude of the trouble that the
canal engineers have been experi
encing.
"Over ten million cubic yards of
earth and rock have slipped into the
Culebra Cut via the Cucaracha Slide,
during and following the excavation
between Gold Hill and Contractor's
Hill, at the summit of the Isthmus,"
said Professor Willis. "The rock
formations around these hills, which
tower to a height of three hundred
and fifty feet on either side of the
canal, are of soft clay, and contain a
substance which swells when it be
comes moistened. The clay, thus
loosened, takes in the torrential rains
until it becomes almost liquid. The
whole mass of clay is not affected at
once, but there are sliding planes
through which the water penetrates,
