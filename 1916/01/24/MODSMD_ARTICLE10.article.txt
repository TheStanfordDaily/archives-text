# TELEPHONE TRANSMITS GOTHAM GREETINGS TO PRESIDENT
## INFORMALITY FEATURES DAY Feeling That Dr. Wilbur Is "Just One of Us" Is Paramount 
### 
"Say, David, we ran in a new presi
dent, todayâ€”Ray Wilbur. Yon re
member him, don't you? The long,
lanky fellow, the one that painted
the U. S. government postofflce red, in
the old days. And say, David; it was
great."
Thus did Chancellor David Starr
Jordan describe the installation of
Stanford's new president to Professor
David Marx, listening in New York,
over one of the longest telephone con
nections ever made.
Chancellor Sounds Keeling.
The Chancellor's words sound the
tone of feeling of everyone after the
bars of official ceremony liavo been
let down and alumni and classmates
of Dr. Wilbur had cast formality to
the winds to express their joy at the
selection of the new leader by calling
him Ray instead of Doctor or Presi
dent Wilbur.
Informality characterized the brief
reception to Dr. Wilbur in the
Women's Club House, it marked the
greetings and yells on the inner Quad
directly after the final processional
ended the official part of the inaugu
ration, and it was a feature of the
telephone conversations with New
York alumni. Incidentally, it might
be said that informality brings good
fellowship. It did Saturday after
noon.
"Just One of l"s. w
Hack of it all was the feeling on the
part of everyone present that Stan
ford's new president is, as several peo
pie styled it, "just one of us" who has
risen from the ranks, but who has not
forgotten the problems that every
I alumnus has faced, that students now
have, and that future students will
; have to meet. The general trend of
feelings expressed by actions and
words, was one of confidence in the
Board of Trustees' choice of Dr. Wil
bur to guide the destinies of Stanford
j for the coming years.
Address by Telephone.
Probably the most notable incident
that has featured the inauguration of
any University president in the world
! to date was the delivery by Dr. Wilbur
|of his inauguration address here at
[ Stanford to be heard over the tele
phone by a hundred alumni seated at
, a banquet in New York, and receiving
the assurance the moment the speech
was over from these same alumni
I that they were entirely in sympathy
with his plans and pledged them
selves to his support. Certainly it is
! the first time that such a connection
: between alumni and the University
has ever been made in such a novel
and satisfactory way.
Words Clear and Distinct.
Clearly and distinctly every word
i was heard over the telephone, and
; reports from New York arrived with
just as much volume as those from
Palo Alto. The telephone ceremony
was ably managed by John J. Carty
j and Professor Harris J. Ryan, in
whose honor the connection was made
by the American Telephone and Tele
j graph Company, and the line was not
i disconnected from the time that the
first weather report arrived from New
| York until the last strain of "Hail!
Stanford, Hail!" marked the close of
one of the historical and eventful days
; of Stanford's life, when the first Stan
ford man to become president was
ushered into his new realm of work.
