### 
Regardless of whether the student
bodies of Stanford and California vote
to resume intercollegiate relations,
the soccer teams of the two universi
ties will clash in at least one and pos
sibly two games this spring. As mem
bers of the University and Club Soccer
Football League the teams will play
off the final round to decide the cham
pionship of the series, without being
subject to any rule regarding tho
elimination of freshmen.
According to the present standing,
Stanford is one game ahead of Cali
fornia, and it is necessary to win
only one of the remaining two con
tests, which were scheduled for last
November, but postponed to this se
mester at the request of California.
The dates on which tbe games will bo
played will he decided at a meeting to
be held Thursday of the California and
Stanford representatives.
In appreciation of the added attrac
tion that the games of last semester af
forded Exposition goers, the officials
of the Fair donated medals to he
awarded to the members of the win
ning team. These medals have been
received by 11. W. Maloney, president
of the league, and are being held by
him until the championship has been
decided.
In speaking of the coming games
with California, Coach Maloney said
that the outlook for Stanford was very
doubtful. He said: "California has
the best chance this year that it has
ever had before and a hard-fought
match will undoubtedly result. Also,
the California student body is getting
behind and supporting the team and
consequently more interest is being
taken in soccer and a better showing
is being constantly made.
"Owing to the fact that Basketball
Captain Blodget has had to give up
soccer the team will be considerably
weakened. However, a number of
Varsity football men have signified
their intention of coming out, among
whom are Art Erb and .toe Braden,and
everything possible will be done to put
the team in the best of condition for
the games with California."
