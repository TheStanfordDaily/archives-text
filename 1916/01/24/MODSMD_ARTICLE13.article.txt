Considering the many privileges of
fered to members of The Union, and
the small fee which is charged for
membership, it's little wonder that
the club rooms are popular. And
since The Union is a popular place
and many men gather there every
day, it ought to be a self-evident truth
that the membership role of the or
ganization is long.
Men who do not join The Union
could formerly be classified under two
heads â€”those who could not afford to
pay the dues charged, and those who
did not care enough about the place
to come around. But a third class has
been added, and therein lies the fal
lacy of the above self-evident truth.
This class includes the men who hab
itually enjoy the privileges of The
Union without joining.
Of course, this class is not large, but
when an investigation discloses that
four men out of a group of seven in
the billiard room are not yet mem
bers of The Union, the evil is serious
enough to bear thinking about.
This is too early in the semester to
cast aspersions on the man who fre
quents the club rooms when not a
member, for he doubtlessly intends to
sign up. There is no need of violent
measures or of anybody being kicked
out. All chance of difficulties will be
avoided if every man thinks about
whether or not he is a member when
he enters the building, and pays his
dues at the cigar store, if he is not.
The mind of the student is inquisi
tive. The learning of the ages is ours,
because, down through the centuries,
scholars have not been content to
glance on the surface of things.
They have looked deep to seek out
the truths that lie bidden beneath. A
throng of Stanford students has
joined this eager band of investigators
to the detriment of the poker chips in
The Union.
They seek to solve the mystery sur
rounding the composition of the little
round counters. The result in the
amount of knowledge gained is in
finite, but in terms of poker chips re
maining in The Union, zero, for th-ey
tear the counters to pieces in making
their research. The management of
The Union will continue to furnish
poker chips for use in the club rooms
with a request that investigators
will supply themselves with the ob
jects of research elsewhere.
