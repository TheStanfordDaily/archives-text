Original ( harts
Presented Stanford.
According to a letter recently re
ceived by the Engineering department,
the original charts worked out by Pro
lessor Peddle of the Rose Polytechnic
School of Terre Haute, which were
prepared by using the result of the
experiments of Professor Marx on the
strength of gear teeth, will be sent to
Stanford for the use of the Engineer
ing department.
Both the report of experiments of
Professor Marx, which were done in
conjunction with Professor Cutter,
and the charts of Professor Peddle,
were published in the December and
January numbers of the American
Machinist.
California Basketball
Captain Out of Came.
Captain Norton of the University of
California basketball team will pro')--
ably lie out of (lie game for the re
mainder of the season, as a bone in
iiis wrist was broken in the last game
with Washington, on the recent north
ern trip. It is expected that his ab
sence from the lineup will be a se
vere handicap to the Berkeley team.
However, matters are helped out for
the Blue and Gold quintet by the ap
pearance of Roy Sharp on the courts.
The former star football player has
been unable to don a suit so far this
season, on account of breaking bis
arm in the last football game. Sharp
is said to lie a fast and aggressive
player.
Success of
Engineering Graduates.
Word has been received by the Civil
Engineering department of the suc
cess of four of its former students,
John I. Thompson, '09, was recently
made Assistant Engineer of the H.
Koppers Co., of Pittsburg, Penn., one
of the large firms in the east dealing
in coke ovens and other manufactur
ies of the steel industry. This is a
big position for a relatively young
engineer, as is shown by the fact that
this firm has already contracts calling
for $12,000,000 in work for the coming
year.
C. L. Addleman, '15, F. Olmstead,
and B. M. Green, '15, have posi
tions with the same firm.
Oregon Women
Want Club House.
The women at the University of
Oregon are trying to raise money for
a clubhouse, similar in idea to the
Women's Club House at Stanford.
Likewise, dances are given to swell
the fund.
Professor Young Hack
From New York.
Professor S. W. Young of the Chem
istry department recently returned
from New York City, where he visited
relatives. While there Professor
Young spent several days with Pro
fessor Zinsser, formerly professor of
bacteriology at this University, and
who is now professor of bacteriology
at the College of Physicians and Sur
geons in New York.
Amateur Standing
Mot Injured.
Close athletic followers were great
ly pleased by the recent reports of
high officials on amateur standing,
stating that it was their belief that
the recent entrance of such stars as
Maurice McLoughlin, Tom Bandy, and
Francis Ouimet, into the sporting
goods business will not affect their
standing as competing amateurs. It
was at first thought that the selling
of athletic goods of the same type that
the athlete himself used was an ad
vertisement and would thus profes
sionalize the seller, but the latest
ruling-holds that an athlete solely en
gaged in a sporting goods business
and not merely using his athletic rep
utation as an advertisement, is not a
professional.
