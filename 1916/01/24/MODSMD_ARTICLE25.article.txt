# Gym Club Men Make Merry For Indoor Carnival Crowd
## 
### 
The Gym Club Carnival which was
held last Friday evening, was much
appreciated by a fair-sized crowd.
Miss Dorothy Metz, '17, and E. R
Knollin, gr., gave an exhibition of the
Argentine Tango, which showed care
ful practice. The California and Stan
ford Gym Clubs combined in work on
the horizontal bars, rings, parallel
liars and horse. The Stanford Club
gave some splendid exhibitions of py
ramid building and tumbling. Miss
Paris and the members of the Iloble
Gymnasium class proved quite an at
traction in their gymnasium dancing.
Ernest Brandsten, swimming instruc
tor, sent a thrill through the crowd
with his eleven-foot high jump from
the springboard, as well as some
other difficult stunts.
A Stanford record was broken and
a world's record tied in the pentathe
lon events, W. R. Wheatly, '17, being
responsible for both. He won the hig.i
dive at five feet ten inches, which
equals the world's record in that
event. Me also took the running higu
kick at eight feet eleven inches,
which establishes a new Stanford rec
ord. W. F. Dingley, 'IG, won the stand
ing high jump at four feet five inches.
Wheatly took the standing broad jump
at nine feet eight inches. M. M. Kirk
sey won the fifty-yard dash.
