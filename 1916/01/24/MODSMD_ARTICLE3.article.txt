Taking for his subject "Human
Life and Time," and addressing es
pecially the men of Stanford, Dr, Al
bert Parker Fitch preached his second
sermon to a large congregation in the
Memorial Church, yesterday.
"Time," according to Dr. Fitch, "is
one of the most elusive and fascin
ating things in life. Nowhere does
the fundamental consciousness be
tween youth and age so show itself
as in their view of time. The great
difference between the man in college
and the man when he steps out to
face the world is that very few stud
ents have enough imagination to
think of the time beyond old age. but
when those students face the world
they begin to realize that life is never
beginning but always becoming—that
the very motto of life is the passion
of unfulfilled desires."
lin permanency of Life.
Life should not be viewed as an
"ironic procession with the .laughter
of the past as a background," said
Dr. Fitch. "It is impermanent —•
but its very impermanency should
give it a fascination. Everything
worth while has the perishable ele

living is the one that conquers time.
Means of Conquering Time.
"There are three ways of conquer

loves the beautiful and takes a delight
in perfect objects—when he truly has
that supreme passion of love, he has
set eternity in his heart. Then he can
say, 'I have conquered time.'
"Again he can say it when he has
so given himself to some great institu
tion as to become identified with it,
when he is a part of a great work.
"And in living for the things that
time can never touch, a man can, in
the third way, conquer time. If the
human race has learned anything, it
is that there is no such thing as
quantity but that it is quality tint
overcomes all things.
"Be free and joyous and unafraid
as time comes on, and of the end bo
able to say the best is yet to be.
Then, and only then, will you be ready
for the larger life on the other side."
