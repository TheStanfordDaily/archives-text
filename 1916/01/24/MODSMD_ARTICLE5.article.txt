# RAIN STOPS BASEBALL SEASON OPENING SATURDAY
## FRESHMEN TIE VARSITY, 3-3 Two Games Per Week Scheduled From Now on During Entire Season 
### 
Weather conditions being far from
favorable, the lirst scheduled baseball
game of the 1916 season was called off
at a late hour last Saturday afternoon.
Tommy Sheehan, who is now leading
the Ireland's Independents, was also
finding it hard to gather together a
suitable team to meet the Cardinal, as
many of the leaguers have not re
turned to San Francisco yet.
Freshmen I'lay Varsity.
Excellent ball was served to the few
fans who braved the afternoon show
ers, however, by the Varsity and
freshmen teams. The final score after
nine innings of play, was 3 to 3, the
tie not being played off on account of
darkness. The freshman squad was
augmented by three men from last
season's second string players, and
put up a good game throughout.
Starting in with one run in the first
frame, when Lander, the first man up,
after receiving free transportation to
first, went the round on a sacrifice
fly, a fielder's choice, and an error,
the Varsity made one run an inning
for three frames. Sanburn and Dent
registered the other two scores. The
first year team failed to tally until the
sixth inning, when they brought two
across the pan, on a base on balls, two
bingles and a fielder's choice. These
runs were made by Payson and Mitch
ell. Their last score was made in tho
seventh, when Mitchell chalked up his
second run after a hit, a stolen base
and a long single.
Hitting Liirlit.
There was little hitting in the game,
especially on the part of tho Varsity
nine. They connected for but three
singles off the deliveries of Mattel and
Wickersharn, while the freshmen ob
tained eight hits on the teasers of
Hoover and Howe. Mitchell landed
three singles, and Messick two, the
other liits of the day being scattered
one to a man. Considering the early
time of tlie year, the baseball pros
pects, as demonstrated by Saturday's
play, loom up brightly. Lander and
Hayes both played well in positions
I that they are not accustomed to liold
ing down, and the rest of the team,
I with one or two exceptions, showed
excellent form.
Although the schedule will not be
I announced for a day or two, games
will be played twice a week, and prac
i tice will be held every night,
liineiips for Saturday's <«aine.
