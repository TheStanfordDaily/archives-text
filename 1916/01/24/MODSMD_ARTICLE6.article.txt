"There is nothing whatsoever
that is as maximum as my undying
ambition to see the resumption, re
commencement, and eternal con
tinuance of intercollegiate rela
' i° ns - —"Pop" Kessler.

Assuming an attitude of confident
poise, between two rows of cheering
tables, "Pop" Kessler, scholar,
teacher, orator, missionary, and Har
vard graduate, won his way into the
hearts of over eighty men of Stanford
and California, with a fiery, yet sin
cere, burst of eloquence, at the first
annual publications banquet of the
two universities, held at Kessler's
Cafe, Saturday evening.
"Pop" Kessler acted in the triple
capacity of Mine Host, Ye Entertainer,
and Ye Pace-Setter. He bound to
gether the assembled multitude with
unbreakable sinews of good-fellow
ship. He converted four-score more
or less unacquainted units into a
seething mass of companions-ln
laughter. Speaking from "unselfish
motives" entirely, Kessler voiced a
eulogy to the colleges and an appeal
for the resumption of the "bis; game.'"
that brought forth applause and cries
of "More! More!" from both factions.
There will in all probability be
"more" next year.
