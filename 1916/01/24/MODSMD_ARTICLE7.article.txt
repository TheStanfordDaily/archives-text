# TENNIS MATCH WITH CALIFORNIA IS PLAN
## Eight Men Chosen by Captain Hutchinson as Members of Varsity Squad 
### 
With better weather conditions pre
vailing, the number of tennis players
on the courts has greatly increased.
Also, the prospects of a tournament
with the University of California rac
quet artists seems to have served as
an added incentive.
Tennis Captain J. S. Hutchinson,
'lti, has announced that the following
men will compose the Varsity squad
at present, although changes may be
made during the season: V. A. Shel
don, '17, IT. L. Hahn, *1(5, J. S. Hutch
inson, '16, Allan Barber, '18, H. V.
Johns, '18, and C. Wolford, '18, K.
Hawks, '19, and G. Clover, '19, will
both be on the Varsity squad, but on
account of being first year men, will,
of course, be ineligible for the Cali
fornia tournament. The final tennis
team will probably be chosen from
these men.
Besides the intercollegiate tourna
ment with the Berkeley delegation,
the team may be sent south during
the spring vacation. If the Los An
geles trip is made a certainty the
Ojaii Valley tournament will have to
be omitted from this season's sched
ule.
