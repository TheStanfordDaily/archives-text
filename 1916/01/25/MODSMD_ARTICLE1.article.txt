# CLEAN-UP FOR TRACK TEAM ASSURED BY VETERANS
## MATERIAL FOR ALL EVENTS Hurdles and Quarter Will Be Cardinals' Strongest Bets For This Season 
### 
Resuming of spring sports with the
University of California coupled with
the fact that a tfreat number of the
last season's veterans are back, points
to a very lively season for Stanford.
Healing the break with California lias
not only acted as an added stimulus
to the track aspirants at Stanford,
but has also set the public to wonder
ing .just what Stanford possesses in
the line of speed burners and strong
men.
Men For All Events.
Practically every event is positive
of having many candidates. In the
hurdles will be found Feg Murray,
who has made a name both for him
self and Stanford already. As a team
mate of Murray is to be found veteran
Johnny Norton, In the hurdles is also
to be found House, the freshman,
known for work in Southern Cali
fornia schools.
In the 100-yard dash will be found
the veteran Dick Grant and the fresh
men, Flote and Wark, who have run
the race in 10 flat. In the 440 are
Aupperle and Beale, with Wright
Lynn as running mate. Bob Pelouze,
who showed some speed in football,
bids fair to put it to a good advant
age in the quarter. Much new ma
terial has signed for this event, which
gives birth to the hunch that the 440
â€¢will be one of the season's strongest
bets.
In the weights, Bihlman and Reg
Caughey loom as strong possibilities.
Bihlman this season is out for blood
