# ECONOMICS STUDENTS MUST MEET REQUIREMENTS
## SCHOLARSHIP TO BE HIGHER New Plan Will Take Effect With Beginning of Fall Semester 
### 
That attendance at classes for four
years and sufficient absorption of sub
jects taught to obtain one hundred
and twenty hours of passing grades
is not enough to obtain a degree from
the University is the new stand taken
by the Economics department, which
has adopted a system of honor points
which candidates for graduation must
pass, in addition to the usual depart
mental requirements. The new plan
will be explained by Doctor Murray S.
Wildman, head of the Economics de
partment, at the "Econ Smoker" in
the Union, tomorrow night.
Hours Alone Not Sufficient.
A plan, which will substantially
modify the conditions for graduation
in the Economics department, was
adopted by the faculty of that depart
ment, at a recent meeting. It is
thought that the mere fulfilling of the
requirements that are necessary to
graduate is not sufficient. It is un
just to treat the student who grad
uates with high marks the same as
the student who barely gets passing
grades throughout his college career.
Two Conditions For Degree.
After September Ist the department
will lay down two conditions that
must be met before a student is award
ed the degree of Bachelor of Arts.
First, he must have 120 unit hours to
his credit, and second, he must have
the "recommendation of the depart-
I ment." The department is left with a.
! wide range of discretion in determin-
ing what conditions are requisite for
this recommendation.
Honor l'oiuts Necessary.
A system of honor points has been
adopted as supplementary to the cus
tomary unit hours. To get the de
partmental recommendation, a stud
ent must have not only 120 unit hours,
but 120 honor points. These are
earned in the following manner:
Each unit Hour obtained in any course
with a grade of "A" will give the
student three honor points. A grade
of "B" gives two points, one of "C,"
one point, and a "D" mark, none. For
each hour in which a student is con
ditioned, he will be credited with
minus one, and for each hour of fail
ure, minus two points.
Will liaise Economics Standard.
To graduate, a student must aver
age a grade of 'C" or change his
major department. Transferred hours
will be regarded as "C" hours, unless
there be ample evidence that higher
rank should be given them. This new
plan will work a hardship on some
students, but will undoubtedly help
the Economics department to raise its
standards of scholarship.
The Economics Club, made up of
high standing upperclassmen in the
Economics department, is strongly be
hind the faculty in the recent action.
