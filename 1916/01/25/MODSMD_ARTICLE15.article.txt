Need For Dormitories
President Wilbur indicated the need
of more dormitories at Stanford in his
talk to the students on last Friday
morning, and the Board of Trustees
is considering the problem of housing
all students of the University on the
campus. But a boost for the move
ment even at this late stage in its
development will not do any harm.
Most of the men who come to Stan
ford face the choice of living on the
campus and paying exorbitant room
rent, or living in Palo Alto. And
even at that the desire to be in close
touch with University affairs, and the
recognition of the advantages of liv
ing on the campus fills all of the
available rooms.
Some Stanford people may live in
Palo Alto because they prefer it. Un
doubtedly many of the commuters
would continue to live off campus
even if enough dormitories were pro
vided for everybody. But many peo
ple in these two classes will move
onto the campus just as soon as there
is enough room for them here. This
is especially true if the new rooms
are provided at the same reasonable
prices at which Encina rooms are
rented, considering the rapidity with
which high priced rooming house
accommodations are snapped up.
The desire for another dormitory
for the men living off campus is evi
dent. The need for them is expressed
in the reports of the Student Coun
cil and the Student Adviser. The at
tractiveness as well as the advant
ages of having all of the students liv
ing together in one college commun
ity is the final argument in its favor.
