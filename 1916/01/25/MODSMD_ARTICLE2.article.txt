# Condition of Life in Europe Is Low
## Professor Seward Gives Impression That Condition Is Due to Ignorance 
### 
"The saddest impression that one
biings from an European residence,
is that a large body of people ac
cepts as final a condition of life lower
than it need be, that the InivMuals
are not trying to develop their per
sonality,*' says Professor S. S. Sew
ard, of tlie Department of English,
who says that it is exhilirating to be
hack at Stanford among live, ambi
tious, intelligent people.
"European society tends to become
stratified. The people of one class sel
dom break over and mix with the peo
ple of the next, but are rigidly re
stricted in their social intercourse."
As American delegate, Professor Sew
ard was able to be with the people,
to go from (me social group fo an
other, regardless of these artificial
restrictions.
"It is difficult to realize this condi
tion when one is here at Stanford,
where everybody is improving him
self. where the doors of opportunity
swing open easily. In this country
generally every laborer has his ideal,
good or bad, Which makes for a divine
discontent leading to something bet
ter. This element in our American
life which leads toward turbulence,
has its hopeful side."
According to Professor Seward,
"the contrast in certain agricultural
sections of Europe is most depressing.
The peasant follows in the steps ot
his father, as his son will follow
him. There is no feeling of looking
forward to a constructive improve
ment, in life. If there is reform, it is
not the result of an active demand on
the part of the peasants themselves,
! but of some faint paternal liuman
itarianism. The peasant takes it for
granted that he always will be a peas
ant and does not strive to realize his
individuality by reaching out for bet
ter things.
"It is a stimulating experience to
come from an old-world civilization
and realize afresh the healthy, hope
ful. striving hat is the spirit of our
j western life."
