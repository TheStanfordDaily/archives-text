# "Poland Needs Relief," Says Professor Keliogg
## Cosmoplitan Club Hears of Conditions in Europe From Stanford Lecturer 
### 
A goodly number of professors and
students gathered at the Union, last
night, to attend the meeting of the
Cosmoplitan Club, and to hear Pro
fessors Seward and Kellogg speak of
their work in Belgian Relief.
Professor Kellogg outlined his
work from the time lie was stationed
in Brussels, and later moved to
Northern France, until he finally ar
rived in Poland. He state that the
conditions in Poland are more deplor
able than those in Belgium, because
no relief work has been organized
there. Professor Kellogg mentioned
the fact that he was constantly ac
companied on every move by a Ger
man officer.
Professor Seward, who was stationed
in a small district of northeast Bel
gium, came into closer touch with
existing conditions and related many
personal experiences. He made a
particular point of the gratitude of
the Belgians and exhibited speci
mens of embroidery given him by the
Belgian women. This work was done
on flour sacks and the designs were
of the American flag with fitting Bel
gian sentiments beneath. The people
of that little country are fast learn
ing to love America, and, he stated,
have already learned to sing the "Star
Spangled Banner" in English.
