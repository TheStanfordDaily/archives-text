### 
Seats for Masquer's presentation
of Barrie's "Rosalind," J. Hartley
Manner's "Happiness," and "Hop
O' My Thumb," by Richard Price
and Frederic Fenn, will be placed
on sale one week from today, at
the Bookstore and at Weingart
ner's, in Palo Alto, at 1:10 p.m.
Tickets will be fifty, seventy-five
cents, and one dollar.

You wouldn't enjoy the plays, if
we told you all about them. Be
sides, .J. M. Barrie can relate his
story much better than any of those
present. But nobody reads dra
matic write-ups, so here goes: His
"Flosalind" is clever, captivating,
and carnivorous—the last meaning
that when you see it acted, you are
so impressed by the compact cute
ness of the play, that you want to
eat everyone around you. "Rosa
lind" hasn't much to do with Bill
Shakespeare's famous character,
who inspired the "all-the-wurruld's
a-stage" stuff.
"Rosalind," by J. M. B. (sounds
like coffee) tells about a lady ac
tress who is suffering from popn
laritis, and is tired of being young
and beautiful, and petted and kissed
(perhaps); she goes out into the
country, changes her clothes and
shoes and stockings for larger ones,
and gets by as a middle-aged lady
—gets by as her daughter's mother.
"R" by J. M. B. is also the story of
a poor dub who is in love with the
lady actress, (or rather her photo
graph). Of course, he—she—to
gether—and later on—no, they
don't! Not while they're in the
book, anyway! Oh, no!
