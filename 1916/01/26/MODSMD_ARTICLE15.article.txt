# Dr.A.P. Fitch to Discuss Ideals of College Men
## 
### 
"What a Man Comes to College
For" is the subject upon which Dr.
Albert Parker Fitch will address the
men students of the University in
Encina Hall, next Sunday night, at
7:30. When interviewed, Dr. Fitch
said that he chose this subject be
cause it was broad and allowed of
plenty of freedom. If there is any
thing Dr. Fitch dislikes it is the nar
row, cut-and-dried address that stud
ents are sometimes wont to associate
with Sunday night meetings.
With a twinkle in his eye that de
noted a rather perfect understanding
of some of the causes that bring men
to college, in that delightfully inter
esting, partly humorous, way that is
peculiarly his own, Dr. Fitch gave an
inkling of some of the things that lie
will speak about next Sunday.
Dr. Fitch has had a varied experi
ence with American college students,
having been a speaker and visitor at
practically every college and univer
sity cast of the Mississippi river.
Drawing upon this abundant experi
ence, Dr. Fitch will endeavor to pic
ture to bis hearers what lie believes
to be the ideal of the American col
lege student, and how this ideal seems
to be observed in the west, as dis
tinguished from the cast.
