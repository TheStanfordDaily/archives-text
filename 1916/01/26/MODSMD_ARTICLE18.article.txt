Everyone has hoard arguments
sufficient to make even the women
want to join the Union. So now let's
talk about the Club House. It's true
that the addition of the cafe in the
Union is an added attraction to the
equipment of that building, but what
need is there for such an addition in
the Club House? Commuters' patron
age would not pay expenses. More
worry would burden the directors'
shoulders.
A campaign for new members held
last week did not result in $l.. r >o dues
to the number of five hundred rolling
into the treasurer's account. Hard
work 011 the part of the board did
bring a number of subscriptions over
the few received from those who real
ized the benefits derived and joined
voluntarily.
Some there are who never enter
the Club House. The more shame
upon them; public gatherings, alumni
teas, "get-togethers," and organiza
tion meetings are being held there
more than frequently.
The question now is not whether
individuals think that they receive too
few advantages from membership I a
the Club House, but whether they
would be willing to see the building
closed. This would mean that it had
been opened and closed while the
present Sophomores, Juniors, and
Seniors were here. And each one of
us was to be proud of having aided
the future Stanford women by help
ing the opening. Now, if it closes,
how are we to feel? —A. M.
