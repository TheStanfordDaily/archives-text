# NEW METALLURGY COURSE DEALS WITH FLOTATION
## Professors Clevenger and Young to Have Charge of New Mining Study 
### 
A new metallurgical course will be
given by Professors G. H. Clevenger
and 11. W. Young of the Geology and
Mining department, during the pres
ent semester. This course will deal
with flotation, which is bringing rev
olutionary changes in ore treatment
methods. It will consist of reading,
conferences and laboratory investiga
tion. Special laboratory equipment
has been ordered and an ususually
good assortment of ores is being col
lected for this work. It is particu
larly gratifying that Stanford should
he the first University to announce
such a course, and that Stanford men
in the field, such as Hoover, Nutter,
and Hyde, among others, should be
the most prominent in the develop
ment and introduction of the pro
cess.
