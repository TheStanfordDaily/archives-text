# UNIVERSITY GETS LARGE COLLECTION OF INSECTS
## 
### 
Air. and Mrs. .1. M. Harkins of Chula
Vista have presented to the Depart
ment of Entomology a collection of
about 12,000 insects, obtained by their
son, Athol Wells Harkins, in Santa
Clara and San Diego counties.
Athol Harkins was a child of deli
cate health, who suffered an accident
at the age of seventeen which made
him an invalid for the rest of his
life. He died at twenty-four. During
the lons years of invalidism his chief
solace was the collection, observation
and study of insects. The collection
presented to the University is the re
sult of years of careful work. No
other gift collection of insects has
ever come to the department in which
the specimens were so finely prepared.
The collection is one of unusual
value.
