# GYMNASIUM REGISTRATION SHOWS INCREASE OF 600
## Total of 951 Men Now Out for Physical Trainingâ€”300 Last Year 
### 
Encina Gymnasium claims 650 more
men this year than it did last. The
total number now registered in phy
sical training for men is now 951.
Hut 300 were on the roll at this time
in 1915, showing an increase of 200
per cent in the total attendance.
This increase in itself is sufficient
justification for the expenditure
made, in promise of even greater use
in the future, according to views held
by Dr. Howard Stolz.
The policy of Stanford in widening
the scope of athletic interest within
the school is now given opportunity
for free play, and Dr. Stolz ascribes'
no little part of this stimulation to
the fact that men not regularly en
rolled in any class are encouraged
to use the gymnasium at any time
and may enter any class then in ses
sion. Such voluntary and whole
hearted participation, is, he says, the
ideal of the system, and is to be en
couraged still more.
Eighteen instructors are now being
maintained in the gymnasiums, while
only thirteen were needed to care
for the work last year.
