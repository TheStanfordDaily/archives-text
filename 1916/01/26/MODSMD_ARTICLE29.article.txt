### 
That Stanford will be represented
by a baseball team of no mean ability
this season, is the opinion of the fans
and "would-be dopesters" that have
witnessed the recent workouts of the
Cardinal squad. The men are stronger
in hitting strength, despite the loss of
one of the best sluggers, Tom Work
man. The outfield will have two good
arms and at least two hitters, some
thing that the local team has always
been weak in. Good team-work has
already been displayed, and the whole
squad seems to have plenty of the
"pep" necessary to turn out a winner.

Captain Dent has been handling the
baseball squad in a manner well
worthy of commendation. He has the
men divided into a Varsity squad, a
freshmen squad, and the four teams
of the peanut league, from which the
second varsity is chosen. Every man
who conies out is given a fair oppor
tunity to demonstrate his baseball
ability. Dent spends a great deal of
time instructing new players as to
the tine points.

Cutting out the freshmen would
have worked little hardship on Stan
ford's ball team on ordinary occas
ions, but this season's first year squad
is far better than the aver.ige, and
some weak holes in the Varsity could
be plugged up with these frosh. The
baby team should clean up in its
schedule of panics. The men who
have been cavorting on the first year
lineup, so far, are E. F. Mitchell,
catcher; It. ,T. Mitchell, first; Mes
siek, second; Shriver, third; Cowan,
short; Ryan, left; Lilly, center, and
Reagan, right. No regular pitcher
has been discovered for the first year
men.
