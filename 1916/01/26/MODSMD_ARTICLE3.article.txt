# "Ain't It Awful, Mabel?"
## Curiosity Causes Murder 
### 
Curiosity killed a cat. So the say
ing goes. Curiosity has killed more
time than cats. Curiosity killed a lot
of time this morning—in University
swamp, located between the Law
building and English headquarters.
Nearly three hours were lost, due to
the fact that a curious and fun-loving
woman student wrote a sign and
stuck it on a post, where those who
walk the plank might see and read
and laugh. She just wanted to see
how many would stop, look, and cause
confusion. They did certainly stop
and read. And there was confusion.
Little did the playful young lady reck
how many lives would be sacrificed
in the wanton slaughter of time.
This may sound like Archie Rice,
'95, but it's not. Nevertheless, it's
true.
Number of students who passed
over plank 850
Number who did not read the sign
(10 per cent) 85
Leaving a remainder of 765
Time consumed in stopping and
reading (10 sec. each), 7650 seconds.
7650 seconds are 125 minutes
125 minutes are 2 1-12 hours
Time consumed in thinking up and
writing sign, 10 minutes.
Time consumed in placing sign, 15
minutes.
Total time consumed, 2% hours.
And this is what the sign said:
"Traffic Regulations—Keep to the
right. Don't try to pass the people
ahead of you. Don't stop to talk to
your friends, enemies or secret sor
rows. Keep moving."
Ain't it awful, Anita?
