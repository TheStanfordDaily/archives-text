# Euphronians to Debate
## 
### 
The subject of preparedness will
interest Euphronia tonight when the
members of that society will debate
on the subject, "Resolved: That the
United States should maintain her
navy above third rank in fighting ef
ficiency." This subject is the same
as the one chosen for the Freshmen-
Sophomore and the Tri-State debates.
It. H. French, sp., with N. R. Allen,
'18, will defend the affirmative, and
will be opposed by V. Hyatt, 'If>, and
W. C. Anspach, '17, of the negative.
As this question is one which is
causing much discussion among edu
cators and national leaders, alike, it
is probable that the debate will be
closely contested.
