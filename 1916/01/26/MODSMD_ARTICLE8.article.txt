# Gogorza Program to Include Songs of Many Nations
## 
### 
Tlie faculty for reaching his audi
ences is the supremo sift possessed
by Emilio de Gogorza, the baritone, i
who appears in the Assembly Hall to- I
morrow evening. His art is combined
with a degree of personal magnetism
that as truly as a fine voice, spells
success for the concert artist.
De Gogorza is a native of Brooklyn,
although his parents were both Span
ish. He was educated in Europe,
later returning to this country to con
tinue his study of singing.
His singing possesses a depth and
sympathy that has made him one of
the most beloved of concert artists in
this country. His favorite field is
that of the songs of all countries,
notably those in his native Spanish,
but he usually features his program
with one or two opera arias. Tomor
row evening's program includes two
such numbers in the seldom sung
arias from eighteenth century operas,
the "Air de Thoas" of Gluck, and
Monsigny's "Air du Deserteur."
