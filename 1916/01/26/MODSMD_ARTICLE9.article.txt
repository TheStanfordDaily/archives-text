# CALL OFF ST. IGNATIUS GAME
## Three Stanford Basket Teams to Play Saturday Night 
### 
The basketball game scheduled for
this evening with St. Ignatius has
been called off, due to the fact that
a law examination keeps some of the
night schoolmen at the Catholic col
lege from playing.
On Saturday night the Varsity will
meet the College of the Pacific on the
latter's court. This is the first game
of the conference season for the Stan
ford Varsity and from the brand of
basketball put up by the Pacific boys
so far this season, it should be a stiff
game. At the same time the fresh
man team will meet the Keystone
Club of San Jose, while the second
team will meet the militia team at
Encina Gymnasium.
After a consultation this morning
between Graduate Manager Behrens
and J. A. Younger, graduate manager
of the University of Washington,
February 5 was set as the date on
which Stanford and Washington will
meet in the Cardinal Gymnasium.
Younger is in San Francisco at the
present time in an effort to find a
coach for next year's football team
for Washington.
