# BASEBALL SQUAD LOSES FIRST GAME TO AGNEWS, 4-3
## CLOSE PLAY MARKS CONTEST Cardinals Forced to Take Trip to Foreign Diamond to Meet Opponents 
### 
Stanford Varsity lost the first sched

terday afternoon, to the team repre
senting the Agnew State Hospital, by
a 4 to score, after nine innings of
close play. The game was announced
as being slated for the Stanford dia
mond, but the opposing team found it
impossible to make the trip, so the lo

a late hour, the Cardinal squad jour
neying down the peninsula.
Three Tallies in First.
Starting in witli three runs in the
first inning, on four clean singles by
Hayes, Stafford, Dent, and Noonan,
and an overthrow by the left fielder,
the Varsity seemed to have the day
already won. Things were not to be
so, however, for these were their last
tallies, and the home delegation slow
ly caught up and passed the local
nine, errors being responsible in the
main. Hoover started the heaving for
Stanford, and worked for six innings,
being replaced by Mattei. The big
fellow deserved to win his game, as
he twirled masterly ball at all times,
getting himself out of a number of
tight holes. On one occasion, he
fanned two men with two on the
paths.
A Knows Score in Fourth.
Agnews made their first score in
the fourth frame on a double, a single
and an error by Dickie. In the next
