# BASEBALL SQUAD LOSES FIRST GAME TO AGNEWS, 4-3
## CLOSE PLAY MARKS CONTEST Cardinals Forced to Take Trip to Foreign Diamond to Meet Opponents 
### 
Stanford Varsity lost the first sched
uled baseball game of the season, yes
terday afternoon, to the team repre
senting the Agnew State Hospital, by
a 4 to score, after nine innings of
close play. The game was announced
as being slated for the Stanford dia
mond, but the opposing team found it
impossible to make the trip, so the lo
cation of the contest was changed at
a late hour, the Cardinal squad jour
neying down the peninsula.
Three Tallies in First.
Starting in witli three runs in the
first inning, on four clean singles by
Hayes, Stafford, Dent, and Noonan,
and an overthrow by the left fielder,
the Varsity seemed to have the day
already won. Things were not to be
so, however, for these were their last
tallies, and the home delegation slow
ly caught up and passed the local
nine, errors being responsible in the
main. Hoover started the heaving for
Stanford, and worked for six innings,
being replaced by Mattei. The big
fellow deserved to win his game, as
he twirled masterly ball at all times,
getting himself out of a number of
tight holes. On one occasion, he
fanned two men with two on the
paths.
A Knows Score in Fourth.
Agnews made their first score in
the fourth frame on a double, a single
and an error by Dickie. In the next
inning, they added two more tallies
on but one single and a sacrifice,
coupled with two wild pegs let loose
by Stafford and Stevens. This tied up
the score. Not in the lucky seventh,
but in the next spasm, the sixth, was
the game stowed away by the Hospital
nine. Hoover started the inuing with
his first walk of the game. Bert
Lynn, who goes to the Chicago White
Sox next season, stepped into the
next ball thrown for a double, a splen
did peg by Sanburn holding the men
on second and third, respectively. An
attempted squeeze play failed, the
runner being trapped at the home
plate. The next man up, however,
slammed a hard one into the infield,
and Lynn came home on a fielder's
choice, putting his team one tally to
the good.
Stanford made a desperate stand in
the last inning, Hayes getting his
third hit of the day, after one down, .1
two-bagger to deep center. He was
trapped between second and third on
an infield hit by Stafford, and with
Dent flying out to center field, the
game ended. The box score follows:
