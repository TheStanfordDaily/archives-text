# BASKETBALL RAISED TO MAJOR SPORT STANDING
## IS ONLY INDOOR MAJOR GAME Ram's Head to Co-operate With Associated Students to Give Track Show 
### 
Basketball was raised to the dig
nity of a major sport by motion of
the Executive Committee at its meet
ing last evening. Hereafter the men
who make the Cardinal quintet and
play in two of the three games against
the Blue and Gold will be awarded
a block "S" instead of a circle.
Reasons for Change.
This action was taken after a thor
ough consideration of the arguments
for and against such a change. Those
who favored the proposition empha
sized the fact that most of the east
ern universities and practically all
of the larger schools on the coast
have already made basketball a major
sport. In all probability California
will make the change within the near
future.
A Hard Sport.
Furthermore, it was argued that
basketball is a hard sport and the
men who play it deserve recognition.
There is a squad of eighty men out
for the sport this season. It is be
coming more popular every year, and
is a big feature in all the high schools.
If it remained a minor sport at Stan
ford. many good athletes might be in-
duced to so to other universities. The
change takes place at once.
There was some discussion concern
ing the advisability of giving a dif
ferent style of letter for the various
sports, in order to show how the em
blem was earned. Nothing was de
cided, however, the matter being laid
on the table for the present.
