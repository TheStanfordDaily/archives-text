There is no denying that for even a
dramatic organization with as high a
standing as Masquers, the presenta
tion of three plays of the calibre
chosen is no mediocre task. Mas
quers' Society has not stooped; to the
contrary, it has stood on tip-toe and
reached high. To the skeptic who un
derestimates the real talent and
power of the cast chosen, it may seem
that the women's dramatic organiza
tion has reached over its head. But
only to the skeptic, who doesn't know.
Whnt the PiiMJc Wants.
The audience that gathers in the
Assembly Hall, next Friday night,
will want nothing high-brow; nothing
base. They will demand real life —
with its comedy and its pathos. Mas
quers' is giving that next Friday. The
man who wrote "Peg O 1 My Heart"
put that same kind of stuff into "Hap
piness." It's a play about discontent
—tinhappineas, we call it. She's the

kind of society woman who says:"I
have everything I don't want: nothing
that I do want."

A Common Species.
You know the kind; they live in ex
clusive ai>artments (no dogs or child
ren allowed) and celebrate New
Year's Eve blowing a ten-cent horn
inside the plate-glass sanctum of a
$10,000 limousine. That's Mrs. Chry
stal-Pole. Miss Marion Vauglian plays
the part. She feels her way into it,
too, and jwrhaps if you don't know
her, yon might get familiar and call
her Chrystal. She doesn't tell her
troubles to a policeman, however.
Philip Ohandros comes in, as a very,
very blase, bored-to-death (Ton my
word!) sort of chap. He is taken care
of by Dana Murks. Murks seems to un
derstand creatures like Chandros.
Enter Happiness.
(Thandros can't stay long, however.
Ffcte sends Florence Stewart, who for
all the world, you'd think was
Jenny, "working from 8 t' 6 for six a
week in a department store." She is
Jenny; she makes old lady Chrystal-
Pole feel like thirty cents a week;
shows her what a swell old freckle
we live on after all. Jenny makes
Mrs. Chrystal-Pole think. "Happiness"
will make you think, even if you've
never thought before.
Bhe has a father —a deep-voiced,
yet kindly-mannered father. He con
sents to be impersonated by Alfred
Wilkie, who knows more than a little
about making believe he's over forty.
Seats go on sale Tuesday. Usual
time and place.
