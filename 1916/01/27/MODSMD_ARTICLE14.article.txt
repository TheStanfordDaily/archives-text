# The 						New Major Sport
## 
### 
Basketball is a major sport and the
eighty or more men who will be out
for the big indoor game this season
will have a chance to acquire a block
"S." This latest step in the history
of basketball marks the rapid advance
of the game at Stanford since its be
ginning in the Spring of 1913, when
a small group of men worked out
their schedule and entered contests
without student body support. Some
of these men are still in college and
have been able to watch the growth of
their favorite sport from infancy to
major sport standing.
The advance is merited. For hard,
clean work there are few games on
the athletic calendar that excell it,
and it deserves recognition as one of
Stanford's five big sports. Interest in
the game on the part of players and
spectators has been growing contin
ually and major sport standing gives
the final stimulus to make it one of
the most popular sports.
Members of four of the five confer
ence teams that Stanford will meet
this season will be awarded block
letters. The University of California,
the fifth college represented, is now
considering raising the standard of
the game. These facts, combined
with the popularity of basketball in
San Francisco, will lend interest to
the sport all over the coast. The re
sults of the games would be taken as
major sports, defeats or wins, by the
public, whether or not Stanford raised
the standing of the game.
And that's an argument for getting
behind the basketball team now.
There are eighty men out—there is
room for more at the gym—and the
team is not chosen yet. Help turn
out a coast-beating team.
