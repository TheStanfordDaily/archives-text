## 
### 
I tad weather conditions caused the
postponement of the baseball game
scheduled for today between the
Stanford Varsity and the Ireland's In
dependents. This is the second time
that this contest has been put by
the boards on account of the rain, the
game being slated for last Saturday
originally.
