# Bookstore Decides Not to Handle Groceries
## Management Finds It Unfeasible To Furnish Supplies To Houses On the Campus 
### 
The project of the Stanford Book
| store to supply the houses and clubs
| on the campus with groceries and sup
' plies, which was considered last se
mester, lias been temporarily dropped
|by its promoters. The plan was to
1 form a co-operative company, to be
run by the same men who now have
charge of the Bookstore, having as
j its prime object the securing of ber
ter prices in purchasing supplies. It
j was thought that, if all the fratern
i ities, clubs and boarding houses on
the campus would join in this enter
prise, large enough orders could lie
placed to obtain a substantial reduc
tion, and a corresponding benefit to
| the various buyers.
One reason for the failure of the
plan was the unwillingness of some
i of the houses to come in on such an
j undertaking, notwithstanding the
fact that they would not have bad to
advance any cash. Another drawback
was the difficulty to finance the pro
| ject at the beginning.
Although the plan has been dropped
for the present, it is possible that
something may be done about it next
I year.
