# TRACK TEAM ONE-TENTH STRONGER THAN LAST SEASON
## RIC TEMPLETON COUNTS VETS Winners of Thirty-Nine Points in Last Year's Big Meet on 1916 Squad 
### 
With but five point winners, who
totalled twenty-two points in the Die;
Meet with California last year, miss
ing from the Stanford squad, and at
least seven point winners, who scored
more than thirty of California's sixty
points, lost to the Blue and Gold,
Captain "Hie" Templeton figures a
good year for the Cardinal track team
this season. In addition to the vet
erans of last year who are now work
ing out regularly, ten or twelve new
men of proven ability are on the job
for places on the 1916 squad.
Stanford Ten Points Stronger.
If Stanford athletes are able to cap
ture the same places they took last
year, the local team has thirty-nine
points stowed away. Captain Temple
ton estimates that the Stanford squad
is at least ten points stronger than
it was at this time last year. Ac
cording to dope, California is some
twenty or more points weaker. The
Berkeley squad is weaker in the
sprints, having lost Stanton, the
"phenom" who took first place in both
dashes. Todd, who won the relay for
the Blue and Gold, will be among the
missing, as will Vedder, who took first
in the two-mile. Beebe, second place
man in the half-mile, and Shattuck
and Coolidgo, who won eight points
between them in the hammer-throw,
are not back across the bay this year.
Among Those Present.
At the present early date the pos
sible squad lines up:
In the dashes —Niklason, Grant,
Losli, veterans; Wark and Flote,
new men.
Quarter-Mile Run—Beal, Dieven
dorff, Lynn, veterans. Pelouze, new.
Half-Mile — Boomershire, Scott,
Schnell, P. R. Wilson.
Mile Run—Aupperle, West, Hawley.
Two-Mile—Loucks, Chapman, A. P.
Wilson.
Hurdles—Murray, Norton, Halsted,
[R. R. Templeton, veterans. House,
new.
High .lump—Dykes, H. Lachmund,
VVheatiey.
Broad Jump—Sisson, Dingley.
Pole Vault —Tufts, .1. W. Templeton,
Phillips.
Shot Put—Caughey, Bihlman.
Hammer Throw—King, Gillespie,
I Miller, Bihlman.
This lineup, made out by Captain
| Templeton, is somewhat of a shake-up
|in several events. The sprints are
| strong, especially with the addition of
I Flote and Wark, who have records
j from high school meets.
Pelouze has covered the quarter in
51:3 in northern meets, while the
other three men are well tried.
Wilson a llalf-.Milor!
It is probable that "Skin" Wilson
will enter the half-mile this year,
; after taking first place in the mile for
three years. If he does not switch to
the shorter event, Aupperle will do
so. This covers the half, which is the
weakness of the squad.
Chapman is a former point winner
in the two-mile. In the hurdles, "Peg'
Murray is the one best bet. House,
freshman, is holder of the C. I. P. rec
ord in the high hurdles. Norton is
j a former point winner.
All of the other events have vet
erans who have places to lead
the new men. Captain Temple
ton is expected to enter the hurdles
this year, instead of the jumps, pro
viding suitable results develop in the
material out for the latter events.
On paper the Stanford track squad
is about the best yet. On paper the
California's squad is nothing unusual.
The next two months of training will
tell the tale.

High .lump—Dykes, H. Lachmund,
VVheatiey.
Broad Jump—Sisson, Dingley.
Pole Vault —Tufts, .1. W. Templeton,
Phillips.
Shot Put—Caughey, Bihlman.
Hammer Throw—King, Gillespie,
I Miller, Bihlman.
This lineup, made out by Captain
| Templeton, is somewhat of a shake-up
|in several events. The sprints are
| strong, especially with the addition of
I Flote and Wark, who have records
j from high school meets.
Pelouze has covered the quarter in
51:3 in northern meets, while the
other three men are well tried.
Wilson a llalf-.Milor!
It is probable that "Skin" Wilson
will enter the half-mile this year,
; after taking first place in the mile for
three years. If he does not switch to
the shorter event, Aupperle will do
so. This covers the half, which is the
weakness of the squad.
Chapman is a former point winner
in the two-mile. In the hurdles, "Peg'
Murray is the one best bet. House,
freshman, is holder of the C. I. P. rec
ord in the high hurdles. Norton is
j a former point winner.
All of the other events have vet
erans who have places to lead
the new men. Captain Temple
ton is expected to enter the hurdles
this year, instead of the jumps, pro
viding suitable results develop in the
material out for the latter events.
On paper the Stanford track squad
is about the best yet. On paper the
California's squad is nothing unusual.
The next two months of training will
tell the tale.
With but five point winners, who
totalled twenty-two points in the Die;
Meet with California last year, miss
ing from the Stanford squad, and at
least seven point winners, who scored
more than thirty of California's sixty
points, lost to the Blue and Gold,
Captain "Hie" Templeton figures a
good year for the Cardinal track team
this season. In addition to the vet
erans of last year who are now work
ing out regularly, ten or twelve new
men of proven ability are on the job
for places on the 1916 squad.
Stanford Ten Points Stronger.
If Stanford athletes are able to cap
ture the same places they took last
year, the local team has thirty-nine
points stowed away. Captain Temple
ton estimates that the Stanford squad
is at least ten points stronger than
it was at this time last year. Ac
cording to dope, California is some
twenty or more points weaker. The
Berkeley squad is weaker in the
sprints, having lost Stanton, the
"phenom" who took first place in both
dashes. Todd, who won the relay for
the Blue and Gold, will be among the
missing, as will Vedder, who took first
in the two-mile. Beebe, second place
man in the half-mile, and Shattuck
and Coolidgo, who won eight points
between them in the hammer-throw,
are not back across the bay this year.
Among Those Present.
At the present early date the pos
sible squad lines up:
In the dashes —Niklason, Grant,
Losli, veterans; Wark and Flote,
new men.
Quarter-Mile Run—Beal, Dieven

Half-Mile — Boomershire, Scott,
Schnell, P. R. Wilson.
