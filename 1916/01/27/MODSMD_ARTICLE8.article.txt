# Water Polo May Be Regular Sport
## 
### 
Another intercollegiate sport in
the form of water polo may he added
to Stanford's athletic activities this
semester. Should sufficient men be
interested in organizing such a team,
contests with the University of Cali
fornia in both water polo and swim
ming may be scheduled. Men inter
ested in water polo, whether experi
enced or inexperienced, are to meet
with Coach Ernie Brandsten and
Swimming Manager A. J. Oyster, '16,
in the Gymnasium tomorrow after
noon. At that time a decision will
be made in regard to the advisability
of organizing a water polo team in
connection with the present swim
ming squad.
Trsiimnir to Begin Tomorrow.
After a lapse in training since the
end of last semester, Stanford swim
mers will resume practice in the
plunge tomorrow afternoon. By the
use of a heating system by which
water, heated to 150 degrees, is
forced through all parts of the tank,
the average temperature has been
raised to 66 degrees. With the heat
ing system in successful operation,
the last obstacle in the way of early
practice has been removed, and Coach
Brandsten will begin his WOTk of
training the swimming candidates
once.
Though more men have signed up
for swimming as a gymnasium subject
than for any of the other sports,
there is a shortage in the number of
men for the Varsity team. Owing to
the new freshman ruling a number
of tlie stars developed last semester
will he cut out of spring competi
tion. Among the nineteener's whose
loss will he felt by the team are A.
W. Penniman, H. S. McGaffey and J.
Brokenshire.
Instead of forming only one team
of the freshmen and upperclassmen,
as was done last term, there will be
two distinct teams organized. If
present arrangements are successful,
both of these teams will meet the
Blue and Gold swimmers later in the
spring.
