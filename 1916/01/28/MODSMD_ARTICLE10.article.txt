# Women's Bookstore Checks May Swell Club House Fund
## 
### 
Questions of financing the Women's
Club House were answered yesterday
at tlie Conference stunt party when
.Miss (Jertrude Clancy, 'HI. presented
a plan for raising the budget. The
idea—borrowed somewhat from Cali- I
fornia —is for Iho women to save their
Hookstore checks and turn them 1m
toward the Club House fund.
(J. C. Miller, of the Mookstore, is in
favor of this plan. It is estimated
that the amount raised, when added !
to the dues, will pay the general Club
House expenses. The plan will be
voted on next week, the exact time to
be announced later.
Following the business, there was
a program, consisting of songs by
Miss Velona Pileher, '18. and stunts
bv the Misses Nellita Choate, *17, 1
Helen Spalding, '17, and Edith Smith.
'16.
