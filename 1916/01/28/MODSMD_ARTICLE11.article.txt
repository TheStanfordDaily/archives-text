# Trustees Approve Plan For Limiting the Number of Students to Be Permitted to Enter Stanford
## EFFICIENCY OF ALL PRESENT DEPARTMENTS TO BE INCREASED Men Without Advanced Standing Restricted to 450 the First Semester 
### 
The Stanford Hoard of Trustees to
day approved a plan, devised by the
faculty of the University, whereby the
various departments of Stanford will
be raised to the highest possible level
of efficiency and the number of stud
ents allowed to enter will be restrict
ed. This action is taken in accord
ance with the policy of the trustees,
which was made public in 1913, at the
time Dr. Jordan was raised from the
presidency to the position of chan
cellor. It was also approved by Presi
dent Wilbur, who prophesied in his
inaugural address that the number of
students would be limited as the first
step in developing the chosen fields of
the University.
Begins Next Year.
The plan for restriction will go into
effect with the beginning of the next
academic year, when the number of
men students entering for the
first time without at least a
> ear and a half advanced stand
ing will be limited to 4f>o the first
and to 50 the second semester. It is
expected that in this way the total
number of students will be kept close
to 2000 next year, and that the growth
thereafter will be slow, depending as
it will on the influx of graduate and
advanced students.
The first semester last year the
number of students entering with less
than a year and half advanced stand
ing was 471. Judging from past years,
the normal growth will raise this
number to about 550, which is one
hundred more than can be admitted.
There were sixty students admitted
in (lie second semester, ten more than
will lie admitted next. year.
Measures for raising the scholar
(ship of the students already in the
; University and for the advanced and
'graduate students who will enter, are
also included in the new regulations.
There will be a more thorough in
spection of work and it is provided
that any student who shows a general
i low average may be dropped from the
University, regardless of the number
of hours made.
Limitation In Action.
The machinery of limitation has
! been so devised that "flunking out"
during the underclass years will be
reduced to the minimum. Thus this
source of loss to the freshmen and
sophomore classes will be negligible.
There will always be a freshman
! class, since the growth of the upper
J classes will not be at its expense, as
it would if growth of the University
was arbitrarily limited. The students
will be divided into four groups under
the new system, and these, with the
official statement of their require
ments, are as follows:
Group One.
Group 112. Graduate Standing—Grad
! uates of colleges and universities of

The Stanford Hoard of Trustees to
day approved a plan, devised by the
faculty of the University, whereby the
various departments of Stanford will
be raised to the highest possible level
of efficiency and the number of stud
ents allowed to enter will be restrict
ed. This action is taken in accord
ance with the policy of the trustees,
which was made public in 1913, at the
time Dr. Jordan was raised from the
presidency to the position of chan
cellor. It was also approved by Presi
dent Wilbur, who prophesied in his
inaugural address that the number of
students would be limited as the first
step in developing the chosen fields of
the University.
Begins Next Year.
The plan for restriction will go into
effect with the beginning of the next
academic year, when the number of
men students entering for the
first time without at least a
> ear and a half advanced stand
ing will be limited to 4f>o the first
and to 50 the second semester. It is
expected that in this way the total
number of students will be kept close
to 2000 next year, and that the growth
thereafter will be slow, depending as
it will on the influx of graduate and
advanced students.
The first semester last year the
number of students entering with less
than a year and half advanced stand
ing was 471. Judging from past years,
the normal growth will raise this
number to about 550, which is one
hundred more than can be admitted.
There were sixty students admitted
in (lie second semester, ten more than
will lie admitted next. year.
Measures for raising the scholar
(ship of the students already in the
; University and for the advanced and
'graduate students who will enter, are
also included in the new regulations.
There will be a more thorough in
spection of work and it is provided
that any student who shows a general
i low average may be dropped from the
University, regardless of the number
of hours made.
Limitation In Action.
The machinery of limitation has
! been so devised that "flunking out"
during the underclass years will be
reduced to the minimum. Thus this
source of loss to the freshmen and
sophomore classes will be negligible.
There will always be a freshman
! class, since the growth of the upper
J classes will not be at its expense, as
it would if growth of the University
was arbitrarily limited. The students
will be divided into four groups under
the new system, and these, with the
official statement of their require
ments, are as follows:
Group One.
Group 112. Graduate Standing—Grad
