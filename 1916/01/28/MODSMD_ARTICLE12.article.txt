# Tina Lerner Wins Local Audience in Musical Program
## 
### 
Emilio de Gogorza seemed to want
to prove last night that he had a
grudge against Stanford. Ho failed
for the second time to putin an ap
pearance at the Assembly Hall, ft
was not known until 2 o'clock yester
day afternoon that the baritone would
again fail the Peninsula Musical As
sociation. The occasion demanded
quick action and the Peninsula Asso
ciation more than rose to the occas
ionâ€”or rather. Miss Sara Harker
rose to the occasion by leaving
promptly for San Francisco and com
ing hack with six artists in tow.
Madame Tina Lerner was the head
liner of the evening. And the petite
Russian pianiste showed that her
name is justified in outshining in tlie
world of music even that of tlio orig
inal artist of the evening. Her play
ing called out storms of applause
from an audience that had started to
listen with the definite intention of
feeling themselves cheated in having
to listen to a substitute program
The other artists of the evening
were Messrs. Shaditch, CJrassi, and
Stanislas Hem, at. the piano, violin,
and cello, and Mi?s Lucia Dunham,
soprano, accompanied by Miss Sitn
Stuart.
