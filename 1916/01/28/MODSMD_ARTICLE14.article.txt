This is an appeal for the freshman
class in the University, which may
or may not be in danger of extinction.
* * * *
Chancellor Jordan has said, and
has often been quoted in his state
ment, that the freshman class is the
raw material of the University. And
the freshman is the raw material in
a peculiar way. His place cannot be
filled by the man who comes here
from another college, a partially
finished product when he enters Stan
ford.
* * * *
We have always been proud to be
lieve that there is a stamp about the
graduate of Stanford when he goes
out into the world, which marks him
as a Stanford man. In order to ac
quire this stamp, the transfer has to
be remolded and the marks of other
training knocked off in the remold
ing. The process is often neither aa
easy or a pleasant one.
* * * *
Adjustment to Stanford life has not
proved hard in the case of freshmen.
The testimony of the men who have
been leaders in student government
is that it is hard for men from other
universities. This is a fact founded
on experience, though the opposite
might seem to be true at first glance.
Relative to the general student body,
"casualties" have been heavy among
transfers.
* * * *
College life has been praised for
itself. It has not been necessary to
tolerate it merely as an accompani
ment of being taught from books.
Stanford's President and her many
other alumni speak in pleasant rem
iniscence of profitable things accom
plished outside of class rooms while
students at Stanford. Undoubtedly a
large part of the benefits of college
come from associations with other
students.
* * * *
These associations will be very dif
ferent if the present unified body of
students is replaced by a heterogen
eous one which lacks the element of
a binding interest which now marks
student life at Stanford. We do not
believe that, possible academic ad
vantages to the University would off
set this big advantage to its students.
