Gus Hoever should have one of his
best seasons this year. He has al
ways had lots on the pill, but this
year he has experience coupled with
his twirling ability. He pitched n
j splendid game against the Agnews
j team and with any luck at all, would
t have come back to the campus with
j a win.
The freshmen, under the able lead
ership of Charley Cowan, erstwhile
St. Mary's star, are developing a team
that will make the best of them travel
: They are practicing a number of trick
plays, and with a good twirler, will
j make the Varsity play to beat them
on the next meeting.
Another feature lias been added tc
the peanut league. As an incentive
for diamond experts who are handy
! with the willow, Baseball Captain
"Babe" Dent announces that a cup
will be awarded the player with the
highest batting average at the close
iof the peanut league season. It is
also quite possible that a champion
ship game will be arranged during
the latter part of the season, witn
the freshmen team. A picked nine
j from the Reds, Whites, Blues, and
Blacks should give the freshmen con
; tingent a hard tussle for the bustiers'
| championship.
.loe Braden will receive his initial
j tryout on the Varsity baseball team.
Few people know that Joe's athletic
J accomplishments cover the national
pastime as well as the pig skin ac-
I tivity. Braden is fairly fast in the
' outfield, has a good arm, and hits bet
| ter than the average. He might make
| a valuable addition to the Cardinal
outer gardens.
While on the way to Agnews in a
large auto bus, last Wednesday, the
local men got lost on the road. They
found themselves in the "city" of
Alviso, and had to journey back a few
miles to (heir destination. They
found the spectators still waiting in
the grandstand, anxious to get their
first dope on the Stanford prospects.
They have great fans in that section
of the country.
