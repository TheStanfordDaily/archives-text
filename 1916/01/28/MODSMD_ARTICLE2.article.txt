# Weather Prevents One Regular Crew Practice on Lake
## 
### 
Though but few rainstorms are al
lowed to interfere with crew practice,
candidates for the various eights were
forced to postpone activities on ac
count of the storm of yesterday.
Throughout the training season of
last year the weather conditions stop
ped crew workouts only twice. Yes
terday was the first interference ot
this kind for the present season. Rain,
alone, according to Crew Captain
Orme, will not lie allowed to halt
training, the only thing that will stop
the daily workouts are gales which
make Redwood estuary too rough for
the shells.
The men who made the trip to the
hay today were as follows:
Varsity—Willis, coxswain; Maurer,
stroke; Green, Orme, Rogers, Jac
omini, Worth, Heron, and Neuner.
Freshmen — Goodman, coxswain;
Steinbeck, stroke; Keller, McGaffey,
