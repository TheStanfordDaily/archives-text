# Barometer Falls to Twenty-Eight-Sixty
## 
### 
Early risers on the campus, this
morning, were treated to a view of
real snow in the hills back of the
campus, nearer to the Quad than has 1
been on record for many years. At ;
the same time, as the result of the
unprecedented storm which has been
sweeping the whole state, the cam
pus was as nearly ice packed as it lui3
ever been in the history of the Uni
versity.
According to Chancellor Jordan, his
pet barometer in Xasmin House, has
been dancing jigs and fox-trots to
keep pace with the storm's frolics,
and last night said barometer drop
ped to a point called by those who
know anything about barometers ami
their habits "twenty-eight-sixty."
Previously "twenty-eight-ninety-five"
has been the most distant pinnacle
of the downward scale that tlie bar
ometer has reached.
Of course it is just for those who
fool with barometers and know their
tricks to appreciate the exact signif
icance of "twenty-eight-sixty," but Dr.
Jordan, who knows barometers from
A to Z. having nursed this particular
one in bis home through a conva
lescent stage brought on by the shock
of the earthquake in 1900, and having
petted it. ever since, sums it all up by
saying that tliis is about the most un
usual storm ever recorded here.
Anyway, the barometer registered a
storm and the storm came, incident
ally bringing snow nearer than it has
ever been to the Quad for at least ten
years. There never has been a snow
storm right at, Stanford.
