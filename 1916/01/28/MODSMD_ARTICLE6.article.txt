# NORTHERN BASKETERS INVADE STANFORD TUESDAY
## WASHINGTON IN FIRST GAME Three Local Teams Get Into Action Tomorrow Night 
### 
Stanford Varsity will play their
lirst basketball game on the home
court next Tuesday night, February
Ist, when they meet the quintet from
the University of Washington. This
game was originally scheduled for
Thursday night, but owing to some
confusion in the northern team's
schedule, it was shifted to the earlier
date.
The contest will take place in the
Encina Gymnasium, starting prompt
ly at S o'clock. Season tickets will
not serve for admission, as this is an
interstate game, the gate price being
twenty-five cents. There will be
ample seating room, some new
bleachers being built recently for the
occasion. The "five hundred" are
welcome and it is expected that a
great many of them will be on hand.
Washington is the first team from
the northwest to be on a Stanford
basketball schedule. They are now
making a tour of the south, contem
plating meeting Stanford, the Univer
sity of California, perhaps a far south
ern team, and then doubling back for
a series with the Oregon Aggies.
Their lineup is especially strong.
As this is the first contest of an
intercol legate nature, since basket
ball was made a major sport on our
campus, the game has added import-
ance. The Washington players are
classed as exponents of a major sport
by the northern institution. The local
lineup will be annonnced Monday.

The contest will take place in the
Encina Gymnasium, starting prompt
ly at S o'clock. Season tickets will
not serve for admission, as this is an
interstate game, the gate price being
twenty-five cents. There will be
ample seating room, some new
bleachers being built recently for the
occasion. The "five hundred" are
welcome and it is expected that a
great many of them will be on hand.
Washington is the first team from
the northwest to be on a Stanford
basketball schedule. They are now
making a tour of the south, contem
plating meeting Stanford, the Univer
sity of California, perhaps a far south
ern team, and then doubling back for
a series with the Oregon Aggies.
Their lineup is especially strong.
As this is the first contest of an
intercol legate nature, since basket
ball was made a major sport on our
campus, the game has added import-
ance. The Washington players are
classed as exponents of a major sport
by the northern institution. The local
lineup will be annonnced Monday.
Basketball, under its new title of
"Major Sport," gets started on its 191G

B. Blodget and A. E. Worthy, for

the 145-pound class, last year. The
men who will make up the freshman
squad tomorrow night are Pelouze,
field captain, and Estes, forwards;
Righter, center; Bennett, Sullivan,

Stanford Varsity will play their
lirst basketball game on the home
court next Tuesday night, February
Ist, when they meet the quintet from
the University of Washington. This
game was originally scheduled for

schedule, it was shifted to the earlier
date.
