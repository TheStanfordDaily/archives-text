# Change in Election to Conference Advocated
## Plan Submitted Provides for Representation from Encina, Fraternities and Unaffiliated Men 
### 
Total reorganization of the Men's
Student Conference was discussed in
detail at the meeting held last night.
Many of the members believe that the
Conference should have a far better
organization, giving a firmer govern
ment, placing more actual responsi
bility ui)on it as a body of not only
judicial, but legislative functions, and
placing it in a situation so that its
members will exercise more influence
among the students.
One of the best plans that was sub
mitted is as follows: That the mem
bers of the Men's Conference be elect
ed, one from eacli of the various units
that actually exist in the University,
such as the Hall, each fraternity, one
from the men unaffiliated, living on
the row, one from the men in Palo
Alto, etc. ft is believed that with this
system in vogue, instead of the pres
ent one, with the members chosen
from the various departments, the
work of the Conference will be made
much more effective. The men elected
will be able to keep in close touch
with the situation, and their reports
at the Conference meetings will have
greater weight.
A committee was appointed by
President Miller to look into the mat
ter and to report at the next meeting.
