# Mistake in Bonnheim
## Overlooked Manuscript Is Adjudged One of Prizewinners 
### 
Owing to the accidental mislaying,
in the Registrar's office, of one of the
manuscripts submitted in competition
for the Bonnheim prize, the judges of
the contest were compelled to re-ex
amine the essays and make a new re
port to the Committee on Literary
Contests. The manuscript which had
been mislaid was judged to be one of
the best four submitted, and one of
the prizes of fifty dollars has there
fore been awarded to its author, Ed
ward Goldberg, '17.
