# STANFORD SNOBBISH? YES---VERDICT OF DR. FITCH
## HARVARD MORE DEMOCRATIC New Ideas Tabooed Here, Says Noted Easterner at Meeting of Men in Encina 
### 
"You men of Stanford are snobbish.
You pride yourselves upon your dem
ocracy, but you are given to intoler
ance of all men who are not just like
yourselves," was the gauntlet thrown
down by Dr. A. P. Fitch in his talk
to the men of the University in En
cina club room, last night.
"You think that you are different
than the eastern college men; that
you arc more democratic than they.
But this is not the case. It is merely
that neither you nor the college men
of the east will tolerate the views of
the other," continued the speaker.
Harvard More Democratic.
"Student life at Harvard is more
democratic than at Stanford," said
Dr. Fitch, in answer to a question put
to him at the close of his regular
talk. "I am surprised to learn that
you men of the west are given to re
garding Harvard as an undemocratic,
exclusive institution. Nothing could
be further from the truth. Fully forty
per cent of the men attending Har
vard make their own living. The men
who work their way through are not
looked down upon. They sit at the
same tables, live at the same halls,
and belong to the same clubs as the
rich men's sons.
"In their freshman year all the men
live in the same dormitory. The New
York millionaire's son and the Pitts
burgh steel worker's boy become the
best of friends through this associa
tion. The aristocracy of money cuts
no figure at all in the Harvard under
graduate life."
Two Types of Aristocracy*
In further comparing Stanford's
student life to that of eastern unver
sities, Dr. Fitch said: "Though it is
true that you are comparatively free
from the aristocracy of wealth, it io
equally true that you fail to recognize
that there .is another form of aris
tocracy. In your endeavors toward
general equality you overlook super
ior ability. II is quite a different
thing for a man to be an aristocrat
by inheritance or an aristocrat of
character or intellect. One of the
things you must .vet learn is to pay
homage to the man who is your su
perior in ability. You must assist,
rather than hinder, those who show
unusual promise."
Three Mistaken Ideals.
In opening bis address before the
University men, Dr. Fitch stated that
there were three mistaken ideals of
college men. They are, he said, the
grind, the sport, and the commercial
ist. "The real purpose for which u
man comes to college is to become a
man, and to be a man he must learn
to toil, to associate with his fellows,
to love and to worship," he said.
After spending two weeks on the
Stanford campus, Dr. Fitch yesterday
I closed his series of addresses with
i two appearances before University
| audiences. In the morning be occupied
i the pulpit in the Memorial Church,
I and spoke on the theme, "The Produc
! tion of Personality is the Aim of Edu
j cation." Tie summarized the life of
! the average student from the time he
I enters college as a freshman until he
j graduates.
