# Training Rules to Take Effect For 1916 Crews
## 
### 
With the exception of prescribing
regular hours for sleep and restrict
ing dancing, training rules for the
candidates for the various 1916 crews
will go into effect tomorrow. The
principal requirements embodied in
the partial training will be that the
men abstain from all fancy "eats"
and from smoking. On account of
the severity of the sport, the crew
men are subjected to a longer training
season than any other athletes.
Should the Varsity eight be sent east
next summer, members of that team
will lie held to at least partial train
ing for almost six months. Strict
training will not be enforced until
shortly after or on March 1.
Saturday, yesterday and today were
busy days for the men out for crew
positions. On Saturday, three full
crews were taken to Redwood during
the morning, while additional fresh
men and second varsity candidates
were put through workouts on Lagun
ita during the afternoon. Coach
Guerena and Captain Orme were both
on hand at the lake, and gave many
men who had not had previous op
portunities to show what they had, a
chance to get into action.
One of the best workouts of the
season featured the trip to the lmy
yesterday mornintr. The weather,
which previously had been anything
but satisfactory for practice, was ideal
for a trip on the estuary. A?ain, the
three crews. Varsity, freshmen, and
•econd varsitv made the trip to the
bay. The men left the campus at !)
I o'clock and returned shortly after 12
| o'clock. Those who rowed were ai3

Boydston, Bowling, Brown, and At
water, bow.
Second Varsity—Goodman, coxs

But few changes were made in the
men taken to the bay today. In the
Varsity shell, the only change was the
placing of Willis at coxswain. The
new men taken in the freshmen shell
were Nelson, Curtice, and Bent, while
• the changes in the second varsity
