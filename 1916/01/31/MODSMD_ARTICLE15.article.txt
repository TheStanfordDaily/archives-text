The best time to have a full dis
cussion of the merits or lack of mer
its of the agreement drawn up by the
Intercollegiate Committee represent
ing Stanford and California, will be
tomorrow morning at 11:15, when a
period has been set aside for that pur
pose. Let's reason the matter out to
gether at that time and have an in
telligent vote on it. If you've got any
thing on your mind, get it off tomor
row.
The agreement has been drawn up
in full and now only lacks the ap
proval of the students of the two uni
versities to receive the signature of
the members of the committee. That
approval alone stands in the way of
spring sports relations for Stanford
and California, with all its advant
ages to both universities.
Those who believe that Stanford is
making all the concessions necessary
to reach an agreement, we refer to the
article on the baseball situation at
California, in another column of to
day's Daily Palo Alto. The regula
tion that members of the Blue and
Gold athletic teams shall make at
least ten hours in the University dur
ing the semester previous to their
competing in intercollegiate contests in
not a dead letter putin to mollify
Stanford, as some people are inclined
to believe it is. If adopted, the rule
will offset the disadvantage under
which Stanford has been meeting Cali
fornia in the past on account of the
higher faculty scholarship require
ments for competing. The results in
the case of the baseball squad this
year show that the rule will be ef
fective to that end.
