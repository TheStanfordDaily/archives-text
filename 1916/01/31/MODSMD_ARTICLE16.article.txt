That Stanford is snobbish is a
charge which merits consideration in
view of our pride in Stanford democ
racy. Dr. Fitch acquits us of the usual
guilt of aristocratic institutions, but
insists that we have other faults
which are just as bad. We refuse to
receive the man of better manners or
greater intellect. The poor man at
Stanford despises the rich man who
intrudes into our plebian midst. In
our efforts to get away from old line
aristocracy, we have swung too far
in the opposite direction, and drag all
men down to a false standard of equal
ity. We refuse to respect a man of
greater worth, simply because he is
of greater worth and it jolts our con
ceptions of democracy to admit it.
Has not Dr. Fitch mistaken a lack
of respect for a shallow veneer, which
often covers true worth but may not,
for a lack of respect for ability? The
man of exceptionally good breeding,
of great wealth or of intellectual abil
ity is not an outcast at. Stanford
simply because he possesses these at
tributes.
To lie sure, if he attempts to throw
these advantages in our faces with a
demand for standing in the commun
ity, lie is apt to have a hard time of
it establishing his claims. The man
of good manners will not attempt this.
The man of wealth who bases his
claims on this ground is attempting
to stand on the false pedestal, which
the older forms of aristocracy will

grant him, and ho deserves a fall off of
it. If a man has ability, whether he
is from the East or the West, lie will
have little (rouble in proving it at
Stanford, and being granted the re
spect due him for it.
