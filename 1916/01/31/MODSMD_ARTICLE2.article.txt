# Seat Sale For Masquers Will Open Tomorrow
## 
### 
Seats for the first dramatic offering
of the year, three well known one
act plays to be presented by a stellar
cast under the auspices of Masquers'
Society, Friday evening, in the As
sembly Hall, will be placed on sale
tomorrow afternoon at Woingartner's
Drug Store in Palo Alto, and at the
Stanford Bookstore. The drawing for
places will take place at 1:10.
.1. M. Harrie's "Rosalind," "Hop O'
My Thumb," by Frederick Fenn and
Richard Price, and .T. Hartley Man
ner's "Happines" are on the program.
No more need be said. Masquers has
chosen three pictures of life as you
know life, and has selected a cast that
for truthful portrayal of real people,
rivals anything yet seen by Stanford
theater-goers.
It has been said that the part of
Mrs. Page,, in Harrie's "Rosalind,"
could only be truthfully portrayed by
Ellen Terry at her best.
When Harric conceived his "Rosa
lind" he evidently did not consider
that he was writing for the stage. He
wrote to be read. The role of Mrs.
Page is a double role. One moment
she is a middle-aged woman, tired of
life; the next, moment, she is youth,
bubbling over with life's enthusiasm.
Masquers' couldn't get Ellen Terry
for next Friday night, so they decided
upon Miss Alice MacDougal, '10, who
has seen considerable experience in
otlier than college dramatics. Critic:-',
have written particularly of her work
at Cnrmel. and have found her ex
ceedingly praiseworthy.
