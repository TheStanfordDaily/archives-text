# Water Polo and Swimming Interest Is Increasing
## 
### 
Now that a swimming meet with
California some time during the pres
ent semester seems probable, interest
in the plunge sport lias increased ma
-1 terially. Not only will the Cardinal
J tank athletes work toward the devel
opment of a high class swimming
team, but they will also organize a
water polo team. These two sport.3
are so closely related that a majority
of the men good at the one are also
adept at the other. As a consequence
training for the two activities has
been set on alternate afternoons in
order to avoid conflicts. Aside from
his work in teaching swimming to a
large number of new recruits, Coach
Ernest Brandsten will putin every
afternoon with the candidates for the
swimming and water polo teams. Be
ginning today the men out for these
aggregations will be in action in the
plunge every day, and water polo
games will lie played on alternate
days for a considerable portion of the
semester. The water in the plunge
is now warm enough to suit all
comers. The temperature is kept at
about <>7 degrees continually.
