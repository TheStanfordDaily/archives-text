# DETAILS OF AGREEMENT BEFORE STUDENTS TOMORROW
## MEET IN ASSEMBLY HALL 11:15 President Wilson Has Plan For Solving Stanford's Coaching Problem 
### 
First lmnd information in regard
to the understanding reached by the
Stanford and California agreement
committee at its notable session just
two weeks ago tonight, will be given
to the Stanford students at a meeting
in the Assembly Hall tomorrow at
11:15. At the time the conciliation
was brought to its present status,
final decision was reserved for the
students. At the meeting tomorrow,
the proposition of competing with
California on the terms reached by
the agreement committee will be put
up to the students, who will be given
an opportunity to voice their approval
or disapproval on the matter.
Discussion Open to Students.
Student Body President P. R. Wil
son, 'IG, will preside at the meeting.
After he has explained the agreement
terms, the meeting will be thrown
open to general discussion in which
all students may take part. The final
vote on the matter will be held on the
Quad on either Wednesday or Thurs
day.
Take Up Coaching Problem.
Another n::.Uer to be discussed by
the student body tomorrow will be a
plan for solving the coaching problem.
President Wilson will present a plan
whereby a special committee consist
ing of representatives of the alumni,
faculty, and student body, will be ap
pointed to determine Stanford's ath
letic policy. The purpose of this com
mittee will not be to interfere with
any existing organizations, but to
avoid the too constant friction whicn
has been caused by the present ar
rangement.
By far the most important feature
of the agreement terms, from a Stan
ford viewpoint, is the provision that
freshmen be prohibited from intercol
legiate competition. In return for
Stanford's concession on this point,
California will eliminate all men who
have not presented regular entrance
requirements, and all who have not
completed at least ten hours of work
during the semester preceding.
The first of these requirements of
the Hlue and Gold athletic aspirants
will eliminate all students in affiliated
colleges unless they present regular
college entrance credits. Davis Agri
cultural School, Hastings Law School,
and the Medical and Dentistry depart
ments will be affected by this ruling.
The provision in regard to amount of
work completed will bring the Cali
fornia athletes to the same scholastic
standard demanded of Stanford ath
letes by the faculty.
The ruling upon which the students
will be asked to vote does not apply
to football, and should the agreement
be ratified, will in no way affect, the
rugby situation. All spring sports,
however, will be included in the agree
ment. If the students adopt the reso
lution of the Intercollegiate Agree
ment Committee, as it now stands,
Stanford will meet California in track,
crew, baseball, tennis, basketball, and
soccer, during the present semester.
The California Executive Committee
will probably vote 011 the agreement
proposition at a meeting to be held
on Wednesday.
