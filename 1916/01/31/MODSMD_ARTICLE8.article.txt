# California Nine Will Be Affected by New Ruling
## 
### 
If the new agreement now pending
before students of Stanford and Cali
fornia is accepted, as it is very likely
to be, the scholarship clause, provid
ing that every athlete must have suc
cessfully completed at, least ten hours
of college work during the previous
semester, will put the University of
California baseball team at a severe
handicap, according to reports re
ceived from across the bay.
Hayes, Gianelli, and Sebastian,
three of the best ball tossers on the
California campus, will be declared
ineligible, as they can not come up
to the requirements. This will leave
the Blue and Gold nine without a
catcher, third or second baseman. All
of these men have starred in pre
vious Stanford-California games, and
their loss will be keenly felt. Espec
ially is it the case this season, as the
California Varsity is left with but
four veterans, Captain Sammy Adair,
Young, Rohwer, and Dimmock, a
pitcher. The new coach, when se
lected, will have the task of filling the
position behind the plate, and every
one of the infield berths.
