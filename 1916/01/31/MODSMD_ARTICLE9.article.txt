# Crew Dance Starts Fund For Trip to Poughkeepsie
## 
### 
"On to Poughkeepsie" is the slogan
of the committee in charge of the
crew benefit dance to he held in En
cina Gymnasium on Friday evening,
February 11. Unlike all former year*,
the chief interest in the Varsity crew
season centers around a race on the
Hudson. Last year at this time the
big thing in the crew's horizon was a
victory over Washington and Cali
fornia.
Although the Cardinal eight has not
by any means stowed away the west
ern championship for the 191G season,
the men on the squad and the student
body as a whole, have greater ambi
tions for tiiis year's Varsity eight.
Though a western victory will be one
of the essentials to bringing the east
tern trip to a reality, sufficient funds
must also be available. It is for the
purpose of creating a "Poughkeepsie
Fund" that the coming dance is being
given. Tickets for the dance may
still be obtained from members of the
crew and Graduate Manager Behrens.
