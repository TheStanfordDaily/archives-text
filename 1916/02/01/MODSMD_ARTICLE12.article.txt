# Eliminate Whom?
## 
### 
The student body must get away
from the idea that we are giving in
to California if we adopt the rule elim
inating freshmen. If any giving in
is involved it consists of a bow to
the sweeping advances of the rule all
over the country. California and
Stanford are not the only schools con
cerned. We will have to eliminate
freshmen if we are to have spring
sports competition with any other col
lege.
The question seems to resolve itself
into a consideration of whether we
want to eliminate our freshmen from
intercollegiate athletics or abolish in
tercollegiate contests for all of the
men of the University. There is no
middle ground between.
If we insist on using our freshmen
we are abolishing spring sports con
tests just as effectively as if we
pased a direct ruling forbidding them.
Certainly, freshmen will not be able
to compete thenâ€”and the rest of the
men of the University will be elimin
ated with them.
We appreciate the feelings of the
men who spoke against the freshman
ineligibilty rule in this morning's
assembly. It is no easy thing to vote
in favor of abolishing our first year
men. However, a different question
arises when we consider whether or
not we are "crawling" in voting for
the rule.
Every man will have to decide for
himself whether ho thinks he is giv
ing in to unjustifiable demands if he
casts a ballot for ineligibilty. But
the verdict of public opinion is al
ready in. What people will think of
ns for adopting the rule is not a
matter of guesswork. Their decision
was handed in as soon as our olumni
advised adopting the rule and we have
it for reference.
Public opinion, if we can take the
newspapers as a criterion, did not
cast a sneer our way, when the new
discussion of ineligibility came up.
Without a single exception they com
plimented our alumni, believing that
they were showing good sense in ad
vising ineligibility.
