S. F. High School Swimmers
Adopt "Stanford Events."
San Francisco high schools have
now adopted what they term the
"Stanford events" in their swimming
meets. In former years the teams
about the bay have confined then
events to dashes, long distances, and
diving. The new events, which have
been included at Stanford since the
beginning of the sport here, are the
special events of back stroke, breast
stroke, and plunge for distance. In
accepting the new schedule of events,
the high schools have cut out the
"man killing" distance races, and
have made the meets much more
"snappy."
