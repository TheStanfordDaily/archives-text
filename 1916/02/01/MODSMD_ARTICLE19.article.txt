Freshmen Defeat Varsity.
In the second practice game of the
present baseball season, the freshmen
defeated the varsity yesterday by a
3 to 1 score. Howe twirled splendid
ball for the varsity, allowing but two
hits. These were both two-baggera,
however, and came at the right time.
Peterson worked in nice form for the
first year men, but was a trifle wild.
The lineups were as follows:
Varsity—Howe, p; Dent and Camp
bell, c; Hayes, lb; Dickey, 2b; Stev
ens, ss; Stafford, 3b; Sanborn, Lander,
and Braden, outfielders.
Freshmen —Peterson, p; E. Mitchell,
c; Mitchell, lb; Messick, 2b; Shriver,
3b; Cowan, ss; Ryan, Lilly, and Rea
gon, outfielders.
Peanut League Opens Series.
The Peanut League was scheduled
for an official opening yesterday, but
as there were not quite enough men
out to make four complete teams, the
first regular games were potsponed
until today. The magnates of the
bustiers, Hastings, Twohy, Rehm, and
flea, have some good ball players on
their respective lineups and some fine
games should result from the peanut
ers' pennant chase.
Lamlers Rats High.
Johnny Landers seems to be running
"Doc" Hayes and "Wabbles" Stafford
a close race for the early season bit
ting championship. In two trips to
the plate yesterday, he tore off two
pretty bingles. Roth of them were
hard hit balls and had the frosh out
fielders wishing for carfare. Lander,
with his good arm, speed and judge
ment in the field, and best of all, hit
ting strength, will help the Cardinal
outfield this season.
I'ennuters On Varsity Squad.
llannsel, Ford, and Wilson, three
members of the peanut squad, were
promoted to the Varsity contingent by
Captain Dent, yesterday. They are
outfielders, and will be tried out in
some one of the next games. Other
players showing class in the peanut
league will be immediately shifted to
the Varsity squad.
