# PALO ALTO FILM COMPANY SHOWS INITIAL RELEASE
## "Wanda of the Wed Street" Attains Mechanical Perfection at Varsity Production 
### 
"Wanda of the Red Street," the
initial feature film of the Palo Alto
Film Corporation, was shown last
night to an appreciative audience at
the Varsity theater The theater was
chartered by the corporation and all
admission was by invitation A brief
speech was made by Wellington Play
ter, late of the Famous Players, in
which he outlined the aims of the cor
poration.
If the photography of their first re
lease, and the acting of their princi
pals, Francellia Hillington, James
Cruz, and Wellington Playter, is to be
taken as a criterion of future work,
the Palo Alto Film Corporation will
be heard from in filmdom. In clear
ness of negative they reached perfec
tion, locations were good—and famil
iar in some cases—and the acting of
the principals showed the quiet re
serve so vital to good pictures. The
care and exactness of the technical di
rector was also evident. The interiors
showed painstaking in detail.
In directing the piece good use was
made of fadeouts and double expos
ure, and especially of the latter. That
is another mark of quality. In fact,
if any adverse criticism is to be of
fered, it must he confined to the de
velopment of the story itself, and not
to the mechanics of the production.
"Wanda" is a good first release, and a
worthy one.
