# FAMOUS WINE COOPERATE AT STANFORD VINA CLOSED
## 
### 
After a period of some thirty-five
years' activity, tlie wine cooperate at
the Stanford ranch, Vina, was recently
closed. The famous old wine cellar
contains one oak barrel that is cap
able of holding two million gallons of
wine. This is probably the largest
| cooperate in the world. It was built
by Senator Stanford in the early
eighties, and has been a great source
of revenue ever since. The cellar it
self is three hundred feet square, and
has two other barrels besides the main
cooperate, each containing between
eighteen hundred and two thousand
gallons of wine.
