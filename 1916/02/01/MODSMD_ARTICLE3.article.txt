# "Let's Go Play in the Sand" "No, I'd Rather Go Fishing" N.Y. Has Been Seeing Things

New York City may be the Golden
(late of the East, may have more
saloons than San Francisco, and
may be known as the largest me
tropolis in the wurruld—yet it re
mains for The Daily Palo Alto to
discover and accord to the eastern
city the laurels that are coming to
it for housing the best collection of
unconscious prevaricators in cap
tivity. However, ignorance is bliss
ful and humorous.
There are two ways to account
for it —either the alumni with fond
recollections of the goo' ol' days,
were mixing 'em awfully strong, or
the city's average in the race for
barons of the Munchausen type, was
falling.
From the New York Evening
Journal we quote the following:
With telephone receivers pressed
against their ears, two hundred
alumni of Leland Stanford Junior
University, in New York, joined over
the long distance telephone in the
exercises attendant upon the induc
tion of Ray Lyman Wilbur into the
presidency of the institution in far
away Berkeley, Cal.
An interesting feature of the en
tertainment in the Craftsman Build
ing was moving pictures showing
the Pacific breaking over # the sands
at Palo Alto. While those pictures
were on the screen a telephone on
the long pier at Palo Alto was con
nected with the alumni, and they
beard the roar of the breakers they
were looking at.
