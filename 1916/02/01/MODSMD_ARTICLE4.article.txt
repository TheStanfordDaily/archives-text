# COLLEGE FIVES TO CLASH TONIGHT
## Washington Quintet Will Attack Stanford Tossers 
### 
Stanford's basketball team will be
put to its first real test tonight, when
it will clash with the University of
Washington quintet in the Gymnas
ium. The northerners have developed
a strong team, as their 3f> to 27 defeat
of California last night will testify.
California, as well as Stanford, has
raised basketball to the status of
major sport, in consequence of which
the interest has greatly increased in
this branch of athletics.
First I'. W.-Stanford Name.
This will be the first meeting of
Washington and Stanford in basket
ball, and there is little ground for a
comparison of the two teams. With
eighty men out for the sport on the
campus, however, there is every rea
son to expect that the Cardinal will
be present with a lively quintet of
ball tossers to meet the northerners.
Washington is by far the champion

of the Pacific Northwest Conference,
however, and it will no doubt take a
good team to defeat the Purple and
Gold.
Everybody Welcome.
The game will be open to the women
as well as the men, and will he called
at S o'clock. Due to the fact that
this is an inter-state game, season
tickets will not be honored. The price
of admission is twenty-five cents.
New Men On I'. \\. Squad.
Of the men on the Washington
squad, Captain Davidson is the only
one who is a veteran. Shively,
Deutche, and Staatz. were members of
the second team last season, while the
other men are playing on the varsity
for the first time. The northern play
ers are due to meet California again
Wednesday evening, and will then
.journey to the Oregon Agicultural Col
lege for a two-game series.
