# ADVISORY BOARD WILL ESTABLISH POLICY IN ATHLETICS
## DR. WILBUR OUTLINES VIEW Says That Alumni or Faculty Could Be Convinced by Student Committee 
### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur in an
interview today outlined his views on
the proposed athletic advisory board
to consist of student, alumni and fac
ulty representatives, which will decide
all athletic questions, such as the
present paid-coach problem, as fol
lows:
"Our plan is to create an athletic
advisory board, which will consist
of three student, two alumni, and
two faculty members. All athletic
problems will come first before this
committee for decision. No matter
what problem comes up, if the stud
ent committee is right in its conten
tions, it ought to be able to convince
either the alumni or the faculty rep
resentatives, in which case the whole
advisory committee would render a
majority opinion.
"There is no reason for any sus
picion on the part of either students
or faculty members of each other
or of this plan, which would make
for permanent cohesion among all
the parties concerned in athletic af
fairs. When 112 stepped into this of
tice and attempted to find some solu
tion of the athletic problem, I found
the leaders of the different groups
at sword's points, and distrusting
each other, rather than working to
gether as a co-ordinate unit.
"This plan of an advisory com
mittee has been approved by the
alumni, who agreed to it at a meet
ing at the Press Club in San Fran
cisco, by the faculty, and by a num
ber of student body leaders. It is a
permanent means of continuing a
definite athletic policy. After we
decide what our policy in regard to
athletics are we can go ahead and
deal with separate problems, such
as coaches, and so forth.
"1 think the student body ought to
snap at the opportunity to put
everything up to such a board.
Their representatives can be chosen
in any way that they see fit.
"Of course, by reason of my posi
tion, final say is left to me, after af
fairs have passed the Faculty Ath
letic Committee. The Faculty Ath
letic Committee will be but a nom
inal authority if the Athletic Advis
ory Hoard is established. As long
as the Athletic Advisory Hoard acts
sanely and sensibly, I will be back
of its decisions and actions."
