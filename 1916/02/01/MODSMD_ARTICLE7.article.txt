# YOU'LL NOT FORGET "'OP "
## Seats Now on Sale For First Drama of the Year 
### 
Masquers will put a startling atmos- j
phere of reality on the stage, Fridav
night. Besides the rain-storm in
"Rosalind," and the lire-side scene in
"Happiness,'' Coach Cyril has drilled
his charges in a fight-scene for "Hop
O' My Thumb" that is worth travel- 1
ing around the Horn to see. One i
laundry girl shoves another into a
clothes basket, then is forced to dodge
a flat-iron that comes stealing across
the room. "Hop," with her anger |
reaching the boiling point, rushes I

upon her tantalizer, and throws her |
across a table. There is hair pulling J
and feminine swearing.
"Hop O' My Thumb" tells a pathetic !
story, but tells it brimful of laughs, j
And the action is action, every bit of
it.
At the end they live happily ever
after —almost. Ht; kisses her and she
feels happiness. Miss Ellen Galpin,
'17, whose experience has taken her
many places on the stage, plays the


Marion Vauuhaii ami Florence Stewart
intricate role of " 'Op," as the English
say it. In her only previous appear
ance on a Stanford stage—Masquers'
.links—Miss Galpin did not have op
portunity to show her power in a
part that requires every hit of energy
and concentration that can be sum
moned. " 'Op" is such a part—she is
a character that will not be soon for
gotten in the memory of Stanford
dramatics. Miss Galpin will be " 'Op"
every minute of the time.
Tickets for the year's first dramatic
performance were put on sale today
at Weingartner's drug store and the
Bookstore. Although a big share of
the pasteboards were snapped up,
there are good seats still to be had.
