# FAVOR FRESHMEN ELIMINATION
## Students Discuss Intercollegiate Agreement Terms TO VOTE ON QUAD TOMORROW Plan to Create Committee to Settle Coaching Problem Meets With Approval 
### 
But little opposition to the elimina
tion of freshmen from intercollegiate
athletic competition was expressed
by the students In the assembly this
morning. The question was thorough
ly discussed, together with the prop
osition to create an advisory board of
three students, three alumni and three
members of the faculty for the pur
pose of formulating a policy regarding
coaches. The latter plan, which was
suggested by President Wilbur, met
with the entire approbation of the;
students who spoke.
Vote Tomorrow.
Whether or not Stanford will ac
cept the recommendations of the
alumni bodies of San Francisco, Port
land and Los Angeles, and adopt the
freshman rule, will be decided tomor
row by a secret ballot on the Quad.
At the same time President Wilbur's
suggestion for handling the coaching
problem and other athletic questions
will be voted on.
Wilson Reviews Problem.
Student Body President P. R. Wil
son, before declaring the meeting open
for general discussion, gave a short
resume of the work of the Stanford
Intercollegiate Agreement Committee,
and a statement of the freshman prob
lem as it now stands. He pointed out
that Stanford, in return for elimina
tion of the first year men, has gained
something from California which the
students of that institution have here
tofore refused to grant: namely, u
higher scholarship standard for ath
letes. He gave as a few reasons why
we should accept the alumni proposal,
that fresluncn are being eliminated
throughout the whole country; that
the alumni, who have the benefit of
a wider experience than the present
students, want it; and that the faculty
of the University also want the
change, and in fact ruled the fresh
men out ten years ago.
.Meeting Thrown Open.
The meeting was then thrown open
for discussion by the students. Those
favoring freshman ineligibility were
E. L. Hayes, '16, C. M. Miller, '14, F. S.
Murray, '16, W. P. Staniford, '16, H. S.
Pettingill, '17, F. E. Rehm, '15, E. C.
Behrens, '14, J. H. Goodman, '16, H. V.
Aupperle, '17, F. N. Worth, *16, A. E.
Worthy '15, C. R. Wakefield, '16, J. R.
Braden, '16, A. S. Hayes, '16, and W.
B. Curtis, '16. D. B. Carroll, '16, R.
N. Wenzel, '16, and H. H. Burrows,
'16, were the only men who spoke in
opposition.
Arguments In Favor.
Several arguments were advanced
by those who favored the adoption of
the rule. The feeling was strong that
Stanford should stand behind the al
umni, who are in a position to know
better what is good for the Univer
sity, and that the efforts of the In
tercollegiate Agreement Committee
should not be set at naught,
ltule Wide Spread.
"Though we feel that freshmen
have a place here," said one speaker,
"the freshman elimination rule is no
longer a fad, but has come to be a
custom. We must get into a position
where we can secure competition with
suitable rivals, and this is not possible
while we allow the first year men to
play. Furthermore, it is in conform
ance with faculty desire.
Principle Not Important.
The majority opinion was that the
principle at stake was not important,
inasmuch as the charge of profession
alism made against Stanford has been
withdrawn. Furthermore, it was
pointed out that the issue is not be
tween California and Stanford, but 's
rather a national question, with the
Cardinal in the minority. The finan
cial advantages were also stressed.
Arguments Against.
Carroll, in speaking against the
freshman exclusion rule, said: "There
is no more necessity to give in now
than there was last year. We should
not sacrifice our pride, for Stanford
stands for more than mere athletics.
It stands for the development of
men." He brought out the fact that
freshmen are not eliminated in the
Intercollegiate Association of Amateur
Athletes of America.
Effect of 1. C. A. A. A. A. Rule.
In answer to this Wilson stated the
rule, which is, that "no one shall be
eligible to represent any college or
university at any intercollegiate meet
ing, who has not been a member of
that college or university in good and
regular standing from October 15, of
the year preceding the date of com
petition." Thus Stanford freshmen
could compete in this one meet since
it does not come until the academic
year here is over. However, the in
dividual members of this association
have freshmen ineligibility rules,
whcli practically nullify this provis
ion. In the Missouri Valley and the
Big Nine conference freshmen are ab
solutely ineligible.
