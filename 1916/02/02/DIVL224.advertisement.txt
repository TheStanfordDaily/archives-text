that blessed pipe with good old "Tux" and
knock the daylights out of care and woe and
trouble and all the rest of that tribe.
The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
"Tux" is made of the finest selected Burley—
full of gimp and go and get-there liveliness.
But it's a smooth, mellow, fragrant smoke—
the "Tuxedo Process," which is often imitated
but never equalled, takes away all the bite and
parch and leaves it mild, sweet and cool.
Try one tin of "Tux" —
you'll find it will comfort,
refresh and satisfy you as no
other tobacco can.
