# CARDINAL BALL TOSSERS WHITEWASHED BY AGNEWS NINE
## OPPONENTS SLUG BALL HARD Second Game of Series Lost by 7 to 0 Score on the Hospital Diamond 
### 
Outhit and outplayed, the Stanford
varsity baseball team lost the second
scheduled game of the season yester
day, when the Agnews State Hospital
nine whitewashed them to the "tune of
7 to (i. The game was played on the
opponents' diamond before the in
mates of the hospital and a large
crowd of outside spectators. The
weather conditions were perfect giv
ing the tossers of both teams a chance
to pull fine plays.
Agnews started their winning stride
in the iirst inning when they scored
their initial run on a hit, an error and
a sacrifice. The game was really de
cided in the second frame, when the
hospital boys chalked up five runs on
four singles, two walks, and an error.
Their final count was registered in
the fifth on a double and a single.
Outside of the second spasm, Wickcr
sham twirled nice ball, but in this
eventful inning, the opposing team
got to his curves in an easy manner.
"Wick" went into the game with a
very sore arm.
Try as they might, the Cardinal
players were unable to drive a run
across. Five hits were gathered dur-
iug the session, one a two-sacker by
Diekey, but the team failed to connect
in the pinches. The local nine were
\\ eakened yesterday by the absence of
Stanfford, Sanborn, and Noonan, from
the lineup. In the other game with
Agnews, these three men smeared four
bingles between them.
Two more games are scheduled with
Agnews for the coming season. Re
gardless of the outcome, they give
Hie Cardinal team excellent practice,
as they put out a splendid ball club.

Time of Game —one hour and forty

Outhit and outplayed, the Stanford
varsity baseball team lost the second
scheduled game of the season yester
day, when the Agnews State Hospital
nine whitewashed them to the "tune of
7 to (i. The game was played on the
opponents' diamond before the in
mates of the hospital and a large
crowd of outside spectators. The
weather conditions were perfect giv
ing the tossers of both teams a chance
to pull fine plays.
Agnews started their winning stride
in the iirst inning when they scored
their initial run on a hit, an error and
a sacrifice. The game was really de
cided in the second frame, when the
hospital boys chalked up five runs on
four singles, two walks, and an error.
Their final count was registered in
the fifth on a double and a single.
Outside of the second spasm, Wickcr
sham twirled nice ball, but in this
eventful inning, the opposing team
got to his curves in an easy manner.
"Wick" went into the game with a
very sore arm.
Try as they might, the Cardinal
players were unable to drive a run
across. Five hits were gathered dur-
iug the session, one a two-sacker by
Diekey, but the team failed to connect
in the pinches. The local nine were
\\ eakened yesterday by the absence of
Stanfford, Sanborn, and Noonan, from
the lineup. In the other game with
Agnews, these three men smeared four
bingles between them.
Two more games are scheduled with
Agnews for the coming season. Re
gardless of the outcome, they give
Hie Cardinal team excellent practice,
as they put out a splendid ball club.
