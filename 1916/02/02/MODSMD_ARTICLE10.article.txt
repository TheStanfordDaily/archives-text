# Dormitory Question Being Studied by Dr. Wilbur and Business Manager Stow
## 
### 
President Wilbur, accompanied by
Vanderlynn Stow, treasurer and busi
ness manager of the Board of Trus
tees, looked things over at Encina
Hall yesterday. Their mission was to
obtain data to aid in formulating
plans for possible new dormitories.
At present there are 330 men on
Encina's waiting list. Undoubtedly
this number would be greatly in
creased, were there any chance to
secure accommodations. A significant
fact is that the waiting list exceeds
by six the number of men rooming
in the hall. Many of the names on
the list represent students already
registered, who are forced to live in
boarding houses, in Palo Alto, or
commute to their homes.
