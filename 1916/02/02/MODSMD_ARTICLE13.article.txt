# Redirect That Interest
## 
### 
Student interest in the agreement
was shown by the relatively large
vote on the Quad this morning. The
settlement of the question did not
drift by with mediocre support or op
position. People were thinking and
were willing to give material effect
to their ideas at the polls.
True there was some dissension
present. But that shows interest.
Let's turn that interest now to what
is before us this spring. We've
never had a better chance from early
season prospects to make a clean ath
letic calendar of wins. It looks like
support is all that is necessary to do
the work.
With a crack rugby team last fall,
we didn't get a chance at California,
and we've got something coming to
us in spring sports. The men who
have been thirsting for bear's blood
will get their chance now. Get in
with the first round of boosters.
