# Advisory Committee

### 
The overwhelming vote in favor of
the proposal for an Athletic Advisory
Committee is very gratifying, since it
evidences the practically unanimous
support of the measure by the stud
ents. The existence of the committee
bids fair to completely quench the
fires that have been smouldering over
the coach question and prevent any
friction that might have arisen.
The adoption of the measure will
do more than bridge over temporary
crises, however. The committee will
be *1 lasting organization which will
prevent the chance of any serious
trouble arising in the future. The
control of athletics, which has here
tofore been a divided responsibility,
will now be unified through the ex
istence of this committee. Everyone
concerned will know where to look
for final authority in athletic mat
ters.
The best part of the scheme is that
it comes from President Wilbur. If
we were not already convinced that
he was very much "on the boat," the
proposal of this measure alone would
establish it. A difficult question for
all generations, both past and pres
ent, has been decided in a way which
should satisfy everybody.
