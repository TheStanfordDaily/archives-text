Graduate Discovers a
"Protococeacene."
Miss Serena Philips, ex-'l5, who has
been doing research work in the En
tomology department in preparation
for her Master's Degree, has just made
a very interesting and startling dis
covery in the way of a new organism.
Miss Philips has been specializing on
fresh water alga, and her discovery is
a one-celled Protococcaceae, which
may be a resting spore or a new plant.
The actual classification of the or
ganism has not been definitely determ
ined as yet, but at all events the dis
covery is an important and a remark
able one, and if it is a new plant it
will mean it is a new genera as well
as a new specie.
