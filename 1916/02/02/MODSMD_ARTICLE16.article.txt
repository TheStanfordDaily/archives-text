With another leaguer in their line
up, the Agnews team put a fine squad j
in the Held against the Stanford hopes ;
yesterday. "Chief" Esola, former San
Jose State Leaguer, played shortstop
for the home aggregation. With Bert
Lynn, Lamara, Cress, Lackey, Esola,
and Koehn, the attendants need not
have fear of losing many ball games.
Johnny Lander kept up his batting
streak, collecting two bingles out of
four triits to the platter. His field
ing was also of high#order, as he cov
ered his territory in nice style. He
nabbed one from A. Lynn's bat that
was easily labeled for a triple.
Several new men were given try
outs on the varsity by Captain Dent.
Braden cavorted in the right garden,
Wilkins and Bihlman held down left,
while Hensil covered the territory
around second, and Ford relieved
Stevens at third. It is rather early
in the season to judge a new player's
ability, but all of these men showed
that they were deserving of further
opportunity.
Instead of riding for hours in a
truck, the varsity ball tossers went
to Agnews in style, yesterday. Two
seven-passenger touring cars were
engaged for the occasion. These
proved to be more satisfactory, tak
ing far less time.
Captain Dent lias any number of
promising heavers to choose his
twirling staff from. The pick of
Hoever, Howe, Wickersham, Mattei,
Weeks, and Hurley, should put a pro
ficient staff on the Cardinal • list for
the big games.
The Peanut League was officially
opened last night when two schedule
games were held, one on the varsity
field and the other on auxiliary field.
The games were snappy but otherwise
were not featured by any spectacular
playing.
The results were a victory for the
Reds over the Blues by a 2 to 1 score,
and a tie between the Blacks and
Whites, (lie score in this'game being
i) to 0.
The second games of the series will
lie held tomorrow night, one on aux
iliary field, the other on faculty field.
