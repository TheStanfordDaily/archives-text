hirons across the laundree room. Is

socks an' things.
"The poor little 'Op—she's 'cad over
'eels in love with a shy ol' biy, one
'Orace Greenback, if 1 remember

nieetin' 'ard biled shirt a year back,
and every day since she's been a-doin'
bit up spick'n span a-hopin' 'e'll come
back and take hit 'n er to 'is bosom.
"I should sai so! 'PJ conies back,
and plays 'er square—'e's a fine biy,

biy? She won't go with 'im—an' yu
ain't seen the show! Well, I'm off yu
till yu spen' your shillin', 'Ere's the
change I 'ave. Now go buy a ticket.
It's the best show yu'll ever 'ope L'
