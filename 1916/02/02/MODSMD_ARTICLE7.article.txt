# ALUMNI PLAN AND ADVISORY BOARD ACCEPTED
## Athletic Committee Will Be Named Immediately Californians Are Expected to Ratify Agreement This Evening 
### 
By the wide margin of 404 votes
for and 95 against, the proposal of
the Stanford alumni that the students
of the university give up freshmen in
varsity intercollegiate athletic con
tests, in return for concessions from
California, was accepted at today's
polls. President Wilbur's suggestion
for the creation of an advisory ath
letic board to consist of three stud
ents, three alumni, and three mem
bers of the faculty, was approved by
the practically unanimous majority
of 48G to 8. A total of 499 votes was
cast.
Appointment of Committer.
This committee will be appointed at
once. President Wilbur will name
the faculty, and L. W. Cutler, 'OG,
president of the Alumni Association,
the alumni members. The Executive
Committee will, in all probability, ap
point three men at its meeting to
night, to represent the student body.
It is possible that two of these will
automatically be placed on the com
mittee by virtue of other positions in
the student body, such as graduate
manager and president of the Assf>-
ciated -Students, the third to be
elected by the Executive Committee.
The first problem to be solved by

this committee is that of coaching.
With an equal representation of stud
ents and faculty and the alumni as a
happy medium, it is expected that
whatever is decided will be satisfac
tory to all elements. The committee
will further develop and direct Stan
ford's policy in all matters of an
athletic nature, and, it is hoped, will
eliminate all friction between faculty
and students.
Await California Action.
California's adoption of the recom
mendations made by the Intercolle
giate Agreement Committee, follow
ing the meeting held in San Fran
cisco, January 17, is all that is now
needed to completely heal the breach
between the two universities. It is
expected that the California Execu
tive Committee will ratify the agree
ment tonight. Student Body Presi
dent C. E. Street said today: "Un
doubtedly the Executive Committee
will sign the proposal this evening,
and this action will be sufficient to
put its terms into effect. There will
be a mass meeting of the students
later in the month for the purpose of
ratifying it, but this is not necessary
to make the committee's action of
ficial."
