## ENCLOSES ARMY PERIODICALS H. M. Halcomb, '08, Officer in English Army, Writes From the Dardanelles 
### 
First-hand news from the war zone
was received today in The Daily Palo
Alto office through a letter from N.
M. Halcomb, '08, who is now in active
service in Turkey. Enclosed with the
letter, which was dated December 11,
were copies of the "War Office Tele
gram," and the "Peninsula Press," for
December 1 and 6.
These publications are in the form
of disjointed facts, put down as they
were received by wireless from the
front, and are examples of the way
news is circulated in the Dardanelles
army. In them is outlined the main
events on tlie western, eastern and
Caucasian fronts, the naval events,
and movements in Italy and Ger
many. The fact that the recent Ger
man's gas attack was "repulsed with
ease," is emphasized as a sign that
this method of warfare has lost its
effectiveness.
Halcomb is commanding officer of
the 21st Cliesire Field Company of the
Royal Engineers, in the Dardanelles
Army of the British Mediterranean
Expeditionary Force.
