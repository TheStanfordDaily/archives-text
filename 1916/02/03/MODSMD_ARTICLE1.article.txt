# "NEWS FROM FRONT" IS SENT TO CAMPUS BY ALUMNUS
## ENCLOSES ARMY PERIODICALS H. M. Halcomb, '08, Officer in English Army, Writes From the Dardanelles 
### 
First-hand news from the war zone
was received today in The Daily Palo
Alto office through a letter from N.
M. Halcomb, '08, who is now in active
service in Turkey. Enclosed with the
letter, which was dated December 11,
were copies of the "War Office Tele
gram," and the "Peninsula Press," for
December 1 and 6.
These publications are in the form
of disjointed facts, put down as they
were received by wireless from the
front, and are examples of the way
news is circulated in the Dardanelles
army. In them is outlined the main
events on tlie western, eastern and
Caucasian fronts, the naval events,
and movements in Italy and Ger
many. The fact that the recent Ger
man's gas attack was "repulsed with
ease," is emphasized as a sign that
this method of warfare has lost its
effectiveness.
Halcomb is commanding officer of
the 21st Cliesire Field Company of the
Royal Engineers, in the Dardanelles
Army of the British Mediterranean
Expeditionary Force.

Editor The Daily Palo Alto.
Enclosed you will find a copy of
the Peninsula Press and some war
office circulars showing how the war
news is circulated amongst the Dard-
anelles Army. This is a branch of
the R. E. Service, but not a very ac
tive one, judging from the size of the
sheet.
This, I thought, might be of interest
to The Daily staff, and perhaps to
We itre in a very warm corner of a
very warm place. Brother Turk has
a nasty hal>it of "strafing" us, especi
ally 011 Sundays. About GO shell.? fell
in my camp area, approximately 7." by
100 feet, last Sunday, but not a man
was hit, luckily.
After I've been to Servia and France
and seen how things are done there,
I hope to come back and tell you all
about it. Meanwhile, Time and the
Censor (which in this case is myself
and conscience) do not allow any ex
pansion.
To all my friends (and I hope there
are still a few around there holding
on) a Merry Christmas and a Happy
New Year, with success to the "Dilly
Dally After," —as we used affection
ately term the old journal.
Yours sincerely,
(Signed) N. M. HALCOMB,
Captain.

First-hand news from the war zone
was received today in The Daily Palo
Alto office through a letter from N.
M. Halcomb, '08, who is now in active
service in Turkey. Enclosed with the
letter, which was dated December 11,
were copies of the "War Office Tele
gram," and the "Peninsula Press," for
December 1 and 6.
These publications are in the form
of disjointed facts, put down as they
were received by wireless from the
front, and are examples of the way
news is circulated in the Dardanelles
army. In them is outlined the main
events on tlie western, eastern and
Caucasian fronts, the naval events,
and movements in Italy and Ger
many. The fact that the recent Ger
man's gas attack was "repulsed with
ease," is emphasized as a sign that
this method of warfare has lost its
effectiveness.
Halcomb is commanding officer of
the 21st Cliesire Field Company of the
Royal Engineers, in the Dardanelles
Army of the British Mediterranean
Expeditionary Force.
llalcomh's Letter.
The letter follows:
Editor The Daily Palo Alto.
Enclosed you will find a copy of
the Peninsula Press and some war
office circulars showing how the war
news is circulated amongst the Dard-
anelles Army. This is a branch of
the R. E. Service, but not a very ac
tive one, judging from the size of the
sheet.
This, I thought, might be of interest
to The Daily staff, and perhaps to
We itre in a very warm corner of a
very warm place. Brother Turk has
a nasty hal>it of "strafing" us, especi
ally 011 Sundays. About GO shell.? fell
in my camp area, approximately 7." by
100 feet, last Sunday, but not a man
was hit, luckily.
After I've been to Servia and France
and seen how things are done there,
I hope to come back and tell you all
about it. Meanwhile, Time and the
Censor (which in this case is myself
and conscience) do not allow any ex
pansion.
To all my friends (and I hope there
are still a few around there holding
on) a Merry Christmas and a Happy
New Year, with success to the "Dilly
Dally After," —as we used affection
ately term the old journal.
Yours sincerely,
(Signed) N. M. HALCOMB,
Captain.
