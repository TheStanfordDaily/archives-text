# BEHRENS, BRADEN AND WILSON REPRESENT STUDENT BODY
## TO SERVE ON ATHLETIC BOARD Executive Committee Discusses Michigan Offer For a Track Meet 
### 
Student Body President Wilson,
J Graduate Manager Behrens, and J. It.
I Braden, football captain-elect, were
chosen, last night, by the Executive
Committee, to represent the Asso
ciated Students on the Athletic Advis
ory Board, which was accepted at the
polls yesterday. The rule adopted for
electing men to this board reads "that
the president of the Associated Stud
ents of Stanford University be a mem
ber ex-officio, and two senior members
be elected by the Executive Commit
tee, but not necessarily from the com
mittee." Thus Wilson takes his seat
I by virtue of his office as president.
Ifnle for This Year Only.
This rule is temporary and will
last only for the work of the present
year. At the next student body elec
tion a permanent method for naming
this committee will in all probability
be adopted by amendment to the con
stitution. These three will serve with
the alumni and faculty members for
the present semester.
Probable* Michigan Meet.
An offer which has been received
from the University of Michigan for a
track meet at Ann Arbor in the spring
was discussed by the committee, but
no definite decision was made regard
ing the matter. The offer, which was
made by the Chairman of Athletics at
Michigan, includes a contribution of
$600 toward the expenses of the Card
inal track team. May 20 is the date
suggested for the meet, which would
enable the Stanford aggregation to
■ s-top over 011 the way to the I. C. A. A.
A. A. meet.
The purchase of a new shell for
crew was authorized, since the ship
ment of the Poughkeepsie boat is
deemed impractical. It would cost
over $400 to get the shell back to the
campus for the season's training and
ship it to the Hudson again to race
this summer. Furthermore, the boat
experts of the east say that such a
long trip would render the shell unfit
for a race, it is absolutely necessary
that a boat lie on hand as soon as
possible.
The new shell, which will cost
about $600, will be ordered at once
from the Seattle Boat Building com
pany, and it is expected, will arrive
in five weeks. The Poughkeepsie
shell will, of course, he left on the
Hudson for use in June.
The advisability of sending a two
man tennis team east this summer
was discussed. Graduate Manager
Behrens will get in touch with eastern
colleges and if expenses can be guar
anteed, Stanford will probably be rep
resented on the courts during vaca
tion.
The minutes follow:
Regular meeting, February 2, 1916.
President Wilson in the chair.
Templeton, Wheatly and Walker ab
sent.
Minutes read and approved.
MSC that a new shell be procured
for crew.
Discussion concerning track meet
with Michigan on trip east.
MSC that President of A. S. S. be a
member ex-officio and two senior mem

ory Board.
J. R. Braden and E. C. Behrens

in five weeks. The Poughkeepsie
shell will, of course, he left on the
Hudson for use in June.
The advisability of sending a two
man tennis team east this summer
was discussed. Graduate Manager
Behrens will get in touch with eastern
colleges and if expenses can be guar
anteed, Stanford will probably be rep
resented on the courts during vaca
tion.

Student Body President Wilson,
J Graduate Manager Behrens, and J. It.
I Braden, football captain-elect, were
chosen, last night, by the Executive
Committee, to represent the Asso
ciated Students on the Athletic Advis
ory Board, which was accepted at the
polls yesterday. The rule adopted for
electing men to this board reads "that
the president of the Associated Stud
ents of Stanford University be a mem
ber ex-officio, and two senior members
be elected by the Executive Commit
tee, but not necessarily from the com
mittee." Thus Wilson takes his seat
I by virtue of his office as president.
Ifnle for This Year Only.
This rule is temporary and will
last only for the work of the present
year. At the next student body elec
tion a permanent method for naming
this committee will in all probability
be adopted by amendment to the con
stitution. These three will serve with
the alumni and faculty members for
the present semester.
Probable* Michigan Meet.
An offer which has been received
from the University of Michigan for a
track meet at Ann Arbor in the spring
was discussed by the committee, but
no definite decision was made regard
ing the matter. The offer, which was
made by the Chairman of Athletics at
Michigan, includes a contribution of
$600 toward the expenses of the Card
inal track team. May 20 is the date
suggested for the meet, which would
enable the Stanford aggregation to
■ s-top over 011 the way to the I. C. A. A.
A. A. meet.
The purchase of a new shell for
crew was authorized, since the ship
ment of the Poughkeepsie boat is
deemed impractical. It would cost
over $400 to get the shell back to the
campus for the season's training and
ship it to the Hudson again to race
this summer. Furthermore, the boat
experts of the east say that such a
long trip would render the shell unfit
for a race, it is absolutely necessary
that a boat lie on hand as soon as
possible.
The new shell, which will cost
about $600, will be ordered at once
from the Seattle Boat Building com
pany, and it is expected, will arrive
in five weeks. The Poughkeepsie
shell will, of course, he left on the
Hudson for use in June.
