# BEHRENS, BRADEN AND WILSON REPRESENT STUDENT BODY
## TO SERVE ON ATHLETIC BOARD Executive Committee Discusses Michigan Offer For a Track Meet 
### 
Student Body President Wilson,
J Graduate Manager Behrens, and J. It.
I Braden, football captain-elect, were
chosen, last night, by the Executive
Committee, to represent the Asso
ciated Students on the Athletic Advis
ory Board, which was accepted at the
polls yesterday. The rule adopted for
electing men to this board reads "that
the president of the Associated Stud
ents of Stanford University be a mem
ber ex-officio, and two senior members
be elected by the Executive Commit
tee, but not necessarily from the com
mittee." Thus Wilson takes his seat
I by virtue of his office as president.
Ifnle for This Year Only.
This rule is temporary and will
last only for the work of the present
year. At the next student body elec
tion a permanent method for naming
this committee will in all probability
be adopted by amendment to the con
stitution. These three will serve with
the alumni and faculty members for
the present semester.
Probable* Michigan Meet.
An offer which has been received
from the University of Michigan for a
track meet at Ann Arbor in the spring
was discussed by the committee, but
no definite decision was made regard
ing the matter. The offer, which was
made by the Chairman of Athletics at
Michigan, includes a contribution of
$600 toward the expenses of the Card
inal track team. May 20 is the date
suggested for the meet, which would
enable the Stanford aggregation to
â–  s-top over 011 the way to the I. C. A. A.
A. A. meet.
