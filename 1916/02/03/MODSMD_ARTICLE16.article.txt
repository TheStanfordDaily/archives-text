# Arithmetic and Men
## 
### 
There are now 324 men living in
Encina, and 310 are 011 the waiting
list, who are applying for rooms. The
students 011 the outside, who want ac
commodations in the hall are six
more in number, than those inside.
This is simple arithmetic which shows
that a new dormitory can he filled as
soon as it can be built.
With sufficient room to house them,
there will be little trouble in getting
practically all of the men of the Uni
versity to live 011 the campus. They
are fighting for the chance now. The
advantages that this will give in uni
fying student government are evident.
On the campus, the freshman will
receive the training he needs in his
first year at college. All the students
will be brought in closer touch with
affairs, and this will bring the de
sired co-operation in student govern
ment. It is a significant fact that 1
majority of at least the petty difficul
ties of the Student Council have been
with offenders living off the campus.
The construction of another dormi
tory should precede all other building
011 the campus. If lack of funds is
the only thing standing in the way of
such a building, there is nothing for
which the first funds available could
be better used.
With all the men on the campus,
student government could be reorgan
ized on an almost ideal basis. The
big problem of the present reorganiza
tion plans is to secure the co-opera
tion of the men who are not centered
around the Quad, in their out-of-class
hours. A unity of responsibility and
co-operation in student government
will be realized, when a centraliza
tion of residence is attained.
