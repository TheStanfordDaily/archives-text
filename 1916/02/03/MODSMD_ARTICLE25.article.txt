Leap year is a success.
Eight engagements announced in
one evening was the enviable record
achieved at Roble at the last meeting
of the Romance Club.
The young ladles concerned have
requested that their names be with
held from publication until parental
blessings have arrived, and further
declare that the many showers have
been a bit premature.
The fortunate young men are Mr.
Ernest Workman, of Sunnyvale; the
Rev. C. Krit. Sorrow, well known
clergyman of Alviso; M. D. Degree,
ex-'lf>, now engaged in engineering in
Panama; Mr. Owen Nickols, of Csila
basas, Cal.; Mr. Peter Out, of the All-
Night and Day Bank, Berkeley; Mr.
Phillip Quickly, manager of the Stand
ard Oil in Redwood, Cal., and Mr.
Justin Longpants, of Watsonville.
