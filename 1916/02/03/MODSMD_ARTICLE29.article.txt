# Double Plays
## 
### 
Stevens, while one of the locals'
best bets along fielding lines, lias not
been sticking much this season. His
luck or his eye took a decided change
for the better yesterday. In three trips
to the plate he connected, for two safe
ones and was robbed out of the third
bingle, a line drive over second.
The above robbing of "Mush" Stev
ens was the main fielding feature of
the game. The ball looked like a sure
double to right-center, but Burns, the
visiting second baseman, leaped high
into the air and speared it. Stevens
has a clear case of highway robbery.
Gus Hoever did not work at all in
tlie game between the varsity and St.
Ignatius. He shoved them over on the
side lines, however, and looked to be
O. K. for the weekend contest with
the Ireland's Independents. Mattel
and Hurley also seem to have some
thins on the ball this year and should
give the old standbys a hard rub for
their jobs.
Howe clearly demonstrated to the
local baseball bugs that he can come
back. Yesterday he twirled a four
hit game and had things his own way
at all times. He is also a good field
ing pitcher and hits the ball when
hits mean runs. With Hoever, Howe,
and Wickersliam, as mainstays, Cap
tain Dent has a well rounded staff of
flingers to commence the season with.
"Doc" Hayes, with three healthy
bingles, led the varsity in slugging
yesterday. "Doc" looks fine around
the first base sack, fielding his posi
tion well on all occasions. His hitting
will also help the Cardinal this sea
j son if lie keeps up at the same rate
| be is going at present.
The Stanford fans were treated to
! some excellent umpiring in the St.
Ignatius game. McCarthy of the Coast
League and formerly of the American
League, handled the indicator.
