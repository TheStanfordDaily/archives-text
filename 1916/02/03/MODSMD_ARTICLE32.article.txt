# Crew Squads Again Work Out on Redwood Estuary
## 
### 
Crew workouts on Redwood estuar.v
were resumed this afternoon after an
, enforced vacation since last Sunday
morning. Since Monday tlie tide has
been so low that the lagoon was prac
tically dry, making it impossible for
the crew to launch the shell. During
the early part of the week the oars
men have had to confine their activ
l ities to light workouts on Lagunita,
but owing to the limited facilities on
hand there they have been aide to do
; little but keep in training.
The men who made the trip to the
bay today are as follows:
Varsity—Hatch, coxswain; Maurer,
stroke; Green, Orme, Rogers,* .laco
mini, Worth, Steinbeck, and Neuner,
I bow.

Russell, stroke; Keller, Coleman, An
drews, McNulty, Kester, Howling, and
