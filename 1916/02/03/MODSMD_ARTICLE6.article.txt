# MASQUERS PREPARED FOR TWINKLE OF FOOTLIGHTS
## ACTORS LIKE PROFESSIONALS Three Lively Plays on Program For Campus Entertainment Tomorrow Night 
### 
Masquers' cast is ready for the Hash
of the footlights. Modern drama a la
J carte instead of table d'hote—imagin
atively speaking—will be served to
theatrical epicureans in the Assembly
| Hall, tomorrow evening at 8:15. Mas
| quers' bill-of-fare includes three
j courses, carefully prepared and well
seasoned—courses that have been tried
: and not found wanting by connois
seurs in the United States and Eng
land.
There will be nothing amateurish
tomorrow. There will be no dead
minor parts—that is one of the many
reasons why three one-act plays will
lie more satisfying and refreshing
than three hours of a single theme.
j \ Fistful! of Life.
"Happiness" is a big fistful of life,
| put up in appetizing form for distri
bution. by one J. Hartley Manners, the
inventor of "Peg o' My Heart."
"Happiness" will be capably distrib
uted tomorrow night by four proven
Stanford actors: Marion Vaughan,
- '16, in the role of Mis. Ohrysal-Pole,
society woman; Florence Stewart, '16,
as Jenny—vocation: shopgirl at six a
week: avocation: purveyor of hap
piness gratis: Dana llurks, '18, as
Philip Chandros, a "man-friend," and
A. I). Wilkie, 'IS, as Fritz Scowcroft,
man-about-town and a father.
The Assembly Hall stage is too
small to hold all the life that i-;
ib.ought together in "Hop o' My
Thumb." This English comedy gives
, opportunity for six parts—each a bin
i part— and for character work that
mediocre ability could not get away
with. "Hop o' My Thumb" will hold
j its audience firmly in its grasp, and
leave them wondering, after the cur
tain.
As Amanda, laundry-girl-specializ
ing-on-shirts, Miss Ellen Galpin, '17,
is but one of the six who will put over
an act that is professional in quality.
Geraldine Cluff, listed as "Celeste, of
the Laundry," will bo Celeste of the
Laundry, and Celeste of London, from
the ground up, in a clever portrayal
of the walk, talk, and mannerisms of
the real thing in England.
Dorothy Metz, '17, lives tho part of
another type of London girl—one who
'as a 'ilsband and a 'ome. Miss Metz
lias perfected the swagger and the air
of superiority that her lines demand.
Nana Stevick, '17. sharp-tempered her
self, as llose Jordan, is forced to stand
considerable rough treatment at the
hands of the wrathful Amanda. She
pulls through the ordeal with a ven
geance, in between times rendering a
hig quantity of good acting.
Louisette Aubert, '10. will give a
truthful .vivacious picture of the kind
of Frenchwoman who runs things in
her own laundry. Iter dialect is ex
ceed ingly praiseworthy.
Frank McCulloeh, '17, as Horace
Oreensmith, plays the one male role
in "Hop." McCulloch has a difficult
role, to say the least. He covers tin 1
wide range of emotions required with
even more skill than was exhibited bv
him in previous appearances in the
ernhly Hall.
Alice MacDougal, '16, will be given
a chance In "Rosalind" to show her
ability, in the double part of Mrs.
Page. Miss MacDougal puts herself
completely into her part, with the re
sult that a polished interpretation is
presented.
Goodwin Knight, '1!». plays opposit"
Miss MacDougal in a role that calls
for a severe test, of dramatic abilitv.
As Charles, be forces Mrs. Page to
play her hand, even though he is tli"
buffer for her whims.
