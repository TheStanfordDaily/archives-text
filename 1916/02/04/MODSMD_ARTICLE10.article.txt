# English Club Will Stage Strong Play
## Chooses "The Great Divide" For Assembly Hall Production on March 3d 
### 
English Club today announced the
production of William Vaughn Moody's
powerful and popular American
drama, "The Great Divide," lor the
evening of March 3, in the Assembly
Hall. Every effort will be made to
present the most artistic and faithful
reproduction that has graced the Stan
ford stage since "The Only Way" es
tablished a high-water mark for stud
ent dramatic endeavor. W. B. Owens,
'11, who starred as "Sydney Carton"
iu the presentation of "The Only
Way," has consented to assist the Eng
lish Club in the production, which es
tablished the stellar positions of
Henry Miller and Margaret Anglin in
the original New York cast a few
years ago.
"The Great Divide" has been fre
quently bailed as the nebulous "great
American drama," more than one
critic declaring it the inevitable fore
runner of a new native stage litera
ture. It is, indeed, an effective treat
ment of a vital theme—the lifting of a
man from brutality to nobility through
the power of earthly love —always ma
terial for dramatic power.
The "great divide" is the boundary
between Ruth Jordan's Eastern re
finement and Stephen Ghent's Western
primitiveness. The girl, however, lives
to learn that, when the "great divide"
lias finally been crossed, life looms
larger for her than ever before. The
action of the play, set for the most
part in the Rocky Mountains, cul
minates in a New England home—an
example of one of the effective con
trasts in the piece. Life-like and well
defined characters enact moving
srenes in this virilp nlnv r»f u/hi«'h tho
dialogue is a masterpiece of stage
craft.
Tryouts will be held Saturday after
noon at 1:30 o'clock, in room 214, of
the English building, for the twelve
masculine roles of the play, varying
from Mexican greasers to New En
gland aristocrats.
