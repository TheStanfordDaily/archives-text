# Double Plays

At least fifty rubber lunged fans
warmed the bleachers at the St. Igna
tius game on Wednesday. They putin
all they had in the way of rooting,
making up for the parlor decorations
who failed to putin an appearance.
These diamond enthusiasts were
amply paid for their interest in the
team.
"Habe" Dent is very much pleased
with the showing of the squad as 1
whole. Everyone out seems to have
the work spirit and the practices are
snappy. Another pleasing feature is
the hitting of the men. Several players
are banging the pill on the nose regu
larly.
Two defeats at the hands of the
Agnews nine, jerked the Cardinal
hopes down for a day or two. Reports
from Santa Clara to the effect that
the Mission Town team had also met
defeat twice in the last two weeks by
the Hospital nine, put the local dis
asters in a different light.
Exceptionally good ball was pro
duced last night when the Whites and
the Hlacks of the Peanut League
struggled in close competition for four
innings. The close of the game found
the Whites on top with a three to two
lead. The heavy hitting of Hawks
and Coleman was responsible for the
victory, each of these boys getting a
two-bagger. The batteries for the
game were: Whites —Coleman and
Hawks; Blacks —Wright and Hurley.
Missing first base has cost two
Stanford veterans three-baggers al
ready this season. Hayes connected
for a triple at Agnews nd was called
out for missing the initial station, and
Dent poled one for three bags in the
St. Ignatius game, and was sent to
the bench for his failure to step on the
first sack enroute. As the scorer can
not give the batter even a single on
such a play, it is highly probable that
the sluggers "will touch 'em all the
way 'round" the next time.
Dickey is playing a much improved
article of ball this year. The latest
combination on the varsity is Dick
back at the shortfield berth. His field
ing has been O. Kin the last few
games, and the hit column records his
name more than once. The fact is,
the whole infield —Hayes, Stafford,
Dickey, and Stevens —are playing nice
ball at the present time. The first
two are also strong with the willow.
Play in the Peanut League last night
resulted in a second victory for the
Reds over a crippled team of the
Ulues, 7-4 being the score. Phares
and Card formed the battery for the
Reds, while Lyon and Thomas did the
honors for the Blues.
