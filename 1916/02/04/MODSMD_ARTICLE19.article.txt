# TRI-STATE DEBATERS TO UPHOLD STANFORD ARE CHOSEN
## SIX MEN QUALIFY FOR TEAM Morosco, McClintock, Driscoll, Field, Ames and French Are Successful 
### 
Six men were chosen to represent
Stanford on the Tri-State debating
team at the tryouts lield yesterday
afternoon. Owing to the fact that a
high degree of efficiency has been
maintained by the Stanford forensic
artists during the past two years,
a large list of men were 011 hand yes
terday for the purpose of endeavoring
to make a place on the team. Stan
ford won an overwhelming victory in
the Tri-State last year by defeating
the Washington and Oregon Univer
sities. The same northern schools
will be the competitors this year.
Out of a field of twenty contestants
the largest number that has tried for
many years past, the following were
chosen: F. S. Field, '18, A. H. Mor
osco, 'IG, M. L. McClintock, '18, J. G.
Driscoll, '18, E. R. Ames, '17, and R.
H. French, MS.
The sides of the question have not
yet been assigned but it is probable
that the negative team will journey
to Seattle to contest against Washing
ton, the same as it did last year. The
Oregon team will probably be visitors
on the campus again.
Morosco, who was chosen as one
of the members of the team, has taken
a prominent part in debating during
his attendance at Stanford. The
honor of class orator has been award
ed him by the graduating class of 'ir>.
Several of his essays have been en
tered in the Merwick and other prize
winning contests. He was a member
of the intercollegiate debating team
in his freshman year, and was also a
member of the same body in the last
intercollegiate contest. Me is a mem
ber of Delta Sigma Rho debating fra
ternity.
Field, another one of those chosen,
was a member of the intercollegiate
debating team of the University of
Southern California. He transferred
to Stanford, registering the early
part of last semester. The other
members of the team have been inter
ested in the various lines of Stanford
debating and have alwdays played an
important part in this activity. The
combination bids fair to repeating the
Tri-State victory of last year. The
question which was discussed yester
day wasâ€”"Resolved, That the United
States should maintain its navy above
third rank in fighting efficiency." The
judges who selected the team were
Professor Woodward of the Stanford
Law department. Professor Brown of
the Philosophy department, and Karl
Leib, former intercollegiate debater.
