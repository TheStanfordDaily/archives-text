Kellogg !ilid Seward Talk.
Conditions in Belgium were vividly
portrayed by Professor Vernon Lyman
Kellogg, head of the Stanford Ento
mology department, and Assistant
Professor Samuel Swayze Seward, Jr.,
of the English department, who ad
dressed a large audience in the Palo
Alto Methodist Church, last evening.
According to Kellogg, half of the men
engaged in relief work are from the
state of California, and fifty per cent
of this number are from Stanford.
Wireless Company <>els Lease.
The Federal Telegraph Com pan v
was last night granted a lease by tho
city council of Palo Alto by whicn
they will use two acres of the munic
ipal land between the railroad tracks
and the state highway for a factory
site. The demand for the wireless
equipment they manufacture has in
creased to such an extent that their
present location is not large enough
for the plant.
