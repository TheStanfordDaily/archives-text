Bonnheim Discussion tonight at 7:30
in the chapel, although it is cus
tomary for but four to compete for
the fifty dollar prize for the best oral
presentation of the Bonnheim disser
tations. This has been made neces
sary by the finding of a paper of first
rank which had been mislaid in the
Registrar's office, and which, in the
opinion of the judges, entitled its
writer to appear in the discussion.

ning dissertations had already been
made, it was considered the most just
treatment of the situation to allow the
original four and the later paper also
to be given tonight, so that the selec
tion of the best presented discussion
of the subject of the Bonnheim '"The
Relation of the State to the Problem
of the Unemployed," will tonight be
made from five speakers. These men
