# MASQUERS TO PRESENT REAL LIFE PROBLEM
## 
### 
Once to every mail, at least, the
course of life's events brings a crisis
that for the time being wipes out all
memory of the past, and all vision of
the future. At that time, the present
seems all. Everything is an inner
struggle—a conflict between emotions.
In "Hop o' My Thumb," just such a
crisis enters into the life of a young
girl. How she meets it, fights down
the most powerful of her own emo
tions, and surprises the man in the
case, is amazing.
Rain or shine, hail or snow, the
players who have been rehearsing for
Masquers' three-part dramatic treat,
are going to act their way into the
hearts of a Stanford audience in the
Assembly I tall tonight.
The order of events will be Man
ner's "Happiness," "Hop o' My
Thumb," then Harrie's "Rosalind." A
number of dramatic reputations are
going to be made tonight—three plays
with greater opportunity for a wide
range of emotion could hardly have
been selected.
Those who can claim pasteboards
will hud in realistic "Happiness" a
delicious object lesson —perhaps the
password to their own happiness.
They will find in "Hop" and in "Hor
ace Greensmith" the kind of stuff they
will travel far to see portrayed
again—a cross section from the life
of two very unusual—and perhaps for
that reason, very human —personages.
They will find in "Rosalind" one of
the cleverest bits of fancy ever writ
ten —a chapter for the life of a
woman who denies herself love, and
of the man who is blinded by his
love for her.
