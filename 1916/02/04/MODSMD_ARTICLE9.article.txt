## TRACK MEET HERE APRIL 15 First Baseball Game Scheduled at California on April 18. Crew Race April 22 
### 
Graduate Manager Behrens and
Johnny Stroud, California's manage' 1 ,
met last night at the Olympic Club
in San Francisco, and decided on tent
ative dates for track, crew, and base
ball competition between the Cardinal
and Blue and Gold. The dates chosen
may have to be changed later, but
the possibility of this is small.
April 15 is the date set for the
track and field meet, which will be
held at Stanford. On the morning of
the same day the second baseball
game will be played on the Cardinal
diamond. This game was at first
scheduled for April 1, but has been
changed, together with the date for
the first baseball game. This was to
have been played on March 25, but
will now be staged April 8. The third
game, if necessary to decide the cham
pionship, will take place at California
on the afternoon of the crew races.
The intercollegiate regatta, which
will be held as usual on the Alameda
estuary, was set for April 22. This
date is the least sure of any, as tide
conditions may make a change neces
sary. A heavy flood is expected on
the morning of April 22, which would
make racing very difficult. Whether
or not Washington will take part on
this day is not yet known. It is pos
sible, however, that a return race
may be scheduled to take place then,
since the Cardinal oarsmen will meet
Washington at Seattle on April S,
according to present plans.
