# CARDINAL BALL TOSSERS DROP FAST GAME TO INDEPENDENTS
## CLIFF IRELAND RECEIVES FOB Billy Orr Stars For Visitors With Running Catches in Outfield 
### 
Featuring Cliff Ireland as a head
liner, the Independents treated the
Cardinal ball fans to the fastest game
of the season, Saturday, when they
slipped a 4 to 1 win over the Stanford
varsity. During the greater part of
the game, "Old Sol" beamed out from
behind the clouds, putting snap into
the players and adding enthusiasm to
a large crowd.
Many Big Leaguers.
Big league talent in abundance was
embraced in the visitors' lineup.
Billy Orr, former Cardinal coach and
American and Coast League short
stop; Hal Chase, considered by many
experts as the peer of first sackers;
George Kelly, first baseman of the
New York Nationals; Eddie Burns,
catcher of the World's Champion
Phillies; Risberg, star of the Venice
Coasters; Sammy Bohne, St. Louis
pastimer and future shortstop of the
San Francisco Seals, and a number of
other lesser lights, but well known
ball tossers, cavorted on the Stanford
diamond.
Final Result l iicerta/n.
During no period of the contest was
the final result certain, and it was
not until the last Cardinal .batsman
was retired after nine innings of play,
that the cohorts of the jovial Cliff
Ireland felt that the game was on
ice. The local contingent looked like
a winner, getting their lone run in
the first frame, when "Doc" Hayes
circled the paths on a wild throw of
Bohne and an error by Tommy Sliee
han. Although the varsity had men
on the bases at different stages of the
game, they could not bring them in.
On two occasions scores were pre
vented by phenomenal fielding 011 the
part of Orr and Kelly.
Two tallies were brought across by
the Independents in the third inning
on a single by Orr, two errors by
Hayes, and a fielder's choice, Orr and
Crespi, the visiting twirler, scoring,
i Another run was chalked up in the
next frame, when Risberg singled,
Bohne walked, and Dent cut loose with
a wild peg, permitting the former to
score. The last tally was rung up
in the fourth 011 a single by Burns and
a double by Kelly. This was the only
earned run of the game.
ClilT Ireland (Jets Fob.
Beside the regular baseball features
such as a fast double play in the sev
enth, Sanborn to Stafford, and the
speed of some of the visitors in hand
ling difficult balls, the presentation of
a gold fob to Cliff Ireland from the
Associated Students was the prom
inent event of the afternoon. Cliff re
sponded with a short speech, in which
he expressed his appreciation of the
thoughtfulness of the Stanford stu
dents. He also said that he had sent
many things 112. o. b., but this was the
first time that he had ever received
one.
