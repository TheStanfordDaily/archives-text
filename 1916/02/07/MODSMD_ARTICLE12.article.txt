from 0,000 to 10,000 students, and play
us a game of rugby next fall. I realize
that you have other athletic relations,
but you ought to he able to take us

lar—but I've noticed it at others and
my own university, that this quality
of simplicity usually degrades into a
quality of slouchiness. The college

every week.
"Generosity of spirit and heart and
action must characterize the acts of

must learn to make a living, but to do
something more —to serve his com
munity and to take an active part in
all its acts and actions."
