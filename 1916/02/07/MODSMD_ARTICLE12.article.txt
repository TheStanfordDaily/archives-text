# SPEAKS OF ATHLETIC PEACE
## Expresses Hope That Blue and Gold Will Return to Game of Rugby 
### 
"I'm glad we almost have our ath
letic difficulties patched up. 1 only
hope that you will get together about
fifteen men out of your vast body of
from 0,000 to 10,000 students, and play
us a game of rugby next fall. I realize
that you have other athletic relations,
but you ought to he able to take us
on with your left hand and clean up
the other universites, too."
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Stanford's
new president, thus spoke to a crowd
ed audience in Harmon Gymnasium,
Friday. His appearance was his of
ficial introduction to the student body
of the University of California.
President Wheeler Agrees.
President Wheeler expressed the
same sentiment in regard to athletics
in his talk at the San Francisco Uni
versity Club, Saturday evening.
President Wilbur's reference to the
athletic situation was a mere pass
ing reference, in an address on the
ideals of Americans and their appli
cation to college life. Throughout,
Dr. Wilbur brightened the faces of his
audience with a number of excellent
stories and jokes. When he referred
to the athletic situation he said that
if California would get up a rugby
team "it would make all of us at Palo
Alto feel very happy and " But
he said enough, for a ripple of good
natured laughter passed through the
audience. Stanford's new president
drove his point home as forcibly as
it could be done.
