# For Sports' Sake
## 
### 
The season wears itself away and
the coaching problem remains un
settled. All the preliminary steps
have been taken now to insure a sat
isfactory agreement, but necessary de
lays in organizing the new machinery
of athletic control have put off the
final decision of the important ques
tion and Stanford teams remain with
out coaches, with three weeks of the
training season passed.
The advisory committee meets to
night for organization and the first
discussion of its work. But members
of the board have announced that it
will limit its activities to its advisory
capacity and leave initiative in all
cases to the students. This leaves it
up to officials of the student body to
have tentative plans ready for the ad
visory board just as soon as they can
be given consideration.
President Wilbur has expressed
himself as being in sympathy with the
idea of sport for sport's sake, but
adds that a team that is turned out
that is not prepared to beat its rival
and does not go on the field with the
intention of doing everything possible
and sportsmanlike to accomplish that
end is not worthy of representing the
University. The president seems to
express the position of students about
as well as it can be done.
Coaches are necessary for sport
conducted for sport's sake as well as
to turn out winning teams. The pres
ence of skilled coaches will insure
good results in both of the ends
of athletics. A track, crew, or base
ball captain might be able to take a
squad of ten or fifteen men, give a fair
cbance to each one, and pick out the
best crew or team possible from the
aggregation. But with a squad of
sixty or more men out for each sport
the job is too big for one man, and
both a good coach and a good captain,
who will work together, are needed.
