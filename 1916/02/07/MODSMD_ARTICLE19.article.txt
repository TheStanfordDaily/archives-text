Through an inadvertant omission in
the account of Senior appointments in
Friday's issue of The Daily Palo Alto,
the naming of A. H. Morosco, '16, as
Class Orator was not noted. Morosco
! has been very active in debating at
Stanford. He won a place on the Tri-
State squad Thursday, and has twice
been a member of intercollegiate
teams, lie has participated in other
public speaking contests on the cam
pus, and is a member of Delta Sigma
Rho, the national debating fraternity,
and Delta Chi.
