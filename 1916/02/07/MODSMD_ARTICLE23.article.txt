# Double Plays
## 
### 
Jt is a great wonder that so many
fans putin an appearance Saturday,
for there seemed to lie a sort of jinx
about the scheduled Stanford-lnde
pendents' game. It had been slated
for a campus attraction on three dif
ferent occasions, but owing to un
settled weather conditions had to be
laid by the boards. Many felt that the
local rooters wouldn't get an oppor
tunity to !jee the "stars" in action this
year.
"Cliff" Ireland's appearance was a
pleasant surprise. He has given up
baseball for good, and owing to a re
cent illness, it was not expected that
he would accompany the team this
time. The fans enjoy Cliff's sideline
comedy. He ranks with the best of
them at the coachers' box funny stuff.
The double play pulled by Sanborn
and Stafford in the seventh inning was
worth the admission price itself. It is
not often that Eddie Burns is caught
off second base on a fly to left field.
Sanborn's peg was perfect, showing an
arm such as is seldom seen on a col
lege diamond.
Billy Orr was caught at second on
some fast work by the Stanford
players. Orr had singled to center
and was trying to stretch it into a
double on Lander's throw in to Hayes.
"Doc" snapped the ball to Stafford,
however, and t lie "Leaguer" was flag
ged at second.
Crespi, who twirled for the visitors,
is one of the mainstays of the present
Oakland Coast League pitching staff.
He served nice ball at all periods of
the game, not walking a man and
allowing but seven bingles, three of
which were decidedly scratchy,
Wickersliam pitched an excellent
game also. Only one of the four runs
chalked up by the Independents was
earned, the other three coming across
on errors.
Speaking about errors, several er
rors of judgement were made, Satur
day, that do not show in the box score.
There was no excuse for not making a
double play in the third inning, when,
with a man on first and second and
one down, the play was made to first
instead of playing for two men. One
or two of the Cardinal infielders play
ed too deep on ground balls, also.
Speed merchants such as the oppon
ents of last Saturday can only be put
out by fast fielding and quick throw
ing.
