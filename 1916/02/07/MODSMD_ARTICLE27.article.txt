# STANFORD MEN NOT SNOBS---DR. JORDAN
## Discipline Is Key Word of Sunday Evening Meeting at Encina 
### 
"Stanford men are not snobbish,'' j
says Chancellor David Starr Jordan. |
The statement was made at a meeting
ot' the men of the University at En
cina Hall, held under the auspices of
the Y. M. C. A., at which Dr. Jordan
spoke on "Being a Man."
According to Dr. Jordan, "there may
be virtue among the Yale boys who
are all alike, who have a bulldog at
the end of a string and one front tooth
knocked out, but it is better to be as
the Stanford man." Chancellor Jor
dan believes that Dr. Fitch did not
entirely hit the right key when he
branded Stanford men as being snob
bish, one week ago, at a Sunday night
Encina meeting.
Three Kinds of Discipline.
"There are three kinds of disci
pline," said Dr. Jordan, during his
talk. "First, a sort of paternal dis
cipline, where a man is put through
a course ot' sprouts and made to do
things blindly. This is - the system
in the German and other armies.
"Then there is the discipline 011 the
inside, such as we have at the Univer
sity, where every man figures out
what's right and does it. In America
every man looks after himself, and
makes his salary whatever he wants it.
Hoover High Example.
"There is still a higher form known
as social discipline, in which a man
does things for his fellow men. There
is 110 better example of this than Her
bert Clark Hoover, who has been feed
ing a whole nation."
Dr. Jordan's talk was replete with
his usual pithy and epigramatic re
marks. "A mistake is what we call a
Nemesis," he said. "You can figure
that out for yourself."
Keep Busy, Says Dr. Jordan.
"Keep busy at something. A great
element of success is having a goal
and working for it.
"A man ought not to let people turn
him from his purpose unless they can
show him something better.
"Too many of us in college are in
clined toward the lowbrow. We don't
think of the fine things in life that
make us better.
"It is important to learn to work
in the minority. One can't work long
with an ideal without encountering
opposition.
"A man is not going to be success
ful by accident.
"A man is not going to be happy
without laying a foundation for it.
"Happiness is largely bound up in
finding the right mate."

"Stanford men are not snobbish,'' j
says Chancellor David Starr Jordan. |
The statement was made at a meeting
ot' the men of the University at En
cina Hall, held under the auspices of
the Y. M. C. A., at which Dr. Jordan
spoke on "Being a Man."
According to Dr. Jordan, "there may
be virtue among the Yale boys who
are all alike, who have a bulldog at
the end of a string and one front tooth
knocked out, but it is better to be as
the Stanford man." Chancellor Jor
dan believes that Dr. Fitch did not
entirely hit the right key when he
branded Stanford men as being snob
bish, one week ago, at a Sunday night
Encina meeting.
Three Kinds of Discipline.
"There are three kinds of disci
pline," said Dr. Jordan, during his
talk. "First, a sort of paternal dis
cipline, where a man is put through
a course ot' sprouts and made to do
things blindly. This is - the system
in the German and other armies.
"Then there is the discipline 011 the
inside, such as we have at the Univer
sity, where every man figures out
what's right and does it. In America
every man looks after himself, and
makes his salary whatever he wants it.
Hoover High Example.
"There is still a higher form known
as social discipline, in which a man
does things for his fellow men. There
is 110 better example of this than Her
bert Clark Hoover, who has been feed
ing a whole nation."
Dr. Jordan's talk was replete with
his usual pithy and epigramatic re
marks. "A mistake is what we call a
Nemesis," he said. "You can figure
that out for yourself."
Keep Busy, Says Dr. Jordan.
"Keep busy at something. A great
element of success is having a goal
and working for it.
"A man ought not to let people turn
him from his purpose unless they can
show him something better.
