# DR. WILBUR NAMES ATHLETIC ADVISOR
## Hoard Meets Tonight to Discuss Athletic Policy and Elect Chairman 
### 
With the appointment last Saturday
of two faculty members and two alum
ni to the newly created Advisory Ath
letic Hoard, that body is now com
plete and will begin its work at once.
Piesident Wilbur has named Professor
A. T. Murray, present head of the
Faculty Committee on Athletics, and
Dr. H. It. Stolz, director of Encina
Gymnasium, to represent the faculty,
while the alumni members are L. W.
Cutler, '06, president of the Alumni
Association, and Dr. T. M. Williams,
'97, of Palo Alto.
It was thought advisable to limit the
faculty and alumni to two representa
tives each, instead of three, in order
to prevent the board from becoming
unwieldly. President Wilbur will be
a member ex-officio.
The committee will meet this eve
ning to organize itself and attend to
the business of electing a chairman.
The work of settling the coach prob
lem will be taken up very soon. "We
must know where we are going," said
Dr. Wilbur, Saturday, "and to accom
plish this the committee will discuss
and devise a general athletic policy.
The initiative will remain in the stu
dent body, however, for the work of
the board will be advisory in char
acter."
