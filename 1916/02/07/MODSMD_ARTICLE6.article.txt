# MASQUERS' TRIPLE BILL PROVES INTERESTING VENTURE
## THREE PLAYS LESS TAXING Production Is Successful From Artistic and Technical Viewpoint 
### 
The Masquers' triple bill of Friday
was a new venture in the history of
Assembly Hall productions and a suc
cessful one, and it sent the audience
home thinking that perhaps three
short plays were loss taxing than a
long one, anyhow.
In the first play of the evening,
"Happiness," Miss Marion Vaugliau
and Dana Burks took the laurels for
triumphant boredom. They yawned
about the stage in a most finished and
high society fashion, but escaped the
attendant evil of impelling their aud
ience to yawn with them.
Miss Florence Stewart managed to
put life and appeal into the difficult
part of the cut and dried merry sun
shine-maker, effectively rescuing the
part from its tendency to insipidness.
As the indulgently stern father, Alfred
Wilkie was all that could be desired,
but it is to be regretted that an actor
of the caliber that Wilkie has shown
to date should have no larger part in
the dramatic work of the semester.
McCulloch Scores as 'Oraee.
Miss Ellen Galpin and Frank McCul
loch in " 'Op O' My Thumb" showed
themselves as clumsily human a pair
of lovers as you could hope to find in
a real London laundry. They didn't
seem to know they were being watched
by an audience that was amusedly
following the thoughts which would
occur to their hearers long before
they would strike 'Op and 'Orace. It
pleases an audience to feel amusedly
superior, and this pair flattered theirs
to the full. The drawling superiorly
of " 'er as 'ad a 'usband," the scornful
teasing of Rose and Celeste, who had
beaux of their own, and the chatter
ing and "Mondieu-ing" of the head
laundress were effectively put across
by Dorothy Mctz. Nana Stevick, Ger
aldine fluff, and Louisette Aubert.
The most difficult role of the eve
ning was undeniably that of Mrs. Page
in "Rosalind." and it was handled by
Alice MacDoimal in very effective
fashion. She horrified and mystified
poor Charles by turns until that con
scientious youth, boyishly enacted by
Goodwin Knight, was tortured into
proposing to the woman who had just
told him that she is old enough to be
his mother. Miss Ellen Galpin showed
her versatility by doubling the pathetic
and imaginative youthfulness of 'Op
with the role of the prying, motherly
Paine Quickly.

Wilkie was all that could be desired,
but it is to be regretted that an actor
of the caliber that Wilkie has shown
to date should have no larger part in
the dramatic work of the semester.
McCulloch Scores as 'Oraee.
Miss Ellen Galpin and Frank McCul
loch in " 'Op O' My Thumb" showed
themselves as clumsily human a pair
of lovers as you could hope to find in
a real London laundry. They didn't
seem to know they were being watched
by an audience that was amusedly
following the thoughts which would
occur to their hearers long before
they would strike 'Op and 'Orace. It
pleases an audience to feel amusedly
superior, and this pair flattered theirs
to the full. The drawling superiorly
of " 'er as 'ad a 'usband," the scornful
teasing of Rose and Celeste, who had
beaux of their own, and the chatter
ing and "Mondieu-ing" of the head
laundress were effectively put across
by Dorothy Mctz. Nana Stevick, Ger
aldine fluff, and Louisette Aubert.
The most difficult role of the eve
ning was undeniably that of Mrs. Page
in "Rosalind." and it was handled by
Alice MacDoimal in very effective
fashion. She horrified and mystified
poor Charles by turns until that con
scientious youth, boyishly enacted by
Goodwin Knight, was tortured into
proposing to the woman who had just
told him that she is old enough to be
his mother. Miss Ellen Galpin showed
her versatility by doubling the pathetic
and imaginative youthfulness of 'Op
with the role of the prying, motherly
Paine Quickly.
