# Cameras Catch Crews in Early Season Workouts
## 
### 
Twenty-eight prospective Stanford
oarsmen were shot yesterday morning
while engaged in their workout on
Redwood bay. However, as the
weapon used in the attack was a
"movie" camera in the hands of a
Hearst-Vitagraph Motion Picture com
pany employee, none of the unoffend
ing Cardinals were injured. On the
other hand, all of the men are ex
tremely pleased over their experience
and are already planning trips to "the
city" to see the first exhibition of the
reels showing them at work in the
shells.
Because of the prominent position
that Stanford has attained in the realm
of crew races, the motion picture
weekly managers came to the conclus
ion that pictures of the Stanford crew
men in their early season practice
would be "live" news throughout the
country, and they are now preparing
to send out the pictures in connection
with tlie weekly current events reel.
Crew equipment on the estuary lias
been increased by the addition of the
four-oar shell which has heretofore
been used on Lagunita, and from now
on twenty-eight men will lie taken to
the bay each day. Last Saturday
eight husky freshmen crew candidates
were assigned to the task of trans
porting the shell to the Redwood
boathouse. Because of tlie difficulties
in the way of hauling it, the nine
teeners had to carry the sholl the en
tire distance from the campus to the
estuary, a distance of seven miles. On
arriving at the launching float, the
"erstwhile truck horses" attempted to
launch the shell too quickly, with the
result, that King. '19. LaForge, '10,
and Atwater, '19, went into the water
along with the boat.
On both Saturday and yesterday, the
crews were given good workouts un
der the direction of Coach Guerena.
On both days the men covered over
seven miles. Yesterday a larger num
ber of freshmen were taken to the bay
than on any previous occasion, fifteen
of the first year men being included
in the squad of twenty-eight candi
dates.
In taking the second varsity shell
out of the water after yesterday morn
ing's workout, the rudder was broken
and the shell smashed in for a dis
tance of fully four feet. It was im
possible to get the shell fixed in time
for today's workout, consequently the
second varsity men had to lay off
from practice.
The men who were taken to the bay
for today's trip are as follows:
Varsity—Willis, coxswain; Maurer,
stroke; Green, Ornie, Rogers, .Taco
mini, Worth, Steinbeck, and Neuner,
bow.
Freshmen—Lyons, coxswain; King,
stroke; McGaffey, La Forge, Watts,
Howling, Bent, Waite, and Atwater,:
bow.
Four Oar —U. Robbins, coxswain;
Heron, stroke; Jeffers, Curtis, and
Kester, bow.
