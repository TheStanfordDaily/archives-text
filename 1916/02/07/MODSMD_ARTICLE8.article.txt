# ALUMNAE PLAN LUNCHEON
## Vote Budget For Paving Walk in Front of Club House CALIFORNIA STUDENTS HEAR STANFORD PRESIDENT 
### 
The committee which has charge of
the Wednesday afternoon teas at the
Women's Club House, at the meeting
of the Resident Alumnae, Saturday,
reported that there was $204.20 in the
treasury. This sum has been made
since the latter part of October, and it
is to be used to pave the walk to the
main entrance of the Club House.
Plans were made for the Collegiate
Alumnae luncheon on March 25. This
is the first time it has met at Stanford
for several years, and there will no
doubt be a large attendance, as invi
tations have been extended to the San
Jose branch, Faculty Women's Club,
all women of the Senior Class, and
graduates of other colleges who live
either on the campus or in Palo Alto.
The luncheon will be served by Mrs.
Hurd at fifty cents a plate. Professor
Vernon Kellogg will be the speaker.
Isabel McCracken is in charge of the
luncheon.
