# MICHIGAN TRACK MEET ASSURED BY FACULTY
## MAY COMPETE IN I.C.A.A.A.A. Cardinals to Go South March 25 For Meet With L.A.A.C. in Los Angeles 
### 
Official sanction of the Stanford-
Michigan track meet to be held at
Ann Arbor on May 20, was given this
morning by President Wilbur, accord
ing to a statement from Graduate
Manager Behrens. The Stanford run
ners will go south to meet the Los
Angeles Athletic Club track squad on
March 25, at Bovard Field, University
of Southern California.
Negotiations between Graduate
Manager Behrens and the University
of Michigan officials have been pend
ing for some time, since the offer of
the Wolverines to bring the Cardinals
to the east for a contest. Faculty
sanction of the meet was given when
it was assured that the local athletes
would not have to leave Stanford un
til after the term's scholastic work
has been stowed away for the summer.
May Go To Cambridge.
It is probable that the Stanford
track men will continue eastward af
ter meeting Michigan to compete in
the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet to be held
at Cambridge, May 27. To date the
Stanford team has not been taken into
the membership of I. C. A. A. A. A.,
but it is expected that this will be ac
complished at the executive meeting
of the organization, to be held March
4. Competition in the meet at Cam
bridge will bring the local athletes
into action against the best men of
the east, and will be to the Cardinal
track squad what the Poughkeepsie
regatta is to the crew.
