What's the matter with dramatics?
J list at present it seems to be a sick
activity at Stanford. Everyone inter
ested lias diagnosed the symptoms and
has a cure for tlie malady, but lack of
concerted action has prevented the
prescription of any adequate remedy.
We are not attempting to announce
the immediate death of dramatics in
case no immediate action is taken to
give it new vitality. It's been hanging
ou in its present comatose state so
long that we are becoming accus
tomed to its condition and are begin
ning to take it for granted that it
will ever continue in that state. But
even a chronic invalid's ailment may
suddenly become acute. Anyway, a
respectable sudden death would be
preferable to a continuation of the
present downward tendency in the ac
tivity.
What are the symptoms? Small
seat sales for the production, a group
ing of most of the plays in one se
mester, a heavy cost in staging each
play, and the presence of politics and
commercialism in the management.
All the troubles are mixed up to
gether, and some are dependent on
others, but this seems to be a fair
classification.
Dr. Talmadge said: "Let the peoplo
talk; it will do good as long as
nothing bad can be said." But talking
alone is not solving the dramatic
problemâ€”possibly because there are
bad things which can be said. Some
students interested in dramatics have
suggested a general board represent
ing the organizations, to control all
productions. Co-operation through
such a board would cut down ex
penses, increase seat sales through
better advertising methods, authorize a
proper distribution of plays, and go a
long way toward eliminating the other
objectionable features of dramatics as
it is now managed.
Let the people who are advocating
such a board do something tangible
towards having it organized. The
idea has in it big possibilities for the
future of dramatics.
