Play in the peanut league yesterday
afternoon resulted in a victory for the
Reds over the Blacks. The two teams
were evenly matched and Hayes' Reds
just did manage to squeeze the neces
sary run over. Draper of the Reds
was in excellent form, though a little
wild ,as was Clark for the Blacks. No
hits were gleaned by either team.
Captain Hastings is resolved to ob
tain revenge in tonight's play on the
auxiliary field. The Reds are leading
the league at present, with three vic
tories and no defeats.

After four innings of baseball,
smeared by many errors, the Whites
finally defeated the Blues yesterday
in the peanut league, the score stand
ing 5 to 2 when the last man was re
tired. Phil Twohy pitched a fair game
for the winning team.
While the peanut leaguers were
battling on the auxiliary and faculty
fields, yesterday, the varsity and
freshmen held one of the snappiest
workouts of the season on the var
sity diamond. Following closely the
instructions of "Cap" Dent, the in
fielders spent much time in practicing
the fielding of slow hit ground balls.
The men were picking them up on the
run and snapping them over to the
initial cushion in great style.

Along with Ireland's 112. o. 1)., Umpire

seemed to lie well balanced, the men
having good arms, being fair fielders
and good stickers.

It. will be noticed in the averages
; below, that only two men are meeting
the ball above the 300 mark. Several
of the varsity stickers are within
range, however, and after a few more
practice games it is hoped that the
team as a whole will be slugging the
pill at a better clip. The boys are
fielding well, considering the lack of
practice, errors always being more
prevalent at this time of the season
than at any other period.
