Do you usually go to "Sticky's" be
tween dances?
Lots of fun. isn't it?
'It'd be better though, if you could
get your "Lovers' Delight" or "Rasp
berry Sundaes" right in the gym,
wouldn't it?
Yes? Anyway, that's what \V. H.
Bloeser of the crew dance committee
thought, so he has arranged for.1
room in the gymnasium to be fitted
out as a refreshment parlor, and all
who attend the "On to Poughkeepsie"
dance in the gymnasium Friday eve
ning will lie able to buy refreshments
without even leaving the building.
Profits from this venture will be used
to swell the crew fund.
When the dance was originally an
nounced, it was stated that there
would be no programs. However, as
many of those who are planning to
attend have been making out pro
grams, the committee has decided to
make it a program affair, and will
give programs at the door.
Over 150 couples are expected to
attend the dance. This number has
almost been reached, while Graduate
Manager Behrens and the members of
the crew are still selling tickets.
The music to be furnished at the
dance will be in the nature of a new
departure for campus dances, as ar
rangements have been made to have
two orchestras and the Stanford band
present.
