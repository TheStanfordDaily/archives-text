### 
Numerous traditions which marked
the good old days of life on the Stan
ford "Farm" will be reinstated at the
Senior-Junior Jolly-Up scheduled for
February 21 in Encina Hall. In ac
cordance with the old custom, busses
will stop at Roble and Madrone halls
to call for the upperclass women.
They will return to their various resi
dences in the same manner. No
transportation facilities have as yet
been arranged for the men. Tradi
tion demands that stiff collars,
"queening" and fine clothes be strictly
011 the taboo list. Middy blouses for
the women will be decidedly in vogue
at the jolly-up.
Chairman J. S. Bullis of the Senior
jolly-up committee announces that
several leap year dances will be in
troduced for the benefit of the bash
ful male contingent. Prizes are to be
awarded to the handsomest man pres
ent, the most popular girl, and to the
best dancing couple.

and the committee promises that
merit, rather than political motives,
will be the basis for the presentation
of the trophies. Several "straight"
dances will be interspersed among the
"Paul Jones." Plans for the "eats'*
and "stunts" have not been announced
as yet, but no trouble or expense is
being spared in their preparation.
