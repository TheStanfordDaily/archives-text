### 
Informality will be the keynote of
the reception given at the Union,
Thursday night, in honor of Dr. Wil
bur. No definite program has been ar
ranged, and formal speeches will be
out of order, the purpose of the
smoker being primarily to give all the
men students of the University an op
portunity to meet and know Stan
ford's new president personally.
President Glad to Meet All.
Every man, from freshman to grad
uate. is urged to drop in for a few
minutes and take advantage of this
opportunity to meet Dr. Wilbur, who,
as he expressed in his address in the
Assembly Hall, is anxious to know
personally every man registered in the
University. This will be a big task
and if President Wilbur remembers
the name of every one whom he meets
Thursday night he will have already
succeeded in a large measure.
The smoker is being given by the
Board of Governors of the Union, who
have promised to furnish smokes in
abundance. The time is set for 8
o'clock. Preceding the smoker the
Executive Committee will have Dr.
Wilbur as their guest at a dinner
given in the restaurant of the Union.
