# Second Varsity Shell Repaired—Squad at Redwood Increased
## 
### 
Repairs on the second varsity shell,
which was damaged while being taken
out of the water last Sunday morning,
were completed today. With this boat
again in use, the crew squad taken to
Redwood each day will now number
twenty-eight oarsmen, as three eight
oar shells and one four-oar boat are
available. This squad will be en
larged even more as soon as the shell
now being built is received at Red
wood.
No changes in the varsity squad
have been made for several days. The
men now sitting in this shell are
Maurer, at stroke; Green. 7; Orme. 6;
Rogers, Jacomini, 4; Worth, 3;
Steinbeck, 2; and Neuner, bow. Six of
these eight men rowed in the Card
inal shell in the race on the Hudson
last summer. Steinbeck, who stroked
the freshman crew last spring, and
Neuner. are the only new men on the
team, as it now stands. According
to the coach and captain, however, it
is yet much too early to get any def
inite line on the final personnel of the
varsity eight. The freshmen and sec
ond varsity eights have been changed
about much more frequently than the
first crew. Those who rowed in these
boats today were as follows:
Freshman — Goodman, coxswain;
King, stroke: Watts, LaForge, Howl
ing. Boydston, Williamson, Waite, and
Wright, bow.
