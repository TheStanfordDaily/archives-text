cator, so the nine innings will be run
off in snappy style.
Practically the same lineup as was
used against the locals last Saturday
will be pitted against them tomorrow
by Tommy Sheehan, who is the field
captain of the Independents. It is
not certain whether Mails, the Brook
lyn National Leaguer, or Crespi, the
Oakland Coaster, who beat the varsity
Saturday, will do the twirling act.
Ramage will play behind the bat,
Chase will again scoop them up

George Kelly, New York National

for the Phillies, will cavort in the
outer gardens.
Stanford will start tlie game with
big Gus Hoever in the box, "Cap '
Dent will hold down his usual job be
hind the log, Hayes will handle first,
Stafford will tag them at second, that
is if any get on the paths; while
Dickey and Stevens will compose the
remainder of the infield. Sanborn,
Lander, Braden, and Noonan will be
the Cardinal fly chasers.
With good support, Hoever has an
excellent chance of turning the tables
on the visiting aggregation. The
Cardinal varsity are meeting the ball
regularly now and should pile up a
few tallies. While the Independents
have some world beaters in their line
up, they are not unbeatable, for the
University of Santa Clara tossers
slipped a 4 to 3 win over on them
last Sunday. The results of the Stan
ford series will help the "dopesters"
to estimate the local prospects.
