# COACHES ARE ASSURED FOR BASEBALL AND TRACK TEAMS
## WILL BE APPOINTED AT ONCE Athletic Board Sanctions Action at First Meeting Held Last Evening 
### 
Stanford's track and baseball teams
will not so uncoached this semester.
Assurance of this was given by the
Athletic Advisory Board at its first
meeting, held last evening, when it
authorized the hiring of men to train
the squads in these branches of sport.
It now remains only for the Executive
Committee to ratify the choice of
coaches.
Action Temporary.
The action taken last night is but
temporary, but an effort will probably
be made to install some other system
for the future. Right at the present
time, however, it was felt that the ex
igency of the situation demanded im
mediate action, and for this reason the
coaches will be hired at once.
Definite Policy Postponed.
A definite athletic policy was not
discussed, action in regard to this
being postponed on account of the
feeling that determination of the more
pressing problem of coaches should
first be accomplished. The board will
meet weekly, however, and a policy
will no doubt be adopted at an early
date.
Officers of Hoard.
Professor A. T. Murray, head of the
Faculty Athletic committee, was
elected president of the board, and
