# HETTINGER BACK FROM TRIP WITH FORD PEACE PARTY
## ENTERTAINED BY STUDENTS Tells of Cool Reception Given Expedition by People of Norway 
### 
A. J. Hettinger, '16, Stanford's rep
resentative on the Ford Peace Party,
returned to the campus last evening
after his two months' absence. Het
tinger is busy today greeting friends
and answers everyone with the same
reply: "I had a fine time, but it's
mighty good to be back."
Work of Party.
Hettinger left the campus Novem
ber 30, on a few hours' notice. He
reached New York too late to make
the trip with the big party on the
Oscar 11, but sailed a few days later
on the Frederick VIIT. The first stop
was made at Kirkwall, England, for
inspection of cargo and passports.
From there they went to Christiania,
where they joined the rest of the
party. The route from there was by
rail to Stockholm, thence to Copen
hagen and The Hague via Hamburg
and Amsterdam. Three or four days
were spent in each of these places.
Whiit Was Accomplished.
When asked as to what was accom
plished, Hettinger said that the party
to date had been more in the nature of
an advertisement of the commission
| still at work. Meetings were held at
the various places where stops were
made and speeches were given by
prominent members of the party and
peace advocates of the neutral coun
tries. What will be accomplished by
the commission is yet a matter of
conjecture, but so far as the rest of
the party is concerned, it is through.
The party received a very cold recep
tion in Norway, according to Het
tinger, but were given a warm wel
| come in Sweden, while in Denmark
and Holland the reception was fair.
The return voyage was started one
month ago tomorrow, on the Holland-
American liner, Xoordam. More time
was required for the return voyage
than was expected, on account of the
fact that the ship's supply of coal
gave out and a layoff was necessary

A. J. Hettinger, '16, Stanford's rep
resentative on the Ford Peace Party,
returned to the campus last evening
after his two months' absence. Het

and answers everyone with the same
reply: "I had a fine time, but it's
mighty good to be back."
Work of Party.
Hettinger left the campus Novem
ber 30, on a few hours' notice. He
reached New York too late to make
the trip with the big party on the
Oscar 11, but sailed a few days later
on the Frederick VIIT. The first stop
was made at Kirkwall, England, for
inspection of cargo and passports.
From there they went to Christiania,
where they joined the rest of the
party. The route from there was by
rail to Stockholm, thence to Copen
hagen and The Hague via Hamburg
and Amsterdam. Three or four days
were spent in each of these places.
Whiit Was Accomplished.
When asked as to what was accom
plished, Hettinger said that the party
to date had been more in the nature of
an advertisement of the commission
| still at work. Meetings were held at
the various places where stops were
made and speeches were given by
prominent members of the party and
peace advocates of the neutral coun
tries. What will be accomplished by
the commission is yet a matter of
conjecture, but so far as the rest of
the party is concerned, it is through.
The party received a very cold recep
tion in Norway, according to Het
tinger, but were given a warm wel

and Holland the reception was fair.
