### 
Active interest in student activities
receives justification rather than the
usual unsupported eulogy in the inter
view with President Wilbur, pub
lished in another column.
One of the ten men whom Dr. Wil
bur characterizes as "among the
most prominent alumni" was at Stan
ford only one year. Another was as
sistant in the University library and
doubtlessly received training there
valuable to him as a publisher today.
Of the remaining eight men, seven
were active in undergraduate affairs
—most of them to the degree that they
could be called "prominent."
After all, we are looking at student
activities from the wrong viewpoint
when we attempt to justify them.
They are not on the defensive. The
fun that goes with participation in the
things going on about you is suf
ficient reason for taking the biggest
interest in them that you can. The
weight of the evidence in the cases of
these seven prominent men who were
active is to the effect that it won't do
any harm.
The indirect advantages of partici
pation are bigger than the direct ones.
There are direct benefits derived, but
friends are made as well, and oppor
tunity is given to meet them under
the best conditions. The valuable as
sociations made possible are the real
justification of college activities.
