# Sophomore Jolly Up Committee Formulating Plans for Get-Together
## 
### 
Sophomore Jolly-Up plans are rap
idly being formulated by the commit
tee in charge. Chairman H. P.
Hauser, '18, has announced February
21 as the date of the affair. The place
has not been definitely decided upon,
hut it will probably be held at the
Women's Club House.
The class recently voted to invite
all freshmen women and transfers,
so an excellent attendance is looked
for.
Something new in the way of
refreshments will lie offered, and
the traditional apples, cider, and
doughnuts will not be served. All in
all, Chairman Hauser promises some
thing decidedly novel in the way of a
jolly-up.
