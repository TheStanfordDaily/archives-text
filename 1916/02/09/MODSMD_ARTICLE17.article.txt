Although swimming is not consid
ered to be of great importance at the
University of California and only
small letters are granted to those who
make the team, there is a movement
on foot among the students to grant
"Ludy" Langer, the world champion
distance swimmer, who is now com
peting for California in Honolulu, a
big "C" upon his return. It is felt by
many of the students that by his won
derful work in the water sport he
deserves this honor.
Npooner, Writes of
Indian Excavations.
Among the new books which have
been placed in the University library,
there is one by Dr. Brainerd Spooner,
'99, of Bankipore, India, who is now
a British official. It contains the re
sults of his excavations at Pataliputra,
the ancient capital of India, and his
discovery of the existence of a com
munity of Zoroastrians who brought
Persian culture into Buddhist history.
According to Dr. Jordan, "it would ap
pear that Buddha was originally a
member of this group, which fact ex
plains many things in the early his
tory of Hindu religion."
Murray Enters Indoor
Tennis lii Enstern Meet.
R. Lindley Murray, '14, former Card
inal tennis star, and ranked as the
fourth best player in the United
States in 1914, has entered the Na
tional Indoor Tennis Championship
tournament to be played in New York
beginning February 12. Murray is a
member of the West Side Tennis Club.
He will have as his strongest competi
tors such players as Karl Belir and
T. R. Pell, as well as a number of
other eastern stars.

University of California students are
offended; they refuse to walk in the
form of an "S" in order to get to their
cherished "C," yet this is the form in
which student engineers have sur
veyed the new path up Charter Hill.
Students at the Berkeley institution
are now demanding that the path be
zigzagged and thereby obliterate all
reference to Stanford.

No longer will the engineering cor

every heavy rain when the flood
washes down Lasuen street. An ad
ditional eighteen inch drainage pipe
line is being laid and will conduct
the water away without making it
again necessary to haul in sacks of
sand for that purpose.

Hough's Corner
Drained By New Pipe.
No longer will the engineering cor
ner of the Quad be submerged after
every heavy rain when the flood
washes down Lasuen street. An ad
ditional eighteen inch drainage pipe

sand for that purpose.
"Ludv" Lunger May
Ititr
Although swimming is not consid
ered to be of great importance at the
University of California and only
small letters are granted to those who
make the team, there is a movement
on foot among the students to grant
"Ludy" Langer, the world champion
distance swimmer, who is now com
peting for California in Honolulu, a
big "C" upon his return. It is felt by
many of the students that by his won
derful work in the water sport he
deserves this honor.
Npooner, Writes of
Indian Excavations.
Among the new books which have
been placed in the University library,
there is one by Dr. Brainerd Spooner,
'99, of Bankipore, India, who is now
a British official. It contains the re
sults of his excavations at Pataliputra,
the ancient capital of India, and his
discovery of the existence of a com
munity of Zoroastrians who brought
Persian culture into Buddhist history.
According to Dr. Jordan, "it would ap
pear that Buddha was originally a
member of this group, which fact ex
plains many things in the early his
tory of Hindu religion."

I'ntli to Big
*'C" Changed.
University of California students are
offended; they refuse to walk in the
form of an "S" in order to get to their
cherished "C," yet this is the form in
which student engineers have sur
veyed the new path up Charter Hill.
Students at the Berkeley institution
are now demanding that the path be
zigzagged and thereby obliterate all
reference to Stanford.
