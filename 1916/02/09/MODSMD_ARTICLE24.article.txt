# SMITHS REGAIN LEAD IN NEW "BAWL-OUT"
## Zvenigorodsky, '16, No Longer Ends Listâ€”Lots of Local Color in Directory 
### 
Once more the Smiths have asserted
their rightful pre-eminence in the
"Bawl Out," regaining by a close mar
gin of one the lead which the John
sons have monopolized in the past.
There are now sixteen bearing the
universal name, Johnsons batting sec
ond with fifteen and Clarks third with
one less. The names run down
through the alphabet for sixty pages
from Abbott to Zwingman, who has
had the honor of beating out Abra
ham Zvenigorodsk.v, '16. the conclud
ing name for the past three years.
Investigation proves the usual
number of coincidences regarding the
names, with ten Woods, two Sawyer.3,
ten Millers and two Mills, one Single
and one Doble. There incidentally oc
cur two Knights and two Days. The
color scheme is well carried out, with,
the somber hues of Brown leading,
backed up with Greens, Grays, Blacks
and Whites.
The total registration for this se
mester is 1965, which is a decrease of
89 from that of last September, due
largely to the fatal fall of the fac
ulty axe.
It is interesting to note, however,
that the total registration of this year
exceeds that of 1914-15 by 145. These
students represent 39 states of the
Union, and 15 foreign countries, as
well as Hawaii, the Phillipine Islands
and Alaska. Outside of California,
which boasts 1609, the largest num
ber comes from Oregon, after which
follows Washington, Utah and Ari
zona.
