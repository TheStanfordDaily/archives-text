# "Great Divide" Cast Net Definitely Picked
## Several Roles Still In Tryout Stage. Will Be Announced In a Few Days 
### 
Due to the fact that some of the
characters for"The Great Divide"
have not been definitely chosen, it
will lie impossible for the English
Clu 1) to announce the cast for that
production for about a week. Al
though most of the places have been
satisfactorily filled, there remain
three or four roles which are still in
the tryout stage, and which may be
changed later.
In the effort to produce "The Great
Divide" in a strictly first class fashion,
a new system has been adopted in
picking people for the various parts.
In order that each player be abso
lutely fitted for his role, the char
acters about which there is any doubt
will try out in rehearsals for the
next few days. If they are found to
be lacking in any respect, new people
will be secured. As soon as a perfect
cast has been picked it will be an
nounced.
