# STUDENT LEADERS ACHIEVE FAME
## Chancellor and President Name Prominent Alumni 
### 
Proof of the soundness of the state
ment often made by Chancellor Jor
dan and President Wilbur that stu
dent activities are valuable to the par
ticipants is contained in an investi
gation of the undergraduate life of
men who have been characterized by
them as being "among the prominent
and successful men who have gradu
ated from Stanford."
An inquiry into the undergraduate
life of the men named by the Chan
cellor and President has brought out.
the fact that student activities are
worth while and that to a consider
able extent a man's potential power
and influence in the world may be
gauged by the interest he takes in
college activities.
With but few exceptions, those
members of the alumni who were
named by either the President or the
Chancellor as having achieved the
most noteworthy successes in their
various lines of endeavor were prom
inent during their undergraduate

days along either literary, athletic, or
debating lines.
Active In College Affairs.
Seven of the ten men selected by
President Wilbur as being "ten prom
inent Stanford alumni who have suc
ceeded in various lines of work," were
active in college affairs during their
student days on "The Farm." Two
of the seven were editors of The Daily
Palo Alto, two were members of the
varsity football team, one was an in
tercollegiate debater, one was a track
athlete and Senior class president, an
other was student treasurer, and the
first graduate manager of the Asso
ciated Students. Of the remaining
two, one studied at Stanford for only
his final college year, another was as
sistant in the library, while the tenth
man took no part in student activities.
Of the ten men named by the Presi
dent, three are lawyers, two are edu
cators, while journalism, publishing,
medicine, mining, and geology each
claim the attention of one of the
others. The lawyers named in this
list of ten successful Stanford alumni
are Jackson E. Reynolds, '96, general
attorney for the Central Railroad
Company of New Jersey, with head
quarters in New York City; Royall C.
Victor. '00, attorney at law. New York

David Sneddon, '97, commissioner
of public schools for the state of Mas
sachusetts, and Henry Suzzalo, '99,

educational work who are mentioned
in the list of ten.

That there is a certain close con
nection between activity while attend
ing school and activity in the world',-5
