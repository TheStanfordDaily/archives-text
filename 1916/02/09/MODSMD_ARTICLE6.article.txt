# Holders of Lucky Numbers Will Win Crew Dance Prizes
## 
### 
In addition to novelties such as an
ice cream parlor, and the accompani
ment of two orchestras and a band,
the crew dance in the gymnasium to
morrow evening will be featured by
the giving of prizes to the holders of
lucky numbers. All who attend the
affair will be given numbered cards,
and at several times during the eve
ning, drawings will be held. Boxes of
candy are to be the gifts.
As there will be but little money
spent in connection with holding the
"On to Poughkeepsie" dance, the
amount of money which will be raised
for the crew promises to be large, as
the affair will be well attended. The
refreshment room, which will be con
ducted by the crew dance committee,
promises also to be a successful ven
ture.
