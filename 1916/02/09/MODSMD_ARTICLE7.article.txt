# DR. BRANNER RETURNS FROM JOURNEY TO PANAMA
## MRS. BRANNER STILL IN EAST Was One of Government Body to Investigate Slides on Canal Zone 
### 
Dr. John Caspar Branner, presi
dent emeritus of the University, re
turned Saturday from his trip to the
Panama Canal zone, where, as one of
the members of a special committee,
he went at the request of President
Wilson to investigate the geological
cause of the large land slides, which
during the last few months have
caused much trouble and expense to
the government and necessitated the
closing of the canal at one time.
Leaving here last December, Dr.
Branner was absent almost two
months; going by way of New Orleans
he met the other members of the
committee at Panama and after a
thorough investigation was made a
report was sent to the authorities a t
Washington. Mrs. Branner accon -
panied Dr. Branner, and returned
with him to New York, where she will
remain for a month before proceeding
to Stanford.
Saying that he was not at liberty to
speak regarding the condition of the
canal until after the report had been
published by the government, Dr.
Branner issued no statement concern
ing the results of the committee's in
vestigation.
Dr. Branner has no immediate plans
for the future and will in all prob
ability remain at Stanford during the
next few months.
