# Transmission Towers Are Being Installed
## 
### 
Two standard steel towers, such as
are used by modern power companies
for their high tension lines, are being
erected back of the Electrical en
gineering laboratory. They are a gift
to the University from the Great
Western Power company, and repre
sent, in cost of material and erection,
about $500.
The towers are presented in recog
nition of the valuable serivces of Pro
fessor H. J. Ryan of the Electrical
Engineering department, in his pio
neer work of ascertaining the losses
of electricity transmission through
conductors of different diameters.
He now has facilities in the labora
tory for proceeding to investigate fur
ther than has yet been attempted; it
is in this new work that the power
companies are watching developments
at Stanford for data which will be of
immense practical value to them, if it
is found that higher voltage can be
conducted through larger diameters
than have heretofore been thought
practicable to use. Professor Ryan
says he expects to get results which
may revolutionize power transmission,
and outside concerns, realizing this,
are interesting themselves in local ex
periments.
