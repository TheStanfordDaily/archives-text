Stanford fans will see an Oriental-
American mixture of the great na
tional sport some time in May, If
Graduate Manager Behrens succeeds
in his negotiations with the manage
ment of the Waseda University nine,
which is to tour the United States this
spring. The Japanese baseball ar
tists will arrive in San Francisco on
May 4, coming upon the invitation of
Chicago University, and besides play
ing that school, are scheduling games
with other American colleges, of
which Stanford is very likely to be
one. The Waseda boys will play a
feature series in Chicago, similar to
the one played in 1911, when they at
tracted nation-wide attention. Uni
versity of Chicago played this team
in Japan last season, and the yellow
