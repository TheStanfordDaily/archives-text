# Swimming Meet February 19 For All Four Classes
## 
### 
Swimming will claim her part of
the spring sport limelight when on
February 1!) the interclass meet will
occupy the attention of the various
aquatic artists at Stanford. Practice
iu all the events lias been going on
steadily since the beginning of the se
mester. Under the direction of Ernest
Brandsten a capable and strong ma
chine has been built up. Contrary to
the condition of past years, the
strength of the various classes at the
present time is about equal, with pos
sibly the freshmen having the shade
lof the argument. There is a strong
| chance that local records will be shat
tered by the fresh-water athletes in
the coming meet.
Breaking a precedent that has been
established at Stanford for many
past years, the swimming sport has
i forced its way into the ranks of the
important spring drawing cards. This
is probably due to the fact that during
the entire year the plunge has been
running at its utmost capacity. Swim
ming this season bids fair to equal in
captured laurels the work of any of
the Cardinal spring sports.
Many meets are on tap for this com
ing month, principal among these
being the ones with the University of
I California and the University of
Washington. The northern aggrega
tion lias been laying up a few coast
records during the season and the
Washington contest bids fair to being
a big attraction. The Olympic Club
of San Francisco will also be a prob
able competitor.
The freshmen team will lead the
I list with contests with the schools
I about the bay region. Lowell High
'is booked as the strongest rival of
j the first year men. Dates for these
| meets will be announced within the
| course of a few days.
