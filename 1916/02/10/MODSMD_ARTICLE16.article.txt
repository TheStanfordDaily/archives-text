This is inside stuff. It used to be
that when the time for editorial copy
came and no other subject was press
ing, the ethical thing to do was to
take a fling at the powers that be for
the appearance of the campus. Tomes
could be filled with articles that have
been written on what a paradise
Stanford might be.
It's all wrong. The Board of Trus
tees and the business manager are
doing their best to improve the look
of things. Present day editors have
to pull their hair and think of other
subjects to write about. But the cam
pus isn't a paradise for beauty, yet.
The fault lies with the people that live
there and not with the powers that be.
True it is that this is a rather bad
time of year to expect the greenest
grass to line the roads and the
brightest flowers to blossom in the
gardens. But a little attention now
will mean that some of the vacant
spots conspicuous for the absence of
these things last spring and fall, will
add to the beauty of the campus dur
ing the coming season.
And there's another thing that
would help out now. Some people
forget that the campus at large is not
intended for a big waste paper basket,
and scatter waste paper to the four
winds. If you are one of these and
will put the discarded notes in your
pocket until you come to one of the
regular receptacles provided, you'll
help a lot in the beautification plan.
The Stanford "rough" lias been ad
vised to spruce up. That's really ask
ing too much, but it's not natch trouble
to do a little bit toward cleaning up
the campus.
