Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
Your editorial on Tuesday last
struck the nail on the head —there ; s
something wrong with dramatics at
Stanford. Our drama on the wiiole is
sick. It is up to those who care, to
provide a tonic. Unless the public
is no longer overloaded with Assem
bly Hall productions, and unless these
productions are worth the money
asked for admission, dramatics here
will die a very unnatural death.
When the supply is far in excess of
the demand, the situation is critical.
The idea, of course, is to create the
demand.
With the kind of show that is being
offered on the Stanford stage, and
the prices that prevail, it is very un
likely that the demand will ever be
increased. Masquers' show of last
Friday is an example of the result
of over-production, but NOT an ex
ample of the most unattractive kind
of performance that could be given.
There have been many dramas given
here that far excelled Masquers' for
unworthiness. There are two ways to
create that demand—better shows,
and lower prices. Why not both? It
is but an hour's journey to San Fran
cisco, where professional drama can
be seen for the same expenditure, or
less.
Although we can depend on the
usual run of "queeners," and those
people who come out of loyalty, and
interest in the players, the scale of
prices keeps unwarmed a shameful
percentage of the seats in the house.
There have been performances called
off on account of "no seat-sale;" there
have been instances of the bounteous
and charitable distribution of "paper"
in order to have at least the sem
blance of an audience. All of which,
to stoop to the vernacular, is "pretty
poor stuff."
Why not cut prices to within rea
son, and reduce expenses? Those
who would accomplish this, would
have to get around a deal of political
and monopolistic control of such
trifling matters as stage "rights,"
the ticket "dispensarios," etc. Noth
ing like trying, lletter shows and
lower prices—why not both?
—Neutral.
