Of the ten men named by President
Wilbur as being among "prominent
and successful men who have grad
uated from Stanford," Will Irwin was
no doubt the most active as a student.
During his freshman year he made his
class numerals as a member of the '90
football team. On The Daily Palo Alto
he held the successive positions of
reporter, associate editor and editor
in-chief. His writings, however, were
not confined to newspaper work, as he
was a frequent contributor to Sequoia,
and served for a time as associate
editor of that magazine. He was also
associate editor of the '99 Quad,
which was edited by Chris Bradley,
now a San Francisco attorney, who
spoke at last fall's rugby rally. An
interesting incident in this connection
is the fact that Will Irwin's brother,
Wallace, edited the '00 Quad.
Irwin Active.
A complete account of Irwin's ac
tivities would require more space
than can be given here. Suffice it to
say that he was the author of tlio
'9(i senior farce, and of the '98 junior
farce, was president of Press Club,
president of Sword and Sandals, mem
ber of the Executive Committee, jun
ior class treasurer, member of Inter
collegiate Debating committee, and
winner of several story and poem
prizes.
Another unusually prominent man
in Irwin's class, was Henry Suzzalo,
now president of the University of
Washington. Suzzalo, who majored
in education, took part in several in
tercollegiate debates, in which he
was exceedingly successful, and was
the champion debater in Stanford
winning this title in an inter-society
debate. He also made the Carnol
team in 1897, and later chairman ol
the Intercollegiate Debating commit
tee, and .served as vice-president ol
his class during his junior year.
Arnold a Track Man.
The third man of the class of '9£
mentioned by Dr. Wilbur, is Ralp?i
Arnold. Arnold made the track squad
during his sophomore year, and was a
member of the intercollegiate chest
team. He was a member of the Ex
ecutive committee, the Mandolin Club
Euphronia Debating Society, and was
senior president of the '99 class ap
well as serving as president of the
Student Guild Association.
Another of the ten men who won
his block "S" in football was Jackson
Reynolds, now a N'ew York attorney
While a sophomore he was a metnbei
of the class football team and played
oh the varsity eleven during his jun
ior and senior years. In addition, he
was an associate editor of The Daily
Palo Alto, and was secretary of the
Intercollegiate Athletic committee.
A. B. Spalding, now of the Stan
ford Medical faculty, served on the
the same team with Reynolds, playing
for two years also. He was a mem
ber of the Executive committee during
his sophomore year, and while a sen
ior, served on the Intercollegiate Ath
letic committee.
Royall C. Victor, who is now en
gaged in journalism in New York, was
the other editor of The Daily Palo
Alto mentioned in the list of ten suc
cessful men. He served successively
as reporter, associate editor and edi
tor, was a member of Euphronia and
of Phi Delta Phi, law fraternity. He
served on the Executive committee,
was manager of the tennis team, and
was successively treasurer and presi
dent of the Students' Guild.
Herbert C. Hoover, who is now re
garded by many as the "biggest" man
among Stanford's alumni, was unus
ually active in geological work, work
ed as an assistant in a geological sur
vey of Arkansas during his junior
year, and as assistant in the United
States Geological survey while a sen
ior. in addition, he was president of
the Stanford Geological Club, member
of the class council, athletic board,
and was treasurer of his class. The
most far-reaching of Hoover's student
activities, was the organization of the
business side of the University's ath
letic activities. Previous to Hoover's
taking over the position correspond
ing to the present graduate manager'.*
job, the student finances were inef
ficiently handled. Hoover applied to
tliis office the same executive abilitv
which has made him so prominent in
the relief of llelgltim, and put student
finances on a sound basis, for the first
time.

Of the ten men named by President
Wilbur as being among "prominent
and successful men who have grad
uated from Stanford," Will Irwin was
no doubt the most active as a student.
During his freshman year he made his
class numerals as a member of the '90
football team. On The Daily Palo Alto
he held the successive positions of
reporter, associate editor and editor
in-chief. His writings, however, were
not confined to newspaper work, as he
was a frequent contributor to Sequoia,
and served for a time as associate
editor of that magazine. He was also
associate editor of the '99 Quad,
which was edited by Chris Bradley,
now a San Francisco attorney, who
spoke at last fall's rugby rally. An
interesting incident in this connection
is the fact that Will Irwin's brother,
Wallace, edited the '00 Quad.
Irwin Active.
A complete account of Irwin's ac
tivities would require more space
than can be given here. Suffice it to
say that he was the author of tlio
'9(i senior farce, and of the '98 junior
farce, was president of Press Club,
president of Sword and Sandals, mem
ber of the Executive Committee, jun
ior class treasurer, member of Inter
collegiate Debating committee, and
winner of several story and poem
prizes.
Another unusually prominent man
in Irwin's class, was Henry Suzzalo,
now president of the University of
Washington. Suzzalo, who majored
in education, took part in several in
tercollegiate debates, in which he
was exceedingly successful, and was
the champion debater in Stanford
winning this title in an inter-society
debate. He also made the Carnol
team in 1897, and later chairman ol
the Intercollegiate Debating commit
tee, and .served as vice-president ol
his class during his junior year.
Arnold a Track Man.
The third man of the class of '9£
mentioned by Dr. Wilbur, is Ralp?i
Arnold. Arnold made the track squad
during his sophomore year, and was a
member of the intercollegiate chest
team. He was a member of the Ex
ecutive committee, the Mandolin Club
Euphronia Debating Society, and was
senior president of the '99 class ap
well as serving as president of the
Student Guild Association.
Another of the ten men who won
his block "S" in football was Jackson
Reynolds, now a N'ew York attorney
While a sophomore he was a metnbei
of the class football team and played
oh the varsity eleven during his jun
ior and senior years. In addition, he
was an associate editor of The Daily
Palo Alto, and was secretary of the
Intercollegiate Athletic committee.
A. B. Spalding, now of the Stan
ford Medical faculty, served on the
the same team with Reynolds, playing
for two years also. He was a mem
ber of the Executive committee during
his sophomore year, and while a sen
ior, served on the Intercollegiate Ath

Royall C. Victor, who is now en
gaged in journalism in New York, was
the other editor of The Daily Palo

as reporter, associate editor and edi
