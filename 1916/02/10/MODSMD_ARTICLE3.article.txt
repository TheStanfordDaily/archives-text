# Mystery of Nightly Revel
## Bared-Dance Holds Sway 
### 
A nocturnal mystery, which has dis
turbed the usual calm that settles
over the gym when the last classes
are over in the afternoon, has been
unearthed! Prowlers in the neighbor
hood of the stately abode of athletes
have found the cause for the Tuesday
night tapping, which, to the strains of
soulful music, resounds from the gym
Iloor and is dully re-echoed from the
high beams
It has been discovered that a
few minutes after the bells in
the tower strike eight, that the gym
floor is flooded with light, the music
of a phonograph strikes up a one
step, and to the chant of "one, two,
three, four," from the lips of E. R.
Knollin, gr., our whilom trainer and at
present, Physical Training Instructor
Maloney, trips eight paces up the floor
on his toes, gently leading, in the
steps of the compelling one-step, no
other than Swimming Instructor
Ernie Brandsten.
Accompanying them are some half
a dozen other stalwarts bent on
imbibing knowledge of the in
tricacies of terpsichorean amuse
ment. It is rumored among the wise
that Ernie is desirous of being in the
swim in a social as well as in an
aquatic sense, but what has possessed
the staid Maloney to indulge in such
frivolities? Maybe its—but then he' 3
married!
