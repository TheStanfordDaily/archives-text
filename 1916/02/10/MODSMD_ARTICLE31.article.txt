# Double Plays

Coach Harry Wolter seems to have
putin some Rood licks already. The
varsity played with more life than
they have for some time. Although
Wolter did not have time to show the
lioys many pointers, his presence on
the bench gave them confidence.

The game was fast in every partic
ular. The seven innings were run
off in one hour and thirty minutes.
A number of classy plays were pulled
off at crucial moments, giving the
"bugs" something to remember.

Without doubt, the feature catch of
the day was made in the last inning
by Sanborn, when he pulled Chase's
long fly from the air and saved a sure
run. It was excellent work and the
fans showed their appreciation by
hearty applause.

Hal Chase expressed the opinion
that the Cardinal varsity looked to
be a much stronger hitting team this
season than in the last few years. He
said that he believed that Harry Wol
ter would be able to whip the team in
shape to defeat California, and pos
sibly Santa Clara also. Cliase said
however, that the Mission Town is
represented by a strong contingent of
ball players.

It. is doubtful if the campus fans
realize the high class umpiring that
they are being treated to in these
early season games. There are few
better indicator men in the country
than Jack McCarthy, who has called
the balls and strikes at the last three
contests.
