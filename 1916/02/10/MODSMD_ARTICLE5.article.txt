## 
### 
An account of the great Nevada
earthquake of October, 1915, which is
shown by data gathered at the center
to have been stronger than the quake
of 1906, and as a result of which the
Sonoma Range, which borders Pleas
ant Valley, Nevada, has been raised
from ten to fifteen feet, was con
tained in the last quarterly Bulletin
of the Seismological Society of Amer
ica, published at Stanford. The shock
was caused by a movement along n
2. r i-niile fault in Pleasant Valley, and
appears on the surface as a vertical
scarp from five to fifteen feet high.
The shock did comparatively little
damage because of the sparse settle
ment in the vicinity.
The next edition of the quarterly
will be out early in March, according
to Professor S. D. Townley of the Ap
plied Mathematics department. Pro
fessor Townley, as well as President
Emeritus John Casper Branner, are
members of the publication committee
of the society. Some of the articles
in the coming issue are to be by Stan
ford men.
