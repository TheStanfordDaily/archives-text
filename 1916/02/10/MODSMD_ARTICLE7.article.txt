# STANFORD-SANTA CLARA BASKETBALL SLATED FOR WEEK-END
## S.C. HAS EDGE ON CARDINALS Quintets Will Clash in Encina Gymnasium at Eight O'clock Saturday 
### 
To repeat Stanford's football victory
of last fall over Santa Clara is a task
assigned to the varsity basketball
team for Saturday night. A compari
son of the strength of the two teams
is difficult, but a fast, closely contested
game is assured. In point of prac
tice the Missionites appear to have
the edge, as they started their season
before the holidays. During the
Christmas week they journeyed to Los
Angeles, where they played the lead
ing college and club teams. How
ever, if the advance which the Card
inals have made since their encounter
with Washington is continued, they
should prove a match for the Santa
Clara team.
As a preliminary to the Stanford-
Santa Clara game the freshmen will
meet Oakland Tech. The first year
lineup has not been announced.
Varsity vs. Oregon Aggies.
What will probably be the hardest
game of the basketball season will be
staged next Wednesday evening with
the Oregon Agricultural College quin
tet. O. A. C l . and California are at
present tied for first place in the
Pacific Coast Conference race. This
title will be decided on the southern
invasion of the former five, which re
cently defeated the Washington var
sity.
