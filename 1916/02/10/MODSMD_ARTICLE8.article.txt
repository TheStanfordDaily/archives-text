# All Kinds of Joy at the Crew Dance
## Candy Dances, Sticky Specials, Good Music and Slippery Floor On Hand 
### 
In order to be interviewed, "Rill"
Rloeser, manager of the crew dance,
mopped his heated brow and paused
long enough in his efforts to make
things pleasanter than ever for the
"scud" tomorrow night in the gym
nasium.
"Yep," he said, airily, "everything's
ready for sixteen dances and two ex
tras, except the floor. We'll fix that
tomorrow afternoon by application of
a healthy dose of Hloeser's Oatmeal
treatment for dance floors. Secret o'
mine, you know. Nobody ever thought
of it before. Makes the floor smooth
as glass. Slip? No; just half as
smooth as glass. That's just right
"You want to be on hand for the
candy dances. Two of 'em. Won't
tell you which ones. We want to fool
'em. Everybody gets a number at the
door, and then we'll draw for the
lucky couple. Great indoor sport, you
know. You ought to see the pro
grams! Wideman and Congdon and
Crone donated them. Sticky Wilson
put tip the candy for prizes.
"Music? Say, we've got 'em all
going. Two orchestras and a band.
They'll take turns playing, doing to
begin on time, too. That'll give time
to visit the ice cream parlors. Oh,
they're another new stunt. Everyone
will fall for them. We'll serve ice
cream to anyone who comes—for a
sum—small sum, that is. Any more
tickets? Well, just a few. That's old
stuff, I know, but it's bona tide this
time. Going to have more than a hun
dred and fifty there tomorrow night.
So long. See you there."
