# UNION SMOKER FOR WILBUR
## Men of University Will Gather to Meet New President 
### 
Tonight at 8 o'clock is the time set
for the smoker to be given at the
Union by the Board of Governors in
honor of Dr. Wilbur. As has been
previously announced there will be
absolutely no formality connected
with the evening. A fixed program
with set speeches is tabooed, for it is
President Wilbur's desire to meet and
know the men of Stanford in a truly
informal way, and this can best be
accomplished by becoming acquainted
on the equal footing of alumnus and
students.
The reception tonight is intended
primarily for the men students. At
a future date arrangements will no
doubt be made to give the five hundred
women the same opportunity of meet
ing Dr. Wilbur. Smokes will be pro
vided in abundance and a "typical
Stanford time" will be enjoyed, as was
said of the similar planned evening
at which the Union was dedicated.
