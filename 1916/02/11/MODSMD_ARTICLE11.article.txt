Olympics Strong Nine.
The Olympic Club will send a strong
aggregation to the campus to meet the
local varsity. A number of the best
ball tossers in San Francisco wear the
uniform of the Winged "0," so the
varsity can be assured of excellent
competition. The strength of the Man
zanita High school contingent that
hooks up with the freshmen is un
known as they have not met any
teams of great importance so far this
season. It is hoped, however, that
they will give the first year team a
hard game.

Coach Harry Wolter will use the fol
lowing lineup for the afternoon game:
I Either Howe, Wickersham, Hoevcr, or
I Mattel in the box, Dent behind the log,
