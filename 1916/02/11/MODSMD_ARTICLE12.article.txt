# "Hope Soon to Know All Stanford Men"
## President Wilbur Smoker Offers New President First Opportunity to Meet Students 
### 
"This is just the kind of a time I
enjoy," remarked President Wilbur,
last night, at the close of the smoker
given in his honor at the Union, "ft
has given me great pleasure to meet
all these men and I hope in time to
become better acquainted and to know
every one of them by name." Such
was Dr. Wilbur's statement last night
as he left the Union, after having
shaken hands with several Hundred
men who attended the reception.
The word reception, however, would
hardly apply, for the entire evening
was marked by strict informality. No
program was arranged, and no
speeches were made; the men just
dropped in, group by group, and met
the President in a typical Stanford
way, after which he discussed with
them, as if he were an old acquaint
ance, various topics of present, past
and future interest.
Dr. Wilbur is an extremely easy
man to meet and has the ability of
making all around him feel entirely
at their ease. "I'll have to remember
yon fellows," he remarked, "for in i
few years you'll be sending along
• our sons, asking me to keep an eye
on then, and I'll have to remember
what th" old man looked like." Keep
ing his listeners continually amused
'• ith reminiscences ot the early days
of the University, he told of the re
markable old Uncle John, the stage
driver, whose exaggerations and stor
ies caused many visitors to the Uni
versity to go away with illuminated
ideas of the wonders of Stanford.
In addition to the large group which
was continually crowded about Dr.
Wilbur, many were interested in heat
ing of the European situation from
A. .J. Hettinger, member of the Ford
Peace expedition, who was beset with
questions whenever he stopped his
narration. A number of the faculty
were also present, among whom were
Professors Marx, Peirce, Woodward,
Green, and Mitchell. Preceding the
smoker, the President was the guest
of the Executive Committee at a ban
quet in the Union restaurant.
