# Campaigning
## 
### 
Why putin useful time doing un
necessary work, is the question that
naturally conies into our minds when
we hear that The Union is waging a
campaign for members. But the an
swer is that it has proved necessary
to wage such a campaign in order to
secure a membership of sufficient size
et current expenses.
Union now has approximately
lembers. Dues from 500 mem
bers at the very least are necessary
to pay the regular hills. Still another
hundred are needed to maintain the
building at the right standard.
The last idea that should be in the
minds of the members of the Govern
ing Board is to hound students into
joining the Union or to attempt to
gain members by using the "ought to
join" argument. But the campaign is
not being carried on in this equally
undignified and unfruitful manner.
To be sure if you think The Union
is worth while you ought to join now.
But if you believe that The Union is
an unnecessary foible, the result of
pipe dreams of the men behind the
project, you won't be urged to spend
your money on charitable institution.
But if you do believe in The Unio'i
idea there are a few things you ought
to think about. In the first place, a
determination to join next semester
is not helping the board to meet its
bills this year. If your idea is only
to delay until next month, you're go
ing to miss a lot in the meantime.
Also, there is danger that you might
be able to convince yourself then that
it is not worth while joining for the
rest of the semester.
It is not necessary to feel slighted
in case you are not asked to join per
sonally by one of the men appointed
to fill out Union cards. The only lim
itation put on membership so far is
that the applicant be a Stanford man
in the bigger sense of the word. That
includes all faculty men and the man
agement of The Union urges them to
join.
Dues may be paid at the cigar
counter any time, and it admits you
to all the privileges without further
formalities â€”except that you come
around to enjoy them.
