Women Have New
Twelve-Oar Gig.
The new twelve-oar gig for the
Women's boathouse has been received
and is now on the lake. The boat
was loaned to the women for this se
mester by the city of Oakland, through
the medium of Mr. Gutleben of the
Municipal Boat House, at Lake Mer
ritt. This style of boat is the same
kind as is used by both the University
of California and Mills College. It is
now possible that competition between
these universities and Stanford may
be arranged for this spring. Daily
practice on the lake will commence
immediately under the direction of
Miss Dorothy Albrecht, '16.
Whites and Blues Play
Six Inning Tie.
Exceptionally fast ball was dis
played in the peanut league last night,
when the Whites and Blues battled six
innings to a 2 to 2 tie. Coleman's
three-bagger in the last of the sixth,
with two out and none on liases, fol
lowed by Hawks' double, saved the
day for the Whites, Coleman's run
tying the score. Batteries for the
game were, Blues, Cullin and Rehm;
Whites, Coleman and Fabling.
Reds Defeat Blacks
In Good Contest.
In four innings of well played base
ball, last night, the Reds succeeded in
defeating the Blacks by a 2 to 1 score.
Tedford's home run in the first in
ning, and Thomas' spearing of a fly to
deep left, were the features of the
game. The Blacks made a hard effort
to overcome the Reds' lead in the last
inning, getting two men on base with
none down, but fast playing by the
Reds retired them scoreless. The bat
teries were Phares and Field for the
Reds, and Clark and Hurley for the
Blacks.
