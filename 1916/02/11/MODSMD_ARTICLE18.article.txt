# Coach Guerena Searches Water Front For Launch
## 
### 
Bent on locating a launch for the
use of Crew Coach "Husky" Guerena,
Manager W. 11. Bloeser will tomorrow
make a thorough search of the San
Francisco water front. Until the
launch ordered from a Seattle man
ufacturer is received, the coach will
be furnished with a rented boat, if
one can be obtained. To date, prac
tice lias been greatly handicapped be
cause of the lack of the launch.
Three eight-man crews and one
four-man crew made the trip to the
Redwood estuary this afternoon. Two
long workouts are scheduled for to
morrow and Sunday, and it is hoped
that the launch will be on hand for
the Sunday practice.
