HISTORY AM) MAIDENS
Stanford, Feb. 11, 1916.
Dearest Ma—Yours of the 7tli inst..
at hand and contents carefully cashed.
Gratitude. Just about a 100 yrs. ago
there was brought forth upon this na
tion a great man, conceived in liberty
and dedicated to the proposition that
all men are created equal. You
guessed—Abe Lincoln. The thing that
strikes me most is that in spite of his
greatness, there is never a holiday on
Feb. 12. There always is for Geo.
Wash, whose biggest accomplishment
; was making fools of two generations
—making them believe he never told a
lie. He had a poor imagination, is all
i I've got to say. He may acrossed the
I Delaware with ice in the river and
I standing up in a boat at that, and
with a mob of Russians on the other
side. He didn't have anything on mo
when I cross Market street with ter
rible jitneys swarming worse than ice.
I have to cross a-rushin'—old stuff,
ma. Which reminds me that Spring is
here.
Oh joyous jubilant Spring—time of
fair maidens, syllabus fees, budding
romance, pesky Hies and midsemester
exes. The maidens are wonderful, the
Hies and exes, worse. The maidens
are in the air and everywhere the
gents'll take them. If I didn't have
to study to fool a prof. I'd tell you
about Junior week that's coming soon.
That's the time the fellows take in
everything, and the girls take in the
fellows. 'Twill keep till my next re
mittance. As old Omar Kiyi said, hap
piness is just lookin' forward, so write
soon, and sign yourself E. F. C. lam
with love, your SONNY.
