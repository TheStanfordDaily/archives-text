We have received an answer to
"Neutral's" communication on the
dramatic situation, which was
printed in The Daily Palo Alto yes
terday, but owing to its great
length are unable to publish it to
day. It will appear in Monday's
issue.
Stanford University, Cal.,
February 11. 1916.
Editor The Daily Palo Alto:
Kindly correct a statement of the
results we expect to obtain from the
use of the transmission towers, that
appeared in the February 10 issue.
We are not working for results that
may bring about a revolution in power
transmission. It is anticipated that
some of our students in the near fu
ture will have to do with the design
and construction of power transmis
sions which will employ voltages in
excess of the highest now in use. We
are undertaking only to disclose facts
and working constants which will be
of material assistance in such prac
tice.
