# Graduate Manager Wants Ex. Committee to Order Up A1 Chinese Funeral
## 
### 
It isn't often that we get a chance to
mention the Graduate Manager in our
columns, but when opportunity knocks
we're always on the job.
Here's the latest in the way of fame
or infame for the G. M.
The other day, as the Squire came
out of the office, he spied Won Lung
Loo, Irish washerwoman man from
Mayfield.
"Hey, you washee dud muchee
good?" shouted the Squire in Latin-
Chinese.
"Me washee clothes," corrected Won
Lung, in pidgeon English.
"Me give 'oo clothes, Snooky-Ook
ums," said Earl, in another well
known modern dialect.
So Won Lung Loo went off with the
Squire's duds.
After weeks of waiting they did —
not come back.
Finally, the Squire did some inves
tigation work a la Burns, and learned
the following facts:
Won Lung Loo brought the Squire's
clothes back, but forgot his room
number. Accordingly, lie borrowed a
Bawl Out. and found but one Behrens
therein. Following his cue—or rather
with it following him—Won Lung Loo
took the Squire's clothes up to the
Gamma Phi house.
Now that the war is over between
1 California and Stanford, the Graduate
Manager is about to start another one
|on his own hook this time. Says the
I Squire, "If I catch any women on the
campus wearing some of my collars,
there's going to he a Chinese funeral
in Mayfield,"
