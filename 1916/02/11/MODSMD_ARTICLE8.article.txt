# Five Negatives Make One Positiveâ€”"Pop" Has a New Calculation System
## 
### 
To Professor Pop Franklin of the
Department of Photography belongs
the credit for startling the scientific
world with a new discovery that will
revolutionize something or other. In
the first grade of the elementary
school, young humans are taught the
cardinal principle that "two negatives
make a positive.' This principle is to
be discarded.
Hereafter "Franklin's theory" will
be ranked with the ABC's and will be
written on every blackboard in every
school, with the terse admonition: do
not erase!
Professor Pop Franklin has discov
ered that two negatives do not make
a positive. But five do. Five nega
tives used to make two and a half pos
itives. But not any more.
And that is why The Daily Palo
Alto staff, from the big chief down to
the littlest squaw, sorrowfully dolled
up today for a second seance on the
Circle in Pally. Yes, somebody
showed his teeth, last Tuesday, and
poisoned the picture. Both poses, too.
Benjamin Franklin had nothing on
his modern namesake, but he didn't
inconvenience people half as much.
