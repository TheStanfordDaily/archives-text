## 
### 
All-star soccer will be the offering
on the turf field tomorrow afternoon,
when Campbell's picked team of San
Francisco players clashes with the
Stanford varsity. Coach Bill Camp
bell is an authority on the round ball
game, and his choice of players on the
invading team is certain to include
the pick of the city leaguers.

as Walters, Priest. Hudson, Pike, and
Marsh, in the forward line, will assure

Clung, Reynolds, and Williams, in the
back Held, to take the responsibility of
stopping the stars' attack.

Erb on bis left and Henderson on the
