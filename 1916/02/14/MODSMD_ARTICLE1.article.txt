# OLYMPIC NINE IS VICTORIOUS OVER VARSITY
## STANFORD TEAM WEAKENED Errors Cost Cardinal Eleven to Five Defeat at Hands of Clubmen 
### 
Taking advantage of a weakened
Stanford team, and some unusual
breaks in the game, the Olympic Club
baseball nine put the Cardinal squad
to rout Saturday, on the varsity dia
mond, score 11 to 5. The best base
ball weather of the year prevailed,
and regardless of defeat, the local
fans rooted as they have seldom done
before. Jack McCarthy handled the
indicator to the satisfaction of all
present, hurrying up a game that had
a tendency to be decidedly slow and
drawn out.
Off Day for Varsity.
Using the words of Coach Harry
Wolter, "It was just one of those off
days that are bound to occur in base
ball. The team has been used to a
certain lineup and a switch, especially
with the captain on the bench, made
them less confident than on ordinary
occasions. At any rate the boys got
all those errors out of their system,
and did it in a game that was unim
portant."
