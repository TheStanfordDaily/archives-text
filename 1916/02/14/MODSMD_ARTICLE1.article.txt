# OLYMPIC NINE IS VICTORIOUS OVER VARSITY
## STANFORD TEAM WEAKENED Errors Cost Cardinal Eleven to Five Defeat at Hands of Clubmen 
### 
Taking advantage of a weakened
Stanford team, and some unusual
breaks in the game, the Olympic Club
baseball nine put the Cardinal squad
to rout Saturday, on the varsity dia
mond, score 11 to 5. The best base
ball weather of the year prevailed,
and regardless of defeat, the local
fans rooted as they have seldom done
before. Jack McCarthy handled the
indicator to the satisfaction of all
present, hurrying up a game that had
a tendency to be decidedly slow and
drawn out.
Off Day for Varsity.
Using the words of Coach Harry
Wolter, "It was just one of those off
days that are bound to occur in base
ball. The team has been used to a
certain lineup and a switch, especially
with the captain on the bench, made
them less confident than on ordinary
occasions. At any rate the boys got
all those errors out of their system,
and did it in a game that was unim
portant."
Stanford scored first, making two
runs in the second frame. Braden
and Sanborn tallied on three hits and
a walk. The remaining Cardinal runs
were chalked up in the lucky seventh,
Stevens, Dickey, and Howe, coming
across on three hits, two errors, and
a hatter hit by a pitched ball.
The visiting nine made two runs in
the fourth inning, six in the fatal
fifth, and three in the ninth. Maloney
crossed the plate three times, Ken
nedy, Manning, and Harrington twice
each, while Kelly and Hynes scored
one tally apiece. The visiting team
made only nine hits to the local
squad's eight, and did not play ex
traordinary ball at any time. Errors
at crucial moments, combined with an
unsteadiness that was apparent to all
present, cost the Cardinal a hard
fouglit and interesting game. The box
score follows:
