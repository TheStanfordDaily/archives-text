# Stanford Oarsmen Have Season's Best Workout at Redwood Yesterday
## 
### 
Covering a distance of ten miles on
tlie Redwood estuary, the Cardinal
crews yesterday had the best work
out of the season. Both the warm
weather and the calm, even surface
of the bay contributed toward mak
ing the day ideal for crew practice.
Had there been a launch on hand for
the use of Coach "Husky" Guerena,
the crew men could have asked for
nothing more. As it was, however,
the coach was not able to get the best
results because of his having to give
all directions from his position as
coxswain in the varsity shell.
On Saturday, Crew Manager W. H.
Bloeser attempted to locate a launch
in San Francisco, which could be
used by the crew coach until the long
awaited boat ordered from Seattle ar
rived at Redwood. He was unable to
get a satisfactory launch, but will try
this week to locate one in time for
the workouts next Saturday and Sun
day.
This afternoon the crew squads
made their usual daily trip to
Redwood. Owing to the low tides,
which will make it impossible to
launch the shells from the boathouse
float, the squad will be unable to take
their regular workout on the estuary
for the next four or five days. In
the meantime, Captain Orme will take
enough men each day to fill out one
shell and go to the bay early in the
afternoon, before the tide goes down.
The remainder of the candidates will
confine their activities to practice on
Lagunita.
According to both Captain Orme
and Coach Guerena, the freshmen out
for places on the eight which will
meet the Washington and California
first year teams, are showing up in
excellent shape. Enough freshmen
are included in the daily squads of
twenty-eight men who are taken to
Redwood, to make two full crews. In
addition, a number of nineteeners are
forced to stay at Lagunita every day,
because of the shortage in shells.
The men taken to the bay today
were as follows:
Varsity—Hatch, coxswain; Maurer,
stroke; Green, Orme, Rogers, .Taco
mini, Worth, Russell, and' Xeuner,
bow.
Freshmen —Lyon, coxswain; King,
Williamson, LaForge, Watts, Waite,
Brown, Bent, and Curtice.
Second Varsity—Willis, coxswain:
Steinbeck, Keller, Coleman, Andrews,
Swartz, Bowling, Boydston, and .Taco
mini.
Four-Oar —Montgomery, coxswain;
Heron. Kester, Betts, and .Teffers.

Covering a distance of ten miles on
tlie Redwood estuary, the Cardinal
crews yesterday had the best work
out of the season. Both the warm
weather and the calm, even surface
of the bay contributed toward mak
ing the day ideal for crew practice.
Had there been a launch on hand for
the use of Coach "Husky" Guerena,
the crew men could have asked for
nothing more. As it was, however,
the coach was not able to get the best
results because of his having to give
all directions from his position as
coxswain in the varsity shell.
On Saturday, Crew Manager W. H.
Bloeser attempted to locate a launch
in San Francisco, which could be
used by the crew coach until the long
awaited boat ordered from Seattle ar
rived at Redwood. He was unable to
get a satisfactory launch, but will try
this week to locate one in time for
the workouts next Saturday and Sun
day.
This afternoon the crew squads
made their usual daily trip to
Redwood. Owing to the low tides,
which will make it impossible to
launch the shells from the boathouse
float, the squad will be unable to take
their regular workout on the estuary
for the next four or five days. In
the meantime, Captain Orme will take
enough men each day to fill out one
shell and go to the bay early in the
afternoon, before the tide goes down.
The remainder of the candidates will
confine their activities to practice on
Lagunita.
According to both Captain Orme
and Coach Guerena, the freshmen out
for places on the eight which will
meet the Washington and California
first year teams, are showing up in
excellent shape. Enough freshmen
are included in the daily squads of
twenty-eight men who are taken to
Redwood, to make two full crews. In
addition, a number of nineteeners are
forced to stay at Lagunita every day,
because of the shortage in shells.
The men taken to the bay today
were as follows:
Varsity—Hatch, coxswain; Maurer,
stroke; Green, Orme, Rogers, .Taco
mini, Worth, Russell, and' Xeuner,
bow.
Freshmen —Lyon, coxswain; King,
Williamson, LaForge, Watts, Waite,
Brown, Bent, and Curtice.
Second Varsity—Willis, coxswain:
Steinbeck, Keller, Coleman, Andrews,
Swartz, Bowling, Boydston, and .Taco
mini.
Four-Oar —Montgomery, coxswain;
Heron. Kester, Betts, and .Teffers.
