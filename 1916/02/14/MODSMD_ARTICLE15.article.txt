Members of Sword and Sandals
have answered the implied charges of
"Neutral" in another column of this
issue. The communication clears up
a matter that has long been hazy in
the minds of most people on the cam
pus—the technical side of the man
agement of Assembly Hall plays.
These men explain why Sword and
Sandals has a right to charge for
stage productions and justify the or
ganization in its course.
This explanation is timely for there
has been misunderstanding on the
campus concerning the basis of Sword
and Sandal's stage rights. But with
the explanation that they are based
on the ownership of most of the prop
erties by the organization there can
be no objections to a reasonable
charge for the use of this equipment.
But this justification offers nothing
constructive toward the improvement
of the dramatic situation at Stanford.
Justification of present methods does
not solve the bigger problem at hand.
May we hope for some action toward
that end in the near future?
