University of California athletes
have added to their reputation for ver
satility by emulating "Old Dobbin's"
treadmill tactics. The very latest
thing to be put over by the Califor
nians is the adoption of Christian Sci
ence crew practice. This the Bears
have aconiplished by anchoring a shell
in the middle of the school's swim
ming plunge. The clever arrange
ment was made necessary by the low
tides in Oakland estuary last week,
which prevented the oarsmen from
reaching open water without wading
through a sea of mud.
