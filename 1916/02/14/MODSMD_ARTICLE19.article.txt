To the Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
Not to prolong a somewhat tedious
discussion, but to prevent any miscon
ception as to the truth regarding the
dramatic situation, which might arise
from a perusal of "Neutral's" com
munication of Thursday last, we sub
mit the following facts, with as few
opinions, as possible. "Neutral's"
honesty of opinion is not doubted.
The opinion is, however, inexact, to
say the least.
"Paper" is NOT, and never has
been, given out to fill houses, make
friends, or for any purpose, as one
would infer from "Neutral's" letter.
There has never been a single college
performance called off on account of
"110 seat sale." The only time that
has ever been done, was for Mme.
La Gai, a professional performance.
What have dramatic conditions at
Stanford to do with that?
As to the use of "complimentary"
tickets. There is the usual "comp"
list, which is the same for all per
formances. "Comps" are issued by
the manager of seat sales, (who since
last semester is a representative of
the business office, and who formerly
was appointed by the graduate man
ager), to the honorary officers of ths
Student Body, the press, and to such
business firms as the chairman of trie
committee approves, i.e., firms that
have loaned furniture, etc. NOT
ONCE, IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS
AT LEAST, HAVE "COMPS" BEEN
GIVEN TO FILL THE HOUSE.
These are facts, not opinions. In the
Sword and Sandals productions,
neither the members of the cast nor
of the society receive tickets, nor are
tickets even drawn out in advance of
the scat sale. Other organizations do
as they see fit in this matter, but the
same custom is usually followed.
Now, just a word about these so
called "stage rights." "Neutral" Is
evidently referring to the fact that
Sword and Sandals stages the plays,
and charges a fee of twenty-five dol
lars for the use of stage equipment.
There has always been a deal of mis
understanding about that matter and
we want to take this opportunity to
explain it, believing that w r hen the
facts are known every one who is
willing to take a reasonable view of
the matter will be satisfied that it is
proper.
A few years ago there was absolute
ly nothing on the Assembly Hall stage
but four brick walls, a colored glass
dome overhead, and a curtain that
was an insult to the eyes. Sword and
Sandals petitioned the trustees, time
after time, to secure the bare essen
tials for producing plays, and finally
secured permission to install on the
stage AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE,
the necessary apparatus. They hesi
tated to incur the expense, but finally
went ahead and did so. Unfortunate
ly most of the receipts and vouchers
for that work have been lost during
the several college generations which
have passed since then, but we have
a few of them, those covering part of
the electrical work. The three bor
der lights, two bunch lights, with the
| necessary cables, cost $186.80. That
is a mere beginning on what was put
in there. Tt leaves out of account the
installation of floor sockets, foot
lights, a switchboard, the building of
the gridiron to carry the drops and
borders overhead, the purchase of a
floor-cloth, and last, but not least,
a new curtain, You didn't know, per
haps, that Sword and Sandals sup
plied the Assembly Hall with the cur
tain now in there? It cost close to
six hundred dollars. Figure it up for
yourself. The work had to be done
by expert theatrical mechanics; the
trustees insisted that everything be
done absolutely right, to secure safe
ty from fire and breakage. The mean
est estimate you can make 011 the
work if you take the trouble to in
quire into the cost of such things, car-
ries it well over fifteeu hundred dol
lars.
The present footlights and the ex
cellent switchboard now in the hall
were installed by the business office.
Every stick and rope on that stage,
as well as the curtain, was placed
there and paid for by Sword and San
dals. Where did they get the money?
We understand they borrowed it and
trusted to future plays to enable them
to make good on the loan.
So much for the original equip
ment. That didn't solve the problem
entirely. Some provision had to bo
made for keeping up the equipment
once it was installed. Where was
that money to come from? We leave
it to you "Neutral," as a reasonable
man, (or is it woman?), should not
all the plays contribute to support
that equipment, to provide for its re
newal and improvement as necessary?
J Would it be fair to say to Sword and
Sandals, after installing it at their
own expense, "Good work, keep it up
now, but we all want to use it just
as much as you do?" We think not.
| All the organizations who use the
I equipment should help pay for its up
j keep and improvement. How is that
: to be accomplished but by charging
i each play a fixed sum for that pur
pose? That is what has been done,
and this charge of twenty-five dol
lars has been made for that purpose.
There have been times, when plays
have failed financially, that this has
not been collected, but obviously that
practice can't be too freely followed
without defating the whole scheme.
Is twenty-five dollars too much?
Let us give you an idea of what is
done with that money. A couple of
years ago the curtain got out of order.
Several willing and enthusiastic
workers here endeavored to fix it, but
it wouldn't "fix;" they didn't under
stand the thing. A man had to be
brought from the city to fix it. Cost
about twenty dollars. For this last
show the curtain bad to be fixed
again; this time, fortunately, we were
able to do it ourselves, but a man
spent a whole afternoon, slung by a
rope from the gridiron, to do it.
Again, there is on the floor of the
stage, a large canvas cloth, known as
a "floor cloth." to deaden footstep 3,
etc. For several years we have
patched and coaxed that, thing to
make it last a little longer, but finally
a girl tripped over one of the rips in
it, and sprained her ankle. A new
floor cloth had to be bought. All the
plays benefit equally from the use of
it —where was the money to come
from to pay for it? Sword and San
days bought it with the funds pro
vided by this fee charged all the plays.
Canvas isn't cheap. Again, a spot
light had to be purchased; the in
creasing demands for "better plays"
made it necessary. A spot-light costs
a lot of money; anywhere from $85.00
to $125.00. Sword and Sandals bought
the spot-light, and yet Sword and
Sandals has never used that spot
light. in any of its plays. It has gone
for the use of operas, etc. Lights are
constantly disappearing from the
stage—we lock them up, but they get
broken, burnt out. some of them dis
appear, as do those in the library; at
any rate it is necessary to buy at
least three hundred new lamps a year,
together with a lot. of electrical ap
paratus to replace that used up.
Where is the money to come from, we
ask in all reason? These are but in
stances—there was the matter of a
ceiling for use in interior scenes—in
all the plays, mind you; that had to be
made by some one who knew the busi
ness. It cost about ninety dollars
when complete, with special pulleys,
etc., and not long ago it had to be
re-covered at an additional expense.
We could enumerate a lot more, but
space will permit only a mere men
tion of such things as replacing ropes.
They're from 75 to 100 feet long,

"Neutral," and have to be kept in good
condition to insure safety; tools, nails,
orchestra lights, a dozen odds and
ends that have to be kept on hand,
tlie building of the "practical" doors,
now used in most of the interior
scenes, all the replacement and im
provement that has to be made con
stantly. Funds must be provided
somewhere. Every cent that Sword
and Sandals collects goes right back
into that in equipment.
Now, why should Sword and San
dals be the ones who have charge of
this business?
Some one has to lie responsible, and
the Trustees MADE Sword and San
days responsible for the handling of
the stage when the equipment was
installed.
You know, "Neutral," what is every
body's business is nobody's business,
and stage equipment is not to be ne
glected, nor can it be handled by peo
ple who know nothing about it; who,
while eager and willing to see their
own show go through, are apt to hurt
somebody by pulling the wrong rope
and letting a heavy drop or a set of
scenery come crashing down on the
heads of those on stage. In all rea
son, we protest that a little skill
means more than a few dollars saved
in a case like this. Skill only comes
from practice in handling scenery.
Now as to the money paid the stage
hands. We want to say right here
that if there is any man in the Uni
versity willing to place himself at the
disposal of the stage manager, to go
down there to a dark, dusty basement,
and sort out scenery, carry it to the
Assembly Hall, empty and cold, with
out the glamour of lights and the ex
citement attending a play on the night
of performance, to go down there for
three or four scene rehearsals at
night, and a few other unattractive
things, and do it for nothing, let him
step up, and he can have the job for
the asking. Hut remember this, you
can't risk putting a bunch of green
horns on the stage to handle scenery
on the night of a play without run
ning the risk of getting someone hurt
through the simple ignorance of an
enthusiastic rope-puller. You have
got to keep men on the crew as long
as possible to secure efficiency and
safety. One thing more, the men who
i have worked on the stage crew have
always been men who needed *the
money. They are paid twenty-five
cents an hour, surely not an exorbi
tant rate, is it "Neutral?"
"Neutral" suggests lowering prices.
Let's have a look at that. Masquers
thought that was the remedy, and put
on an attraction last year and charged
twenty-five cents admission. No more
people came out to that, show than
came to the last Masquer plays. The
point is that there is a certain num
ber on which you can depend for
dramatics here, at the regular scale
of prices; that has been proved more
times than one.
As to going to the city to see pro
fessional plays. We are not com
peting with professionals, to begin
with. We never hope to keep at home
those who seek plays appearing in the
city. Besides, it is stretching things
somewhat to say the trip to the city
can be made "For the same expendi
ture or less.'" Let us keep within rea
son, "Neutral."
We are ready to stand back of any
feasible plan to improve conditions in
dramatics—but we insist that there
must be some one responsible—some
one to attend to things all tlie fime,
and it is obvious that the fewer peo
ple you spread that responsibility
among, the better it is going to be for
all concerned. Ask your Economics
professor or some of these efficiency
engineers about it. And more than
that, it has got to be some permanent
organization. Heretofore, the business
office has held Sword and Sandals
strictly accountable for the conduct of
the stage. Anything that is broken.
Sword and Sandals pays for. The
business office has been satisfied with
their work—can you suggest some
thing better?

Where is the money to come from, we
ask in all reason? These are but in
stances—there was the matter of a
ceiling for use in interior scenes—in
all the plays, mind you; that had to be
made by some one who knew the busi
ness. It cost about ninety dollars
when complete, with special pulleys,
etc., and not long ago it had to be
re-covered at an additional expense.
We could enumerate a lot more, but
space will permit only a mere men
tion of such things as replacing ropes.
They're from 75 to 100 feet long,

"Neutral," and have to be kept in good
condition to insure safety; tools, nails,
orchestra lights, a dozen odds and
ends that have to be kept on hand,
tlie building of the "practical" doors,
now used in most of the interior
scenes, all the replacement and im
provement that has to be made con
stantly. Funds must be provided
somewhere. Every cent that Sword
and Sandals collects goes right back
into that in equipment.
Now, why should Sword and San
dals be the ones who have charge of
this business?
Some one has to lie responsible, and
the Trustees MADE Sword and San
days responsible for the handling of
the stage when the equipment was
installed.
You know, "Neutral," what is every
body's business is nobody's business,
and stage equipment is not to be ne
glected, nor can it be handled by peo
ple who know nothing about it; who,
while eager and willing to see their
own show go through, are apt to hurt
somebody by pulling the wrong rope
and letting a heavy drop or a set of
scenery come crashing down on the
heads of those on stage. In all rea
son, we protest that a little skill
means more than a few dollars saved
in a case like this. Skill only comes
from practice in handling scenery.
Now as to the money paid the stage
hands. We want to say right here
that if there is any man in the Uni
versity willing to place himself at the
disposal of the stage manager, to go
down there to a dark, dusty basement,
and sort out scenery, carry it to the
Assembly Hall, empty and cold, with
out the glamour of lights and the ex
citement attending a play on the night
of performance, to go down there for
three or four scene rehearsals at
night, and a few other unattractive
things, and do it for nothing, let him
step up, and he can have the job for
the asking. Hut remember this, you
can't risk putting a bunch of green
horns on the stage to handle scenery
on the night of a play without run
ning the risk of getting someone hurt
through the simple ignorance of an
enthusiastic rope-puller. You have
got to keep men on the crew as long
as possible to secure efficiency and
safety. One thing more, the men who
i have worked on the stage crew have
always been men who needed *the
money. They are paid twenty-five
cents an hour, surely not an exorbi
tant rate, is it "Neutral?"
"Neutral" suggests lowering prices.
Let's have a look at that. Masquers
thought that was the remedy, and put
on an attraction last year and charged
twenty-five cents admission. No more
people came out to that, show than
came to the last Masquer plays. The
point is that there is a certain num
ber on which you can depend for
dramatics here, at the regular scale
of prices; that has been proved more
times than one.
As to going to the city to see pro
fessional plays. We are not com
peting with professionals, to begin
with. We never hope to keep at home
those who seek plays appearing in the
city. Besides, it is stretching things
somewhat to say the trip to the city
can be made "For the same expendi
ture or less.'" Let us keep within rea
son, "Neutral."
We are ready to stand back of any
feasible plan to improve conditions in
dramatics—but we insist that there
must be some one responsible—some
one to attend to things all tlie fime,
and it is obvious that the fewer peo
ple you spread that responsibility
among, the better it is going to be for
all concerned. Ask your Economics
professor or some of these efficiency
engineers about it. And more than
that, it has got to be some permanent
organization. Heretofore, the business
office has held Sword and Sandals
strictly accountable for the conduct of
the stage. Anything that is broken.
Sword and Sandals pays for. The
business office has been satisfied with
their work—can you suggest some
thing better?

To the Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
Not to prolong a somewhat tedious
discussion, but to prevent any miscon
ception as to the truth regarding the
dramatic situation, which might arise
from a perusal of "Neutral's" com
munication of Thursday last, we sub
mit the following facts, with as few
opinions, as possible. "Neutral's"
honesty of opinion is not doubted.
The opinion is, however, inexact, to
say the least.
"Paper" is NOT, and never has
been, given out to fill houses, make
friends, or for any purpose, as one
would infer from "Neutral's" letter.
There has never been a single college
performance called off on account of
"110 seat sale." The only time that
has ever been done, was for Mme.
La Gai, a professional performance.
What have dramatic conditions at
Stanford to do with that?
As to the use of "complimentary"
tickets. There is the usual "comp"
list, which is the same for all per
formances. "Comps" are issued by
the manager of seat sales, (who since
last semester is a representative of
the business office, and who formerly
was appointed by the graduate man
ager), to the honorary officers of ths
Student Body, the press, and to such
business firms as the chairman of trie
committee approves, i.e., firms that
have loaned furniture, etc. NOT
ONCE, IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS
AT LEAST, HAVE "COMPS" BEEN
GIVEN TO FILL THE HOUSE.
These are facts, not opinions. In the
Sword and Sandals productions,
neither the members of the cast nor
of the society receive tickets, nor are
tickets even drawn out in advance of
the scat sale. Other organizations do
as they see fit in this matter, but the
same custom is usually followed.
Now, just a word about these so
called "stage rights." "Neutral" Is
evidently referring to the fact that
Sword and Sandals stages the plays,
and charges a fee of twenty-five dol
lars for the use of stage equipment.
There has always been a deal of mis
understanding about that matter and
we want to take this opportunity to
explain it, believing that w r hen the
facts are known every one who is
willing to take a reasonable view of
the matter will be satisfied that it is
proper.
A few years ago there was absolute
ly nothing on the Assembly Hall stage
but four brick walls, a colored glass
dome overhead, and a curtain that
was an insult to the eyes. Sword and
Sandals petitioned the trustees, time
after time, to secure the bare essen
tials for producing plays, and finally
secured permission to install on the
stage AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE,
the necessary apparatus. They hesi
tated to incur the expense, but finally
went ahead and did so. Unfortunate
ly most of the receipts and vouchers
for that work have been lost during
the several college generations which
have passed since then, but we have
a few of them, those covering part of
the electrical work. The three bor
der lights, two bunch lights, with the
| necessary cables, cost $186.80. That
is a mere beginning on what was put
in there. Tt leaves out of account the
installation of floor sockets, foot
lights, a switchboard, the building of
the gridiron to carry the drops and
borders overhead, the purchase of a
floor-cloth, and last, but not least,
a new curtain, You didn't know, per
haps, that Sword and Sandals sup
plied the Assembly Hall with the cur
tain now in there? It cost close to
six hundred dollars. Figure it up for
yourself. The work had to be done
by expert theatrical mechanics; the
trustees insisted that everything be
done absolutely right, to secure safe
ty from fire and breakage. The mean
est estimate you can make 011 the
work if you take the trouble to in
quire into the cost of such things, car-
ries it well over fifteeu hundred dol
lars.
The present footlights and the ex
cellent switchboard now in the hall
were installed by the business office.
Every stick and rope on that stage,
as well as the curtain, was placed
there and paid for by Sword and San
dals. Where did they get the money?
We understand they borrowed it and
trusted to future plays to enable them
to make good on the loan.
So much for the original equip
ment. That didn't solve the problem
entirely. Some provision had to bo
made for keeping up the equipment
once it was installed. Where was
that money to come from? We leave
it to you "Neutral," as a reasonable
man, (or is it woman?), should not
all the plays contribute to support
that equipment, to provide for its re
newal and improvement as necessary?
J Would it be fair to say to Sword and
Sandals, after installing it at their
own expense, "Good work, keep it up
now, but we all want to use it just
as much as you do?" We think not.
| All the organizations who use the
I equipment should help pay for its up
j keep and improvement. How is that
: to be accomplished but by charging
i each play a fixed sum for that pur
pose? That is what has been done,
and this charge of twenty-five dol
lars has been made for that purpose.
There have been times, when plays
have failed financially, that this has
not been collected, but obviously that
practice can't be too freely followed
without defating the whole scheme.
Is twenty-five dollars too much?
Let us give you an idea of what is
done with that money. A couple of
years ago the curtain got out of order.
Several willing and enthusiastic
workers here endeavored to fix it, but
it wouldn't "fix;" they didn't under
stand the thing. A man had to be
brought from the city to fix it. Cost
about twenty dollars. For this last
show the curtain bad to be fixed
again; this time, fortunately, we were
able to do it ourselves, but a man
spent a whole afternoon, slung by a
rope from the gridiron, to do it.
Again, there is on the floor of the
stage, a large canvas cloth, known as
a "floor cloth." to deaden footstep 3,
etc. For several years we have
patched and coaxed that, thing to
make it last a little longer, but finally
a girl tripped over one of the rips in
it, and sprained her ankle. A new
floor cloth had to be bought. All the
plays benefit equally from the use of
it —where was the money to come
from to pay for it? Sword and San
days bought it with the funds pro
vided by this fee charged all the plays.
Canvas isn't cheap. Again, a spot
light had to be purchased; the in
creasing demands for "better plays"
made it necessary. A spot-light costs
a lot of money; anywhere from $85.00
to $125.00. Sword and Sandals bought
the spot-light, and yet Sword and
Sandals has never used that spot
light. in any of its plays. It has gone
for the use of operas, etc. Lights are
constantly disappearing from the
stage—we lock them up, but they get
broken, burnt out. some of them dis
appear, as do those in the library; at
any rate it is necessary to buy at
least three hundred new lamps a year,
together with a lot. of electrical ap
paratus to replace that used up.
Where is the money to come from, we
ask in all reason? These are but in
stances—there was the matter of a
ceiling for use in interior scenes—in
all the plays, mind you; that had to be
made by some one who knew the busi
ness. It cost about ninety dollars
when complete, with special pulleys,
etc., and not long ago it had to be
re-covered at an additional expense.
We could enumerate a lot more, but
space will permit only a mere men
tion of such things as replacing ropes.
They're from 75 to 100 feet long,

"Neutral," and have to be kept in good
condition to insure safety; tools, nails,
orchestra lights, a dozen odds and
ends that have to be kept on hand,

tated to incur the expense, but finally
went ahead and did so. Unfortunate
ly most of the receipts and vouchers
for that work have been lost during
the several college generations which
have passed since then, but we have
a few of them, those covering part of
the electrical work. The three bor
der lights, two bunch lights, with the
| necessary cables, cost $186.80. That
is a mere beginning on what was put
in there. Tt leaves out of account the
installation of floor sockets, foot
lights, a switchboard, the building of
the gridiron to carry the drops and
borders overhead, the purchase of a
floor-cloth, and last, but not least,
a new curtain, You didn't know, per
haps, that Sword and Sandals sup
plied the Assembly Hall with the cur
tain now in there? It cost close to
six hundred dollars. Figure it up for
yourself. The work had to be done
by expert theatrical mechanics; the
trustees insisted that everything be
done absolutely right, to secure safe
ty from fire and breakage. The mean
est estimate you can make 011 the
work if you take the trouble to in
quire into the cost of such things, car-
ries it well over fifteeu hundred dol
lars.
The present footlights and the ex
cellent switchboard now in the hall
were installed by the business office.
Every stick and rope on that stage,
as well as the curtain, was placed
there and paid for by Sword and San
dals. Where did they get the money?
We understand they borrowed it and
trusted to future plays to enable them
to make good on the loan.
So much for the original equip
ment. That didn't solve the problem
entirely. Some provision had to bo
made for keeping up the equipment
once it was installed. Where was
that money to come from? We leave
it to you "Neutral," as a reasonable
man, (or is it woman?), should not
all the plays contribute to support
that equipment, to provide for its re
newal and improvement as necessary?
J Would it be fair to say to Sword and
Sandals, after installing it at their
own expense, "Good work, keep it up
now, but we all want to use it just
as much as you do?" We think not.
| All the organizations who use the
I equipment should help pay for its up
j keep and improvement. How is that
: to be accomplished but by charging
i each play a fixed sum for that pur
pose? That is what has been done,
and this charge of twenty-five dol
lars has been made for that purpose.
There have been times, when plays
have failed financially, that this has
not been collected, but obviously that
practice can't be too freely followed
without defating the whole scheme.
Is twenty-five dollars too much?
Let us give you an idea of what is
done with that money. A couple of
years ago the curtain got out of order.
Several willing and enthusiastic
workers here endeavored to fix it, but
it wouldn't "fix;" they didn't under
stand the thing. A man had to be
brought from the city to fix it. Cost
about twenty dollars. For this last
show the curtain bad to be fixed
again; this time, fortunately, we were
able to do it ourselves, but a man
spent a whole afternoon, slung by a
rope from the gridiron, to do it.
Again, there is on the floor of the
stage, a large canvas cloth, known as
a "floor cloth." to deaden footstep 3,
etc. For several years we have
patched and coaxed that, thing to
make it last a little longer, but finally
a girl tripped over one of the rips in
it, and sprained her ankle. A new
floor cloth had to be bought. All the
plays benefit equally from the use of
it —where was the money to come
from to pay for it? Sword and San
days bought it with the funds pro
vided by this fee charged all the plays.
Canvas isn't cheap. Again, a spot
light had to be purchased; the in
creasing demands for "better plays"
made it necessary. A spot-light costs
a lot of money; anywhere from $85.00
to $125.00. Sword and Sandals bought
the spot-light, and yet Sword and
Sandals has never used that spot
light. in any of its plays. It has gone
for the use of operas, etc. Lights are
constantly disappearing from the
stage—we lock them up, but they get
broken, burnt out. some of them dis
appear, as do those in the library; at
any rate it is necessary to buy at
least three hundred new lamps a year,
together with a lot. of electrical ap
paratus to replace that used up.
Where is the money to come from, we
ask in all reason? These are but in
stances—there was the matter of a
ceiling for use in interior scenes—in
all the plays, mind you; that had to be
made by some one who knew the busi
ness. It cost about ninety dollars
when complete, with special pulleys,
etc., and not long ago it had to be
re-covered at an additional expense.
We could enumerate a lot more, but
space will permit only a mere men
tion of such things as replacing ropes.
They're from 75 to 100 feet long,

"Neutral," and have to be kept in good
condition to insure safety; tools, nails,
orchestra lights, a dozen odds and
ends that have to be kept on hand,
tlie building of the "practical" doors,
now used in most of the interior
scenes, all the replacement and im
provement that has to be made con
stantly. Funds must be provided
somewhere. Every cent that Sword
and Sandals collects goes right back
into that in equipment.
Now, why should Sword and San
dals be the ones who have charge of
this business?
Some one has to lie responsible, and
the Trustees MADE Sword and San
days responsible for the handling of
the stage when the equipment was
installed.
You know, "Neutral," what is every
body's business is nobody's business,
and stage equipment is not to be ne
glected, nor can it be handled by peo
ple who know nothing about it; who,
while eager and willing to see their
own show go through, are apt to hurt
somebody by pulling the wrong rope
and letting a heavy drop or a set of
scenery come crashing down on the
heads of those on stage. In all rea
son, we protest that a little skill
means more than a few dollars saved
in a case like this. Skill only comes
from practice in handling scenery.
Now as to the money paid the stage
hands. We want to say right here
that if there is any man in the Uni
versity willing to place himself at the
disposal of the stage manager, to go
down there to a dark, dusty basement,
and sort out scenery, carry it to the
Assembly Hall, empty and cold, with
out the glamour of lights and the ex
citement attending a play on the night
of performance, to go down there for
three or four scene rehearsals at
night, and a few other unattractive
things, and do it for nothing, let him
step up, and he can have the job for
the asking. Hut remember this, you
can't risk putting a bunch of green
horns on the stage to handle scenery
on the night of a play without run
ning the risk of getting someone hurt
through the simple ignorance of an
enthusiastic rope-puller. You have
got to keep men on the crew as long
as possible to secure efficiency and
safety. One thing more, the men who
i have worked on the stage crew have
always been men who needed *the
money. They are paid twenty-five
cents an hour, surely not an exorbi
tant rate, is it "Neutral?"
"Neutral" suggests lowering prices.
Let's have a look at that. Masquers
thought that was the remedy, and put
on an attraction last year and charged
twenty-five cents admission. No more
people came out to that, show than
came to the last Masquer plays. The
point is that there is a certain num
ber on which you can depend for
dramatics here, at the regular scale
of prices; that has been proved more
times than one.
As to going to the city to see pro
fessional plays. We are not com
peting with professionals, to begin
with. We never hope to keep at home
those who seek plays appearing in the
city. Besides, it is stretching things
somewhat to say the trip to the city
can be made "For the same expendi
ture or less.'" Let us keep within rea
son, "Neutral."
We are ready to stand back of any
feasible plan to improve conditions in
dramatics—but we insist that there
must be some one responsible—some
one to attend to things all tlie fime,
and it is obvious that the fewer peo
ple you spread that responsibility
among, the better it is going to be for
all concerned. Ask your Economics
professor or some of these efficiency
engineers about it. And more than
that, it has got to be some permanent
organization. Heretofore, the business
office has held Sword and Sandals
strictly accountable for the conduct of
the stage. Anything that is broken.
Sword and Sandals pays for. The
business office has been satisfied with
their work—can you suggest some
thing better?

To the Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
Not to prolong a somewhat tedious
discussion, but to prevent any miscon
ception as to the truth regarding the
dramatic situation, which might arise
from a perusal of "Neutral's" com
munication of Thursday last, we sub
mit the following facts, with as few
opinions, as possible. "Neutral's"
honesty of opinion is not doubted.
The opinion is, however, inexact, to
say the least.
"Paper" is NOT, and never has
been, given out to fill houses, make
friends, or for any purpose, as one
would infer from "Neutral's" letter.
There has never been a single college
performance called off on account of
"110 seat sale." The only time that
has ever been done, was for Mme.
La Gai, a professional performance.
What have dramatic conditions at
Stanford to do with that?
As to the use of "complimentary"
tickets. There is the usual "comp"
list, which is the same for all per
formances. "Comps" are issued by
the manager of seat sales, (who since
last semester is a representative of
the business office, and who formerly
was appointed by the graduate man
ager), to the honorary officers of ths
Student Body, the press, and to such
business firms as the chairman of trie
committee approves, i.e., firms that
have loaned furniture, etc. NOT
ONCE, IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS
AT LEAST, HAVE "COMPS" BEEN
GIVEN TO FILL THE HOUSE.
These are facts, not opinions. In the
Sword and Sandals productions,
neither the members of the cast nor
of the society receive tickets, nor are
tickets even drawn out in advance of
the scat sale. Other organizations do
as they see fit in this matter, but the
same custom is usually followed.
Now, just a word about these so
called "stage rights." "Neutral" Is
evidently referring to the fact that
Sword and Sandals stages the plays,
and charges a fee of twenty-five dol
lars for the use of stage equipment.
There has always been a deal of mis
understanding about that matter and
we want to take this opportunity to
explain it, believing that w r hen the
facts are known every one who is
willing to take a reasonable view of
the matter will be satisfied that it is
proper.
A few years ago there was absolute
ly nothing on the Assembly Hall stage
but four brick walls, a colored glass
dome overhead, and a curtain that
was an insult to the eyes. Sword and
Sandals petitioned the trustees, time
after time, to secure the bare essen
tials for producing plays, and finally
secured permission to install on the
stage AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE,
the necessary apparatus. They hesi
tated to incur the expense, but finally
went ahead and did so. Unfortunate
ly most of the receipts and vouchers
for that work have been lost during
the several college generations which
have passed since then, but we have
a few of them, those covering part of
the electrical work. The three bor
der lights, two bunch lights, with the
| necessary cables, cost $186.80. That
is a mere beginning on what was put

"Neutral" suggests lowering prices.

thought that was the remedy, and put
on an attraction last year and charged
twenty-five cents admission. No more

came to the last Masquer plays. The

To the Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
Not to prolong a somewhat tedious
discussion, but to prevent any miscon
ception as to the truth regarding the
dramatic situation, which might arise
from a perusal of "Neutral's" com
munication of Thursday last, we sub
mit the following facts, with as few
opinions, as possible. "Neutral's"
honesty of opinion is not doubted.
The opinion is, however, inexact, to
say the least.
"Paper" is NOT, and never has
been, given out to fill houses, make
friends, or for any purpose, as one
would infer from "Neutral's" letter.
There has never been a single college
performance called off on account of
"110 seat sale." The only time that
has ever been done, was for Mme.
La Gai, a professional performance.
What have dramatic conditions at
Stanford to do with that?
As to the use of "complimentary"
tickets. There is the usual "comp"
list, which is the same for all per
formances. "Comps" are issued by
the manager of seat sales, (who since
last semester is a representative of
the business office, and who formerly
was appointed by the graduate man
ager), to the honorary officers of ths
Student Body, the press, and to such
business firms as the chairman of trie
committee approves, i.e., firms that
have loaned furniture, etc. NOT
ONCE, IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS
AT LEAST, HAVE "COMPS" BEEN
GIVEN TO FILL THE HOUSE.
These are facts, not opinions. In the
Sword and Sandals productions,
neither the members of the cast nor
of the society receive tickets, nor are
tickets even drawn out in advance of
the scat sale. Other organizations do
as they see fit in this matter, but the
same custom is usually followed.
Now, just a word about these so
called "stage rights." "Neutral" Is
evidently referring to the fact that
Sword and Sandals stages the plays,
and charges a fee of twenty-five dol
lars for the use of stage equipment.
There has always been a deal of mis
understanding about that matter and
we want to take this opportunity to
explain it, believing that w r hen the
facts are known every one who is
willing to take a reasonable view of
the matter will be satisfied that it is
proper.
A few years ago there was absolute
ly nothing on the Assembly Hall stage
but four brick walls, a colored glass
dome overhead, and a curtain that
was an insult to the eyes. Sword and
Sandals petitioned the trustees, time
after time, to secure the bare essen
tials for producing plays, and finally
secured permission to install on the
stage AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE,
the necessary apparatus. They hesi
tated to incur the expense, but finally
went ahead and did so. Unfortunate
ly most of the receipts and vouchers
for that work have been lost during
the several college generations which
have passed since then, but we have
a few of them, those covering part of
the electrical work. The three bor
der lights, two bunch lights, with the
| necessary cables, cost $186.80. That
is a mere beginning on what was put
in there. Tt leaves out of account the
installation of floor sockets, foot
lights, a switchboard, the building of
the gridiron to carry the drops and
borders overhead, the purchase of a
floor-cloth, and last, but not least,
a new curtain, You didn't know, per
haps, that Sword and Sandals sup
plied the Assembly Hall with the cur
tain now in there? It cost close to
six hundred dollars. Figure it up for
yourself. The work had to be done
by expert theatrical mechanics; the
trustees insisted that everything be
done absolutely right, to secure safe
ty from fire and breakage. The mean
est estimate you can make 011 the
work if you take the trouble to in
quire into the cost of such things, car-
ries it well over fifteeu hundred dol
lars.
The present footlights and the ex
cellent switchboard now in the hall
were installed by the business office.
Every stick and rope on that stage,
as well as the curtain, was placed
there and paid for by Sword and San
dals. Where did they get the money?
We understand they borrowed it and
trusted to future plays to enable them
to make good on the loan.
So much for the original equip
ment. That didn't solve the problem
entirely. Some provision had to bo
made for keeping up the equipment
once it was installed. Where was
that money to come from? We leave
it to you "Neutral," as a reasonable
man, (or is it woman?), should not
all the plays contribute to support
that equipment, to provide for its re
newal and improvement as necessary?
J Would it be fair to say to Sword and
Sandals, after installing it at their
own expense, "Good work, keep it up
now, but we all want to use it just
as much as you do?" We think not.
| All the organizations who use the
I equipment should help pay for its up
j keep and improvement. How is that
: to be accomplished but by charging
i each play a fixed sum for that pur
pose? That is what has been done,
and this charge of twenty-five dol
lars has been made for that purpose.
There have been times, when plays
have failed financially, that this has
not been collected, but obviously that
practice can't be too freely followed
without defating the whole scheme.
Is twenty-five dollars too much?
Let us give you an idea of what is
done with that money. A couple of
years ago the curtain got out of order.
Several willing and enthusiastic
workers here endeavored to fix it, but
it wouldn't "fix;" they didn't under
stand the thing. A man had to be
brought from the city to fix it. Cost
about twenty dollars. For this last
show the curtain bad to be fixed
again; this time, fortunately, we were
able to do it ourselves, but a man
spent a whole afternoon, slung by a
rope from the gridiron, to do it.
Again, there is on the floor of the
stage, a large canvas cloth, known as
a "floor cloth." to deaden footstep 3,
etc. For several years we have
patched and coaxed that, thing to
make it last a little longer, but finally
a girl tripped over one of the rips in
it, and sprained her ankle. A new
floor cloth had to be bought. All the
plays benefit equally from the use of
it —where was the money to come
from to pay for it? Sword and San
days bought it with the funds pro
vided by this fee charged all the plays.
Canvas isn't cheap. Again, a spot
light had to be purchased; the in
creasing demands for "better plays"
made it necessary. A spot-light costs
a lot of money; anywhere from $85.00
to $125.00. Sword and Sandals bought
the spot-light, and yet Sword and
Sandals has never used that spot
light. in any of its plays. It has gone
for the use of operas, etc. Lights are
constantly disappearing from the
stage—we lock them up, but they get
broken, burnt out. some of them dis
appear, as do those in the library; at
any rate it is necessary to buy at
least three hundred new lamps a year,
together with a lot. of electrical ap
paratus to replace that used up.
Where is the money to come from, we
ask in all reason? These are but in
stances—there was the matter of a
ceiling for use in interior scenes—in
all the plays, mind you; that had to be
made by some one who knew the busi
ness. It cost about ninety dollars
when complete, with special pulleys,
etc., and not long ago it had to be
re-covered at an additional expense.
We could enumerate a lot more, but
space will permit only a mere men
tion of such things as replacing ropes.
They're from 75 to 100 feet long,

"Neutral," and have to be kept in good
condition to insure safety; tools, nails,
orchestra lights, a dozen odds and
ends that have to be kept on hand,
tlie building of the "practical" doors,
now used in most of the interior
scenes, all the replacement and im
provement that has to be made con
stantly. Funds must be provided
somewhere. Every cent that Sword
and Sandals collects goes right back
into that in equipment.
Now, why should Sword and San
dals be the ones who have charge of
this business?
Some one has to lie responsible, and
the Trustees MADE Sword and San
days responsible for the handling of
the stage when the equipment was
installed.
You know, "Neutral," what is every
body's business is nobody's business,
and stage equipment is not to be ne
glected, nor can it be handled by peo
ple who know nothing about it; who,
while eager and willing to see their
own show go through, are apt to hurt
somebody by pulling the wrong rope
and letting a heavy drop or a set of
scenery come crashing down on the
heads of those on stage. In all rea
son, we protest that a little skill
means more than a few dollars saved
in a case like this. Skill only comes
from practice in handling scenery.
Now as to the money paid the stage
hands. We want to say right here
that if there is any man in the Uni
versity willing to place himself at the
disposal of the stage manager, to go
down there to a dark, dusty basement,
and sort out scenery, carry it to the
Assembly Hall, empty and cold, with
out the glamour of lights and the ex
citement attending a play on the night
of performance, to go down there for
three or four scene rehearsals at
night, and a few other unattractive
things, and do it for nothing, let him
step up, and he can have the job for
the asking. Hut remember this, you
can't risk putting a bunch of green
horns on the stage to handle scenery
on the night of a play without run
ning the risk of getting someone hurt
through the simple ignorance of an
enthusiastic rope-puller. You have
got to keep men on the crew as long
as possible to secure efficiency and
safety. One thing more, the men who
i have worked on the stage crew have

practice can't be too freely followed
without defating the whole scheme.
Is twenty-five dollars too much?
Let us give you an idea of what is
done with that money. A couple of
years ago the curtain got out of order.
Several willing and enthusiastic
workers here endeavored to fix it, but
it wouldn't "fix;" they didn't under
stand the thing. A man had to be
brought from the city to fix it. Cost
about twenty dollars. For this last
show the curtain bad to be fixed
again; this time, fortunately, we were
able to do it ourselves, but a man
spent a whole afternoon, slung by a
rope from the gridiron, to do it.
Again, there is on the floor of the
stage, a large canvas cloth, known as
a "floor cloth." to deaden footstep 3,
etc. For several years we have
patched and coaxed that, thing to
make it last a little longer, but finally
a girl tripped over one of the rips in
it, and sprained her ankle. A new
floor cloth had to be bought. All the
plays benefit equally from the use of
it —where was the money to come
from to pay for it? Sword and San
days bought it with the funds pro
vided by this fee charged all the plays.
Canvas isn't cheap. Again, a spot
light had to be purchased; the in
creasing demands for "better plays"
made it necessary. A spot-light costs
a lot of money; anywhere from $85.00
to $125.00. Sword and Sandals bought
the spot-light, and yet Sword and
Sandals has never used that spot
light. in any of its plays. It has gone
for the use of operas, etc. Lights are
constantly disappearing from the
stage—we lock them up, but they get
broken, burnt out. some of them dis
appear, as do those in the library; at
any rate it is necessary to buy at
least three hundred new lamps a year,
together with a lot. of electrical ap
paratus to replace that used up.
Where is the money to come from, we
ask in all reason? These are but in
stances—there was the matter of a
ceiling for use in interior scenes—in
all the plays, mind you; that had to be
made by some one who knew the busi
ness. It cost about ninety dollars
when complete, with special pulleys,
etc., and not long ago it had to be
re-covered at an additional expense.
We could enumerate a lot more, but
space will permit only a mere men
tion of such things as replacing ropes.
They're from 75 to 100 feet long,

"Neutral," and have to be kept in good
condition to insure safety; tools, nails,
orchestra lights, a dozen odds and
ends that have to be kept on hand,
tlie building of the "practical" doors,
now used in most of the interior
scenes, all the replacement and im
provement that has to be made con
stantly. Funds must be provided
somewhere. Every cent that Sword
and Sandals collects goes right back
into that in equipment.
Now, why should Sword and San
dals be the ones who have charge of
this business?
Some one has to lie responsible, and
the Trustees MADE Sword and San
days responsible for the handling of
the stage when the equipment was
installed.
You know, "Neutral," what is every
body's business is nobody's business,
and stage equipment is not to be ne
glected, nor can it be handled by peo
ple who know nothing about it; who,
while eager and willing to see their
own show go through, are apt to hurt
somebody by pulling the wrong rope
and letting a heavy drop or a set of
scenery come crashing down on the
heads of those on stage. In all rea
son, we protest that a little skill
means more than a few dollars saved
in a case like this. Skill only comes
from practice in handling scenery.
Now as to the money paid the stage
hands. We want to say right here
that if there is any man in the Uni
versity willing to place himself at the
disposal of the stage manager, to go
down there to a dark, dusty basement,
and sort out scenery, carry it to the
Assembly Hall, empty and cold, with
out the glamour of lights and the ex
citement attending a play on the night
of performance, to go down there for
three or four scene rehearsals at
night, and a few other unattractive
things, and do it for nothing, let him
step up, and he can have the job for
the asking. Hut remember this, you
can't risk putting a bunch of green
horns on the stage to handle scenery
on the night of a play without run
ning the risk of getting someone hurt
through the simple ignorance of an
enthusiastic rope-puller. You have
got to keep men on the crew as long
as possible to secure efficiency and
safety. One thing more, the men who
i have worked on the stage crew have
always been men who needed *the
money. They are paid twenty-five
cents an hour, surely not an exorbi
tant rate, is it "Neutral?"
"Neutral" suggests lowering prices.
Let's have a look at that. Masquers
thought that was the remedy, and put
on an attraction last year and charged
twenty-five cents admission. No more
people came out to that, show than
came to the last Masquer plays. The
point is that there is a certain num
ber on which you can depend for
dramatics here, at the regular scale
of prices; that has been proved more
times than one.
As to going to the city to see pro
fessional plays. We are not com
peting with professionals, to begin
with. We never hope to keep at home
those who seek plays appearing in the
city. Besides, it is stretching things
somewhat to say the trip to the city
can be made "For the same expendi
ture or less.'" Let us keep within rea
son, "Neutral."
We are ready to stand back of any
feasible plan to improve conditions in
dramatics—but we insist that there
must be some one responsible—some
one to attend to things all tlie fime,
and it is obvious that the fewer peo
ple you spread that responsibility
among, the better it is going to be for
all concerned. Ask your Economics
professor or some of these efficiency
engineers about it. And more than
that, it has got to be some permanent
organization. Heretofore, the business
office has held Sword and Sandals
strictly accountable for the conduct of
the stage. Anything that is broken.
Sword and Sandals pays for. The
business office has been satisfied with
their work—can you suggest some
thing better?

To the Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
Not to prolong a somewhat tedious
discussion, but to prevent any miscon
ception as to the truth regarding the
dramatic situation, which might arise
from a perusal of "Neutral's" com
munication of Thursday last, we sub
mit the following facts, with as few
opinions, as possible. "Neutral's"
honesty of opinion is not doubted.
The opinion is, however, inexact, to
say the least.
"Paper" is NOT, and never has
been, given out to fill houses, make
friends, or for any purpose, as one
would infer from "Neutral's" letter.
There has never been a single college
performance called off on account of
"110 seat sale." The only time that
has ever been done, was for Mme.
La Gai, a professional performance.
What have dramatic conditions at
Stanford to do with that?
As to the use of "complimentary"
tickets. There is the usual "comp"
list, which is the same for all per
formances. "Comps" are issued by
the manager of seat sales, (who since
last semester is a representative of
the business office, and who formerly
was appointed by the graduate man
ager), to the honorary officers of ths
Student Body, the press, and to such
business firms as the chairman of trie
committee approves, i.e., firms that
have loaned furniture, etc. NOT
ONCE, IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS
AT LEAST, HAVE "COMPS" BEEN
GIVEN TO FILL THE HOUSE.
These are facts, not opinions. In the
Sword and Sandals productions,
neither the members of the cast nor
of the society receive tickets, nor are
tickets even drawn out in advance of
the scat sale. Other organizations do
as they see fit in this matter, but the
same custom is usually followed.
Now, just a word about these so
called "stage rights." "Neutral" Is
evidently referring to the fact that
Sword and Sandals stages the plays,
and charges a fee of twenty-five dol
lars for the use of stage equipment.
There has always been a deal of mis
understanding about that matter and
we want to take this opportunity to
explain it, believing that w r hen the
facts are known every one who is
willing to take a reasonable view of
the matter will be satisfied that it is
proper.
A few years ago there was absolute
ly nothing on the Assembly Hall stage
but four brick walls, a colored glass
dome overhead, and a curtain that
was an insult to the eyes. Sword and
Sandals petitioned the trustees, time
after time, to secure the bare essen
tials for producing plays, and finally
secured permission to install on the
stage AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE,
the necessary apparatus. They hesi
tated to incur the expense, but finally
went ahead and did so. Unfortunate
ly most of the receipts and vouchers
for that work have been lost during
the several college generations which
have passed since then, but we have
a few of them, those covering part of
the electrical work. The three bor
der lights, two bunch lights, with the
| necessary cables, cost $186.80. That
is a mere beginning on what was put
in there. Tt leaves out of account the
installation of floor sockets, foot
lights, a switchboard, the building of
the gridiron to carry the drops and
borders overhead, the purchase of a
floor-cloth, and last, but not least,
a new curtain, You didn't know, per
haps, that Sword and Sandals sup
plied the Assembly Hall with the cur
tain now in there? It cost close to
six hundred dollars. Figure it up for
yourself. The work had to be done
by expert theatrical mechanics; the
trustees insisted that everything be
done absolutely right, to secure safe
ty from fire and breakage. The mean
est estimate you can make 011 the
work if you take the trouble to in
quire into the cost of such things, car-
ries it well over fifteeu hundred dol
lars.
The present footlights and the ex
cellent switchboard now in the hall
were installed by the business office.
Every stick and rope on that stage,
as well as the curtain, was placed
there and paid for by Sword and San
dals. Where did they get the money?
We understand they borrowed it and
trusted to future plays to enable them
to make good on the loan.
So much for the original equip
ment. That didn't solve the problem
entirely. Some provision had to bo
made for keeping up the equipment
once it was installed. Where was
that money to come from? We leave
it to you "Neutral," as a reasonable
man, (or is it woman?), should not
all the plays contribute to support
that equipment, to provide for its re
newal and improvement as necessary?
J Would it be fair to say to Sword and
Sandals, after installing it at their
own expense, "Good work, keep it up
now, but we all want to use it just
as much as you do?" We think not.
| All the organizations who use the
I equipment should help pay for its up
j keep and improvement. How is that
: to be accomplished but by charging
i each play a fixed sum for that pur
pose? That is what has been done,
and this charge of twenty-five dol
lars has been made for that purpose.
There have been times, when plays
have failed financially, that this has
not been collected, but obviously that
practice can't be too freely followed
without defating the whole scheme.
Is twenty-five dollars too much?
Let us give you an idea of what is

There has never been a single college
performance called off on account of
"110 seat sale." The only time that
has ever been done, was for Mme.
La Gai, a professional performance.
What have dramatic conditions at
Stanford to do with that?
As to the use of "complimentary"
tickets. There is the usual "comp"
list, which is the same for all per
formances. "Comps" are issued by
the manager of seat sales, (who since
last semester is a representative of
the business office, and who formerly
was appointed by the graduate man
ager), to the honorary officers of ths
Student Body, the press, and to such
business firms as the chairman of trie
committee approves, i.e., firms that
have loaned furniture, etc. NOT
ONCE, IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS
AT LEAST, HAVE "COMPS" BEEN
GIVEN TO FILL THE HOUSE.
These are facts, not opinions. In the
Sword and Sandals productions,
neither the members of the cast nor
of the society receive tickets, nor are
tickets even drawn out in advance of
the scat sale. Other organizations do
as they see fit in this matter, but the
same custom is usually followed.
Now, just a word about these so
called "stage rights." "Neutral" Is
evidently referring to the fact that
Sword and Sandals stages the plays,
and charges a fee of twenty-five dol
lars for the use of stage equipment.
There has always been a deal of mis
understanding about that matter and
we want to take this opportunity to
explain it, believing that w r hen the
facts are known every one who is
willing to take a reasonable view of
the matter will be satisfied that it is
proper.
A few years ago there was absolute
ly nothing on the Assembly Hall stage
but four brick walls, a colored glass
dome overhead, and a curtain that
was an insult to the eyes. Sword and
Sandals petitioned the trustees, time
after time, to secure the bare essen
tials for producing plays, and finally
secured permission to install on the
stage AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE,
the necessary apparatus. They hesi
tated to incur the expense, but finally
went ahead and did so. Unfortunate
ly most of the receipts and vouchers
for that work have been lost during
the several college generations which
have passed since then, but we have
a few of them, those covering part of
the electrical work. The three bor
der lights, two bunch lights, with the
| necessary cables, cost $186.80. That
is a mere beginning on what was put
in there. Tt leaves out of account the
installation of floor sockets, foot
lights, a switchboard, the building of
the gridiron to carry the drops and
borders overhead, the purchase of a
floor-cloth, and last, but not least,
a new curtain, You didn't know, per
haps, that Sword and Sandals sup
plied the Assembly Hall with the cur
tain now in there? It cost close to
six hundred dollars. Figure it up for
yourself. The work had to be done
by expert theatrical mechanics; the
trustees insisted that everything be
done absolutely right, to secure safe
ty from fire and breakage. The mean
est estimate you can make 011 the
work if you take the trouble to in
quire into the cost of such things, car-
ries it well over fifteeu hundred dol
lars.
The present footlights and the ex
cellent switchboard now in the hall
were installed by the business office.
Every stick and rope on that stage,
as well as the curtain, was placed
there and paid for by Sword and San
dals. Where did they get the money?
We understand they borrowed it and
trusted to future plays to enable them
to make good on the loan.
So much for the original equip
ment. That didn't solve the problem
entirely. Some provision had to bo
made for keeping up the equipment
once it was installed. Where was
that money to come from? We leave
it to you "Neutral," as a reasonable
man, (or is it woman?), should not
all the plays contribute to support
that equipment, to provide for its re
newal and improvement as necessary?
J Would it be fair to say to Sword and
Sandals, after installing it at their
own expense, "Good work, keep it up
now, but we all want to use it just
as much as you do?" We think not.
| All the organizations who use the
I equipment should help pay for its up
j keep and improvement. How is that
: to be accomplished but by charging
i each play a fixed sum for that pur
pose? That is what has been done,
and this charge of twenty-five dol
lars has been made for that purpose.
There have been times, when plays
have failed financially, that this has
not been collected, but obviously that
practice can't be too freely followed
without defating the whole scheme.
Is twenty-five dollars too much?
Let us give you an idea of what is
done with that money. A couple of
years ago the curtain got out of order.
Several willing and enthusiastic
workers here endeavored to fix it, but
it wouldn't "fix;" they didn't under
stand the thing. A man had to be
brought from the city to fix it. Cost
about twenty dollars. For this last
show the curtain bad to be fixed
again; this time, fortunately, we were
able to do it ourselves, but a man
spent a whole afternoon, slung by a
rope from the gridiron, to do it.
Again, there is on the floor of the
stage, a large canvas cloth, known as
a "floor cloth." to deaden footstep 3,
etc. For several years we have
patched and coaxed that, thing to
make it last a little longer, but finally
a girl tripped over one of the rips in
it, and sprained her ankle. A new
floor cloth had to be bought. All the
plays benefit equally from the use of
it —where was the money to come
from to pay for it? Sword and San
days bought it with the funds pro
vided by this fee charged all the plays.
Canvas isn't cheap. Again, a spot
light had to be purchased; the in
creasing demands for "better plays"
made it necessary. A spot-light costs
a lot of money; anywhere from $85.00
to $125.00. Sword and Sandals bought
the spot-light, and yet Sword and
Sandals has never used that spot
light. in any of its plays. It has gone
for the use of operas, etc. Lights are
constantly disappearing from the
stage—we lock them up, but they get
broken, burnt out. some of them dis
appear, as do those in the library; at
any rate it is necessary to buy at
least three hundred new lamps a year,
together with a lot. of electrical ap
paratus to replace that used up.
Where is the money to come from, we
ask in all reason? These are but in
stances—there was the matter of a
ceiling for use in interior scenes—in
all the plays, mind you; that had to be
made by some one who knew the busi
ness. It cost about ninety dollars
when complete, with special pulleys,
etc., and not long ago it had to be
re-covered at an additional expense.
We could enumerate a lot more, but
space will permit only a mere men
tion of such things as replacing ropes.
They're from 75 to 100 feet long,

"Neutral," and have to be kept in good
condition to insure safety; tools, nails,
orchestra lights, a dozen odds and
ends that have to be kept on hand,
tlie building of the "practical" doors,
now used in most of the interior
scenes, all the replacement and im
provement that has to be made con
stantly. Funds must be provided
somewhere. Every cent that Sword
and Sandals collects goes right back
into that in equipment.
Now, why should Sword and San
dals be the ones who have charge of
this business?
Some one has to lie responsible, and
the Trustees MADE Sword and San
days responsible for the handling of
the stage when the equipment was
installed.
You know, "Neutral," what is every
body's business is nobody's business,
and stage equipment is not to be ne
glected, nor can it be handled by peo
ple who know nothing about it; who,
while eager and willing to see their
own show go through, are apt to hurt
somebody by pulling the wrong rope
and letting a heavy drop or a set of
scenery come crashing down on the
heads of those on stage. In all rea
son, we protest that a little skill
means more than a few dollars saved
in a case like this. Skill only comes
from practice in handling scenery.
Now as to the money paid the stage
hands. We want to say right here
that if there is any man in the Uni
versity willing to place himself at the
disposal of the stage manager, to go
down there to a dark, dusty basement,
and sort out scenery, carry it to the
Assembly Hall, empty and cold, with
out the glamour of lights and the ex
citement attending a play on the night
of performance, to go down there for
three or four scene rehearsals at
night, and a few other unattractive
things, and do it for nothing, let him
step up, and he can have the job for
the asking. Hut remember this, you
can't risk putting a bunch of green
horns on the stage to handle scenery
on the night of a play without run
ning the risk of getting someone hurt
through the simple ignorance of an
enthusiastic rope-puller. You have
got to keep men on the crew as long
as possible to secure efficiency and
safety. One thing more, the men who
i have worked on the stage crew have
always been men who needed *the
money. They are paid twenty-five
cents an hour, surely not an exorbi
tant rate, is it "Neutral?"
"Neutral" suggests lowering prices.
Let's have a look at that. Masquers
thought that was the remedy, and put
on an attraction last year and charged
twenty-five cents admission. No more
people came out to that, show than
came to the last Masquer plays. The
point is that there is a certain num
ber on which you can depend for
dramatics here, at the regular scale
of prices; that has been proved more
times than one.
As to going to the city to see pro
fessional plays. We are not com
peting with professionals, to begin
with. We never hope to keep at home
those who seek plays appearing in the
city. Besides, it is stretching things
somewhat to say the trip to the city
can be made "For the same expendi
ture or less.'" Let us keep within rea
son, "Neutral."
We are ready to stand back of any
feasible plan to improve conditions in
dramatics—but we insist that there
must be some one responsible—some
one to attend to things all tlie fime,
and it is obvious that the fewer peo
ple you spread that responsibility
among, the better it is going to be for
all concerned. Ask your Economics
professor or some of these efficiency
engineers about it. And more than
that, it has got to be some permanent
organization. Heretofore, the business
office has held Sword and Sandals
strictly accountable for the conduct of
the stage. Anything that is broken.
Sword and Sandals pays for. The
business office has been satisfied with
their work—can you suggest some
thing better?
