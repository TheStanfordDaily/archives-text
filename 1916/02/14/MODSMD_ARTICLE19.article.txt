To the Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
Not to prolong a somewhat tedious
discussion, but to prevent any miscon
ception as to the truth regarding the
dramatic situation, which might arise
from a perusal of "Neutral's" com
munication of Thursday last, we sub
mit the following facts, with as few
opinions, as possible. "Neutral's"
honesty of opinion is not doubted.
The opinion is, however, inexact, to
say the least.
"Paper" is NOT, and never has
been, given out to fill houses, make
friends, or for any purpose, as one
would infer from "Neutral's" letter.
There has never been a single college
performance called off on account of
"110 seat sale." The only time that
has ever been done, was for Mme.
La Gai, a professional performance.
What have dramatic conditions at
Stanford to do with that?
As to the use of "complimentary"
tickets. There is the usual "comp"
list, which is the same for all per
formances. "Comps" are issued by
the manager of seat sales, (who since
last semester is a representative of
the business office, and who formerly
was appointed by the graduate man
ager), to the honorary officers of ths
Student Body, the press, and to such
business firms as the chairman of trie
committee approves, i.e., firms that
have loaned furniture, etc. NOT
ONCE, IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS
AT LEAST, HAVE "COMPS" BEEN
GIVEN TO FILL THE HOUSE.
These are facts, not opinions. In the
Sword and Sandals productions,
neither the members of the cast nor
of the society receive tickets, nor are
tickets even drawn out in advance of
the scat sale. Other organizations do
as they see fit in this matter, but the
same custom is usually followed.
Now, just a word about these so
called "stage rights." "Neutral" Is
evidently referring to the fact that
Sword and Sandals stages the plays,
and charges a fee of twenty-five dol
lars for the use of stage equipment.
There has always been a deal of mis
understanding about that matter and
we want to take this opportunity to
explain it, believing that w r hen the
facts are known every one who is
willing to take a reasonable view of
the matter will be satisfied that it is
proper.
A few years ago there was absolute
ly nothing on the Assembly Hall stage
but four brick walls, a colored glass
dome overhead, and a curtain that
was an insult to the eyes. Sword and
Sandals petitioned the trustees, time
after time, to secure the bare essen
tials for producing plays, and finally
secured permission to install on the
stage AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE,
the necessary apparatus. They hesi
tated to incur the expense, but finally
went ahead and did so. Unfortunate
ly most of the receipts and vouchers
for that work have been lost during
the several college generations which
have passed since then, but we have
a few of them, those covering part of
the electrical work. The three bor
der lights, two bunch lights, with the
| necessary cables, cost $186.80. That
is a mere beginning on what was put
in there. Tt leaves out of account the
installation of floor sockets, foot
lights, a switchboard, the building of
the gridiron to carry the drops and
borders overhead, the purchase of a
floor-cloth, and last, but not least,
a new curtain, You didn't know, per
haps, that Sword and Sandals sup
plied the Assembly Hall with the cur
tain now in there? It cost close to
six hundred dollars. Figure it up for
yourself. The work had to be done
by expert theatrical mechanics; the
trustees insisted that everything be
done absolutely right, to secure safe
ty from fire and breakage. The mean
est estimate you can make 011 the
work if you take the trouble to in
quire into the cost of such things, car-
