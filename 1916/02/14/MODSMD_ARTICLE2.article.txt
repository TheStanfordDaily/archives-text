# Stanford Eleven Takes Defeat of 9 to 1 From All-Star Soccerites
## 
### 
Although decidedly one-sided, a
good exhibition of all-star soccer play
ing was staged on the turf field, Sat
urday afternoon, when Bill Campbell's
picked team from the San Francisco
leagues, walked over the Stanford
varsity to the tune of a 9 to 1 score.
The game was a case of the winning
team having too much polish and in
dividual brilliancy, but the Cardinal
men did not go down without a good
fight.
After a kick off by the Stars and a
dribbling rush toward the Stanford
goal, Hudson received from Pike and
made the first try for the club men,
which was diverted by Ring, the Card
inal net guard. The play then shifted
to the opposite end of the field, where
Danny Carroll tried for a score from
a difficult angle. From then on the
play was in the Stanford team s terri
tory most of the time, the score being
4 to 1 at the end of the half.
In the second half the Cardinal de
fense weakened and allowed the Stars
to tally five times. The absence of
the work of ex-Captain Blodget, in the
forward division, and of Dutton, on
defense, was keenly felt. Ring stop
ped a number of fast ones, but after
the ball had been centered it was
taken out of the scrimmage with
seeming ease by Pike and Priest, and
sneaked past him into a corner of
the net. The lineup follows:
Stanford —Ring, goal; Eyer, right
full; Ketchum, left full; McClung,
right half; Reynolds, center half;
Williams, left half; Carroll, outside
right; Henderson, inside right; Boyle,
center; Erb, inside left; X. K. Ford,
outside left.
All-Stars —Crowley (Hums"), goal;
Simpson (Olympics), right full; Ties
lauck (Argonauts'), left full; Mcintosh
(S. F.), right half; Teed (S. F.), cen
ter half; Hughes (Barbs.), left half;
Walters (S. F.). outside right; Priest
(S. F.), inside right; Hudson (Barbs.),
center; Bike (Burns), inside left:
Marsh (S. F.), outside left.
