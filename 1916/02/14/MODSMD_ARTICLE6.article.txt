# VOLUMES ON PRINTING ADDITIONS TO LIBRARY
## 
### 
Four volumes on printing and book
binding are new acquisitions for the
Stanford library. John J. Pleger is
the author, and he takes up the sub
ject especially in its modern relations
to newly invented machinery. Recent
development in the mechanical appli
ances now used in this trade, he says,
demand special study on the part of
those who intend entering it.
Of interest to economics students is
a four-volume, unrevised record, taken
verbatim, of the New York state con
stitutional convention, which met at
Albany, last spring. The record fills
I.r.TS pages, and is complete in every
detail. The constitution approved by
the convention was later turned down
by the people, though highly com
mended by many statesmen of the
day.
