# Northern Crew Regatta to Be Held on April Eighth
## 
### 
As a result of communications be
tween CJraduate Manager Behrens and
the University of Washington, the
date of the northern crew race be
tween Washington and Stanford will
be held on Lake Washington, Seattle,
April 8. This was the tentative date
proposed some time ago, but has not
been definitely decided and has kept
a number of other important Stanford
athletic dates pending.
Now that the northern date is set
tled, it is a certainty that the first
baseball game between Stanford and
California will be on April 8, the same
time as the crew race. The California-
Stanford Rig Meet will be on April
15, with the second baseball game in
the morning. Roth events will be
staged on home grounds. The Stan
ford-California crew regatta on Oak
land estuary will be one week after
the Itig Meet, April 22, and if there 1
is a third game in the baseball series
it will lie played on this date at Cali
fornia.
