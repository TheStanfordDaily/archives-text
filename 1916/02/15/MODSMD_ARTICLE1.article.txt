# VARSITY MEETS AGGIES IN GYM TOMORROW NIGHT
## VISITORS HAVE STRONG FIVE Cardinal Quintet in Good Shape For Clash With the Oregonians 
### 
When the varsity meets the Oregon
Agricultural College five, tomorrow
night, at the gymnasium, they will
stack up against one of the best quin
tets on the Pacific Coast. O. A. C.
has gone through the present season
with only one defeat, and are at pres
ent tied with California for first place
in the Pacific Coast Conference race.
When the Washington team came
down here it looked as if it would be
a contender for championship honors
but it failed to survive the attack of
the O. A. C. and California basket
tossers so that Stanford has a big job
on her hands for the remainder of the
schedule.
Freshmen Meet Keystone Club.
In the preliminary game the fresh
men will meet the fast Keystone Club
of San Jose. This team defeated the
freshmen earlier in the season, but the
nineteeners have been so strengthened
since that a close contest should re
sult.
It would seem, from the Santa Clara
game, that the varsity was not in the
best of shape for tomorrow night's
contest. However, this is said to have
been the best preliminary game the
Cardinal have had.
Varsity Now lii Shape.
Wheatly went almost from crutches
to his position, and Wallace, who sub-
bed for him, was not in shape to enter
the game. Now these men are in con
dition to buck up against the best of
them. Worthy has been a little out
of form for some time, but tomorrow
night will be ready to play his old
game with Blodget at forward. Dolan
and Caughey are both putting up good
games at guard and should stop the
rush of the northern forwards.
As this is an inter-state game sea
son tickets will not admit. The ad
mission will be twenty-five cents. This
will probably be the best game of the
season and all should turn out to sup
port the Cardinal. The women of the
University will be admitted and their
presence is desired.
