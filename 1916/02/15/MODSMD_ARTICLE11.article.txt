# Organizing Forâ€”?

lo how many campus organizations
do you belong? In how many of them
are you active?
There is a tendency at Stanford,
whenever anything is to be done, to
organize something or other to put
it over. The mere fact that two or
three bodies already exist for the same
purpose is the least deterrant of the
organizers. The action is taken with
out any regard on the part of the
interested ones to the time which will
be needed to make the organiaztion
active.
A week later they wake up to the
fact that they cannot devote the neces
sary attention to it and another dead
organization has to be added to the
list of campus societies or commit
tees. The fact that it may be an
"honor" to belong to the organization
or that a few people keep their inter
est and do some work keeps it from
going by the boards, as it would do
for all that it accomplished.
Live organizations are necessary.
There are many different activities 011
the campus, and the best way to get
the most out of any of them is for
the people interested to be banded to
gether. But efficiency demands reason
in organization. Best results with
very few exceptions will be obtained
when all the people working towards
a certain end are working together
and not in two or three different bod
ies. Also better results can be had
when each member of an organization
is active and there are no inactive
members to be dragged along. What
are you going to do about that so
ciety which you never attend or never
accomplishes anything when you do
attend?
