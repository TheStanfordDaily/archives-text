Honoruble and Referenced Editor:
My pesky wife she recently take okas
sion to go thru honorable standforit
college on cooks tour with other sec
ond-hand girls and kitchen chaufers
from this dear city. Thereby my
heartfelt interest awakens for welfare
of your mussupipality. I ready Daily
Palo Alto with much sympathy. Why
for alltime have big scrap. I see let
ter to honoruble and referenced editor
under which hide sentimental feeling
like to jooey-jitso each other brother
stude. Why for? Have damatic pre
dicament appendicitis or liver trouble?
Maybe only bad sneeze in head. I
read with feeling of nauseation (so
say Prof. Webster) that college public
fail to fill-up empty seat in tabernacle
when show company give big league
Shakespook offering. I listen to same
crab reference not long back to foren
sick activity. Why for crab (question
mark) College is place for hominy, not
entirely alone in gleeful club but on
every street and alley. Strive for
hominy, 1 say. Here in my city Nip
pon Legue give play every Sat. and
get full house. Why for you crab?
For further particulars, write or wire,
Conclusively yours,
ARCHIE KIGGAGAMMA, ex-'lfi
