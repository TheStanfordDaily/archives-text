"Fat" Rehm's Blues went down to
defeat before the onslaught of "Brud''
Hastings Blacks in a five-inning game
on the faculty diamond, yesterday af
ternoon. At the end of the fourth
inning the Blues had a 1-0 lead over
their opponents, when Parthum of the
Blacks knocked out a three-bagger,
bringing in a man, and scoring himself
a few minutes later. The close of the
game found the Blacks leading by a
2-1 score. Batteries for the game were,
Blacks, McC'ormick and Hurley; Blues,
Cullen and Rehm.

Four innings of well played base
ball resulted in a 1 to 0 victory for
the Reds over the Blacks, Friday
night. The pitching of Draper and
Wright was the outstanding feature of
the game, one lone hit being gleaned
off Draper and none off Wright. Var
sity Captain "Babe" Dent was on hand
dnring the major part of the game, is
suing good advice to the players. The
batteries for the Reds were Draper
and Fields; for the Blacks, Wright
and Hurley.

Standing up at the first of the sev
enth inning when the local team is be
hind, is a custom that is followed in
all baseball towns. It is surely a good
one as the players feel the added en
thusiasm and give all they have. Who
knows but what the Cardinals' three
tallies in this frame, Saturday, were
not due directly to this.

Stanford is still keeping up her hit
ting. Eight bingles were gathered in
Saturday's contest, above the average
pro rata. The team as a whole is hit
ting much better this season than in
the past few years. With the rough
edges brushed off, they should play
good ball.

Stanford's crack freshmen baseball
team was unable to start the sched
was announced. The Manzanita High
school squad failed to putin an ap
pearance in the morning, and so the
first year contingent bad to be satis
fied with a good workout.

Phil Tvvohy's Whites and "Dit"
Hayes' Reds, present league leaders
in the Peanut struggle, played a 2 to
2 tie game last night in the opening
struggle of the third series. Draper,
on the mound for the Reds, was in
great shape, allowing only two hits,
both of these being secured by Garret,
and striking out eleven of the twenty
one men at bat. For the Whites,
Hawk's catching was a feature, as he
pegged out several would-be base-pil
ferers, and had the Reds scared to try
steals during the remainder of the
game. These two teams will battle
again tonight on auxiliary field. The
batteries for the Reds were Draper
and Field; for the Whites. Fabling
and Hawks.
