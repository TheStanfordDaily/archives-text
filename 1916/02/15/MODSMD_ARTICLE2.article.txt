### 
Miss Bertha Conde spoke yesterday
afternoon in the Clubhouse on the
subject of women in their relation to
the women's movement of today. The
talk was a broad, interesting one, and
showed the thorough and thoughtful
knowledge of her subject for which
she is well known.
According to Miss Conde, the
women's movement, which has been
sweeping the country, has lately been
submerged by the recent war, with
the result that women are now bear
ing all the manual work of Europe,
especially in the making of munitions.
In relation to our present day sit
uation, Miss Conde said, in part:
"Running parallel to changes in
women's position in society, are
changes in thought which are calling
for leadership. This is the keynote
of the modern demand, and it is for
America, and particularly the women
of America, to prepare themselves to
meet this demand, not only in the
present, but in the future, when the
war is over and the European coun
tries are in need of reconstruction.
This burden will fall upon the United
States, and it is in this respect that
Christianity, and Christian associa
tions, may wield their power, for
Christianity alone offers the power of
meeting a demand which must take
into account not only the conditions of
society as a unit, but of society as an
individual with human characterist
ics."
