# Upper class Jolly-Up to Be Pace-Setter
## Senior-Junior Function February 21 Will Be Memorable Date for Everybody 
### 
Big news for "jolly-upers."
There will be no assessment of class
dues at the upperclass jolly-up.
This little item of news is only a
drop in the bucket of big features that
will make the function an event never
to be forgotten. February 21 will de
serve a double page in every memory
book, and a double compartment in
every brain for time immemorial.
Committeemen announce that a real
vaudeville program of real stunts will
while away the time 'tween rounds of
terpsichorean pleasure.
Transportation will be provided for
every woman in the University. Tick
ets will not be required to get on the
jolly-up wagon.
Encina is the placeâ€”the night be
fore George's birthday, the time.
