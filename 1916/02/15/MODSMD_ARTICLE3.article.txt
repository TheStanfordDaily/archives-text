# AMBROSE TAILORS ARE BOOKED FOR GAME TOMORROW
## Fast Semi-Professional Nine Is Composed of Stars From Bay Cities 
### 
Ambrose Tailors versus Stanford
varsity will be the mid-week baseball
attraction for the local fans tomorrow
afternoon on the varsity diamond.
Jack McCarthy has again been ob
tained by Graduate Manager Behrens
to handle the indicator, and he will
start the game promptly at 4:15. Sea
son tickets or twenty-five cents will
give gate passage.
The visiting team is a semi-profes
sional aggregation hailing from San
Francisco. They have been very suc
cessful this season, winning many
games around the bay regions. Dope
sters who have seen them play, assert
that they will furnish excellent com
petition for the Cardinal varsity. Their
lineup could not be obtained today, but
a number of ex-Coast Leaguers and
semi-pro. stars played for them on
their last appearance.
Coach Harry Wolter has given the
Stanford ball tossers hard workouts
in the last two days, and he figures
that the boys should make a much
better showing than they did against
the "Winged O" aggregation. "Gus"
Hoever will in all probability do the
twirling, with Captain "Babe" Dent on
the receiving end. "Doc" Hayes will
hold down first, "Wabbles" Stafford
and "Mush" Stevens will cover second
and third respectively, while Dickey
will cavort in the short field. The out
field berths will be filled by Sanborn,
Lander, Braden, and Noonan.
During the varsity game,, the fresh
men will take on the Palo Alto High
school team for their first game of the
season. The battle will be staged on
either the auxiliary field or on the
high school diamond in Palo Alto.
The first year contingent will line up
as follows: Peterson, p.; E. Mitchell,
c.; Mitchell, lb; Messick, 2b; Shriver,
3b; Cowan, ss.; Ryan, If.; Lilly, cf.;
Reagon, rf.
