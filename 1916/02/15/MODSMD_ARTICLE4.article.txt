# New Minerals Are Received by the Geology Department
## 
### 
Several gifts of unusual value have
been presented to the Department of
Geology and Mining since the close of
the Panama-Pacific International Ex
position, notedly among which are the
tin ores presented by the Bolivian
government through their commis
sioner, Dr. Otto Buchstein. The Boliv
ian government had a fine collection
at the fair, and it was due in part
to Dr. Buchstein's personal efforts
that a portion of the collection was
given to Stanford and the University
of California. Other valuable collect
ions have come from state exhibits
and private collections. These, in
general, include materials that can
be used in the Mineralogical labratory
for blow-pipe and testing work, and
material for the laboratory of Eco
nomic Geology, where it is made up
into study collections. Material has
been received that is suitable for show
purposes in the main museum. A
considerable amount of interesting
material will be deposited in a mus
eum of Economic Geology should a
place lie provided for such a museum.
Other collections from the Eair fol
low: Australian ores, Nevada and
Idaho ores and Alaskan specimens
from the Copper Uiver district. Dis
play ores from Japan, Missouri min
erals. and small collections from the
State Mining Bureau of California.
