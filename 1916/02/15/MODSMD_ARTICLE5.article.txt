two weeks from next Friday. Owing
to a sincere wish to see dramatics
again attain the high standard and se
cure position once hold on the Stan
ford stage, English Club has per
suaded Owens to assist in this pre
sentation, which promises to be the
most brilliant and professional per
formance yet known to the local
boards.
Exceptional Production Promised.
English Club will leave nothing un
done in the way of preparation, scen

ically and artistically, to make "The
Great Divide" a faithful reproduction
of Henry Miller and Margaret Anglin's
original New York triumph. With
this end in view they have selected a
cast of experienced players to inter
pret the varied roles of William
Vaughn Moody's "great American

drama," thus insuring the greatest
possible artistic success. English
Club set a high standard last spring
in its big out-door production of
"Sherwood."' but promises to eclipse
all former efforts in"The Great Di
vide," a play of decidedly popular as
well as powerful appeal.
Artistic Scenes Pictured.
Scenically, the production will sur
pass any previous attempts on the
Stanford stage, but in spite of the
heavy expense of scenery and light

ing the regular scale of prices will
prevail. The second act, picturing
Stephen Ghent's cabin in the Cord
illeras, promises to create a marked
impression. The brink of a canyon,
witli its distant wall and upper
reaches crimsoned by the afternoon
light, forms the background for this

scene, which will present a setting of
rare beauty. The action of the play
culminates in a New England home,
which will lend itself readily to the
artistic stage-director, while the ear
lier scenes in the Arizona cabin will
be reproduced with Belasco-like atten
tion to detail.
Owens In Impressive Hole.
W. B. Owens' histrionic skill has
been demonstrated in a long series of
Stanford successes in addition to "The


Miss Elizabeth Taff


W. B. Owens


Miss Nellita Choate
Only Way." His most recent appear
ance was as "Paste," the leading role
in the 1914 Senior farce, "Our Wives."
"The Admirable Crichton" and "Ty
ranny of Tears" have also featured
Owens' talent. His role of "Stephen
Ghent" in"The Great Divide," will
afford him an opportunity for superb
acting, not even equalled by "Sydney
Carton." Henry Miller won enviable
laurels in this rewarding part, which
expresses every phase of human emo
tion, and Owens, promises to make a
profound impression.
.Miss Choate >Vill Star.
Miss Nellita Choate will interpret
the leading feminine role, opposite
Owens, as "Ruth Jordan,'' who typi
fies the refinement of the East as op
posed to the primitiveness of the
West, in "Stephen Ghent." Miss
Choate's many dramatic successes
have won her a secure position on the
Stanford stage. Few parts offer the
emotional opportunities afforded in
Margaret Anglin's former role, and
Miss Choate lends them a dramatic
power hitherto unknown to the local
boards. She made her debut as the
fiery "Miss Willoughby" in "Quality
Street," and the following semester
played a role of entirely different char
acter in the Sword and Sandals pro
| duction of "Men and Women." As the
: wicked "Queen Elinor" of the English
Club's out-door "Sherwood," last
spring, Miss Choate carried off the
stellar honors of the production, while
as the exotic Arabian maiden in
Strinberg's "Simoon" she demon
strated talents of professional calibre.
Her most recent appearance was in
the Masquers' Jinks last semester,
when she displayed surprising versa
tility as the pantomimic "Princess" in
"A Romance in Black and White."
Miss Tuff as Ingenue.
Miss Elizabeth Taff will revel in the
delightful ingenue role of "Polly Jor
dan," whom Laura Hope Crews por
trayed in the Miller-Anglin produc
tion, for her pert likeablcness and
Billie Burke contrast to the more ser
ious-minded "Ruth." As a portrayer
of spirited, girlish charm, Miss Taff
stands pre-eminent in the local dra
j mafic field, as anyone will witness
who saw her in "On the Quiet," or
"Quality Street." Her most recent
success was in Ibsen's "Pillars of So
ciety" last spring.
Phillips In Comedy Pole.
Another comedy character of ex
ceptional possibilities will lie played
by J. E. Phillips, who fits the part like
the proverbial glove, and who prom
ises to create a decided individual hit
as a venerable-looking miner. Phillips
will be remembered in a role of some
what similar type in"The Fortune
Hunter," as the cracker-box philoso
pher in the drug store.
Miss Edith Smith, whose stellar hit
as the indomitable "Aunt Selina," in
"Seven Days," last spring, is of recent
memory, will have an important role
as "Mrs. Jordan," a typical New
England mother.
Experienced Players Cast.
"Philip Jordan," Ruth's brother and
Polly's husband, is well adapted to the
temperament of .T. H. Russell, who has
distinguished himself in a variety of
roles in the productions of "Quality
Street," "Sherwood," and "Stop
Thief." H. A. Buffum will have a con
genial part as "Dr. Newbury," a dis
tinct New England type. Buffum has
had character experience in "Sher
wood" and "Bobby Burnit," but this
role is his best opportunity thus far.
J. C. Cross, '17, will play the sym
pathetic role of "Winthrop Newbury,"
whose New England polish affords a
marked contrast to the more rugged
"Ghent." Cross made his most re
cent appearance as the absent-minded
old man in "Stop Thief," last semester,
and has also had valuable experience

in "Quality Street," "Pillars of So
ciety," and "Ready Money."
The Mexican half-breed, "Shorty,"
will give almost unlimited acting
chances to J. A. Quinby, who promises
to sketch a greaser of terrible mien,
while B. B. Robinson as the ferocious
"Dutch," could scarcely be improved
upon in characterizing brutal strength.
Quinby scored a hit as the beggar,
"Glurry-Wurry," in the Masquers'
black and white pantomime last fall.
W. B .Curtis' and 11. M. Stanley will
lend their experience to the cast as
the contractor and architect, respect
ively. Curtis scored as the "Maker of
Sounds," in the Masquers' Jinks, last
semester, while Stanley has appeared
in the casts of "Ready Money," the
1915 Junior Opera, and "Sherwood."
L. L. Adamson and H. P. Smith, who
are new to the Stanford stage, will
make their initial appearances in two
youthful roles of real possibilities.
"The Great Divide" will be the only
big serious play of the year and Eng
lish Club promises to set a new dra
matic standard in both cast and pro
duction on the evening of March 3.
