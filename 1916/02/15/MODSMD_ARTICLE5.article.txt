two weeks from next Friday. Owing
to a sincere wish to see dramatics
again attain the high standard and se
cure position once hold on the Stan
ford stage, English Club has per
suaded Owens to assist in this pre
sentation, which promises to be the
most brilliant and professional per
formance yet known to the local
boards.
Exceptional Production Promised.
English Club will leave nothing un
done in the way of preparation, scen

ically and artistically, to make "The
Great Divide" a faithful reproduction
of Henry Miller and Margaret Anglin's
original New York triumph. With
this end in view they have selected a
cast of experienced players to inter
pret the varied roles of William
Vaughn Moody's "great American

drama," thus insuring the greatest
possible artistic success. English
Club set a high standard last spring
in its big out-door production of
"Sherwood."' but promises to eclipse
all former efforts in"The Great Di
vide," a play of decidedly popular as
well as powerful appeal.
Artistic Scenes Pictured.
Scenically, the production will sur
pass any previous attempts on the
Stanford stage, but in spite of the
heavy expense of scenery and light

ing the regular scale of prices will
prevail. The second act, picturing
Stephen Ghent's cabin in the Cord
illeras, promises to create a marked
impression. The brink of a canyon,
witli its distant wall and upper
reaches crimsoned by the afternoon
light, forms the background for this

scene, which will present a setting of
rare beauty. The action of the play
culminates in a New England home,
which will lend itself readily to the
artistic stage-director, while the ear
lier scenes in the Arizona cabin will
be reproduced with Belasco-like atten
tion to detail.
Owens In Impressive Hole.
W. B. Owens' histrionic skill has
been demonstrated in a long series of
Stanford successes in addition to "The
