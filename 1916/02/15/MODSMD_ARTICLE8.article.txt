take place this coming Saturday, Feb
ruary 19. The muddy water which
has been in the pool since the be
ginning of the rainy season has been
cleaned out and the tank is at present
tilled with the clear blue water which
is very suitable for swimming pur
poses. The number of entries in the
various events has almost doubled
during the past week, and indications
point to a very full list for every race.
It is probable that a few local records
will be shattered in the short dis
tances. The number of entries in
these events are principally first year
men, and their lineup shows a strong
combination.
At the present time the freshmen
seem to have the edge on the other
classes. Their entries are by far the
most numerous and their lineup in
cludes many swimmers who have
made good time in high school. Their
strong events will be the sprints and
long distances. The sophomores also
have in readiness a very efficient com
bination.
Coach Brandsten wishes to an
nounce that all men who intend to en
ter the interclass meet on Saturday
should sign up immediately so that
there will be no confusion of the en
trants on the day of the meet
