# CHICK OR ME LEARNS CHINESE LANGUAGE
## Stanford Crew Has Oriental Rivals, Says E. H. Lockwood, in Letter from Orient 
### 
If you see Crew Captain "Chick"
Orme waylaying Chinese cooks, and
forcing them to talk to him in their
native tongue, don't call the fire de
partment.
Chick has merely determined to
learn the language of the Chinaman.
That he is making considerable head
way is evidenced hy the fact that he
is already able to express his opinons
of Redwood Hay quite fluently in the
foreign tongue.
"Si si, dammit, alles samee no water
in the hay heute," he said, this noon, as
proof of his progress in the new study.
Hut what is the cause of this desire
for mastery of the Chinese language?
Merely this: the Cardinal crew has
been challenged to meet a Chinese
"teng ka."
R. H. Lockwood, former secretary of
the Stanford Y. M. C. A., who is now a
missionary to China,»in a letter re
ceived on the campus, offers the fol
lowing inducements to the Stanford
eight:
"Instead of walking through the ar
boretum on my way to the school
building as I did last year, I now em
bark in a sam paan, a small boat
rowed by a man and his wife. They
are amone the 'v-o hundred thousand
people in this ci'v who are b >r>i and
married and die on the water. Their
boats take but a few inches of water,
and instead of sitting down with the'r
backs to the front of the boat, ♦'lev
stand up with their backs to the rear
of the l)oat. In spite of what seems
to us doing their work wrong, these
rowers have great speed in their arms.
[ have no doubt but what a similar
number of men in a boat of the same
length could show the stern of their
boat to even the Stanford crew. Why
don't you advocate that the crew take
a trip around the world? I would try
to match them up with some Canton
ese 'teng ka.'"
