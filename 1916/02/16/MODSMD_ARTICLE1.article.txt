# SOCCER GAME FIRST OF SPRING CONTESTS WITH U. C.
## LOCAL TURF SCENE OF ACTION California Has Strong Eleven For Clash on Washington's Birthday 
### 
When the referee's whistle sounds
next Tuesday at 2:30, on the turf field,
it will mark the active resumption of
intercollegiate relations between Cali
fornia and Stanford, and the begin
ning of the hardest fougnt soccer con
test ever staged between the teams of
the two universities. The track meet
held last spring was the last time
that the Cardinal and nine and Gold
clashed in athletics, and for almost a
year the rival colleges have not met.
The coming struggle on Washing
ton's Birthday has for this reason
aroused a great deal of enthusiasm
among both the players and the stu
dents, and it is said that California
will appear with a strong rooting sec
tion to support their team. More in
terest is being taken in the round
ball game this year on the other side
of the bay than usual. A new field has
been laid out for the exclusive use of
the soccer squad and the result is
that a larger number are turning out
for this sport.
Strong Team At U. C.
"They will have a stronger team
t his year than ever before," said Coach
Maloney in reference to the coming
game, "and will give Stanford a harder
light than in any of the preceding
years."
Last Saturday's game with the All-
Stars from the city afforded splendid
practice for the Stanford team, and
enabled Captain Reynolds and Coach
Maloney to detect weak points, of
which the greatest was the failure of
the backfield men to play their po
sitions.
