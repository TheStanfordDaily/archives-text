# Concentrating â€” or Not?
## 
### 
It may be true that the twentieth
century is an age of specialization,
but nevertheless, Mr. Maloney's article
in another column, regarding too great
concentration in one form of sport,
contains a timely note of warning for
Stanford people. More co-operation
between the men of the different sports
will result in better results in all of
them.
But are the men who are engaged
in some activity the worst offenders?
Mr. Maloney's estimate is that about
1,000 students take some form of reg
ular athletic exercise. How about the
other thousand who are not actively
engaged in athletics in any form and
so cannot be said to be concentrating
their attention too much?
A glance over the bleachers on
Wednesday or Saturday afternoon
shows that a large part of the small
crowds are the students who are par
ticipating in some other sport. This
was true at the baseball game last
Saturday, in spite of the fact that a
crew workout at Redwood and a soc
cer game on the football field at the
same hour, were claiming the adher
ents of those sports.
If the men and women who are not
engaged in any sport now, but who
are interested enough to be wild-eyed
if Stanford does not turn out winning
teams (his year, would come out and
give their support now, a big enough
proportion of that other thousand
would be present to surprise the na
tives at the appearance of the bleach
ers at next Saturday's baseball game
and to hinder the players in the gym
at tonight's basketball contest.
