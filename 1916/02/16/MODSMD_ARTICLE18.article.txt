### H. Wilfred Maloney 
Editor The Daily Palo Alto:
Dr. Albert Parker Fitch accused
Stanford men of being "snobbish."
This has been refuted by no less a per
sonage than our worthy Chancellor,
Dr. David Starr Jordan. However,
we have of course, our short-comings,
some of which we are familiar with,
and again others, of which, I should
say, we are not conscious of. One of
such I am going to mention —and it is
this: Stanford students are "self-cen
tered." No, not socially, but athletic
ally—by this I mean that most of the
men who are out for athletics arc in
terested in and participate in that
branch of sport for which they at least
feel they are best fitted.
Exercise General.
One would be safe in saying that
there is not another institution of
learning in America that has a larger
percentage of its students taking part
in some form of physical activity.
About one thousand students here at
Stanford regularly take some form of
active exercise. This, of course, is
just as it should be; few institutions
have the same facilities for the hand
ling of students who are of an athletic
turn of mind, as are to be found right
here at Stanford, with its rugby, soc
cer and baseball fields; its ideal run
ning track, tennis courts, and last, but
not least, the new gymnasium, with
its large floor space for basketball and
other indoor sports; the twelve hund
red steel lockers, eighty hot and cold
showers, and an outdoor swimming
pool, which completes a recreation
center the like of which few commun
ities can boast.
Athletic Provincialism.
But to get down to the main topic
of this communication, which is along
other lines. This general participa
tion in physical activity is highly com
mendable in every way. But there is
a danger of men becoming so wrapped
up in that sport for which they have
a particular liking, that they are apt
to lose sight of the other fellow, his
sport and what he is doing, and in this
way become indifferent towards any
sport other than the one in which be
himself participates.
If this is continued, one will, as time
goes on, not only lose sight of what
the other fellow is doing, and his
scope of athletic vision will not only
become dwarfed, but his own individ
uality will sink into obscurity, so that
he comes to feel that there is only
one thing worth while in the field if
sport, and that is, his own particular
specialty. He thus misses the verv
thing that athletics should give him;
that is, "comradeship" due to close as
sociations with his fellow students.
Must Know Each Other.
William Mayo Newhall, president of
the Board of Trustees, mentioned in
bis speech at the inaugural ceremon
ies the day of Dr. Wilbur's installation
as President: "To me the question of
most import for our student body is
not so much what they might have ac
quired of cultural and vocational
knowledge as what advantage that has
been for relation and intercourse with
their fellow men."
If a student does not cultivate this
broad scope of vision during bis col
lege career, how in the name of good
ness is he going to do so after leaving
college? Or, if he does not consider it
a duty to form the close acquaintance
ship of his fellow students in college,
how is he to get acquainted with his
fellow alumni, for the students of to
day are the alumni of tomorrow.
But one might ask, how can a man
take part in every sport that is played
here at Stanford? Of course, such a
statement would be absurd; one is not
expected to take active part in every
form of sport; but one can derive
many benefits from giving each and
every sport his moral support by pre
senting himself whenever possible at
all games, meets, etc., played here 011
the campus. A student body ticket
gives one many privileges, such as ad
mission to games, etc. This cuts down
the cost to the individual.
At the first baseball game played
here on the campus during the present
semester, Cliff Ireland, the idol of the
Stanford baseball fan, was presented
with a gold baseball by the Asso
ciated Students. A good sized bath
robe would have covered the crowd
present at what was really the first
game of the season. Again, on Satur
day last a mere handful were present
to welcome the baseball team of the
Olympic Club on their first visit to the
campus. This season seventy-one per
sons turned out to witness the basket
ball game between Stanford and St.
Ignatius, on Saturday evening, Feb
ruary sth. This was one of the finest
basketball games that I have ever
seen.
Small Attendance.
Roughly speaking, about one hund
red and twenty-five were present at
Encina gymnasium on Saturday night
last at the Stanford-Santa Clara game.
1 might add that Santa Clara people
made up a goodly number of those
present.
This indifference toward what the
other fellow is doing in athletics is not
what one would call a good Stanford
spirit. We sometimes speak of Stan
ford democracy—yes, we have the the
ory down pat. but the practice of dem
ocracy by our student body will stand
improvement.
