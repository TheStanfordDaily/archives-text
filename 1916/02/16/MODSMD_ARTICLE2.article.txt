# Leap- Year Chappie Means Danger For Campus on Friday
## 
### 
There's danger ahead. Day alter to
morrow will be leap-year day. On
Friday morning, on the Quad, and in
Uncle Sam's ollice, Chaparral will re
lease the biggest collection of laughs
since the Battle of Hull Run.
The leap-year number of Chaparral
is bound to find favor with everybody
â€”being bound in a dazzling multi-col
ored cover, apropos of the occasion.
Walt Gores, 'IT. did the work.
"Peg" Murray, '16, puts over the
snoppyquopiest Snoppyquop yet pro
duced by his versatile pen. Members
of the faculty will find interest in the
departmental sketches, entitled:
"Taking Psych;" "Studying German,"
and "A Well Known Law Term."
Johnny Olsen, '1">, Jim Wallace, '17,
and Louee McDermott, '17, offer a
bunch of clever drawings. D. Smith,
W. 10. Antrim, and I'. Rockwood are
freshman artists who come to the
front in the leap-year issue.
For those who want to read and
grin, there is an abundance of ma
terial, both pertaining to leap-year
and otherwise. There is a laugh in
every line and between every line of
the happy-go-lucky write-up of Mas
quers' one-act plays.
"Confidential Conferences" is the
name of this month's clever campus
salon converse, by Lance Warren,

tions California and spring sports in
connection with a word regarding
