# Going a-Swimming? Pay Semester's Dues
## 
### 
Now that sunshine and warm
weather have made the swimming tank
the popular rendezvous of the hour,
Graduate Manager Behrens has sta
tioned his agents at the entrance of
the plunge to collect the semester's
dues of fifty cents from Cardinal
aquatic artists.
The dues paid last semester were
good up to the first of the year only,
and the Executive Committee has au
thorized collection of this year's half
dollars. Graduate Manager Behrens
expects more men than ever to enjoy
swimming privileges this year. Stu
dent body dues also must be paid be
fore men can swim in the tank.
Swimming Coach Brandsten has an
nounced that 2 o'clock will be the time
of the interclass swimming meet, to
be held Saturday, February 19, in the
Gymnasium pool. A list has been
posted near the tank and all entrants
are urged to sign up, at once. On ac
count of the many entries in the
plunge for distance, preliminaries in
this event have been necessitated. Try
outs will be held Thursday and Friday
afternoons, and 011 Saturday morning.
