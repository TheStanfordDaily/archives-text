This should be a long story—at least
six feet six. But "space will not per
mit." Which is also the hard-luck
song of 11. W. Buckland, 'IS, champion
performer in the difficult back-stroke.
Buckland cannot sleep at night, be
cause "space will not permit." The
bed's too short. Yes, as stated above,
he is six feet six. Even with the co
operation of Big Ben, he loses out.
Buckland sets his alarm for 2 a.m. At
that hour he shifts his position, allow
ing his head and shoulders to pro
trude beyond the coverlet, instead of
his feet.
Yesterday, however, Buckland
heaved a sigh of relief. For the Uni
versity higher-ups have taken a hand
in the matter and will provide an ex
tension for Buckland's cot. In win
ning this distinction, the husky sopho
more takes first honors from Presi
dent Wilbur, who, with his six feet
three, caused much consternation at
Encina in the early days.
