Duke Kahanamoku will probably be
a visitor on the campus if the efforts
of Coach Brandsten prove of any avail.
The Duke has announced his intention
of entering the Olympic Club meet on
March 10, and if he does it is probable
that he will be willing to give the
Stanford men a chance to view him in
action.
Coach Tlrandsten is a personal
friend of the Duke and feels confident
that he will be able to bring the
"wonder of the Pacific" to the "farm"
for an exhibition swim.
The Olympic Club of San Francisco
lias extended an invitation to Stiinford
to enter a four-man team in the meet,
which will bo hold under their aus
picos 011 March 10. ft. is likely that
the Cardinal will bo ably represented
in this meet.
