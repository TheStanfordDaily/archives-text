# STUDENTS AND FACULTY WORKING FOR NEW DORMITORIES
## CONFERENCE TESTS DEMAND Chancellor and President Are Behind Plan to House Men on Campus 
### 
Work on the erection of new dormi
tories on the campus is not far dis
tant, if the combined forces now work
ing for that end have the hoped-for
effect on the hands that loosen the
University purse-strings. Following
close upon recent expressions by
Chancellor Jordan and President Wil
bur. favoring such building, the Dor
mitories committee of the Students
Conference, appointed last semester,
is getting returns on its investigation
to ascertain the actual demand for in
creased dormitory accommodations.
< inference I in estimates.
During the past week, the Confer
ence committee, of which W. 11. Stam
mer, '14, is chairman, sent out a form
letter to all students living in campus
and Palo Alto rooming lnioses, re
questing a statement of their present
accommodations, and their attitude to
ward such proposed construction. The
letters have been in circulation only
a few days, yet upward of 150, more
than half sent out, have already been
answered. This, in itself, is regarded
by the committee as signifying an ac
tive interest in such a plan, and
though the data from the forms will
not be compiled for a few weeks, the
knowledge that such a movement is
on foot is exciting interes tliroughou
the campus.
risins To Be Submitted.
The answers also include a basis for
financial estimates on the feasibility
!of the project. The complete report,
embodying the statement of conditions
and financial possibilities, together
with some feasible plan of new dorm
itory construction based upon these
findings, will be forwarded by the Stu
dents Conference to the University
Board of Trustees for their considera
tion.
The initiative of the students in this
matter was caused by conditions and
needs which Dr. Wilbur later outlined
in his installation address. The pri
mary desire is for a unified college
community with all students living in
closer contact with each other than is
now possible with so many rooming in
Palo Alto or other places that do not
properly serve the purpose. It is
! thought that closer association thus
brought about will have a favorable
influence on student life in general,
and will be reflected in all student ac
tivities, government, discipline, and
scholarship as well.
Several Ituililiims Advocated.
Xo definite plans for dormitories
have yet been formulated, but the con
sensus of opinion of the students
backing the movement, and of Chan
cellor Jordan and President Wilbur,
is that several buildings smaller than
Encina should lie built to accommo
date the demand. Three hundred are
now registered on the waiting list at
Encina, which about equals the num
ber of men living there.
Trustees Are Favorable.
Success of the movement can not
yet lie assured, a a;reat deal depending
| 011 the actual findings of the present
investigation, as well as the attitude
[ of those who will ultimately decide.
Hopes are high, however, for the Pres
; ident and Chancellor are both deeply
j interested, and it is known that sev
eral of the trustees are much in favor
of the plan, among them, President
jW. M. Newhall and Ralph Arnold, '99.
