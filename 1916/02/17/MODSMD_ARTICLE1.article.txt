# EIGHTY-EIGHT MEN SIGN FOR 1916 SEASON ON TRACK
## HALF MILE IS MOST POPULAR E.M. Peixotto Speaks to Squad on Subject of Constructive Athletics 
### 
Eighty-eight signed cards were re
turned to track captain R. R. Tem
pleton, '15, yesterday, after the men
had been gathered together in the
bleachers to hear Mr. E. M. Peixotto
in the first of the track lectures which
are to be given at intervals by men
familiar with different phases of col
lege athletics. The number of men
signed up for track falls considerably
below last year's total of 146, but this
is accounted for by the fact that last
spring the candidates signed up at
the opening rally of the semester, at
which practically every track man
was present.
The half-mile event finds the great
est number of devotees, there being
twenty-six signed up in that event.
The mile and sprints come next in
popularity, with fifteen and twelve
signed up, respectively.

Mr. E. M. Peixotto, who is in the
playground work of San Francisco,
spoke at length on what he termed
"Constructive Athletics." He showed

competition is restricted entirely to
intra-college groups, Mr. Peixotto
stated that he believed one of the
big benefits of athletics was to be
found in competition with other col
leges. This, he believed, was a great
factor in building up character, and
it was his opinion that since college
men are to be the leaders of the fu
ture, that athletics has a very big in
fluence on the future of the country.
''Dad" Favors Evening Talks.
"Dad" Moulton expressed himself as
being well pleased with the address
of Mr. Peixotto, saying, however, that
he believed it would be better in the
future to have the talks at night in
the Union or some similar place,
where it would not interf<*re with the
actual workout on the track.
