# VARSITY QUINTET FALLS BEFORE OREGON AGGIES
## GAME IS FULL OF FIGHT Freshmen Smother Keystone Club in Curtain Raiser Last Night 
### 
Stanford's varsity five went down to
defeat last evening before the fast
Oregon Agricultural College team by
a 28-10 score. In the preliminary
game the freshmen defeated the Key
stone Club of San Jose, 79 to 11.
First Half.
During the first half play was loose
and slow. Neither team seemed able
to locate the basket, and it was some
time before Blodget scored the first
field goal. All through the game the
varsity showed improvement in pass
ing and team work. Superior size and
knowledge of the game gave the
northerners the victory. The first
half ended 17-3.
Second Half.
In the second half both teams tight
ened up and played a fast game. Blod
get and Dolan starred for the varsity,
while Siebert and Mix played brilliant
games for the winners. Watson, who
was sent in to take Dolan's place
when the latter was placed at forward
to relieve Worthy, showed lots of
fight and shot two difficult baskets.
First Year Game.
The preliminary game was a walk
away. Never did the visitors show
any signs of breaking up the dazzling
team work of the freshmen. Highter,
Pelouze, and Estes formed a combina
tion which was responsible for the
majority of the baskets. Rigliter out
jumped his man on practically every
tossup, and little time was then lost
until the basket was shot. One lone
foul was the extent of the Keystone
scoring during the first half, while the
nineteeners tallied for a count of
forty-four. At the beginning of the
second half the club men showed
signs of emerging from their slump
and scored ten points more.
The box score follows:
