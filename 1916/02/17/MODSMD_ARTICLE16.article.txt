# Maloney Tries New Line-Up For Soccer
## Experimenting To Find Best Combination For Game With California Next Tuesday 
### 
Captain Moyle and Coacli Maloney
are doing their best to put the soc
cer team in prime condition for the
game with California next Tuesday.
Various shifts are being made both
in the forward and defensive divisions.
Experiments in the lineup will con
tinue until the strongest combination
is perfected.
Temporary Line-Shifts.
I.ast night Captain Boyle changed
from center forward to full, his old
place being taken by Reynolds. In
the forward section, Danny Carroll
moved to inside right from right wing,
and Adams shifted over from inside
left to take Carroll's place, leaving
Art Erb in turn to play inside left
instead of inside right. These posi
tions are not in any wise permanent,
and are more in the form of experi
ments to find where the men can play
most effectively.
In the way of advertising the game
with California on Washington's
Mirthday, slides are being thrown on
the screens in Palo Alto, and posters
have been distributed about the cam
[ pus.
