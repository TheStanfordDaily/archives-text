						Step Forward

### 
The Senior Farce committee has
taken one step forward in dramatics
with its ruling that the selection of
the cast shall he left entirely in the
hands of the coach. The individuals
in the casts of some shows in the past
have not been above suspicion of
wirepulling to secure their positions.
If politics did play a part in the
past, selection of the cast by the
coach is one of the best ways to be rid
of it. But whether or not this sus
picion is well grounded the coach is
the logical man to control the giving
of parts in shows. If he is the right
man for the place he has had more
experience than the members of the
committee in producing plays and his
impartiality can be relied on. And
there is no need of having any one
who is not the right man, for good
coaches can be obtained.
