# How About Handball?
## 
### 
The new gymnasium is finished and
is now in use, with adequate floor
space for all of the so-called indoor
sports. But how about handball?
It is true that handball hath not its
glories no less renowned than basket
ball, but annual tournaments held on
the courts at the old gymnasium used
to bring out a big following and create
good sport for a lot of people. This
in spite of the fact that the tourneys
were held under decidedly unideal
conditions.
Handball has one big advantage
pertaining to no other sport which has
been popularized at Stanford —the ad
vantage that two men with a minimum
of equipment make a game. An idle
hour most any time can be utilized
for a game of handball by a couple
of men without waiting to make up a
team.
The very best of courts could be
erected in the vacant spaces around
the gym. We understand that the
original plans of the new building
called for provisions for handball
games out of doors. Spring is here
and the fever is in our bloods, but
the handball courts are missing.
