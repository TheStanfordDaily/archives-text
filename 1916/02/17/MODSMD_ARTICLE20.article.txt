McDowell To
Register Voters.
Assistant Registrar .J. E. McDowell
has been sworn in to register voters.
The eligibility of a student is decided
by his place of residence and his
source of income. Few women are
expected to register due to their lack
of permanent address.
Spring elections will be the first at
which these voters may use the priv
ileges of a Stanford poll.

Race With Deputy
Ends In Grief.
L. M. Wolf, '17, gave heed to the call
of spring yesterday, and in a stripped
racing car led a big eight-cylinder car
a merry race at a speed of fifty miles
an hour, until his gasoline gave out â€”
and then he discovered that the big
car contained the district attorney of
San Jose and his deputy. Wolf is now
awaiting trial on three counts: Op
erating a car without a tail light, with
an open muffler, and at excessive
speed.
