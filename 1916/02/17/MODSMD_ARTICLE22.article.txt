# NOTED ECONOMIC WORKS AT SERVICE OF STUDENTS
## Books by Contemporary and Past Authors Added To Library 
### 
Twelve of the new books received
by the Stanford library, this week,
are for the Department of Economics.
Of these T. Pitmin's "Statistical View
of the Commerce of the United States
for 1835," is probably of most import
ance, both for its early date and
the carefully prepared government
tables that accompany it. Of imme
diate value is a volume from the Lon
don press on the "History and Eco
nomics of Transportation," by A. W.
Kirkalby and A. D. Evans.
"The Asylum Journal of Mental
Science" for 1853 to 1855, is in the
shipment, as an addition to those
books bought by the Thomas Welton
Stanford fund. It is the publication of
the Association of Medical Officers
of Asylums for the Insane, London.
From the Library of Congress has
been received the "Catalogue of the
John Boyd Thatcher Collection of In
cunabulan," which is an excellent
piece of standard bibliographical work.
In the future new books will be left
on the shelf in the reference room
from Monday until Friday only, and
the new United States documents will
be exhibited on Friday and Saturday.
