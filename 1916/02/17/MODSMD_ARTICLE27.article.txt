### 
Four innings of loose baseball was
indulged in last night by the freshman

nine when they white
washed a pickup nine
from Manzanita in a prac
tice game, by a 13 to 0
score. "Bobby" Pelouze
filled in as center fielder
for Manzanita, and his

fielding featured the game, as he was
playing practically the entire outfield.
The freshmen secured 16 hits. Their
lineup was: Patterson, p; E. Mitch
ell, c; Mitchell, lb; Messick, 2b;
Shriver, 3b; Cowan, ss; Ryan, If;
Lilly, cf; Reagon, rf.
Captain "Babe" Dent has stolen
more bases so far this season than
any player on the varsity. Hardly a
game passes that the lanky receiver
does not pilfer a sack or two.
—o —
The Cardinal infield seems to lack
confidence. They do not make many
errors that can be recorded as such,
but at critical moments they make
fielder's choices that are decidedly
poor choices. There also seems to be
a tendency to throw wild to first base.
"Doc" Hayes will be at least a foot
longer when the present season is
over.
—o —
Stevens has been meeting the ball
on the nose. His home run yesterday
was no fluke. It was a hard hit ball
and good for a homer in any lot.
—o —
Shortstop is a position that is
worrying the Stanford dopesters very
much. Several men have been tried
out, so far, and while they all hold
down the position in fair style, it must
be admitted that the short field is a
weak spot on the local lineup.
—o —
Klawitter, who twirled for the Tail
ors in yesterday's contest, is rated as
one of the three best pitchers in the
Pacific Coast League. He was work
ing in excellent form against the Stan
ford nine, sending eight of the locals
to the bench via the strikeout route.

Four innings of loose baseball was
indulged in last night by the freshman

nine when they white
washed a pickup nine
from Manzanita in a prac
tice game, by a 13 to 0
score. "Bobby" Pelouze
filled in as center fielder
for Manzanita, and his

fielding featured the game, as he was
playing practically the entire outfield.
The freshmen secured 16 hits. Their
lineup was: Patterson, p; E. Mitch
ell, c; Mitchell, lb; Messick, 2b;
Shriver, 3b; Cowan, ss; Ryan, If;
Lilly, cf; Reagon, rf.
Captain "Babe" Dent has stolen
more bases so far this season than
any player on the varsity. Hardly a
game passes that the lanky receiver
does not pilfer a sack or two.
—o —
The Cardinal infield seems to lack
confidence. They do not make many
errors that can be recorded as such,
but at critical moments they make
fielder's choices that are decidedly
poor choices. There also seems to be
a tendency to throw wild to first base.
"Doc" Hayes will be at least a foot
longer when the present season is
over.
—o —
Stevens has been meeting the ball
on the nose. His home run yesterday
was no fluke. It was a hard hit ball
and good for a homer in any lot.
—o —
Shortstop is a position that is
worrying the Stanford dopesters very
much. Several men have been tried
out, so far, and while they all hold
down the position in fair style, it must
be admitted that the short field is a
weak spot on the local lineup.

Four innings of loose baseball was
indulged in last night by the freshman

nine when they white
washed a pickup nine
from Manzanita in a prac
tice game, by a 13 to 0
score. "Bobby" Pelouze
filled in as center fielder
for Manzanita, and his

fielding featured the game, as he was
playing practically the entire outfield.
The freshmen secured 16 hits. Their
lineup was: Patterson, p; E. Mitch
ell, c; Mitchell, lb; Messick, 2b;
Shriver, 3b; Cowan, ss; Ryan, If;
Lilly, cf; Reagon, rf.
Captain "Babe" Dent has stolen
more bases so far this season than
any player on the varsity. Hardly a
game passes that the lanky receiver
does not pilfer a sack or two.
—o —
The Cardinal infield seems to lack
confidence. They do not make many
errors that can be recorded as such,
but at critical moments they make
fielder's choices that are decidedly
poor choices. There also seems to be
a tendency to throw wild to first base.
"Doc" Hayes will be at least a foot
longer when the present season is
over.
—o —
Stevens has been meeting the ball
on the nose. His home run yesterday
was no fluke. It was a hard hit ball
and good for a homer in any lot.
—o —
Shortstop is a position that is
worrying the Stanford dopesters very
much. Several men have been tried
out, so far, and while they all hold
down the position in fair style, it must
be admitted that the short field is a
weak spot on the local lineup.
—o —
Klawitter, who twirled for the Tail
ors in yesterday's contest, is rated as
one of the three best pitchers in the
Pacific Coast League. He was work
ing in excellent form against the Stan
ford nine, sending eight of the locals
to the bench via the strikeout route.
