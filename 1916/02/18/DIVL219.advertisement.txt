FLOW KKS THAT BLOOM in the
Sprint; often inspire us to super
hiiman feats, especially nil these
days of hikes. Mow is the time for
all (food men and women to come to
the country, and conduct those an
nual geology seminars to see what
is in the hills and tields around
Stanford. Communes with nature
are the order of the day, and there
is nothing that will add quite so
much to their pleasure as good stout
hoots.. Tlioits' is the place to pre
pare hoots for hikes.
