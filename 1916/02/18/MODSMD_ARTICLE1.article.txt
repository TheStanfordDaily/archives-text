Agnews has played the Cardinal first
string contingent on two occasions,
this season, coming out on the long
end of the score both times. They have
a fast club, made up of semi-profes
sional players and leaguers. Their
battery, composed of Kohne, formerly
a Denver Western League star, and
Lynn, who goes to the Chicago White
Sox next year, is in a class by itself,
while the rest of their lineup, Kohner,
McGregor, Esola, Bartlett, Kriss,
Lackey, and Lamarra, is capable of
giving any team a bard game.
San .lose State (hamp.
San Jose High will in all probability
send a strong lineup to the campus to
battle the first year aggregation. They
won the state championship last year,
and it is understood that nearly the
same squad will putin an appearance
tomorrow, that cavorted for the
"Prune Pickers" last season.
Captain "Babe" Dent and Coach
Harry Wolter have been putting the
varsity and the freshmen through
strenous workouts nightly, and they
figure that the opposing nines will
have their hands full. The varsity
will lineup as follows: Either Hoever,
Howe, Wickersham, and Mattei, in the
box, Dent behind the plate, Hayes on
first base, Stafford on the keystone
station, Stevens on third, and Dickey
on short; Sanborn, Lander, Braden,
and Noonan will chase the fly balls.
The freshmen will start the same
with Peterson twirling. E. Mitchell be
hind the log, Mitchell on the initial
cushion, Messick on second, Shriver on
third, and Cowan covering the short
field. The outer gardens will be taken
care of by Ryan, Lilly, and Reagon.

varsity and the freshmen through
strenous workouts nightly, and they
figure that the opposing nines will
have their hands full. The varsity
will lineup as follows: Either Hoever,
Howe, Wickersham, and Mattei, in the
box, Dent behind the plate, Hayes on
first base, Stafford on the keystone
station, Stevens on third, and Dickey
on short; Sanborn, Lander, Braden,
and Noonan will chase the fly balls.
The freshmen will start the same
with Peterson twirling. E. Mitchell be
hind the log, Mitchell on the initial
cushion, Messick on second, Shriver on
third, and Cowan covering the short
field. The outer gardens will be taken
care of by Ryan, Lilly, and Reagon.
