# Interclass Swim Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford swimmers will hit the
water tomorrow at - o'clock for the
first meet of the year. The meet will
be an inter-class affair, any man being
eligible to competition.
Local aquatic athletes have been
handicapped for a time by lack of
water while the pool was being
cleaned.
