# DANCE 'TIL WEE SMALL HOURS, SAYS MEN'S CONFERENCE
## VOTE IS ALMOST UNANIMOUS Women to Decide Length of Evening at Meeting Next Wednesday 
### 
Men's Student Conference last night
voted to extend the time for stopping
campus dances from 12 to 1 o'clock.
This action was taken after consier
able discussion on the matter, and the
vote was practically unanimous in
favor of the change, but two members
of conference opposing it. Like action
by the Women's Conference must be
taken before the rule goes into ef
fect, however, and a vote will be taken
at the meeting next Wednesday eve
ning. The proposition, as passed by
the men .includes both Friday and Sat
urday nights.
Arguments lii Favor.
Those who favored the change em
phasized the point of expense incurred
in giving formals such as the Junior
Prom and the Sophomore cotillion.
They brought out the fact that it is
impossible to start these dances until
about 9 o'clock, and that three hours
of dancing is not enough to repay those,
who attend for the money expended.
Ilnle Is liroken.
Other discussion was to the effect
that, as long as the majority of stu
dents were opposed to the present
rule, as evinced from the fact that it
has been repeatedly broken, it might
as well be changed. Where the letter
of the law has been lived up to, the
spirit has been broken by the subter
fuge of stopping the dances at 12 and
serving supper afterward.
A committee of H. L. Loud, gr., B.
Williams, '16, and J. R. Braden, '16,
chairman, was appointed to recom
mend the change to the Women's Con
ference. If this body approves, the
new rule will go into effect at once.
The minutes follow:
Meeting February 17, 1916.
President Miller in the chair.
MSC that campus dances be allowed
to last until 1 o'clock instead of 12,

ference.
