# Why One O'clock?

### 
The weight of opinion swings back
and forth in the balance. Having
stayed too long in a conservative po
sition on the dancing question, it now
takes a swing in the opposite direction.
As evidenced by the action of the Uni
versity Conference, perhaps it has gone
too far.
It is doubtful, in the first place, if
the 1 o'clock rule will really result in
longer hours for dancing. The dances
which now start at 8:15 or 8:30, will
gradually move forward to 9 or a few
minutes after, for starting, and most
of the time gained at the end of the
dance will be wasted in beginning late.
A different phase of the question is
involved when formal dances and rep
resentative dances, whether formal or
informal, are considered.
A big expense is incurred by the or
ganizations giving these dances. It is
practically impossible to start them
early and it is a question whether
those attending get their money's
worth when dancing only lasts for
three hours. So in regard to formal
and representative dances—the Junior
Prom, the Sophomore Cotillion, and
representative dances at the halls and
at fraternity and club houses—it is
only just that the hour for closing
should be 1 o'clock.
Hut these arguments can not be used
for informal campus dances. There is
little logic in the argument that the
12 o'clock rule should be rescinded
because it is broken. As a matter of
fact in the usual case where it is
broken, it is only a matter of minutes
and the same difficulty will always be
encountered unless dances are allowed
to run all night.
It would be easy to distinguish be
tween the ordinary informal dances
and the formal or representative
dances. We think that it would be a
good thing to extend dancing to 1
o'clock only in the case of the latter.
