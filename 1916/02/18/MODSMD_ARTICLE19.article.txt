# KNOW THE PLAN OF STANFORD?
## Here Is an Outline of the University's Organization 
### 
"I wish a course of instruction in
the founding, organization and admin
istration of the University might he
established today," said Mrs. Allan,
Dean of Women, yesterday, while dis
cussing the ignorance of those things
she mentioned, on the part of most of
each year's graduates. "Would you
believe that 3 per cent is a high pro
portion of the graduating students who
can satisfactorily answer even the
simplest question regarding the basis
of Stanford organization, or the ro
mantic phases of its history?" Mrs.
Allan has investigated each year the
knowledge of these facts by means of
a questionaire of graduating classes,
and an average of over 97 per cent
makes up the list of the ignorant.
"This year's class will be ques
tioned, also," says Mrs. Allan, "but the
97 per cent will be materially lessened
if the students take the opportunity to
read the new Manual of the Hoard of
Trustees, recently published, and now
in the University library."
The Manual referred to is a compre
hensive work compiled by George E.
Crothers, '91), and member of the
Hoard of Trustees. It includes all leg
islation leading up to and following
upon the establishment of the Univer
sity, trusts designated, faculty organ
ization, by-laws, rules of order, and
general resolutions of the Hoard of
Trustees. The documents included
were first gathered for the Stanford
Alumnus, by Crothers.
Hoard of Trustees.
The Hoard of Trustees is a body of
fifteen men in whom all power for the
general management and control of
the University is vested. The Hoard
meets once a month. Whenever a va
cancy occurs, the place is filled for a
ten-year term by election by the Trus
tees. They appoint the President of
the University, from outside their own
number, and may remove him at their
pleasure, and approve the appoint
ment of professors, made by the Presi
dent.
Hoard Arranges Salaries.
All questions of salary to be paid to
the President and the faculty are left
to the board, with the provision by the
founders, that the rates paid shall be
such as to get men of the highest cal
iber. Sectarian instruction is barred
by the expressed desire of the Stan
fords, but they specified that students
should be taught the existence of God,
and that obedience to His laws is man's
highest duty.
Farm School In Original Plan.
Included in the instructions of the
founding grants, is the provision for a

farm on the Palo Alto estate to be
maintained for instruction in agricul
ture in all its branches. An annual
report of the proceedings and financial
operations of the board is to be made
to the Governor of the state.
President's Powers.
The President, though subject ulti
mately to the Hoard of Trustees, is
guaranteed enough power to direct the
policy of the school and make his
personality felt. Direct responsibility
rests on the shoulders of the execu
tive. The president's duty also in
cludes the submitting of a budget of
estimated expenses for the coming
year, to the board, and this budget
must be made to correspond to the
statement of University income made
to the board by their Business Man
ager. The budget is made up by the
President in collaboration with faculty
heads of departments. As a sort of
cabinet, for consultation, the President
has the Academic Council.
The Academic Council.
This body consists of all professors
of the University and in it rests such
power and authority of the faculty as
is given by the trustees. Only faculty
members who have been in the school
for three years are in the Council. All
matters of internal administration and
regulation comes under the jurisdic
tion of the faculty, thus constituted as
the Council, and in this way, the com
mittees of the body are responsible to
the trustees for student conduct and
standing.
Whatever of self-government is held
by the undergraduates is thus dele
gated from committees of the Aca
demic Council, which are directly re
sponsible to the powers above for the
situation on the campus at any time.
3o as a matter of protection for the
faculty members bound by the board,
the students may retain their delegated
rights of government only so long as
their conduct is satisfactory to the
trustees.
Financial Management.
The Committee on Finance of the
Board of Trustees is responsible for
all matters of revenue and expendi
ture. Through them the Board ap
points a Business Manager, who is now
one of their number, but not so neces
sarily. He may or may not receive a
salary, but is to attend to all actual
business connected with the Univer
sity. The Business Manager appoints
a Farm Manager, who is his personal
representative on the campus. The
gross income handled through the
Business Office is estimated at $1,000,-
000 per year.
