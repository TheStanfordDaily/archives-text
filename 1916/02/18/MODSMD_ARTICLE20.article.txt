## SONNY'S LETTER HOME 
### 
Dear Ma:
Life's one doggon thing after an
other. Now they've found another way
to limit the number of studes on the
farm. It's by unlimiting the dances.
Last night the Men's Conference
found away to slip it over on Father
Time and put twenty-five hours in
some of the days. They are going to
steal one from the following day, with
out the following day knowing it.
just so that we can get in all our
latest one-steps before the lights have
to go out.
Now there's a tong war on between
the taxi-drivers' and the musicians'
unions, with the former pro and the
latter con.
I bear there's a movement to hold
services iti tlr" Memorial Church Sup
day afternoon instead of in the morn
ing. We ought to wake up in time
to got dinner the morning after the
night before and then go to vespers.
I think you'll have to increase my
allowance now, because the Grad. Man
ager says benefit campus dances will

cost $1.10 hereafter. They ought to
he worth it.
They're are going to start a training
table at our houses to get the fellows
in condition for the week-end. No
more pie until summer for your little
sonny. Swell for the roughs, though.
1 think it would he a good hunch to
have a heauty sleep at the end of the
tenth dance instead of supper, just
for the good lookers of the campus,
don't you? Then we could have break
fast before going home.
Hooray for T. Edison. If he can get.
along on three hours' sleep, we can.
Ever your, SONNY.
