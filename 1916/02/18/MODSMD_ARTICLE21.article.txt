# GUILD BOARD SETS ASIDE SPECIAL SERVICE FUND
## 
### 
Fifty dollars a semester has been
set aside by the Guild Hoard as a fund
to be used at the discretion of Dr.
Stolz in securing more efficient medi
cal attention in those cases which do
not come under the direct care of the
board, including cases which require
X-ray attention or the services of a
specialist. This money, however, will
serve only as a loan fund, and students
making use of it will be required to
give their note for the amount bor
rowed.
