# California Notes
## 
### 
California's crew boathouse was
moved Saturday from the Alameda
side of Oakland estuary to the foot
of Washington street, saving about
twenty minutes in the trip required
from the campus to headquarters. The
Blue and Gold crew is not to prac
tice in the new Columbia pattern shell
for another week, because of their
unsteadiness on the water. The new
shell is the lightest ever used at
California, all possible weight being
sacrificed for speed.

California is developing preliminary
competition by offering the use of
their crew equipment to the Olympic
Club, with week-end races in view.
This club has announced that it will
put an eight-oar crew in the water for
Stanford and California competition,
as well as for meets with other clubs
on the coast. The Winged-O roster
includes a number of crack oarsmen
from the east.

The California tradition that no
woman shall ever cross the thresh
hold of Senior Hall, is hanging in the
balance. Some insist that rehearsals
for the Senior Extravaganza must be
held there because no other places are
available.

Graduate Manager Stroud of Cali
fornia denies absolutely that any ne
gotiations have been entered into
with Eddie Mahan, the Harvard grid
iron expert, regarding coaching at
Berkeley next season. He says, also,
that the report purporting to have
come from Comptroller R. P. Merritt
that Mahan would assist Andy Smith
next fall, was a direct misrepresenta
tion.

The claim of the University of Cali
fornia to a gift of timber valued at
$250,000, was upheld yesterday by a
decision of the Superior Court. Horace
Whitaker left this property to the uni
versity upon his death, on condition
that it be used for experimental work
in forestry. His heirs sued to gain
possession of the timber, on the
grounds that the condition had not
been fulfilled.
