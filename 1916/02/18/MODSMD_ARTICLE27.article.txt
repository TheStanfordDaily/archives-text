# Dr. Jordan's Highbrow Talks Stir New York Newspapers
## 
### 
Dr. .Jordan's recent diagnosis of a
lowbrow has provoked a nation-wide
controversy. "Who are the lowbrows,"
asks the New York Tribune, and the
Cornell Daily Sun echoes the senti
ment, with a plea of the interchange
ability of "lowbrow" and "roughneck."
In connection with their questions
these papers venture to clear the field
in the following manner:
"It is only too evident that most of
us have been classifying our brothers
with a lack of particularity amounting
almost to looseness. We have been
calling those lowbrows who were sim
ply roughnecks and we have been con
fusing social with intellectual oppro
brium."
"If Dr. Jordan's codification of these
epithets be accepted the lowbrow need
suffer under no social disability. He
may simply be 'too practical,' while
the highbrow is not practical enough.
In other words, the lowbrow is he who
is given to the purely objective and
concrete view of things. He has a
fondness for the business on hand; he
prefers football to philosophy, the
market place to the library.
