# English Club Has Turned Futurist

### 
It takes the English Club to look to
the future.
Some day, argues English Club, the
piesent brilliant coterie of literati will
be passed from hence to that great be
yond where we read of them in the
Saturday Evening Post, the Nation,
and Life. Then who's going to carry
on the work here at the great divide?
Accordingly, English Club has de
vised the following scheme—to care
for the future. A short criticism con
test of "The Great Divide" will be
opened for students of Palo Alto High
school. The student who submits the
best criticism of "The Great Divide"
within one week of the time it is pre
sented in the Assembly Hall, on March
3, will have his works published in a
local paper and will receive a prize of
five dollars.
The trouble is this —criticisms will
be accepted only from Palo Alto High
school students. Why not start a sim
ilar contest among Geology majors,
and another from the Engineering
roughs, English Club?
