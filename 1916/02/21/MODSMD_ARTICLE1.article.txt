Varsity Shows (jood Form.
Stanford displayed the best brand of
basketball of this season through the
entire first half. The men were accur
ate in their passing, played together
better and took bigger chances at the
baskets. The Nevada team, while
heavier, was unable to keep the ball
and played more of a defensive game
In the second half, however, they
opened up, and taking the offensive,
clearly outplayed the Cardinals. Hen
ningsen and Buckman were almost
tall enough to drop the ball into the
basket, while no one was able to stick
with McKensie long enough to pre
vent his scoring.
Scrappy Play in Second.
Hlodget, Dolan, and Watson starred
for Stanford. The game, and particu
larly the second half, was marked by
fast, scrappy, playing, which resulted
in the calling of many fouls.
The opening contest was very fast
and much closer than the score would
indicate. The Bay City lads several
times got to the basket only to lose
out by poor shooting.
The freshmen gave a brilliant ex-
hibition of team work. Rigliter and
Sullivan were the bright lights of the
nineteen combination.
