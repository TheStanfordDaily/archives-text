# CARDINAL BALL TEAMS WIN AND LOSE ON SATURDAY
## AGNEWS DEFEATS VARSITY Freshmen Beat San Jose High in Exciting Game by 7 to 6 Score 
### 
Cardinal baseball enthusiasts were
treated to a fast double-header on the
local lot, Saturday, the Stanford teams
breaking even on the day's play. The
morning game went to the freshmen
after nine innings of close and inter
esting baseball, San Jose High school
rircing the first year players at all
times. The final score was 7 to 6.
Agnews State Hospital trimmed the
varsity in the afternoon game, for the
third consecutive time this season,
their club, composed of semi-pro toss
ers "\nd leaguers, carrying off the long
one )f a 9 to 2 score.
Freshman Game Fast.
There is no doubt that the morning
contest, although scattered with errors
and slight misplays, was the best
played game of the present season on
home territory. It was featured by
the pitching of "Bill" Paul, the op
posing twirler, the fast fielding of
Messick, the freshmen guardian of the
keystone sack, and a smashing triple
to deep right-center by Mitchell, the
first year first sacker, at a crucial
moment. Double plays were pulled off
in lightning fashion by the Cardinal
infield, while the opposing shortstop
and second baseman brought a rise
from the bleachers with their fast
and accurate fielding of hard hit balls.
Varsity Match Slow.
In the afternoon, the varsity and
Agnews team staged a battle that was
fast in one particular line at least.
The nine innings were run off in one
hour and forty minutes, excellent, time
for a college baseball game. Umpire
.lack McCarthy can be thanked by the
local "bugs" for the speedy contest.
It was the same old story. The var
sity played listless ball during most of
the game. At times they livened up
and tore off plays that would be a
credit to any team. Stevens made two
wonderful stops of hard hit grounders,
while Braden, Hayes, and Stevens dis
tinguished themselves in a fast double
play.
Four Runs for Lynn.
Noonan and Stevens scored the Car
dinal's lone two runs. Bert Lynn, the
catcher of the Agnews club, did the
twinkle, twinkle act for the visitors,
scoring four runs, one of which was a
four-sack smash. McGregor also con
nected with one of Howe's twisters
for a homer, while Lynn stepped into
another one for a three-bagger. The

first year first sacker, at a crucial
moment. Double plays were pulled off
in lightning fashion by the Cardinal
infield, while the opposing shortstop
and second baseman brought a rise
from the bleachers with their fast
and accurate fielding of hard hit balls.
Varsity Match Slow.
In the afternoon, the varsity and
Agnews team staged a battle that was
fast in one particular line at least.
The nine innings were run off in one
hour and forty minutes, excellent, time
for a college baseball game. Umpire
.lack McCarthy can be thanked by the
local "bugs" for the speedy contest.
It was the same old story. The var
sity played listless ball during most of
the game. At times they livened up
and tore off plays that would be a
credit to any team. Stevens made two
wonderful stops of hard hit grounders,
while Braden, Hayes, and Stevens dis
tinguished themselves in a fast double
play.
Four Runs for Lynn.
Noonan and Stevens scored the Car
dinal's lone two runs. Bert Lynn, the
catcher of the Agnews club, did the
twinkle, twinkle act for the visitors,
scoring four runs, one of which was a
four-sack smash. McGregor also con
nected with one of Howe's twisters
for a homer, while Lynn stepped into
another one for a three-bagger. The

Cardinal baseball enthusiasts were
treated to a fast double-header on the
local lot, Saturday, the Stanford teams
breaking even on the day's play. The

rircing the first year players at all
times. The final score was 7 to 6.
Agnews State Hospital trimmed the
varsity in the afternoon game, for the

Freshman Game Fast.
There is no doubt that the morning

and slight misplays, was the best
played game of the present season on
home territory. It was featured by
the pitching of "Bill" Paul, the op

Messick, the freshmen guardian of the
keystone sack, and a smashing triple
to deep right-center by Mitchell, the

Cardinal baseball enthusiasts were
treated to a fast double-header on the
local lot, Saturday, the Stanford teams
breaking even on the day's play. The
morning game went to the freshmen
after nine innings of close and inter
esting baseball, San Jose High school
rircing the first year players at all
times. The final score was 7 to 6.
Agnews State Hospital trimmed the
varsity in the afternoon game, for the
third consecutive time this season,
their club, composed of semi-pro toss
ers "\nd leaguers, carrying off the long
one )f a 9 to 2 score.
Freshman Game Fast.
There is no doubt that the morning
contest, although scattered with errors
and slight misplays, was the best
played game of the present season on
home territory. It was featured by
the pitching of "Bill" Paul, the op
posing twirler, the fast fielding of
Messick, the freshmen guardian of the
keystone sack, and a smashing triple
to deep right-center by Mitchell, the
first year first sacker, at a crucial
moment. Double plays were pulled off
in lightning fashion by the Cardinal
infield, while the opposing shortstop
and second baseman brought a rise
from the bleachers with their fast
and accurate fielding of hard hit balls.
Varsity Match Slow.
In the afternoon, the varsity and
Agnews team staged a battle that was
fast in one particular line at least.
The nine innings were run off in one
hour and forty minutes, excellent, time
for a college baseball game. Umpire
.lack McCarthy can be thanked by the
local "bugs" for the speedy contest.
It was the same old story. The var
sity played listless ball during most of
the game. At times they livened up
and tore off plays that would be a
credit to any team. Stevens made two
wonderful stops of hard hit grounders,
while Braden, Hayes, and Stevens dis
tinguished themselves in a fast double
play.
Four Runs for Lynn.
Noonan and Stevens scored the Car
dinal's lone two runs. Bert Lynn, the
catcher of the Agnews club, did the
twinkle, twinkle act for the visitors,
scoring four runs, one of which was a
four-sack smash. McGregor also con

Cardinal baseball enthusiasts were
treated to a fast double-header on the
local lot, Saturday, the Stanford teams
breaking even on the day's play. The
morning game went to the freshmen
after nine innings of close and inter
esting baseball, San Jose High school
rircing the first year players at all
times. The final score was 7 to 6.
Agnews State Hospital trimmed the
varsity in the afternoon game, for the
third consecutive time this season,
their club, composed of semi-pro toss
ers "\nd leaguers, carrying off the long
one )f a 9 to 2 score.
Freshman Game Fast.
There is no doubt that the morning
contest, although scattered with errors
and slight misplays, was the best
played game of the present season on
home territory. It was featured by
the pitching of "Bill" Paul, the op
posing twirler, the fast fielding of
Messick, the freshmen guardian of the
keystone sack, and a smashing triple
to deep right-center by Mitchell, the
first year first sacker, at a crucial
moment. Double plays were pulled off
in lightning fashion by the Cardinal
infield, while the opposing shortstop
and second baseman brought a rise
from the bleachers with their fast
and accurate fielding of hard hit balls.
Varsity Match Slow.
In the afternoon, the varsity and
Agnews team staged a battle that was
fast in one particular line at least.
The nine innings were run off in one
hour and forty minutes, excellent, time
for a college baseball game. Umpire
.lack McCarthy can be thanked by the
local "bugs" for the speedy contest.
It was the same old story. The var
sity played listless ball during most of
the game. At times they livened up
and tore off plays that would be a
credit to any team. Stevens made two
wonderful stops of hard hit grounders,
while Braden, Hayes, and Stevens dis
tinguished themselves in a fast double
play.
Four Runs for Lynn.
Noonan and Stevens scored the Car
dinal's lone two runs. Bert Lynn, the
catcher of the Agnews club, did the
twinkle, twinkle act for the visitors,
scoring four runs, one of which was a
four-sack smash. McGregor also con
nected with one of Howe's twisters
for a homer, while Lynn stepped into
another one for a three-bagger. The
