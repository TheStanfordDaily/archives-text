Clara five downed tlie Cardinal var
sity over a week ago in Encina gym
nasium, but with the improvement
shown in the Oregon Agricultural Col

team should come back with a win.
The varsity at present is in the
best shape of the season. Captain
Blodget has a big job on his hands in
his triple capacity of coach, captain
and player, but is whipping the men
into form. His play at forward, all
through the season, has brought ap
plause from the fans.
The other forward berth is being
well cared for by Worthy and Watson.

while Dolan and Caughey are both
stellar guards.
