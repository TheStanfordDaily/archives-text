A loss which is keenly felt in the
efficiency of The Daily Palo Alto staff
these days is occasioned by the resig
nation of Anita Allen, '17. Miss Allen
has served on the paper for two years,
working as a reporter and successively
as woman's editor and news editor.
The ability and energy which she put
into her work made her a very valu
able member of the staff.
Other resignations from the staff are
those of J. V. Wood, '18, L. W. Brown,
'18, W. M. Owens, '19, J. A. Murphy, '19,

of women's staff, graduated at the end
of last semester.
We welcome back Miss Olive Yoder,
'16, to a place on the women's staff.

count of the pressure of other activi
ties and has returned now to take up
work again on the Daily,

promoted to the rank of news editor.
