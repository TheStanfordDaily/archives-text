# High Tides Again Permit Regular Crew Practice
## 
### 
After an enforced layoff of almost
an entire week, the Cardinal crews re
sumed practice on Redwood Hay on
Saturday. During the preceding four
days the tide was too low to permit
the regular workouts late in the af
ternoon, and only one crew of fresh
men was taken to the estuary each
day.
On both Saturday and yesterday
mornings Coach Guerena was on hand
to direct the practices. Though ef
forts were made to locate a launch
for the coach, he had to continue his
practice of watching all four crews
from a position at coxswain in the
varsity shell.
Practically all training rules are now
in force for the crew candidates.
Smoking, drinking, eating between
meals, heavy pastries, and swimming
are officially tabooed by Coach Guer
ena.
The oarsmen taken to the bay today
were:
Varsity—Goodman, coxswain; Maur
er, stroke; Green, Orme, Rogers, Jaco
mini, Worth, Steinbeck, and Neuner.
Freshmen—Lyon, coxswain; Rent,
stroke; Drown, Hetts, Winham, Waite,
Howling Curtice, and Atwater.
Second Varsity—Willis, coxswain;
Heron, stroke; Keller, Coleman, An
drews, Russell, Swarts, McNulty, and
Kayser.
Pour-Oar —A. Robbins, coxswain;
Iredell, stroke; Jeffers, Johnson, and
