# BARBS SUCCUMB TO CARDINAL ELEVEN
## Shifts in Line-Ups Result in a 4 to 1 Victory on Local Turf Saturday 
### 
In a contest featured by a marked
change in the style of game displayed
by the Stanford eleven, the Barbarian
soccer aggregation met defeat on the
home turf, Saturday afternoon, by the
score of 4 to 1. The change is due in
the most part to shifts which Coach
Maloney made in the lineups during
the past week.
In Saturday's game the Cardinal men
displayed a fighting spirit from start
to finish; the backfield presented a
stiff defense and was seldom caught
napping, while the forward division
passed with precison and showed an
encouraging amount of team work,
keeping the opposing backs busy.
Two goals by Art Erb, one of which
was made on a long angle shot, and
one goal each by MacMahon anrl
Adams, made up the Stanford score.
The single point of the Barbs was
rung up by Ring, who in an attempt to
save was forced over the line by Wal
lace.
Of the Stanford backfield, Ring
played remarkably well at the net and
Reynolds at left full put up his usual
strong defense, as did Eyer on the
right. Captain Boyle, at center, was
always in the thick of the fight, aftd
played good ball, especially during the
second half. Aggressiveness, combined
with speedy dribbling, marked the
work of the Cardinal forward divis
ion. N. K. Ford at left wing was eas
ily the star, and showed up better thaif
at any time this season.
