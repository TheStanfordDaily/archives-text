# Queen For Credit? Sure!
## If at U.C., Why Not Here? 
### 
If you invite one of your best-loved
professors to accompany you for a
long walk, what are you doing? There
is but one answer—hiking for credit.
Frankly speaking, that is an efficient
way of getting the most out of one's
time.
Efficiency, over at Berkeley, is the
science and art and happy faculty of
getting the most out of the least. With
the aid of their happy faculty, Cali
fornia has authorized hiking for credit.
Hiking is on the curriculum now.
Given an agreeable maiden, a cer
tain hour, and the sanction of the "in
structor" in hiking, you set out for the
open, and come back with credit on
the books of the pedagogical corpora
tion.
Which is the proper way of hiking
for credit?
A gentle suggestion might make it
possible for Stanford "nature-lovers"
to be granted, say, an hour a semester
for a weekly hike to say—Chapeets;
or two hours for a seminar in walking
down to Dumbarton bridge or King's
Mountain, every Saturday.
The idea should not perish—effici
ency is not to be scoffed at.
