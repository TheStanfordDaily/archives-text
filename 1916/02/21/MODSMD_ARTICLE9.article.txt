# Sociology Club Undertakes Survey
## To Investigate Social, Economic and Educational Conditions of Palo Alto 
### 
A survey of the social, educational
and economic conditions of Palo Alto
is to be undertaken by the members of
the Stanford Sociology Club. It was
decided to undertake this work at a
meeting of the representatives of all
of the civic organizations of Palo Alto
with the social service committee of
the Sociology Club, at the Palo Alto
High school, Friday evening. Many
needed reforms and improvements are
expected to follow from this survey.
.Motive of Action.
This movement is the outcome of a
desire on the part of the Sociology So
ciety to become a factor of practical
value in local community life. At the
close of last semester a series of in
vestigations into local conditions was
planned by the society, and this has
developed into the present plan of
co-operation with civic elements in
Palo Alto in making a survey that
will be of genuine value to the com
munity.

Emphasize Educational Questions.
Educational and social conditions
will receive the closest investigation in
the projected survey. Superintendent
of Schools Nichols, urged the import
ance of getting statistics about the
children of school age in the commun
ity, and of developing some system of
vocational training, and of studying
the problem of unnecessary noises and
disturbances in the community.
A second meeting, to determine the
exact questionaire and method of pro
cedure to be used in the survey, will
be held in the near future.
