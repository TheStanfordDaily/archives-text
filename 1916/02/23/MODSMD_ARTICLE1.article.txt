Strong Stanford Defense.
A ;» to 0 whitewash for the Blue and
Gold resulted from the varsity game.
Although outplayed in both forward
and defensive divisions, the California
men put up a strong game and good
soccer was displayed throughout
Captain Boyle, at center half, and
Danny Carroll, at inside right, were
the score makers for Stanford. Rey
nolds played a splendid defensive
game at full, as did Eyer. Ring, at the
net, saved several tries, and was al
ways on the job. Ford and MacMalion
showed up well in the forward divis
ion.
For California, Hardinge and Kellas
played the strongest game. Hard luck
attended the Blue and Gold aggrega
tion in many instances, several seem
ingly sure goals being slightly over
shot.
Boyle Judged Best Player.
A spring hat offered by a Palo Alto
clothing firm to the best individual
player on the Stanford team, was
awarded to Captain Charley Boyle by
Coach Maloney and Referee Bill
Campbell. Boyle, at' center-half, was
the mainstay of the team, playing
equally brilliant on both the defensive
and the aggressive.
Clever centering by Ford placed the
ball in front of the goal, where after
a scrimmage it was received by Boyle
from Williams and shot into the net
for the first score. This was the only
score effected in the first ralf.
Danny Carroll was easily the star
of the second round, tallying both of
the points himself and always in the
thick of the fight. After a long kick
from center by Reynolds, Carroll re
ceived near California's net and
chalked up his first. Number two was
secured by him after a dribbling rush
down the length of the field, making
the final score 3 to 0.
Freshmen vs. All Grays.
A more evenly matched contest was
that staged by the California fresh
men and the Stanford All Grays. The
single score was made by the fresh
man goal keeper when he was forced
over by wing, following a rush and
scrimmage in front of the net. Both
teams showed good form and lots of
pep was displayed at all stages of the
game.
