# STANFORD PROFESSORS TELL OF BELGIUM RELIEF WORK
## CAMPUS HELP APPRECIATED Kellogg and Seward Recount Impressions of Scenes in Stricken Land 
### 
"Belgium knows of the great part
played by Stanford in the relief of
I her stricken people, and is grateful to
j the University for its help," said Pro
fessor V. L. Kellogg in his talk to the
students in assembly this morning.
: "More than one-fourth of those en
gaged in this work come from the
state of California," he continued,
i"and of these, one-half owe allegiance
to Stanford."
After paying a tribute to H. C.
Hoover, '95, who .has borne the brunt
, of the relief work since the beginning,
Professor Kellogg proceeded to tell of
I the work of the commission in saving
the people from starvation. "Isolation
spelled ruin to this small country, for
she depends upon her commerce for
j life. She is encompassed, to use the
picturesque magazine phrase, by a
band of steel, which kept out the im
ports so essential to Belgian life.
Some way had to be found to get food
to the destitute people.
One Port Opened.
"Finally, through the efforts of the
commission, the belligerents were per
suaded to open one port, Rotterdam,
through which supplies could be im
ported for the civil population. In
November, 1914, the commission start
ed shipping through Rotterdam, and
has continued to do so ever since, to
the extent of 125,000 tons of food stuff
per month. More than $100,000,000
worth of supplies has been imported
to date, $25,000,000 of which represents
the charity of the world.
Belgians Also Hoi)).
"The Belgians do not want charity
except as they have to take it. They
pay what they can, and to those who
have nothing the food is given free of
charge. The commission is endeavor
ing to keep the people busy, and have
succeeded in getting permission to
import material enough to keep the
lace industry alive. Thus a little is
added to the help which the people
can give."
Professor Seward Follows.
Professor S. S. Seward, who has
been closely connected with the busi
ness of distributing food in the north
ern part of France and Belgium, fol
lowed Professor Kellogg. He dwelt
more on the personal aspects of the
situation, recounting several touching
instances of gratitude to the United
States.
"The commission has given Belgium
a new side and a spiritual experience,"
he declared. "The gratitude of the
people is? what impressed me most.
They not only express their apprecia
tion by the spoken word, but show it
in many thoughtful actions."
Embroidered Sacks.
Professor Seward presented some
concrete examples of their gratitude
in the form of beautifully embroidered
sacks â€”flour sacks in which the food
that keeps them alive is sent. The
expert workmen have perpetuated the
various prosaic designs and letters
in vari-colored silks, turning the sacks
into pollow covers and center pieces.
One piece bearing the words "Belgian
Relief Flour" and made into a cover
for a desk blotter, was presented to
Professor Seward personally by a Bel
gian mother out of gratitude to him
for helping her little son learn the
English language. Another striking
testimony of gratitude was the memor
izing of "The Star Spangled Banner."
by a chorus of little Belgian children.
Chancellor Jordan presided at the
assembly and introduced the speakers.
