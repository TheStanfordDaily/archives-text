# Retain Basketball
## 
### 
We declare now in favor of a stu
dent vote on the question of making
basketball a major sport. This is a
matter portentious to the student
body and sufficient interest has been
aroused to warrant giving all of the
students a chance to register their
opinions on it.
# * * *
13ut we also sincerely hope that that
vote goes in favor of retaining basket
ball as a major sport. Those who
have been following the game since
basketball started at Stanford know
that there are few contests in any
sport which are held more fatiguing
and require more skill than a hard
basketball game.
# * * *
The chief argument that has been
made in favor of lowering the stand
ard of basketball is that Stanford is
not winning this year. But that fault
can't be laid to the men who make up
the squad. They've been giving all
they had all season and they've had
a lot to give. But with no coach it
has been impossible for them to win
against the well trained aggregations
which they have met.
* * * *
Many circumstances joined to make
it impossible to secure a coach for the
basketball team this year. But that
handicap will be removed before next
season and the Stanford squad will
start out with a coach and an even
break with any team on the coast, if
basketball remains a major sport.
* * * *
Every team which the Stanford five
meets in the Pacific Coast Conference
is a major sport aggregation. Stan
lord will only have an even chance to
win when the members of the Stanford
team are given the same reward for
fighting as their opponents, and when
basketball players have the same in
centive to come to Stanford and go
out for the game as they are given
by other colleges.
• * * *
College basketball is being given
more attention on the sporting pages
this year than college baseball. Few
people on the outside will know or
care whether or not the game is a
major sport at Stanford and followers
of basketball will rest their verdict
on Stanford athletics solely on the
scores published.
* ♦ * *
The issue is a bigger one than that
of making basketball a major or minor
sport. If an election is held it will
be necessary to decide whether or not
Stanford will continue to play basket
ball in the Pacific Coast Conference
with any chance of winning.
