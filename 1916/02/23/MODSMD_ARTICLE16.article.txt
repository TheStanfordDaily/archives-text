For the first time in two years the
Stanford Glee Club under the direc

Saturday night at the Assembly Hall.
The club will repeat the program
which they gave on their successful
tour of the Hawaiian Islands during
the Christmas vacation, consisting
of some unusual stunts and novel
ties besides a varied offering of songs.
An innovation in prices has been de
termined on, and for the first time on
the campus popular prices of seventy
five and fifty cents will prevail; the
lower section of the hall being reserv
ed at the fromer price and the remain
der of the hall will be fifty cents. A
percentage of the receipts from the
concert will be given to help send the
track team and crew east. Tickets
are now on sale at the Bookstore and
Weingartner's.
