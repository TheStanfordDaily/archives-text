Duck, hoys; duck!
Watch out where yer at;
And move hack a mile or two —
Casey's at the hat!
—Old Folk Song.
It used to run along something like
that, hut now the name's been changed
to Castle. There's a scouting party
up around the milky way tonight,
looking for Otis Castle, '14. He
copped six stars. Glance at the
heavens and you will see we counted
correctly. That's why there's conster
nation in one of the constellations
above. Castle is also Student Adviser.
For six years—even while editor of
The Daily I'alo Alto —Castle has play
ed consistent ball on the nine of Delta
Chi Fraternity. Yesterday Delta Chi
played Delta Tan Delta, and won—
through the ability of Castle with the
hickory.
Now there's a story that Delta Chi
papas and mammas will tell to coming
Delta Chis —as they sit before the fire
place—the story of Castle at. the bat.
They will tell how, in the great game
with Delta Tau, with the score 8-fi
in the last of the ninth, Castle took
one swing that brought in two runs
and tied the score.
Last night Delta Chi granted Castle
six stars in recognition of his faithful
services as a diamond light for nearly
a decade.
