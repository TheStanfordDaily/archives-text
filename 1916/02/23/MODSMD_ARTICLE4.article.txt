# Mission Five Defeats Varsity Quintet, 38-20
## Cardinal Outclassed By Superior Playing of Santa Clara Team 
### 
Santa Clara's varsity basketball
team on Monday evening defeated the
Stanford quintet in their second game
of the season by a 38-20 score. The
Missionites held the lead all the way.
Their victory was the result of super
ior speed and basket shooting. They
passed over the varsity's heads and
kept the ball in their possession most
of the time.
The Stanford lineup at the begin
ning of the game showed a slight
change with Farrar at guard in place
of Caughey, the latter going in at the
beginning of th?i second half. Wat
son substituted lor Worthy in the
second half and played his usual
scrappy game. Blodget was the star
of the Stanford five, scoring twelve of
the varsity 'points. His foul shooting
was the best displayed by a local
player this season, making eight out
of nine tries in the second half.
Diaz, the Santa Clara football star,
had eighteen points to his credit in
the final scoring. His carefree man
ner of shooting baskets and fouls was
enough to take the heart out of any
team. Raftes and Mulholland were
the other stars, each scoring eight
points. Mulholland played n stellar
game at guard. The half time score
was 17-8.
