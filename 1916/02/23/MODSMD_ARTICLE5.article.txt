# Coach Guerena Cuts Freshman Oar Squad
## 
### 
Coach Guerena has made the first
cut of the season in the freshman
crew squad, reducing the number of
nineteeners out for positions as oars
men to twenty-three. Of the light
weights out for a berth as coxswain,
five will be retained on the crew list.
