# PLANS MADE FOR SIXTH ANNUAL FOUNDERS' DAY BANQUET
## IN CLUB HOUSE MARCH 9 Miss Edith R. Mirrielees, '07, Appointed Chairman of General Committee 
### 
Plans for the sixth annual Founders'
Day dinner, to be given in the
Women's Club House on the evening
of March 9, are already well under
way. The general committee which
will have charge of all arrangements
for the affair, has been named. Miss
Edith R. Mirrielees, *07, of the English
department, was appointed chairman
of the committee by the Executive
Committee of the Alumni Association.
She has chosen as co-workers, Mrs.
E. W. Smith. '02, Mrs. W. H. Shock
ley, '02, Miss Eileen Everett, '14, B. W.
Crandall. '07, and O. H. Castle, '14.
Though details have not been an
nounced, the dinner is set for 6:30
o'clock, and will be followed by an
informal dance. Since its origin, six
years ago, with a banquet of the
Alumni Association at the Palace
Hotel, the Founders' Day dinner has
become the big occasion of the year
for the getting together of students,
alumni and faculty. At the first din
ner, but eighty-five persons were in
attendance, while at the meeting in
the Club House, last year, over three
hundred were present. The popularity
of the dinner has been growing each
year, consequently the committee is
planning for a larger dinner than any
of those previously held.
Plan Interesting Program.
The members of the general com
mittee, working in conjunction with
Assistant Registrar J. E. McDowell,
'00, are planning an interesting pro
gram of speeches and entertainments
for the evening of the dinner. Various
officers of the Stanford faculty will
lie called upon to add to the enjoy
ment of the evening. All efforts are
being bent to arrange a program
which will eliminate all tendency to
ward formality. Not the least of the
problems of the committee is the plan
ning of a menu which will receive the
commendation of campus epicures.
,\Â«l<ls Importance To Day.
Although March 9 has been officially
celebrated as Founders' Day since the
opening of the University, up to 1911
the program was largely confined to
speeches in the Assembly Hall. Since
the addition of the banquet to the
day's events, the occasion has become
of even greater importance, as by
means of the dinner all factions of
the University community are brought
together for a pleasant evening. In
the last few years the percentage of
undergratduates attending the dinner
has grown rapidly, although many
alumni return to the campus each
year in order to be present at the an
nual get-together.
