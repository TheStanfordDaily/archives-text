# Sequoia Adopts Professional Air
## Hettinger, Doris Estcourt, Ruth Sampson, Nellita Choate, Stamford and Griffin Contribute 
### F. E. HILL, '11 
If there were anything delightfully
bad about the February Sequoia, I am
sure that the business manager would
hail with delight any outcry which I
might make against it. Assault and
battery, in the case of a journal, seems
inevitably to make the assaulted and
battered one beloved. I must frankly
confess, however, that after reading
the Stanford magazine from cover to
cover, without a pause, 1 left it with
the feeling that while the reading it
presented was not exactly the same
kind as our professional magazines
present, the contents, in many in
stances, was as well written and as
interesting as that which we find on
file in our libraries or purchase at
our news stands. And my viewpoint,
1 feel, is not that of an instructor in
the English department.
"To Europe with Ford," by A. J.
Hettinger; "Metamorphosis." by Miss
Ruth Sampson; "The Passing of the
Dream City," by Miss Doris Estcourt,
and the editorials, cover the field of
events and philosophy concerning
events. Hettinger's article presents
a new side of the Ford venture. Tt is
regrettable that a fuller picture of the
expedition as a business affair is not
given; we can only console ourselves
with the latter part of the article,
