# Sequoia Adopts Professional Air
## Hettinger, Doris Estcourt, Ruth Sampson, Nellita Choate, Stamford and Griffin Contribute 
### F. E. HILL, '11 
If there were anything delightfully
bad about the February Sequoia, I am
sure that the business manager would
hail with delight any outcry which I
might make against it. Assault and
battery, in the case of a journal, seems
inevitably to make the assaulted and
battered one beloved. I must frankly
confess, however, that after reading
the Stanford magazine from cover to
cover, without a pause, 1 left it with
the feeling that while the reading it
presented was not exactly the same
kind as our professional magazines
present, the contents, in many in
stances, was as well written and as
interesting as that which we find on
file in our libraries or purchase at
our news stands. And my viewpoint,
1 feel, is not that of an instructor in
the English department.
"To Europe with Ford," by A. J.
Hettinger; "Metamorphosis." by Miss
Ruth Sampson; "The Passing of the
Dream City," by Miss Doris Estcourt,
and the editorials, cover the field of
events and philosophy concerning
events. Hettinger's article presents
a new side of the Ford venture. Tt is
regrettable that a fuller picture of the
expedition as a business affair is not
given; we can only console ourselves
with the latter part of the article,
which does tell us something of the
workings of the party and of Mr. Ford
himself. Miss Sampson's contribution
is a moving picture of the Stanford
student from the time he is hatcher
as a freshman chick until he Haps his
wings as a cockerel for the last time,
and undertakes the responsibilities of
maturity. I think Stanford students
will find the picture interesting. They
might find it profitable, too, but they
probably will not.
"Passing of Dream City."
"The Passing of the Dream City"
tells us in a scant eight hundred words
things about the exposition—things
that most of us had not thought of.
After passing from this refreshingly
idealistic essay we ought to feel
ashamed of our fellow collegians
when we read the editorial on "Paper
Hag Wit and Pickles." Stanford dra
matics and the question of Stanford
snobbery also come up for editorial
discussion.
Staniford Wins Prize.
"The Elusive Angel," the Sequoia's
prize story, by W. P. Staniford, '16,
heads the fiction department. It is a
story of strange turns and refreshing
realism in contrast with worlds be
yond this world. All Stanford will
be interested to know what happens
to a rough when he goes to heaven.
It is not always heavenly in heaven,
suggests Paul Staniford, as he leaves
the hero defeated in a fateful round
of poker by no less a personage than
St. Peter himself.
"Over the Dishwater," by Miss Xel
lita C'hoate, and "Entrenched," by
Ceroid Robinson, are vivid sketches.
(■riftin Writes Poem.
R. A. Griffin gives us a decidedly
dramatic thrill in"The Eleventh
Hour." The verse is realism itself —
though we hasten to protest that we
have not run the gamut of the hero's
experience! The phrase, "His sight
and sound of voice," is a distinct
blemish in a poem which otherwise
would be excellent as a profesional
production. Miss Curry's "Song,"
while less daring than Mr. Griffin's
contribution, is a perfect bit of work.

Staniford Wins Prize.
"The Elusive Angel," the Sequoia's
prize story, by W. P. Staniford, '16,
heads the fiction department. It is a
story of strange turns and refreshing
realism in contrast with worlds be
yond this world. All Stanford will
be interested to know what happens
to a rough when he goes to heaven.
It is not always heavenly in heaven,
suggests Paul Staniford, as he leaves
the hero defeated in a fateful round
of poker by no less a personage than
St. Peter himself.
"Over the Dishwater," by Miss Xel
lita C'hoate, and "Entrenched," by
Ceroid Robinson, are vivid sketches.
(■riftin Writes Poem.
R. A. Griffin gives us a decidedly
dramatic thrill in"The Eleventh
Hour." The verse is realism itself —
though we hasten to protest that we
have not run the gamut of the hero's
experience! The phrase, "His sight
and sound of voice," is a distinct
blemish in a poem which otherwise
would be excellent as a profesional
production. Miss Curry's "Song,"
while less daring than Mr. Griffin's
contribution, is a perfect bit of work.
If there were anything delightfully
bad about the February Sequoia, I am
sure that the business manager would
hail with delight any outcry which I
might make against it. Assault and
battery, in the case of a journal, seems
inevitably to make the assaulted and
battered one beloved. I must frankly
confess, however, that after reading
the Stanford magazine from cover to
cover, without a pause, 1 left it with
the feeling that while the reading it
presented was not exactly the same
kind as our professional magazines
present, the contents, in many in
stances, was as well written and as
interesting as that which we find on
file in our libraries or purchase at
our news stands. And my viewpoint,
1 feel, is not that of an instructor in
the English department.
"To Europe with Ford," by A. J.
Hettinger; "Metamorphosis." by Miss
Ruth Sampson; "The Passing of the
Dream City," by Miss Doris Estcourt,
and the editorials, cover the field of
events and philosophy concerning
events. Hettinger's article presents
a new side of the Ford venture. Tt is
regrettable that a fuller picture of the
expedition as a business affair is not
given; we can only console ourselves
with the latter part of the article,
which does tell us something of the
workings of the party and of Mr. Ford
himself. Miss Sampson's contribution
is a moving picture of the Stanford
student from the time he is hatcher
as a freshman chick until he Haps his
wings as a cockerel for the last time,
and undertakes the responsibilities of
maturity. I think Stanford students
will find the picture interesting. They
might find it profitable, too, but they
probably will not.
"Passing of Dream City."
"The Passing of the Dream City"
tells us in a scant eight hundred words
things about the exposition—things
that most of us had not thought of.
After passing from this refreshingly
idealistic essay we ought to feel
ashamed of our fellow collegians
when we read the editorial on "Paper
Hag Wit and Pickles." Stanford dra
matics and the question of Stanford
snobbery also come up for editorial
discussion.
