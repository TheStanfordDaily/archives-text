# CARDINAL NINE IS VICTOR OVER SANTA CLARA
## FINAL SCORE READS 10 TO 8 Fast Plays and Heavy Slugging Thrill Crowd on Mission Town Diamond 
### 
Heavy hitting on the part of the
Stanford varsity baseball team, com
bined with errors at crucial moments
by their opponents, gave the Cardinal
a 10 to 8 victory over the Santa Clara
first string aggregation, on the Mis
sion Town diamond yesterday after
noon. The game was sensational
from the time the "Umps" called play
ball until the last man was thrown
out in the ninth. Catches that cut off
sure hits and excellent base running
featured. A large crowd yelled itself
hoarse at the close decisions and fast
stops.
Beside these thrill-getting plays
the contest was made exciting because
of the fact that the final outcome was
always in doubt. Stanford took the
lead in the first inning, making three
runs on two hits, two walks, two
stolen bases, and an error. This was
the end of Mr. Hickey, who essayed to
do the twirling act for the Catholic
contingent. He was replaced by Roy
Bliss, the sensation of this year's
games thus far. "Thus far" must
really mean, as far as the Cardinal
game and no farther, for southpaw
Bliss was in hot water most of the
game yesterday.
Nothing was accomplished by either
team in the second, but the wearers of
the Red and White tied up the count in
the third frame on two singles, a two
bagger, and a walk. Stanford again
commanded a three-run lead at the
close of the fourth, on two singles, a
two-bagger, a single, and an error.
In the eighth, on three singles, one
counter came across, and not satisfied
with nine scores, the varsity sneaked
another tally over the pan in the last
inning, on two errors, and the same
number of infield outs.
Santa Clara Scores.
Santa Clara's other runs were gath
ered in the last half of the game.
They squeezed over one in the fifth
on a single, a stolen base, and an er
ror. Two caine in on two infield hits,
two pilfered sacks, and a wild heave
in the next frame, and the last two
tallies were scored in the eighth, when
the Mission Town nine took to Hoe
ver's offerings for three bingles in a
row, necessitating the substitution of
Wickersham as the Cardinal twirler.

Heavy hitting on the part of the
Stanford varsity baseball team, com
bined with errors at crucial moments
by their opponents, gave the Cardinal
a 10 to 8 victory over the Santa Clara
first string aggregation, on the Mis
sion Town diamond yesterday after
noon. The game was sensational
from the time the "Umps" called play
ball until the last man was thrown
out in the ninth. Catches that cut off
sure hits and excellent base running
featured. A large crowd yelled itself
hoarse at the close decisions and fast
stops.
Beside these thrill-getting plays
the contest was made exciting because
of the fact that the final outcome was
always in doubt. Stanford took the
lead in the first inning, making three
runs on two hits, two walks, two
stolen bases, and an error. This was
the end of Mr. Hickey, who essayed to
do the twirling act for the Catholic
contingent. He was replaced by Roy
Bliss, the sensation of this year's
games thus far. "Thus far" must
really mean, as far as the Cardinal
game and no farther, for southpaw
Bliss was in hot water most of the
game yesterday.
Nothing was accomplished by either
team in the second, but the wearers of
the Red and White tied up the count in
the third frame on two singles, a two
bagger, and a walk. Stanford again
commanded a three-run lead at the
close of the fourth, on two singles, a
two-bagger, a single, and an error.
In the eighth, on three singles, one
counter came across, and not satisfied
with nine scores, the varsity sneaked
another tally over the pan in the last
inning, on two errors, and the same
number of infield outs.
Santa Clara Scores.
Santa Clara's other runs were gath
ered in the last half of the game.
They squeezed over one in the fifth
on a single, a stolen base, and an er
ror. Two caine in on two infield hits,
two pilfered sacks, and a wild heave
in the next frame, and the last two
tallies were scored in the eighth, when
the Mission Town nine took to Hoe
ver's offerings for three bingles in a
row, necessitating the substitution of
Wickersham as the Cardinal twirler.

bined with errors at crucial moments
by their opponents, gave the Cardinal
a 10 to 8 victory over the Santa Clara
first string aggregation, on the Mis
sion Town diamond yesterday after
noon. The game was sensational
from the time the "Umps" called play
ball until the last man was thrown
out in the ninth. Catches that cut off
sure hits and excellent base running
featured. A large crowd yelled itself
hoarse at the close decisions and fast
stops.
Beside these thrill-getting plays
the contest was made exciting because
of the fact that the final outcome was
always in doubt. Stanford took the
lead in the first inning, making three
runs on two hits, two walks, two
stolen bases, and an error. This was
the end of Mr. Hickey, who essayed to
do the twirling act for the Catholic
contingent. He was replaced by Roy
Bliss, the sensation of this year's
games thus far. "Thus far" must
really mean, as far as the Cardinal
game and no farther, for southpaw
Bliss was in hot water most of the
game yesterday.
Nothing was accomplished by either
team in the second, but the wearers of
the Red and White tied up the count in
the third frame on two singles, a two
bagger, and a walk. Stanford again
commanded a three-run lead at the
close of the fourth, on two singles, a
two-bagger, a single, and an error.
In the eighth, on three singles, one
counter came across, and not satisfied
with nine scores, the varsity sneaked
another tally over the pan in the last
inning, on two errors, and the same
number of infield outs.
Santa Clara Scores.
Santa Clara's other runs were gath
ered in the last half of the game.
They squeezed over one in the fifth
on a single, a stolen base, and an er
ror. Two caine in on two infield hits,
two pilfered sacks, and a wild heave
in the next frame, and the last two
tallies were scored in the eighth, when
the Mission Town nine took to Hoe
ver's offerings for three bingles in a
row, necessitating the substitution of
Wickersham as the Cardinal twirler.
