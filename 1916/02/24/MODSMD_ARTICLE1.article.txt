# SOPHOMORE COTILLION AND JUNIOR PROM HOLD TO ONE
## FORMALS TO STOP AT TWELVE Senior Women Asked to Wear Caps and Gowns on Assembly Days 
### 
Junior Proms and Sophomore Cotil
lions may be continued until 1 o'clock,
subject to the approval of the Univer
sity authorities. This was the decis
ion made by the Women's Conference
last night, concerning the measure
passed by the Men's Conference and
referred to the women for approval,
which would have allowed all campus
dances to close at 1 o'clock. Discus
sion concerning the including of for
mats in the 1 o'clock rule, resulted in
a 13-2 vote against the proposition.
Members of Conference felt that there
would be objection to dancing on Sun
day morning, which would necessitate
the holding of all formals on Friday
night, and it would be impossible to
get them all in. The question of what
is and what is not a formal would
then come up. And in conclusion they
could see no reason why dances could
not begin earlier instead of lasting
later.
It was decided that La Liana be
granted one closed date a year instead
of one a semester as decided at the
last meeting. The date for this year
will be March 25.
Women's Conference will endeavor
to reinstate the custom of having Sen
iors wear caps and gowns on flays of
assemblies and of sitting in the Sen
ior section. Senior women are asked
to eo-operate in this matter.
