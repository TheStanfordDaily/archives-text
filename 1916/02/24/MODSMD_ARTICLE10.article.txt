# "A Pair of Sixes" Chosen by Senior Farce Committee
## Will Be Staged In Assembly Hall On May 17 
### 
"A Pair of Sixes" has been chosen
by the Senior Farce committee for the
1916 production, which will be given
in the Assembly Hall on May 17. The
play, controlled by the American
Play company, is an interesting piece
of farce comedy of New York produc
tion, not quite four years old. From
the opening scene, where a partition
separates two offices, the shifts are
unique, and scenic effects add to its
charm.
Tryouts will be conducted by the
coach, Frank L. Mathieu, on the af
ternoons of March 6 and 7. at the
Women's Club House. Final selection
of the cast wili be left entirely in the
director's hands. This method has
been decided upon by the committee
to guarantee the selection of a cast
on the basis of individual ability.
The cast is a small one with no
unimportant parts. Individual work
will be possible, as all parts will be
assigned before spring vacation.
Everyone is eligible to try out.
