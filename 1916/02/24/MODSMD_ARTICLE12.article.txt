# MASS MEETING IS SET FOR BASKETBALL DISCUSSION
## TO BE HELD IN UNION TUESDAY R.L. Murray Appointed to Represent Stanford at I.C. A.A.A.A. Meeting 
### 
A mass meeting of the student body
will be held next Tuesday evening in
the Union for the purpose of discus
sing basketball as a major sport at
Stanford. At this time the men of the
University will be given an opportun
ity to advance arguments on both sides
of the question, "Resolved, That bas
ketball be reduced to its former status
as a minor activity." The meeting has
been arranged by the Executive Com
mittee in answer to a petition signed
by 82 men, asking that the committee
rescind its recent action raising bas
ketball to the dignity of a major sport,
or, in lieu of this, that the students
be allowed to vote on the matter.
Will Not Rescind Action.
The Executive Committee last night
refused to rescind its action, the mem
bers feeling that the problem is one
which should be decided by the stu
dent body. Tt is therefore likely that
a vote will be held on the Quad next
Wednesday to test the sentiment of the
students and decide the status of bas
ketball.
Murray sit I. C. A. A. A. A.
R. L. Murray, '13, was appointed to
represent Stanford at the I. C. A. A. A.
A. conference, which will be held at
New York on March 4, with power to
apply for admittance to the associa
tion. Stanford has not yet been form-
ally admitted, and membership must
be obtained before the Cardinal track
men can compete in the eastern meet.
The committee also voted to send a
letter of congratulation to Murray for
winning the National Indoor Tennis
Championship.
Itlodget Given Gold Fob.
W. B. Blodget, captain of basketball,
was awarded a gold baseball fob in
appreciation of his services to the
squad. Blodget has acted as coach
throughout the present season, and has
always been a hard and faithful
worker for the good of basketball.
Peanut League Cup.
C. A. Thomas, '92, was given a vote
of thanks for his donation toward the
purchase of a trophy for the winning
baseball peanut league team. Thomas
played 011 the varsity football team
while at Stanford. It was decided to
purchase a cup.
A motion that the action of the com
mittee in declaring freshmen ineligible
to play in preliminary games be re
scinded, was lost. This action was
taken two weeks ago, it being felt
that the spirit of the freshmen rule
should not be broken by playing the
first year men in other than Cali
fornia games.
