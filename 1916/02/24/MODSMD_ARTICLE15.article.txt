Speaking of queening, why not con
sider the fund for sending the crew
and track team east when making that
date? The student body is making a
big appeal to the alumni now to help
raise money to finance these trips.
Later 011 the students will have to
make personal contributions. Money
that's raised now on benefits will les
sen the amount that will have to be
extracted the last minute when the
possibility of sending teams is hang
ing in the balance for lack of funds.
The crew dance netted $120, and
that's a decidedly worth while sum,
but from what the people who attend
ed have to say the total amount of
joy dispensed that night was worth
two or three times that much.
There are going to be other chances
to help out and enjoy ones self at the
same time, during the semester. Two
occasions that can be considered right
now are the Glee Club show on Sat
urday night, and the track dance on
March S, the night before Founders'
Day.
Tf you happen to be a non-queener
on principle, just remember that doors
are open to anybody with fifty or sev
enty-five cents, and you can bring
along another gent with you.
