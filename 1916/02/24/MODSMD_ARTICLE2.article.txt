a home-coming, after two years' non

that has carried the Stanford name
into the far corners of the world.
They have come forward generously
and have offered a large portion of
the receipts which will accrue from
the concert to the track team and
crew that they may go east and com

An unheard of innovation will be
carried out in this concert in that, the
price of seats has been reduced to the
level of seventy-five and fifty cents,

"hula-hula" Hawaiian melodies on
their vacation trips and will show
Stanford some real Hawaiian harmony
in a real Hawaiian stunt act.
The C.lce Club has lots of entertain
ing songs which have proved a great
success with previous audiences this
year.
Dick Morgan will appear in the
"ragtime song review," that made such
a hit in Honolulu. He will be assisted
by the C.lee Club in some of the very
