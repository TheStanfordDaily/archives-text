# Glee Club to Chirp Hawaiian Melodies
## Program For Saturday's Concert Includes Three Novelty Stunts 
### 
Stanford's song birds will sing the
same songs and her stunt men will
perform the same stunts to delight
the audience which will attend the
Glee Club show at the Assembly Hall,
next Saturday niu;ht, which delighted
enthusiastic audiences down in the
land of the ukulele, during the last
Christmas vacation.
The concert will be in the nature of
a home-coming, after two years' non
appearance on the campus, of a club
that has carried the Stanford name
into the far corners of the world.
They have come forward generously
and have offered a large portion of
the receipts which will accrue from
the concert to the track team and
crew that they may go east and com
pete.
An unheard of innovation will be
carried out in this concert in that, the
price of seats has been reduced to the
level of seventy-five and fifty cents,
which reduces the cost of "â– queening"
considerably.
The boys picked up some regular
"hula-hula" Hawaiian melodies on
their vacation trips and will show
Stanford some real Hawaiian harmony
in a real Hawaiian stunt act.
The C.lce Club has lots of entertain
ing songs which have proved a great
success with previous audiences this
year.
Dick Morgan will appear in the
"ragtime song review," that made such
a hit in Honolulu. He will be assisted
by the C.lee Club in some of the very
latest song hits and stunts.
The well known stringed quintette
composed of R. Coleman, R. Johnson,
.T. Stearns. L. Chandler, and M. Barnes,
will give some snappy ragtime selec
tions.
The twenty-five men who will take
part in Saturday night's show have
been nnder the direction of L. H.
Eaton, and are in prime shape for the
event. They will be led in the concert
by C. F. Joyce, '16.
L. .T. Farrer, '17, the manager of the
Glee Club, has been working hard to
make the Home Concert a success, and
is hoping that they may be able to
come up to Squire Behren's expecta
tions and turn over a very material
sum to the crew and track. He states
that some good tickets are still to be
had at the Bookstore or at Weingart
ner's, in Palo Alto.
