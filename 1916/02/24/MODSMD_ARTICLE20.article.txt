### 
Baseball Coach Harry Wolter is very
much pleased with the showing made
by the varsity in the last two games.
In the Santa Clara contest, the team
slugged the ball hard and maintained
a commanding lead most of the time.
In the game against the Ambrose Tail
ors, the whole team was in the game
at all stages, fielding in sensational
style, and hitting when hits meant
runs.
"Doc" Hayes is playing a hangup
game around the first base cushion.
His fielding is of high order, stopping
many throws that seem to be headed
for some place in the right field
bleachers.
—o —
Captain "Babe" Dent is certainly a
valuable addition to the ball club. He
not only holds up his end behind the
log, but hits them on the nose and
feteals an average of two bases a game.
—o —
The infield as it now stands, Hayes,
Stafford. Stevens, and Braden, seems
to be the best combination that has
worked out so far this spring. Um
pire Jack McCarthy, as well as Cap
tain Powers of the Ambrose Tailors,
says that the California team is much
weaker this year, and that the Card
inal squad looks to nave at least an
oven break for the series. If the de
fense of the varsity can be bolstered
up, with the hitting strength that has
been shown thus far, a winner should
be turned out on the local campus
this year.

Palo Alto High school nine was
handed a trouncing at thehands of the
freshman squad, yesterday, on auxil
iary field. Kayser, a new recruit for
the freshmen, pitched a good, steady
game, allowing only four hits, scat
tered through as many innings. Morse,
on the mound for Palo Alto, struck out
eleven men, but errors on the part of
his teammates caused their defeat.

Baseball Coach Harry Wolter is very
much pleased with the showing made
by the varsity in the last two games.
In the Santa Clara contest, the team
slugged the ball hard and maintained
a commanding lead most of the time.
In the game against the Ambrose Tail
ors, the whole team was in the game
at all stages, fielding in sensational
style, and hitting when hits meant
runs.
"Doc" Hayes is playing a hangup
game around the first base cushion.
His fielding is of high order, stopping
many throws that seem to be headed
for some place in the right field
bleachers.
—o —
Captain "Babe" Dent is certainly a
valuable addition to the ball club. He
not only holds up his end behind the
log, but hits them on the nose and
feteals an average of two bases a game.

The infield as it now stands, Hayes,
Stafford. Stevens, and Braden, seems
to be the best combination that has
worked out so far this spring. Um

says that the California team is much
