# Latest Book of Dr. Jordan on War Is Off the Press

"There are three kinds of peace,"
says David Starr Jordan in his latest
book, "Ways to Lasting Peace."
"There is the peace of contentment,
typified by the dove. There is the
armed peace, the peace of balanced
hate, typified l>y the watchful hyena.
And there is, lastly, the permanence
of law, the peace typified by the
guardian St. Bernard." To this last
Dr. Jordan pins his faith.
"Ways to Lasting Peace" is a com
parative study —a digest of the
thought of nations. To the views of
men from many countries, Chancellor
Jordan has added his own ideas. The
eight chapters include: "The Present
Crisis." "Women and War," "Resolu
tions of Congress," "Peace Manifes
tos," "Individuals and Peace," "The
Case Against War," and "World Fed
eration."
Tlic Primal Motive.
Under the heading, "Reaction
Against Democracy," the author says:
"In my judgment tne primal motive
behind the great war was largely in
ternal and political. It is part of the
age-long struggle against privilege.
One by one the nations have taken
away the prerequisites of the classes
that rule by inherited right."
"Little by little in every nation, lib
erty and democracy have encroached
on privilege and aristocracy. In every
country freedom slowly broadens
down from precedent to precedent.
And as freedom broadens, the scope
of aristocracy must narrow."
These causes, Dr. Jordan holds, are
of vastly grater importance than the
reasons usually put forth—of economic
motives, and of motives of interna
tional distrust, envy and hate.
