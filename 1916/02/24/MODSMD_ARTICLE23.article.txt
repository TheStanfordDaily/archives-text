Campus improvement will be tbe
slogan of the business office during
the next few months and in keeping
with this policy work has already
commenced around the corners of the
Quad. Rich soil is now being hauled
in and before the semester is over
walks will have been laid out and
shrubbery, vines and flowers planted.
The spaces will not be filled by a
lawn as was announced last semester.
