# STANFORD FIVE TO MEET U.C.
## Rival Quintets Clash on Local Gym Floor Tomorrow Night 
### 
Stanford and California will clash
on the gymnasium lloor tomorrow
night in the lirst game of the basket
ball series. In many ways this is the
most important game of the present
season. The fact that it involves com
petition with California is the biggest
reason for its importance. To fans
perhaps the biggest >reason is the
fact that California this year has one
of the strongest teams on the Pacific
Coast, and therefore will be able to
stage a first class encounter. How
ever, the most important thing to the
Stanford student body as a whole, is
basketball's position as a major sport.
If the student body support this game
and the team gives its best basket
ball, it will in all probability be re
tained as a major sport.
Although the varsity hasn't scored
a victory in any of the important
games this season they have sent
Washington, Oregon Aggies and Ne
vada home, realizing that they had
had a tough game. What they will be
able to do against California is pure
guesswork, but it is certain that they
will put up a good fight. Although
the lineup has not been announced, it
will probably be the same as in pre
vious games. Either W. L. Seawriglit
or R. L. Rittler will referee.
