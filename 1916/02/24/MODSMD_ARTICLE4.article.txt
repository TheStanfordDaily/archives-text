# Nineteen to Jolly-Up at Encina Tomorrow
## Sophomore and Transfer Women Invited To Annual Get-Together 
### 
No one will suffer from want of an
introduction at the freshman jolly-up
which will be held at Encina Club
room next Friday evening, and to
which sophomore and transfer women
are invited. "Telephone Tags," which
are new with the class of 1919, will
provide direct connection with all who
wish to get acquainted. And that is
not the least of the innovations. The
time-old doughnuts and apple cider
have been relegated to the scrap heap,
and in their place will be served
punch and â€”but of course that is not
for publication. "Come, see, and
taste," say the freshmen.
Blumenthal's orchestra will provide
music for the tag dances. Other en
tertainment will be provided by a
quartette, composed of freshmen glee
club members, and unusual stunts pro
vided by the wits of the class. The
fee of fifty cents imposed on class
members, will be due at the door.
