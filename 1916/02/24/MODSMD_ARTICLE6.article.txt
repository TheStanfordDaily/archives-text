# DRAMATICS FOLLOWERS WOULD HAVE MORE REGULATION
## RESOLUTION SENT FACULTY Thespians Think Adoption of Suggestions Would Solve Local Play Problem 
### 
What is thought to be the proper
solution of the Stanford dramatic
problem was embraced in a resolution
drawn up yesterday afternoon at a
meeting of representatives of dramatic
organizations and class play commit
tees.
The resolution, which includes sug
gestions as to the number of plays,
time for performance, expenses, and
similar phases, has been forwarded
to Professor G. J. Peirce, chairman of
the faculty committee on public ex
ercises. It is expected that the faculty
committee will soon reach a verdict
regarding the resolution.
The resolution follows:
To clear up existing confusions as
to dates of dramatic productions, and
to avoid the over-crowding of plays
in a single semester, the following
schedule is recommended:
First Semester
Sword and Sandals, fourth Friday
after registration. Sophomore, last
Friday in October. English Club, last
Friday in November.
Second Semester
Masquers, fourth Friday after reg
istration. Junior Opera, Junior Week.
Senior Farce, Senior Week.
Ram's Head may give a football,
track, crew, or other musical show,
each year (only one show each year),
on a date to be chosen well in ad
vance, and approved by the Faculty
Committee on Public Exercises.
The above arrangement as to dates
shall, when approved by the Faculty
committee, be binding on all organiza
tions giving plays. No changes in the
dates can be made, and an organiza
tion failing to avail itself of the date
provided for it, cannot give another
play until the following year at the
regular time, set aside for it, unless
an arrangement for trading dates is
made, and approved by the Faculty
committee.
No other student organization or
outside attraction, except the Penin
sula Musical Association, shall give a
performance without the written per
mission of the Faculty committee,
given at least three weeks in advance
of the production.
Tt is urgently recommended that the
Faculty committee carefully consider
the proximity of student productions
before granting permission to any out
side attraction.
The dates above designated shall be
permanent closed dates.
Programs
There shall be no paid advertising
on the programs. (This is not intend
ed to exclude acknowledgements to
firms contributing furniture, etc).
Programs with paid advertising shall
be confiscated on the night of the per
formance if not discovered before.
Plays
The plots of all plays must be sub
mitted to the Faculty committee, to
gether with a complete scene plot,
showing the number and character of
the stage settings. It is recommended
that the Faculty committee consult
with the stage manager as to the
probable cost of producing the play
scenically, before approving the pro
duction of the same.
Advertising
It is recommended that advertising
expense be limited to fifty dollars
(sRo.oft), exclusive of programs.
It is recommended that the choosing
of casts for the various productions
be left entirely to the coach.
