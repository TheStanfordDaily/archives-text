# DRAMATICS FOLLOWERS WOULD HAVE MORE REGULATION
## RESOLUTION SENT FACULTY Thespians Think Adoption of Suggestions Would Solve Local Play Problem 
### 
What is thought to be the proper
solution of the Stanford dramatic
problem was embraced in a resolution
drawn up yesterday afternoon at a
meeting of representatives of dramatic
organizations and class play commit
tees.
The resolution, which includes sug
gestions as to the number of plays,
time for performance, expenses, and
similar phases, has been forwarded
to Professor G. J. Peirce, chairman of
the faculty committee on public ex
ercises. It is expected that the faculty
committee will soon reach a verdict
regarding the resolution.
The resolution follows:
To clear up existing confusions as
to dates of dramatic productions, and
to avoid the over-crowding of plays
in a single semester, the following
schedule is recommended:
First Semester
Sword and Sandals, fourth Friday
after registration. Sophomore, last
Friday in October. English Club, last
Friday in November.
