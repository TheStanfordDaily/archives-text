try to discuss the matter of enlarging
the membership of the club, which is
imperative if the links are to be kept
for the use of golf enthusiasts. Dr.
IT. R. Stolz, president of the club,
stated that tbo Trustees would be like
ly to revoke the privilege they had
given for the use of the ground unless
