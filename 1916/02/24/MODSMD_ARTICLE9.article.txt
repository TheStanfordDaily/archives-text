# English Club Posts Pictures of Cast
## Strong Actors To Appear In Production of 4 The Great Divide" 
### 
Pictures of the English Club play,
"The (Jreat Divide," were placed on

the Quad this
morning. They
are some of the
most striking
Dave y products
that have been
seen on the En
g i n e e r i n g and
English corners
for many a moon.
And dramatic sit
uations are as

thick in the play as they are on the
cards.
There are but three women's parts
in the play, but all call for acting
of unusual caliber. The ingenue and
the lead are to be taken by Miss Eliz
abeth Taff, '10, and Miss Nellita
Choate, '17, while the part of the
mother of the heroine will be taken
by Miss Edith Smith, '16. This role
of the typical New England mother
will afford Miss Smith an opportunity
to show an entirely different side or
her work from that in which she made
her first appearance on the Stanford
stage last May. On that occasion she
appeared as the ever-present Aunt
Selina in "Seven Days," and she more
than proved her ability to line up the
laughs one after another. In"The
Great Divide" she will handle a role
which calls for much more serious
acting.
Rehearsals are rapidly rounding act
alter act of the English Club produc
tion into shape. The situations carry
such a genuine thrill that even in the
engineering basement, where the pen
cilled scrawls on the plaster testify to
scores of college rehearsals dating
from the time when none of us were
here, even without costumes or
"props," the swing of the play keeps
the scattered spectators of the re
hearsal tense with interest.
