I
jin the other two games. This includes

I Chase, Billy Orr, Walter Mails, George
| Kelly, Eddie Burns, Swede Risberg,

| age. This will be the last appearance
of these diamond satellites this sea
j son on the local field, as most of the
; players have to go into training with
| their teams next month.
S. ('. Seconds Are Fast.
The Santa Clara second varsity is
a fast aggregation of ball tossers.
They have defeated the Catholic in
stitution varsity on two or three oc
j casions, and should give the Stanford
i freshmen a hard game. The team that
| will represent the Polytechnic High
I school is in all probability a good
club. They have won a majority of
their games in the city, and if the
dope pans out correct, the morning
battle should bo a close affair.
