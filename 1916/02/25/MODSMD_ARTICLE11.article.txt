# GLEE CLUB MEN TO SHOW HULA HULA STUNTS
## TAKE-OFFS ON HAWAIIAN LIFE Good Tickets May Still Be Obtained at the Campus Bookstore 
### 
Is it possible that the morals of the
Glee Club are not what certain fellow
travelers in the trans-Pacific voyage
of the organization would have as
believe? This seems an impossible
thought—and, yet, certain quietly in
sisting and insinuating rumors are
casting a shadow over the fair name
of those men, who, so the letter from
the Great Northern ran, "conducted
themselves as perfect gentlemen."
Within the last few days light has
been shed on certain of the forms of
amusemnt that the local songbirds
indulged in while in far-away Hawaii.
Now the startling truth stands re
vealed —the Hula Hula dance—or was
it the maidens —was the most attrac
tive. More than that, these "perfect
gentlemen," lauded to the skies as
men whom "their parents and your
University should be proud of," ac
tually succumbed to the lures of the
j entrancing hula dance and have re
i turned with every twist and turn at
i
I their command.
Most startling of all is the rumor
| that those of Stanford who did not
have the opportunity that the Glee
Club had of visiting Hawaii will be
! treated to an honest to goodness in-
I terpretation of the famous hula song
and dunce at the Glee Club concert,
scheduled for tomorrow night at the
Assembly Hall. Who will be the ve
hicle whereby Stanford will be treated
to a real hula hula dance? Ah, that
is the all-absorbing topic of the day.
Possibly Charley Joyce, or—but that
would be idle speculation. Glee Club
men go around with a wicked smile,
but they are silent on the subject.
A number of other unusual stunts
and a program of new and taking
songs have been carefully rehearsed
for Saturday's concert, which will be
the occasion of the first appearance of
the Glee Club in a home concert in
two years.
The concert is of more than usual
interest to Stanford because of the
fact that a goodly portion of the pro
ceeds of the concert will go to defray
the expenses of the crew and track
team on their eastern trips. Believ
ing that this would appeal to all as a
student body affair worthy of support,
the manager of the concert establish
ed the popular prices of seventy-five
and fifty cents for all seats. Tickets
have been on sale at the Bookstore
and Weingartner's, in Palo Alto, and
will continue to be on sale until to
morrow.

tually succumbed to the lures of the
j entrancing hula dance and have re
i turned with every twist and turn at
i
I their command.
Most startling of all is the rumor
| that those of Stanford who did not
have the opportunity that the Glee
Club had of visiting Hawaii will be
! treated to an honest to goodness in-
I terpretation of the famous hula song
and dunce at the Glee Club concert,
scheduled for tomorrow night at the
Assembly Hall. Who will be the ve
hicle whereby Stanford will be treated
to a real hula hula dance? Ah, that
is the all-absorbing topic of the day.
Possibly Charley Joyce, or—but that
would be idle speculation. Glee Club
men go around with a wicked smile,
but they are silent on the subject.
A number of other unusual stunts
and a program of new and taking
songs have been carefully rehearsed
for Saturday's concert, which will be
the occasion of the first appearance of
the Glee Club in a home concert in
two years.
The concert is of more than usual
interest to Stanford because of the
fact that a goodly portion of the pro
ceeds of the concert will go to defray
the expenses of the crew and track
team on their eastern trips. Believ
ing that this would appeal to all as a
student body affair worthy of support,
the manager of the concert establish
ed the popular prices of seventy-five
and fifty cents for all seats. Tickets
have been on sale at the Bookstore
and Weingartner's, in Palo Alto, and
will continue to be on sale until to
morrow.
