# Got Her Number? What's Her Name?
## Freshmen Devise Unique Method For Introductions At Jolly-Up Tonight In Encinn Clubroom 
### 
Upperclassnien and sophomores will
have nothing on the freshmen after
tonight. If a first year man on Encina
floor tonight sees a girl on the other
side of the room he'd like to dance
with, all he has to do is telephone to
her. And the best part of it. is, that
the other man she's with, won't get
the dopeâ€”unless he gets on the wire,
or string, or whatever the babes use
for connection. Everyone at the
"frosli" jolly-up will lie equipped with
a minature telephone.
Inasmuch as this is leap year at
certain dances, girls will do the tele
phoning. All will telephone for re
freshments at the proper time.
Strictly informal is the word given
out by the committee. It is desired
that women come in middy blouses
or other ever.v-day dress, and the men
in soft shirts.
Mr. and Mrs. ,T. E. McDowell will
act as the patrons for the affair.
