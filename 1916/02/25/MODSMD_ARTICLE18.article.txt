# RUTH JORDAN, '17, ATTACKED BY THREE MEN
## Arizona Desert Scenery Is Reproduced in "The Great Divide" 
### 
If you were Ruth and had just told
your brother that you would be per
fectly safe alone in the middle of the
Arizona desert, what would you do
if you heard some one give a long,
low whistle, just outside the window?
That is what happened to lluth .Jor
dan in"The Great Divide."
What she did was to bolt the door
and get a gun. But the three men
outside broke in the door and knocked
the gun out of her hand. And then
she stood and watched the three of
them—a Mexican, a half-breed, and
a drunken miner—as they got ready
to throw dice to see which one of
them should carry her off. Fright
ened? Yes, but she took things into
her own hands and made the best of
it. How she made the best of it is
told in the rest of the play.

This is in the first act. The sec
ond takes you to the edge of the Grand
Canyon of the Colorado, where Rill
Owens, alias Stephen Ghent, has his
shack. For this scene a new drop
curtain is being painted, the largest
which has ever been used on the As
sembly Hall stage. It is thirty feet
in height and one hundred feet long,
and will run clar round three sides
of the stage. The ledges at the edge
of the canyon will be built up on a
foundation of lumber, and the miner's
cabin will be solidly built of the real
article. It will be one of the most
ambitious sets ever put on for the
benefit of a Stanford audience.
The seat sale for"The Great Di
vide" will take place on Tuesday, at
the usual time and place.


"How shall we shake for her P* "Any damn way!"
