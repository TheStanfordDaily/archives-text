The Editor of The Daily Palo Alto.
My Dear Sir: What do you think
of the California law in regard to the
exclusion of tobacco from the High
schools and the duty of teachers in
regard to instructing pupils in the
evils of its use?
Do you think the recent smoker at
the Union for the President in keep
ing with the moral pre-eniinoncc we
have a right to expect of the Univer
sity? is it consistent with the re
quirements of the law for us to place
recent copies of the "Dippie" con
taining glowing accounts of said
smoker in the hands of High school
boys? After reading of Dr. Wilbur's
participation in such an affair and of
his recent elevation from the dean
sliip of the Medical school, how much
stock will the boy take in the preach
ments of a pigmy high school teacher
against the cigarette?
Can you? Dare you? Will you an
swer these questions?
Respectfully,
A. G. GRANT, '12
Principal Ferndale Union High school.
Editorial Comment
"Smoker" is a term used for infor
mal gatherings of men at Stanford,
and is not meant to be a word de
scriptive of the get-to-gethers. It is
a privilege of the men attending to
smoke or not, which is an almost uni
versal privilege of men of mature aÂ«e.
None of the articles concerning the
Wilbur smoker in The Daily Palo Alto
carried any praise for smoking.

Dear Editor: I see by last night's
Daily Palo Alto that my hands became
infected in the Anatomy department,
the infection became worse threaten
ing blood poison, thus causing me to
leave school. The above report is
quite accurate except as regards a
few insignificant details.

In the first place It places the Anat
omy department in an unfavorable
light. My hands did not become in
fected in the Anatomy department but
in another department. Secondly, in
stead of becoming worse, my bands
have become better. In fact, the in
fection lias completely disappeared.
Thirdly, 1 have not left school but am
still on the farm working as hard as
ever. Aside from these few correct
ions. the news report was quite cor
rect.
