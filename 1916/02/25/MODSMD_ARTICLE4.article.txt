# VOLUNTEER DRILL MAY BE INTRODUCED HERE
## Thirty-Five Men Gather to Discuss Possibility of Military Education in University 
### 
Preliminary action in a campaign to
secure opportunity for a military ed
ucation at Stanford was taken last
night, when thirty-five men gathered
to consider the probability of intro
ducing voluntary drill into the Uni
versity. Although this meeting was
without organization and of a more or
less spontaneous nature, there was an
earnestness at bottom which dispelled
all the elements of bravado and any
idea that the proposition is looked on
as a fad. There was no "glories of
war" attitude among the men.
President Favors Plan.
Today those who met last night are
conducting a "think-it-over" cam
paign on the campus, seeking to test
the sentiment of both faculty and
students. Of those who favor the
proposition, President Wilbur is one
of the most enthusiastic. "I'm heart

ily in favor of such an association
among the young men of the Univer
sity," he said, when told of the plan,
'"t is one of the things that will make
them better Americans. That's what
a university is for." He offered to
personally see Adjutant General Hell,
commander of the forces of Califor
nia, in regard to securing aid from
the United States government, and
gave the assurance that he could be
relied on to secure an armory.
Dr. ,1 or da ii Not Opposed.
Dr. Jordan, when interviewed, this
morning, offered not the slightest op
position to the proposal, but discussed
the possibilities of the idea good
naturedly. He said: "I have no
criticism to register against the pro
posed voluntary training plan you
suggest. All Americans have the right
to act as their best judgment sees

fit. But of course I would always
heartily oppose any enforced militar
ism, as has been the rule in Europe.
Along with such a movement, how
ever, 1 would also suggest a study of
the conditions that might lead to war
fare. If this nation does become em
broiled, it will be by her own volition
and not by any foreign offensive ac
tion."
I n for mi Authorities.
Committees have been appointed to
inform the University authorities that
the matter is being seriously consid
ered by the students, and to write to
Washington to find out what federal
aid will be extended and under what
conditions. It,is felt by men con
nected with the movement that the
government will help and encourage
military drill at Stanford just as it
has at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and
other universities.
Although no definite plans have as
yet been made, it was the unanimous
feeling in the meeting, last night, that
the drill, if inaugurated at Stanford,
should he absolutely voluntary. The
idea was prevalent that if the nation
can solve the problem of prepared
ness in this way, there will never be
any necessity for enforced militarism.
Back of the whole plan is the neces
sity of educating the nation's "picked
half million" as college men have
been termed, in the training that
teaches them to be leaders under all
practical conditions which might be
met as citizens of the United States.
Meeting In I'liioii.
It is planned to hold a meeting in
the Union, as soon as sufficient, data
can be prepared to present to the stu
dents. At this time, President Wil
bur and several military officers from
the Presidio in San Francisco will
speak.

conditions. It,is felt by men con
nected with the movement that the
government will help and encourage
military drill at Stanford just as it
has at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and
other universities.
Although no definite plans have as
yet been made, it was the unanimous
feeling in the meeting, last night, that
the drill, if inaugurated at Stanford,
should he absolutely voluntary. The
idea was prevalent that if the nation
can solve the problem of prepared
ness in this way, there will never be
any necessity for enforced militarism.
Back of the whole plan is the neces
sity of educating the nation's "picked
half million" as college men have
been termed, in the training that
teaches them to be leaders under all
practical conditions which might be
met as citizens of the United States.
Meeting In I'liioii.
It is planned to hold a meeting in
the Union, as soon as sufficient, data
can be prepared to present to the stu
dents. At this time, President Wil
bur and several military officers from
the Presidio in San Francisco will
speak.
Preliminary action in a campaign to
secure opportunity for a military ed
ucation at Stanford was taken last
night, when thirty-five men gathered
to consider the probability of intro
ducing voluntary drill into the Uni
versity. Although this meeting was
without organization and of a more or
less spontaneous nature, there was an
earnestness at bottom which dispelled
all the elements of bravado and any
idea that the proposition is looked on
as a fad. There was no "glories of
war" attitude among the men.
President Favors Plan.
Today those who met last night are
conducting a "think-it-over" cam
paign on the campus, seeking to test
the sentiment of both faculty and
students. Of those who favor the
proposition, President Wilbur is one
of the most enthusiastic. "I'm heart

ily in favor of such an association
among the young men of the Univer
sity," he said, when told of the plan,
'"t is one of the things that will make
them better Americans. That's what
a university is for." He offered to
personally see Adjutant General Hell,
commander of the forces of Califor
nia, in regard to securing aid from
the United States government, and
gave the assurance that he could be
relied on to secure an armory.
Dr. ,1 or da ii Not Opposed.
Dr. Jordan, when interviewed, this
morning, offered not the slightest op
position to the proposal, but discussed
the possibilities of the idea good
naturedly. He said: "I have no
criticism to register against the pro
posed voluntary training plan you
suggest. All Americans have the right
to act as their best judgment sees

fit. But of course I would always
heartily oppose any enforced militar
ism, as has been the rule in Europe.
Along with such a movement, how
ever, 1 would also suggest a study of
the conditions that might lead to war
fare. If this nation does become em
broiled, it will be by her own volition
and not by any foreign offensive ac
tion."
I n for mi Authorities.
Committees have been appointed to
inform the University authorities that
the matter is being seriously consid
ered by the students, and to write to
Washington to find out what federal
aid will be extended and under what
conditions. It,is felt by men con
