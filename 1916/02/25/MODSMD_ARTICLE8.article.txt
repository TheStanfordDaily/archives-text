and it will probably be halted at the
conclusion of the fifth inning. As
has been the custom in the past, the
ball, which will be marked, will be
tossed in the air by the baseball cap

and sophomore classes to battle for.
The juniors will cross bats with the
seniors on Tuesday, the winners meet
ing the victors of the underclass game
in the final contest on Thursday.
Class nuemrals will be awarded the
members of the team winning the
championship. As the lineups of the
four teams have not been announced
as yet, it is hard to dope out the final
outcome.
