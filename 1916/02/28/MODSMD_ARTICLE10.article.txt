# Work of Testing Drill Sentiment Is Progressing

sentiment in regard to the proposed
introduction of voluntary drill into
Stanford is being actively carried on
by those interested in the success of
the plan. Among the students, the
majority opinion seems very favor
able thus far, and it is expected that
enough people can be interested to
warrant starting such an institution.
It is urged that every man in the
University think the matter over ser
iously, in order that some definite
ideas may be advanced at the meet
ing to be held in the Union soon.
Letters have been sent to Presi
dent Wilson, former President Roose
velt, Major General Wood, Acting
Secretary of War Seott, Senator Phe
lan and Congressman E. A. Hayes,
asking for ideas and inquiring
whether such a plan, if carried out
on a large scale, would meet with
their approval as a means of national
defense.
Faculty opinion is, in the main,
favorable. The following statements
from several of the Stanford pro
fessors will give some notion of their
ideas on the subject:
Assistant Professor 11. C. Ilrown

spread to all the universities. It is
the best chance to stave off some more
serious military movement."
Professor V. 1,. kcllosrg—"l approve
