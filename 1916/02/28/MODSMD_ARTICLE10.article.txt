# Work of Testing Drill Sentiment Is Progressing
## 
### 
The work of determining campus
sentiment in regard to the proposed
introduction of voluntary drill into
Stanford is being actively carried on
by those interested in the success of
the plan. Among the students, the
majority opinion seems very favor
able thus far, and it is expected that
enough people can be interested to
warrant starting such an institution.
It is urged that every man in the
University think the matter over ser
iously, in order that some definite
ideas may be advanced at the meet
ing to be held in the Union soon.
Letters have been sent to Presi
dent Wilson, former President Roose
velt, Major General Wood, Acting
Secretary of War Seott, Senator Phe
lan and Congressman E. A. Hayes,
asking for ideas and inquiring
whether such a plan, if carried out
on a large scale, would meet with
their approval as a means of national
defense.
Faculty opinion is, in the main,
favorable. The following statements
from several of the Stanford pro
fessors will give some notion of their
ideas on the subject:
Assistant Professor 11. C. Ilrown
—"I would like to see this movement
spread to all the universities. It is
the best chance to stave off some more
serious military movement."
Professor V. 1,. kcllosrg—"l approve
of the plan, but thing that training
for officers should be stressed. We
should take advantage of the fact that
we have good men for officers in the
universities."
Professor \V. 11. Carriith—"l would
favor the introduction ot' the Swiss
sytem of military training for every
able-bodied man in the University."
Professor <«. .1. I'eirce—"Voluntary
training for those who want it is a
good thing, but I am opposed to com
pulsory drill."
Associate Professor I). JI. Folsom —
"If voluntary drill means systematic
military training under a competent:
officer, open to all who desire such
training, then I am heartily in favor
of it."
Professor F. ('. Woodward—"There's
plenty of good exercise in drill, and
a reasonable amount of military train
ing probably makes a man, potenti
ally, at least, a better citizen, lint
carrying a heavy gun around 011 warm
afternoons gets pretty monotonous
and I'm afraid voluntary drill will
never become a major sport. If a suf
ficient number of students show a
really serious interest, I see no reason
why the experiment shouldn't be
made."
Professor ('. I). Marx—"lf the men
of the University want military
training, let them have it."

the best chance to stave off some more
serious military movement."
Professor V. 1,. kcllosrg—"l approve
of the plan, but thing that training
for officers should be stressed. We
should take advantage of the fact that
we have good men for officers in the
universities."
Professor \V. 11. Carriith—"l would
favor the introduction ot' the Swiss
sytem of military training for every
able-bodied man in the University."
Professor <«. .1. I'eirce—"Voluntary
training for those who want it is a
good thing, but I am opposed to com

Associate Professor I). JI. Folsom —
"If voluntary drill means systematic
military training under a competent:
officer, open to all who desire such
training, then I am heartily in favor
of it."
Professor F. ('. Woodward—"There's
plenty of good exercise in drill, and
a reasonable amount of military train
ing probably makes a man, potenti
ally, at least, a better citizen, lint
carrying a heavy gun around 011 warm
afternoons gets pretty monotonous
and I'm afraid voluntary drill will
never become a major sport. If a suf
ficient number of students show a
really serious interest, I see no reason
why the experiment shouldn't be
made."
Professor ('. I). Marx—"lf the men
of the University want military
training, let them have it."
The work of determining campus
sentiment in regard to the proposed
introduction of voluntary drill into
Stanford is being actively carried on
by those interested in the success of
the plan. Among the students, the
majority opinion seems very favor
able thus far, and it is expected that
enough people can be interested to
warrant starting such an institution.
It is urged that every man in the
University think the matter over ser
iously, in order that some definite
ideas may be advanced at the meet
ing to be held in the Union soon.
Letters have been sent to Presi
dent Wilson, former President Roose
velt, Major General Wood, Acting
Secretary of War Seott, Senator Phe
lan and Congressman E. A. Hayes,
asking for ideas and inquiring
whether such a plan, if carried out
on a large scale, would meet with
their approval as a means of national
defense.
Faculty opinion is, in the main,
favorable. The following statements
from several of the Stanford pro
fessors will give some notion of their
ideas on the subject:

spread to all the universities. It is
the best chance to stave off some more
