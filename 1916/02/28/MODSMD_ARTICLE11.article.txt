# Drawing Tomorrow For "Great Divide"
## Freshmen Will Miss Lunch To Be In Line at the Psychological Moment 
### 
Tomorrow at 1:10 will be your last
chance to get any good seats for"The
Great Divide." Drawing for tickets

will be held at that time at the Book
store and at Weingart.ner's in Palo
Alto, tor the English Club production
of Friday evening.
As far as rehearsals go, the play
is ready to be presented now. Rut the
cast will spend the rest of the week
in touching up any rough places with
the final polish wtiich promises a
week-end performance of a brilliancy
not soon forgotten.
The greatest piece of characteriza
tion which has been seen on the Stan
ford stage since "The Only Way,"
three years ago, will be that of Ste
phen Ghent by W. B. Owens. Ghent


W. B. Owens and Nellita Clioate
is a big man from the start. And he is
a bigger man when the play ends. It
is easy to believe him when in the
first act, he says that he used to be
lieve that he had it in him "to put his
hand against the world and make her
tilt."
In the last act we know his strength,
for by the sheer force of his great
desire he has bridged a chasm be
tween himself and the girl he loves
that is deeper and more impassable
than that of the great Canyon of the
Colorado. In the hands of W. B.
Owens. Stephen Ghent is through and
through the man who could face and
conquer the great divide.
