# Arboretum to Be Planted as Field For Research With Two Thousand Species of Trees and Shrubs
## TRUSTEES DECIDE TO CARRY OUT ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF STANFORDS Policy of Cultivation Will Be in Hands of Department of Botany 
### 
Stanford's Arboretum may soon be
come the finest in western America
as a field for broad botanical studies,
as a result of action taken at the
meeting of the Hoard of Trustees, Fri
day afternoon. The number of species
of trees and shrubs will be increased,
following this action by the board,
from two hundred, the approximate
number now, to at least between two
and three thousand varieties.
Control of the general policy to be
pursued in the planting and removal
of all plants in the Arboretum will be
placed in the hands of the Botany de
partment hereafter. This was the reC-Â»
ommendation of President Ray Ly
man Wilbur to the board. The De
partment of Botany will co-operate
with the University landscape gard
eners in their work. General cultiva
tion and management of laborers will
remain in the hands of the Business
Office, as at present. The Arboretum
will be developed along scientifically
useful lines.
Natural Arboretum Advantages.
"We are peculiarly fortunate in our
possibilities in certain broad botan
ical studies," declared President Wil
bur, in recommending the develop
ment of the Arboretum to the Trus
tees.
"The Stanford Arboretum offers a
unique and splendid opportunity for
the development of a University fea
ture that can soon, with proper care,
become world famous. The local con
ditions, the climate, and the foresight
shown years au:o by Senator Stanford,
all combine to make the position of
Stanford University unusually strong
in this connection. We should carry
out Senator Stanford's expressed de
sire to bring together 'all the different
kinds of trees and shrubs that would
grow in California.'
Founders' Magnificent Beginning.
"His was a magnificent beginning,
and had he lived Stanford Uinversity
would have possessed one of the most
valuable arboretums in the world. Hut
unfortunately, due to his untimely
death and the 'dark days' which fol
lowed, the young plants were neglect
ed and misused just at the critical
time. Consequently many of the in
teresting and valuable species have
been crowded out by eucalyptus and
cypress trees originally planted for
temporary shelter, and which under
normal conditions would have heen
removed wherever they endangered
the more important species.
Few Species At Present.
"As it now stands, the Arboretum
contains approximately 200 species, or
a little less than the number growing
in Professor Durand's private garden.
Hut if developed along scientific lines,
even without materially increasing the
expense of up-keep, at least two to
three thousand species could be
grown. Such a collection would lie
invaluable for scientific research, and
for general work with our botanical
classes. It would furnish also ma
terial and information that ultimately
would lie important to the state.
"A World Feature"
"I need not point out the great ben
efit that would accrue from having
experts guide the University in this
respect," concluded Dr. Wilbur, in his
address of recommendation.
"We cannot undo the past but we
can centralize the responsibility for
the future development of the Arbor
etum and can look forward to a world
feature in this development."
Details of the Plan.
An annual appropriation for the ac
quisition of new plants and the main
tenance of proper labels has been
voted to further the proposed policy
of Arboretum development. A reli
able, trained garden laborer will be
engaged to devote his time to the
planting and care of the plants, un
der the supervision of the Hotany de
partment. Means will be provided for
the watering of such plants as may
need it, and to tide the Arboretum
over dry years. A botanical map of
the campus will be prepared by the
Department of Hotany, so that a gen
eral plan of development can be con
sistently followed over a long period
of years.
Dr. Sargent, director of the great
Arnold Arboretum of Harvard, and
one of the world authorities on trees,
assures Stanford of the co-operation
of that institution, and expresses the
belief that the growth of the Stanford
Arboretum will be of great value to
the state in the probably resultant
increase in the number of exotic tree
species that can be cultivated in Cali
fornia.
