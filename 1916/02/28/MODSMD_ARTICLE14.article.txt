# Crew Huskies Heave Machine Out of Ditch
## 
### 
Stanford's crew huskies were put to
an additional test of strength yester
day en route from Redwood estuary
for the daily workout. The crew was
buzzing merrily along when a .Max
well driven by a stranger suddenly
keeled into a ditch along the side of
the road. The Cardinal oarsmen hop
ped out of their machine, gathered
around, looked at the inmates, and
under the direction of Captain "Chick"
Orme, heaved ho, once, and the Max
well was placed in the middle of the
road, to the delight of its occupants.
The Stanford oarsmen are still
training rather hap-hazardly due to a
lack of a coaching launch, and Cap
tain Orme is making dire predictions
of the outcome of the season's work,
unless a launch is provided very soon.

day follow:
Varsity — Goodman, cox.; Maurcr.
Green, Orme, Andrews, .Tacomini,
