The showing of the basketball team
last Friday night, presages good for
the prospects of the game another
season. Evidently Stanford basket
tossers nave a little of the innate
stuif, for it can't be said that they had
much else to aid them in holding down
the team which split even with the
crack University of Washington and
O. A. C. teams to a 32-2S score.
They certainly didn't have adequate
training. And though the whole stu
dent body may be strong behind them,
in wanting them to win, the attitude
of a large number of students toward
the game rather takes the boost ele
ment out of their support. It's rather
trite, but nevertheless timely, to ask:
"What could they have done with
proper coaching and the unqualified
support of all of the students?"
if basketball is given the chance it
needs to make good by the students,
the coaching question will be solved
by next year, and Stanford will be in
a fair way to reverse Friday night's
score next year. Whether that sup
port will be forthcoming is one of the
things that will have to be determined
at tomorrow night's student body
meeting.
Better crowds will be assured the
games next year when a regular
schedule can be worked out before
the beginning of the semester and con
flicting attractions forestalled.
