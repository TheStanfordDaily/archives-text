# RAIN KEEPS STANFORD NINES OUT OF ACTION
## 
### 
Swain and Sheehan's Independents
did not meet the varsity nine, Satur
day afternoon, on account of rain.
Hope that they might play continued
up until shortly before time for the
game to be called, but the condition
of the diamond would not permit.
Saturday morning the second var
sity defeated the San Francisco Poly
technic High school 12-0. They played
for only two innings, when the game
was called on account of rain.
Stanford's freshmen did not play the
Santa Clara second team on Saturday
afternoon on account of rain.
