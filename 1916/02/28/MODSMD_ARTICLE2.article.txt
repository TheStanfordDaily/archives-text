# Students Will Discuss Rating of Basketball
## 
### 
Students favoring and opposing the
retention of basketball at Stanford as
a major sport will have the opportun
ity to express their opinions at a stu
dent mass meeting in the Union, to
morrow evening.
Ever since the Executive Committer*
raised basketball to a place anions
the major sports there have been var
ious opinions advanced denouncing
this action and other opinions as vig
orously upholding it. To settle this
difficulty the meeting has been called.
Whether the question will be put to
a vote of the student body depends on
the sentiment of tomorrow night's
meeting.
