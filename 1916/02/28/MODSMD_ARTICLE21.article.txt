Editor The I>aily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: Would you kindly let me
know through the columns of your
paper what the idea is to cause inter
nal dissention in the athletics of this
institution. Now that relations with
California have been resumed and the
coaching question settled, a few —a
paltry few —would like to stir up the
basketball question. Why? Because
a few games were lost? Was any
thing said when the baseball team
lost? No! Why not give basketball
a chance and also help athletics along
in tiie University.
Yours truly,
JOB BUSH.
