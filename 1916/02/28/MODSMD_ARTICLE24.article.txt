# BOARD OF TRUSTEES GRADES ASSISTANTS
## Three Divisions of Departmental Workers—May Erect New Dormitory Soon 
### 
Departmental assistants will be
graded into three divisions following
action taken by the Hoard of Trustees,
Friday afternoon, when they met in
San Francisco, and, among other mat
ters, adopted the report made by Pres
ident Wilbur as to the readjustment
of the so-called departmental assist
ant list.
The object of the change is to re
duce the number of names to appear
in the forthcoming Register. As a re
sult of this action about 125 names
will be eliminated from the total of
those positions as listed in the last
Register.
The new categories of assistants are
to be as follows:
1. Reuular Assistants—Those on
regular appointments and with regu
lar duties of an academic nature, such
as teaching and clinical work, in
cluding members of the administra
tive and library staff. These are to be
listed in the Register.
2. Technical Assistants — Regular
laboratory or other technical work
ers, stenographic assistants on full
time, not members of the teaching
staff, but with regular appointments
and salaries and more or less perm
anent tenure. These are not to ap
pear in the Register, except where it
seems advisable in connection with
departmental announcements, but will
appear in the Directory under the
heading "Technical Assistants," as the
nature of their duties makes it im
portant that their addresses be read
ily accessible.
3. Miscellaneous Assistants — All
other work of assistant grade is to
be done by the hour and paid for upon
requisition by the department. The
requisitions for such assistants should
specify the number to be employed,
the period of service and rate of com
pensation, with a maximum estimate
of expense.
Against these requisitions, monthly
reports are to be submitted by the
department heads on or before the
20th of the month, indicating the
amount of work done by each assist
ant and the payment to be made. No
regular appointment or listing of such
assistants is to be made either in the
Register or Directory.
Dormitory Outlook Hopeful.
That the outlook for additional
dormitory facilities is very hopeful,
was the consensus of opinion at Fri
day's meeting of the Trustees. The
dormitory question lias been discussed
by the Board of Trustees for several
meetings. The need for increased
housing facilities is recognized by
them all. At present it is only a ques
tion of the amount of money required
to construct buildings.
If the cost is not prohibitive, one
additional dormitory to accommodate
two hundred men students will be
erected in the near future. The site
has not been determined yet, but it
is thought probable that it will be
located near Encina Hall.
Control of Scholarship Funds.
All scholarship and loan funds will
be placed under the control of the
Faculty Committee on Scholarship
hereafter. This marks a big step in
the broadening of the work of this
committee. Its name has been
changed from "Committee on Delin
quent Scholarship" to "Committee on
I Scholarship," implying the emphasis
on a good, rather than on bad, schol
arship. In the future, the work of
this committee will be of a more con
structive nature, and it will have
wider powers.

to be as follows:
1. Reuular Assistants—Those on
regular appointments and with regu
lar duties of an academic nature, such
as teaching and clinical work, in
cluding members of the administra
tive and library staff. These are to be
listed in the Register.
2. Technical Assistants — Regular
laboratory or other technical work
ers, stenographic assistants on full
time, not members of the teaching
staff, but with regular appointments
and salaries and more or less perm
anent tenure. These are not to ap
pear in the Register, except where it
seems advisable in connection with
departmental announcements, but will
appear in the Directory under the
heading "Technical Assistants," as the
nature of their duties makes it im
portant that their addresses be read
ily accessible.
3. Miscellaneous Assistants — All
other work of assistant grade is to
be done by the hour and paid for upon
requisition by the department. The
requisitions for such assistants should
specify the number to be employed,
the period of service and rate of com
pensation, with a maximum estimate
of expense.
Against these requisitions, monthly
reports are to be submitted by the
department heads on or before the
20th of the month, indicating the
amount of work done by each assist
ant and the payment to be made. No
regular appointment or listing of such
assistants is to be made either in the
Register or Directory.
Dormitory Outlook Hopeful.
That the outlook for additional
dormitory facilities is very hopeful,
was the consensus of opinion at Fri
day's meeting of the Trustees. The
dormitory question lias been discussed
by the Board of Trustees for several
meetings. The need for increased
housing facilities is recognized by
them all. At present it is only a ques
tion of the amount of money required
to construct buildings.
If the cost is not prohibitive, one
additional dormitory to accommodate
two hundred men students will be
erected in the near future. The site
has not been determined yet, but it
is thought probable that it will be
located near Encina Hall.
Control of Scholarship Funds.
All scholarship and loan funds will
be placed under the control of the
Faculty Committee on Scholarship
hereafter. This marks a big step in
the broadening of the work of this
committee. Its name has been
changed from "Committee on Delin
quent Scholarship" to "Committee on
I Scholarship," implying the emphasis
on a good, rather than on bad, schol
arship. In the future, the work of
this committee will be of a more con
structive nature, and it will have
wider powers.
Departmental assistants will be
graded into three divisions following
action taken by the Hoard of Trustees,
Friday afternoon, when they met in
San Francisco, and, among other mat
ters, adopted the report made by Pres
ident Wilbur as to the readjustment
of the so-called departmental assist
ant list.
The object of the change is to re
duce the number of names to appear
in the forthcoming Register. As a re
sult of this action about 125 names
will be eliminated from the total of
those positions as listed in the last
Register.
The new categories of assistants are
to be as follows:
1. Reuular Assistants—Those on
regular appointments and with regu
lar duties of an academic nature, such
