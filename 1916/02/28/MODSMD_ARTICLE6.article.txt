# DR. STOLZ TALKS ON EARLY CONDITIONING
## Track Candidates Urged To Train Hotly As Well As Develop Muscles 
### 
"Every man can learn to train him
self," Dr. H. R. Stolz told the track
candidates who were gathered in the
bleachers, Friday afternoon, to hear
him speak on "Early Conditioning.'"
Dr. Stolz outlined the necessities for
a thorough training of the entire body,
and also gave the causes of fatigue,
which, he said, were partly mental
and partly nervous.
"The need for training the heart
and lungs is just as important as the
development of the muscles," he said.
"The aim of the track man is to work
up the heart, body, and lungs to the
point where lie can stand the greatest
amount of punishment."
