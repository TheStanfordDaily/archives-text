# MURRAY AND NORTON RUN CLOSE RACE IN HURDLES
## GRANT AND LYNN IMPROVE Heavy Track Causes Slow Times in Final Preliminary Track Meet 
### 
between showers on Saturday morn
ing, Captain "Kic" Templeton put his
men through their paces in the final
preliminary meet which was held pre
paratory to dividing the men out for
track into squads. Only in the sprints
were full distances run, the other
races cut down for early-season work.
Ilunlel Hecord In Danger.
Although times were rather slow in
most cases, due to a heavy track, there
were one or two notable exceptions.
In the 70-yard high hurdle race, "Feg"
Murray and Norton ran a neck and
neck race, the former winning with
hardly a stride to spare, in the ex
cellent time of 9 1-5 seconds. Had
the race been over a 75-yard stretch,
it is possible that the existing Amer
ican record of 9 2-5 seconds for that
event might have gone by the boards.
Tn the low hurdle race, Murray, Nor
ton, and House made an imposing
combination. Murray took the event
in 11 1-5 seconds.
Grant Betters Time.
Grant bettered his former time for
the 352-yard race by breaking the tape
in 39 1-5 seconds. He was closely
pressed by Lyn't. Aupperle ran a
nice race in the second heat of the
three-lap run, winning easily in 3:24.
A summary of the meet follows:
Three lap run, first heat —Won by H.
A. Frye, '17: E. J. Phelps, *19, second;
