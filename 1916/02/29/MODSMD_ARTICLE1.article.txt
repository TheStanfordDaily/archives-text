### 
General approval of the proposed
schedule for dramatics, which was
submitted to the Faculty Committee
on Public Exercises .last week, was
expressed by that body at its meeting

vised some slight changes in regard
to this and one or two other matters.
No definite action will be taken until
after the proposition has been dis
cussed at a joint meeting of the com
mittee and the students interested in
dramatics. This meeting has been set
for next Monday afternoon, March 6,
in room 209 of the English building,

productions, it was suggested that

named in the proposal. This provis
ion is suggested to prevent any idea
of monopoly.

sponsible agent to whom the faculty
