# Electricians Test Power Transmission
## 
### 
A series of experiments has been
begun at the Electrical Engineering
laboratory in the determination of
transmission losses under conditions
of high voltage and had weather, with
the new equipment of towers and con
ductors.
Two one-inch aluminum lines have
been strung on the steel towers, re
cently erected. This line represents
the maximum size used in practice
today. During the past week voltage
or current as high as 300,000 volts
have been sent over the wires, but at
that point, there was a noticeable lum
inous discharge into the air, and loss
was appreciable above 200,000 volts.
This was tried out with foggy and
otherwise inclement weather.
