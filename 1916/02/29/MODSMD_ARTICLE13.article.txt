# STUDENT COUNCIL SAYS CAMPUS TUBBING MISDEMEANOR
## ROSS CASE BRINGS DECISION Four Sophomores Involved to Receive Reprimand From Council 
### 
That tubbing for discipline and tub
bing for hazing fails under the same
category and therefore will be dealt
with as a misdemeanor in the future,
is the decision of the Student Coun
cil, as the result of investigation
brought about by the case of L). M.
Ross, '19, who wished to have certain
sophomores brought before Palo Alto
courts for administering the aquatic
reprimand.
However, the Council decided to end
the present case of Ross by repri
manding the four sophomores who had
most immediate responsibility for the
tubbing of Ross. The Council .also
suggested that another means of en
forcing discipline be found both in
fraternities and clubs.
The stand of the Council on the
tubbing question is clearly given in a
statement sent to President Wilbur,
with whom the members conferred
regarding the case of Ross. This
statement and one from President
Wilbur is published in this issue Of
The Daily Palo Alto, giving the is
sues involved, and expressing the pol
icies that will be enforced in the fu
ture.
Following is the statement of Stu
dent Adviser Otis H. Castle, made with
the sanction of President C. M. Miller
and other members of the conference:
The Council examined a large num
ber of witnesses to the tubbing, as
well as many others who were able to
throw light on the procedure of the
evening. Its findings of fact follow:
On the evening in question the mem
bers of Encina Club believed that it
had become necessary to punish cer
tain freshmen for breaches of the in
ternal regulations of the club, which
regulations they considered the fresh
men to have accepted by voluntarily
joining the organization. These tub
bings were inflicted with the knowl
edge of the president of the club,
and after he had warned the members
to use extreme care in selecting and
handling the men to be disciplined.
This admonition was frequently re
ferred to and carefully observed dur
ing the evening.
The method of procedure was to
take each freshman to a room and
give him a trial. The charges against
him were read, he was given an op
portunity to present a defense, and
a vote 011 his case was then taken
either by a show of hands or by rising.
Of eighteen freshmen so tried during
the evening, only six were punished.
These six men testified that they were
given a fair trial and carefully
handled. Ross received an ordinary
tubbing and no physical injury re
sulted.
(â– rounds For Tubbing Koss.
Granting for a moment that the men
were warranted in their belief that
they might undertake such disciplin
ary tubbing, they had from their point
of view grounds for tubbing Ross, pro
vided they reasonably considered him
a freshman. He had neglected the
duty expected of freshmen in con
nection with answering the 'phone
and decorating the club room for the
Encina "at homes." The Council con
sidered that they were warranted in
thinking Ross a freshman, because he
was credited with only 11 hours in
the Directory, had made no applica
tion for advanced standing, had worn
a freshman cap during the preceding
semester, and at that time was eating
at the "freshman end" of the table
without protest.
Interpretation of Tubbing Rule.
Of course these men were, in one
interpretation, violating the letter of
a University rule in tubbing at. all.
But here the Council believes that
the blame should fall on itself, to
gether with the officers of Encina
Club, and all faculty and student of
ficials who have been connected with
the control of students for many years
past, rather than on these particular
men. Relying on the common power
of courts to interpret codes, the var
ious authorities whose business it has
been to guard student conduct have
tacitly permitted to grow up a dis
tinction between tubbing as hazing
and infrequent, carefully supervised
tubbing within private groups for
disciplinary purposes. The Council
does not believe that severe punish
ment for relying on this interpreta
tion of the rule should be visited on
these men. It has, however, ordered
that the men be reprimanded for fail
ing to have responsible upperclass
men present, and for not giving Ross
a trial. In this last failure they
were partially, but not wholly justified
by the fact that Ross began to strike
at them before violent hands were
laid on him.
All Tubbing Now Barred.
The Council believes, however, that
this case marks an appropriate occas
ion to take a further step in the mat
ter of tubbing. It has accordingly an
nounced that all tubbing, both tubbing
as hazing and tubbing for discipline,
will hereafter be under the ban every
where on the campus. This announce
ment was made for three reasons,
aside from the foremost one, namely
that it is a violation of a University
rule, and "a University is no placc for
unwritten law." In the first place, as
strongly pointed out by President Wil
bur, in every practice of tubbing there
lurks a grave danger to the unfor
tunate victim who happens to have a
weak heart or some other constitu
tional defect. The possible benefits
of disciplinary tubbing do not warrant
taking this chance. Again, all forms
of tubbing are understood, or misun
derstood, alike by those unfamiliar
with university customs, and in their
eyes such practices bring odium upon
the institution. For a third reason,

although tubbing has in fact been
practiced merely to enforce internal
rules of private organizations, the idea
lias been spreading that it is actually
a "pro])" for student control. Those
who jealously guard the success of
that institution realize that such an
impression must be immediately
stamped out.
Expect Support of All Men.
For these reasons the Council felt
that it must take the new stand. It
is encouraged to believe that in this
stand it will have the support of all
Stanford men, because of the spirit
shown in connection with tubbing dur
ing recent years. Formerly the strin
gent rules against the practice were
notoriously dead letters, and tubbing
as hazing was rampant. In recent
years a spirit has been carefully fos
tered among the men which has led
them to distinguish between tubbing
as hazing and tubbing in a sober spirit
for disciplinary purposes. The for
mer has, with certain indefensible ex
ceptions at the beginning of fall se
mesters, been regarded as under the
ban. The Council expects a like co
operation in eliminating every form of
tubbing at Stanford.
Other Discipline for Freshmen.
Finally, the Council desired to ex
press its hearty appreciation of the
value of discipline for university stu
dents and particularly for freshmen.
It holies to see in the near future the
acceptance of definite methods by
which to enforce in freshmen compli
ance with the salutary customs which
j Stanford life imposes on them. It ex
pects to make recommendations along
this line to the conference.
Dr. Wilbur's letter to the Council
. follows:
Feb. 28, 1916.
Gentlemen:
In order to be sure that we under
i stand each other, 1 wish to outline the
I main points of our conversation today.
As far as student conduct is con-
I cerned, three main objects ai e 10 be
j attained:
1. The non-use of alcohol;
2. Personal morality;
3. Good sound Americanism.
The first two go together and are
vital for the future welfare and hap
piness of the individual. One mis
take here may have life-time conse
quences. The practice of hazing is
contrary to the full development of
those independent, self-respecting in
dividuals that we want to see at. Stan
ford and in this country. As I said
in addressing you a while ago:
Hazing is a combination of coward
j ice and bullying, absolutely un-Amer-
I ican. It overpowers and crushes the
| individual. Its essence is superiority
I in numbers on the one side. At the
! best it is contemptible and at the
I worst criminal. No one who delights
| in fair play, in the American spirit,
I can ever get any satisfaction from
'such an act. If student control is to
i succeed, all of its units must be equal
j and elected leaders followed and hon
jored. If one part of those governed
can be hazed indiscrmlnately by an
! other, then self- government falls flat
| right there. A democracy no longer
! exists.
I realize that in the past there has
been gradually introduced into Stan
ford certain hazing customs that have
been accepted by some of the students
I as disciplinary and salutary. T wish
I to call your attention at this time
to the existing regulations in regard
to hazing, particularly to those of the
faculty and those published in the
Manual of Student Control, pages 12
and 13. Those in the Manual read:
"All practices of hazing are pro
hibited. Hazing is defined as "includ
ing all practices which compel a stu
dent to submit to treatment from fel
low students that is humiliating or
dangerous," and such practices are
considered "an infringement of per
sonal liberty and an offense against
good order." By Faculty Committee,
August 27, 1910.
The practice of "tubbing" is specific
ally included in the above definition,
and prohibited. By Faculty Commit
tee, September 2, 1910.
112 call your attention also to the
specific rule of the Trustees, passed
August 25, 1911, at page 175 of the
Trustees' Manual: "Resolved, That
the Business Manager be requested to
embody in the rules and regulations
governing Encina Hall a clause pro
hibiting hazing in all forms, includ
ing tubbing and all other interference
with the personal liberty of students,
and that all applicants for rooms in
Encina Hall be required to sign an
agreement to observe and abide by
all the rules and regulations."
It is my duty to see that these regu
lations are carried out. It is the duty
of those responsible for the proper
conduct of student pelf-government
to see that they live within the exist
ing rules of the University, and that
they do not condone or overlook any
thing that is contrary to University
legislation. If the rules as they exist
are not consistent with student self
government, then after due considera
tion the changes thought necessary
can be asked for with the reasons for
such proposed changes. I will trans
mit such authoritative request to the
proper University bodies for consid
eration.
Student self-government means re
sponsibility. It should mean per
sonal self-respect, personal dignity,
and should be a most vital and desir
able part of the life of a student. If
it has to be held up by lawlessness
and by personal affront, it is surely
being putin a false position.
I ask therefore for a thorough study
of the situation in order that we may
all know the law, understand it and
live up to it. The University is no
place for unwritten law, favoritism,
and privilege.
Very truly yours,
RAY LYMAN WILBUR,
President.

governing Encina Hall a clause pro
hibiting hazing in all forms, includ
ing tubbing and all other interference
with the personal liberty of students,
and that all applicants for rooms in
Encina Hall be required to sign an
agreement to observe and abide by
all the rules and regulations."
It is my duty to see that these regu
lations are carried out. It is the duty
of those responsible for the proper
conduct of student pelf-government
to see that they live within the exist
ing rules of the University, and that
they do not condone or overlook any
thing that is contrary to University
legislation. If the rules as they exist
are not consistent with student self
government, then after due considera
tion the changes thought necessary
can be asked for with the reasons for
such proposed changes. I will trans
mit such authoritative request to the
proper University bodies for consid
eration.
Student self-government means re
sponsibility. It should mean per
sonal self-respect, personal dignity,
and should be a most vital and desir
able part of the life of a student. If
it has to be held up by lawlessness
and by personal affront, it is surely
being putin a false position.
I ask therefore for a thorough study
of the situation in order that we may
all know the law, understand it and
live up to it. The University is no
place for unwritten law, favoritism,
and privilege.
Very truly yours,
RAY LYMAN WILBUR,
President.
That tubbing for discipline and tub
bing for hazing fails under the same
category and therefore will be dealt
with as a misdemeanor in the future,
is the decision of the Student Coun
cil, as the result of investigation
brought about by the case of L). M.
Ross, '19, who wished to have certain
sophomores brought before Palo Alto
courts for administering the aquatic
reprimand.
However, the Council decided to end
the present case of Ross by repri
manding the four sophomores who had
most immediate responsibility for the
tubbing of Ross. The Council .also
suggested that another means of en
forcing discipline be found both in
fraternities and clubs.
The stand of the Council on the
tubbing question is clearly given in a
statement sent to President Wilbur,
with whom the members conferred
regarding the case of Ross. This
statement and one from President
Wilbur is published in this issue Of
The Daily Palo Alto, giving the is
sues involved, and expressing the pol
icies that will be enforced in the fu
ture.
Following is the statement of Stu
dent Adviser Otis H. Castle, made with
the sanction of President C. M. Miller
and other members of the conference:
The Council examined a large num
ber of witnesses to the tubbing, as
well as many others who were able to
throw light on the procedure of the
evening. Its findings of fact follow:
On the evening in question the mem
bers of Encina Club believed that it
had become necessary to punish cer
tain freshmen for breaches of the in
ternal regulations of the club, which
regulations they considered the fresh
men to have accepted by voluntarily
joining the organization. These tub
bings were inflicted with the knowl
edge of the president of the club,
and after he had warned the members
to use extreme care in selecting and
handling the men to be disciplined.
This admonition was frequently re
ferred to and carefully observed dur
ing the evening.
The method of procedure was to
take each freshman to a room and
give him a trial. The charges against
him were read, he was given an op
portunity to present a defense, and
a vote 011 his case was then taken
either by a show of hands or by rising.
Of eighteen freshmen so tried during
the evening, only six were punished.
These six men testified that they were
given a fair trial and carefully
handled. Ross received an ordinary
tubbing and no physical injury re
sulted.
(â– rounds For Tubbing Koss.
Granting for a moment that the men
were warranted in their belief that
they might undertake such disciplin
ary tubbing, they had from their point
of view grounds for tubbing Ross, pro
vided they reasonably considered him
a freshman. He had neglected the
duty expected of freshmen in con
nection with answering the 'phone
and decorating the club room for the
Encina "at homes." The Council con
sidered that they were warranted in
thinking Ross a freshman, because he
was credited with only 11 hours in
the Directory, had made no applica
tion for advanced standing, had worn
a freshman cap during the preceding
semester, and at that time was eating
at the "freshman end" of the table
without protest.
Interpretation of Tubbing Rule.
Of course these men were, in one
interpretation, violating the letter of
a University rule in tubbing at. all.
But here the Council believes that
the blame should fall on itself, to
gether with the officers of Encina
Club, and all faculty and student of
ficials who have been connected with
the control of students for many years
past, rather than on these particular
men. Relying on the common power
of courts to interpret codes, the var
ious authorities whose business it has
been to guard student conduct have
tacitly permitted to grow up a dis
tinction between tubbing as hazing
and infrequent, carefully supervised
tubbing within private groups for
disciplinary purposes. The Council
does not believe that severe punish
ment for relying on this interpreta
tion of the rule should be visited on
these men. It has, however, ordered
that the men be reprimanded for fail
ing to have responsible upperclass
men present, and for not giving Ross
a trial. In this last failure they
were partially, but not wholly justified
by the fact that Ross began to strike
at them before violent hands were
laid on him.
All Tubbing Now Barred.
The Council believes, however, that
this case marks an appropriate occas
ion to take a further step in the mat
ter of tubbing. It has accordingly an
nounced that all tubbing, both tubbing
as hazing and tubbing for discipline,
will hereafter be under the ban every
where on the campus. This announce
ment was made for three reasons,
aside from the foremost one, namely
that it is a violation of a University
rule, and "a University is no placc for
unwritten law." In the first place, as
strongly pointed out by President Wil
bur, in every practice of tubbing there
lurks a grave danger to the unfor
tunate victim who happens to have a
weak heart or some other constitu
tional defect. The possible benefits
of disciplinary tubbing do not warrant
taking this chance. Again, all forms
of tubbing are understood, or misun
derstood, alike by those unfamiliar
with university customs, and in their
eyes such practices bring odium upon
the institution. For a third reason,

although tubbing has in fact been
practiced merely to enforce internal
rules of private organizations, the idea
lias been spreading that it is actually
a "pro])" for student control. Those
who jealously guard the success of
that institution realize that such an
impression must be immediately
stamped out.
Expect Support of All Men.
For these reasons the Council felt
that it must take the new stand. It
is encouraged to believe that in this
stand it will have the support of all
Stanford men, because of the spirit
shown in connection with tubbing dur
ing recent years. Formerly the strin
gent rules against the practice were
notoriously dead letters, and tubbing
as hazing was rampant. In recent
years a spirit has been carefully fos
tered among the men which has led
them to distinguish between tubbing
as hazing and tubbing in a sober spirit
for disciplinary purposes. The for
mer has, with certain indefensible ex
ceptions at the beginning of fall se
mesters, been regarded as under the
ban. The Council expects a like co
operation in eliminating every form of
tubbing at Stanford.
Other Discipline for Freshmen.
Finally, the Council desired to ex
press its hearty appreciation of the
value of discipline for university stu
dents and particularly for freshmen.
It holies to see in the near future the
acceptance of definite methods by
which to enforce in freshmen compli
ance with the salutary customs which
j Stanford life imposes on them. It ex
pects to make recommendations along
this line to the conference.
Dr. Wilbur's letter to the Council
. follows:
Feb. 28, 1916.
Gentlemen:
In order to be sure that we under
i stand each other, 1 wish to outline the
I main points of our conversation today.
As far as student conduct is con-
I cerned, three main objects ai e 10 be
j attained:
1. The non-use of alcohol;
2. Personal morality;
3. Good sound Americanism.
The first two go together and are
vital for the future welfare and hap
piness of the individual. One mis
take here may have life-time conse
quences. The practice of hazing is
contrary to the full development of
those independent, self-respecting in
dividuals that we want to see at. Stan
ford and in this country. As I said
in addressing you a while ago:
Hazing is a combination of coward
j ice and bullying, absolutely un-Amer-
I ican. It overpowers and crushes the
| individual. Its essence is superiority
I in numbers on the one side. At the
! best it is contemptible and at the
I worst criminal. No one who delights
| in fair play, in the American spirit,
I can ever get any satisfaction from
'such an act. If student control is to
i succeed, all of its units must be equal
j and elected leaders followed and hon
jored. If one part of those governed
can be hazed indiscrmlnately by an
! other, then self- government falls flat
| right there. A democracy no longer
! exists.
I realize that in the past there has
been gradually introduced into Stan
ford certain hazing customs that have
been accepted by some of the students
I as disciplinary and salutary. T wish
I to call your attention at this time
to the existing regulations in regard
to hazing, particularly to those of the
faculty and those published in the
Manual of Student Control, pages 12
and 13. Those in the Manual read:
"All practices of hazing are pro
hibited. Hazing is defined as "includ
ing all practices which compel a stu
dent to submit to treatment from fel
low students that is humiliating or
dangerous," and such practices are
considered "an infringement of per
sonal liberty and an offense against
good order." By Faculty Committee,
August 27, 1910.
The practice of "tubbing" is specific
ally included in the above definition,
and prohibited. By Faculty Commit
tee, September 2, 1910.
112 call your attention also to the
specific rule of the Trustees, passed
August 25, 1911, at page 175 of the
Trustees' Manual: "Resolved, That
the Business Manager be requested to
embody in the rules and regulations
governing Encina Hall a clause pro
hibiting hazing in all forms, includ
ing tubbing and all other interference
with the personal liberty of students,
and that all applicants for rooms in
Encina Hall be required to sign an

jored. If one part of those governed
can be hazed indiscrmlnately by an
! other, then self- government falls flat
| right there. A democracy no longer
! exists.
I realize that in the past there has
been gradually introduced into Stan
ford certain hazing customs that have
been accepted by some of the students
I as disciplinary and salutary. T wish
I to call your attention at this time
to the existing regulations in regard
to hazing, particularly to those of the
faculty and those published in the
Manual of Student Control, pages 12
and 13. Those in the Manual read:
"All practices of hazing are pro
hibited. Hazing is defined as "includ
ing all practices which compel a stu
dent to submit to treatment from fel
low students that is humiliating or
dangerous," and such practices are
considered "an infringement of per
sonal liberty and an offense against
good order." By Faculty Committee,
August 27, 1910.
The practice of "tubbing" is specific
ally included in the above definition,
and prohibited. By Faculty Commit
tee, September 2, 1910.
112 call your attention also to the
specific rule of the Trustees, passed
August 25, 1911, at page 175 of the
Trustees' Manual: "Resolved, That
the Business Manager be requested to
embody in the rules and regulations
governing Encina Hall a clause pro
hibiting hazing in all forms, includ
ing tubbing and all other interference
with the personal liberty of students,
and that all applicants for rooms in
Encina Hall be required to sign an
agreement to observe and abide by
all the rules and regulations."
It is my duty to see that these regu
lations are carried out. It is the duty
of those responsible for the proper
conduct of student pelf-government
to see that they live within the exist
ing rules of the University, and that
they do not condone or overlook any
thing that is contrary to University
legislation. If the rules as they exist
are not consistent with student self
government, then after due considera
tion the changes thought necessary
can be asked for with the reasons for
such proposed changes. I will trans
mit such authoritative request to the
proper University bodies for consid
eration.
Student self-government means re
sponsibility. It should mean per
sonal self-respect, personal dignity,
and should be a most vital and desir
able part of the life of a student. If
it has to be held up by lawlessness
and by personal affront, it is surely
being putin a false position.
I ask therefore for a thorough study
of the situation in order that we may
all know the law, understand it and
live up to it. The University is no
place for unwritten law, favoritism,
and privilege.
Very truly yours,
RAY LYMAN WILBUR,
President.
That tubbing for discipline and tub
bing for hazing fails under the same
category and therefore will be dealt
with as a misdemeanor in the future,
is the decision of the Student Coun
cil, as the result of investigation
brought about by the case of L). M.
Ross, '19, who wished to have certain
sophomores brought before Palo Alto
courts for administering the aquatic
reprimand.
However, the Council decided to end
the present case of Ross by repri
manding the four sophomores who had
most immediate responsibility for the
tubbing of Ross. The Council .also
suggested that another means of en
forcing discipline be found both in
fraternities and clubs.
The stand of the Council on the
tubbing question is clearly given in a
statement sent to President Wilbur,
with whom the members conferred
regarding the case of Ross. This
statement and one from President
Wilbur is published in this issue Of
The Daily Palo Alto, giving the is
sues involved, and expressing the pol
icies that will be enforced in the fu
ture.
Following is the statement of Stu
dent Adviser Otis H. Castle, made with
the sanction of President C. M. Miller
and other members of the conference:
The Council examined a large num
ber of witnesses to the tubbing, as
well as many others who were able to
throw light on the procedure of the
evening. Its findings of fact follow:
On the evening in question the mem
bers of Encina Club believed that it
had become necessary to punish cer
tain freshmen for breaches of the in
ternal regulations of the club, which
regulations they considered the fresh
men to have accepted by voluntarily
joining the organization. These tub
bings were inflicted with the knowl
edge of the president of the club,
and after he had warned the members
to use extreme care in selecting and
handling the men to be disciplined.
This admonition was frequently re
ferred to and carefully observed dur
ing the evening.
The method of procedure was to
take each freshman to a room and
give him a trial. The charges against
him were read, he was given an op
portunity to present a defense, and
a vote 011 his case was then taken
either by a show of hands or by rising.
Of eighteen freshmen so tried during
the evening, only six were punished.
These six men testified that they were
given a fair trial and carefully
handled. Ross received an ordinary
tubbing and no physical injury re
sulted.
(â– rounds For Tubbing Koss.
Granting for a moment that the men
were warranted in their belief that
they might undertake such disciplin
ary tubbing, they had from their point
of view grounds for tubbing Ross, pro
vided they reasonably considered him
a freshman. He had neglected the
duty expected of freshmen in con
nection with answering the 'phone
and decorating the club room for the
Encina "at homes." The Council con
sidered that they were warranted in
thinking Ross a freshman, because he
was credited with only 11 hours in
the Directory, had made no applica
tion for advanced standing, had worn
a freshman cap during the preceding
semester, and at that time was eating
at the "freshman end" of the table
without protest.
Interpretation of Tubbing Rule.
Of course these men were, in one
interpretation, violating the letter of
a University rule in tubbing at. all.
But here the Council believes that
the blame should fall on itself, to
gether with the officers of Encina
Club, and all faculty and student of
ficials who have been connected with
the control of students for many years
past, rather than on these particular
men. Relying on the common power
of courts to interpret codes, the var
ious authorities whose business it has
been to guard student conduct have
tacitly permitted to grow up a dis
tinction between tubbing as hazing
and infrequent, carefully supervised
tubbing within private groups for
disciplinary purposes. The Council
does not believe that severe punish
ment for relying on this interpreta
tion of the rule should be visited on
these men. It has, however, ordered
that the men be reprimanded for fail
ing to have responsible upperclass
men present, and for not giving Ross
a trial. In this last failure they
were partially, but not wholly justified
by the fact that Ross began to strike
at them before violent hands were
laid on him.
All Tubbing Now Barred.
The Council believes, however, that
this case marks an appropriate occas
ion to take a further step in the mat
ter of tubbing. It has accordingly an
nounced that all tubbing, both tubbing
as hazing and tubbing for discipline,
will hereafter be under the ban every
where on the campus. This announce
ment was made for three reasons,
aside from the foremost one, namely
that it is a violation of a University
rule, and "a University is no placc for
unwritten law." In the first place, as
strongly pointed out by President Wil
bur, in every practice of tubbing there
lurks a grave danger to the unfor
tunate victim who happens to have a
weak heart or some other constitu
tional defect. The possible benefits
of disciplinary tubbing do not warrant
taking this chance. Again, all forms
of tubbing are understood, or misun
derstood, alike by those unfamiliar
with university customs, and in their
eyes such practices bring odium upon
the institution. For a third reason,

although tubbing has in fact been
practiced merely to enforce internal
rules of private organizations, the idea
lias been spreading that it is actually
a "pro])" for student control. Those
who jealously guard the success of
that institution realize that such an
impression must be immediately
stamped out.
Expect Support of All Men.
For these reasons the Council felt
that it must take the new stand. It
is encouraged to believe that in this
stand it will have the support of all
Stanford men, because of the spirit
shown in connection with tubbing dur
ing recent years. Formerly the strin
gent rules against the practice were
notoriously dead letters, and tubbing
as hazing was rampant. In recent
years a spirit has been carefully fos
tered among the men which has led
them to distinguish between tubbing
as hazing and tubbing in a sober spirit
for disciplinary purposes. The for
mer has, with certain indefensible ex
ceptions at the beginning of fall se
mesters, been regarded as under the
ban. The Council expects a like co
operation in eliminating every form of
tubbing at Stanford.
Other Discipline for Freshmen.
Finally, the Council desired to ex
press its hearty appreciation of the
value of discipline for university stu
dents and particularly for freshmen.
It holies to see in the near future the
acceptance of definite methods by
which to enforce in freshmen compli
ance with the salutary customs which
j Stanford life imposes on them. It ex
pects to make recommendations along
this line to the conference.
Dr. Wilbur's letter to the Council
. follows:
Feb. 28, 1916.
Gentlemen:
In order to be sure that we under
i stand each other, 1 wish to outline the
I main points of our conversation today.
As far as student conduct is con-
I cerned, three main objects ai e 10 be
j attained:
1. The non-use of alcohol;
2. Personal morality;
3. Good sound Americanism.
The first two go together and are
vital for the future welfare and hap
piness of the individual. One mis
take here may have life-time conse
quences. The practice of hazing is
contrary to the full development of
those independent, self-respecting in
dividuals that we want to see at. Stan
ford and in this country. As I said
in addressing you a while ago:
Hazing is a combination of coward
j ice and bullying, absolutely un-Amer-
I ican. It overpowers and crushes the
| individual. Its essence is superiority
I in numbers on the one side. At the
! best it is contemptible and at the
I worst criminal. No one who delights
| in fair play, in the American spirit,
I can ever get any satisfaction from
'such an act. If student control is to
i succeed, all of its units must be equal
j and elected leaders followed and hon
jored. If one part of those governed
can be hazed indiscrmlnately by an
! other, then self- government falls flat
| right there. A democracy no longer
! exists.

Dr. Wilbur's letter to the Council
. follows:
Feb. 28, 1916.
Gentlemen:
In order to be sure that we under
i stand each other, 1 wish to outline the
I main points of our conversation today.
As far as student conduct is con-
I cerned, three main objects ai e 10 be
j attained:
1. The non-use of alcohol;
2. Personal morality;
3. Good sound Americanism.
The first two go together and are
vital for the future welfare and hap
piness of the individual. One mis
take here may have life-time conse
quences. The practice of hazing is
contrary to the full development of
those independent, self-respecting in
dividuals that we want to see at. Stan
ford and in this country. As I said
in addressing you a while ago:
Hazing is a combination of coward
j ice and bullying, absolutely un-Amer-
I ican. It overpowers and crushes the
| individual. Its essence is superiority
I in numbers on the one side. At the
! best it is contemptible and at the
I worst criminal. No one who delights
| in fair play, in the American spirit,
I can ever get any satisfaction from
'such an act. If student control is to
i succeed, all of its units must be equal
j and elected leaders followed and hon
jored. If one part of those governed
can be hazed indiscrmlnately by an
! other, then self- government falls flat
| right there. A democracy no longer
! exists.
I realize that in the past there has
been gradually introduced into Stan
ford certain hazing customs that have
been accepted by some of the students
I as disciplinary and salutary. T wish
I to call your attention at this time
to the existing regulations in regard
to hazing, particularly to those of the
faculty and those published in the
Manual of Student Control, pages 12
and 13. Those in the Manual read:
"All practices of hazing are pro
hibited. Hazing is defined as "includ
ing all practices which compel a stu
dent to submit to treatment from fel
low students that is humiliating or
dangerous," and such practices are
considered "an infringement of per
sonal liberty and an offense against
good order." By Faculty Committee,
August 27, 1910.
The practice of "tubbing" is specific
ally included in the above definition,
and prohibited. By Faculty Commit
tee, September 2, 1910.
112 call your attention also to the
specific rule of the Trustees, passed
August 25, 1911, at page 175 of the
Trustees' Manual: "Resolved, That
the Business Manager be requested to
embody in the rules and regulations
governing Encina Hall a clause pro
hibiting hazing in all forms, includ
ing tubbing and all other interference
with the personal liberty of students,
and that all applicants for rooms in
Encina Hall be required to sign an
agreement to observe and abide by
all the rules and regulations."
It is my duty to see that these regu
lations are carried out. It is the duty
of those responsible for the proper
conduct of student pelf-government
to see that they live within the exist
ing rules of the University, and that
they do not condone or overlook any
thing that is contrary to University
legislation. If the rules as they exist
are not consistent with student self
government, then after due considera
tion the changes thought necessary
can be asked for with the reasons for
such proposed changes. I will trans
mit such authoritative request to the
proper University bodies for consid
eration.
Student self-government means re
sponsibility. It should mean per
sonal self-respect, personal dignity,
and should be a most vital and desir
able part of the life of a student. If
it has to be held up by lawlessness
and by personal affront, it is surely
being putin a false position.
I ask therefore for a thorough study
of the situation in order that we may
all know the law, understand it and
live up to it. The University is no
place for unwritten law, favoritism,
and privilege.
Very truly yours,
RAY LYMAN WILBUR,
President.
That tubbing for discipline and tub
bing for hazing fails under the same
category and therefore will be dealt
with as a misdemeanor in the future,
is the decision of the Student Coun
cil, as the result of investigation
brought about by the case of L). M.
Ross, '19, who wished to have certain
sophomores brought before Palo Alto
courts for administering the aquatic
reprimand.
However, the Council decided to end
the present case of Ross by repri
manding the four sophomores who had
most immediate responsibility for the
tubbing of Ross. The Council .also
suggested that another means of en
forcing discipline be found both in
fraternities and clubs.
The stand of the Council on the
tubbing question is clearly given in a
statement sent to President Wilbur,
with whom the members conferred
regarding the case of Ross. This
statement and one from President
Wilbur is published in this issue Of
The Daily Palo Alto, giving the is
sues involved, and expressing the pol
icies that will be enforced in the fu
ture.
Following is the statement of Stu
dent Adviser Otis H. Castle, made with
the sanction of President C. M. Miller
and other members of the conference:
The Council examined a large num
ber of witnesses to the tubbing, as
well as many others who were able to
throw light on the procedure of the
evening. Its findings of fact follow:
On the evening in question the mem
bers of Encina Club believed that it
had become necessary to punish cer
tain freshmen for breaches of the in
ternal regulations of the club, which
regulations they considered the fresh
men to have accepted by voluntarily
joining the organization. These tub
bings were inflicted with the knowl
edge of the president of the club,
and after he had warned the members
to use extreme care in selecting and
handling the men to be disciplined.
This admonition was frequently re
ferred to and carefully observed dur
ing the evening.
The method of procedure was to
take each freshman to a room and
give him a trial. The charges against
him were read, he was given an op
portunity to present a defense, and
a vote 011 his case was then taken
either by a show of hands or by rising.
Of eighteen freshmen so tried during
the evening, only six were punished.
These six men testified that they were
given a fair trial and carefully
handled. Ross received an ordinary
tubbing and no physical injury re
sulted.
(â– rounds For Tubbing Koss.
Granting for a moment that the men
were warranted in their belief that
they might undertake such disciplin
ary tubbing, they had from their point
of view grounds for tubbing Ross, pro
vided they reasonably considered him
a freshman. He had neglected the
duty expected of freshmen in con
nection with answering the 'phone
and decorating the club room for the
Encina "at homes." The Council con
sidered that they were warranted in
thinking Ross a freshman, because he
was credited with only 11 hours in
the Directory, had made no applica
tion for advanced standing, had worn
a freshman cap during the preceding
semester, and at that time was eating
at the "freshman end" of the table
without protest.
Interpretation of Tubbing Rule.
Of course these men were, in one
interpretation, violating the letter of
a University rule in tubbing at. all.
But here the Council believes that
the blame should fall on itself, to
gether with the officers of Encina
Club, and all faculty and student of
ficials who have been connected with
the control of students for many years
past, rather than on these particular
men. Relying on the common power
of courts to interpret codes, the var
ious authorities whose business it has
been to guard student conduct have
tacitly permitted to grow up a dis
tinction between tubbing as hazing
and infrequent, carefully supervised
tubbing within private groups for
disciplinary purposes. The Council
does not believe that severe punish
ment for relying on this interpreta
tion of the rule should be visited on
these men. It has, however, ordered
that the men be reprimanded for fail
ing to have responsible upperclass
men present, and for not giving Ross
a trial. In this last failure they
were partially, but not wholly justified
by the fact that Ross began to strike
at them before violent hands were
laid on him.
All Tubbing Now Barred.
The Council believes, however, that
this case marks an appropriate occas
ion to take a further step in the mat
ter of tubbing. It has accordingly an
nounced that all tubbing, both tubbing
as hazing and tubbing for discipline,
will hereafter be under the ban every
where on the campus. This announce
ment was made for three reasons,
aside from the foremost one, namely
that it is a violation of a University
rule, and "a University is no placc for
unwritten law." In the first place, as
strongly pointed out by President Wil
bur, in every practice of tubbing there
lurks a grave danger to the unfor
tunate victim who happens to have a
weak heart or some other constitu
tional defect. The possible benefits
of disciplinary tubbing do not warrant
taking this chance. Again, all forms
of tubbing are understood, or misun
derstood, alike by those unfamiliar
with university customs, and in their
eyes such practices bring odium upon
the institution. For a third reason,

although tubbing has in fact been
practiced merely to enforce internal
rules of private organizations, the idea
lias been spreading that it is actually
a "pro])" for student control. Those
who jealously guard the success of
that institution realize that such an
impression must be immediately
stamped out.
Expect Support of All Men.
For these reasons the Council felt
that it must take the new stand. It
is encouraged to believe that in this
stand it will have the support of all
Stanford men, because of the spirit
shown in connection with tubbing dur
ing recent years. Formerly the strin
gent rules against the practice were
notoriously dead letters, and tubbing
as hazing was rampant. In recent
years a spirit has been carefully fos
tered among the men which has led
them to distinguish between tubbing
as hazing and tubbing in a sober spirit
for disciplinary purposes. The for
mer has, with certain indefensible ex
ceptions at the beginning of fall se
mesters, been regarded as under the
ban. The Council expects a like co
operation in eliminating every form of
tubbing at Stanford.
Other Discipline for Freshmen.
Finally, the Council desired to ex
press its hearty appreciation of the
value of discipline for university stu
dents and particularly for freshmen.
It holies to see in the near future the
acceptance of definite methods by
which to enforce in freshmen compli
ance with the salutary customs which
j Stanford life imposes on them. It ex
pects to make recommendations along
this line to the conference.

rules of private organizations, the idea
lias been spreading that it is actually
a "pro])" for student control. Those
who jealously guard the success of
that institution realize that such an
impression must be immediately
stamped out.
Expect Support of All Men.
For these reasons the Council felt
that it must take the new stand. It
is encouraged to believe that in this
stand it will have the support of all
Stanford men, because of the spirit
shown in connection with tubbing dur
ing recent years. Formerly the strin
gent rules against the practice were
notoriously dead letters, and tubbing
as hazing was rampant. In recent
years a spirit has been carefully fos
tered among the men which has led
them to distinguish between tubbing
as hazing and tubbing in a sober spirit
for disciplinary purposes. The for
mer has, with certain indefensible ex
ceptions at the beginning of fall se
mesters, been regarded as under the
ban. The Council expects a like co
operation in eliminating every form of
tubbing at Stanford.
Other Discipline for Freshmen.
Finally, the Council desired to ex
press its hearty appreciation of the
value of discipline for university stu
dents and particularly for freshmen.
It holies to see in the near future the
acceptance of definite methods by
which to enforce in freshmen compli
ance with the salutary customs which
j Stanford life imposes on them. It ex
pects to make recommendations along
this line to the conference.
Dr. Wilbur's letter to the Council
. follows:
Feb. 28, 1916.
Gentlemen:
In order to be sure that we under
i stand each other, 1 wish to outline the
I main points of our conversation today.
As far as student conduct is con-
I cerned, three main objects ai e 10 be
j attained:
1. The non-use of alcohol;
2. Personal morality;
3. Good sound Americanism.
The first two go together and are
vital for the future welfare and hap
piness of the individual. One mis
take here may have life-time conse
quences. The practice of hazing is
contrary to the full development of
those independent, self-respecting in
dividuals that we want to see at. Stan
ford and in this country. As I said
in addressing you a while ago:
Hazing is a combination of coward
j ice and bullying, absolutely un-Amer-
I ican. It overpowers and crushes the
| individual. Its essence is superiority
I in numbers on the one side. At the
! best it is contemptible and at the
I worst criminal. No one who delights
| in fair play, in the American spirit,
I can ever get any satisfaction from
'such an act. If student control is to
i succeed, all of its units must be equal
j and elected leaders followed and hon
jored. If one part of those governed
can be hazed indiscrmlnately by an
! other, then self- government falls flat
| right there. A democracy no longer
! exists.
I realize that in the past there has
been gradually introduced into Stan
ford certain hazing customs that have
been accepted by some of the students
I as disciplinary and salutary. T wish
I to call your attention at this time
to the existing regulations in regard
to hazing, particularly to those of the
faculty and those published in the
Manual of Student Control, pages 12
and 13. Those in the Manual read:
"All practices of hazing are pro
hibited. Hazing is defined as "includ
ing all practices which compel a stu
dent to submit to treatment from fel
low students that is humiliating or
dangerous," and such practices are
considered "an infringement of per
sonal liberty and an offense against
good order." By Faculty Committee,
August 27, 1910.
The practice of "tubbing" is specific
ally included in the above definition,
and prohibited. By Faculty Commit
tee, September 2, 1910.
112 call your attention also to the
specific rule of the Trustees, passed
August 25, 1911, at page 175 of the
Trustees' Manual: "Resolved, That
the Business Manager be requested to
embody in the rules and regulations
governing Encina Hall a clause pro
hibiting hazing in all forms, includ
ing tubbing and all other interference
with the personal liberty of students,
and that all applicants for rooms in
Encina Hall be required to sign an
agreement to observe and abide by
all the rules and regulations."
It is my duty to see that these regu
lations are carried out. It is the duty
of those responsible for the proper
conduct of student pelf-government
to see that they live within the exist
ing rules of the University, and that
they do not condone or overlook any
thing that is contrary to University
legislation. If the rules as they exist
are not consistent with student self
government, then after due considera
tion the changes thought necessary
can be asked for with the reasons for
such proposed changes. I will trans
mit such authoritative request to the
proper University bodies for consid
eration.
Student self-government means re
sponsibility. It should mean per
sonal self-respect, personal dignity,
and should be a most vital and desir
able part of the life of a student. If
it has to be held up by lawlessness
and by personal affront, it is surely
being putin a false position.
I ask therefore for a thorough study
of the situation in order that we may
all know the law, understand it and
live up to it. The University is no
place for unwritten law, favoritism,
and privilege.
Very truly yours,
RAY LYMAN WILBUR,
President.
That tubbing for discipline and tub
bing for hazing fails under the same
category and therefore will be dealt
with as a misdemeanor in the future,
is the decision of the Student Coun
cil, as the result of investigation
brought about by the case of L). M.
Ross, '19, who wished to have certain
sophomores brought before Palo Alto
courts for administering the aquatic
reprimand.
However, the Council decided to end
the present case of Ross by repri
manding the four sophomores who had
most immediate responsibility for the
tubbing of Ross. The Council .also
suggested that another means of en
forcing discipline be found both in
fraternities and clubs.
The stand of the Council on the
tubbing question is clearly given in a
statement sent to President Wilbur,
with whom the members conferred
regarding the case of Ross. This
statement and one from President
Wilbur is published in this issue Of
The Daily Palo Alto, giving the is
sues involved, and expressing the pol
icies that will be enforced in the fu
ture.
Following is the statement of Stu
dent Adviser Otis H. Castle, made with
the sanction of President C. M. Miller
and other members of the conference:
The Council examined a large num
ber of witnesses to the tubbing, as
well as many others who were able to
throw light on the procedure of the
evening. Its findings of fact follow:
On the evening in question the mem
bers of Encina Club believed that it
had become necessary to punish cer
tain freshmen for breaches of the in
ternal regulations of the club, which
regulations they considered the fresh
men to have accepted by voluntarily
joining the organization. These tub
bings were inflicted with the knowl
edge of the president of the club,
and after he had warned the members
to use extreme care in selecting and
handling the men to be disciplined.
This admonition was frequently re
ferred to and carefully observed dur
ing the evening.
The method of procedure was to
take each freshman to a room and
give him a trial. The charges against
him were read, he was given an op
portunity to present a defense, and
a vote 011 his case was then taken
either by a show of hands or by rising.
Of eighteen freshmen so tried during
the evening, only six were punished.
These six men testified that they were
given a fair trial and carefully
handled. Ross received an ordinary
tubbing and no physical injury re
sulted.
(â– rounds For Tubbing Koss.
Granting for a moment that the men
were warranted in their belief that
they might undertake such disciplin
ary tubbing, they had from their point
of view grounds for tubbing Ross, pro
vided they reasonably considered him
a freshman. He had neglected the
duty expected of freshmen in con
nection with answering the 'phone
and decorating the club room for the
Encina "at homes." The Council con
sidered that they were warranted in
thinking Ross a freshman, because he
was credited with only 11 hours in
the Directory, had made no applica
tion for advanced standing, had worn
a freshman cap during the preceding
semester, and at that time was eating
at the "freshman end" of the table
without protest.
Interpretation of Tubbing Rule.
Of course these men were, in one
interpretation, violating the letter of
a University rule in tubbing at. all.
But here the Council believes that
the blame should fall on itself, to
gether with the officers of Encina
Club, and all faculty and student of
ficials who have been connected with
the control of students for many years
past, rather than on these particular
men. Relying on the common power
of courts to interpret codes, the var
ious authorities whose business it has
been to guard student conduct have
tacitly permitted to grow up a dis
tinction between tubbing as hazing
and infrequent, carefully supervised
tubbing within private groups for
disciplinary purposes. The Council
does not believe that severe punish
ment for relying on this interpreta
tion of the rule should be visited on
these men. It has, however, ordered
that the men be reprimanded for fail
ing to have responsible upperclass
men present, and for not giving Ross
a trial. In this last failure they
were partially, but not wholly justified
by the fact that Ross began to strike
at them before violent hands were
laid on him.
All Tubbing Now Barred.
The Council believes, however, that
this case marks an appropriate occas
ion to take a further step in the mat
ter of tubbing. It has accordingly an
nounced that all tubbing, both tubbing
as hazing and tubbing for discipline,
will hereafter be under the ban every
where on the campus. This announce
ment was made for three reasons,
aside from the foremost one, namely
that it is a violation of a University
rule, and "a University is no placc for
unwritten law." In the first place, as
strongly pointed out by President Wil
bur, in every practice of tubbing there
lurks a grave danger to the unfor
tunate victim who happens to have a
weak heart or some other constitu
tional defect. The possible benefits
of disciplinary tubbing do not warrant
taking this chance. Again, all forms
of tubbing are understood, or misun
derstood, alike by those unfamiliar
with university customs, and in their
eyes such practices bring odium upon
the institution. For a third reason,

although tubbing has in fact been
practiced merely to enforce internal
rules of private organizations, the idea
lias been spreading that it is actually
a "pro])" for student control. Those
who jealously guard the success of
that institution realize that such an
