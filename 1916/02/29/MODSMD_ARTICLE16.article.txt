A trivial incident has brought stu
dent government close to the shoals
and skillful management has been
necessary to get the good ship headed
toward the open sea again. Danger
is passed now if a reasonable amount
of care is exercised by the captain
and his crew —which latter term in
cludes all of us.
The incident has caused unpleasant
thoughts for all who have the interest
of student government at heart. Un
easiness during the last few days has
not been confined to the half-dozen
sophomores who were directly impli
cated.
The value of student control is ap
preciated more today than it was a
week ago. Every student on the cam
pus would come to recognize its value
to the student body if it should be
suddenly taken away. Its superiority
over the only substitute would then be
so poignantly felt that it would be
brought home even to those who want
to believe that it is a failure.
This realization and co-operation as
a result of it must be effected without
any such jolts, or the jolts are sure to
come. The man who is for student
control but "agin its enforcement,"
and the man who is indifferent to the
value of student control are the onea
who will cause its downfall if such
downfall must come.
But such an occurrence can be
avoided by the co-operation of the stu
dent body. The last shoals are not
passed—but they can be avoided.
