# Double Plays

Stanford's victory over the Univer
sity of Santa Clara team last week, on
the Mission Town diamond, lias
caused the coach. Fitzgerald, of the
Catholic tossers, to make some drastic
changes in their lineup. At the pres
ent time, but one player outside the
pitchers, is occupying the same berth
on the team that they did before the
Cardinal-Santa Clara game. Tliis is
Desmond, in right field. Brica, Emer
son, Conners, and Preciado have been
temporarily dropped from the varsity
squad, and all the other players have
i been shifted to other positions. Cap
tain Sheehan is now covering second
base instead of his usual First sack
job.

A very noticeable improvement has
come over the members of the local
varsity. The game put up against the
j fast Ambrose Tailors last Wednes
| day was all that could bp desired of
any team. It looks like the nine has
| hit a winning stride, and with the
1 continuance of the splendid coaching
I of Harry Wolter, should come through
in excellent style this season.

"Mush" Stevens continues to keep
up his fast fielding around the third
base sack. In the last three games
he has robbed opposing batters of
no less than four clean hits. Stevens
is hitting the ball regularly, too,
which means much for any team.

With the coming through, so to
speak, of "Burt" Mattei in the Am
brose Tailors' game, Stanford now has
four good boxsmen to send to the
mound at any time. Hoever, "Wicker
sham, Howe, and Mattei form a staff
that compares favorably with all pre
vious Cardinal delegations of twirlers.

The peanut league is serving up a
brand of baseball that is of high
order. There are men now playing on
the faculty and auxiliary fields that
will be on the inside squad within a
short time. The game between the
Polytechnic High school of San Fran
cisco. and the second varsity, while
short in duration, showed that the
men who make up the peanut league
are ball players of no mean ability.
