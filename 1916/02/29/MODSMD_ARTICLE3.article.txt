# Great Divide Draws a Large Seat Sale
## Scramble for Tickets Predicts Success of English Club Show 
### 
This afternoon's seat-sale for the
English Club play, "The Great Divide,"
was one of ihe most satisfactory in
recent years of Stanford dramatics,
and promises to surpass all previous
sales of this year.
Tho interest in ' The Great Divide"
will he more than justified by the cal
iber of the performance. For the past
three years every play given in the
Assembly Hall has been measured up
to "The Only Way," and has been
found wanting. After Friday evening
campus dramatics will be dated from
the performance of "The Great Di
vide."
Much of this is due to the outstand
ing work of W. B. Owens, who has
filled the leading role for both pro
ductions. But "The Great Divide" is
not a one-man play. It will have
every role filled with an actor well
fitted to it.
Opposite Owens, Miss Nellita Choate
will play the difficult role of Ruth
Jordan. The part calls for strong
acting of an emotional cast not often
demanded in the usual type of cam
pus performances. Miss Choate has
in this part an opportunity which does
not often come to the Stanford actor.
No one will be admitted to the final
rehearsal, or the dress rehearsal Wed
nesday evening. Absolutely no ex
ceptions will be made to this rule,
according to the play committee.
