# UNION CAMPAIGN HAS RAISED MEMBERSHIP
## Row and Hall Men Respond To Board of Governors' Canvass 
### 
From the showing made at the pres
ent time in the membership campaign,
launched by the Union Board of Gov
ernors, indications point to a larger
number of card holders this semester
than ever before. A. H. McEuen, '17,
chairman of the campaign committee,
has requested that solicitors in the
Hall and on the Row turn in a report
immediately, at the cigar stand in the
Union .giving the percentage of mem
bers in each house.
One house already has a 100 per
cent average. Several others are bat
ting high and so far none have fallen
below the ~>o per cent mark. A re
port will be published in a few days
stating the exact results of the cam
paign.
