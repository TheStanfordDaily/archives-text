# MIDWEEK GAME BRINGS AMBROSE TAILORS AS OPPONENTS
## DENT NAMES STRONG TEAM Varsity and Clothes Fitters Stand One Game Each For Season 
### 
Ambrose Tailors will journey to the
Stanford campus tomorrow to meet
the Cardinal varsity for the third time
this season. Graduate Manager Beh
rens announced that he had obtained
the services of Jack McCarthy as um
pire again, thus giving assurance of
a fast contest. He will start the
game promptly at 4:15, and the fnir
nine innings will in all probability
be run off. The gates can be passed
for the usual twenty-five cents or sea
son tickets.
The visitors took the first contest,
while the varsity came back for a
win last Wednesday. This leaves the
season's play between these two teams
even up, giving added importance to
the mid-week contest tomorrow, as it
is in the nature of a rubber. With
out doubt, the "clothes fitters" will
bring a speedy aggregation of ball
players to the Stanford lot. Such men
as Powers, Klawitter, Kraft, Bank
head, Lynch, Murani, Starasinich, and
Holstrum are ball tossers of note, and
will furnish excellent competition for
any college contingent.
Captain "Babe" Dent will use the
following men in the game tomorrow,
although a few substitutes may be given
an opportunity to show their class in
the National pastime. Hoever will
start in the box, with Howe and Mattei
ready to relieve him at any time.
Wickersham is being saved for Satur
day's contest with the University of
Santa Clara. Dent will handle the
team from the catcher's position, as
usual. Hayes will play first, Stafford
will cover second, Stevens will handle
third, and Braden will cavort around
short. The outfield will be taken care
of by Sanborn in left, Lander in cen
ter, and Noonan in right.
