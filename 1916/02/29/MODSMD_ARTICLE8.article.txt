# Founders' Day Program Complete For Biggest Event of Present Year
## 
### 
To place Founders' Day on the
year's program as the biggest event
of all is the aim of the committee in
charge of preparations for thi"s year's
ceremonies in honor of Stanford's
founders.
Exercises will begin in the morning
with Jin assembly at 10:30. Dr. Wilbur
will preside over this meeting, at
which President Benjamin Ide Wheeler
of the University of California will be
the speaker. The Stanford Hand will
open the morning exercises with an
overture, and will play "Hail, Stan
ford. Hail," at the close.
According to President W. L. Noon
an, seniors will attend the morning ex
ercises en masse. They will wait out
side until the assembly has gathered,
and will march in together. At the
close of Dr. Wheeler's address, and
after the Stanford anthem, the fourth
year students will march out while
the remainder of the audience w r aits
until they have passed.
The seniors will then go to the
Mausoleum, where the usual class px
ercises in honor of the Stanfords will
be held. This will conclude the morn
ing exercises.
Present plans are to open the af
ternoon crrernonies with a classical
concert by the Stanford Band, at 2
o'clock. This will be given on the
Inner Quad, in all probability. Pro
fessor Martin is now working on a
concert befitting the occasion.
A change from the rather dignified
exercises will be supplied in the form
of a baseball game with Santa Clara.
The game will be called immediately
at the close of the band concert on
the Quad. The band will probably
march from the Quad to the diamond,
to play some rousing opening airs for
the benefit of the bleachers.
Shortly after 6 o'clock students and
alumni will gather at the Women's
Club House for the annual Founders'
Day banquet. This banquet is in
charge of alumni, but is for the pleas
ure of students, faculty, and gradu
ates. A number of speakers will be
secured by .T. E. McDowell, who has
charge of the entertainment at the
banquet, and music will be supplied
by Blumenthal's orchestra, which has
volunteered its services.
Tickets entitling bearers to plates
at the dinner can be secured from As
sistant Registrar McDowell. As but
three hundred can be accommodated
at the meal in the Club House, it !s
necessary that, applications for the
tickets be made promptly.
Following the banquet, festivities
will be transferred to the Stanford
Union, where a dance will be held
during the evening. Everyone on the
campus is invited to the dance,
whether or not he attends the ban
quet.
