# UNDERCLASS RUSH ENDS IN FAVOR OF FIRST YEAR MEN
## 
### 
Freshmen won the annual under
class baseball rush this morning by
returning the marked sphere to Cap
tain "Babe" Dent at 7 a.m.
Sophomores are claiming a victory
in the national sport, however, due
largely to the appearance of the score
at the end of the first and only inning,
which chalked up as 3 to 0.
The game was called promptly at
4:30, by Coach Harry Wolter, who
acted as referee. However, no first
year team appeared to oppose the so
pliomores, and a hurried consultation
resulted in an impromptu nine, with
"Bobby" Pelouze on the mound. The
second year men were first at bat and
garnered three runs off Pelouze, who
pitched a good game, but was poorly
supported by his colleagues. The
freshmen scored no runs.
At this juncture of the game the
official freshman team, which has been
sojourning entirely voluntarily in San
Jose to escape the second year men,
arrived via the back lot. Foresight
led the sophomores to charge onto
the diamond, and Captain Dent heaved
a marked ball high into the air. Af
ter a general scramble, the sphere
took an aerial trip over the fence,
where it was hidden by freshmen.
Last night the sophomores searched
from 10 o'clock to 2 to locate the ball,
but were not successful.
According to "Babe" Dent, baseball
rushes are profitable affairs. Dent
donated one ball to the cause, and
three have been returned to him, two
by freshmen and one by sophomores.
However, the official sphere was
brought in this morning at 7 o'clock
by a bevy of freshmen, who thereby
won claim to victory in the rush.
