Mut'ord Williams, '16, chairman of
the committee in charge of the Track
Dance, has settled the floor question
definitely. In past times, fixing the
floor for dances in the gym has been
the big problem, and the oatmeal
finish of the Crew Dance made the
ballroom resemble a flour mill on a
windy day, so they say, after the
dancers had had time to grind the
meal to a powdery dust.
No more troubles. The floor will
be like a mirror with real wax, and
will be "unsurpassed by any on the
coast," according to the committee.
Incidentally, dates are now being
made ,and tickets are on sale by
Graduate Manager Behrens, Bufofi!
