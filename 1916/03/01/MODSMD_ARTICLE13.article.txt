# Cardinal Quintet Meets Califoria Saturday
## 
### 
Stanford and California clash in the
second game of the intercollegiate
basketball series at Harmon gymnas
ium, Berkeley, Saturday evening.
The first game, which resulted in a
32-28 victory for California, was one
of t lie closest contests that team lias
had this season. Any over-confidence
the Blue and Gold quintet may have
had before the game passed away with
the game itself.
Aside from Saturday night's contest
witli California, only one game re
mains for the Cardinal League sched
ule. That will be played here on
March 11 with the College of the Pa
cific team.
