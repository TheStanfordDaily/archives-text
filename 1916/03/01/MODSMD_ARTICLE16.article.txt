# 1917 Nine Downs Senior Team, 5-4
## Seventh Inning Batting Rally Gives Juniors Victory in Class Series 
### 
Coming from behind 111 the seventh
inning, with two runs, one a clean
steal home by "Mush" Stevens, the
Juniors nosed out a 5 to 4 victory
over the Seniors in the annual upper
class hasehall game of the interclass
series, yesterday afternoon, 011 the
varsity diamond.
When Captains 'Doc" Hayes of the
Seniors, and ".loe" Lander of the
third year men, announced their re
spective lineups, the dopesters figured
it out as an even break, and such it
was. There was little to choose be
tween the two nines, and the twirling
of Hayes and Stafford was about
equal, both whiffing seven would-be
sluggers, although the latter allowed
six prospective grads free transporta
tion to the initial cushion.
The Juniors secured one in the
third, one in the fifth, one in the
sixth, and two in the lucky seventh,
while the Seniors gathered one tally
in the second, one in the fourth, and
two in the fifth.
The features of the game were the
hitting of Stevens, including his base
stealing escapade, and the remark
able fielding of southpaw Wickersbam.
"Babe" Dent caused many a laugh
from the fairly crowded bleachers, by
his comical playing at the first base
j sack.
The winning Juniors will tangle
with the Sophomores for the inter
| class championslip tomorrow at 4
i o'clock, on the Cardinal lot.

Coming from behind 111 the seventh
inning, with two runs, one a clean
steal home by "Mush" Stevens, the
Juniors nosed out a 5 to 4 victory
over the Seniors in the annual upper
class hasehall game of the interclass
series, yesterday afternoon, 011 the
varsity diamond.
When Captains 'Doc" Hayes of the
Seniors, and ".loe" Lander of the
third year men, announced their re
spective lineups, the dopesters figured
it out as an even break, and such it
was. There was little to choose be
tween the two nines, and the twirling
of Hayes and Stafford was about
equal, both whiffing seven would-be
sluggers, although the latter allowed
six prospective grads free transporta
tion to the initial cushion.
The Juniors secured one in the
third, one in the fifth, one in the
sixth, and two in the lucky seventh,
while the Seniors gathered one tally
in the second, one in the fourth, and
two in the fifth.
The features of the game were the
hitting of Stevens, including his base
stealing escapade, and the remark
able fielding of southpaw Wickersbam.
"Babe" Dent caused many a laugh
from the fairly crowded bleachers, by
his comical playing at the first base
j sack.
