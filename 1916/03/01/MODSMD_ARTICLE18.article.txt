Somebody wrote a one-act play once
upon a time that isn't going to be
produced at Stanford. Which is un
fortunate. The name of this sketch
is "How the Story Grew," and it deals
with the proclivities of the fairer sex
in enlarging upon facts in the state
ments they make while attending one
of those highly exciting sewing bees.
It didn't even take white lies, which
have been damned and defended in
turn, recently, by Berkeley and San
Francisco ministers, to make the par
ticular story grow—only a number of
well-oiled imaginations working indi
vidually and in unison.
The play has a moral, so it's just as
well that it isn't going to be produced
at Stanford. The moral wouldn't hit
home. All the men in the audience
would take it as a typical example
of what women do after they get
through talking about how "really
dreadful" a friend looks in a new
dress which they all wish was theirs.
And the women wouldn't even take
the trouble to answer the accusation.
Making stories grow from trivial in
cidents —or no incidents —is having a
bad effect for Stanford men. Some
body saw somebody else take a glass
of beer a while back, and after pass
ing through several hands the report
came to the Student Affairs Commit
tee that there is more drinking at
Stanford now than at any time in the
past, and that student life on the
campus is one continual orgy.
If such a report were true it would
hurt—and the mere fact that it isn't
true doesn't keep people unacquainted
with the facts from believing it when
it conies from somebody on the cam
pus who doesn't know the facts and is
taking another's word for it.
That sort of a report is not helping
the officials of student government in
their attempt to make student control 1
effective. Another thing that isn't
doing a great deal of good and is
prevalent among both students and
faculty members, is the custom of
making charges which presumably
can be substantiated by facts, which
facts the person making the charges
refuses to divulge. That sort of thing
keeps the Student Council busy—and
doesn't help it get anywhere in elim
inating the cause of the charges. We
can't resist the temptation to draw a
moral even if they don't hit home.
Better think your story over before
you tell it. Then tell it to the right
persons, and be willing to back it up
with fact.

Somebody wrote a one-act play once
upon a time that isn't going to be
produced at Stanford. Which is un
fortunate. The name of this sketch
is "How the Story Grew," and it deals
with the proclivities of the fairer sex
in enlarging upon facts in the state
ments they make while attending one
of those highly exciting sewing bees.
It didn't even take white lies, which
have been damned and defended in
turn, recently, by Berkeley and San
Francisco ministers, to make the par
ticular story grow—only a number of
well-oiled imaginations working indi
vidually and in unison.
The play has a moral, so it's just as
well that it isn't going to be produced
at Stanford. The moral wouldn't hit
home. All the men in the audience
would take it as a typical example
of what women do after they get
through talking about how "really
dreadful" a friend looks in a new
dress which they all wish was theirs.
And the women wouldn't even take
the trouble to answer the accusation.
Making stories grow from trivial in
cidents —or no incidents —is having a
bad effect for Stanford men. Some
body saw somebody else take a glass
of beer a while back, and after pass
ing through several hands the report
came to the Student Affairs Commit
tee that there is more drinking at
Stanford now than at any time in the
past, and that student life on the
campus is one continual orgy.
If such a report were true it would
hurt—and the mere fact that it isn't
true doesn't keep people unacquainted
with the facts from believing it when
it conies from somebody on the cam
pus who doesn't know the facts and is
taking another's word for it.
That sort of a report is not helping
the officials of student government in
their attempt to make student control 1
effective. Another thing that isn't
doing a great deal of good and is
prevalent among both students and
faculty members, is the custom of
making charges which presumably
can be substantiated by facts, which
facts the person making the charges
refuses to divulge. That sort of thing
keeps the Student Council busy—and
doesn't help it get anywhere in elim
inating the cause of the charges. We
can't resist the temptation to draw a
moral even if they don't hit home.
Better think your story over before
you tell it. Then tell it to the right
