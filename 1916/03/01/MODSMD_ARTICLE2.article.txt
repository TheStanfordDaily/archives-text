# "Great Divide" Is Play of Generation
## Scenery and Acting Above Par. Plot Will Hold Interest Throughout 
### 
Somebody a few days ago, called
it"the play of the year." That was
after they had seen a rehearsal. But
the play of the year isn't it at all.
It is the play of the generation—of
this college generation.
"The Great Divide" isn't just going
to he well put on. When you come to
think of it just about every play we
have here is well done, as far as the
acting and setting goes. As for that,
it's going to he better acted and bet
ter staged than anything that has used
an evening behind the Assembly Hall
footlights this year.
Look at the cost if you have any
doubts about the acting—you can see
that it's going to be up at the top
notch in that department. And as far
as setting goes, if you could get into
the Assembly Hall you could take a look
at that new scene in the Grand Can
yon and then you'd go Friday just to
see how mighty fine that would look
with the lights making those purple
shadows show long and wavering.
But it isn't just acting and scenery
this time.

The play's the thing. It's one of
those plays that keep you guessing.
You don't know how it can ever come
out. But it does, and without your
help, too. If it weren't for the fact
that the English faculty has set up
the idea that a great play must be
Ibsen at least, you could say that it
was a great play. Don't though, be
cause that would scare away every
one but the highbrows. Then they
would go and say it didn't come up
to their expectations and would sug
gest that "Troilus and Cressida"
would have been a more seemly choice
for a University production.
Call it a great show and you'll hit
the nail on the head. It will be a
great show from the word go.
