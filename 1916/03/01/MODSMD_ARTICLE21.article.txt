Dearest Ma:
1 got your check yesterday and
as I was reading it over a gust of
wind came along and blew it out of
my hand. I had to hold onto my cap
while 1 chased the check down Lasuen
from the post-office. As 1 was cross
ing the car-track running like fury,
1 bumped into a girl I had never met
before, but was wanting to meet.
When I looked up after making a date
the check was gone. She said she
would lend me what money she had
but I couldn't accept it â€”I needed
more than six cents and a postage
stamp.
So I borrowed two dollars to get
tickets to "The Clreat Divide." Ac
cording to the length of the line for
tickets there will be some great divid
ing one of these evenings after the
bills have been paid. But according
to what I hear the bills are very
heavy. As I was saying 1 stood in
line an hour to get near the front.
Two gents offered me a dollar for my
place and three girls smiled. T pre
ferred the smile to the dollars but
didn't want to show partiality against
my own sex. I had place number
three.1 drew number 269, which
might win in a lottery but never in a
seat-sale. So I ran around again and
found a dog trying to endorse my
check with his teeth. He had funny
teeth and made marks like NSF. But
they'll cash anything around here.
So I paid back (he money I borrowed
and got two seats in the I.3th row
with number 25 which 1 found on the
sidewalk. Guess I didn't have good
luck yesterday. I'd a gone out with a
woman last night but it was the 29th
and the women around here are aw
fully ambitious. You'd rather see me
single until Junior Week at least,
wouldn't you, Ma? He good, and I'll
soe you one of these days. Much love
your SONNY.
