# Palo Alto and Freshman Track Stars to Compete Against Rest of Squad
## 
### 
Next Saturday morning at 10:30 the
freshmen out for track, combined with
Palo Alto cinderpath athletes, will
compete against the rest of the oval
squad in the first competitive meet of
the season. This basis for the divis
ion of the teams will result in a well
contested meet, and some very close
finishes are looked for. The full dis
tances will probably be run in most of
the events.
Track Captain "Ric" Tcmpleton and
Coach "Dad" Moulton have divided the
track candidates into two squads.
