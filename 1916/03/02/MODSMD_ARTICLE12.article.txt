# THREE DAYS WORK---800 DOLLARS
## Y.M.C.A. Adopts Slogan For Snappy Campaign 
### 
Local Y. M. C. A. members begin a
| three day whirlwind campaign Mon-
Jday morning to raise the annual bud
get that goes to support Association
work on the campus and in China.
The activities in China, which Stan
ford men help support, is carried on
now by R. 11. Lockwood, formerly sec
retary here, who left this country last
summer to take up work near Canton.
For a number of years, the Stan
ford foreign budget was sent to the
support of Roy Service, a University
of California man, doing Y. M. C. A.
work in China. However, the cabinet
of the local association has deemed
it advisable to support Lockwood,
with whom many Stanford men are
well acquainted, and who was one of
the most influential men that ever
came to the campus.
Two Years Stanford Secretary.
Lockwood is a graduate of DuPanw
University .where he was active in
student affairs, editing the DePauw
Daily, and debating on the college
teams. He was a graduate student

lat the University of Wisconsin for
J two years, and later became a secr
| tary in the Pittsburg Y. M. C. A. He
was secretary at Stanford for two
(years, and was largely responsible for
making the local organization an ac
| five working body dealing with up-to
-1 date problems.
Hope to liaise $SOO.
The 191G campaign mark of the
local Y. M. C. A. will be set at $SOO.
| This was the sum set as a goal last
; year and more than that amount was
subscribed in the three-day cam
' paign. Of this sum $37f> was sent to
I support the missionary work of tfie
| Y. M. C. A. in China.
The Y. M. C. A. China secretaries,
whose work has been the raising of the
| young Chinese from the state of ig
[ norance existing in that country after
i the great awakening of recent years,
( have been supported largely by col
lege men of the country. The com
bined contributions of colleges last
year was $220,000. Of this sum Stan
ford sent $;'>7. r ). Yale supports a col
lege and hospital regularly in China,
Princeton spends $11,000 annually in
supporting the Pekin Y. M. C. A., and
practically every college in the United
States of any size and prestige has
heeti active in Chinese Y. M. C. A
work.
Launch Lightning Campaign.
Members of the Stanford Y. M, C.
A. are being organized into teams to
cover the campus and Palo Alto in
the three day lighning financial cam
paign. Lunches will be held in the
Engineering basement each noon, at
which reports of the standings of the
teams will be heard.
A good portion of the sum raised
in the campaign will go toward sup
porting the Y. M. C. A. here. How
ever, the majority of the support
which the home association receives
comes from outsiders, in spite of the
fact that the better part of the work
taken up is directly for the benefit of
the student body.

For a number of years, the Stan
ford foreign budget was sent to the
support of Roy Service, a University
of California man, doing Y. M. C. A.
work in China. However, the cabinet
of the local association has deemed
it advisable to support Lockwood,
with whom many Stanford men are
well acquainted, and who was one of
the most influential men that ever
came to the campus.

practically every college in the United

Launch Lightning Campaign.
Members of the Stanford Y. M, C.
A. are being organized into teams to
cover the campus and Palo Alto in

A good portion of the sum raised
in the campaign will go toward sup
porting the Y. M. C. A. here. How

which the home association receives
comes from outsiders, in spite of the
fact that the better part of the work
taken up is directly for the benefit of
the student body.
