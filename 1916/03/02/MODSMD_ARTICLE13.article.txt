# EXPECT BIGGEST CROWD OF YEAR
## 
### 
The campus public seems to be
getting 011 to the fact that "The Great.
Divide" is going to be a show that every
one who wants to be on the boat will
have to be able to say he saw. At
least the sale looks that way. It's
the largest before-the-game sale since
last year's Junior Opera.
Even at that there are seats still
to be bad. Houghs' accommodations
are available in profusion and even
queeners will still be able to get
seats within the regular two-some
lines.
As for the show, there's a scene on
the edge of the Grand Canyon that
will make every play committee of

I the future think twice to see if they
can't get a play that has at least one
scene in Arizona, so that they can use
that set. ft gets dark on the stage,
and the shadows look deep and blue
and mighty like the real thing.
After the play the reception for the
cast, to which all members of the
English department, faculty and Eng
lish Club are invited, will he held at
! the Kappa Kappa Gamma house.
The play committee has requested
I that no flowers he sent up over the
footlights, Friday evening. All flow
ers must he sent around to the stage
door or to the houses of the cast mem
bers for whom they are intended.
