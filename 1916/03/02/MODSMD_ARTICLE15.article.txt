Sufficient interest has again been
shown in the basketball situation to
warrant the calling of a meeting to dis
cuss the question of retaining the
game in major sport standing.
The PJxecutive Committee was fol
lowing the customary course of action
when it raised basketball to major
sport rank without a student body
vote. The standing of the sports has
always been determined by that body
in the past.
A wrong impression is abroad, if
people on the campus believe that
the committee wants to retain bas
ketball as a major sport against the
wishes of the student body. It has
been willing from the first to submit
the question to a vote after a student
assembly in which the merits of the
game and the advisability of retaining;
it as a major sport could be discussed.
An intelligent vote on the question
requires such an assembly. Many
students have talked the matter over
among themselves and have made up
their minds as to the best solution.
But there are others, probably more
numerous, who don't know the facts
and have given the matter no thought.
Doth of these classes should be at
Tuesday's meeting. The fact that ydn
have made up your mind already is no
reason for staying away. All the more
reason you should be there to join" in
the discussion.
