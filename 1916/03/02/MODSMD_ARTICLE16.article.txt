# And Pay Up

This is for seniors only—and for all
seniors. There's a real need back of
that appeal for the immediate pay
ment of class dues. We 1910 people
are assuming a bigger job than we
have ever undertaken before in pre
paring for Senior Week. Just because
other graduating classes have under
taken the same thing, and have gotten
by with it, isn't evidence that it isn't
a hard thing to get over.
One of the things that will aid in
making that difficult job a lighter one
is the knowledge now of just how
much money will be on hand to
finance the jolly-up time. The plans
of the committees are in the air de
pending on this information. Of
course you're going to pay that dollar
and a half eventually. Why not now?
