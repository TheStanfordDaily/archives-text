Editor The Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: In connection with the
agitation for military drill I would
like to quote from an editorial in
Engineering News for February 24.
The Editor says this: "We think
we should caution them, and all
others similarly inclined elsewhere,
about the magnitude and discomfort
of their task. Surely it is well to
turn aside all the easily discouraged,
and unfit, early in the development <Jf
this movement. * * * We should say
this even at the risk of seeming cold
to any reasonable plan for the or
ganization of our national defense —
an attitude which we must immedi
ately disclaim.
"Captain Robin in the opening lec
ture in New York (a series of lectures
is being given in that city for the
benefit of the engineers) repeatedly
harked back to the necessity for
stern military training for the would
be * * * soldiers. We should fail in
our patriotic duty did we not warn
all * * * men that they are assuming
a tedious gruelling task to get this
military preparation. It means long
hours of drill with arms, practice
marches, camp hardships, short ra
tions, and rough fare, exposure to
heat and storm. It means a program
that only the physically fit should un
dertake.
"There is no flag-waving about this
sort, of work—none of the glamour of
parade to encourage drooping spirits.
With a wise selection of recruits the
hard program will be carried through
manfully and the men will all show
the true patriotism that we are sure
they possess."
Surely this carries an appeal to
every vigorous Stanford man.
Respectfully,
