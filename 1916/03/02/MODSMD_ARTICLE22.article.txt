# Double Plays
## 
### 
Although the varsity game with the
Ambrose Tailors was postponed yes-

terday on account of the
wet diamond, the members
of the first string contin
gent have had good work
outs this week. In the
upperclass game nearly
every member of the var-

sity participated. Some of the men
showed up exceptionally well in
strange positions.

The official schedule calls for a Stan
ford-Santa Clara game in San Fran
cisco, next Saturday, but the powers
that be have figured otherwise. The
varsity will tangle with some first
class aggregation on the home dia
mond instead of battling on Ewing
Field. The Santa Clara game will be
played at a later date.
Captain '"Babe" Dent leads the reg
ulars with a .380% in batting, at the
latest figuring of the official scorer.
Hayes, Stevens, Stafford, and Sanborn
are also coming in for their share of
the hitting.

The freshmen team is no longer de
pendant upon one pitcher. "Shorty"
Kayser is out every night twirling
the mover for the first year gang,
and seems to have a good deal on the
ball. His work against the Palo Alto
High school team was of high order.
Peterson and Kayser together make
the freshmen strong in the box.
There are now two or three substi
tutes that are showing up fairly well
at other positions, but the original
lineup will in all probability be re
tained throughout the season.

Wickersham showed that he is an
excellent possibility for an outfield
berth when he pulled down several
hard drives in the interclass game.
If Wickersham is not needed in the
box he could be used in the Cardinal
outer gardens, as he hits them hard.
The varsity is rather weak in left
handers, too, and Wick, takes a cut at
them from the port side.
