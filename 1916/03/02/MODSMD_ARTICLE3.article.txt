# No More Roble "Queening" It's Not a Nice Word!
## 
### 
If "queening" isn't "queening," then
what is the popular campus sport
that "we" now indulge in? And then
again, if it is, is it a word of proper
dignity and refinement to be handed
down to coming generations via the
Roble Club constitution? These are
vital questions that have caused chaos
in the usual peace of the women's
dormitory.
The broadside attacks on campus
etymology was started when some
one moved that a clause be inserted
in the new Roble constitution for
bidding women to sign up to be out
after 10:30 for "queening" dates.
Those V/ho stand opposed to any adul
teration of the King's English led the
fight, against including the popular
term in so dignified a document as
the Roble constitution. They based
their arguments on the injustice of
arbitrarily handing such a word down
to generations that are to come.
However, when some one remarked
tbat the word had been handed down
from past generations, the meeting
broke up with a classification for
"two at the movies" still lacking.
rt has been suggested that Roble
constitutionalists accept the Illinois
term of "squiring," "wooing," or the
good old term of "courting." At least,
"courting" has the backing of Noah ;
Webster.
