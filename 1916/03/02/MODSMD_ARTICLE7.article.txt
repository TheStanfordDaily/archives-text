Work on the Senior Carnival begins
this year with plans well under way.
Hooths, concessions, stunts, and take
offs have been planned to the extent
that applications for right of space
should be made to IT. L. Hahn, chair
man of the Senior Carnial committee,
at once. Clubs and Individuals de
siring to put on shows should make
early arrangements for the sameâ€”
anyone is entitled to this privilege
and original or freak ideas will be
welcome.
ft is probable that the Carnival, to
be held May 18, will be given on
the Row, in compliance with the cus
tom of all previous Carnivals except
that of 1915. The committee urges
all to stay who have never witnessed
a Row Carnival, and promises an
unique display surpassing the F^iir
Zone or the Venice Midway.
