# CONFERENCE ISSUES A WARNING TO ROUGHS
## NO MORE EMBEZZLING FOOD Rule Passed Against Jeering of Visiting Teams on Diamond 
### 
Stricter compliance to the rule
against "roughing" at dances will
hereafter be demanded by the Student
Conference, according to action taken
at the meeting of that body last eve
ning. Unless there is a decided im
provement in the conduct of the men
who attend dances from the outside,
stringent disciplinary measures will
be the result. There have been sev
eral cases of stolen refreshments late
ly and a boldness that smacks of the
days before there was a rule pro
hibiting "roughing." The Conference
wishes to warn against any reptition
of these offenses.
Less Jeering on Bleachers.
Following the reading of a letter
from Associate Professor I). M. Fol
som, head of the Student Affairs Com
mittee. protesting against the jeering
of visiting baseball teams, the Con
ference passed a rule prohibiting this
practice. Hereafter any attempt to
ridicule or rattle either the umpire
or individual members of opposing
teams will be treated as a misde
meanor. Such action, it is felt, is out
of line with the spirit which should
be maintained at Stanford.
Professor Folsom's Letter.
Professor Folsom gave several rea-
ing to the plan of previous years.
Last year the campaign for eight hun
dred dollars resulted in the promise
of a sum somewhat in excess of that
amount.
This is but part of the financial
work necessary to support the Y. M.
C. A. work both on the campus and
in China, which latter place is the
particular place of foreign endeavor

chosen by the Stanford association.
Hut a small part of the money needed
to run the organization is given by
students, who, however, are the prin
cipal beneficiaries of the employment
bureau, lectures, and other enter
prises taken up by the association,
though considerable effort is spent, in
educating Greek workmen at Red
wood. boy scouts' work in neighbor
ing towns, and similar activities.
