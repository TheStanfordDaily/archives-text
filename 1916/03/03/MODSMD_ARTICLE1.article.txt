# CONFERENCE ISSUES A WARNING TO ROUGHS
## NO MORE EMBEZZLING FOOD Rule Passed Against Jeering of Visiting Teams on Diamond 
### 
Stricter compliance to the rule
against "roughing" at dances will
hereafter be demanded by the Student
Conference, according to action taken
at the meeting of that body last eve

ridicule or rattle either the umpire
or individual members of opposing
