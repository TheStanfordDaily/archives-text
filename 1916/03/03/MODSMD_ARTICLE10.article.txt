# STANFORD NINE PLAYS ST. MARY'S
## 
### 
Stanford varsity ball tossers will
hook up with the fast team of St.
Mary's College tomorrow afternoon
at 2:30, on the Cardinal diamond in
the main sporting attraction of the
week-end. Umpire Jack McCarthy
will announce the batteries promptly
at the scheduled time, so the full nine
innings will in fill probability be run
off before 4 o'clock. Season tickets
or twenty-five cents will allow spec
tators past the gate.
St. Mary's Nine Fast.
Tomorrow's headliner should be
one of the best games played on the
home lot this season. The Catholic
contingent has always been one of
the fastest nines on the coast, and

reports from the bay regions give
evidence that this year's squad is on
a par with past St. Mary's speed
burners. The local varsity is now in
splendid shape to meet them, how
ever. Coach Harry Wolter has put
the men through hard practices of
late, and both the infield and outer
gardens are well taken care of.

Captain "Babe" Dent announces
that the Stanford team will take the
field in tomorrow's battle as follows:
Iloever on the mound, with Wicker
sham and Mattei ready to warm up
at any moment; Dent will peg them
around the diamond from his regular
position behind the log. Hayes, Staf
ford, Stevens, and Braden will com
pose the infield, while the fly chasers
will be Sanborn, Lander, and Noonan.
A picked team from the peanut
Second Varsity Game,
league under the name of the Stan
ford second varsity, will play in the
morning at 10 o'clock. At a late hour
today thefr opponents had not been
determined, but it is definitely un
derstood that a game will be played'.
The freshmen will have a game if
a suitable tearn can be obtained to
meet the crack first year contingent.
The high schools in the near vicinity
do not seemed inclined to cross bats
with the Cardinal frosh, causing a
number of postponements of games
already. It is hoped that it will
be found expedient to have the two
"baby ball teams" of Stanford and
California meet near the end of the
season, but it is not known at this
time whether this will be possible.
