Tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock the
oval will he the scene of a dual track
meet that promises to bring out some
close finishes between two teams, one
of which, captained by "Fes" Murray,
will consist of all Palo Alto men and
freshmen, and the other, captained by
"Hill" Sisson, includes the remainder
of the track squad. Full distances
will he run in all events, except the
hurdles, for the first time tliis year.
The low hurdles are to be run over a
150-yard stretcli, while flic high
hurdle race will be 00 yards. In each
event there will be a novice heat
which will follow immediately after
the regular race.

Tiie meet promises to be a close one
as the squads are very evenly di
vided. Roth captains are optimistic
over fhe ability of their respective
teams. "Bill" Sisson's team, known
as the "Reds," appear to hav„ a win
ning combination in the distance and
middle distance evenfs, with Chap
man in the two-mile, Aupperle in the
mile, "Skin" Wilson in the half, and*
Ileal, Lynn, and Dievendorff in the
440-yard event. However, if the
"Reds" apear to have an advantage
here, it is offset by the strong team
that "Feg" has lined up to uphold the
reputation of the "Greens" in the
sprints and hurdles. The combination
of Murray, Norton, "Ric" Templeton,
and House is calculated to grab all
the points in the hurdle events. Tn
the sprints, Murray, Templeton, and
Wark will provide competition for
Grant, who represents the "Reds."
