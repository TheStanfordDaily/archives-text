Last, Campaign Successful.
The funds are not to be raised out
right., but are to be pledged, accord-
sons why this attitude is particularly
undesirable in his letter. "The prin
cipal objection of the faculty and a
large part of tbe alumni, to baseball
as a sport is based on this practice,"
he writes, "and their criticism is di
rected to the members of the team and
the coach rather than at ttie bleacher
athletes, where it properly belongs.
"Visiting teams are in a sense the
guests of Stanford, and our reputation
for fair sport is injured by such con
duct.. Stanford needs all the athletic
friends which we can get, and they
can best be secured by fair treatment
of all competitors. There is no ob
jection to cheering."
