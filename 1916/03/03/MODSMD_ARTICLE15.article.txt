# Make It a Big One

Benjamin Ide Wheeler is coming to
Stanford as more than a Founders'
Day speaker. The fact that he will
deliver the Founders' Day address
makes his visit an important one.
1-Ie also comes as a representative
of the University of California.
We need to come into closer touch
with the sister university across the
bay. Practically the only mutual in
terests that have been recognized by
the undergraduates of either univer
sity in the past have been athletic
interests. Perhaps that is natural for
they have forced themselves on us
most vividly.
But the other common interests—
the social and intellectual interests —
of the two great universities of the
West, arc pressing themselves for
ward. They will have to be recog
nized in the future.
It's safe to say that when wc know
the men across the bay better, the
course of athletic relations will be
smoother. But the men we have met
from California arc men who would
be well worth knowing even if they
never saw a football. To talk with
them and find out what another group
of students are doing and thinking
about is an awfully good cure for
provincialism.
The exchange visits of the presi
dents of California and Stanford are
factors which are aiding in this pro
cess of getting together. Dr. Wilbur
spoke to the students at California a
month ago, and his reception was
most cordial. Stanford students will
have the opportunity to welcome Dr.
Wheeler next Thursday.
