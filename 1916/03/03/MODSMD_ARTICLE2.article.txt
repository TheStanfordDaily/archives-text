# Cardinal Eleven to Meet Olympics

### 
Finishing touches preparatory for
the final game with California will be
put on Stanford's first team soccer
ites tomorrow afternoon, when they
meet an Olympic Cluh aggregation on
the Ocean Shore grounds in the city.
Although composed mostly of the
Winged O players, the opposing team
will also include a number of the
Rarbarian stars, and will present as
a whole an all-star combination, and
stiff competition for tlie Cardinal.
This is much the same team that
clashed with Stanford in the early
part of the season and took a 4 to 1
defeat.
Shifts In Lineup.
A glance at the lineup for tomor
row's game shows practically the
same arrangement as that of the last
California game, with the exception
of the right full berth, which is at
present being held down by Roney,
and a slight shift in the forward di
vision. Art Erb has changed from
center forward to inside left, Danny
Carroll taking his place, and Sid
Adams has moved over from inside
left to inside right.
The Cardinal eleven have been ex
hibiting excellent soccer during the
past two weeks and should stage some
speedy playing. No admission will be
charged. The game will be called
promptly at 3 o'clock. Stanford's
lineup follows: Ring, goal; Roney,
right full; Reynolds, left full; Will
iams, right half; Royle, center half;
McClung, left half; McMahon, outside
