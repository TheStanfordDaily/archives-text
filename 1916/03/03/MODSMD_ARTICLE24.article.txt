### 
Stanford will he represented by a
full swimming team at the Pacific
Coast championship meet at Sutro
Baths, in San Francisco, next Fri
day evening. Invitation to participate
comes through the Olympic Club, un
der whose auspices the swim is held,
and is extended to all swimmers on
the coast. University of California
will enter a full team led by "Ludy"
Langer, their captain, who was re
cently voted a Big C for his swim
ming prowess. Duke Kahanamoku,
the Hawaiian paddler, is slated to
compete, and the entries include stars
from along the entire coast.
Auckland, the lengthy Encina man,
will probably swim in the back-stroke,
unattached, as he is not registered.
The four-man relay team for Friday
has not yet been definitely decided
upon, since the series of handicap
swims now being held will have bear
ing on the final choice, but will prob
ably be made up from the following:
Caughey, Penniman, Goldsmith, Kirk
sey, and L. Pedley.
Other outside meets now being
planned insure ample competition for
all local swimming aspirants. The
Olympic Club will send a team here
for a meet on March 18, and the
freshman and varsity contests with
California will follow that. The dates
for the latter two have not yet been
set. With keen competition develop
ing among the local aquatic experts,
through the handicap system now be
ing carried out, Swimming Instructor
Brandsten believes the Cardinal will
give an excellent account of herself
in the coming contests.
