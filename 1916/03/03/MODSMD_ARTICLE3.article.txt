" So long, see you soon," said Frank
Tagawa in Japanese, or something to
that effect. This was when Tagawa
many years ago, set sail from his na
tive land for far-off Palo Alto, which
he had read about in the Japanese
funny papers.
Tagawa was hungry when he land
ed, so he hied himself into a restaur
ant. lie didn't fancy the "eats."
"Guess you and I can do better
than that," he said to his wife, Mary.
"Sure thing!" she replied. "You
know me, Al."
So Mr. and Mrs. Tagawa started the
Circle Cafe in Palo Alto, and then,
years later, the Stanford Union Cafe.
People liked Tagawa's handouts, and
flocked there in goodly numbers.
Which is what Tagawa wanted, be
cause he hoped some day to journey
over the Pacific to the land of the
cherry blossom and the jin-ricky.
Now that elusive "some day" has
come. Next summer Tagawa is going
to say "good-bye" to the U. S. A. for
a while, and "howdy boys," "how
boijtcha, Mill!" and "attaboy" to his
gang in the land of Nippon.
