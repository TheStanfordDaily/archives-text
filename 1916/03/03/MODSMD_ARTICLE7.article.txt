# "GREAT DIVIDE" CAST READY FOR GLARE OF LIGHTS
## PLAYERS LETTER PERFECT W.B. Owens and Nellita Choate to Appear as Heroes in Western Play 
### 
Stephen (Jlhent and Ruth Jordan are
waiting to be officially introduced to
the campus public tonight by \V. B.
Owens and Neliita Choate. And they
are characters ti'sit will be remem
bered in Stanford dramatic annals
long after the drop curtain of the
Grand Canyon lias begun to gather
dust in the Assembly TTa!I basement,
r.-isl Is Letter Perfect.
The cast has been letter perfect for
some time and the rehearsals have
been devoted to acquiring a finish to
match the foundation. Scenic effects
have been carefully worked out and
the result will be three well-staged
acts with the minimum length of
yawning space between curtains.
Setting Equal to Any Former.
The setting for the second act will
equal any outdoor effect that has ever
been seen on the Assembly Hall stage
for an appreciable time. A most ef-
fective feature of this scene is the
way in which the gathering darkness
leaves the figures of the actors in i
sharp silhouette against the luminous
vista of the great canyon. The same
effect is introduced in the first act,
when liuth leaves the room with the
lamp, and the shadowy figure of the
prowling Mexican suddenly stands out
in the frame of the open door.
Even the music tonight will be in
line with the general tone of the pro
duction, for the opening orchestral
number will be "The Great Divide
March."
