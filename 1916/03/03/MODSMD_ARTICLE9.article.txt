# VARSITY AND FRESHMEN MEET U.C.
## 
### 
Faculty ruling has made possible
two basketball games between Stan
ford and California tomorrow night
by sanctioning a game between Stan
ford and California freshmen, which
will be a preliminary to bo .nain
event.
The varsity, after playing with the
same lineup all season, should be able
to show as good or better team work
than it displayed in the game against
California last Friday night. Both
teams played the same fast, scrappy
game, and will therefore put up an ex
citing contest throughout. Only a lit
tle more ability in shooting goals and

fouls gave California the first vic
tory. Sin<?e that game Stanford men
have been spending most of their time
on tliis branch of the game.
The curtain raiser sho lld be a
vorth\ one for the varsity game,
r.otli nineteen teams have shown a lot
of basketball this season, having
pushed the varsities of their respect
ive schools in practice games.
Stanford lineups follow: Varsity,
Wheatly, center; Blodget and Worthy,
forwards, and Dolan and Caughey,
guards. Freshmen, Righter, center;
Pelouze and Estes, forwards, and Sul
livan and Bennett, guards.
