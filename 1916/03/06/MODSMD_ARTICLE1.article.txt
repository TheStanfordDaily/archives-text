# BLUE AND GOLD AGAIN DEFEATS CARDINAL QUINTET
## FRESHMAN GAME CALLED OFF Varsity Plays Well But Is Unable to Locate Basket 
### 
Superior basketball told the story,
Saturday evening, in the Berkeley
gymnasium when the Blue and Gold
five took the second and final game
of the intercollegiate scries to the
tune of 4G to 26. California's victory
was not earned without meeting stiff
opposition at the hands of the visitors.
First Half, 17 to 12.
I'.lodgct's warriors came through
like Trojans, and during the first
fifteen minutes of play offered a brand
of basketball that threatened to dis
appoint the home-town talent. A
score of 11 all was chalked up at this
point. Hard luck at finding the bas
ket kept the Cardinal score at 12 at
the sound of half-time, while the
Berkeleyites had forged ahead to the
17 mark.
The second period, although replete
with plenty of scrap, was not very
for the Cardinals. Stanford secured
14 points during the second half,
while California was able to drop the
ball through the netting for 29.
Worthy is credited on the books
with ten points, earned by field goals;
Wallace with six, Blodget with four,
and Caughey with two. Works and
Embury, for the enemy, earned twelve
tallies each by field goals, while Flood
berg shot six foul goals out of nine
chances.
Faculty sanction was not secured
in time to stage the contest between
the Stanford and California freshmen
fives. However, according to present
indications, the first year game will be
played in the near future.
