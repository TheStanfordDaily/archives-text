# ELEVEN TEAMS BEGIN Y.M.C.A. $800 CAMPAIGN
## Stanford Men Can Fire China for Christian Service Says Robertson 
### 
' You men of Stanford and other
Americans control the trigger that is !
to fire China for active Christian
work," was the way Professor C. H.'
Robertson, Y. M. C. A. lecturer, re
cently returned from the Far East, j
summarized the work that is being j
carried on by Stanford's representa- i
tive, E. H. Lockwood, former Y. M. C. j
A. secretary on the campus, who is:
now located at Canton.
According to Robertson, Lockwood, I
to whom the campus Y. M. C. A. has
pledged its support, is located in the j
heart of China's richest district. The |
people there, says Robertson, are
ready to receive the western in- 1
ftuences from America and are hearty .
in their support of Y. M. C. A. asso- i
ciations, once they are begun by j
American secretaries. Robertson pro-1
phesies that the former Stanford sec- j
retary will find as fertile a field for |
his labors as his brother, W. W. Lock
wood, who has built up the strong
and prosperous association at Shang
hai.
Sounds Keynote.
Professor Robertson sounded the i
keynote of the present eight hundred j
dollar three day campaign that the j
local association began this morning, i
Everyone connected with Stanford i
will be seen in the course of today j
or the next two days and asked to|
aid in the work that the local asso-1
ciation is carrying on. The fund of j
eight hundred dollars to be raised is (
to lie divided into two parts, and con-;
tributors can direct their funds either
to local services or to the money that j
is sent to aid E. IT. Lockwood in j
China.
Daily lunches are held in the En- j
gineering basement by the campaign
ers, at which time the eleven team
captains issue orders to their cohorts.
The present campaign is being waged
by one of the most efficient organiza
tions of its kind that has attempted I
to raise funds on the campus.
Indications are that the Stanford j
association will be able to raise its j
full quota of eight hundred dollars. I
in view of the fact that one year aeo
a sum considerably in advance of
eight hundred dollars was reached, al
though the eight hundred mark was
the aim. At the same time the Y. AT.
C. A. campaigners have been encour
aged by the report that no other or
ganization will try to raise funds by
the direct method of asking everyone
for it this semester. This includes '
the Belgian Relief committee.
