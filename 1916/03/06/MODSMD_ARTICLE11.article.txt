# "GREAT DIVIDE" SCORES SUCCESS OF YEARS THROUGHOUT
## CHARACTERIZATION FINISHED W.B. Owens and Nellita Choate Carry Production in Most Worthy Manner 
### J.L. Duff, '13 
"The (Ireat Divide" was a success—
i a success clear from the danger of
equivocation or doubt—a line out
standing success. William Vaughan
Moody's strong drama was produced
in a finished and "worthy manner.
Though the first act was a bit slow
I in its movement, tlir drama as a whole
j made a deep and effectual impression;
j more than once in the tense moments
| of the play 1 suspected the furtive
| handkerchief and the smothered
I cough.
Owens I p To Standard.
One runs the risk of becoming plat
itudinous in reviewing the work of
W. B. Owens for a Stanford paper.
Stanford audiences know him so well
and receive such fulfilling perform
ances from him that the Constant
Reader and the Old Subscriber can
just about forecast the thing the
critic is bound in all conscience to
| say. While his Sidney Carton will
stick in my mind as a greater piece
; of acting than his Stephen Ghent, I
; feel that to be due to the fact that
| Carton afforded greater opportunities,
i However, his masterful work in the
| last act of Friday night's play will
; live in grateful memory.
; Miss Choate Scores.
Both Mr. Owens and Miss Nellita
I Choate, who played opposite him, gave
! us artistic and intelligent character
i izations that were as admirable in
. their repression as they were strong
i and sure in their execution. Miss
j Choate acted with ready sympathy the
part of the New England girl who !
belongs to that New England whose
"snow is a drift not of ice but of
ashes, to guard the llamos below." To
say her Ruth Jordan was adequate
is high praise, for an adequate pre
sentation of Ruth Jordan demands
excellent acting. And Miss Choate's
acting was uniformly excellent
throughout the play.
Polly Jordan wajs wo 1/1 done by
Miss Taff, who gave her lines with a '
vivacious charm and an evident relish 1
that made each one tell. J. C. Cross
lent to the rather colorless part of
Winthrop Newbury an easy, graceful
sincerity and a pleasing stage pres
ence. J. H. Russell, with his heroic
appearance and fine voice, played
Philip Jordan with the decisive power
that part demands.
.Minor Parts Well Done.
Miss Edith Smith and H. A. Buffum |
lifted their parts from the gray of j
minor characters to the high light of
especial mention, for no review' would
be complete without a tribute to their
work. Mr. Buffum was exceptionally [
happy in his characterization, and the
"I hate to see the old Doc go" of the
man 'behind me was probably the
verdict of all. Miss Smith's paper j
knife episode was finely done.
The other minor characters suc
ceeded in doing more than merely
repeating words in reading their
lines. The amateur's temptation to
overdo the drunken man was happily
resisted by B. B. Robinson and J. A.
Quinby; their work was convincing.
J. E. Phillips, with his expressive
foot and his judicial manner, H. M.
Stanley, W. B. Curtis, L. L. Adamson
and H. P. Smith, all contributed to
the excellent support the leads re
ceived.
Clever Staging.
The staging of the play was meri
torious; the setting of the second act
received a hand all for itself —and
deserved it. The house was well
filled with an audience that was truly
appreciative, in spite of the fact that
its too acute collegiate sense of humor
spoiled the effect of the warning
whistle off-stage in the first act. The
cast, the English Club—yes, and the
orchestra that played good music for
us, may all feel well satisfied. The
reminiscent haze that glorifies "The
Road to Yesterday,""The Only Way,"
and other theatrical triumphs of the
past cannot obscure the certain merit
of "The Great Divide." Friday night's
play takes high place among the
Elect in Stanford's dramatic heaven.
