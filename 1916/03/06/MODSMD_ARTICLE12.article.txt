## 
### 
Dramatic enthusiasts made their
! first triumph in the campaign for bet
: tor local staging facilities when the
! Hoard of Trustees recently voted a
j thousand dollars to be used in the
| improvement of the Assembly Hall
: stage. In accordance with the pres
j out. plan a handsome proscenium will
be erected across the front of the
stai?e, taking the place of the old cur
tain and adding six feet to the depth
of the floor. It will hang in from of
the former curtain, thus making it
j possible to utilize the forward por
j t ion of the stage.

For some time Superintendent Hew
! ston lias been endeavoring to work
out a solution for the problem of the
Assembly Hall stage, and succeeded
last Friday in obtaining the consent
lof the Hoard of Trustees to proceed
with the work immediately. Six hun
dred dollars will be spent for a new
I gray plush curtain and the remaining
j four hundred will go toward tho erect
| ing of square classic columns and
■ overhead hangings. The old green
l curtain is to be retained, however,
jand used for assemblies and lectures.
One of the most important effects
of the change will be the improved
[lighting facilities. In previous pro-
I ductions it lias been impossible to
use the overhead arch lights because
of their glaring effect. The new
proscenium will extend In front of
j these lights and reflect them upon the
stage, at the same time shielding
them from the audience. Another ad
vantage is the fact that the actors
will be brought nearer the audience
and thus permit more of the quiet
emotional type of work.
The improvements will be rushed
during the next few weeks and every
effort will be made to have the stage
in readiness for the Junior Opera.
The increased tloor space will be
keenly appreciated in this production
since it will permit more room for
the dancing of the chorus.
