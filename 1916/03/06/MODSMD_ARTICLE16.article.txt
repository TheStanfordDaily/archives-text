# Track Dance Program
## 
### 
That cats will be served at the
track dance any time after the fifth
number, is the latest announcement of
the committee. Relieving that good
eats and a smooth floor are the two
chief requisites of a successful eve
ning, a liberal supply of wax is being
applied, which is to be left 011 the
floor until after the Junior Prom.
An unusual program of music has
been planned. The eighteen number
dance card will be started by the
Hand, which will play the first five
and the first extra. Dances from five
to ten and the second extra will be
by the Lynn-Coleman club, and the
last six by the Pedley-Kegley or
chestra.
