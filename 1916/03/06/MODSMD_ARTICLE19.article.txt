To the Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: The behavior of the aud
ience which witnessed the production
of "The Great Divide" last Friday
night seeuis to me to have been start
ling enough to call for comment. The
behavior of which 1 speak goes back
to an attitude of mind —not a new one
at Stanford by any means, but one
which has in the past concealed its
silly and impossible nature with com
parative success. For on many pre
vious occasions the snickering and
giggling which marred various phases
of last Friday evening's performance
have had a surface excuse. There
have been dramatic situations which
did not deserve laughter, but which
made laughter decently possible.
"The Great Divide," however, furn
ished few or none such. In my opin
ion and in that of others with whom
1 have talked, the presentation com
pared excellently with the profes
sional ones which some of us saw
nine years ago. And yet the audience
was apparently a-strain for a chance
to titter: it tittered during the nat
ural dramatic pause of the first act:
it tittered because the heroine took
down her hair in its presence; it
tittered because the hero poured some
whiskey on the floor: it tittered be
cause he drove a nail into a door
frame that shook a little. Tn all this
no harm was intended. And as a
matter of fact the play succeeded in
spite of the insulting lack of sympathy
with which it was received. The piti
ful thing is that the audience, the
Stanford audience, did not succeed.
It failed most dismally. Tt gave evi
dence, en masse, of a total lack of
imagination, it showed that it was no
more able to approach a dramatic
offering with intelligent receptiveness
than an average boy of ten is able to
appreciate Shaw or William .Tames or
Browning. Tt showed that it was not
willing or able to give a good drama
a chance —that it could not contrib
ute its share to the full measure that
real art and receptive auditors to
gether make. It was given something
big, and it merely felt foolish.
Of course this does not apply to all
the audience at any time or to the
most guilty of the audience all the
time. But it does apply. Tsn't there
after all a partial truth in what a
certain Dr. Fitch said: "Tsn't the
man who refuses to try to under
stand, who is willing to laugh before
he knows he ought to, or when he
knows deep down that he ought not
to, a kind of a snob? Doesn't he
blunder in regard to values just as
the man blunders who is proud of the
fact that he doesn't have to wait on
the table? Tt seems to me he does.
Both blunderers are short-sighted:
both might re-consider their attitude
toward life to good advantage."

Both blunderers are short-sighted:
both might re-consider their attitude

To the Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: The behavior of the aud
ience which witnessed the production
of "The Great Divide" last Friday
night seeuis to me to have been start
ling enough to call for comment. The
behavior of which 1 speak goes back
to an attitude of mind —not a new one
at Stanford by any means, but one
which has in the past concealed its
silly and impossible nature with com
parative success. For on many pre
vious occasions the snickering and
giggling which marred various phases
of last Friday evening's performance
have had a surface excuse. There
have been dramatic situations which
did not deserve laughter, but which
made laughter decently possible.
"The Great Divide," however, furn
ished few or none such. In my opin
ion and in that of others with whom
1 have talked, the presentation com
pared excellently with the profes
sional ones which some of us saw
nine years ago. And yet the audience
was apparently a-strain for a chance
to titter: it tittered during the nat
ural dramatic pause of the first act:
it tittered because the heroine took
down her hair in its presence; it
tittered because the hero poured some
whiskey on the floor: it tittered be
cause he drove a nail into a door
frame that shook a little. Tn all this
no harm was intended. And as a
matter of fact the play succeeded in
spite of the insulting lack of sympathy
with which it was received. The piti
ful thing is that the audience, the
Stanford audience, did not succeed.
It failed most dismally. Tt gave evi
dence, en masse, of a total lack of
imagination, it showed that it was no
more able to approach a dramatic
offering with intelligent receptiveness
than an average boy of ten is able to
appreciate Shaw or William .Tames or
Browning. Tt showed that it was not
willing or able to give a good drama
a chance —that it could not contrib
ute its share to the full measure that
real art and receptive auditors to
gether make. It was given something
big, and it merely felt foolish.
Of course this does not apply to all
the audience at any time or to the
most guilty of the audience all the
time. But it does apply. Tsn't there
after all a partial truth in what a
certain Dr. Fitch said: "Tsn't the
man who refuses to try to under
stand, who is willing to laugh before
he knows he ought to, or when he
knows deep down that he ought not
to, a kind of a snob? Doesn't he
blunder in regard to values just as
the man blunders who is proud of the
fact that he doesn't have to wait on
the table? Tt seems to me he does.
Both blunderers are short-sighted:
both might re-consider their attitude
toward life to good advantage."
