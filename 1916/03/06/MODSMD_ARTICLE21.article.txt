which Stanford swimmers will take
part this semester will that for the
Pacific Coast championship, to be held
at Sutro Baths in San Francisco, next
Friday evening. Six entrants will

or more of other teams and individual

relay team. H. W. Buckland, also a star
in the local pool, enters unattached,
not being at present eligilde for the
Stanford team. Buckland is a swim
mer of high ability and shows prom
ise of taking at least one first place
in the meet. In a recent trial he suc
ceeded in lowering the Pacific Coast
record for the 150-yard backstroke to
the time of 1:58.
Many Entries.
A hundred or more entries have
been made for Friday's meet, includ

Hawaiian Islands, Washington, Ore
gon, and Southern California, as well
as numerous swimming clubs about
the bay.
Gold, silver, and bronze medals will

in each event, and a handsome cup
goes to the winning relay team.
Inclement weather discouraged even
the aquatic performances last Satur
day, thereby necessitating the post
ponement of the varsity-freshman
swimming meet. At the appointed
time some of the more enthusiastic
appeared but were so few in number
that Coach "Ernie" Hrandsten had to
postpone the meet until some time
this week.
Handicap Meets This Week.
Two tryouts in the form of handi
caps are slated for this week. One
is due tomorrow afternoon and the
other follows on Wednesday. Coach
Brandsten says that it is importan'
that the entire squad be on hand for
both of these tryouts, as they will
determine the rating in future meets.
