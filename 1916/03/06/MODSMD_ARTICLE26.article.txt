# City Soccerites Call Off Game With Varsity
## 
### 
No game was played by the varsity
soccerites Saturday, due to the failure
on the part of the Olympic-Barbarian
eleven to get a team together. A
telegram was received late Friday
afternoon by J. L. Reynolds, '14,
stating that it would be impossible
for the city leaguers to get out, and
requesting that the game be post
poned to a future date. Due to the
rain, however, the game could not
have been played on the Ocean Shore
grounds, and it would have been
necessary to call it off for that reason,
anyway.
A possible rival of Stanford's title
as champion of the Exposition series
was discovered recently when the of
ficials of the University and Club
Soccer League ordered the contested
game between the Olympics and Cali
fornia replayed. They held that this
game should not bo counted as part
of the series due to the fact that it
was not played the full time and
| that the whistle was handled by no
! official referee.
Stanford and the Olympic Club will
| lie tied for first place in the event
j that the latter wins from California.
| If the Blut> tand Gold aggregation
wins, the title will remain with Stan
ford by virtue of having already
beaten the California eleven.
With the second game with Cali
fornia but five days off, the first team
men will undergo several strenuous
practice matches during the early
part of this week. The All-Grays
furnished excellent competition and
should help Captain Boyle and Coach
Maloney to put the final edge on the
varsity eleven preparatory for Satur
day's intercollegiate game.
