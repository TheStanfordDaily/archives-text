# I.C.A.A.A.A. IN LEAGUE MEETING ADMITS STANFORD
## 
### 
Stanford was admitted to member
ship in the Intercollegiate Association
of Amateur Athletes of America at a
meeting of the executive officers of
the organization held Saturday after
noon in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in
New York.
The admission of the Cardinals to
membership practically insures the
far-eastern trip of the home track
athletes this coming May, following
the dual meet with Michigan at Ann
Arbor. The contest at which the
Stanford athletes will meet the best
from all parts of the country will be
held at Cambridge this year on May
26 and 27.
R. L. Murray, '13, represented Stan
ford at the meeting, at which the ap
plication of the University of Pitts
burg was laid on the table for one
year. This was Stanford's first ap
plication for membership, and the fact
that it was granted immediately is
evidence of the standing of the Card
inal in the east.
The so-called "I. C. 4-A" annual
track contest is the classic of Amer
ica, just as the Olympic meets are
the big events of the world, and Stan
ford's admission to membership means
that local athletes will compete in the
contests at least every other year,
according to requirements of member
ship.
At present the other members of
the"I. C. 4-A" are Amherst, Tlowdoin,
Brown, California, Colby, College of
the City of New York, Columbia, Cor
nell, Dartmouth, Fordham, Franklin,
and Marshall, Georgetown, Harvard,
Haverford, Johns Hopkins, LaFayette,
Maine, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Michigan, New York
University, Penn State, Pennsylvania,
Princeton, Rutgers, Swarthmore, Will
iams, Syracuse, Yale.
