# OFFERS STANFORD NEW BOATHOUSE AT SAN CARLOS BEACH
## PLAN STILL WATER RESORT Excellent Race Course, Sightly Beach and Equal Tides Add to Value 
### 
That the Stanford crew may fall
heir to a perfectly good boat house
at San Carlos harbor is the opinion
of Graduate Manager Behrens, who
spent most of Sunday with a party
on an inspection tour of the proposed
new resort site just north of Red
wood.
The plans to make San Carlos a
beach pleasure resort are being
formed and backed up by several San
Francisco capitalists of high stand
ing, and the offer to erect a boat
house for the benefit of the Cardinal
oarsmen if they will transfer their
training quarters is of unusual in
terest.
l'lans To He I'uslied.
That the plans to make San Carlos
a resort equal to any on the coasl
are not merely dreams is evidenced
by the fact that the Ohio building
at the Exposition has been purchased
and will be removed to San Carlo?
Bay. The purchasers are given but
a limited amount of time to get the
building from the grounds, which be
speaka immediate activity on their
part.
A number of San Francisco boat
clubs have been keenly interested in
the project at San Carlos, because
the need of a still water boating
site has long been felt by pleasure
navigators of the Bay district. Thf
plans of the promoters of the Sac
Carlos site include erection of a
Casino, and other pleasure buildings
that will make the landing a head
quarters for auto parties as well as
boating parties.
That the Stanford rowers would be
more than glad to go to San Carlos
to practice, in case the project goes
through as planned, is vouched for
by Behrens, who believes that San
Carlos offers a much better head
quarters than Redwood estuary.
Tides at Redwood prevent rowing
every other week, while at San Carlos
they would be practically the same
the year around.
Excellent Race Course.
In addition to better tides, another
attraction is offered in the form of a
sightly stretch of beach on which a
grandstand could be erected at which
fans at races could view the entire
contest from start to finish. Lack
of a suitable place to stage races
has been a discouraging element in
the western oarsman's game.
It is probable that the Stanford
crews will change the rowing head
quarters as soon as improvements
can be made, if present plans go
through, as Redwood estuary is rap
idly lilling up, and it is but a course
of time until the Cardinal will have
to seek new waters for their training
shells.

at the Exposition has been purchased
and will be removed to San Carlo?
Bay. The purchasers are given but
a limited amount of time to get the
building from the grounds, which be
speaka immediate activity on their
part.
A number of San Francisco boat
clubs have been keenly interested in
the project at San Carlos, because
the need of a still water boating
site has long been felt by pleasure
navigators of the Bay district. Thf
plans of the promoters of the Sac
Carlos site include erection of a
Casino, and other pleasure buildings
that will make the landing a head
quarters for auto parties as well as
boating parties.
That the Stanford rowers would be
more than glad to go to San Carlos
to practice, in case the project goes
through as planned, is vouched for
by Behrens, who believes that San
Carlos offers a much better head
quarters than Redwood estuary.
Tides at Redwood prevent rowing
every other week, while at San Carlos
they would be practically the same
the year around.
Excellent Race Course.
In addition to better tides, another
attraction is offered in the form of a
sightly stretch of beach on which a
grandstand could be erected at which
fans at races could view the entire
contest from start to finish. Lack
of a suitable place to stage races
has been a discouraging element in
the western oarsman's game.
It is probable that the Stanford
crews will change the rowing head
quarters as soon as improvements
can be made, if present plans go
through, as Redwood estuary is rap
idly lilling up, and it is but a course
of time until the Cardinal will have
to seek new waters for their training
shells.
