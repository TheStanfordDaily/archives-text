# Y.M.C.A. STARTS $800 CAMPAIGN
## Rousing Taiks Feature First Meeting of Workers 
### 
"Pep" meeting number one after the
opening of the three day whirlwind
campaign for eight hundred dollars
for Y. M. C. A. work both at Stanford
and in China, was held this noon, in
the Engineering basement. Reports
of the correct standings of the teams
ere not ready today because a num
ber of campaigners had not reported
to team captains as yet.
However, workers stated that
though but about one-sixth of the
men of the University had been seen,
they were well received, and indica
tions are that the eight hundred dol
lar mark will be reached and probably
passed by tomorrow evening.
Rousing talks were given at today's
luncheon by Harry O. Hill, state sec
retary, lien Cherrington of California,
Professor R. L. Green of the Mathe
matics department, Secretary Watson,
and President Roy Needham, who
ended up the spicy meeting with the

Stanford motto, "Gugetem," meaning
thereby eight hundred dollars.
That Christian work on the campus
is every bit as necessary as athletics
or any other activity, and vastly more
important in after life, was the stand
of California's Y. M. C. A. secretary,
Ben Cherrington, basketball coach and
general athlete, whose "put the prop
osition through" attitude was warmly
grasped by every campaigner.
A letter from Stanford's representa
tive in China, E. H. Lockwood, former
campus secretary, for whom the funds
are being raised partly, was received
here yesterday, "112 have a class of
boys from the upper normal school
studying the life of Christ in English,"
he writes. "This is the first Bible
study class ever held made up of gov
ernment students of Canton. These
boys are likeable fellows, much dif
ferent, and yet much like the students
in the colleges of America."
