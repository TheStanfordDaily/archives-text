be served the campus diamond en

the Stanford varsity lines up against

cover second, Sehimpff will handle
third, and short will be taken care of
by Jones. Tobin, Lynch, and Rem

Stanford will send the same team
on the diamond that has upheld the

possibly one exception. Hoever,
VVickersham, Howe, or Mattei will
shove theip, over, Dent will be on the
receiving end, while the infield will
be composed of Hayes, Stafford, Stev
