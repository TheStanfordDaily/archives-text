the Stanford varsity lines up against
the speedy Remmers All Stars from
Oakland, on the local lot at 4:15.
Jack McCarthy, who has again been
secured by Graduate Manager Heh
reii√ü to hold the indicator, will start
the game promptly at the scheduled
time, and it is hoped that the full
nine innings will be run through. If
without season tickets, spectators
will be forced to relieve themselves
of twenty-five cents to gain adinls
sion.
Visitors Have Strong Temii.
The opposing nine is one of the
fastest aggregations that will appeal
on the local diamond. Remmer hap
gathered together a bunch of bait

tossers that will give a hard game
to any team. His lineup is as fol
lows: Joe Oescheger of the Phila
delphia Nationals, Tyler Christian,
,ex-manager of the Oaks, and Wiz
Meikle of Coast League fame in the
box; Kraft, who has appeared here
with the Ambrose Tailors, will catch:
Zamlock will play first, Menges will
cover second, Sehimpff will handle
third, and short will be taken care of
by Jones. Tobin, Lynch, and Rem
mer will fill the outfield berths.
Stanford will send the same team
on the diamond that has upheld the
Cardinal in the last few games, with
possibly one exception. Hoever,
VVickersham, Howe, or Mattei will
shove theip, over, Dent will be on the
receiving end, while the infield will
be composed of Hayes, Stafford, Stev
ens, and Braden. In the outfield, San
born, Lander, Noonan, and possibly
Bihlman, will chase the lons ones.
