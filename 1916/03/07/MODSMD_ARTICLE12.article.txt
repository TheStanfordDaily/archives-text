# SANCTION FRESHMAN CONTESTS
## President Wilbur Approves Action of Advisory Board SETTLE COACHING PROBLEM Take Definite Stand on Coaches and Lowerclass Games For First Time Since 1911 
### 
Stanford freshmen can again meet
California freshmen in intercollegiate
athletic contests, as the result of
sanction given yesterday by President
Wilbur, following a recommendation
from the Athletic Advisory Hoard
that the first year men be allowed
to participate in games with other
colleges.
Coaching Problem Settled.
The coaching problem has also been
definitely settled by the Athletic Ad
visory Hoard, which has granted the
Executive Committee power to choose
coaches, subject to the approval of
the board and President Wilbur. The
coaching problem has been unsettled
since 1911, when the Academic Coun
cil. acting on a letter from Dr. Jor
dan, then President of Stanford, abol
ished both freshman intercollegiates
and professional coaches.
However, the latter provision was
never enforced strictly because no
substitute was provided for profes
sional coaches, and the system of em
ploying graduate coaches has been
used since that time,
freshman athletics in 1911 were that
"freshmen ought to have a lucid in
terval between the excitement of high
school and the excitement of college,
in which they can be brought into
the proper relation with University af
t fairs." The suggestion to the Aca
demic Council at that time from Dr.
Jordan was primarily to exclude
freshmen from varsity teams, as has
been done in the last year, but in
1911 this plan was not acceptable to
California. The Academic Council
compromised by ending first year
intercollegiates, and limiting to a cer
j tain extent the practice of hiring pro
fessional coaches.
â–  New Policy Direct Contrast.
The 1911 policy of the Academic
Council is in direct contrast to the
policy of President Wilbur, who holds
that the freshman is entitled to the
same privileges in college as other
students. It is also in opposition to
the expressed policy of the Athletic
Advisory Hoard, and the Faculty Ath
letic Committee, both of which favor
the greatest participation of men in
athletics possible, rather than the
training of a special few.
It was this incongruity in the sit
uation that led the Athletic Advisory
Hoard to recommend at a meeting
last week that freshman games be
allowed again. The matter was sanc
tioned by the Faculty Athletic Com
mittee, which sent the resolution to
President Wilbur for final sanction.
This was given yesterday, when Grad
uate Manager Hehrens was informed
that he could go ahead with his sched
ule and arrange freshman games with
any college in baseball, basketball,
soccer and sports similar to crew.
Itenioves Dissatisfaction.
The change in policy regarding
freshman intercollegiates practically
ends a situation which has been un
satisfactory to students and some
members of the faculty for a number
of years. Howevc.', the committees
in charge of athletic affairs have not
had sufficient powers in their hands
to directly change the . pplicv laid
down in 1911, and it has reriiained for
the newly created AHiletic Advisory
Hoard. whMi consists of faculty, stu
dents, and alumni representatives, to
take the initiative in the matter.
