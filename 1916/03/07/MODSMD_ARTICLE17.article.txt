Editor The Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: A good deal of sense and
nonsense has been given vent to, pro
and con, on the basketball question
in private, while very little, for many
reasons (take them as you may), has
been uttered in public. It is to be
hoped that these anti sentiments will
not overbalance the judgments of the
voters who have not given some
thought to the question, and more to
be hoped that votes will not be reg
istered merely on the strength of the
fact that so-and-so, a personal friend
of the voter, or a prominent man
around college, is opposed to basket
ball as a major sport, because—(the
usual line of arguments).
It seems to the writer that basket
ball should stay a major sport.
Stanford Not Alone.
Stanford cannot go her own way
alone. She has to conform, in inter
collegiate athletic relations, to the
common sentiment of those universi
ties with whom she is to compete.
She wants to get as many men out
for sports as possible, because it is
good for the men individually and be
cause Stanford is an American Uni
versity and WANTS TO WIN. Basket
ball on the Pacific coast is in the
ascendant (see an ynewspaper) and
has been made a block letter sport in
most of the significant universities of
the coast. Ditto throughout the Mid
dle West. These are the universities
we have the most intimate relations
with, the ones whom we hope to de
feat as regularly as possible. If the
sport cannot be so recognized, as it
is elsewhere, so that men who are
willing to put their best energy and
time to it are decently rewarded, then
it will fall. In short, we will lose.
Fewer men will turn out for the sport,
another loss. And basketball, as a
losing minor sport, supported by
teams bound to be inferior to those of
rival universities, might as well go
for good.
Game Worthy of Mock S.
It is worth while doing a thing
well, if it is worth doing at all. Cali
fornia and Washington have done so.
No one can say that the team that
could defeat the quintets of those two
universities would not be worthy of
the highest athletic honor available,
the block S. That Stanford fell be
fore them, that the exhibition put up
by uncoached men, unsupported prop
erly by the student body of the Uni
versity, was not good except in fight
displayed, is no argument against
basketball and certainly no argument
against a game that requires the
energy, discipline, and endurance that
basketball does.
Intermediate Sport.
Basketball is over, for the most
part, before strict training in other
sports begins, so that it cannot inter
fere seriously with the other forms of
athletics. Incidentally, it can afford
an outlet for the energies of a large
number of huskies who are not track,
baseball, or crew men. That is the
main purpose of athletics. Any move
that will aid such a purpose should
be accelerated, providing draw-backs
are not shown of a more significant
character than those exhibited in the
arguments of the antis.
Stanford lost this year. She wants
to win the next season's contests. If
cutting basketball down to a minor
sport will help Stanford win, if it
will stimulate interest in an interest
ing sport, if it will draw out a larger
number of aspirants, if it will promote
amicable intercollegiate relations and
afford a better basis for common un
derstanding between the Coast univer
sities, then let us keep it forever a
minor sport. But, if the voter cannot
honestly come to such a conclusion,
there is only one way left to vote,
and that is "Yes." Anyhow, let it be
a thought-out conviction one way or
the other.

Game Worthy of Mock S.
It is worth while doing a thing
well, if it is worth doing at all. Cali
fornia and Washington have done so.
No one can say that the team that
could defeat the quintets of those two
universities would not be worthy of
the highest athletic honor available,
the block S. That Stanford fell be
fore them, that the exhibition put up
by uncoached men, unsupported prop
erly by the student body of the Uni
versity, was not good except in fight
displayed, is no argument against
basketball and certainly no argument
against a game that requires the
energy, discipline, and endurance that
basketball does.
Intermediate Sport.
Basketball is over, for the most
part, before strict training in other
sports begins, so that it cannot inter
fere seriously with the other forms of
athletics. Incidentally, it can afford
an outlet for the energies of a large
number of huskies who are not track,
baseball, or crew men. That is the
main purpose of athletics. Any move
that will aid such a purpose should
be accelerated, providing draw-backs
are not shown of a more significant
character than those exhibited in the
arguments of the antis.
Stanford lost this year. She wants
to win the next season's contests. If
cutting basketball down to a minor
sport will help Stanford win, if it
will stimulate interest in an interest
ing sport, if it will draw out a larger
number of aspirants, if it will promote
amicable intercollegiate relations and
afford a better basis for common un
derstanding between the Coast univer
sities, then let us keep it forever a
minor sport. But, if the voter cannot
honestly come to such a conclusion,
there is only one way left to vote,
and that is "Yes." Anyhow, let it be
a thought-out conviction one way or
the other.

Editor The Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: A good deal of sense and
nonsense has been given vent to, pro
and con, on the basketball question
in private, while very little, for many
reasons (take them as you may), has
been uttered in public. It is to be
hoped that these anti sentiments will
not overbalance the judgments of the
voters who have not given some
thought to the question, and more to
be hoped that votes will not be reg
istered merely on the strength of the
fact that so-and-so, a personal friend
of the voter, or a prominent man
around college, is opposed to basket
ball as a major sport, because—(the
usual line of arguments).
It seems to the writer that basket
ball should stay a major sport.
Stanford Not Alone.
Stanford cannot go her own way
alone. She has to conform, in inter
collegiate athletic relations, to the
common sentiment of those universi
ties with whom she is to compete.
She wants to get as many men out
for sports as possible, because it is
good for the men individually and be
cause Stanford is an American Uni
versity and WANTS TO WIN. Basket
ball on the Pacific coast is in the
ascendant (see an ynewspaper) and
has been made a block letter sport in
most of the significant universities of
the coast. Ditto throughout the Mid
dle West. These are the universities
we have the most intimate relations
with, the ones whom we hope to de
feat as regularly as possible. If the
sport cannot be so recognized, as it
is elsewhere, so that men who are
willing to put their best energy and
time to it are decently rewarded, then
it will fall. In short, we will lose.
Fewer men will turn out for the sport,
another loss. And basketball, as a
losing minor sport, supported by
teams bound to be inferior to those of
rival universities, might as well go
for good.
