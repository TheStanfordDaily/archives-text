# Pricipals Rehearse With Opera Chorus
## 
### 
Chorus work in the Junior Opera,
"In Dutch," is so advanced at this
early date that Coach Dick Morgan
has begun to rehearse the principals
with the choruses. Ordinarily this
is not done until the last week before
the production.
The crowded appearance of the
stage which has always accompanied
the operas of the past is to be done
away with this year owing to the
proscenium which is now being erected
on the Assembly Hall stage. This
will enlarge the stage at least six feet.
There is to be new scenery for both
acts. The first is to be the world
renowned tulip conservatory of Mr.
Van Zant, father of Peggy, the lead
ing lady. The second will be the ter
race garden of the same mansion on
the Hudson. All of the scenery is
being made especially for"In Dutch,"
by the Alcazar Studio.
There are ten musical numbers
alone in the first act. The entrance
number of Peggy is of superior oper
atic worth and has been heard
by a professional producer of New
York, who expressed himself well
pleased with the local work, and
stated that he may use the same fea
ture in Gotham.
