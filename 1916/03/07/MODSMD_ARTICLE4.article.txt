# Prom Tickets Sell Tomorrow in Union
## 1917 Committee Tabooes Taxis and Flowers; and Plans Novelty Programs and Decorations 
### 
Junior Prom tickets will be on sale
tomorrow at Wideman's, in the Union.
Aside from the five dollar tax for a
ticket the only other Prom expense
will be carfare to the gym, as taxis
and flowers are absolutely tabooed
this year.
The contract for a two-course sup
per, to be served at half-time, has
been given to a caterer who promises
the best of patties and French pastry.
Something absolutely new to the cam
pus in the way of programs has been
planned and has been submitted to
several companies for bids.
The gymnasium is to be decorated
with a dome effect as to ceiling and
the general scheme is more elaborate
than any tried in the history of the
gym to date. At every point the Jun
iors are trying to surpass all Proms
within the memory pf anyone in col
lege.
