# BASKETBALL QUESTION UP FOR QUAD VOTE TOMORROW
## NO OPPOSITION AT ASSEMBLY Arguments For Major Standing of Sport Made by Wilson, Braden and Fletcher 
### 
Whether basketball will remain as
it is now, a major sport, or whether
it is to be reduced to a minor activity,
will be decided by a vote on the Quad
tomorrow. In spite of the fact that
practically no arguments were ad
vanced against basketball at the mass
meeting in the Union this afternoon,
it was felt by the members of tho
Executive Committee that a decision
by the students will be best for all
concerned.
Several men who had no adverse
criticism to offer to the game itself
emphasized the fact that a vote should
be taken to find out whether or not
the students will get back of the sport
and support it as a major activity
should be supported.
Executive Committee's Reasons.
Student Body President Wilson ex
plained why the Executive Committee
raised basketball to a major sport,
before the meeting was thrown open
to general discussion. "It has as
sumed major sport status on the Pa
cific coast," he said, "and if we ex
pect to compete favorably with other
universities, we must follow their ex
ample. The Executive Committee has
complete power to regulate the stand
ing of any activity, but it feels that in
this case the student body should be
given an opportunity to vote on the
question."
Other Arguments For.
It was argued in favor of. keeping
basketball a major, that it fills in be
tween the seasons of the outdoor ac
tivities. When the weather is such
that baseball and track can not be
successfully conducted, it affords a
good outlet for athletic enthusiasm.
Further it was suggested that it is a
poor time to quit when one is getting
beat, and to reduce basketball fol
lowing an unfortunate season would
be a bad move,
lias llad Disadvantages.
"Basketball has had all the dis
advantages and none of the advant
ages of a major sport this season,"
said J. R. Braden, '16. "It has had
no coach, and has not been supported
by the student body as a major sport
should." Regarding a coach, Wilson
stated that one would be secured by
the Executive Committee next year.
Tennis As Example.
It was brought out by W. D.
Fletcher, 'i 1, that tennis, which is a
major at California and a minor here,
has suffered by the comparison.
"During the time that winning tennis
players were awarded block "S's" at
Stanford," he said, "we competed very
favorably with California, but since
they were taken away, there has been
only one successful season against
the Blue and Gold."
