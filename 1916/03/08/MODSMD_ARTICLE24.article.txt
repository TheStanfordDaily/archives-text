# ELEVEN-INNING GAME GOES TO CARDINALS
## Stanford Defeats Agnews in Best Contest of Season on Hospital Lot 
### 
Stanford won the best baseball
game of the present season, yester
day afternoon, when they took into
camp the fast Agnews team in a hard
fought eleven-inning contest on the
hospital diamond. The final count
loft the Cardinals on the long end of
a 4 to 3 score. The day was perfect
for baseball and the two teams played
in major league style before a large
crowd.
Draper, well known to the campus
fans as the pitcher who, while twirl
ing for the sophomores, let the jun
iors down with but three hits, was on
the mound for the varsity. His pitch
ing was the main feature of the
closely contested game, stricking out
eleven opposing batsmen, shoving a
no-hit no-run fjame for five innings,
and allowing but four hits during his
entire stay in the box. He also
cracked out a single and registered
one of the Stanford tallies.
Agnews did not register a score
until the sixth, and then they put over
a run in that frame, one in the sev
enth, and one in the eighth. With
the score tied and Draper on first in
the ninth, Wickersham was putin to
run for the Cardinal pitcher, taking
his place on the mound in the last
half of that inning. The victory is
therefore credited to the southpaw
as the winning tally came over in the
eleventh.
