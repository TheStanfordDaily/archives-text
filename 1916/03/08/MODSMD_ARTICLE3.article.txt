Here is what Founders' Day is:

in honor of Leland Stanford and
Jane Lathrop Stanford.
It is the biggest day of the Stan

1916 Founders' Day has a better
program than ever before.
Stanford leaders hope to have
the greatest men of the country at
Stanford on Founders' Days to
speak to students.
Founders' Day is for alumni,
faculty, and students —but most of
all, students.
Seniors are expected to lead
Founders' Day activities.

Here is tomorrow's Founders'

6:30 p.m.—Founders' Day din

8:00 i).m. —Alumni and student

Thanks to the work of Founders' Day committees, tomorrow will be a
fiill (lay, from 10:30 in the morning, when the Stanford Band opens the
Founders' Day exercises in the Assembly Hall, until late in the evening, when
the last student or the last grad leaves the Union for home.
Variety has been the keynote of the 191G Founders' Uay plans. That
the day might not be too solemn and too serious, Stanford will enjoy a
baseball game in the afternoon with Santa Clara, following a classical con
cert by the Band on the Inner Quad, at 2 o'clock. Reverence for Stan-

ford's founders will be shown by the
appropriate morning exercises, at
which President Benjamin Ide
Wheeler of California will be the
speaker. Chancellor Jordan will pre
side.
Seniors will perform the symbolic
honors for the student body by
placing flowers at the Mausoleum,
following the exercises in the Assem
bly Hall.
In the afternoon the band concert
and baseball game will add a more
congenial vein. Founders' Day din
ner has assumed a position of im
portance on the program, due largely
to the committee in charge, of which
Miss Edith Mirrielees is chairman.
Stunts, music by Blumenthal's or
chestra, speeches by Chancellor Jor
dan, President Wilbur, Vice-President
Stillman. and Charles R. Lewers, '9(i,
all will go to aid in raising the spirit
of the occasion to the proper pitch.
Following the dinner, all will adjourn
to the Union for a general get
together, dancing being the chief at

traction on the evening program.
Last, but not least —Founders' Day
is for all, and the committees have
had this in mind when arranging pro
grams for the day.
