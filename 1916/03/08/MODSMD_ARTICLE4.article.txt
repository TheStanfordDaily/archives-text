# Y.M.C.A. Campaign Lengthened One Day
## Final Reports Must be In Friday Noonâ€”Last Luncheon Today 
### 
One day will be added to the length
of the Y. M. C. A. campaign for eight
hundred dollars, owing to the Found
ers' I)ay holiday tomorrow. No meet
ing will be held Thursday noon. The
last reports of the campaign must be
in Friday.
Though no complete reports of the
money already pledged to the Y. M.
C. A. can be made out as yet, owing
largely to the fact that fraternity
workers have not been seen by cap
tains, the sum today has reached and
passed the three hundred and fifty
dollar mark.
Live speeches and good spirit
marked today's luncheon in the En- !
gineering basement. Lloyd E. Harter, I
'02, first student secretary of the cam
pus Y. M. C. A., was the principal
speaker. Harter sounded the spirit,
of the early days when the Y. M. C. A.
was first founded at Stanford, and
stated emphatically the value of train
ing received in association activities.
Once tiie campaign is ended, the
funds will be divided according to the
wishes of contributors as expressed
on the cards, into two sums, one for
local work, and another to go to E. H.
Lockwood, former Stanford secretary,
who is now in China.
