# U.S. AID FOR DRILL AT STANFORD
## Bills Aim to Help University Military Training 
### 
Agitation for military drill at Stan
ford places this University in line
with many other institutions of higher
education in what has come to be a
nation-wide movement. Not only
have other schools taken up this plan
to help solve the preparedness prob
lem, but it is being seriously consid
ered by tbe United States government.
In a pamphlet on proposed legisla
tion for increasing the scope of mili
tary training in civil educational in
stitutions, with special reference to
turning out men callable of acting as

ceived by President Wilbur, a good
review of these suggested laws is pre
sented.
Two Bills Presented.
Identical bills have been received
by the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives, entitled, "A Bill to Estab

Corps." They provide that the Fed
eral government shall avail itself to a
greater extent of the possibilities of
fered in land-grant colleges and other
civil educational institutions, for the
training of men competent to take up
tbe duties of officers in time of war.

will be required, and the men under
going this training will be supplied
by the government with their uni
forms, and will have their expenses
paid to and from and at the summer
training camps to be established as a
part of tbe work. Advanced training

years, and those who enter this branch
will receive in addition, a monthly
payment equivalent to the cost of the
army ration.

The bill further provides that the
president be authorized to detail such

officers and enlisted men as may be
found necessary in connection with
