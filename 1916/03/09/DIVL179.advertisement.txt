STATEMENT
As a business man you must
realize that this advertisement
wc be a failure if it only
succeeded in selling ONE box
of Muracts to each smoker
who tried them.
The advertising of Murads is based
on our experience that once you smoke
Murads you will continue to smoke
This advertising is intended merely
to introduce Murads to those not yet
acquainted with them.
Murads will do the rest.
That is why Murad is today the
greatest selling high-grade cigarette in
America.
