# FAST DOUBLEHEADER FOR CARDINAL NINES
## Olympic Club and Davis Farm Teams Play Varsity and Freshmen Saturday 
### 
Varsity and freshmen baseball
teams will line up Saturday afternoon
on the Stanford diamond in the first
double-header of the present season.
Both Karnes will be played in the
afternoon, the freshmen taking on the
fast nine from Davis Farm, while the
varsity will cross willows with the
Olympic Club aggregation. The pre
liminary contest will be started
promptly at 1:30, the main event
being scheduled for 3:15. It is ex
pected that the full nine innings will
be played in both games.
Season Tickets Valid.
Graduate Manager Behrens has
made arrangements with the visiting
teams so that local fans will be able
to use season tickets for admission.
Those without the useful pasteboards
will, however, be given bleacher seats
for both contests for the usual tweu
ty-five cents admission price. Jack
McCarthy, who has seen service in the
American League as umpire, and who
now officiates in the Pacific Coast
League, has again been secured to
call the close ones.
Olympics Return.
Saturday's game will be the first
appearance ot the speedy Olympic
Club team since their tour of the
Hawaiian Islands. The long end of
the score in a majority of the con
tests across the water fell to the
"Winged O" nine, and their reputa
tion insures excellent competition for
the Cardinal tossers. The athletic
manager of the San Francisco organ
ization sent the following names as
the players scheduled for an appear
ance Saturday: Martin, p; Burke
and Riordan, c; McGrath, lb; Ken
nedy, 2b; Benn, 3b; Freine, ss; Bar
ker, If; Andrade, cf, and Tramutola,
rf.
Captain Dent is unable at this time
to definitely announce the complete
Stanford lineup, but the squad will
in all probability be the same as
against Santa Clara today. Wicker
sham will be the twirler, if the pitch
ers are sent to the mound in their
order, as has been the case during
the past few games.
Iliibes vs. Davis.
Against the Davis Farm contingent,
the Cardinal baby tossers should put
up a strong front. Although the north
ern team has been winning consist
ently this year, the freshmen with
the same nine that has represented
the first year students so far this
season, are doped to clean up.
Peterson, Kaiser, and Boydston can
be used in the box, E. Mitchell will
be on the receiving end;' R. Mitchell,
Messick, Shriver, and Cowan will
compose the infield, while the long
flys will be gathered in by Ryan in
left, Lilly in center and Reagon in
right.

Both Karnes will be played in the
afternoon, the freshmen taking on the
fast nine from Davis Farm, while the
varsity will cross willows with the
Olympic Club aggregation. The pre
liminary contest will be started
promptly at 1:30, the main event
being scheduled for 3:15. It is ex
pected that the full nine innings will
be played in both games.
Season Tickets Valid.
Graduate Manager Behrens has
made arrangements with the visiting
teams so that local fans will be able
to use season tickets for admission.
Those without the useful pasteboards
will, however, be given bleacher seats
for both contests for the usual tweu
ty-five cents admission price. Jack
McCarthy, who has seen service in the
American League as umpire, and who
now officiates in the Pacific Coast
League, has again been secured to
call the close ones.
Olympics Return.
Saturday's game will be the first
appearance ot the speedy Olympic
Club team since their tour of the
Hawaiian Islands. The long end of
the score in a majority of the con
tests across the water fell to the
"Winged O" nine, and their reputa
tion insures excellent competition for
the Cardinal tossers. The athletic
manager of the San Francisco organ
ization sent the following names as
the players scheduled for an appear
ance Saturday: Martin, p; Burke
and Riordan, c; McGrath, lb; Ken
nedy, 2b; Benn, 3b; Freine, ss; Bar
ker, If; Andrade, cf, and Tramutola,
rf.
Captain Dent is unable at this time
to definitely announce the complete
Stanford lineup, but the squad will
in all probability be the same as
against Santa Clara today. Wicker
sham will be the twirler, if the pitch
ers are sent to the mound in their
order, as has been the case during
the past few games.
Iliibes vs. Davis.
Against the Davis Farm contingent,
the Cardinal baby tossers should put
up a strong front. Although the north
ern team has been winning consist
ently this year, the freshmen with
the same nine that has represented
the first year students so far this
season, are doped to clean up.
Peterson, Kaiser, and Boydston can
be used in the box, E. Mitchell will
be on the receiving end;' R. Mitchell,
Messick, Shriver, and Cowan will
compose the infield, while the long
flys will be gathered in by Ryan in
left, Lilly in center and Reagon in
right.
