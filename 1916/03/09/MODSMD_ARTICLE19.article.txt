# Freshmen Are to Meet Blue and Gold Babies
## Action of Executive Committees Makes Possible Resumption of First Year Ball 
### 
For the first time since 1910 the
Stanford and California freshmen
baseball teams will meet in an inter
collegiate series. The executive com
mittees of the two universities rati
fied the proposition yesterday and
Graduate Manager Behrens of Stan
ford and John Stroud of the Berkeley
institution will get together Monday
to definitely arrange the dates.
Three games will be played, com
ing somewhat near the same time as
the contests between the two varsities.
As is the case with the first string
teams, the best two out of three wins
the series, so there is a possibility
that but two games will be played.
Members of the nines will be eligible
for block numerals, the first worn by
freshmen baseballers for "baby team"
participation in six years.
Stanford should come out on the
long end of the scores according to
the dope at present. The local first
year contingent has won every game
played so far this season, except the
contest with the varsity on Monday,
when the score at the end of seven
innings stood 0-0. Their infield works
like a clock, the guardians of the out
er gardens are excellent fielders, while
the whole team has displayed remark
able hitting ability.
