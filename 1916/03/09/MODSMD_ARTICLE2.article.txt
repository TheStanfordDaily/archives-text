# LEARN MORE THAN CLASS ROOM KNOWLEDGE ADVISES PRESIDENT WHEELER IN ADDRESS
## California's Executive in Founders' Day Speech Tells Stanford That Education Consists of Knowing Men as Well as Books and That Students Should Do More Than Merely Absorb Courses in University Curriculums 
### 
That learning to know and work
with men, as well as with theories,
laws, literature, and natural forces is
the business of the student in
the college was the theme of
President Uenjamin hie Wheeler of
the University of California this morn
ing at the Founders' Day Assembly.
"To lielp find the way" was the way
President Wheeler summarized at the
end of his speech the chief aim of
the university. According to Doc
tor Wheeler, the university has a
greater work than to merely train
men for their various professions.
The address follows:
The Founders
At Cornell.
At Cornell University, on a noon
day twenty-five years ago, I saw a
carriage drive rapidly away from the
house of Andrew D. White on its way
to the Ithaca station. In the carriage
were Senator and Mrs. Leland Stan
ford. They had paid a brief visit to
Di. White in order to gain his advice
regarding the educational organization
of Stanford University, and especially
regarding the man to make President.
So definite and convincing had been
the good doctor's nomination that their
visit was cut short to a few hours, a
luncheon party on which a number of us
in tiie faculty had counted for favor
able introduction was hastily annulled
and the visitors hurried away to tako
their train and set it en route for
Bloomington, Indiana. Within less
than two days, we heard of Dr. .Jor
dan's acceptance.

agressions of President Wheeler:
If our wtills ore to beur but one
inscription, let these five words tell
what the university is for —To help
find the way.
Sooner or later the student must
learn the self-denying lesson that
there are many attractive proposi
tions hi the Announcement of
t ourscs which lie must let go by, as
thiye will he afterwards in life.
the subject of study a man
chooses is of far less importance
than the attitude he learns to assume
toward the truth. With the shrewd
est a/ foresight he can exercise, a
man is very likely to achieve his
lire-success in a widely different field
from that of his expectations.
I he day is already well past when
a man, because he plans to be an en
gineer, can profitably judge that he
has only to deal with dynamos,
pumps, wheels, and not with men
and motives.
Man rises to the highest there is
in linn when he shakes himself free
from limitation, superstition and
convention, and setting free mind
above the ruts of matter, re-discov
, ers his world by re-thinking it.

The loss of the luncheon and the
hurrying dust of those carriage wheels
left a very emphatic impression on
my mind. Even though I looked on
only from afar, [ could not fail to ap
preciate that something involving
great definiteness of intent was in the
making;—but only as the years pass
ed by did I come to know in full the
certitude ot purpose, which, inspired
by beneficent will and pledged in the
tenderest of human affections, ani
mated the action of that devoted pair
in those days five and twenty years
ago when the foundations of the Le
land Stanford Junior University first
were laid.
Founders Chose
Hiir Onriinizer.
bo far as their part was concerned
in what was to be done, they had no

hesitation, uncertainty or doubt. It
was their will and purpose to give to
the many foster-children of their love,
who in the years and centuries to
come should tread these halls, the
means of making their lives useful
and effective to the full. To this end
they provided endowment, buildings
and equipment, abundant beyond any
measure known hitherto; they chose,
to organize and lead the work of edu
cation, a man of largest mould, large
minded, generous, large-hearted be
ond the usual measure of men. Un
stintedly, unflinchingly, they did their
part. The rest they left to the gener
ations of scholarship and teachership,
and to them who, in the coming years,
shall have the gift of making men. As
to their part, they had no doubt; have
we as to our part? They determined
it that their foster-children down
through the generations should have
the privilege of a university educa
tion, they left the determination to the
teaching profession and their succes
sors in the trusteeship of the great
estate have done likewise.
Have We the Sarnie
Wide Vision?
They left this determination most
trustfully to our profession; I won
der it we, as a guild, are worthy of
the trust? Do we know ourselves
w bat a university is or are we really
much concerned to know? Or are we,
for example, more concerned to act
as special attorneys for the subjects
we severally teach and the depart
ments which represent them? Do we
use the bodies of learning which con
stitute our subjects for the upbuilding
of our students, or do we use our stu
dents for the glorifying of our sub
jects? Are we concerned to estimate
the social value of each of our vari
ous subjects within the body of the
whole, and assign to our students each
his mete indue season, or are we en
gaged in a line banditry to capture
and impound all we may? Are we not
floundering in the deep and rich
sloughs of theories and abstract con
tentions without building solid roads
of sound training toward definite
goals? Are we able to say from actual
experience which of our prescriptions
of studies will produce a certain re
quired result, other things being
equal? Can we confidently tell why
we prescribe calculus in one case and
English literature in another? Have
we noted in our experience the effect
of Greek in one case as against that
of metaphysics in another? We ha 'e
theories enough as to what ought ti
happen, but have we developed even
the outlines of an empiricism based
on stateable facts, which will guide
us confidently to a prescription for
a new case?
Public Expects Results
from Colleges.
And yet this public of ours expects
it of us, —not in every case and not
with equal trustfulness toward all of
us, but by and large they expect it of
us. They probably think we have
special knowledge on the subject de
rived from the oracles of our guild,
—knowledge which we do not reveal
except to the candidating neophytes
and on payment of a fee. It is the
same old story of the professional
monopoly all down the ages,—the law
yer with his phrase and seal; the
medicine man with his mysterious pre
scription, and his senatorial courtesy
toward the doctor first called in the
case: and the cleric with his formula
of escape from the pollution of sin
and the punishment eternal; —no mat
ter how they differed, all agreed in
the imposition of a fee; indeed unless
the fee is paid, the special knowledge
cannot be expected to go into effect.
The World Wonders
At College Rank.
It is remarkable how seldom our
public forces us to give account of the
values we attach to the long concate
nations of courses and curricula by
which we hold the patient candidates
aloof from their goals of degrees, and
build up the long Parnassan staircase
with many annual steps called grades
ripening toward the top into the
broad biennial grades called landings
where we let them take breath while
they asume a fresh title; matriculant,
certificated Junior, bachelor, master,
doctor. Meantime the gentle public
looks on, its gaze more than ever pre
occupied by the shifting colors of the
kaleidoscope, its mind more than ever
indisposed to exact an explanation of
conditions so elaborate, and its toler
ant heart more than ever unwilling to
interfere with the solemn Roman
augurs, who enthroned in the ancient
seat of augury on the hill proceed
with their interpretations of the flight
of birds.
-University Systems
Are Complicated.
So we go on laying down our sys
tems of prerequisites for this course
and that, building up our requirements
for this college and that school, inter
posing Subject A and Subject B with
calm confidence in the inexhaustibil
ity of the alphabet, and entrenching
our degrees behind barriers and en
tanglements past finding out except
to the Recorder or the Registrar.
All this is doubtless good, except
on the theory that the student him
self is an interested party and will
often wish to choose what is best for
him, as he is the one who suffers if
lie takes what is wrong for him; but
we are not here and now so much
concerned with what is doubtless good
or doubtless bad. We are rather con
cerned to note the fact that the pre
scriptions and requirements are made

and accepted without our being held
to strict account as to what symptoms
and results the prerequisites may be
expected to produce in the patient and
why,—as to whether the prerequisites
are really necessary or only a pleas
ant embellishment and why so, —as to
whether, for example, prerequisites
may not in large measure mean mere
ly relative immaturity in the pupil.
The World Has Confidence
111 Educators.
It certainly is a high compliment to
the teaching profession and a com
manding evidence of popular confi
dence that we are so seldom commend
ed or even asked to lay bare the mys
teries of our guild. The great un
initiated throng rests, it appears, in
■1 quiet asuranee that we know where
ve are going, though we do not tell;
and that we know the way, though
the chief evidence we publicly give
thereof may, to the world, seem to be
only a patient and steadfast continu
ity in the drawing of our salaries.
Most of us of the profession, if put
on the defensive, would stoutly deny
and deny with all candour that there
is any educational guild whatsoever,
still less any holy mysteries in the
keepership of a guild. We are sure
we have no sacred incantations where
with to expel the evil spirits of ig
norance, in spite of the courses in
pedagogy required for a teacher's cer
tificate; and we are sure we rely on
110 consecrated formulas and recipes
wherewith to equip the neophytes,
though with some of us the text-book
has become a Bible and our lectures
issue from the sear and yellow leaf
more than from our blood-red lives.
The indoctrination which proceeds by
the dictation of dead formulas is a
totally different thing from that in
spiration which springs direct from
life to life by the contagion of per
sonality.
Oppose Other Training
Than Collegiate.
We are quite sure furthermore that
we maintain no guild protecting a
monopoly or the outlines of one, and
yet we cannot help noting here and
there a touch of aversion among the
regular initiates as toward those who
"come up some other way like a thief
or a robber," via University Extension
and the Summer School.
It must too be confessed that in cer
tain externals we g've our uninitiated
public, even though it does not seem
much to mind it or resent it, some
reason to think that we are quite
busied with the maintenance of the
guild spirit. We nourish a weird rit
ual of bleachers, dervishes and oskies;
we cultivate all the forms of associa
tion; brotherhoods, alumni unions,
symbols, initiations and feasts for the
dead; we lay stress on matric
ulations and graduations and de
grees and decorate our plain
names with the feathers and
scalps of various alphabetic combina
tions: and like the Pharisees of old,
we make broad our phylacteries and
enlarge the borders of our garments.
There is indeed fair reason to pre
sume that when the sisters and the
uncles and the aunts come down for
Commencement and look dazedly on
at the mysteries, we are quite willing
they should be impressed that some
thing important is going on and has
been going on for these four costly
years, even though we might not al
ways be able to tell them just what
it is. And then there is that solemn
moment when the wto Roman augurs
wink at each other
What are Universities
Doing with Students?
This sounds all very terrible, but
at the worst it means no more than
that these thousands of students who
in hundreds of schools and colleges
are moving up to sure leadership
among their kind and toward help
fulness in society, are obtaining vari
ous equipment which we denominated
by the one term education, and are
obtaining it, all of them by aids and
processes which are abhorent to the
theories and prognostications of some
one or another of the educational au
thorities, —or are not supported by any
theory whatsoever or conceived of in
relation to any theory. Learning to
spell and absorbing the multiplica
tion table and developing a handwrit
ing were never in the good old times
recommended and enforced by refer
ence to any abstract considerations.
We just had to know that eight times
seven was fifty-six, for the very good
and competent reason that we had to.
The compelling power was not a body
]of psychological and biological con
siderations based on theory, but the
quickening power of the teacher ulti
mately based 011 love and muscle fibre.
Methods of Instruction
Based 011 Broad Beilections.
1
Nowadays our methods of instruc
tion are founded upon broad reflec
tions concerning the attitude which
ought to inspire the pupil when fac
ing the multiplication table. He must
not see it all at once, lest dismay lay
hold upon him. He must be encour
aged to entertain for it from the being
feelings of friendliness such as will
naturally lead toward a desire for fur
ther helpful acquaintanceship in the
future. A reasonable solicitude must
also be recognized lest there should
arise assigning exclusively to the num
ber fifty-six the resultant of the union
of seven and eight, and coupled with
the protest an ill concealed desire for
a somewhat larger liberty. The meth
od of earlier days, as I remember it,
involved a direct attempt to intrude
the multiplication table forcibly and
in large masses into the human throat
until these masses protruded consid
erably beyond the pupil's mouth.
The methods of those days were
harsher and more persistent than
those of today, but it can scarcely be
denied that multiplication and addition
were held to the firmer conventional
anchorage and that handwriting was
less likely to include the vertical and
both slopes in a single document.
We are Floundering in
Pedagogic Speculation.
What is true of elementary educa
tion is in its own way true of the uni
versitiy. We are floundering in peda
gogic speculation and expending in
theorizing regarding courses and
methods much good strength that is
sorely needed for consistent training,
the acquisitioh of accurate knowledge,
and the preparation to assume the
service of man in society.
In spite of the conflicting cries
which rise here and there from the
marketplace, it would seem there are
some plain things of simple observa
tion concerning which those who sit
in the porch might be esteemed to be
reasonably agreed. First there is the
importance of learning some one thing
well. The achievement of units bears
a very lax relation to getting an edu
cation. A congeries of two- and three
hour courses selected because of their
convenient time, their pleasant name,
and their charitable basis of credit
may yield a degree but will not, how
ever numerous, make mind, any more
than many moulds of jelly will build
a wall.
Students Must (Jo Dunn
To Firm Grounds.
Sooner or later the student must
learn the self-denying lesson that
there are many attractive propositions
in the Announcement of Courses which
he must lot go by, as there will be
afterwards in life. In doing one thing
well, he will learn more or less about
other things. Through one field mas
tered lie gets the lay of the land all
about him. It is the one way known
among men. John Kshleman, noble
man, —just now taken from us by an
all too early death, chose to spend

his graduate period at the University
in deepening his hold 011 the philoso
phy and Greek he had studied in his
undergraduate years, so that he might
somewhere have solid ground under
his feet. He never regretted it, far
the reverse; and surely no one who
knew how deep were the fountains at
which he drank, can believe he was
aught but the finer lawyer and states
man for the clioiee he made, short as
were his days.
Altitude Bather Than
Subject Counts.
The subject of study a man chooses
is of far less importance than the at
titude he learns to assume toward the
truth. With the shrewdest of fore
sight he can exercise, a man is very
likely to achieve his life-success in a
widely different field from that of his
expectation. But that is no ground
for disappointment; it is not even
certain that the shift involves waste.
It is not a man's outward equipment
that counts, but his character. The
subject of study is to be regarded as
little more than a certain healthy
food for a growing mental organism.
Feed well, keep clean, and let nature
do the rest.
Of more importance still than sub
ject or training is the competence to
transmute the form of learning into
the form of discovery. Toward stim
ulating this competency, in short
range or great, all higher training
must strive. Men who naturally dis
cover and who as carriers of infec
tion can in any form teach, must be
made to teach and not allowed to
isolate themselves in institutes, —for
fresh thinking is the very breath of
life to a university. A man who has
once in small or great exhausted all
that is known on a given matter and
having proceeded alone beyond the
outer picket line of the advance has
gained glimpse of new lands in new
relation to the old, has become there
by a changed man for all his life. A
new fever is in his blood. It is no
longer worth his while io borrow. Tie
has discovered.
He-disco*, er tlie World
By Ue-thlrkiiw It.
Man rises to the highest there is
in him when he shakes himself free
from imitation, superstitution and con

volition and setting free mind above
the ruts of matter re-discovers his
world by re-thinking it."
The university is distinctly a social
body. It arose out of clubs and din
ing halls, it exists primarily today
us a body of scholars living together
and stimulating each other in work
and counsel. The education its stu
dents receive, so far as the typical
students are concerned, comes less by
books and prescriptions than by the
unseen influence of atmosphere and
the zest of environment and stand
ards. We deplore it when we hear
that parents send their sons and
daughters to certain colleges where
they may acquire fortunate social con
nections in point of caste and wealth,
or even that they are sent to New
England "at least long enough," so
the saying goes, "to take on their
broad a's," but this is after all only
| a passing perversion of the finer and
I nobler social meaning of the college.
Men .Must Learn to
Work With Men.
This is a social world we have come
to live in and no matter what the field
]of work we choose, our preparation
! for it must assume in first line the
social form. The day is already well
past when a man because he plans
to be an engineer can profitably judge
that he has only to deal with dyna
mos, pumps and wheels, and not with
men and motives. Engineers quite as
much as any profession will find they
have to adopt their lives and fitness
to the needs of men living in social
communities. Already the strong de
mand is rising all through the en
gineering world for men trained hi
commercial law, in ecomomics and
in the efficient use of English speech.
A University for Men
To Learn To Advance.
A university is a place where men
living together in the sharing of out
look and tasks may shape their lives
to social need by learning to under
stand one province where human
thought has leveled roads and by
helping find the further way.
If our walls are to but one

What are Universities
Doing with Students?
This sounds all very terrible, but
at the worst it means no more than
that these thousands of students who
in hundreds of schools and colleges
are moving up to sure leadership
among their kind and toward help
fulness in society, are obtaining vari
ous equipment which we denominated
by the one term education, and are
obtaining it, all of them by aids and
processes which are abhorent to the
theories and prognostications of some
one or another of the educational au
thorities, —or are not supported by any
theory whatsoever or conceived of in
relation to any theory. Learning to
spell and absorbing the multiplica
tion table and developing a handwrit
ing were never in the good old times
recommended and enforced by refer
ence to any abstract considerations.
We just had to know that eight times
seven was fifty-six, for the very good
and competent reason that we had to.
The compelling power was not a body
]of psychological and biological con
siderations based on theory, but the
quickening power of the teacher ulti
mately based 011 love and muscle fibre.
Methods of Instruction
Based 011 Broad Beilections.
1
Nowadays our methods of instruc
tion are founded upon broad reflec
tions concerning the attitude which
ought to inspire the pupil when fac
ing the multiplication table. He must
not see it all at once, lest dismay lay
hold upon him. He must be encour
aged to entertain for it from the being
feelings of friendliness such as will
naturally lead toward a desire for fur
ther helpful acquaintanceship in the
future. A reasonable solicitude must
also be recognized lest there should
arise assigning exclusively to the num
ber fifty-six the resultant of the union
of seven and eight, and coupled with
the protest an ill concealed desire for
a somewhat larger liberty. The meth
od of earlier days, as I remember it,
involved a direct attempt to intrude
the multiplication table forcibly and
in large masses into the human throat
until these masses protruded consid
erably beyond the pupil's mouth.
The methods of those days were
harsher and more persistent than
those of today, but it can scarcely be
denied that multiplication and addition
were held to the firmer conventional
anchorage and that handwriting was
less likely to include the vertical and
both slopes in a single document.
We are Floundering in
Pedagogic Speculation.
What is true of elementary educa
tion is in its own way true of the uni
versitiy. We are floundering in peda
gogic speculation and expending in
theorizing regarding courses and
methods much good strength that is
sorely needed for consistent training,
the acquisitioh of accurate knowledge,
and the preparation to assume the
service of man in society.
In spite of the conflicting cries
which rise here and there from the
marketplace, it would seem there are
some plain things of simple observa
tion concerning which those who sit
in the porch might be esteemed to be
reasonably agreed. First there is the
importance of learning some one thing
well. The achievement of units bears
a very lax relation to getting an edu
cation. A congeries of two- and three
hour courses selected because of their
convenient time, their pleasant name,
and their charitable basis of credit
may yield a degree but will not, how
ever numerous, make mind, any more
than many moulds of jelly will build
a wall.
Students Must (Jo Dunn
To Firm Grounds.
Sooner or later the student must
learn the self-denying lesson that
there are many attractive propositions
in the Announcement of Courses which
he must lot go by, as there will be
afterwards in life. In doing one thing
well, he will learn more or less about
other things. Through one field mas
tered lie gets the lay of the land all
about him. It is the one way known
among men. John Kshleman, noble
man, —just now taken from us by an
all too early death, chose to spend

his graduate period at the University
in deepening his hold 011 the philoso
phy and Greek he had studied in his
undergraduate years, so that he might
somewhere have solid ground under
his feet. He never regretted it, far
the reverse; and surely no one who
knew how deep were the fountains at
which he drank, can believe he was
aught but the finer lawyer and states
man for the clioiee he made, short as
were his days.
Altitude Bather Than
Subject Counts.
The subject of study a man chooses
is of far less importance than the at
titude he learns to assume toward the
truth. With the shrewdest of fore
sight he can exercise, a man is very
likely to achieve his life-success in a
widely different field from that of his
expectation. But that is no ground
for disappointment; it is not even
certain that the shift involves waste.
It is not a man's outward equipment
that counts, but his character. The
subject of study is to be regarded as
little more than a certain healthy
food for a growing mental organism.
Feed well, keep clean, and let nature
do the rest.
Of more importance still than sub
ject or training is the competence to
transmute the form of learning into
the form of discovery. Toward stim
ulating this competency, in short
range or great, all higher training
must strive. Men who naturally dis
cover and who as carriers of infec
tion can in any form teach, must be
made to teach and not allowed to
isolate themselves in institutes, —for
fresh thinking is the very breath of
life to a university. A man who has
once in small or great exhausted all
that is known on a given matter and
having proceeded alone beyond the
outer picket line of the advance has
gained glimpse of new lands in new
relation to the old, has become there
by a changed man for all his life. A
new fever is in his blood. It is no
longer worth his while io borrow. Tie
has discovered.
He-disco*, er tlie World

Man rises to the highest there is
in him when he shakes himself free
from imitation, superstitution and con

volition and setting free mind above
the ruts of matter re-discovers his
world by re-thinking it."
The university is distinctly a social
body. It arose out of clubs and din
ing halls, it exists primarily today
us a body of scholars living together
and stimulating each other in work
and counsel. The education its stu
dents receive, so far as the typical
students are concerned, comes less by
books and prescriptions than by the
unseen influence of atmosphere and
the zest of environment and stand
ards. We deplore it when we hear
that parents send their sons and
daughters to certain colleges where
they may acquire fortunate social con
nections in point of caste and wealth,
or even that they are sent to New
England "at least long enough," so
the saying goes, "to take on their
broad a's," but this is after all only
| a passing perversion of the finer and
I nobler social meaning of the college.
Men .Must Learn to
Work With Men.
This is a social world we have come
to live in and no matter what the field
]of work we choose, our preparation
! for it must assume in first line the
social form. The day is already well
past when a man because he plans
to be an engineer can profitably judge
that he has only to deal with dyna
mos, pumps and wheels, and not with
men and motives. Engineers quite as
much as any profession will find they
have to adopt their lives and fitness
to the needs of men living in social
communities. Already the strong de
mand is rising all through the en
gineering world for men trained hi
commercial law, in ecomomics and
in the efficient use of English speech.
A University for Men
To Learn To Advance.
A university is a place where men
living together in the sharing of out
look and tasks may shape their lives
to social need by learning to under
stand one province where human
thought has leveled roads and by
helping find the further way.

President Uenjamin hie Wheeler of
the University of California this morn

"To lielp find the way" was the way
President Wheeler summarized at the

The Founders
At Cornell.
At Cornell University, on a noon
day twenty-five years ago, I saw a
carriage drive rapidly away from the
house of Andrew D. White on its way
to the Ithaca station. In the carriage
were Senator and Mrs. Leland Stan
ford. They had paid a brief visit to
Di. White in order to gain his advice
regarding the educational organization
of Stanford University, and especially
regarding the man to make President.
So definite and convincing had been
the good doctor's nomination that their
visit was cut short to a few hours, a
luncheon party on which a number of us
in tiie faculty had counted for favor
able introduction was hastily annulled
and the visitors hurried away to tako
their train and set it en route for
Bloomington, Indiana. Within less
than two days, we heard of Dr. .Jor
dan's acceptance.

The loss of the luncheon and the
hurrying dust of those carriage wheels
left a very emphatic impression on
my mind. Even though I looked on
only from afar, [ could not fail to ap
preciate that something involving
great definiteness of intent was in the
making;—but only as the years pass
ed by did I come to know in full the
certitude ot purpose, which, inspired
by beneficent will and pledged in the
tenderest of human affections, ani
mated the action of that devoted pair
in those days five and twenty years
ago when the foundations of the Le
land Stanford Junior University first
were laid.
Founders Chose
Hiir Onriinizer.
bo far as their part was concerned
in what was to be done, they had no

hesitation, uncertainty or doubt. It
was their will and purpose to give to
the many foster-children of their love,
who in the years and centuries to
come should tread these halls, the
means of making their lives useful
and effective to the full. To this end
they provided endowment, buildings
and equipment, abundant beyond any
measure known hitherto; they chose,
to organize and lead the work of edu
cation, a man of largest mould, large
minded, generous, large-hearted be
ond the usual measure of men. Un
stintedly, unflinchingly, they did their
part. The rest they left to the gener
ations of scholarship and teachership,
and to them who, in the coming years,
shall have the gift of making men. As
to their part, they had no doubt; have
we as to our part? They determined
it that their foster-children down
through the generations should have
the privilege of a university educa
tion, they left the determination to the
teaching profession and their succes
sors in the trusteeship of the great
estate have done likewise.
Have We the Sarnie
Wide Vision?
They left this determination most
trustfully to our profession; I won
der it we, as a guild, are worthy of
the trust? Do we know ourselves
w bat a university is or are we really
much concerned to know? Or are we,
for example, more concerned to act
as special attorneys for the subjects
we severally teach and the depart
ments which represent them? Do we
use the bodies of learning which con
stitute our subjects for the upbuilding
of our students, or do we use our stu
dents for the glorifying of our sub
jects? Are we concerned to estimate
the social value of each of our vari
ous subjects within the body of the
whole, and assign to our students each
his mete indue season, or are we en
gaged in a line banditry to capture
and impound all we may? Are we not
floundering in the deep and rich
sloughs of theories and abstract con
tentions without building solid roads
of sound training toward definite
goals? Are we able to say from actual
experience which of our prescriptions
of studies will produce a certain re
quired result, other things being
equal? Can we confidently tell why
we prescribe calculus in one case and
English literature in another? Have
we noted in our experience the effect
of Greek in one case as against that
of metaphysics in another? We ha 'e
theories enough as to what ought ti
happen, but have we developed even
the outlines of an empiricism based
on stateable facts, which will guide
us confidently to a prescription for
a new case?
Public Expects Results
from Colleges.
And yet this public of ours expects
it of us, —not in every case and not
with equal trustfulness toward all of
us, but by and large they expect it of
us. They probably think we have
special knowledge on the subject de
rived from the oracles of our guild,
—knowledge which we do not reveal
except to the candidating neophytes
and on payment of a fee. It is the
same old story of the professional
monopoly all down the ages,—the law
yer with his phrase and seal; the
medicine man with his mysterious pre
scription, and his senatorial courtesy
toward the doctor first called in the
case: and the cleric with his formula
of escape from the pollution of sin
and the punishment eternal; —no mat
ter how they differed, all agreed in
the imposition of a fee; indeed unless
the fee is paid, the special knowledge
cannot be expected to go into effect.
The World Wonders
At College Rank.
It is remarkable how seldom our
public forces us to give account of the
values we attach to the long concate
nations of courses and curricula by
which we hold the patient candidates
aloof from their goals of degrees, and
build up the long Parnassan staircase
with many annual steps called grades
ripening toward the top into the
broad biennial grades called landings
where we let them take breath while
they asume a fresh title; matriculant,
certificated Junior, bachelor, master,
doctor. Meantime the gentle public
looks on, its gaze more than ever pre
occupied by the shifting colors of the
kaleidoscope, its mind more than ever
indisposed to exact an explanation of
conditions so elaborate, and its toler
ant heart more than ever unwilling to
interfere with the solemn Roman
augurs, who enthroned in the ancient
seat of augury on the hill proceed
with their interpretations of the flight
of birds.
-University Systems
Are Complicated.
So we go on laying down our sys
tems of prerequisites for this course
and that, building up our requirements
for this college and that school, inter
posing Subject A and Subject B with
calm confidence in the inexhaustibil
ity of the alphabet, and entrenching
our degrees behind barriers and en
tanglements past finding out except
to the Recorder or the Registrar.
All this is doubtless good, except
on the theory that the student him
self is an interested party and will
often wish to choose what is best for
him, as he is the one who suffers if
lie takes what is wrong for him; but
we are not here and now so much
concerned with what is doubtless good
or doubtless bad. We are rather con
cerned to note the fact that the pre
scriptions and requirements are made

and accepted without our being held
to strict account as to what symptoms
and results the prerequisites may be
expected to produce in the patient and
why,—as to whether the prerequisites
are really necessary or only a pleas
ant embellishment and why so, —as to
whether, for example, prerequisites
may not in large measure mean mere
ly relative immaturity in the pupil.
The World Has Confidence
111 Educators.
It certainly is a high compliment to
the teaching profession and a com
manding evidence of popular confi
dence that we are so seldom commend
ed or even asked to lay bare the mys
teries of our guild. The great un
initiated throng rests, it appears, in
■1 quiet asuranee that we know where
ve are going, though we do not tell;
and that we know the way, though
the chief evidence we publicly give
thereof may, to the world, seem to be
only a patient and steadfast continu
ity in the drawing of our salaries.
Most of us of the profession, if put
on the defensive, would stoutly deny
and deny with all candour that there
is any educational guild whatsoever,
still less any holy mysteries in the
keepership of a guild. We are sure
we have no sacred incantations where
with to expel the evil spirits of ig
norance, in spite of the courses in
pedagogy required for a teacher's cer
tificate; and we are sure we rely on
110 consecrated formulas and recipes
wherewith to equip the neophytes,
though with some of us the text-book
has become a Bible and our lectures
issue from the sear and yellow leaf
more than from our blood-red lives.
The indoctrination which proceeds by
the dictation of dead formulas is a
totally different thing from that in
spiration which springs direct from
life to life by the contagion of per
sonality.
Oppose Other Training
Than Collegiate.
We are quite sure furthermore that
we maintain no guild protecting a
monopoly or the outlines of one, and
yet we cannot help noting here and
there a touch of aversion among the
regular initiates as toward those who
"come up some other way like a thief
or a robber," via University Extension
and the Summer School.
It must too be confessed that in cer
tain externals we g've our uninitiated
public, even though it does not seem
much to mind it or resent it, some
reason to think that we are quite
busied with the maintenance of the
guild spirit. We nourish a weird rit
ual of bleachers, dervishes and oskies;
we cultivate all the forms of associa
tion; brotherhoods, alumni unions,
symbols, initiations and feasts for the
dead; we lay stress on matric
ulations and graduations and de
grees and decorate our plain
names with the feathers and
scalps of various alphabetic combina
tions: and like the Pharisees of old,
we make broad our phylacteries and
enlarge the borders of our garments.
There is indeed fair reason to pre
sume that when the sisters and the
uncles and the aunts come down for
Commencement and look dazedly on
at the mysteries, we are quite willing
they should be impressed that some
thing important is going on and has
been going on for these four costly
years, even though we might not al
ways be able to tell them just what
it is. And then there is that solemn
moment when the wto Roman augurs

come should tread these halls, the
means of making their lives useful
and effective to the full. To this end
they provided endowment, buildings
and equipment, abundant beyond any
measure known hitherto; they chose,
to organize and lead the work of edu
cation, a man of largest mould, large
minded, generous, large-hearted be
ond the usual measure of men. Un
stintedly, unflinchingly, they did their
part. The rest they left to the gener
ations of scholarship and teachership,
and to them who, in the coming years,
shall have the gift of making men. As
to their part, they had no doubt; have
we as to our part? They determined
it that their foster-children down
through the generations should have
the privilege of a university educa
tion, they left the determination to the
teaching profession and their succes
sors in the trusteeship of the great
estate have done likewise.
Have We the Sarnie
Wide Vision?
They left this determination most
trustfully to our profession; I won
der it we, as a guild, are worthy of
the trust? Do we know ourselves
w bat a university is or are we really
much concerned to know? Or are we,
for example, more concerned to act
as special attorneys for the subjects
we severally teach and the depart
ments which represent them? Do we
use the bodies of learning which con
stitute our subjects for the upbuilding
of our students, or do we use our stu
dents for the glorifying of our sub
jects? Are we concerned to estimate
the social value of each of our vari
ous subjects within the body of the
whole, and assign to our students each
his mete indue season, or are we en
gaged in a line banditry to capture
and impound all we may? Are we not
floundering in the deep and rich
sloughs of theories and abstract con
tentions without building solid roads
of sound training toward definite
goals? Are we able to say from actual
experience which of our prescriptions
of studies will produce a certain re
quired result, other things being
equal? Can we confidently tell why
we prescribe calculus in one case and
English literature in another? Have
we noted in our experience the effect
of Greek in one case as against that
of metaphysics in another? We ha 'e
theories enough as to what ought ti
happen, but have we developed even
the outlines of an empiricism based
on stateable facts, which will guide
us confidently to a prescription for
a new case?
Public Expects Results
from Colleges.
And yet this public of ours expects
it of us, —not in every case and not
with equal trustfulness toward all of
us, but by and large they expect it of
us. They probably think we have
special knowledge on the subject de
rived from the oracles of our guild,
—knowledge which we do not reveal
except to the candidating neophytes
and on payment of a fee. It is the
same old story of the professional
monopoly all down the ages,—the law
yer with his phrase and seal; the
medicine man with his mysterious pre
scription, and his senatorial courtesy
toward the doctor first called in the
case: and the cleric with his formula
of escape from the pollution of sin
and the punishment eternal; —no mat
ter how they differed, all agreed in
the imposition of a fee; indeed unless
the fee is paid, the special knowledge
cannot be expected to go into effect.
The World Wonders
At College Rank.
It is remarkable how seldom our
public forces us to give account of the
values we attach to the long concate
nations of courses and curricula by
which we hold the patient candidates
aloof from their goals of degrees, and
build up the long Parnassan staircase
with many annual steps called grades
ripening toward the top into the
broad biennial grades called landings
where we let them take breath while
they asume a fresh title; matriculant,
certificated Junior, bachelor, master,
doctor. Meantime the gentle public
looks on, its gaze more than ever pre
occupied by the shifting colors of the
kaleidoscope, its mind more than ever
indisposed to exact an explanation of
conditions so elaborate, and its toler
ant heart more than ever unwilling to
interfere with the solemn Roman
augurs, who enthroned in the ancient
seat of augury on the hill proceed
with their interpretations of the flight
of birds.
-University Systems
Are Complicated.
So we go on laying down our sys
tems of prerequisites for this course
and that, building up our requirements
for this college and that school, inter
posing Subject A and Subject B with
calm confidence in the inexhaustibil
ity of the alphabet, and entrenching
our degrees behind barriers and en
tanglements past finding out except
to the Recorder or the Registrar.
All this is doubtless good, except
on the theory that the student him
self is an interested party and will
often wish to choose what is best for
him, as he is the one who suffers if
lie takes what is wrong for him; but
we are not here and now so much
concerned with what is doubtless good
or doubtless bad. We are rather con
cerned to note the fact that the pre
scriptions and requirements are made

and accepted without our being held
to strict account as to what symptoms
and results the prerequisites may be
expected to produce in the patient and
why,—as to whether the prerequisites
are really necessary or only a pleas
ant embellishment and why so, —as to
whether, for example, prerequisites
may not in large measure mean mere
ly relative immaturity in the pupil.
The World Has Confidence
111 Educators.
It certainly is a high compliment to
the teaching profession and a com
manding evidence of popular confi
dence that we are so seldom commend
ed or even asked to lay bare the mys
teries of our guild. The great un
initiated throng rests, it appears, in
■1 quiet asuranee that we know where
ve are going, though we do not tell;
and that we know the way, though
the chief evidence we publicly give
thereof may, to the world, seem to be
only a patient and steadfast continu
ity in the drawing of our salaries.
Most of us of the profession, if put
on the defensive, would stoutly deny
and deny with all candour that there
is any educational guild whatsoever,
still less any holy mysteries in the
keepership of a guild. We are sure
we have no sacred incantations where
with to expel the evil spirits of ig
norance, in spite of the courses in
pedagogy required for a teacher's cer
tificate; and we are sure we rely on
110 consecrated formulas and recipes
wherewith to equip the neophytes,
though with some of us the text-book
has become a Bible and our lectures
issue from the sear and yellow leaf
more than from our blood-red lives.
The indoctrination which proceeds by
the dictation of dead formulas is a
totally different thing from that in
spiration which springs direct from
life to life by the contagion of per
sonality.
Oppose Other Training
Than Collegiate.
We are quite sure furthermore that
we maintain no guild protecting a
monopoly or the outlines of one, and
yet we cannot help noting here and
there a touch of aversion among the
regular initiates as toward those who
"come up some other way like a thief
or a robber," via University Extension
and the Summer School.
It must too be confessed that in cer
tain externals we g've our uninitiated
public, even though it does not seem
much to mind it or resent it, some
reason to think that we are quite
busied with the maintenance of the
guild spirit. We nourish a weird rit
ual of bleachers, dervishes and oskies;
we cultivate all the forms of associa
tion; brotherhoods, alumni unions,
symbols, initiations and feasts for the
dead; we lay stress on matric
ulations and graduations and de
grees and decorate our plain
names with the feathers and
scalps of various alphabetic combina
tions: and like the Pharisees of old,
we make broad our phylacteries and
enlarge the borders of our garments.
There is indeed fair reason to pre
sume that when the sisters and the
uncles and the aunts come down for
Commencement and look dazedly on
at the mysteries, we are quite willing
they should be impressed that some
thing important is going on and has
been going on for these four costly
years, even though we might not al
ways be able to tell them just what
it is. And then there is that solemn
moment when the wto Roman augurs

What are Universities
Doing with Students?
This sounds all very terrible, but
at the worst it means no more than
that these thousands of students who
in hundreds of schools and colleges
are moving up to sure leadership
among their kind and toward help
fulness in society, are obtaining vari
ous equipment which we denominated
by the one term education, and are
obtaining it, all of them by aids and
processes which are abhorent to the
theories and prognostications of some
one or another of the educational au
thorities, —or are not supported by any
theory whatsoever or conceived of in
relation to any theory. Learning to
spell and absorbing the multiplica
tion table and developing a handwrit
ing were never in the good old times
recommended and enforced by refer
ence to any abstract considerations.
We just had to know that eight times
seven was fifty-six, for the very good
and competent reason that we had to.
The compelling power was not a body
]of psychological and biological con
siderations based on theory, but the
quickening power of the teacher ulti
mately based 011 love and muscle fibre.
Methods of Instruction
Based 011 Broad Beilections.
1
Nowadays our methods of instruc
tion are founded upon broad reflec
tions concerning the attitude which
ought to inspire the pupil when fac
ing the multiplication table. He must
not see it all at once, lest dismay lay
hold upon him. He must be encour
aged to entertain for it from the being
feelings of friendliness such as will
naturally lead toward a desire for fur
ther helpful acquaintanceship in the
future. A reasonable solicitude must
also be recognized lest there should
arise assigning exclusively to the num
ber fifty-six the resultant of the union
of seven and eight, and coupled with
the protest an ill concealed desire for
a somewhat larger liberty. The meth
od of earlier days, as I remember it,
involved a direct attempt to intrude
the multiplication table forcibly and
in large masses into the human throat
until these masses protruded consid
erably beyond the pupil's mouth.
The methods of those days were
harsher and more persistent than
those of today, but it can scarcely be
denied that multiplication and addition
were held to the firmer conventional
anchorage and that handwriting was
less likely to include the vertical and
both slopes in a single document.
We are Floundering in
Pedagogic Speculation.
What is true of elementary educa
tion is in its own way true of the uni
versitiy. We are floundering in peda
gogic speculation and expending in
theorizing regarding courses and
methods much good strength that is
sorely needed for consistent training,
the acquisitioh of accurate knowledge,
and the preparation to assume the
service of man in society.
In spite of the conflicting cries
which rise here and there from the
marketplace, it would seem there are
some plain things of simple observa
tion concerning which those who sit
in the porch might be esteemed to be
reasonably agreed. First there is the
importance of learning some one thing
well. The achievement of units bears
a very lax relation to getting an edu
cation. A congeries of two- and three
hour courses selected because of their
convenient time, their pleasant name,
and their charitable basis of credit
may yield a degree but will not, how
ever numerous, make mind, any more
than many moulds of jelly will build
a wall.
Students Must (Jo Dunn
To Firm Grounds.
Sooner or later the student must
learn the self-denying lesson that
there are many attractive propositions
in the Announcement of Courses which
he must lot go by, as there will be
afterwards in life. In doing one thing
well, he will learn more or less about
other things. Through one field mas
tered lie gets the lay of the land all
about him. It is the one way known
among men. John Kshleman, noble
man, —just now taken from us by an
all too early death, chose to spend

his graduate period at the University
in deepening his hold 011 the philoso
phy and Greek he had studied in his
undergraduate years, so that he might
somewhere have solid ground under
his feet. He never regretted it, far
the reverse; and surely no one who
knew how deep were the fountains at
which he drank, can believe he was
aught but the finer lawyer and states
man for the clioiee he made, short as
were his days.
Altitude Bather Than
Subject Counts.
The subject of study a man chooses
is of far less importance than the at
titude he learns to assume toward the
truth. With the shrewdest of fore
sight he can exercise, a man is very
likely to achieve his life-success in a
widely different field from that of his
expectation. But that is no ground
for disappointment; it is not even
certain that the shift involves waste.
It is not a man's outward equipment
that counts, but his character. The
subject of study is to be regarded as
little more than a certain healthy
food for a growing mental organism.
Feed well, keep clean, and let nature
do the rest.
Of more importance still than sub
ject or training is the competence to
transmute the form of learning into
the form of discovery. Toward stim
ulating this competency, in short
range or great, all higher training
must strive. Men who naturally dis
cover and who as carriers of infec
tion can in any form teach, must be
made to teach and not allowed to
isolate themselves in institutes, —for
fresh thinking is the very breath of
life to a university. A man who has
once in small or great exhausted all
that is known on a given matter and
having proceeded alone beyond the
outer picket line of the advance has
gained glimpse of new lands in new
relation to the old, has become there
by a changed man for all his life. A
new fever is in his blood. It is no
longer worth his while io borrow. Tie
has discovered.
He-disco*, er tlie World
By Ue-thlrkiiw It.
Man rises to the highest there is
in him when he shakes himself free
from imitation, superstitution and con

volition and setting free mind above
the ruts of matter re-discovers his
world by re-thinking it."
The university is distinctly a social
body. It arose out of clubs and din
ing halls, it exists primarily today
us a body of scholars living together
and stimulating each other in work
and counsel. The education its stu
dents receive, so far as the typical
students are concerned, comes less by
books and prescriptions than by the
unseen influence of atmosphere and
the zest of environment and stand
ards. We deplore it when we hear
that parents send their sons and
daughters to certain colleges where
they may acquire fortunate social con
nections in point of caste and wealth,
or even that they are sent to New
England "at least long enough," so
the saying goes, "to take on their
broad a's," but this is after all only
| a passing perversion of the finer and
I nobler social meaning of the college.
Men .Must Learn to
Work With Men.
This is a social world we have come
to live in and no matter what the field
]of work we choose, our preparation
! for it must assume in first line the
social form. The day is already well
past when a man because he plans
to be an engineer can profitably judge
that he has only to deal with dyna
mos, pumps and wheels, and not with
men and motives. Engineers quite as
much as any profession will find they
have to adopt their lives and fitness
to the needs of men living in social
communities. Already the strong de
mand is rising all through the en
gineering world for men trained hi
commercial law, in ecomomics and
in the efficient use of English speech.
A University for Men
To Learn To Advance.
A university is a place where men
living together in the sharing of out
look and tasks may shape their lives
to social need by learning to under
stand one province where human
thought has leveled roads and by
helping find the further way.
If our walls are to but one
inscription, let these five words stand

I toll what the university is for:
I TO HELP FIND TH£ WAY.
That learning to know and work
with men, as well as with theories,
laws, literature, and natural forces is
the business of the student in
the college was the theme of
President Uenjamin hie Wheeler of
the University of California this morn
ing at the Founders' Day Assembly.
"To lielp find the way" was the way
President Wheeler summarized at the
end of his speech the chief aim of
the university. According to Doc
tor Wheeler, the university has a
greater work than to merely train
men for their various professions.
The address follows:
The Founders
At Cornell.
At Cornell University, on a noon
day twenty-five years ago, I saw a
carriage drive rapidly away from the
house of Andrew D. White on its way
to the Ithaca station. In the carriage
were Senator and Mrs. Leland Stan
ford. They had paid a brief visit to
Di. White in order to gain his advice
regarding the educational organization
of Stanford University, and especially
regarding the man to make President.
So definite and convincing had been
the good doctor's nomination that their
visit was cut short to a few hours, a
luncheon party on which a number of us
in tiie faculty had counted for favor
able introduction was hastily annulled
and the visitors hurried away to tako
their train and set it en route for
Bloomington, Indiana. Within less
than two days, we heard of Dr. .Jor
dan's acceptance.

agressions of President Wheeler:
If our wtills ore to beur but one

what the university is for —To help
find the way.
Sooner or later the student must
learn the self-denying lesson that
there are many attractive proposi
tions hi the Announcement of
t ourscs which lie must let go by, as
thiye will he afterwards in life.
the subject of study a man
chooses is of far less importance
than the attitude he learns to assume
toward the truth. With the shrewd
est a/ foresight he can exercise, a
man is very likely to achieve his
lire-success in a widely different field
from that of his expectations.
I he day is already well past when
a man, because he plans to be an en

Man rises to the highest there is
in linn when he shakes himself free
from limitation, superstition and
convention, and setting free mind

, ers his world by re-thinking it.

The loss of the luncheon and the
hurrying dust of those carriage wheels
left a very emphatic impression on
my mind. Even though I looked on
only from afar, [ could not fail to ap
preciate that something involving
great definiteness of intent was in the
making;—but only as the years pass
ed by did I come to know in full the
certitude ot purpose, which, inspired
by beneficent will and pledged in the
tenderest of human affections, ani
mated the action of that devoted pair
in those days five and twenty years
ago when the foundations of the Le
land Stanford Junior University first
were laid.

To Firm Grounds.
Sooner or later the student must
learn the self-denying lesson that
there are many attractive propositions
in the Announcement of Courses which
he must lot go by, as there will be
afterwards in life. In doing one thing
well, he will learn more or less about
other things. Through one field mas
tered lie gets the lay of the land all
about him. It is the one way known
among men. John Kshleman, noble
man, —just now taken from us by an
all too early death, chose to spend

his graduate period at the University
in deepening his hold 011 the philoso
phy and Greek he had studied in his
undergraduate years, so that he might
somewhere have solid ground under
his feet. He never regretted it, far
the reverse; and surely no one who
knew how deep were the fountains at
which he drank, can believe he was
aught but the finer lawyer and states
man for the clioiee he made, short as
were his days.
Altitude Bather Than
Subject Counts.
The subject of study a man chooses
is of far less importance than the at
titude he learns to assume toward the
truth. With the shrewdest of fore
sight he can exercise, a man is very
likely to achieve his life-success in a
widely different field from that of his
expectation. But that is no ground
for disappointment; it is not even
certain that the shift involves waste.
It is not a man's outward equipment
that counts, but his character. The
subject of study is to be regarded as
little more than a certain healthy
food for a growing mental organism.
Feed well, keep clean, and let nature
do the rest.
Of more importance still than sub
ject or training is the competence to
transmute the form of learning into
the form of discovery. Toward stim
ulating this competency, in short
range or great, all higher training
must strive. Men who naturally dis
cover and who as carriers of infec
tion can in any form teach, must be
made to teach and not allowed to
isolate themselves in institutes, —for
fresh thinking is the very breath of
life to a university. A man who has
once in small or great exhausted all
that is known on a given matter and
having proceeded alone beyond the
outer picket line of the advance has
gained glimpse of new lands in new
relation to the old, has become there
by a changed man for all his life. A
new fever is in his blood. It is no
longer worth his while io borrow. Tie

Man rises to the highest there is
in him when he shakes himself free

The university is distinctly a social
body. It arose out of clubs and din
ing halls, it exists primarily today
us a body of scholars living together
and stimulating each other in work
and counsel. The education its stu
dents receive, so far as the typical
students are concerned, comes less by
books and prescriptions than by the
unseen influence of atmosphere and
the zest of environment and stand
ards. We deplore it when we hear
that parents send their sons and
daughters to certain colleges where
they may acquire fortunate social con
nections in point of caste and wealth,
or even that they are sent to New
England "at least long enough," so
the saying goes, "to take on their

Men .Must Learn to
Work With Men.
This is a social world we have come
to live in and no matter what the field
]of work we choose, our preparation
! for it must assume in first line the
social form. The day is already well
past when a man because he plans
to be an engineer can profitably judge
that he has only to deal with dyna
mos, pumps and wheels, and not with
men and motives. Engineers quite as
much as any profession will find they
have to adopt their lives and fitness
to the needs of men living in social
communities. Already the strong de
mand is rising all through the en
gineering world for men trained hi
commercial law, in ecomomics and
in the efficient use of English speech.
A University for Men
To Learn To Advance.
A university is a place where men
living together in the sharing of out
look and tasks may shape their lives
to social need by learning to under
stand one province where human
thought has leveled roads and by
helping find the further way.

I TO HELP FIND TH£ WAY.
That learning to know and work
with men, as well as with theories,
laws, literature, and natural forces is
the business of the student in
the college was the theme of
President Uenjamin hie Wheeler of
the University of California this morn
ing at the Founders' Day Assembly.
"To lielp find the way" was the way
President Wheeler summarized at the
end of his speech the chief aim of
the university. According to Doc

greater work than to merely train
men for their various professions.
The address follows:
The Founders
At Cornell.
At Cornell University, on a noon
day twenty-five years ago, I saw a
carriage drive rapidly away from the
house of Andrew D. White on its way
to the Ithaca station. In the carriage
were Senator and Mrs. Leland Stan
ford. They had paid a brief visit to
Di. White in order to gain his advice
regarding the educational organization
of Stanford University, and especially
regarding the man to make President.
So definite and convincing had been
the good doctor's nomination that their
visit was cut short to a few hours, a
luncheon party on which a number of us
in tiie faculty had counted for favor
able introduction was hastily annulled
and the visitors hurried away to tako
their train and set it en route for
Bloomington, Indiana. Within less
than two days, we heard of Dr. .Jor
dan's acceptance.

than the attitude he learns to assume

est a/ foresight he can exercise, a
man is very likely to achieve his

The loss of the luncheon and the
hurrying dust of those carriage wheels
left a very emphatic impression on
my mind. Even though I looked on
only from afar, [ could not fail to ap
preciate that something involving
great definiteness of intent was in the
making;—but only as the years pass
ed by did I come to know in full the
certitude ot purpose, which, inspired
by beneficent will and pledged in the
tenderest of human affections, ani
mated the action of that devoted pair
in those days five and twenty years
ago when the foundations of the Le
land Stanford Junior University first
were laid.
Founders Chose
Hiir Onriinizer.
bo far as their part was concerned
in what was to be done, they had no

hesitation, uncertainty or doubt. It
was their will and purpose to give to
the many foster-children of their love,
who in the years and centuries to
come should tread these halls, the
means of making their lives useful
and effective to the full. To this end
they provided endowment, buildings
and equipment, abundant beyond any
measure known hitherto; they chose,
to organize and lead the work of edu
cation, a man of largest mould, large
minded, generous, large-hearted be
ond the usual measure of men. Un
stintedly, unflinchingly, they did their
part. The rest they left to the gener
ations of scholarship and teachership,
and to them who, in the coming years,
shall have the gift of making men. As
to their part, they had no doubt; have
we as to our part? They determined
it that their foster-children down
through the generations should have
the privilege of a university educa
tion, they left the determination to the
teaching profession and their succes
sors in the trusteeship of the great
estate have done likewise.
Have We the Sarnie
Wide Vision?
They left this determination most
trustfully to our profession; I won
der it we, as a guild, are worthy of
the trust? Do we know ourselves
w bat a university is or are we really
much concerned to know? Or are we,
for example, more concerned to act
as special attorneys for the subjects
we severally teach and the depart
ments which represent them? Do we
use the bodies of learning which con
stitute our subjects for the upbuilding
of our students, or do we use our stu
dents for the glorifying of our sub
jects? Are we concerned to estimate
the social value of each of our vari
ous subjects within the body of the
whole, and assign to our students each
his mete indue season, or are we en
gaged in a line banditry to capture
and impound all we may? Are we not
floundering in the deep and rich
sloughs of theories and abstract con
tentions without building solid roads
of sound training toward definite
goals? Are we able to say from actual
experience which of our prescriptions
of studies will produce a certain re
quired result, other things being
equal? Can we confidently tell why
we prescribe calculus in one case and
English literature in another? Have
we noted in our experience the effect
of Greek in one case as against that
of metaphysics in another? We ha 'e
theories enough as to what ought ti
happen, but have we developed even
the outlines of an empiricism based
on stateable facts, which will guide
us confidently to a prescription for
a new case?
Public Expects Results
from Colleges.
And yet this public of ours expects
it of us, —not in every case and not
with equal trustfulness toward all of
us, but by and large they expect it of
us. They probably think we have
special knowledge on the subject de
rived from the oracles of our guild,
—knowledge which we do not reveal
except to the candidating neophytes
and on payment of a fee. It is the
same old story of the professional
monopoly all down the ages,—the law
yer with his phrase and seal; the
medicine man with his mysterious pre
scription, and his senatorial courtesy
toward the doctor first called in the
case: and the cleric with his formula
of escape from the pollution of sin
and the punishment eternal; —no mat
ter how they differed, all agreed in
the imposition of a fee; indeed unless
the fee is paid, the special knowledge
cannot be expected to go into effect.
The World Wonders
At College Rank.
It is remarkable how seldom our
public forces us to give account of the
values we attach to the long concate
nations of courses and curricula by
which we hold the patient candidates
aloof from their goals of degrees, and
build up the long Parnassan staircase
with many annual steps called grades
ripening toward the top into the
broad biennial grades called landings
where we let them take breath while
they asume a fresh title; matriculant,
certificated Junior, bachelor, master,
doctor. Meantime the gentle public
looks on, its gaze more than ever pre
occupied by the shifting colors of the
kaleidoscope, its mind more than ever
indisposed to exact an explanation of
conditions so elaborate, and its toler
ant heart more than ever unwilling to
interfere with the solemn Roman
augurs, who enthroned in the ancient
seat of augury on the hill proceed
with their interpretations of the flight
of birds.
-University Systems
Are Complicated.
So we go on laying down our sys
tems of prerequisites for this course
and that, building up our requirements
for this college and that school, inter
posing Subject A and Subject B with
calm confidence in the inexhaustibil
ity of the alphabet, and entrenching
our degrees behind barriers and en
tanglements past finding out except
to the Recorder or the Registrar.
All this is doubtless good, except
on the theory that the student him
self is an interested party and will
often wish to choose what is best for
him, as he is the one who suffers if
lie takes what is wrong for him; but
we are not here and now so much
concerned with what is doubtless good
or doubtless bad. We are rather con
cerned to note the fact that the pre
scriptions and requirements are made

and accepted without our being held
to strict account as to what symptoms
and results the prerequisites may be
expected to produce in the patient and
why,—as to whether the prerequisites
are really necessary or only a pleas
ant embellishment and why so, —as to
whether, for example, prerequisites
may not in large measure mean mere
ly relative immaturity in the pupil.
The World Has Confidence
111 Educators.
It certainly is a high compliment to
the teaching profession and a com
manding evidence of popular confi
dence that we are so seldom commend
ed or even asked to lay bare the mys
teries of our guild. The great un
initiated throng rests, it appears, in
■1 quiet asuranee that we know where
ve are going, though we do not tell;
and that we know the way, though
the chief evidence we publicly give
thereof may, to the world, seem to be
only a patient and steadfast continu
ity in the drawing of our salaries.
Most of us of the profession, if put
on the defensive, would stoutly deny
and deny with all candour that there
is any educational guild whatsoever,
still less any holy mysteries in the
keepership of a guild. We are sure
we have no sacred incantations where
with to expel the evil spirits of ig
norance, in spite of the courses in
pedagogy required for a teacher's cer
tificate; and we are sure we rely on
110 consecrated formulas and recipes
wherewith to equip the neophytes,
though with some of us the text-book
has become a Bible and our lectures
issue from the sear and yellow leaf
more than from our blood-red lives.
The indoctrination which proceeds by
the dictation of dead formulas is a
totally different thing from that in
spiration which springs direct from
life to life by the contagion of per
sonality.
Oppose Other Training
Than Collegiate.
We are quite sure furthermore that
we maintain no guild protecting a
monopoly or the outlines of one, and
yet we cannot help noting here and
there a touch of aversion among the
regular initiates as toward those who
"come up some other way like a thief
or a robber," via University Extension
and the Summer School.
It must too be confessed that in cer
tain externals we g've our uninitiated
public, even though it does not seem
much to mind it or resent it, some
reason to think that we are quite
busied with the maintenance of the
guild spirit. We nourish a weird rit
ual of bleachers, dervishes and oskies;
we cultivate all the forms of associa
tion; brotherhoods, alumni unions,
symbols, initiations and feasts for the
dead; we lay stress on matric
ulations and graduations and de
grees and decorate our plain
names with the feathers and
scalps of various alphabetic combina
tions: and like the Pharisees of old,
we make broad our phylacteries and
enlarge the borders of our garments.
There is indeed fair reason to pre
sume that when the sisters and the
uncles and the aunts come down for
Commencement and look dazedly on
at the mysteries, we are quite willing
they should be impressed that some
thing important is going on and has
been going on for these four costly
years, even though we might not al
ways be able to tell them just what
it is. And then there is that solemn
moment when the wto Roman augurs
wink at each other
What are Universities
Doing with Students?
This sounds all very terrible, but
at the worst it means no more than
that these thousands of students who
in hundreds of schools and colleges
are moving up to sure leadership
among their kind and toward help
fulness in society, are obtaining vari
ous equipment which we denominated
by the one term education, and are
obtaining it, all of them by aids and
processes which are abhorent to the
theories and prognostications of some
one or another of the educational au
thorities, —or are not supported by any
theory whatsoever or conceived of in
relation to any theory. Learning to
spell and absorbing the multiplica
tion table and developing a handwrit
ing were never in the good old times
recommended and enforced by refer
ence to any abstract considerations.
We just had to know that eight times
seven was fifty-six, for the very good
and competent reason that we had to.
The compelling power was not a body
]of psychological and biological con
siderations based on theory, but the
quickening power of the teacher ulti
mately based 011 love and muscle fibre.
Methods of Instruction
Based 011 Broad Beilections.
1
Nowadays our methods of instruc
tion are founded upon broad reflec
tions concerning the attitude which
ought to inspire the pupil when fac
ing the multiplication table. He must
not see it all at once, lest dismay lay
hold upon him. He must be encour
aged to entertain for it from the being
feelings of friendliness such as will
naturally lead toward a desire for fur
ther helpful acquaintanceship in the
future. A reasonable solicitude must
also be recognized lest there should
arise assigning exclusively to the num
ber fifty-six the resultant of the union
of seven and eight, and coupled with
the protest an ill concealed desire for
a somewhat larger liberty. The meth
od of earlier days, as I remember it,
involved a direct attempt to intrude
the multiplication table forcibly and
in large masses into the human throat
until these masses protruded consid
erably beyond the pupil's mouth.
The methods of those days were
harsher and more persistent than
those of today, but it can scarcely be
denied that multiplication and addition
were held to the firmer conventional
anchorage and that handwriting was
less likely to include the vertical and
both slopes in a single document.
We are Floundering in
Pedagogic Speculation.
What is true of elementary educa
tion is in its own way true of the uni
versitiy. We are floundering in peda
gogic speculation and expending in
theorizing regarding courses and
methods much good strength that is
sorely needed for consistent training,
the acquisitioh of accurate knowledge,
and the preparation to assume the
service of man in society.
In spite of the conflicting cries
which rise here and there from the
marketplace, it would seem there are
some plain things of simple observa
tion concerning which those who sit
in the porch might be esteemed to be
reasonably agreed. First there is the
importance of learning some one thing
well. The achievement of units bears
a very lax relation to getting an edu
cation. A congeries of two- and three
hour courses selected because of their
convenient time, their pleasant name,
and their charitable basis of credit
may yield a degree but will not, how
ever numerous, make mind, any more
than many moulds of jelly will build
a wall.
Students Must (Jo Dunn

Sooner or later the student must
learn the self-denying lesson that
there are many attractive propositions
in the Announcement of Courses which
he must lot go by, as there will be
afterwards in life. In doing one thing
well, he will learn more or less about
other things. Through one field mas
tered lie gets the lay of the land all

aloof from their goals of degrees, and
build up the long Parnassan staircase
with many annual steps called grades
ripening toward the top into the
broad biennial grades called landings
where we let them take breath while
they asume a fresh title; matriculant,
certificated Junior, bachelor, master,
doctor. Meantime the gentle public
looks on, its gaze more than ever pre
occupied by the shifting colors of the
kaleidoscope, its mind more than ever
indisposed to exact an explanation of
conditions so elaborate, and its toler
ant heart more than ever unwilling to
interfere with the solemn Roman
augurs, who enthroned in the ancient
seat of augury on the hill proceed
with their interpretations of the flight
of birds.
-University Systems
Are Complicated.
So we go on laying down our sys
tems of prerequisites for this course
and that, building up our requirements
for this college and that school, inter
posing Subject A and Subject B with
calm confidence in the inexhaustibil
ity of the alphabet, and entrenching
our degrees behind barriers and en
tanglements past finding out except
to the Recorder or the Registrar.
All this is doubtless good, except
on the theory that the student him
self is an interested party and will
often wish to choose what is best for
him, as he is the one who suffers if
lie takes what is wrong for him; but
we are not here and now so much
concerned with what is doubtless good
or doubtless bad. We are rather con
cerned to note the fact that the pre
scriptions and requirements are made

and accepted without our being held
to strict account as to what symptoms
and results the prerequisites may be
expected to produce in the patient and
why,—as to whether the prerequisites
are really necessary or only a pleas
ant embellishment and why so, —as to
whether, for example, prerequisites
may not in large measure mean mere
ly relative immaturity in the pupil.
The World Has Confidence
111 Educators.
It certainly is a high compliment to
the teaching profession and a com
manding evidence of popular confi
dence that we are so seldom commend
ed or even asked to lay bare the mys
teries of our guild. The great un
initiated throng rests, it appears, in
■1 quiet asuranee that we know where
ve are going, though we do not tell;
and that we know the way, though
the chief evidence we publicly give
thereof may, to the world, seem to be
only a patient and steadfast continu
ity in the drawing of our salaries.
Most of us of the profession, if put
on the defensive, would stoutly deny
and deny with all candour that there
is any educational guild whatsoever,
still less any holy mysteries in the
keepership of a guild. We are sure
we have no sacred incantations where
with to expel the evil spirits of ig
norance, in spite of the courses in
pedagogy required for a teacher's cer
tificate; and we are sure we rely on
110 consecrated formulas and recipes
wherewith to equip the neophytes,
though with some of us the text-book
has become a Bible and our lectures
issue from the sear and yellow leaf
more than from our blood-red lives.
The indoctrination which proceeds by
the dictation of dead formulas is a
totally different thing from that in
spiration which springs direct from
life to life by the contagion of per
sonality.
Oppose Other Training
Than Collegiate.
We are quite sure furthermore that
we maintain no guild protecting a
monopoly or the outlines of one, and
yet we cannot help noting here and
there a touch of aversion among the
regular initiates as toward those who
"come up some other way like a thief
or a robber," via University Extension
and the Summer School.
It must too be confessed that in cer
tain externals we g've our uninitiated
public, even though it does not seem
much to mind it or resent it, some
reason to think that we are quite
busied with the maintenance of the
guild spirit. We nourish a weird rit
ual of bleachers, dervishes and oskies;
we cultivate all the forms of associa
tion; brotherhoods, alumni unions,
symbols, initiations and feasts for the
dead; we lay stress on matric
ulations and graduations and de
grees and decorate our plain
names with the feathers and
scalps of various alphabetic combina
tions: and like the Pharisees of old,
we make broad our phylacteries and
enlarge the borders of our garments.
There is indeed fair reason to pre
sume that when the sisters and the
uncles and the aunts come down for
Commencement and look dazedly on
at the mysteries, we are quite willing
they should be impressed that some
thing important is going on and has
been going on for these four costly
years, even though we might not al
ways be able to tell them just what
it is. And then there is that solemn
moment when the wto Roman augurs

What are Universities
Doing with Students?
This sounds all very terrible, but
at the worst it means no more than
that these thousands of students who
in hundreds of schools and colleges
are moving up to sure leadership
among their kind and toward help
fulness in society, are obtaining vari
ous equipment which we denominated
by the one term education, and are
obtaining it, all of them by aids and
processes which are abhorent to the
theories and prognostications of some
one or another of the educational au
thorities, —or are not supported by any
theory whatsoever or conceived of in
relation to any theory. Learning to
spell and absorbing the multiplica
tion table and developing a handwrit
ing were never in the good old times
recommended and enforced by refer
ence to any abstract considerations.
We just had to know that eight times
seven was fifty-six, for the very good
and competent reason that we had to.
The compelling power was not a body
]of psychological and biological con
siderations based on theory, but the
quickening power of the teacher ulti
mately based 011 love and muscle fibre.
Methods of Instruction
Based 011 Broad Beilections.
1
Nowadays our methods of instruc
tion are founded upon broad reflec
tions concerning the attitude which
ought to inspire the pupil when fac
ing the multiplication table. He must
not see it all at once, lest dismay lay
hold upon him. He must be encour
aged to entertain for it from the being
feelings of friendliness such as will
naturally lead toward a desire for fur
ther helpful acquaintanceship in the
future. A reasonable solicitude must
also be recognized lest there should
arise assigning exclusively to the num
ber fifty-six the resultant of the union
of seven and eight, and coupled with
the protest an ill concealed desire for
a somewhat larger liberty. The meth
od of earlier days, as I remember it,
involved a direct attempt to intrude
the multiplication table forcibly and
in large masses into the human throat
until these masses protruded consid
erably beyond the pupil's mouth.
The methods of those days were
harsher and more persistent than
those of today, but it can scarcely be
denied that multiplication and addition
were held to the firmer conventional
anchorage and that handwriting was
less likely to include the vertical and
both slopes in a single document.
We are Floundering in
Pedagogic Speculation.
What is true of elementary educa
tion is in its own way true of the uni
versitiy. We are floundering in peda
gogic speculation and expending in
theorizing regarding courses and
methods much good strength that is
sorely needed for consistent training,
the acquisitioh of accurate knowledge,
and the preparation to assume the
service of man in society.
In spite of the conflicting cries
which rise here and there from the
marketplace, it would seem there are
some plain things of simple observa
tion concerning which those who sit
in the porch might be esteemed to be
reasonably agreed. First there is the
importance of learning some one thing
well. The achievement of units bears
a very lax relation to getting an edu
cation. A congeries of two- and three
hour courses selected because of their
convenient time, their pleasant name,
and their charitable basis of credit
may yield a degree but will not, how
ever numerous, make mind, any more
than many moulds of jelly will build
a wall.
Students Must (Jo Dunn
To Firm Grounds.
Sooner or later the student must
learn the self-denying lesson that
there are many attractive propositions
in the Announcement of Courses which
he must lot go by, as there will be
afterwards in life. In doing one thing
well, he will learn more or less about
other things. Through one field mas
tered lie gets the lay of the land all
about him. It is the one way known
among men. John Kshleman, noble
man, —just now taken from us by an
all too early death, chose to spend

his graduate period at the University
in deepening his hold 011 the philoso
phy and Greek he had studied in his
undergraduate years, so that he might
somewhere have solid ground under
his feet. He never regretted it, far
the reverse; and surely no one who
knew how deep were the fountains at
which he drank, can believe he was
aught but the finer lawyer and states
man for the clioiee he made, short as
were his days.
Altitude Bather Than
Subject Counts.
The subject of study a man chooses
is of far less importance than the at
titude he learns to assume toward the
truth. With the shrewdest of fore
sight he can exercise, a man is very
likely to achieve his life-success in a
widely different field from that of his
expectation. But that is no ground
for disappointment; it is not even
certain that the shift involves waste.
It is not a man's outward equipment
that counts, but his character. The
subject of study is to be regarded as
little more than a certain healthy
food for a growing mental organism.
Feed well, keep clean, and let nature
do the rest.
Of more importance still than sub
ject or training is the competence to
transmute the form of learning into
the form of discovery. Toward stim
ulating this competency, in short
range or great, all higher training
must strive. Men who naturally dis
cover and who as carriers of infec
tion can in any form teach, must be
made to teach and not allowed to
isolate themselves in institutes, —for
fresh thinking is the very breath of
life to a university. A man who has
once in small or great exhausted all
that is known on a given matter and
having proceeded alone beyond the
outer picket line of the advance has
gained glimpse of new lands in new
relation to the old, has become there
by a changed man for all his life. A
new fever is in his blood. It is no
longer worth his while io borrow. Tie
has discovered.

Man rises to the highest there is
in him when he shakes himself free
from imitation, superstitution and con

volition and setting free mind above
the ruts of matter re-discovers his
world by re-thinking it."
The university is distinctly a social
body. It arose out of clubs and din
ing halls, it exists primarily today
us a body of scholars living together
and stimulating each other in work
and counsel. The education its stu
dents receive, so far as the typical
students are concerned, comes less by
books and prescriptions than by the
unseen influence of atmosphere and
the zest of environment and stand
ards. We deplore it when we hear
that parents send their sons and
daughters to certain colleges where
they may acquire fortunate social con
nections in point of caste and wealth,
or even that they are sent to New
England "at least long enough," so
the saying goes, "to take on their
broad a's," but this is after all only
| a passing perversion of the finer and
I nobler social meaning of the college.
Men .Must Learn to
Work With Men.
This is a social world we have come
to live in and no matter what the field
]of work we choose, our preparation
! for it must assume in first line the
social form. The day is already well
past when a man because he plans
to be an engineer can profitably judge
that he has only to deal with dyna
mos, pumps and wheels, and not with
men and motives. Engineers quite as
much as any profession will find they
have to adopt their lives and fitness
to the needs of men living in social
communities. Already the strong de
mand is rising all through the en
gineering world for men trained hi
commercial law, in ecomomics and
in the efficient use of English speech.
A University for Men
To Learn To Advance.
A university is a place where men
living together in the sharing of out
look and tasks may shape their lives
to social need by learning to under
stand one province where human
thought has leveled roads and by
helping find the further way.
If our walls are to but one

I toll what the university is for:
I TO HELP FIND TH£ WAY.
That learning to know and work
with men, as well as with theories,
laws, literature, and natural forces is
the business of the student in
the college was the theme of
President Uenjamin hie Wheeler of
the University of California this morn
ing at the Founders' Day Assembly.
"To lielp find the way" was the way
President Wheeler summarized at the
end of his speech the chief aim of
the university. According to Doc
tor Wheeler, the university has a
greater work than to merely train
men for their various professions.
The address follows:
The Founders
At Cornell.
At Cornell University, on a noon
day twenty-five years ago, I saw a
carriage drive rapidly away from the
house of Andrew D. White on its way
to the Ithaca station. In the carriage
were Senator and Mrs. Leland Stan
ford. They had paid a brief visit to
Di. White in order to gain his advice
regarding the educational organization
of Stanford University, and especially
regarding the man to make President.
So definite and convincing had been
the good doctor's nomination that their
visit was cut short to a few hours, a
luncheon party on which a number of us
in tiie faculty had counted for favor
able introduction was hastily annulled
and the visitors hurried away to tako
their train and set it en route for
Bloomington, Indiana. Within less
than two days, we heard of Dr. .Jor
dan's acceptance.

agressions of President Wheeler:
If our wtills ore to beur but one
inscription, let these five words tell
what the university is for —To help
find the way.
Sooner or later the student must
learn the self-denying lesson that
there are many attractive proposi
tions hi the Announcement of
t ourscs which lie must let go by, as
thiye will he afterwards in life.
the subject of study a man
chooses is of far less importance
than the attitude he learns to assume
toward the truth. With the shrewd
est a/ foresight he can exercise, a
man is very likely to achieve his
lire-success in a widely different field
from that of his expectations.
I he day is already well past when
a man, because he plans to be an en
gineer, can profitably judge that he
has only to deal with dynamos,
pumps, wheels, and not with men
and motives.
Man rises to the highest there is
in linn when he shakes himself free
from limitation, superstition and
convention, and setting free mind
above the ruts of matter, re-discov
, ers his world by re-thinking it.

The loss of the luncheon and the
hurrying dust of those carriage wheels
left a very emphatic impression on
my mind. Even though I looked on
only from afar, [ could not fail to ap
preciate that something involving
great definiteness of intent was in the
making;—but only as the years pass
ed by did I come to know in full the
certitude ot purpose, which, inspired
by beneficent will and pledged in the
tenderest of human affections, ani
mated the action of that devoted pair
in those days five and twenty years
ago when the foundations of the Le
land Stanford Junior University first
were laid.
Founders Chose
Hiir Onriinizer.
bo far as their part was concerned
in what was to be done, they had no

hesitation, uncertainty or doubt. It
was their will and purpose to give to
the many foster-children of their love,
who in the years and centuries to
come should tread these halls, the
means of making their lives useful
and effective to the full. To this end
they provided endowment, buildings
and equipment, abundant beyond any
measure known hitherto; they chose,
to organize and lead the work of edu
cation, a man of largest mould, large
minded, generous, large-hearted be
ond the usual measure of men. Un
stintedly, unflinchingly, they did their
part. The rest they left to the gener
ations of scholarship and teachership,
and to them who, in the coming years,
shall have the gift of making men. As
to their part, they had no doubt; have
we as to our part? They determined
it that their foster-children down
through the generations should have
the privilege of a university educa
tion, they left the determination to the
teaching profession and their succes
sors in the trusteeship of the great
estate have done likewise.
Have We the Sarnie
Wide Vision?
They left this determination most
trustfully to our profession; I won
der it we, as a guild, are worthy of
the trust? Do we know ourselves
w bat a university is or are we really
much concerned to know? Or are we,
for example, more concerned to act
as special attorneys for the subjects
we severally teach and the depart
ments which represent them? Do we
use the bodies of learning which con
stitute our subjects for the upbuilding
of our students, or do we use our stu
dents for the glorifying of our sub
jects? Are we concerned to estimate
the social value of each of our vari
ous subjects within the body of the
whole, and assign to our students each
his mete indue season, or are we en
gaged in a line banditry to capture
and impound all we may? Are we not
floundering in the deep and rich
sloughs of theories and abstract con
tentions without building solid roads
of sound training toward definite
goals? Are we able to say from actual
experience which of our prescriptions
of studies will produce a certain re
quired result, other things being
equal? Can we confidently tell why
we prescribe calculus in one case and
English literature in another? Have
we noted in our experience the effect
of Greek in one case as against that
of metaphysics in another? We ha 'e
theories enough as to what ought ti
happen, but have we developed even
the outlines of an empiricism based
on stateable facts, which will guide
us confidently to a prescription for
a new case?
Public Expects Results
from Colleges.
And yet this public of ours expects
it of us, —not in every case and not
with equal trustfulness toward all of
us, but by and large they expect it of
us. They probably think we have
special knowledge on the subject de
rived from the oracles of our guild,
—knowledge which we do not reveal
except to the candidating neophytes
and on payment of a fee. It is the
same old story of the professional
monopoly all down the ages,—the law
yer with his phrase and seal; the
medicine man with his mysterious pre
scription, and his senatorial courtesy
toward the doctor first called in the
case: and the cleric with his formula
of escape from the pollution of sin
and the punishment eternal; —no mat
ter how they differed, all agreed in
the imposition of a fee; indeed unless
the fee is paid, the special knowledge
cannot be expected to go into effect.
The World Wonders
At College Rank.
It is remarkable how seldom our
public forces us to give account of the
values we attach to the long concate
nations of courses and curricula by
which we hold the patient candidates
aloof from their goals of degrees, and
build up the long Parnassan staircase
with many annual steps called grades
ripening toward the top into the
broad biennial grades called landings
where we let them take breath while
they asume a fresh title; matriculant,
certificated Junior, bachelor, master,
doctor. Meantime the gentle public
looks on, its gaze more than ever pre
occupied by the shifting colors of the
kaleidoscope, its mind more than ever
indisposed to exact an explanation of
conditions so elaborate, and its toler
ant heart more than ever unwilling to

Men .Must Learn to
Work With Men.
This is a social world we have come
to live in and no matter what the field
]of work we choose, our preparation
! for it must assume in first line the
social form. The day is already well
past when a man because he plans
to be an engineer can profitably judge
that he has only to deal with dyna
mos, pumps and wheels, and not with
men and motives. Engineers quite as
much as any profession will find they
have to adopt their lives and fitness
to the needs of men living in social
communities. Already the strong de
mand is rising all through the en
gineering world for men trained hi
commercial law, in ecomomics and
in the efficient use of English speech.
A University for Men
To Learn To Advance.
A university is a place where men
living together in the sharing of out
look and tasks may shape their lives
to social need by learning to under
stand one province where human
thought has leveled roads and by
helping find the further way.
If our walls are to but one

I toll what the university is for:
I TO HELP FIND TH£ WAY.
That learning to know and work
with men, as well as with theories,
laws, literature, and natural forces is
the business of the student in
the college was the theme of
President Uenjamin hie Wheeler of
the University of California this morn
ing at the Founders' Day Assembly.
"To lielp find the way" was the way
President Wheeler summarized at the
end of his speech the chief aim of
the university. According to Doc
tor Wheeler, the university has a
greater work than to merely train
men for their various professions.
The address follows:
The Founders
At Cornell.
At Cornell University, on a noon
day twenty-five years ago, I saw a
carriage drive rapidly away from the
house of Andrew D. White on its way
to the Ithaca station. In the carriage
were Senator and Mrs. Leland Stan
ford. They had paid a brief visit to
Di. White in order to gain his advice
regarding the educational organization
of Stanford University, and especially
regarding the man to make President.
So definite and convincing had been
the good doctor's nomination that their
visit was cut short to a few hours, a
luncheon party on which a number of us
in tiie faculty had counted for favor
able introduction was hastily annulled
and the visitors hurried away to tako
their train and set it en route for
Bloomington, Indiana. Within less
than two days, we heard of Dr. .Jor
dan's acceptance.

agressions of President Wheeler:
If our wtills ore to beur but one
inscription, let these five words tell
what the university is for —To help
find the way.
Sooner or later the student must
learn the self-denying lesson that
there are many attractive proposi
tions hi the Announcement of
t ourscs which lie must let go by, as
thiye will he afterwards in life.
the subject of study a man
chooses is of far less importance
than the attitude he learns to assume
toward the truth. With the shrewd
est a/ foresight he can exercise, a
man is very likely to achieve his
lire-success in a widely different field
from that of his expectations.
I he day is already well past when
a man, because he plans to be an en
gineer, can profitably judge that he
has only to deal with dynamos,
pumps, wheels, and not with men
and motives.
Man rises to the highest there is
in linn when he shakes himself free
from limitation, superstition and
convention, and setting free mind
above the ruts of matter, re-discov
, ers his world by re-thinking it.

The loss of the luncheon and the
hurrying dust of those carriage wheels
left a very emphatic impression on
my mind. Even though I looked on
only from afar, [ could not fail to ap
preciate that something involving
great definiteness of intent was in the
making;—but only as the years pass
ed by did I come to know in full the
certitude ot purpose, which, inspired
by beneficent will and pledged in the
tenderest of human affections, ani
mated the action of that devoted pair
in those days five and twenty years
ago when the foundations of the Le
land Stanford Junior University first
were laid.
Founders Chose
Hiir Onriinizer.
bo far as their part was concerned
in what was to be done, they had no

hesitation, uncertainty or doubt. It
was their will and purpose to give to
the many foster-children of their love,
who in the years and centuries to
come should tread these halls, the
means of making their lives useful
and effective to the full. To this end
they provided endowment, buildings
and equipment, abundant beyond any
measure known hitherto; they chose,
to organize and lead the work of edu
cation, a man of largest mould, large
minded, generous, large-hearted be
ond the usual measure of men. Un
stintedly, unflinchingly, they did their
part. The rest they left to the gener
ations of scholarship and teachership,
and to them who, in the coming years,
shall have the gift of making men. As
to their part, they had no doubt; have
we as to our part? They determined
it that their foster-children down
through the generations should have
the privilege of a university educa
tion, they left the determination to the
teaching profession and their succes
sors in the trusteeship of the great
estate have done likewise.
Have We the Sarnie
Wide Vision?
They left this determination most
trustfully to our profession; I won
der it we, as a guild, are worthy of
the trust? Do we know ourselves
w bat a university is or are we really
much concerned to know? Or are we,
for example, more concerned to act
as special attorneys for the subjects
we severally teach and the depart
ments which represent them? Do we
use the bodies of learning which con
stitute our subjects for the upbuilding
of our students, or do we use our stu
dents for the glorifying of our sub
jects? Are we concerned to estimate
the social value of each of our vari
ous subjects within the body of the
whole, and assign to our students each
his mete indue season, or are we en
gaged in a line banditry to capture
and impound all we may? Are we not
floundering in the deep and rich
sloughs of theories and abstract con
tentions without building solid roads
of sound training toward definite
goals? Are we able to say from actual
experience which of our prescriptions
of studies will produce a certain re
quired result, other things being
equal? Can we confidently tell why
we prescribe calculus in one case and
English literature in another? Have
we noted in our experience the effect
of Greek in one case as against that
of metaphysics in another? We ha 'e
theories enough as to what ought ti
happen, but have we developed even
the outlines of an empiricism based
on stateable facts, which will guide
us confidently to a prescription for
a new case?
Public Expects Results
from Colleges.
And yet this public of ours expects
it of us, —not in every case and not
with equal trustfulness toward all of
us, but by and large they expect it of
us. They probably think we have
special knowledge on the subject de
rived from the oracles of our guild,
—knowledge which we do not reveal
except to the candidating neophytes
and on payment of a fee. It is the
same old story of the professional
monopoly all down the ages,—the law
yer with his phrase and seal; the
medicine man with his mysterious pre
scription, and his senatorial courtesy
toward the doctor first called in the
case: and the cleric with his formula
of escape from the pollution of sin
and the punishment eternal; —no mat
ter how they differed, all agreed in
the imposition of a fee; indeed unless
the fee is paid, the special knowledge
cannot be expected to go into effect.
The World Wonders
At College Rank.
It is remarkable how seldom our
public forces us to give account of the
values we attach to the long concate
nations of courses and curricula by
which we hold the patient candidates
aloof from their goals of degrees, and
build up the long Parnassan staircase
with many annual steps called grades
ripening toward the top into the
broad biennial grades called landings
where we let them take breath while
they asume a fresh title; matriculant,
certificated Junior, bachelor, master,
doctor. Meantime the gentle public
looks on, its gaze more than ever pre
occupied by the shifting colors of the
kaleidoscope, its mind more than ever
indisposed to exact an explanation of
conditions so elaborate, and its toler
ant heart more than ever unwilling to
interfere with the solemn Roman
augurs, who enthroned in the ancient
seat of augury on the hill proceed
with their interpretations of the flight
of birds.
-University Systems
Are Complicated.
So we go on laying down our sys
tems of prerequisites for this course
and that, building up our requirements
for this college and that school, inter
posing Subject A and Subject B with
calm confidence in the inexhaustibil
ity of the alphabet, and entrenching
our degrees behind barriers and en
tanglements past finding out except
to the Recorder or the Registrar.
All this is doubtless good, except
on the theory that the student him
self is an interested party and will
often wish to choose what is best for
him, as he is the one who suffers if
lie takes what is wrong for him; but
we are not here and now so much
concerned with what is doubtless good
or doubtless bad. We are rather con
cerned to note the fact that the pre
scriptions and requirements are made

and accepted without our being held
to strict account as to what symptoms
and results the prerequisites may be
expected to produce in the patient and
why,—as to whether the prerequisites
are really necessary or only a pleas
ant embellishment and why so, —as to
whether, for example, prerequisites
may not in large measure mean mere
ly relative immaturity in the pupil.
The World Has Confidence
111 Educators.
It certainly is a high compliment to
the teaching profession and a com
manding evidence of popular confi
dence that we are so seldom commend
ed or even asked to lay bare the mys
teries of our guild. The great un
initiated throng rests, it appears, in
■1 quiet asuranee that we know where
ve are going, though we do not tell;
and that we know the way, though
the chief evidence we publicly give
thereof may, to the world, seem to be
only a patient and steadfast continu
ity in the drawing of our salaries.
Most of us of the profession, if put
on the defensive, would stoutly deny
and deny with all candour that there
is any educational guild whatsoever,
still less any holy mysteries in the
keepership of a guild. We are sure
we have no sacred incantations where
with to expel the evil spirits of ig
norance, in spite of the courses in
pedagogy required for a teacher's cer
tificate; and we are sure we rely on
110 consecrated formulas and recipes
wherewith to equip the neophytes,
though with some of us the text-book
has become a Bible and our lectures
issue from the sear and yellow leaf
more than from our blood-red lives.
The indoctrination which proceeds by
the dictation of dead formulas is a
totally different thing from that in
spiration which springs direct from
life to life by the contagion of per
sonality.
Oppose Other Training
Than Collegiate.
We are quite sure furthermore that
we maintain no guild protecting a
monopoly or the outlines of one, and
yet we cannot help noting here and
there a touch of aversion among the
regular initiates as toward those who
"come up some other way like a thief
or a robber," via University Extension
and the Summer School.
It must too be confessed that in cer
tain externals we g've our uninitiated
public, even though it does not seem
much to mind it or resent it, some
reason to think that we are quite
busied with the maintenance of the
guild spirit. We nourish a weird rit
ual of bleachers, dervishes and oskies;
we cultivate all the forms of associa
tion; brotherhoods, alumni unions,
symbols, initiations and feasts for the
dead; we lay stress on matric
ulations and graduations and de
grees and decorate our plain
names with the feathers and
scalps of various alphabetic combina
tions: and like the Pharisees of old,
we make broad our phylacteries and
enlarge the borders of our garments.
There is indeed fair reason to pre
sume that when the sisters and the
uncles and the aunts come down for
Commencement and look dazedly on
at the mysteries, we are quite willing
they should be impressed that some
thing important is going on and has
been going on for these four costly
years, even though we might not al
ways be able to tell them just what
it is. And then there is that solemn
moment when the wto Roman augurs
wink at each other
What are Universities
Doing with Students?
This sounds all very terrible, but
at the worst it means no more than
that these thousands of students who
in hundreds of schools and colleges
are moving up to sure leadership
among their kind and toward help
fulness in society, are obtaining vari
ous equipment which we denominated
by the one term education, and are
obtaining it, all of them by aids and
processes which are abhorent to the
theories and prognostications of some
one or another of the educational au
thorities, —or are not supported by any
theory whatsoever or conceived of in
relation to any theory. Learning to
spell and absorbing the multiplica
tion table and developing a handwrit
ing were never in the good old times
recommended and enforced by refer
ence to any abstract considerations.
We just had to know that eight times
seven was fifty-six, for the very good
and competent reason that we had to.
The compelling power was not a body
]of psychological and biological con
siderations based on theory, but the
quickening power of the teacher ulti
mately based 011 love and muscle fibre.
Methods of Instruction
Based 011 Broad Beilections.
1
Nowadays our methods of instruc
tion are founded upon broad reflec
tions concerning the attitude which
ought to inspire the pupil when fac
ing the multiplication table. He must
not see it all at once, lest dismay lay
hold upon him. He must be encour
aged to entertain for it from the being
feelings of friendliness such as will
naturally lead toward a desire for fur
ther helpful acquaintanceship in the
future. A reasonable solicitude must
also be recognized lest there should
arise assigning exclusively to the num
ber fifty-six the resultant of the union
of seven and eight, and coupled with
the protest an ill concealed desire for
a somewhat larger liberty. The meth
od of earlier days, as I remember it,
involved a direct attempt to intrude
the multiplication table forcibly and
in large masses into the human throat
until these masses protruded consid
erably beyond the pupil's mouth.
The methods of those days were
harsher and more persistent than
those of today, but it can scarcely be
denied that multiplication and addition
were held to the firmer conventional
anchorage and that handwriting was
less likely to include the vertical and
both slopes in a single document.
We are Floundering in
Pedagogic Speculation.
What is true of elementary educa
tion is in its own way true of the uni
versitiy. We are floundering in peda
gogic speculation and expending in
theorizing regarding courses and
methods much good strength that is
sorely needed for consistent training,
the acquisitioh of accurate knowledge,
and the preparation to assume the
service of man in society.
In spite of the conflicting cries
which rise here and there from the
marketplace, it would seem there are
some plain things of simple observa
tion concerning which those who sit
in the porch might be esteemed to be
reasonably agreed. First there is the
importance of learning some one thing
well. The achievement of units bears
a very lax relation to getting an edu
cation. A congeries of two- and three
hour courses selected because of their
convenient time, their pleasant name,
and their charitable basis of credit
may yield a degree but will not, how
ever numerous, make mind, any more
than many moulds of jelly will build
a wall.
Students Must (Jo Dunn
To Firm Grounds.
Sooner or later the student must
learn the self-denying lesson that
there are many attractive propositions
in the Announcement of Courses which
he must lot go by, as there will be
afterwards in life. In doing one thing
well, he will learn more or less about
other things. Through one field mas
tered lie gets the lay of the land all
about him. It is the one way known
among men. John Kshleman, noble
man, —just now taken from us by an
all too early death, chose to spend

his graduate period at the University
in deepening his hold 011 the philoso
phy and Greek he had studied in his
undergraduate years, so that he might
somewhere have solid ground under
his feet. He never regretted it, far
the reverse; and surely no one who
knew how deep were the fountains at
which he drank, can believe he was
aught but the finer lawyer and states
man for the clioiee he made, short as
were his days.
Altitude Bather Than
Subject Counts.
The subject of study a man chooses
is of far less importance than the at
titude he learns to assume toward the
truth. With the shrewdest of fore
sight he can exercise, a man is very
likely to achieve his life-success in a
widely different field from that of his
expectation. But that is no ground
for disappointment; it is not even
certain that the shift involves waste.
It is not a man's outward equipment
that counts, but his character. The
subject of study is to be regarded as
little more than a certain healthy
food for a growing mental organism.
Feed well, keep clean, and let nature
do the rest.
Of more importance still than sub
ject or training is the competence to
transmute the form of learning into
the form of discovery. Toward stim
ulating this competency, in short
range or great, all higher training
must strive. Men who naturally dis
cover and who as carriers of infec
tion can in any form teach, must be
made to teach and not allowed to
isolate themselves in institutes, —for
fresh thinking is the very breath of
life to a university. A man who has
once in small or great exhausted all
that is known on a given matter and
having proceeded alone beyond the
outer picket line of the advance has
gained glimpse of new lands in new
relation to the old, has become there
by a changed man for all his life. A
new fever is in his blood. It is no
longer worth his while io borrow. Tie
has discovered.

Man rises to the highest there is
in him when he shakes himself free
from imitation, superstitution and con

volition and setting free mind above

world by re-thinking it."
The university is distinctly a social
body. It arose out of clubs and din
ing halls, it exists primarily today
us a body of scholars living together
and stimulating each other in work
and counsel. The education its stu
dents receive, so far as the typical
students are concerned, comes less by
books and prescriptions than by the
unseen influence of atmosphere and
the zest of environment and stand
ards. We deplore it when we hear
that parents send their sons and
daughters to certain colleges where
they may acquire fortunate social con
nections in point of caste and wealth,
or even that they are sent to New
England "at least long enough," so
the saying goes, "to take on their
broad a's," but this is after all only
| a passing perversion of the finer and
I nobler social meaning of the college.
Men .Must Learn to

This is a social world we have come
to live in and no matter what the field

"come up some other way like a thief
or a robber," via University Extension
and the Summer School.
It must too be confessed that in cer
tain externals we g've our uninitiated
public, even though it does not seem
much to mind it or resent it, some
reason to think that we are quite
busied with the maintenance of the
guild spirit. We nourish a weird rit
ual of bleachers, dervishes and oskies;
we cultivate all the forms of associa
tion; brotherhoods, alumni unions,
symbols, initiations and feasts for the
dead; we lay stress on matric
ulations and graduations and de
grees and decorate our plain
names with the feathers and
scalps of various alphabetic combina
tions: and like the Pharisees of old,
we make broad our phylacteries and
enlarge the borders of our garments.
There is indeed fair reason to pre
sume that when the sisters and the
uncles and the aunts come down for
Commencement and look dazedly on
at the mysteries, we are quite willing
they should be impressed that some
thing important is going on and has
been going on for these four costly
years, even though we might not al
ways be able to tell them just what
it is. And then there is that solemn
moment when the wto Roman augurs

What are Universities
Doing with Students?
This sounds all very terrible, but
at the worst it means no more than
that these thousands of students who
in hundreds of schools and colleges
are moving up to sure leadership
among their kind and toward help
fulness in society, are obtaining vari
ous equipment which we denominated
by the one term education, and are
obtaining it, all of them by aids and
processes which are abhorent to the
theories and prognostications of some
one or another of the educational au
thorities, —or are not supported by any
theory whatsoever or conceived of in
relation to any theory. Learning to
spell and absorbing the multiplica
tion table and developing a handwrit
ing were never in the good old times
recommended and enforced by refer
ence to any abstract considerations.
We just had to know that eight times
seven was fifty-six, for the very good
and competent reason that we had to.
The compelling power was not a body
]of psychological and biological con
siderations based on theory, but the
quickening power of the teacher ulti
mately based 011 love and muscle fibre.
Methods of Instruction
Based 011 Broad Beilections.
1
Nowadays our methods of instruc
tion are founded upon broad reflec
tions concerning the attitude which
ought to inspire the pupil when fac
ing the multiplication table. He must
not see it all at once, lest dismay lay
hold upon him. He must be encour
aged to entertain for it from the being
feelings of friendliness such as will
naturally lead toward a desire for fur
ther helpful acquaintanceship in the
future. A reasonable solicitude must
also be recognized lest there should
arise assigning exclusively to the num
ber fifty-six the resultant of the union
of seven and eight, and coupled with
the protest an ill concealed desire for
a somewhat larger liberty. The meth
od of earlier days, as I remember it,
involved a direct attempt to intrude
the multiplication table forcibly and
in large masses into the human throat
until these masses protruded consid
erably beyond the pupil's mouth.
The methods of those days were
harsher and more persistent than
those of today, but it can scarcely be
denied that multiplication and addition
were held to the firmer conventional
anchorage and that handwriting was
less likely to include the vertical and
both slopes in a single document.
We are Floundering in
Pedagogic Speculation.
What is true of elementary educa
tion is in its own way true of the uni
versitiy. We are floundering in peda
gogic speculation and expending in
theorizing regarding courses and
methods much good strength that is
sorely needed for consistent training,
the acquisitioh of accurate knowledge,
and the preparation to assume the
service of man in society.
In spite of the conflicting cries
which rise here and there from the
marketplace, it would seem there are
some plain things of simple observa
tion concerning which those who sit
in the porch might be esteemed to be
reasonably agreed. First there is the
importance of learning some one thing
well. The achievement of units bears
a very lax relation to getting an edu
cation. A congeries of two- and three
hour courses selected because of their
convenient time, their pleasant name,
and their charitable basis of credit
may yield a degree but will not, how
ever numerous, make mind, any more
than many moulds of jelly will build
a wall.
Students Must (Jo Dunn
To Firm Grounds.
Sooner or later the student must
learn the self-denying lesson that
there are many attractive propositions
in the Announcement of Courses which
he must lot go by, as there will be
afterwards in life. In doing one thing
well, he will learn more or less about
other things. Through one field mas
tered lie gets the lay of the land all
about him. It is the one way known
among men. John Kshleman, noble
man, —just now taken from us by an
all too early death, chose to spend

his graduate period at the University
in deepening his hold 011 the philoso
phy and Greek he had studied in his
undergraduate years, so that he might
somewhere have solid ground under
his feet. He never regretted it, far
the reverse; and surely no one who
knew how deep were the fountains at
which he drank, can believe he was
aught but the finer lawyer and states
man for the clioiee he made, short as
were his days.
Altitude Bather Than
Subject Counts.
The subject of study a man chooses
is of far less importance than the at
titude he learns to assume toward the
truth. With the shrewdest of fore
sight he can exercise, a man is very
likely to achieve his life-success in a
widely different field from that of his
expectation. But that is no ground
for disappointment; it is not even
certain that the shift involves waste.
It is not a man's outward equipment
that counts, but his character. The
subject of study is to be regarded as
little more than a certain healthy
food for a growing mental organism.
Feed well, keep clean, and let nature
do the rest.
Of more importance still than sub
ject or training is the competence to
transmute the form of learning into
the form of discovery. Toward stim
ulating this competency, in short
range or great, all higher training
must strive. Men who naturally dis
cover and who as carriers of infec
tion can in any form teach, must be
made to teach and not allowed to
isolate themselves in institutes, —for
fresh thinking is the very breath of
life to a university. A man who has
once in small or great exhausted all
that is known on a given matter and
having proceeded alone beyond the
outer picket line of the advance has
gained glimpse of new lands in new
relation to the old, has become there
by a changed man for all his life. A
new fever is in his blood. It is no
longer worth his while io borrow. Tie
has discovered.
He-disco*, er tlie World

Man rises to the highest there is
in him when he shakes himself free
from imitation, superstitution and con

volition and setting free mind above
the ruts of matter re-discovers his
world by re-thinking it."
The university is distinctly a social
body. It arose out of clubs and din
ing halls, it exists primarily today
us a body of scholars living together
and stimulating each other in work
and counsel. The education its stu
dents receive, so far as the typical
students are concerned, comes less by
books and prescriptions than by the
unseen influence of atmosphere and
the zest of environment and stand
ards. We deplore it when we hear
that parents send their sons and
daughters to certain colleges where
they may acquire fortunate social con
nections in point of caste and wealth,
or even that they are sent to New
England "at least long enough," so
the saying goes, "to take on their
broad a's," but this is after all only
| a passing perversion of the finer and
I nobler social meaning of the college.
Men .Must Learn to
Work With Men.
This is a social world we have come
to live in and no matter what the field
]of work we choose, our preparation
! for it must assume in first line the
social form. The day is already well
past when a man because he plans
to be an engineer can profitably judge
that he has only to deal with dyna
mos, pumps and wheels, and not with
men and motives. Engineers quite as
much as any profession will find they
have to adopt their lives and fitness
to the needs of men living in social
communities. Already the strong de
mand is rising all through the en
gineering world for men trained hi
commercial law, in ecomomics and
in the efficient use of English speech.
A University for Men

A university is a place where men

President Uenjamin hie Wheeler of
the University of California this morn

"To lielp find the way" was the way

The Founders
At Cornell.
At Cornell University, on a noon
day twenty-five years ago, I saw a
carriage drive rapidly away from the
house of Andrew D. White on its way
to the Ithaca station. In the carriage
were Senator and Mrs. Leland Stan
ford. They had paid a brief visit to
Di. White in order to gain his advice
regarding the educational organization
of Stanford University, and especially
regarding the man to make President.
So definite and convincing had been
the good doctor's nomination that their
visit was cut short to a few hours, a
luncheon party on which a number of us
in tiie faculty had counted for favor
able introduction was hastily annulled
and the visitors hurried away to tako
their train and set it en route for
Bloomington, Indiana. Within less
than two days, we heard of Dr. .Jor
dan's acceptance.

The loss of the luncheon and the
hurrying dust of those carriage wheels
left a very emphatic impression on
my mind. Even though I looked on
only from afar, [ could not fail to ap
preciate that something involving
great definiteness of intent was in the
making;—but only as the years pass
ed by did I come to know in full the
certitude ot purpose, which, inspired
by beneficent will and pledged in the
tenderest of human affections, ani
mated the action of that devoted pair
in those days five and twenty years
ago when the foundations of the Le
land Stanford Junior University first
were laid.
Founders Chose
Hiir Onriinizer.
bo far as their part was concerned
in what was to be done, they had no

hesitation, uncertainty or doubt. It
was their will and purpose to give to
the many foster-children of their love,
who in the years and centuries to
come should tread these halls, the
means of making their lives useful
and effective to the full. To this end
they provided endowment, buildings
and equipment, abundant beyond any
measure known hitherto; they chose,
to organize and lead the work of edu
cation, a man of largest mould, large
minded, generous, large-hearted be
ond the usual measure of men. Un
stintedly, unflinchingly, they did their
part. The rest they left to the gener
ations of scholarship and teachership,
and to them who, in the coming years,
shall have the gift of making men. As
to their part, they had no doubt; have
we as to our part? They determined
it that their foster-children down
through the generations should have
the privilege of a university educa
tion, they left the determination to the
teaching profession and their succes
sors in the trusteeship of the great
estate have done likewise.
Have We the Sarnie
Wide Vision?
They left this determination most
trustfully to our profession; I won
der it we, as a guild, are worthy of
the trust? Do we know ourselves
w bat a university is or are we really
much concerned to know? Or are we,
for example, more concerned to act
as special attorneys for the subjects
we severally teach and the depart
ments which represent them? Do we
use the bodies of learning which con
stitute our subjects for the upbuilding
of our students, or do we use our stu
dents for the glorifying of our sub
jects? Are we concerned to estimate
the social value of each of our vari
ous subjects within the body of the
whole, and assign to our students each
his mete indue season, or are we en
gaged in a line banditry to capture
and impound all we may? Are we not
floundering in the deep and rich
sloughs of theories and abstract con
tentions without building solid roads
of sound training toward definite
goals? Are we able to say from actual
experience which of our prescriptions
of studies will produce a certain re
quired result, other things being
equal? Can we confidently tell why
we prescribe calculus in one case and
English literature in another? Have
we noted in our experience the effect
of Greek in one case as against that
of metaphysics in another? We ha 'e
theories enough as to what ought ti
happen, but have we developed even
the outlines of an empiricism based
on stateable facts, which will guide
us confidently to a prescription for
a new case?
Public Expects Results
from Colleges.
And yet this public of ours expects
it of us, —not in every case and not
with equal trustfulness toward all of
us, but by and large they expect it of
us. They probably think we have
special knowledge on the subject de
rived from the oracles of our guild,
—knowledge which we do not reveal
except to the candidating neophytes
and on payment of a fee. It is the
same old story of the professional
monopoly all down the ages,—the law
yer with his phrase and seal; the
medicine man with his mysterious pre
scription, and his senatorial courtesy
toward the doctor first called in the
case: and the cleric with his formula
of escape from the pollution of sin
and the punishment eternal; —no mat
ter how they differed, all agreed in
the imposition of a fee; indeed unless
the fee is paid, the special knowledge
cannot be expected to go into effect.
The World Wonders
At College Rank.
It is remarkable how seldom our
public forces us to give account of the
values we attach to the long concate
nations of courses and curricula by
which we hold the patient candidates
aloof from their goals of degrees, and
build up the long Parnassan staircase
with many annual steps called grades
ripening toward the top into the
broad biennial grades called landings
where we let them take breath while
they asume a fresh title; matriculant,
certificated Junior, bachelor, master,
doctor. Meantime the gentle public
looks on, its gaze more than ever pre
occupied by the shifting colors of the
kaleidoscope, its mind more than ever
indisposed to exact an explanation of
conditions so elaborate, and its toler
ant heart more than ever unwilling to
interfere with the solemn Roman
augurs, who enthroned in the ancient
seat of augury on the hill proceed
with their interpretations of the flight
of birds.
-University Systems
Are Complicated.
So we go on laying down our sys
tems of prerequisites for this course
and that, building up our requirements
for this college and that school, inter
posing Subject A and Subject B with
calm confidence in the inexhaustibil
ity of the alphabet, and entrenching
our degrees behind barriers and en
tanglements past finding out except
to the Recorder or the Registrar.
All this is doubtless good, except
on the theory that the student him
self is an interested party and will
often wish to choose what is best for
him, as he is the one who suffers if
lie takes what is wrong for him; but
we are not here and now so much
concerned with what is doubtless good
or doubtless bad. We are rather con
cerned to note the fact that the pre
scriptions and requirements are made

and accepted without our being held
to strict account as to what symptoms
and results the prerequisites may be
expected to produce in the patient and
why,—as to whether the prerequisites
are really necessary or only a pleas
ant embellishment and why so, —as to
whether, for example, prerequisites
may not in large measure mean mere
ly relative immaturity in the pupil.
The World Has Confidence
111 Educators.
It certainly is a high compliment to
the teaching profession and a com
manding evidence of popular confi
dence that we are so seldom commend
ed or even asked to lay bare the mys
teries of our guild. The great un
initiated throng rests, it appears, in
■1 quiet asuranee that we know where
ve are going, though we do not tell;
and that we know the way, though
the chief evidence we publicly give
thereof may, to the world, seem to be
only a patient and steadfast continu
ity in the drawing of our salaries.
Most of us of the profession, if put
on the defensive, would stoutly deny
and deny with all candour that there
is any educational guild whatsoever,
still less any holy mysteries in the
keepership of a guild. We are sure
we have no sacred incantations where
with to expel the evil spirits of ig
norance, in spite of the courses in
pedagogy required for a teacher's cer
tificate; and we are sure we rely on
110 consecrated formulas and recipes
wherewith to equip the neophytes,
though with some of us the text-book
has become a Bible and our lectures
issue from the sear and yellow leaf
more than from our blood-red lives.
The indoctrination which proceeds by
the dictation of dead formulas is a
totally different thing from that in
spiration which springs direct from
life to life by the contagion of per
sonality.
Oppose Other Training
Than Collegiate.
We are quite sure furthermore that
we maintain no guild protecting a
monopoly or the outlines of one, and
yet we cannot help noting here and
there a touch of aversion among the
regular initiates as toward those who
"come up some other way like a thief
or a robber," via University Extension
and the Summer School.
It must too be confessed that in cer
tain externals we g've our uninitiated
public, even though it does not seem
much to mind it or resent it, some
reason to think that we are quite
busied with the maintenance of the
guild spirit. We nourish a weird rit
ual of bleachers, dervishes and oskies;
we cultivate all the forms of associa

symbols, initiations and feasts for the

ulations and graduations and de
grees and decorate our plain
names with the feathers and
scalps of various alphabetic combina
tions: and like the Pharisees of old,
we make broad our phylacteries and
enlarge the borders of our garments.

The loss of the luncheon and the
hurrying dust of those carriage wheels
left a very emphatic impression on
my mind. Even though I looked on
only from afar, [ could not fail to ap
preciate that something involving
great definiteness of intent was in the
making;—but only as the years pass
ed by did I come to know in full the
certitude ot purpose, which, inspired
by beneficent will and pledged in the
tenderest of human affections, ani
mated the action of that devoted pair
in those days five and twenty years
ago when the foundations of the Le
land Stanford Junior University first
were laid.
Founders Chose
Hiir Onriinizer.
bo far as their part was concerned
in what was to be done, they had no

hesitation, uncertainty or doubt. It
was their will and purpose to give to
the many foster-children of their love,
who in the years and centuries to
come should tread these halls, the
means of making their lives useful
and effective to the full. To this end
they provided endowment, buildings
and equipment, abundant beyond any
measure known hitherto; they chose,
to organize and lead the work of edu
cation, a man of largest mould, large
minded, generous, large-hearted be
ond the usual measure of men. Un
stintedly, unflinchingly, they did their
part. The rest they left to the gener
ations of scholarship and teachership,
and to them who, in the coming years,
shall have the gift of making men. As
to their part, they had no doubt; have
we as to our part? They determined
it that their foster-children down
through the generations should have
the privilege of a university educa
tion, they left the determination to the
teaching profession and their succes
sors in the trusteeship of the great
estate have done likewise.
Have We the Sarnie
Wide Vision?
They left this determination most
trustfully to our profession; I won
der it we, as a guild, are worthy of
the trust? Do we know ourselves
w bat a university is or are we really
much concerned to know? Or are we,
for example, more concerned to act
as special attorneys for the subjects
we severally teach and the depart
ments which represent them? Do we
use the bodies of learning which con
stitute our subjects for the upbuilding
of our students, or do we use our stu
dents for the glorifying of our sub
jects? Are we concerned to estimate
the social value of each of our vari
ous subjects within the body of the
whole, and assign to our students each
his mete indue season, or are we en
gaged in a line banditry to capture
and impound all we may? Are we not
floundering in the deep and rich
sloughs of theories and abstract con
tentions without building solid roads
of sound training toward definite
goals? Are we able to say from actual
experience which of our prescriptions
of studies will produce a certain re
quired result, other things being
equal? Can we confidently tell why
we prescribe calculus in one case and
English literature in another? Have
we noted in our experience the effect
of Greek in one case as against that
of metaphysics in another? We ha 'e
theories enough as to what ought ti
happen, but have we developed even
the outlines of an empiricism based
on stateable facts, which will guide
us confidently to a prescription for
a new case?
Public Expects Results
from Colleges.
And yet this public of ours expects
it of us, —not in every case and not
with equal trustfulness toward all of
us, but by and large they expect it of
us. They probably think we have
special knowledge on the subject de
rived from the oracles of our guild,
—knowledge which we do not reveal
except to the candidating neophytes
and on payment of a fee. It is the
same old story of the professional
monopoly all down the ages,—the law
yer with his phrase and seal; the
medicine man with his mysterious pre
scription, and his senatorial courtesy
toward the doctor first called in the
case: and the cleric with his formula
of escape from the pollution of sin
and the punishment eternal; —no mat
ter how they differed, all agreed in
the imposition of a fee; indeed unless
the fee is paid, the special knowledge
cannot be expected to go into effect.
The World Wonders
At College Rank.
It is remarkable how seldom our
public forces us to give account of the
values we attach to the long concate
nations of courses and curricula by
which we hold the patient candidates
aloof from their goals of degrees, and
build up the long Parnassan staircase
with many annual steps called grades
ripening toward the top into the
broad biennial grades called landings
where we let them take breath while
they asume a fresh title; matriculant,
certificated Junior, bachelor, master,
doctor. Meantime the gentle public
looks on, its gaze more than ever pre
occupied by the shifting colors of the
kaleidoscope, its mind more than ever
indisposed to exact an explanation of
conditions so elaborate, and its toler
ant heart more than ever unwilling to
interfere with the solemn Roman
augurs, who enthroned in the ancient
seat of augury on the hill proceed
with their interpretations of the flight
of birds.
-University Systems
Are Complicated.
So we go on laying down our sys
tems of prerequisites for this course
and that, building up our requirements
for this college and that school, inter
posing Subject A and Subject B with
calm confidence in the inexhaustibil
ity of the alphabet, and entrenching
our degrees behind barriers and en
tanglements past finding out except
to the Recorder or the Registrar.
All this is doubtless good, except
on the theory that the student him
self is an interested party and will
often wish to choose what is best for
him, as he is the one who suffers if
lie takes what is wrong for him; but
we are not here and now so much
concerned with what is doubtless good
or doubtless bad. We are rather con
cerned to note the fact that the pre
scriptions and requirements are made

and accepted without our being held
to strict account as to what symptoms
and results the prerequisites may be
expected to produce in the patient and
why,—as to whether the prerequisites
are really necessary or only a pleas
ant embellishment and why so, —as to
whether, for example, prerequisites
may not in large measure mean mere
ly relative immaturity in the pupil.
The World Has Confidence
111 Educators.
It certainly is a high compliment to
the teaching profession and a com
manding evidence of popular confi
dence that we are so seldom commend
ed or even asked to lay bare the mys
teries of our guild. The great un
initiated throng rests, it appears, in
■1 quiet asuranee that we know where
ve are going, though we do not tell;
and that we know the way, though
the chief evidence we publicly give
thereof may, to the world, seem to be
only a patient and steadfast continu
ity in the drawing of our salaries.
Most of us of the profession, if put
on the defensive, would stoutly deny
and deny with all candour that there
is any educational guild whatsoever,
still less any holy mysteries in the
keepership of a guild. We are sure
we have no sacred incantations where
with to expel the evil spirits of ig
norance, in spite of the courses in
pedagogy required for a teacher's cer
tificate; and we are sure we rely on
110 consecrated formulas and recipes
wherewith to equip the neophytes,
though with some of us the text-book
has become a Bible and our lectures
issue from the sear and yellow leaf
more than from our blood-red lives.
The indoctrination which proceeds by
the dictation of dead formulas is a
totally different thing from that in
spiration which springs direct from
life to life by the contagion of per
sonality.
Oppose Other Training
Than Collegiate.
We are quite sure furthermore that
we maintain no guild protecting a
monopoly or the outlines of one, and
yet we cannot help noting here and
there a touch of aversion among the
regular initiates as toward those who
"come up some other way like a thief
or a robber," via University Extension
and the Summer School.
It must too be confessed that in cer
tain externals we g've our uninitiated
public, even though it does not seem
much to mind it or resent it, some
reason to think that we are quite
busied with the maintenance of the
guild spirit. We nourish a weird rit
ual of bleachers, dervishes and oskies;
we cultivate all the forms of associa
tion; brotherhoods, alumni unions,
symbols, initiations and feasts for the
dead; we lay stress on matric
ulations and graduations and de
grees and decorate our plain
names with the feathers and
scalps of various alphabetic combina
tions: and like the Pharisees of old,
we make broad our phylacteries and
enlarge the borders of our garments.
There is indeed fair reason to pre
sume that when the sisters and the
uncles and the aunts come down for
Commencement and look dazedly on
at the mysteries, we are quite willing
they should be impressed that some
thing important is going on and has
been going on for these four costly
years, even though we might not al
ways be able to tell them just what
it is. And then there is that solemn
moment when the wto Roman augurs

What are Universities
Doing with Students?
This sounds all very terrible, but
at the worst it means no more than
that these thousands of students who
in hundreds of schools and colleges
are moving up to sure leadership
among their kind and toward help
fulness in society, are obtaining vari
ous equipment which we denominated
by the one term education, and are
obtaining it, all of them by aids and
processes which are abhorent to the
theories and prognostications of some
one or another of the educational au
thorities, —or are not supported by any
theory whatsoever or conceived of in
relation to any theory. Learning to
spell and absorbing the multiplica
tion table and developing a handwrit
ing were never in the good old times
recommended and enforced by refer
ence to any abstract considerations.
We just had to know that eight times
seven was fifty-six, for the very good
and competent reason that we had to.
The compelling power was not a body
]of psychological and biological con
siderations based on theory, but the
quickening power of the teacher ulti
mately based 011 love and muscle fibre.
Methods of Instruction
Based 011 Broad Beilections.
1
Nowadays our methods of instruc
tion are founded upon broad reflec
tions concerning the attitude which
ought to inspire the pupil when fac
ing the multiplication table. He must
not see it all at once, lest dismay lay
hold upon him. He must be encour
aged to entertain for it from the being
feelings of friendliness such as will
naturally lead toward a desire for fur
ther helpful acquaintanceship in the
future. A reasonable solicitude must
also be recognized lest there should
arise assigning exclusively to the num
ber fifty-six the resultant of the union
of seven and eight, and coupled with
the protest an ill concealed desire for
a somewhat larger liberty. The meth
od of earlier days, as I remember it,
involved a direct attempt to intrude
the multiplication table forcibly and
in large masses into the human throat
until these masses protruded consid
erably beyond the pupil's mouth.
The methods of those days were
harsher and more persistent than
those of today, but it can scarcely be
denied that multiplication and addition
were held to the firmer conventional
anchorage and that handwriting was
less likely to include the vertical and
both slopes in a single document.
We are Floundering in
Pedagogic Speculation.
What is true of elementary educa
tion is in its own way true of the uni
versitiy. We are floundering in peda
gogic speculation and expending in
theorizing regarding courses and
methods much good strength that is
sorely needed for consistent training,
the acquisitioh of accurate knowledge,
and the preparation to assume the
service of man in society.
In spite of the conflicting cries
which rise here and there from the
marketplace, it would seem there are
some plain things of simple observa
tion concerning which those who sit
in the porch might be esteemed to be
reasonably agreed. First there is the
importance of learning some one thing
well. The achievement of units bears
a very lax relation to getting an edu
cation. A congeries of two- and three
hour courses selected because of their
convenient time, their pleasant name,
and their charitable basis of credit
may yield a degree but will not, how
ever numerous, make mind, any more
than many moulds of jelly will build
a wall.
Students Must (Jo Dunn
To Firm Grounds.
Sooner or later the student must
learn the self-denying lesson that
there are many attractive propositions
in the Announcement of Courses which
he must lot go by, as there will be
afterwards in life. In doing one thing
well, he will learn more or less about
other things. Through one field mas
tered lie gets the lay of the land all
about him. It is the one way known
among men. John Kshleman, noble
man, —just now taken from us by an
all too early death, chose to spend

his graduate period at the University
in deepening his hold 011 the philoso
phy and Greek he had studied in his
undergraduate years, so that he might
somewhere have solid ground under
his feet. He never regretted it, far
the reverse; and surely no one who
knew how deep were the fountains at
which he drank, can believe he was
aught but the finer lawyer and states
man for the clioiee he made, short as
were his days.
Altitude Bather Than
Subject Counts.
The subject of study a man chooses
is of far less importance than the at
titude he learns to assume toward the
truth. With the shrewdest of fore
sight he can exercise, a man is very
likely to achieve his life-success in a
widely different field from that of his
expectation. But that is no ground
for disappointment; it is not even
certain that the shift involves waste.
It is not a man's outward equipment
that counts, but his character. The
subject of study is to be regarded as
little more than a certain healthy
food for a growing mental organism.
Feed well, keep clean, and let nature
do the rest.
Of more importance still than sub
ject or training is the competence to
transmute the form of learning into
the form of discovery. Toward stim
ulating this competency, in short
range or great, all higher training
must strive. Men who naturally dis
cover and who as carriers of infec
tion can in any form teach, must be
made to teach and not allowed to
isolate themselves in institutes, —for
fresh thinking is the very breath of
life to a university. A man who has
once in small or great exhausted all
that is known on a given matter and
having proceeded alone beyond the
outer picket line of the advance has
gained glimpse of new lands in new
relation to the old, has become there
by a changed man for all his life. A
new fever is in his blood. It is no
longer worth his while io borrow. Tie
has discovered.
He-disco*, er tlie World

Man rises to the highest there is
in him when he shakes himself free
from imitation, superstitution and con

volition and setting free mind above
the ruts of matter re-discovers his
world by re-thinking it."
The university is distinctly a social
body. It arose out of clubs and din
ing halls, it exists primarily today
us a body of scholars living together
and stimulating each other in work
and counsel. The education its stu
dents receive, so far as the typical
students are concerned, comes less by
books and prescriptions than by the
unseen influence of atmosphere and
the zest of environment and stand
ards. We deplore it when we hear
that parents send their sons and
daughters to certain colleges where
they may acquire fortunate social con
nections in point of caste and wealth,
or even that they are sent to New
England "at least long enough," so
the saying goes, "to take on their
broad a's," but this is after all only
| a passing perversion of the finer and
I nobler social meaning of the college.
Men .Must Learn to
Work With Men.
This is a social world we have come
to live in and no matter what the field
]of work we choose, our preparation
! for it must assume in first line the
social form. The day is already well
past when a man because he plans
to be an engineer can profitably judge
that he has only to deal with dyna
mos, pumps and wheels, and not with
men and motives. Engineers quite as
much as any profession will find they
have to adopt their lives and fitness
to the needs of men living in social
communities. Already the strong de
mand is rising all through the en
gineering world for men trained hi
commercial law, in ecomomics and
in the efficient use of English speech.
A University for Men
To Learn To Advance.
A university is a place where men
living together in the sharing of out
look and tasks may shape their lives
to social need by learning to under
stand one province where human
thought has leveled roads and by
helping find the further way.
If our walls are to but one

I toll what the university is for:
I TO HELP FIND TH£ WAY.
That learning to know and work
with men, as well as with theories,
laws, literature, and natural forces is
the business of the student in
the college was the theme of
President Uenjamin hie Wheeler of
the University of California this morn
ing at the Founders' Day Assembly.
"To lielp find the way" was the way
President Wheeler summarized at the
end of his speech the chief aim of
the university. According to Doc
tor Wheeler, the university has a
greater work than to merely train
men for their various professions.
The address follows:
The Founders
At Cornell.
At Cornell University, on a noon
day twenty-five years ago, I saw a
carriage drive rapidly away from the
house of Andrew D. White on its way
to the Ithaca station. In the carriage
were Senator and Mrs. Leland Stan
ford. They had paid a brief visit to
Di. White in order to gain his advice
regarding the educational organization
of Stanford University, and especially
regarding the man to make President.
So definite and convincing had been
the good doctor's nomination that their
visit was cut short to a few hours, a
luncheon party on which a number of us
in tiie faculty had counted for favor
able introduction was hastily annulled
and the visitors hurried away to tako
their train and set it en route for
Bloomington, Indiana. Within less
than two days, we heard of Dr. .Jor
dan's acceptance.

If our wtills ore to beur but one

thiye will he afterwards in life.

than the attitude he learns to assume

We are Floundering in
Pedagogic Speculation.
What is true of elementary educa
tion is in its own way true of the uni
versitiy. We are floundering in peda
gogic speculation and expending in
theorizing regarding courses and
methods much good strength that is
sorely needed for consistent training,
the acquisitioh of accurate knowledge,
and the preparation to assume the
service of man in society.
In spite of the conflicting cries
which rise here and there from the
marketplace, it would seem there are
some plain things of simple observa
tion concerning which those who sit
in the porch might be esteemed to be
reasonably agreed. First there is the
importance of learning some one thing
well. The achievement of units bears
a very lax relation to getting an edu
cation. A congeries of two- and three
hour courses selected because of their
convenient time, their pleasant name,
and their charitable basis of credit
may yield a degree but will not, how
ever numerous, make mind, any more
than many moulds of jelly will build
a wall.
Students Must (Jo Dunn
To Firm Grounds.
Sooner or later the student must
learn the self-denying lesson that
there are many attractive propositions
in the Announcement of Courses which
he must lot go by, as there will be
afterwards in life. In doing one thing
well, he will learn more or less about
other things. Through one field mas
tered lie gets the lay of the land all
about him. It is the one way known
among men. John Kshleman, noble
man, —just now taken from us by an
all too early death, chose to spend

his graduate period at the University
in deepening his hold 011 the philoso
phy and Greek he had studied in his
undergraduate years, so that he might
somewhere have solid ground under
his feet. He never regretted it, far
the reverse; and surely no one who
knew how deep were the fountains at
which he drank, can believe he was
aught but the finer lawyer and states
man for the clioiee he made, short as
were his days.
Altitude Bather Than
Subject Counts.
The subject of study a man chooses
is of far less importance than the at
titude he learns to assume toward the
truth. With the shrewdest of fore
sight he can exercise, a man is very
likely to achieve his life-success in a
widely different field from that of his
expectation. But that is no ground
for disappointment; it is not even
certain that the shift involves waste.
It is not a man's outward equipment
that counts, but his character. The
subject of study is to be regarded as
little more than a certain healthy
food for a growing mental organism.
Feed well, keep clean, and let nature
do the rest.
Of more importance still than sub
ject or training is the competence to
transmute the form of learning into
the form of discovery. Toward stim
ulating this competency, in short
range or great, all higher training
must strive. Men who naturally dis
cover and who as carriers of infec
tion can in any form teach, must be
made to teach and not allowed to
isolate themselves in institutes, —for
fresh thinking is the very breath of
life to a university. A man who has
once in small or great exhausted all
that is known on a given matter and
having proceeded alone beyond the
outer picket line of the advance has
gained glimpse of new lands in new
relation to the old, has become there
by a changed man for all his life. A
new fever is in his blood. It is no
longer worth his while io borrow. Tie

Man rises to the highest there is
in him when he shakes himself free
from imitation, superstitution and con

volition and setting free mind above
the ruts of matter re-discovers his
world by re-thinking it."
The university is distinctly a social
body. It arose out of clubs and din
ing halls, it exists primarily today
us a body of scholars living together
and stimulating each other in work
and counsel. The education its stu
dents receive, so far as the typical
students are concerned, comes less by
books and prescriptions than by the
unseen influence of atmosphere and
the zest of environment and stand
ards. We deplore it when we hear
that parents send their sons and
daughters to certain colleges where
they may acquire fortunate social con
nections in point of caste and wealth,
or even that they are sent to New
England "at least long enough," so
the saying goes, "to take on their
broad a's," but this is after all only
| a passing perversion of the finer and
I nobler social meaning of the college.
Men .Must Learn to
Work With Men.
This is a social world we have come
to live in and no matter what the field
]of work we choose, our preparation
! for it must assume in first line the
social form. The day is already well
past when a man because he plans
to be an engineer can profitably judge
that he has only to deal with dyna
mos, pumps and wheels, and not with
men and motives. Engineers quite as
much as any profession will find they
have to adopt their lives and fitness
to the needs of men living in social
communities. Already the strong de
mand is rising all through the en
gineering world for men trained hi
commercial law, in ecomomics and
in the efficient use of English speech.
A University for Men
To Learn To Advance.
A university is a place where men
living together in the sharing of out
look and tasks may shape their lives
to social need by learning to under
stand one province where human
thought has leveled roads and by
helping find the further way.
If our walls are to but one
inscription, let these five words stand

I toll what the university is for:
I TO HELP FIND TH£ WAY.
That learning to know and work
with men, as well as with theories,
laws, literature, and natural forces is
the business of the student in
the college was the theme of
President Uenjamin hie Wheeler of
the University of California this morn
ing at the Founders' Day Assembly.
"To lielp find the way" was the way
President Wheeler summarized at the
end of his speech the chief aim of
the university. According to Doc
tor Wheeler, the university has a
greater work than to merely train
men for their various professions.
The address follows:
The Founders
At Cornell.
At Cornell University, on a noon
day twenty-five years ago, I saw a
carriage drive rapidly away from the
house of Andrew D. White on its way
to the Ithaca station. In the carriage
were Senator and Mrs. Leland Stan
ford. They had paid a brief visit to
Di. White in order to gain his advice
regarding the educational organization
of Stanford University, and especially
regarding the man to make President.
So definite and convincing had been
the good doctor's nomination that their
visit was cut short to a few hours, a
luncheon party on which a number of us
in tiie faculty had counted for favor
able introduction was hastily annulled
and the visitors hurried away to tako
their train and set it en route for
Bloomington, Indiana. Within less
than two days, we heard of Dr. .Jor
dan's acceptance.

agressions of President Wheeler:
If our wtills ore to beur but one
inscription, let these five words tell
what the university is for —To help
find the way.
Sooner or later the student must
learn the self-denying lesson that
there are many attractive proposi
tions hi the Announcement of
t ourscs which lie must let go by, as
thiye will he afterwards in life.
the subject of study a man
chooses is of far less importance
than the attitude he learns to assume
toward the truth. With the shrewd
est a/ foresight he can exercise, a
man is very likely to achieve his
lire-success in a widely different field
from that of his expectations.
I he day is already well past when
a man, because he plans to be an en
gineer, can profitably judge that he
has only to deal with dynamos,
pumps, wheels, and not with men
and motives.
Man rises to the highest there is
in linn when he shakes himself free
from limitation, superstition and
convention, and setting free mind
above the ruts of matter, re-discov
, ers his world by re-thinking it.

The loss of the luncheon and the
hurrying dust of those carriage wheels
left a very emphatic impression on
my mind. Even though I looked on
only from afar, [ could not fail to ap
preciate that something involving
great definiteness of intent was in the
making;—but only as the years pass
ed by did I come to know in full the
certitude ot purpose, which, inspired
by beneficent will and pledged in the
tenderest of human affections, ani
mated the action of that devoted pair
in those days five and twenty years
ago when the foundations of the Le
land Stanford Junior University first
were laid.
Founders Chose
Hiir Onriinizer.
bo far as their part was concerned
in what was to be done, they had no

hesitation, uncertainty or doubt. It
was their will and purpose to give to
the many foster-children of their love,
who in the years and centuries to
come should tread these halls, the
means of making their lives useful
and effective to the full. To this end
they provided endowment, buildings
and equipment, abundant beyond any
measure known hitherto; they chose,
to organize and lead the work of edu
cation, a man of largest mould, large
minded, generous, large-hearted be
ond the usual measure of men. Un
stintedly, unflinchingly, they did their
part. The rest they left to the gener
ations of scholarship and teachership,
and to them who, in the coming years,
shall have the gift of making men. As
to their part, they had no doubt; have
we as to our part? They determined
it that their foster-children down
through the generations should have
the privilege of a university educa
tion, they left the determination to the
teaching profession and their succes
sors in the trusteeship of the great
estate have done likewise.
Have We the Sarnie
Wide Vision?
They left this determination most
trustfully to our profession; I won
der it we, as a guild, are worthy of
the trust? Do we know ourselves
w bat a university is or are we really
much concerned to know? Or are we,
for example, more concerned to act
as special attorneys for the subjects
we severally teach and the depart
ments which represent them? Do we
use the bodies of learning which con
stitute our subjects for the upbuilding
of our students, or do we use our stu
dents for the glorifying of our sub
jects? Are we concerned to estimate
the social value of each of our vari
ous subjects within the body of the
whole, and assign to our students each
his mete indue season, or are we en
gaged in a line banditry to capture
and impound all we may? Are we not
floundering in the deep and rich
sloughs of theories and abstract con
tentions without building solid roads
of sound training toward definite
goals? Are we able to say from actual
experience which of our prescriptions
of studies will produce a certain re
quired result, other things being
equal? Can we confidently tell why
we prescribe calculus in one case and
English literature in another? Have
we noted in our experience the effect
of Greek in one case as against that
of metaphysics in another? We ha 'e
theories enough as to what ought ti
happen, but have we developed even
the outlines of an empiricism based
on stateable facts, which will guide
us confidently to a prescription for
a new case?
Public Expects Results
from Colleges.
And yet this public of ours expects
it of us, —not in every case and not
with equal trustfulness toward all of
us, but by and large they expect it of
us. They probably think we have
special knowledge on the subject de
rived from the oracles of our guild,
—knowledge which we do not reveal
except to the candidating neophytes
and on payment of a fee. It is the
same old story of the professional
monopoly all down the ages,—the law
yer with his phrase and seal; the
medicine man with his mysterious pre
scription, and his senatorial courtesy
toward the doctor first called in the
case: and the cleric with his formula
of escape from the pollution of sin
and the punishment eternal; —no mat
ter how they differed, all agreed in
the imposition of a fee; indeed unless
the fee is paid, the special knowledge
cannot be expected to go into effect.
The World Wonders
At College Rank.
It is remarkable how seldom our
public forces us to give account of the
values we attach to the long concate
nations of courses and curricula by
which we hold the patient candidates
aloof from their goals of degrees, and
build up the long Parnassan staircase
with many annual steps called grades
ripening toward the top into the
broad biennial grades called landings
where we let them take breath while
they asume a fresh title; matriculant,
certificated Junior, bachelor, master,
doctor. Meantime the gentle public
looks on, its gaze more than ever pre
occupied by the shifting colors of the
kaleidoscope, its mind more than ever
indisposed to exact an explanation of
conditions so elaborate, and its toler
ant heart more than ever unwilling to
interfere with the solemn Roman
augurs, who enthroned in the ancient
seat of augury on the hill proceed
with their interpretations of the flight
of birds.
-University Systems
Are Complicated.
So we go on laying down our sys
tems of prerequisites for this course
and that, building up our requirements
for this college and that school, inter
posing Subject A and Subject B with
calm confidence in the inexhaustibil
ity of the alphabet, and entrenching
our degrees behind barriers and en
tanglements past finding out except
to the Recorder or the Registrar.
All this is doubtless good, except
on the theory that the student him
self is an interested party and will
often wish to choose what is best for
him, as he is the one who suffers if
lie takes what is wrong for him; but
we are not here and now so much
concerned with what is doubtless good
or doubtless bad. We are rather con
cerned to note the fact that the pre
scriptions and requirements are made

and accepted without our being held
to strict account as to what symptoms
and results the prerequisites may be
expected to produce in the patient and
why,—as to whether the prerequisites
are really necessary or only a pleas
ant embellishment and why so, —as to
whether, for example, prerequisites
may not in large measure mean mere
ly relative immaturity in the pupil.
The World Has Confidence
111 Educators.
It certainly is a high compliment to
the teaching profession and a com
manding evidence of popular confi
dence that we are so seldom commend
ed or even asked to lay bare the mys
teries of our guild. The great un
initiated throng rests, it appears, in
■1 quiet asuranee that we know where
ve are going, though we do not tell;
and that we know the way, though
the chief evidence we publicly give
thereof may, to the world, seem to be
only a patient and steadfast continu
ity in the drawing of our salaries.
Most of us of the profession, if put
on the defensive, would stoutly deny
and deny with all candour that there
is any educational guild whatsoever,
still less any holy mysteries in the
keepership of a guild. We are sure
we have no sacred incantations where
with to expel the evil spirits of ig
norance, in spite of the courses in
pedagogy required for a teacher's cer
tificate; and we are sure we rely on
110 consecrated formulas and recipes
wherewith to equip the neophytes,
though with some of us the text-book
has become a Bible and our lectures
issue from the sear and yellow leaf
more than from our blood-red lives.
The indoctrination which proceeds by
the dictation of dead formulas is a
totally different thing from that in
spiration which springs direct from
life to life by the contagion of per
sonality.
Oppose Other Training
Than Collegiate.
We are quite sure furthermore that
we maintain no guild protecting a
monopoly or the outlines of one, and
yet we cannot help noting here and
there a touch of aversion among the
regular initiates as toward those who
"come up some other way like a thief
or a robber," via University Extension
and the Summer School.
It must too be confessed that in cer
tain externals we g've our uninitiated
public, even though it does not seem
much to mind it or resent it, some
reason to think that we are quite
busied with the maintenance of the
guild spirit. We nourish a weird rit
ual of bleachers, dervishes and oskies;
we cultivate all the forms of associa
tion; brotherhoods, alumni unions,
symbols, initiations and feasts for the
dead; we lay stress on matric
ulations and graduations and de
grees and decorate our plain
names with the feathers and
scalps of various alphabetic combina
tions: and like the Pharisees of old,
we make broad our phylacteries and
enlarge the borders of our garments.
There is indeed fair reason to pre
sume that when the sisters and the
uncles and the aunts come down for
Commencement and look dazedly on
at the mysteries, we are quite willing
they should be impressed that some
thing important is going on and has
been going on for these four costly
years, even though we might not al
ways be able to tell them just what
it is. And then there is that solemn
moment when the wto Roman augurs
wink at each other
What are Universities
Doing with Students?
This sounds all very terrible, but
at the worst it means no more than
that these thousands of students who
in hundreds of schools and colleges
are moving up to sure leadership
among their kind and toward help
fulness in society, are obtaining vari
ous equipment which we denominated
by the one term education, and are
obtaining it, all of them by aids and
processes which are abhorent to the
theories and prognostications of some
one or another of the educational au
thorities, —or are not supported by any
theory whatsoever or conceived of in
relation to any theory. Learning to
spell and absorbing the multiplica
tion table and developing a handwrit
ing were never in the good old times
recommended and enforced by refer
ence to any abstract considerations.
We just had to know that eight times
seven was fifty-six, for the very good
and competent reason that we had to.
The compelling power was not a body
]of psychological and biological con
siderations based on theory, but the
quickening power of the teacher ulti
mately based 011 love and muscle fibre.
Methods of Instruction
Based 011 Broad Beilections.
1
Nowadays our methods of instruc
tion are founded upon broad reflec
tions concerning the attitude which
ought to inspire the pupil when fac
ing the multiplication table. He must
not see it all at once, lest dismay lay
hold upon him. He must be encour
aged to entertain for it from the being
feelings of friendliness such as will
naturally lead toward a desire for fur
ther helpful acquaintanceship in the
future. A reasonable solicitude must
also be recognized lest there should
arise assigning exclusively to the num
ber fifty-six the resultant of the union
of seven and eight, and coupled with
the protest an ill concealed desire for
a somewhat larger liberty. The meth
od of earlier days, as I remember it,
involved a direct attempt to intrude
the multiplication table forcibly and
in large masses into the human throat
until these masses protruded consid
erably beyond the pupil's mouth.
The methods of those days were
harsher and more persistent than
those of today, but it can scarcely be
denied that multiplication and addition
were held to the firmer conventional
anchorage and that handwriting was
less likely to include the vertical and
both slopes in a single document.
