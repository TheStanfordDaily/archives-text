# LEARN MORE THAN CLASS ROOM KNOWLEDGE ADVISES PRESIDENT WHEELER IN ADDRESS
## California's Executive in Founders' Day Speech Tells Stanford That Education Consists of Knowing Men as Well as Books and That Students Should Do More Than Merely Absorb Courses in University Curriculums 
### 
That learning to know and work
with men, as well as with theories,
laws, literature, and natural forces is
the business of the student in
the college was the theme of
President Uenjamin hie Wheeler of
the University of California this morn
ing at the Founders' Day Assembly.
"To lielp find the way" was the way
President Wheeler summarized at the
end of his speech the chief aim of
the university. According to Doc
tor Wheeler, the university has a
greater work than to merely train
men for their various professions.
The address follows:
The Founders
At Cornell.
At Cornell University, on a noon
day twenty-five years ago, I saw a
carriage drive rapidly away from the
house of Andrew D. White on its way
to the Ithaca station. In the carriage
were Senator and Mrs. Leland Stan
ford. They had paid a brief visit to
Di. White in order to gain his advice
regarding the educational organization
of Stanford University, and especially
regarding the man to make President.
So definite and convincing had been
the good doctor's nomination that their
visit was cut short to a few hours, a
luncheon party on which a number of us
in tiie faculty had counted for favor
able introduction was hastily annulled
and the visitors hurried away to tako
their train and set it en route for
Bloomington, Indiana. Within less
than two days, we heard of Dr. .Jor
dan's acceptance.

agressions of President Wheeler:
If our wtills ore to beur but one
inscription, let these five words tell
what the university is for —To help
find the way.
Sooner or later the student must
learn the self-denying lesson that
there are many attractive proposi
tions hi the Announcement of
t ourscs which lie must let go by, as
thiye will he afterwards in life.
the subject of study a man
chooses is of far less importance
than the attitude he learns to assume
toward the truth. With the shrewd
est a/ foresight he can exercise, a
man is very likely to achieve his
lire-success in a widely different field
from that of his expectations.
I he day is already well past when
a man, because he plans to be an en
gineer, can profitably judge that he
has only to deal with dynamos,
pumps, wheels, and not with men
and motives.
Man rises to the highest there is
in linn when he shakes himself free
from limitation, superstition and
convention, and setting free mind
above the ruts of matter, re-discov
, ers his world by re-thinking it.

The loss of the luncheon and the
hurrying dust of those carriage wheels
left a very emphatic impression on
my mind. Even though I looked on
only from afar, [ could not fail to ap
preciate that something involving
great definiteness of intent was in the
making;—but only as the years pass
ed by did I come to know in full the
certitude ot purpose, which, inspired
by beneficent will and pledged in the
tenderest of human affections, ani
mated the action of that devoted pair
in those days five and twenty years
ago when the foundations of the Le
land Stanford Junior University first
were laid.
Founders Chose
Hiir Onriinizer.
bo far as their part was concerned
in what was to be done, they had no

hesitation, uncertainty or doubt. It
was their will and purpose to give to
the many foster-children of their love,
who in the years and centuries to
come should tread these halls, the
means of making their lives useful
and effective to the full. To this end
they provided endowment, buildings
and equipment, abundant beyond any
measure known hitherto; they chose,
to organize and lead the work of edu
cation, a man of largest mould, large
minded, generous, large-hearted be
ond the usual measure of men. Un
stintedly, unflinchingly, they did their
part. The rest they left to the gener
ations of scholarship and teachership,
and to them who, in the coming years,
shall have the gift of making men. As
to their part, they had no doubt; have
we as to our part? They determined
it that their foster-children down
through the generations should have
the privilege of a university educa
tion, they left the determination to the
teaching profession and their succes
sors in the trusteeship of the great
estate have done likewise.
Have We the Sarnie
Wide Vision?
They left this determination most
trustfully to our profession; I won
der it we, as a guild, are worthy of
the trust? Do we know ourselves
w bat a university is or are we really
much concerned to know? Or are we,
for example, more concerned to act
as special attorneys for the subjects
we severally teach and the depart
ments which represent them? Do we
use the bodies of learning which con
stitute our subjects for the upbuilding
of our students, or do we use our stu
dents for the glorifying of our sub
jects? Are we concerned to estimate
the social value of each of our vari
ous subjects within the body of the
