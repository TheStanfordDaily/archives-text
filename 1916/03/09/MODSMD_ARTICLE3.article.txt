his sophomore play, in "Seven Days,"
last years' Senior farce, and in "Stop
Thief," of recent fame.
(Jeortfe R, Nettleton, Johns' business
partner, will be played by E. R. Mar
tin, '18, a new man in campus the-
atricals, who is regarded as a "find"
by Coach Matliieu. The part of

who played an important part in
"Seven Days."
J. F. Elden, '16, as the traveling
salesman, and P. V. It. Adams, '17,
the office boy, also have had previous
