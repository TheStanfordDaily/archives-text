# VARIED EVENTS MARK FOUNDERS' DAY CELEBRATION
## 
### 
Reverence for the two who gave all
, they possessed in wealth, energy, and
time, that future generations of stu
j dents might profit, took the serious
side this morning with President
Wheeler's address in the Assembly
Hall and Senior exercises at the
Mausoleum.
However, memories of Stanford's
founders need not always be as formal
las this morning's program, and a
gradual change in the nature of ac
tivities will result this afternoon, first
with the classical band concert in the
Inner Quad at two o'clock. The pro
gram will end early enough for the
; baseball fracas with Santa Clara.
Plans are to have the band accom
pany the gathering at the Inner Qua 1
to the diamond and to open the game
; with a rousing air.
Dinner at Six-Thirty.
This evening at six-thirty the big
j event of the day for alumni, students,
and faculty members will be the din
ner in the Women's Club House. Ac
cording to reports, the best of chickens
have been secured from the neighbor
ing country, and will be slowly rook
ing to a crisp brown in one of the
neighboring ovens this afternoon,
along with a host of other good edi
i hies, guaranteed to satisfy the most
j particular of appetities.
