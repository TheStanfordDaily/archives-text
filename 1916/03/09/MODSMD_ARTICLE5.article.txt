# VARIED EVENTS MARK FOUNDERS' DAY CELEBRATION
## 
### 
Reverence for the two who gave all
, they possessed in wealth, energy, and
time, that future generations of stu
j dents might profit, took the serious
side this morning with President
Wheeler's address in the Assembly
Hall and Senior exercises at the
Mausoleum.
However, memories of Stanford's
founders need not always be as formal
las this morning's program, and a
gradual change in the nature of ac
tivities will result this afternoon, first
with the classical band concert in the
Inner Quad at two o'clock. The pro
gram will end early enough for the
; baseball fracas with Santa Clara.
Plans are to have the band accom
pany the gathering at the Inner Qua 1
to the diamond and to open the game
; with a rousing air.
Dinner at Six-Thirty.
This evening at six-thirty the big
j event of the day for alumni, students,
and faculty members will be the din
ner in the Women's Club House. Ac
cording to reports, the best of chickens
have been secured from the neighbor
ing country, and will be slowly rook
ing to a crisp brown in one of the
neighboring ovens this afternoon,
along with a host of other good edi
i hies, guaranteed to satisfy the most
j particular of appetities.
Chancellor Jordan will preside at
the dinner with his usual style of con
genial and lively remarks. The other
speakers at the gathering will be Pres
ident Ray Lyman Wilbur, who will
tell how it feels to be Stanford's ex
ecutive on Founders' Day for the first
time, Vice-President John Maxson
Stillman, and Charles R. Lowers, '96.
President Wheeler of California will
not be at the dinner.
Dance Later in Cninii.
Following the dinner in the Club
House, the gathering will adjourn to
the Union, where music will furnish
its share toward making the danct
merry, and the re-union of old-timers
lively. Before the scene of festivities
is changed to the Union, however,
several secret and entertaining stunts
will be "pulled off" at the Club House.
Their nature is still well guarded.
During the dinner music will be fur
nished by Blumenthal's Orchestra,
which volunteered its services for the
occasion.
Success in making the 1916 Found
ers' Day a better one than ever is due
largely to the committees in charge
of events, from the Faculty Public
Exercises Committee at the head, of
which Professor G. J. Peirce is
chairman, to the general Found
ers' Bay Committee, consisting
of Miss Edith Mirrielees, '07,
Mrs. E. W. Smith, '02, Mrs. W. H.
Schockley, '98, Miss Eileen Everett,
'14, B. W. Crandall, '06, and O. H.
Castle, '14. Skull and Snakes has
helped as has a committee of San
Francisco Alumni boosters.
