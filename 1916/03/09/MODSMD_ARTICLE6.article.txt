# HOMAGE PAID MEMORY OF THE FOUNDERS
## CALIFORNIA JOINS CARDINAL Birthday of Senator Stanford Honored by President of State University 
### 
Another Founders' Day is here.
Another tribute has been paid to those
who «ave much that Stanford might
exist, and suffered much that it might
not die. Whatever the feelings of the
Stanford people who gathered in the
Assembly Hall this morning, surely
that of homage was uppermost—
homage to the founders, mingled with
a great pride in the University which
they gave. The Blue and Gold, too,
Paid tribute, and the strains of Cali
fornia's hymn blended with those of
"Hail, Stanford, Hail," in memory of
the Stanford family. President
Wheeler left nothing of praise unsaid
in his address, a masterly acknowl
edgement of the Founders' generosity
and steadfastness of purpose.
Chancellor Jordan, in his introduc
tory remarks, explained the signific
ance of Founders' Day, and told why
Senator Stanford's birthday was
chosen as the date of the celebra
tion. "We once had two days to cele
brate," he said, "the birthdays of Sen
ator Stanford and Leland, Jr., but at
the request of Mrs. Stanford, these
celebrations were merged into one,
and March 9 was chosen in preference
to May 14, which comes very close
to our Commencement Day exercises.
Mrs. Stanford, with characteristic
modesty, was always glad that her
birthday came in August, when the
University is closed."
Following President Wheeler's ad
dress, the audience sang "Hail, Stan
ford, Hail!" and remained standing
while the seniors filed out on their
way to the Mausoleum. Here the
Flower committee, Miss Alice Butcher
and A. S. Hayes, placed tribute on
the Tomb of the Founders.
