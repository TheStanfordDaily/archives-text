# CRISIS AFTER FOUNDER'S DEATH
## Chancellor Recounts Threatening Suit of thek Government 
### 
Leiand Stanford, .Jr., born in Sacra
mento in 1 S(!9, passed away in Flor
ence. Italy, in 1884. That very year,
the idea of a university to his memory
was conceived by Senator and Mrs.
Stanford. On May 14, 1887 the corner
stone was laid, and on October 1, 1891,
the formal opening took place.
Crisis Follows Dentil
Of Founder.
Senator Stanford's death on June
21, 189H, was the beginning of a six
year period that proved the great
crisis of the University's existence.
The fate and the future of Stanford
hung in the balance. Out the love of
Mrs. Stanford and her untiring sacri
fices carried the memorial to her son
beyond the danger point.
After the founder's death, the estate
fell into the hands of the courts.
With the will in probate and the debts
of the estate to be paid, came the
panic of 1898. University affairs were
brought to a halt. Salaries could not
be paid. All business incomes ceased.
Stanford >Vitli
Faculty of Servants!
The only money available was
granted by the courts to pay "house
hold servants." The faculty then be
came Mrs. Stanford's household ser
vants,â€”for such they were in the eyes
of the law. Then came the most try
ing period. Mrs. Stanford gave her
ill for the sake of the University, sell

ing her jewels and making every sacri
fice so that Stanford's door could re
main open. This was the period of
the government suit. Chancellor Jor
dan has written the story of this liti
gation for The Daily Palo Alto.

Leland Stanford, with Mark Hop
kins, Collis P. Huntington, and
Charles Crocker formed the group of
Sacramento busines men who organ
ized the Central Pacific railroad which
j with the Union Pacific formed the first
transcontinental line between Omaha
and the west. The financing of these
enterprises was made possible by a
loan from the government and by the
gift of alternate townships. After
many vicissitudes, suffering from
blackmail and distrust, and paying
most exorbitant rates for borrowed
| money, the enterprise was wholly suc
| cessful.
Out of the profits of the Central
Pacific, the same men undertook the
Southern Pacific with its many rami
fications.
