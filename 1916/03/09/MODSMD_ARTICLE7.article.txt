# CRISIS AFTER FOUNDER'S DEATH
## Chancellor Recounts Threatening Suit of thek Government 
### 
Leiand Stanford, .Jr., born in Sacra

ence. Italy, in 1884. That very year,
the idea of a university to his memory
was conceived by Senator and Mrs.

Crisis Follows Dentil
Of Founder.
Senator Stanford's death on June
21, 189H, was the beginning of a six
year period that proved the great
crisis of the University's existence.
The fate and the future of Stanford
hung in the balance. Out the love of
Mrs. Stanford and her untiring sacri
fices carried the memorial to her son
beyond the danger point.
After the founder's death, the estate
fell into the hands of the courts.
With the will in probate and the debts
of the estate to be paid, came the
panic of 1898. University affairs were
brought to a halt. Salaries could not
be paid. All business incomes ceased.

The only money available was
granted by the courts to pay "house

came Mrs. Stanford's household ser

ill for the sake of the University, sell

ing her jewels and making every sacri
fice so that Stanford's door could re

the government suit. Chancellor Jor

Leland Stanford, with Mark Hop
kins, Collis P. Huntington, and
Charles Crocker formed the group of
Sacramento busines men who organ
ized the Central Pacific railroad which
j with the Union Pacific formed the first
transcontinental line between Omaha
and the west. The financing of these
enterprises was made possible by a
loan from the government and by the
gift of alternate townships. After
many vicissitudes, suffering from
blackmail and distrust, and paying
most exorbitant rates for borrowed
| money, the enterprise was wholly suc
| cessful.
Out of the profits of the Central
Pacific, the same men undertook the
Southern Pacific with its many rami
fications.
One-fourth of S. I*.
Vs Fndownicnt.
The foundation of Stanford Univer
sity rested on the one-fourth interest
!in this railway system, which Mrs.
! Stanford had pledged her husband to
deliver to the University as its en
dowment. Hut after the death of Mr.
Stanford in 1893, a long period of set
tlement prevented her from accom
plishing her purpose.
Litigation Brings
Giant Struggle.
This was followed by a longer period
of litigation which became for the
University a life and death struggle.
The United States Government
brought suit for fifteen millions for
the purpose of tying up the whole
Stanford estate until the debts of the
Central Pacific Railway to the Govern
ment should be paid. This was in
panic times when the whole estate
was estimated at about seventeen mil
lions, from which some millions of
debt remained to be paid.
Itaihvay Borrowed
Sixty .Million.
It was not claimed that the Univer
sity owed anything or that the Stan
lord estate owed anything, or that
the railway owed anything on which
payment was due. The railway had,
in its inception borrowed $00,000,000
from the Government on a second
mortgage, neither the first nor the
second mortgage being at that time
due.
Central I'acilic
I'aiil In Full.
As a matter of fact, the Central Pa
cific company paid in full every dollar
it owed as soon as it became due and
with full interest.
There was never any reason to sup
pose that it would not do so, and no
reason to suppose it could afford not
to pay this debt, for the power to
control the line from Ogden to San
Francisco, the shortest line possible,
was in itself a tremendous asset.
Failure to pay would have drawn the
keystone from the arch in one of the
greatest of railway systems.
Hut it was insisted that the railway
would be sold to satisfy the first mort
gage, leaving for the Government, as

Mr. Huntington expressed it, "two
streaks of rust and the right of way."
And therefore, the Government, by
a sort of injunction proposed to seize
the Stanford property, to be applied
to the railway debt, if the Central Pa
cific should at some future time fail
to pay. For this suit, there was no
warrant in law or in good policy. Bat
railway councils were divided and
Mrs. Stanford had to fight the suit
alone and at the cost of the estate.
The details of the Government claim
I need not repeat here. 1 have ex
plained them in a little book, "The
Story of a Good Woman," which every
Stanford student ought to read, for
the value of the story, not of the au
thor.
Favorable Verdict
1m Appealed.
The case was brought to trial be
fore tlie United States District Court
and Judge Ross decided against the
Government. It was appealed, and
Judges Morrow, Gilbert and Hawley
confirmed the decision of Judge Ross,
it was again appealed to the United
States Supreme Court. This court
moves slowly and the life blood of the
University was ebbing fast. It takes
money to carry on Stanford, and we
had not much, and few outside friends
could be counted on to help.
Estate Finally
Freed by Court.
Finally Mrs. Stanford went to Wash
ington and laid the case before Presi
dent Cleveland, asking only for a
speedy settlement. Through his in
fluence the case was moved up on the
calendar for an immediate trial.
By a unanimous decision, written
by Justice Harlan, Stanford Univer
sity was finally free. This was in
189G. It took three years more to pay
off the accumulated debts and lega
cies, and to throw wide the doors of
the University towards its larger fu
ture.

Leland Stanford, with Mark Hop
kins, Collis P. Huntington, and
Charles Crocker formed the group of
Sacramento busines men who organ
ized the Central Pacific railroad which
j with the Union Pacific formed the first
transcontinental line between Omaha
and the west. The financing of these
enterprises was made possible by a
loan from the government and by the
gift of alternate townships. After
many vicissitudes, suffering from
blackmail and distrust, and paying
most exorbitant rates for borrowed
| money, the enterprise was wholly suc
| cessful.
Out of the profits of the Central
Pacific, the same men undertook the
Southern Pacific with its many rami
fications.
One-fourth of S. I*.
Vs Fndownicnt.
The foundation of Stanford Univer
sity rested on the one-fourth interest
!in this railway system, which Mrs.
! Stanford had pledged her husband to
deliver to the University as its en
dowment. Hut after the death of Mr.
Stanford in 1893, a long period of set
tlement prevented her from accom
plishing her purpose.
Litigation Brings
Giant Struggle.
This was followed by a longer period
of litigation which became for the
University a life and death struggle.
The United States Government
brought suit for fifteen millions for
the purpose of tying up the whole
Stanford estate until the debts of the
Central Pacific Railway to the Govern
ment should be paid. This was in
panic times when the whole estate
was estimated at about seventeen mil
lions, from which some millions of
debt remained to be paid.
Itaihvay Borrowed
Sixty .Million.
It was not claimed that the Univer
sity owed anything or that the Stan
lord estate owed anything, or that
the railway owed anything on which
payment was due. The railway had,
in its inception borrowed $00,000,000
from the Government on a second
mortgage, neither the first nor the
second mortgage being at that time
due.
Central I'acilic
I'aiil In Full.
As a matter of fact, the Central Pa
cific company paid in full every dollar
it owed as soon as it became due and
with full interest.
There was never any reason to sup
pose that it would not do so, and no
reason to suppose it could afford not
to pay this debt, for the power to
control the line from Ogden to San
Francisco, the shortest line possible,
was in itself a tremendous asset.
Failure to pay would have drawn the
keystone from the arch in one of the
greatest of railway systems.
Hut it was insisted that the railway
would be sold to satisfy the first mort
gage, leaving for the Government, as

Mr. Huntington expressed it, "two
streaks of rust and the right of way."
And therefore, the Government, by
a sort of injunction proposed to seize
the Stanford property, to be applied
to the railway debt, if the Central Pa
cific should at some future time fail
to pay. For this suit, there was no
warrant in law or in good policy. Bat
railway councils were divided and
Mrs. Stanford had to fight the suit
alone and at the cost of the estate.
The details of the Government claim
I need not repeat here. 1 have ex
plained them in a little book, "The
Story of a Good Woman," which every
Stanford student ought to read, for
the value of the story, not of the au
thor.
Favorable Verdict

The case was brought to trial be
fore tlie United States District Court
and Judge Ross decided against the
Government. It was appealed, and
Judges Morrow, Gilbert and Hawley
confirmed the decision of Judge Ross,
it was again appealed to the United
States Supreme Court. This court
moves slowly and the life blood of the
University was ebbing fast. It takes
money to carry on Stanford, and we
had not much, and few outside friends
could be counted on to help.
Estate Finally
Freed by Court.
Finally Mrs. Stanford went to Wash
ington and laid the case before Presi
dent Cleveland, asking only for a
speedy settlement. Through his in
fluence the case was moved up on the
calendar for an immediate trial.
By a unanimous decision, written
by Justice Harlan, Stanford Univer
sity was finally free. This was in
189G. It took three years more to pay
off the accumulated debts and lega
cies, and to throw wide the doors of
the University towards its larger fu
ture.
Leiand Stanford, .Jr., born in Sacra
mento in 1 S(!9, passed away in Flor
ence. Italy, in 1884. That very year,
the idea of a university to his memory
was conceived by Senator and Mrs.
Stanford. On May 14, 1887 the corner

sity rested on the one-fourth interest
!in this railway system, which Mrs.
! Stanford had pledged her husband to
deliver to the University as its en
dowment. Hut after the death of Mr.
Stanford in 1893, a long period of set
tlement prevented her from accom
plishing her purpose.
Litigation Brings
Giant Struggle.
This was followed by a longer period
of litigation which became for the
University a life and death struggle.
The United States Government
brought suit for fifteen millions for
the purpose of tying up the whole
Stanford estate until the debts of the
Central Pacific Railway to the Govern
ment should be paid. This was in
panic times when the whole estate
was estimated at about seventeen mil
lions, from which some millions of
debt remained to be paid.
Itaihvay Borrowed
Sixty .Million.
It was not claimed that the Univer
sity owed anything or that the Stan
lord estate owed anything, or that
the railway owed anything on which
payment was due. The railway had,
in its inception borrowed $00,000,000
from the Government on a second
mortgage, neither the first nor the
second mortgage being at that time
due.
Central I'acilic
I'aiil In Full.
As a matter of fact, the Central Pa
cific company paid in full every dollar
it owed as soon as it became due and
with full interest.
There was never any reason to sup
pose that it would not do so, and no
reason to suppose it could afford not
to pay this debt, for the power to
control the line from Ogden to San
Francisco, the shortest line possible,
was in itself a tremendous asset.
Failure to pay would have drawn the
keystone from the arch in one of the
greatest of railway systems.
Hut it was insisted that the railway
would be sold to satisfy the first mort
gage, leaving for the Government, as

Mr. Huntington expressed it, "two
streaks of rust and the right of way."
And therefore, the Government, by
a sort of injunction proposed to seize
the Stanford property, to be applied
to the railway debt, if the Central Pa
cific should at some future time fail
to pay. For this suit, there was no
warrant in law or in good policy. Bat
railway councils were divided and
Mrs. Stanford had to fight the suit
alone and at the cost of the estate.
The details of the Government claim
I need not repeat here. 1 have ex
plained them in a little book, "The
Story of a Good Woman," which every
Stanford student ought to read, for
the value of the story, not of the au
thor.
Favorable Verdict
1m Appealed.
The case was brought to trial be
fore tlie United States District Court
and Judge Ross decided against the
Government. It was appealed, and
Judges Morrow, Gilbert and Hawley
confirmed the decision of Judge Ross,
it was again appealed to the United
States Supreme Court. This court
moves slowly and the life blood of the
University was ebbing fast. It takes
money to carry on Stanford, and we
had not much, and few outside friends
could be counted on to help.
Estate Finally
Freed by Court.
Finally Mrs. Stanford went to Wash
ington and laid the case before Presi
dent Cleveland, asking only for a
speedy settlement. Through his in
fluence the case was moved up on the
calendar for an immediate trial.
By a unanimous decision, written
by Justice Harlan, Stanford Univer
sity was finally free. This was in
189G. It took three years more to pay
off the accumulated debts and lega
cies, and to throw wide the doors of
the University towards its larger fu
ture.
Leiand Stanford, .Jr., born in Sacra
mento in 1 S(!9, passed away in Flor
ence. Italy, in 1884. That very year,
the idea of a university to his memory
was conceived by Senator and Mrs.
Stanford. On May 14, 1887 the corner
stone was laid, and on October 1, 1891,
the formal opening took place.
Crisis Follows Dentil
Of Founder.
Senator Stanford's death on June
21, 189H, was the beginning of a six
year period that proved the great
crisis of the University's existence.
The fate and the future of Stanford
hung in the balance. Out the love of
Mrs. Stanford and her untiring sacri
fices carried the memorial to her son
beyond the danger point.
After the founder's death, the estate
fell into the hands of the courts.
With the will in probate and the debts
of the estate to be paid, came the
panic of 1898. University affairs were
brought to a halt. Salaries could not
be paid. All business incomes ceased.
Stanford >Vitli
Faculty of Servants!
The only money available was
granted by the courts to pay "house
hold servants." The faculty then be
came Mrs. Stanford's household ser
vants,—for such they were in the eyes
of the law. Then came the most try
ing period. Mrs. Stanford gave her
ill for the sake of the University, sell

ing her jewels and making every sacri
fice so that Stanford's door could re
main open. This was the period of
the government suit. Chancellor Jor
dan has written the story of this liti
