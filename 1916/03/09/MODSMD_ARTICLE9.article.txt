This University was founded on love
in a sense which is true of no other.
Its cornerstone was love —love of a
boy extended to the love of the chil
dren of humanity. It was continued
through love—the love of a noble wo
man for her husband; the faith of
both in love's ideals —and as an em
bodiment of the power of love, Stan
ford University stands today.
It is fitting that these sentiments
should not stand as mere words. I
wish that in your hearts they may be
realities. Not many of you as students
have seen Mrs. Stanford. * * * None
of you have known Leland Stanford,
broad-minded, stout-hearted, kindly
and full of hope, a man of action
ripened into a philosopher. Our Uni
versity lias now reached its eighteenth
year. During the first two years of
its history, it was the hopeful experi
ment of Leland Stanford. The next
six years its story is that of the heart
throbs of .Tane Lathrop Stanford, and
the years following with all their vi
cissitudes, have been years of calm
ness and certitude, for the final out
come is no longer in question.
—David Starr Jordan,
1909 Founders' Day Address.
