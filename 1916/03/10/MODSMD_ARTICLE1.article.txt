# SANTA CLARA DEFEATS STANFORD VARSITY IN SLUGFEST
## HOLIDAY GAME DRAWS CROWD 10 to 7 Win Evens Up Annual Series Between Rival Baseball Teams 
### 
Santa Clara banged out a well
earned victory in the second game of
the 1916 baseball series between that
University and Stanford, yesterday
afternoon, on the varsity diamond, the
final score standing 10 to 7 in favor
of the visiting nine. it was loose
baseball, although marked by com
paratively few errors for such a score.
Heavy slugging on both sides sent the
number of bits soaring to fourteen
each, while excellent fielding cut off
sure tallies. Although in hot water
most of the time, Umpire Jack Mc-
Carthy handled the indicator in a
creditable manner, giving evidence of
his absolute authority on the diamond
in the fifth inning, when he sent Cap
tain Sheehan of the Santa Clara team
to the clubhouse for his consistent
"crabbing."
Holiday Draws Crowd.
The holiday attraction drew a large
crowd, the bleachers being well filled.
Splendid rooting, accompanied by the
Stanford Hand, gave the contest a
Big Game appearance, putting the
never beaten spirit into the players.
Santa Clara started out like a win
ner, copping off one run in the first
frame on three singles and a walk. It |
was not until the third inning that
they really got to Gus Hoever, who
was on the mound for the locals.
With one down, Hensberg started a
slugging bee that ended only after
Ave scores had been chalked up, and
Hoever retired in favor of Wicker
sham, who stemmed the tide some
what. Bensberg, Sheehan, Raftis,
Emerson, and Mulliolland came across
the platter on six clean bingles and
an erorr.
Stanford Kaliies In Eighth.
Stanford looked completely out
classed during the first stages of the
game. In the second frame, Sanborn
came across on Stevens' double. This
was the only Cardinal score until the
eighth inning, when, like a bolt out
of a clear sky, the home contingent
took to the offerings of Leonard,
banged the pill all over the lot, and
before the inning was over, six runs
had been registered. This was the
last of Leonard, Mickey replacing him
on the mound for Santa Clara.
Series Is Now Tie.
The games now stand one each for
the two rival institutions. The rub
ber will be played off within two
weeks, the place not being settled at
the present time. Both teams have
shown the power of winning through
hitting, the game at Santa Clara going
to the Cardinal by a 10 to 8 score,
while yesterday's battle ending in a
10 to 7 score, was clearly a slug fest.

Santa Clara banged out a well
earned victory in the second game of
the 1916 baseball series between that
University and Stanford, yesterday
afternoon, on the varsity diamond, the
final score standing 10 to 7 in favor
of the visiting nine. it was loose
baseball, although marked by com
paratively few errors for such a score.
Heavy slugging on both sides sent the
number of bits soaring to fourteen
each, while excellent fielding cut off
sure tallies. Although in hot water
most of the time, Umpire Jack Mc-
Carthy handled the indicator in a
creditable manner, giving evidence of
his absolute authority on the diamond
in the fifth inning, when he sent Cap
tain Sheehan of the Santa Clara team
to the clubhouse for his consistent
"crabbing."
Holiday Draws Crowd.
The holiday attraction drew a large
crowd, the bleachers being well filled.
Splendid rooting, accompanied by the
Stanford Hand, gave the contest a
Big Game appearance, putting the
never beaten spirit into the players.
Santa Clara started out like a win
ner, copping off one run in the first
frame on three singles and a walk. It |
was not until the third inning that
they really got to Gus Hoever, who
was on the mound for the locals.
With one down, Hensberg started a
slugging bee that ended only after
Ave scores had been chalked up, and
Hoever retired in favor of Wicker
sham, who stemmed the tide some
what. Bensberg, Sheehan, Raftis,
Emerson, and Mulliolland came across
the platter on six clean bingles and
an erorr.
Stanford Kaliies In Eighth.
Stanford looked completely out
classed during the first stages of the
game. In the second frame, Sanborn
came across on Stevens' double. This
was the only Cardinal score until the
eighth inning, when, like a bolt out
of a clear sky, the home contingent
took to the offerings of Leonard,
banged the pill all over the lot, and
before the inning was over, six runs
had been registered. This was the
last of Leonard, Mickey replacing him
on the mound for Santa Clara.
Series Is Now Tie.
The games now stand one each for
the two rival institutions. The rub
ber will be played off within two
weeks, the place not being settled at
the present time. Both teams have
shown the power of winning through
hitting, the game at Santa Clara going
to the Cardinal by a 10 to 8 score,
while yesterday's battle ending in a
10 to 7 score, was clearly a slug fest.

afternoon, on the varsity diamond, the
final score standing 10 to 7 in favor
of the visiting nine. it was loose
baseball, although marked by com
paratively few errors for such a score.
Heavy slugging on both sides sent the
number of bits soaring to fourteen
each, while excellent fielding cut off
sure tallies. Although in hot water
most of the time, Umpire Jack Mc-
Carthy handled the indicator in a
creditable manner, giving evidence of
his absolute authority on the diamond
in the fifth inning, when he sent Cap
tain Sheehan of the Santa Clara team
to the clubhouse for his consistent
"crabbing."
Holiday Draws Crowd.
The holiday attraction drew a large
crowd, the bleachers being well filled.
Splendid rooting, accompanied by the
Stanford Hand, gave the contest a
Big Game appearance, putting the
never beaten spirit into the players.
Santa Clara started out like a win
ner, copping off one run in the first
frame on three singles and a walk. It |
was not until the third inning that
they really got to Gus Hoever, who
was on the mound for the locals.
With one down, Hensberg started a
slugging bee that ended only after
Ave scores had been chalked up, and
Hoever retired in favor of Wicker
sham, who stemmed the tide some
what. Bensberg, Sheehan, Raftis,
Emerson, and Mulliolland came across
the platter on six clean bingles and
an erorr.
Stanford Kaliies In Eighth.
Stanford looked completely out
classed during the first stages of the
game. In the second frame, Sanborn
came across on Stevens' double. This
was the only Cardinal score until the
eighth inning, when, like a bolt out
of a clear sky, the home contingent
took to the offerings of Leonard,
banged the pill all over the lot, and
before the inning was over, six runs
had been registered. This was the
last of Leonard, Mickey replacing him
on the mound for Santa Clara.
Series Is Now Tie.
The games now stand one each for
the two rival institutions. The rub
ber will be played off within two
weeks, the place not being settled at
the present time. Both teams have
shown the power of winning through
hitting, the game at Santa Clara going
to the Cardinal by a 10 to 8 score,
while yesterday's battle ending in a
10 to 7 score, was clearly a slug fest.
