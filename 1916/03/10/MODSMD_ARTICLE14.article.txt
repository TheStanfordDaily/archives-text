# SOCCER ELEVENS CLASH FOR THE LATHROP TROPHY
## 
### 
Intercollegiate soccer will he staged
for the second time this season when
the Stanford and California elevens
clash on the Berkeley turf tomorrow
afternoon. This game carries with it
the determining struggle for the pos
session of the Lathrop Trophy during
the ensuing year, and in the event
that Stanford wins, will be the last
game in the Exposition series. Should
California win the two universities
will he tied for iirst place, thereby
necessitating the playing of a third
and deciding game. The first game of
this year's series was played here at
Stanford on Washington's Birthday,
and was annexed by the Cardinal with
a 3 to 0 score.
A feature of Saturday's playing will
be a battle waged between two juv
enile teams from the Palo Alto and
Oakland grammar schools. Their
game was slated to immediately pre
cede that of the varsity, but the
change in the time of the latter will
shift the boys' contest to 10 o'clock
in the morning.
The Blue and CJold lineup for to
morrow's game shows three veteran
players of the round ball game who
were ineligible last month. The one
sided score piled up by the Cardinal
on Washington's Birthday was due
more to hard luck on the part of the
California forwards than to their in
ferior playing, ami this fact, together
with the added strength of their team
will undoubtedly enable them to give
the local soccerites a hard run.
Positions played by the Stanford
contingent remain the same as in the
former games with the exception of
Warren, who has moved into left half,
and Roney, who will hold down the
right full berth. Although California
is expected to put up a strong game,
there has also been a remarkable im
provement in the Stanford squad, and
a hard fight is predicted from start to
finish.
Stanford's lineup follows: Ring,
center; Roney, right full; Reynolds,
left full; Williams, right half; Boyle,
center half; Warren, left half; Mac-
Mahon, outside right; Carroll, inside
right; Erb, center forward; Adams,
inside left; Ford, outside left.
