Chancellor Jordan will leave in two
weeks for a twenty-day trip to the
Atlantic Coast and return. Although
his journey will not be a lecture tour,
he will appear before audiences in
St. Paul and Detroit.
Dr. Jordan declared that the battle
of Verdun shatters all hope of hold
ing the Berne peace conference, inas
much as Switzerland is practically
isolated. The chancellor's journey
east is in relation to peace, and in
his own words, has something to do
with "pulling the world together."
