# To Draw Tickets for Peninsula Concert
## 
### 
Drawing for seats for the Peninsula
Concert, at which Miss Florence
Hinkle will be the soloist, will be held
tomorrow morning at NVeingartner's,
at 8 o'clock. Season ticket holders
will exchange their coupons for seats
and single tickets may also be pro
cured at the price of $1.50.
This is Miss Tlinkle's first, tour of
the West, although she has an estab
lished concert, reputation in the East
ern states. Tier career has been a
direct refutation of the idea that the
successful singer of these days must
have European training and an opera
debut in order to reach the top.
