# "Tax on Queening" Says Roble Treasurer --— Value Doubted by Date-Takers
## 
### 
Where there's a will there's a way,
and the treasurer of Roble Club has
found a way. The price of "queen
ing" at Roble has gone up several
degrees, and many are doubtful as to
whether its value is equal to the in
creased taxation. He who makes
dates with Roble maids by phone,
hereafter, may consider himself "is
getting vaule received. Hut the youth
who cannot —we'll speak to him later.
This is the way the treasurer figures:
The club needs money. Many of
the so-called members have not paid
their dues. Phone bills are paid by
the club. Therefore, since she who
has not paid her dues is not a mem
ber, and is not privileged to enjoy
equal rights with true due-paying
members, she cannot use the above
mentioned phone, which is supported
by the real club members. So the
youth who is told by the maid, "She
cannot be called to the phone; she
has not paid her club dues," should
feel inexpensive, while the girl—well,
she'll feel cheaper, if she knows he
called up.
At any rate, this internal tax has
not made queening less a luxury.
