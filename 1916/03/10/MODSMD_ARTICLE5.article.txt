# MANY ENJOY FOUNDERS' DINNER
## PRESIDENT TALKS OF FRESHMAN DISCIPLINE 
### 
A happy mixture of the jovial and
the serious made Founders' Day ban
quet a success last night. Three
hundred students, alumni, and faculty
gathered for the sixth time in six
years to celebrate at dinner the birth
day of Leland Stanford. There was
food â€”food for merriment and food
for thought, in the things that were
said in the informal talks given after
the banquet. Dr. Jordan "reminisced,
effervesced, and deliquesced" to the
delight of all present, adding mater
ially to the merriment, while Presi
dent Wilbur and Vice-President Still
man dwelt upon more serious sub
jects. C. R. Lewers, '96, succeeded
in getting both elements in his short
talk.
President Wilbur took advantage of
the occasion to give his ideas on the
subject of freshman discipline in no
unmistakable terms. "I have found
much to stimulate me here at Stan
ford since I returned as president of
the University," he began. "But
there are also many artificial things
which I believe might well be dis
pensed with. We should stick to the
permanent and important things in
life, for it is a pity to spend time on

the tinsel and stucco work. The
kind of Stanford loyalty which is en
gendered by enforced duties is not
Rood loyalty.
Should He Let Alone.
"Freshmen should be allowed to do
as they please. There is too much
tendency to force people into a mold,
and no one has a right to interfere
I with the free development of a stu
j dent's individuality. The answer that
J 'they all do it,' is no answer at all.
We should be independent, should do
some fresh thinking for ourselves.
It is easy to accept the commonplace,
but that means that you are not
thinking, that you are bound by what
is behind you.
"Stanford University has done much
i to develop men during the past
twenty years, but this cannot be done
by enforced loyalty. Spontaneous
patriotism is the only kind, and it is
j the kind that existed when 1 was a
student at Stanford. There was no
need for freshman duty then. The
institution of freshman training is
wrong, and other things mean much
more in the development of the Uni
; versity."
