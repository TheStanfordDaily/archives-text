CANOEING IS THE IDEAL SI'ORT
for this fine spring weather—pro
vided you know the proper way to
paddle—with sure strokes, full of
grace, strength and beauty. Some
people who don't know how to row
flounder hopelessly, thouirh—just as
some others who don't know how to
piek good shoes buy haphazardly
when they could just ais easily go to
Tlioihf and he sure of the new
spring oxfords that combine grace,
strength, beauty, and comfort.
