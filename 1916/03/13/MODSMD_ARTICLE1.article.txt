# ARRIVAL OF NEW SHELL AND LAUNCH AIDS CREW WORK
## TRAINING TABLE ESTABLISHED New Coaching Craft Averages Twenty Miles Per Hour in Trial Run 
### 
For the first time this year, Stan
ford's crewmen are really happy. There
isn't a single cloud 011 their horizon.
The satisfaction of the squad is re
flected in the broad smiles being worn
by Coach "Husky" Guerena and Cap
tain "Chick" Orme. Fearing that his
smile alone wouldn't explain the cause
of his joy, the usually reticent cap
tain let out the following: "The new
launch arrived last Friday afternoon,
the new varsity shell came this morn
ing, the varsity eight is hitting its
stride in great shape, the training
table in the Union Cafe is the best
the crew has ever had, and the water
in Redwood Hay is as wet as ever."
liUiiiteli and Shell Arrive.
One week ago the ere wsquad, and
especially the men in charge, could
see nothing but disaster and defeat
ahead. But with the arrival of the
long-awaited coaching launch and new
varsity shell from the manufacturers
in Seattle, and the sudden improve
ment in the form shown by the var
sity oarsmen, all dire prospects have
vanished.
Twenty Miles I'er Hour.
The now launch, which is the first
real launch ever owned by the Stan
ford student body, was purchased from
.Maritime Engine Co., of Seattle. The
cost is $620. The new boat is a "V"
bottom, W. P. Hand model, and con
, tains a 20-horse power Wisconsin
j motor. On the trial run from San
Francisco to Redwood, the launch
made a trille better than twenty miles
per hour.
1 Unilt for Heavy Crew.
When it was decided to leave the
varsity shell in the Columbia boat
house, rather than ship it back across
I the continent, a new shell was order
ed from Pocock Brothers. This shell
arrived at Redwood this morning, and
will be rigged ready for use tomorrow
afternoon. So far this season the
varsity eight have had to use the
freshman boat, which was much too
light. The new shell is built for an
j especially heavy crew, and will just
isuit the 180 pound eight.
Twenty-three Mile Trip.
In a conditioning trip last week,
the three crew squads made a twenty
three mile trip to San Mateo and re
turn. All men held out well under
the strain. This was the first time
in four years that the squad has taken
such a long trip. The round-trip was
made in a little over two hours.
With the arrival of the coaching
launch, the work of "Husky" Guerena
will be greatly facilitated. He will
be on hand every day from now on,
and will supervise the workouts from
his favorite position in the launch.
