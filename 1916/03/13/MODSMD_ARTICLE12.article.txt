# LOW HURDLE RECORD OF PACIFIC COAST SHATTERED
## HOUSE DOES 220 IN 24 FLAT "Greens" Defeats "Reds" in Saturday Meet-Novice Men Winners 
### 
With the Pacific Coast low hurdle
record shattered, and the Stanford
record in the 220-yard dash equalled,
beside excellent time recorded in
practically every other event, the first
dual track meet of the season, run
over the full distances, last Saturday
afternoon, was in all respects a re
markable exhibition of mid-season
cinder-path performances.
Greens Win.
The "Oreens," captained by "Feg"
Murray, and composed of those mem
bers of the varsity squad who hail
from Palo Alto, and the freshmen, tri
umphed over the "Reds," comprising
the rest of the varsity squad, under
"Hill" Sisson. The relay decided the
meet, final score being 64 1-6 to 57 5-6.
At the same time the novice squad
met the San Jose High school team
and easily defeated them to the tune
of r>2V 2 to 24 1 /2. The novice heats
were run just before the varsity con
tests, and brought out some close
finishes.
House Ilrenks Record.
The outstanding, feature of the day
was unquestionably the performance
of M. It. House, '19, who outdistanced
Norton in the 220-yard low hurdles,
winning the event in 24 seconds fiat,
and thereby breaking the existing
coast record of 24 1-5, which is held
by F. S. Murray, '16. "Feg" Murray
demonstrated his ability as a sprinter
by taking the 220-yard dash in 21 4-5.
This equals the Stanford record for
the event., made by E. P. Campbell,
'13. Murray also won the IQO-yard
