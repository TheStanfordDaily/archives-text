# TWELVE TENNIS MATCHES BRING STARS TO FORE
## 
### 
Stanford tennis players and repre
sentatives of the California Club of
San Francisco played the first tourn
ament of tiie Northern Tennis League
of California yesterday on the Encina
courts. Twelve matches were sched
uled, the first one taking place at 10
o'clock in the morning. The winner
of the tournament could not be de
termined, as the two teams stood six
matches won by the California Club to
five won by Stanford, when the final
singles match between Eric Pedley
and Maples had to lie postponed on
account of darkness. At. the time the
play was stopped, Pedley had won one
set and stood two-love on the next set,
so the possibility of a tie tourney
seems highly probable, when this
match is played off.
liiilin In CJoort Form.
Herb Halm featured in a close win
over "Mel" Long, well known as for
mer champion of California and Na
tional player of note. This was the
best, match of the day. Excellent
rallies were frequent, and both play
ers displayed splendid service. Long
was not in the best condition possible
and Hahn was in good form, which ac
counts for the upsetting of the racquet
dope.
Parber, Clover. Hahn, and Johns all
played sterling tennis, the first four
winning their matches, v.liile Johns
proved to be a fine doubles partner,
defeating Long and Rohlfs, and shar
ing honors with Hahn. Clover and
Hawks showed to good advantage in
the doubles, winning a hard played
two out of three sets from Marcus and
Cheeseborough. Hutchinson played in
good form against "Mel" Rosenberg,
but was defeated after three hard sets.
Johnston 111.
William Johnston, the National
champion, and John Strachan, the
wonderful San Francisco player, could
not make the trip as was contem
plated. Johnston is ill in the city,
and Strachan is away on business."
Tennis Captain J. S. Hutchinson
states, however, that these stars will
be brought to the campus soon to com
pete in some exhibition matches.

Stanford tennis players and repre
sentatives of the California Club of
San Francisco played the first tourn
ament of tiie Northern Tennis League
of California yesterday on the Encina
courts. Twelve matches were sched
uled, the first one taking place at 10
o'clock in the morning. The winner
of the tournament could not be de
termined, as the two teams stood six
matches won by the California Club to
five won by Stanford, when the final
singles match between Eric Pedley
and Maples had to lie postponed on
account of darkness. At. the time the
play was stopped, Pedley had won one
set and stood two-love on the next set,
so the possibility of a tie tourney
seems highly probable, when this
match is played off.

Herb Halm featured in a close win
over "Mel" Long, well known as for
mer champion of California and Na
tional player of note. This was the
best, match of the day. Excellent

was not in the best condition possible
and Hahn was in good form, which ac
counts for the upsetting of the racquet
dope.
Parber, Clover. Hahn, and Johns all
played sterling tennis, the first four
winning their matches, v.liile Johns

good form against "Mel" Rosenberg,
but was defeated after three hard sets.
