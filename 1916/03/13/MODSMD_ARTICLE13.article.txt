# TWELVE TENNIS MATCHES BRING STARS TO FORE
## 
### 
Stanford tennis players and repre
sentatives of the California Club of
San Francisco played the first tourn
ament of tiie Northern Tennis League
of California yesterday on the Encina
courts. Twelve matches were sched
uled, the first one taking place at 10
o'clock in the morning. The winner
of the tournament could not be de
termined, as the two teams stood six
matches won by the California Club to
five won by Stanford, when the final
singles match between Eric Pedley
and Maples had to lie postponed on
account of darkness. At. the time the
play was stopped, Pedley had won one
set and stood two-love on the next set,
so the possibility of a tie tourney
seems highly probable, when this
match is played off.
liiilin In CJoort Form.
Herb Halm featured in a close win
over "Mel" Long, well known as for
mer champion of California and Na
tional player of note. This was the
best, match of the day. Excellent
rallies were frequent, and both play
ers displayed splendid service. Long
was not in the best condition possible
and Hahn was in good form, which ac
counts for the upsetting of the racquet
dope.
Parber, Clover. Hahn, and Johns all
played sterling tennis, the first four
winning their matches, v.liile Johns
proved to be a fine doubles partner,
