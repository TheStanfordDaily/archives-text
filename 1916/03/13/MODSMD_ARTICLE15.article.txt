# Gogetem, Frosh!

That idea of sending the freshman
crew to the regatta 011 Lake Washing
ton is a good one. Stanford first year
eights have heen coming through in
regular style 011 the Oakland estuary
since the intercollegiate freshman
race was first instituted. An unbroken
string of victories over California
since 1904, and wins from the Wash
ington freshmen in the two races that
crew has entered in recent years, is
a record for Stanford to he proud of.
The Washington freshman eight has
made the trip south for the past two
years, but will not do so this year.
The one chance of the Cardinal babies
to compete with the men from the
north is to meet them in their own
country.
This year's freshman class has a
chance to distinguish itself by being
the first class to send its crew out of
the state. Coach C.uerena and Captain
Orme are enthusiastic about the trip.
Here's hoping the action on this mat
ter at the freshman class meeting
later in the week will be favorable.
