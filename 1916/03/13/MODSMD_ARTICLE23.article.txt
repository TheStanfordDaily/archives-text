# H. Buckland, '18, Wins Coast Swimming Honors
## Championship Goes to Lengthy Backstroke Artist, While Goldsmith Wins 50-Yard Novice 
### 
Stanford gained recognition in swim
ming circles Friday when H. Auckland,
'18, took the Pacific Coast champion
ship in the 150-yard backstroke, in the
meet held under the auspices of the
Olympic Club. The lengthy swimmer
won handily, leading his nearest op
ponent by some seven yards, although
competition in this meet was furnished
by the most expert aquatic perform
ers along the Pacific. His time was
2:03. The record in this event is
1:53 2-5, made by Harry Hebner of
Chicago, at the Exposition last sum
mer. Although Stanford was given t
credit for the five points made in this !
race, Buck land swam unattached.
A. A. Goldsmith, 'IG, won the 50-yard j
novice, in 27:2. Coach Brandsten con
siders Goldsmith's performance as very
encouraging, since it was the first ap
pearance of the latter against such
swimmers as entered the race.
Caughey and Penniman qualified for |
the finals in this event, but did not
place. A1 Oyster, ' IG. swam a good j
race in the 200-yard breaststroke, but !
was edged out of placing in a close
finish.
Stanford freshmen will meet Lowell
11 i"h School's swimming team at the
local pool next Saturday.
