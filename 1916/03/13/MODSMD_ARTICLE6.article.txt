# STANFORD WINS SOCCER TITLE FROM U.C. IN FAST GAME
## CARDS GET LATHROP TROPHY Farm Eleven Superior in Team Work and Goal-Shooting. Score Is 4-2 
### 
In one of the best games of soccer
ever played between Stanford and
California, the Cardinal eleven won not
only the intercollegiate title and the
Lathrop Trophy for the coming year,
but the championship of the Exposition
Soccer League, by defeating the Hears
4 to 2, Saturday.
California Strong.
California presented the strongest
lineup it has ever putin the field and
the game was fast and furious from
the start. Superiority in dribbling
marked the playing of the Blue and
Gold squad, but greater speed and abil
ity to utilize goal-shooting opportuni
ties, coupled with perfect team work,
won the day for Stanford. A vast im
provement in the work of both teams
over that in the Washington's Birth
day match, captured by the Cardinals,
3 to 0, marked Saturday's contest.
