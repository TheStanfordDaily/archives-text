# Two Stanford Ball Teams Meet Defeat
## Olympic Club and Davis Farm Nines Down Varsity and Freshmen 
### 
Playing ragged baseball, the Stan
ford varsity and freshmen teams lost
the first double-header of the season
Saturday, dropping poorly played
games to the Davis Farm aggregation
and the fast Olympic Club nine. In
he preliminary contest the visitors
defeated the freshmen by a 5 to 3
score, while the "Winged O" players
took the varsity into camp by an 8. to
1 count. Excellent baseball weather
prevailed, inducing a large crowd to
putin an appearance.
Freshmen Make Errors.
Peterson of the first year tossers
pitched a no-hit no-run game up to the
sixth inning, while his team mates
scored three runs behind him. It
looked as though the game was as
sood as won, but in the sixth and sev
enth frames the opposing team sent
live markers across on six hits and
five errors. The first year players
seemed to lack the fight that they
have displayed up to this game. They
dragged the contest out over the
necessary time for playing nine in
nings, and fielded in poor style, seven
errors being chalked up against the
team.
