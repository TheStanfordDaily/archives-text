# Two Stanford Ball Teams Meet Defeat
## Olympic Club and Davis Farm Nines Down Varsity and Freshmen 
### 
Playing ragged baseball, the Stan
ford varsity and freshmen teams lost
the first double-header of the season
Saturday, dropping poorly played
games to the Davis Farm aggregation
and the fast Olympic Club nine. In
he preliminary contest the visitors
defeated the freshmen by a 5 to 3
score, while the "Winged O" players
took the varsity into camp by an 8. to
1 count. Excellent baseball weather
prevailed, inducing a large crowd to
putin an appearance.
Freshmen Make Errors.
Peterson of the first year tossers
pitched a no-hit no-run game up to the
sixth inning, while his team mates
scored three runs behind him. It
looked as though the game was as
sood as won, but in the sixth and sev
enth frames the opposing team sent
live markers across on six hits and
five errors. The first year players
seemed to lack the fight that they
have displayed up to this game. They
dragged the contest out over the
necessary time for playing nine in
nings, and fielded in poor style, seven
errors being chalked up against the
team.

> A close look at the Olympic Club
lineup before the varsity tangle would
f'lnwst assure one of a Cardinal de
fcat, but the eight runs gathered by
the visitors were not gained through
their playing ability, but upon slow
;r d listless fielding on the part of the
S'anford team. Five errors, not in
cluding some errors of judgment, are
too many for a university nine at this
stage of the season.
Draper twirled a beautiful game, the
Olympics obtaining but four bingles
from his twisters. Time and again,
lie struck out men in the pinches and
during the eight innings he worked,
but one earned run was made by the
opposing batsmen. Wickershain
showed up in tine form, fielding some
hard chances in excellent style. Jack
McCarthy umpired a good game, al
though he had a number of close ones
to call. The box score follows:
