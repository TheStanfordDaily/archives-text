first dual meet of the present season.
Two picked teams of varsity men will
hold a small meet along with the main
event. The first race will start
promptly at 2 o'clock, thus assuring
a full calendar of events.
Howard E. Hendricks of San Fran
cisco made known the Athletic
League's selection of the All Star
team last night. The preps have a
number of fast men in their list and
should make a good showing against
the freshmen. The best known run
ner with the visitors will be Frank
Sloman, the world's interscholastic

both the 220 and 440 yard events.
The Stanford squad has not been
chosen yet, but such men as Wark,
Floete, House, Pelouze, Wilcox, and
Rogers, should stack up well.
