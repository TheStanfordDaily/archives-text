# ST. MARY'S TO OFFER MIDWEEK DIAMOND ATTRACTION
## GAME STARTS AT 4:15 SHARP Catholics Have Speedy Nine. Chinese Team Coming on Thursday Afternoon 
### 
One of the best baseball games of
the present season will be played to
morrow afternoon on the varsity dia
mond, when the Stanford nine meets
the St. Mary's team. The game will
be called by Umpire Jack McCarthy
promptly at 4:15, and the full nine
innings will in all probability be run
off before darkness sets in. Season
tickets will be honored at the gate,
those without the pasteboards being
required to donate twenty-five cents
to the student body treasury.
St. Mary's has long been known as
having one of the finest college baseball
teams in the country. Reports from
the bay regions are to the effect
that this season's squad is on a par
with past St. Mary's performers, so
the fans can expect baseball of high
class in the mid-week contest. The
visiting lineup has not been an
nounced, but it is understood that a
number of last year's players are on
the 1916 aggregation, including the
hard-hitting Guisto, who has signed a
contract to play ball for the Mc-
McCredies in Portland.
Hard Workout. Yesterday.
Coach Harry Wolter put the var
sity through a hard workout yester
day afternoon, and today's practice
will largely determine who will rep
resent the Cardinal in Wednesday's
tangle. The bleacher warmers expect
a shakeup in the lineup, but it is
doubtful if there will be many
changes in the local nine.
The pitchers, Hoever, Wickersham,
Draper, Howe, and Mattei, are all
working fairly well, and with Dent,
Hayes, Hensel, Stafford, Stevens,
Braden, Sanborn, Bihlman, Lander,
Noonan, and Wickersham to pick the
remainder of the team from, a win
ning contingent will be turned out
before April Sth.
