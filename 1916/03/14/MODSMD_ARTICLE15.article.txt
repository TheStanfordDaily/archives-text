# "What's It About?
## 
### 
Spring is here, and it's time for
that annual editorial â€”one of the tra
ditions of the office. We're not going
to advise boning every afternoon and
evening in spite of the fine weather
these days. It would be useless and
besides, we're not convinced it would
be good advice.
But why not improve that time
when you're "just doing nothing?" A
little solid thinking won't be too much
exertion and it will help make the
college semester a lot more useful
one.
Tf you run out of a subject for
thought here's one we suggest: What
is the object of the courses you are
taking this semester and where do
they fit into your general training at
Stanford?
Students take most of the courses
they select from the curriculum with
the idea of getting something more
out of them than hours for gradua
tion. Tt's late enough in the se
mester now to determine just what
that something is and how It can be
applied. A little later on the oppor
tunity will be lost in the eleventh
hour scramble for enough information
to fill the blue books.
