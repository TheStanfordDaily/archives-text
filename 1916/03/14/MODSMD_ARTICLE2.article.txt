# Tuskegee Singers Coming March 24
## Colored Musicians Will Sing For Roble Club and in The Union 
### 
Jubilee music of the real, old-fash
ioned plantation kind is coming to
Stanford, and will arrive on the Quad
on Friday, March 24, in the persons
of the Tuskegee Institute colored
singers, who made such a hit last
spring, when they gave a concert in
the Union. The Union will be the
scene of this year's appearance, and
the singers will give a few numbers
at Roble at dinner, as they did last
year.
All who heard the Tuskegee song
sters last year remember the won
derful program they gave. Every
class of darky music, from revival
melodies with a ragtime swing in
them, to such popular old-time fav
orites as "Swing Uow, Sweet Chariot,"
was represented, and the end man
was there with the dialect stories.
There will be no admission charge,
although a silver offering will be
taken. The jubilee singers come here
under the auspices of the Stanford
Y. M. C. A.
Charles Winter Wood, a member of
the Tuskegee faculty, who accompan
ied the troupe last year, will be with
them again, this spring. He will tell
the story of the life of the founder of
the Institute, Booker T. Washington,
whose death occurred during the past
year.
Tuskegee Institute has grown in
size from the deserted chicken house
in which it had its origin in 1881, to
a modern university with 110 build
ings, covering 2000 acres of land.
Forty trades are taught to 1. r >oo stu
dents by a faculty of 200 teachers and
workers.
