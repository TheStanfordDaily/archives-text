# Thomas Trophy Adds to Peanut League Rivalry
## 
### 
With most of the fifty men oil the
four teams reporting regularly for
the four games played each week, the
peanut league is having one of its
most successful seasons.
The four teams of the league are
Blacks, Whites, Reds, and lllues, un
der the leadership respectively of
"Bud" Hastings, Phil Twohy, "Dit"
Hayes, and John Phares. "Fat" Rehin
has been in charge of the Blues until
this week, when he was compelled
to resign on account of working in
San Francisco in the afternoons.
Peanut Leaguers Advance.
The peanut league might aptly be
termed the training ground of the
varsity. All those players that show
exceptional ability in the peanut
league are given a chance on the
varsity squad. Hensel and Draper
are two good instances of this. Var
sity Captain "Babe" Dent has endeav
ored to give as much attention as
possible to the peanut squad, and its
results have been noted in several
cases.
Interest to date has been very good
in the league, even though the teams
were contesting for no trophy, but
now C. A. Thomas, '98, has gener
ously offered as a trophy an eighteen
inch silver cup, mounted on an ebony
base. This cup is to go to the win
ning team and will be contested for
annually. The trophy will be known
as the "C. A. Thomas Baseball
Trophy," and on the ebony base a
small silver plate with the name of
the winning team, will be affixed. The
donation of this cup will undoubtedly
increase the rivalry between teams.
Whites Leading.
At the present time Phil Twohy's
Whites are leading the league. The
Blues, under "Fat" Rehm, got off to
a bad start, and held the rear position
for many days, but finally recovered,
and have been winning steadily. This
winning streak continued last night
under their new leader, John Phares,
and they are now in second place.
All of the teams are within striking
distance of one another, and a shift
of positions is probable any night.
The standing of the teams to date
is as follows:
Team — W L PC.
Whites 11 3 .785
Blues 9 8 .529
Reds 7 9 .411
Blacks 5 12 .294
The men on teams are:
Whites — Coleman, Aten, Hawks,
Jardine, Fuller, Saunders, Jones, Bail
iff, Fabling, Garret, Durney, and
Twohy (captain).
Blues —Bonnett, Thompson, Masters,
Stiver, Loomis, Smith, Hauser, E.
Wright, Lyon, West, Dickey, and
Phares (captain).
Reds —Oliver, Field, Tedford, Card,

annually. The trophy will be known
as the "C. A. Thomas Baseball
Trophy," and on the ebony base a
small silver plate with the name of
the winning team, will be affixed. The
donation of this cup will undoubtedly
increase the rivalry between teams.
Whites Leading.
At the present time Phil Twohy's
Whites are leading the league. The
Blues, under "Fat" Rehm, got off to
a bad start, and held the rear position
for many days, but finally recovered,
and have been winning steadily. This
winning streak continued last night
under their new leader, John Phares,
and they are now in second place.
All of the teams are within striking
distance of one another, and a shift
of positions is probable any night.
The standing of the teams to date
is as follows:
Team — W L PC.
Whites 11 3 .785
Blues 9 8 .529
Reds 7 9 .411
Blacks 5 12 .294
The men on teams are:
Whites — Coleman, Aten, Hawks,
Jardine, Fuller, Saunders, Jones, Bail
iff, Fabling, Garret, Durney, and
Twohy (captain).
Blues —Bonnett, Thompson, Masters,
Stiver, Loomis, Smith, Hauser, E.
Wright, Lyon, West, Dickey, and
Phares (captain).
Reds —Oliver, Field, Tedford, Card,
Small, Townsend, Chandler, Wallace,
Licking, Cullen, and Hayes (captain).
Blacks —Shriver, Righter, Knight,
Melcon, Clark, Templeton, Kyle, Estes,
Driver, Ames, Parthum, Kohner, W.
Wright, McCloskey, McCormick,
Thomas, Hurley, and Hastings (cap
tain).
With most of the fifty men oil the
four teams reporting regularly for
the four games played each week, the
peanut league is having one of its
most successful seasons.
The four teams of the league are
Blacks, Whites, Reds, and lllues, un
der the leadership respectively of
"Bud" Hastings, Phil Twohy, "Dit"
Hayes, and John Phares. "Fat" Rehin
has been in charge of the Blues until
this week, when he was compelled
to resign on account of working in
San Francisco in the afternoons.
Peanut Leaguers Advance.
The peanut league might aptly be
termed the training ground of the
varsity. All those players that show
exceptional ability in the peanut
league are given a chance on the
varsity squad. Hensel and Draper
are two good instances of this. Var
sity Captain "Babe" Dent has endeav
ored to give as much attention as
possible to the peanut squad, and its
results have been noted in several
cases.
Interest to date has been very good
in the league, even though the teams
were contesting for no trophy, but
now C. A. Thomas, '98, has gener
ously offered as a trophy an eighteen
inch silver cup, mounted on an ebony
base. This cup is to go to the win
ning team and will be contested for
annually. The trophy will be known
as the "C. A. Thomas Baseball
Trophy," and on the ebony base a
small silver plate with the name of
the winning team, will be affixed. The
