previously untried ideas for stunts
and unique bits of entertainment that
the committee in charge of the Cafe
Chantant is kept busy selecting and
organizing the best. Everything is
very Frenchy. From the posters
through the great variety of costumes
to the eats the air of Paris prevails.
Many Vaudeville Stunts.
Vaudeville stunts were being re
hearsed all up and down the Row this
noon, giving it a gala appearance and
creating much interest on the part of
those who got snatches of grand
opera and ball room dance tunes in
passing. Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Crane
are to assist in making the Chantant
a success, in the personages of Miss
Dorothy Metz, '17, and E. R. Knollin,
'15, who do all the turns and dips in a
truly Crane-like manner.
Three Orchestras.
Three orchestras have donated their
services for the afternoon. One, in
charge of J. T. Reynolds, *18, will play
for those who come early, and others
will dance to the Paul-Solan-McDer
mott airs, or music by J. D. McLacli
lan's orchestra. Co-ed chocolates, do
nated by Wilson, will be prizes for
two lucky number dances, and favor
dances will be in vogue. In place of
having one supper dance the eats will
be on hand all the afternoon and one
may eat with every partner with
whom one dances.

noon.
