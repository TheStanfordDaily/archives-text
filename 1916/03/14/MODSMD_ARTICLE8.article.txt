# Office Boy Needed
## 
### 
Owing to the pressure of school
work, P. V. R. Adams, *17, who was
chosen for the office boy role in "A
Pair of Sixes," the 1916 Senior farce,
has had to give up his part in the
east. Senior Farce Chairman W. 13.
Curtis is now on the lookout for men
who can handle this part. Curtis de
fines the necessary qualities of pros
pective candidates as being lots of
pep and snap, and states that a little
man. physically, is needed. The part
is a very important one during the
first act. and calls for real acting.
Prospective office boys should give
their names to either Curtis or Huford
Williams. Tryouts will be held soon.
