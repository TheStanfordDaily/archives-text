# FRESHMAN CREW QUESTION WILL BE UP TOMORROW
## 
### 
Whether or not the Stanford 1919
crew will be sent north in April to
compete with the University of Wash
ington freshman crew will be decided
at a meeting of the nineteeners to
morrow afternoon. The big problem
being considered by the freshmen is
the possibility of raising $400 by as
sessment of class members. Before
the matter is taken up for final dis
position, members of the class will be
given opportunity to air their views
on the advisability of attempting to
send the baby crew to Lake Wash
ington.
Mlers Must Raise Money.
In his letter to Class President R.
J. Macdonald, Fred A. Lind, president
of the Varsity Boat Club of the Uni
versity of Washington, states that for
the past two years the Washington
freshmen have raised all the money
needed to send the freshman crew to
Oakland to meet the University of
California and Stanford first year
crews.
Inasmuch as neither the Washing
ton varsity or freshman eights will
make the trip south this spring, the
Cardinal baby eight will be able to
compete with the northerners only if
the class sends the team to Seattle.
Race April 8.
Should the vote prove favorable to
the project, the Stanford freshman
crew will meet the Washington 1919
eight on Lake Washington on the
morning of April 8, in a race prelim
inary to the Stanford-Washington var
sity match.
