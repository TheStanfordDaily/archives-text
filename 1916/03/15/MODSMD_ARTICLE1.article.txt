# REORGANIZATION PLANS BEFORE CONFERENCE TOMORROW
## COMMITTEE COMPLETES TASK Mass Meeting and Election to Be Held if Constitution Is Favored 
### 
Plans for the complete reorganiza
tion of the Student Conference will
be submitted to that body at the reg
ular meeting tomorrow evening. The
committee on reorganization has been
working on a constitution for a bet
ter student government ever since
appointment by President C. M. Miller
early in January, and made the final
revision of the instrument last night.
This was the sixth writing, and is
complete in every detail of adminis
tration, stipulating minutely the
duties of both officers and students.
If adopted by the Conference tomor
row evening, the new constitution will
be submitted to a mass meeting of
students some time next week. Fol
lowing this an election will be held
on the Quad.
Will Replace Present Body.
[112 ratified, the new body provided
for by the constitution will super
cede the present Conference automat
ically, replacing the existing system
of departmental representation, with
one of representation by the living
groups of the University. Each fra
ternity will be represented by one
member, either the heads of houses,
or, if their names may not be di
vulged, a responsible upperclassman.
Each organized clubhouse will also
have one representative. These men
will have but one vote, while Encina
will be represented by its Board of
Governors and president, seven in all,
having each two votes. Palo Alto
students and unorganized students on
the campus will also have adequate
representation.
Purpose of Change.
The chief purpose in this change is
to enable the Conference to get in
touch with students as a preventive
as well as a curative institution. The
big defect now is that although the
members are representative students,
they do not represent any tangible
unit and carry but little influence into
their departments.
An elective, instead of an appoint
ive council is provided for in the con
stitution. It shall consist of five
members, not chosen by the confer
ence as at present, but by the stu
dents. In April of each year, the
Conference shall nominate ten men
with fifty or more hours of University
credit, from whom the students with
fifty or more hours will elect five.
The Conference itself will be per
petuating, the members taking office
in April of each year. There will be
a membership committee, the duty of
which will be to see that each group
is represented at all times. Under
the proposed change, students and
members of the conference and coun
cil would owe a duty to take an ac
tive part in maintaining the best in
terests of student government and the
constitution provides for a require
ment of that sense of responsibility.
If the plan meets with favor, steps
will be taken at once to insure the
installation of the new Conference,
so that active work may begin next
semester.
The committee requests that all
members of the Conference be pres
ent tomorrow evening. This com
mittee is composed of C. M. Miller,
'14, W. F. Noonan, '16, R. E. Need
ham, '16, G. A. Jacomini, '15, F. E.
Rehm, '15, Buford Williams, '16, W. G.
Paul, '16, and Paul Staniford, '16,
chairman.
