# REORGANIZATION PLANS BEFORE CONFERENCE TOMORROW
## COMMITTEE COMPLETES TASK Mass Meeting and Election to Be Held if Constitution Is Favored 
### 
Plans for the complete reorganiza
tion of the Student Conference will
be submitted to that body at the reg
ular meeting tomorrow evening. The
committee on reorganization has been
working on a constitution for a bet
ter student government ever since
appointment by President C. M. Miller
early in January, and made the final
revision of the instrument last night.
This was the sixth writing, and is
complete in every detail of adminis
tration, stipulating minutely the
duties of both officers and students.
If adopted by the Conference tomor
row evening, the new constitution will
be submitted to a mass meeting of
students some time next week. Fol
lowing this an election will be held
on the Quad.
Will Replace Present Body.
[112 ratified, the new body provided
for by the constitution will super
cede the present Conference automat
ically, replacing the existing system
of departmental representation, with
one of representation by the living
groups of the University. Each fra
ternity will be represented by one
member, either the heads of houses,
or, if their names may not be di
vulged, a responsible upperclassman.
Each organized clubhouse will also
have one representative. These men
will have but one vote, while Encina
will be represented by its Board of
Governors and president, seven in all,
having each two votes. Palo Alto
students and unorganized students on
the campus will also have adequate
representation.
Purpose of Change.
The chief purpose in this change is
to enable the Conference to get in
touch with students as a preventive
as well as a curative institution. The
big defect now is that although the
members are representative students,
they do not represent any tangible
unit and carry but little influence into
their departments.
