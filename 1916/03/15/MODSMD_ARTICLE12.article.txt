# Government Changes
## 
### 
Changes in the organs of student
government proposed by the Confer
ence committee on reorganization are
unquestionably radical. However, the
plan must be considered not accord
ing to the degree of change from
present forms of organization which
It entails, but according to its in
trinsic worth and the possibility it
offers for more efficient student gov
ernment.
To be anything else than child
like, any objections to the new consti
tution which are advanced solely be
cause the changes it necessitates are
radical, must be supported by evi
dence that the present organization
is almost perfect—evidence which it
will be hard to find.
The Conference committee on reor
ganization is attempting to make the
new Conference a body which will be
in closer touch with the activities of
the men of the University—whose
members will wield a greater per
sonal influence. The ideal is to have
the activities of the student govern
ment organizations broader than in
the past. They will do more than
pass rules and wield the axe when
these rules are broken.
A Conference composed of respon
sible members of the different living
groups would be in a position to
carry on these broader activities.
Real personal influence could be
brought to bear toward the observ
ance of rules. A greater amount of
co-operation in student government
would result and with it a lessening
of the necessity for enforcing disci
pline by punishment.
