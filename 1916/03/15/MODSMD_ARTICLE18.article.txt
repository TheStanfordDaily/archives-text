# Miss Florence Hinkle Possesses Genuine Art
## Thursday's Program Includes Russian, French, German, and Italian Songs 
### 
According to San Francisco critics,
the main thing which may be deduced
from the fact that Miss Florence
Hinkle has received all her training
in this country is not that an Ameri
can education makes a successful
singer, but that if the singer has the
kind of voice that means big things
it doesn't much matter where the
training is received. Miss Hinkle is
blessed with that kind of voice.
With this she combines a perfection
of interpretation which has spelled
success for her in her chosen art.
She excels particularly in the field of
simple songs, such as the delightful
Irish "I Know My Love," which ha 6
won her such favor in her San Fran
cisco concerts and which she will re
peat tomorrow evening on her local
program. Her selections will also
include Russian, French, German and
Italian selections.
A very few seats on the stage are
still obtainable for tomorrow's con
cert, although the body of the Assem
bly Hall is entirely sold out. These
seals are at the regular price of $1.50.
