# Varsity Opposes Chinese Tomorrow
## Oriental Nine From Hawaii to Play First Game on U.S. Soil With Stanford 
### 
Cardinal diamond enthusiasts will
be given a rare treat tomorrow after
noon, when the varsity lines up
against the Chinese team from the
University of Hawaii, on the local
diamond. The visiting aggregation
is on its annual tour of the
United States, and Thursday's game
will be the first diamond struggle on
American soil for them.
The contest will be called at 4:15,
and will last nine innings. Season
tickets will not serve as admission
cards, but it is hoped that a suf
ficient number of quarters will be
turned in at the gate to make up for
the guarantee that was required to
get the crack foreign opponents to
appear.
It will be remembered that this
same team defeated the Stanford
tossers last season. Practically the
same lineup will be used by the vis
itors as was used in the game last
year, so a close contest should result.
That the Orientals possess real base
ball class is attested to by the fact
that two members of the Chinese
stickers have been offered Coast
League contracts.
