# Real Tulips Grow on Assembly Hall Stage For "In Dutch" Scenes
## 
### 
Real tulips are growing on the As
sembly Hall stage. Two hundred
plants have just heen received to
make a veritable conservatory for the
setting of the first act of "In Dutch."
An actual wedding scene is to take
place in the second act in the ter
raced garden of Herr Van Zant's
home 011 the Hudson. "When They
Syncopate That Wedding Service" is
music that will make every man take
the fatal step and march to the altar.
R. G. Whealton, '19, who plays the
leading role, gets into all sorts of
entanglements for masquerading as
his valet, whom he pawns off as the
real Bill King. The valet almost, but
not quite, marries the heiress.
Miss Harvey and Tier Voice.
Peggy Van Zant, the runaway
boarding school girl, is played by
Miss Edith Harvey, '17, to perfection.
ITer beautiful voice soon attracts the
attention of the Grand Opera im
pressario, who is continually in
search of the "one voice." Tn his
attempt to find it he tries everyone's
voice, from that of the head gard
ener, who is deaf and dumb, to Mrs.
Smitliers, the head of an exclusive
finishing school for young ladies.
Sin it li M!>, A Sure Comedian.
A sure-enough comedian has been
found in Dave Smith. '19. A mere
twist of I lie wrist sends everyone into
gales of laughter. When lie poses
Tinker Jones, Miss Angle Cross, 'IS,
in a wheelbarrow, and crowns her
with a wreath of tulips, then sings
"Let. Me He Your Horticulture
Guide," each and everyone in the aud
ience will hold his sides and large
tears will roll down the cheek.
The work of the principals and the
choruses is far in advance of any
previous opera. The players are al
most letter perfect in their lines and
the chorus work goes off with a snap.
"In Dutch" is a musical show of the
catchy type, and there is not a dull
moment in the whole production.
lie "In Dutch" for once, urges the
committee, and be at the seat sale
j Thursday, March 22.
