# Women Schedule Basketball Games With California
## 
### 
Permission has been granted by the
Faculty Athletic Committee for the
Stanford basketball women to hold
inter-class competition with the Uni
versity of California this year. There
have been no basketball games be
tween the Stanford and California
women since 1910, for the reason that
varsity contests proved unsatisfactory
to both sides. It is hoped that the
large number of girls taking part in
this new form of intercollegiate com
petition will do away with the tense
feeling of rivalry which existed in
the old game so that the contests
will prove to be friendly exhibitions
of good basketball.
One of the main objects in resum
ing relations with California is to in
terest more women in the sport and
to give a larger number of players a
chance to take part in some form of
outside competition. Every woman
who comes out to practice now stands
a chance to play with her class team
The contests will be played off at
Berkeley on the California Women's
Field Day—April 22.
