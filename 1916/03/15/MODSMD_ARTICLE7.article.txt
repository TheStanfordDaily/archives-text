According to Crew Captain "Chick"
Orme, students are neglecting to re
quest track and crew coupons when
making purchases at The Regent. In
order to assist the varsity eight and
the track team to make the trip east
this spring. The Regent has offered
to give a refund of 3 per cent on all
purchases made, and on all accounts
paid up.
In order to obtain the rebate, how
ever, it will be necessary to ask for
coupons at the time of sale. Coupons
must be turned in to either Track
Captain "Fee:" Murray or to Orme.
