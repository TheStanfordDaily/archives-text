# CHANTANT WILL RIVAL DANSANTS AT EXPOSITION
## 
### 
Did you ever dance at the Cali
fornia Building?
The Cafe Chantant in the Women's
Club House on St. Patrick's Day, is
to offer every attraction of the Ex
position ball room, and, in addition,
the most unique program ever put on
at Stanford. Dates are being made
early for there are few indeed who
can resist seeing the promised stunts
and take-offs—to say nothing of the
eats.
Harry Robertson, '10, will be here
to sing for the first time since his
study in Italy, and Mrs. Leonard Ely,
of Palo Alto, is to impersonate
Yvette Gilbert. Greek dances in
historically correct Grecian costumes
are to be given by Miss Etta Paris.
Ellen Galpin and Company will ap
pear in pantomimes from"The Toy
Shop."
Ball room dancing by Miss Dorothy
Metz, '17, and E. R. Knollin, '12, will
give the public an accurate imper
sonation of Mr. and Mrs. Douglas
Crane. Miss Frances Wilson, *15, who
has had experience on the Orpheum
circuit, will do "stunt" piano-playing,
making music with her head and
arms and every conceivable way ex
cept the usual one. The Glee Club
will sing.
And between all of this every one
is to dance and eat and have a good
time. Three orchestras will provide
the necessary terpsicliorean rhythm.
Hoxes of Co-eds, donated by Mr. Wil
son, will be raflled off in lucky num
ber dances.
Tickets were placed on sale at the
Bookstore today, and may also be
obtained from representatives in the
various houses, for seventy-five cents
apiece or a dollar and a half a couple.
Queening is in order —but make your
date early.
