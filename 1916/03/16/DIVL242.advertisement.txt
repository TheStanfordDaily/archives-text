California to Chicago
Just remember
—four daily transcontinental trains to Kansas City and Chicago—a
quick way to New York.
The California Limited
—exclusively first-class.
The Navajo
—a fast train, carries both standard and tourist sleepers.
The Scout
—The old standby for years—first and second class.
The Missionary
—runs via Helen cut-off—fast, too—for both first and second class
travel to Kansas City and Chicago.
—also goes to Houston and New Orleans.
They all take you through the most
interesting part of the great South
west. Stopovers allozved for Petrified
Forest and Grand Canyon.
