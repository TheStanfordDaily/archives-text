# Point System Will Begin September 1
## Economics Department Will Inaugurate Standard of Grading New To Stanford 
### 
September 1, 1916, lias been named
by the faculty of the Department of
Economics as the date on which the
honor point system will be put into
effect.
The honor point system will be
made to apply to all credits earned
after September by all undergraduate
majors in the department, who will
start with honor points equal in num
ber to the unit-hours already earned.
Applied To Conditions.
In applying the system to condi
tioned work, the "minus one," result
ing from conditional work, stands
and will not be erased. If the con
dition is not made up and becomes
a failure, the record will be changed
to "minus two" at the expiration of
a year. If the condition is made up,
the grade on which the condition is
removed carries with it appropriate
plus credit in honor points.
Thus a student with a condition
in three hours has a record of "minus
three;" if made up with a grade of
"D," he gets three unit hours, but re
mains short three honor points, be
sides gaining no honor points in that,
course. If made up with a grade of
"C," his honor points and unit-hours
are balanced as to former work, but
he remains short the honor points on
the course in which he is conditioned;
if made up with a grade of "TV his
minus points are balanced off and lie
has gained three points applicable to
the new work, so that his work stands
as if he had made "C" at the outset.
