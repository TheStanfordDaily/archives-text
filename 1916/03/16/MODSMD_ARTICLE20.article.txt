# Military Training
## 
### 
Two weeks have passed since the
"think it over" campaign was insti
tuted on the question of military
training at Stanford. A long time
has been given to consider all sides
of the question before any action is
taken toward organization. Are the
men of the campus thinking over the
advisability of military training in
the meantime, or have they let all
thought about it slide? When their
final decision comes will it be a
thought-out decision or an eleventh
hour jump to one side of other of
the question without regard to the
merits of either side?
It must lie realized that military
drill is not a matter of present
moment only. The.men who decide
to back it now must be willing to
support it all the time they are at
Stanford. So the appeal of the uni
form is hardly the basis for deciding
the advisability of adopting military
training here.
But the idea involved is a big one
and can not be rejected lightly any
more than it can be accepted lightly.
The question of military training is
before the nation now and to refuse
to consider the advisability of insti
tuting such training here is showing
the hermit crab spirit which has
been condemned in universities.
There's time yet to get out of that
shell and find out what is going on
in the world outside.
A number of communications have
been received recently which cannot
be published because the real names
of the writers are not signed. The
name of the writer must be signed
if the article is to appear, though
his identity will be held in con
fidence and a pen-name published if
desired.
