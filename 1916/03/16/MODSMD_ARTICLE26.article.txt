Coach Harry Wolter smiles, Cap
tain "Babe" Dent smiles, and wide
grins adorn the faces of the fans.
The varsity baseball team has come
back to life. After playing listless
baseball for two weeks, throwing the
ball away at inopportune times, and
hitting about we-liate-to-say-what-per
cent, the team has regained its form,
and is serving out baseball that is a
credit to the coach.
Stanford's batting order was shift
ed, yesterday, until it didn't even re
semble the old list. Noonan looked
good in the lead-off position,
while Stevens came through as sec
ond man up. Hayes is an ideal clean
up man.
"Hoc" Hayes has boosted his bat
ting average to the grand percentage
of .411. Dent is hitting above the .300
mark, and Stevens, Stafford, Wicker- j
sham, and Hensel closely follow.
The box score of the Stanford-St. j
