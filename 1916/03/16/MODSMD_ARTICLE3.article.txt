# Frosh Released From Hearse---Is Discovered Alive
## 
### 
There are few persons in this world
who have ridden with the undertaker
and lived to tell the story. Tliere are
still fewer who have been passengers
in a sure-enough hearse.
Edwin D. Dorris, '19, holds the dis
tinction of having ridden in a hearse,
enjoyed an undertaker for a driver,
and acted as principal participant in
an operation for appendicitis, all in
side of an hour.
Dorris is now rapidly recuperating
in the Peninsula Hospital, all there
except his appendix, which Dorris de
clares is better appreciated where it
now is.
The hearse and undertaker incident
came about because Dorris' trip to
the table was a hurried one, and no
other transportation was available.
