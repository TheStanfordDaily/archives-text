# Olympic Soccerites May Contest Cardinal's Title
## 
### 
Stanford soccerites will be called
upon to defend their title to the Ex
position championship, if the Olympic
Club wins from California, Saturday,
in a match to play off a protested
game of last fall. The Blue and Gold
won the contest in question, which
was played without an official referee,
and was not within the regular time
limits. The protest against scoring
this in the Kxposition tournament
was allowed, necessitating the play
over Saturday. A victory for the
Winged-O will tie that club with
Stanford.
