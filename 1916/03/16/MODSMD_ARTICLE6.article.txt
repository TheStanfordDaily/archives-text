# Symphony Concert Attendance Evidence of Local Interest
## 
### 
Local interest in good music was
expressed by the large number of
Stanford students who turned out to
hear the season's second concert of
the Palo Alto Symphony Orchestra in
the Assembly Hall last night.
The handling of a rather difficult
program was ,on the whole, good,
showing a finish quite unusual in any
thing short of professional work.
Miss Ruth Van Pelt, '17. was charm
ing in her presentation of the solo
parts from the "Andante" of Mend
elssohn's Violin Concerto, a bit of ex
quisite arrangement demanding per
fect workmanship.
