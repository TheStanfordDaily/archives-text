# Team Will Be Selected For Eastern Tennis Tour
## 
### 
Stanford's two-man tennis team,
which is to lie named later, will leave
the campus on .May 18 to meet rep
resentatives of ten eastern and middle
western colleges and universities in
competition. These colleges have
guaranteed the team $:?00, while it
will take from $450 to $500 to finance
the trip. Means of raising this deficit
are still to be devised. Two years ago
a team representing Stanford invaded
the east and defeated every college of
note. At that time $50 was given to
the team by the Associated Students.

The schedule which has been ar
ranged covers a period of two weeks,
in which time the team will play ten
matches, which includes contests with
Harvard, Yale, the University of Chi
cago, and the I'niversity of Wiscon
