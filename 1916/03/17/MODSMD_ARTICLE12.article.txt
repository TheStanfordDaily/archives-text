Baseball of high class caliber was
displayed yesterday on the varsity
diamond, when the Stanford first
string players defeated the Chinese
team from the University of Hawaii
by a to 2 score, alter nine innings
of close play. The game was full of
sensations, being marked by fast
fielding by both squads. There was
little hitting, the varsity getting but
two bingles, while the visitors ob
tained four safeties. Inman, right
fielder for the opposing nine, featured
the contest with the longest hit on
the local grounds, this season, a
homer in deep left field, in the fourth
frame.
(•iime Is Snappy.
Umpire .lack McCarthy hurried the
tangle along at all times, the nine
innings being run off in the fast time
ol one hour and twenty minutes.
Stanford scored two runs in the first
J spasm, without getting a hit. Noonan
got a life on an error and Lander
arrived at the initial cushion on a
fielder's choice. Both advanced on a
wild throw, and came in on two beau
tiful squeeze plays executed by Hayes
and Dent. Stanford's other tally was
made in the next inning on Stafford's
triple and a single by Bihlman.
