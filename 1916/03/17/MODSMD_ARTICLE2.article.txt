# Vocalist Delights Stanford Audience
## Miss Florence Hinkle Wins Many Admirers by Excellent Rendition 
### 
Miss Florence Hinkle is a great so
prano. All those who heard her last
evening, though they may have come
prepared to be critical, went away
admiring. We cannot compare Miss
Hinkle to (Jadski and Farrar. Her
art lies in an entirely different di
rection. She is first of all a concert
singer, whereas most of the others
who have reached t lie distinction of a
place in "Who's Who," have done it
through the medium of the opera
stage.
First Notes Convinced.
The first sustained notes of the
"Care Solve" convinced her audience
that here was an artist of the first
rank. It is hard to believe that her
legato notes could be surpassed by
any singer living. By the time the
first group of numbers was completed
Miss Hinkle had won her hearers to
admiration of her voice. It, remained
for their hearts to be touched by the
fine feeling of "Du bist die Rub,", the
fire of "O komtn im Traum," and the
happy swing of "O liebliche Wangen"
in the second group.
Ilenuty in French Interpretations.
There was an irresistible beauty in
Miss 11 inkle's interpretation of Cliar
penfier's "Depuis le Jour," which con
cluded the group of French selec
tions. As an encore, the soprano
gave "My Laddie," and sang it in a
way which converted any of us who
are wont to think that only Sohu
mann-Heinck can sing that as we
want to hear it.
In the last number. Miss Hinkle
delighted her audience beyond meas
ure with the fears of the Irish maid
in"I Know My Love." One of the
finest moments of the entire evening
was marked by her singing of the
dramatic "Life and Death."
