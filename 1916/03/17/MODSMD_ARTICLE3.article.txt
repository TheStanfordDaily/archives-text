# St. Patrick's Spirit Gives Pep to Chantant—Stanford Roughs Dance and Queen
## 
### 
Ireland put one over on France to
day! Even with the moral support
of previously announced Frenchy dec
orations, costumes and pastry, the
"air of Paris" for the Cafe Chantant,
got decidedly mixed with that of Dub
lin Hay and the Dansant much re
sembled an Irish village.
Even the freshmen couldn't keep
a corner on green, and from roughs
to stiff-collared swains the added
touch of color was in evidence, just
below the chin. The Dansant made
Stanford wake up to the fact that
it could be "New Portish" and aristo
cratic. Even the vowed-he'd-never
dance one cavorted around the room
to the latest terpsichorean rhythm,
"The Wearin' o' the Green." Green
was there, all right fin more ways
than one).
Whether Paris could unbend or not
is debatable, but St. Patric saved the
day, and the do-as-you-please spirit
made Stanford's first Chantant a go.
It's rather difficult to say who will
derive the greatest benefit—Stanlord
ites or Belgians!
