# FRESHMEN DEFEAT U.C. QUINTET BY 41-22 SCORE
## POINTS CLOSELY CONTESTED First-Year Men Play Fastest Game on Local Floor This Year 
### 
Outplaying their opponents at every
stage of the game, Stanford freshmen
defeated the University of California
first-year quintet last night by a 41-22
score. The game was the fastest
seen on the local floor this year and
every point was closely contested.
Stanford Leads.
While play was fast and hard
fought at. the opening of the game
several minutes elapsed before Estes
succeeded in shooting the first basket.
From then on the advantage was all
Stanford's, fourteen points being an
nexed before California succeeded in
locating the basket. The fact that the
lead was with the other side never
caused the Blue and Gold team to
let down and they were fighting every
minute.
The second half in its opening was
a repetition of the first half, neither
side being able to locate the basket
for some time. The game was as
furious as the first half, but one by
one the California players succumbed
to the Cardinal attack, until at the
end of the game only one of the orig
inal five, Langmaster, was still in the
game.
Langmaster was easily the pick of
the visiting team, shooting nine field
goals. He was in the game all the
time, playing equally as well on the
defensive as on the offensive. The
California squad was weak on foul
tossers, none of their five attempts
being successful.
Estes, Righter, and Sullivan were
the stars of the local quintet. Righter
negotiated for eighteen points. Estes'
foul shooting was a feature of the
game. He shot five fouls out of
seven tries. Previous to the game
Righter was elected captain of the
1919 basketball team. As a result of
last night's game six men will receive
their block '19s.
