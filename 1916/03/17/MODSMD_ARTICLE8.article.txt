## 
### 
H. H. Dievendorff, '17, may be the
cause of a smallpox epidemic on the
campus, if the present diagnosis of
his state is correct. Dievendorff was
found yesterday stricken with the
speckles, the effect of which was to
render him deaf and dumb.
The consequences of his illness
may prove serious. He has already
prevented a wedding which should
have taken [dace. But for the pres
ent, K. G. Whealton, '19, who was to
have been the lucky bridegroom, will
have to mourn the loss of the fair
Peggy Van Zant. The wedding was
postponed until the evening of the
30th of March. Fear of getting some
thing catching from Dievendorff drove
away six sober ministers who were
on hand for the ceremony.
Hence Dievy is "In Dutch," the six
ministers and the wedding principals
are likewise, and on that day of
March you can see for yourself that
the theatrical scarlet stick o' stick
iness can make Dievy look like a
whole epidemic.
