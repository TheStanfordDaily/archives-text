at a meeting in the Union on Tues

General Franklin Hell and Captain
Samuel A. Purvianee, retired, of the

Will Explain Details.
The men will be given definite in
formation as to the assistance they
may expect from the government, as
well as given an insight to the nature
of the work. To date the establish
ment of military drill at Stanford
has been purely a proposition pro
posed by students desirous of taking
part in the training. Should it be
established, it will be entirely op
tional for students of all classes.
I>r. Wilbur To Speak.
President Wilbur will also speak to
the men at tlie meeting, explaining
the attitude of the University toward
the proposed military training. As
now planned, the drill will be estab
lished if sufficient men sign up to
enroll in the work, and will be car
ried on similarly to the gymnasium
classes.
Interest in the establishment of mil
itary training on the campus has been
growing since the recent announce
ment that the matter was being con
sidered. Moth within the student
body and among civilians and army
men not connected with the Univer
sity there has been approval of the
proposed drill.
