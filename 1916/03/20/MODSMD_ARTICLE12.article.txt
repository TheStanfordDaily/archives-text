## HOUSE CAPTURES TEN POINTS First-Year Cardinals Overwhelm Team That Defeated U.C. Youngsters 
###

high school stars representing the
San Francisco Athletic League, by the
score of 71 1-3 to HO 2-3 points, in a
closely fought contest on the Stan
lord oval, last Saturday afternoon.
Though losers of the meet, the high
school stars took the majority of the
track events, scoring 42 of a possible
68 points to be made in the various
races. In the field events, the fresh
men had things their own way, win
ning 4f> 1-3 out of a possible. 54
points.
Set Good .Marks.
Wilcox, for the freshmen, and Slo
man, for San Francisco, shared the
honors for record performances, the
former clearing the bar at 12 feet in
the pole vault, and the latter taking
the 440-yard dash in 51 seconds, aside
from winning the 220-yard dash in
22 3-5 seconds. With but few ex
ceptions, the marks set in Saturday's
contest were better than those made
in the meet earlier in the week, when
the high school men defeated the Uni
versity of California freshmen.
House Wins Two Firsts.
House was Stanford's greatest point
winner, easily taking first place in
both hurdle races. Wark annexed
nine points with first in the 100-yard
dash, second in the 220-yard dash, and
third in the javelin throw. Wood
was the heaviest scorer of the field
men, taking first in the discus throw,
and second in the shot put. Other
freshmen who took firsts were Crosby
in the broad jump, Loomis in the shot
put, Wilcox in the pole vault, and
Curtice in the javelin throw, while
Foster and Williams, both freshmen,
tied for first in the high jump. The
I freshmen took nine first places of a
force, the only remaining first string
players in game being Mattel and
Campbell, the Stanford battery. The
Catholic college scored all of their
runs in the first inning, on five clean
hits and one error. Mel Shriver,
freshmen third-sacker, tallied the only
two scores made by the Cardinal,
smashing out two home runs. Both
hits were 011 the nose and good for
four cushions in any league. It hap
pened that the bases were unoccupied
on both occasions. Messick and Mit
chell got the only other hits gathered
by the first year players. Cowan
featured with some fast fielding, and
Messick set the fans going with four
stolen bases.

high school stars representing the
San Francisco Athletic League, by the
score of 71 1-3 to HO 2-3 points, in a
closely fought contest on the Stan
lord oval, last Saturday afternoon.
Though losers of the meet, the high
school stars took the majority of the
track events, scoring 42 of a possible
68 points to be made in the various
races. In the field events, the fresh
men had things their own way, win
ning 4f> 1-3 out of a possible. 54
points.
Set Good .Marks.
Wilcox, for the freshmen, and Slo
man, for San Francisco, shared the
honors for record performances, the
former clearing the bar at 12 feet in
the pole vault, and the latter taking
the 440-yard dash in 51 seconds, aside
from winning the 220-yard dash in
22 3-5 seconds. With but few ex
ceptions, the marks set in Saturday's
contest were better than those made
in the meet earlier in the week, when
the high school men defeated the Uni
versity of California freshmen.
House Wins Two Firsts.
House was Stanford's greatest point
winner, easily taking first place in
both hurdle races. Wark annexed
nine points with first in the 100-yard
dash, second in the 220-yard dash, and
third in the javelin throw. Wood
was the heaviest scorer of the field
men, taking first in the discus throw,
and second in the shot put. Other
freshmen who took firsts were Crosby
in the broad jump, Loomis in the shot
put, Wilcox in the pole vault, and
Curtice in the javelin throw, while
Foster and Williams, both freshmen,
tied for first in the high jump. The
I freshmen took nine first places of a
force, the only remaining first string
players in game being Mattel and
Campbell, the Stanford battery. The
Catholic college scored all of their
runs in the first inning, on five clean
hits and one error. Mel Shriver,
freshmen third-sacker, tallied the only
two scores made by the Cardinal,
smashing out two home runs. Both
hits were 011 the nose and good for
four cushions in any league. It hap
pened that the bases were unoccupied
on both occasions. Messick and Mit
chell got the only other hits gathered
by the first year players. Cowan
featured with some fast fielding, and
Messick set the fans going with four
stolen bases.

In their first track meet of the year,
Stanford freshmen defeated a team of
high school stars representing the
San Francisco Athletic League, by the
score of 71 1-3 to HO 2-3 points, in a
closely fought contest on the Stan
lord oval, last Saturday afternoon.
Though losers of the meet, the high
school stars took the majority of the
track events, scoring 42 of a possible
68 points to be made in the various
races. In the field events, the fresh
men had things their own way, win
ning 4f> 1-3 out of a possible. 54
points.
Set Good .Marks.
Wilcox, for the freshmen, and Slo
man, for San Francisco, shared the
honors for record performances, the
former clearing the bar at 12 feet in
the pole vault, and the latter taking
the 440-yard dash in 51 seconds, aside
from winning the 220-yard dash in
22 3-5 seconds. With but few ex
ceptions, the marks set in Saturday's
contest were better than those made
in the meet earlier in the week, when
the high school men defeated the Uni
versity of California freshmen.
House Wins Two Firsts.
House was Stanford's greatest point
winner, easily taking first place in
both hurdle races. Wark annexed
nine points with first in the 100-yard
dash, second in the 220-yard dash, and
third in the javelin throw. Wood
was the heaviest scorer of the field
men, taking first in the discus throw,
and second in the shot put. Other
freshmen who took firsts were Crosby
in the broad jump, Loomis in the shot
put, Wilcox in the pole vault, and
Curtice in the javelin throw, while
Foster and Williams, both freshmen,
tied for first in the high jump. The
I freshmen took nine first places of a
force, the only remaining first string
players in game being Mattel and
Campbell, the Stanford battery. The
Catholic college scored all of their
runs in the first inning, on five clean
hits and one error. Mel Shriver,
freshmen third-sacker, tallied the only
two scores made by the Cardinal,
smashing out two home runs. Both
hits were 011 the nose and good for
four cushions in any league. It hap
pened that the bases were unoccupied
on both occasions. Messick and Mit
chell got the only other hits gathered
by the first year players. Cowan
featured with some fast fielding, and
Messick set the fans going with four
stolen bases.
