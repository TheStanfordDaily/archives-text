# POUGHKEEPSIE CREW RACE SET FOR JUNE 17TH
## 
### 
June 17 was set as the date of the
1916 regatta of the Intercollegiate
Rowing Association at a meeting in
New York last Saturday. At that
; time it was also finally settled that
j the race will be held on the same
j course as that used last year, on the
Hudson, at Pouglikeepsie. Contrary
i to its decision of last year, the New
York Central railroad has agreed to
run observation trains along the
course of the race. This agreement
on the part of the railroad induced
the association to hold the race on
the same course.
Freshmen Awn it Report.
Cardinal freshmen are "up in the
air" over reports published in Sun
day's San Francisco papers to the
effect that the University of Wash
| ington freshmen will not be permitted
to meet the Stanford first-year men
on April 8. The reason given in the
reports is that the Washington fresh
men have been delinquent in scholar
ship, and thpt not enough interest has
been shown in the work of the crew.
Graduate Manager Hehrens has tele
graphed to Seattle to verify the re
port, but had received no answer this
afternoon.
