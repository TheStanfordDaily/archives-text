Songs for the general occasion rep
resent a need at Stanford. At the
older universities time has been an
element sufficient in itself to build up
a good body of songs of all kinds.
Given enough time the same thing
will be true of Stanford, but, in the
meantime, good songs of a certain
kind are lacking.
The attention of our lyric writers
has been directed toward furthering
the fighting spirit. As a result,, the
need in this field, which was real, has
been well met. But there are occas
ions when Stanford people get to
gether when California is not partic
ularly in mind, and yet the only vent
for our enthusiasm is a refrain with
the spirit "To perdition with the Blue
and Gold" running through the lines.
Other songs have been written and
some have merit, but they have not
been popularly received on the cam
pus. Perhaps the reason for this is
that they are not generally known.
Part of the work of the new song
committee will be to bring these
songs to the attention of the student
body as well as to stimulate activity
in writing new ones.
Experience has shown that the offer
of a prize is not the best method of
getting good songs submitted. In the
instances in the past when a shift in
the focus of our athletic vision has
suddenly necessitated new wordings
for our lyrics offer of cash rewards
for the best songs submitted have
not been productive of great results.
The songs that have lived are those
that were written for the love of Stan
ford.
The song committee is attempting
to point out the need for songs for
the general occasion at Stanford. It
is recognized that everyone of ability
will not be able to sit down at a
moment's notice to write the words or
music for such a song. Thinking
about it will help the inspiration to
come sooner.
