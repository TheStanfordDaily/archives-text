# All Students Are Urged to Contribute Stanford Songs
## 
### 
Representatives from dramatic and
musical organizations have met sev
eral times this semester for the pur
pose of creating interest in the com
position and adoption of new Stan
ford songs. The lack of songs with
true spirit, and without the fighting
attitude of the great majority of songs
familiar to the present generation
has been felt very keenly, especially
at banquets and other functions at
which the general bleacher song is
inappropriate.
The committee has not yet decided*
upon a prize to be given to the best
song writer. Its purpose is to com
bine the best songs already familiar
with the best new ones in a book to
be published near the close of the
semester. The songs appealing to
the committee will be introduced at
Assembly Hall productions. Maurice
Blumenthal, 'lfi, and Glen Hughes, 'Ifi,
have already submitted a song. Others
may be handed in to members of the
committee, who are as follows: W.
B. Curtis, '16, chairman; J. C. Cross,
•17, C. It. Wakefield, 'Ifi, Misses Eileen
Everett, '14, Mary Curry, *16, Margery
Bailey, '14, Mable Loop, '15, Mahle
Shellbach, *IG, and Anita Marcus, '17.
