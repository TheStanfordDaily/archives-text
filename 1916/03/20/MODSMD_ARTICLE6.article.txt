# CARDINAL NINE BREAKS EVEN IN SPEEDY DOUBLE-HEADER
## FAST BASEBALL DESPITE RAIN Varsity Defeats Fort Miley and Combined Squad Loses to St. Ignatius 
### 
Cardinal baseball teams broke even
in Saturday's double-header played
on the local grounds. The fast Fort
Miley aggregation went down to a 2
to 1 defeat at the hands of the var
sity in the opening contest, while the
St. Ignatius nine carried off a 4 to
2 victory over a combined varsity and
freshmen team in the second game
on the afternoon's schedule. Although
competing against a track meet and a
swimming meet, and bucking bad
weather during the greater part of
the time, the ball games attracted a
goodly number of bleacher enthusi
asts. Both contests were run off in
snappy style, three hours being the
total time.
Soldiers Make Itun.
The soldier team gathered their
only run off Draper in the first in
ning, on a double and a lucky triple.
The varsity scored only in the fifth
frame, and then sent two markers
across on a triple by Dent, a single
by Hensel, an error, and a single by
Sanborn. The only other bingle ob
tained by a Stanford bat waver was
a one-base clout by Stafford in the
third spasm. Draper pitched wonder
ful ball for the home team, allowing
but five well scattered hits, and fan
ning eleven. The fielding of Stafford
at short was a distinct feature of the
contest, while Schram's playing of the
first base sack for the visitors caused
favorable comment.
Combined Team Plays.
In the second tangle, the varsity
was sent to the field against the St.
Ignatius nine, but before the inning
was over, the freshmen team was
cavorting on the diamond in full
possible fourteen. The relay was an
easy victory for the high school run
ners. the freshmen being particularly
weak in distance men.
Kllll Fast 440 and Mile.
Two of the best races of the day
were the 440-yard dash, in which
Pelouze pressed Sloman to the limit,
and the mile run, in which Teitsworth
forced Fuller to complete the four-lap
run in 4:44 in order to win. Goep
pert, who ran the half-mile in 2:2 4-5,
was the only other high school man
to take a first place.
Individual Scores.
The individual scores made by
freshmen were as follows: House,
10; Wark, 9; Wood. 8; Curtice, 6;
Wilcox, 5; Crosby, 5; Loomis, 5; Fos
ter, 4; Williams, 4; Pelouze, 3; Teits
worth, 3; Davis, 3; .Tohannsen, 3;
Ferguson. 1; Wagner, 1; Boulware, 1,
and Anderson, 1-3.
Between the running off of the
Freshmen-All-Star events, informal
races and field events were held for
the varsity track men. In the var
sity mile run, Wilson clipped off the
four laps almost as fast as in last
year's Rig Meet, winning in 4:30 3-5.
In the 220-yard hurdles, Murray
equaled his record of 24 1-5 seconds.
In some events the mark made by the
varsity men did not equal that of
the freshmen and high school ath
letes. The best of the varsity events
was the relay, in which the team
composed of Zacliarias, Dievendorff,
Kirksey and Murray, was the winner.
