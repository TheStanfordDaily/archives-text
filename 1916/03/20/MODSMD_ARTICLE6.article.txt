# CARDINAL NINE BREAKS EVEN IN SPEEDY DOUBLE-HEADER
## FAST BASEBALL DESPITE RAIN Varsity Defeats Fort Miley and Combined Squad Loses to St. Ignatius 
### 
Cardinal baseball teams broke even

across on a triple by Dent, a single
by Hensel, an error, and a single by
Sanborn. The only other bingle ob

but five well scattered hits, and fan

at short was a distinct feature of the
contest, while Schram's playing of the
first base sack for the visitors caused
favorable comment.
Combined Team Plays.
In the second tangle, the varsity
was sent to the field against the St.
Ignatius nine, but before the inning
was over, the freshmen team was
cavorting on the diamond in full
