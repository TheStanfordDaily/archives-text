# San Jose Defeated by Freshman Nine
## 
### 
Stanford freshmen smeared the
San Jose State Normal team in a nine
inning baseball game Friday after
noon on the varsity diamond. The
final score stood 9 to 1 in favor of
the first-year tossers. A slight rain
fell during a great part of the con
test, but the "silent partner umpires,"
Hayes and Wickersham, refused to
call the affair. The visiting squad
was completely outclassed but put up
a good battle in the last few innings.
The freshmen were unable to fatten
their batting averages on the oppos
ing twirler, as they only slammed out
five hits. Their runs were made
mostly on errors.
The teams lined up in the follow
ing order: Freshmen —Boydston, p.;
Mitchell, c.; Mitchell, lb.; Messick,
2b.; Cowan, ss.; Shriver, 3b; Ryan,
If.; Lilly, cf., and Reagon, rf. Nor
mal—Litzenberg, p.; Lutzenmeyer, c.;
Smith, lb.; Kirby, 21).; Wideman, ss.;
Wauhab. 3b.; Jewitt, If.; Behmer, cf.,
and Trimble, rf.
