# Mission High Loses to Freshman Nine
## Many Features Characterize Easy Victory of Frosh Over Preps 
### 
Weird baseball was dished out to
the few fans who braved the cold to
witness yesterday's game between the
freshmen and Mission High School of
San Francisco. The merry-go-round
took place on the varsity diamond
alter the first string players had gone
through their daily workout. The
first-year tossers came out on the
long end of a 16 to 1 count after six
j innings of singles, doubles, triples,
walks, hit by pitcher, and other types
of our National Pastime.
Although they claim, and claim
loudly, a win over the California
freshmen by a 9 to 0 score, the op
posing squad did not have much on
Uie ball. They obtained but two bits
off Kaiser, and scored their lone tally
on a walk, two outs, and a fluke play.
Seven of the visiting bat swingers
went back to the bench by way of
the strikeout route. Also, there were
eleven miscues chalked up against
the fielding averages of said prep
school representatives.
F res lima n Features.
Features were many in the ranks
of the froth diamond experts. Two
triples by Shriver, a three-bagger by
Mitchell, and nine stolen bases were
the most noticeable of the feature
acts. Ryan's squeeze of Hoydston,
making up one-sixteenth of the final
score, was a.s pretty a piece of base
ball as has been shown to the fans
this season, while some excellent
base running by Messick finished the
eventful afternoon's slaughter.
The freshmen lined up in the fol
lowing order: Kaiser, p.; Mitchell
and Hawks, c.; Mitchell, lb.: Messick..
2b.: Shriver. ,Ib.; Cowan (captain),
ss.; Ryan, If.; Lilly, cf.. and Reagon
and Hoydston, rf. Hell umpired the
cricket match.
