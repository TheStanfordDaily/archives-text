The new constitution of student
government makes the unit of stu
dent government the proper unit —the
living group—that makes the repre
sentative of each unit the right rep
resentative —the executive officer of
the group. The relation of such a rep
resentative to the men who live in
the same house or hall with him is
such a relation that he can exercise
a real influence over them and if
necessary real control.

He is in position to know the men
ho represents in a way which he
could never expect to know the stu
dent whose only relation to him is
registration in the same department.

The method of selecting the new
Conference guarantees that that or
ganization will he a strong body of
men. There is probably no election
on the campus which is taken more
seriously than the election of execu
tive officers of Encina or the election
of a house president. The object is to
secure efficient executives —to elect
the man or men who can control
affairs more thoroughly and all other
considerations that enter in are rele
gated to the background.

The constitution places on these
men a duty to exercise the influence
or if necessary the control which
they are able to exercise by their po
sition and their personality in the in
terests of student government. It en
lists in the support of student govern
ment the men who are in position to
do student government most good.
Student government is entitled to the
services of these men if it's worth
keeping.
