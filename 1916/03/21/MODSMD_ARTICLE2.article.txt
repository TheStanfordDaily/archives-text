# Washington Babes Cancel Crew Race
## Scholastic Difficulties Cause Northerners to Call Off Freshman Match 
### 
University of Washington freshmen
will not meet the Stanford first-year
crew this year because of delinquent
scholarship on the part of the north
ern babes. This is the information
contained in a telegram from Fred A.
Lind, president of the Washington
Boat Club, received by Freshman
President It. J. Macdonald this morn
ing.
Later Date Not Suitable.
in his telegram, Lind suggests that
the race be postponed from April 8
to May 20, but as this later date is a
month after the close of the freshman
training season, it will be impossible
to hold the race on that date.
Several weeks ago, Lind wrote to
the Stanford freshmen suggesting that
the class send its crew to Lake Wash
ington at the same time that the
Cardinal varsity eight is to meet the
Washington team. The freshmen at
once acted on the suggestion, and set
about raisins funds for the proposed
trip. The class undertook to raise
$400, which, it.was estimated, would
be sufficient to cover all expenses.
To date the finance committee, under
the direction of PI. C. La Forge, has
succeeded in raising approximately
$200. This money will now bp re
turned to the contributors.
Lind's Telegram.
Lind's telegram is as follows:
President Freshman Class, Stanford
University, Cal.:
Due to unforseen scholastic diffi
culties that have developed here in
last few days, we find we will be un
able to have freshman race here on
April 8. Could you send crew north
for race on May?
FRED A. LIND.
