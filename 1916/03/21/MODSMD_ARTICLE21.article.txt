# WATER DESTROYS DESIGNS ON MEMORIAL CHURCH SLABS
## Ocean Waves Dissolve Glue That Holds Italian Mosaics Together 
### 
Five months ago, M. Salviati & Co.,
of Venice, Italy, saw with much pleas
ure and satisfaction his shipment of
mosaics leave his native land, bound
for the Stanford Memorial Church, in
a huge sea-going liner. At least Mr.
Salviati thought it was a sea-going
liner. However, a few days later,
when he heard that the traverser of
oceans had found a happy home be
neath the waves, he changed his mind
as to its sea-going abilities. Divers
got to work and many valuable things
were removed from the wreck, among
which were the several crates of mo
saics sent by Mr. Salviati, still visibly,
intact and seemingly little the worse
for their submarine voyage. Conse
quently they were again sent on their
journey, as if nothing had happened.
These mosaics had been neatly in
sorted into patterns by the deft hands
of Mr. Salviati & Co., before they ever
left his shop, and were in a condi
tion to be placed on the walls of the
church, in slabs or strips. Examina
tion on arrival found these thirty
thousand different hues, which had
been so neatly arranged into patterns,
jumbled together into a conglomera
tion of design and color. Needless to
say, the ocean waves had dissolved
th fine glue which held each mosaic,
thereby causing Mr. Salviati many
sleepless nights and much delay to
the completion of the Stanford Mem
orial Church.
