# SONG HITS FEATURE "IN DUTCH"
## 1917 Opera Promises to Be Clever Musical Show 
### 
If last night's Junior Opera rehear
sal is an indication of what "In
Dutch" will be on the evening of
March 30, it undoubtedly will be an
unqualified success. With the re
maining ten days in which to put on
the finishing touches it should be
without exception the best produced
and the cleverest musical show which
has ever hit the campus.
Foxy Chorus.
The chorus work is perfect. Every
idea is entirely new and none of the
worn-out, thread-bare steps are seen
which usually go hand in hand with
the amateur opera. All the choruses
are said to have different costumes In
both acts. The costumes have been
made especially for"In Dutch" by
Goldstein.
Song Hits Please.
The song "In Dutch," will be one
of the hits of the show. It is sung
by Bill King (R. G. Whealton), Tinker
Jones (Miss Angie Cross), and Wat
son (Dave Smith). Never has there
been anyone on the local stage who
can so well fill the part of the in
genue as does Miss Cross.
Peggy Van Zant sings the love
theme, "In June," with Bill King. It
is marvelously suited to the high so

prano voice of Miss Edith Harvey.
The leads are splendidly adapted to
their roles and have made their work
of professional caliber.
Miss Germaine Levy, '17, and C. F.
Joyce, '16, will make their debut on
the operatic stage with their song
"My Baby Blue Eyed Blonde." Mr.
Joyce as Scott, and Miss Levy as lone
Sinitliers, are supported by the best
chorus work in the show. Joyce is
especially good in his scene with the
deaf and dumb gardener.
.Miss Plloher lias Comedy Role.
The comedienne role is admirably
filled by Miss Velona Pilcher, '19,
whose work is worthy of the highest
praise. She is always ready to put
through any sort of game and even
the sudden advent of her supposedly
disposed of husband, Mr. Stammer
heim (P. Hearle, '18,), does not down
her spirit.
The scenery is something absolutely
new. The conservatory setting is of
the futurist design in blue and white.
The stage is greatly enlarged, owing
to the erection of the proscenium,
which makes it far better adapted to
the large chorus cast.
Seat sale will take place at usual
places, Thursday, March 23.

the finishing touches it should be
without exception the best produced
and the cleverest musical show which
has ever hit the campus.
Foxy Chorus.
The chorus work is perfect. Every
idea is entirely new and none of the
worn-out, thread-bare steps are seen
which usually go hand in hand with
the amateur opera. All the choruses
are said to have different costumes In
both acts. The costumes have been
made especially for"In Dutch" by
Goldstein.
Song Hits Please.
The song "In Dutch," will be one
of the hits of the show. It is sung
by Bill King (R. G. Whealton), Tinker
Jones (Miss Angie Cross), and Wat
son (Dave Smith). Never has there
been anyone on the local stage who
can so well fill the part of the in
genue as does Miss Cross.
Peggy Van Zant sings the love
theme, "In June," with Bill King. It
is marvelously suited to the high so

prano voice of Miss Edith Harvey.
The leads are splendidly adapted to
their roles and have made their work
of professional caliber.
Miss Germaine Levy, '17, and C. F.
Joyce, '16, will make their debut on
the operatic stage with their song
"My Baby Blue Eyed Blonde." Mr.
Joyce as Scott, and Miss Levy as lone
Sinitliers, are supported by the best
chorus work in the show. Joyce is
especially good in his scene with the
deaf and dumb gardener.
.Miss Plloher lias Comedy Role.
The comedienne role is admirably
filled by Miss Velona Pilcher, '19,
whose work is worthy of the highest
praise. She is always ready to put
through any sort of game and even
the sudden advent of her supposedly
disposed of husband, Mr. Stammer
heim (P. Hearle, '18,), does not down
her spirit.
The scenery is something absolutely
new. The conservatory setting is of
the futurist design in blue and white.
The stage is greatly enlarged, owing
to the erection of the proscenium,
which makes it far better adapted to
the large chorus cast.
Seat sale will take place at usual
places, Thursday, March 23.
