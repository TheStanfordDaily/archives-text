It's the old story of civilization and
progress.
Long before Stanford University
stood between the bay and the hills,
Domingo Qrasso built a cabin and a
barn on the summit of the little di
vide, half a dozen miles or so up the
road.
When the University was young, a
certain man found pleasure in hiking
with a maid to the cabin under the
weeping willows. They and the her
mit grew to be friends. Never a
month passed but what the man and
the maid spent an hour talking to the
gray-haired Italian. Not so long ago
the hermit died. But the news never
reached the man and the maid, a
thousand miles away.
The other day they returned.
"We're going up to the hermit's,"
they said to a friend.
"The hermit's dead!"
"Dead?"
"Died last year."
The man and the maid took the
long walk together. They thought at
first they had lost the road â€”then
charred timbers and the remains of
what had once been a bubbling spring
told them that civilization had been
heartless. Cattle grazing about told
why.
"Yes; the University destroyed the
place," the friend said. "I forgot to
tell you."
The man and the maid looked at
each other.
