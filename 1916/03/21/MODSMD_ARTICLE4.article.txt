# Freshmen Measured For Baseball Suits
## 
### 
Members of the freshmen baseball
squad were measured yesterday for
suits to be worn in the coming series
with the University of California
freshmen. The team will be clothed
in uniforms somewhat different from
those worn by the varsity teams of
the past. The material is white, with
a faint stripe running up and down,
resembling very much the Los An
geles Coast League suits, such as the
one worn by Coach Harry Wolter. rt
is not yet determined just what the
lettering will be on the suits, but it
is thought that the word Stanford in
cardinal letters across the front,
with the numeral below, would be
appropriate. Twelve suits will he or
dered by Graduate Manager Rehrens,
according to the measurements of the
players sent in yesterday.
