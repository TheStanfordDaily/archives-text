# Stanford Meets St. Mary's Nine in Second Game
## 
### 
Mid-week baseball bordering on
league caliber should be played on
the Cardinal diamond tomorrow after
noon, when the varsity team from St.
Mary's crosses sticks with the Stan
ford varsity. This will be the second
meeting of the two teams this season,
the tirst contest resulting in a 2 to 2
tie score at the end of nine hotly
played innings. Umpire Jack Mc-
Carthy will announce the batteries
promptly at 4:15, season tickets or
twenty-five cents admitting the fol
lowers of the diamond sport at the
gate.
Stanford Lineup ( nchanged.
Stanford will take the field in the
same order that Captain "Rabe" Dent
has been having the men play for the
past two weeks. It is not known at
this time just who the shoVer will
be, but according to the regular turn
in the box of the local pitchers,
Hoever is about due to start. Dent
will be on the receiving end as usual,
Hayes will scoop them out of the dirt
at first base, T-Tensel and Stafford will
play on each side of the second sack,
while Stevens will complete the in
field at third. The gardens will be
well taken care of by Sanborn, Land
er, Noonan, and Wickersham.
St. Mary's Weakened.
St. Mary's lost a big part of their
team when Guisto, the giant first
sacker, stayed in the north, last week,
to start his professional career with
the Portland Coast Leaguers. Maher,
Wilson, Hamilton, Lutge, Carpenter,
Moy. Haker, Maroni, Collins, and
Brandan will make up the opposing
team in the game tomorrow.
Coach Harry Wolter believes that,
the varsity is in the best shape that
it. has been thus far this season. The
men have been out daily, gojng
through hard practices, and have
learned a lot of baseball'in the last
few weeks. They are in good condi
tion to meet any gang of ball tossers,
even the fast St. Mary's contingent,
and should give the opposition a hard
contest. The game on the docket for
Wednesday will undoubtedly be one
of the classiest tangles of the year,
and Graduate Manager llehrens ex
pects an overflowing crowd if good
weather conditions prevail.
