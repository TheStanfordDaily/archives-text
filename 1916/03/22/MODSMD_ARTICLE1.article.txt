# MEN AND WOMEN UNITE IN DEBATING PEP RALLY
## VETERANS RETURN TO BOOST Women Should Enter Debates, Says Miss Fraser, '00, of Oakland High School 
### 
For the first time in the history of
Stanford, both men and women of the
University united in a debating rally,
last evening, in the Union. Although
there was no yell leader to direct the
enthusiasm, the rally spirit prevailed
both in the talks by the old-time de
haters, and in the attitude of the
audience.
The outstanding feature of the eve
ning was the talk by Miss Anna G.
Fraser, *00, now vice-president of the
Oakland High School. She began with
the statement that to her, the unsys
tematic "good old days" did not seem
as good as the present state of af
fairs. In a delightful way. she "rem
inisced" about her own forensic ex
periences, and emphasized the help an
audience can be to a debater. She
closed with two pleas: the first, for
students to attend debates; the sec
ond, for women to take an active part
in debating. She advocated the form
ation of a women's debating society at
Stanford.
Dr. Stolz Urges Open Forum.
Dr. H. R. Stolz, men's physical di
rector, spoke on "Debating at Stan
ford and Tts Possibilities," bringing
out the value of debating in creating
in a student the ability to express his
ideas clearly. He urged the establish
ment of an Open Forum of all Stan
ford students at frequent periods in
the Union.
Professor A. M. Cathcart, '90. of the
Law school, said "The man who can
debate is the mail who can influence
his fellow men, and, sometimes,
women. The man who succeeds in
debating has got something he can
carry away from college with him."
He urged Stanford men and. women
to support debating by their presence
at forensic contests.
Explains Credit System.
The system of giving University
credit for every phase of debating ac
tivity was explained by Associate Pro
fessor L. E. Hassett, '01, who spoke of
the benefit to be derived from de
bating as a mental discipline, and
praised the debaters for their stead
fastness in overcoming discouraging
conditions. W. F. Herron, 'OS, told of
old-time conditions in intercollegiate
debating.
K. E. Leib, '15, chairman of the
Stanford intercollegiate debating com
mittee, and debating coach, gave a
brief word of encouragement to the
men of the Tri-State and Oarnot
teams.
Friday night Stanford will meet the
University of Washington orators in
the chapel, and the Oregon platform
artists at Eugene, in the annual Tri-
State battle. The Carnot will be held
at the University of California, April
14th.
