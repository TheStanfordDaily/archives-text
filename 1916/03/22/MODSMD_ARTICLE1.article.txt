# MEN AND WOMEN UNITE IN DEBATING PEP RALLY
## VETERANS RETURN TO BOOST Women Should Enter Debates, Says Miss Fraser, '00, of Oakland High School 
### 
For the first time in the history of
Stanford, both men and women of the
University united in a debating rally,
last evening, in the Union. Although
there was no yell leader to direct the
enthusiasm, the rally spirit prevailed
both in the talks by the old-time de
haters, and in the attitude of the
audience.
The outstanding feature of the eve
ning was the talk by Miss Anna G.
Fraser, *00, now vice-president of the
Oakland High School. She began with
the statement that to her, the unsys
tematic "good old days" did not seem
as good as the present state of af
fairs. In a delightful way. she "rem
inisced" about her own forensic ex
periences, and emphasized the help an
audience can be to a debater. She
closed with two pleas: the first, for
students to attend debates; the sec
ond, for women to take an active part
in debating. She advocated the form
ation of a women's debating society at
Stanford.
