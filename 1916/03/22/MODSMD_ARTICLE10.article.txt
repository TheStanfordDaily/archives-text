# Give Arguments Why Proposed Change Should Be Ratified
## 
### 
The following statements from mem
bers of the Student Affairs Committee
and student body who are in a posi
tion to know, give some of the argu
ments why the proposed constitution
for a reorganized Conference should
be adopted Friday:
luiil Stanit'ord, *14>.
The new constitution will, if adopt
ed, carry student control to the living
groups, where it belongs. The mem
bers of the Conference Council will be
the most responsible men in the vari
ous groups.
Under the present scheme, the work
of student government has run largely
to discipline, A much better cure for
our community ailments is that leg
endary ounce of prevention.
If the student body sanctions a rep
resentative Conference and Council,
with definite administrative duties,
and requires each student to fill a
citizen's shoes, student government
will soon be able to sit up and take
nourishment.
>V. F. \ooiian, '!(».
Under the present system, the Uni
versity Conference is inefficient and
useless. This condition is not attrib
utable in any sense to the personnel
and membership of past or present
Conferences, but is due to the faulty
method of selection and representa
tion; there is a total lack of respon
sibility and co-operation between the
members of the departmental units
which they represent, and this is fatal
to the purposes for which the Con
ference was created.
The new constitution was drafted to
remedy these defects, and under it the
Conference will be given the organ
ization and power necessary to make
it a success, and for this reason, the
adoption of tlie proposed constitution
cannot be too strongly urged.
Professor I>. .M. Folsoni.
Every student who votes on the
question of ratification of the new
constitution proposed by the Confer
ence, should realize its adoption
means real student government. It
means student government with def
inite responsibility, and a strong or
ganization to enforce responsibility.
There can be no question as to the
sincerity of a mail's desire for self
government if he votes for the pro
visions of the new charter.
O. 11. Castle.
Good intentions alone won't get stu
dent control; we must have an ef
ficient machine. We can't win out on
one cylinder and a fiat wheel. The
proposed constitution is based on a
scientific principle—that of fixed re
sponsibility. It is the most carefully
worked out scheme ever submitted to
students here, and contains only the
results of experience and sound
thought of those interested in stu
dent government, with nothing of a
visionary nature.
(*. A. J a com in 1, '15.
The new constitution or the Student.
Conference is an improvement over
the old one because it gives represen
tation to a group that needs and will
use this representation. It does not
give, as the old one did, representa
tion to a group, which as a group,
cares nothing about student govern
ment. Any constitution that will in
sure regular attendance to all Con
ference meetings is an improvement
over the present one.
Professor C. A. Huston.
The new constitution seems to me a
courageous and able document. It
recognizes clearly the difficulties
which the experience of its authors
has disclosed to them in the working
of student government. Its plan for
representation seems to me clearly su
perior to the present one. Its speci
fications of the powers and duties of
the different organs of student govern
ment are clear and reasonable. It
embodies a high ideal of what student
conduct should be and a clear con
ception of a plan for achieving this
Ideal, so far as organization can be
effective toward this end. As a be
liever in the possibilities of student
self-government, I should be very glad
to see this constitution adopted, for T
am convinced that it would be a very
great factor in making such govern
ment a genuine and permanent suc
cess.
F. S. Murray, '16.
I think the proposed constitution
for a reorganized Conference will do
away with a lot of the evils of the
present system of student government,
and will provide the necessary qual
ities which are now' lacking for suc
cess. The new basis of representa
tion is the best thing about it, but I
like other phases such as compulsory
attendance and the personal account
ability of the members.
C. 11. Orme, '16.
It must be quite clear to everyone
in the college community that the
present system of student government'
is not efficient or successful. In order
to retain self-government and make a
success of it.the new constitution has
been drawn up. Tt is full and com
plete in every particular. If self-gov
ernment means anything to Stanford
men, they must act at once and ac
cept the new system.
<. M. Miller, '14.
The constitution upon which the
present organization of student gov
ernment is based is pitifully inade
quate. No group of officers elected

under it, though they be of the most
able eliaraetor, can hope to attain a
very high degree of efficiency. The
fault does not lie so much in the
men elected to administer student gov
ernment as in the system that has
been in force. Under the proposed
constitution, these defects are sought,
to be cured by a system which dele
gates responsibility to those naturally
qualified to receive it.

bers of the Student Affairs Committee
and student body who are in a posi

be adopted Friday:
luiil Stanit'ord, *14>.
The new constitution will, if adopt
ed, carry student control to the living
groups, where it belongs. The mem
bers of the Conference Council will be
the most responsible men in the vari
ous groups.
Under the present scheme, the work
of student government has run largely
to discipline, A much better cure for
our community ailments is that leg
endary ounce of prevention.
If the student body sanctions a rep
resentative Conference and Council,
with definite administrative duties,
and requires each student to fill a
citizen's shoes, student government
will soon be able to sit up and take
nourishment.

Under the present system, the Uni
versity Conference is inefficient and
useless. This condition is not attrib
utable in any sense to the personnel
and membership of past or present
Conferences, but is due to the faulty
method of selection and representa
tion; there is a total lack of respon
sibility and co-operation between the
members of the departmental units
which they represent, and this is fatal
to the purposes for which the Con
ference was created.
The new constitution was drafted to
remedy these defects, and under it the
Conference will be given the organ
ization and power necessary to make
it a success, and for this reason, the
adoption of tlie proposed constitution
cannot be too strongly urged.

Every student who votes on the
question of ratification of the new
constitution proposed by the Confer
ence, should realize its adoption
means real student government. It
means student government with def
inite responsibility, and a strong or
ganization to enforce responsibility.
There can be no question as to the
sincerity of a mail's desire for self
government if he votes for the pro
visions of the new charter.

Good intentions alone won't get stu
dent control; we must have an ef
ficient machine. We can't win out on
one cylinder and a fiat wheel. The
proposed constitution is based on a
scientific principle—that of fixed re
sponsibility. It is the most carefully
worked out scheme ever submitted to
students here, and contains only the
results of experience and sound
thought of those interested in stu
dent government, with nothing of a
visionary nature.

The new constitution or the Student.
Conference is an improvement over
the old one because it gives represen
tation to a group that needs and will
use this representation. It does not
give, as the old one did, representa
tion to a group, which as a group,
cares nothing about student govern
ment. Any constitution that will in
sure regular attendance to all Con
ference meetings is an improvement
over the present one.
Professor C. A. Huston.
The new constitution seems to me a
courageous and able document. It
recognizes clearly the difficulties
which the experience of its authors
has disclosed to them in the working
of student government. Its plan for
representation seems to me clearly su
perior to the present one. Its speci
fications of the powers and duties of
the different organs of student govern
ment are clear and reasonable. It
embodies a high ideal of what student
conduct should be and a clear con
ception of a plan for achieving this
Ideal, so far as organization can be
effective toward this end. As a be
liever in the possibilities of student
self-government, I should be very glad
to see this constitution adopted, for T
am convinced that it would be a very
great factor in making such govern
ment a genuine and permanent suc
cess.
F. S. Murray, '16.
I think the proposed constitution
for a reorganized Conference will do
away with a lot of the evils of the
present system of student government,
and will provide the necessary qual
ities which are now' lacking for suc
cess. The new basis of representa
tion is the best thing about it, but I
like other phases such as compulsory
attendance and the personal account
ability of the members.

qualified to receive it.
The following statements from mem
bers of the Student Affairs Committee
and student body who are in a posi
tion to know, give some of the argu
ments why the proposed constitution
for a reorganized Conference should
be adopted Friday:
luiil Stanit'ord, *14>.
The new constitution will, if adopt
ed, carry student control to the living
groups, where it belongs. The mem
bers of the Conference Council will be
the most responsible men in the vari
ous groups.
Under the present scheme, the work
of student government has run largely
to discipline, A much better cure for
our community ailments is that leg
endary ounce of prevention.
If the student body sanctions a rep
resentative Conference and Council,
with definite administrative duties,
and requires each student to fill a
citizen's shoes, student government
will soon be able to sit up and take
nourishment.
>V. F. \ooiian, '!(».
Under the present system, the Uni
versity Conference is inefficient and
useless. This condition is not attrib
utable in any sense to the personnel
and membership of past or present
Conferences, but is due to the faulty
method of selection and representa
tion; there is a total lack of respon
sibility and co-operation between the
members of the departmental units
which they represent, and this is fatal
to the purposes for which the Con
ference was created.
The new constitution was drafted to
remedy these defects, and under it the
Conference will be given the organ
ization and power necessary to make
it a success, and for this reason, the
adoption of tlie proposed constitution
cannot be too strongly urged.
Professor I>. .M. Folsoni.
Every student who votes on the
question of ratification of the new
constitution proposed by the Confer
ence, should realize its adoption
means real student government. It
means student government with def
inite responsibility, and a strong or
ganization to enforce responsibility.
There can be no question as to the
sincerity of a mail's desire for self
government if he votes for the pro
visions of the new charter.
O. 11. Castle.
Good intentions alone won't get stu
dent control; we must have an ef
ficient machine. We can't win out on
one cylinder and a fiat wheel. The
proposed constitution is based on a
scientific principle—that of fixed re
sponsibility. It is the most carefully
worked out scheme ever submitted to
students here, and contains only the
results of experience and sound
thought of those interested in stu
dent government, with nothing of a
visionary nature.

The new constitution or the Student.
Conference is an improvement over
the old one because it gives represen
tation to a group that needs and will
use this representation. It does not
give, as the old one did, representa
tion to a group, which as a group,
cares nothing about student govern
ment. Any constitution that will in
sure regular attendance to all Con
ference meetings is an improvement
over the present one.
Professor C. A. Huston.
The new constitution seems to me a
courageous and able document. It
recognizes clearly the difficulties
which the experience of its authors
has disclosed to them in the working
of student government. Its plan for
representation seems to me clearly su
perior to the present one. Its speci
fications of the powers and duties of
the different organs of student govern
ment are clear and reasonable. It
embodies a high ideal of what student
conduct should be and a clear con
ception of a plan for achieving this
Ideal, so far as organization can be
effective toward this end. As a be
liever in the possibilities of student
self-government, I should be very glad
to see this constitution adopted, for T
am convinced that it would be a very
great factor in making such govern
ment a genuine and permanent suc
cess.
F. S. Murray, '16.
I think the proposed constitution
for a reorganized Conference will do
away with a lot of the evils of the
present system of student government,
and will provide the necessary qual
ities which are now' lacking for suc
cess. The new basis of representa
tion is the best thing about it, but I
like other phases such as compulsory
attendance and the personal account
ability of the members.
C. 11. Orme, '16.
It must be quite clear to everyone
in the college community that the
present system of student government'
is not efficient or successful. In order
to retain self-government and make a
success of it.the new constitution has
been drawn up. Tt is full and com
plete in every particular. If self-gov
ernment means anything to Stanford
men, they must act at once and ac
cept the new system.
<. M. Miller, '14.
The constitution upon which the
present organization of student gov
ernment is based is pitifully inade
quate. No group of officers elected

under it, though they be of the most
able eliaraetor, can hope to attain a
very high degree of efficiency. The
fault does not lie so much in the
men elected to administer student gov
ernment as in the system that has
been in force. Under the proposed
constitution, these defects are sought,
to be cured by a system which dele
gates responsibility to those naturally
qualified to receive it.
