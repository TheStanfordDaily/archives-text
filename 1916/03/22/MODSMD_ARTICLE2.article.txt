# March Sequoia Will Be Ready Tomorrow
## Prize Story by Miss Beatrice Brasefield Is Character Study 
### J. C. Cross, '17 
If you are on the lookout for a flash
of real humor, with an indisputably
professional touch, you cannot afford
to miss Lansing Warren's "Superman
and Superwoman," in the March Se
quoia. This enigmatic title exhales
serious suggestions of Shavian phil
osophy, and latter-day thought. A
casual reference to the text, however,
reveals that it is the name of a bril
liant satire on modern drama. Evi
dently the same spirit that moved
Percy MacKaye to write his "Anti-
Matrimony" influenced Warren to pen
his "maudlin medley," for it reflects
the same delightful appreciation of
Shaw and Ibsen, with here and there
a pungent epigram in the character
istic Wilde style. In "Superman and
Superwoman" Warren gives a wider
promise than its own rich fulfillment
of unusual humor and individuality
to come.
\Â»m> Writer Contributes.
"Sarah TMefenderfer, Feminist," the
Sequoia's prize story, introduces Miss
Beatrice Rrasefleld as a Stanford
writer. It is primarily a character
study, with the merest sugar-coating
of narrative. The unusual, the fan
tastic, the prodigious, may appeal for
a time to our imagination but .after
all. our interest in any bit of fiction
is in almost direct ratio to our power
to visualize it. Whether or not a
Sarah Diefenderfer ever came into
your experience you will find the tang
of the essentially human in her story.
Miss Brasefield has actually woven the
advanced spirit of feminism into the
warp and woof of a capital narrative
of the Pennsylvania Dutch.
Military Question Discussed.
R. A. Griffin is nndeniably effective
in his timely article on military train
ing at Stanford, entitled, "Will We
Accept the Challenge?" The writer's
characteristically vigorous style leaves
110 doubt that the question of military
education is here and that it must
be decided one way or another.
Since fiction has taken the place of
poetry as a criticism of life, and made
all knowledge its province, it is only
natural that G. Charles Hodges should
voice his economic philosophy in that
form. Governmental shirking of so
cial responsibility is his theme in"The
One-Legged Man and the Others."
Hodges has taken a big, basic national
problem to fill the background of his
canvas, and, against it has thrown a
sharply defined personal tragedy in
bold relief.
Comedy in Sketch Rook.
The proposed elimination of the
Graphic Art department and current
Stanford phraseology are treated edi
torially. Miss Anita Allen and Robert
Donaldson furnish amusing incidents
of life's little comedies in the "Sketch
Rook."
"The Call of the Trail," by Miss
Lisette Fast, is a pleasing and appro
priate bit of prose, though it would
be more effective in free verse. Miss
Fast should become a disciple of Whit
man.
Ceroid Robinson's verses are the
only poetic contributions of profes
sional standard or maturity. "That
is His" is Kiplingesque in appeal.
Simplicity and perfect form lend it
distinction. "Love at Dusk" is faulty
in poetic form. Instead of a sensuous
appeal in the last two lines of each
stanza one finds a decidedly unpleas
ant effect. "Monterey" is an impres
sionist frontispiece.
