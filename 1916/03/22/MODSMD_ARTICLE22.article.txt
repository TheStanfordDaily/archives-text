# VARSITY GOES TO AGNEWS THURSDAY
## Freshman Nine Will Meet Affiliated Colleges on Varsity Diamond 
### 
Two baseball games will be played
tomorrow by Cardinal teams. The
varsity will again journey to Agnews
to meet the fast State Hospital ag
gregation, while the freshmen will
line up against the nine representing
the Affiliated Colleges, on the varsity
diamond. The latter contest is billed
for 4:15, sharp, season tickets or the
usual twenty-five cents gaining admis
sion.
Stanford gets excellent practice in
the game with the Agnews team. The
hospital contingent plays speedy ball,
and as the players are mostly men of
professional baseball experience, the
varsity gains much knowledge of the
finer points in these contests. Bert
Lynn, the wonderful catcher of the
opposing squad, has left for the East,
where he will be in training with the
Chicago White Sox. His loss will be
keenly felt by Agnews, but with such
men as Koehn, Cress, Kohner, Lackey,
Lamarra, Esola, T. Lynn, Bartlett, and
McGregor in the lineup, they should
show the Cardinal pill heavers some
competition.
So Chan pre In Lineup.
Captain Dent will take the same
team away that played against St.
Mary's today. Coach Harry Wolter
finds that the new combination is
working in fine order, and contem
plates no change at present. Wicker
sham and Draper are in splendid con
dition, and when Hoever and Howe
round into form, the varsity will not
lack mound artists. The remainder of
the team is as follows: Dent, c.;
Hayes, lb.; Hensel, 2b.; Stevens, 3b.;
Stafford and Braden, ss.; Sanborn and
Bihlman, If.: Lander, cf., and Noonan,
rf.
Freshmen lit Top Form.
The strength of the team from the
Affiliated Colleges is not known. They
have played but few games, but have
won a majority of their starts so far
this season. The freshmen are in ton
form now and will be able to show
the local fans baseball as A. G. Spauld
ing's books say it should be played.
Captain Cowan will start the same
nine men that have cavorted on the
diamond for the first-year class all
through the season. Peterson and
Kaiser will be on hand for box duty,
Mitchell and Hawks will be behind
the log. Mitchell will hold down first,
Messick will handle the pegs at the
keystone station, Shriver will cover
third, while Cowan will round out the
infield at shortstop. Ryan, Lilly, Rea
gon, and Boydston will pick off the
high ones in the outfield.
