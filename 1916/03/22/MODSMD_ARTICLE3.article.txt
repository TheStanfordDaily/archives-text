### 
Drawings for the seat sale for"In
Dutch" will take place tomorrow at
1:10, and the tickets will go on sale
immediately afterward. The drawing
will occur at both Weingartner's and
the Bookstore. Never before has

side demand makes it imperative for
campus people to get their tickets
promptly.
Rehearsals show that the members
of the cast have their parts down
perfectly. Those who participate in
the wedding of Miss Edith Harvey and
R. G. Whealton take their parts so
well that previous real experience is
indicated. The bridesmaids go
through the ceremony without the
customary nervousness and the best
man never fails to give the ring to
the groom at (he right time in the
"Syncopated Wedding Service."
Peggy Van Zant's entrance song,
written by H. D. Fansler, '19, one of
the opera writers, is a wonder. The
scenic effects at the time of her en
trance are among the best of the
whole opera. "Peggy" comes onto the
stage accompanied by hef dog, her
only friend since she left boarding
school, in the midst of a rain and
thunder storm and requests a job from
her real father.
