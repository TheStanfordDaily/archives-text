### 
Herbert Clark Hoover, Stanford '95,
receives high praise for his work as
director of the Commission for the
Relief of Belgium, which is known as
"C. R. R." in Europe, in the "Rook of
Belgium's Gratitude," published un
der the patronage of King Albert of
Relgium.
Chevalier E. Carton do Wiart, hon
orary secretary of the King of the
Belgians, and a member of the pub
lication committee of this book, pays
Hoover the following unqualified
tribute:
"One name among them must shine
with a peculiar luster, that of Herbert
Hoover, who, by his will of iron, his
prodigous energy and his genius for
organization, and with his deeply
charitable heart, has successfully
conducted the vast enterprise through
difficulties—diplomatic, financial, ma
terial. personal—by which any other
man must have been defeated. He
has been admirably helped by his col
leagues, and he is the first to give
them all the praise which they de
serve; but it is his wonderful per
sonally which has. from the first
day, galvanized this creation of a
moment and gripped the confidence
of a world."
