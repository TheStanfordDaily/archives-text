Student opinion on the proposed
constitution for a better Conference
was well expressed in the assembly
this morning. While every one who
spoke favored the adoption of the in
strument, and the great majority had
no criticisms whatever to offer, a few
men suggested possible drawbacks in
some of the clauses. These were an
swered in a seemingly satisfactory
manner by President Miller and mem
bers of the reorganization commit
tee.
Reasons for Adoption.
Those who favor the adoption of
the constitution presented strong ar
guments and good reasons for their
stand. The utter inefficiency of the
present organization of student gov
ernment, and the need of some work
able plan to take its place if the men
are to retain the reigns of that gov
ernment, were emphasized. "Student
control should be out of the experi
mental stage, but it isn't," said one
speaker, "ft is structurally at fault.
Its system of representation is wrong,
and it has only legislative and no ad
ministrative power. The burden of
government is all on the Council with
the present system. This new con
stitution will correct these faults and
make up the deficiencies."
Three Changes Made.
Three changes, submitted by thr>
Conference committee on reorganiza
tion, of which Paul Staniford, '16, is
chairman, have been made in the
original draft of the constitution, to
clear up some ambiguities which were
brought to the notice of the com
mittee. The first of these is in the
preamble, which has been changed
from, "We, the students of Leland
Stanford Junior University," to "We,
the men students."
The second is in Article 3 of the
Conference Duties and Powers, sub
division b of Section 1, dealing with
manner of amendment. Added to the
clause giving the Conference power
to amend by a three-fourths vote o!"
its members, is the following: "The
constitution may also be amended by
a majority vote of three-fourths of
the men of the student body, after
publication of the proposed amend
ment in The Daily Palo Alto. Any
male student may be authorized to
direct the president of the Confer
ence to call a constitutional elec
tion."
< 21 in ]miB Correspondents.
The third change is in regard to
campus correspondents, Article 3 of
I the Council, Duties and Powers, Sec
tion 2, subdivision g. This is changed
to read "The Council shall have
i power to punish any student corre
i spondent of any publication who
! sends out an untruthful story con-
J cerning the University or any of its
i members. 'Untruthful' shall be inter-
I preted to mean untruthful either in
I fact or inference."
Criticism Offered.
One criticism was registered on the
absolute power to dissolve organiza
tions for debt. Miller answered this
objection by pointing out that this
power is to be used only in the last
extremity. "If an organization is in
debt," he said, "that alone will be
no reason for expulsion. But if it
makes no effort to improve its condi
tion, then the power of the Confer
ence will apply."
Other objections were in regard to
the representation of non-fraternity
men on the rows and the small rep
resentation for men living in Palo
Alto and other places off the cam
pus. In regard to the first of these,
Miller answered that the non-fratern
ity row men can secure representa
tion by organizing into some sort of
club with officers which the Confer
ence may hold responsible.
As to the off-campus men, it was
pointed out that the Conference has
very little influence on them, and
that ten men could do no more than
two with the scattered condition.
Furthermore, these men will be
brought on the conipus with the erec
tion of new dormitories, representa
tion for which is provided in the
constitution.
Encina is given seven members
with two votes each in preference to
fourteen men because seven is the
number of the Board of Directors
and president in whom the power
and responsibility is concentrated.
Final decision will be made by the
vote on the Quad tomorrow. The of
ficials for the election follow: 11:15
to 12:15— W. H. Stammer, '14, G. A.
Jacomini, '15, ,T. V. Wood, *16, H.

Williams, *16, H. L. Loud,' '14, N. W.

R. E. Needham is in charge of the
election, which will last from 11:15
to 2:00. All men can vote regardless
of the number of hours they have, or
whether they hold a student body
ticket.
