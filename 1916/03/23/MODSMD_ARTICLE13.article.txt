# "In Dutch" Tickets Go Like Hot Cakes
## Dress Rehearsal Wednesday For Those Who Are Unable to Remain For Opera 
### 
A successful Junior Opera was fore
casted today by the crowd of ticket
buyers for"In Dutch." "Standing
room only" looms up as a probabil
ity. At 12 o'clock people were al
ready in line in both l'alo Alto and
on the campus.
An imported symphony orchestra
of eight pieces will be combined with
local talent, in order to have a larger
orchestra and a more varied number
of instruments, which are necessary
for the interpretation of many of the
musical numbers.
Dress rehearsals will be held every
evening next week, in order that the
cast may become accustomed to the
entire orchestra. All persons who
are unable to remain over for the
opera on Thursday evening will be
admitted to the last dress rehearsal
on Wednesday evening. An admis
sion of fifty cents will be characed.
