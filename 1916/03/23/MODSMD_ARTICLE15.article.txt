# Our Magna Charta

### 
The objection to the financial
clause in the constitution of student
government must be considered in the
light of other considerations than de
sirability of such a clause at first
sight. Student government involves
more than the privilege of self-gov
ernment for the student body—it in
volves the duty of governing as well.
Student government was granted to
the students of the University by the
president. The power to enforce dis
cipline in all student affairs was in
cluded in this delegation of powers.
If the students themselves tie the
hands of the Council now so that one
of the powers granted cannot be ex
ercised —we mean the right to act in
case of flagrant breach of financial
obligations—that, power will auto
matically revert to the president.
* * * *
The duty to enforce financial obli
gations rests with the Student Coun
cil at present. It is being exercised
by the present body. The new con
stitution does not broaden that power,
but it does put it down in black and
white so that it will be obvious where
the power lays and designates the
manner in which it can be exer
cised.
The new Council will be no more
of a bill collecting agency for Palo
Alto merchants than the present
Council is. In the usual course of
procedure, bills come to the presi
dent's office and are turned over to
the Student Adviser or the Student
Council. Each case involves a ques
tion of fact. If it is found on inves
tigation that the matter is purely one
which should be decided by the stu
dent and merchant no action is taken.
This is the result in nine-tenths of
the cases.
♦ * * *
The only case in which the Coun
cil acts is where a student is not
acting in good faith and the good
name of the campus community is
liable to be dragged in the dust if the
matter is not settled. Such a case is
that of a "rounder" who has heavy
financial obligations, is spending
money freely and is making no at
tempt to meet his obligations. Only
where an analogous state of affairs
exists is the financial problem of an
organization interfered with.
The duty to enforce such obliga
tions cannot run wild. Tt must be
centered in some student organization
or it will remain with the president.
It is for the student to decide whether
he prefers to have that power placed
in the Student. Council.
One more fact may be brought out
concerning the representation from
the rooming houses on the campus.
Article I. Section 3, reads: "A
standing committee shall be appoint
ed * * * to pass upon the credentials
of applicants for membership in the
Conference. The committee shall
prepare a list of the groups which
are entitled to representation, and
shall see that each qualified group is
represented at all times."
As explained at this morning's as
sembly, any living group of sufficient
size is qualified to organize. But the
above clause adds to this. The elec
tion committee of the Conference will

be in position to require such a group
of men to organize and elect a rep
resentative. This is in keeping with
the keyword of the constitution—"Re
sponsibility." Every group of men
will be required to send a representa
tive to the Conference, who will be
responsible for that group.
