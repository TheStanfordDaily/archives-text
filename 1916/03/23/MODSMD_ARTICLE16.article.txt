# Double Plays
## 
### 
A high class exhibition of the na
tional pastime was given those who
stayed on the bleachers yesterday af
ternoon. Both the St. Marys contin
gent and the varsity played in top
form, and although the diamond was
wet from a shower that temporarily
halted the contest in the third inning,
excellent plays were pulled off. Coach
Harry Wolter has his men working
the squeeze play in machine-like
fashion.
—o —
Hensel is putting up a fine game
around the second sack. He is field
ing in good style, and although he
still has a tendency to throw the
pill away, his all-around work is
causing much favorable comment. He
is meeting the ball regularly, too,
which counts probably more than
anything else. He connected for two
bingles in the St. Marys tangle.
—o —
Left field is a position that is the
subject of great speculation among
the local diamond followers. .Tust
who will fill the berth in the Big
Series is hard to dope, Sanborn and
Bihlman being the two best outfield
ers out for the job so far. Bihlman's
hitting has given him the edge lately.
—o —
Captain "Babe" Dent is still run
ning the bases in major league style.
He is leading the team in pilfered
sacks. Hayes still leads the hitters,
with Dent, Stevens, Stafford, Hensel,
and Bihlman standing high in the av
erages.
