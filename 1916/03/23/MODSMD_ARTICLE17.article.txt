PALO ALTO ItEI'KESEN'I ATIVES.
When the talkers had all finished
talking at this morning's assembly,
some of us were still unable to see
why two-thirds of the student body
should rule the other third. By the
terms of the new constitution the
five hundred students who live off
the campus are to have two repre
sentatives in the Conference, while
the nine hundred who are so for
tunate as to live on the campus will
have between thirty-five and forty.
This sort of thing is reminiscent
of the Middle Ages. It gives the off
campus students the position of sav
age inhabitants of a dependent col
ony—a position against which "Our
Forefathers," —etc., etc. The English
"Rotten Borough System" was sweet
and clean as compared with Stan
ford democracy under these condi
tions.
Those of us who happen to enjoy
the privileges of full citizenship had
best do a little thinking before we
decide to limit these privileges to
two-thirds of the student body.
CEROID ROBINSON.
The new constitution is based on
the representation of living groups.
Students living in Palo Alto are for
the most part scattered over the town
—living at home or in groups of two
or three. To give each of these
groups a representative would be ob
viously impossible. Moreover, ten
men or fifty men representing the
Palo Alto students and not represent
ing living groups could hold no more
responsibility for the other men in
Palo Alto than could two.
Where a group is of sufficient size
it will be required to organize and
send a representative to the Confer
ence whether that group lives on the
campus or in Palo Alto. (Art. I, Sec.
I, and Art. I, Sec. 2, last paragraph).
There are two rooming houses in
Palo Alto, and possibly more, which
are qualified now to send representa
tive to the Conference.
The Conference committee on dorm
itories has the assurance of the Board
of Trustees of the University that
the construction of new dormitories
to house the students living off-cam
pus will be begun almost immediate
ly. In answer to questions sent, out
by the student adviser at least three
fourths of the Palo Alto students
stated that they would move out onto
the campus as soon as they could be
accommodated. Moreover, a large
number of them expressed the feel
ing that they were being cheated out
of something because these accom
modations do not exist now.
Provision is made in the consti
tution for representation from the
new dormitories when they are con
structed. To add more members to
the Conference roll from Palo Alto
in the meantime would not add to the
responsibility of the representatives
over the students not. living in large
groups.— (Ed. Note).
