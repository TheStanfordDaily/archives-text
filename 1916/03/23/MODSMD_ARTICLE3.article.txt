# He Was Always an Optimist Every Day Is a Sunny Day

optimism is a wonderful thing.
A biting wind and a driving rain
are drenching the Quad. A little old
man, with a short white beard, and
an optimistic smile, and carrying a
broom in his hand, is tidying things
up generally.
Two Stanford men pass by.
"Good morning," they say, to the
little old man.
He looks up and smiles.
"Good morning! Fine day!" Then
he bends his back to the broom.
And so Stanford men came to
know Mr. Stacy. But they never
called him that. His name was al
ways Colonel Fairweather. That is
how it was on the campus, every
day, rain or shine—until a few
months ago—before illness confined
the optimistic worker to his home in
Mayfield. The doctor says Mr. Stacy
may never be able to be up and
around again.
Stanford people will miss Colonel
Fairweather. But the sunshine that
has kept him happy will not cease to
shed its warmth merely because old
age has cast its shadow.
Yes, optimism is a wonderful tonic.
