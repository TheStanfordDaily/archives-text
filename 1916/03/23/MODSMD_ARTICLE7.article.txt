.lack McCarthy, well known to Stan
ford baseball tans in the capacity of
umpire, was chosen to succeed Harry
Wolter as coach of the Cardinal squad
by tlie Executive Committee last eve
ning. This action, which is subject
to the approval ol' the Athletic Ad
visory Board, was necessitated by the
resignation of Wolter, who leaves to
day for the south, where he will go
into training with the Los Angeles
Coast League team.
McCarthy was thought to be the
best man obtainable for the remain
ing two weeks, due to his familiar
ity with the Stanford players and
brand of ball which Wolter has been
teaching them. His salary will be
$25 a week.
Maloney Honored.
Harry Ilaloney was voted a gold
soccer football in appreciation of his
services as coach for the past season.
Maloney has worked hard with the
team and its great success is due in
no small measure to his faithfulness.
The record of 24 seconds Hat in the
low hurdles, made by M. J. House,
19. in the track meet of March 11,
was accepted as official by the Ex
ecutive Committee. This establishes
a new Stanford record for that event.
