### 
" Damn the Kaiser, damn the Huns,
Damn the man who invented guns.
Damn the army, damn the war,
What damned bloody fools »»*«* are!"
This is the chant of bate that the
British soldiers are singing in the
trenches; the song that has taken
the place of "Tipperary" for the
fighting Tommies, according to John
Mez. Of course the above did not
come direct from the front; it was
relayed to a neutral country over
neutral territory. Chancellor Jordan
has received this bit of war rhythm
from his former secretary, Mr. John
Mez, whose copy of the verse came
via Switzerland.

Damn the man who invented guns.
