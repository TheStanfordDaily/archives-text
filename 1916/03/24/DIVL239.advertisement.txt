SI'KIM. FKVKH—It's time for it now
—most everyone feels it —just that
lazy inclination to lie around and
listen to the birds, et cetera, sinir
—that lark of snap and pep that
chines during the lirst line days as
we walk down the Quad. Still,
there's one way to overcome it
when we walk—namely, a pair of
Thoits' snappy, comfortable kicks.
