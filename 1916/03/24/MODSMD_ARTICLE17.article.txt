## 
### 
A more timely question for discus
sion could not be found than the
subject of the Tri-State debate to
night, unless possibly the question
dealt with some other phase of the
big national idea of defense. The is
sue of a bigger navy is before the
people of the United States now, and
it will not cease to be an issue in
a month or a year, at the close of the
present war or any other time till the
golden age arrives.
And it will be an issue whether
you be militarist or pacifist, whether
you favor a first class navy or a sec
ond class navy, or no navy at all.
The men who will debate tonight have
been preparing the subject for dis
cussion for the past five weeks, and
have collected most of the arguments
that can be said on either side.
To the men who have been picked
to represent Stanford tonight—at
Stanford and at Eugene, Oregon,—we
extend congratulations on making the
team, and we wish them success in
the debate.
