# "No More Smokeupsâ€”Not This Semester, at Least" Registrar Denies the Rumor
## 
### 
Stanford students have seen the
first, last and only smoke-ups of the
semester those which were issued
during the present month. Assur
ance of this was given by Assistant
Registrar J. E. McDowell yesterday,
in answer to a question concerning
tlie prevailing idea that delinquents
will receive another batch of mail
from the Scholarship Committee later
in the semester.
Nothing To Reports.
"There is absolutely nothing in it,"
he said. "The rumor was borne 011
the same breeze which carried the
tale of fifteen mid-semester flunk
outs. As a matter of fact, only two
men were dismissed in the middle of
the year, not on account of mere un
satisfactory work, but because they
had not attended classes and had
done no work whatever. As to the
second smoke-ups, the Scholarship
Committee never requires reports
after the middle of the semester."
