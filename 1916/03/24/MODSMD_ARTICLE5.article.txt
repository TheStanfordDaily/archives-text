# TRACK SQUAD WILL BE READY FOR BIG MEET, SAYS CAPTAIN
## COACH NOT SO OPTIMISTIC Comparison With U.C. Records Is Favorable to Home Athletes 
### 
That Stanford will be more than
ready to meet the California track
squad by the time the 15ig Meet rolls
around, is the opinion of Captain
| "Feg" Murray, who is watching his
! hopefuls closely, now that "liic"
I Templeton is no longer on the job to
take responsibility for the 1916 sea
son.
Murray is hopeful. According to
him the men are making good time
for this early in the season. In order
that they may not develop too rap
idly and be stale for the critical event
next month, the track is kept soft by
use of the harrow every morning.
Comparison of times made by local |
I men and by California runners gives |
! the Cardinal boys the edge on dope, i
in spite of the soft track here. How- j
ever, it is too early to tell with any I
accuracy who will be who in the !
coming contest.
New .Material In Demand.
Stanford will have to develop some
new men to make up for the sure
eight points which ex-Captain Tem
pleton was sure to bring down. Cap
i tain Murray expects some of the
newer men to improve sufficiently to
make up for Templeton's absence in
l>oints.
X(Milton I.ess Optimistic.
Coach "Dad" Moulton is not as op
| timistic as the captain. According to
j "Dad," the public in general has the
! usual inflated idea of the power of
the Cardinal squad. The veteran
i coach sees many possibilities in the
new men as well as the old ones, but
does not believe in counting chickens
I before the eggs are hatched.
Some Weak Points.
The sprints, pole vault and weights
are the weakest points at the present
time. "Dad" has several men who,
he expects, will "open up" with
speed and strength in time, but they
have not made phenomenal showings
to date. Captain Murray is the log
ical man to enter the sprints to bol
ster up that end of the program, but
be is needed in the hurdles.
