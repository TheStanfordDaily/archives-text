# LOSE TO WASHINGTON WIN FROM OREGON IN TRI-STATE
## BIG CROWD AT DEBATE HERE Negative Teams Successful in Argument on the Navy Increase Tomorrow 
### 
Stanford won from Oregon, but lost
to Washington, in the sixth annual
Tri-State Debate, Friday evening. At
Eugene, the Cardinal negative team,
composed of A. H. Morosco, '16, and
W. I. Ames, '18, succeeded in defeat
ing the orators of the University of
Oregon, on the Tri-State question:
"Resolved, That the United States
should maintain its navy above third
rank in fighting efficiency."
That Stanford people appreciate an
evening entertainment in the form of
a debate was demonstrated by the
large crowd that filled the chapel, Fri
day night, to witness the platform bat
tle between Stanford and Washington.
The home team, made up of M. L. Mc-
Clintock, *18, and F. S. Field. '18, sup
porting the affirmative side of the
navy increase question, lost the de
cision before the negative attacks of
F. E. Ellis and L. B. Schwellenbach
of the University of Washington.
.WcClintock Opens Debate.
McClintock opened the debate for
Stanford in a strong and convincing
speech. He outlined the affirmative
side of the question as resting upon
three things: the serious possibility
of war, the ability of a second class
navy to insure the United States
against war and preserve national
honor and integrity, and the inability
of a lesser navy to accomplish this.
He pointed out dangers of war from
two sources: from colonial enterprises
of European countries in South Amer
ica disregarding the .Monroe doctrine,
and from Oriental expansion and com
mercial rivalry.
Polished oratory and clever reason
ing were combined by the first Wash
ington speaker, Ellis. He brought
evidence to show that there was no
immediate probability of the United
States being involved in war, urging
that the country should not join the
"mad race for armaments," which, he
claimed, was one reason for the pres
ent European war.
Claims Present Navy Inadequate.
Field next took the platform for
Stanford. "In event of war, the pres
ent navy is inadequate to protect the
territorial integrity of the United
States," he said. "No other means of
fers as good protection to the nation
as a navy above third rank. A sec
ond rank navy would meet our needs."
In a satirical vein he pointed out that
the negative argued that there was
no enemy to fear, and yet maintained
that the present third rate navy was
sufficient to cope with this enemy,
which the negative claimed did not
exist.
Schwelleiihaeli Against Preparedness.
Asserting that the United States had
no enemy to fear, Schwellenbach, the
second Washington orator, claimed
that, even if there were a possibility
of war, our present navy is ample
"Preparedness is merely a compara
tive term," be said, decrying the pos
sibility of a "navy of aggression." "A
system of competitive armaments," lie
continued, "was one of the great
causes of the present war in Europe."
He ended by quoting Dr. Jordan
against preparedness.

States," he said. "No other means of
fers as good protection to the nation
as a navy above third rank. A sec
ond rank navy would meet our needs."
In a satirical vein he pointed out that
the negative argued that there was
no enemy to fear, and yet maintained
that the present third rate navy was
sufficient to cope with this enemy,
which the negative claimed did not
exist.
Schwelleiihaeli Against Preparedness.
Asserting that the United States had
no enemy to fear, Schwellenbach, the
second Washington orator, claimed
that, even if there were a possibility
of war, our present navy is ample
"Preparedness is merely a compara
tive term," be said, decrying the pos

Stanford won from Oregon, but lost
to Washington, in the sixth annual
Tri-State Debate, Friday evening. At
Eugene, the Cardinal negative team,
composed of A. H. Morosco, '16, and
W. I. Ames, '18, succeeded in defeat
ing the orators of the University of
Oregon, on the Tri-State question:
"Resolved, That the United States
should maintain its navy above third
rank in fighting efficiency."
That Stanford people appreciate an
evening entertainment in the form of
a debate was demonstrated by the
large crowd that filled the chapel, Fri
day night, to witness the platform bat
tle between Stanford and Washington.
The home team, made up of M. L. Mc-
Clintock, *18, and F. S. Field. '18, sup
porting the affirmative side of the
navy increase question, lost the de
cision before the negative attacks of
F. E. Ellis and L. B. Schwellenbach
of the University of Washington.
.WcClintock Opens Debate.
McClintock opened the debate for
Stanford in a strong and convincing
speech. He outlined the affirmative
side of the question as resting upon
three things: the serious possibility
of war, the ability of a second class
navy to insure the United States
against war and preserve national
honor and integrity, and the inability
of a lesser navy to accomplish this.
He pointed out dangers of war from
two sources: from colonial enterprises
of European countries in South Amer
ica disregarding the .Monroe doctrine,
and from Oriental expansion and com
mercial rivalry.
Polished oratory and clever reason
ing were combined by the first Wash
ington speaker, Ellis. He brought
evidence to show that there was no
immediate probability of the United
States being involved in war, urging
that the country should not join the
"mad race for armaments," which, he
claimed, was one reason for the pres
ent European war.
Claims Present Navy Inadequate.
Field next took the platform for
Stanford. "In event of war, the pres
ent navy is inadequate to protect the
territorial integrity of the United
States," he said. "No other means of
fers as good protection to the nation
as a navy above third rank. A sec
ond rank navy would meet our needs."
