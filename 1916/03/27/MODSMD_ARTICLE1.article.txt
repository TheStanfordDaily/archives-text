# LOSE TO WASHINGTON WIN FROM OREGON IN TRI-STATE
## BIG CROWD AT DEBATE HERE Negative Teams Successful in Argument on the Navy Increase Tomorrow 
### 
Stanford won from Oregon, but lost
to Washington, in the sixth annual
Tri-State Debate, Friday evening. At
Eugene, the Cardinal negative team,
composed of A. H. Morosco, '16, and
W. I. Ames, '18, succeeded in defeat
ing the orators of the University of
Oregon, on the Tri-State question:
"Resolved, That the United States
should maintain its navy above third
rank in fighting efficiency."
That Stanford people appreciate an
evening entertainment in the form of
a debate was demonstrated by the
large crowd that filled the chapel, Fri
day night, to witness the platform bat
tle between Stanford and Washington.
The home team, made up of M. L. Mc-
Clintock, *18, and F. S. Field. '18, sup
porting the affirmative side of the
navy increase question, lost the de
cision before the negative attacks of
F. E. Ellis and L. B. Schwellenbach
of the University of Washington.
.WcClintock Opens Debate.
McClintock opened the debate for
Stanford in a strong and convincing
speech. He outlined the affirmative
side of the question as resting upon
three things: the serious possibility
of war, the ability of a second class
navy to insure the United States
against war and preserve national
honor and integrity, and the inability
of a lesser navy to accomplish this.
