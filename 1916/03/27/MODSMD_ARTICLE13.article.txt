# Seniors May Found Scholarship Fund
## Propose Insurance Plan To Establish Foundation $30,000 by 1936 For Stanford Students 
### 
Endowment insurance on the lives
of a number of members of the 191R
class will be purchased by the Stan
ford seniors for the purpose of found
ing a permanent scholarship fund, !f
the plans now under way are carried
out. The proposition being consid
ered is that the lives of ten men be
in .''red to the extent o» • itb r $2,00'J
f»* $3 000 each ard that the annual
premiums on he 120,000 or $30.0'."-0
policies be l>o t.o by the entire cla.-*s
for the twenty years of the life of
the policies. At maturity of the pol
icies, or at the earlier death of anv
of the insured, the money is to be
used for the purpose of establishing a
number of Class of 191(1 scholarships
in Stanford.
lias I'roved Successful.
In general, the plan of the seniors
is similar to ones which have proved
successful in other universities. Har
vard, Columbia, Princeton and the
University of California, all have a
system very much alike.
Vmiuul Income of $l,r>oo.
Should the plan to buy ten $3,000
policies be approved by the members
of the class, it will mean that in twen
ty years, or in 1936, there will revert
to the University a sum of $30,000
to be used in establishing a scholar
ship fund. At f> per cent interest, the
fund would yield $1,500 each year,
which would, according to present
plans, be divided into ten funds of
$150 each. These scholarships would
then be available to students already
in Stanford, and preferably in the
upper classes, who were in need of
financial assistance.
Lucking In Scholarships.
Because of its extreme youth, Stan
ford is without the great number of
scholarships so common in the older
universities of the east, and it is with
the intention of finding a way to over
come this failing that the 191fi class
is considering the insurance fund
proposition.
All that stands in the way of un
dertaking the establishment of the in
surance fund, is the agreement of at
least two hundred members of the
class to assist in the payment of the
annual premium. If two hundred of
the graduates agree to stand behind
the $.°»,000 policies, it will bring the
annual cost per member of a trifle
over $7.
The insurance committee, consist
ing of M. J. Cody, chairman; H. F.
Elliott, A. S. Hayes, Minerva Ander
son and Jessamine Hunt, will meet
tonight to draw up a circular letter
to be sent to each of the 300 members
of the senior class requesting them
to state definitely whether or not they
will help to finance the proposed in
surance.
