Stanford men will get their oppor
tunity for first-hand information on
military drill at the assembly in the
Union tomorrow night. Husy men of
affairs are willing to come to Stanford
and give this information to help
Stanford men in their "Think it Over"
campaign.
The time to think it over is now.
If anything is to be done in drill
next fall, preparations for it have to
be made this semester and over the
summer. To wait till next fall to
make decision will delay the installa
tion of drill, if we are to have it, just
that much longer. The men on the
campus who want military drill, and
they are many, will defeat their own
desires by delaying the settlement of
this question of policy.
There is no reason why the ques
tion of having military drill cannot be
decided right away, if the men on the
campus are thinking it over, and, if
interested, are willing to give proper
evidence of that interest.
