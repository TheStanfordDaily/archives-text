A track meet In Los Angeles and
one at Stanford, a debate in Eugene,
Oregon, and at home, a baseball game
in San Jose and a freshman game on
the campus, a girls' basketball game
at Mills, a wrestling match at the
gymnasium and a swimming meet in
the local plunge, to say nothing of
regular workouts for the Stanford
crewsâ€”rather a busy mid-season
week-end for Stanford people.
