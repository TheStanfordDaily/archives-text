# Varsity Eight Leaves For Seattle Saturday
## 
### 
With but four workouts remaining
before the varsity crew leaves for
Seattle for the race with the Univer
sity of Washington eight, on Lake
Washington on April 8, Coach Guer
ena is putting the men through stiff
daily drills. On Saturday of this
week, ten men beside the coach and
coxswain, will leave for the northern
institution, where final practices will
be held on the course of the race.
The coach will not name the men who
will make the trip until late in the
week. In the meantime, the varsity
and second varsity squads will be
put through a course of long rows,
interspersed with sprints.
Wiiii Trial Races.
After several days of "hard luck"
in the way of bad weather, wrongly
adjusted oar locks, and engine trouble
I in the coaching launch, the workout
Friday afternoon was the best of the
week. Even then the varsity eight
was not in anything resembling racing
form, and was hardly able to hold its
own against the second shell in sev
eral sprints.
The workout on Saturday was con
! fined to a long distance row, all four
I of the eight-man shells pulling far out
into the bay. Yesterday, the workout
was divided between sprints and a
fairly long row. Sprints between the
first and second freshman eights have
invariably proved comparatively easy
victories for the former.
The squad takti to tlie bay today
was as follows:
Varsity—Lyon, coxswain: Maurer,
Green, Orme, .Tacomini, Rogers,
Swarts, Worth, Heron.
Second Varsity—Goodman, coxs
wain: Steinbeck, Keller, Russell, An
drews, .Teffers, Coleman, Kester,
Neuner.
Freshmen —Montgomery, coxswain;
King, Watts, LaForge, Winham, Bent,
Williamson, Brown, Atwater.
Second Freshmen —Willis, coxswain;
Betts, Waite, Nelson, Curtice, Bowl
ing, Taylor, Barneson, Jacomini.
