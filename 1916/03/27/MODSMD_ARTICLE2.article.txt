# Builder of Quad Called by Death
## John D. McGilvray, Here Since 1899, Passes Away at Escondite Cottage, Friday Night 
### 
Another link in the chain binding
the present with the old days of Stan
ford was broken when John D. Mc-
Gilvray, the sturdy builder of the
"stone age," passed away at his cam
pus residence, Escondite Cottage, last
Friday evening, after a brief illness.
Funeral services wore held this after
noon in the chapel of Cypress Lawn
cemetery.
Stanford people will remember him
as the man who built the Outer Quad
rangle, the Chemistry building, the
Memorial Church, and the larger
structures which were destroyed by
the earthquake. From 1898, when he
undertook the construction of the
Library and Assembly Hall, until her
death, in 1905, Mr. McGilvray was the
trusted builder and adviser of Mrs.
Stanford. In those years lie learned
to thoroughly appreciate her splendid
qualities, her keen judgment, and her
unswerving devotion to the ideals of
the University, and no employer was
ever served with more loyalty and ad
miration than was she.
Tn 1899, Mr. McGilvray took up
what he considered to be only a tem
porary residence in Kscondite Cottage,
the home of the famous "French
man," near the Mayfield entrance to
the campus, but he became so attached
to this beautiful place that it became
his home. He is survived by a widow,
eight children and thirteen grand
children. Among the children are
four Stanford students, Alexander R.
C., ex-'O4, Jessie M. Treat, '07, Walter
Scott, '12, and Malcolm Canmore, '17.
