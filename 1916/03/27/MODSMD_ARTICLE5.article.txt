# ENCINA TALK ON THE "FINE ART OF LIVING"
## Success Depends On Actual Contact With the Best, According to U.C. Professor 
### 
Assistant Professor J. H. Hilde
brand, of the University of California
Chemistry department., talked at the
Encina Sunday evening meeting, on
the topic, "The Fine Art of Living."
"Living," he declared, "can be re
duced to a science, but for its best
success depends further upon actual
contact with the best in everything.
The heart of my philosophy of life, is
the life of .Jesus Chrust, typifying the
inspiration of the very tinest in life
and in everything connected with it.
"The lesson of strength from the
career of Christ conies through prac
tical consideration of him as a man
and not in the theological sense; of
seeing bis acts as of a human, and
not of a divine."
In connection with the thought of
inspiration from the individual, Mr.
Hildehrand said: "If you are wise,
you will select your courses with re
spect to the men who can inspire you
with their personality, rather than
merely for the subjects taught."
