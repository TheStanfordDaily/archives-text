# PRESIDENT VINCENT OF MINNESOTA SPEAKS AT ASSEMBLY
## MAKES A GOOD IMPRESSION Portrays Conflict in Ideals of So-Called Democrats and Aristocrats 
### 
President George H. Vincent of the
University of Minnesota did this
morning what he ironically admitted
to be a dangerous thing—he made
some people think. With force, sar
casm, and wit, he portrayed the con
flict of ideals of discipline on the
part of the aristocratic and democracy
on the part of the ordinary people.
Aristocrats Natural Leaders.
The aristocrats, according to Dr.
Vincent's views, are those who be
come natural leaders of the people
through sheer ability, energy, and
force. They assert themselves sooner
or later, no matter, what the form of
organization is, picnics or govern
ment. They are the proper people to
handle administrative affairs. They
are efficient.
Democracy Inefficient,
"The democrats," said Dr. Vincent,
"preach that the average man is the
one to run affairs everywhere. He
is pictured as the demagogue who is
all-powerful by reason of his ballot.
His judgment is ttnerring by reason
of his traditions, which have been
handed down by the brightest men
of the past. Democracy is inefficient,
however. The average man's judg
ment is needed for solidarity."
"Our national problem is to com
bine the efficiency of the aristocracy
with the solidarity of the democracy,"
he continued, "and to showing the
proper relation of the two ideals.
The question now is whether or not
we have the foresight to build our
national life on a solid yet efficient
basis. We must either learn to do
this or have it done for us from the
outside. You young people have this
before you—are you prepared to use
your capacity for administration and
leadership for general good rather
than for private gain?"
