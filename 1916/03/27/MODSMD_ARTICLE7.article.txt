# Marathon Tryouts Every Afternoon
## Greased Pole Contest, Three-Legged Race and Chicken Catch To Be Featured 
### 
Tryouts for places on the twenty
four-man class teams, which will com
pete in the Irish marathon, to be run
on the oval, next Saturday morning,
at 10 o'clock, will be held every af
ternoon of this week from 4 to G
o'clock. Every man will be timed and
the teams picked accordingly.
Other events, which are as much a
part of the Irish marathon as the race
itself, will be a number of stunts
which have been arranged by the com
mittee, of which E. T. Worthy, '1-1, is
chairman. Included in those are a
three-legged race, a greased pole con
test, an obstacle race, which will re
quire the participants to Â£o through
many ludicrous barriers, and a
chicken catch. The winners of each
of these events, except the obstacle
race, will receive a dollar order from
Wideman's. Festivities will start
promptly at 10 o'clock, Saturday
morning; admission is twenty-five
cents.
