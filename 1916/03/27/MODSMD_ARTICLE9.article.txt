# SEALS NOSE OUT VARSITY, 4-3
## 
### 
"It certainly was a tight squeeze,"
were the words of Harry Wolverton,
manager of the San Francisco Coast
League team, at the conclusion of the
Stanford-Seals game in San .lose, last
Saturday afternoon. After nine in
nings of the closest play had been
registered, the score board read 4 to
3, with the long end in favor of the
speedy coasters.
Infield Shifted.
Every member of the Cardinal squad
played as never before this season.
The infield, remodeled to suit the
fancies of the new coach. Jack Mc-

Carthy, and Captain "Babe" Dent,
worked as unit, while the shifted out
field covered a world of territory.
The batting order, resembling the old
one only in that "Doc" Hayes was
still retained as the clean-up hitter,
came through in great style, the lo
cals outhitting the Champs.
lloever Pitches Well.
Gus Hoever twirled baseball which
assures the fans that he will be a
prominent factor in the "Rig Series."
His spitter was a puzzle to the slug
gers, but six bingles being obtained
from his offerings, while the famous
"Ping" Hodie whiffed the air twice in
the pinches.
Johnny Couch, well known as a for
mer Cardinal chucker, started the
game for the Seals. Five innings were
enough for the speed ball pitcher. He
left the game with the runs stand
ing three up, the win consequently
going to Machold, who followed "Wild
John" in the box.
Lander sent Hoever over the pan
for the first Stanford score, when he
banged out a long single in the third.
The other two tallies rung up by the
Cardinal were made in the fifth frame,
when Sanborn walked, Hoever, Staf
ford and Lander each singled, and
all were safe on Dent's grounder.
Sanborn and Stafford came across the
platter with the markers.
