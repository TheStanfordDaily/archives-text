# INTEREST IN DRILL AT HIGH POINT
## Assembly in Union This Evening to Discuss Plans General Bell, Captain Purviance, President Wilbur and Presley to Speak 
### 
The men's assembly in the Union
this evening will he the high point in
'lie movement for voluntary drill at
Stanford. The interest shown by the
students will without doubt carry
the plans to a triumphant realization
or bring themselves to an ignominious
end, according to whether it is great
or small. The officers who will speak
tonight, Brigadier General Franklin
Bell and Captain Samuel A. Purvi
ance, retired, are experts in their line.
What they say will be of interest to
all men who have the good of the
plan at heart.
The men will be given an oppor
tunity to say whether or not they will
get behind the movement, and if
enough signify their desire to have
the drill introduced, steps will be
taken at once to begin next semester.
It will probably be conducted on the
same plan as gymnasium work, an
hour of credit being given for three
hours' work a week. Government aid
will in all probability be forthcoming
if the interest is great enough.
The University will be represented
by President Wilbur, who has con
sented to speak, while George J. Pres
ley, '07, will talk on behalf of the
alumni. .1. F. Lanagan, '00, was un
able to accept an invitation t6 speak,
but, in a letter to R. A. GrifTin, '17,
he expresses himself as strongly in
favor of the introduction of volun
tary drill. This letter follows:
