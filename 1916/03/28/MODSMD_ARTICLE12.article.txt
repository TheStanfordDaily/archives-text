# INTEREST IN DRILL AT HIGH POINT
## Assembly in Union This Evening to Discuss Plans General Bell, Captain Purviance, President Wilbur and Presley to Speak

The men's assembly in the Union
this evening will he the high point in
'lie movement for voluntary drill at
Stanford. The interest shown by the
students will without doubt carry
the plans to a triumphant realization

What they say will be of interest to
all men who have the good of the

hour of credit being given for three
hours' work a week. Government aid
will in all probability be forthcoming
if the interest is great enough.
The University will be represented
by President Wilbur, who has con

alumni. .1. F. Lanagan, '00, was un
