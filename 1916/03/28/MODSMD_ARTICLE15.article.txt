# Are We Sidestepping?
## 
### 
The numerous communications re
ceived by California newspapers—
most of which were wisely consigned
to the waste paper basket—and an
editorial in at least one eastern jour
nal accusing Dr. Jordan of side-step
ping because of the movement for j
military drill at Stanford, are highly
amusing, especially because they take
the subject so seriously.
We fail to see any grounds for ac
cusing the Chancellor of sidestepping.
The movement originated with the
students and has been carried through
by them. Tn discussing military drill
at Stanford, Dr. Jordan said: "1 have
no criticism to register against the
proposed military training plan you
suggest. Any Americans have the
right to act. as their best judgment
sees fit. But of course T would always
heartily oppose any enforced militar
ism. as has been the case in Europe."
We cannot detect in this any "side
stepping" from his usual position.
But other letters have accused Stan
ford students of "throwing down" Dr.
Jordan in his fight for peace and
against militarism. And this charge
is equally unfounded.
One of the ideas back of the move
ment for military training at Stanford
is to help in avoiding the militarism of
Europe. There is a big difference be
tween a trained citizenry and a large
standing army and the difference is
not one of degree, only. From per
sonal experience with army people we
know that the statement is true that
the man who is in the army as a pro
fession looks forward to war with its
chances for promotion and distinction
with gratification.
Since that is true, the standing
army is always an element in the
community tending to work for war.
The trained citizen is in a very dif
ferent position. He has his own pro
fession in which he looks forward to
success. While he desires to be in
position to do the most for his coun
try in case of war, his personal in
terests are against, a struggle which
will take hint away from his work
and delay business in it. The danger
which lurks in militarism is absent.
The men who are backing the study
of military science at Stanford believe I
that the United States needs trained |
men. They also believe that it is the
duty of college men to fill that need.
Many of them believe that if some
form of citizen training is not devised \
the country will have to resort to a |
large standing army for defense. And j
to do their bit toward warding off the i
militarism of Europe, they seek to be
trained while in college.
Moreover, almost to a man, they be- j
lieve in the ideals of peace and are
willing to do more than their share
to preserve peace . Are they sidestep
pine?

to preserve peace . Are they sidestep
pine?
The numerous communications re
ceived by California newspapers—
most of which were wisely consigned
to the waste paper basket—and an
editorial in at least one eastern jour
nal accusing Dr. Jordan of side-step
ping because of the movement for j
military drill at Stanford, are highly
amusing, especially because they take
the subject so seriously.
We fail to see any grounds for ac
cusing the Chancellor of sidestepping.
The movement originated with the
students and has been carried through
by them. Tn discussing military drill
at Stanford, Dr. Jordan said: "1 have
no criticism to register against the
proposed military training plan you
suggest. Any Americans have the
right to act. as their best judgment
sees fit. But of course T would always
heartily oppose any enforced militar
ism. as has been the case in Europe."
We cannot detect in this any "side
stepping" from his usual position.
But other letters have accused Stan
ford students of "throwing down" Dr.
Jordan in his fight for peace and
against militarism. And this charge
is equally unfounded.
One of the ideas back of the move
ment for military training at Stanford
is to help in avoiding the militarism of
Europe. There is a big difference be
tween a trained citizenry and a large
standing army and the difference is
not one of degree, only. From per
sonal experience with army people we
know that the statement is true that
the man who is in the army as a pro
fession looks forward to war with its
chances for promotion and distinction
with gratification.
Since that is true, the standing
army is always an element in the
community tending to work for war.
The trained citizen is in a very dif
ferent position. He has his own pro
fession in which he looks forward to
success. While he desires to be in
position to do the most for his coun
try in case of war, his personal in
terests are against, a struggle which
will take hint away from his work
and delay business in it. The danger
which lurks in militarism is absent.
The men who are backing the study
of military science at Stanford believe I
that the United States needs trained |
men. They also believe that it is the
duty of college men to fill that need.
Many of them believe that if some
form of citizen training is not devised \
the country will have to resort to a |
large standing army for defense. And j
to do their bit toward warding off the i
militarism of Europe, they seek to be
trained while in college.
Moreover, almost to a man, they be- j
lieve in the ideals of peace and are
willing to do more than their share
to preserve peace . Are they sidestep
pine?
