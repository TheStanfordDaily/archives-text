in sniffing distance of Sticky's penny
candy shop. It. is Spring. Johnny is

no time to triile with sophomore
qeeeners.
Johnny—'Lo, Minnie. Which way
yu goin'?
Minnie —Why, that way, of course.
(Nods towards the candy shop.)
Johnny (feels for thickness of
purse)— Swell dope, Min! In we go.
(The scene changes to one of the
sticky tables, where Johnny is about
to reach faintly for the last straw.)
Minnie —Yes, you're right, John;
there was an awful bunch of dances
this year.
Johnny—lf they're so awful to you,
why do you go to them all?
Minnie—Who said I'm going to
them all? I'm not!
Johnny (under his chocalate-coated
breath) —Fine dope! (then, scoliingly)
—But I suppose you'd like to take
them all in?
Minnie—Sure thing! (then shyly)
—Hut a girl hasn't everything to say
about it, you know!
Johnny—That's right! Something
to that! You have the idea! Why,
er —Minnie, would you like —would
you care to —have some more.
Minnie —John, you give a girl heart
failure! I thought you were going to
invite me to the banrl dance. Why,
yes, if you want to. A refill sounds
great!
Johnny (feebly)—A refill for her,
and bring me—bring me a glass of
water. Training rules, you know!
Minnie —(looks away bashfully, as
if expecting something.)
Johnny (quickly)— Say, say Minnie,
can you go to the band dance with
me—night before track meet—swell
music, slicked up floor. You'll go,
won't you?
Minnie —Aw, John. I'm awfully
t-orry. Why didn't you speak up
sooner. I'd love to go with you!
Johnny (weakly)— How long ago is
"sooner?"
Minnie —Oh, about two months.
Johnny (to waitress) —Bring me a
coca-cola; make it strong.
