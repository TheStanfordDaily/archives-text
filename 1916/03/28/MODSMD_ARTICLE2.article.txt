# Vincent Advocates Student Control
## Minnesota University President Believes Hazing Is a Thing of the Past 
### 
To meet him face to face, President
George H. Vincent of the University
of Minnesota is not half so satirical
as you pictured him, after hearing
his address yesterday morning. As a
matter of fact, he is not very satirical
at all. Naturally, he doesn't talk
very fast —he is deliberate and cau
tious in what he says. He impresses
you as being a man who does not say
all that he thinks frankly, but only
that which he has thought out.
"Student government should be en
tirely in the hands of the students.
It should not be mere form or name —
it should be student body government
in actual practice. 1 can bulldoze
the students into admitting they have
self-government by establishing cer
tain organizations, but I cannot make
them believe they have it until I give
them the power to act on and settle
questions."
President Vincent gives decisive an
swers to such questions.
"Hazing is something that is de
cidedly out of place in a modern uni
vresity. It is a thing so much of ttit
past that no progressive college will
tolerate it. We have not had it as a
problem since long before T came to
Minnesota. I believe that the fresh
men have certain work to do at Min
nesota. but that is entirely a question
