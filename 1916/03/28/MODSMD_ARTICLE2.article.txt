# Vincent Advocates Student Control
## Minnesota University President Believes Hazing Is a Thing of the Past 
### 
To meet him face to face, President
George H. Vincent of the University
of Minnesota is not half so satirical
as you pictured him, after hearing
his address yesterday morning. As a
matter of fact, he is not very satirical
at all. Naturally, he doesn't talk
very fast —he is deliberate and cau
tious in what he says. He impresses
you as being a man who does not say
all that he thinks frankly, but only
that which he has thought out.
"Student government should be en
tirely in the hands of the students.
It should not be mere form or name —
it should be student body government
in actual practice. 1 can bulldoze
the students into admitting they have
self-government by establishing cer
tain organizations, but I cannot make
them believe they have it until I give
them the power to act on and settle
questions."
President Vincent gives decisive an
swers to such questions.
"Hazing is something that is de
cidedly out of place in a modern uni
vresity. It is a thing so much of ttit
past that no progressive college will
tolerate it. We have not had it as a
problem since long before T came to
Minnesota. I believe that the fresh
men have certain work to do at Min
nesota. but that is entirely a question
for fraternities to settle. The univer
sity does not bother about such
things."
Dr. Vincent is a man very easily
approached, lie is not in the least
formidable —simply informal. He i?
ready and willing to talk on practic
ally any phase of college life—he
seems to have intimate acquaintance
with little as well as big Minnesota
problems.
"Intercollegiate contests," be said,
are good. Hut Tam not in favor of all
the hurrah they make about them. In
tercollegiate contests as a means of
advertising the college are not very
productive. They do not advertise the
sound, scholastic side of the college."
Asked whether or not he approved
of the desires of many western stu
dents to go east to study, Dr. Vincent
replied: "There is no great advant
age in instruction that 1 can see. There
is a good influence in broadening the
views. We encourage our students to
go elsewhere for graduate work."
