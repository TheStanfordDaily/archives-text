# Double Plays
## 
### 
Stanford baseball fans should be
thoroughly satisfied with the brand of
ball that the varsity is displaying at
the present time. The team is play
ing in the best form that it has shown
this season, and from all indications,
has hit a winning stride that will be
maintained throughout the remainder
of the baseball year.
—o —
Recent shifts in the lineup seem to
be to the advantage of the team as a
whole. Double plays have been few
and far between this season, and the
old keystone combination of Stevens
and' Stafford should help matters.
Hensel clearly showed in the game
with the Seals, last Saturday, that he
can handle the hard ones down the
third base line, so the latest infield,
Mayes, Stafford, Stevens, and Hensel,
looks like a fixture. Lander and
Xoonan are putting up a nice game in
the outfield, leaving one berth not
filled permanently.
Hoever came through in great style
against 1 lie "Frisco Coasters," and
adds greatly to Stanford's chances in
the "Big Serious." With three de
pendable pitchers, the Cardinal will
not be lacking in the box. Wicker
sham, Draper, and Hoover have
shown up the best of the twirlers in
the preliminary games, although
Howe and Mattei arc to be reckoned
with in the final choice of chuckers.
—o —
.lack McCarthy should prove an ad
mirable coach to put on the finishing
touches to the Stanford tossers. He
fs well known as a former American,
Western, Northwestern, and Pacific
Coast League umpire. He went
around the world with the All-Amer
ican baseball team, and was in the
Hawaiian Islands when the Cardinal
team toured there during last sum-,
mer. He lias also had a great deal of
expericncc in coaching, having
handled the diamond destinies of the
University of California for three
(ears, the Blue and Gold winning
each time.
—o —
The freshmen are back in the form
that they displayed during the first
part of the season. They have played
excellent ball in the last few games,
especially so in the game last Satur
day. The ill field works like a clock,
while the outfielders cover a great
deal of ground. Lilly, Mitchell, Mes
sick, and Sliriver are the leaders of
the first year players ir. batting.
—o —■
Squeeze plays have been executed
often on the campus diamond this
year. The varsity have proven them
selves capable of working this play,
and the freshmen have sent men
across by this means on a number of
occasions. Ryan seems to be the
most dependable bunter on the teajn.

Hensel clearly showed in the game
with the Seals, last Saturday, that he
can handle the hard ones down the
third base line, so the latest infield,
Mayes, Stafford, Stevens, and Hensel,
looks like a fixture. Lander and
Xoonan are putting up a nice game in
the outfield, leaving one berth not
filled permanently.
Hoever came through in great style
against 1 lie "Frisco Coasters," and
adds greatly to Stanford's chances in
the "Big Serious." With three de
pendable pitchers, the Cardinal will
not be lacking in the box. Wicker
sham, Draper, and Hoover have
shown up the best of the twirlers in
the preliminary games, although
Howe and Mattei arc to be reckoned
with in the final choice of chuckers.

.lack McCarthy should prove an ad
mirable coach to put on the finishing
touches to the Stanford tossers. He
fs well known as a former American,
Western, Northwestern, and Pacific
Coast League umpire. He went
around the world with the All-Amer
ican baseball team, and was in the
Hawaiian Islands when the Cardinal
team toured there during last sum-,
mer. He lias also had a great deal of
expericncc in coaching, having
handled the diamond destinies of the
University of California for three
(ears, the Blue and Gold winning
each time.

The freshmen are back in the form
that they displayed during the first
part of the season. They have played
excellent ball in the last few games,
especially so in the game last Satur
day. The ill field works like a clock,
while the outfielders cover a great
deal of ground. Lilly, Mitchell, Mes
sick, and Sliriver are the leaders of
the first year players ir. batting.

Squeeze plays have been executed
often on the campus diamond this
year. The varsity have proven them
selves capable of working this play,
and the freshmen have sent men
across by this means on a number of
occasions. Ryan seems to be the
most dependable bunter on the teajn.
Stanford baseball fans should be
thoroughly satisfied with the brand of
ball that the varsity is displaying at
the present time. The team is play
ing in the best form that it has shown
this season, and from all indications,
has hit a winning stride that will be
maintained throughout the remainder
of the baseball year.

Recent shifts in the lineup seem to
be to the advantage of the team as a
whole. Double plays have been few
and far between this season, and the
old keystone combination of Stevens
and' Stafford should help matters.
