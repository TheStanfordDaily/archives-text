# Junior Opera Songs to Live Authors Will Publish Score
## 
### 
"Yes, Genevieve; the music of the
opera is very beautiful, indeed! You
need not fear that it will be lost to
posterity. As a matter of fact, my
dear, everybody will be singing the
songs and humming the hums for
quite some posterities to come. You
raise your eyebrows in surprise!
"Oh, my no! There are not nearly
enough brains around here for that.
Remember all the tunes? Absurd!
Impossible! It's simply this, my dear.
That's right, come up close to your
honey. Now, listen! the authors are
going to publish the music."
"Of course! How stupid of you!
And how sensible of them to publish
the hook. 'In Dutch' is too good, too
professional, to be allowed to disap
pear like most college operas. We
should perpetuate the wonderful mel
odies. Yes, I will have a bit more
tea, thanks. .lust a sip, my dear!"
