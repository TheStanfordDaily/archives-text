# STUNTS ON LAKE WILL OPEN JUNIOR WEEK TOMORROW
## OPERA BIG EVENT THURSDAY Races on Lake, Interclass Track Meet and Prom Will Fill Friday's Program 
### 
Festivities of this year's Junior
Week, under the auspices of the class
of 1917, will begin tomorrow evening
with an elaborate program of mus
ical numbers and a fireworks display
on the waters of Lagunita. The
shores of the lake will serve as an
open-air auditorium, a floating barge
will provide the stage for the glee
club, and the veranda of the men's
boathouee will be the band stand.
New Junior Day Song.
The feature of the musical pro
gram is to lie the rendition of a new
Junior Day song, especially written
for the occasion. Though it is claim
ed for the song that it will be the
superior of all former Junior songs,
it will not lie depended upon for the
"heavy" part of the program, as var
ied and "snappy" numbers in great
quantity are being planned by the
committee in charge of the Junior
Week music.
Hawaiian Quartet Afloat.
A forty-five piece band will lie sta
tioned on the upper veranda, from
which place of vn-i'age the music will
roll out over Lagunita to the audi
ence on the shores and in the boats
and canoes. The entire men's glee
club is to give a varied program from
a position on the women's large
barge. A Hawaiian quartet will ap
pear in a smaller boat, and offer to
the audience along the shore a num
ber of humorous selections.
