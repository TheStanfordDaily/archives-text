club, and the veranda of the men's
boathouee will be the band stand.
New Junior Day Song.
The feature of the musical pro
gram is to lie the rendition of a new
Junior Day song, especially written
for the occasion. Though it is claim
ed for the song that it will be the
superior of all former Junior songs,
it will not lie depended upon for the
"heavy" part of the program, as var
ied and "snappy" numbers in great
quantity are being planned by the
committee in charge of the Junior
Week music.
Hawaiian Quartet Afloat.
A forty-five piece band will lie sta
tioned on the upper veranda, from
which place of vn-i'age the music will

ence on the shores and in the boats
and canoes. The entire men's glee
club is to give a varied program from
a position on the women's large
barge. A Hawaiian quartet will ap
pear in a smaller boat, and offer to
the audience along the shore a num
ber of humorous selections.
For the special benefit of campus
"roughs," a large automobile head
light will be placed on the boathouse,
and will be skillfully manipulated in
searching out queeners in the audi
ence and in the boats. Beginning
promptly at 7:. r !0 o'clock and contin
uing for an hour and a half, the mus
ical program will be followed at 9
o'clock by "thirty minutes of the
greatest display of fireworks ever seen
on the farm." "Direct from the Mar
ina" is another apt term being used
to describe the spectacle, for the fire
works display will be given under the
direction of the same company which
held the contract for the displays
made throughout last year at. the Pan
ama-Pacific Exposition.
The direction and arrangement of
the music for Junior Week is in the
hands of a committee composed of G.
K. Howard, chairman: C. J. Single, IT.

ber of humorous selections.

light will be placed on the boathouse,
and will be skillfully manipulated in
searching out queeners in the audi
ence and in the boats. Beginning
promptly at 7:. r !0 o'clock and contin
uing for an hour and a half, the mus
ical program will be followed at 9

works display will be given under the
direction of the same company which
held the contract for the displays
made throughout last year at. the Pan
ama-Pacific Exposition.
