# 1916 Class to Be Hosts at Vendome
## Senior Ball Plans Forecast New Standard of Perfection For Gay Evening 
### 
No effort will be spared to make the
1916 Senior Ball the most complete
and elaborate evening ever offered by
a graduating class at Stanford. Plans
are now under way for a gala affair
at the Hotel Vendome, San Jose, on
Monday evening, May 22nd.
Over three hundred Stanford people
are expected to join in the festivities
when the well known hostelry throws
open its doors to Stanford, and Stan
ford only, on the favored evening.
Twenty dances, an eight-course sup
per off the program, professional
music and entertainment from San
Francisco for ball room and dining
room, a special electric train to San
Jose from the campus, and the high
est creation of the program-maker's
art â€” these are some of the things that
are now assured for the 1916 Senior
Ball.
