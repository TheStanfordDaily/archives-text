# GENERAL BELL BOOSTS PLAN FOR DRILL AT STANFORD
## GOVERNMENT AID ASSURED President Wilbur and Presley Advocate Installation of Training 
### 
"If you want to organize into an
active military body, I'll do it lor
you, and it won't cost one red cent.
The government would welcome such
<i step, and aid by detailing an of
ficer. For my part, 1 could send you
drill men to impart the mechanical
knowledge and specialsts who would
instruct you in the actual science of
warfare. I am opposed to war, nor
can I conceive any United States sol
dier desiring bloodshed —but 1 firmly
believe fighting is necessary, and in
the future is inevitable." Thus Brig
adier General Franklin Hell, veteran
of four campaigns, not only encour
aged but showed himself deeply en
thusiastic in the movement for vol
untary drill at Stanford, chrystallzea
by a men's assembly at the Union
yesterday evening. Close to two hun
dred students were eager listeners to
the addresses of General Hell, Presi
dent Wilbur, and George Presley.
Has Xo Doubts.
As to the possibilities of actual in
stallation and formation of an army
battalion on the campus, the general
expressed not the slightest, doubt. He
expressed himself in favor or giving
gymnasium credit for the drill, and
in addition to provide lecture courses
on military science. Furthermore, he
believed that he could secure wealthy,
public spirited citizens of San Fran
cisco to contribute uniforms and
equipment for immediate use.
General Hell, after a brief outline
of likely plans for the installation of
military drill, plunged into another
subject, the very earnestness of which
seemed convincing. It was a plea for
the simple use of common sense as
regards national defense. He said, in
part:
Common Sense and Preparedness.
"There is ample room for difference
of opinion as to the best way to pre
serve peace. This difference of opin
ion leads to controversy, and contro
versy to truth. When truth comes we
need not fear for the safety of our
country.
"I can assure you the army is not
in favor of war, but it is for adequate
defense. The trouble with us in
America is that we display too little
interest in public affairs, such as the
question of self-protection. We ac
cept opinions without the slightest in
credulity—the opinions of men who
are absolutely ignorant of army con
ditions. For a hundred years we have
been too busy developing our internal
resources to pay attention to what is
taking place in Europe, and to acquire
a modern view of conditions.
"The ocean is no longer a barrier.
Ten thousand men can be transported
in a few days on one ship. Water is
the easiest method of transportation
possible. I would lay claim then that
the ocean is a convenience rather
than a barrier to attack.
Defend Standard of Living.
"If you want to maintain the same
high standard of living for future
generations, you must look into arm
ies and navies. You must acquire and
maintain your share of foreign trade.
The very existence of the present
struggling of Europe is dependent up
on their power to maintain their
share of foreign trade. Populations
have outgrown the lands, hence the
absolute necessity, economic solely in
its character, demands a lion share of
foreign trade. The time is coming
when this nation must struggle to
preserve its rights or else surrender
all in which it has pride. Economic
necessity were the causes of Hayes'
Open Door policy of China, and the
Monroe Doctrine. We must back up
these policies.
"1 conscientiously believe the meth
od of preparedness, is to be prepared
to fight. Thirty years have never
passed in the history of this country
without war. The future can be no
different. You young gentlemen have
the opportunity to take the lead. If
we ever have war everyone will have
to go to the front. We would need
fifty thousand officers at the outset,
and twice that number before the
conclusion. Do you want to be one of
the fifty thousand or one of the ten
million
"If you believe there is no danger
of war, and I had one million and one
dollars, I would gladly give one mill
ion for your optimism. Yet I'm just
a good enough American to believe if
the time arises, we'll fight!"
President Wilbur* Advocates Scheme.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur is an
ardent advocate of the proposed vol
untary military training scheme. He
stated in opening the mass meeting:
"I think we all want peace. The
best way to secure it, is to be so well
prepared that we cannot be attacked,
and thus settle the world question
for one hundred years. If not, war is
inevitable. The waste time of stu
dents could be spent in such training
as is advocated tonight. Thereby we
would both do ourselves a personal
favor and the country a lasting good."
George Presley, for three years
coach of Stanford varsities, pointed
out the attitude of the Cardinal alum
ni regarding the proposal. ITe said,
in part: "To anyone who has paid
the slightest attention to events in
Europe, it is apparent that we must
take some steps of preparedness.
(The actual booming of guns is too
often the declaration of war). Every
one present wants to do his share,
but anything we might do—no matter
how patriotic, would be futile unless
we were trained. The alumni, in San
Francisco, one hundred and fifty
strong, have been learning the arts
of warfare for the past month. They
realize the necessity. All are en
thusiastic, and only regret that they
did not have the opportunity while
attending Stanford. College men all
over the country are doing what you
Stanford men are now advocating. Tt
will be a source of great pleasure
to you.
"Do something, and do it right
away!"
