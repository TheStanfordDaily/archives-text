# Here's How!

"In the Spring a young man's fancy
(and a young lady's) lightly turn to
thoughts of —Junior Week." We are
not convinced that the object of fancy
is the same as that expressed in the
familiar form of this quotation, in
spite of all the contentions of campus
romance writers. But Junior Week is
a mad, merry week, and it's with us.
If hard and conscientious committee
work insures a good Junior Week, and
we think it does, this year's festival
week is going to be one of the best.
And the committee has been more
than working hard —they've been
thinking hard, too, about ways and
means in which to get Junior Week
over as the best sort of a joy-time.
The Daily Palo Alto takes this op
portunity to wish everybody on the
campus a Merry Junior Week time,
and an enjoyable vacation during the
following week.
