# CAST HOLDS DRESS REHEARSAL
## Junior Opera Now Ready For Final Performance 
### 
Tonight will see the final dress re
hearsal of "In Dutch," the 1917 opera
with a melody, before the curtain
rises tomorrow evening on the tulip
bedecked scene of the world-renowned
conservatory at Aurora, Long Island.
An augmented orchestra of eight ad
ditional pieces has been imported to
assist the local talent as "makers of
sound."
How Tliey Can Dance!
The opening act reveals the home
of Mr. Van Zant, filled with guests
awaiting the arrival of his daughter,
Peggy, from boarding school. How
ever, instead, Mrs. Smithers, with her
delightful titter, who thinks she
knows how to run things, arrives with
her daughter, lone, as well as a half
dozen seminary maids, who will be
the envy of all the campus in their
Vogue creations. Then, too, there are
the flower maids, the very essense of
demureness, but oh, how they can
dance.
Soon complications arise, for Bill
King, the son of Van Zant's oldest
friend, arrives, not as himself, but as
his butler, for there is always father's
will to be carried out before he earns
the shekels which rightfully belong
to him. Bill King is not merely a

leading man, but a real person, in the
hands of R. G. Wliealton. He has the
time of his life watching Watson, who
is supposed to he Bill, get out of the
mess in which he finally finds him
self.
Heroine Hole Charmingly Portrayed.
Peggy is a charming heroine, and
the part is admirably taken by Miss
Edith Harvey, who, needless to say, is
always the center of attraction. Wat
son, as portrayed by Dave Smith, is
the real comedian, and his work wifh
Miss Angie Cross, as Tinker Jones, is
unsurpassed. Miss Cross takes the
part of the fascinating Jones to per
fection.
The entire cast is the best that has
ever appeared on the Assembly Hall
stage in any musical show. Never
has there been such choruses, such
scenic effects, or such music, as will
be seen and heard at the performance
of "In Dutch."
Seat Sale Largest in History.
The seat sale is the largest that any
musical production has ever had at
Stanford. Only a few fifty cent seats
still remain. Persons who will be
unable to attend Thursday evening's
production will lie admitted this eve
ning. Admission will be fifty cents.

Tonight will see the final dress re
hearsal of "In Dutch," the 1917 opera
with a melody, before the curtain
rises tomorrow evening on the tulip
bedecked scene of the world-renowned
conservatory at Aurora, Long Island.
An augmented orchestra of eight ad
ditional pieces has been imported to

sound."
How Tliey Can Dance!
The opening act reveals the home
of Mr. Van Zant, filled with guests
awaiting the arrival of his daughter,
Peggy, from boarding school. How
ever, instead, Mrs. Smithers, with her
delightful titter, who thinks she
knows how to run things, arrives with
her daughter, lone, as well as a half
dozen seminary maids, who will be
the envy of all the campus in their
Vogue creations. Then, too, there are
the flower maids, the very essense of
demureness, but oh, how they can
dance.
Soon complications arise, for Bill
King, the son of Van Zant's oldest
friend, arrives, not as himself, but as
his butler, for there is always father's
will to be carried out before he earns
the shekels which rightfully belong
to him. Bill King is not merely a

leading man, but a real person, in the
hands of R. G. Wliealton. He has the
time of his life watching Watson, who
is supposed to he Bill, get out of the
mess in which he finally finds him
self.
Heroine Hole Charmingly Portrayed.
Peggy is a charming heroine, and
the part is admirably taken by Miss
Edith Harvey, who, needless to say, is
always the center of attraction. Wat
son, as portrayed by Dave Smith, is
the real comedian, and his work wifh
Miss Angie Cross, as Tinker Jones, is
unsurpassed. Miss Cross takes the
part of the fascinating Jones to per
fection.
The entire cast is the best that has
ever appeared on the Assembly Hall
stage in any musical show. Never
has there been such choruses, such
scenic effects, or such music, as will
be seen and heard at the performance
of "In Dutch."
