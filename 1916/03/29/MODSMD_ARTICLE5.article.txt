# JUNIOR WEEK PROGRAM BEGINS TONIGHT AT LAGUNITA
## BIG FIREWORKS ON LAKE Glee Club, Band and Hawaiian Quartet to Compete For Approval 
### 
Bedecked with Japanese lanterns
and otherwise decorated for the oc
casion, Lagunita will be the scene this
evening of the first of Junior Week's
many entertainments. Beginning
promptly at 7::i0 o'clock, and contin
uing for two hours, a varied pro
gram will be furnished by the Stan
ford hand, the glee club, a Hawaiian
quartet, and a fireworks display.
Music Rolls Over Water.
For the first time, the Lagunita fes
tivities will be featured by having the
music emanate from the band and
glee club, stationed out upon the
water. In other years it was found
to be a drawback to have the band
and other musical organizations on
the shore. The new plan will enable
the audience to enjoy the offerings
to better advantage.
