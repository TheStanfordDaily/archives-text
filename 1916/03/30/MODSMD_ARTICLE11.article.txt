# Tropical Plants to Grace Inner Courts of Stanford Quadrangle
## 
### 
Campus improvements are to bo car
ried on in real earnest during tlie
coming spring vacation, and work in
tlie courts of the Quadrangle is ex
pected to lie completed by the end
of next month. Through the efforts
of Ralph Arnold. '!)9. or the Stanford
Hoard of Trustees, orange, lemon, and
grape-fruit trees are being donated
by southern alumni for tlie court back
of the History building. Eugenias are
to be planted in the corners.
Paths are to he made to follow the
lines now traveled and roads will he
laid between. Evergreen hedges,
which have been planted along the
sidewalks, arc to no trimmed with
cypress trees to make a regular hedge.
It is the idea of thr trustees to give
the courts a semi-tropical air. With
this in view, magnolias, oleanders and
shrubs native to the tropics, have boon
ordered.
