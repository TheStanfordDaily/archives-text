# A
						Warning
## 
### 
From all indications, the Juniors
mean business this year, in pronounc
ing a ban on flowers and taxis for the
Junior Prom. In years past this col
umn has been given up to more or
less vain espousal of democracy, to
pleas for the preservation of a Stan
ford ideal, and commendation of the
Juniors' stand on the "flowers and
carriages problem."
Today we wish to express our un
qualified approval of all these past
sentiments, but further add a warning
to those who might choose to disre
gard the "writing on the wall." We
have it from good sources that the
penalty for this disregard will be of
a substantial nature tomorrow eve
ning.
