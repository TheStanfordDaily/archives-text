A Junior stood in the postoffice this
morning with si face that made every
body stop, look, and whistle.. Every
one feared to venture a question.
Then a friend came.
Friend —For the love of Jupiter!
Yotir face looks like a red herring in
the sun! What's up, Bill!
Bill—Huh? Oh, nothing's up!
Something's down—ray spirits.
Friend—Rich uncle die?
Bill —No, rich aunt's alive—and this
is Junior Week. And Mary and 1
were signed up for 60 hours together
between now and next Monday.
Friend—Of course! Quite natural!
Bill (tearfully)— But now every
thing's busted up!
Friend —Well, she'll send a substi
tute!
Bill (swearing)—D— —! It isn't
that! That aunt is too alive! She's
coming down here this noon for the
week-end! Just had a telegram.
Friend —Oh, cruel Fate!
Bill—Oh, mean Destiny!
Friend—Oh, well, you can shove the
aunt onto some grownup friend!
Bill —She's bringing her daughter—
18 years old.
Friend —Easy! Shove the daughter
and aunt onto someone else al
together!
Bill —They'll be sore enough for
horse liniment. Can't, anyway. They
invited me up to their ranch at Blue
Bluff or somewhere —I refused, but
said I'd spend the summer with them.
Friend—My sympathy, Bill. I've got
to go now, but if I didn't have a date,
you know I'd help you. S'long!
Bill —Say, wait a minute! Want to
ask you a simple question.
Friend—Shoot!
Bill—ls chloroform very expensive?
