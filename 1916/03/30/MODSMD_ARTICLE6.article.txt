# JUNIOR WEEK IS SECOND TO NONE IN GAY SEND OFF

"With Spring iu the air
And a song in your heart,
All nature looks fair
With Spring in the air.
And it's easy to dare
Anything if you start
With Spring in the air
And a song in your heart."
Such was the atmosphere of last
night's festivities at Lagunita. Nine
teen seventeen made things go. Di
version- from the usual first night
stunts, such as the introduction of a
Hawaiian quartet, and the (jlee Club
music drifting over the water, were
- appreciated, and both queeners and
non-queeners caught the spirit of
l gaiety.
Spring was in flie Air.
From the opening chords of the of
i ticial "Junior Day" march, by Maurice
Blumenthal, 'lfi, to the last note of
| "Hail, Stanford, Hail." the evening
was a success. Campus romance
seekers were happy—as were also the
roughs. Spring was certainly "in the
| air."
With such a send-off, the 1917 week
i bids fair to carry off first honors.
More seats are being offered for to-
I night's opera because of alterations
which have been made in the seating
capacity of Assembly Hall. These
sixty seats will lie sold at the box
office this evening.
Prom Tomorrow Night.
The gymnasium—Junior Prom ball
| room—is already a thing of beauty,
and the line for tickets at Wideman's
store prophesies a scramble for the
hundred and fiftieth card.
The committee announces that
Prom tickets must lie presented at the
door—there will be no admittance
without them. As lias previously been
announced, flowers will not be in
vogue—and spending one's money for
them will be rather useless, as ladies
I will be requested to take them off.
| Dancing begins at 8:45 sharp, to the
I tunc of the"In Dutch" music.
Holdovers Planning .Hamilton.
Alter such formalities the delight
, fully unconventional Irish marathon,
of Saturday morning, with its three
legged and handicap races and hold
over stunts, will be a relief. A
breathing space, as it were. The
campus population takes well to ex
tremes and the "easy to dare every
thing" spirit lias certainly taken hold
of things generally at Stanford.
