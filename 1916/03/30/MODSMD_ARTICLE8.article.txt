"One more day and we'll be free
From this school of misery!"
—Old Ballad.
Hooray! Vacation is here, and here
to stay—for ten days of twenty-four
hours each. That makes a total of
14,409 minutes in which, like the
busy bee, "to improve each shining
hour."
Everybody, from Duck, the Chinese
i cook, down to editors, professors, and
i presidents, will have a happy time
until the call of the campus rings
again on April 10th. There's the open
road a-calling, and the old swimmin'
hole, with its pollywogs and bugs, is
beckoning.
Although the library will be open
I from 8:30 to 4:30, each day, you will
i not find your friends there. For this
jis vacation time, and for ten long
; days "we'll be tree, from this school
I and faculty."
