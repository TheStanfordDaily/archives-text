# JUNIORS SCORE AS "IN DUTCH" WINS CAMPUS
## STAGING CLEVERLY EXECUTED Edith Harvey, Angie Cross, D.M. Smith and R.G. Whealton Share Honors 
### 
With no outstanding so"ng hits, but
all musical numbers well received be
cause of their clever presentation, "In
Dutch," the 1917 Junior Opera, scored
a distinct and uncompromising suc
cess in the Assembly Hall production
last evening. The plot, that feature
too often missing in amateur musical
comedy, was well worked out, readily
lending itself as a structure about
which to weave the many songs and
dances. J. R. Morgan, '16, author
producer, succeeded in his dual role,
as was amply testified to by the re
ception accorded the presentation by
the crowded house. J. T. Reynolds,
'18, and H. D. Fansler, '19, the authors
of the rythmic melodies, furnished an
excellent basis for Morgan's cleverly
evolved chorus numbers.
Songs Are Popnlar.
If there was any weakness in the
plot it was the fact that too much
was revealed before the close. Th£
first act was unexcelled for a college
production, but at the end of the
scene the audience was left wonder
ing what more there was to develop.
The second act was on a par with
the first in the quality of the music,
but was rather the presentation of a
series of incidents than the develop
ment of any plan. "Marry the Wed
ding Belles," the opening number in
the second scene, was one of the clev
erest of the evening, rivalling "In
Dutch," which came early in the play.
"In June," "When [ Have Married
You," and "My Tulip Queen," were tlj,e
songs which were remembered be
cause of their musical quality.
Leads Well Taken.
The leading roles were exceedingly
well taken. Miss Edith Harvey, '17,
as "Peggy," and Miss Angie Cross,
'17, playing the role of "Tinker
Jones," shared hojjors for the fem
inine parts. It is hard to say that
either played the "lead," as each was
superior in her particular work. Miss
Harvey's voice was wonderfully clear
in quality, and she sang her way into
the hearts of the audience with ease.
She would have been able to have
taken a more prominent part than
was assigned her in some portions of
the "farce with music." Miss Cross
was the life" of the show. Her en
thusiastic presentation prevented the
play from ever becoming monotonous.
Smith and Wheatton Please.
D. M. Smith, '19, and R. G. Wheal
ton, '19, in the roles of "\Vatson" and
"William King," played the important
male parts. Smith was particularly
well adapted to his part, his pleasing
personality winning him a favorable
reception throughout the Evening.
Though lacking somewhat in volume,
Whealton'a voice was rich in quality.
The alternating between being butler
and millionaire, which characterized
the playing of "Watson" and "King,"
was an interesting feature of the plot.
New Stars Appear.
Of the four players who scored ex
ceptionally, all except Miss Harvey
are nfcw in campus dramatic produc
tions. Miss Harvey took part in "Stop
Thief," last semester. The majority
of the mipor parts, as well, were
taken by students heretofore unknown
to Assembly Hall audiences.
Characters Well Chosen.
Minor parts were all very well
handled. Miss Velona Pilcher, '18,
laughed her way to success as "Mrs.
Smithers," quaint, teacher of the New
York seminary, who thought she
could manage things, and Miss Ger
maine Levy, '17, filled a difficult part
acceptably. The male characters
showed that they had been chosen
with care. Richard Derby, '19, as
"Herr Van Zandt," owner of the tulip
garden, played his part with the
pathos demanded, while P. H. Hearle,
'18, brought many an applause with
his "simply a killer, a knockout, I
say." C. E. Joyce, '16, danced and
sang well in the second act, filling the
part of "Scott," the detective, in pleas
ing style. H. H. Dievendorff, '17, was
a "scream" in the part of "Pat," deaf
and dumb tulip gardener.
Masterly Ensemble.
Chorus work, executed by House
keepers, Seminary Maids, Guests, and
Gardeners, in gay costume, distinctly
featured the production. Morgan de
serves great credit for the ensembles
that stood out as splendid stage pic
tures, while the encores were pleas
ant surprises, helped greatly by light
ing effects, especially in the second
act. The enlarged stage gave oppor
tunity for excellent scenic display, all
combining to make the 1917 Junior
Opera a success from the rise of the
curtain to the happy ending. ,

acceptably. The male characters
showed that they had been chosen
with care. Richard Derby, '19, as
"Herr Van Zandt," owner of the tulip
garden, played his part with the
pathos demanded, while P. H. Hearle,
'18, brought many an applause with
his "simply a killer, a knockout, I
say." C. E. Joyce, '16, danced and
sang well in the second act, filling the
part of "Scott," the detective, in pleas
ing style. H. H. Dievendorff, '17, was
a "scream" in the part of "Pat," deaf
and dumb tulip gardener.
Masterly Ensemble.
Chorus work, executed by House
keepers, Seminary Maids, Guests, and
Gardeners, in gay costume, distinctly
featured the production. Morgan de
serves great credit for the ensembles
that stood out as splendid stage pic
tures, while the encores were pleas
ant surprises, helped greatly by light
ing effects, especially in the second
act. The enlarged stage gave oppor
tunity for excellent scenic display, all
combining to make the 1917 Junior
Opera a success from the rise of the
curtain to the happy ending. ,
With no outstanding so"ng hits, but
all musical numbers well received be
cause of their clever presentation, "In
Dutch," the 1917 Junior Opera, scored
a distinct and uncompromising suc
cess in the Assembly Hall production
last evening. The plot, that feature
too often missing in amateur musical
comedy, was well worked out, readily
lending itself as a structure about
which to weave the many songs and
dances. J. R. Morgan, '16, author
producer, succeeded in his dual role,
as was amply testified to by the re
ception accorded the presentation by
the crowded house. J. T. Reynolds,
'18, and H. D. Fansler, '19, the authors
of the rythmic melodies, furnished an
excellent basis for Morgan's cleverly
evolved chorus numbers.
Songs Are Popnlar.
If there was any weakness in the
plot it was the fact that too much
was revealed before the close. Th£
first act was unexcelled for a college
production, but at the end of the
scene the audience was left wonder
ing what more there was to develop.
The second act was on a par with
the first in the quality of the music,
but was rather the presentation of a
series of incidents than the develop
ment of any plan. "Marry the Wed
ding Belles," the opening number in
the second scene, was one of the clev
erest of the evening, rivalling "In
Dutch," which came early in the play.
"In June," "When [ Have Married
You," and "My Tulip Queen," were tlj,e
songs which were remembered be
cause of their musical quality.
Leads Well Taken.
The leading roles were exceedingly
well taken. Miss Edith Harvey, '17,
as "Peggy," and Miss Angie Cross,
'17, playing the role of "Tinker
Jones," shared hojjors for the fem
inine parts. It is hard to say that
either played the "lead," as each was
superior in her particular work. Miss
Harvey's voice was wonderfully clear
in quality, and she sang her way into
the hearts of the audience with ease.
She would have been able to have
taken a more prominent part than
was assigned her in some portions of
the "farce with music." Miss Cross
was the life" of the show. Her en
thusiastic presentation prevented the
play from ever becoming monotonous.
Smith and Wheatton Please.
D. M. Smith, '19, and R. G. Wheal
ton, '19, in the roles of "\Vatson" and
"William King," played the important
male parts. Smith was particularly
well adapted to his part, his pleasing
personality winning him a favorable
reception throughout the Evening.
Though lacking somewhat in volume,
Whealton'a voice was rich in quality.
The alternating between being butler
and millionaire, which characterized
the playing of "Watson" and "King,"
was an interesting feature of the plot.
New Stars Appear.
Of the four players who scored ex
ceptionally, all except Miss Harvey
are nfcw in campus dramatic produc
tions. Miss Harvey took part in "Stop
Thief," last semester. The majority
of the mipor parts, as well, were
taken by students heretofore unknown
to Assembly Hall audiences.
Characters Well Chosen.
Minor parts were all very well
handled. Miss Velona Pilcher, '18,
laughed her way to success as "Mrs.
Smithers," quaint, teacher of the New
York seminary, who thought she
could manage things, and Miss Ger
maine Levy, '17, filled a difficult part
acceptably. The male characters
showed that they had been chosen

ton, '19, in the roles of "\Vatson" and
"William King," played the important
male parts. Smith was particularly
well adapted to his part, his pleasing
personality winning him a favorable
reception throughout the Evening.
Though lacking somewhat in volume,
Whealton'a voice was rich in quality.
The alternating between being butler
and millionaire, which characterized
the playing of "Watson" and "King,"
was an interesting feature of the plot.
New Stars Appear.
Of the four players who scored ex
ceptionally, all except Miss Harvey
are nfcw in campus dramatic produc
tions. Miss Harvey took part in "Stop
Thief," last semester. The majority
of the mipor parts, as well, were
taken by students heretofore unknown
to Assembly Hall audiences.
Characters Well Chosen.
Minor parts were all very well
handled. Miss Velona Pilcher, '18,
laughed her way to success as "Mrs.
Smithers," quaint, teacher of the New
York seminary, who thought she
could manage things, and Miss Ger
maine Levy, '17, filled a difficult part
acceptably. The male characters
showed that they had been chosen
with care. Richard Derby, '19, as
"Herr Van Zandt," owner of the tulip
garden, played his part with the
pathos demanded, while P. H. Hearle,
'18, brought many an applause with
his "simply a killer, a knockout, I
say." C. E. Joyce, '16, danced and
sang well in the second act, filling the
part of "Scott," the detective, in pleas
ing style. H. H. Dievendorff, '17, was
a "scream" in the part of "Pat," deaf
and dumb tulip gardener.
Masterly Ensemble.
Chorus work, executed by House
keepers, Seminary Maids, Guests, and
Gardeners, in gay costume, distinctly
featured the production. Morgan de
serves great credit for the ensembles
that stood out as splendid stage pic
tures, while the encores were pleas
ant surprises, helped greatly by light
ing effects, especially in the second
act. The enlarged stage gave oppor
tunity for excellent scenic display, all
combining to make the 1917 Junior
Opera a success from the rise of the
curtain to the happy ending. ,
