# Problems For 1919
## 
### 
Once each year the freshmen mem
bers of The Daily Palo Alto staff are
given a free liapd in publishing the
day's paper. This charge '19 has un
dertaken tod'ay with the feeling that
permission to edit the Junior Day is
sue carries with it not only a duty
and a privilege, but an opportunity
as well —an opportunity to present in
this columu matters essential to the
class of 1919.

"The freshman of today is the sen
ior of tomorrow," Is apt quotation—
provided, of course, that the faculty
ax is avoided. But on the way to
cords and sombrero, the "senior of to
morrow" becomes for a time a sopho
more. As wearer of the red hat he
is in a position to dominate the un
derclass life of the University. For
trie past few years the. sophomores,
feeling their oats after a year of sub
mission, and the incoming freshmen,
"coached" by self-appointed upper
classmen, have staged spectacles dur
ing the first days of the fall term
which have won the rebuke of the
University's executives.

In his address to the student body
early in September, last year, Dr.
Branner said: "We can no longer
tolerate the type of interclass rivalry
which has manifested itself during the
past week. The sophomore class of
next year must find some other way
of conducting the opening day activi
ties." Just the other day, President
Vincent of the University of Minne
sota stated in an interview that un
regulated class rivalry smacks too
much of the prehistoric to be found
in a modern university.

This brings up the question: What
steps will the class of 1919 take to
eliminate the objectionable—not to
say intolerable —features of the first
days' fights? These mix-ups which
occur early in Septertiber are not a
tradition. They are a mushroom
growth of recent, origin. To cast
them out wilf shake no institution
of sound development. Did not the
upper classes throw out the equally
purposeless Plug Ugly?

Even freshmen, especially ones
who are soon to become sophomores,
admit the necessity of freshman dis
cipline—at proper times. Hazing has
been officially tabooed. Methods of
applying discipline will be more re
stricted in the future. Would it not
then be wiser to apply it only in
proper doses at the risht time, than
to parcel it out. promiscuously, as it
must need be if administered during
the first week of college?

It may seem a far cry to bring up
September plans in of Jun
ior Week's festivities. Consideration,

however, will show that It is none too
early. The present freshman class is
coming-in with a new era. A new
president, the first of the alumni, has
been installed. Added privileges in
the way of freshman intercollegiate
contests have been returned after six
years' prohibition. Why not make a
stand for enlightened underclass riv
alry? Ivet's keep the tie-up, by all
means—and increase the number of
regulated underelrte athletic con
tests. Hut the remainder of sopho
more-freshman fights—few will weep
at their elimination.
