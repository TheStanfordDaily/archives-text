# Cardinal Nine For U.C. Game Chosen
## Choice of Pitcher for First Game of the Series Not Yet Certain 
### 
Baseball fans have but one week to
wait for the opening varsity game
between Stanford and the University
of California. Both teams have
settled down to the final grind, each
squad having but one more practice
contest. The first game of the "Big
Series" is slated for the Berkeley field
on Saturday, April Bth. The "play
ball" signal will be given at 3 o'clock,
the admission price agreed upon by
the managements of the two institu
tions, being fifty cents.
Final Lineups Announced.
It Is hard to tell just what the final
lineup will be, but Captain Dent gave
out the information last night that
the team will go to bat in the follow
ing order, unless something unfor
seen happens:
Stafford, 2b.
Lander, cf.
Dent, c.
Hayes, lb.
Noonan, rf.
Ftihlman. If.
Stevens, ss.
Hensel, 3b.
Pitching Selection, a Mystery.
The pitching selection is a mystery
to all but Captain Dent and Coach
.Tack McCarthy. They prefer to keep
their secret for the present, leaving
the diamond enthusiasts to guess
whether the final choice will fall to
Wickersham, Hoever, Howe, or Mat
tel. Odds seem to favor the former,
as there are five left-handed hitters
on the Blue and Gold lineup.
Prospects Look Bright.
Prospects for a winner look brighter
than ever. The Infield, although
shifted to startle the conservative
baseball follower, is working as a
unit, while the fly chasers are more
than covering their territory. The
hitting of the team has been gradually
getting better, while the men are run
ning bases in nxeellent style. All
these qualities point to a close con
test in the first Big Game with the
Cardinal on the long end.
