# Variety of Contests Features Interclass Regatta at Lagunita
## 
### 
Seniors, juniors, sophomores, and
freshmen met in a variety of contests
on Lagunita this morning. Events
were run off with so little delay that
the hand hardly had an opportunity
to render its part of the program.
Queeners and roughs thronged the
banks, and Junior Week spirit flour
ished in the brilliant sunshine.
Gives Diving Exhibition.
Kirksey and Penniman won handily
in the swimming sprints, and the lat
ter also captured the marathon event.
In diving, Kirksey and Kahle were
about equally good. Coach Ernie
Brandsten gave several exhibitions of
dives "as they should be dove."
Ruckland's canoe was a regular buck
ing broncho in the canoe race, never
theless it had the required speed.
