# CREW MEN RETURN FROM NORTH
## Defeat Is Unaccountable, Says Coach in His Statement 
### 
Stanford's varsity crow eight ar
rived in San Francisco this noon on
the "Beaver" from Seattle, where
they met defeat at the hands of the
University of Washington eight on
Friday. Some of the men arrived on
the campus during the afternoon, and
the remainder will follow this eve
ning.
Conch (Jives Statement.
Coacli "Husky" Guerena, who ar
rived in the city yesterday, having
come down by train, today gave out
the following statement:
"Anyone who has seen the Stanford
crew in practice would not have rec
ognized it in the race. The boat was
dead, and would not respond to the
exertions of the oarsmen. The cus
tomary run between strokes, which
has varied from eight to fourteen feet
in practice, dwindled to three feet in
the race.
Try Fast and Slow Strokes.
"Neither a fast nor slow stroke was
able to overcome this trouble. Cap
tain Orme was twelve pounds under
weight, and proved to be in no condi
tion to row in the race. Worries over
his responsibilities were the cause of
liis poor showing.
"Washington jumped into the lead

early in the race, and the task of
rowing well from behind was too
much for the bow three, two of whom
were new men. Orme was the first
to collapse, and was followed quickly
by the men in the bow.
Lose lly Nino Lengths.
"Washington's time was slow for a
championship race. That is not meant
to detract from Washington's showing,
but is proof together with the fact
I that we lost by nine .not five, lengths,
I that there was something radically
I wrong.
Ilace Is History.
"The result, of course, was disap
pointing, but the race is now history,
and every effort will from now on be
j bent, towards preparing the crew
for the race with the University of
California on April 22.
"The freshman and second varsity
trews will go on training table to-
I night. The varsity men will resume
i
training at Redwood tomorrow after
noon and will return to the training
! table following tomorrow's workout."
Knee Friday Afternoon.
The race between Stanford and
I Washington was run on Lake Wasli
j ington, Friday afternoon, under ideal
