# TRUSTEES ABOLISH GYM CREDIT
## 
### 
Stanford students will no longer he
given eredit for gymnasium work, as a
result of action taken by the Board
of Trustees at their last meeting, Fri
day, March 31. Both men and women
students will he affected by this
ruling. The change severs to a great
extent the connection between the aca
demic part of University life and ath
letics. A very decided effort, however,
will be made to bring about natural
and spontaneous development of ath
letics, and to encourage physical ex
ercise by all students of the Univer
sity.
Five Dollar Fee Required.
A gymnasium fee of live dollars a
semester will be required from all un- ,
dergraduate men and women students
upon registration, and from all grad
uate students and faculty members
who make use of the gymnasium facil
ities. Funds so collected will be ex
pended to pay gymnasium instructors
and coaches for the various sports.
The salaries of the coaches may be
supplemented by the Associated Stu
dents.

| Initiative in the matter of securing
coaches will be in the hands of the
Associated Students, subject to the ap
proval of an Advisory Athletic Board
and the President of the University.
The entire scheme conforms with the
recommendations of the Advisory
Athletic Board recently named by
President Wilbur, the Associated Stu
dents, and the alumni, to consider the
whole athletic situation, which settled
the problem of coaches a short time
ago.
Regular Gymnasium Classes.
Regular gymnasium classes will
continue to be held for those making
application, and athletic sports will
be conducted, along with physical
training, as an integral part of the
work of the University. Efforts will
be made to increase the interest of the
students in a variety of sports, and to
develop their skill in them.
Swimming Pool for Women.
A swimming pool will be built for
the women and will be ready for use
at the opening of the next college
year. This pool is situated on the plot
reserved for women's athletics, at the
west of the Quadrangle. The ex
cavating work was finished some time
ago. Ultimately the pool will be sur
rounded by the structure of a new
gymnasium for women. About $15,000
will be expended on the present work.
Behind the men's gymnasium a large
space enclosed by a hedge recently
planted will be covered by a macadam
ized surface for outdoor exercises.
