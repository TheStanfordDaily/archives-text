# Exit Pessimism!
## 
### 
We might as well look facts in the
face and admit that Stanford has had
a had week in sports. No amount of
sugar coating will cover up that bitter
truth. Hut things aren't half as bad
as a few calamity howlers around here
would have us believe. There's no
use trying to convince that few, be
cause they firmly believe that things
have gone to rot at Stanford. This
is just a word to the many who
might absorb a bit of that pessimism
which lurks around the campus.
Stanford athletics aren't dead yet.
A little optimism will help a lot in
enabling Stanford to grab all the big
gest things on the spring sports cal
endar. Play like the Stanford nine in
dulged in last Saturday is a thing to
be proud of in any league, even if one
run in the fourteenth inning did cut
off a Stanford win. We offer Captain
Dent's men hearty congratulations on
playing a brand of ball that would
bring home the pennant most any
year. And there's two games to go!
We have Coach Guerena's word for
it that Stanford has a better crew this
year than last. That assurance is
based on the showing of the whole
season, and a single event, the Wash
ington race, can't controvert it. Two
big events of the crew season, the
California and the Poughkeepsie re
gattas, are still ahead for Stanford's
1916 eight to win.
Tt's a safe bet that every man who
wears the Cardinal this spring will
give his best in his sport. We'd ask
odds right now in a bet that every
man on the campus was backing the
teams to his utmost. The teams need
that support.
