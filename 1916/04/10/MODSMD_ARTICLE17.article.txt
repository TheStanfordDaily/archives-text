# Women Lose Tennis Meet to California on April 1
## 
### 
California and Stanford women held
their first interclass intercollegiate
tennis tournament at Encina courts
on Saturday, April 1. Three matches
in each class were played off â€”first
and second singles and first doubles.
Miss Maud Lowell, '16, was the only
Stanford player to win her match, de
feating Miss Marjory Highland of
California by a score of 6-2, 9-7.
All the matches showed high grade
tennis, but the Stanford women were
outplayed by their opponents. How
ever, as the main object of the meet
was to gain tournament experience
for varsity contests the results could
not be considered an entire failure.
On April 22nd the varsity teams will
hold their annual tournament at Cali
fornia. The teams will consist of five
players from each university, and five
singles and two doubles matches will
be played. Maud Lowell, '16, Made
line Turner, '16, Ellen Andrews, '16,
and Ethel Lee, '19, have been chosen
to fill the first four places, and the
remaining one is still open.
