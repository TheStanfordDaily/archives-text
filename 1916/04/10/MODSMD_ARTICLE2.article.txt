Draper Pitches.
Draper, who had been declared in
eligible for varsity competition, start

he would make un in nart for the ab
sence of Captain Cowan, who was
found ineligible at a late hour, and
the star of the team. Mel Shriver, who
was injured the night before the
game.
First Game Poor.
Heavy hitting, combined with tight
playing, gave the visitors an easy vic
tory in the first game. E. Mitchell,
catcher of the Cardinals, was the only
light in a dark sky. He hammered
out two of the three hits obtained off
the offerings of Wake Hill. Peterson
