# Freshman Baseball Nine Meets Defeat
## California Wins Series From Crippled Stanford Teams in Straight Games 
### 
Crippled beyond immediate repair,
the Stanford freshmen baseball team
lost the "series" to the University of
California first-year tossers in straight
games, the first being played on the
Cardinal diamond on Saturday, April
Ist, while the deciding contest took
place on the Herekcley lot, the follow
ing Wednesday, The wearers of the
Ulue and Gold romped away with the
initial tangle, scoring seven runs and
blanking the locals. Presenting a bet
ter lineup, the Cardinal freshmen
made a real battle out of the second
contest, the final score going against
them. 5 to 4.
Draper Pitches.
Draper, who had been declared in
eligible for varsity competition, start
ed in the box, and it was hoped that
he would make un in nart for the ab
sence of Captain Cowan, who was
found ineligible at a late hour, and
the star of the team. Mel Shriver, who
was injured the night before the
game.
First Game Poor.
Heavy hitting, combined with tight
playing, gave the visitors an easy vic
tory in the first game. E. Mitchell,
catcher of the Cardinals, was the only
light in a dark sky. He hammered
out two of the three hits obtained off
the offerings of Wake Hill. Peterson
replaced Draper in the eighth Inning.
Second Game Tough.
With Shriver playing short and
Peterson pitching in whirlwind form,
the second game should have ended
in a Cardinal victory, but the horse
shoe seemed to repose safely on the
Blue and Gold bench, for all of the
breaks went against Stanford. Hill
was knocked out of the box in the
fifth frame and Uhl, who replaced
him, was in hot water on two occas
ions.
Ryan, left fielder on the Stanford
nine, drove in two runs with a single
and a long double. Peterson, with
two singles, Messick with a three-bag
ger and a single, Boydston, E. Mit
chell, and R. Mitchell, with one base
hits apiece, did the remainder of the
hitting.
