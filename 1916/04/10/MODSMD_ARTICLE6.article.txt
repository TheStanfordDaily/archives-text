### 
M. J. House, captain of the fresh
man track team which met the Uni
versity of California first-year squad
on the Herekeley oval, Saturday af
ternoon, and was defeated by the
score of (55 1-3 to 56 2-3, was the sen
sation of the meet. He made a total
of twenty-three points in five events,
and incidentally bettered the Stan
ford-California intercollegiate low
hurdle record of :24 4-5 by two-fifths
of a second.
Kelny Decisive.
The outcome of the meet depended
on the relay. After overcoming a big
lead in the last lap, Pelouze was un
able to hold the ground he had
gained, and was overtaken on the
home stretli by Pitts, of California,
who broke the tape a stride ahead of
the former, thereby winning the meet
for California. The Cardinal babes
still had a chance to tie the score by
taking three places in the pole vault,
but this hope soon fled, and Cali
fornia was the winner by a fraction
over eight points.
