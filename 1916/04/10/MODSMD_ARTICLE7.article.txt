Mary Antin, author of ''The Prom
ised Land," and a speaker and writer
of international note, will give an ad
dress in the chapel, Wednesday eve
ning, under the auspices of the Stan
ford Sociological Society. The talk
will lie on "The Responsibility of
American Citizenship," and will start
at 8 o'clock.
The career of Mary Antin especi
ally fits her for dealing with this
subject, for her life story is that of a
poor Russian immigrant girl who has
risen from the lowliest station to the
ideal appreciation of American citi
zenship.
Emigrating from Russia to the
United States as a girl of thirteen,
Mary Antin has made a study of the
immigration problem from the sym
pathetic standpoint of the immigrant
citizen. The University public is for
tunate in having the opportunity of
hearing on the subject of citizen ship
a speaker who has done so much to
promote understanding between
America and the immigrants who
come to her shores seeking a "prom
ised land."
