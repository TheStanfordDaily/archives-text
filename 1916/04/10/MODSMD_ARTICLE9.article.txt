# BEARS TAKE PITCHERS' BATTLE
## Home Run in Fourteenth Robs Cardinal of First Game 
### 
When Ray Rohwer banned the ball
into the right field bleachers for a
home run, with his brother chasing
around the sacks ahead of him, in the
last of the fourteenth inning, Satur
day, probably the best game of base
ball ever played between Stanford and
tlic University of California came to
an end. The wearers of the Cardinal
had fought gamely, fought with all the
close ones against them, lor fourteen
scoreless innings of thrills, but the
Bruin of the Blue and Gold had con
quered, winning the first game of the
1910 Intercollegiate series by a 1 to 0
score, the home run hero being al
lowed to run only as far as second
base by the enthusiastic Berkeley
rooters. The weather was perfect and
the California stands were filled with
an appreciative crowd of dyed-in-the
wool fans, who joined in a mighty
serpentine after the struggle.
Pitchers' Rattle.
Wickersham and Dimmock were the
main actors in the afternoon's per

tormance, both pitching wonderful
hall all the way. Dimmock might
seem to have a decided advantage, as
he allowed but two hits and fanned
fifteen Stanford bat. wielders to Cali
fornia's eight bingles and seven whiffs,
hut Wickersham's masterly twirling
in the pinches made up for any dif
ference otherwise. Noonan and Staf
ford were the only members of the
locals to connect for base knocks,
while the Rohwer brothers, Starbird
and Dimmock did the hitting for the
opponents.
Fielding Top \otcli.
Fielding rivalling that of the major
leagues was in evidence in nearly
every inning. Young, Hensel, Lander,
and Stafford pulled stops that were of
the sensational order, while Stevens,
Stafford, and Hayes combined in a
beautiful double play. Dent and Fur
long both worked out in great form
behind the plate, the lanky Cardinal
skipper flagging all runners attempt-
ing to pilfer second, while Furlong
was credited with nineteen put-outs
and not a miscue.

When Ray Rohwer banned the ball
into the right field bleachers for a
home run, with his brother chasing
around the sacks ahead of him, in the
last of the fourteenth inning, Satur
day, probably the best game of base
ball ever played between Stanford and
tlic University of California came to
an end. The wearers of the Cardinal
had fought gamely, fought with all the
close ones against them, lor fourteen
scoreless innings of thrills, but the
Bruin of the Blue and Gold had con
quered, winning the first game of the
1910 Intercollegiate series by a 1 to 0
score, the home run hero being al
lowed to run only as far as second
base by the enthusiastic Berkeley
rooters. The weather was perfect and
the California stands were filled with
an appreciative crowd of dyed-in-the
wool fans, who joined in a mighty
serpentine after the struggle.

When Ray Rohwer banned the ball
into the right field bleachers for a
home run, with his brother chasing
around the sacks ahead of him, in the
last of the fourteenth inning, Satur
day, probably the best game of base
ball ever played between Stanford and
tlic University of California came to
an end. The wearers of the Cardinal
had fought gamely, fought with all the
close ones against them, lor fourteen
scoreless innings of thrills, but the
Bruin of the Blue and Gold had con
quered, winning the first game of the
1910 Intercollegiate series by a 1 to 0
score, the home run hero being al
lowed to run only as far as second
base by the enthusiastic Berkeley
rooters. The weather was perfect and
the California stands were filled with
an appreciative crowd of dyed-in-the
wool fans, who joined in a mighty
serpentine after the struggle.
Pitchers' Rattle.
Wickersham and Dimmock were the
main actors in the afternoon's per

tormance, both pitching wonderful
hall all the way. Dimmock might
seem to have a decided advantage, as
he allowed but two hits and fanned
fifteen Stanford bat. wielders to Cali
fornia's eight bingles and seven whiffs,
hut Wickersham's masterly twirling
in the pinches made up for any dif
ference otherwise. Noonan and Staf
ford were the only members of the
locals to connect for base knocks,
while the Rohwer brothers, Starbird
and Dimmock did the hitting for the
opponents.
Fielding Top \otcli.
Fielding rivalling that of the major
leagues was in evidence in nearly
every inning. Young, Hensel, Lander,
and Stafford pulled stops that were of
the sensational order, while Stevens,
Stafford, and Hayes combined in a
beautiful double play. Dent and Fur
long both worked out in great form
behind the plate, the lanky Cardinal
skipper flagging all runners attempt-
ing to pilfer second, while Furlong
was credited with nineteen put-outs
and not a miscue.
