# Senior Insurance Plan For Establishing Fund Meets With Approval
## 
### 
Members of the Senior Insurance
committee have worked out a plan for
the raising of funds to purchase $20,-
000 worth of endowment life insur
ance, and have presented the matter
to all members of the 1910 class in a
circular letter. An endeavor will be
made to induce at least 200 members
of the class to pay $5 each year for
twenty years to cover the cost of the
policies which it is hoped can be
taken out on the lives of ten mem
bers of the class.
Money for University.
The policies will be made payable to
the Board of Trustees. When they
mature at the end of twenty years it
will be definitely decided just what
use will be made of the money. It
is thought that it would not be ad
visable to specify a definite use at this
time, as conditions may change.
In a letter to the members of the
Insurance Committee, President Wil
bur approved the plan as follows:
April 8, 1916.
"The alumni of Stanford are watch
ing with much interest the proposed
plan for endowment insurance now be
ing considered by the Senior Class
The first class to take definite steps
to provide endowment for the Univer
sity will set a mark that will be of
great future advantage. Stanford Uni
versity is a public institution. It is
our duty to administer it, to develop it,
to make it increasingly useful and of
greater service. This duty and pleas
ure belongs to the friends of Stanford
but above all to those who have been
members of the Stanford student body.
Must, Work for Future.
"The University has great hopes
and great needs. We must do all that
we can to assure the future, and each
one should take some part in it, should
have the sense of ownership and of
responsibility. Certainly we would
feel that we had failed in some meas
ure as a University if our graduates
could not succeed in contributing $5
or $10 each year for a period of twen
ty years after graduation. By so doing
a considerable fund could be given the
University for some special purpose to
be determined by proper committees
at a later date when the needs can
be studied and the best choice made.
"I earnestly hope that a beginning
may be made this year. It will mean
deeper interest and closer association
on the part of the alumni and steady
and responsive growth for the Univer
sity."

sity will set a mark that will be of
great future advantage. Stanford Uni
versity is a public institution. It is
our duty to administer it, to develop it,
to make it increasingly useful and of
greater service. This duty and pleas
ure belongs to the friends of Stanford
but above all to those who have been
members of the Stanford student body.
Must, Work for Future.
"The University has great hopes
and great needs. We must do all that
we can to assure the future, and each
one should take some part in it, should
have the sense of ownership and of
responsibility. Certainly we would
feel that we had failed in some meas
ure as a University if our graduates
could not succeed in contributing $5
or $10 each year for a period of twen
ty years after graduation. By so doing
a considerable fund could be given the
University for some special purpose to
be determined by proper committees
at a later date when the needs can
be studied and the best choice made.
"I earnestly hope that a beginning
may be made this year. It will mean
deeper interest and closer association
on the part of the alumni and steady
and responsive growth for the Univer
sity."
