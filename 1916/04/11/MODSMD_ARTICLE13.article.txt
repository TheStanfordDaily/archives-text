# EFFORT BEING MADE TO INTEREST STUDENTS IN SUMMER CAMP
## MEN WANTED AT MONTEREY Military Drill Enthusiasts May Get Sample of Army Training 
### 
A movement has been started by
men interested in military training to
combine the efforts to secure such an
institution at Stanford with those to
set college men for the summer train
ing camp to he held at Monterey from
July 10 to August 5. This is intended
in no way to interfere with a system
of voluntary training at Stanford, but
the purpose is to give the students a
taste of what drill will be like.
Stanford Committee Named.
This camp is intended primarily to
develop officers, and is being boosted
by business men all along the coast.
A committee consisting of Dr. T. M.
Williams, I)r. H. R. Stolz and Asso
ciate Professor E. W. Martin of the
Ireek department, has been appointed
to bring the matter before the men of
Stanford. This committee met last
evening with some of the students
most interested in drill, and an ef
fort will be made to interest men of
the University in attending the camp.
The idea is an extension of the
l'lattsburg camp, at which most of the
eastern universities are represented.
The Western Department of the
United States army has issued a bul
letin explaining the purpose of the
camps, the qualifications necessary to
attendance and other details. In
order to attend the camp a man must
be a citizen of the United States, as
one of the purposes is to foster the
spirit of patriotism. He must be
sound physically, between the age of
18 and 50, and must have at least
reached the senior class in high
school.
Aside from the camp at Monterey,
there will be training at American
Lake, Washington, from August 14 to
September 16, and at Port Douglas,
Utah, from August 21 to September 16.
These are the Western Division camps
only. The government loans most of
the equipment, such as tents, blank
ets, etc., and field essentials, making
the expense very low for each man.
It is estimated that $35 will cover
every expense, including board, and
such clothes as marching shoes, leg
gins, breeches, and other clothes
which may well be utilized for camp
ing trips at any time.
Instruction is given by officers of
the regular army, each company
having attached to it at. least one non
commissioned officer. Each attendant
will be given as much of the funda
mental education of an officer as pos
sible during the time. Those who at
tend will be divided into companies of
infantry, and will be considered as on
a cadet basis.
