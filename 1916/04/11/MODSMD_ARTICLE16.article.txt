# Senior Insurance
## 
### 
The senior class has been given its
opportunity to leave behind at Stan
ford something more worth while
than a memory, a tree which may die
in a year or two, or a class plate of
cold bronze. The Senior Class Insur
ance plan gives an opportunity for
evidencing an appreciation of the four
years' stay here which can't be passed
by lightly.
The graduating classes at other uni
versities have taken out such insur
ance and from present indications the
plan is going to be a big success. In
a few more years a neat bank account
will begin to accrue to the credit of
these classes, which can be used for
purposes worth while in themselves,
which will make it hard for the classes
which come after to forget that the
members of these classes were active
in undergraduate affairs.
Perhaps senior insurance cannot be
taken out in as large amounts at Stan
ford as at other institutions because
of a smaller senior class, but this fact
should not prevent the members of the
1916 class from paying in as much per
member as at other institutions and
building up as large an endowment
fund as possible.
The best part of the plan is that if
the 1916 class starts the policy of
building up an endowment fund this
year, it is going to mean that more
than the $20,000 or $30,000 resulting
will be accumulated for scholarship
funds or other useful purposes. Other
classes are going to follow the same
policy. Should fifty classes do it,
each class leaving $20,000, a million
dollars will be added to the available
funds of the University.
But if this year's class with a fair
start makes a miserable showing in its
support, of senior class insurance,
members of future classes are going
to hesitate before they start plans for
a similar fund.
