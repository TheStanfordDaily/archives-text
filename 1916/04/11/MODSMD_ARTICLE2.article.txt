# Windy Day Brings Medium Seat Sale
## "Five Hundred" Shuns Line-Up For Ram's Head Track Show Drawing 
### 
"Old Sol," J. P., and Company
played a trick on Rani's Head today
by springing a windy day for the
drawing and seat sale, which caused
the following phenomena in the way
of seat selling.
Practically the entire balcony is left
as the result of indisposition on the
part of Stanford's five hundred to line
up in the wind â€”either that, or some
of the five hundred are overconfident
of the tpieening energy of Stanford
men.
Most of the best seats downstairs
were sold out at the Bookstore,
though a few remain. At Weingart
ner's Drug store in Palo Alto a con
siderable number of good seats re
main.
The Junior Opera cast meets to
morrow night in the Assembly Hall at
7:30, to begin rehearsals for the four
skits to be given in the 191 fi Track
Show. The remainder of the nine
lively acts in Ram's Head vaudeville
are being duly whipped into perfect
shape by managers of the organiza
tion.
