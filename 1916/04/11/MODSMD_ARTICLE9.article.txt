# Entries Cause Trouble
## 
### 
Stanford and California coaches,
captains, and graduate managers met
this afternoon at the Olympic Club to
arrange details of the Big Meet next
Saturday and settle on entries.
Up to a late hour this afternoon, no
agreement had been reached on a num
ber of points at issue, according to a
telephone message to The Daily Palo
Alto. The meeting was called at 1
o'clock.
At 4:30 nothing could be given out
for publication. The entry lists had
not been settled upon at that time.
The question of heats, it is thought,
would be one of the biggest issues to
be settled, as Coach Christie demanded
that the hundred and two-twenty be
run in that way.
