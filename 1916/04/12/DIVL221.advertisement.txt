The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
"Tux" has all the sweet, mellow flavor and
rich relish you are looking for in a pipe tobacco
—and that sound, solid, serene l faction that
you get only from Burley leaf.
And you can smoke Tuxedo every time you hap
pen to think of it — all daylong,
if you wish. The "Tuxedo Proc
ess" removes all the harshness,
all the parch, all the bite — and
this original process is used only
in Tuxedo.
