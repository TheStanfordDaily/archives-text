bers of the class who have contrib
uted to the payment of the annual
premiums. It is hoped that the pres
ent, graduating class will be able to
buy ten policies for the aggregate

annual payments for each will be
about $5.
Chairman M. Cody of the Senior
Insurance committee, stated today that
of the three hundred letters which
have been sent to members of (be
1916 class in regard to the plan for
buying endowment life insurance but
twenty have been answered. Ten of
those who have responded to the com
mittee's solicitation have agreed to
assist in financing the insurance plan.
Members of the committee have re
quested that members of the class re
ply at once, in order that it may be
kown definitely whether or not the
idea can be carried out.
Idea Successful at I'.
Participation in the fund will not
be confined to members of the 1916
class, but assistance will be wel
comed from all students who will re
ceive degrees from the University this
year. The plan being advocated by
the seniors is one which has worked
out successfully in other universi
ties. The graduates from the Univer
sity of California of last June took
out $.">O,OOO worth of insurance on
the lives of fifty members of the class.
The present senior class has under
taken to purchase a similar amount.
$<50,000 For Princeton.
At Princeton University the senior
class of this year has adopted an
insurance plan for the purpose of
raising a memorial fund of approxi
mately $60,000 for the university. The
plan is for each member of the class
to take out an insurance policy in
favor of the university. There are
three classes of policies with annual
premiums of from .ft to $1 r>, and with
ultimate values of $100 to $flOO. The
policies will mature in twenty-five
years. The insurance on the lives ol"
any members of the class who may
die before the end of the period will
be devoted to keeping up the policies
of the men who might otherwise allow
their policies to lapse, and any bal
ance will be turned over to the Uni
versity.
The plan proposed for Stanford is
for the entire class to join in paying
the premiums on ten policies. The
purpose of the fund is to establish
scholarships, but the specific use will

bers of the class who have contrib

premiums. It is hoped that the pres
ent, graduating class will be able to
buy ten policies for the aggregate
value of $20,000. If two hundred mem
bers of the class join in the plan the
annual payments for each will be
