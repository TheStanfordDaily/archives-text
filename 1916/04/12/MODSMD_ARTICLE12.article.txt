The activities of the senior commit
tee oil class insurance are being held
up by the luke-warm attitude shown
by the members of the class. The
committee has received twenty an
swers to the letters sent out. An
swers from most of the three hund
red members of the class will have to
be on hand before the committee can
take any further action or can make
any decision.
It is necessary that the members
of the committee shall be able to de
termine immediately the attitude of
the seniors to aid them in determ
ining the feasibility of adopting the
plan. If the seniors determine to
start an endowment fund an immense
amount of routine work will be neces
sary between now and the end of the
semester. So it behooves the 191G
people to answer the committee's let
ter immediately, favorably to the plan
or otherwise, according to their best
judgment.
Most of the people who have dis
cussed senior insurance have been
whole-heartedly for the plan in the
abstract, but see difficulties ahead for
the first two or three years in the
possibility of meeting payments. If
those first feto payments could be
bridged most of the doubters would
be unqualifiedly for senior insurance.
The practical objections to defer
ring the first payments for a few
years are apparent. After the class
has scattered abroad and has been out
of direct touch with the University
for a time the difficulties in the way
of centering their interest again
would be a big obstacle in the suc
cess of the plan.
The feasible thing seems to be to
make the first payments due next
year if the 1916 class adopts the in
surance plan. We think the possi
bilities of having $20,000 or $30,000 to
turn over to the University at the end
of a twenty-year period, call for the
most urgent need of starting a custom
which will bring in a much larger
amount, in the end, and of binding
the class together as a working unit
during the coming years, is so worth
while that the members of the class
can well afford to bind themselves to
meet the payments annually, even
during the period when five dollar
pieces are hard to acquire.
