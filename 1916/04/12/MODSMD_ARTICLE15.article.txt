# 1917 YEAR BOOK IS "EVERYBODY'S QUAD"
## 
### 
Work on "Everybody's Quad," the
1917 Stanford year book, is rapidly
nearing completion. This year's Quad
will be superior to its predecessors
in several departments. It will con
tain more photo work than any pre
vious Quad, and will fully represent
every sport and student activity.
More money is being put into the book
than ever before. The lithograph pro
cess used is more expensive than
methods used in other years, but per
mits a great increase in the number
of illustrations.
The 1917 Quad is printed in three
colors, every page going through the
press four times. The first of these
four impressions is for the border,
which will be an attractive light card
inal shade. The border line is dis
tinctive, being a combination of line
work with a small "S" in each corner,
and the characters "1917 Quad" in the
inside top corner of every page.
Two impressions are necessary in
printing the pictures, first in black,
then in yellow ink, the result being a
pleasing brown tone. The type will be
in black.
"Cut-away" and vignette work will
feature the photographs and art in
the book. Individual students will be
widely represented by cuts in several
sections of the Quad. The first eight
pages will be in black design work
illuminated with gold. The dedica
tion page will be an expensive steel
engraved insert. There will also be
five inserted color views of the Quad
by W. J. Gores, '17.
