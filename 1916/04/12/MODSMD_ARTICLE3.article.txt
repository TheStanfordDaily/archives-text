This is the total of the Fineweather
Fund for John Stacy, twenty-four
hours after the announcement in The
Daily Palo Alto office that an effort
would be made to help the optimistic
friend of Everyman.
"Dad" Mercer started the ball roll
ins yesterday with a contribution of
$2. In The Daily Palo Alto office $1
was added. "Dad" Mercer collected
over $2 on the Quad this afternoon.
Volunteers brought almost this
amount to Wideman's campus store.
Other unsolicited contributions to the
fund for "Colonel Fineweather" came
from students and faculty members,
and raised the total to the $16 mark.
The little man's friends did not dare
to hope that one day's returns would
reach even $10. But it seems that
there are a host of campus people
who have not forgotten the time when
John Stacy's "Good morning! Fine
day!" greeted them on Lasuen, even
when it was raining cats and dogs
and little fishes.
