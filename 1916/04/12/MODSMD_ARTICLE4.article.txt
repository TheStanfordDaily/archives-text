# Chappie's Spring Catalogue of Fun Sells Tomorrow
## 
### 
Berkeley's bear in fast retreat after
the big track meet is the moving pic
ture shown on the cover of the Spring
Sports number of Chaparral, out on
the Quad and at Bookstore tomorrow.
The cover design is by Paul Rock
wood, '19.
From a wealth of material by staff
members and outsiders, Chappie has
chosen so as to give tomorrow's issue
more deadly laughing gas than has
been used for convulsive purposes in
these parts for some time.
Enter Joan and Jake.
Joan says Jake is too weak to be
in strong with her. lint by going
through the most terrible ordeal on
the campus, Jake proves his strength.
More of this in the dilettante by Rob
ert Donaldson, '17. "Feg" Murray,
'16, tops the hurdles of artistic speed
in a very Spring-sporty Snoppyquop,
which deserves its full-page allot
ment.
In the funny dope department .no
one will pass up "Another Sex Play!"
and "A Chapter from Mexican His
tory." These are both by Herbert
Marslmtz, '17. Nor will any reader let
siip by "The Athlete and the Aesthete"
and "Obituary Conclaves of the Clever
Converse Series," by Lansing War
ren,'l7.
Speaking Editorially.
In his Now That's "Hip" Levy, '16,
editorializes on "athletic teams" and
about "smoking on the Quad." The
following non-staff members contrib
ute to the issue: Art—\V. E. Antrim,
