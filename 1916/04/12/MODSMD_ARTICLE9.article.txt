# Stanford and California Representatives Complete Big Meet Arrangements After Lengthy Discussion
## BLUE AND GOLD DEMANDS HEATS IN HUNDRED AND TWO-TWENTY Announce Entrants For Various Events in Cinder Path Classic Saturday 
### 
Following a lengthy conference at
the Olympic Club yesterday afternoon
which lasted from 1 o'clock until well
into the evening, Stanford and Cali
fornia coaches, captains, and graduate
managers agreed on the entries for
the Big Meet, and the rules which
will govern the affair.
12fillfn Dashes.
Heats will be run in the hundred
and two-twenty yard dashes, in spite
of the objection raised on the part of
Cardinals, who would have entered
but a few men in the sprints. How
ever, two heats will be run, and Cap
tain "Feg" Murray is rated as head
liner for the short dash. Murray is
also entered in both hurdles, the shot
put, and the high jump.
Itelays To Be Chosen.
Stanford delegates at the conference
favored running starts in the relay,
according to the A. A. U. and eastern
intercollegiate rules. However, Cali
fornia considered this disadvantageous
and the same old standing starts will
be used. The relay teams for the two
squads were not named in the entry
list, and will be chosen on the day of
the meet.
In case of a tie in any field event,
it must be settled between the two
highest men, by separate contest. An-
other new rule was made that no run
ner can take the pole unless he is
two full strides ahead of the man he
hind him.
Stanford Wilis Poles.
Stanford was fortunate in tossing
for positions, taking the pole in the
440, 120 hurdles, 220 dash finals, 220
low hurdles, 880 and the relay. The
brass shot will be used in the shot
put, Stanford securing this concession
from California.
Contests will begin at 2 o'clock with
the hammer throw. Regular events
will start at 2:30 sharp. A special
train will leave San Francisco for
Palo Alto at 1:30 p.m.
Stanford was represented at the
conference yesterday by Graduate
Manager E. C. Behrens, Captain F. S.
Murray and Trainer L. R. Reynolds.
California's representatives were
Graduate Manager John Stroud, Cap
tain Ted Preble, and Coach Walter
Christie. Referee Herbert Cheek also
attended the meeting.
Not Serious Disadvantage.
According to track men, arrange
ments will not work to serious dis
advantage of Stanford, though heats
in the hundred will make an extra
race for Captain Murray.
Trainer Reynolds reports that the
Cardinal runners are rounding into
better shape, and expects Wilson,
Grant, and Sisson to be sufficiently
recovered to put up good races. Wil
son is entered in three events, the
mile, two mile, and hair.

Following a lengthy conference at
the Olympic Club yesterday afternoon
which lasted from 1 o'clock until well
into the evening, Stanford and Cali
fornia coaches, captains, and graduate
managers agreed on the entries for
the Big Meet, and the rules which
will govern the affair.
12fillfn Dashes.
Heats will be run in the hundred
and two-twenty yard dashes, in spite
of the objection raised on the part of
Cardinals, who would have entered
but a few men in the sprints. How
ever, two heats will be run, and Cap
tain "Feg" Murray is rated as head
liner for the short dash. Murray is
also entered in both hurdles, the shot
put, and the high jump.
Itelays To Be Chosen.
Stanford delegates at the conference
favored running starts in the relay,
according to the A. A. U. and eastern
intercollegiate rules. However, Cali
fornia considered this disadvantageous
and the same old standing starts will
be used. The relay teams for the two
squads were not named in the entry
list, and will be chosen on the day of
the meet.
In case of a tie in any field event,
it must be settled between the two
highest men, by separate contest. An-
other new rule was made that no run
ner can take the pole unless he is
two full strides ahead of the man he
hind him.
Stanford Wilis Poles.
Stanford was fortunate in tossing
for positions, taking the pole in the
440, 120 hurdles, 220 dash finals, 220
low hurdles, 880 and the relay. The
brass shot will be used in the shot
put, Stanford securing this concession
from California.
Contests will begin at 2 o'clock with
the hammer throw. Regular events
will start at 2:30 sharp. A special
train will leave San Francisco for
Palo Alto at 1:30 p.m.
Stanford was represented at the
conference yesterday by Graduate
Manager E. C. Behrens, Captain F. S.
Murray and Trainer L. R. Reynolds.
California's representatives were
Graduate Manager John Stroud, Cap
tain Ted Preble, and Coach Walter
Christie. Referee Herbert Cheek also
attended the meeting.
Not Serious Disadvantage.
According to track men, arrange
ments will not work to serious dis
advantage of Stanford, though heats
in the hundred will make an extra
race for Captain Murray.
Trainer Reynolds reports that the
Cardinal runners are rounding into
better shape, and expects Wilson,
Grant, and Sisson to be sufficiently
recovered to put up good races. Wil
son is entered in three events, the
mile, two mile, and hair.
Entries made and selected by heats

tain Ted Preble, and Coach Walter

Not Serious Disadvantage.
According to track men, arrange
ments will not work to serious dis
advantage of Stanford, though heats
in the hundred will make an extra
race for Captain Murray.
Trainer Reynolds reports that the
Cardinal runners are rounding into
better shape, and expects Wilson,
Grant, and Sisson to be sufficiently
recovered to put up good races. Wil
son is entered in three events, the
mile, two mile, and hair.

Following a lengthy conference at
the Olympic Club yesterday afternoon
which lasted from 1 o'clock until well
into the evening, Stanford and Cali
fornia coaches, captains, and graduate
managers agreed on the entries for
the Big Meet, and the rules which
will govern the affair.
12fillfn Dashes.
Heats will be run in the hundred
and two-twenty yard dashes, in spite
of the objection raised on the part of
Cardinals, who would have entered
but a few men in the sprints. How
ever, two heats will be run, and Cap
tain "Feg" Murray is rated as head
liner for the short dash. Murray is
also entered in both hurdles, the shot
put, and the high jump.
Itelays To Be Chosen.
Stanford delegates at the conference
favored running starts in the relay,
according to the A. A. U. and eastern
intercollegiate rules. However, Cali
fornia considered this disadvantageous
and the same old standing starts will
be used. The relay teams for the two
squads were not named in the entry
list, and will be chosen on the day of
the meet.
In case of a tie in any field event,
it must be settled between the two
highest men, by separate contest. An-
other new rule was made that no run
ner can take the pole unless he is
two full strides ahead of the man he
hind him.
Stanford Wilis Poles.
Stanford was fortunate in tossing
for positions, taking the pole in the
440, 120 hurdles, 220 dash finals, 220
low hurdles, 880 and the relay. The
brass shot will be used in the shot
put, Stanford securing this concession
from California.
Contests will begin at 2 o'clock with
the hammer throw. Regular events
will start at 2:30 sharp. A special
train will leave San Francisco for
Palo Alto at 1:30 p.m.
