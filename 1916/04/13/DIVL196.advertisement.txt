Why have
Murads
become the leading ciga
rette in the business and
social world ?
Because smokers have
found that the Turkish to
baccos used in Murad are
better than they can get in
most 25 Cent cigarettes.
Murad has not won its
World Leadership
in a day or by accident.
It has been a question of
pure, honest value —
Of giving for 1 5 Cents far
more than any other manu
facturer ever thought it pos
sible to give —
Of offering the consumer a
1 5 Cent cigarette that can only
be compared with the BEST 25
Cent cigarettes.

co is the World's most famous tobacco
for cigarettes
