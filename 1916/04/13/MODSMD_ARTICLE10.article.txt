# April Sequoia to Appear Tomorrow
## "Ex-Gentleman" by J. A.Quimby and "Feg" Murray's Track Dope Feature 
### 
There is a prize-winning story to
head the table of contents in the
April Sequoia, which will bob up
serenely on the Quad tomorrow, it is
called "The Ex-Gentleman" and is
from the typewriter of J. A. Quinby,
'18, who in this story indulges the
reader's taste, and incidentally his
own, for Mexican bandits, with a good
dose of fair lady and engaging hero.
Hut the ending is not movie-ized, and
it is this which makes "The E*x-
Gentleman" different.
A close runner-up for honors in
the story section, is "Aillinn," by
Elinor Cogswell, '15. It is just a
matter of taste as to which one of
these stories has the biggest claim
on the prize-winning division. "Pre
paredness," by Fauna Farris, '16,
closes the roll of the fiction depart
ment.
"Track and Field" is the first lit
erary effort of "Feg" Murray to find
eleyites think the meet hinges on this
man's showing.
The two-twenty is doubtful, but the
big race will probably be between
Grant and Norton. In the hurdles
Murray and Norton are expected by
practically everyone to come in neck
and neck over the low sticks. The
high hurdles are not so sure. Ted
l'reble of California won his track
captaincy by defeating "Feg" Murray
last. year. He may prove his right
to his job by taking the high hurdles
again, hut. Murray and Norton will
both have to be reckoned with.
Wright Lynn is expected to capture
the 440, with Straub of California as
his strongest contender. DievendorlT,
Heal and Hertel also stand for atten
tion in this race. In the 880 little
Aupperle is the best bet. His strong
est contender from the opposition will
probably be Pete Vedder, erstwhile
long distance man of Berkeley, who
has shortened his race to the half
mile. Tf "Skin" Wilson enters this
race, the Stanford side of the score
board will probaly sport a healthy
number.
In (lie Long Hiiiis.
Wilson is counted on to take the
mile for the fourth consecutive time
from California. Coach Christie
counts on Davis, a new California run
ner, to give Wilson the greatest oppo
sition. Aupperle may prance in right
after Wilson, a la 1915, if he is not
saving himself for the 880. Tn the
two-mile. Chapman is probably Stan
ford's best bet, with both P. R. Wil
son and Art Wilson spurring him on.
Vedder, who won the event a year
ago, is not entered.
In the Field.
In field events the Cardinal is
weaker. The broad jump can be
credited to Pill Sisson, though Maker
is covering the distance in good style
this year. The high jump finds Maker
and Nichols of California the favor
ites, with Dykes and Laehmund of
Stanford their strongest opponents.
The pole vault is given to Berkeley
this year by dopesters, though Hutch
inson, Templeton, Phillips, Tufts, and
Macomber of Stanford are all trying
to reach the necessary mark. Reg
Caughey is expected to capture the
shot put against California's heavy
men, in spite of his somewhat weak
ened condition, and Here Pihlman
may come in for a third. The ham
mer throw belongs to California, Part
Gillespie, Stanford's best man, is hav
ing trouble with the circle, but one
good throw might turn the trick.
Up to the Relay?
The relay team may have to turn
the trick after all the rest of the meet
is over. Lynn, Dievendorff, Hertel.
and Peal, and possibly "Feg" Mur
ray, may have the whole meet to win
at the end.
Pest "dopesters" on the campus
figure some fifty-nine points to Stan
ford against fifty-eight for California,
leaving out the relay. This, however,
is merely dope. Dope was spilled
completely last year, ft will probably
be upset again. As Stanford men
say, "There's a fighting chance, and
that's all Stanford men ask."

after Wilson, a la 1915, if he is not
saving himself for the 880. Tn the
two-mile. Chapman is probably Stan
ford's best bet, with both P. R. Wil
son and Art Wilson spurring him on.
Vedder, who won the event a year
ago, is not entered.
In the Field.
In field events the Cardinal is
weaker. The broad jump can be
credited to Pill Sisson, though Maker
is covering the distance in good style
this year. The high jump finds Maker
and Nichols of California the favor
ites, with Dykes and Laehmund of
Stanford their strongest opponents.
The pole vault is given to Berkeley
this year by dopesters, though Hutch
inson, Templeton, Phillips, Tufts, and
Macomber of Stanford are all trying
to reach the necessary mark. Reg
Caughey is expected to capture the
shot put against California's heavy
men, in spite of his somewhat weak
ened condition, and Here Pihlman
may come in for a third. The ham
mer throw belongs to California, Part
Gillespie, Stanford's best man, is hav
ing trouble with the circle, but one
good throw might turn the trick.
Up to the Relay?
The relay team may have to turn
the trick after all the rest of the meet
is over. Lynn, Dievendorff, Hertel.
and Peal, and possibly "Feg" Mur
ray, may have the whole meet to win
at the end.
Pest "dopesters" on the campus
figure some fifty-nine points to Stan
ford against fifty-eight for California,
leaving out the relay. This, however,
is merely dope. Dope was spilled
completely last year, ft will probably
be upset again. As Stanford men
say, "There's a fighting chance, and
that's all Stanford men ask."
There is a prize-winning story to
head the table of contents in the
April Sequoia, which will bob up
serenely on the Quad tomorrow, it is
called "The Ex-Gentleman" and is
from the typewriter of J. A. Quinby,
'18, who in this story indulges the
reader's taste, and incidentally his
own, for Mexican bandits, with a good
dose of fair lady and engaging hero.
Hut the ending is not movie-ized, and
it is this which makes "The E*x-
Gentleman" different.
A close runner-up for honors in
the story section, is "Aillinn," by
Elinor Cogswell, '15. It is just a
matter of taste as to which one of
these stories has the biggest claim
on the prize-winning division. "Pre
paredness," by Fauna Farris, '16,
closes the roll of the fiction depart
ment.
"Track and Field" is the first lit
erary effort of "Feg" Murray to find
eleyites think the meet hinges on this
man's showing.
The two-twenty is doubtful, but the
big race will probably be between
Grant and Norton. In the hurdles
Murray and Norton are expected by
practically everyone to come in neck
and neck over the low sticks. The
high hurdles are not so sure. Ted
l'reble of California won his track
captaincy by defeating "Feg" Murray
last. year. He may prove his right
to his job by taking the high hurdles
again, hut. Murray and Norton will
both have to be reckoned with.
Wright Lynn is expected to capture
the 440, with Straub of California as
his strongest contender. DievendorlT,
Heal and Hertel also stand for atten
tion in this race. In the 880 little
Aupperle is the best bet. His strong
est contender from the opposition will
probably be Pete Vedder, erstwhile
long distance man of Berkeley, who
has shortened his race to the half
mile. Tf "Skin" Wilson enters this
race, the Stanford side of the score
board will probaly sport a healthy
number.
In (lie Long Hiiiis.
Wilson is counted on to take the
mile for the fourth consecutive time
from California. Coach Christie
counts on Davis, a new California run
ner, to give Wilson the greatest oppo
sition. Aupperle may prance in right
