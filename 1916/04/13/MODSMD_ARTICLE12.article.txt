# DOPESTERS SAY RELAY WILL DECIDE BIG TRACK MEET
## CHANCES ON FIFTY-FIFTY BASIS California Reputed to Have Dark Horse to Start in Sprint Events

meet. Practically everyone at Stan
ford believes that the meet is a fifty

and a pile of seconds and thirds.
Californians say that. The big ques

able to hold the places conceded to

tie has what he calls a "dark horse."
This is probably Nelson. Some Perk
