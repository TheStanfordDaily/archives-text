Silence and Jazz
Quiet 011 the campus after 10 o'clock
for the next two nights will be ap
preciated by the fifty or more men
who will enter the big events on Sat
urday. But there is no need of dupli
cating a New England Sunday during
the other hours of the day, this eve
ning and tomorrow. We hope the re
quest to be quiet, except in occas
ional cases, won't be adopted to this
extent. Songs around the dinner
table will help.
On Saturday night there is going
to be a big need on the campus for
some place to give vent to an awful
lot of enthusiasm. There will be a
rush for tickets for the Ram's Head
track show. Tn the meantime, the
pasteboards are selling right along
and all the best seats are going. Why
not buy early and make sure of being
in on the big noise at the track
show? It is well to bear in mind that
part of the proceeds will be used to
send the crew and track team east.
