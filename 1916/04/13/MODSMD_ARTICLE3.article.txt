# Value of Optimism Rises Fineweather Fund Doubles

### 
for Col. Fair weather.
It's going up fast. Ed. Mercer
brought over $7 to The Daily Palo
Alto office this afternoon. At Wide
man's campus store $1.50 was col
lected. And from faculty and stu
dent friends of John Stacy came
amounts varying from a dime to a
dollar, which almost doubled the
amount collected yesterday.
The volunteer fund will be con
tinued over the' week-end and will
then be placed where it can do the
most to help.
rt doesn't make a particle of dif
ference whether we call him Col.
Fineweather or Col. Fairweather. If
you can let your mind go back and
picture him on the Quad, you will
realize that either of those titles fits
the white-haired old man to perfec
tion.
