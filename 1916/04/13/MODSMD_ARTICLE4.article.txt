# Varsity Ready For Big Diamond Fight
## Stanford Has More Than Even Break, Says Coach Jack McCarthy 
### 
Yesterday's game against the Fort
Miley aggregation was the last appear
ance of the Stanford varsity baseball
team before the second contest of the
annual series with the University of
California. The fans were anxious
to see what kind of a showing they
would make, and many of the skeptics
were brought around by the oppor
tune victory, although it must be ad
mitted that none too good an exhi
bition of the national pastime was
served out.
Sanborn Replaces liililman.
"Doc" Hayes was missed on the
first sack, although "Joe" Braden
filled the position in an acceptable
manner. Bihlman was the only other
player who took the field against Cali
fornia that was not cavorting in a
suit yesterday. It is practically cer
tain that the husky left fielder will be
replaced by Sanborn in next Satur
day's game, as he will be used in the
track meet in the afternoon and no
risks can be taken with his already
swollen hand. Otherwise, the team
will face the Blue and Gold with the
same personnel as in the initial four
teen-inning struggle.
As the contest will be played on the
home diamond, the players figure that
the odds will be slightly in Stanford's
favor. The bounces were a great deal
different on the Berkeley turf and the
in fielders will have much more con
fidence playing on the local skinned
diamond. The pitchers are in great
form and long batting practices have
helped the men's bitting eyes. Coach
Jack McCarthy expressed himself as
well satisfied with the showing of the
team as a whole. He believes that
we have more than an even break for
the important game on Saturday, and
wishes to be quoted as saying that he
has never worked with a more willing
bunch of ball players, men who will
give all they have to carry off the
long end of the score. Captain Dent
is also very hopeful of victory.
Graduate Manager Behrens an
nounces that the game will be called
promptly at 10 o'clock. Season tick
ets will not admit spectators, the price
to pass his gate guardians being fifty
cents. There will be ample space for
a large crowd as more bleacher seats
have been erected. The seats are not
reserved and tickets are to be had at
the gate.
