# ARCHBISHOP E. J. HANNA MAKES APPEAL TO STANFORD MEN
## IDEAL IS ONE OF SERVICE Spirit of Sacrifice Alone Can Preserve Democracy of World 
### 
Archbishop Hanna made an appeal
to the men of the University this
morning in the Assembly Hall —an
appeal for the ideal of service to
others. "It was this ideal," he said,
"which has made our country great,
and on which our future greatness
must be built.
"The world is passing through a
crisis such as it has not seen in all
the Christian centuries," he con
tinued. "It is in the throes of death.
For the past hundred years men who
direct public thought have promised
progress, intellectual liberty, brother
hood, internationalism, and above all
a liberty such as the world has never
had before. These men were men of
intelligence, but those who thought
could not but wonder at these boasts.
They could not but doubt the bold
ness of these promises.
Dreams Unrealized.
"These doubts were well founded,
for the dreams have not been rea
lized. The world awoke in one night
to see the vision disappear. Instead
of progress, we have savagery; in
stead of brotherhood, racial hatred;
instead of liberty, martial law; and
instead of democracy, its destruction.
"Thinking men now seek something
which will save the world. The an
swer may be found in the ideal of
man's dignity, of law, order and self
conquest. This can only be realized
if men recognize their duty to serve.
It doesn't require genius to see that
things are not right, that most men
are seeking selfish ends—riches,
power, comfort and pleasure.
"Men must sacrifice, and the world
has the right to ask this sacrifice
from university men. They must
serve, and in order to do this must
also discipline themselves. They
must know the conditions of the
world., its problems and their solu
tion. If this ideal is realized, the
day of democracy is not gone, and
there is still hope for the future."
