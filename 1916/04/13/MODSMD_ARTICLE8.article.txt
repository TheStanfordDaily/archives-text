## 
### 
San Francisco chapter of the
American Red Cross is appealing for
a greatly increased membership be
tween now and Tuesday next, as a
special thank offering to the National
association. This is being done to
commemorate, on the tenth anniver
sary of the earthquake, the mag
nificent aid given the city in that
time of great need. Funds to the
extent of $10,000,000 were received in
that period.
Mrs. David Starr Jordan has writ
ten asking that Palo Alto and the
University add as many new mem
bers as possible to their present
short list. Mrs. H. 1?. Fisher, Uni
versity avenue and Seneca street, has
consented to act as chairman in this
district and asks all those that are
willing to aid to send their names
and remittances. Annual dues are
one dollar.
