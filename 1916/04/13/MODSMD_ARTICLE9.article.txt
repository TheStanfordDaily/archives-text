# Mary Antin Talks on True Democracy
## Russian Authoress Analyzes American Patriotism as Loyalty to Ideals 
### 
Mary Antin, wife of Professor Am
adeus Grabau of Columbia University,
accomplished a remarkable achieve
ment, last evening. In her own words
she "moved her audience before she
had talked to it." . She carried her
audience from the old chapel, where
there was not even standing room, to
the Memorial Church, where her half
thousand listeners could be seated.
Then, in words forceful because of
their simple, straight-forward truths,
Mary Antin, the Russian immigrant
author, held at attention those who
had come to hear her outline the
duties and true value of American
citizenship.
"America is different from other
nations," she said. "The Frenchman
is a native of France, the Englishman
of England, but the American de
pends upon something else besides
physical setting. It is only he who
sees in Americanism that inner mean
ing of a spiritual entity to which he
is converted, and who is a true Amer
ican, be he of the first or tenth gen
eration."
