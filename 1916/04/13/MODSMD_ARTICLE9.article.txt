# Mary Antin Talks on True Democracy
## Russian Authoress Analyzes American Patriotism as Loyalty to Ideals 
### 
Mary Antin, wife of Professor Am
adeus Grabau of Columbia University,
accomplished a remarkable achieve
ment, last evening. In her own words
she "moved her audience before she
had talked to it." . She carried her
audience from the old chapel, where
there was not even standing room, to
the Memorial Church, where her half
thousand listeners could be seated.
Then, in words forceful because of
their simple, straight-forward truths,
Mary Antin, the Russian immigrant
author, held at attention those who
had come to hear her outline the
duties and true value of American
citizenship.
"America is different from other
nations," she said. "The Frenchman
is a native of France, the Englishman
of England, but the American de
pends upon something else besides
physical setting. It is only he who
sees in Americanism that inner mean
ing of a spiritual entity to which he
is converted, and who is a true Amer
ican, be he of the first or tenth gen
eration."
Patriotism, to Mary Antin, does not
consist ot' brass bands in uniform.
Neither is it that principle of "hate
thy neighbor," but it is the loyalty to
certain ideals which have been long
served up in such cherished phrases
as liberty, equality and justice,â€”not
as abstractions but as real truths.
Deploring the situation whereby
"government of the people, by the
people, and for the people" is con
strued to mean government by the
other person," Mary Antin argued
that there must be something in the
lives of the people to teach the child
ren to interpret that phrase in terms
of action. Children should be well
grounded in those basic principles
that give the peculiar turn to Ameri
can life.
"Just as one cannot convert a
heathen unless one is converted him
self, so one cannot impress children
with the value of civic interest until
one is interested. Teach them that
cooperation is the way of doing
tilings with other people without
scrapping about them, and they will
understand what many older ones do
not," she said.
Mary Antin scored heavily prejudice
of all kinds, and emphasizing race
prejudice more especially, she made
her plea for a new patriotism straight
from the heart of one who believes
and lives to teach others to believe.
It was the plea of personal experi
ence to put aside old race hatred and
let every man pass on his own merits.
