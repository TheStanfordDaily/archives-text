# CARDINAL AND
## STANFORD BALL TEAM MEETS OPPONENTS AT TEN CLOSE CONTEST IS EXPECTED Berkeley Squad Worked Out on the Stanford Diamond Yesterday 
### 
Stanford faces California in base
ball tomorrow morning at 10 o'ciock,
on the varsity diamond for the second

time this sea
s on. The
is far and
away the most
important con
test of the
year for the
Cardinal ball
tossers, as a
vi cto r y will
put the two
rival teams on
even term s
again. Grad
uate Managers
Behrens and
Stroud expect
a large crowd
of bleacher-

ites. Extra accommodations have
been arranged for and with good
weather conditions, and two special
trains from the Berkeley institution,
the local stands should be iilled.
Fifty cents will be the admission
charge, the seats not being reserved.
Doyle and Phyle of the Coast League
will be the umpires.
California Practices at Stanford.
Coach Zam.'ock and Field Captain
"Husky" Young brought the California
team to the campus yesterday after
noon to try out the skinned diamond.
The players putin two full hours'
practice, and granting that the type
of diamond was new to them, they
did not. show up in any startling
style. With one bard earned win to
their credit, the Blue and Gold men
feel very confident, however. This
may be a natural feeling, but those
who have seen the two nines in ac
tion, and who saw the initial contest
at Berkeley Saturday, believe that the
Cardinal squad stands more than an
even show.
Cardinal Will Hit.
As Coach Jack McCarthy says,
"There is one thing certain; the boys

will hit more
than two bin
gles. W i th
the batting
practice the
team has had
this week, the
bat wielders
should give
either Dim
mock or Mc-
Cabe a merry
time." Cap
tain Dent is in
high spirits.
"Doc" Hayes
is back in
good condi
tion, his in-

jured arm now being in fair shape.
Hihlman will not lÂ»o in tlio outfield,
but Sanborn is hitting the ball on
the nose and will fill the position in
excellent stayle.
Lineup Well Balanced.
In the box Stanford is well forti
fied. Wickersham proved his worth in
the memorable fourteen-inning strug-


Captain Dent.


If ayes.
gle, while Hoever is a pitcher worthy
of any college ball team. Aside from
these two twirlers, Mattei and Howe
have shown splendid form. Dent is
a veteran of much experience and can
be depended upon to handle the job
"behind the log." Hayes is one of the
best men on the club, holding down
the first base sack in a way that gives
the fans great confidence. The rest
of the infield, Stafford, Stevens, and
Hensel, arc fast in fielding, possessors
of strong throwing arms, and fairly
good hitters. Sanborn, Lander, and
Noonan, in the outfield, will chase the
long ones. They form a good com
bination, although their hitting
strength is not as great as could be

expected.
With every Cardinal rooter pulling
for them, the team will take the dia
mond tomorrow morning. The play
ers are confident, but not over-con
fident. Every man is prepared to give
the best that is in him, and while
boots may be made, no one will in any
way slow up during the nine innings
or more of the contest. Coach Jack
McCarthy believes that we have more
than a fifty-fifty chance, Captain
Dent is hopeful of victory, and the
fans who support the Cardinal are
united in Ihe opinion that the long
end of the score will be in Stanford's
favor at the conclusion of the game.
Play ball.
