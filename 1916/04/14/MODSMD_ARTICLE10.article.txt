# Stanford Spirit Will Help Bring Victory, Says Baily
## 
### R.C. Baily of the Bulletin 
I think Stanford will win by a hair's
breadth. Stanford has a number of
remarkable athletes and think their
achievements will overcome the mar
gin California seems likely to get in
having more second and third place
men.
I count on the "Stanford Spirit" to
show itself after the disastrous week
end in athletics just passed, and that
it will be a big factor in gaining a
Stanford victory.
