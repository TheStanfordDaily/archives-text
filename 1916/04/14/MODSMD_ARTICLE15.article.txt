# DAILY CALIFORNIAN SPORT MAN SEES U.C. WIN

### Arthur S. Wilson

Having clearly demonstrated by a
series of unique deductions and com
parisons that an annual track and
field meet is impending between the
universities of Stanford and California
and that it is a very serious matter,
there is really not much more that j
can be put down as real facts without
transgressing the law of sincerity.
However, close followers of the
sport at California believe that the j
meet will run pretty close to what
the freshman in his vernacular calls
the "dope." Now, the "dope," which
is a highly intricate and profound
system, mathematical and metaphy
sical, and of estimated probabilities,
lias it that the classic will be close —
just as it has been for the past three
years—but that the Blue and Gold j
will win by a margin of from two to j
five points, eliminating the relay, j
And with six good quarter-milers j
from which to choose a fresh relay |
team, California supporters confident
ly expect to annex the feature event
as well.
Entry Lists Nearly Even.
Neither team will have any appre
ciable advantage in numbers as the
entry lists are about even. California
figures that it has more men BETTER
in each event than has Stanford; and
on that fundamental fact expects to
win the meet. The "dope" from the
California point of view, gives each
team five first places, three first
places being a toss-up, and the plur
ality of second and third places going
to the Bears along with the relay.
In the 100-yard dash Murray will
probably take first place, while the
220-yard dash will be a toss-up be-

tween tho rival entries. Jn the high
hurdles we look for Captain Preble
to repeat his victory of last year over
Murray, while in the low sticks Mur
ray is undoubtedly the class of the
meet. The 440 and 880 are anybody's
race, as we see them, while the mile
will go to Wilson, of Stanford, in the
two-mile, Lloyd of California figures
to cross the finish line first. The Blue
and Gold is "doped" to make a clean
sweep in the hammer throw with
Gildersleeve, Hadley, Monlux and
Richardson; and in the pole vault
with Gibbs, Nichols, Wright, Frisbie
and Graves. Nichols should take the
high jump, while Sisson, of Stanford,
will probably annex the broad.
Caughey of Stanford should win the
shot.
Hop* l Is Xot Always Might.
But the old dope doesn't always run
true. It is doubtful. There is always
a weakness somewhere. Figures lie.
Facts are nonsense. Stanford has a
number of stars, but if memory serves
us right the Cardinal had such men
as Coleman and Horine and Campbell
and Scott, hack in 1912, and was fav
ored to win tho meet—but lost.
Alas! We l>o Not Know.
So a recapitulation and close analy
sis of all the testimony offered by
both sides proves conclusively the fol
lowing facts:
(a) That we do not know who is
going to win.
(b) That we can hardly even justly
suspect anything.
We wish we knew, of course. We
wish we knew who is going to win
the track meet. But we repeat, again:
We do not know.
Alas! we do not know.
