GOOD MEN AM) TRUE.
At the depot, this afternoon, two
freshman commuters, with satchels in
their hands. They lean idly against
their bicycles.
Giovanni —Another week gone.
Nothing to do till —
Ezra —Tomorrow. .
Giovanni —Speaking metaphorically.
—There is really nothing to do till
Monday. I have my studying com
pleted a fortnight ahead.
Ezra —So 1 have also. Shall we go
somewhere?
Gio —Lovely! We might go to Con
gress Springs, or up in the hills.
Ezra—Or clown to the bay.
Gio (turns to.read bulletin) —Look!
a special train tomorrow.
Ezra—Must be a convention, or—
CI io—Look! Another track meet.
Do tell!
Ezra—Wasn't it last week,
Gio —Guess it must be run over —I
think somebody knocked over a
hurdle.
Ezra —That's not fair. Shall we go?
Gio—Yes; only I haven't a clean
collar!
Ezra —Neither have I! Let's rough
it!
Gio —You mean wear dirty collars?
Ezra —No. Let's really rough it and
wear soft shirts.
Gio —Can we? Lovely! Mother
won't like it, but I'll sneak out and
say I'm going to pick mushrooms.
And, say, Ez, if we go, let's bet on it.
Ezra—Just for fun?
Gio—No, really. Real money. I'll
bet your that puncture paste you
wanted that Stanford wins.
Ezra —Say, where'd you get that
stuff? I'll bet you my bike that we
win.
Gio—ls that a go?
Ezra—Sure it is. Shake on it.
Gio—Let's see, now—you're betting
that —on nix! I want to bet on Stan
ford, too!
Ezra—l'll bet you my bike against
your paste that Stanford wins.
Gio —Me bet against my own team!
Like fun!
Ezra—Then we won't bet. But let's
say we did.
Gio—All right. Let's buy collars
with the money.
Ezra —And we won't have to rough
it. Lovely!
Gio—And, say—who's the track
meet?
Ezra —Search me! Let's not go!
