## KNEISEL FOUR WINS AUDIENCE 
### 
The Kneisel Quartet, composed of
Franz Kneisel, playing first violin;
Hans Letz, second violin; Louis
Svecenski, viola, and William Willeke,
violincello, gave a well-balanced pro
gram of four numbers last night.
The interpretation of Smetana's
"Quartet in E Minor" was probably
the best piece of work done by the
four players, although the violincello
solos appealed to the audience even
more than a combination of the four
stringed instruments.
