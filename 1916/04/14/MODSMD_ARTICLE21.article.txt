# Colonel Fineweather's Life Ebbs as Benefit Fund Grows
## 
### 
The story of John Stacy is fast
drawing to a close. This afternoon
word was received that the black
shadow was creeping closer to the
heart of the little old man. It is
hoped that something will intervene
and prevent the darkening forever of
the sunshine that has lived in John
Stacy for 66 years. Even though the
shadow must come, there is a golden
memory that will live with Stanford
men and women.
There is $40 now on deposit in the
Business Office for those who are
going to help John Stacy's family
meet the inevitable crisis. Forty dol
lars is not enough. If the story of
Col. Fairweather could be printed
here, we would not have to ask more
than once. Tonight and tomorrow,
pass around a big hat, and just say
"For Colonel Fairweather." He has
many friends: they'll understand.
And then bring the contribution to
The Daily Palo Alto office, Monday, to
Wideman's, see Miss Eileen Everett,
or "Dad" Mercer, on the Quad.
