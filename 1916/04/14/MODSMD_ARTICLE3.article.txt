# Coach Prophesies Cardinal Victory
## Low Hurdle Record Likely to Be Broken Tomorrow in Oval Struggle 
### 
"There is a possible chance of 73
points for Stanford if everyone comes
through to form," is the way Coach
"Dad" Moulton dopes out the big clash
between the Cardinal and Blue and
Gold cinder path stars who will pro
vide an exhibition on the Stanford oval
tomorrow, which bids fair to out-do
even last year's memorable struggle.
"Dad" Is Optimistic.
Coach Moulton is extremely opti
mistic, of the outcome of the meet, as
his dope sheet would indicate. "Dad"
has predicted the outcome of eleven
Stanford-California meets, and on only
one of these occasions did he fail to
come within a few points of the final
which puts Stanford on the big end of
the score. In making up his list of fig
ures of a 73-49 score, "Dad" has taken
into consideration the showing of the
Cardinal squad so far this season.
Contrary to the generally accepted be
lief held on the outside that the Stan
ford team is weak on second and third
lilace men, "Dad" stated emphatically
that the squad is especially strong in
that respect this year, and in a num
ber of cases Cardinal stars will be
closely pressed by one or two team
mates.
May Hotter I.on Hurdle Time.
The meet will undoubtedly be fea
tured by many record or near-record
races. The Stanford-California low
hurdle record of :24 4-5, now held by
"Feg" Murray, seems certain of being
bettered, as both Captain Murray and
Norton have cleared the low sticks in
:24 1-f> this season, and will be
pressed to do their best by Captain
"Ted" Preble of California, who has
been getting into form, and should lie
at his best next Saturday.
Murray is counted on to win the
century, as he can do close to :10 flat
if pressed. Wadsworth, who, accord
ing to sporting authorities, is likely
to be California's dark horse in this
event, will press Grant and Davis,
both of whom have done :Ifl 2-5, for
the remaining places. Grant for
Stanford and Nelson of If. C. will
fight it out in the 220-yard dash, with
the dope favoring; the former.
Stanford looks to be espcially
strong in the distances and the quar
ter-mile dash. In the latter event
Lynn, with a record this season of
:50 2-5, seems to have the edge, while
both Dievendorff and Hertel have run
the quarter a second slower. Deal
has been slow in setting into shape,
l)iit once or twice this season lie has
shown a flash of his old form. Cali
fornia also has a pair of crack 440-
yard men in Straub and Woodruff, .ill
of which points to a fast and exciting
quarter.
Another star event in the opinion of
authorities will be the half-mile con
test, with Aupperle and Schnell of
Stanford and Vedder and Searby of
California as the principals. Aupperle
has been steadily improving, and it is
expected that he will better his sea
son's record of 1:59 2-5, if pressed by
Vedder, who, according to Coach
Walter Christie, has been running the
event under 1:58. Aupperle is also
figured by the dopesters to place sec
ond to "Skin" Wilson in the mile,
who, all authorities agree, should have
no trouble in winning his favorite
event. Davis, the Blue and Gold's
best, chance in this event in the opin
ion of certain of the sport critics, has
been running around 4:34, as against
Aupperle's time of 4:27 2-5.
Roth "Skin" Wilson and Chapman
should make Talbot, and Lloyd of
Berkeley step in the long race. Both
of the latter have run the two-mile
race close to 9:55, it is understood.
California is generally conceded the
majority of points in the field events.
Tufts seems to be pole vault favorite.
Sisson. who jumped 23 feet, 6 inches,
in the beginning of the season, is ex
pected to better this mark. The high
jump looks to be a toss-up between
Lachmund, Dykes, Dingley, and
Wheatly, representing Stanford, and
Nichols. Maker, and McFie of Cali
fornia. All jump around six feet con
sistently, although Nichols in prac
tice, leaps higher than the others, but
so far has failed to show at his best
in competition.
California is looked to take all the
points in hammer, although Enders
by may land a third. Caughey has not
been putting the shot as well up to
the present time, as he is capable of
doing, but is looked upon to win,
with Bihlman for second or third.
Practically all critics agree that the
relay will decide the meet. With
Lynn, Dievendorff, Hertel, Ileal, and
Murray to pick from the Cardinal
hopes are bright. These men will
average up at a little over :51, and it
will take an ultra-fast quartet from
across the bay to nose out any four
of them.

lief held on the outside that the Stan
ford team is weak on second and third
lilace men, "Dad" stated emphatically
that the squad is especially strong in
that respect this year, and in a num
ber of cases Cardinal stars will be
closely pressed by one or two team
mates.
May Hotter I.on Hurdle Time.
The meet will undoubtedly be fea
tured by many record or near-record
races. The Stanford-California low
hurdle record of :24 4-5, now held by
"Feg" Murray, seems certain of being
bettered, as both Captain Murray and
Norton have cleared the low sticks in
:24 1-f> this season, and will be
pressed to do their best by Captain
"Ted" Preble of California, who has
been getting into form, and should lie
at his best next Saturday.
Murray is counted on to win the
century, as he can do close to :10 flat
if pressed. Wadsworth, who, accord
ing to sporting authorities, is likely
to be California's dark horse in this
event, will press Grant and Davis,
both of whom have done :Ifl 2-5, for
the remaining places. Grant for
Stanford and Nelson of If. C. will
fight it out in the 220-yard dash, with
the dope favoring; the former.
Stanford looks to be espcially
strong in the distances and the quar
ter-mile dash. In the latter event
Lynn, with a record this season of
:50 2-5, seems to have the edge, while
both Dievendorff and Hertel have run
the quarter a second slower. Deal
has been slow in setting into shape,
l)iit once or twice this season lie has
shown a flash of his old form. Cali
fornia also has a pair of crack 440-
yard men in Straub and Woodruff, .ill
of which points to a fast and exciting
quarter.
Another star event in the opinion of
authorities will be the half-mile con
test, with Aupperle and Schnell of
Stanford and Vedder and Searby of
California as the principals. Aupperle
has been steadily improving, and it is
expected that he will better his sea
son's record of 1:59 2-5, if pressed by
Vedder, who, according to Coach
Walter Christie, has been running the
event under 1:58. Aupperle is also
figured by the dopesters to place sec
ond to "Skin" Wilson in the mile,
who, all authorities agree, should have
no trouble in winning his favorite
event. Davis, the Blue and Gold's
best, chance in this event in the opin
ion of certain of the sport critics, has
been running around 4:34, as against
Aupperle's time of 4:27 2-5.
Roth "Skin" Wilson and Chapman
should make Talbot, and Lloyd of
Berkeley step in the long race. Both
of the latter have run the two-mile
race close to 9:55, it is understood.
California is generally conceded the
majority of points in the field events.
Tufts seems to be pole vault favorite.
Sisson. who jumped 23 feet, 6 inches,
in the beginning of the season, is ex
pected to better this mark. The high
jump looks to be a toss-up between
Lachmund, Dykes, Dingley, and
Wheatly, representing Stanford, and
Nichols. Maker, and McFie of Cali
fornia. All jump around six feet con
sistently, although Nichols in prac
tice, leaps higher than the others, but
so far has failed to show at his best
in competition.
California is looked to take all the
points in hammer, although Enders
by may land a third. Caughey has not
been putting the shot as well up to
the present time, as he is capable of
doing, but is looked upon to win,
with Bihlman for second or third.
Practically all critics agree that the
relay will decide the meet. With
Lynn, Dievendorff, Hertel, Ileal, and
Murray to pick from the Cardinal
hopes are bright. These men will
average up at a little over :51, and it
will take an ultra-fast quartet from
across the bay to nose out any four
of them.
"There is a possible chance of 73
points for Stanford if everyone comes
through to form," is the way Coach
"Dad" Moulton dopes out the big clash
between the Cardinal and Blue and
Gold cinder path stars who will pro
vide an exhibition on the Stanford oval
tomorrow, which bids fair to out-do
even last year's memorable struggle.
"Dad" Is Optimistic.
Coach Moulton is extremely opti
mistic, of the outcome of the meet, as
his dope sheet would indicate. "Dad"
has predicted the outcome of eleven
Stanford-California meets, and on only
one of these occasions did he fail to
come within a few points of the final
which puts Stanford on the big end of
the score. In making up his list of fig
ures of a 73-49 score, "Dad" has taken
into consideration the showing of the
Cardinal squad so far this season.

ing to sporting authorities, is likely
to be California's dark horse in this
event, will press Grant and Davis,
both of whom have done :Ifl 2-5, for
the remaining places. Grant for
Stanford and Nelson of If. C. will
fight it out in the 220-yard dash, with
the dope favoring; the former.
Stanford looks to be espcially
strong in the distances and the quar
ter-mile dash. In the latter event
Lynn, with a record this season of
:50 2-5, seems to have the edge, while
both Dievendorff and Hertel have run
the quarter a second slower. Deal
has been slow in setting into shape,
l)iit once or twice this season lie has
shown a flash of his old form. Cali
fornia also has a pair of crack 440-
yard men in Straub and Woodruff, .ill
of which points to a fast and exciting
quarter.
Another star event in the opinion of
authorities will be the half-mile con
test, with Aupperle and Schnell of
Stanford and Vedder and Searby of
California as the principals. Aupperle
has been steadily improving, and it is
expected that he will better his sea
son's record of 1:59 2-5, if pressed by
Vedder, who, according to Coach
Walter Christie, has been running the
event under 1:58. Aupperle is also
figured by the dopesters to place sec
ond to "Skin" Wilson in the mile,
who, all authorities agree, should have
no trouble in winning his favorite
event. Davis, the Blue and Gold's
best, chance in this event in the opin
ion of certain of the sport critics, has
been running around 4:34, as against
Aupperle's time of 4:27 2-5.
Roth "Skin" Wilson and Chapman
should make Talbot, and Lloyd of
Berkeley step in the long race. Both
of the latter have run the two-mile
race close to 9:55, it is understood.
California is generally conceded the
majority of points in the field events.
Tufts seems to be pole vault favorite.
Sisson. who jumped 23 feet, 6 inches,
in the beginning of the season, is ex
pected to better this mark. The high
jump looks to be a toss-up between
Lachmund, Dykes, Dingley, and
Wheatly, representing Stanford, and
Nichols. Maker, and McFie of Cali
fornia. All jump around six feet con
sistently, although Nichols in prac
tice, leaps higher than the others, but
so far has failed to show at his best
in competition.
California is looked to take all the
points in hammer, although Enders
by may land a third. Caughey has not
been putting the shot as well up to
the present time, as he is capable of
doing, but is looked upon to win,
with Bihlman for second or third.
Practically all critics agree that the
relay will decide the meet. With
Lynn, Dievendorff, Hertel, Ileal, and
Murray to pick from the Cardinal
hopes are bright. These men will
average up at a little over :51, and it
will take an ultra-fast quartet from
across the bay to nose out any four
of them.
"There is a possible chance of 73
points for Stanford if everyone comes
through to form," is the way Coach
"Dad" Moulton dopes out the big clash
between the Cardinal and Blue and
Gold cinder path stars who will pro
vide an exhibition on the Stanford oval
tomorrow, which bids fair to out-do
even last year's memorable struggle.
"Dad" Is Optimistic.
Coach Moulton is extremely opti
mistic, of the outcome of the meet, as
his dope sheet would indicate. "Dad"
has predicted the outcome of eleven
Stanford-California meets, and on only
one of these occasions did he fail to
come within a few points of the final
which puts Stanford on the big end of
the score. In making up his list of fig
ures of a 73-49 score, "Dad" has taken
into consideration the showing of the
Cardinal squad so far this season.
Contrary to the generally accepted be
lief held on the outside that the Stan
ford team is weak on second and third
lilace men, "Dad" stated emphatically
that the squad is especially strong in
that respect this year, and in a num
ber of cases Cardinal stars will be
closely pressed by one or two team
mates.
May Hotter I.on Hurdle Time.
The meet will undoubtedly be fea
tured by many record or near-record
races. The Stanford-California low
hurdle record of :24 4-5, now held by
"Feg" Murray, seems certain of being
bettered, as both Captain Murray and
Norton have cleared the low sticks in
:24 1-f> this season, and will be
pressed to do their best by Captain
"Ted" Preble of California, who has
been getting into form, and should lie
at his best next Saturday.
Murray is counted on to win the
century, as he can do close to :10 flat
if pressed. Wadsworth, who, accord
ing to sporting authorities, is likely
to be California's dark horse in this
event, will press Grant and Davis,
both of whom have done :Ifl 2-5, for
