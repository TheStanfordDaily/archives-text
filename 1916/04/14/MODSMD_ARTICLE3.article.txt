# Coach Prophesies Cardinal Victory
## Low Hurdle Record Likely to Be Broken Tomorrow in Oval Struggle 
### 
"There is a possible chance of 73
points for Stanford if everyone comes
through to form," is the way Coach
"Dad" Moulton dopes out the big clash
between the Cardinal and Blue and
Gold cinder path stars who will pro
vide an exhibition on the Stanford oval
tomorrow, which bids fair to out-do
even last year's memorable struggle.
"Dad" Is Optimistic.
Coach Moulton is extremely opti
mistic, of the outcome of the meet, as
his dope sheet would indicate. "Dad"
has predicted the outcome of eleven
Stanford-California meets, and on only
one of these occasions did he fail to
come within a few points of the final
which puts Stanford on the big end of
the score. In making up his list of fig
ures of a 73-49 score, "Dad" has taken
into consideration the showing of the
Cardinal squad so far this season.
Contrary to the generally accepted be
lief held on the outside that the Stan
ford team is weak on second and third
lilace men, "Dad" stated emphatically
that the squad is especially strong in
that respect this year, and in a num
ber of cases Cardinal stars will be
closely pressed by one or two team
mates.
May Hotter I.on Hurdle Time.
The meet will undoubtedly be fea
tured by many record or near-record
races. The Stanford-California low
hurdle record of :24 4-5, now held by
"Feg" Murray, seems certain of being
bettered, as both Captain Murray and
Norton have cleared the low sticks in
:24 1-f> this season, and will be
pressed to do their best by Captain
"Ted" Preble of California, who has
been getting into form, and should lie
at his best next Saturday.
Murray is counted on to win the
century, as he can do close to :10 flat
if pressed. Wadsworth, who, accord
ing to sporting authorities, is likely
to be California's dark horse in this
event, will press Grant and Davis,
both of whom have done :Ifl 2-5, for
the remaining places. Grant for
Stanford and Nelson of If. C. will
fight it out in the 220-yard dash, with
the dope favoring; the former.
