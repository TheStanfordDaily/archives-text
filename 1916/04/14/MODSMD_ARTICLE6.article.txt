# TRACK SHOW WILL CLOSE SEASON
## RAM'S HEAD HELPS EASTERN FUND 
### 
With Charlie Chaplin materializing,
summarizing, mesmerizing, appetizing,
citlcising things 011 the Stanford cam
pus, for the purpose of expressing,
digressing, addressing, and not sup
pressing his views of Stanford tomor
row ni-vht at the Ram's Head Track
Show, the affair assumes the nature
of a real post-Rig Meet treat, at
which Cardinal fans and athletes can
let off steam and break training in
proper fashion.
Ram's Head has spread itself,
figuratively speaking—for a Ram's
Head is a very solid affair, as a mat
ter of fart. So is this show—solid
yet light, paradoxical as it may seem.
The managers say this is true—and
the managers ought to know.
Ilerr Charles Reilly, accompanied
by Mlfs Grace Allen, will he another
addition to Rams' Head's galaxy of

entertainers. He will sing Irish songs.
"Rlondy" Paul, Alice Rutcher and
Nancy Lee Willard will give "The Line
of No Resitance," a clever skit, while
the big musical hits of the evening
will he by "Tommy" Reynolds, "Dug"
McLachlan, and "Rlondy" Paul, who
will have three pianos on the stage
for their concert.
Leading Junior Opera features will
he part of the program, while "Pinky"
Rynum will make his bow to the Stan
ford public with "Madame Yelha."
Some seats remain for the Ram's
Head Track Show, which will be sold
tomorrow evening at the box oUce.
All proceeds of the affair will go to
the track fund for the eastern invas
ion.
Roth the track and baseball teams
will be guests of the management at
the vaudeville.
