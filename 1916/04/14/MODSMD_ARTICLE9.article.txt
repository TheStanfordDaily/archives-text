A majority of the best dopesters,
men who stake their reputation 011
their "dope," and are not influenced
by personal prejudice, give tomor
row's track meet to Stanford by a
narrow margin. One of them says:
"I count on the Stanford Spirit to
show itself alter the disastrous week
end in athletics just passed, and that
it will be a big factor in gaining a
Stanford victory." He's expressed
the attitude of the Stanford campus.
We've already expressed our belief
that Stanford's ball club will play the
same brand of ball tomorrow that
they played last Saturday. If they
do Stanford's chances of winning are
big. We believe we speak for the
campus in pledging every ounce of
support in us for the two varsities as
they enter tomorrow's contests. We
don't ask a pledge in return—the men
representing Stanford will do their
best.
The fencers, both men and women,
who will meet California, the Carnot
debaters, and the chess team, we wish
success. Bring home a win for Stan
ford !
