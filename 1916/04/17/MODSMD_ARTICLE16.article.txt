# Y.M.C.A. Worker Tells of European War Camps
## 
### 
Giving a remarkable lot of "inside"
information in regard to the condi
tions in European war prison camps,
James i". Sprunger, state secretary of
the Y. M. C. A., who has recently re
turned from nine months' service in
Europe, gave an illustrated lecture to
the men of the University in Encina
club room last night. Among Mr.
Sprunger's statements are the follow
ing:
"The war will be over by the end
of 191G. Sentiment in the warring
nations is becoming stronger for
peace.
"Stories printed in American news
papers about bad prison conditions
are absolute lies. The men in tli.j
prison camps are well cared for in
all countries.
"German atrocities in Belgium are
greatly exaggerated. Russian armies
have been far more barbarous on the
eastern front in East Prussia and
Poland.
"After this war mere will be a great
opportunity for American college men
to help rebuild Europe.
"The doors of Europe are open to
the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion. The workers are welcomed in
every country, and there are 12,000
Y. M. C. A. buildings in the prison
camps in France."
