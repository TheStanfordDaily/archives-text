# Track Show Called Best in Six Years
## Local and Professional Talent Combine in Eight Clever Acts 
### H.S. Marshutz, '17 
A grad, who brought his wife with
him, remarked enthusiastically that ir
was the best track show 'n half a
dozen years. And it >vas. Gathering
together material for vaudeville is
more or less of a gamble. Ram's
Head was favored by tb > god of
Chance, and drew high cards from
both local and professional tr.lent.
Eastward IIo!
Saturday evening's highiy satisfy
ing dessert to the day's courses of
athletic victories was to help send
the Cardinal track team east. And
it did, to the extent of about two hun
dred dollars.
Stars (nine llncli,
"Pinky" Mynum. 'IS, who can sing
in "Scotch" dialect, was expected to
stage the kick-off at S: 1nut with
a strained larynx and pharynx in his
throat, simply wouldn't. So he didn't
perform. Ditto cannot be said re
garding Edith Harvey, '17, Angle
Cross, '18, R. (!. Wheal ton, '10, and
Dave Smith. '19, and their choruses,
who "came back" in romantic hits
from "In Dutch."
Ralph Mien, professional whistler,
whistled professionally into every-
body's heart and up and down every
body's spine. His performance proved
that even whistling is a technique.
The tendency of the evening's en
tertainment to lean far toward ro
mance was evidenced again in the
clever and surprising one-acter, "The
Line of Xo Resistance." This skit
brought out a captivating stage per
sonality in Miss Nancy Lee Willard,
'17, as the wife. W. G. Paul, '15, hit
his old stride in the half-comic, half
pathetic role of the husband. Alice
llntcher, '16, as the girl, showed her
ability to handle a ticklish part clev
erly.
Lots of Piano.
"Dug" McLachlan, '17, Tom Rey
nolds, '18, and "Rlondy" Paul, in their
three-in-one piano act, would be play
ing yet if the demands of the audi
ence were complied with. The pian
ola in the Union was backed off the
map.
Grace Allen and Charles Reilly,
professionals, presented happy rrish
songs and dances that bad much
freshness of youth and romance.

whistled professionally into every-
body's heart and up and down every
body's spine. His performance proved
that even whistling is a technique.
The tendency of the evening's en
tertainment to lean far toward ro
mance was evidenced again in the
clever and surprising one-acter, "The
Line of Xo Resistance." This skit
brought out a captivating stage per
sonality in Miss Nancy Lee Willard,
'17, as the wife. W. G. Paul, '15, hit
his old stride in the half-comic, half
pathetic role of the husband. Alice
llntcher, '16, as the girl, showed her
ability to handle a ticklish part clev
erly.
Lots of Piano.
"Dug" McLachlan, '17, Tom Rey
nolds, '18, and "Rlondy" Paul, in their
three-in-one piano act, would be play
ing yet if the demands of the audi
ence were complied with. The pian
ola in the Union was backed off the
map.
Grace Allen and Charles Reilly,
professionals, presented happy rrish
songs and dances that bad much
freshness of youth and romance.
