# Cardinal Waves as Track Team Sweeps Bears From Boards in Sensational Meet
## Exceeding Fondest Expectations and Upsetting Dope of Most Optimistic Students, Cinder Path Men Defeat Blue and Gold, by a 69 to 53 Score, Smashing Three Records 
### 
The Cardinal is waving. Stanford
skill, muscles, and ingenuity earned
for it the right to wave with two
healthy victories, Saturday. A ninth
inning rally, with two down and two
strikes, such as Bihlman started Sat
urday morning, is a fabulous thing,
reserved for ttory books and imagina
tion, but for sue', a stunt to lie fol
lowed by a Meet victory, which
exceeded the fondest expectations of
all but one man —it would be too good

to lie true, if it had not actually hap
pened, (i!) to r>3.
"Dad" Always Optimistic.
The one man who "'doped" things
and stuck to it, was Veteran Coach
"Dad" Moulton. "Dad" doped the
proposition 73 to 19. The most opti
mistic fans and track men could not
fathom better than a 63 to f>9 victory.
A little arithmetic will show who
knew.
Cardinal Supreme on Track.
Stanford athletes took ten lirsl
places and the relay. Every track
event ended with a Cardinal in the
lead. Two Held firsts arc credited to

. Stanford men. Not only firsts, but
seconds and thirds fell to the lot of
! the home athletes, contrary to ex
! pectations.
.
Murray Largest Winner.
Captain "Feg" Murray canic into
his own, Saturday. He was hero of
| the day, winning three first places,
the high hurdles, hundred yard dash,
and the two-twenty dash. Murray
did not enter his favorite event, the
low hurdles, saving himself to make

up for the weak spots in the Card
inal squad. "Skin" Wilson stowed
away his fourth consecutive Rig Meet
mile first place. Both Wilson and
Murray are now four star men.
Records (jo.
Records went hy the boards in a
number of instances. Captain Mur
ray broke the two-twenty yard dash
record of 22 Hat, held by Coleman and
Campbell. His time was 21 and
seconds. Johnny Norton lowered
"I'Yg" Murray's low hurdle record
of :24 4-5. to :24 l-. r ». upsetting dope
entirely. In the high jump, Maker oi'
California broke the record of Ceovg'.

I llorine by jumping G foot, 1 15-4 inches.
Surprises Many.
Surprises were the order of the
day. Wright Lynn tied the 440-yard
j record of :. r >o flat, made by Wynian in
| 1910. Diovendorlf won his way to the
| hearts of the fans with a plucky sprint
j which brought him second place in
j this race, barely behind Lynn. Sclincll
I romped in first in !he half-mile, con
trary to expectations, defeating Aup
perle, who bad been forced to the limit

in the mile. Halsted's taking second
place in the low hurdles was another
surprise.
Mile Wiiii.
Though heats had been run in the
century dash, the mile run was the
first final track event of the afternoon.
The race went true to dope, Stanford
taking first and second with Wilson
and Aupperle, those two men finish
ing in the same order as last year,
Wilson winning his fourth consecu
tive race in the time of <1:24. Davis
of California came in with tlu 1 final
point. Eleven men started in tin l
four-lap event.

men placed iu the 100-yard dash
heats. In the lirst trial Murray and
Davis of Stanford took first and third
with Wadsworth of California second.
In the second heat Grant and .Need
ham of Stanford were lirst and third,
with Bowen of California second.
Time for the lirst heat was :1U-1 and
for the second :10-2. Murray led all
the way in the deciding sprint, win
ning in : 10-1, yards ahead of Wads
worth and Bowen, the Blue and Cold
runners, who took second and third.
High II urdIt's.
immediately after winning the 100-
yard dash, Captain Murray toed the
mark for his hardest race of the day,
the 120-yard high hurdle duel with
Captain "led" Treble of California.
Murray was after Treble's scalp, the
latter having taken the race last year,
and the Stanford leader's hopes were
not in vain, for he crossed the line a
full yard ahead of his rival, winning
the event in :15-2. The two captains
ran neck and neck over all but the
last hurdle, which was cleared by
Preble an instant ahead of Murray;
but the latter made up in the final
dash to the tape. Johnny Norton
was so close to Preble that the judges
had a hard time deciding whether the
Blue and Cold captain had come in
second or third.
The final award gave Norton third
place, giving Stanford six points in
the high stick race.
110-Yard Dash.
Taking the lead at the start, never
to be headed, Lynn of Stanford took
the quarter in 50 seconds flat,, equal
ling the Stanford-California record in
this event. The surprise of the race
was the wonderful showing of Dieven
dorff, who came in close behind Lynn
with a second place for the Cardinal.
.Gibbon of California was in second
place until the last twenty yards,
when Dievendorfl let out a spurt that
carried him ahead of the Blue aud
Gold man and almost overtook Lynn
at the tape.
Two Mile Piiin.
Again in the two mile grind, the
"dope" was upset. Chapman, whose
performances to date have been too
erratic to induce confidence, came
through with a great burst of speed
in the last lap, which carried him
far ahead of Lloyd, his principal Blue
and Gold competitor, and gave him the
race in 9:57. Talbot of California
led the field until the seventh lap,
when he dropped out. He had been
pressed to the limit by Art Wilson of
Stanford, who dropped back of both
Chapman and Lloyd in the last lap.
In the final sprint, Loucks of Stan
ford passed the plucky Wilson, and
came in for third place.
220-Vsird Dash.
The stands were surprised when
"Feg" Murray lined up for the first
heat in the 220-yard dash, for the
Stanford captain had not entered in
this event. In the trial he ran sec
ond to Wadsworth of California, with
Grant of Stanford in third place. In
the second heat, Bowen and Nelson
of California and Davis of Stanford
qualified. The time for the heats had
been :22 1 and :23 3 respectively. In
the deciding dash Captain Murray
came through with a win in : 21-3,
clipping 2-5 of a second off the for
mer dual meet record. Wadsworth
and Nelson took second and third in
this event.
880-Yard Hun.
Continuing the regular work of
former-Captain Bonnett, Schnell of
Stanford romped to the tape for first
place in the half-mile run, in the time
of 1:58. Vedder of California was the
Mruins' best bet, but the best that he
could do was to come in for second
place, yards behind Schnell. Scott of
California was close behind, taking
third place easily.
2'20-Yjml Hurdles.
Clipping 3-5 of a second off the
Stanford-California record in the low
hurdles, Johnny Norton crossed the
line in :24-1, equalling Murray's Pa
cific Coast record. Though Murray
had been taken out of his own race,
Stanford garnered eight points in the
hurdle race, llalsted easily getting
second place from Wolongiewicz,
who took a lone point for the Bears.
For the last year Norton has been
pressing Murray to the limit, and bis
performance on Saturday indicates
that had the men been running in
their regular order a new hurdle
mark would have been set.
Reliiy.
The final event of the afternoon was
another Cardinal victory. With Stan
ford using three of last year's relay
team, and the Bears with two of the
former runners, the rivals toed the
nuirk. Dievendorff led Woodruff all
the way in the first lap. Hertel came
in slightly in the lead of Ryan, the
second Bear runner. Beal and Gib
bon reached the finish at the same in
stant. Lynn and Straub, off to an

even start, ran neck and neck for the
turn. After the first sprint, Lynn led
all the way, coming in two yards
ahead of Straub for a win in 3:20.
Hummer Throw.
Duplicating last year's perform
ance and living up to the expecta
tions of the "dopesters," the Blue and
Gold heavers took nine points 111 the
hammer throw, which was the initial
event 011 the program, with but little
opposition. Giidersleeve won easily
from his team mates with a splendid
throw of lii4 feet, 3 inches. Richard
son and Monlux were respectively
second and third.
Sliot-l'ut.
it. R. Caughey demonstrated that,
despite reports of his condition, he
could still heave the shot farther than
Liversedge, the California husky, who
was expected to spring a possible sur
prise in the event, in his last toss,
Caughey threw the brass pill for a
distance of 45 feet, ti 3-1 inches, which
bettered Liversedge's best heave of
44 feet, 10 inches, by a good margin.
Bihlman was third, giving Stanford
six points in this event.
High ,ln 111 p.
One of California's three lirst places
was recorded in the high jump by
Maker, whose remarkable perform
ance was a feature of the meet. By
reaching a height of (! feet, 4 3-4
inches, the Blue and Gold jumper not
only won the event over his team
mate, Nichols, but also bettered the
Stanford-California record of (J feet,
3 7-8 inches, held by George Horine.
Maker tried for (J feet, 0 inches, after
the meet, but was not successful.
Lachmund excelled all his previous
efforts with a leap of 1! feet, 2 inches,
placing third to Nichols, and netting
Stanford one point in this event.
Itroad Jump.
Bill Sisson again starred in his fav
orite event, and any advantage which
the California supporters may have
seen in his heavily bandaged leg was
dispelled at the outset, when he
jumped 23 feet, ti 1-4 inches, an inch
and a quarter under the Stanford-
California record. Maker of Cali
fornia was second with a leap of 22
feet, 10 inches, and Lockhardt of Cali
fornia was third with 22 feet, 5 inches.
I'ole Vault.
The pole vault went according to
"dope," California taking all nine
points, with Nichols, Wright and
Frisbie tied at 12 feet. Tufts, who
was looked to as a possible point win
ner, went out at It feet, (5 inches,
Phillips, Templeton and Hutchinson
went out at 12 feet.

Surprises were the order of the
day. Wright Lynn tied the 440-yard
j record of :. r >o flat, made by Wynian in
| 1910. Diovendorlf won his way to the
| hearts of the fans with a plucky sprint
j which brought him second place in
j this race, barely behind Lynn. Sclincll
I romped in first in !he half-mile, con
trary to expectations, defeating Aup
perle, who bad been forced to the limit

in the mile. Halsted's taking second
place in the low hurdles was another
surprise.
Mile Wiiii.
Though heats had been run in the
century dash, the mile run was the
first final track event of the afternoon.
The race went true to dope, Stanford
taking first and second with Wilson
and Aupperle, those two men finish
ing in the same order as last year,
Wilson winning his fourth consecu
tive race in the time of <1:24. Davis
of California came in with tlu 1 final
point. Eleven men started in tin l
four-lap event.

men placed iu the 100-yard dash
heats. In the lirst trial Murray and
Davis of Stanford took first and third
with Wadsworth of California second.
In the second heat Grant and .Need
ham of Stanford were lirst and third,
with Bowen of California second.
Time for the lirst heat was :1U-1 and
for the second :10-2. Murray led all
the way in the deciding sprint, win
ning in : 10-1, yards ahead of Wads
worth and Bowen, the Blue and Cold
runners, who took second and third.
High II urdIt's.
immediately after winning the 100-
yard dash, Captain Murray toed the
mark for his hardest race of the day,
the 120-yard high hurdle duel with
Captain "led" Treble of California.
Murray was after Treble's scalp, the
latter having taken the race last year,
and the Stanford leader's hopes were
not in vain, for he crossed the line a
full yard ahead of his rival, winning
the event in :15-2. The two captains
ran neck and neck over all but the
last hurdle, which was cleared by
Preble an instant ahead of Murray;
but the latter made up in the final
dash to the tape. Johnny Norton
was so close to Preble that the judges
had a hard time deciding whether the
Blue and Cold captain had come in
second or third.
The final award gave Norton third
place, giving Stanford six points in
the high stick race.
110-Yard Dash.
Taking the lead at the start, never
to be headed, Lynn of Stanford took
the quarter in 50 seconds flat,, equal
ling the Stanford-California record in
this event. The surprise of the race
was the wonderful showing of Dieven
dorff, who came in close behind Lynn
with a second place for the Cardinal.
.Gibbon of California was in second
place until the last twenty yards,
when Dievendorfl let out a spurt that
carried him ahead of the Blue aud
Gold man and almost overtook Lynn
at the tape.
Two Mile Piiin.
Again in the two mile grind, the
"dope" was upset. Chapman, whose
performances to date have been too
erratic to induce confidence, came
through with a great burst of speed
in the last lap, which carried him
far ahead of Lloyd, his principal Blue
and Gold competitor, and gave him the
race in 9:57. Talbot of California
led the field until the seventh lap,
when he dropped out. He had been
pressed to the limit by Art Wilson of
Stanford, who dropped back of both
Chapman and Lloyd in the last lap.
In the final sprint, Loucks of Stan
ford passed the plucky Wilson, and
came in for third place.
220-Vsird Dash.
The stands were surprised when
"Feg" Murray lined up for the first
heat in the 220-yard dash, for the
Stanford captain had not entered in
this event. In the trial he ran sec
ond to Wadsworth of California, with
Grant of Stanford in third place. In
the second heat, Bowen and Nelson
of California and Davis of Stanford
qualified. The time for the heats had
been :22 1 and :23 3 respectively. In
the deciding dash Captain Murray
came through with a win in : 21-3,
clipping 2-5 of a second off the for
mer dual meet record. Wadsworth
and Nelson took second and third in
this event.
880-Yard Hun.
Continuing the regular work of
former-Captain Bonnett, Schnell of
Stanford romped to the tape for first
place in the half-mile run, in the time
of 1:58. Vedder of California was the
Mruins' best bet, but the best that he
could do was to come in for second
place, yards behind Schnell. Scott of
California was close behind, taking
third place easily.
2'20-Yjml Hurdles.
Clipping 3-5 of a second off the
Stanford-California record in the low
hurdles, Johnny Norton crossed the
line in :24-1, equalling Murray's Pa
cific Coast record. Though Murray
had been taken out of his own race,
Stanford garnered eight points in the
hurdle race, llalsted easily getting
second place from Wolongiewicz,
who took a lone point for the Bears.
For the last year Norton has been
pressing Murray to the limit, and bis
performance on Saturday indicates
that had the men been running in
their regular order a new hurdle
mark would have been set.
Reliiy.
The final event of the afternoon was
another Cardinal victory. With Stan
ford using three of last year's relay
team, and the Bears with two of the
former runners, the rivals toed the
nuirk. Dievendorff led Woodruff all
the way in the first lap. Hertel came
in slightly in the lead of Ryan, the
second Bear runner. Beal and Gib
bon reached the finish at the same in
stant. Lynn and Straub, off to an

even start, ran neck and neck for the
turn. After the first sprint, Lynn led
all the way, coming in two yards
ahead of Straub for a win in 3:20.
Hummer Throw.
Duplicating last year's perform
ance and living up to the expecta
tions of the "dopesters," the Blue and
Gold heavers took nine points 111 the
hammer throw, which was the initial
event 011 the program, with but little
opposition. Giidersleeve won easily
from his team mates with a splendid
throw of lii4 feet, 3 inches. Richard
son and Monlux were respectively
second and third.

it. R. Caughey demonstrated that,
despite reports of his condition, he
could still heave the shot farther than
Liversedge, the California husky, who
was expected to spring a possible sur

Caughey threw the brass pill for a
distance of 45 feet, ti 3-1 inches, which
bettered Liversedge's best heave of
44 feet, 10 inches, by a good margin.
Bihlman was third, giving Stanford
six points in this event.
High ,ln 111 p.
One of California's three lirst places
was recorded in the high jump by
Maker, whose remarkable perform
ance was a feature of the meet. By
reaching a height of (! feet, 4 3-4
inches, the Blue and Gold jumper not
only won the event over his team
mate, Nichols, but also bettered the
Stanford-California record of (J feet,
3 7-8 inches, held by George Horine.
Maker tried for (J feet, 0 inches, after
the meet, but was not successful.
Lachmund excelled all his previous
efforts with a leap of 1! feet, 2 inches,
placing third to Nichols, and netting
Stanford one point in this event.
Itroad Jump.
Bill Sisson again starred in his fav
orite event, and any advantage which
the California supporters may have
seen in his heavily bandaged leg was
dispelled at the outset, when he
jumped 23 feet, ti 1-4 inches, an inch
and a quarter under the Stanford-
California record. Maker of Cali
fornia was second with a leap of 22
feet, 10 inches, and Lockhardt of Cali
fornia was third with 22 feet, 5 inches.
I'ole Vault.
The pole vault went according to
"dope," California taking all nine
points, with Nichols, Wright and
Frisbie tied at 12 feet. Tufts, who
was looked to as a possible point win
ner, went out at It feet, (5 inches,
Phillips, Templeton and Hutchinson
went out at 12 feet.

last hurdle, which was cleared by
Preble an instant ahead of Murray;
but the latter made up in the final
dash to the tape. Johnny Norton
was so close to Preble that the judges
had a hard time deciding whether the
Blue and Cold captain had come in
second or third.
The final award gave Norton third
place, giving Stanford six points in
the high stick race.
110-Yard Dash.
Taking the lead at the start, never
to be headed, Lynn of Stanford took
the quarter in 50 seconds flat,, equal
ling the Stanford-California record in
this event. The surprise of the race
was the wonderful showing of Dieven
dorff, who came in close behind Lynn
with a second place for the Cardinal.
.Gibbon of California was in second
place until the last twenty yards,
when Dievendorfl let out a spurt that
carried him ahead of the Blue aud
Gold man and almost overtook Lynn
at the tape.
Two Mile Piiin.
Again in the two mile grind, the
"dope" was upset. Chapman, whose
performances to date have been too
erratic to induce confidence, came
through with a great burst of speed
in the last lap, which carried him
far ahead of Lloyd, his principal Blue
and Gold competitor, and gave him the
race in 9:57. Talbot of California
led the field until the seventh lap,
when he dropped out. He had been
pressed to the limit by Art Wilson of
Stanford, who dropped back of both
Chapman and Lloyd in the last lap.
In the final sprint, Loucks of Stan
ford passed the plucky Wilson, and
came in for third place.
220-Vsird Dash.
The stands were surprised when
"Feg" Murray lined up for the first
heat in the 220-yard dash, for the
Stanford captain had not entered in
this event. In the trial he ran sec
ond to Wadsworth of California, with
Grant of Stanford in third place. In
the second heat, Bowen and Nelson
of California and Davis of Stanford
qualified. The time for the heats had
been :22 1 and :23 3 respectively. In
the deciding dash Captain Murray
came through with a win in : 21-3,
clipping 2-5 of a second off the for
mer dual meet record. Wadsworth
and Nelson took second and third in
this event.
880-Yard Hun.
Continuing the regular work of
former-Captain Bonnett, Schnell of
Stanford romped to the tape for first
place in the half-mile run, in the time
of 1:58. Vedder of California was the
Mruins' best bet, but the best that he
could do was to come in for second
place, yards behind Schnell. Scott of
California was close behind, taking
third place easily.
2'20-Yjml Hurdles.
Clipping 3-5 of a second off the
Stanford-California record in the low
hurdles, Johnny Norton crossed the
line in :24-1, equalling Murray's Pa
cific Coast record. Though Murray
had been taken out of his own race,
Stanford garnered eight points in the
hurdle race, llalsted easily getting
second place from Wolongiewicz,
who took a lone point for the Bears.
For the last year Norton has been
pressing Murray to the limit, and bis
performance on Saturday indicates
that had the men been running in
their regular order a new hurdle
mark would have been set.
Reliiy.
The final event of the afternoon was
another Cardinal victory. With Stan
ford using three of last year's relay
team, and the Bears with two of the
former runners, the rivals toed the
nuirk. Dievendorff led Woodruff all
the way in the first lap. Hertel came
in slightly in the lead of Ryan, the
second Bear runner. Beal and Gib
bon reached the finish at the same in
stant. Lynn and Straub, off to an

even start, ran neck and neck for the
turn. After the first sprint, Lynn led
all the way, coming in two yards
ahead of Straub for a win in 3:20.
Hummer Throw.
Duplicating last year's perform
ance and living up to the expecta
tions of the "dopesters," the Blue and
Gold heavers took nine points 111 the
hammer throw, which was the initial
event 011 the program, with but little
opposition. Giidersleeve won easily
from his team mates with a splendid
throw of lii4 feet, 3 inches. Richard
son and Monlux were respectively
second and third.

it. R. Caughey demonstrated that,
despite reports of his condition, he
could still heave the shot farther than
Liversedge, the California husky, who
was expected to spring a possible sur
prise in the event, in his last toss,
Caughey threw the brass pill for a
distance of 45 feet, ti 3-1 inches, which
bettered Liversedge's best heave of
44 feet, 10 inches, by a good margin.
Bihlman was third, giving Stanford
six points in this event.
High ,ln 111 p.
One of California's three lirst places
was recorded in the high jump by
Maker, whose remarkable perform
ance was a feature of the meet. By
reaching a height of (! feet, 4 3-4
inches, the Blue and Gold jumper not
only won the event over his team
mate, Nichols, but also bettered the
Stanford-California record of (J feet,
3 7-8 inches, held by George Horine.
Maker tried for (J feet, 0 inches, after
the meet, but was not successful.
Lachmund excelled all his previous
efforts with a leap of 1! feet, 2 inches,
placing third to Nichols, and netting
Stanford one point in this event.
Itroad Jump.
Bill Sisson again starred in his fav
orite event, and any advantage which
the California supporters may have
seen in his heavily bandaged leg was
dispelled at the outset, when he
jumped 23 feet, ti 1-4 inches, an inch
and a quarter under the Stanford-
California record. Maker of Cali
fornia was second with a leap of 22
feet, 10 inches, and Lockhardt of Cali
fornia was third with 22 feet, 5 inches.
I'ole Vault.
The pole vault went according to
"dope," California taking all nine
points, with Nichols, Wright and
Frisbie tied at 12 feet. Tufts, who
was looked to as a possible point win
ner, went out at It feet, (5 inches,
Phillips, Templeton and Hutchinson
went out at 12 feet.

The Cardinal is waving. Stanford
skill, muscles, and ingenuity earned
for it the right to wave with two
healthy victories, Saturday. A ninth
inning rally, with two down and two
strikes, such as Bihlman started Sat
urday morning, is a fabulous thing,
reserved for ttory books and imagina
tion, but for sue', a stunt to lie fol
lowed by a Meet victory, which
exceeded the fondest expectations of
all but one man —it would be too good

to lie true, if it had not actually hap
pened, (i!) to r>3.
"Dad" Always Optimistic.
The one man who "'doped" things
and stuck to it, was Veteran Coach
"Dad" Moulton. "Dad" doped the
proposition 73 to 19. The most opti
mistic fans and track men could not
fathom better than a 63 to f>9 victory.
A little arithmetic will show who
knew.

Murray Largest Winner.
Captain "Feg" Murray canic into
his own, Saturday. He was hero of
| the day, winning three first places,
the high hurdles, hundred yard dash,
and the two-twenty dash. Murray
did not enter his favorite event, the
low hurdles, saving himself to make

up for the weak spots in the Card

Murray are now four star men.

Though heats had been run in the

place in the half-mile run, in the time
of 1:58. Vedder of California was the
Mruins' best bet, but the best that he
could do was to come in for second
place, yards behind Schnell. Scott of
California was close behind, taking
third place easily.
2'20-Yjml Hurdles.
Clipping 3-5 of a second off the
Stanford-California record in the low
hurdles, Johnny Norton crossed the
line in :24-1, equalling Murray's Pa
cific Coast record. Though Murray
had been taken out of his own race,
Stanford garnered eight points in the
hurdle race, llalsted easily getting
second place from Wolongiewicz,
who took a lone point for the Bears.
For the last year Norton has been
pressing Murray to the limit, and bis
performance on Saturday indicates
that had the men been running in
their regular order a new hurdle
mark would have been set.
Reliiy.
The final event of the afternoon was
another Cardinal victory. With Stan
ford using three of last year's relay
team, and the Bears with two of the
former runners, the rivals toed the
nuirk. Dievendorff led Woodruff all
the way in the first lap. Hertel came
in slightly in the lead of Ryan, the
second Bear runner. Beal and Gib
bon reached the finish at the same in
stant. Lynn and Straub, off to an

even start, ran neck and neck for the
turn. After the first sprint, Lynn led
all the way, coming in two yards
ahead of Straub for a win in 3:20.
Hummer Throw.
Duplicating last year's perform
ance and living up to the expecta
tions of the "dopesters," the Blue and
Gold heavers took nine points 111 the
hammer throw, which was the initial
event 011 the program, with but little
opposition. Giidersleeve won easily
from his team mates with a splendid
throw of lii4 feet, 3 inches. Richard

despite reports of his condition, he
could still heave the shot farther than
Liversedge, the California husky, who
was expected to spring a possible sur

Caughey threw the brass pill for a
distance of 45 feet, ti 3-1 inches, which
bettered Liversedge's best heave of
44 feet, 10 inches, by a good margin.
Bihlman was third, giving Stanford
six points in this event.
High ,ln 111 p.
One of California's three lirst places
was recorded in the high jump by
Maker, whose remarkable perform
ance was a feature of the meet. By
reaching a height of (! feet, 4 3-4
inches, the Blue and Gold jumper not
only won the event over his team
mate, Nichols, but also bettered the
Stanford-California record of (J feet,
3 7-8 inches, held by George Horine.
Maker tried for (J feet, 0 inches, after
the meet, but was not successful.
Lachmund excelled all his previous
efforts with a leap of 1! feet, 2 inches,
placing third to Nichols, and netting
Stanford one point in this event.
Itroad Jump.
Bill Sisson again starred in his fav
orite event, and any advantage which
the California supporters may have
seen in his heavily bandaged leg was
dispelled at the outset, when he
jumped 23 feet, ti 1-4 inches, an inch
and a quarter under the Stanford-
California record. Maker of Cali
fornia was second with a leap of 22
feet, 10 inches, and Lockhardt of Cali
fornia was third with 22 feet, 5 inches.
I'ole Vault.
The pole vault went according to
"dope," California taking all nine

Frisbie tied at 12 feet. Tufts, who
was looked to as a possible point win

Phillips, Templeton and Hutchinson
went out at 12 feet.

The Cardinal is waving. Stanford
skill, muscles, and ingenuity earned
for it the right to wave with two
healthy victories, Saturday. A ninth
inning rally, with two down and two
strikes, such as Bihlman started Sat
urday morning, is a fabulous thing,
reserved for ttory books and imagina
tion, but for sue', a stunt to lie fol
lowed by a Meet victory, which
exceeded the fondest expectations of
all but one man —it would be too good

to lie true, if it had not actually hap
pened, (i!) to r>3.
"Dad" Always Optimistic.
The one man who "'doped" things
and stuck to it, was Veteran Coach
"Dad" Moulton. "Dad" doped the
proposition 73 to 19. The most opti
mistic fans and track men could not
fathom better than a 63 to f>9 victory.
A little arithmetic will show who
knew.

Stanford athletes took ten lirsl
places and the relay. Every track
event ended with a Cardinal in the
lead. Two Held firsts arc credited to

seconds and thirds fell to the lot of

.
Murray Largest Winner.
Captain "Feg" Murray canic into
his own, Saturday. He was hero of
| the day, winning three first places,
the high hurdles, hundred yard dash,
and the two-twenty dash. Murray
did not enter his favorite event, the
low hurdles, saving himself to make

up for the weak spots in the Card
inal squad. "Skin" Wilson stowed
away his fourth consecutive Rig Meet
mile first place. Both Wilson and
Murray are now four star men.

Surprises were the order of the
day. Wright Lynn tied the 440-yard

j which brought him second place in

I romped in first in !he half-mile, con
trary to expectations, defeating Aup

in the mile. Halsted's taking second
place in the low hurdles was another
surprise.
Mile Wiiii.
Though heats had been run in the
century dash, the mile run was the
first final track event of the afternoon.
The race went true to dope, Stanford
taking first and second with Wilson
and Aupperle, those two men finish
ing in the same order as last year,
Wilson winning his fourth consecu
tive race in the time of <1:24. Davis
of California came in with tlu 1 final
point. Eleven men started in tin l

heats. In the lirst trial Murray and
Davis of Stanford took first and third
with Wadsworth of California second.
In the second heat Grant and .Need

with Bowen of California second.
Time for the lirst heat was :1U-1 and
for the second :10-2. Murray led all
the way in the deciding sprint, win
ning in : 10-1, yards ahead of Wads
worth and Bowen, the Blue and Cold
runners, who took second and third.
High II urdIt's.
immediately after winning the 100-
yard dash, Captain Murray toed the
mark for his hardest race of the day,
the 120-yard high hurdle duel with
Captain "led" Treble of California.
Murray was after Treble's scalp, the
latter having taken the race last year,
and the Stanford leader's hopes were
not in vain, for he crossed the line a
full yard ahead of his rival, winning
the event in :15-2. The two captains
ran neck and neck over all but the
last hurdle, which was cleared by
Preble an instant ahead of Murray;
but the latter made up in the final
dash to the tape. Johnny Norton
was so close to Preble that the judges
had a hard time deciding whether the
Blue and Cold captain had come in
second or third.
The final award gave Norton third
place, giving Stanford six points in
the high stick race.
110-Yard Dash.
Taking the lead at the start, never
to be headed, Lynn of Stanford took
the quarter in 50 seconds flat,, equal
ling the Stanford-California record in
this event. The surprise of the race
was the wonderful showing of Dieven
dorff, who came in close behind Lynn
with a second place for the Cardinal.
.Gibbon of California was in second
place until the last twenty yards,
when Dievendorfl let out a spurt that
carried him ahead of the Blue aud
Gold man and almost overtook Lynn
at the tape.
Two Mile Piiin.
Again in the two mile grind, the
"dope" was upset. Chapman, whose
performances to date have been too
erratic to induce confidence, came
through with a great burst of speed
in the last lap, which carried him
far ahead of Lloyd, his principal Blue
and Gold competitor, and gave him the
race in 9:57. Talbot of California
led the field until the seventh lap,
when he dropped out. He had been
pressed to the limit by Art Wilson of
Stanford, who dropped back of both
Chapman and Lloyd in the last lap.
In the final sprint, Loucks of Stan
ford passed the plucky Wilson, and
came in for third place.
220-Vsird Dash.
The stands were surprised when
"Feg" Murray lined up for the first
heat in the 220-yard dash, for the
Stanford captain had not entered in
this event. In the trial he ran sec
ond to Wadsworth of California, with
Grant of Stanford in third place. In
the second heat, Bowen and Nelson
of California and Davis of Stanford
qualified. The time for the heats had
been :22 1 and :23 3 respectively. In
the deciding dash Captain Murray
came through with a win in : 21-3,
clipping 2-5 of a second off the for
mer dual meet record. Wadsworth
and Nelson took second and third in
this event.
880-Yard Hun.
Continuing the regular work of
former-Captain Bonnett, Schnell of
Stanford romped to the tape for first
place in the half-mile run, in the time
of 1:58. Vedder of California was the
Mruins' best bet, but the best that he
could do was to come in for second
place, yards behind Schnell. Scott of

One of California's three lirst places

Stanford-California record of (J feet,
3 7-8 inches, held by George Horine.
Maker tried for (J feet, 0 inches, after
the meet, but was not successful.

Stanford one point in this event.

Bill Sisson again starred in his fav

the California supporters may have
seen in his heavily bandaged leg was
dispelled at the outset, when he

The Cardinal is waving. Stanford
skill, muscles, and ingenuity earned
for it the right to wave with two
healthy victories, Saturday. A ninth
inning rally, with two down and two
strikes, such as Bihlman started Sat
urday morning, is a fabulous thing,
reserved for ttory books and imagina
tion, but for sue', a stunt to lie fol
lowed by a Meet victory, which
exceeded the fondest expectations of
all but one man —it would be too good

to lie true, if it had not actually hap
pened, (i!) to r>3.
"Dad" Always Optimistic.
The one man who "'doped" things
and stuck to it, was Veteran Coach
"Dad" Moulton. "Dad" doped the
proposition 73 to 19. The most opti
mistic fans and track men could not
fathom better than a 63 to f>9 victory.
A little arithmetic will show who
knew.
Cardinal Supreme on Track.
Stanford athletes took ten lirsl
places and the relay. Every track
event ended with a Cardinal in the
lead. Two Held firsts arc credited to

. Stanford men. Not only firsts, but
seconds and thirds fell to the lot of
! the home athletes, contrary to ex
! pectations.
.
Murray Largest Winner.
Captain "Feg" Murray canic into
his own, Saturday. He was hero of
| the day, winning three first places,
the high hurdles, hundred yard dash,
and the two-twenty dash. Murray
did not enter his favorite event, the
low hurdles, saving himself to make

up for the weak spots in the Card
inal squad. "Skin" Wilson stowed
away his fourth consecutive Rig Meet
mile first place. Both Wilson and
Murray are now four star men.
Records (jo.
Records went hy the boards in a
number of instances. Captain Mur

record of 22 Hat, held by Coleman and
Campbell. His time was 21 and

of :24 4-5. to :24 l-. r ». upsetting dope
entirely. In the high jump, Maker oi'
California broke the record of Ceovg'.

Surprises Many.
Surprises were the order of the
day. Wright Lynn tied the 440-yard
j record of :. r >o flat, made by Wynian in
| 1910. Diovendorlf won his way to the
| hearts of the fans with a plucky sprint
j which brought him second place in
j this race, barely behind Lynn. Sclincll
I romped in first in !he half-mile, con
trary to expectations, defeating Aup
perle, who bad been forced to the limit

in the mile. Halsted's taking second
place in the low hurdles was another
surprise.
Mile Wiiii.
Though heats had been run in the
century dash, the mile run was the
first final track event of the afternoon.
The race went true to dope, Stanford
taking first and second with Wilson
and Aupperle, those two men finish
ing in the same order as last year,
Wilson winning his fourth consecu
tive race in the time of <1:24. Davis
of California came in with tlu 1 final
point. Eleven men started in tin l
four-lap event.

men placed iu the 100-yard dash
heats. In the lirst trial Murray and
Davis of Stanford took first and third
with Wadsworth of California second.
In the second heat Grant and .Need
ham of Stanford were lirst and third,
with Bowen of California second.
Time for the lirst heat was :1U-1 and
for the second :10-2. Murray led all
the way in the deciding sprint, win
ning in : 10-1, yards ahead of Wads
worth and Bowen, the Blue and Cold
runners, who took second and third.
High II urdIt's.
immediately after winning the 100-
yard dash, Captain Murray toed the
mark for his hardest race of the day,
the 120-yard high hurdle duel with
Captain "led" Treble of California.
Murray was after Treble's scalp, the
latter having taken the race last year,
and the Stanford leader's hopes were
not in vain, for he crossed the line a
full yard ahead of his rival, winning
the event in :15-2. The two captains
ran neck and neck over all but the
last hurdle, which was cleared by
Preble an instant ahead of Murray;
but the latter made up in the final
dash to the tape. Johnny Norton
was so close to Preble that the judges
had a hard time deciding whether the
Blue and Cold captain had come in
second or third.
The final award gave Norton third
place, giving Stanford six points in
the high stick race.
110-Yard Dash.
Taking the lead at the start, never
to be headed, Lynn of Stanford took
the quarter in 50 seconds flat,, equal
ling the Stanford-California record in
this event. The surprise of the race
was the wonderful showing of Dieven
dorff, who came in close behind Lynn
with a second place for the Cardinal.
.Gibbon of California was in second
place until the last twenty yards,
when Dievendorfl let out a spurt that
carried him ahead of the Blue aud
Gold man and almost overtook Lynn
at the tape.
Two Mile Piiin.
Again in the two mile grind, the
"dope" was upset. Chapman, whose
performances to date have been too
erratic to induce confidence, came
through with a great burst of speed
in the last lap, which carried him
far ahead of Lloyd, his principal Blue
and Gold competitor, and gave him the
race in 9:57. Talbot of California
led the field until the seventh lap,
when he dropped out. He had been
pressed to the limit by Art Wilson of
Stanford, who dropped back of both
Chapman and Lloyd in the last lap.
In the final sprint, Loucks of Stan
ford passed the plucky Wilson, and
came in for third place.
220-Vsird Dash.
The stands were surprised when
"Feg" Murray lined up for the first
heat in the 220-yard dash, for the
Stanford captain had not entered in
this event. In the trial he ran sec
ond to Wadsworth of California, with
Grant of Stanford in third place. In
the second heat, Bowen and Nelson
of California and Davis of Stanford
qualified. The time for the heats had
been :22 1 and :23 3 respectively. In
the deciding dash Captain Murray
came through with a win in : 21-3,
clipping 2-5 of a second off the for
mer dual meet record. Wadsworth
and Nelson took second and third in
this event.
880-Yard Hun.
Continuing the regular work of
former-Captain Bonnett, Schnell of
Stanford romped to the tape for first
place in the half-mile run, in the time
of 1:58. Vedder of California was the
Mruins' best bet, but the best that he
could do was to come in for second
place, yards behind Schnell. Scott of
California was close behind, taking
third place easily.
2'20-Yjml Hurdles.
Clipping 3-5 of a second off the
Stanford-California record in the low
hurdles, Johnny Norton crossed the
line in :24-1, equalling Murray's Pa
cific Coast record. Though Murray
had been taken out of his own race,
Stanford garnered eight points in the
hurdle race, llalsted easily getting
second place from Wolongiewicz,
who took a lone point for the Bears.
For the last year Norton has been
pressing Murray to the limit, and bis
performance on Saturday indicates
that had the men been running in
their regular order a new hurdle
mark would have been set.
Reliiy.
The final event of the afternoon was
another Cardinal victory. With Stan
ford using three of last year's relay
team, and the Bears with two of the
former runners, the rivals toed the
nuirk. Dievendorff led Woodruff all
the way in the first lap. Hertel came
in slightly in the lead of Ryan, the
second Bear runner. Beal and Gib
bon reached the finish at the same in
stant. Lynn and Straub, off to an

even start, ran neck and neck for the
turn. After the first sprint, Lynn led
all the way, coming in two yards
ahead of Straub for a win in 3:20.
Hummer Throw.
Duplicating last year's perform
ance and living up to the expecta
tions of the "dopesters," the Blue and
Gold heavers took nine points 111 the
hammer throw, which was the initial
event 011 the program, with but little
opposition. Giidersleeve won easily
from his team mates with a splendid
throw of lii4 feet, 3 inches. Richard
son and Monlux were respectively
second and third.

Liversedge, the California husky, who

Caughey threw the brass pill for a
distance of 45 feet, ti 3-1 inches, which
bettered Liversedge's best heave of

Bihlman was third, giving Stanford

The Cardinal is waving. Stanford
skill, muscles, and ingenuity earned
for it the right to wave with two
healthy victories, Saturday. A ninth
inning rally, with two down and two
strikes, such as Bihlman started Sat
urday morning, is a fabulous thing,
reserved for ttory books and imagina
tion, but for sue', a stunt to lie fol
lowed by a Meet victory, which
exceeded the fondest expectations of
all but one man —it would be too good

to lie true, if it had not actually hap
pened, (i!) to r>3.
"Dad" Always Optimistic.
The one man who "'doped" things
and stuck to it, was Veteran Coach
"Dad" Moulton. "Dad" doped the
proposition 73 to 19. The most opti
mistic fans and track men could not
fathom better than a 63 to f>9 victory.
A little arithmetic will show who
knew.

Stanford athletes took ten lirsl
places and the relay. Every track
event ended with a Cardinal in the
lead. Two Held firsts arc credited to

.
Murray Largest Winner.
Captain "Feg" Murray canic into
his own, Saturday. He was hero of
| the day, winning three first places,
the high hurdles, hundred yard dash,
and the two-twenty dash. Murray
did not enter his favorite event, the
low hurdles, saving himself to make

up for the weak spots in the Card
inal squad. "Skin" Wilson stowed
away his fourth consecutive Rig Meet
mile first place. Both Wilson and
Murray are now four star men.

Surprises Many.
Surprises were the order of the
day. Wright Lynn tied the 440-yard
j record of :. r >o flat, made by Wynian in
| 1910. Diovendorlf won his way to the
| hearts of the fans with a plucky sprint
j which brought him second place in
j this race, barely behind Lynn. Sclincll
I romped in first in !he half-mile, con
trary to expectations, defeating Aup
perle, who bad been forced to the limit

in the mile. Halsted's taking second
place in the low hurdles was another
surprise.
Mile Wiiii.
Though heats had been run in the
century dash, the mile run was the
first final track event of the afternoon.
The race went true to dope, Stanford
taking first and second with Wilson
and Aupperle, those two men finish
ing in the same order as last year,
Wilson winning his fourth consecu
tive race in the time of <1:24. Davis
of California came in with tlu 1 final
point. Eleven men started in tin l
four-lap event.

men placed iu the 100-yard dash
heats. In the lirst trial Murray and
Davis of Stanford took first and third
with Wadsworth of California second.
In the second heat Grant and .Need
ham of Stanford were lirst and third,
with Bowen of California second.
Time for the lirst heat was :1U-1 and
for the second :10-2. Murray led all
the way in the deciding sprint, win
ning in : 10-1, yards ahead of Wads
worth and Bowen, the Blue and Cold
runners, who took second and third.
High II urdIt's.
immediately after winning the 100-
yard dash, Captain Murray toed the
mark for his hardest race of the day,
the 120-yard high hurdle duel with
Captain "led" Treble of California.
Murray was after Treble's scalp, the
latter having taken the race last year,
and the Stanford leader's hopes were
not in vain, for he crossed the line a
full yard ahead of his rival, winning
the event in :15-2. The two captains
ran neck and neck over all but the
last hurdle, which was cleared by
Preble an instant ahead of Murray;
but the latter made up in the final
dash to the tape. Johnny Norton
was so close to Preble that the judges
had a hard time deciding whether the
Blue and Cold captain had come in
second or third.
The final award gave Norton third
place, giving Stanford six points in
the high stick race.
110-Yard Dash.
Taking the lead at the start, never
to be headed, Lynn of Stanford took
the quarter in 50 seconds flat,, equal
ling the Stanford-California record in
this event. The surprise of the race
was the wonderful showing of Dieven
dorff, who came in close behind Lynn
with a second place for the Cardinal.
.Gibbon of California was in second
place until the last twenty yards,
when Dievendorfl let out a spurt that
carried him ahead of the Blue aud
Gold man and almost overtook Lynn
at the tape.
Two Mile Piiin.
Again in the two mile grind, the
"dope" was upset. Chapman, whose
performances to date have been too
erratic to induce confidence, came
through with a great burst of speed
in the last lap, which carried him
far ahead of Lloyd, his principal Blue
and Gold competitor, and gave him the
race in 9:57. Talbot of California
led the field until the seventh lap,
when he dropped out. He had been
pressed to the limit by Art Wilson of
Stanford, who dropped back of both
Chapman and Lloyd in the last lap.
In the final sprint, Loucks of Stan
ford passed the plucky Wilson, and
came in for third place.
220-Vsird Dash.
The stands were surprised when
"Feg" Murray lined up for the first
heat in the 220-yard dash, for the
Stanford captain had not entered in
this event. In the trial he ran sec
ond to Wadsworth of California, with
Grant of Stanford in third place. In
the second heat, Bowen and Nelson
of California and Davis of Stanford
qualified. The time for the heats had
been :22 1 and :23 3 respectively. In
the deciding dash Captain Murray
came through with a win in : 21-3,
clipping 2-5 of a second off the for
mer dual meet record. Wadsworth
and Nelson took second and third in
this event.
880-Yard Hun.
Continuing the regular work of
former-Captain Bonnett, Schnell of
Stanford romped to the tape for first
place in the half-mile run, in the time
of 1:58. Vedder of California was the
Mruins' best bet, but the best that he
could do was to come in for second
place, yards behind Schnell. Scott of
California was close behind, taking
third place easily.
2'20-Yjml Hurdles.
Clipping 3-5 of a second off the
Stanford-California record in the low
hurdles, Johnny Norton crossed the
line in :24-1, equalling Murray's Pa
cific Coast record. Though Murray
had been taken out of his own race,
Stanford garnered eight points in the
hurdle race, llalsted easily getting
second place from Wolongiewicz,
who took a lone point for the Bears.
For the last year Norton has been
pressing Murray to the limit, and bis
performance on Saturday indicates
that had the men been running in
their regular order a new hurdle
mark would have been set.
Reliiy.
The final event of the afternoon was
another Cardinal victory. With Stan
ford using three of last year's relay
team, and the Bears with two of the
former runners, the rivals toed the
nuirk. Dievendorff led Woodruff all
the way in the first lap. Hertel came
in slightly in the lead of Ryan, the
second Bear runner. Beal and Gib
bon reached the finish at the same in
stant. Lynn and Straub, off to an

even start, ran neck and neck for the
turn. After the first sprint, Lynn led
all the way, coming in two yards
ahead of Straub for a win in 3:20.
Hummer Throw.
Duplicating last year's perform
ance and living up to the expecta
tions of the "dopesters," the Blue and
Gold heavers took nine points 111 the
hammer throw, which was the initial
event 011 the program, with but little
opposition. Giidersleeve won easily
from his team mates with a splendid
throw of lii4 feet, 3 inches. Richard
son and Monlux were respectively
second and third.

it. R. Caughey demonstrated that,
despite reports of his condition, he
could still heave the shot farther than
Liversedge, the California husky, who
was expected to spring a possible sur
prise in the event, in his last toss,
Caughey threw the brass pill for a
distance of 45 feet, ti 3-1 inches, which
bettered Liversedge's best heave of
44 feet, 10 inches, by a good margin.
Bihlman was third, giving Stanford
six points in this event.
High ,ln 111 p.
One of California's three lirst places
was recorded in the high jump by
Maker, whose remarkable perform
ance was a feature of the meet. By
reaching a height of (! feet, 4 3-4
inches, the Blue and Gold jumper not
only won the event over his team
mate, Nichols, but also bettered the
Stanford-California record of (J feet,
3 7-8 inches, held by George Horine.
Maker tried for (J feet, 0 inches, after
the meet, but was not successful.
Lachmund excelled all his previous
efforts with a leap of 1! feet, 2 inches,
placing third to Nichols, and netting
Stanford one point in this event.
Itroad Jump.
Bill Sisson again starred in his fav
orite event, and any advantage which
the California supporters may have
seen in his heavily bandaged leg was
dispelled at the outset, when he
jumped 23 feet, ti 1-4 inches, an inch
and a quarter under the Stanford-
California record. Maker of Cali
fornia was second with a leap of 22
feet, 10 inches, and Lockhardt of Cali
fornia was third with 22 feet, 5 inches.
I'ole Vault.
The pole vault went according to
"dope," California taking all nine
points, with Nichols, Wright and
Frisbie tied at 12 feet. Tufts, who
was looked to as a possible point win

Phillips, Templeton and Hutchinson
went out at 12 feet.

skill, muscles, and ingenuity earned
for it the right to wave with two
healthy victories, Saturday. A ninth
inning rally, with two down and two
strikes, such as Bihlman started Sat
urday morning, is a fabulous thing,
reserved for ttory books and imagina
tion, but for sue', a stunt to lie fol
lowed by a Meet victory, which
exceeded the fondest expectations of
all but one man —it would be too good

to lie true, if it had not actually hap
pened, (i!) to r>3.
"Dad" Always Optimistic.
The one man who "'doped" things
and stuck to it, was Veteran Coach
"Dad" Moulton. "Dad" doped the
proposition 73 to 19. The most opti
mistic fans and track men could not
fathom better than a 63 to f>9 victory.
A little arithmetic will show who
knew.
Cardinal Supreme on Track.
Stanford athletes took ten lirsl
places and the relay. Every track
event ended with a Cardinal in the
lead. Two Held firsts arc credited to

. Stanford men. Not only firsts, but
seconds and thirds fell to the lot of
! the home athletes, contrary to ex
! pectations.
.
Murray Largest Winner.
Captain "Feg" Murray canic into
his own, Saturday. He was hero of
| the day, winning three first places,
the high hurdles, hundred yard dash,
and the two-twenty dash. Murray
did not enter his favorite event, the
low hurdles, saving himself to make

up for the weak spots in the Card
inal squad. "Skin" Wilson stowed
away his fourth consecutive Rig Meet
mile first place. Both Wilson and
Murray are now four star men.
Records (jo.
Records went hy the boards in a
number of instances. Captain Mur
ray broke the two-twenty yard dash
record of 22 Hat, held by Coleman and
Campbell. His time was 21 and
seconds. Johnny Norton lowered
"I'Yg" Murray's low hurdle record
of :24 4-5. to :24 l-. r ». upsetting dope
entirely. In the high jump, Maker oi'
California broke the record of Ceovg'.

I llorine by jumping G foot, 1 15-4 inches.
Surprises Many.
Surprises were the order of the
day. Wright Lynn tied the 440-yard
j record of :. r >o flat, made by Wynian in
| 1910. Diovendorlf won his way to the
| hearts of the fans with a plucky sprint
j which brought him second place in
j this race, barely behind Lynn. Sclincll
I romped in first in !he half-mile, con
trary to expectations, defeating Aup
perle, who bad been forced to the limit

in the mile. Halsted's taking second
place in the low hurdles was another
surprise.
Mile Wiiii.
Though heats had been run in the
century dash, the mile run was the
first final track event of the afternoon.
The race went true to dope, Stanford
taking first and second with Wilson
and Aupperle, those two men finish
ing in the same order as last year,
Wilson winning his fourth consecu
tive race in the time of <1:24. Davis
of California came in with tlu 1 final
point. Eleven men started in tin l
four-lap event.

men placed iu the 100-yard dash
heats. In the lirst trial Murray and
Davis of Stanford took first and third
with Wadsworth of California second.
In the second heat Grant and .Need
ham of Stanford were lirst and third,
with Bowen of California second.
Time for the lirst heat was :1U-1 and
for the second :10-2. Murray led all
the way in the deciding sprint, win
ning in : 10-1, yards ahead of Wads
worth and Bowen, the Blue and Cold
runners, who took second and third.
High II urdIt's.
immediately after winning the 100-
yard dash, Captain Murray toed the
mark for his hardest race of the day,
the 120-yard high hurdle duel with
Captain "led" Treble of California.
Murray was after Treble's scalp, the
latter having taken the race last year,
and the Stanford leader's hopes were
not in vain, for he crossed the line a
full yard ahead of his rival, winning
the event in :15-2. The two captains
ran neck and neck over all but the
last hurdle, which was cleared by
Preble an instant ahead of Murray;
but the latter made up in the final
dash to the tape. Johnny Norton
was so close to Preble that the judges
had a hard time deciding whether the
Blue and Cold captain had come in
second or third.
The final award gave Norton third
place, giving Stanford six points in
the high stick race.
110-Yard Dash.
Taking the lead at the start, never
to be headed, Lynn of Stanford took
the quarter in 50 seconds flat,, equal
ling the Stanford-California record in
this event. The surprise of the race
was the wonderful showing of Dieven
dorff, who came in close behind Lynn
with a second place for the Cardinal.
.Gibbon of California was in second
place until the last twenty yards,
when Dievendorfl let out a spurt that
carried him ahead of the Blue aud
Gold man and almost overtook Lynn
at the tape.
Two Mile Piiin.
Again in the two mile grind, the
"dope" was upset. Chapman, whose
performances to date have been too
erratic to induce confidence, came
through with a great burst of speed
in the last lap, which carried him
far ahead of Lloyd, his principal Blue
and Gold competitor, and gave him the
race in 9:57. Talbot of California
led the field until the seventh lap,
when he dropped out. He had been
pressed to the limit by Art Wilson of
Stanford, who dropped back of both
Chapman and Lloyd in the last lap.
In the final sprint, Loucks of Stan
ford passed the plucky Wilson, and
came in for third place.
220-Vsird Dash.
The stands were surprised when
"Feg" Murray lined up for the first
heat in the 220-yard dash, for the
Stanford captain had not entered in
this event. In the trial he ran sec
ond to Wadsworth of California, with
Grant of Stanford in third place. In
the second heat, Bowen and Nelson
of California and Davis of Stanford
qualified. The time for the heats had
been :22 1 and :23 3 respectively. In
the deciding dash Captain Murray
came through with a win in : 21-3,
clipping 2-5 of a second off the for
mer dual meet record. Wadsworth
and Nelson took second and third in
this event.
880-Yard Hun.
Continuing the regular work of
former-Captain Bonnett, Schnell of
Stanford romped to the tape for first
place in the half-mile run, in the time
of 1:58. Vedder of California was the
Mruins' best bet, but the best that he
could do was to come in for second
place, yards behind Schnell. Scott of
California was close behind, taking
third place easily.
2'20-Yjml Hurdles.
Clipping 3-5 of a second off the
Stanford-California record in the low
hurdles, Johnny Norton crossed the
line in :24-1, equalling Murray's Pa
cific Coast record. Though Murray
had been taken out of his own race,
Stanford garnered eight points in the
hurdle race, llalsted easily getting
second place from Wolongiewicz,
who took a lone point for the Bears.
For the last year Norton has been
pressing Murray to the limit, and bis
performance on Saturday indicates
that had the men been running in
their regular order a new hurdle
mark would have been set.
Reliiy.
The final event of the afternoon was
another Cardinal victory. With Stan
ford using three of last year's relay
team, and the Bears with two of the
former runners, the rivals toed the
nuirk. Dievendorff led Woodruff all
the way in the first lap. Hertel came
in slightly in the lead of Ryan, the
second Bear runner. Beal and Gib
bon reached the finish at the same in
stant. Lynn and Straub, off to an

even start, ran neck and neck for the
turn. After the first sprint, Lynn led
all the way, coming in two yards
ahead of Straub for a win in 3:20.
Hummer Throw.
Duplicating last year's perform
ance and living up to the expecta
tions of the "dopesters," the Blue and
Gold heavers took nine points 111 the
hammer throw, which was the initial
event 011 the program, with but little
opposition. Giidersleeve won easily
from his team mates with a splendid
throw of lii4 feet, 3 inches. Richard
son and Monlux were respectively
second and third.
Sliot-l'ut.
it. R. Caughey demonstrated that,
despite reports of his condition, he
could still heave the shot farther than
Liversedge, the California husky, who
was expected to spring a possible sur
prise in the event, in his last toss,
Caughey threw the brass pill for a
distance of 45 feet, ti 3-1 inches, which
bettered Liversedge's best heave of
44 feet, 10 inches, by a good margin.
Bihlman was third, giving Stanford
six points in this event.
High ,ln 111 p.
One of California's three lirst places
was recorded in the high jump by
Maker, whose remarkable perform
ance was a feature of the meet. By
reaching a height of (! feet, 4 3-4
inches, the Blue and Gold jumper not
only won the event over his team
mate, Nichols, but also bettered the
Stanford-California record of (J feet,
3 7-8 inches, held by George Horine.
Maker tried for (J feet, 0 inches, after
the meet, but was not successful.
Lachmund excelled all his previous
efforts with a leap of 1! feet, 2 inches,
placing third to Nichols, and netting
Stanford one point in this event.
Itroad Jump.
Bill Sisson again starred in his fav
orite event, and any advantage which
the California supporters may have
seen in his heavily bandaged leg was
dispelled at the outset, when he
jumped 23 feet, ti 1-4 inches, an inch
and a quarter under the Stanford-
California record. Maker of Cali
fornia was second with a leap of 22
feet, 10 inches, and Lockhardt of Cali
fornia was third with 22 feet, 5 inches.
I'ole Vault.
The pole vault went according to
"dope," California taking all nine
points, with Nichols, Wright and
Frisbie tied at 12 feet. Tufts, who
was looked to as a possible point win
ner, went out at It feet, (5 inches,
Phillips, Templeton and Hutchinson
went out at 12 feet.
