# Cardinal Waves as Track Team Sweeps Bears From Boards in Sensational Meet
## Exceeding Fondest Expectations and Upsetting Dope of Most Optimistic Students, Cinder Path Men Defeat Blue and Gold, by a 69 to 53 Score, Smashing Three Records 
### 
The Cardinal is waving. Stanford
skill, muscles, and ingenuity earned
for it the right to wave with two
healthy victories, Saturday. A ninth
inning rally, with two down and two
strikes, such as Bihlman started Sat
urday morning, is a fabulous thing,
reserved for ttory books and imagina
tion, but for sue', a stunt to lie fol
lowed by a Meet victory, which
exceeded the fondest expectations of
all but one man —it would be too good

to lie true, if it had not actually hap
pened, (i!) to r>3.
"Dad" Always Optimistic.
The one man who "'doped" things
and stuck to it, was Veteran Coach
"Dad" Moulton. "Dad" doped the
proposition 73 to 19. The most opti
mistic fans and track men could not
fathom better than a 63 to f>9 victory.
A little arithmetic will show who
knew.
Cardinal Supreme on Track.
Stanford athletes took ten lirsl
places and the relay. Every track
event ended with a Cardinal in the
lead. Two Held firsts arc credited to

. Stanford men. Not only firsts, but
seconds and thirds fell to the lot of
! the home athletes, contrary to ex
! pectations.

Murray Largest Winner.
Captain "Feg" Murray canic into
his own, Saturday. He was hero of
| the day, winning three first places,
the high hurdles, hundred yard dash,
and the two-twenty dash. Murray
did not enter his favorite event, the
low hurdles, saving himself to make

up for the weak spots in the Card
inal squad. "Skin" Wilson stowed
away his fourth consecutive Rig Meet
mile first place. Both Wilson and
Murray are now four star men.
Records (jo.
Records went hy the boards in a
number of instances. Captain Mur
ray broke the two-twenty yard dash
record of 22 Hat, held by Coleman and
Campbell. His time was 21 and
seconds. Johnny Norton lowered
"I'Yg" Murray's low hurdle record
of :24 4-5. to :24 l-. r ». upsetting dope
entirely. In the high jump, Maker oi'
California broke the record of Ceovg'.

I llorine by jumping G foot, 1 15-4 inches.
Surprises Many.
Surprises were the order of the
day. Wright Lynn tied the 440-yard
j record of :. r >o flat, made by Wynian in
| 1910. Diovendorlf won his way to the
| hearts of the fans with a plucky sprint
j which brought him second place in
j this race, barely behind Lynn. Sclincll
I romped in first in !he half-mile, con
trary to expectations, defeating Aup
perle, who bad been forced to the limit

in the mile. Halsted's taking second
place in the low hurdles was another
surprise.
Mile Wiiii.
Though heats had been run in the
century dash, the mile run was the
first final track event of the afternoon.
The race went true to dope, Stanford
taking first and second with Wilson
and Aupperle, those two men finish
ing in the same order as last year,

tive race in the time of <1:24. Davis
