Stanford wins again—and again.
Fighting chances for victories were
turned into sure wins on Saturday by
the ability and the spirit of Stanford
men.
Stanford's li'l old ball club came
through with an exhibition of base
ball Saturday which augurs well for
the results of the series when it is
finally chalked up after the next
game. Our congratulations to Murray
and Dent and their men, and good
luck to the ball team in their next
game.
Stanford proved in the track meet
that though she produces stars, and
is proud of them, she can depend on
the other men on the team to cinch
points that count. That's another
thing to be proud of.
Stanford debaters lost the Carnot
on Friday night when victory would
have been sweet. But the three Stan
ford men put up a fight which al
most changed the decision. Debating
is on the up-grade at Stanford. Look
out for next year.
We also extend further congratula
tions to the fencing teams which took
California into camp, on Friday and
Saturday, and to Captain Herb Malm
for his work at O.iai.
It's been a glorious week-end—and
we feel sure that the next will be
just as good.
