# CREW COACHES TRAIN RIVAL OARSMEN FOR REGATTA
## BOW POSITIONS UNDECIDED May Add Second Freshman Race to Saturday's Contests on Oakland Estuary 
### 
With the track meet out of the way,
the attention of Stanford and Cali
fornia students is now divided be
tween the intercollegiate rowing re
gatta on Oakland estuary on Satur
day and the final baseball game of the
1916 series. The regatta will be held
in the forenoon, while the baseball
championship will be decided on the
Bears' diamond at 3 o'clock in the
afternoon. '
Both Coach "Husky" Guerena of
Stanford, and Coach Wallis of the
Blue and Gold eight are working hard
on the final selection of the teams
which meet in Saturday's race. Both
coaches are directing the workouts
of two varsity and two freshmen
teams. If present plans are carried
out, all of these eights may meet in
Saturday's regatta. The two varsity
shells will row over the regular three
mile course, while the freshmen and
second varsity teams will meet for a
two-mile run. The fourth race, now
under consideration, is a one-mile
sprint for the second freshmen teams
of the two universities.
Curiously enough, the bow positions
in both the Stanford and California
shells are the most unsettled. Coach
Wallis lias shifted his how and num
ber two men several times in the past
week, several men coming up from
the second shell. Clune and De
Mund, who have spent most of the
practice season in the California sec
ond shell, are now making a hard
fight for the how positions on the var
sity, in place of Ebner and Hoga
boon.
During the past week, Coach Guer
ena has found it necessary to make
several shifts in the Cardinal bow
positions. Two combinations of the
bow three have been tried, both dif
fering from the lineup in the Wash
ington race. In the one, Andrews is
placed at three, Worth at two and
Heron at bow. In the other, Heron
is shifted to number three, Worth left
at two, and Neuner taken from the
second shell and placed at bow. The
coach will announce the definite per
sonnel of Saturday's team either to l
morrow or Thursday.
