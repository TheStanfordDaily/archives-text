# BOX AND SWIM U.C. ON THURSDAY

### 
Stanford meets California Thurs
day afternoon in the first intercol
legiate swimming contest ever held
between these universities. The meet
will start at 3:4."> o'clock in the Stan
ford pool, and both men and women
will be admitted.
Cardinal swimmers are entered in
each of the regular eight events which
have made up the meets so far this
season, and added interest is given
the competition by the likelihood that
the Circle S will be granted to point

winners. California appears to be a
favorite in the dashes, with Ludy
Langer, the American middle-distance
champion, in those events, supported
by George Lindsay, who finished sec
ond to George Cunha in the Coast
championship race for the 50-yard
dash. Lindsay was here recently
with the Olympic team. Stanford is
doped to win in the breast and back
stroke races and the plunge and div
ing. I'nless the dope is upset be-
