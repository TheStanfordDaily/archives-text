# ASSEMBLY FOR MILITARY DRILL
## San Francisco Men Coming to Discuss Summer Camp Monterey Camp Will Be Subject of Student Meeting Next Week 
### 
An assembly will be held early next
week for the purpose of bringing be
fore the students of the University
facts concerning the military training
camp which is to be held at Monterey
from July 10 to August 5. This meet
ing of the men will doubtless be at
1:30 in the afternoon, excusing all af
ternoon classes. The best speakers
available in San Francisco are being
secured by men interested in the
movement for such camps, and the
information they have will beyond
doubt interest most of the men in the
University.
A committee composed of Dr. H. R.
Stolz, Dr. T. M. Williams, and Asso
ciate Professor E. W. Martin of the
Greek department, have been appoint
ed to stir up interest in the camps on
the campus. They have been in touch
with men who want military training
introduced into Stanford, and it is ex
pected that many of them will go to
Monterey this summer to get a sample
of what the training will be like.
History of Training Camps.
The interest in training camps,
which are intended primarily to de
velop officers, has grown steadily all
as to threaten the life of intercol
legiate athletics on the coast. A gen
over the country since July, 1913,
when the first camp of the Regular
Army for college and high school stu
dents was held on the field of Gettys
burg. In 1914 and 1915 similar camps
were held in various parts of the
country. In June, 1915, a movement
was started among the younger pro
fessional and business men, which re
sulted in the establishment of the
Gettysburg camp, at which there were
1,800 men last year.
In case of war, the greatest need
would be, not for men, but for of
ficers to train those men. One of the
chief values of these camps is the
training along this line that man gets.
Aside from this consideration, how
ever, there is the benefit to be derived
from the out-of-door life which such
a camp affords. Also much valuable
information is given concerning camp
and personal sanitation.
The cost will probably be on an av
erage of $40 per man, including uni
form, which is of such a nature that
it can be used for any camping trip.
The food served is of the best, as is
all the camp equipment furnished by
the government.

A committee composed of Dr. H. R.
Stolz, Dr. T. M. Williams, and Asso
ciate Professor E. W. Martin of the
Greek department, have been appoint
ed to stir up interest in the camps on
the campus. They have been in touch
with men who want military training
introduced into Stanford, and it is ex
pected that many of them will go to
Monterey this summer to get a sample
of what the training will be like.
History of Training Camps.
The interest in training camps,
which are intended primarily to de
velop officers, has grown steadily all
as to threaten the life of intercol
legiate athletics on the coast. A gen
over the country since July, 1913,
when the first camp of the Regular
Army for college and high school stu
dents was held on the field of Gettys
burg. In 1914 and 1915 similar camps
were held in various parts of the
country. In June, 1915, a movement
was started among the younger pro
fessional and business men, which re
sulted in the establishment of the
Gettysburg camp, at which there were
1,800 men last year.
In case of war, the greatest need
would be, not for men, but for of
ficers to train those men. One of the
chief values of these camps is the
training along this line that man gets.
Aside from this consideration, how
ever, there is the benefit to be derived
from the out-of-door life which such
a camp affords. Also much valuable
information is given concerning camp
and personal sanitation.
The cost will probably be on an av
erage of $40 per man, including uni
form, which is of such a nature that
it can be used for any camping trip.
The food served is of the best, as is
all the camp equipment furnished by
the government.
