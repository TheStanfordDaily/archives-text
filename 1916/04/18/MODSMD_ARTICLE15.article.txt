# What Will You Do— With Football?
## 
### 
The issue is up to Stanford students
to decide in the very near future what
they will do with football next year.
Three weeks remain this semester for
discussion of the biggest question of
athletic policy. There will be 110 time
next fall, before training season
starts, to decide this problem.
There are undoubtedly a few stu
dents on the campus who want to
play American football for American
football's sake. There are many who
want to play the old game because
they think it expedient, and many
others, probably a majority of those
who have made up their minds at all,
who are for sticking by Rugby through
thick and thin.
It's up to the remainder of those
students interested in any way in ath
letics to find out what they believe is
the proper solution of the football
question. Dr. Wilbur has stated his
position in an interview published
today. He believes in Rugby football
—that it is the best game for Stan
ford. And he gives reasons why Stan
ford cannot play American football
with California as the game is now
being played.
But the question of what Stanford
students want to do with the football
question remains—whether they want
to see American football played even
if it can lie done under proper con
ditions and with justice to other
schools to whom Stanford owes some
thing.
