# Double Plays

### 
Strange to say, last Saturday's nine
inning game furnished more excite
ment for the fans than the fourteen
frame struggle on the Berkeley dia
mond a week ago Saturday. Better
baseball was dished out in the extra
inning affair, but the bleachers soon
tired of a "one-two-three" game. The
bugs like lots of hitting and plenty
of men on the bases, no matter how
they get there.
—o —
Hoever pitched a better game than
Dimmock in many respects. He al
lowed the heavy hitting Berkeley team
but four hits, one of those being of
doubtful order, while the Cardinals
obtained six from the offerings of the
California southpaw. It is true that
Dimmock twirled a two-hit game until
the ninth inning, but all the frames
count in the box score, so his weak
ening went neainst him Hoever
walked six men to Dimmock's three,
but three of these free transporta
tions were given on purpose by the
big hurler.
—o —
Wickersham hurt his foot early Sat
urday morning, not allowing anyone
to know about it until after the game.
"Doc" Reynolds says that it will be
all healed by next Saturday.
—o —
Hayes' injured arm is on the im
provement list. "Doc" will be able to
hold down first in the final game in
excellent form. It was not supposed
that he would be able to grip a bat
last Saturday, but his two-bagger and
history making triple speak for his
batting ability.
