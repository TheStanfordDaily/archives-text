# Varsity Tennis Men Chosen by Captain
## Hahn, Johns, Barber, Hutchinson and Wolford to Play California On Weekend 
### 
Tennis Captain J. S. Hutchinson, '16,
announces today that the following
men will play the team representing
the University of California in the
intercollegiate matches next Friday
and Saturday on the Encina courts:
H. L. Hahn, '16, will play first singles,
probably against Rogers. H. V. Johns,
'18, will play second singles, probably
against Lipman, while Allyn Barber,
'18, will he matched in the third
singles. Hahn and Johns will con
test in the first doubles, the second
doubles being upheld by Hutchinson
and Wolford.
The matches will be played on Fri
day afternoon and on Saturday morn
ing, the best three out of five taking
the series. Stanford has an excellent
chance this season as the Blue and
Gold team lost some of its former
star performers, while the Cardinal
squad is rated stronger than last year.
Hahn and Johns showed up in won
derful form at the Pacific Coast
championships, and Hahn again came
through in the Ojai tournament last
Saturday. The other members of the
team are all players of tested ability,
and should give a good account of
themselves in the annual tournament.
For the first time in intercollegiate
tennis circles, the rival freshmen
squads will get a chance to compete
against each other. The freshmen
tournament will take place at the
same time as the varsity play, and
should have many spectators, as the
brand of tennis will be of a hinh
order. C. Clover and K. Hawks will
represent Stanford in the first year
matches of single play, and together
will form the doubles team. They are
both fast players of plenty of tourna
ment experience, and should give Cal
ifornia a hard fight for the racquet
honors.
