# Colonel Fairweather at Last Comes to His Own in the Land of Everlasting Sunshine
## 
### 
When white-haired little Colonel
Fairweather, who came to California
with an ox-team, a half-century ago,
was laid to his final rest in the Alta
Mesa cemetery, this morning, Rev. D.
Charles Gardner paid a high tribute
to the king of all Stanford optimists,
saying: "His was a lowly task, but
he invested that task with dignity, and
we spoke of him as an admirable old
gentleman, a sunny optimist. The
memory of the good man will last
longer than will the gold lettering on
a tombstone; a good name is more to
be desired than riches."
The volunteer fund to aid John
Stacy has now reached the hundred
dollar mark. From the girls of Miss
Marker's school came $30; from Miss
Minna Stillman of Stanford, $10; from
L. Lautersteiner of the Regent, $5,
and from other friends of Col. Fair
weather amounts varying from twen
ty-five cents to a dollar.
Mrs. A. Hunt of 3 Salvatierra street
is ready to dispense any sum up to
this amount that will be necessary to
help the Stacy family out of difficulty.
Funeral expenses totalled over $200.
Although the Stacy fund cannot meet
this entire obligation, it will be a
great help to the family, the five
members of which are dependant up
on the daily wages of the son.
