# U.C. POLICY BARS NEW FOOTBALL PACT DR. WILBUR
## COACHING EVILS MUST GO President Says Return to Old Game Would Put Stanford in Mean Position 
### 
"Stanford will not be able to agree
with California in football until a plan
can be adopted that will not bring
back all of the evils of the old regime
abolished by agreement between the
faculties of the two universities in
1905," said President Ray Lyman Wil
bur today.
lietiirn Would Bring Evils.
According to Dr. Wilbur, a return
to the American game, it accompan
ied by the elaborate coaching system
already announced by the University
of California in the public press,
would start with the very weaknesses
and abuses that led the two California
universities to take up Rugby in the
first instance.
"The agreement of 1905 was made
to do away with conditions so serious
oral resentment was felt because of
the methods by which a few men were
picked, trained by highly paid coaches,
and pitted in brute strength against
similar squads from opposing colleges.
"Rugby has proved itself not only
as a game but also as a spectacle. As
a game it brought out large squads of
players and led to more general par
ticipation in athletics both in the uni
versities and the secondary schools.
It was fairly seized upon by the high
schools and from them a fine grade
of natural player was being developed.
As a spectacle it attracted capacity
crowds and the greatest of interest.
"Stanford cannot enter into an
agreement that means competition in
the amount of money that can be spent
for coaches. There is also the feel
ing, which may be unjustified, that
the recent dealings with the Univer
sity of California have been with a
small group of men interested primar
ily in athletics rather than with the
great body of California students and
alumni. Many at Stanford find it hard
to believe that as fine a game as Rugby
has failed to make good with Cali
fornia.
"No other local athletic event can
approach in public interest a football
contest between Stanford and the Uni
versity of California particularly be
cause of the geographical conditions.
Stanford should stand pat. It can
readily maintain all of its athletic
sports on a reasonable basis regard
less of football. It has obligations to
many schools and to Santa Clara. It
is right in its attitude and is standing
for good ideals in intercollegiate
sport. Time will soon show again the
evils of a coach's game. A little pa
tience is needed to give the situation
time to work itself out. Of course It
is ridiculous to think that California
can force Stanford to abandon any
course that it deems right. We cer
tainly will not agree to any arrange
ment whereby it is dictated to us
what we will do in athletics."
Would Consider American.
When asked what stand he would
take on the Rugby-American question
were the students to decide that they
favored American to Rugby, Dr. Wil
bur stated that he could not say. In
case such a situation arises he would
discuss it thoroughly with the Athletic-
Advisory Hoard before making his de
cision. In any case, at either univer
sity, ultimate power rests with the
faculties and presidents.
