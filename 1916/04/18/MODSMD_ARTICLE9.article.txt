# VARSITY AND AGNEWS SCHEDULED
## Speedy Contest Expected in Final Midweek Game 
### 
In the last practice of the
lint; season, the Stanford varsity base
ball team will line up against the
Agnew State Hospital nine on the
hospital diamond tomorrow after
noon. The contest will be staged
promptly at 4:15, and should develop
as good mid-week baseball as has
been seen on the Agnew's field this
year. Tomorrow's contest 110 doubt
will offer final opportunity for Coach
McCarthy and Captain Dent to discover
any eleventh hour weakness in either
the batting order or team play of the
Cardinal nine.
Will lie Fifth Meeting.
Stanford and the hospital aggrega
tion have lined up against each other
four times during the course of the
season, victory going to the locals on
but one occasion, an eleven inning
affair. The Agnews nine is rated as
being one of the strongest amateur

teams on the coast, their lineup com
posed of Esola, Hargis, McGregor,
Lackey, Lynn, Cress, Koehn, Kohner,
Draper and Lamarra, being noted for
its offensive strength. Koehn, a for
mer Western League pitcher, is a
splendid left liander, and should give
the Cardinal batters good practice
against this style of twirling.
Final Lineup To He Used.
Captain "Babe" Dent and Coach
| Jack McCarthy will send the same
team that will oppose California in
the final game into the contest to
morrow, excepting "Doc" Hayes, whose
hand is not in the best of shape.
Braden will in all probability hold
down first base. The pitching selec
tion has not been determined, but it
will likely be either "Ave" Howe or
Bert Mattel. Dent will catch, Stafford
will be at second, Stevens at short,
and Hensel at third, while the outfield
will be composed of Bihlman, San
born, Lander and Noonan.
