# P.A.A. CHAMPIONSHIPS WILL BRING OUT TRACK STARS
## STANFORD ENTERS FULL TEAM Meet on California Oval Starts at 12:30 to Allow For Baseball Game 
### 
Pacific Athletic Association cham
pionships in track and field events
will he held on the California oval
next Saturday, with Stanford, Cali
fornia, Olympic Club and Caledonian
Club represented by picked teams.
The first event, the hammer throw,
will start promptly at 12:30, and the
track events will start soon after so
that the meet will be over when the
Stanford-California baseball game
starts.
A full team has been entered by
both Stanford and California. At the
present time freshmen will not be
eligible to compete on Saturday but
this clause may be rescinded tonight
at a meeting of the association.
Stanford Doped to Win.
Stanford, with Murray, Norton, Aup
perle, Wilson, Lynn, Chapman, Lach
mund, Caugliey, Sisson, and possibly
House, besides others, will present a
formidable aggregation, and should
win the meet. California will be
strong in the field events with such
men as Maker, Nichols, Gildersleeve,
and Liversedge.
The Olympic Club will enter a
string of champions who should cut a
big figure in the meet. Frank Slo
man, the phenomenal quarter-miler,
will undoubtedly be pressed closely
by Lynn of Stanford, and will have
to do under :50 to win if Lynn runs
to the form ho displayed Saturday.
Oliver Millard, Carl C.oeppert, and
Bobby Vlught should star in the dis
tances for the Olympic Club. George
Tlorine, who recently announced his
retirement from the high jumping
field, may be seen in the javelin
throw for the Olympic Club.
