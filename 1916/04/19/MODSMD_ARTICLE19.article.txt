# First Meeting
## 
### 
The job before the new Conference
tliis semester is to get into the swing
of things for their work next year.
Tomorrow night's meeting is import
ant because the first steps in getting
things started will be taken at that
time.
Under the new constitution the
work of student government should
run smoother than heretofore, when
the officials of student government are
broken into their work. But there
will necessarily be more new mem
bers of the Conference —men who
have had no experience in student
government—in the organization this
year than heretofore. And the men
who have had experience will have
to accommodate themselves to a new
system.
It is necessary that all this adjust
ing and readjusting be over this se
mester if the Conference is to be
ready to do effective work from the
start next fall. This is one reason
that this first meeting is important.
The Conference will probably nom
inate men for Student Council posi
tions tomorrow night. This Is one
of the most important duties of the
Conference during the entire year and
should not be done without proper
consideration of the qualities and
ability of the men nominated.
