With Friday, April 28, the time, and
Congress Springs the place, the sen
ior picnic promises to he a real pic
nic. As a departure from all previous
senior picnics which have been held

place for the historical get-together,
and offers an afternoon and evening
affair.
Special cars will leave the Book
store at 2:00 and o:00. Congress
Springs is a place of walks and un
explored spots where the class ex
pects to turn loose until (> o'clock. At
that hour the barbecue dinner will be
served. Besides that there is to be
dancing with speeial music of an elec
trical variety.
Holdovers of every class are in
vited, and the 1910 class also ex
tends a hearty invitation to the 1917
women.
Tickets at seventy-five cents apiece
will be on sale in the houses and at
the Bookstore by the end of the week.
