# RIFLE MEN MEET TONIGHT TO DISCUSS NEW RANGE
## 
### 
Stanford Rifle Club members meet
in room 363 this evening to discuss
plans for the new range on the cam
pus and to receive instructions for
the shoot, next Saturday or Sunday
on the Alta Mesa rifle range. The
club lias received eight new rifles
from the United States government
and five thousand rounds of ammu
nition.
The Stanford faculty has acted as
surety for the rifles which have been
received, thus eliminating cost to the
local organization. The Hoard of
Trustees has promised a new range
on the campus, and members will talk
this proposition over tonight. All
men interested in rifle shooting are
invited to the meeting tonight.
