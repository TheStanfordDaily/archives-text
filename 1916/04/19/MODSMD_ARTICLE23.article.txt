# Tribute Paid Dr. Stillman in Alumnus Issue Just Out
## 
### 
"A Prince of Men" is the title of
an excellent tribute to Dr. John Max
son Stillman, vice-president of the
University, by Professor Charles D.
Marx, in the current Stanford Alum
nus, published today.
"Unselfishness is the main trait of
Dr. Stillman," says "Daddy" Marx.
"It is this trait, coupled with tactful
ness, wisdom and an abiding sense
of humor, that has made him a trusted
adviser to the trustees, a wise coun
sellor to our presidents, past and
present, a loyal member of the fac
ulty, a generous department head, an
inspiring teacher and a man beloved
by all."
Dr. Benjamin Ide Wheeler's Found
ers' Day speech is recorded in the
Alumnus, which also contains ac
counts of the Founders' Day festivi
ties, the installation of Henry Suz
zallo, '!)9, as president of the Univer
sity of Washington, the new student
government constitution, the aboli
tion of tubbing, women's athletics at
Stanford, Stanford aid for Belgium,
and the actions of the Board of Trus
tees. The income and expenditure ac
counts and balance sheet of the Uni
versity are published in full.
