# Hettinger Tells of Trip With Ford Peace Party
## Cosmopolitan Club Hears Interesting Talk by Stanford Delegate 
### 
A. J. Hettinger, '16, gave an inter
esting and instructive talk on his trip
with the Ford Peace party, before the
Cosmopolitan Club, on Monday eve
ning, at their semi-monthly meeting.
With accurate descriptions he out
lined the trip as a whole, and told
many amusing details that came up
on shipboard and in the various for
eign cities visited by the party.
In Kirkwall, England, because of
the British fear of contrabrand, the
ship was putin charge of a lieu
tenant of a nearby warship. There
were many neutral ships in the har
bor, besides about fifty submarines
and a number of battleships of the
first class. Five Germans were taken
off the Ford vessel, in addition to the
American mail.
The North Sea had been smooth
during most of the trip, but later froze,
and the party experienced very cold
weather. On Christmas day, there
was much festivity everywhere, and
most of the boats had a Christmas
tree 011 each end.
Hettinger expressed himself as very
much pleased with Stockholm, the
scenery there being very beautiful.
The party spent one week in Sweden,
whpre they accomplished a little in
the undertaking they had set out upon.
The trip as a whole was a failure,
but Hettinger said that he felt con
fident that it had done no harm and
perhaps some good.
