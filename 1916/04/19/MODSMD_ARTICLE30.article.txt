# Cardinal Swimmers Ready For Contest
## 
### 
Owing to the large crowd of spec
tators which is expected to attend
the first intercollegiate swimming
meet tomorrow afternoon at the local
plunge, the public will be admitted
only by the gate in the fence back of
the tank. No one will be allowed to
enter the gymnasium, as formerly.
Women as well as men will be ad
mitted. A nominal admission will be
charged.
The first event, the 50-yard dash,
is scheduled to start promptly at 3:45,
with George Lindsay, who finished
second in this event in the Pacific
Coast championship meet, splashing
for the Blue and Gold against Gold
smith of Stanford. (The Cardinal
should take at least second in this
race). In the 100- and 220-yard races
Ludy Langer, the celebrated Cali
fornia swimmer and American cham
pion middle-distance performer, Is
doped to finish first. In the breast
and back-stroke, Pedley is expected
to win for the Cardinal, though Kid
der of IT. C. may give him a close rub.
Reliiy 31 a.v Decide Meet.
Stanford should take two places in
the plunge for distance, and though
Langer is entered here, the champion
is rot expected to figure. The diving
is uncertain, and the relay, which is
now expected to decide the meet, is
not easily doped, though California's
edge in the dashes would give them
the advantage.
Officials have been selected as fol
lows: Referee, Dr. H. R. Stolz;
clerk of course, C. Davidson; judges
of finish, F. L. Kleeburger, TT. C.; C.
Seawright, IT. C., and A. W. Ponniman,
'19; Judges of diving, D. C. Wise, '18.
and C. Seawright, U. C.; timers, F. S.
Murray, '16, W. Fletcher, sp., and
Harry Maloney; recorders, T. Falk,
'18, and G. K. Howard, '17.
