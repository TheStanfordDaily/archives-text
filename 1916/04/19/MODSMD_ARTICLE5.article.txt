# Balance of Power Will Rest on a Poker Hand
## Partners Agree to Entrust Social Positions and Fortunes to Cards 
### 
One of the strangest means ever
evolved in deciding a business argu
ment was settled upon last night by
C. B. Ncttleton and T. B. Johns of
the Eureka Digestive Pill Co., as the
only solution to the problem as to
which of the two was the brains of
their partnership. At the suggestion
of Attorney T. J. Vanderhold, Nettle
ton and Johns agreed to come to an
understanding by drawing a hand at
poker.
Vanderhold is now drawing up a
tentative agreement, and if he sticks
to the plan outlined last night, the
quarreling partners will come up
against the following:
Depends On Poker Hand.
lie who wins the poker hand shall
be master of the business. The other
is to be his servant for a year. If
either party breaks the contract, he
is to forfeit $f>ooo, and his interest in
the business.
If Vanderhold is ready, Johns and
Nettleton will decide their fate to
night.
