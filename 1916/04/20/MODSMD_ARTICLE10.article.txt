# Women's Sextettes to Meet California
## Four Stanford Teams Will Play at Berkeley Saturday Morning 
### 
Stanford women's basketball squad
will play their big match of the sea
son Saturday morning, when four in
terclass games with the University of
California will be played on the courts
across the bay.
This scheme of four intercollegiate
games instead of one "varsity" con
test, is something entirely new, and
the success of this meet will decide
the fate of intercollegiate games in the
future. If a friendly attitude exists
throughout the tournament the ath
letic committee will look with great
favor on competition in the future.
