# Sophomoric Errors
## 
### 
Error in wording the amendment
voted on last semester seems to be
the explanation of the difficulty the
Sophomores found themselves in to
day, Apparently no one who voted
for the amendment knew that he was
taking away the right of electing the
officers of the year book from the
sophomore class.
An amendment which will clear up
the difficulty, can be placed on the
ballot at the next student body elec
tion, in order to allow sophomores to
elect the Quad officers as soon as pos
sible. The Quad election can be held
on the following day, and the injury
done will not be irreparable, though
it will delay the election two weeks,
and somewhat handicap the work of
the editor and manager.
Tn the action taken by the Execu
tive Committee to submit the amend
ment to change the manner of elect
ing Quad officers to Associated Stu
dents there is no reference to a
change in the qualifications of elec
tors. The action taken was to adopt
the tryout system in vogue at other
institutions, and pertained only to the
persons qualified to run for offices.
Elections for the Blue and Gold staff,
which the executive committee partic
ularly had in mind to follow, are bv
the members of the sophomore class.
But by an error when the amend
ment was worded for the ballot, it
was made to read that the candi
dates nominated by the Quad tryout
board should be voted on by the Asso
ciated Students. The error can be
easily rectified.
