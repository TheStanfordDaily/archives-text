# Sophomore Electors Receive Big Shock
## 
### 
It's great to be a sophomore, in
the words of Shakespeare. Just one
doggone thing after another, as John
Ttunyan said, makes life spicy and
full of surprises. Of all college years
the sophomore's is most replete in in
novations.
This morning 191S thought it would
he groat sport to elect a Quad editor
and manager. So 1918 went to enjoy
rights of suffrage at the polls.
But the polls weren't there! Presi
dent P. R. Wilson, in pursuance of
bis duties to the student body, had
sent the election officials on their
ways.
Here it is for us to laugh. Last
semester when Hie amendment to the
student body constitution providing
for the tr.vout system for editors and
managers was being drafted, some
one playfully inserted "to be voted
on by the Associated Students," after
the clause "Not less than three men
for each office shall be recommended
to he voted on."
Elections Deliulitfiil Surprises.
Yes, elections are delightful sur
prises. This one surprised even the
Executive Committee which author
ized the vote on the amendment. Hap
nily, members view it as a joke, and
it is planned to eliminate the "joker"
at the next student body election.
Then the sophomores maybe can
elect a Quad editor and manager. In
the meantime eight men keep up a
marathon for Quad jobs. Politics are
so delightfully interesting.
