Coach "Husky" Guerena of Stan
ford and Coach Ben Wallis of Califor
nia today announced the lineups of
the crews which will represent the
Cardinal and the Blue and Gold in
the thirteenth annual intercollegiate
regatta on the Oakland estuary, Sat
urday morning. For the first time
in the history of the yearly classic,
both universities will be represented
by four crews, as races for the sec

eights have been added to the usual

Changes In Varsity.
In the announcement of the varsity
eight as made today, there are several

changes made from the order in which

has been changed from number six to
number four, altering positions with
Rogers. Heron has been shifted from
bow to number three in place of
Swarts, while Neuner has been taken
from the second shell and placed in
the bow of the varsity.
Six of the men named on for the
varsity shell are veterans of last
year's record breaking crew. Five of
the men, Maurer, Green, Orme, Jaco

in both the 1915 California race and
the Poughkeepsie race, while Rogers

sat in the shell for the Poughkeepsie
regatta. The two new oarsmen are
Heron and Neuner, both sophomores.
Heron rowed at number four in the
1918 freshman shell, while the present
race will be Neuner's first appearance.
The varsity shell will be guided by
Lyon, who was coxswain of the 191S
freshman crew, and who accompanied
the varsity on the trip to Washington
this season.
The average weight of the varsity
eight is 176 pounds, over two pounds
lighter than that of last year. The
California eight as named by Coach
Wallis will average three pounds lieav
