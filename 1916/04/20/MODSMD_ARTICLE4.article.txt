Coach "Husky" Guerena of Stan
ford and Coach Ben Wallis of Califor
nia today announced the lineups of
the crews which will represent the
Cardinal and the Blue and Gold in
the thirteenth annual intercollegiate
regatta on the Oakland estuary, Sat
urday morning. For the first time
in the history of the yearly classic,
both universities will be represented
by four crews, as races for the sec
ond varsity and second freshmen
eights have been added to the usual
schedule.
Changes In Varsity.
In the announcement of the varsity
eight as made today, there are several

changes made from the order in which
the men rowed in the race with Wash
ington two weeks ago. Captain Orme
has been changed from number six to
number four, altering positions with
Rogers. Heron has been shifted from
bow to number three in place of
Swarts, while Neuner has been taken
from the second shell and placed in
the bow of the varsity.
Six of the men named on for the
varsity shell are veterans of last
year's record breaking crew. Five of
the men, Maurer, Green, Orme, Jaco
mini and Worth, were in the boat
in both the 1915 California race and
the Poughkeepsie race, while Rogers

sat in the shell for the Poughkeepsie
regatta. The two new oarsmen are
Heron and Neuner, both sophomores.
Heron rowed at number four in the
1918 freshman shell, while the present
race will be Neuner's first appearance.
The varsity shell will be guided by
Lyon, who was coxswain of the 191S
freshman crew, and who accompanied
the varsity on the trip to Washington
this season.
The average weight of the varsity
eight is 176 pounds, over two pounds
lighter than that of last year. The
California eight as named by Coach
Wallis will average three pounds lieav
ier to the man than the Stanford
crew. The two boats will be more
nearly equal in weight than has been
the case in years. Last year the
Cardinals outweighed the Blue and
Gold oarsmen by over eight pounds to
the man.
The Stanford first-year eight will
average I(sB—lighter by several pounds
than the 1918 crew. The 1919 Califor
nia "babes" will be six or seven
pounds heavier to the man, being by
far the huskiest freshmen team that
has rowed in a Blue and Gold shell
for years. Both of the "frosli" eights
have shown the necessary "fire" in
their daily practices, and should put
up one of the keenest races of the
four to be seen in Saturday's regatta.
Two New Knees.
For the first time in the history of
the Stanford-California races, the sec
ond varsity and runner-up baby crews
of the two institutions will meet In
laces. The Cardinal second varsit
eight has given the varsity team a
hard run in trial contests, and is
"doped" to give the California second
string men a taste of defeat in the
two-mile pull. The second freshman
eights are regarded as evenly matched.
They will meet in but a one-mile
sprint.
Second String Crews.
The men named for the second
varsity race are K. G. Steinbeck, '18,
stroke; D. Keller, '18, J. H. Russell,
'17, F. P. Andrews, '17, C. R. Swarts,
'18, R. R. Coleman, '18, ,T. N. Jeffers,
'18, E. C. Kester, '17, bow; J. H.
Goodman, '16, coxswain. Those on
the second freshman eight are F. A.
Betts, stroke; W. P. "VVinham, C. H.
Bowling, C. Jaconiini, W. J. Nelson, H.
E. Waite, A. A. Curtice, F. V. Kayser,
how; C. G. Willis, coxswain.
Varsity Kace First.
The first race of the regatta will be
the. three-mile contest between the
two varsity crews, which will be
started promptly at 9:20 on Saturday
morning. The second varsity eights
will follow in a two-mile race. The
second freshmen will row third, while
the first team "babes" will complete
the program with a two-mile race.
Observation trains will be run along
both sides of the channel. Stanford
will have the Western Pacific lines,
and the Californians will see the race
from the Southern Pacific tracks.
This afternoon's workout on the
Redwood estuary was the last prac
tice for the crews at the local train
ing quarters. All four of the teams
will leave for Oakland tomorrow noon,
and will engage in a light workout
over the course of the race in the
afternoon. The shells will be taken
to the scene of the regatta tomorrow
morning.
