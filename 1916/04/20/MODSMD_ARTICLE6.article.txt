# Cardinals Win 6-3 by Rally in Fifth
## Baseball Is Slow, Fort Miley Nine Getting But Three Runs on Seven Hits 
### 
Playing listless baseball, as has
been the case in the last few mid-week
games, the Stanford varsity regist
ered a win over the Fort Miley aggre
gation yesterday afternoon on the
Cardinal diamond by a 6 to 3 score.
A four-run rally in the fifth inning,
assisted by some breaks on two close
plays, gave the home team the game
that had seemed lost in the earlier
stages. Mattei pitched good ball on
the whole, although he was wilder
than usual.
Soldiers Score in First.
The soldiers started off like a sure
winner, scoring tbree runs in the first
frame on a walk, an error, a single
and a long triple by Schram, (he visit
ing first sackor. Stanford was also
strong in thoir half of this spasm,
sending across two markers on two
walks and a triple by Noonan. In the
fifth, the Cardinal scorcd four times
on four walks, two singles, and a bat
tor bit by pitcher.
Cardinals Fail to Hit.
It is worthy of note that the visitors
scored but three times on seven hits,
while the Cardinals made six runs on
four bingles. Another interesting fea
ture was Hensel's ability to get on
the sacks without hitting, walking
four times in as many times at bat.
A fast double play, Stevens to Stafford
to Braden, who filled in for "Doc"
Hayes at first base, was the fielding
feature of the day's play. The box
