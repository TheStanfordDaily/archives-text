# CHAMPIONSHIPS IN BALANCE
## Cardinals Will Meet Blue and Gold Tomorrow in the Final Diamond Struggle 
### 
All eyes of those interested in inter
collegiate baseball will be focused on
the green turf diamond at the Univer
sity of California tomorrow afternoon
when the varsity of that institution
and of Stanford cross willows in the
third and deciding game of the an
nual series. Victory means much to
either team, and considering the two
games played thus far in the big

series as cri
terions, the
brand of the
national pas
time to he dis
played before
the immense
bleachers that
encircle th e
Berkeley field
will not only
be of high
class, but will
possess thrills
to startle the
most conserv
ative fan.

and Stroud an
nounce that
the contest
will be called
promptly at 3
o'clock. Fifty
cents will be

the admission charge, the seats not I
being reserved, and the tickets being
obtained at the gate. Knell and Mos
kinian will handle the indicators, and
considering their reputations as
"umps," should get away in excellent
style.
Captain Dent and Coach Jack Mc-
Carthy announced the lineup today.
The only change from the team that
faced the Hlue and Cold last Satur
day is in left field. Hihlman replacing
Sanborn. The pitching selection is

also a mystery so far, either Iloever
or Wickersham being in condition to
send against the hard hitting
"Bruins." Captain Dent will of
course hold down the log, while "Doc"
Hayes, having nearly recovered from
his injury, will cover the niitial cush
ion. The remainder of the infield
will line up with Stafford at second,
Stevens at short and Hensel covering

third. The
outfield will he

Bihlman, Lan

Braden, San

Mat te i and
Campbell will
occupy bench
positions ready
to go in the
game at any
needed time.
When asked
his opinion of
the prospects
of a victory
Saturday, Cap
tain Dent had
the following
to say: "I be-

lievc that we ar.e justified in think
ing that Stanford will win the final
and deciding game. The team is in
excellent shape now, all the injured
players coming around to form. The
practices lately have shown that the
nine is going great, and I do not
think there is a doubt but that we
will hit much harder than in the first
two contests. We are well fortified
with pitchers, and after that ninth
inning rally, the men have gained

confidence, a necessary factor in win
ning ball games."
Coach Jack McCarthy is very opti
mistic as to the chances of a win
ner in the big contest. "The team
lias been one of the heaviest hitting
teams that Stanford lias ever had in
the prtctice games throughout the
seat-on, and I am unable to under
stand the lack of slugging in the two
games with Berkeley so far. i be
lieve that the team will hit in the
final game and hits win ball games.
The opposing nine is not a bit better
than the Cardinal ball team, and with
any of the breaks coming our way,
1 predict a victory Saturday."
Cliff Ireland To Me There.
Cliff Ireland, who brought so much
luck in the second game, will again
sit on the Stanford bench. The nine
innings last Saturday was the first in
tercollegiate contest that the well
known manager of the "Ireland's In
dependents" has ever seen. He was
very enthusiastic and claims that his
presence 011 the bench brought the
needed victory. Cliff Ireland has done
a great deal for college baseball, and
the team feels the interest that the
old veteran takes in their welfare.
Ciilifornia Crippled.
Coach Carl Zamlock of the Califor
nia team, has not definitely an
nounced the lineup of the Blue and
Gold squad. Many doubt whether he
will again send Dimmock to the
mound, but a pitcher that goes twen
ty-two innings with but two hits be
ing obtained from his offerings, <is
generally considered good enough to
pitch in any college contest. How
ever, Zamlock has two other good box
artists in McCabe and Holme. C.im
ble may replace Furlong in the
catcher's position, while some change
will have to he made to fill the third
base position, vacated by Smith's in
jury. Otherwise, the lineup will be
the same as that of last Saturday. As
Billy Jordan would say, "Let-er-go,
and may the best team win."
