# CHAMPIONSHIPS IN BALANCE
## Cardinals Will Meet Blue and Gold Tomorrow in the Final Diamond Struggle 
### 
All eyes of those interested in inter
collegiate baseball will be focused on
the green turf diamond at the Univer
sity of California tomorrow afternoon
when the varsity of that institution
and of Stanford cross willows in the
third and deciding game of the an
nual series. Victory means much to
either team, and considering the two
games played thus far in the big

series as cri
terions, the
brand of the
national pas
time to he dis
played before
the immense
bleachers that
encircle th e
Berkeley field
will not only
be of high
class, but will
possess thrills
to startle the
most conserv
ative fan.
Graduate Man
agers Behrens
and Stroud an
nounce that
the contest
will be called
promptly at 3
o'clock. Fifty
cents will be

the admission charge, the seats not I
being reserved, and the tickets being
obtained at the gate. Knell and Mos
kinian will handle the indicators, and
considering their reputations as
"umps," should get away in excellent
style.
Captain Dent and Coach Jack Mc-
Carthy announced the lineup today.
The only change from the team that
faced the Hlue and Cold last Satur
day is in left field. Hihlman replacing
Sanborn. The pitching selection is

also a mystery so far, either Iloever
or Wickersham being in condition to
send against the hard hitting
"Bruins." Captain Dent will of
course hold down the log, while "Doc"
Hayes, having nearly recovered from
his injury, will cover the niitial cush
ion. The remainder of the infield
will line up with Stafford at second,
Stevens at short and Hensel covering

third. The
outfield will he
well taken
care of, with
Bihlman, Lan
der and Noon
an acting in
the capacity
of fly chasers.
Braden, San
horn, Howe,
Mat te i and
Campbell will
occupy bench
positions ready
to go in the
game at any
needed time.
When asked
his opinion of
the prospects
of a victory
Saturday, Cap
tain Dent had
the following
to say: "I be-

lievc that we ar.e justified in think
ing that Stanford will win the final
and deciding game. The team is in
excellent shape now, all the injured
players coming around to form. The
practices lately have shown that the
nine is going great, and I do not
think there is a doubt but that we
will hit much harder than in the first
two contests. We are well fortified
with pitchers, and after that ninth
inning rally, the men have gained
