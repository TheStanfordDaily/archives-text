# "â€”Now Act"
## 
### 
"You've heard all there is to be
said. The thing to do now is to act."
The zeal shown by Stanford men
who heard General Woodruff and
Captain Murphy this afternoon evi
denced that they were ready to fol
low the sentiment of President Wil
bur's closing words at the assembly.
They've heard enough to make them
want to act.
Two hundred men are enrolling
every day now for the eastern sum
mer training camps. Of these appli
cants, 00 per cent arc college men.
More than 3,000 college men have al
ready enrolled for the Plattsburg
Camp alone. Against these figures,
Stanford and California together can
boast of having had eight men at
training camps last summer.
Stanford can and will make a bet
ter showing next summer. If the
men at today's assembly will keep
up their enthusiasm and help spread
it over the campus, Stanford can be
represented by companies where it
has only sent individuals before. We
would like to be one of a big group
of men to go to Monterey this sum
mer.
