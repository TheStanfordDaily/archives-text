# Stanford Boxers Break Even With California
## 
### 
Stanford and California split even
in the intercollegiate boxing tourna
ment with three bouts to each team.
Stanford took three of the four gym
nasium events, the tumbling being
postponed to enable the California
men to catch their train.
In the bantamweight class Muller
of California led liritt all the way.
Britt was handicapped by shorter
reach and failed to follow up his
blows, losing several opportunities to
place clean blows.
Koss Stuiies Come-Back.
"Shorty" Ross came back after tem
porary retirement front the ring, and
defeated Spunn, the California light
weight. The first and third rounds
were easily Ross', with the second a
draw.
Flint and Maguire started their
bout very cautiously, neither seeming
very anxious to start anything. At
the end of the third round Flint
seemed to have the edge but the
judges called for another round,
which gave the bout to the California
man.
Wass Defeats Phelps.
Wass was on the offensive all
through his encounter with Phelps,
the latter seeming content to go easy
and cover his face. Wass had the
edge all the way and was given the
decision.
Lytic and Adams Give Rest Rout.
Blown were exchanged frequently
from the opening of the Lvtie-Adams
go and brought more interest from
the fans than any previous mill.
Lytle rushed his opponent time after
time and the Blue and Gold man was
unable to block the shower of blows.
The bout was easily Lytle's.
Heavyweights (Jo Extra Rounds.
From his lightning attack at the
opening of the heavyweight bout
Carey looked like a sure winner over
Lawton of California but after two
rounds the big fellow began to weaken
and at the end of the third round an
extra mill was called for. Again Law
ton had the shade and at the end of
the fifth round Lawton was given the
decision.
In the gymnasium events California
took only the horizontal bar. In all
the events both teams showed some
excellent work and margins either
way were very small. McCollum of
California was the star in these events
being awarded first place by the
judges several times. California men
who competed in gymnasium events
were McCollum, Turner, Snyder, Van
asek, Ferguson; Stanford representa
tives were Knollin, Rakestraw, Stern
and Miwa.
