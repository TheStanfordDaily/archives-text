# Method of Quad Election Up to Executive Committee
## 
### 
Quad candidates will keep on run
ning, for the time being, according to
the present plans. The Executive
Committee will take up the question
of the amendment which arranged for
the election of editors and managers
by the entire student body at. its next
meeting.
The general consensus of opinion
seems to be that members of the
committee did not desire to change the
suffrage in Quad elections. However,
Student Body President Wilson, who
drafted the amendment, understood
and still believes the Quad editor
should be chosen at a general stu
dent body election by all Stanford
voters.
Probably the amendment will be
put up at the student body elections
one week from next Wednesday for
another ballot, and editors and man
agers will be elected following the
student body's decision by ballot.
