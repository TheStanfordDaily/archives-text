# Eight Crews Await Annual Regatta
## Six Poughkeepsie Veterans to Pull Cardinal Oars in Varsity Shell 
### 
With a larger number of veterans
of former contests sitting in the var
sity shell than has been the case for
many years, the Stanford crew of this
season very much resembles that
which brought fame to the Cardinal
last summer. Six of the eight men
who will pull oars in tomorrow's race
sat in the Cardinal shell in the Pough
keepsie regatta last June. Though
the men have been shifted about
somewhat, there is little evidence
that the addition of the new oars
men has weakened the Stanford eight.
Jnconiini's Fourth Season.
G. A. Jacomini, *15, captain of the
191") varsity eight, is the "dean" of

the crew men. Ho was a
member of his class crew
in his freshman year, and
lias rowed in three varsity
races with California.
During his career as an
oarsman he lias pulled an
oar on both sides of the
shell, and has proved
equally as strong for one
as the other. Though he
held down the number
four berth in the shell last
season, he will work at
five in tomorrow's race.

He is the only man on the present
eight who can work on either side of
the boat.
.Minirer At Stroke.
Having served at stroke on his
freshman crew and on last year's

varsity eight, Rix Maur
er, '17, will be relied up
on to set the stroke in
tomorrow's three mile
contest with the Hears.
Manrer had been out for
the freshman crew but a
short time when it was
discovered that he was a
"find" as an oarsman.
Since then he has had
little trouble in holding
down the important po
sition at number eight
The stroke position is

usually one of tlie hardest to fill o!'
the entire team. As a rule, only tried
veterans have been entrusted with this
berth, and Maurer is one of the few
men in make this position while he
was still a sophomore.
t si;if;iiii Orine ai lour.
One of tho most important change:*
in the position of the men is that of
shifting Captain "Chick" Orme from
number six, his regular position for
two seasons, to number four. Coach


Ifix Mini rer.


".lac."
Guerena made this change immediate
ly after the return of the crew from
Seattle, and believes that Orme will
be most valuable just ahead of the
bow three, two of whom are new men.
The present season is Orme's third
on the varsity. He is the only senior
who has been 011 the crew for three
years. Because of his added duties
as captain, Orme was not in his best
condition in the recent Washington
race, and intended for a time to give
up further crew work. During the
last week, however, he has shown
his old form and is now regarded as
one of the strongest men in the shell.
Green Shifted to Seven.
It is commonly stated among crew
men that the stroke and number

seven oarsmen are "half
the crew," for upon these
two men depends the un
ity with which the re
mainder of the- crew work.
Consequently, 11 u 111 be r
seven was the hardest po
sition to fill this season,
when it was found that
McEuen would be ineli
gible for the team. The
difficulty was finally
solved by shifting W. A.
Green, '16, veteran of last

season, from number three to seven.
Green's absence was long sorely felt
in the bow, but the weakness has
now been overcome. Green was on
his freshman crew, and was a var
sity substitute while a sophomore.
Worth at IfeK'iiiar Kcrtii.
F. N. Worth. '16, will work at num
ber two for his second year. He is

the one veteran among
the bow three, and will
be relied upon to bolster
11 |i any signs of weakness.
Together with Green, he
was a substitute 011 the
1914 varsity, and made the
first team last year. He
captained his freshman
crew, 011 which were
Green and Orme of the
present varsity. The sixth
veteran on the team is L.
,C. Rogers, '17, who went
east as substitute and re
'•placed Hulsman in the

Poiighkeepsie race. He will work at
number six tomorrow.
(. C. Heron, '18, and C. M. Neuner,
'18, are the two new men who have
earned positions on the varsity crew.
Heron has been placed at Green's
former position at number three. He
was a member of last year's fresh
man eight. Neuner will sit in the
bow in tomorrow's race. He is the
only man on the team who has not
heretofore represented Stanford in
either a varsity or freshman contest.
L. S. Lyon, '18, coxswain of last year's
winning freshman crew, will guide the
varsity shell.

.Minirer At Stroke.
Having served at stroke on his
freshman crew and on last year's

varsity eight, Rix Maur

on to set the stroke in
tomorrow's three mile
contest with the Hears.
Manrer had been out for
the freshman crew but a

"find" as an oarsman.

little trouble in holding
down the important po
sition at number eight

usually one of tlie hardest to fill o!'
the entire team. As a rule, only tried
veterans have been entrusted with this

Guerena made this change immediate

The present season is Orme's third
on the varsity. He is the only senior
who has been 011 the crew for three
years. Because of his added duties
as captain, Orme was not in his best
condition in the recent Washington
race, and intended for a time to give
up further crew work. During the
last week, however, he has shown
his old form and is now regarded as
one of the strongest men in the shell.
Green Shifted to Seven.
It is commonly stated among crew
men that the stroke and number

seven oarsmen are "half
the crew," for upon these
two men depends the un

mainder of the- crew work.
Consequently, 11 u 111 be r

when it was found that
McEuen would be ineli

difficulty was finally
solved by shifting W. A.
Green, '16, veteran of last

season, from number three to seven.
Green's absence was long sorely felt
in the bow, but the weakness has
now been overcome. Green was on

With a larger number of veterans

which brought fame to the Cardinal

Guerena made this change immediate
ly after the return of the crew from
Seattle, and believes that Orme will
be most valuable just ahead of the
bow three, two of whom are new men.
The present season is Orme's third
on the varsity. He is the only senior
who has been 011 the crew for three
years. Because of his added duties
as captain, Orme was not in his best
condition in the recent Washington
race, and intended for a time to give
up further crew work. During the
last week, however, he has shown
his old form and is now regarded as
one of the strongest men in the shell.
Green Shifted to Seven.
It is commonly stated among crew
men that the stroke and number

seven oarsmen are "half
the crew," for upon these
two men depends the un
ity with which the re
mainder of the- crew work.
Consequently, 11 u 111 be r
seven was the hardest po
sition to fill this season,
when it was found that
McEuen would be ineli
gible for the team. The
difficulty was finally
solved by shifting W. A.
Green, '16, veteran of last

season, from number three to seven.
Green's absence was long sorely felt
in the bow, but the weakness has
now been overcome. Green was on
his freshman crew, and was a var
sity substitute while a sophomore.
Worth at IfeK'iiiar Kcrtii.
F. N. Worth. '16, will work at num
ber two for his second year. He is

the one veteran among
the bow three, and will
be relied upon to bolster
11 |i any signs of weakness.
Together with Green, he
was a substitute 011 the
1914 varsity, and made the
first team last year. He
captained his freshman
crew, 011 which were
Green and Orme of the
present varsity. The sixth
veteran on the team is L.
,C. Rogers, '17, who went
east as substitute and re
'•placed Hulsman in the

Poiighkeepsie race. He will work at
number six tomorrow.
(. C. Heron, '18, and C. M. Neuner,
'18, are the two new men who have
earned positions on the varsity crew.
Heron has been placed at Green's
former position at number three. He
was a member of last year's fresh
man eight. Neuner will sit in the
bow in tomorrow's race. He is the
only man on the team who has not
heretofore represented Stanford in
either a varsity or freshman contest.
L. S. Lyon, '18, coxswain of last year's
winning freshman crew, will guide the
varsity shell.

>Y. A. Green.
With a larger number of veterans
of former contests sitting in the var
sity shell than has been the case for
many years, the Stanford crew of this
season very much resembles that
which brought fame to the Cardinal
last summer. Six of the eight men
who will pull oars in tomorrow's race
sat in the Cardinal shell in the Pough
keepsie regatta last June. Though
the men have been shifted about
somewhat, there is little evidence
that the addition of the new oars
men has weakened the Stanford eight.
Jnconiini's Fourth Season.
G. A. Jacomini, *15, captain of the
191") varsity eight, is the "dean" of

the crew men. Ho was a
member of his class crew
in his freshman year, and
lias rowed in three varsity
races with California.
During his career as an
oarsman he lias pulled an
oar on both sides of the
shell, and has proved
equally as strong for one
as the other. Though he
held down the number
four berth in the shell last
season, he will work at
five in tomorrow's race.

He is the only man on the present
eight who can work on either side of
the boat.
.Minirer At Stroke.
Having served at stroke on his
freshman crew and on last year's

varsity eight, Rix Maur
er, '17, will be relied up
on to set the stroke in
tomorrow's three mile
contest with the Hears.
Manrer had been out for
the freshman crew but a
short time when it was
discovered that he was a
"find" as an oarsman.
Since then he has had
little trouble in holding
down the important po
sition at number eight
The stroke position is

usually one of tlie hardest to fill o!'
the entire team. As a rule, only tried
veterans have been entrusted with this
berth, and Maurer is one of the few
men in make this position while he
was still a sophomore.
