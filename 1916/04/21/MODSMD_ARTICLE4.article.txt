# Eight Crews Await Annual Regatta
## Six Poughkeepsie Veterans to Pull Cardinal Oars in Varsity Shell 
### 
With a larger number of veterans
of former contests sitting in the var
sity shell than has been the case for
many years, the Stanford crew of this
season very much resembles that
which brought fame to the Cardinal
last summer. Six of the eight men
who will pull oars in tomorrow's race
sat in the Cardinal shell in the Pough
keepsie regatta last June. Though
the men have been shifted about
somewhat, there is little evidence
that the addition of the new oars
men has weakened the Stanford eight.
Jnconiini's Fourth Season.
G. A. Jacomini, *15, captain of the
191") varsity eight, is the "dean" of

the crew men. Ho was a
member of his class crew
in his freshman year, and
lias rowed in three varsity
races with California.
During his career as an
oarsman he lias pulled an
oar on both sides of the
shell, and has proved
equally as strong for one
as the other. Though he
held down the number
four berth in the shell last
season, he will work at
five in tomorrow's race.

He is the only man on the present
eight who can work on either side of
the boat.
.Minirer At Stroke.
Having served at stroke on his
freshman crew and on last year's

varsity eight, Rix Maur
er, '17, will be relied up
on to set the stroke in
tomorrow's three mile
contest with the Hears.
Manrer had been out for
the freshman crew but a
short time when it was
discovered that he was a
"find" as an oarsman.
Since then he has had
little trouble in holding
down the important po
sition at number eight
The stroke position is

usually one of tlie hardest to fill o!'
the entire team. As a rule, only tried
veterans have been entrusted with this
berth, and Maurer is one of the few
men in make this position while he
was still a sophomore.
t si;if;iiii Orine ai lour.
One of tho most important change:*
in the position of the men is that of
shifting Captain "Chick" Orme from
number six, his regular position for
two seasons, to number four. Coach
