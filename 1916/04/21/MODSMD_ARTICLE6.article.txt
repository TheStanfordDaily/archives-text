Coach "Husky" Guerena, "The
little man of the Hudson," who has
controlled the destinies of the Card
inal crow men for the past three
years. As a former Stanford coxs
wain. hi.s work is doubly appre
ciated by tiie students.

With all men in the best of con
dition, the Stanford and California
varsity crews will meet on the Oak
land estuary tomorrow morning for
the thirteenth intercollegiate regatta.
Stanford will enter the race determ
ined to maintain the long list of vic
tories over the Hlue and Gold oars
men, while the California eight is am
bitious and confident of breaking the
run of Cardinal wins.
Confident of Victory.
Captain Orme, who was out of con
dition for the Washington race, is
again at his best. His return to form
has made the entire team confident of

leaving the Cal
fornia crew in
the rear in to
morrow's three
mile race. The
two teams will
l)e fairly evenly
matched as far
as weight goes,
the Bears out
weighing the
Stanford eight
by but three
pounds to the
man. The Stan
ford men aver
age 176 pounds,
while their op
ponents will av
erage 179 lbs.
Second in im
portance in the
day's contests

will be the freshman two mile race.
The California "bates" are touted to
be the best frehman crew that lias
ever represented the State Univer
sity. In addition they outweigh the
Stanford men by six pounds per man,
but it will take more than mere
"beef" to win the first year contest.
Both teams can see nothing but vic
tory.
Both the California and Stanford
second varsity shells will contain
men of varsity caliber. This will be
the first time that the two universi
ties have been represented by second
string eights, and little advantage is
accorded either team. Moth of the
runner-ui) eights have given the var
sity shells hard races in trial runs.
