# MAKES PLEA FOR PREPAREDNESS
## General Woodruff Speaks For Military Camps 
### 
"The summer camps are not in
terded to throw the United States
into militarism." said Mrigadicr Gen
eral Charles A. Woodruff, in making
an i lo(|iient appeal for preparedness
- efore an assembly of Stanford men
this afternoon. "Hut," lie continued,
"it is hoped that they will go a great
way toward correcting the pathetic
need for officers which is now too ap
parent in the United States army.
This is a need which was felt strong
ly din-in*? the lirst year of the Civil
War. and it has not been rectified
since.
"The primary object of these camps
is to educate intelligent men in the
fundamentals of discipline, camp san
itation. orderliness and cleanliness,
and to prepare them to fight the
battles of their country in case war
conies. The personal benefits to be
received are many.

"Aside from the physical and moral
good, there is a broadening influence
in tlie association with men from all
walks of life which is bound to have
a lasting effect on all those who at
tend tiie camps.
Benefit to Country.
"Many think that there will never
be another war. They talk of inter
nationalism and of settling all dis
putes by diplomacy. Hut in the face
of the seven great wars which have
been fought during the past eighteen
years, no reasonable person can
think there is no possibility of future
strife. We should prepare before the
need arrives. I am not an alarmist,
but I believe that war is possible in
the United States.
Chances of War.
"The cloud has been growing
blacker and blacker during the past
few years. There are many things
which might throw this country into
a great war. We have our Monroe
Doctrine to uphold, and there are
also the 'Open Door' in China, and
"Asiatic Exclusion.' In view ot' these,
we should be shamed not to have
raised a single soldier—not to have
bought a single machine gun. We
hear talk of a great volunteer army
growing up over night, but this is im
possible. Even it' we did get a mil
lion men, we would need fifty thous
and officers which it would take at
least six months to train. In this
day and age we would not be given
a week by a foreign enemy."
"There is no necessary connection
between compulsory military training
and militarism. The thread of pre
paredness runs throughout our lives.
Why in the name of humanity should
we not prepare for the most awful
calamity which falls on humanity—
war? Switzerland in 1914 is a good
example that preparedness prevents,
rather than brings on war. We all
appreciate the blessings of peace, and
the length of time it takes to prepare
should stimulate us to do something
at once."
Captain Murphy, in his short talk,
gave some idea of the nature of the
summer camps, and of their work in
training men to command, and of the
need for officers and soldiers.
President Wilbur, in introducing
the speakers, said that he himself
was going to make an effort to attend
the camp at Monterey. He is greatly
interested, as is Dr. Jordan, who ap
proves anything done in a voluntary
way for preparedness.
A telegram just received from New
York states that the total enrollment
to date for the Plattsburg Camp is
3351. Of this number 635 are from
Harvard, 272 from Yale, 269 from
Princeton, 191 from Columbia, 143
from Cornell and 141 from the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania. Other east
ern universities have sent 1700 men.
