# Make It a Big One!
## 
### 
Stanford goes up to Berkeley town
tomorrow to repeat its performance
of last Saturday 011 the campus. And
the chances for a big day look better
now than they did at this time last
Friday afternoon.
We have confidence in the ability of
the Stanford varsity oarsmen to re
peat their performance of the past
seven years and come in ahead of the
Rlue and Gold boat, in spite of Cali
fornia's hopes. The freshmen have a
record of their own to maintain. And
the men who represent Stanford on
the diamond can hold their heads
high after last Saturday's contest.
Here's success.
