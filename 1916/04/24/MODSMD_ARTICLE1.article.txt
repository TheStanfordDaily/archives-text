# CALIFORNIA TAKES DECIDING DIAMOND BATTLE IN ONE OF CLOSEST SERIES PLAYED BY RIVALS
## Dimmock, With Staunch Support, Cinches Victory For Blue and and Gold in Hard Fought Contest Won by 3-2 Score. Crisis Comes in Seventh Inning 
### 
"Dimmy" Dimmock, robust dinger
of the University of California ball
tossers, southpawed his way through
nine innings of national pastime last
Saturday, on the Berkeley turf field,
gaining a 3 to 2 victory over the dia
mond representatives of Stanford, in
the third and deciding baseball game
of the annual "Blue and Gold vs.
Cardinal" series. One thousand rub
ber-lunged Stanford rooters lustily
yelling in competition with some six
thousand supporters of the State Uni
versity, were brought to the frenzy
point on five occasions, when the
smallest sort of a "break" meant vic
tory to the team wearing the cardinal
and white suits. Needless to say,
these same staunch followers were
forced to see promising rallies nipped
in the bud, for at no time did the
ironclad support of the "Bruins"
crack.
Seventh limning Thriller.
Without doubt, the crisis came in
the seventh inning, dubbed by some
misinformed fan as lucky. With the
scoreboard reading as it did at the
close of the struggle, two outs, Stev
ens and Landers on the sacks as a
result of a long double and a walk,
and the reliable "Doc" Hayes at the
plate, enthusiasm ran high among the
bleacher warmers occupying the po
sition directly behind the Stanford
bench. "With two bits already to his
credit, the hero of the ninth inning
rally a week ago on the home lot,
leaned on the third pitched ball, send
ing it well 011 its way toward the left
field bleachers, a three-base swat in
any league. Catcher Bequette of the
Bears, temporarily filling the left
garden, must have distinctly remem
bered the Cardinal first saeker's slug
ging ability, for perched high and dry
in the deepest spot in left-center, he
pulled down the long smash, saving

the contest for California and sending
the Stanford team back, with u des
perate effort to their credit.
Moth Teams Score Karl .v.
Dimmock started off badly, Stanford
chalking up a tally in the lirst frame
on a walk, and two singles by Hayes
and Dent. California evened the
count in its half, however, on a walk,
an overthrow by Hensel, and a single
by that dreaded manipulator of base
bits. R. Rohwer. In the second in
ning Stanford crossed the pan for the
last time on a walk, an out, a batter
bit by a pitched ball, and two singles.
Strange to say, this conglomeration of
baseball resulted in but one marker.
California Evens l'p.
Again, the Mruins evened matters in
their half of the spasm, Vecki coming
across on a walk, a wild heave by
Hoever, and a single by Furlong.
This marked the passing of "Rig Gus,"
who was replaced in the box by Wick
ersham. The star left-hander twirled
nice ball, even though the defeat goes
down in the records as against his
name.
Game Decided In Fifth.
California's winning run was scored
in the fifth on a single by Dimmock,
an out, and a single by Smith, coupled
with a boot by Noonan in right field.
Pinch hitters were again tried by
Coach Jack McCarthy in the eighth
inning, Sanborn coming through with
a single, but California's "thirty-two
Excellent playing on the whole has
featured the three games, and old-time
fans agree that the two nines were
very evenly matched, the breaks of
the game giving the Berkeley players
the hard fought series by a narrow
margin.

"Dimmy" Dimmock, robust dinger
of the University of California ball
tossers, southpawed his way through
nine innings of national pastime last
Saturday, on the Berkeley turf field,
gaining a 3 to 2 victory over the dia
mond representatives of Stanford, in
the third and deciding baseball game
of the annual "Blue and Gold vs.
Cardinal" series. One thousand rub
ber-lunged Stanford rooters lustily
yelling in competition with some six
thousand supporters of the State Uni
versity, were brought to the frenzy
point on five occasions, when the
smallest sort of a "break" meant vic
tory to the team wearing the cardinal
and white suits. Needless to say,
these same staunch followers were
forced to see promising rallies nipped
in the bud, for at no time did the
ironclad support of the "Bruins"
crack.
Seventh limning Thriller.
Without doubt, the crisis came in
the seventh inning, dubbed by some
misinformed fan as lucky. With the
scoreboard reading as it did at the
close of the struggle, two outs, Stev
ens and Landers on the sacks as a
result of a long double and a walk,
and the reliable "Doc" Hayes at the
plate, enthusiasm ran high among the
bleacher warmers occupying the po
sition directly behind the Stanford
bench. "With two bits already to his
credit, the hero of the ninth inning
rally a week ago on the home lot,
leaned on the third pitched ball, send
ing it well 011 its way toward the left
field bleachers, a three-base swat in
any league. Catcher Bequette of the
Bears, temporarily filling the left
garden, must have distinctly remem
bered the Cardinal first saeker's slug
ging ability, for perched high and dry
in the deepest spot in left-center, he
pulled down the long smash, saving

the contest for California and sending
the Stanford team back, with u des
perate effort to their credit.
Moth Teams Score Karl .v.
Dimmock started off badly, Stanford
chalking up a tally in the lirst frame
on a walk, and two singles by Hayes
and Dent. California evened the
count in its half, however, on a walk,
an overthrow by Hensel, and a single
by that dreaded manipulator of base
bits. R. Rohwer. In the second in
ning Stanford crossed the pan for the
last time on a walk, an out, a batter
bit by a pitched ball, and two singles.
Strange to say, this conglomeration of
baseball resulted in but one marker.
California Evens l'p.
Again, the Mruins evened matters in
their half of the spasm, Vecki coming
across on a walk, a wild heave by
Hoever, and a single by Furlong.
This marked the passing of "Rig Gus,"
who was replaced in the box by Wick
ersham. The star left-hander twirled
nice ball, even though the defeat goes
down in the records as against his
name.
Game Decided In Fifth.
California's winning run was scored
in the fifth on a single by Dimmock,
an out, and a single by Smith, coupled
with a boot by Noonan in right field.
Pinch hitters were again tried by
Coach Jack McCarthy in the eighth
inning, Sanborn coming through with
a single, but California's "thirty-two

"Dimmy" Dimmock, robust dinger
of the University of California ball
tossers, southpawed his way through
nine innings of national pastime last
Saturday, on the Berkeley turf field,
gaining a 3 to 2 victory over the dia
mond representatives of Stanford, in
the third and deciding baseball game
of the annual "Blue and Gold vs.
Cardinal" series. One thousand rub
ber-lunged Stanford rooters lustily
yelling in competition with some six
thousand supporters of the State Uni
versity, were brought to the frenzy
point on five occasions, when the
smallest sort of a "break" meant vic
tory to the team wearing the cardinal
and white suits. Needless to say,
these same staunch followers were
forced to see promising rallies nipped
in the bud, for at no time did the
ironclad support of the "Bruins"
crack.
Seventh limning Thriller.
Without doubt, the crisis came in
the seventh inning, dubbed by some
misinformed fan as lucky. With the
scoreboard reading as it did at the
close of the struggle, two outs, Stev
ens and Landers on the sacks as a
result of a long double and a walk,
and the reliable "Doc" Hayes at the
plate, enthusiasm ran high among the
bleacher warmers occupying the po
sition directly behind the Stanford
bench. "With two bits already to his
