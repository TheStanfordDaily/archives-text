# CARDINAL OARSMEN WIN RACE BY TEN LENGTHS
## EIGHT CREWS DIVIDE HONORS AT OAKLAND ESTUARY FRESHMEN LOSE TO BEARS Stanford Varsity "Comes Back" With Fast Time For Three Miles 
### 
Stanford's superiority over Califor
nia in crew was maintained for the
eighth consecutive time when the
Cardinal varsity easily defeated the
Blue and Cold oarsmen in the annual
three-mile regatta 011 Oakland estuary
Saturday morning. Rowing for all
the world like the championship crew
of 1915, and showing no trace of the
weaknesses which startled the Pacific
Coast two weeks ago, when the Uni
versity of Washington administered
defeat, to the wearers of the Cardinal,
the Stanford eight "came back," re
established its reputation, and, inci
dentally, defeated the California oars
men much worse than they them
selves were humbled by the Washing
ton crew. As far as numbers go,
Stanford was forced to share honors
with the Blue and Gold. Though the
Stanford eights had no trouble in out
distancing the varsity and second var
sity crews of California, the fresh
man crews were compelled to accede
victory to their Blue and Gold rivals.
I r . ('. Leads sit Start,
Off to a perfect start, the rival var
sity eights took to the water for the
first three-mile classic promptly at
9:30. Both crews set off with a high
stroke for the first few lengths, but
the Stanford eight promptly lowered
the pace to a regular thirty strokes
per minute and held to the low stroke
throughout the race. The Blue and
Gold oarsmen varied their stroke from
thirty to thirty-six. and because of
their higher stroke had a slight ad
vantage over the Stanford shell at the
half-mile point.
Win lÂ»y Over Ten Lengths.
The high stroke of Coach Wallis's
men, however, was reassuring to the
men in the Stanford shell, for they
knew that the pace could never be
maintained. Without making the
slightest effort to increase their
speed, the Stanford oarsmen gained
on their rivals, leading them by near
ly a boat length at the mile. During
the second mile the lead was increased
to fully four lengths, with the Cali
fornians making a desperate attempt
to avoid the ever-widening gap be
tween the shells. Raising their stroke
to thirty-four in an effort to regain
their loss, the Blue and Gold oarsmen
succeeded only in falling further in
the rear, for the men dropped back
into old rowing habits, entirely lost
their form, and obtained shorter and
shorter runs between pulls. The win
ners. sticking to their regular, uni
form pace, increased their lead by
seven lengths during the final mile,
and crossed the line with a time of If>
minutes and 37 seconds, forty sec
onds, or mathematically, ten and
three-fourths lengths ahead of Cali
fornia.
Fust Time for Course.
Only once has the varsity's time for
the three-mile course been beaten.
And that was last year, when, with
perfect weather conditions, the Stan
ford shell, with five of the same men
who rowed yesterday at the oars,
crossed the line with a record of 1"t
minutes, 42 seconds. The next best
time for the course was that of the
Stanford boat in 1912, when the for
mer mark was lowered to If> minutes.
42 seconds, five seconds slower than
yesterday's time. The race was much
faster than that between Stanford and
