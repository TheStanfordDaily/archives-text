# CARDINAL OARSMEN WIN RACE BY TEN LENGTHS
## EIGHT CREWS DIVIDE HONORS AT OAKLAND ESTUARY FRESHMEN LOSE TO BEARS Stanford Varsity "Comes Back" With Fast Time For Three Miles 
### 
Stanford's superiority over Califor
nia in crew was maintained for the
eighth consecutive time when the
Cardinal varsity easily defeated the
Blue and Cold oarsmen in the annual
three-mile regatta 011 Oakland estuary
Saturday morning. Rowing for all
the world like the championship crew
of 1915, and showing no trace of the
weaknesses which startled the Pacific
Coast two weeks ago, when the Uni
versity of Washington administered
defeat, to the wearers of the Cardinal,
the Stanford eight "came back," re
established its reputation, and, inci
dentally, defeated the California oars
men much worse than they them
selves were humbled by the Washing
ton crew. As far as numbers go,
Stanford was forced to share honors
with the Blue and Gold. Though the
Stanford eights had no trouble in out
distancing the varsity and second var
sity crews of California, the fresh
man crews were compelled to accede
victory to their Blue and Gold rivals.
I r . ('. Leads sit Start,
Off to a perfect start, the rival var
sity eights took to the water for the
first three-mile classic promptly at
9:30. Both crews set off with a high
stroke for the first few lengths, but
the Stanford eight promptly lowered
the pace to a regular thirty strokes
per minute and held to the low stroke
throughout the race. The Blue and
Gold oarsmen varied their stroke from
thirty to thirty-six. and because of
their higher stroke had a slight ad
vantage over the Stanford shell at the
half-mile point.
Win l»y Over Ten Lengths.
The high stroke of Coach Wallis's
men, however, was reassuring to the
men in the Stanford shell, for they
knew that the pace could never be
maintained. Without making the
slightest effort to increase their
speed, the Stanford oarsmen gained
on their rivals, leading them by near
ly a boat length at the mile. During
the second mile the lead was increased
to fully four lengths, with the Cali
fornians making a desperate attempt
to avoid the ever-widening gap be
tween the shells. Raising their stroke
to thirty-four in an effort to regain
their loss, the Blue and Gold oarsmen
succeeded only in falling further in
the rear, for the men dropped back
into old rowing habits, entirely lost
their form, and obtained shorter and
shorter runs between pulls. The win
ners. sticking to their regular, uni
form pace, increased their lead by
seven lengths during the final mile,
and crossed the line with a time of If>
minutes and 37 seconds, forty sec
onds, or mathematically, ten and
three-fourths lengths ahead of Cali
fornia.
Fust Time for Course.
Only once has the varsity's time for
the three-mile course been beaten.
And that was last year, when, with
perfect weather conditions, the Stan
ford shell, with five of the same men
who rowed yesterday at the oars,
crossed the line with a record of 1"t
minutes, 42 seconds. The next best
time for the course was that of the
Stanford boat in 1912, when the for
mer mark was lowered to If> minutes.
42 seconds, five seconds slower than
yesterday's time. The race was much
faster than that between Stanford and
Washington two weeks ago, the win
ner of that contest taking the race in
17 minutes, G seconds. The time
made on Saturday is considered even
more remarkable than last year's rec
ord, as both wind and tide were
against the rowers.
Second Team Knees.
Immediately following the big race
of the day, the two second freshman
teams were started from the mile and
one-half point. The two baby crews
set off at a fast pace, but dropped to
thirty-four strokes before the race
was fairly under way. The Stanford
second-string babes gave way to the
Californians almost immediately, the
latter shell leading by a full length
at the half-mile point. During the
final mile run the Blue and Gold row
ers increased their lead with every
stroke, crossing the line five lengths
ahead of the Stanford boat. No time
was taken on this event as the of
ficials' launch remained at the start
in order to send off the second var
sity crews.
The second Cardinal win for the day
was that of the second varsity shell,
which crossed the finish line far in
the lead of the California runners-up.
The Stanford team was never headed,
and from the time they were sent off
from the two-mile post until they
crossed the line had no other concern
than how great the lead would be.
The California team was weak and
lacked form. At the mile, the win
ners had left their competitors well in
the rear, and gaining steadily, though
rowing at only a thirty stroke, the
Stanford shell crossed the finish fully
eight lengths ahead of California's
second varsity. No time was taken
on this race.
l\ C. Babes ''Come Through."
With their two varsity crews de
feated, California's hopes for evening
up the day's score depended on the
outcome of the freshman race, the
final contest of the regatta. Con
fidence in the Blue and Gold first-year
eight proved well merited, for from
the start to the finish, the more pow
erful California eight had the lead
over the Stanford babes. Starting
from the two-mile post, the Bear
"frosh" jumped into the lead with a
forty stroke. Once there, they low
ered their stroke to thirty-two per
minute, and sticking to the regular
stroke throughout the two-mile sprint
gained steadily over the Stanford
shell, until they crossed the line
seven lengths to the good. The Stan
ford babes rowed in splendid form,
showing more in this respect than
any of the other three losing eights.
The Californians had weight with
them, the men in the California first
year shell averaging six pounds heav
ier to the man. This was the first
defeat that a Stanford freshman crew
has experienced since 1904. Also it
was the lightest baby eight that has
ever represented Stanford, and their
form was unable to overcome the
greater power of the heavy California
team. The time for the race was 14
minutes, 10 seconds, with Stanford 23
seconds behind.
Xo Close lfaces.
Not one of the four races furnished
anything resembling a close contest.
The ease with which the Stanford
varsity eights took their races, was
duplicated by the California freshman
teams. The closest finish of the day
was that of the second freshman
eights, which came in five lengths
apart. The most unequal of the con
tests was that of the two varsiites.
Another curious incident was the fact
that every crew which started in the
outside course was victorious. Ord
inarily the inside course is regarded
as the best., and there is no evidence
that it was not equally as good as
the outer course on Saturday.
Rooters See Regatta.
Moth Stanford and California were
well represented by rooters. A
special train was run out on the West
ern Pacific line for the benefit of the
Stanford students, while the Califor
nia rooters were accommodated by
the Southern Pacific on the other side

of the channel. The trains ran par
allel to the channel for the greater
part of the race, giving the students
an excellent opportunity to see the
contest. in addition, large crowds
gathered on both sides of the estuary
to cheer the rival crews from along
the banks.
Happy over their victory, the Stan
ford crew men keenly regret that
Washington was not on hand for Sat
urday's regatta. Every man on the
team is confident that the victory of
last year would have been duplicated.
The Stanford eight is anxious to clear
the slate of the "fluke" race held in
the north, and will not rest until
Washington has been met on the
Hudson.
Stanford and California each have
more work for their crews. The Blue
and Gold eight will go to Seattle to
meet the Washington crew in May,
and the Cardinals plan to enter the
Poughkeepsie regatta in June. The
Stanford men will break training for
several weeks in order to avoid state
ness, and will resume practice about
the middle of May.
Coach Guerena is enthusiastic over
the crew's work Saturday, and is
more than ever at a loss to explain
the recent defeat. His men in all four
shells stood up well under the strain
and showed themselves to have been
well conditioned. The Stanford coach
is already looking forward to a vic
tory on the Hudson.
Just before the races on Saturday
the freshman eight elected F. L. King,
their stroke, as captain of the team,
and the second varsity eight elected
E. C. Kester, '17, to the captaincy.
