We are glad to be able to congratu
late men like "Skin" Aupperle, Rix
Maurer and "Doc" Hayes on being
chosen to skipper Stanford's 1917 var
sities. In none of the sports could
men have been picked as leaders in
whom Stanford places more con
fidence than in this trio. May we
have more like them.
Saturday was not altogether Stan
ford's day, but there remains much
to be proud of. The cry "On to
Poughkeepsie" can be given with ad
ded fervor since Saturday's race on
the estuary. After that regatta, Stan
ford is anxious to give the men in the
varsity boat another chance at Wash
ington on the Hudson.
Stanford's plucky little freshman
eight was unfortunate in being the
first boat load of babes, for many a
year, who couldn't overcome the Blue
and Gold hopefuls. But they had it
on you, frosh. We haven't seen any
body taking steps to disown you after
the fight you put up.
On the iliamond, Stanford lost to a
better team after giving it one of
the hardest runs that could have been
anticipated for the title. We had
confidence that Stanford would show
a lot in that series, and our faith
remains unshaken.
