California's varsity eight goes north
to race Washington. The Blue and
Gold has a good chance to win, but
for safety first, why not send the
freshmen disguised as upperclassmen?
A bit of ragged rowing would com
plete the disguise.
The A. H. L. B. is being formed on
the campus today. Only those who
lost hard earned seeds on the 1919
crew are eligible to membership. It
is forecasted that the Association of
Hard Luck Bettors will have to be
limited to 1000 to prevent overcrowd
ing.
According to advices from the Cali
fornia camp, the graduate manager
over there is willing to grant, each
man of the Cardinal freshman eight
a dazzling block "C." They are more
than heroes; they are topographical
artists, for .T. Stroud, Esq., says they
put rowing on the map at Berkeley.
A. t. p. on the Cardinal crew train
were a California girl and a Stanford
man. She had a friend in the Berk
eley varsity shell. He had many
friends in the other boat. Both he
and she insisted on watching their
own oarsmen. Their original posi
tion in the center of the train, was
not. satisfactory to this end. So they
separated; he went to the front car.
She walked to the rear! She had
seen other California-Stanford races!
And was wise!
