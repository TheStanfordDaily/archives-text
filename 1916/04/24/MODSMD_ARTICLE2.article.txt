# Real Big Scream Coming Up May 17
## Senior Farce, "A Pair of Sixes," Due at Stanford After a Year on Broadway 
### 
With Buford Williams, '16, and Ed.
Martin, '18, comedians to the core, in
the leading male roles of Edward
Peble's farce-scream, "A Pair of
Sixes," the class of HM6 promises a
treat in the pace-setting presentation
of one of the greatest farces of all
time. Opposite Williams and Martin
will be Florence Cole, 'IS, and Jose
phine Welch, 'IS. labeled as "finds"
by Coach Mathieu for the most im
portant feminine parts in "A Pair of
Sixes."
May 17 is the date, the evening
following the most final examination
of the semester. There will be no
difficulty this year in holding hurried
home-goers long enough to visit the
Assembly Hall to see "A Pair of
Sixes." New York saw this comedy
for over a year—">oo performances—
and then followed a successful season
on the road.
