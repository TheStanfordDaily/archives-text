### 
We've been asked to pass the buck
up to the Student Council in the mat
ter of public initiations. We do —with
a good word for the open air pro
ductions.
Shows, which do not carry with
them the semblance of "poisoned
chestnuts," can be put on in connec
tion with the initiation festivities of
campus organizations. It has been
done.

and can be good clean fun. The in
itiates are underestimating their own
ability to entertain when they believe
they cannot get by with a show of the
right sort. The difficulty lies in this —
that the entertainers believe they have
figured their audience and further be
lieve that the Student Council will
wink at any of their attentions at en
tertainment. The Student Council
can correct this belief.
