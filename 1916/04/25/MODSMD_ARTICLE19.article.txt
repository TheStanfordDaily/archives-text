The following resolution was
adopted by the sophomore class this
afternoon, with the request that it be
printed today in The Daily Palo Alto:
Stanford University,
April 24, 1916.
Whereas, the class of 1918 through
its president requested an investiga
tion of the try-out system as used
preparatory to election of an editor
and a manager of the 1918 Quad, the
following report is made:
1 The Class of 191S feels the re
sponsibility for publication of the 1918
Quad, and holds that the editor and
manager of the 1918 year book should
lie elected by the class of 191S only.
It is with this in mind that the re
mainder of this report is made.
2—(t is recommended that the Quad
Try-out Board consist of the editors
and managers of the two previous
Quads and two sophomores not can
didates for editorship or managership
to be chosen by said editors and man
agers as soon as try-outs begin. At
present two juniors arc members of
the board in addition to the two edi
tors and two managers.
3 —lt is recommended that the
length of try-outs be limited to the
first ten weeks of the spring semester,
and that all candidates work this i'ull
time before becoming entitled to the
nomination of the try-out board, and
that elections l)e by the class on the
next school day after nominations
have been submitted to the class.
I—Tt1 —Tt is recommended that candi
dates be informed clearly on the
points of the try-out system, and that
the work for each candidate be clear
ly outlined to him early in the try-out.
The following points in the present
try-out system are endorsed: Qual
ity of work; quantity of work: orig
inality. The following points are
questioned: Ideas submitted, for the
reason that prospective editors do not
wish to contribute their ideas to the
year book of another class; attitude
toward the system, for the reason that
it is not closely related to qualifica
tions of editors nr managers; general
ability, for the reason that the class
has an equal opportunity to decide
this with the board, which judges by
work submitted, and which may not
call for either executive ability or
great judgment. Tt is recommended
that, these last points be combined
into one and that they count but one
fourth toward nomination.
s—Tt is recommended that not less
than two candidates be eliminated, if
any at all are to be dropped after try
outs.
G—Tt is recommended that expenses
be paid by the Quad when incurred by
try-on tecs, except when commissions
are offered.
7 —Tt is recommended that future
changes in relation to the Quad be put
up to the class next to publish the
year book for discussion before being
made.

endorsed.

next school day after nominations
have been submitted to the class.
I—Tt1 —Tt is recommended that candi
dates be informed clearly on the
points of the try-out system, and that
the work for each candidate be clear
ly outlined to him early in the try-out.
The following points in the present
try-out system are endorsed: Qual
ity of work; quantity of work: orig
inality. The following points are
questioned: Ideas submitted, for the
reason that prospective editors do not
wish to contribute their ideas to the
year book of another class; attitude
toward the system, for the reason that
it is not closely related to qualifica
tions of editors nr managers; general
ability, for the reason that the class
has an equal opportunity to decide
this with the board, which judges by
work submitted, and which may not
call for either executive ability or
great judgment. Tt is recommended
that, these last points be combined
into one and that they count but one
fourth toward nomination.
s—Tt is recommended that not less
than two candidates be eliminated, if
any at all are to be dropped after try
outs.
G—Tt is recommended that expenses
be paid by the Quad when incurred by
try-on tecs, except when commissions
are offered.
7 —Tt is recommended that future
changes in relation to the Quad be put
up to the class next to publish the
year book for discussion before being
made.
8 Otherwise, the present system is
endorsed.
