# SENIOR CAMPAIGN FOR INSURANCE FUND AT AN END
## FINAL EFFORTS TOMORROW Doctor Jordan Endorses Plan to Found Class Fund For University 
### 
With a final effort to obtain the en
dorsement of at least one hundred
members of the 1916 class, the cam
paign to raise funds for the proposed
Senior endowment insurance fund will
be brought to a close tomorrow.
Every fraternity and club will be vis
ited by members of the Insurance
Committee, and every member of the
senior class given an opportunity to
join in the fund. If one hundred of
the present seniors agree to the plan
of pledging $."> per year, policies to
the value of $10,000 may be taken out.
Unless that number of students agree
to assist, no policies will be pur
chased.
Chancellor Favors Plan.
Doctor Jordan stated today that he
is heartily in favor of the insurance
plan as undertaken by the seniors.
"It will be a great help to the Uni
versity if the outgoing classes con
tribute to its maintainence," said the
Chancellor. "In addition such a plan
as that being considered by the sen
iors will tend to keep them in closer
touch with the life of the University.
The insurance method of raising funds
in universities in the east has proved
successful, and 1 see no reason why
it should not be carried out by the
Stanford seniors. I am heartily in
favor of the plan."
Twenty Year Policies.
The present method under consid
eration by the seniors is that the class
take out ten insurance policies, of the
twenty year endowment type, to be
made payable to the Board of Trus
tees. At maturity, those members of
the class who have contributed to the
fund will be called upon to specify
the definite use that is to be made of
the money.
The members of the Insurance Com
mittee will meet on Thursday, after
all seniors have been interviewed,
and will then determine whether or
not the proposed plan can be carried
out. or whether the proposal will have
to be abandoned.
