# SEND TRACK AND CREW EAST
## Campaign Under Way For Necessary Seven Thousand STANFORD TEAMS STRONG, OPINION OF STUDENT BODY LEADERS Behrens, Murray, Bloeser, Orme and Aupperle in Charge of Canvass 
### 
"Back to Poughkeepsie" and "Send
the track team east," are the slogans
of the Executive Committee, Graduate
Manager Behrens, alumni, students,
and everybody connected with Stan
ford. Seven thousand dollars is the
sum needed to pay expenses of Stan
ford's crew and track team this sum
mer. A snappy campaign to raise
that sum is now under way.
That now is the time to send the
track team and crew east if they are
ever to go is the opinion of student
body leaders, who base their decisions
on the fact that both teams are
stronger than any other that, the
Cardinal has sent away from home
in the past.
Every man on or off the Stanford
campus will be given an opportunity
to contribute to either the track or
crew fund or both. A special commit
tee of women will canvass the women
of the University for support. Miss
Anita Allen, '17, has charge of the col
lections from the women.
Leaders of Campaign.
The campaign for funds is in charge
of Graduate Manager Behrens. F. S.
