# A 						Glad Hand-and a Sweet Smile
## 
### 
The campaign's 011. Committeemen,
collector and campaigners will be
around to see every one of you in the
next few days to raise money to "Send
the track team East" and to help the
crew go "Back to Poughkeepsie."
This year if ever, is the year to put
through both of these projects—a
year when both the crew and track
team are sure to make good in a way
that will make you proud to claim
them as representatives of your Uni
versity.
Two dollars from every student in
the University! It is a heavy tax —
but you'll forget all about that if fav
orable returns are spread over the
country when the big events are over.
And it's more than a safe bet that
the returns will be favorable if the
student body gets behind the teams
and sends them away with knowledge
that we're all behind them.
So greet that collector with a glad
hand when he comes around. But
don't tun him away with a sweet
smile. And remember —that all
money raised on benefit productions
will cut down the amount to be
raised by personal subscription.
There are several of them coming up
and you can help out, by being on
hand.
