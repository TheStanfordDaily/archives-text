# Women to Go to Asilomar
## 
### 
Arrangements for the Stanford
delegation to attend the Y. W. C. A.
convention at Asilomar, near Pacific
Grove, this summer, are nearly com
plete. The conference is to last from
August 1 to August 11. Delegates
from Nevada, Arizona and California
will meet at that time.
Expenses are lowered to the great
est possible minimum. A registra
tion fee of five dollars is required,
and $12.50 pays for all of the ex
penses during the ten days. Round
trip railroad fares will he one and
one-third of the regular one-way
rate.
Plenty of fun is offered those who
go and the facilities of the confer
ence grounds for diversion are enor
mous.
