Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: —The Young Women's
Christian Association has noticed
with regret, the growing disregard for
Sunday on the campus. This spirit
has been evidenced by the schedule
of try-outs, dramatic rehearsals, and
committee meetings on that day.
There has also been a tendency to
ward non-church attendance.
This situation was brought to at
tention in an open Y. W. C. A. meet
ing. The meeting voted a protest as
opposed to this.
(Signed) HELEN DENHART.
President of the Y. W. C. A.
