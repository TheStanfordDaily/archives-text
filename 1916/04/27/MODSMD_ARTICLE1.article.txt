# CREW AND TRACK MEN FEAR CORNELL AS CLOSEST RIVAL
## CINDER STARS NOT PICKED Cardinal Eight Gets Second Crack at Washington Oarsmen 
### 
With the track and crew east move
ment in full blast, Cardinal followers
of both sports and outside fans of
intercollegiate sports, are asking what
Stanford athletes can do, and who
will be their principal opponents.
Pledge cards in the finance cam
paign to support the Stanford ath
letes in the east are out, and will be
taken around to houses today or to
morrow.
What the Cardinal warriors can do
in the east is best judged by what
they can do in the west, and what
they liave done in the past. That
Stanford has the best star men in
the west in track is not questioned.
Captain "Feg" Murray is in line for
the world's hurdle honors, having
equalled the best times of former rec
ord holders in both sticks, this year.
The men who set these marks are no
longer competing in the east now,
and there is a strong probability that
the Stanford skipper will stow away
two good places, possibly firsts.
Ten Men (Jo East.
"Skin" Wilson has never run his
best mile yet, according to experts,
and it is likely that under pressure
he will be able to speed past stars of
the east in that event. Rill Sisson is
a good bet in the broad jump, and
Reg Caughey in the shot, as well as
House in the sprints and hurdles,
provided he can go east. It is prob
able that ten track men from Stan
ford will make the team. Tbe rest
of the squad are now unknown quan
tities, with the exception of Johnny
Norton, who is out for low hurdle
marks.
