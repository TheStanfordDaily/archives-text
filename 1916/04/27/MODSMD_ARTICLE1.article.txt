# CREW AND TRACK MEN FEAR CORNELL AS CLOSEST RIVAL
## CINDER STARS NOT PICKED Cardinal Eight Gets Second Crack at Washington Oarsmen 
### 
With the track and crew east move
ment in full blast, Cardinal followers
of both sports and outside fans of
intercollegiate sports, are asking what
Stanford athletes can do, and who
will be their principal opponents.
Pledge cards in the finance cam
paign to support the Stanford ath
letes in the east are out, and will be
taken around to houses today or to
morrow.
What the Cardinal warriors can do
in the east is best judged by what
they can do in the west, and what
they liave done in the past. That
Stanford has the best star men in
the west in track is not questioned.
Captain "Feg" Murray is in line for
the world's hurdle honors, having
equalled the best times of former rec
ord holders in both sticks, this year.
The men who set these marks are no
longer competing in the east now,
and there is a strong probability that
the Stanford skipper will stow away
two good places, possibly firsts.
Ten Men (Jo East.
"Skin" Wilson has never run his
best mile yet, according to experts,
and it is likely that under pressure
he will be able to speed past stars of
the east in that event. Rill Sisson is
a good bet in the broad jump, and
Reg Caughey in the shot, as well as
House in the sprints and hurdles,
provided he can go east. It is prob
able that ten track men from Stan
ford will make the team. Tbe rest
of the squad are now unknown quan
tities, with the exception of Johnny
Norton, who is out for low hurdle
marks.
Coach "Husky" Guerena says that
his huskies are better material for
the Hudson race than any that he has
had for years. Guerena has a good
reputation in the east as "The Little
Man of the Hudson," and it is not
probable that he would care to risk
another regatta at Poughkeepsie, if he
did not have the "wood" on the situa
tion. The local oarsmen are taking
it easy now, in order not to go stale,
but will be ready when the time
comes.
Oddly enough, the greatest rival of
the Cardinal in both sports is un
doubtedly Cornell. Cornell and Penn
sylvania have fought it out on the
oval, and from the looks of things
tho track teams of these two schools
are the best bets in eastern circles.
Everyone knows the race that Cornell
was forced to stage to hold first place
at the Poughkeepsie regatta, and it
is said that Cornell crew men still
shake in their boots when they think
of the spurt that the Cardinal "raw
material" pulled off just a few sec
onds too late for the critical moment.
The local oarsmen will row two
races in one at Poughkeepsie. Ac
cording to a letter received from
Graduate Manager Younger of Wash
ington, the northern huskies are sure
of being back on the Hudson, and the
Cardinals are figuring on the oppor
tunity to come back. Defeating
Washington on the Hudson would be
much more fun than defeating Wash
ington at Seattle.

Reg Caughey in the shot, as well as
House in the sprints and hurdles,
provided he can go east. It is prob
able that ten track men from Stan
ford will make the team. Tbe rest
of the squad are now unknown quan
tities, with the exception of Johnny
Norton, who is out for low hurdle
marks.
Coach "Husky" Guerena says that
his huskies are better material for
the Hudson race than any that he has
had for years. Guerena has a good
reputation in the east as "The Little
Man of the Hudson," and it is not
probable that he would care to risk
another regatta at Poughkeepsie, if he
did not have the "wood" on the situa
tion. The local oarsmen are taking
it easy now, in order not to go stale,
but will be ready when the time
comes.
Oddly enough, the greatest rival of
the Cardinal in both sports is un
doubtedly Cornell. Cornell and Penn
sylvania have fought it out on the
oval, and from the looks of things
tho track teams of these two schools
are the best bets in eastern circles.
Everyone knows the race that Cornell
was forced to stage to hold first place
at the Poughkeepsie regatta, and it
is said that Cornell crew men still
shake in their boots when they think
of the spurt that the Cardinal "raw
material" pulled off just a few sec
onds too late for the critical moment.
The local oarsmen will row two
races in one at Poughkeepsie. Ac
cording to a letter received from
Graduate Manager Younger of Wash
ington, the northern huskies are sure
of being back on the Hudson, and the
Cardinals are figuring on the oppor
tunity to come back. Defeating
Washington on the Hudson would be
much more fun than defeating Wash
ington at Seattle.
With the track and crew east move
ment in full blast, Cardinal followers
of both sports and outside fans of
intercollegiate sports, are asking what
Stanford athletes can do, and who
will be their principal opponents.
Pledge cards in the finance cam
paign to support the Stanford ath
letes in the east are out, and will be
taken around to houses today or to
morrow.
What the Cardinal warriors can do
in the east is best judged by what
they can do in the west, and what
they liave done in the past. That
Stanford has the best star men in
the west in track is not questioned.
Captain "Feg" Murray is in line for
the world's hurdle honors, having
equalled the best times of former rec
ord holders in both sticks, this year.
The men who set these marks are no
longer competing in the east now,
and there is a strong probability that
the Stanford skipper will stow away
two good places, possibly firsts.
Ten Men (Jo East.
"Skin" Wilson has never run his
best mile yet, according to experts,
and it is likely that under pressure
he will be able to speed past stars of
the east in that event. Rill Sisson is
a good bet in the broad jump, and
