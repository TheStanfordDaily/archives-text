# 1917 Quad Rivals Eastern Annuals
## Orders For Year Book Should Be Placed in Advance, Says Manager 
### 
According to W. C. Toland, repre
sentative of the Union Lithograph
Company, by whom this year's "1917
Quad" is being published, the book
bids fair to equal, if not surpass,
tlie annuals of the largest eastern uni
versities. Mr. Toland's work during
past years has brought him in touch
with many of the publications of the
largest eastern and middle western
universities, and his opinion, given out
recently after all the copy had gone
to press, regarding the quality of the
book, should be taken as coming from
a man most capable of judging.
Oiiiiri To He Revelation.
The following was his statement:
"This talk of 'Everybody's Quad' is no
idle slogan. Comparing this year's
Quad with the past issues I have
seen, the 1917 book will be a revela
tion to your student body. The pro
cess used, making a greater number of
half-tones possible, has enabled the
editor and his staff to Include nearly
2000 pictures. In addition to this, per
sonal interest which nearly every stu
dent will have in the Quad, the gen
eral make-up of the book, especially
the art work and pliotgraphs, is high
ly commendable."
Manager 11. L. Hews states that
those wishing a "Quad" should place
their order immediately to insure de
livery. May 5 is the date set for its
distribution.
