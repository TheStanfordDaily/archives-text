# Freshmen East
## 
### 
An explanation is in order in re
gard to the action taken by the Ex
ecutive Committee last night to send
freshmen east to compete in the I. C.
A. A. A. A. meet. Stanford is not
relying on the fiction that first year
men are no longer freshmen a week
or two after commencement in order
to make the 1919 men eligible for
varsity competition in the east. Ad
vices from officials of the association,
state that freshmen are not banned
from participating in the I. C. A. A.
A. A. meet except under certain con
ditions â€”conditions which do not bar
the Cardinal freshmen who are in line
to make the trip.
In a letter to Graduate Manager
Behrens, Romeyn BTry of Cornell, a
member of the advisory council of the
association, states that freshmen are
only barred from the association meet
if they have taken a first, second or
third place in open competition as
representatives of the University be
fore they have registered as students
for one year. All Stanford freshmen
would be barred if they had taken
points iu a varsity contest.
The question of sending freshmen
east was thoroughly threshed out at
the beginning of the semester. It was
decided then to take advantage of no
tenchnicalities arising from the fact
that our commencement comes early
and that members of the 1919 class
would be technically sophomores at
the time of the eastern meet. The
action to send freshmen track men
east was taken only after it was
found that Stanford would be within
the spirit as well as the letter of the
law in entering these athletes. The
freshmen who are under considera
tion for the eastern trip were held
out of the P. A. A. meet last Satur
day in order that they might be eli
gible for the T. C. A. A. A. A. meet if
the Executive Committee should sanc
tion their entering.
