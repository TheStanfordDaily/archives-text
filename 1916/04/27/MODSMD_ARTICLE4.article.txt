# Do Women or Men Cause Majority of Our Troubles?
## 
### 
The wise and haughty of us who be
lieve that women are the cause of
most of the trouble in the world, will
have their views turned topsy-turvy
Wednesday evening, May 17, when the
Senior farce, "A Pair of Sixes," goes
on the boards of the Assembly Hall.
Even though four women will have
important comedy roles in this
scream, "A Pair of Sixes" goes to
show what an awful scrape two men
can inflict upon themselves, their
wives, sweethearts, and friends, T.
Hoggs Johns never did have much
luck in life. Rut when he draws
cards so low, that his partner wins
on a pair of sixes, Roggs can claim
the hard-luck poker medal and get it.
There is one woman, however,
known as Coddles, who almost causes
some laughs and complications to
qualify the first statement in this
story. Coddles (played by Miss Thur
lvne Ruffum, '18, > is a cockney maid
who craves the love of Johns when
be is lowered from business man to
butler, and demands him for a hus
band.
