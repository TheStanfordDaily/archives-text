Up at Berkeley they've adopted a
sloganâ€”"Join the California Company
at Monterey." They're planning on
having an entire company or more of
Californians at the summer camp and
we wish them good luck in their en
terprise.
This may be one place where a
greater number will count, so Cali
fornia will probably have a larger
representation than will Stanford.
But what Stanford does will reflect to
the credit of the University in pro
portion to its magnitude.
The eyes of the nation are on the
colleges and the nation is thinking of
sane preparedness. Any acticity at
Stanford furthering the sane pre
paredness movement will increase the
standing of the University just that
much in the big world outside.
