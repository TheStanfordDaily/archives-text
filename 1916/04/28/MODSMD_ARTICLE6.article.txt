# CARD HURDLERS BEST IN COUNTRY
## 
### 
That Stanford's track athletes who
will enter the intercollegiate cham
pionship meet in Cambridge in June
will be able to hold their own among
the best men of the east is shown by
the records that have been made in
the"I. C. 4A." meets during the past
few years. The 100-yard dash has
been won in 10 seconds for the past
two years. This mark equals that
made by "Feg" Murray in the P. A. A.
meet last Saturday. Twenty-two sec
onds has been fast enough to take
the furlong dash in the last two na
tional contests. In the Stanford-Cali
fornia meet Murray took this event
in:21 3-5. The Stanford captain will
bo able to enter the sprints in the
eastern meet in addition to running
the high hurdles, as the races will lie
distributed over two days.

The best time that has been made
in the high hurdles in the national
meet for the past eight years is
:15 2-5, slower than both Murray and
Johnny Norton have done in the pres
ent season. In the low hurdles, the
tanford entrants will be equally form
idable, with M..1. House and Norton
entered. Norton's time of :24 1-f> and
House's :24 flat will beat that made
for several years in the eastern con
test. Sisson's jump of 23 feet, 9
inches, will entitle him to considera
tion for the national broad jump
title. Caughey in the shot put, Wil
son and Aupperle in the mile, Lynn
and Dievendorff in the 440-yard dash,
Schnell in the half-mile, Wilcox in the
pole vault, and Lachmund and Dykes
in the high jump, are the remaining
men who have chances to represent
Stanford in the eastern classic.
