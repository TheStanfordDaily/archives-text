# STANFORD WOMEN WANTED BY A.C.A.
## 
### 
California Branch of the Associa
tion of Collegiate Alumnae has invited
women to become members of its
(Mul) House Section who fall under
the following groups: Those who
have completed two years' work in
any college where graduates are eli
gible to the A. C. A.: graduates of
colleges which give the A. B. degree;
graduates of professional schools of
A. C. A. standing. The initiation fee
until May 1 is ten dollars.
The purpose of the newly formed
section is to build a San Francisco
club bouse for college women. The
dues are eighteen dollars a year for
resident members, payable semi-an

nually, and ten dollars a year for
non-resident members.
A building under consideration for
this purpose is the former Southern
Club on California street, in San
Francisco. The building contains
fourteen bedrooms, a large reception
room, a library, kitchen, dining room
and banquet hall, and a large porch
which may be used as a tea room.
Five hundred members must be se
cured by May 1, if the plans are to
be completed. This enrollment would
enable the building to be opened to
the graduating classes of Stanford
and California during Commencement
Week.
