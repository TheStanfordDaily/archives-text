VOTERS, ATTENTION
Take note that the lirst 26 names have not been nominated by the Repub
lican party, but are self-nominated for their personal interests; whereas the
second 26 names are the nominees of the Official Regular Republican Con
vention.
As a cold matter of fact, in no other State are there two factions; and if
the first 26 names are elected, they will be given little consideration in the
National Convention. The Republicans of California were virtually debarred
from voting for a Republican nominee at the last Presidential Election, and
became the joke of the Nation. Vote now for the Regular Republican nom
inees, as marked on the ballot below, and recover the lost privilege.
The State of California needs protection to insure its prosperity, and the
Regular Republican Party stands for Protection and Prosperity of the whole
nation first, and the ambitions of individuals are not part of its platform.
Be careful not to vote for more than 26 names, or your ballot will be
thrown out, —there are just 26 names, beginning at Bordwell and ending at
Chapman.
