Professor a. T. Murray will read

sity of Santa Clara.

Rugby, the game to be played in the

suit California.

reported to a student assembly in the
[near future.
I
Open Discussion Expected.
The meeting will be turned over to
open discussion after the reading of
the resolutions. It is hoped that all
will take part.
President Wilbur has not been won
over to the cause of American foot
ball. In a statement given out today
he said: "I am waiting to be con
vinced that the American game is bet
| ter than Rugby, hut no one has been
; able to bring up the necessary proof
!as yet to show me that we should
! give up Rugby for American.
. Danger of Coaching System.
"If American means a return to the
evils of the old system with coaches
that must win games to keep their
positions, then we do not, want Amer
ican. If the students at Stanford are
foolish enough to allow themselves to
be played into the hands of those who
run things, then we will have to step
in and take hold of affairs."
President Wilbur bases his conten
tions on both merits of the games and
expediency. According to him there is
no doubt but that Rugby is a game
much more eminently suited to Stan
ford than is American. Furthermore,
Dr. Wilbur does not feel that the
money involved is sufficient to cause
Stanford to change to American for
the sake of a game with California.
His stand is that two or three years
will find the Cardinal entirely inde
pendent of California so far as finan
ces are concerned.
