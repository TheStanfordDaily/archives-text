# Organized or Honorized?
## 
### 
It has been said that the sole pur
pose of Stanford women in going into
activities is for honor, [112 we deserve
this sentence is it not time that we
take a few minutes for introspection?
If the value of that part of our aca
demic work fails to be of other bene
fit than a dispenser of honors, could
we not find a more simple method of
distributing praise and do away with
these activities which are but the
means to this end?
An activity should be an end In
itself. Our student body has been
called over-organized, though each or
ganization seems to be justified in its
existence. Is it possible that, it is
rather over "honorized?"
If everyone, when asked to under
take a new line of work, should first
question her ability to give it enough
of her time to do herself justice in
affiliating with it, her work would be
of a higher caliber and the value to
herself thereby the greater. To be
sure she might find herself unable to
carry on but one activity, whereas be
fore her name had appeared on the
roll hooks of half a dozen, but her
abiliiY would not have been lessened.
If everyone did only what she could
do well, and left the rest for some
one else to do well, not only the or
ganizations but the individuals would
be benefitted. The honor card might
be less presumptious, but even five
lines after one's name in the Quad
somtimes fails to measure efficiency.
The temporary honor might not be
sung so loudlyâ€”but honor alone never
gets one very far. Let us try to
give our best as far as it will go,
and then stop. "One thing at a time,
and that done well."
