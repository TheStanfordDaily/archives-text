It was erronenously stated in the
minutes of the meeting of the Men's
Conference held last Thursday night,
that the Conference voted to co-oper

making May G "Moving Day," an oc
casion for the return of borrowed ar
ticles 011 the campus. As a matter of
fact, the Men's Conference, after some
discussion, decisively defeated the
Moving Day proposal.
The mistake resulted from the fact
that it was impossible for the secre
tary of the Conference to transcribe
the minutes for The Daily Palo Alto,
and that another member of the Con
ference in undertaking the task,-omit
ted the significant word "not" in
wording the motion.
