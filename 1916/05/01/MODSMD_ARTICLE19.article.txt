### 
1 "The general opportunity for demo
i cratic and individual development in
a University like ours, which is inde
pendent of the state, is unlimited"
said President Wilbur, in a short ad
dress to members of the Freshman
class at their final meeting for this
semester, held today at 1:10, in room
214. "If any of you are out of sym
pathy with Ftniiford iueals and the
policy cf our 1 tudent nody govern
ment, 1 would advise you to trans
fer to some other school during the
summer. Develop a good strong class
spirit, have an organized man to man
struggle with the incoming Freshmen,
and then leave them alone. Eternal
hounding of Freshmen doesn't make
any better men out of them."
Members of the class of '19 voted
to grant numerals to the Freshmen
who played in the tennis meet with
i California last Saturday.
