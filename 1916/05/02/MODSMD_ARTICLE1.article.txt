distributed throughout the student
body, and all members will be given
an opportunity to subscribe to the

the actual work of raising the money
is distributed among a great number
of committees it will not be known
until reports are in Friday just how
much is being contributed by the stu

On Saturday, May 13, the track

Members of the crew which will
race on the Hudson in June are now
resting from their strenuous season,
and will not resume daily training for
several weeks. The men will have
until late in June to prepare for their
Potighkeepsie contest, and would lie in
danger of going "stale" if the period
of continuous training were too pro
longed. Eastern crews are now in the
midst of their season and will be in
their prime at the time of the Pough
keepsie regatta.
