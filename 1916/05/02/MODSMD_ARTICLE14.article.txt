# The 						Arguments
## 
### 
We've heard the arguments pro and
con with the largest possible amount
of open mindedness. We have not
participated in the arguments because
we wanted to remain open-minded.
And we've attempted to make The
Daily Palo Alto a free medium for
communicating ideas on the football
issue. This afternoon we publish a
statement prepared by the American
football enthusiasts. We would have
been glad to publish a similar state
ment by pro-rugby advocates if one
had been prepared.
And after all the arguments are in,
we can see no reason why we should
change from our original position—
That Stanford should play American
football if the student body wants to
because it likes the game, providing
the members of the student body can
conscientiously decide the issue on
that basis alone.
Personally, we like rugby better,
and hope that the Stanford student
body is with us in this, for we want
to see the game retained at Stanford.
If we did not prefer rugby from per
sonal observation, we should serious
ly consider the stacments of men like
Jimmy Lanagan, and Dr. Williams,
before deciding for the American
game. And we believe the student
body is with us in preferring rugby—
most of the men who advocate Ameri
can preface their statements by say
ing they would like to have rugby
continued if it were expedient.
And just at present., in light of all
the existing circumstances, it is the
expedient as well as the right thing to
continue rugby.
Wanting to play rugby, as most of
us do, we could not vote for the
American game with a clear con
science—without feeling that we were
doing something unworthy of Stan
ford. We would be grabbing at a
temporary advantage—immediate com
petition with California—and losing
at the same time permanent advan
tages which we will gain if we stand
out for what is right now. Tn spite
of personal assurances received over
the telephone on solicitation that Cal
ifornia will be good in the future and
cease attempting to dictate things, we
believed that new ultimatums will be
delivered as soon as relations are
resumed and Stanford is back in the
fold again, if we do not stand out
for our rights now. Why not. have
Ihintrs settled once for all?
