To the Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
Tomorrow the Stanford student body
must choose between one of two al
ternatives, to continue to play rugby
with Santa Clara or re-adopt the Amer
ican name, and compete with Califor
nia and other universities in the fall.
In our opinion there is only one ra
tional path to follow—THAT STAN
FORD SHOULD AGAIN TAKE UP
THE OLD GAME.
Return to American football will
afford the adequate competition nrces
sary. Such an action will mean a re
vival of the annual Stanford-Cali
fornia classic which is earnestly de
sired by both institutions. Further
more, games could be secured with the
added universities, Washington, Ore
gon, and Southern California, a con
dition impossible under rugby foot
ball. Thereby Stanford may be as
sured of both a successful preliminary
season and a fitting climax in the big
game. On the other hand, if rugby
be played, Stanford's preliminary sea
son would not only be highly unsatis
factory but ridiculous, while any big
game that might be offered would be
below par.
Enlarged competition afforded by a
return to the old game would again
provide for a satisfactory financial
status, as beyond doubt American
football is tl.e best "box office" game
existing. By moans of sufficient
funds, Stanford crews, track teams,
and oilier teams, would be permitted
to represent the University in the
east. The future financial outlook of
rugby will not permit an even break
011 the year's athletic calendar, de
spite tbe fact that cut-throat economy
must be practiced. Proper develop
ment of our sports demands an in
crease in finances rather than a con
tinual possibility of bankruptcy.
Careful and level-beaded study of
the situation reveals the fact that
there exists not even the slightest
hope of California ever returning to
rugby. Neither do the student body
nor their faculty leaders desire a re
turn to rugby. Furthermore, they
have received the complete sanction
of their faculty.
American football is now a radic
ally different game than that found
objectionable back in 190"), when the
switch was made to rugby. The for
ward pass has been developed, in addi
tion to numerous other favorable
changes. Play has been opened up
to such ail extent that a fast, light
team may hold its own against a
heavier opponent. With the existing
attitude of having a large number of
men sign up for football found at
Stanford, there can be no valid rea
son set forth, why the same condition
would not be possible under American
football.
Objections to the old game have
been raised on the grounds of unsat
isfactory coaching situation. That the
development of a suitable graduate
coaching system is only a matter of
few years is apparent to everyone. By
limiting coaching expenses by mutual
agreement between the two univer
sities, any objection on such grounds
may be removed.
The great mass of Stanford alumni
have shown themselves strongly in
favor of returning to the old game, as
signified by petitions and telegrams
received during the semester. The
alumni associations of Los Angeles,
Portland, Seattle, and Spokane, all
unanimously urge and request that
Stanford adopt American football. By
the press and general public such a
move is desired.
The statement made that California
would demand a 60-40 per cent of the
gate receipts is false. Graduate Man
ager Stroud, and Student Body Presi
dent Street stated over the phone this
morning that they believed a 50-50
division of gate receipts was the only
division possible. An attempt was
made at the close of the meeting to
make this fact plain, but the speaker
was immediately denied.
Hence, as we sincerely believe that
it is for the good of Stanford Univer
sity, we desire to go on stand as
FAVORING THE ADOPTION OF
AMERICAN FOOTBALL, AND TO
REFUSE TO RATIFY THE RESOLU- 1
TIONS SUGGESTING A TWO-YEAR

added universities, Washington, Ore
gon, and Southern California, a con
dition impossible under rugby foot
ball. Thereby Stanford may be as
sured of both a successful preliminary
season and a fitting climax in the big
game. On the other hand, if rugby
be played, Stanford's preliminary sea
son would not only be highly unsatis
factory but ridiculous, while any big
game that might be offered would be
below par.
Enlarged competition afforded by a
return to the old game would again
provide for a satisfactory financial
status, as beyond doubt American
football is tl.e best "box office" game
existing. By moans of sufficient
funds, Stanford crews, track teams,
and oilier teams, would be permitted
to represent the University in the
east. The future financial outlook of
rugby will not permit an even break
011 the year's athletic calendar, de
spite tbe fact that cut-throat economy
must be practiced. Proper develop
ment of our sports demands an in
crease in finances rather than a con
tinual possibility of bankruptcy.
Careful and level-beaded study of
the situation reveals the fact that
there exists not even the slightest
hope of California ever returning to
rugby. Neither do the student body
nor their faculty leaders desire a re
turn to rugby. Furthermore, they
have received the complete sanction
of their faculty.
American football is now a radic
ally different game than that found
objectionable back in 190"), when the
switch was made to rugby. The for
ward pass has been developed, in addi
tion to numerous other favorable
changes. Play has been opened up
to such ail extent that a fast, light
team may hold its own against a
heavier opponent. With the existing
attitude of having a large number of
men sign up for football found at
Stanford, there can be no valid rea
son set forth, why the same condition
would not be possible under American
football.
Objections to the old game have
been raised on the grounds of unsat
isfactory coaching situation. That the
development of a suitable graduate
coaching system is only a matter of
few years is apparent to everyone. By
limiting coaching expenses by mutual
agreement between the two univer
sities, any objection on such grounds
may be removed.
The great mass of Stanford alumni
have shown themselves strongly in
favor of returning to the old game, as
signified by petitions and telegrams
received during the semester. The
alumni associations of Los Angeles,
Portland, Seattle, and Spokane, all
unanimously urge and request that
Stanford adopt American football. By
the press and general public such a
move is desired.
The statement made that California
would demand a 60-40 per cent of the
gate receipts is false. Graduate Man
ager Stroud, and Student Body Presi
dent Street stated over the phone this
morning that they believed a 50-50
division of gate receipts was the only
division possible. An attempt was
made at the close of the meeting to
make this fact plain, but the speaker
was immediately denied.
Hence, as we sincerely believe that
it is for the good of Stanford Univer
