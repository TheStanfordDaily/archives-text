# PARTISANSHIP MARKS ASSEMBLY
## Honor, Expediency and Merit Heatedly Discussed 
### 
Rugby and American football came
in for the soundest partisan and non
partisan drubbing that lias ever been
administered to two sports at Stan
lord, this morning, at the student
body assembly. The verdict of the
student body will be worked out at the
polls tomorrow from 10:15 to 2:30.
Opinion differs as to the results of
the assembly.
Three Issues at Stake.
Briefly, arguments both for rugby
and for American centered on three
issues, Stanford's honor, merits of the
two pigskin games, and expediency,
based largely on financial phases of
the question. All issues were present
ed fairly and squarely, in the frankest
speeches that have been voiced at
Stanford for a long time. Marked en
thusiasm 011 the question led to the
extension of the length of the meeting
to two hours. One thing can cer
tainly be vouched for, that there was
110 railroading of things at this morn
ing's assembly.
I>r. .Murray First Speaker.
P. R. Wilson, '16, president of the
Student Body, who presided, called on
Dr. A. T. Murray as chairman of the
Advisory Athletic Hoard to open the
meeting with presentation of the res
olutions of the board and the Execu
tive Committee. These resolutions
were:
I—That Stanford continue to play
the game of rugby.
2- That an athletic agreement for
two years be made with Santa Clara

University.
■» —That an invitation be extended
to California to meet Stanford in an
intercollegiate game of rugby, either
In the spring or in the fall.
Dr. Murray backed his attitude for
rugby with reasons both of honor of
Stanford and expediency. "It is a
larger question than this or that
game," lie said. "It is a question of
Stanford ideals. I honestly believe
that going back to the old coach
driven game would be the sacrifice of
Stanford honor. Rugby was intro
duced as a game of sport for sport's
sake. The whole system of adopting
a game that is one of hired coaches,
a machine game, is never coming back
to Stanford to stay. We can't go
back on the ideals we have establish
ed for the collegiate world."
Frank English, '01, of San Fran
cisco. was a neutral on the merit
question, but stood for rugby 011 the
honor issue. "California lives in a
feeling that it is only a question of
time until Stanford will be good and
come -to time. They have been say
ing, 'You've got to do what we want
you to do, you've got to come through
and play what we want to play.' We
don't care what the immediate re
sults are; we have never seen an in
stance of Stanford's defeat in the long
run when right. We must sit tight
until we are not being clubbed into
American."
