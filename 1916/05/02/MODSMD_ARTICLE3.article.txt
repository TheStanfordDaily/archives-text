# PARTISANSHIP MARKS ASSEMBLY
## Honor, Expediency and Merit Heatedly Discussed 
### 
Rugby and American football came
in for the soundest partisan and non
partisan drubbing that lias ever been
administered to two sports at Stan
lord, this morning, at the student
body assembly. The verdict of the
student body will be worked out at the
polls tomorrow from 10:15 to 2:30.
Opinion differs as to the results of
the assembly.
Three Issues at Stake.
Briefly, arguments both for rugby
and for American centered on three
issues, Stanford's honor, merits of the
two pigskin games, and expediency,
based largely on financial phases of
the question. All issues were present
ed fairly and squarely, in the frankest
speeches that have been voiced at
Stanford for a long time. Marked en
thusiasm 011 the question led to the
extension of the length of the meeting
to two hours. One thing can cer
tainly be vouched for, that there was
110 railroading of things at this morn
ing's assembly.
I>r. .Murray First Speaker.
P. R. Wilson, '16, president of the
Student Body, who presided, called on
Dr. A. T. Murray as chairman of the
Advisory Athletic Hoard to open the
meeting with presentation of the res
olutions of the board and the Execu
tive Committee. These resolutions
were:
I—That Stanford continue to play
the game of rugby.
2- That an athletic agreement for
two years be made with Santa Clara

University.
■» —That an invitation be extended
to California to meet Stanford in an
intercollegiate game of rugby, either
In the spring or in the fall.
Dr. Murray backed his attitude for
rugby with reasons both of honor of
Stanford and expediency. "It is a
larger question than this or that
game," lie said. "It is a question of
Stanford ideals. I honestly believe
that going back to the old coach
driven game would be the sacrifice of
Stanford honor. Rugby was intro
duced as a game of sport for sport's
sake. The whole system of adopting
a game that is one of hired coaches,
a machine game, is never coming back
to Stanford to stay. We can't go
back on the ideals we have establish
ed for the collegiate world."
Frank English, '01, of San Fran
cisco. was a neutral on the merit
question, but stood for rugby 011 the
honor issue. "California lives in a
feeling that it is only a question of
time until Stanford will be good and
come -to time. They have been say
ing, 'You've got to do what we want
you to do, you've got to come through
and play what we want to play.' We
don't care what the immediate re
sults are; we have never seen an in
stance of Stanford's defeat in the long
run when right. We must sit tight
until we are not being clubbed into
American."
".Mjiimie** Laiin:ruii Favors American.
Coach "Jinimie" Lanagan, who
turned out teams for Stanford both
in the American me and in rugby,
told of the change of American to
rugby football in 1905. Lanagan
spoke warmly for rugby, and"was
astounded that the games could be so
slow." "I firmly believe that rugby
is a better game in every particular."
Lanagan held that the preliminary
games are much stronger in this dis
trict in rugby than in American, be
cause old rugby men can play after
leaving college without continual
training, a feat which Lanagan holds
impossible in American.
Student Discussion Opens.
Following this talk the student body
was called on for discussion. C. M.
Miller, '14, president of the Confer
ence, came out in a strong appeal for
more time to discuss the football is
sue, and for American. The former
request was granted and Miller con
tinued with the second. Miller held
that "Stanford men did not just want
to chase around the field for sport,
but wanted real competition. It is
not a question of principle but pol
icy." Miller believed that talk of
ideals, honor, and principles was in
flated by rugby exponents to win sym
pathy.
Warner Favors American.
ltix Maurer, crew captain, cited
figures to show that Stanford needed
money for athletics, which can come
only from the Big Game with Cali
fornia, and held that California has
nothing to worry about financially,
i Karl Leib, debating coach, continued
j this argument. "1 would be for rugby
jif rugby could exist, but I haven't
I been shown that it can last. The
California student body is a body of
men as clean and straight as anyone.
California will continue to play Amer
ican because the students like it. Fur
thermore, California made money."
Leib's arguments were directed to
overcome the stand of T. L. Smith,
'14, who believed that all major sports
but crew and basketball were self
supporting, contrary to the stand of
Maurer.
Track Captain "Feg" Murray argued
against the American game on the
grounds that changing to it would be
"crawling to California." He was
heartily supported by Dr. T. M. Will
iams of the Advisory Athletic Hoard,
who favored rugby as a cleaner game,
and the honorable game for Stanford
to stand by. Dr. Dr. Williams is an
American player with a record at
Stanford and Columbia, but backed up
his favor to rugby with "I would
rather put up considerable money
than see Stanford men crawl to Cali
fornia."
Johnny Norton, track man, cited
figures to show that coaching costs
California $11,000. "1 would rather
never go east nor put on another track
shoe than crawl to California."
Former rugby captain, Danny Car
roll. held that the old game is good
enough for those who do not know
rugby. The only reason for changing
to American is that we want a game
with California. H. V. Aupperle,
track captain-elect, read telegrams
from alumni in Spokane, Los Angeles,
and in several other cities, expressing
preference for American. He was
followed by A. .J. Hettinger, who held
that "the easiest thing is to stay by
the guns" for rugby, and called on
Stanford to do the hard thing.
Leland Cutler, president of the
Stanford Alumni Association, was
slated to sum up the situation. Cut
ler believed it would be satisfactory
to resume relations with California
under proper conditions. These con
ditions do not exist now, he held.
"There never has been a year when
there have not been demands of Cali
fornia co-incident with rise of Stan
ford personalities." After relating the
story of California-Stanford relations,
Cutler said, speaking for the Stanford
alumni: "We're behind you in any
thing that's right. We do not want
to support a losing proposition, if
you want to go back to American
when it's right, which you can't do
now, we'll support you."
Chancellor Jordan was called upon
to make a few remarks, and he re
plied with his characteristic stand for
rugby. In his travels, Dr. Jordan has
seen several American games, and he
believes it is still a coach's game. Dr.
Jordan ended with an appeal to stand
by Stanford honor, which, he said,
would not be followed by a dearth of
athletes, for Stanford is not catering
to athletics now and lias more than
ever before on her rolls.
