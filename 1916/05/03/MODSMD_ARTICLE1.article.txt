# ALL-YEAR SESSION CONSIDERED
## Honor Point System Extended to All Departments 
### 
That the conduct of classes and
scholarship requirements at Stanford
will undergo a radical change with
in the next two years was indicated
by the recommendations which the
Faculty Executive Committee made to
the Academic Council at their meet
ing yesterday afternoon. The Execu
tive Committee recommended that
some such system be installed here
whereby there should be a continuous
session throughout the year, as is now
in force at the University of Chicago.
While no definite arrangement lias
been perfected the school year con
sisting of twelve months would prob
ably be divided into four sessions, the
students being at liberty to absent
themselves from the University dur
ing any quarter. Such a system would
necessitate the taking of fewer sub
jects and taking them more hours per
week in order that the same amount
of work might be covered.
Saturday Classes.
One step toward more complete
utilization of time for class room w r ork
has been decided upon by the faculty
which will result in freer utilization
of Saturday morning for class room
work. This will also relieve to some
degree the conflicts in the schedule
which have formerly seriously incon
venienced students in arranging their
programs.

In order to allow students having
afternoon classes a little more recrea
tion, all classes will start earlier
than formerly. The first bell will
ring at 8 o'clock and the session
will convene at 8:10, morning classcs
ending at noon. Afternoon sessions
will start at 1:15 instead of 1:40, as
at present, and end at 4:05.
Kcuiilnr Assembly Hour.
The faculty axe has fallen on the
escape from classes on account of as
semblies, a new rule providing that
hereafter all assemblies and student
body meetings shall lie held on Thurs
day at 11:15, no classes being sched
uled at that hour.
If:iisiii<>* Scholarship Requirement*.
The honor point system announced
by the Economics department some
time ago will be extended to all de
partments so that 120 honor points
as well as 120 hours will be necessary
before a degree will be granted. Un
der this system a student will be re
quired not merely to barely pass in a
majority of his courses in order to
remain in the University, but his av
erage will have to be satisfactorily
high. Two honor points per unit will
lie granted for an A, 1 V 2 for a B, 1 for
a C, and none for a D. One grade
point will be subtracted in case of a
condition and IV 2 for a failure. When
a condition is made up the subtracted
honor points will be restored, but no
additional ones will be given regard
less of the grade. Thus a student will
be required to maintain at least a C
average in order to graduate, and
should his average for any semester
fall below this mark hp will in all
probability lie dropped from the Uni
versity.
All these reforms with the exception
of the one providing for four sessions
will be introduced with the beginning
of the fall term.
