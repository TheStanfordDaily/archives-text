of the crew fund. Only those tickets
sold on the campus will be included
.R the benefit, but as all members of
the track and crew fund committee

obtaining them.
Among the films to be shown are
pictures of the Stanford crew men ;it.

pictures of the Stanford-Santa Clara
game. The main feature of the eve
ning will be a five reel comedy
drama, "He Fell In Love With His
Wife," featuring Florence Rockwell.
Price of admission for all seats has
been set at ten cents. Next week a
similar Varsity program will be set
aside for the purpose of boosting the
track team fund.
Two more days remain for the stu
dents to boost the track and crew
funds. Under the direction of Grad
