# Stick by Stanford!
## 
### 
Stanford plays rugby! Though we
wish the resolutions of the Athletic
Advisory Committee might have been
accepted as a whole, since they would
have pointed out a definite course of
action for the Executive Committee
to follow and would have shown con
clusively, to use a much derided but
very applicable phrase, that Stanford
intends to stick by her guns, we are
glad that a majority of Stanford stu
dents want to play rugby next year.
It is unnecessary to ask Stanford
men to stick by Stanford now that this
decision is made. Whatever your per
sonal wish may have been in today's
election, your help will be needed next
fall when the football season starts.
The Stanford student body has voted
to take the hard course, but we can
go through with it and come out on
top if every man gets behind and
helps. "Come back" with all of that
old jazz next fall.
