topped with a football, conducted a
spirited "peerade" up and down the
Row, and to both Roble and Encina
halls last night, halting at the Union
for an enthusiastic rally, and stop
pincr at. a majority of the houses for
a few yells and speeches by prom
inent students. The demonstration
was of an impromptu character to

favored and favored strongly by a
large number of students.
At the Union, between wildest ex
