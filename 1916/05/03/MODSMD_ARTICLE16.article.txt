There's a medal awaiting the man
who lived peaceably through the past
twenty-four hours without hearing, or
asking, the silly question: "HOW
YOU VOTIN'?" And there's a coat of

Hack in Washington, there's one
man that is properly named today.
Tlis name is Tumulty. He works with
Wilson as secretary. His name, if
anything, expresses the state of affairs
in the nation's capital. He could just
as well be here at Stanford. TTis
name would apply.
