# Senior Farce Will Be Entertaining
## Coach Mathieu Pleased by Work of Cast in "Pair of Sixes" Quality Promised 
### 
With rehearsals running smoothly,
"A Pair of Sixes," the whirlwind
Senior Farce, to be presented in the
Stanford Assembly Hall Wednesday,
May 17, should prove a laugh from
the opening lines to the final action.
According to Coach Mathieu, director
of plays on the campus for a number
of years, the 1916 comedy is assured
to register a hit. A continuous round
of light lines meant to produce hys
teria combined with a cast of ex
perienced actors seems to bear out
this statement.
The story that is unwound on the
stage is both unique and comical.
"A Pair of Sixes" differs from the
usual performance given at the As
sembly Hall in the fact that not a
serious thought is expressed during
the evening, but it is merely an op
portunity for good comedians to bring
forth many smiles and guffaws.
Plot Is Funny.
Two business partners are engaged
in the manufacture of pills,—the one
making the inside of the pill, and
the other the outside. In the course
of time a conflict arises as to which
is responsible for the selling quality
of the medicine, both claiming the
honor. In order to settle the dif
ficulty, their lawyers suggest that a
hand of poker be played, the loser
to be his partner's butler for a year.
Such a muddle is the result of the
first act, while the remainder is still
more humorous in character.
According to present indications,
Buford Williams, 'IG, and Miss Jose
phine Welch, '18, should unfold much
merriment, since both of these char
acters are taking to their parts with
unusual skill.
