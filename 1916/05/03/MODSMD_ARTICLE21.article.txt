Next Tuesday is the day on which

lic of Stanford, Palo Alto, San .lose

Seating concessions for the 1916 Sen
ior Farce are going to lie in demand
for the simple reason that "A Pair
of Sixes" is just the sort of show that
people who know will go out of their
way to see.
Coach Mathieu threw up his hands
in despair two weeks ago. Some of
his leading people were rather hope
less. Just the other day lie threw
up his hands again—but for another
reason. His face registered joy—ex-
treme joy—joy to the nth power.
His cast was coming through like a
bat out of Heligoland, putting life,
earnestness and a wealth of under
standing into their lines,. Coach
.Mathieu says that this means the suc
cess of "A Pair of Sixes," which, in
the first place, was a dangerous un
dertaking. "A Pair of Sixes" had to
have Broadway's best. Then it "got
by" like candy in a nursery. Coach
Mathieu was doubtful. Now he is as
sured—that Edward Peble's continu
ous scream lias Stanford's best, and
that "A Pair of Sixes" will "get by
big."
