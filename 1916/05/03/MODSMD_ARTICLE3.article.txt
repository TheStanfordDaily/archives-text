of those in charge of the movement

versities in the east are sending men
to learn the rudiments of army life.
Plattsburg, New York, will be tlie
scene of considerable military activ
ity this summer, with both students
and business men forming several
companies for drill.
l-atest reports place the total stu
dent enrolloment for this camp at

men, Yale has an enlistment of 2712,
Princeton I2f>9, Columbia 191, Cornell
143, the University of Pennsylvania
141, and other eastern universities
1700. California has a good number

of students enlisted for the Monterey
camp.
At Johns Hopkins the university
authorities have decided not to wait
lor government help, but have started
drill within the university, in order
that, in case of war, the students
will not be called to arms as privates
in the rank and file, but as officers.
It is possible that such a step may
be taken at Stanford next year, and
for that reason the students are
urged to attend the camp at Monterey
in order to get an idea of what the
drill is like.
President Wilbur is strongly in
favor of this movement, and stated in
tlie recent assembly at which General
Woodruff spoke, that, lie would make
