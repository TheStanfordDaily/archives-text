# "MORE AND BETTER," QUAD SLOGAN
## 
### 
"More and better of everything,"
might have been taken as the slogan
of the 1917 year book, which goes on
sale on tlie Quad, Friday. In every
department superiority has been at
tained in "Everybody's Quad." More
people will be exposed through the
pictures and "dope" of the Josh de
partment of this year's book than
ever before. Fraternities will come in
for badinage in cartoons. W. J. (lores,
'17. arl editor, lias turned out illus
trations which rank with the highest \
of all previous Quads.
Not only does this year's Quad con
tain more pages than all its red
backed predecessors, but it has more
photos than any former year book.
This has been made possible by the
use of the lithograph process in '

printing the book. Although tliis lias
made th: l!Â»17 Quad more expensive,
the result is worth the cost, and the
price will be the same to the pur
chaser, namely, $2.f>o.
