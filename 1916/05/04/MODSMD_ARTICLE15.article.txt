# Fun—Sans the Sting
## 
### 
1916's Senior Week! Plans for
this big scries of events have been
steadily even if quietly progressing.
Here's hoping there are enough sen
iors—and others —left after ex week
to enjoy it.
Those of you who are leaving Stan
ford for the last time as Stanford
students—and there's bound to be a
difference even if you do come back
for a visit as alumni—had better
postpone that trip "to the old home
town" if you are planning on taking
it the day finals are over. Com
mencement Day is a day you will re
member for a long time if you are
here to help observe it.
And if you're planning to stay over
but "will just hang around to look
things over," here's a hunch—you'll
have a much better time if you're in
on Senior Week and take your part
in every event between the last ex
and the ride home after the Senior
Ball.
Of course Senior Week isn't for
Seniors only. It's Senior Week in a
peculiar sense but the 1916 people
will be glad to share their fun with
the whole campus. It's play-time for
everybody—the only time of year
when you get all of the pleasures
with none of the stings of college life.
Make your date so you'll be sure of
having it—and get in on the fun
early.
