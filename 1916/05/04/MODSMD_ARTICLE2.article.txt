# Lagunita Not to be Drained â€”Hewston
## Charge that Lake Is Nuisance Disproved by Department of Entomology 
### 
Lake Lagunita will not be perman
ently drained.
Farm Superintendent J. E. Hewston
today asserted that to his knowledge
no such move has been planned by
the University authorities. This state
ment will be comforting to those who
have been considerably perturbed by
the insistent rumor that their favor
ite retreat was to be banished for
ever.
In order that pleasure seekers may
not be handicapped by lack of aqua
pura, Superintendent Hewston has
opened the fountain in the middle of
the lake, assuring a sufficient quan
tity of fresh water for canoers and
bathers.
A rumor to the effect that Sears
ville lake would lie turned into
Lagunita to give year-round body of
water, was also declared to be erron
eous.
