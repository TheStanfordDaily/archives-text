Chancellor-Emeritus David Starr
Jordan is sponsor of a new addition
to the moral agencies which are work
ing for European peace. The pur
pose of the movement is expressed by
Dr. Jordan in the following state
ment: "A friend of the undersigned,
a firm believer in tlie possibility and
the necessity of enduring peace
among civilized peoples, one who be
lieves also that the problems of the
world are to be solved by friendly co
operation, not through intimidation
and violence, has caused the prepara
tion of the following appeal. It calls
for co-operation among the different
racial elements in this republic, 'the
land where hatred dies,' as a needed
influence towards lasting peace. *
"He is will aware that no one man
can contribuate much towards this
end; but he believes that a clear
voice from America, besides strength
ening our own faith, may be helpful
and even welcome to the harassed
chancelleries of Europe."
(Signed)
DAVID STARR JORDAN.
This statement is not addressed to
the state department of our govern
ment or to the warring nations but is
merely an expression of the senti
ment of the American people in re
gard to the stock of the warring na
tions and has received liberal en
dorsement wherever circulated.
Many Stanford students and pro

tition and others who care to do so
will find it at the office of Student
Adviser Castle. American citizens
whose immediate ancestors were born
in any of the belligerent nations are
eligible to sign.
