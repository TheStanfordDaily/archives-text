# Prospects Bright for a Winning Nine Next Year
## But Two of This Year's Team Will Be Missing When Roll Is Called Next Spring 
### 
With the passing of the baseball
season the question arises as to the
prospects for a winner in 1917. Will
Stanford come through on the dia
mond or will she bow again to the
superior ability of the University of
California pastimers? A close scrut
iny of the dope sheet gives the Card
inals the brightest hopes that have
flickered Stanford's way in many a
year.
Of the 191G varsity that played the
Berkeley team in the closest and best
series in the past few seasons. Cap
tain "Doc" Hayes will be back to fill
tiie first base position. This in itself
means a lot, as Hayes is one of the
best individual players that the Card
inal has ever had. Of the pitching
staff, Hoever and Mattel will again
return to college. Stafford, Stevens,
and Hensel, will be back in harness,
giving Stanford a veteran infield. In
the outfield, Lander, Noonan, Bihlman
and Sanborn will all be back to chase
the long fly balls. Braden and Camp
bell will again be on hand to handle
the utility berth. Never before has
the Stanford team had so many vet
erans. Captain "Babe" Dent and
twirler "Newt" Wickersham are the
only men that the team will lose.
This in itself is remarkable and in
sures more veterans than were on [
hand at the beginning of this season.
New blood in abundance will be out
to make the veterans hustle. Regard
less of previous service on the var
sity, there will be more than one of
the wearers of the "S" that will be
forced to show more than they have
in the past to keep their jobs. Such
men as Shriver, Messick, Billy,
Cowan, R. Mitchell, E. Mitchell, Ryan,
and Peterson, are ball players of a
superior sort and show by their every
movement on the diamond that they
posess the necessary qualities.
Stanford will undoubtedly be much
strengthened with the squad lining up
as follows: Hoever. Mattei and Peter
son, p.; Lander and E. Mitchell, c.;
Hayes, Ib.; Stafford and Messick, 2b.:
Stevens and Cowan, ss.; Hensel and
Shriver, 3b.; Bihlman, Sanborn, R.
Mitchell, Noonan, Lilly, Braden, and
Ryan, in the outfield.
