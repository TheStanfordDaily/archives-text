# New Book of Stanford Songs Will be Ready in September
## Prize Is Offered Writer of Best Lyric Expressive of Cardinal Spirit 
### 
In response to a popular demand I
which has arisen during the past se-'
mester, it has been decided to issue
a new Stanford Song Hook next fall.
There are many general songs, not
necessarily of the football field, nor
of vituperation and general castiga
tion of Stanford's opponents in' var
ious activities, but songs that are of
Stanford itself, and it is with a view
towards getting these before the pub
lic that the new book is to be pub
lished. A large number of bleacher
songs, however, will be included.
As a result of individual solicita
tion several students have submitted
new songs as well as suggestions of
old ones that might be used, but it is
desired that all students will become
interested in the new publication, and
with that end in view it is asked that
new songs and suggestions be sent
at once either to Yell Leader W. Gil
roy, or W. B. Curtis. Suggestions
mailed during the summer should be
sent to Curtis at the local postoffice.
A suitable prize, the exact nature of
which is not yet determined, is to be
awarded the composers of any song
that meets with especial approval.

All credits made before May 17,
1916, will not be considered in the
grade point system of next year. The
system will be based entirely on new
marks which will make it necessary
for those graduating next May to
have only 30, instead of 120, honor
points.
