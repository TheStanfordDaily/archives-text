# Yes, the Old Grad Returns To the Land of His Love
## 
### 
This is an echo of the Stanford
Quad —the tale that everybody tells,
the tale that rambles on and on, de
claring softly but emphatically, how
the old grad returns to the Farm, ex
tending a warm hand of greeting to
the comrade of yore.
And in the same tale it is told how
the old grad looks with a new inter
est upon the scenes of his bringing
up; discusses ardently upon the ques
tions of the moment, and joins in the
romping play of the college under
grad.
This morning, very early, while the
ground was still shivering under the
dew, an old grad came back. He did
not join the rah-rah chorus. Instead,
immaculately attired (with gloves'),
he set. his sails for the Sigma Kappa
sorority. Fifteen minutes later, Fred
die Foster of Corona was seen walk
ing toward Palo Alto with Whoever
shewas.
The old grad does come back! Oh,
my, yes, indeed! There's a reason!
Lots and lots of reasons! Rut usually
—oh well, what's the use of making
this a personal tale?
