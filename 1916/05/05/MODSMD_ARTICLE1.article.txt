# MANY NOVELTIES IN SENIOR WEEK PROGRAM
## ROW TO BE CARNIVAL "A Pair of Sixes" Will Start Festivities Wednesday Evening 
### 
Senior Week —that time of festivi
ties. queening, engagements, and fare
wells—is almost with us. After that
cramming season has passed, and
ex's are "once-was" memories, the
Senior class always frolics, and the
191 (i people have planned so much for
that occaison that it's doubtful if a
week can hold it all.
"A Pair of Sixes" will open Senior
Week on Wednesday night, when the
curtain of the Assembly Hall will
rise on the newest, most original, of
Senior plays. And then there is the
Carnival. Every bit of novel origin
ality in the 1910 class has been turned
loose on the Carnival, and with all
sorts of concessions—from eats to
noise—the Row bids fair to out-do all
other Carnivals on Thursday, May 18.
H. L. Hahn, '16, has planned shows
for every bit of space from the Delta
Kappa Epsilon house to the postofFice.
Friday rmleroliiss Day.
Friday is Fnderclass Day, when
those of 1916 see their names buried
under that solid plate of stone, in the
square they have thought of as theirs
for four long years. Names are now
being signed in the Registrar's of
fice. A. 11. Morosco will give the
Class Oration, and C. W. Hatch the
History, as parts of the Class Day ex
ercises that afternoon, and at 5
o'clock the Class tree will be planted
in front of the Union with great cere
mony and the reading of the Class
Poem by G. A. Hughes.
Saturday offers much by way of en
tertainment. All Seniors will attend
the Senior-Alumni luncheon at noon
in the Memorial Court, and see "Mov
ing Moralities" afterwards. In the
morning, the teaching staff is plan
ning an exhibition of the national
game that will make the 191G fans
sit up and take notice.
Dr. Francis G. Peabody of Harvard
is to preach the Baccalaureate sermon
on May 21, and then those of 1916
will graduate on Monday. Commence
ment comes all too soon when it
finally does come, and it has a sad
like air which might leave a gloom
over the campus if it were not for
the ball that night. The ball is in
charge of Buford Williams-, and its
perfect planning promises much for
the Senior Week queeners.
Seniors today passed a resolution
that all members of the class wear
cap and gown at the commencement
exercises. A further request was
made at today's meeting that all mem
bers of the 1916 class who have not
paid their dues do so at once. Sen
ior Week programs will be obtainable
at the Registrar's office after Monday.
Leather covered programs will be sold
at thirty-five cents, or three for a
dollar. Commencement Week invita
tions will be five cents each.
Chancellor David Starr Jordan will
give the commencement address this
year. He will review the twenty-five
years of Stanford's history.
