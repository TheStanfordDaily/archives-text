# MANY NOVELTIES IN SENIOR WEEK PROGRAM
## ROW TO BE CARNIVAL "A Pair of Sixes" Will Start Festivities Wednesday Evening 
### 
Senior Week —that time of festivi
ties. queening, engagements, and fare
wells—is almost with us. After that
cramming season has passed, and
ex's are "once-was" memories, the
Senior class always frolics, and the
191 (i people have planned so much for
that occaison that it's doubtful if a
week can hold it all.
"A Pair of Sixes" will open Senior
Week on Wednesday night, when the
curtain of the Assembly Hall will
rise on the newest, most original, of
Senior plays. And then there is the
Carnival. Every bit of novel origin
ality in the 1910 class has been turned
loose on the Carnival, and with all
sorts of concessions—from eats to
noise—the Row bids fair to out-do all
other Carnivals on Thursday, May 18.
H. L. Hahn, '16, has planned shows
for every bit of space from the Delta
Kappa Epsilon house to the postofFice.
Friday rmleroliiss Day.
Friday is Fnderclass Day, when
those of 1916 see their names buried
under that solid plate of stone, in the
square they have thought of as theirs
for four long years. Names are now
being signed in the Registrar's of
fice. A. 11. Morosco will give the
Class Oration, and C. W. Hatch the
History, as parts of the Class Day ex
ercises that afternoon, and at 5
o'clock the Class tree will be planted
