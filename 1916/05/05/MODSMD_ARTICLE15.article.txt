# 1917 QUAD IS STRONG WITH ART
## 
### 
The Quad is out. And it is a Quad
t lux t will rot bo forgot ton tomorrow
nor next year. Perhaps tho first thing
that strikes anyone turning over the
nages rapidly is that hero are more
pictures than have gone into the
making of two Quads in the past.
And they are good pictures, pictures
with a news value, pictures we have
not seen before. Tho lithograph pro

cess which has made this possible
has at times made it necessary to
sacrifice the clearness in some of tho
smaller photos, but this defect is more
than outbalanced by the advantages
of the new method.
Moginning with the title page, W.
.T. (lores has made the art work of
the Quad a feature, worthy of com
ment. The small color plates which
head the main departments are admir
ably done, and give a sense of unity
to the book. The finely decorative
note of the "Honor Societies" and"In
Memoriam" plates strikes a level
above that of the usual line of year
book art. The lirst dozen pages con
tain line work that would make the
book worth while regardless of what
the rest of it might contain.
One of the most decided departures
which R. A. Griffin has made is in the
amount of cutaway work noticeable
in the pictures. This has made it
possible to give the dramatic depart
ment more variety as well as adding
immeasurably to the interest of the
divisions devoted to athletics. The
same method has been used in the in
troduction of snapshots in the senior
honor list and the faculty roll, giving
these two departments an interest
which they have never had before.
All through the book there is the
tendency to put life into the things
which have been hitherto considered
merely formal records. And, more
over, the josh department is good.
All the cloth-bound Quads on sale
this morning were snapped up before
10 o'clock, but two hundred more
will be put on sale tomorrow morn
ing for those who were too late today.
The leather bound volumes at $3.50
are still obtainable.
