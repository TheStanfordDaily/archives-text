# PRESIDENT HOLDS OUT FIRMLY FOR RUGBY GAME
## STATES FINAL STAND American Can Never Return to Stanford, Believes Dr. A.T. Murray 
### 
Stanford's policy will be strictly lor
Rugby in the future, according to
statements of President Ray Lyman
Wilbur and Dr. A. T. Murray, given
out today. President Wilbur's stand
is summed up in the following words:
"The more I consider the recent
discussion in regard to the football
situation, the more evident it becomes
that there is something inherently un
desirable in the so-called American
game as a means of bringing out the
best in sports or in intercollegiate re
lationships. It is too much of a
staged combat to meet modern edu
cational conditions. We found it out
in California years ago and do not
need the lesson again at Stanford.
Stability Stanford Policy.
"In order to simplify, clarify, and
stability the situation it seems de
sirable to announce that following the
unanimous recommendation of the Ad
visory Athletic Hoard, the Executive
Committee of the Associated Students
and the Faculty Athletic Committee,
and the majority vote of the students,
it is the intention of the President of
tlie University to firmly support the
Rugby game as the fnntbn.ll tramp to
be played by Stanford University.
Hope IT.l T . ('. Will Play Rugby.
"I hope that the University of Cali
fornia will play Rugby with us next
year. If not. then at some later per
iod, as soon as they feel it worth
while to add again a game that meets
all of the needs of an intercollegiate
contest. I make this announcement
now so that there need be no question
about Stanford's future course, and so
that we can settle down to develop
our athletics without turmoil and in
our own way."
That American football has been
banished from Stanford for all time
to come is the opinion of Dr. A. T.
Murray, chairman of the Faculty Ath
letic Committee, as expressed in a
statement issued today. Dr. Murray
points out in the statement that there
has been a complete failure to com
prehend the meaning of "Stanford
ideals" and says that sport for sport's
sake and not for business has, and
will continue to be the Stanford ideal
and principle.
Referring to the abandonment of
the old game eleven years ago, Dr.
Murray states in part that "the ob
jection to the American game was
amply well grounded in the fact that
it was a coach's game; it was not
and could not be made a players'
game.
"Those of us who hold to our ideals
in this matter, unblinded by prejudice
or by questions of expediency, do so
while frankly recognizing that to re
linquish the conception of sport indi
cated above, and return to the game
of American football with its attend
ant evils, would mean the Immediate
resumption of full athletic relations
with the University of California, our
natural competitor, with large gate
receipts and "easy money" for financ
ing all branches of sport. To the un
dergraduate mind the project is
tempting. But all of these things and
all other arguments which have been
advanced by those who advocate a
change in our athletic policy were
fully considered by the Advisory Ath
letic Board before its recommenda
tions were made. We hold to our
ideals.

"I hope that the University of Cali
fornia will play Rugby with us next
year. If not. then at some later per
iod, as soon as they feel it worth
while to add again a game that meets
all of the needs of an intercollegiate
contest. I make this announcement
now so that there need be no question
about Stanford's future course, and so
that we can settle down to develop
our athletics without turmoil and in
our own way."
That American football has been
banished from Stanford for all time
to come is the opinion of Dr. A. T.
Murray, chairman of the Faculty Ath
letic Committee, as expressed in a
statement issued today. Dr. Murray
points out in the statement that there
has been a complete failure to com
prehend the meaning of "Stanford
ideals" and says that sport for sport's
sake and not for business has, and
will continue to be the Stanford ideal
and principle.
Referring to the abandonment of
the old game eleven years ago, Dr.
Murray states in part that "the ob
jection to the American game was
amply well grounded in the fact that
it was a coach's game; it was not
and could not be made a players'
game.
"Those of us who hold to our ideals
in this matter, unblinded by prejudice
or by questions of expediency, do so
while frankly recognizing that to re
linquish the conception of sport indi
cated above, and return to the game
of American football with its attend
ant evils, would mean the Immediate
resumption of full athletic relations
with the University of California, our
natural competitor, with large gate
receipts and "easy money" for financ
ing all branches of sport. To the un
dergraduate mind the project is
tempting. But all of these things and
all other arguments which have been
advanced by those who advocate a
change in our athletic policy were
fully considered by the Advisory Ath
letic Board before its recommenda
tions were made. We hold to our
ideals.
The statement of Dr. A. T. Murray,
chairman of the Advisory Athletic
Hoard, in regard to football at Stan
ford, will lie published in full in The
Daily Palo Alto Times of today. Lack
of space prevented publication in The

Stanford's policy will be strictly lor
Rugby in the future, according to
statements of President Ray Lyman
Wilbur and Dr. A. T. Murray, given
out today. President Wilbur's stand
is summed up in the following words:
"The more I consider the recent
discussion in regard to the football
situation, the more evident it becomes
that there is something inherently un
desirable in the so-called American
game as a means of bringing out the
best in sports or in intercollegiate re
lationships. It is too much of a
staged combat to meet modern edu
cational conditions. We found it out
in California years ago and do not
need the lesson again at Stanford.
Stability Stanford Policy.
"In order to simplify, clarify, and
stability the situation it seems de
sirable to announce that following the
unanimous recommendation of the Ad
visory Athletic Hoard, the Executive
Committee of the Associated Students
and the Faculty Athletic Committee,
and the majority vote of the students,
it is the intention of the President of
tlie University to firmly support the
Rugby game as the fnntbn.ll tramp to
be played by Stanford University.
