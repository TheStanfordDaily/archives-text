### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, in
presenting the diplomas and confer
ring degrees at the Commencement
exercises, in the Assembly Hall, this
morning, said:
Life has brought to me the privilege
of living in three homes—that of my
father, my own, and Stanford; the
last claimed me in my teens and has
been mine more or less constantly
ever since. I look upon it with rever
ence and pride and gratitude and loy
alty. You have been members of that
home for four hearty years, and are
to leave it now for new fields and new
endeavors. You cannot escape its in
fluence for it has become a part of
your emotional, spiritual, and intel
lectual being. You can always look
back to it. You must suffer when it
suffers, lie proud when its work is
well done, or when its sous and
daughters render service.
The University has given you a
diploma, not so much as a certificate
of work done as an admission ticket
to new opportunities and to new pos
sibilities. After one has entered, the
ticket of admission is of but little
value. Some usher may disturb you
for it, but only if you get into the
wrong place. Try to see that it is
never asked for. Study yourself; look
for the right place, and begin to work
in it with the joy of work and of
achievement in your soul. The world
is asearch for men. Be one of those
sought, as you can readily be, with
the start given you, if you have in
dustry, courage, unselfiisliness, and
optimism. Happiness will come to
( you in the measure that you render
aid to others or to the great causes
that need advocacy and support . Ac
quire efficiency enough to help others
besides yourselves. Remember your
Stanford home, your Stanford mother.
You are a part of us. We count upon
you for help and guidance and cheer
in our efforts to keep this great Uni
versity a living force in the forefront
of the progress of civilization.
