# Carnival Lanterns Reveal Nickel Crawl
## Mademoiselle Rosini Interrupts Dancing by Demonstration of Terpsichorean Art 
### 
There was a nickel crawl going on
on the spring floor of the Women's
Clubhouse Thursday night, and if
you followed the strings of lights to
the Union there was another there —
but no, according to the raucouu in
formation of the barker, there was
more. Mademoiselle Rosini (or was
it Rosie McCarty?) could be seen in
her mar-rvclous Spanish fandango.
She came and was seen in that and
in a fluffy spring dance to the tune
of the "Blue Danube" and the thud
of her ballet slippers on the gray
rug of the Union.
When she had bowed her way out
for the second time, the patient spec
tators arose and proceeded, thanks to
Dug McLaclilan's fingers, to demon
strate the way the thing should be
done. And everyone was satisfied
that their own dancing was better
than Mademoiselle What's-her-name's.
And when they passed the barker,
.alias Red Mauser, with his mega
phone outside .they wondered just
what he had to bark about. Thero
were no varsity girls, there was «u>
confetti. Peanuts and cones Rave
place to lady-like refreshments served
at tables. It was not a carnival, but
then it was fun. That was the main
point.
