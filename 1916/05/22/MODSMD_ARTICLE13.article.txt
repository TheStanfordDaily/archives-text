# MOROSCO MAKES PLEA FOR PREPAREDNESS
## Class Orator Urges the Assumption of Responsibilities in an Eloquent Address 
### A.H. Morosco 
When a man found himself con
fronted with difficulties, dangers,
vicissitudes inseparable from life, he
began to dvise means to minimize
them. He learned in a primitive stage
of the advantage of co-operation
among individuals faced by the same
trials. This co-operation produced
sympathy and affection based on self
interest. The partnership in joy and
sorrow produced that family tie which
is the origin of organized society. The
grouping of families in villages for
common purposes brought into being
the idea of nationality, which today
is the strongest bond of human co
hesion.
Nationality is at the present time a
grouping of individual entities brought
together for certain ends. The exist
ence of dangers from peoples not
amenable to national feeling led to
the adoption of natural barriers —
mountains, rivers, seas, —to form
boundaries within which peoples with
certain common interests might main
tain themselves. Among these people
there is often strife; but in case of
clanger from distant people, jealousy
and common interest are placed on a
different scale, for if jealousy tri
umphs, the alien comes in and gets a
footing, while the preponderance of
common interests saves and strength
ens national independence. States
manship consists in laying stress
upon the importance of national inter
ests and in minimizing internal dif
ferences.
Dangers of Power.
National life being made up of in
dividual existence, its welfare rests
upon the members who are willing to
subordinate personal ends to the gen
eral good. A nation through its
guardians must always be on the
alert to guard its very existence from
assault. The more powerful a nation
becomes the more jealousy it arouses
among other nations. A nation when
strong does not think of doing good
to others but of displacing them.
This is a fact because there is no
power able to prevent one nation from
insulting or attacking another for the
sake of profit. No amount of culture
can guard a nation from invasion or
conquest if it lacks the physical
power to resist assaults and to give
blow for blow.
Safety of Isolation.
During most of the nineteenth cen
tury the United States held a remark
able popularity abroad. The English
were well disposed because it was in
habited by their kin. The French
were proud of it because they had
aided in its creation. Russia was a
traditional friend; liberals the world
over sympathized with its democratic
institutions, —but in the great game
of international politics the United

States took but little part. Europe
could usually leave us out of her
reckoning.
All this was changed by the Span
ish war. Europe without defending
Spanish mis-government in Cuba, re
garded the action of the United States
as brutal aggression. But America
did more than expel Spain from Cuba
and Porto Rico; she crossed the Pa
cific and established herself in the
Far East. America had assumed a
new position among nations of the
world and henceforth America would
have to be counted as one of the chief
forces in international affairs. The
United States' popularity was gone.
Changed Outlook.
It is no longer possible for the
United States to plunge its head into
the sand of a supposed isolation and
to assume that its policies, its in
fluences, and its ideals are not a part
of an wider world. The outlook has
wholly changed. The future and im
mediate future is charged with serious
International interest and with heavy
international responsibilities. Of this
interest we cannot divest ourselves,
and of this responsibility we dare
not, without proving false to our
creed of the guardians of democracy
and keeper of the faith in Civil Lib
erty.
This tremendous catastrophe across
the sea has again changed the polit
ical status of the world. The present
war is the culmination of years of
hereditary hatred and territorial am
bitions. It is a crisis in the world's
history and the political fabric of na
tions has been torn asunder. And in
the midst of the crucible of hate
stands the United States. Our isola
tion is a thing of the past, our policies
and interest conflicting with Europe
and Asia—our nationality inadequately
defended.
Inadequacy of Defenses.
Have you ever let your fancy dwell
upon our 21,000 miles of undefended
coast line—from Maine to Florida —
from Alaska to the Canal? So far as
defense or offense are concerned, the
securing of our independence and in
suring of our economic intercourse
with other nations, we are already dis
armed. because we today possess no
force in the least adequate. With the
largest sea coast in the world, with
our fleet concentrated on one coast
facing two navies to which it is in
ferior.
Out in the broad Pacific we hold the
strategic points, but as they exist to
day, these points are an actual men
ace to our continental security. If
adequately protected the United
States would control the sea and no
foreign power could attack the Pacific
Coast. Alaska, the unlocked store
house of the Union, lies at the feet of
a conquering nation. What of the

Panama Canal, the ksystone of our
system of national defense? We
might be shorn of half a dozen states
and not be weaker as a world power
to such a degree as if we lost the
canal; and today the fact is that the
United States line of defense is such
that an attack could not be resisted.
Menace To Ideals.
Thus our national creed and terri
torial integrity is in the balance. Fel
low students of the class of 1916, it is
you who will aid in the shaping of
the destiny of this nation. The creed
which we as a nation have given lip
loyalty in the past demands its justi
fication
It shall be your voice and hand
that shall help mould the councils of
state. Today as never before the re
publican theory hangs in the balance
—for this war has shown that the
republican ideal cannot withstand the
old idea of kingship with its concen
tration of power. And as we face this
world-wide problem, hand in hand
conies the greatest menace of our
civilization—the yellow press—ilung
across our nation with its blazing
haodlines, with its deceit and lies,
with its policies dictated by its adver
tising columns, with its candidates
corrupted by greed and avarice, and
its war scare backed by moneyed in
terests. Yes, a menace to public mor
als and private decency, it carries on
its unholy campaign for private ends.
To them we owe the perversion of
public mind—it is to them we owe the
hate that is engendered against our
fellow men across the seas.
Theteaching of this great university
of the people is being led by false
gods and it is our duty to learn the
truth and burn upon our hearts the
great motto—"Ye shall know the
truth and the truth shall set ye free."
Vital Problem.
And as we face the problems of life,
the most vital one is the problem of
the protection of our nationalism of
our national life. Yes, —of our homes.
For there can be no religious reform,
there can be no economic prosperity,
there can be no political devolpment
or an unfolding of divine doctrine of
religious and political liberty, until
the nation can rest in peace.
The great day of internationalism
is not here. We are living in an age
when nationalism is at its height, and
as such we must protect our national
development.
The great mission that the Univer
sity charges us with today is that we
shall understand our problem. Our
four years here have been spent in
seeking the truth, and it asks that we
still seek the truth, and if after truth
finding we learn that safe and sane
preparedness is the cause of a people,
we shall lend our efforts toward that
ideal.
