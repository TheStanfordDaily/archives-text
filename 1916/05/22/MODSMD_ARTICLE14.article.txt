# STANFORD BEQUEATHS PRIVILEGES AND HONORS TO NEW GENERATIONS
## 
### Warren Paul Staniford 
We, the members of the class of
1916, with one foot already in the
world which lies beyond the Stanford
campus, being sane and of sound
mind, subscribe to this, our last will
and testament;
To all Stanford men and women
who shall follow us, we commit the
welfare of the University community.
We enjoin upon 1917, and '18, and '19,
and the generations which will suc
ceed them, the duty to give their ef
forts and enthusiasm to the labor of
building Stanford bigger and better.
We entrust to them the valued tra
ditions and the cherished associations
of the University, and bid them to
add carefully to the store. Those of
the old ways which are not good
should be changed, but always with
assurance that better environment re
sults the change.
To those three classes of students
which survive us in the university
life, we commit the special obligation
to preserve the wholesomeness and
honorable position of the Stanford
student body in its intercollegiate re
lations. We, the class men .and
women of 1916, have lived at Stan
ford during a four-year period of ath

letic unrest, upheaval, and dissolution.
We have seen partial reparation of
the agreement with the University of
California. Having knowledge and
foresight short of omniscience, we
have done things, and seen things
done, during the past four years,
which we might wish undone. But
we go upon our various ways, glad
that the honorable name of Stanford
has not been smirched by our aid.
And so we are jealous of Stanford
honor, and bid you to be jealous like
wise, and to love with your heads as
well as with your hearts; to act care
fully in your sponsorship for the
Stanford Name, and to preserve its
integrity. Guard against internal dis
sentson over athletic problems, abide
by the desire of the majority, play
the game together, and pledge an un
divided loyalty.
To you who follow 1916 we leave the
opportunity to live and work with
President Wilbur, whom we have had
the good fortune merely to welcome
to the Quadrangle. In the words of
Harold Levy, "He has his train
hitched to the stars; get in and ride
with him." We, the men and women
of 1916, have had the advantage,
unique in Stanford history of the

past, and likely of the future, too, of
spending our college life under three
presidents—Dr. Jordan, Dr. Branner,
and Dr. Wilbur. The influence of each
one has been a valued experience.
You who are looking forward, will
meet the difficulties, sharp pleasures,
and make history under the guidance
of Dr. Wilbur. That is a happy fact
for Stanford.
Juniors, sophomores, freshmen, an 3
I phantom members of the classes to
come, we entrust to you one more
heritage. It is the basis of the life
of all good Stanford people every
where; it is the foundation stone of
Stanford pride and honor; it is the
harmonizing element of Stanford in
terests; and having it, you are quali
fied to hold your heads high, and ac
cept the bounties which are placed
about you. The thing we entrust to
your care is Stanford Spirit. Most
of us of 1916 first heard the phrase
lat a football rally in 1012. Perhaps
it appeared to us then a happy term, a
clever epigram, a bit of verbal fire
works, a sentimental extravagance, or
a hysterical catch-phrase. Wo have
come to know that it is real, that it
is not a trick of language, but a
thing of spirit which thrills us in the
quiet places today more really than
it did when George Pressley spoke it
at the football rally in 1912.
To you of the class of 1917 we
relinquish the sombrero, which we
hope will protect you from the
weather, as it has us; we trust also
that you will wonder sometimes, as
we have done, whether you have
really grown to the estate of som
breroed manhood.
To you of the class of 1918 we be
queath the right to wear cords, and
to economize gleefully in the wear
ing of many otherwise useless coats.
To you of the class of 1919 we con
vey the sophomore Red Hat; also the
dangerous enjoyment of your new
freedom from restraint, and the care
of the new freshmen. Remember that
yourselves were, not long since, such
creatures as they are, and become not
so solicitous of their march in the
paths of righteousness that you miss
your own step and stumble. ■
To Joe Braden we give the care of
the 1916 rugby squad. We give it
confidently, and we ask that there
shall be a big squad, and a whole
hearted support of the game through
out the season; for therein lies one
exemplification of the Stanford Spirit.
To Harold Aupperle we consign the
track squad, with foreknowledge that
he will carry his obligations with en
tire credit.
To "Doc" Hayes we bequeath the
baseball prospects, and the key to the
pitcher's box, hopeful that he will
lead the varsity through a good sea
son.
To Rix Maurer we entrust the rep
utation of the Stanford crew, with
best wishes and confidence.
To Winnie Wheatley we gant the
basketball season with our prayer for
victory, and plead that the campus
will make the newest major sport a
business success.
We yield the conduct of The Daily
Palo Alto to "Doc" Howard, with com
plete assurance that he will fulfill his
charge creditably, but with small hope
for his peace of mind during the edi
torial period.
To Lanse Warren we wish success
and distinction in the field of Now
That's, and we hope that while he
wields the hammer, Chaparral will
provide good entertainment and pre
serve the status quo of morality.
To .Terry Robinson we wish good
luck, sure that the Sequoia under his
guidance will continue its progress
and increasing popularity.
To A1 Griffin and the editors of the
Illustrated Review, we wish a contin
uation of the Open Forum idea in
Stanford journalism, knowing that if
it is directed intelligently it will help
many lazy people hereabouts to think
in terms of community welfare.
To all others, of the faculty, the
student body, and to the Trustees,
we voice an expression of the debt we
owe to Stanford, and to the Founders'
memory. For all the abundance of
the heritage which we have enjoyed
as we were inclined to do, we shall
endeavor to prove our gratitude
throughout our lives as alumni of
Stanford.
In testimony whereof we have set
our signatures this nineteenth day of
May, 1910.
