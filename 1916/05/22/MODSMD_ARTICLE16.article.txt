"So this" is the end—tomorrow out
in the wind and the rain." To be
sure, some of us will be glad to get
out in the wind and rain for a while
after basking in the sunshine of Stan
ford existence for four long—no, short
—years. And may the winds be the
soft breezes and the rain the cooling
showers of summer. But we'll prob
ably long for the sunshine again be
fore many months have passed.
Here's luck to you, '16 classmates.
We've known most of you well during
some part of our four years' stay at
Stanford, and we know you've got the
stuff to make good. And we feel we've
been cheated out of something in not
knowing many others whose achieve
ments made us just a bit pealous.
Here's luck.
