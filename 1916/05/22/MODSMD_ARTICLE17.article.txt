# Inner Quadrangle Scene of Unique Prom on Friday
## 
### 
They danced at the Prom Friday
night. If things go on the way they
are going (sonic people are convinced
that it is straight to the bow-wows)
it won't be long before they will ar
range for the ochestra to supply syn
copation between the acts at the sen
ior play. There is plenty of room in
the aisles and around the front of the
stage—why not? Hut for Friday night
the pavement of the Inner Quad was
satisfactory, and with the ukulele
quartet, it far outweighed all the at
tractions of eats and imported or
chestra, and lanterns and prom
enade.
Some people are apt to look around
at the Prom and say that there isn't
anyone there anyhow. That's the way
it looks to the undergraduate whose
friends have already left for home.
Rut. the alumni that were wandering
about the Memorial Court under the
lantern light seemed to find more than
a few people that they know and were
glad to see. All of which goes to
prove that the Prom is a pretty good
institution.
