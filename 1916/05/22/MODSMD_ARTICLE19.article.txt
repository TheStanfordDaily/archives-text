### Glenn A. Hughes 
Glorious we found thee, Stanford, as a star
New-burst upon an evening sky of grey,
That led our feet unfaltering from afar
And lighted us toward the Shrine of Day.
Ah, years that we have seen fade into Past,
And traced upon your folds our joys and fears,
We linger here a moment at the last,
Inscribing deep a pattern laced with tears.
Yet there are no regrets — what wrongs we've done
Have blended with the good that still survives,
And all our deeds have changed into this one
Which hurls us into strange and unknown lives.
If there is aught that's good for us to know
At that quick moment when the last arch shades
Our eyesight from the bold and blinding glow
Of future sunlight, and the dim Quad fades
As does the face of one well-loved who dies,
It must be this: since there can be no end
Without some new beginning — one which lies
Beyond and higher — then must we ascend!
And since within these well-beloved walls
We have been led before the Shrine of Day,
Then he who, leaving, blindly gropes and falls
Mas heeded not the light, and so must pay.
We have no tributes rich enough to bring —
Part-worthy of the glory that is thine,
But here we plant this tree, a growing thing,
And nearest to the simple and divine.
But if it perish, know that though the wind
Blows havoc to our symbol, where it stands,
There is no wind nor sea can ever blind
Our sight of thee from near or distant lands.
Glorious we found thee, Stanford — glorious still
We leave thee — this we pray: that one faint gleam
Of all thy glory follow us, to fill
The darkness of the future, as a dream.
