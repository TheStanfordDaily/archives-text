# Sixteeners Prove Royal Hosts For Last Week of Fun and Jollification
## Farce Starts Queeners Out With Smiles Wednesday Evening 
### Anita Allen, '17 
Ninteen Sixteen is on the last lap
of its Senior Week. And they'll
breast the tape some time in the wee
sma' hours of tomorrow morning,
when the orchestra at the Vendome
swings into "Aloha Oe." Or was it
this morning in the Assembly Hall
that Father Time's stop watch clicked
the finish of college for them?
As a class, Sixteen has failed all
'round at keeping in right with the
weather gods. Their Junior Week es
tablished a rainfall record, and their
Senior Week—but what does a little
wind matter anyway when you're

having a good time? And they have
shown, these Sixteeners, that they are
royal hosts.
They made everybody laugh Wed
nesday night (no small feat when you
think how many of the audience were
not so sure that their showing in
exes that morning would justify a re
turn to the campus next fall.) That
was the play. They made everybody
dance Thursday night, and they
called that the carnival.
Friday morning found the Seniors
on the north terrace listening to the
class will and oration. Then through

the Inner Quad they went where the
whole history and love and work of
the class were left with Stanford un
der the class plate that looks so new
lying there beside Fifteen and all the
rest. Turning over the Memorial duty
to 1917 made them feel more than
ever that they were really leaving.
Friday afternoon, the seniors, alum
ni and faculty made their way to the
gymnasium, where Dr. Wilbur (who
has been each of those things in turn)
was to receive them. In the eve
ning, lanterns and music and good
byes went to make up a Prom that
everyone declared was the best ever.

On Alumni Day, the Sixteeners had
a chance to see the one day of the
Stanford year that will belong to
them next year and in those to come
afterward. Senior-Faculty baseball
made the faculty diamond the center
of hilarity in the morning. Then
after their business meeting, the
alumni and near-alumni combined
talk and necessary nourishment at
tin luncheon in the Memorial Court.
"Moving Moralities" both moralized
and moved in the afternoon to the
undeniable satisfaction of all ob
servers.
The ceremonial of Alumni Pay

which marked a real milestone in the
history of the University, was the lay
ing of the cornerstone for a new
Quad, Dr. Jordan giving the address.
The rest of the day was filled by the
Senior tree-planting, Resident Alum
nae reception, class dinners, Phi Beta
Kappa banquet, and Senior-Alumui re
ception.
Dr. Peabody addressed the gradu
ating class Sunday morning on "The
Secret of Power," and this morning
Sixteen really took the fatal step of
leaving us for good as they walked
down the Assembly Hall stage, with
diploma.* In their hinds.

whole history and love and work of
the class were left with Stanford un
der the class plate that looks so new
lying there beside Fifteen and all the
rest. Turning over the Memorial duty
to 1917 made them feel more than
ever that they were really leaving.
Friday afternoon, the seniors, alum
ni and faculty made their way to the
gymnasium, where Dr. Wilbur (who
has been each of those things in turn)
was to receive them. In the eve
ning, lanterns and music and good
byes went to make up a Prom that
everyone declared was the best ever.

On Alumni Day, the Sixteeners had
a chance to see the one day of the
Stanford year that will belong to
them next year and in those to come
afterward. Senior-Faculty baseball
made the faculty diamond the center
of hilarity in the morning. Then
after their business meeting, the
alumni and near-alumni combined
talk and necessary nourishment at
tin luncheon in the Memorial Court.
"Moving Moralities" both moralized
and moved in the afternoon to the
undeniable satisfaction of all ob
servers.
The ceremonial of Alumni Pay

which marked a real milestone in the
history of the University, was the lay
ing of the cornerstone for a new
Quad, Dr. Jordan giving the address.
The rest of the day was filled by the
Senior tree-planting, Resident Alum
nae reception, class dinners, Phi Beta
Kappa banquet, and Senior-Alumui re
ception.
Dr. Peabody addressed the gradu
ating class Sunday morning on "The
Secret of Power," and this morning
Sixteen really took the fatal step of
leaving us for good as they walked
down the Assembly Hall stage, with
diploma.* In their hinds.

Ninteen Sixteen is on the last lap
of its Senior Week. And they'll
breast the tape some time in the wee
sma' hours of tomorrow morning,
when the orchestra at the Vendome
swings into "Aloha Oe." Or was it
this morning in the Assembly Hall
that Father Time's stop watch clicked
the finish of college for them?
As a class, Sixteen has failed all
'round at keeping in right with the
weather gods. Their Junior Week es
tablished a rainfall record, and their
Senior Week—but what does a little
wind matter anyway when you're

having a good time? And they have
shown, these Sixteeners, that they are
royal hosts.
They made everybody laugh Wed
nesday night (no small feat when you
think how many of the audience were
not so sure that their showing in
exes that morning would justify a re
turn to the campus next fall.) That
was the play. They made everybody
dance Thursday night, and they
called that the carnival.
Friday morning found the Seniors
on the north terrace listening to the
class will and oration. Then through

the Inner Quad they went where the
whole history and love and work of
the class were left with Stanford un
der the class plate that looks so new
lying there beside Fifteen and all the
rest. Turning over the Memorial duty
