Taking "The Secret of Power" for
his subject, and preaching from the
text, "And the Jews marveled, saying,
'How knoweth this man learning, hav
ing never learned?'" Dr. Francis G.
Peabody addressed a large audience in
the Memorial Church, Sunday morn
ing. The Baccalaureate sermon was
directed to those leaving the Univer
sity, to whom he talked of that Man
who, though he never learned, and
had no degrees to teach, was a lec
turer without a liberal education.
"Now what was the secret of this
power in Jesus Christ? How could
he teach with authority when he had
no authority to teach? How could
he know learning having never
learned? Jesus answers these ques
tions. 'My doctrine, he says, 'is not
mine, but his that sent me. If any
man will do his will he shall know
the doctrine, whether it be of God or
whether I speak of myself.' The
secret of his power, that is to say,
was in its being not his own power.
His teaching had been committed to
him as a messenger and interpreter,
and the sense of being an instrument
of him who sent him gave confidence
to all he had to say. He had given
his will to do the will of his Father,
and that surrender had brought with
it insight, wisdom and power. The
deication of his will had become the
clarification of his mind. Tt would be
the same he said to his hearers, with
any one of them.
"What is true of learning is true of
life. The secret of power, whether it
be intellectual, moral or spiritual, is
in attaching one's life to a source of
power and the utilization of that dy
namic of the larger will. Pcronal re
ligion that is to say, begins, not in a
creed, not in a form, not even in a
perfect character, but in that clari
fication of thought and amplification
of duty and purification of desire
which can issue from nothing else but
the consecration of the will.
That does not mean a refuge from
the vicissitudes of life as though one
had reached an harbor where no
storm can come, but it means this, —
that across the deeps of experience
which have to be traversed, and
through the storms which are sure to
come, one has at least a course to
steer, a port to reach, and a set to
keep his rudder true."

secret of his power, that is to say,
was in its being not his own power.
His teaching had been committed to
him as a messenger and interpreter,
and the sense of being an instrument
of him who sent him gave confidence
to all he had to say. He had given
his will to do the will of his Father,
and that surrender had brought with
it insight, wisdom and power. The
deication of his will had become the
clarification of his mind. Tt would be
the same he said to his hearers, with
any one of them.
"What is true of learning is true of
life. The secret of power, whether it
be intellectual, moral or spiritual, is
in attaching one's life to a source of
power and the utilization of that dy
namic of the larger will. Pcronal re
ligion that is to say, begins, not in a
creed, not in a form, not even in a
perfect character, but in that clari
fication of thought and amplification
of duty and purification of desire
which can issue from nothing else but
the consecration of the will.
That does not mean a refuge from
the vicissitudes of life as though one
had reached an harbor where no
storm can come, but it means this, —
that across the deeps of experience
which have to be traversed, and
through the storms which are sure to
come, one has at least a course to
steer, a port to reach, and a set to
keep his rudder true."
