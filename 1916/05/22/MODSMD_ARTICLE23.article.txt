# ANNALS OF NINETEEN-SIXTEEN CLASS RECORDED FOR COLLEGE POSTERITY BY HATCH
## 
### Warde Hatch 
This week marks a period of tran
sition for the class of 1916. We, as a

class, cease to be a
unit in undergrad
uate affairs, and as
sume for evermore
our role as alumni
of Stanford Univer
sity. We will be
glad to take our
places in the world,
but iv is with the
keenest regret that
we bid farewell to

life on the Stanford "Farm." Truly
this is a most proper time for remin
iscences. Let us now consider the
events of the past four years in which
our class and its members have been
so actively engaged.
It was during the last week in Aug
ust, 1912, that we came to Stanford
University to make up the Freshman
class, the class of 1916. We always
point with pride to those first days
of our existence at the University,
especially to the victory over the class
of 1915 in the annual underclass tie
up. We also like to add that this is
the first and only time that a fresh
man class has ever won this event.
We soon adapted ourselves to our
new environment, becoming infused
with that intangible, yet very real
something known as "Stanford Spirit."
Charles K. Field has expressed it as
"Loyalty to Stanford, to the whole
University."
To the 1912 varsity football team,
we contributed Joe Urban, who did
more than his share at right wing in
the famous 3-3 mud-tie with Califor
nia on November 11. Our class foot
ball team was composed of Stephen
son, Dunn, Butterfield, Edwards,
Dubendorff, Braden, Hayes, Cass,
Mackall, McCray, Murray, Lammiman,
Captain Urban, Dingley, Campbell,
Laine, Adams, and Brown.
Nineteen-sixteen played an import
ant role in the victories won by Stan
ford in the spring of 1913. In the
track meet with California, "Herb"
Whitted, "Skin" Wilson, "Feg" Mur
ray, "Bob" Krohn and "Jack" Tufts
were point winners for the Cardinal
which won by the close margin of
two-fifths of a point. These men and
others won the interclass meet for us
that season. The 1916 Freshman
crew, Wood, Oyster, Jones, Hamaker,
Green ,Orme, Long, Captain Worth,
and Coxswain Goodman, was one of
the best that ever defeated a first
year eight from across the bay.
"Peg" Morosco was the first speaker
for Stanford in the intercollegiate de
bate which was decided in favor of
the Cardinal. Morosco and Hettinger
composed the affirmative Tri-State
team that year. The victory of the
Freshman-Sophomore debate went to
the first-year speakers, Charlie Cook,

Frank Elden, and Al. Hettinger.
During the first semester of our
sophomore year, on October 1, 1913,
we saw Dr. John Casper Branner in
stalled as President of Stanford Uni
versity, to succeed Dr. David Starr
.Jordan, who was given the honorary
position of Chancellor, an office es
pecially created for him. At this
time, Dr. Branner expressed his in
tention to remain in office for but two
years, when he should become sixty
five years of age.
Much of Stanford's success, and
many of the ideals for which the
University stands have been due to
the untiring labor of Chancellor .Jor
dan. He has given many of the best
years of his life to the great work
which the founders, Senator and Mrs.
Stanford, so confidently left in his
hands. In Dr. Branner the Univer
sity obtained an executive who, like
his predecessor, has grown gray in
the service. He also, belonged to the
"old guard" of the faculty, men who
won the admiration of every genera
tion of Stanford men and women.
On October 31, we saw the last
"Plug Ugly" show to be given at
Stanford University, for a little over
a month later, on December 4, the up
perclass rush and everything that
went with it was abolished by an act
of the University Conference.
In the early part of the spring se
mester, 1916 produced her sophomore
play, "The Fortune Hunter." It was
a brilliant success from the critic's
standpoint, but a failure financially.
Perhaps the name had something to
do with that.
Next fall we returned to proudly
take our places as upperclassmen.
We now felt that we were a most im
portant part of the community, but
something happened which "took us
down a few notches." The "Plug
Ugly" and the Senior-Junior poster
fight had been reinstated by popular
vote of the upperclassmen, and this
"something" happened in connection
with the latter. We had bested 1915
regularly in the underclass clashes,
and felt confident that we could do it
again. Our rivals, however, had
tasted the bitter cup of defeat, and
they now planned their revenge. It
was well planned, too, and as a re
sult, most of nineteen-sixteen's husk
ies spent the night in stocks at the
Beta house as prisoners of the sen
iors. We won the rush through the
Quad the following night, but this
victory hardly offset the humiliation
of the night before.
At the end of the two years from
when Dr. Branner was installed, no
one had been chosen to succeed him,
and he gratiously consented to serve
for another year, or until his suc
cessor could be named. On October
12, 1915, the Board of Trustees of the
University announced that Dr. Ray

Lyman Wilbur, Dean of the Stanford
Medical School, and a Stanford grad
uate with the class of 1896, had been
chosen to fill the honored position.
Dr. Wilbur assumed office and was
formally installed on January 22. Dr.
Branner at that time became the
President Emeritus of the University.
The 1916 Junior Week, including the
opera, "At the Dragon's Eye," the
Prom in Encina Hall, and the usual
lake sports at Lagunita, was voted a
success by all, even though rainy
weather prevented some of the events
scheduled.
A month later came the break with
the University of California, the most
serious difficulty which has ever
arisen between the greatest universi
ties of the Golden State. On the
morning of April 23, 1915, the stu
dents of the University of California
sent the following resolution to Stan
ford: "That we will not engage in
intercollegiate varsity contests with
Stanford University except under the
express agreement that the freshman
eligibility rule shall be one of the
conditions to govern said contests."
A compromise was finally negotia
ted on February 3, 1916, and inter
collegiate competition was immediate
ly resumed in every sport except
football, California having returned to
the American game. Stanford accept
ed the freshman ineligibility rule,
while California agreed to raise the
scholarship requirements for athletic
competition, and not to use men from
her affiliated colleges. Everyone re
joiced at this declaration of peace.
The next step is the solution of the
football problem. A return to the
American game of football was pro
posed, but was not ratified by the stu
dents by popular vote.
In the four years which we have
spent at Stanford University, we have
seen the Cardinal teams win the ma
jority of contests with California.
We have never seen a California in
tercollegiate victory in varsity foot
ball, track or crew. In our fresh
man year we witnessed the 3-3 tie
football game played after a storm,
following year, 1913, the Cardinal won
on a field of mud and water. The
by a score of 13-8, and in 1914, by a
score of 26-8. The Big Game of 1915
was played with the University of
Santa Clara, and Stanford won, 30-0,
The intercollegiate track meet
staged in the spring semester of our
first year went to Stanford by the
close score of 61 1-5 to 60 4-5. The
score of the 1914 meet was 66 5-6 to
55 1-6, while that of the 1915 meet was
62-60. Stanford won the Big Meet
this year, 1916, 69-53.
The Cardinal crew invaded the east
in the summer of 1915,and in the
famous annual Poughkeepsie regatta
on the Hudson came in half a boat
length behind the victorious Cornell

shell, defeating the eights of Syracuse,
Columbia, and Pennsylvania.
In baseball, Stanford has not been
so successful, and during the past
four years has won but one intercol
legiate series with California. Fresh
man intercollegiate competition was
resumed in the spring of 1916. The
Cardinal first-year teams were vic
torious in basketball, but lost the
contests in track, baseball, and crew.
This was the first defeat in freshman
crew since 1904.
The class of 191G has been well rep
resented in every branch of student
activities. In football, Danny Carroll,
Joe Braden, and Joe Urban, have
been our mainstays. Carroll was
captain of the 1915 team, while
Braden has been chosen to lead the
team of next year. Urban has played
consistently at wing for four years,
thereoy winning tne four star distinc
tion.
We have been exceptionally well
represented in track by "Skin" Wil
son In the mile, "Herb" Whitted and
Johnny Norton in the hurdles, and
"Feg" Murray in the sprints and
hurdles, Derrol Chace in the quarter,
Bob Krohn in the pole vault, Verne
King in the hammer throw, and Harry
Lachmund in the high jump. Murray
and Wilson have made their four
stars. Nineteen-sixteen won the in
terclass track meet in both freshman
and senior years.
"Doc" Hayes, pitcher and first
baseman; Bill Noonan and Don Day,
outfielders; "Canary" Campbell and
"Joe" Braden, utility men, are our
representatives who have made their
varsity "S's" in baseball. Hayes will
be captain of the varsity nine next
year.
In crew, 1916 has been well to the
fore with such stalwarts as "Chick"
Orme, "Baldy" Green, Fred Worth,
and Coxswain Johnny Goodman. Orme
was captain of this year's eight.
Nineteen-sixteen has been well rep
resented in dramatics. Terese Dor
rob, Marion Vaughan, Irma Rayburn,
Irene Rowlands, Alice Butcher, Doro
thy Egbert, Buford Williams, Dick
Morgan, Wilmer Gross, Frank Camp
bell, Bob Krohn, Wallace Curtis,
"Baldy" Leland, Leo Dayton and
Johnny Phillips have each taken an
active part in the local productions.
The class has also taken an active
interest in literary work. Paul Stam
ford and Ray Wakefield have each
served as editor-in-chief of The Daily
Palo Alto, while Wilmer Gross has
been managing editor. Glenn Hughes
and "Hip" Levy have edited Sequoia
and The Chaparral respectively.
"Peg" Morosco, Frank Elden, Al.
I Hettinger, Art Johnson, Corson Ide,
Kaufman, English, and Fribley have
distinguished themselves in debating.
The coveted Phi Beta Kappa key
has been awarded to twenty-seven

members of the class. They are the
Misses Hazel Fisher, Margaret Forbes,
Katherine Hutchinson, Ruby Kerr,
Dorothy Simon, Florence Stuart, Edith
Smith, Jessie Smith, Elinor Cogswell,
Marion Horn, Pearl Weeks, Muriel
Turner, Minerva Anderson, and A. J.

orary society, includes five sixteeners
among its members, G. F. Ferris, R.
K. Vickery, C. L. Hubbs, A. Von der
Ropp, and H. C. Coe.
The 1916 class presidents in order
have been C. W. Jordan, "Baldy"
Leland, "Doc" Harvey, "Chet" Wing,
"Joe" Braden, "Feg" Murray, and
"Hill" Noonan. Paul Staniford was
recently named by the Hoard of Trus
tees to serve as Student Adviser for
the coming year. Miss Alice Butcher
and A. S. Hayes were appointed as the
flower committee.
Nineteen-sixteen has also been well
represented in women's activities. In
athletics, Madeleine Turner, Maud
Lowell, Ellen Andrews, Doris Over
man, Dorothy Egbert, and Virgina
Clowe have taken an active part. Rep
resentatives in journalism have been
Olive Yoder, Dorothy Egbert, Jessie
Hunt, and Katrina Johnson. The
women who have served on the
Women's Conference are the Misses
Andrews, Albrecht, Fisher, Turner,
Egbert, Clancy, Farrell, Schellbach,
Alderton and Lewis.
In musical activities, Marion Roal,
I Georgia Haffner, Alice Butcher, Mar
| ion Vaughan, Hazel Fisher, Leigh
Shelton, Madeleine Turner. Doris
Overman, Irma Rayburn, Rowena
Taylor, Ruth Lorraine, Hazel Hart
well, Dorothy Albrecht, Mabel Schell
bach, and Lillian McQuown have kept
1916 well represented. Cap and Gown,
senior women's honor society, in

Olive Yoder, Ellen Andrews, Stella
Connelly and Helen Denhart have
taken an active part in Y.W.C.A. work.
The class of 1916 is now disbanding.
At this time next year its members
will be scattered far and wide over
the nation, and in all probability, the
world, but each, no matter how dis
tant his or her residence may be, will
always look back to the years spent
so beneficially and enjoyably at Stan
ford University. "One, two, three,
four; ah, how we wish there were
more."

with that intangible, yet very real
something known as "Stanford Spirit."
Charles K. Field has expressed it as
"Loyalty to Stanford, to the whole
University."
To the 1912 varsity football team,
we contributed Joe Urban, who did
more than his share at right wing in
the famous 3-3 mud-tie with Califor
nia on November 11. Our class foot
ball team was composed of Stephen
son, Dunn, Butterfield, Edwards,
Dubendorff, Braden, Hayes, Cass,
Mackall, McCray, Murray, Lammiman,
Captain Urban, Dingley, Campbell,
Laine, Adams, and Brown.
Nineteen-sixteen played an import
ant role in the victories won by Stan
ford in the spring of 1913. In the
track meet with California, "Herb"
Whitted, "Skin" Wilson, "Feg" Mur
ray, "Bob" Krohn and "Jack" Tufts
were point winners for the Cardinal
which won by the close margin of
two-fifths of a point. These men and
others won the interclass meet for us
that season. The 1916 Freshman
crew, Wood, Oyster, Jones, Hamaker,
Green ,Orme, Long, Captain Worth,
and Coxswain Goodman, was one of
the best that ever defeated a first
year eight from across the bay.
"Peg" Morosco was the first speaker
for Stanford in the intercollegiate de
bate which was decided in favor of
the Cardinal. Morosco and Hettinger
composed the affirmative Tri-State
team that year. The victory of the
Freshman-Sophomore debate went to
the first-year speakers, Charlie Cook,

Frank Elden, and Al. Hettinger.
During the first semester of our
sophomore year, on October 1, 1913,
we saw Dr. John Casper Branner in
stalled as President of Stanford Uni
versity, to succeed Dr. David Starr
.Jordan, who was given the honorary
position of Chancellor, an office es
pecially created for him. At this
time, Dr. Branner expressed his in
tention to remain in office for but two
years, when he should become sixty
five years of age.
Much of Stanford's success, and
many of the ideals for which the
University stands have been due to
the untiring labor of Chancellor .Jor
dan. He has given many of the best
years of his life to the great work
which the founders, Senator and Mrs.
Stanford, so confidently left in his
hands. In Dr. Branner the Univer
sity obtained an executive who, like
his predecessor, has grown gray in
the service. He also, belonged to the
"old guard" of the faculty, men who
won the admiration of every genera
tion of Stanford men and women.
On October 31, we saw the last
"Plug Ugly" show to be given at
Stanford University, for a little over
a month later, on December 4, the up
perclass rush and everything that
went with it was abolished by an act
of the University Conference.
In the early part of the spring se
mester, 1916 produced her sophomore
play, "The Fortune Hunter." It was
a brilliant success from the critic's
standpoint, but a failure financially.
Perhaps the name had something to
do with that.
Next fall we returned to proudly
take our places as upperclassmen.
We now felt that we were a most im
portant part of the community, but
something happened which "took us
down a few notches." The "Plug
Ugly" and the Senior-Junior poster
fight had been reinstated by popular
vote of the upperclassmen, and this
"something" happened in connection
with the latter. We had bested 1915
regularly in the underclass clashes,
and felt confident that we could do it
again. Our rivals, however, had
tasted the bitter cup of defeat, and
they now planned their revenge. It
was well planned, too, and as a re
sult, most of nineteen-sixteen's husk
ies spent the night in stocks at the
Beta house as prisoners of the sen
iors. We won the rush through the
Quad the following night, but this
victory hardly offset the humiliation
of the night before.
At the end of the two years from
when Dr. Branner was installed, no
one had been chosen to succeed him,
and he gratiously consented to serve
for another year, or until his suc
cessor could be named. On October
12, 1915, the Board of Trustees of the
University announced that Dr. Ray

Lyman Wilbur, Dean of the Stanford
Medical School, and a Stanford grad
uate with the class of 1896, had been
chosen to fill the honored position.
Dr. Wilbur assumed office and was
formally installed on January 22. Dr.
Branner at that time became the
President Emeritus of the University.
The 1916 Junior Week, including the
opera, "At the Dragon's Eye," the
Prom in Encina Hall, and the usual
lake sports at Lagunita, was voted a
success by all, even though rainy
weather prevented some of the events
scheduled.
A month later came the break with
the University of California, the most
serious difficulty which has ever
arisen between the greatest universi
ties of the Golden State. On the
morning of April 23, 1915, the stu
dents of the University of California
sent the following resolution to Stan
ford: "That we will not engage in
intercollegiate varsity contests with
Stanford University except under the
express agreement that the freshman
eligibility rule shall be one of the
conditions to govern said contests."
A compromise was finally negotia
ted on February 3, 1916, and inter
collegiate competition was immediate
ly resumed in every sport except
football, California having returned to
the American game. Stanford accept
ed the freshman ineligibility rule,
while California agreed to raise the
scholarship requirements for athletic
competition, and not to use men from
her affiliated colleges. Everyone re
joiced at this declaration of peace.
The next step is the solution of the
football problem. A return to the
American game of football was pro
posed, but was not ratified by the stu
dents by popular vote.
In the four years which we have
spent at Stanford University, we have
seen the Cardinal teams win the ma
jority of contests with California.
We have never seen a California in
tercollegiate victory in varsity foot
ball, track or crew. In our fresh
man year we witnessed the 3-3 tie
football game played after a storm,
following year, 1913, the Cardinal won
on a field of mud and water. The
by a score of 13-8, and in 1914, by a
score of 26-8. The Big Game of 1915
was played with the University of
Santa Clara, and Stanford won, 30-0,
The intercollegiate track meet
staged in the spring semester of our
first year went to Stanford by the
close score of 61 1-5 to 60 4-5. The
score of the 1914 meet was 66 5-6 to
55 1-6, while that of the 1915 meet was
62-60. Stanford won the Big Meet
this year, 1916, 69-53.
The Cardinal crew invaded the east
in the summer of 1915,and in the
famous annual Poughkeepsie regatta
on the Hudson came in half a boat
length behind the victorious Cornell

shell, defeating the eights of Syracuse,
Columbia, and Pennsylvania.
In baseball, Stanford has not been
so successful, and during the past
four years has won but one intercol
legiate series with California. Fresh
man intercollegiate competition was
resumed in the spring of 1916. The
Cardinal first-year teams were vic
torious in basketball, but lost the
contests in track, baseball, and crew.
This was the first defeat in freshman
crew since 1904.
The class of 191G has been well rep
resented in every branch of student
activities. In football, Danny Carroll,
Joe Braden, and Joe Urban, have
been our mainstays. Carroll was
captain of the 1915 team, while
Braden has been chosen to lead the
team of next year. Urban has played
consistently at wing for four years,
thereoy winning tne four star distinc
tion.
We have been exceptionally well
represented in track by "Skin" Wil
son In the mile, "Herb" Whitted and
Johnny Norton in the hurdles, and
"Feg" Murray in the sprints and
hurdles, Derrol Chace in the quarter,
Bob Krohn in the pole vault, Verne
King in the hammer throw, and Harry
Lachmund in the high jump. Murray
and Wilson have made their four
stars. Nineteen-sixteen won the in
terclass track meet in both freshman
and senior years.
"Doc" Hayes, pitcher and first
baseman; Bill Noonan and Don Day,
outfielders; "Canary" Campbell and
"Joe" Braden, utility men, are our
representatives who have made their
varsity "S's" in baseball. Hayes will
be captain of the varsity nine next
year.
In crew, 1916 has been well to the
fore with such stalwarts as "Chick"
Orme, "Baldy" Green, Fred Worth,
and Coxswain Johnny Goodman. Orme
was captain of this year's eight.
Nineteen-sixteen has been well rep
resented in dramatics. Terese Dor
rob, Marion Vaughan, Irma Rayburn,
Irene Rowlands, Alice Butcher, Doro
thy Egbert, Buford Williams, Dick
Morgan, Wilmer Gross, Frank Camp
bell, Bob Krohn, Wallace Curtis,
"Baldy" Leland, Leo Dayton and
Johnny Phillips have each taken an
active part in the local productions.
The class has also taken an active
interest in literary work. Paul Stam
ford and Ray Wakefield have each
served as editor-in-chief of The Daily
Palo Alto, while Wilmer Gross has
been managing editor. Glenn Hughes
and "Hip" Levy have edited Sequoia
and The Chaparral respectively.
"Peg" Morosco, Frank Elden, Al.
I Hettinger, Art Johnson, Corson Ide,
Kaufman, English, and Fribley have
distinguished themselves in debating.
The coveted Phi Beta Kappa key
has been awarded to twenty-seven

members of the class. They are the
Misses Hazel Fisher, Margaret Forbes,
Katherine Hutchinson, Ruby Kerr,
Dorothy Simon, Florence Stuart, Edith
Smith, Jessie Smith, Elinor Cogswell,

have been C. W. Jordan, "Baldy"

"Joe" Braden, "Feg" Murray, and
"Hill" Noonan. Paul Staniford was
recently named by the Hoard of Trus
tees to serve as Student Adviser for
the coming year. Miss Alice Butcher
and A. S. Hayes were appointed as the
flower committee.
Nineteen-sixteen has also been well
represented in women's activities. In
athletics, Madeleine Turner, Maud

Clowe have taken an active part. Rep
resentatives in journalism have been
Olive Yoder, Dorothy Egbert, Jessie

The class of 1916 is now disbanding.
At this time next year its members
will be scattered far and wide over
the nation, and in all probability, the
world, but each, no matter how dis

always look back to the years spent
so beneficially and enjoyably at Stan

more."

Danny Carroll.
This week marks a period of tran
sition for the class of 1916. We, as a

class, cease to be a
unit in undergrad
uate affairs, and as
sume for evermore
our role as alumni
of Stanford Univer
sity. We will be
glad to take our
places in the world,
but iv is with the
keenest regret that
we bid farewell to

life on the Stanford "Farm." Truly
this is a most proper time for remin
iscences. Let us now consider the
events of the past four years in which
our class and its members have been
so actively engaged.
It was during the last week in Aug
ust, 1912, that we came to Stanford
University to make up the Freshman
class, the class of 1916. We always
point with pride to those first days
of our existence at the University,
especially to the victory over the class
of 1915 in the annual underclass tie
up. We also like to add that this is
the first and only time that a fresh
man class has ever won this event.
We soon adapted ourselves to our
new environment, becoming infused
with that intangible, yet very real
something known as "Stanford Spirit."
Charles K. Field has expressed it as
"Loyalty to Stanford, to the whole
University."
To the 1912 varsity football team,
we contributed Joe Urban, who did
more than his share at right wing in
the famous 3-3 mud-tie with Califor
nia on November 11. Our class foot

the best that ever defeated a first
year eight from across the bay.
"Peg" Morosco was the first speaker
for Stanford in the intercollegiate de
bate which was decided in favor of
the Cardinal. Morosco and Hettinger
composed the affirmative Tri-State
team that year. The victory of the
Freshman-Sophomore debate went to
the first-year speakers, Charlie Cook,

Frank Elden, and Al. Hettinger.
During the first semester of our
sophomore year, on October 1, 1913,
we saw Dr. John Casper Branner in
stalled as President of Stanford Uni
versity, to succeed Dr. David Starr
.Jordan, who was given the honorary
position of Chancellor, an office es
pecially created for him. At this
time, Dr. Branner expressed his in
tention to remain in office for but two
years, when he should become sixty
five years of age.
Much of Stanford's success, and
many of the ideals for which the
University stands have been due to
the untiring labor of Chancellor .Jor
dan. He has given many of the best
years of his life to the great work
which the founders, Senator and Mrs.
Stanford, so confidently left in his
hands. In Dr. Branner the Univer
sity obtained an executive who, like
his predecessor, has grown gray in
the service. He also, belonged to the
"old guard" of the faculty, men who
won the admiration of every genera
tion of Stanford men and women.
On October 31, we saw the last
"Plug Ugly" show to be given at
Stanford University, for a little over
a month later, on December 4, the up
perclass rush and everything that
went with it was abolished by an act
of the University Conference.
In the early part of the spring se
mester, 1916 produced her sophomore
play, "The Fortune Hunter." It was
a brilliant success from the critic's
standpoint, but a failure financially.
Perhaps the name had something to
do with that.
Next fall we returned to proudly
take our places as upperclassmen.
We now felt that we were a most im
portant part of the community, but
something happened which "took us
down a few notches." The "Plug
Ugly" and the Senior-Junior poster
fight had been reinstated by popular
vote of the upperclassmen, and this
"something" happened in connection
with the latter. We had bested 1915
regularly in the underclass clashes,
and felt confident that we could do it
again. Our rivals, however, had
tasted the bitter cup of defeat, and
they now planned their revenge. It
was well planned, too, and as a re
sult, most of nineteen-sixteen's husk
ies spent the night in stocks at the
Beta house as prisoners of the sen
iors. We won the rush through the
Quad the following night, but this
victory hardly offset the humiliation
of the night before.
At the end of the two years from
when Dr. Branner was installed, no
one had been chosen to succeed him,
and he gratiously consented to serve
for another year, or until his suc
cessor could be named. On October
12, 1915, the Board of Trustees of the
University announced that Dr. Ray

Lyman Wilbur, Dean of the Stanford
Medical School, and a Stanford grad
uate with the class of 1896, had been
chosen to fill the honored position.
Dr. Wilbur assumed office and was
formally installed on January 22. Dr.
Branner at that time became the
President Emeritus of the University.
The 1916 Junior Week, including the
opera, "At the Dragon's Eye," the
Prom in Encina Hall, and the usual
lake sports at Lagunita, was voted a
success by all, even though rainy
weather prevented some of the events
scheduled.
A month later came the break with
the University of California, the most
serious difficulty which has ever
arisen between the greatest universi
ties of the Golden State. On the
morning of April 23, 1915, the stu
dents of the University of California
sent the following resolution to Stan
ford: "That we will not engage in
intercollegiate varsity contests with
Stanford University except under the
express agreement that the freshman
eligibility rule shall be one of the
conditions to govern said contests."
A compromise was finally negotia
ted on February 3, 1916, and inter
collegiate competition was immediate
ly resumed in every sport except
football, California having returned to
the American game. Stanford accept
ed the freshman ineligibility rule,
while California agreed to raise the
scholarship requirements for athletic
competition, and not to use men from
her affiliated colleges. Everyone re
joiced at this declaration of peace.
The next step is the solution of the
football problem. A return to the
American game of football was pro
posed, but was not ratified by the stu
dents by popular vote.
In the four years which we have
spent at Stanford University, we have
seen the Cardinal teams win the ma
jority of contests with California.
We have never seen a California in
tercollegiate victory in varsity foot
ball, track or crew. In our fresh
man year we witnessed the 3-3 tie
football game played after a storm,
following year, 1913, the Cardinal won
on a field of mud and water. The
by a score of 13-8, and in 1914, by a
score of 26-8. The Big Game of 1915
was played with the University of
Santa Clara, and Stanford won, 30-0,
The intercollegiate track meet
staged in the spring semester of our
first year went to Stanford by the
close score of 61 1-5 to 60 4-5. The
score of the 1914 meet was 66 5-6 to
55 1-6, while that of the 1915 meet was
62-60. Stanford won the Big Meet
this year, 1916, 69-53.
The Cardinal crew invaded the east
in the summer of 1915,and in the
famous annual Poughkeepsie regatta
on the Hudson came in half a boat
length behind the victorious Cornell

shell, defeating the eights of Syracuse,
Columbia, and Pennsylvania.
In baseball, Stanford has not been
so successful, and during the past
four years has won but one intercol
legiate series with California. Fresh
man intercollegiate competition was
resumed in the spring of 1916. The
Cardinal first-year teams were vic
torious in basketball, but lost the
contests in track, baseball, and crew.
This was the first defeat in freshman
crew since 1904.
The class of 191G has been well rep
resented in every branch of student
activities. In football, Danny Carroll,
Joe Braden, and Joe Urban, have
been our mainstays. Carroll was
captain of the 1915 team, while
Braden has been chosen to lead the
team of next year. Urban has played
consistently at wing for four years,
thereoy winning tne four star distinc
tion.
We have been exceptionally well
represented in track by "Skin" Wil
son In the mile, "Herb" Whitted and
Johnny Norton in the hurdles, and
"Feg" Murray in the sprints and
hurdles, Derrol Chace in the quarter,
Bob Krohn in the pole vault, Verne
King in the hammer throw, and Harry
Lachmund in the high jump. Murray
and Wilson have made their four
stars. Nineteen-sixteen won the in
terclass track meet in both freshman
and senior years.
"Doc" Hayes, pitcher and first
baseman; Bill Noonan and Don Day,
outfielders; "Canary" Campbell and
"Joe" Braden, utility men, are our
representatives who have made their
varsity "S's" in baseball. Hayes will
be captain of the varsity nine next
year.
In crew, 1916 has been well to the
fore with such stalwarts as "Chick"
Orme, "Baldy" Green, Fred Worth,
and Coxswain Johnny Goodman. Orme
was captain of this year's eight.
Nineteen-sixteen has been well rep
resented in dramatics. Terese Dor
rob, Marion Vaughan, Irma Rayburn,
Irene Rowlands, Alice Butcher, Doro
thy Egbert, Buford Williams, Dick
Morgan, Wilmer Gross, Frank Camp
bell, Bob Krohn, Wallace Curtis,
"Baldy" Leland, Leo Dayton and
Johnny Phillips have each taken an
active part in the local productions.
The class has also taken an active
interest in literary work. Paul Stam
ford and Ray Wakefield have each
served as editor-in-chief of The Daily
Palo Alto, while Wilmer Gross has
been managing editor. Glenn Hughes
and "Hip" Levy have edited Sequoia
and The Chaparral respectively.
"Peg" Morosco, Frank Elden, Al.
I Hettinger, Art Johnson, Corson Ide,
Kaufman, English, and Fribley have
distinguished themselves in debating.
The coveted Phi Beta Kappa key
has been awarded to twenty-seven

members of the class. They are the
Misses Hazel Fisher, Margaret Forbes,
Katherine Hutchinson, Ruby Kerr,
Dorothy Simon, Florence Stuart, Edith
Smith, Jessie Smith, Elinor Cogswell,

recently named by the Hoard of Trus

the coming year. Miss Alice Butcher
and A. S. Hayes were appointed as the
flower committee.
Nineteen-sixteen has also been well
represented in women's activities. In
athletics, Madeleine Turner, Maud

world, but each, no matter how dis

always look back to the years spent
so beneficially and enjoyably at Stan

Danny Carroll.
This week marks a period of tran
sition for the class of 1916. We, as a

class, cease to be a
unit in undergrad
uate affairs, and as
sume for evermore
our role as alumni
of Stanford Univer
sity. We will be
glad to take our
places in the world,
but iv is with the
keenest regret that
we bid farewell to

life on the Stanford "Farm." Truly
this is a most proper time for remin
iscences. Let us now consider the
events of the past four years in which
our class and its members have been
so actively engaged.
It was during the last week in Aug
ust, 1912, that we came to Stanford
University to make up the Freshman
class, the class of 1916. We always
point with pride to those first days
of our existence at the University,
especially to the victory over the class
of 1915 in the annual underclass tie
up. We also like to add that this is
the first and only time that a fresh
man class has ever won this event.
We soon adapted ourselves to our
new environment, becoming infused
with that intangible, yet very real
something known as "Stanford Spirit."
Charles K. Field has expressed it as
"Loyalty to Stanford, to the whole
University."
To the 1912 varsity football team,
we contributed Joe Urban, who did
more than his share at right wing in
the famous 3-3 mud-tie with Califor
nia on November 11. Our class foot
ball team was composed of Stephen
son, Dunn, Butterfield, Edwards,
Dubendorff, Braden, Hayes, Cass,
Mackall, McCray, Murray, Lammiman,
Captain Urban, Dingley, Campbell,
Laine, Adams, and Brown.
Nineteen-sixteen played an import
ant role in the victories won by Stan
ford in the spring of 1913. In the
track meet with California, "Herb"
Whitted, "Skin" Wilson, "Feg" Mur
ray, "Bob" Krohn and "Jack" Tufts
were point winners for the Cardinal
which won by the close margin of
two-fifths of a point. These men and
others won the interclass meet for us
that season. The 1916 Freshman
crew, Wood, Oyster, Jones, Hamaker,
Green ,Orme, Long, Captain Worth,
and Coxswain Goodman, was one of
the best that ever defeated a first
year eight from across the bay.
"Peg" Morosco was the first speaker
for Stanford in the intercollegiate de

hands. In Dr. Branner the Univer
sity obtained an executive who, like
his predecessor, has grown gray in
the service. He also, belonged to the
"old guard" of the faculty, men who
won the admiration of every genera
tion of Stanford men and women.
On October 31, we saw the last
"Plug Ugly" show to be given at
Stanford University, for a little over
a month later, on December 4, the up
perclass rush and everything that
went with it was abolished by an act
of the University Conference.
In the early part of the spring se
mester, 1916 produced her sophomore
play, "The Fortune Hunter." It was
a brilliant success from the critic's
standpoint, but a failure financially.
Perhaps the name had something to
do with that.
Next fall we returned to proudly
take our places as upperclassmen.
We now felt that we were a most im
portant part of the community, but
something happened which "took us
down a few notches." The "Plug
Ugly" and the Senior-Junior poster
fight had been reinstated by popular
vote of the upperclassmen, and this
"something" happened in connection
with the latter. We had bested 1915
regularly in the underclass clashes,
and felt confident that we could do it
again. Our rivals, however, had
tasted the bitter cup of defeat, and
they now planned their revenge. It
was well planned, too, and as a re
sult, most of nineteen-sixteen's husk
ies spent the night in stocks at the
Beta house as prisoners of the sen
iors. We won the rush through the
Quad the following night, but this
victory hardly offset the humiliation
of the night before.
At the end of the two years from
when Dr. Branner was installed, no
one had been chosen to succeed him,
and he gratiously consented to serve
for another year, or until his suc
cessor could be named. On October
12, 1915, the Board of Trustees of the
University announced that Dr. Ray

Lyman Wilbur, Dean of the Stanford
Medical School, and a Stanford grad
uate with the class of 1896, had been
chosen to fill the honored position.
Dr. Wilbur assumed office and was
formally installed on January 22. Dr.
Branner at that time became the
President Emeritus of the University.
The 1916 Junior Week, including the
opera, "At the Dragon's Eye," the
Prom in Encina Hall, and the usual
lake sports at Lagunita, was voted a
success by all, even though rainy
weather prevented some of the events
scheduled.
A month later came the break with
the University of California, the most
serious difficulty which has ever
arisen between the greatest universi
ties of the Golden State. On the
morning of April 23, 1915, the stu
dents of the University of California
sent the following resolution to Stan
ford: "That we will not engage in
intercollegiate varsity contests with
Stanford University except under the
express agreement that the freshman
eligibility rule shall be one of the
conditions to govern said contests."
A compromise was finally negotia
ted on February 3, 1916, and inter
collegiate competition was immediate
ly resumed in every sport except
football, California having returned to
the American game. Stanford accept
ed the freshman ineligibility rule,
while California agreed to raise the
scholarship requirements for athletic
competition, and not to use men from
her affiliated colleges. Everyone re
joiced at this declaration of peace.
The next step is the solution of the
football problem. A return to the
American game of football was pro
posed, but was not ratified by the stu
dents by popular vote.
In the four years which we have
spent at Stanford University, we have
seen the Cardinal teams win the ma
jority of contests with California.
We have never seen a California in
tercollegiate victory in varsity foot
ball, track or crew. In our fresh
man year we witnessed the 3-3 tie
football game played after a storm,
following year, 1913, the Cardinal won
on a field of mud and water. The
by a score of 13-8, and in 1914, by a
score of 26-8. The Big Game of 1915
was played with the University of
Santa Clara, and Stanford won, 30-0,
The intercollegiate track meet
staged in the spring semester of our
first year went to Stanford by the
close score of 61 1-5 to 60 4-5. The
score of the 1914 meet was 66 5-6 to
55 1-6, while that of the 1915 meet was
62-60. Stanford won the Big Meet
this year, 1916, 69-53.
The Cardinal crew invaded the east
in the summer of 1915,and in the
famous annual Poughkeepsie regatta
on the Hudson came in half a boat
length behind the victorious Cornell

shell, defeating the eights of Syracuse,
Columbia, and Pennsylvania.
In baseball, Stanford has not been
so successful, and during the past
four years has won but one intercol
legiate series with California. Fresh
man intercollegiate competition was
resumed in the spring of 1916. The
Cardinal first-year teams were vic
torious in basketball, but lost the
contests in track, baseball, and crew.
This was the first defeat in freshman
crew since 1904.
The class of 191G has been well rep
resented in every branch of student
activities. In football, Danny Carroll,
Joe Braden, and Joe Urban, have
been our mainstays. Carroll was
captain of the 1915 team, while
Braden has been chosen to lead the
team of next year. Urban has played
consistently at wing for four years,
thereoy winning tne four star distinc
tion.
We have been exceptionally well
represented in track by "Skin" Wil
son In the mile, "Herb" Whitted and
Johnny Norton in the hurdles, and
"Feg" Murray in the sprints and
hurdles, Derrol Chace in the quarter,
Bob Krohn in the pole vault, Verne
King in the hammer throw, and Harry
Lachmund in the high jump. Murray
and Wilson have made their four
stars. Nineteen-sixteen won the in
terclass track meet in both freshman
and senior years.
"Doc" Hayes, pitcher and first
baseman; Bill Noonan and Don Day,
outfielders; "Canary" Campbell and
"Joe" Braden, utility men, are our
representatives who have made their
varsity "S's" in baseball. Hayes will
be captain of the varsity nine next
year.
In crew, 1916 has been well to the
fore with such stalwarts as "Chick"
Orme, "Baldy" Green, Fred Worth,
and Coxswain Johnny Goodman. Orme
was captain of this year's eight.
Nineteen-sixteen has been well rep
resented in dramatics. Terese Dor
rob, Marion Vaughan, Irma Rayburn,
Irene Rowlands, Alice Butcher, Doro
thy Egbert, Buford Williams, Dick
Morgan, Wilmer Gross, Frank Camp
bell, Bob Krohn, Wallace Curtis,
"Baldy" Leland, Leo Dayton and
Johnny Phillips have each taken an
active part in the local productions.
The class has also taken an active
interest in literary work. Paul Stam
ford and Ray Wakefield have each
served as editor-in-chief of The Daily
Palo Alto, while Wilmer Gross has
been managing editor. Glenn Hughes
and "Hip" Levy have edited Sequoia
and The Chaparral respectively.
"Peg" Morosco, Frank Elden, Al.
I Hettinger, Art Johnson, Corson Ide,
Kaufman, English, and Fribley have
distinguished themselves in debating.
The coveted Phi Beta Kappa key

members of the class. They are the

recently named by the Hoard of Trus

the coming year. Miss Alice Butcher
and A. S. Hayes were appointed as the
flower committee.
Nineteen-sixteen has also been well
represented in women's activities. In
athletics, Madeleine Turner, Maud

always look back to the years spent
so beneficially and enjoyably at Stan

Danny Carroll.
This week marks a period of tran
sition for the class of 1916. We, as a

class, cease to be a
unit in undergrad
uate affairs, and as
sume for evermore
our role as alumni
of Stanford Univer
sity. We will be
glad to take our
places in the world,
but iv is with the
keenest regret that
we bid farewell to

life on the Stanford "Farm." Truly
this is a most proper time for remin
iscences. Let us now consider the
events of the past four years in which
our class and its members have been
so actively engaged.
It was during the last week in Aug
ust, 1912, that we came to Stanford
University to make up the Freshman
class, the class of 1916. We always
point with pride to those first days
of our existence at the University,
especially to the victory over the class
of 1915 in the annual underclass tie
up. We also like to add that this is
the first and only time that a fresh
man class has ever won this event.
We soon adapted ourselves to our
new environment, becoming infused
with that intangible, yet very real
something known as "Stanford Spirit."
Charles K. Field has expressed it as
"Loyalty to Stanford, to the whole
University."
To the 1912 varsity football team,
we contributed Joe Urban, who did
more than his share at right wing in
the famous 3-3 mud-tie with Califor
nia on November 11. Our class foot
ball team was composed of Stephen
son, Dunn, Butterfield, Edwards,
Dubendorff, Braden, Hayes, Cass,
Mackall, McCray, Murray, Lammiman,
Captain Urban, Dingley, Campbell,
Laine, Adams, and Brown.
Nineteen-sixteen played an import
ant role in the victories won by Stan
ford in the spring of 1913. In the
track meet with California, "Herb"
Whitted, "Skin" Wilson, "Feg" Mur
ray, "Bob" Krohn and "Jack" Tufts
were point winners for the Cardinal
which won by the close margin of
two-fifths of a point. These men and
others won the interclass meet for us
that season. The 1916 Freshman
crew, Wood, Oyster, Jones, Hamaker,
Green ,Orme, Long, Captain Worth,
and Coxswain Goodman, was one of
the best that ever defeated a first
year eight from across the bay.
"Peg" Morosco was the first speaker
for Stanford in the intercollegiate de
bate which was decided in favor of
the Cardinal. Morosco and Hettinger
composed the affirmative Tri-State
team that year. The victory of the
Freshman-Sophomore debate went to
the first-year speakers, Charlie Cook,

Frank Elden, and Al. Hettinger.
During the first semester of our
sophomore year, on October 1, 1913,
we saw Dr. John Casper Branner in
stalled as President of Stanford Uni
versity, to succeed Dr. David Starr
.Jordan, who was given the honorary
position of Chancellor, an office es
pecially created for him. At this
time, Dr. Branner expressed his in
tention to remain in office for but two
years, when he should become sixty
five years of age.
Much of Stanford's success, and
many of the ideals for which the
University stands have been due to
the untiring labor of Chancellor .Jor
dan. He has given many of the best
years of his life to the great work
which the founders, Senator and Mrs.
Stanford, so confidently left in his
hands. In Dr. Branner the Univer
sity obtained an executive who, like
his predecessor, has grown gray in
the service. He also, belonged to the
"old guard" of the faculty, men who
won the admiration of every genera
tion of Stanford men and women.

"Plug Ugly" show to be given at

regularly in the underclass clashes,
and felt confident that we could do it
again. Our rivals, however, had
tasted the bitter cup of defeat, and
they now planned their revenge. It
was well planned, too, and as a re
sult, most of nineteen-sixteen's husk
ies spent the night in stocks at the
Beta house as prisoners of the sen
iors. We won the rush through the
Quad the following night, but this
victory hardly offset the humiliation
of the night before.
At the end of the two years from
when Dr. Branner was installed, no
one had been chosen to succeed him,
and he gratiously consented to serve
for another year, or until his suc
cessor could be named. On October
12, 1915, the Board of Trustees of the
University announced that Dr. Ray

Lyman Wilbur, Dean of the Stanford
Medical School, and a Stanford grad
uate with the class of 1896, had been
chosen to fill the honored position.
Dr. Wilbur assumed office and was
formally installed on January 22. Dr.
Branner at that time became the
President Emeritus of the University.
The 1916 Junior Week, including the
opera, "At the Dragon's Eye," the
Prom in Encina Hall, and the usual
lake sports at Lagunita, was voted a
success by all, even though rainy
weather prevented some of the events
scheduled.
A month later came the break with
the University of California, the most
serious difficulty which has ever
arisen between the greatest universi
ties of the Golden State. On the
morning of April 23, 1915, the stu
dents of the University of California
sent the following resolution to Stan
ford: "That we will not engage in
intercollegiate varsity contests with
Stanford University except under the
express agreement that the freshman
eligibility rule shall be one of the
conditions to govern said contests."
A compromise was finally negotia
ted on February 3, 1916, and inter
collegiate competition was immediate
ly resumed in every sport except
football, California having returned to
the American game. Stanford accept
ed the freshman ineligibility rule,
while California agreed to raise the
scholarship requirements for athletic
competition, and not to use men from
her affiliated colleges. Everyone re
joiced at this declaration of peace.
The next step is the solution of the
football problem. A return to the
American game of football was pro
posed, but was not ratified by the stu
dents by popular vote.
In the four years which we have
spent at Stanford University, we have
seen the Cardinal teams win the ma
jority of contests with California.
We have never seen a California in
tercollegiate victory in varsity foot
ball, track or crew. In our fresh
man year we witnessed the 3-3 tie
football game played after a storm,
following year, 1913, the Cardinal won
on a field of mud and water. The
by a score of 13-8, and in 1914, by a
score of 26-8. The Big Game of 1915
was played with the University of
Santa Clara, and Stanford won, 30-0,
The intercollegiate track meet
staged in the spring semester of our
first year went to Stanford by the
close score of 61 1-5 to 60 4-5. The
score of the 1914 meet was 66 5-6 to
55 1-6, while that of the 1915 meet was
62-60. Stanford won the Big Meet
this year, 1916, 69-53.
The Cardinal crew invaded the east
in the summer of 1915,and in the
famous annual Poughkeepsie regatta
on the Hudson came in half a boat
length behind the victorious Cornell

shell, defeating the eights of Syracuse,
Columbia, and Pennsylvania.
In baseball, Stanford has not been
so successful, and during the past
four years has won but one intercol
legiate series with California. Fresh
man intercollegiate competition was
resumed in the spring of 1916. The
Cardinal first-year teams were vic
torious in basketball, but lost the
contests in track, baseball, and crew.
This was the first defeat in freshman
crew since 1904.
The class of 191G has been well rep
resented in every branch of student
activities. In football, Danny Carroll,
Joe Braden, and Joe Urban, have
been our mainstays. Carroll was
captain of the 1915 team, while
Braden has been chosen to lead the
team of next year. Urban has played
consistently at wing for four years,
thereoy winning tne four star distinc
tion.
We have been exceptionally well
represented in track by "Skin" Wil
son In the mile, "Herb" Whitted and
Johnny Norton in the hurdles, and
"Feg" Murray in the sprints and
hurdles, Derrol Chace in the quarter,
Bob Krohn in the pole vault, Verne
King in the hammer throw, and Harry
Lachmund in the high jump. Murray
and Wilson have made their four
stars. Nineteen-sixteen won the in
terclass track meet in both freshman
and senior years.
"Doc" Hayes, pitcher and first
baseman; Bill Noonan and Don Day,
outfielders; "Canary" Campbell and
"Joe" Braden, utility men, are our
representatives who have made their
varsity "S's" in baseball. Hayes will
be captain of the varsity nine next
year.
In crew, 1916 has been well to the
fore with such stalwarts as "Chick"
Orme, "Baldy" Green, Fred Worth,
and Coxswain Johnny Goodman. Orme
was captain of this year's eight.
Nineteen-sixteen has been well rep
resented in dramatics. Terese Dor
rob, Marion Vaughan, Irma Rayburn,
Irene Rowlands, Alice Butcher, Doro
thy Egbert, Buford Williams, Dick
Morgan, Wilmer Gross, Frank Camp
bell, Bob Krohn, Wallace Curtis,
"Baldy" Leland, Leo Dayton and
Johnny Phillips have each taken an
active part in the local productions.
The class has also taken an active
interest in literary work. Paul Stam
ford and Ray Wakefield have each
served as editor-in-chief of The Daily
Palo Alto, while Wilmer Gross has
been managing editor. Glenn Hughes
and "Hip" Levy have edited Sequoia
and The Chaparral respectively.
"Peg" Morosco, Frank Elden, Al.
I Hettinger, Art Johnson, Corson Ide,

Nineteen-sixteen has also been well
represented in women's activities. In

always look back to the years spent
so beneficially and enjoyably at Stan

Danny Carroll.
This week marks a period of tran
sition for the class of 1916. We, as a

class, cease to be a
unit in undergrad
uate affairs, and as
sume for evermore
our role as alumni
of Stanford Univer
sity. We will be
glad to take our
places in the world,
but iv is with the
keenest regret that
we bid farewell to

life on the Stanford "Farm." Truly
this is a most proper time for remin
iscences. Let us now consider the
events of the past four years in which
our class and its members have been
so actively engaged.
It was during the last week in Aug
ust, 1912, that we came to Stanford
University to make up the Freshman
class, the class of 1916. We always
point with pride to those first days
of our existence at the University,
especially to the victory over the class
of 1915 in the annual underclass tie
up. We also like to add that this is
the first and only time that a fresh
man class has ever won this event.
We soon adapted ourselves to our
new environment, becoming infused
with that intangible, yet very real
something known as "Stanford Spirit."
Charles K. Field has expressed it as
"Loyalty to Stanford, to the whole
University."
To the 1912 varsity football team,
we contributed Joe Urban, who did
more than his share at right wing in
the famous 3-3 mud-tie with Califor
nia on November 11. Our class foot
ball team was composed of Stephen
son, Dunn, Butterfield, Edwards,
Dubendorff, Braden, Hayes, Cass,
Mackall, McCray, Murray, Lammiman,
Captain Urban, Dingley, Campbell,
Laine, Adams, and Brown.
Nineteen-sixteen played an import
ant role in the victories won by Stan
ford in the spring of 1913. In the
track meet with California, "Herb"
Whitted, "Skin" Wilson, "Feg" Mur
ray, "Bob" Krohn and "Jack" Tufts
were point winners for the Cardinal
which won by the close margin of
two-fifths of a point. These men and
others won the interclass meet for us
that season. The 1916 Freshman
crew, Wood, Oyster, Jones, Hamaker,
Green ,Orme, Long, Captain Worth,
and Coxswain Goodman, was one of
the best that ever defeated a first
year eight from across the bay.
"Peg" Morosco was the first speaker
for Stanford in the intercollegiate de
bate which was decided in favor of
the Cardinal. Morosco and Hettinger
composed the affirmative Tri-State
team that year. The victory of the
Freshman-Sophomore debate went to
the first-year speakers, Charlie Cook,

Frank Elden, and Al. Hettinger.
During the first semester of our
sophomore year, on October 1, 1913,
we saw Dr. John Casper Branner in
stalled as President of Stanford Uni
versity, to succeed Dr. David Starr
.Jordan, who was given the honorary
position of Chancellor, an office es
pecially created for him. At this
time, Dr. Branner expressed his in
tention to remain in office for but two
years, when he should become sixty
five years of age.
Much of Stanford's success, and
many of the ideals for which the
University stands have been due to
the untiring labor of Chancellor .Jor
dan. He has given many of the best
years of his life to the great work
which the founders, Senator and Mrs.
Stanford, so confidently left in his
hands. In Dr. Branner the Univer
sity obtained an executive who, like
his predecessor, has grown gray in
the service. He also, belonged to the
"old guard" of the faculty, men who
won the admiration of every genera
tion of Stanford men and women.
On October 31, we saw the last
"Plug Ugly" show to be given at
Stanford University, for a little over
a month later, on December 4, the up
perclass rush and everything that
went with it was abolished by an act
of the University Conference.
In the early part of the spring se
mester, 1916 produced her sophomore
play, "The Fortune Hunter." It was
a brilliant success from the critic's
standpoint, but a failure financially.
Perhaps the name had something to
do with that.
Next fall we returned to proudly
take our places as upperclassmen.
We now felt that we were a most im
portant part of the community, but
something happened which "took us
down a few notches." The "Plug
Ugly" and the Senior-Junior poster
fight had been reinstated by popular
vote of the upperclassmen, and this
"something" happened in connection
with the latter. We had bested 1915
regularly in the underclass clashes,
and felt confident that we could do it
again. Our rivals, however, had
tasted the bitter cup of defeat, and
they now planned their revenge. It
was well planned, too, and as a re
sult, most of nineteen-sixteen's husk
ies spent the night in stocks at the
Beta house as prisoners of the sen
iors. We won the rush through the

of the night before.

opera, "At the Dragon's Eye," the
Prom in Encina Hall, and the usual
lake sports at Lagunita, was voted a
success by all, even though rainy
weather prevented some of the events
scheduled.
A month later came the break with
the University of California, the most
serious difficulty which has ever
arisen between the greatest universi
ties of the Golden State. On the
morning of April 23, 1915, the stu
dents of the University of California
sent the following resolution to Stan
ford: "That we will not engage in
intercollegiate varsity contests with
Stanford University except under the
express agreement that the freshman
eligibility rule shall be one of the
conditions to govern said contests."
A compromise was finally negotia
ted on February 3, 1916, and inter
collegiate competition was immediate
ly resumed in every sport except
football, California having returned to
the American game. Stanford accept
ed the freshman ineligibility rule,
while California agreed to raise the
scholarship requirements for athletic
competition, and not to use men from
her affiliated colleges. Everyone re
joiced at this declaration of peace.
The next step is the solution of the
football problem. A return to the
American game of football was pro
posed, but was not ratified by the stu
dents by popular vote.
In the four years which we have
spent at Stanford University, we have
seen the Cardinal teams win the ma
jority of contests with California.
We have never seen a California in
tercollegiate victory in varsity foot
ball, track or crew. In our fresh
man year we witnessed the 3-3 tie
football game played after a storm,
following year, 1913, the Cardinal won
on a field of mud and water. The
by a score of 13-8, and in 1914, by a
score of 26-8. The Big Game of 1915
was played with the University of
Santa Clara, and Stanford won, 30-0,
The intercollegiate track meet
staged in the spring semester of our
first year went to Stanford by the
close score of 61 1-5 to 60 4-5. The
score of the 1914 meet was 66 5-6 to
55 1-6, while that of the 1915 meet was
62-60. Stanford won the Big Meet
this year, 1916, 69-53.
The Cardinal crew invaded the east
in the summer of 1915,and in the
famous annual Poughkeepsie regatta
on the Hudson came in half a boat
length behind the victorious Cornell

shell, defeating the eights of Syracuse,
Columbia, and Pennsylvania.
In baseball, Stanford has not been
so successful, and during the past
four years has won but one intercol
legiate series with California. Fresh
man intercollegiate competition was
resumed in the spring of 1916. The
Cardinal first-year teams were vic
torious in basketball, but lost the
contests in track, baseball, and crew.
This was the first defeat in freshman
crew since 1904.
The class of 191G has been well rep
resented in every branch of student
activities. In football, Danny Carroll,
Joe Braden, and Joe Urban, have
been our mainstays. Carroll was
captain of the 1915 team, while
Braden has been chosen to lead the
team of next year. Urban has played
consistently at wing for four years,
thereoy winning tne four star distinc
tion.
We have been exceptionally well
represented in track by "Skin" Wil
son In the mile, "Herb" Whitted and
Johnny Norton in the hurdles, and
"Feg" Murray in the sprints and
hurdles, Derrol Chace in the quarter,
Bob Krohn in the pole vault, Verne
King in the hammer throw, and Harry
Lachmund in the high jump. Murray
and Wilson have made their four
stars. Nineteen-sixteen won the in
terclass track meet in both freshman
and senior years.
"Doc" Hayes, pitcher and first
baseman; Bill Noonan and Don Day,
outfielders; "Canary" Campbell and
"Joe" Braden, utility men, are our
representatives who have made their
varsity "S's" in baseball. Hayes will
be captain of the varsity nine next
year.
In crew, 1916 has been well to the
fore with such stalwarts as "Chick"
Orme, "Baldy" Green, Fred Worth,
and Coxswain Johnny Goodman. Orme
was captain of this year's eight.
Nineteen-sixteen has been well rep
resented in dramatics. Terese Dor
rob, Marion Vaughan, Irma Rayburn,
Irene Rowlands, Alice Butcher, Doro
thy Egbert, Buford Williams, Dick
Morgan, Wilmer Gross, Frank Camp
bell, Bob Krohn, Wallace Curtis,
"Baldy" Leland, Leo Dayton and
Johnny Phillips have each taken an
active part in the local productions.
The class has also taken an active
interest in literary work. Paul Stam
ford and Ray Wakefield have each
served as editor-in-chief of The Daily
Palo Alto, while Wilmer Gross has
been managing editor. Glenn Hughes
and "Hip" Levy have edited Sequoia
and The Chaparral respectively.
"Peg" Morosco, Frank Elden, Al.
I Hettinger, Art Johnson, Corson Ide,

world, but each, no matter how dis

always look back to the years spent
so beneficially and enjoyably at Stan

Danny Carroll.
This week marks a period of tran
sition for the class of 1916. We, as a

class, cease to be a
unit in undergrad
uate affairs, and as
sume for evermore
our role as alumni
of Stanford Univer
sity. We will be
glad to take our
places in the world,
but iv is with the
keenest regret that
we bid farewell to

life on the Stanford "Farm." Truly
this is a most proper time for remin
iscences. Let us now consider the
events of the past four years in which
our class and its members have been
so actively engaged.
It was during the last week in Aug
ust, 1912, that we came to Stanford
University to make up the Freshman
class, the class of 1916. We always
point with pride to those first days
of our existence at the University,
especially to the victory over the class
of 1915 in the annual underclass tie
up. We also like to add that this is
the first and only time that a fresh
man class has ever won this event.
We soon adapted ourselves to our
new environment, becoming infused
with that intangible, yet very real
something known as "Stanford Spirit."
Charles K. Field has expressed it as
"Loyalty to Stanford, to the whole
University."
To the 1912 varsity football team,
we contributed Joe Urban, who did
more than his share at right wing in
the famous 3-3 mud-tie with Califor
nia on November 11. Our class foot
ball team was composed of Stephen
son, Dunn, Butterfield, Edwards,
Dubendorff, Braden, Hayes, Cass,
Mackall, McCray, Murray, Lammiman,
Captain Urban, Dingley, Campbell,
Laine, Adams, and Brown.
Nineteen-sixteen played an import
ant role in the victories won by Stan
ford in the spring of 1913. In the
track meet with California, "Herb"
Whitted, "Skin" Wilson, "Feg" Mur
ray, "Bob" Krohn and "Jack" Tufts
were point winners for the Cardinal
which won by the close margin of
two-fifths of a point. These men and
others won the interclass meet for us
that season. The 1916 Freshman
crew, Wood, Oyster, Jones, Hamaker,
Green ,Orme, Long, Captain Worth,
and Coxswain Goodman, was one of
the best that ever defeated a first
year eight from across the bay.
"Peg" Morosco was the first speaker
for Stanford in the intercollegiate de
bate which was decided in favor of
the Cardinal. Morosco and Hettinger
composed the affirmative Tri-State
team that year. The victory of the
Freshman-Sophomore debate went to
the first-year speakers, Charlie Cook,

Frank Elden, and Al. Hettinger.
During the first semester of our
sophomore year, on October 1, 1913,
we saw Dr. John Casper Branner in
stalled as President of Stanford Uni
versity, to succeed Dr. David Starr
.Jordan, who was given the honorary
position of Chancellor, an office es
pecially created for him. At this
time, Dr. Branner expressed his in
tention to remain in office for but two
years, when he should become sixty
five years of age.
Much of Stanford's success, and
many of the ideals for which the
University stands have been due to
the untiring labor of Chancellor .Jor
dan. He has given many of the best
years of his life to the great work
which the founders, Senator and Mrs.
Stanford, so confidently left in his
hands. In Dr. Branner the Univer
sity obtained an executive who, like
his predecessor, has grown gray in
the service. He also, belonged to the
"old guard" of the faculty, men who
won the admiration of every genera
tion of Stanford men and women.
On October 31, we saw the last
"Plug Ugly" show to be given at
Stanford University, for a little over
a month later, on December 4, the up
perclass rush and everything that
went with it was abolished by an act
of the University Conference.
In the early part of the spring se
mester, 1916 produced her sophomore
play, "The Fortune Hunter." It was
a brilliant success from the critic's
standpoint, but a failure financially.
Perhaps the name had something to
do with that.
Next fall we returned to proudly
take our places as upperclassmen.
We now felt that we were a most im
portant part of the community, but
something happened which "took us
down a few notches." The "Plug
Ugly" and the Senior-Junior poster
fight had been reinstated by popular
vote of the upperclassmen, and this
"something" happened in connection
with the latter. We had bested 1915
regularly in the underclass clashes,
and felt confident that we could do it
again. Our rivals, however, had
tasted the bitter cup of defeat, and
they now planned their revenge. It
was well planned, too, and as a re
sult, most of nineteen-sixteen's husk
ies spent the night in stocks at the
Beta house as prisoners of the sen
iors. We won the rush through the
Quad the following night, but this
victory hardly offset the humiliation
of the night before.
At the end of the two years from
when Dr. Branner was installed, no
one had been chosen to succeed him,
and he gratiously consented to serve
for another year, or until his suc
cessor could be named. On October
12, 1915, the Board of Trustees of the
University announced that Dr. Ray

Lyman Wilbur, Dean of the Stanford
Medical School, and a Stanford grad
uate with the class of 1896, had been
chosen to fill the honored position.
Dr. Wilbur assumed office and was
formally installed on January 22. Dr.
Branner at that time became the
President Emeritus of the University.
The 1916 Junior Week, including the
opera, "At the Dragon's Eye," the
Prom in Encina Hall, and the usual
lake sports at Lagunita, was voted a
success by all, even though rainy
weather prevented some of the events

posed, but was not ratified by the stu
dents by popular vote.
In the four years which we have
spent at Stanford University, we have
seen the Cardinal teams win the ma
jority of contests with California.
We have never seen a California in
tercollegiate victory in varsity foot
ball, track or crew. In our fresh
man year we witnessed the 3-3 tie
football game played after a storm,
following year, 1913, the Cardinal won
on a field of mud and water. The
by a score of 13-8, and in 1914, by a
score of 26-8. The Big Game of 1915
was played with the University of
Santa Clara, and Stanford won, 30-0,
The intercollegiate track meet
staged in the spring semester of our
first year went to Stanford by the
close score of 61 1-5 to 60 4-5. The
score of the 1914 meet was 66 5-6 to
55 1-6, while that of the 1915 meet was
62-60. Stanford won the Big Meet
this year, 1916, 69-53.
The Cardinal crew invaded the east
in the summer of 1915,and in the
famous annual Poughkeepsie regatta
on the Hudson came in half a boat
length behind the victorious Cornell

shell, defeating the eights of Syracuse,
Columbia, and Pennsylvania.
In baseball, Stanford has not been
so successful, and during the past
four years has won but one intercol
legiate series with California. Fresh
man intercollegiate competition was
resumed in the spring of 1916. The
Cardinal first-year teams were vic
torious in basketball, but lost the
contests in track, baseball, and crew.
This was the first defeat in freshman
crew since 1904.
The class of 191G has been well rep
resented in every branch of student
activities. In football, Danny Carroll,
Joe Braden, and Joe Urban, have
been our mainstays. Carroll was
captain of the 1915 team, while
Braden has been chosen to lead the
team of next year. Urban has played
consistently at wing for four years,
thereoy winning tne four star distinc
tion.
We have been exceptionally well
represented in track by "Skin" Wil
son In the mile, "Herb" Whitted and
Johnny Norton in the hurdles, and
"Feg" Murray in the sprints and
hurdles, Derrol Chace in the quarter,
Bob Krohn in the pole vault, Verne
King in the hammer throw, and Harry
Lachmund in the high jump. Murray
and Wilson have made their four
stars. Nineteen-sixteen won the in
terclass track meet in both freshman
and senior years.
"Doc" Hayes, pitcher and first
baseman; Bill Noonan and Don Day,
outfielders; "Canary" Campbell and
"Joe" Braden, utility men, are our
representatives who have made their
varsity "S's" in baseball. Hayes will
be captain of the varsity nine next
year.
In crew, 1916 has been well to the
fore with such stalwarts as "Chick"
Orme, "Baldy" Green, Fred Worth,
and Coxswain Johnny Goodman. Orme
was captain of this year's eight.
Nineteen-sixteen has been well rep
resented in dramatics. Terese Dor

Irene Rowlands, Alice Butcher, Doro
thy Egbert, Buford Williams, Dick
Morgan, Wilmer Gross, Frank Camp
bell, Bob Krohn, Wallace Curtis,
"Baldy" Leland, Leo Dayton and
Johnny Phillips have each taken an
active part in the local productions.
The class has also taken an active
interest in literary work. Paul Stam
ford and Ray Wakefield have each
served as editor-in-chief of The Daily
Palo Alto, while Wilmer Gross has
been managing editor. Glenn Hughes
and "Hip" Levy have edited Sequoia
and The Chaparral respectively.
"Peg" Morosco, Frank Elden, Al.

always look back to the years spent

Danny Carroll.
This week marks a period of tran
sition for the class of 1916. We, as a

class, cease to be a
unit in undergrad
uate affairs, and as
sume for evermore
our role as alumni
of Stanford Univer
sity. We will be
glad to take our
places in the world,
but iv is with the
keenest regret that
we bid farewell to

life on the Stanford "Farm." Truly
this is a most proper time for remin
iscences. Let us now consider the
events of the past four years in which
our class and its members have been
so actively engaged.
It was during the last week in Aug
ust, 1912, that we came to Stanford
University to make up the Freshman
class, the class of 1916. We always
point with pride to those first days
of our existence at the University,
especially to the victory over the class
of 1915 in the annual underclass tie
up. We also like to add that this is
the first and only time that a fresh
man class has ever won this event.
We soon adapted ourselves to our
new environment, becoming infused
with that intangible, yet very real
something known as "Stanford Spirit."
Charles K. Field has expressed it as
"Loyalty to Stanford, to the whole
University."
To the 1912 varsity football team,
we contributed Joe Urban, who did
more than his share at right wing in
the famous 3-3 mud-tie with Califor
nia on November 11. Our class foot
ball team was composed of Stephen
son, Dunn, Butterfield, Edwards,
Dubendorff, Braden, Hayes, Cass,
Mackall, McCray, Murray, Lammiman,
Captain Urban, Dingley, Campbell,
Laine, Adams, and Brown.
Nineteen-sixteen played an import
ant role in the victories won by Stan
ford in the spring of 1913. In the
track meet with California, "Herb"
Whitted, "Skin" Wilson, "Feg" Mur
ray, "Bob" Krohn and "Jack" Tufts
were point winners for the Cardinal
which won by the close margin of
two-fifths of a point. These men and
others won the interclass meet for us
that season. The 1916 Freshman
crew, Wood, Oyster, Jones, Hamaker,
Green ,Orme, Long, Captain Worth,
and Coxswain Goodman, was one of
the best that ever defeated a first
year eight from across the bay.
"Peg" Morosco was the first speaker
for Stanford in the intercollegiate de
bate which was decided in favor of
the Cardinal. Morosco and Hettinger
composed the affirmative Tri-State
team that year. The victory of the
Freshman-Sophomore debate went to
the first-year speakers, Charlie Cook,

Frank Elden, and Al. Hettinger.
During the first semester of our
sophomore year, on October 1, 1913,
we saw Dr. John Casper Branner in
stalled as President of Stanford Uni
versity, to succeed Dr. David Starr
.Jordan, who was given the honorary
position of Chancellor, an office es
pecially created for him. At this
time, Dr. Branner expressed his in
tention to remain in office for but two
years, when he should become sixty
five years of age.
Much of Stanford's success, and
many of the ideals for which the
University stands have been due to
the untiring labor of Chancellor .Jor
dan. He has given many of the best
years of his life to the great work
which the founders, Senator and Mrs.
Stanford, so confidently left in his
hands. In Dr. Branner the Univer
sity obtained an executive who, like
his predecessor, has grown gray in
the service. He also, belonged to the
"old guard" of the faculty, men who
won the admiration of every genera
tion of Stanford men and women.
On October 31, we saw the last
"Plug Ugly" show to be given at
Stanford University, for a little over
a month later, on December 4, the up
perclass rush and everything that
went with it was abolished by an act
of the University Conference.
In the early part of the spring se
mester, 1916 produced her sophomore
play, "The Fortune Hunter." It was
a brilliant success from the critic's
standpoint, but a failure financially.
Perhaps the name had something to
do with that.
Next fall we returned to proudly
take our places as upperclassmen.
We now felt that we were a most im
portant part of the community, but
something happened which "took us
down a few notches." The "Plug
Ugly" and the Senior-Junior poster
fight had been reinstated by popular
vote of the upperclassmen, and this
"something" happened in connection
with the latter. We had bested 1915
regularly in the underclass clashes,
and felt confident that we could do it
again. Our rivals, however, had
tasted the bitter cup of defeat, and
they now planned their revenge. It
was well planned, too, and as a re
sult, most of nineteen-sixteen's husk
ies spent the night in stocks at the
Beta house as prisoners of the sen
iors. We won the rush through the
Quad the following night, but this
victory hardly offset the humiliation
of the night before.
At the end of the two years from
when Dr. Branner was installed, no
one had been chosen to succeed him,
and he gratiously consented to serve
for another year, or until his suc
cessor could be named. On October
12, 1915, the Board of Trustees of the
University announced that Dr. Ray

Lyman Wilbur, Dean of the Stanford
Medical School, and a Stanford grad
uate with the class of 1896, had been
chosen to fill the honored position.
Dr. Wilbur assumed office and was
formally installed on January 22. Dr.
Branner at that time became the
President Emeritus of the University.
The 1916 Junior Week, including the
opera, "At the Dragon's Eye," the
Prom in Encina Hall, and the usual
lake sports at Lagunita, was voted a
success by all, even though rainy
weather prevented some of the events
scheduled.
A month later came the break with
the University of California, the most
serious difficulty which has ever
arisen between the greatest universi
ties of the Golden State. On the
morning of April 23, 1915, the stu
dents of the University of California
sent the following resolution to Stan
ford: "That we will not engage in
intercollegiate varsity contests with
Stanford University except under the
express agreement that the freshman
eligibility rule shall be one of the
conditions to govern said contests."
A compromise was finally negotia
ted on February 3, 1916, and inter
collegiate competition was immediate
ly resumed in every sport except
football, California having returned to
the American game. Stanford accept
ed the freshman ineligibility rule,
while California agreed to raise the
scholarship requirements for athletic
competition, and not to use men from
her affiliated colleges. Everyone re
joiced at this declaration of peace.
The next step is the solution of the
football problem. A return to the
American game of football was pro
posed, but was not ratified by the stu
dents by popular vote.
In the four years which we have
spent at Stanford University, we have
seen the Cardinal teams win the ma
jority of contests with California.
We have never seen a California in
tercollegiate victory in varsity foot
ball, track or crew. In our fresh

close score of 61 1-5 to 60 4-5. The
score of the 1914 meet was 66 5-6 to
55 1-6, while that of the 1915 meet was
62-60. Stanford won the Big Meet
this year, 1916, 69-53.
