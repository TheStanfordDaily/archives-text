# DR. JORDAN OUTLINES PRINCIPLES OF ACADEMIC LIFE
## Records Stanford's Success in Bringing the Education of Tomorrow to the Youth of Today by Uniting Essentials of Darwin 
### Chancellor David Starr Jordan 
This day rounds out the first Quar
ter Century of Stanford University,
the best part of a lifetime for me and
for those of my colleagues who gath
ered around me in the early days.
This day I stand before you in some
sense as their spokesman and advo
cate. What account can we render of
our stewardship on the threshold of a
new cycle?
Speaking for myself, who have
been for forty-six years a teacher of
college men and women, I shall not
leave the fairest field of human effort
without profound emotion. But this
1 do not ask you to share. None of us
are here to stay, none of us would
halt, the procession. The old Rou
manian proverb, "Our blood goes over
into the veins of the young," we ac
cept without flinching. Young men
and young universities move faster
than old ones, and in this fact Stan
ford finds part of the secret of her
success.
Outlines Academic Ideal
Something of this success and the
elements which made it I shall try
to set before you today. I shall not
speak again of the founders' wisdom.
I have already on another occasion
recounted, largely in Mr. Stanford's
own words, his sane ideals of educa
tion and his generous plans for carry
ing them into effect. The story of the
six dark years, illuminated and saved
by the devoted loyalty of Mrs. Stan
ford, I have told at still another time
as well as I could. My present task
is to give you some account of the
principles embodied in the academic
life of the institution itself without
reference to particular individuals or
special events.
First of all, Stanford University had
for its basis a lofty moral and spir
itual purpose born of the fair hope
and the fi*ee hand which its founders
held out to us. Moreover, its roman
tic origin at once lifted it out of the
commonplace. Furthermore, as we
dreamed, it was not to duplicate old
successes or older failures, but was
to mark a new era, so we hoped, in
the training of men and women. In
a word, it was to bring the education
of tomorrow straight to the youth of
today.
Unhampered by Tradition
In those marvelous days of creative
opportunity, we were hampered by no
prearranged rule of action. No tra
dition from the old world or the new
laid on us its dead hand. As the
young president standing in the west
end of the Quadrangle proclaimed on
that eventful first day of October,
1891: "Our University has no history
to fall back upon. Xo memories of
great teachers haunt its corridors. In
none of its rooms appear the traces
which show where a great man has
lived and worked. No tender asso
ciations cling, ivy-like, to its fresh
new walls. It is hallowed by no tra
ditions. It is hampered by none. Its
finger posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow, as the
splendid lily from the modest bulb."
To be sure, we had then all the ex

perlence of the world to fall back
upon. But we were to draw our own
conclusions. Nothing forced us to use
it in any specified way. Any method
quantity was found in the ever-vary
ing traits of human nature. And on
the recognition of this infinite variety
our scheme was primarily based.
Every form of talent, we held, was
worthy of training. To develop
strength we must bring out person
ality. To this end we must first have
teachers adequate for their responsi
bilities. A university performs its
function not in what it compels, still
less in what it forbids, but in its pro
vision for intensifying the student's
best abilities.
Organization Second
Organization is a secondary thing.
It will come soon enough. Like age,
it creeps on us unawares. So the
fewer rules the better until rules make
themselves. Under the worst possible
organization, or none at all. great
teachers may do noble work, as the
history of learning clearly shows.
Wherever placed, the great man
leaves a mark on all with whom he
comes in contact. Professor Osborn
of Columbia once refered to the lie
lief that the American college, with
its happy-go-lucky lack of system,
could never produce a Darwin. In
opposition to this view, I claimed that
it could quite as readily as any other
system, given, of course, the raw ma
terial to work upon.
To my mind, in the making or a
great naturalist three things are
necessary: the original material, the
fine human stuff; next, contact with
nature; and finally, the help and ex
ample of a great teacher. These three
factors co-operated in the life of
Darwin. It is clear that Cambridge
and Edinburgh as schools of science,
did not make him. He himself bears
witness to the "incredible dullness"
of the lectures he heard. If that were
all, Stanford University could cer
tainly have done a better job.
Essentials of Greatness
But the first essential, the raw ma
terial, the choice mosaic of germ
plasm—this was already there to work
upon, and this no school could create.
The second element, contact with
nature—a free gift to all who seek it
—Darwin found on the moors of Cam
bridgeshire, by its brooks and its
bridges. In fullest measure, Califor
nia offers the same to all.
As to the third essential, the spell
of a great life, this Cambridge pro
vided. Darwin himself gives the clue.
He says that he "walked with liens
low," and Henslow was one of the
great botanists of bis time. To walk
with Henslow was in itself a gener
ous education. To make possible such
relations is the university's choicest
function. It should furnish the Hens
lows with whom the Darwins may
walk.
For the permanent values of a uni
versity center in its faculty. All the
virtues of mind and soul should be
theirs collectively, and as far as may
be, individually,—friendliness, self-de
votion, intellectual honesty, sincerity
I of purpose, love of work, strength to
; carry it on, accuracy, profundity,

broadmindedness, reverence, refine
ment, above all else, an unshaken and
unshakeable faith in human nature —
each one of these is vitally essential.
This may not all be detected in any
one man or woman, bat they must ap
pear in the composite whole.
Principles of Beginning
Nevertheless, whatever stress may
justly be laid on the personality of
teachers, one must not undervalue de
tails of organization. Traditions there
are that belittle, regulations that
starve or cramp, details that irritate,
and limitations that waste. A uni
versity should be framed for advance
ment. The chambers of its soul
should widen as the years go by.
Whatever bounds it imposes on itself
should be flexible and temporary.
Then as its life grows more complex,
it must frame certain rules of pro
cedure. The value of these rules will
rest on the principle that lies behind
them. Stanford was free to choose its
own educational principles. The four
most fundamental with which we
started were (a) the democracy of
mental powers, (b) the elective sys
tem, (c) the major department ar
rangement, and (d) the vital import
ance of individual initiative as the
prime element in character building.
With these, coeducation and the ap
plication of science were taken as mat
ters of course.
Aim of Quality Chosen
Negatively, we did not believe in
prescribed courses of study, in the
disciplinary value of undigested learn
ing, in promoting scholarship by pro
hibitions, by marks, honors, prizes, or
by financial subsidies as baits in
the educational trap. Furthermore, we
resolved that a university need not be
valued for its bigness, nor even for
the variety of its functions, believing
it better to do a few things well than
to strive weakly to cover the whole
ground of learning. For the ultimate
function of the endowed university
must be differentiated from that of the
state institution. It is the duty of
the latter to minister to all the higher
educational needs of the state. It is
the privilege of the former to set
standards of aim and standards of
achievement.
And further still, we conceived of
university life as an opportunity, to
be looked on as such by all who
came. Those who did not rise to its
stimulus were better somewhere else.
So because the chief source of human
wastage in our republic is the open
saloon, from the first we refused to
enter into rivalry with this, —or any
other institution that fattens on men's
weaknesses. The chains of a vile
habit inhibit wholesome development.
"Free should the scholar be, free and
brave."
Democracy of Mental Powers
Let us go bark to our four prin
ciples of organization, to consider
them in some detail. And here I must
ask the kind indulgence of all whose
fate it has been for a quarter of cen
tury to hear me expound in theory
and in practice the element of free
dom in education. That has been our
watchword. And because from the be

ginning we wished to emphasize the
value of intellectual freedom, of dis
cipline which is self-imposed, not
vouchsafed from above, we chose as
our academic motto the words of Ill
rich von Hutten, spoken four centur
ies ago, "Die Luft der Freheit weht,"
"The winds of freedom are blowing."
Democracy of the mind was the in
spiration of the early days of Cornell
University. Under its lead, we of the
pioneer clas-s of 1872 established our
first college journal. We called it
"The Cornell Era." For it truly
marked a new era in college history
when college men studied engineering
and agriculture along with Greek and
Latin, when even in a literary course
geology and botany might be counted
towards a degree. That such sub
jects could be accepted was the pri
mary reason why I myself went to
Cornell and not to Yale.
Democracy of the mind was not the
discovery of Andrew D. White, its
greatest apostle. No great idea orig
inates perhaps with any one person.
Hut at Cornell it was first developed
in workable fashion. It holds that
all mental powers should be recog
nized as free and equal, each alike
entitled to make the most of itself.
In this spirit, Ezra Cornell had said,
"I would found an institution in which
any person may find instruction in
any study." Indeed, it is not for the
university to foster any aristocracy of
studies. It shall not maintain Latin
or Greek or philosophy or physics, or
anything else, as a primary essential
in education, or that those whose
minds do not turn in some favored
direction shall be left uneducated. All
the powers of the mind, the applica
tion of knowledge as well as its ex
tension and preservation, are the sub
ject-matter of the university.
Elective System Adopted
Such a conception of higher educa
tion naturally finds its expression in
the elective system, which involves
the abandonment of the old idea in
volved in the word "curriculum" or
little race-course, with its low and
high hurdles, its "little go" and its
"great go," around which the student
moved for three or four years, return
ing at commencement for his final re
ward. The more tedious the discip
line, the greater was its supposed
value, and the reward for penance
done lay in the goodfellowship which
common boredom entailed. Under the
pressure of the widening of human
knowledge, the applications of sci
ence and the insistence of human
needs, the American college has
changed its theory in these regards.
The curriculum is no longer a race
course. Its participants do not run in
a circle, but set out in all directions
along widely divergent paths. For
the new appeal of widened helpful
ness has brought into the college new
and variant types of men, with variant
needs. Teachers brought up under the
old regime have generally ill under
stood how to deal with these. Mean
while the new appeal has brought new
popularities and it must be admitted
that many students are sent to the
universites because they have shown
no promise anywhere else.

Two Classes'of Students
College students in general may be
divided into two classes: those who
care and those who don't. Only the
first class need be considered. What
ever the needs of the others, their
place is not in the college. Students
who care may be again divided as to
the impulse, whether volitional or vo
cational, which compels their interest.
The best students in each field are
those who work for the love of it.
They may be classical scholars,
"Greek-minded men or Roman-minded
men," to use Emerson's phrase, or
they may be botanists, anatomists,
physiologists, chemists, teachers, phil
ologists, historians, engineers, econ
omists, physicians or jurists. They
may spring up in any field, and they
work to the limit for the mere joy of
working. The investigators of the
world, those who widen the scope of
knowledge in an appreciable degree,
belong to this class. Every door
should be held wide open for them,
and not one of them should be com
pelled to turn out of his way by the
lure of a.degree.
The vocational impulse has also its
place in the higher training. It may
express itself in perseverance rather
than in enthusiasm. A man will stick
to an uninteresting topic if he can
relate it to the affairs of life. An in
telligent student will always recognize
vocational reasons for pushing onward
to success. This is why the engineer
ing students in our universities are,
broadly speaking, better scholars than
students of literature. They see that
their future depends absolutely on
preparation. They are to deal with
the forces of nature, and nature
brooks no ignorance or deception..
They say at Harvard, "One is a fool
to study in the college; one is a fool
not to study in the law school." It
is a matter of common observation
that in professional schools of high
standards even the idler and the
dilettante may suddenly rise to hon
est work.
Joy in Vocational Training
It is, therefore, not a forward move
ment, for colleges and universities to
turn away from vocational studies in
the interest of pure culture. The vo
cation. however, must not be narrow
ly construed, as a man of force in any
field needs as wide a horizon as the
university can give him. No effort is
wasted if undertaken conscientiously
and with the purpose of adding found
ation on which one's specialty may
rest. Hut without volitional or voca
tional relations, without joy in the
work or hope in its final completion,
a boy would better keep out of col
lege and turn his attention as soon as
possible to something which to him is
real.
In the beginning Stanford Univer
sity adopted the elective system with
open eyes, certain that no other one
made possible the best scholarship.
The old classical course has not
broken down under the pressure of
live subjects and live issues. It rested
on the noble basis of Greek thought
and Greek expression. Its ideal look-
ed backward and upward to the loft
iest achievements of the human race
in the matter of beauty of form, of
language and of thought. As Thoreau
once observed, "Those only talk of
forgetting Greek who never knew it."
To the "Greek-minded man" these four
years in academic shades in company
with gracious thoughts were most sat
isfying and enlarging.
Hut the course was narrow and
special, and some thirty years ago it
began to give place to that condition
of affairs which I have elsewhere
called the "patchwork" stage of the
curriculum. The expansion of the
natural and physical sciences, each
one changing the whole current of
thought in its field; the demands of
French and German literature; a new
attitude towards the movements of
history; the growth of economics, jur
isprudence, modern philosophy, not
safe nor sane perhaps, but drawn
from the study of things as they are,
—all these, one by one or altogether,
clamored for a place in college
courses. Slowly, grudgingly, all were
admitted, crowding out, in greater or
less measure, Greek, calculus and
Latin. Each new subject, like the
camel with its head under the tent,
moved forward to occupy. Each sub
ject, old and new, was squeezed to
the briefest possible compass, though
the new ones were no more compre
hensible than the old. It was clear
before long that not all could be
brought into one uniform course. To
that end several arrangements were
devised, in each of which some edu
cational faction should have its way
But these ill adjusted and shifting
courses were necessarily less special
ized and therefore less thorough than
the old classical one, and as ad
vanced work in one subject has a
greater cultural value than elementary
work in several, so in almost every
regard the patchwork system marked
a step downward.
This period, however, was only one
of transition, and led directly to the
elective system, which made thorough
ness possible in any one of many
lines. In a prescribed course the stu
dent has little or no choice, and yet
the element of choice is in itself a
leading factor in individual training.
A democratic institution should min
ister to all types of men in quest of
higher education. It matters not
through what agency the miracle is
wrought. It may be achieved through
the melting of vanadium steel or by
a study of the satires of Horace.
The structure of the cell-nucleus of
a tadpole is as intricate and may be
as fascinating as that of the British
constitution, or a drama of Euripides.
Under the elective system it is pos
sible for a teacher to do his finest
work. No longer occupied with "the
dregs of learning," as Agassiz once
termed the college course at Harvard,
he can lead the learner and thus lead
himself to the firing lines of science.
With students in earnest, advanced
and thorough work becomes possible.
Such students give the teacher new
life.
Elective System Marks New Growth.
With the enlarged usefulness which
marked the advent of the elective sys
tem twenty to thirty years ago, began
the new growth of the colleges. They
drew men of new kinds, and many
more of them than ever before. This
fresh impulse was dominant in the
early days of Stanford, and a like
stimulus soon gave new life to the
whole university world. Ready-made
courses, the acme of pedagogic lazi
ness, were discarded. Like ready
made clothing, such courses really fit
nobody, and an education, like a suit
of clothes, should be fitted to the man
who is to wear it.
Some criticisms still apply to the
elective system. It has not yet wholly
eliminated "the reluctant student."
Hut can any system do this? No plan
ever made a lazy man brilliant. It is
to the earnest and efficient that the
opportunities of college life should be
granted. As a rule, students do not
elect the easiest studies and those
who do soon find their enjoyments
elsewhere.
Further, we are told that the elec

tive system offers temptations to un
due or premature specialization. This
also is true, and premature specializa
tion, like other forms of precocious
virtue, is to be deprecated. But ex
perience does not show that the
danger of "undue specialization" is a
serious one. The current, in college
and out, mostly sets the other way.
The fact that a man ventures to spec
ialize at all, shows that he has a cer
tain independence of character for the
odds are against it. Specialization im
plies thoroughness. It gives to each
man a base-line by which he can
measure the attainments of others.
No knowledge comes amiss to an in
vestigator; but no investigator can af
ford to sacrifice his specialty for the
sake of breadth. Thoroughness is the
main point, and should take preced
ence over versatility. 1 do not advo
cate narrowness of sympathy or nar
rowness of culture. The broadest ed
ucation is none too broad for the
growing scholar in any field. But the
forces of the mind should not be scat
tered in guerilla bands, but marshalled
toward leadership.
Major Department Arrangement.
Recognizing the conditions from the
very first, Stanford attempted to
strengthen and support the principle
of election in studies by means of the
major department arrangement. This
plan as we know it at Stanford and
as more or less developed in several
other universities, among them Har
vard, was forshadowed in these words
of Agassiz to his students in 1873:
"A specialty is the backbone of edu
cation. The mind is made strong by
the thorough possession of some
thing."
The final test of the elective system
must be found in its results. What
sort of man does it produce? What
is its relation to the discipline neces
sary to effectiveness in life? Dis
cipline means self-control, the power
to subordinate personal interest to the
larger needs of societies or nations,
the power to co-operate with other
men in the accomplishment of worthy
results. In this matter our people
tend to undervalue our actual achieve
ments, for too often uniformity is
mistaken for discipline. Unques
tioned obedience is not discipline.
Real discipline involves response
with head and heart to the dictates
of individual conscience, the "cate
gorical imperative" as set forth by
Immanuel Kant-. The uncritical sub
mission now shown by the masses
in Central Europe stands in exact
opposition to the dictum of the great
philosopher.
The output of our colleges has not
the uniformity for which Europe has
striven. Much that Europe values,
justly or not, we have neglected in
the interest of newer and sometimes
weightier demands. Substance is
more important than polish, and in
itiative outweighs all other forms of
efficiency. It is our highest aim in
America to grant not merely a lib
eral education, but, to borrow a word
from Dr. Peabody, a "liberating edu
cation," which shall fit a man to meet
unforseen demands.
Pledged To Personal Inithitive.
Democratic discipline and paternal
discipline lie at opposite poles in
national development. Each has its
defenders in our republic as else
where. But as a nation we stand
pledged to the discipline that evolves
from within and rests on personal
initiative. Its results are unequal,
but in the long run it is more effic
ient as an impulse in individual or
social life. We work under orders as
before, but not sealed orders. The
true American belongs to a political
party or a religious organization, not
to take direction from it, but to use
it for purposes which he shares with
the group. To him the party or or
ganization is a means towards indi
vidual or social ends, not an end in
itself. In our higher education as in
our political affairs, we have rejected
paternal dictation. From the dis
cipline self-imposed arises a form of
social discipline, unselfish devotion to
a common cause, characteristic of a
land of undivided freedom. The
highest patriotism, the patriotism of
humanity, cannot develop in a people

whose every man is a patient cog in
the wheels of a social, industrial or
military machine.
Appreciation of College >lenin War.
In a discussion of the affairs of
Belgium, Professor Vernon L. Kellogg
makes this reference to the work of
these students: "There are many
other bits that might be told. Only
one shall I add. It is a word of ap
preciation of the young Americans—
I am an old one—who offered their
services and performed their work in
a way to bring warmth to the heart
and mist to the eyes of a believer in
our country and its way of producing
men. Most of these helpers—a few
more than seventy Americans have
been so far in the service—are young
college men, a considerable fraction
of them.being Rhodes scholars from
the various Oxford colleges. Trained
in college for anything but the specific
work of the commission, they seem
to have found a training that, added
to a natural initiative, has made them
capable actors in the world's work.
Thrown into a situation requiring tact
and utmost discretion, loaded with
large responsibilities and asked to
take care of themselves and import
ant affairs of the commission under
most unusual circumstances, they
have done it, almost to a man, with
success. They have won the admira
tion of the Belgians and Germans
alike. They make one proud of
America and they lend great encour
agement to an observer of American
educational methods. Viewed in their
workings, these methods have seemed
to many of us very faulty; viewed in
their results, so far as young America
is a result of education at all, our too
easy pessimism is given a proper un
settling. I return to my university
chair with renewed confidence in
American educational work."
Man Trained for Man's Work.
The democratic type of educational
discipline aims to train a man to do
a man's work in life. It should help
him to strike at the heart of world
problems for himself, guided by no
precedent. Tt enables him to act in
telligently where others are contented
with blind feeling. In the future of
Europe the transfer of its activities
from the control of the few to the
welfare of the many, the American
scholar may prove a leading or even
a determining factor.
But after all consideration of uni
versity organization and of Stanford's
participation in it, we come back to
our first proposition, ihe imperative
ness of personality. A university is
a human group. In the long run it is
what its teachers make it. Through
the resultant of all the influences that
go out from tlieni its personality is
developed. The personality of Stan
ford for these twenty-five years has
been a very friendly one. In the first
year, teachers and students lived to
gether in Eneina Hall, and when our
world and everybody in it was young,
sometimes one could hardly tell pro
fessors and students apart. The
schools of old Japan, they say, prided
themselves on the fact that the teach
ers were merely the elder scholars,
"sen-sei," they called them, "those
born before." It is moreover record
ed of these teachers, "They knew each
of us by name."
Such a condition existed in the
early days of Stanford. We as teach
ers seemed, to ourselves at least, not
much older than our students. In the
pioneer classes, we knew everyone by
name. Happily we know them still.
And while increasing numbers and the
unifying tendencies which beset every
student body have made it no longer
possible for each of us to know all of
you by name, the old habit remains.
We are still students too—only a bit
farther along. So when we meet in
the world outside, it is as friends and
fellows devoted to each other, to our
university, our nation and our ideals.
Women Temper "Stanford Spirit."
One large factor in the temper of
constructive friendliness which we
call "the Stanford spirit" comes from
the welcome presence of the Stanford
women. I remember well the feverish
haste in which Mrs. Stanford com
pleted Roble Hall between the middle
of June and the last day of September

twenty-five years ago. She said that
the women must be in at the very be
ginning, otherwise they would always
be considered as interlopers. They
should be at home at Stanford, and
from the very first day.
Whatever the future of the univer
sity, we hope that the spirit of mu
tual trust and mutual friendliness, so
potent in the early days, will always
abide here. Changes in organization
and development must come. We
trust that changes in spirit will ap
pear only as intensification.
Today we are mounting the brow
of the hill from which we look for
ward to the future as well as back
over the past. In material ways it
has been a rocky road, with perils of
litigation, financial crises, emergen
cies of earthquake and fire, misunder
standings sometimes within and with
out. But all these are left behind
and the great future opens out. We
stand, indeed, before the very Gate of
Hercules.
Progress Result of Unrest.
They say that the American univer
sity is now in a period of unrest. It
always is. Out of unrest flows pro
gress. All our institutions are in
process of change. Nothing has yet
permanent form. Straight ahead of
us at Stanford may be seen the sep
aration of the junior college. This
means the expansion of the higher
work, a more thorough training of
men "for direct usefulness in life"
than is involved in the conventional
college education. The hour for the
change need not be hastened. It will
hasten itself. The limitation in num
bers already forced upon us is a bid
for the best, a guarantee of the high
est possible service.
(■ranting of Diplomas a Privilege.
Today I look back over a long life
of teaching. 1 began it with the sole
ambition to become a naturalist, an
explorer, with an abounding passion
for geography as related to the life
of plants and animals and men. I had
never the slightest longing for execu
tive responsibility until circumstances
thrust this upon me. Rut T can see
that there is no experience in life, no
position of trust or honor, no field of
endeavor which 112 would have chosen
instead above what the fortunes of
life have assigned to me. Twenty
five years ago my colleague, President
Thwing of Western Reserve, wrote me
in congratulation, "T would rather be
President of Stanford University than
Emperor." So would I, and so would
1 again if I hart my life to live over.
Tt is the college president's func
tion not to govern, but to help; not
to rule, but to co-ordinate. His suc
cess rests on the devotion of the col
leagues with whom he surrounds
himself. With large risks and larger
trials, he has also unsurpassed op
portunities. He deals with a nation's
"youth of promise" and he meets
their parents on their best. side.
I am not unmindful of the generous
freedom accorded me by the Poard of
Trustees for the last three years with
the title of Chancellor. Put among
the experiences of my life, I count
this with the best, that nearly r>ooo
Stanford men and women have re
reived their diplomas from my hand.
To begin with, these young people
were choice spirits, else they would
never have gone to college, never
have come to Stanford University.
Here they have lived with Nature at
her best, and have "walked with
Henslows" of all types and degrees.
Finally, they have gone down "the
ppu.w atn o}m (I s.<ua\ api.w .inoj
ctich to do his nan in a brave and
reasonable way. I have met these
men and women in every state in the
Union, in London, in Germany, in
Australia, in Korea, in Japan. Some
little part, in the achievements of each
of them 1 claim for myself, a much
larger part 112 claim for my colleagues.
Leadership In Stanford Hands.
And this is our exceeding great
and unfailing reward, the only one we
ask, a grateful remembrance of our
work. Put not the least of our satis
faction in this hour lies in the cer
tainty that Stanford's leadership lies
in Stanford's hands. No stone of the
edifice we have builded during the

last twenty-five years need be rejected
in the foundation of the preater Stan
ford which is to come.
This day rounds out the first Quar
ter Century of Stanford University,
the best part of a lifetime for me and
for those of my colleagues who gath
ered around me in the early days.
This day I stand before you in some
sense as their spokesman and advo
cate. What account can we render of
our stewardship on the threshold of a
new cycle?
Speaking for myself, who have
been for forty-six years a teacher of
college men and women, I shall not
leave the fairest field of human effort
without profound emotion. But this
1 do not ask you to share. None of us
are here to stay, none of us would
halt, the procession. The old Rou
manian proverb, "Our blood goes over
into the veins of the young," we ac
cept without flinching. Young men
and young universities move faster
than old ones, and in this fact Stan
ford finds part of the secret of her
success.
Outlines Academic Ideal
Something of this success and the
elements which made it I shall try
to set before you today. I shall not
speak again of the founders' wisdom.
I have already on another occasion
recounted, largely in Mr. Stanford's
own words, his sane ideals of educa
tion and his generous plans for carry
ing them into effect. The story of the
six dark years, illuminated and saved
by the devoted loyalty of Mrs. Stan
ford, I have told at still another time
as well as I could. My present task
is to give you some account of the
principles embodied in the academic
life of the institution itself without
reference to particular individuals or
special events.
First of all, Stanford University had
for its basis a lofty moral and spir
itual purpose born of the fair hope
and the fi*ee hand which its founders
held out to us. Moreover, its roman
tic origin at once lifted it out of the
commonplace. Furthermore, as we
dreamed, it was not to duplicate old
successes or older failures, but was
to mark a new era, so we hoped, in
the training of men and women. In
a word, it was to bring the education
of tomorrow straight to the youth of
today.
Unhampered by Tradition
In those marvelous days of creative
opportunity, we were hampered by no
prearranged rule of action. No tra
dition from the old world or the new
laid on us its dead hand. As the
young president standing in the west
end of the Quadrangle proclaimed on
that eventful first day of October,
1891: "Our University has no history
to fall back upon. Xo memories of
great teachers haunt its corridors. In
none of its rooms appear the traces
which show where a great man has
lived and worked. No tender asso
ciations cling, ivy-like, to its fresh
new walls. It is hallowed by no tra
ditions. It is hampered by none. Its
finger posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow, as the
splendid lily from the modest bulb."
To be sure, we had then all the ex

perlence of the world to fall back
upon. But we were to draw our own
conclusions. Nothing forced us to use
it in any specified way. Any method
quantity was found in the ever-vary
ing traits of human nature. And on
the recognition of this infinite variety
our scheme was primarily based.
Every form of talent, we held, was
worthy of training. To develop
strength we must bring out person
ality. To this end we must first have
teachers adequate for their responsi
bilities. A university performs its
function not in what it compels, still
less in what it forbids, but in its pro
vision for intensifying the student's
best abilities.
Organization Second
Organization is a secondary thing.
It will come soon enough. Like age,
it creeps on us unawares. So the
fewer rules the better until rules make
themselves. Under the worst possible
organization, or none at all. great
teachers may do noble work, as the
history of learning clearly shows.
Wherever placed, the great man
leaves a mark on all with whom he
comes in contact. Professor Osborn
of Columbia once refered to the lie
lief that the American college, with
its happy-go-lucky lack of system,
could never produce a Darwin. In
opposition to this view, I claimed that
it could quite as readily as any other
system, given, of course, the raw ma
terial to work upon.
To my mind, in the making or a
great naturalist three things are
necessary: the original material, the
fine human stuff; next, contact with
nature; and finally, the help and ex
ample of a great teacher. These three
factors co-operated in the life of
Darwin. It is clear that Cambridge
and Edinburgh as schools of science,
did not make him. He himself bears
witness to the "incredible dullness"
of the lectures he heard. If that were
all, Stanford University could cer
tainly have done a better job.
Essentials of Greatness
But the first essential, the raw ma
terial, the choice mosaic of germ
plasm—this was already there to work
upon, and this no school could create.
The second element, contact with
nature—a free gift to all who seek it
—Darwin found on the moors of Cam
bridgeshire, by its brooks and its
bridges. In fullest measure, Califor
nia offers the same to all.
As to the third essential, the spell
of a great life, this Cambridge pro
vided. Darwin himself gives the clue.
He says that he "walked with liens
low," and Henslow was one of the
great botanists of bis time. To walk
with Henslow was in itself a gener
ous education. To make possible such
relations is the university's choicest
function. It should furnish the Hens
lows with whom the Darwins may
walk.
For the permanent values of a uni
versity center in its faculty. All the
virtues of mind and soul should be
theirs collectively, and as far as may
be, individually,—friendliness, self-de
votion, intellectual honesty, sincerity
I of purpose, love of work, strength to
; carry it on, accuracy, profundity,

broadmindedness, reverence, refine
ment, above all else, an unshaken and
unshakeable faith in human nature —
each one of these is vitally essential.
This may not all be detected in any
one man or woman, bat they must ap
pear in the composite whole.
Principles of Beginning
Nevertheless, whatever stress may
justly be laid on the personality of
teachers, one must not undervalue de
tails of organization. Traditions there
are that belittle, regulations that
starve or cramp, details that irritate,
and limitations that waste. A uni
versity should be framed for advance
ment. The chambers of its soul
should widen as the years go by.
Whatever bounds it imposes on itself
should be flexible and temporary.
Then as its life grows more complex,
it must frame certain rules of pro
cedure. The value of these rules will
rest on the principle that lies behind
them. Stanford was free to choose its
own educational principles. The four
most fundamental with which we
started were (a) the democracy of
mental powers, (b) the elective sys
tem, (c) the major department ar
rangement, and (d) the vital import
ance of individual initiative as the
prime element in character building.
With these, coeducation and the ap
plication of science were taken as mat
ters of course.
Aim of Quality Chosen
Negatively, we did not believe in
prescribed courses of study, in the
disciplinary value of undigested learn
ing, in promoting scholarship by pro
hibitions, by marks, honors, prizes, or
by financial subsidies as baits in
the educational trap. Furthermore, we
resolved that a university need not be
valued for its bigness, nor even for
the variety of its functions, believing
it better to do a few things well than
to strive weakly to cover the whole
ground of learning. For the ultimate
function of the endowed university
must be differentiated from that of the
state institution. It is the duty of
the latter to minister to all the higher
educational needs of the state. It is
the privilege of the former to set
standards of aim and standards of
achievement.
And further still, we conceived of
university life as an opportunity, to
be looked on as such by all who
came. Those who did not rise to its
stimulus were better somewhere else.
So because the chief source of human
wastage in our republic is the open
saloon, from the first we refused to
enter into rivalry with this, —or any
other institution that fattens on men's
weaknesses. The chains of a vile
habit inhibit wholesome development.
"Free should the scholar be, free and
brave."
Democracy of Mental Powers
Let us go bark to our four prin
ciples of organization, to consider
them in some detail. And here I must
ask the kind indulgence of all whose
fate it has been for a quarter of cen
tury to hear me expound in theory
and in practice the element of free
dom in education. That has been our
watchword. And because from the be

ginning we wished to emphasize the
value of intellectual freedom, of dis
cipline which is self-imposed, not
vouchsafed from above, we chose as
our academic motto the words of Ill
rich von Hutten, spoken four centur
ies ago, "Die Luft der Freheit weht,"
"The winds of freedom are blowing."
Democracy of the mind was the in
spiration of the early days of Cornell
University. Under its lead, we of the
pioneer clas-s of 1872 established our
first college journal. We called it
"The Cornell Era." For it truly
marked a new era in college history
when college men studied engineering
and agriculture along with Greek and
Latin, when even in a literary course
geology and botany might be counted
towards a degree. That such sub
jects could be accepted was the pri
mary reason why I myself went to
Cornell and not to Yale.
Democracy of the mind was not the
discovery of Andrew D. White, its
greatest apostle. No great idea orig
inates perhaps with any one person.
Hut at Cornell it was first developed
in workable fashion. It holds that
all mental powers should be recog
nized as free and equal, each alike
entitled to make the most of itself.
In this spirit, Ezra Cornell had said,
"I would found an institution in which
any person may find instruction in
any study." Indeed, it is not for the
university to foster any aristocracy of
studies. It shall not maintain Latin
or Greek or philosophy or physics, or
anything else, as a primary essential
in education, or that those whose
minds do not turn in some favored
direction shall be left uneducated. All
the powers of the mind, the applica
tion of knowledge as well as its ex
tension and preservation, are the sub
ject-matter of the university.
Elective System Adopted
Such a conception of higher educa
tion naturally finds its expression in
the elective system, which involves
the abandonment of the old idea in
volved in the word "curriculum" or
little race-course, with its low and
high hurdles, its "little go" and its
"great go," around which the student
moved for three or four years, return
ing at commencement for his final re
ward. The more tedious the discip
line, the greater was its supposed
value, and the reward for penance
done lay in the goodfellowship which
common boredom entailed. Under the
pressure of the widening of human
knowledge, the applications of sci
ence and the insistence of human
needs, the American college has
changed its theory in these regards.
The curriculum is no longer a race
course. Its participants do not run in
a circle, but set out in all directions
along widely divergent paths. For
the new appeal of widened helpful
ness has brought into the college new
and variant types of men, with variant
needs. Teachers brought up under the
old regime have generally ill under
stood how to deal with these. Mean
while the new appeal has brought new
popularities and it must be admitted
that many students are sent to the
universites because they have shown
no promise anywhere else.

Two Classes'of Students
College students in general may be
divided into two classes: those who
care and those who don't. Only the
first class need be considered. What
ever the needs of the others, their
place is not in the college. Students
who care may be again divided as to
the impulse, whether volitional or vo
cational, which compels their interest.
The best students in each field are
those who work for the love of it.
They may be classical scholars,
"Greek-minded men or Roman-minded
men," to use Emerson's phrase, or
they may be botanists, anatomists,
physiologists, chemists, teachers, phil
ologists, historians, engineers, econ
omists, physicians or jurists. They
may spring up in any field, and they
work to the limit for the mere joy of
working. The investigators of the
world, those who widen the scope of
knowledge in an appreciable degree,
belong to this class. Every door
should be held wide open for them,
and not one of them should be com
pelled to turn out of his way by the
lure of a.degree.
The vocational impulse has also its
place in the higher training. It may
express itself in perseverance rather
than in enthusiasm. A man will stick
to an uninteresting topic if he can
relate it to the affairs of life. An in
telligent student will always recognize
vocational reasons for pushing onward
to success. This is why the engineer
ing students in our universities are,
broadly speaking, better scholars than
students of literature. They see that
their future depends absolutely on
preparation. They are to deal with
the forces of nature, and nature
brooks no ignorance or deception..
They say at Harvard, "One is a fool
to study in the college; one is a fool
not to study in the law school." It
is a matter of common observation
that in professional schools of high
standards even the idler and the
dilettante may suddenly rise to hon
est work.
Joy in Vocational Training
It is, therefore, not a forward move
ment, for colleges and universities to
turn away from vocational studies in
the interest of pure culture. The vo
cation. however, must not be narrow
ly construed, as a man of force in any
field needs as wide a horizon as the
university can give him. No effort is
wasted if undertaken conscientiously
and with the purpose of adding found
ation on which one's specialty may
rest. Hut without volitional or voca
tional relations, without joy in the
work or hope in its final completion,
a boy would better keep out of col
lege and turn his attention as soon as
possible to something which to him is
real.
In the beginning Stanford Univer
sity adopted the elective system with
open eyes, certain that no other one
made possible the best scholarship.
The old classical course has not
broken down under the pressure of
live subjects and live issues. It rested
on the noble basis of Greek thought
and Greek expression. Its ideal look-
ed backward and upward to the loft
iest achievements of the human race
in the matter of beauty of form, of
language and of thought. As Thoreau
once observed, "Those only talk of
forgetting Greek who never knew it."
To the "Greek-minded man" these four
years in academic shades in company
with gracious thoughts were most sat
isfying and enlarging.
Hut the course was narrow and
special, and some thirty years ago it
began to give place to that condition
of affairs which I have elsewhere
called the "patchwork" stage of the
curriculum. The expansion of the
natural and physical sciences, each
one changing the whole current of
thought in its field; the demands of
French and German literature; a new
attitude towards the movements of
history; the growth of economics, jur
isprudence, modern philosophy, not
safe nor sane perhaps, but drawn
from the study of things as they are,
—all these, one by one or altogether,
clamored for a place in college
courses. Slowly, grudgingly, all were
admitted, crowding out, in greater or
less measure, Greek, calculus and
Latin. Each new subject, like the
camel with its head under the tent,
moved forward to occupy. Each sub
ject, old and new, was squeezed to
the briefest possible compass, though
the new ones were no more compre
hensible than the old. It was clear
before long that not all could be
brought into one uniform course. To
that end several arrangements were
devised, in each of which some edu
cational faction should have its way
But these ill adjusted and shifting
courses were necessarily less special
ized and therefore less thorough than
the old classical one, and as ad
vanced work in one subject has a
greater cultural value than elementary
work in several, so in almost every
regard the patchwork system marked
a step downward.
This period, however, was only one
of transition, and led directly to the
elective system, which made thorough
ness possible in any one of many
lines. In a prescribed course the stu
dent has little or no choice, and yet
the element of choice is in itself a
leading factor in individual training.
A democratic institution should min
ister to all types of men in quest of
higher education. It matters not
through what agency the miracle is
wrought. It may be achieved through
the melting of vanadium steel or by
a study of the satires of Horace.
The structure of the cell-nucleus of
a tadpole is as intricate and may be
as fascinating as that of the British
constitution, or a drama of Euripides.
Under the elective system it is pos
sible for a teacher to do his finest
work. No longer occupied with "the
dregs of learning," as Agassiz once
termed the college course at Harvard,
he can lead the learner and thus lead
himself to the firing lines of science.
With students in earnest, advanced
and thorough work becomes possible.
Such students give the teacher new
life.
Elective System Marks New Growth.
With the enlarged usefulness which
marked the advent of the elective sys
tem twenty to thirty years ago, began
the new growth of the colleges. They
drew men of new kinds, and many
more of them than ever before. This
fresh impulse was dominant in the
early days of Stanford, and a like
stimulus soon gave new life to the
whole university world. Ready-made
courses, the acme of pedagogic lazi
ness, were discarded. Like ready
made clothing, such courses really fit
nobody, and an education, like a suit
of clothes, should be fitted to the man
who is to wear it.
Some criticisms still apply to the
elective system. It has not yet wholly
eliminated "the reluctant student."
Hut can any system do this? No plan
ever made a lazy man brilliant. It is
to the earnest and efficient that the
opportunities of college life should be
granted. As a rule, students do not
elect the easiest studies and those
who do soon find their enjoyments
elsewhere.
Further, we are told that the elec

tive system offers temptations to un
due or premature specialization. This
also is true, and premature specializa
tion, like other forms of precocious
virtue, is to be deprecated. But ex
perience does not show that the
danger of "undue specialization" is a
serious one. The current, in college
and out, mostly sets the other way.
The fact that a man ventures to spec
ialize at all, shows that he has a cer
tain independence of character for the
odds are against it. Specialization im
plies thoroughness. It gives to each
man a base-line by which he can
measure the attainments of others.
No knowledge comes amiss to an in
vestigator; but no investigator can af
ford to sacrifice his specialty for the
sake of breadth. Thoroughness is the
main point, and should take preced
ence over versatility. 1 do not advo
cate narrowness of sympathy or nar
rowness of culture. The broadest ed
ucation is none too broad for the
growing scholar in any field. But the
forces of the mind should not be scat
tered in guerilla bands, but marshalled
toward leadership.
Major Department Arrangement.
Recognizing the conditions from the
very first, Stanford attempted to
strengthen and support the principle
of election in studies by means of the
major department arrangement. This
plan as we know it at Stanford and
as more or less developed in several
other universities, among them Har
vard, was forshadowed in these words
of Agassiz to his students in 1873:
"A specialty is the backbone of edu
cation. The mind is made strong by
the thorough possession of some
thing."
The final test of the elective system
must be found in its results. What
sort of man does it produce? What
is its relation to the discipline neces
sary to effectiveness in life? Dis
cipline means self-control, the power
to subordinate personal interest to the
larger needs of societies or nations,
the power to co-operate with other
men in the accomplishment of worthy
results. In this matter our people
tend to undervalue our actual achieve
ments, for too often uniformity is
mistaken for discipline. Unques
tioned obedience is not discipline.
Real discipline involves response
with head and heart to the dictates
of individual conscience, the "cate
gorical imperative" as set forth by
Immanuel Kant-. The uncritical sub
mission now shown by the masses
in Central Europe stands in exact
opposition to the dictum of the great
philosopher.
The output of our colleges has not
the uniformity for which Europe has
striven. Much that Europe values,
justly or not, we have neglected in
the interest of newer and sometimes
weightier demands. Substance is
more important than polish, and in
itiative outweighs all other forms of
efficiency. It is our highest aim in
America to grant not merely a lib
eral education, but, to borrow a word
from Dr. Peabody, a "liberating edu
cation," which shall fit a man to meet
unforseen demands.
Pledged To Personal Inithitive.
Democratic discipline and paternal
discipline lie at opposite poles in
national development. Each has its
defenders in our republic as else
where. But as a nation we stand
pledged to the discipline that evolves
from within and rests on personal
initiative. Its results are unequal,
but in the long run it is more effic
ient as an impulse in individual or
social life. We work under orders as
before, but not sealed orders. The
true American belongs to a political
party or a religious organization, not
to take direction from it, but to use
it for purposes which he shares with
the group. To him the party or or
ganization is a means towards indi
vidual or social ends, not an end in
itself. In our higher education as in
our political affairs, we have rejected
paternal dictation. From the dis
cipline self-imposed arises a form of
social discipline, unselfish devotion to
a common cause, characteristic of a
land of undivided freedom. The
highest patriotism, the patriotism of
humanity, cannot develop in a people

whose every man is a patient cog in
the wheels of a social, industrial or
military machine.
Appreciation of College >lenin War.
In a discussion of the affairs of
Belgium, Professor Vernon L. Kellogg
makes this reference to the work of
these students: "There are many
other bits that might be told. Only
one shall I add. It is a word of ap
preciation of the young Americans—
I am an old one—who offered their
services and performed their work in
a way to bring warmth to the heart
and mist to the eyes of a believer in
our country and its way of producing
men. Most of these helpers—a few
more than seventy Americans have
been so far in the service—are young
college men, a considerable fraction
of them.being Rhodes scholars from
the various Oxford colleges. Trained
in college for anything but the specific
work of the commission, they seem
to have found a training that, added
to a natural initiative, has made them
capable actors in the world's work.
Thrown into a situation requiring tact
and utmost discretion, loaded with
large responsibilities and asked to
take care of themselves and import
ant affairs of the commission under
most unusual circumstances, they
have done it, almost to a man, with
success. They have won the admira
tion of the Belgians and Germans
alike. They make one proud of
America and they lend great encour
agement to an observer of American
educational methods. Viewed in their
workings, these methods have seemed
to many of us very faulty; viewed in
their results, so far as young America
is a result of education at all, our too
easy pessimism is given a proper un
settling. I return to my university
chair with renewed confidence in
American educational work."
Man Trained for Man's Work.
The democratic type of educational
discipline aims to train a man to do
a man's work in life. It should help
him to strike at the heart of world
problems for himself, guided by no
precedent. Tt enables him to act in
telligently where others are contented
with blind feeling. In the future of
Europe the transfer of its activities
from the control of the few to the
welfare of the many, the American
scholar may prove a leading or even
a determining factor.
But after all consideration of uni
versity organization and of Stanford's
participation in it, we come back to
our first proposition, ihe imperative
ness of personality. A university is
a human group. In the long run it is
what its teachers make it. Through
the resultant of all the influences that
go out from tlieni its personality is
developed. The personality of Stan
ford for these twenty-five years has
been a very friendly one. In the first
year, teachers and students lived to
gether in Eneina Hall, and when our
world and everybody in it was young,
sometimes one could hardly tell pro
fessors and students apart. The
schools of old Japan, they say, prided
themselves on the fact that the teach
ers were merely the elder scholars,
"sen-sei," they called them, "those
born before." It is moreover record
ed of these teachers, "They knew each
of us by name."
Such a condition existed in the
early days of Stanford. We as teach
ers seemed, to ourselves at least, not
much older than our students. In the
pioneer classes, we knew everyone by
name. Happily we know them still.
And while increasing numbers and the
unifying tendencies which beset every
student body have made it no longer
possible for each of us to know all of
you by name, the old habit remains.
We are still students too—only a bit
farther along. So when we meet in
the world outside, it is as friends and
fellows devoted to each other, to our
university, our nation and our ideals.
Women Temper "Stanford Spirit."
One large factor in the temper of
constructive friendliness which we
call "the Stanford spirit" comes from
the welcome presence of the Stanford
women. I remember well the feverish
haste in which Mrs. Stanford com
pleted Roble Hall between the middle
of June and the last day of September

twenty-five years ago. She said that
the women must be in at the very be
ginning, otherwise they would always
be considered as interlopers. They
should be at home at Stanford, and
from the very first day.
Whatever the future of the univer
sity, we hope that the spirit of mu
tual trust and mutual friendliness, so
potent in the early days, will always
abide here. Changes in organization
and development must come. We
trust that changes in spirit will ap
pear only as intensification.
Today we are mounting the brow
of the hill from which we look for
ward to the future as well as back
over the past. In material ways it
has been a rocky road, with perils of
litigation, financial crises, emergen
cies of earthquake and fire, misunder
standings sometimes within and with
out. But all these are left behind
and the great future opens out. We
stand, indeed, before the very Gate of
Hercules.
Progress Result of Unrest.
They say that the American univer
sity is now in a period of unrest. It
always is. Out of unrest flows pro
gress. All our institutions are in
process of change. Nothing has yet
permanent form. Straight ahead of
us at Stanford may be seen the sep
aration of the junior college. This
means the expansion of the higher
work, a more thorough training of
men "for direct usefulness in life"
than is involved in the conventional
college education. The hour for the
change need not be hastened. It will
hasten itself. The limitation in num
bers already forced upon us is a bid
for the best, a guarantee of the high
est possible service.
(■ranting of Diplomas a Privilege.
Today I look back over a long life
of teaching. 1 began it with the sole
ambition to become a naturalist, an
explorer, with an abounding passion
for geography as related to the life
of plants and animals and men. I had
never the slightest longing for execu
tive responsibility until circumstances
thrust this upon me. Rut T can see
that there is no experience in life, no
position of trust or honor, no field of
endeavor which 112 would have chosen
instead above what the fortunes of
life have assigned to me. Twenty
five years ago my colleague, President
Thwing of Western Reserve, wrote me
in congratulation, "T would rather be
President of Stanford University than
Emperor." So would I, and so would
1 again if I hart my life to live over.
Tt is the college president's func
tion not to govern, but to help; not
to rule, but to co-ordinate. His suc
cess rests on the devotion of the col
leagues with whom he surrounds
himself. With large risks and larger
trials, he has also unsurpassed op
portunities. He deals with a nation's
"youth of promise" and he meets
their parents on their best. side.
I am not unmindful of the generous
freedom accorded me by the Poard of
Trustees for the last three years with
the title of Chancellor. Put among
the experiences of my life, I count
this with the best, that nearly r>ooo
Stanford men and women have re
reived their diplomas from my hand.
To begin with, these young people
were choice spirits, else they would
never have gone to college, never
have come to Stanford University.
Here they have lived with Nature at
her best, and have "walked with
Henslows" of all types and degrees.
Finally, they have gone down "the
ppu.w atn o}m (I s.<ua\ api.w .inoj
ctich to do his nan in a brave and
reasonable way. I have met these
men and women in every state in the
Union, in London, in Germany, in
Australia, in Korea, in Japan. Some
little part, in the achievements of each
of them 1 claim for myself, a much
larger part 112 claim for my colleagues.
Leadership In Stanford Hands.
And this is our exceeding great
and unfailing reward, the only one we
ask, a grateful remembrance of our
work. Put not the least of our satis
faction in this hour lies in the cer
tainty that Stanford's leadership lies
in Stanford's hands. No stone of the
edifice we have builded during the

last twenty-five years need be rejected
in the foundation of the preater Stan
ford which is to come.
This day rounds out the first Quar
ter Century of Stanford University,
the best part of a lifetime for me and
for those of my colleagues who gath
ered around me in the early days.
This day I stand before you in some
sense as their spokesman and advo
cate. What account can we render of
our stewardship on the threshold of a
new cycle?
Speaking for myself, who have
been for forty-six years a teacher of
college men and women, I shall not
leave the fairest field of human effort
without profound emotion. But this
1 do not ask you to share. None of us
are here to stay, none of us would
halt, the procession. The old Rou
manian proverb, "Our blood goes over
into the veins of the young," we ac
cept without flinching. Young men
and young universities move faster
than old ones, and in this fact Stan
ford finds part of the secret of her
success.
Outlines Academic Ideal
Something of this success and the
elements which made it I shall try
to set before you today. I shall not
speak again of the founders' wisdom.
I have already on another occasion
recounted, largely in Mr. Stanford's
own words, his sane ideals of educa
tion and his generous plans for carry
ing them into effect. The story of the
six dark years, illuminated and saved
by the devoted loyalty of Mrs. Stan
ford, I have told at still another time
as well as I could. My present task
is to give you some account of the
principles embodied in the academic
life of the institution itself without
reference to particular individuals or
special events.
First of all, Stanford University had
for its basis a lofty moral and spir
itual purpose born of the fair hope
and the fi*ee hand which its founders
held out to us. Moreover, its roman
tic origin at once lifted it out of the
commonplace. Furthermore, as we
dreamed, it was not to duplicate old
successes or older failures, but was
to mark a new era, so we hoped, in
the training of men and women. In
a word, it was to bring the education
of tomorrow straight to the youth of
today.
Unhampered by Tradition
In those marvelous days of creative
opportunity, we were hampered by no
prearranged rule of action. No tra
dition from the old world or the new
laid on us its dead hand. As the
young president standing in the west
end of the Quadrangle proclaimed on
that eventful first day of October,
1891: "Our University has no history
to fall back upon. Xo memories of
great teachers haunt its corridors. In
none of its rooms appear the traces
which show where a great man has
lived and worked. No tender asso
ciations cling, ivy-like, to its fresh
new walls. It is hallowed by no tra
ditions. It is hampered by none. Its
finger posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow, as the
splendid lily from the modest bulb."
To be sure, we had then all the ex

perlence of the world to fall back
upon. But we were to draw our own
conclusions. Nothing forced us to use
it in any specified way. Any method
quantity was found in the ever-vary
ing traits of human nature. And on
the recognition of this infinite variety
our scheme was primarily based.
Every form of talent, we held, was
worthy of training. To develop
strength we must bring out person
ality. To this end we must first have
teachers adequate for their responsi
bilities. A university performs its
function not in what it compels, still
less in what it forbids, but in its pro
vision for intensifying the student's
best abilities.
Organization Second
Organization is a secondary thing.
It will come soon enough. Like age,
it creeps on us unawares. So the
fewer rules the better until rules make
themselves. Under the worst possible
organization, or none at all. great
teachers may do noble work, as the
history of learning clearly shows.
Wherever placed, the great man
leaves a mark on all with whom he
comes in contact. Professor Osborn
of Columbia once refered to the lie
lief that the American college, with
its happy-go-lucky lack of system,
could never produce a Darwin. In
opposition to this view, I claimed that
it could quite as readily as any other
system, given, of course, the raw ma
terial to work upon.
To my mind, in the making or a
great naturalist three things are
necessary: the original material, the
fine human stuff; next, contact with
nature; and finally, the help and ex
ample of a great teacher. These three
factors co-operated in the life of
Darwin. It is clear that Cambridge
and Edinburgh as schools of science,
did not make him. He himself bears
witness to the "incredible dullness"
of the lectures he heard. If that were
all, Stanford University could cer
tainly have done a better job.
Essentials of Greatness
But the first essential, the raw ma
terial, the choice mosaic of germ
plasm—this was already there to work
upon, and this no school could create.
The second element, contact with
nature—a free gift to all who seek it
—Darwin found on the moors of Cam
bridgeshire, by its brooks and its
bridges. In fullest measure, Califor
nia offers the same to all.
As to the third essential, the spell
of a great life, this Cambridge pro
vided. Darwin himself gives the clue.
He says that he "walked with liens
low," and Henslow was one of the
great botanists of bis time. To walk
with Henslow was in itself a gener
ous education. To make possible such
relations is the university's choicest
function. It should furnish the Hens
lows with whom the Darwins may
walk.
For the permanent values of a uni
versity center in its faculty. All the
virtues of mind and soul should be
theirs collectively, and as far as may
be, individually,—friendliness, self-de
votion, intellectual honesty, sincerity
I of purpose, love of work, strength to
; carry it on, accuracy, profundity,

broadmindedness, reverence, refine
ment, above all else, an unshaken and
unshakeable faith in human nature —
each one of these is vitally essential.
This may not all be detected in any
one man or woman, bat they must ap
pear in the composite whole.
Principles of Beginning
Nevertheless, whatever stress may
justly be laid on the personality of
teachers, one must not undervalue de
tails of organization. Traditions there
are that belittle, regulations that
starve or cramp, details that irritate,
and limitations that waste. A uni
versity should be framed for advance
ment. The chambers of its soul
should widen as the years go by.
Whatever bounds it imposes on itself
should be flexible and temporary.
Then as its life grows more complex,
it must frame certain rules of pro
cedure. The value of these rules will
rest on the principle that lies behind
them. Stanford was free to choose its
own educational principles. The four
most fundamental with which we
started were (a) the democracy of
mental powers, (b) the elective sys
tem, (c) the major department ar
rangement, and (d) the vital import
ance of individual initiative as the
prime element in character building.
With these, coeducation and the ap
plication of science were taken as mat
ters of course.
Aim of Quality Chosen
Negatively, we did not believe in
prescribed courses of study, in the
disciplinary value of undigested learn
ing, in promoting scholarship by pro
hibitions, by marks, honors, prizes, or
by financial subsidies as baits in
the educational trap. Furthermore, we
resolved that a university need not be
valued for its bigness, nor even for
the variety of its functions, believing
it better to do a few things well than
to strive weakly to cover the whole
ground of learning. For the ultimate
function of the endowed university
must be differentiated from that of the
state institution. It is the duty of
the latter to minister to all the higher
educational needs of the state. It is
the privilege of the former to set
standards of aim and standards of
achievement.
And further still, we conceived of
university life as an opportunity, to
be looked on as such by all who
came. Those who did not rise to its
stimulus were better somewhere else.
So because the chief source of human
wastage in our republic is the open
saloon, from the first we refused to
enter into rivalry with this, —or any
other institution that fattens on men's
weaknesses. The chains of a vile
habit inhibit wholesome development.
"Free should the scholar be, free and
brave."
Democracy of Mental Powers
Let us go bark to our four prin
ciples of organization, to consider
them in some detail. And here I must
ask the kind indulgence of all whose
fate it has been for a quarter of cen
tury to hear me expound in theory
and in practice the element of free
dom in education. That has been our
watchword. And because from the be

ginning we wished to emphasize the
value of intellectual freedom, of dis
cipline which is self-imposed, not
vouchsafed from above, we chose as
our academic motto the words of Ill
rich von Hutten, spoken four centur
ies ago, "Die Luft der Freheit weht,"
"The winds of freedom are blowing."
Democracy of the mind was the in
spiration of the early days of Cornell
University. Under its lead, we of the
pioneer clas-s of 1872 established our
first college journal. We called it
"The Cornell Era." For it truly
marked a new era in college history
when college men studied engineering
and agriculture along with Greek and
Latin, when even in a literary course
geology and botany might be counted
towards a degree. That such sub
jects could be accepted was the pri
mary reason why I myself went to
Cornell and not to Yale.
Democracy of the mind was not the
discovery of Andrew D. White, its
greatest apostle. No great idea orig
inates perhaps with any one person.
Hut at Cornell it was first developed
in workable fashion. It holds that
all mental powers should be recog
nized as free and equal, each alike
entitled to make the most of itself.
In this spirit, Ezra Cornell had said,
"I would found an institution in which
any person may find instruction in
any study." Indeed, it is not for the
university to foster any aristocracy of
studies. It shall not maintain Latin
or Greek or philosophy or physics, or
anything else, as a primary essential
in education, or that those whose
minds do not turn in some favored
direction shall be left uneducated. All
the powers of the mind, the applica
tion of knowledge as well as its ex
tension and preservation, are the sub
ject-matter of the university.
Elective System Adopted
Such a conception of higher educa
tion naturally finds its expression in
the elective system, which involves
the abandonment of the old idea in
volved in the word "curriculum" or
little race-course, with its low and
high hurdles, its "little go" and its
"great go," around which the student
moved for three or four years, return
ing at commencement for his final re
ward. The more tedious the discip
line, the greater was its supposed
value, and the reward for penance
done lay in the goodfellowship which
common boredom entailed. Under the
pressure of the widening of human
knowledge, the applications of sci
ence and the insistence of human
needs, the American college has
changed its theory in these regards.
The curriculum is no longer a race
course. Its participants do not run in
a circle, but set out in all directions
along widely divergent paths. For
the new appeal of widened helpful
ness has brought into the college new
and variant types of men, with variant
needs. Teachers brought up under the
old regime have generally ill under
stood how to deal with these. Mean
while the new appeal has brought new
popularities and it must be admitted
that many students are sent to the
universites because they have shown
no promise anywhere else.

Two Classes'of Students
College students in general may be
divided into two classes: those who
care and those who don't. Only the
first class need be considered. What
ever the needs of the others, their
place is not in the college. Students
who care may be again divided as to
the impulse, whether volitional or vo
cational, which compels their interest.
The best students in each field are
those who work for the love of it.
They may be classical scholars,
"Greek-minded men or Roman-minded
men," to use Emerson's phrase, or
they may be botanists, anatomists,
physiologists, chemists, teachers, phil
ologists, historians, engineers, econ
omists, physicians or jurists. They
may spring up in any field, and they
work to the limit for the mere joy of
working. The investigators of the
world, those who widen the scope of
knowledge in an appreciable degree,
belong to this class. Every door
should be held wide open for them,
and not one of them should be com
pelled to turn out of his way by the
lure of a.degree.
The vocational impulse has also its
place in the higher training. It may
express itself in perseverance rather
than in enthusiasm. A man will stick
to an uninteresting topic if he can
relate it to the affairs of life. An in
telligent student will always recognize
vocational reasons for pushing onward
to success. This is why the engineer
ing students in our universities are,
broadly speaking, better scholars than
students of literature. They see that
their future depends absolutely on
preparation. They are to deal with
the forces of nature, and nature
brooks no ignorance or deception..
They say at Harvard, "One is a fool
to study in the college; one is a fool
not to study in the law school." It
is a matter of common observation
that in professional schools of high
standards even the idler and the
dilettante may suddenly rise to hon
est work.
Joy in Vocational Training
It is, therefore, not a forward move
ment, for colleges and universities to
turn away from vocational studies in
the interest of pure culture. The vo
cation. however, must not be narrow
ly construed, as a man of force in any
field needs as wide a horizon as the
university can give him. No effort is
wasted if undertaken conscientiously
and with the purpose of adding found
ation on which one's specialty may
rest. Hut without volitional or voca
tional relations, without joy in the
work or hope in its final completion,
a boy would better keep out of col
lege and turn his attention as soon as
possible to something which to him is
real.
In the beginning Stanford Univer
sity adopted the elective system with
open eyes, certain that no other one
made possible the best scholarship.
The old classical course has not
broken down under the pressure of
live subjects and live issues. It rested
on the noble basis of Greek thought
and Greek expression. Its ideal look-
ed backward and upward to the loft
iest achievements of the human race
in the matter of beauty of form, of
language and of thought. As Thoreau
once observed, "Those only talk of
forgetting Greek who never knew it."
To the "Greek-minded man" these four
years in academic shades in company
with gracious thoughts were most sat
isfying and enlarging.
Hut the course was narrow and
special, and some thirty years ago it
began to give place to that condition
of affairs which I have elsewhere
called the "patchwork" stage of the
curriculum. The expansion of the
natural and physical sciences, each
one changing the whole current of
thought in its field; the demands of
French and German literature; a new
attitude towards the movements of
history; the growth of economics, jur
isprudence, modern philosophy, not
safe nor sane perhaps, but drawn
from the study of things as they are,
—all these, one by one or altogether,
clamored for a place in college
courses. Slowly, grudgingly, all were
admitted, crowding out, in greater or
less measure, Greek, calculus and
Latin. Each new subject, like the
camel with its head under the tent,
moved forward to occupy. Each sub
ject, old and new, was squeezed to
the briefest possible compass, though
the new ones were no more compre
hensible than the old. It was clear
before long that not all could be
brought into one uniform course. To
that end several arrangements were
devised, in each of which some edu
cational faction should have its way
But these ill adjusted and shifting
courses were necessarily less special
ized and therefore less thorough than
the old classical one, and as ad
vanced work in one subject has a
greater cultural value than elementary
work in several, so in almost every
regard the patchwork system marked
a step downward.
This period, however, was only one
of transition, and led directly to the
elective system, which made thorough
ness possible in any one of many
lines. In a prescribed course the stu
dent has little or no choice, and yet
the element of choice is in itself a
leading factor in individual training.
A democratic institution should min
ister to all types of men in quest of
higher education. It matters not
through what agency the miracle is
wrought. It may be achieved through
the melting of vanadium steel or by
a study of the satires of Horace.
The structure of the cell-nucleus of
a tadpole is as intricate and may be
as fascinating as that of the British
constitution, or a drama of Euripides.
Under the elective system it is pos
sible for a teacher to do his finest
work. No longer occupied with "the
dregs of learning," as Agassiz once
termed the college course at Harvard,
he can lead the learner and thus lead
himself to the firing lines of science.
With students in earnest, advanced
and thorough work becomes possible.
Such students give the teacher new
life.
Elective System Marks New Growth.
With the enlarged usefulness which
marked the advent of the elective sys
tem twenty to thirty years ago, began
the new growth of the colleges. They
drew men of new kinds, and many
more of them than ever before. This
fresh impulse was dominant in the
early days of Stanford, and a like
stimulus soon gave new life to the
whole university world. Ready-made
courses, the acme of pedagogic lazi
ness, were discarded. Like ready
made clothing, such courses really fit
nobody, and an education, like a suit
of clothes, should be fitted to the man
who is to wear it.
Some criticisms still apply to the
elective system. It has not yet wholly
eliminated "the reluctant student."
Hut can any system do this? No plan
ever made a lazy man brilliant. It is
to the earnest and efficient that the
opportunities of college life should be
granted. As a rule, students do not
elect the easiest studies and those
who do soon find their enjoyments
elsewhere.
Further, we are told that the elec

tive system offers temptations to un
due or premature specialization. This
also is true, and premature specializa
tion, like other forms of precocious
virtue, is to be deprecated. But ex
perience does not show that the
danger of "undue specialization" is a
serious one. The current, in college
and out, mostly sets the other way.
The fact that a man ventures to spec
ialize at all, shows that he has a cer
tain independence of character for the
odds are against it. Specialization im
plies thoroughness. It gives to each
man a base-line by which he can
measure the attainments of others.
No knowledge comes amiss to an in
vestigator; but no investigator can af
ford to sacrifice his specialty for the
sake of breadth. Thoroughness is the
main point, and should take preced
ence over versatility. 1 do not advo
cate narrowness of sympathy or nar
rowness of culture. The broadest ed
ucation is none too broad for the
growing scholar in any field. But the
forces of the mind should not be scat
tered in guerilla bands, but marshalled
toward leadership.
Major Department Arrangement.
Recognizing the conditions from the
very first, Stanford attempted to
strengthen and support the principle
of election in studies by means of the
major department arrangement. This
plan as we know it at Stanford and
as more or less developed in several
other universities, among them Har
vard, was forshadowed in these words
of Agassiz to his students in 1873:
"A specialty is the backbone of edu
cation. The mind is made strong by
the thorough possession of some
thing."
The final test of the elective system
must be found in its results. What
sort of man does it produce? What
is its relation to the discipline neces
sary to effectiveness in life? Dis
cipline means self-control, the power
to subordinate personal interest to the
larger needs of societies or nations,
the power to co-operate with other
men in the accomplishment of worthy
results. In this matter our people
tend to undervalue our actual achieve
ments, for too often uniformity is
mistaken for discipline. Unques
tioned obedience is not discipline.
Real discipline involves response
with head and heart to the dictates
of individual conscience, the "cate
gorical imperative" as set forth by
Immanuel Kant-. The uncritical sub
mission now shown by the masses
in Central Europe stands in exact
opposition to the dictum of the great
philosopher.
The output of our colleges has not
the uniformity for which Europe has
striven. Much that Europe values,
justly or not, we have neglected in
the interest of newer and sometimes
weightier demands. Substance is
more important than polish, and in
itiative outweighs all other forms of
efficiency. It is our highest aim in
America to grant not merely a lib
eral education, but, to borrow a word
from Dr. Peabody, a "liberating edu
cation," which shall fit a man to meet
unforseen demands.
Pledged To Personal Inithitive.
Democratic discipline and paternal
discipline lie at opposite poles in
national development. Each has its
defenders in our republic as else
where. But as a nation we stand
pledged to the discipline that evolves
from within and rests on personal
initiative. Its results are unequal,
but in the long run it is more effic
ient as an impulse in individual or
social life. We work under orders as
before, but not sealed orders. The
true American belongs to a political
party or a religious organization, not
to take direction from it, but to use
it for purposes which he shares with
the group. To him the party or or
ganization is a means towards indi
vidual or social ends, not an end in
itself. In our higher education as in
our political affairs, we have rejected
paternal dictation. From the dis
cipline self-imposed arises a form of
social discipline, unselfish devotion to
a common cause, characteristic of a
land of undivided freedom. The
highest patriotism, the patriotism of
humanity, cannot develop in a people

whose every man is a patient cog in
the wheels of a social, industrial or
military machine.
Appreciation of College >lenin War.
In a discussion of the affairs of
Belgium, Professor Vernon L. Kellogg
makes this reference to the work of
these students: "There are many
other bits that might be told. Only
one shall I add. It is a word of ap
preciation of the young Americans—
I am an old one—who offered their
services and performed their work in
a way to bring warmth to the heart
and mist to the eyes of a believer in
our country and its way of producing
men. Most of these helpers—a few
more than seventy Americans have
been so far in the service—are young
college men, a considerable fraction
of them.being Rhodes scholars from
the various Oxford colleges. Trained
in college for anything but the specific
work of the commission, they seem
to have found a training that, added
to a natural initiative, has made them
capable actors in the world's work.
Thrown into a situation requiring tact
and utmost discretion, loaded with
large responsibilities and asked to
take care of themselves and import
ant affairs of the commission under
most unusual circumstances, they
have done it, almost to a man, with
success. They have won the admira
tion of the Belgians and Germans
alike. They make one proud of
America and they lend great encour
agement to an observer of American
educational methods. Viewed in their
workings, these methods have seemed
to many of us very faulty; viewed in
their results, so far as young America
is a result of education at all, our too
easy pessimism is given a proper un
settling. I return to my university
chair with renewed confidence in
American educational work."
Man Trained for Man's Work.
The democratic type of educational
discipline aims to train a man to do
a man's work in life. It should help
him to strike at the heart of world
problems for himself, guided by no
precedent. Tt enables him to act in
telligently where others are contented
with blind feeling. In the future of
Europe the transfer of its activities
from the control of the few to the
welfare of the many, the American
scholar may prove a leading or even
a determining factor.
But after all consideration of uni
versity organization and of Stanford's
participation in it, we come back to
our first proposition, ihe imperative
ness of personality. A university is
a human group. In the long run it is
what its teachers make it. Through
the resultant of all the influences that
go out from tlieni its personality is
developed. The personality of Stan
ford for these twenty-five years has
been a very friendly one. In the first
year, teachers and students lived to
gether in Eneina Hall, and when our
world and everybody in it was young,
sometimes one could hardly tell pro
fessors and students apart. The
schools of old Japan, they say, prided
themselves on the fact that the teach
ers were merely the elder scholars,
"sen-sei," they called them, "those
born before." It is moreover record
ed of these teachers, "They knew each
of us by name."
Such a condition existed in the
early days of Stanford. We as teach
ers seemed, to ourselves at least, not
much older than our students. In the
pioneer classes, we knew everyone by
name. Happily we know them still.
And while increasing numbers and the
unifying tendencies which beset every
student body have made it no longer
possible for each of us to know all of
you by name, the old habit remains.
We are still students too—only a bit
farther along. So when we meet in
the world outside, it is as friends and
fellows devoted to each other, to our
university, our nation and our ideals.
Women Temper "Stanford Spirit."
One large factor in the temper of
constructive friendliness which we
call "the Stanford spirit" comes from
the welcome presence of the Stanford
women. I remember well the feverish
haste in which Mrs. Stanford com
pleted Roble Hall between the middle
of June and the last day of September

twenty-five years ago. She said that
the women must be in at the very be
ginning, otherwise they would always
be considered as interlopers. They
should be at home at Stanford, and
from the very first day.
Whatever the future of the univer
sity, we hope that the spirit of mu
tual trust and mutual friendliness, so
potent in the early days, will always
abide here. Changes in organization
and development must come. We
trust that changes in spirit will ap
pear only as intensification.
Today we are mounting the brow
of the hill from which we look for
ward to the future as well as back
over the past. In material ways it
has been a rocky road, with perils of
litigation, financial crises, emergen
cies of earthquake and fire, misunder
standings sometimes within and with
out. But all these are left behind
and the great future opens out. We
stand, indeed, before the very Gate of
Hercules.
Progress Result of Unrest.
They say that the American univer
sity is now in a period of unrest. It
always is. Out of unrest flows pro
gress. All our institutions are in
process of change. Nothing has yet
permanent form. Straight ahead of
us at Stanford may be seen the sep
aration of the junior college. This
means the expansion of the higher
work, a more thorough training of
men "for direct usefulness in life"
than is involved in the conventional
college education. The hour for the
change need not be hastened. It will
hasten itself. The limitation in num
bers already forced upon us is a bid
for the best, a guarantee of the high
est possible service.
(■ranting of Diplomas a Privilege.
Today I look back over a long life
of teaching. 1 began it with the sole
ambition to become a naturalist, an
explorer, with an abounding passion
for geography as related to the life
of plants and animals and men. I had
never the slightest longing for execu
tive responsibility until circumstances
thrust this upon me. Rut T can see
that there is no experience in life, no
position of trust or honor, no field of
endeavor which 112 would have chosen
instead above what the fortunes of
life have assigned to me. Twenty
five years ago my colleague, President
Thwing of Western Reserve, wrote me
in congratulation, "T would rather be
President of Stanford University than
Emperor." So would I, and so would
1 again if I hart my life to live over.
Tt is the college president's func
tion not to govern, but to help; not
to rule, but to co-ordinate. His suc
cess rests on the devotion of the col
leagues with whom he surrounds
himself. With large risks and larger
trials, he has also unsurpassed op
portunities. He deals with a nation's
"youth of promise" and he meets
their parents on their best. side.
I am not unmindful of the generous
freedom accorded me by the Poard of
Trustees for the last three years with
the title of Chancellor. Put among
the experiences of my life, I count
this with the best, that nearly r>ooo
Stanford men and women have re
reived their diplomas from my hand.
To begin with, these young people
were choice spirits, else they would
never have gone to college, never
have come to Stanford University.
Here they have lived with Nature at
her best, and have "walked with
Henslows" of all types and degrees.
Finally, they have gone down "the
ppu.w atn o}m (I s.<ua\ api.w .inoj
ctich to do his nan in a brave and
reasonable way. I have met these
men and women in every state in the
Union, in London, in Germany, in
Australia, in Korea, in Japan. Some
little part, in the achievements of each
of them 1 claim for myself, a much
larger part 112 claim for my colleagues.
Leadership In Stanford Hands.
And this is our exceeding great
and unfailing reward, the only one we
ask, a grateful remembrance of our
work. Put not the least of our satis
faction in this hour lies in the cer
tainty that Stanford's leadership lies
in Stanford's hands. No stone of the
edifice we have builded during the

last twenty-five years need be rejected
in the foundation of the preater Stan
ford which is to come.
This day rounds out the first Quar
ter Century of Stanford University,
the best part of a lifetime for me and
for those of my colleagues who gath
ered around me in the early days.
This day I stand before you in some
sense as their spokesman and advo
cate. What account can we render of
our stewardship on the threshold of a
new cycle?
Speaking for myself, who have
been for forty-six years a teacher of
college men and women, I shall not
leave the fairest field of human effort
without profound emotion. But this
1 do not ask you to share. None of us
are here to stay, none of us would
halt, the procession. The old Rou
manian proverb, "Our blood goes over
into the veins of the young," we ac
cept without flinching. Young men
and young universities move faster
than old ones, and in this fact Stan
ford finds part of the secret of her
success.
Outlines Academic Ideal
Something of this success and the
elements which made it I shall try
to set before you today. I shall not
speak again of the founders' wisdom.
I have already on another occasion
recounted, largely in Mr. Stanford's
own words, his sane ideals of educa
tion and his generous plans for carry
ing them into effect. The story of the
six dark years, illuminated and saved
by the devoted loyalty of Mrs. Stan
ford, I have told at still another time
as well as I could. My present task
is to give you some account of the
principles embodied in the academic
life of the institution itself without
reference to particular individuals or
special events.
First of all, Stanford University had
for its basis a lofty moral and spir
itual purpose born of the fair hope
and the fi*ee hand which its founders
held out to us. Moreover, its roman
tic origin at once lifted it out of the
commonplace. Furthermore, as we
dreamed, it was not to duplicate old
successes or older failures, but was
to mark a new era, so we hoped, in
the training of men and women. In
a word, it was to bring the education
of tomorrow straight to the youth of
today.
Unhampered by Tradition
In those marvelous days of creative
opportunity, we were hampered by no
prearranged rule of action. No tra
dition from the old world or the new
laid on us its dead hand. As the
young president standing in the west
end of the Quadrangle proclaimed on
that eventful first day of October,
1891: "Our University has no history
to fall back upon. Xo memories of
great teachers haunt its corridors. In
none of its rooms appear the traces
which show where a great man has
lived and worked. No tender asso
ciations cling, ivy-like, to its fresh
new walls. It is hallowed by no tra
ditions. It is hampered by none. Its
finger posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow, as the
splendid lily from the modest bulb."
To be sure, we had then all the ex

perlence of the world to fall back
upon. But we were to draw our own
conclusions. Nothing forced us to use
it in any specified way. Any method
quantity was found in the ever-vary
ing traits of human nature. And on
the recognition of this infinite variety
our scheme was primarily based.
Every form of talent, we held, was
worthy of training. To develop
strength we must bring out person
ality. To this end we must first have
teachers adequate for their responsi
bilities. A university performs its
function not in what it compels, still
less in what it forbids, but in its pro
vision for intensifying the student's
best abilities.
Organization Second
Organization is a secondary thing.
It will come soon enough. Like age,
it creeps on us unawares. So the
fewer rules the better until rules make
themselves. Under the worst possible
organization, or none at all. great
teachers may do noble work, as the
history of learning clearly shows.
Wherever placed, the great man
leaves a mark on all with whom he
comes in contact. Professor Osborn
of Columbia once refered to the lie
lief that the American college, with
its happy-go-lucky lack of system,
could never produce a Darwin. In
opposition to this view, I claimed that
it could quite as readily as any other
system, given, of course, the raw ma
terial to work upon.
To my mind, in the making or a
great naturalist three things are
necessary: the original material, the
fine human stuff; next, contact with
nature; and finally, the help and ex
ample of a great teacher. These three
factors co-operated in the life of
Darwin. It is clear that Cambridge
and Edinburgh as schools of science,
did not make him. He himself bears
witness to the "incredible dullness"
of the lectures he heard. If that were
all, Stanford University could cer
tainly have done a better job.
Essentials of Greatness
But the first essential, the raw ma
terial, the choice mosaic of germ
plasm—this was already there to work
upon, and this no school could create.
The second element, contact with
nature—a free gift to all who seek it
—Darwin found on the moors of Cam
bridgeshire, by its brooks and its
bridges. In fullest measure, Califor
nia offers the same to all.
As to the third essential, the spell
of a great life, this Cambridge pro
vided. Darwin himself gives the clue.
He says that he "walked with liens
low," and Henslow was one of the
great botanists of bis time. To walk
with Henslow was in itself a gener
ous education. To make possible such
relations is the university's choicest
function. It should furnish the Hens
lows with whom the Darwins may
walk.
For the permanent values of a uni
versity center in its faculty. All the
virtues of mind and soul should be
theirs collectively, and as far as may
be, individually,—friendliness, self-de
votion, intellectual honesty, sincerity
I of purpose, love of work, strength to
; carry it on, accuracy, profundity,

broadmindedness, reverence, refine
ment, above all else, an unshaken and
unshakeable faith in human nature —
each one of these is vitally essential.
This may not all be detected in any
one man or woman, bat they must ap
pear in the composite whole.
Principles of Beginning
Nevertheless, whatever stress may
justly be laid on the personality of
teachers, one must not undervalue de
tails of organization. Traditions there
are that belittle, regulations that
starve or cramp, details that irritate,
and limitations that waste. A uni
versity should be framed for advance
ment. The chambers of its soul
should widen as the years go by.
Whatever bounds it imposes on itself
should be flexible and temporary.
Then as its life grows more complex,
it must frame certain rules of pro
cedure. The value of these rules will
rest on the principle that lies behind
them. Stanford was free to choose its
own educational principles. The four
most fundamental with which we
started were (a) the democracy of
mental powers, (b) the elective sys
tem, (c) the major department ar
rangement, and (d) the vital import
ance of individual initiative as the
prime element in character building.
With these, coeducation and the ap
plication of science were taken as mat
ters of course.
Aim of Quality Chosen
Negatively, we did not believe in
prescribed courses of study, in the
disciplinary value of undigested learn
ing, in promoting scholarship by pro
hibitions, by marks, honors, prizes, or
by financial subsidies as baits in
the educational trap. Furthermore, we
resolved that a university need not be
valued for its bigness, nor even for
the variety of its functions, believing
it better to do a few things well than
to strive weakly to cover the whole
ground of learning. For the ultimate
function of the endowed university
must be differentiated from that of the
state institution. It is the duty of
the latter to minister to all the higher
educational needs of the state. It is
the privilege of the former to set
standards of aim and standards of
achievement.
And further still, we conceived of
university life as an opportunity, to
be looked on as such by all who
came. Those who did not rise to its
stimulus were better somewhere else.
So because the chief source of human
wastage in our republic is the open
saloon, from the first we refused to
enter into rivalry with this, —or any
other institution that fattens on men's
weaknesses. The chains of a vile
habit inhibit wholesome development.
"Free should the scholar be, free and
brave."
Democracy of Mental Powers
Let us go bark to our four prin
ciples of organization, to consider
them in some detail. And here I must
ask the kind indulgence of all whose
fate it has been for a quarter of cen
tury to hear me expound in theory
and in practice the element of free
dom in education. That has been our
watchword. And because from the be

ginning we wished to emphasize the
value of intellectual freedom, of dis
cipline which is self-imposed, not
vouchsafed from above, we chose as
our academic motto the words of Ill
rich von Hutten, spoken four centur
ies ago, "Die Luft der Freheit weht,"
"The winds of freedom are blowing."
Democracy of the mind was the in
spiration of the early days of Cornell
University. Under its lead, we of the
pioneer clas-s of 1872 established our
first college journal. We called it
"The Cornell Era." For it truly
marked a new era in college history
when college men studied engineering
and agriculture along with Greek and
Latin, when even in a literary course
geology and botany might be counted
towards a degree. That such sub
jects could be accepted was the pri
mary reason why I myself went to
Cornell and not to Yale.
Democracy of the mind was not the
discovery of Andrew D. White, its
greatest apostle. No great idea orig
inates perhaps with any one person.
Hut at Cornell it was first developed
in workable fashion. It holds that
all mental powers should be recog
nized as free and equal, each alike
entitled to make the most of itself.
In this spirit, Ezra Cornell had said,
"I would found an institution in which
any person may find instruction in
any study." Indeed, it is not for the
university to foster any aristocracy of
studies. It shall not maintain Latin
or Greek or philosophy or physics, or
anything else, as a primary essential
in education, or that those whose
minds do not turn in some favored
direction shall be left uneducated. All
the powers of the mind, the applica
tion of knowledge as well as its ex
tension and preservation, are the sub
ject-matter of the university.
Elective System Adopted
Such a conception of higher educa
tion naturally finds its expression in
the elective system, which involves
the abandonment of the old idea in
volved in the word "curriculum" or
little race-course, with its low and
high hurdles, its "little go" and its
"great go," around which the student
moved for three or four years, return
ing at commencement for his final re
ward. The more tedious the discip
line, the greater was its supposed
value, and the reward for penance
done lay in the goodfellowship which
common boredom entailed. Under the
pressure of the widening of human
knowledge, the applications of sci
ence and the insistence of human
needs, the American college has
changed its theory in these regards.
The curriculum is no longer a race
course. Its participants do not run in
a circle, but set out in all directions
along widely divergent paths. For
the new appeal of widened helpful
ness has brought into the college new
and variant types of men, with variant
needs. Teachers brought up under the
old regime have generally ill under
stood how to deal with these. Mean
while the new appeal has brought new
popularities and it must be admitted
that many students are sent to the
universites because they have shown
no promise anywhere else.

Two Classes'of Students
College students in general may be
divided into two classes: those who
care and those who don't. Only the
first class need be considered. What
ever the needs of the others, their
place is not in the college. Students
who care may be again divided as to
the impulse, whether volitional or vo
cational, which compels their interest.
The best students in each field are
those who work for the love of it.
They may be classical scholars,
"Greek-minded men or Roman-minded
men," to use Emerson's phrase, or
they may be botanists, anatomists,
physiologists, chemists, teachers, phil
ologists, historians, engineers, econ
omists, physicians or jurists. They
may spring up in any field, and they
work to the limit for the mere joy of
working. The investigators of the
world, those who widen the scope of
knowledge in an appreciable degree,
belong to this class. Every door
should be held wide open for them,
and not one of them should be com
pelled to turn out of his way by the
lure of a.degree.
The vocational impulse has also its
place in the higher training. It may
express itself in perseverance rather
than in enthusiasm. A man will stick
to an uninteresting topic if he can
relate it to the affairs of life. An in
telligent student will always recognize
vocational reasons for pushing onward
to success. This is why the engineer
ing students in our universities are,
broadly speaking, better scholars than
students of literature. They see that
their future depends absolutely on
preparation. They are to deal with
the forces of nature, and nature
brooks no ignorance or deception..
They say at Harvard, "One is a fool
to study in the college; one is a fool
not to study in the law school." It
is a matter of common observation
that in professional schools of high
standards even the idler and the
dilettante may suddenly rise to hon
est work.
Joy in Vocational Training
It is, therefore, not a forward move
ment, for colleges and universities to
turn away from vocational studies in
the interest of pure culture. The vo
cation. however, must not be narrow
ly construed, as a man of force in any
field needs as wide a horizon as the
university can give him. No effort is
wasted if undertaken conscientiously
and with the purpose of adding found
ation on which one's specialty may
rest. Hut without volitional or voca
tional relations, without joy in the
work or hope in its final completion,
a boy would better keep out of col
lege and turn his attention as soon as
possible to something which to him is
real.
In the beginning Stanford Univer
sity adopted the elective system with
open eyes, certain that no other one
made possible the best scholarship.
The old classical course has not
broken down under the pressure of
live subjects and live issues. It rested
on the noble basis of Greek thought
and Greek expression. Its ideal look-
ed backward and upward to the loft
iest achievements of the human race
in the matter of beauty of form, of
language and of thought. As Thoreau
once observed, "Those only talk of
forgetting Greek who never knew it."
To the "Greek-minded man" these four
years in academic shades in company
with gracious thoughts were most sat
isfying and enlarging.
Hut the course was narrow and
special, and some thirty years ago it
began to give place to that condition
of affairs which I have elsewhere
called the "patchwork" stage of the
curriculum. The expansion of the
natural and physical sciences, each
one changing the whole current of
thought in its field; the demands of
French and German literature; a new
attitude towards the movements of
history; the growth of economics, jur
isprudence, modern philosophy, not
safe nor sane perhaps, but drawn
from the study of things as they are,
—all these, one by one or altogether,
clamored for a place in college
courses. Slowly, grudgingly, all were
admitted, crowding out, in greater or
less measure, Greek, calculus and
Latin. Each new subject, like the
camel with its head under the tent,
moved forward to occupy. Each sub
ject, old and new, was squeezed to
the briefest possible compass, though
the new ones were no more compre
hensible than the old. It was clear
before long that not all could be
brought into one uniform course. To
that end several arrangements were
devised, in each of which some edu
cational faction should have its way
But these ill adjusted and shifting
courses were necessarily less special
ized and therefore less thorough than
the old classical one, and as ad
vanced work in one subject has a
greater cultural value than elementary
work in several, so in almost every
regard the patchwork system marked
a step downward.
This period, however, was only one
of transition, and led directly to the
elective system, which made thorough
ness possible in any one of many
lines. In a prescribed course the stu
dent has little or no choice, and yet
the element of choice is in itself a
leading factor in individual training.
A democratic institution should min
ister to all types of men in quest of
higher education. It matters not
through what agency the miracle is
wrought. It may be achieved through
the melting of vanadium steel or by
a study of the satires of Horace.
The structure of the cell-nucleus of
a tadpole is as intricate and may be
as fascinating as that of the British
constitution, or a drama of Euripides.
Under the elective system it is pos
sible for a teacher to do his finest
work. No longer occupied with "the
dregs of learning," as Agassiz once
termed the college course at Harvard,
he can lead the learner and thus lead
himself to the firing lines of science.
With students in earnest, advanced
and thorough work becomes possible.
Such students give the teacher new
life.
Elective System Marks New Growth.
With the enlarged usefulness which
marked the advent of the elective sys
tem twenty to thirty years ago, began
the new growth of the colleges. They
drew men of new kinds, and many
more of them than ever before. This
fresh impulse was dominant in the
early days of Stanford, and a like
stimulus soon gave new life to the
whole university world. Ready-made
courses, the acme of pedagogic lazi
ness, were discarded. Like ready
made clothing, such courses really fit
nobody, and an education, like a suit
of clothes, should be fitted to the man
who is to wear it.
Some criticisms still apply to the
elective system. It has not yet wholly
eliminated "the reluctant student."
Hut can any system do this? No plan
ever made a lazy man brilliant. It is
to the earnest and efficient that the
opportunities of college life should be
granted. As a rule, students do not
elect the easiest studies and those
who do soon find their enjoyments
elsewhere.
Further, we are told that the elec

tive system offers temptations to un
due or premature specialization. This
also is true, and premature specializa
tion, like other forms of precocious
virtue, is to be deprecated. But ex
perience does not show that the
danger of "undue specialization" is a
serious one. The current, in college
and out, mostly sets the other way.
The fact that a man ventures to spec
ialize at all, shows that he has a cer
tain independence of character for the
odds are against it. Specialization im
plies thoroughness. It gives to each
man a base-line by which he can
measure the attainments of others.
No knowledge comes amiss to an in
vestigator; but no investigator can af
ford to sacrifice his specialty for the
sake of breadth. Thoroughness is the
main point, and should take preced
ence over versatility. 1 do not advo
cate narrowness of sympathy or nar
rowness of culture. The broadest ed
ucation is none too broad for the
growing scholar in any field. But the
forces of the mind should not be scat
tered in guerilla bands, but marshalled
toward leadership.
Major Department Arrangement.
Recognizing the conditions from the
very first, Stanford attempted to
strengthen and support the principle
of election in studies by means of the
major department arrangement. This
plan as we know it at Stanford and
as more or less developed in several
other universities, among them Har
vard, was forshadowed in these words
of Agassiz to his students in 1873:
"A specialty is the backbone of edu
cation. The mind is made strong by
the thorough possession of some
thing."
The final test of the elective system
must be found in its results. What
sort of man does it produce? What
is its relation to the discipline neces
sary to effectiveness in life? Dis
cipline means self-control, the power
to subordinate personal interest to the
larger needs of societies or nations,
the power to co-operate with other
men in the accomplishment of worthy
results. In this matter our people
tend to undervalue our actual achieve
ments, for too often uniformity is
mistaken for discipline. Unques
tioned obedience is not discipline.
Real discipline involves response
with head and heart to the dictates
of individual conscience, the "cate
gorical imperative" as set forth by
Immanuel Kant-. The uncritical sub
mission now shown by the masses
in Central Europe stands in exact
opposition to the dictum of the great
philosopher.
The output of our colleges has not
the uniformity for which Europe has
striven. Much that Europe values,
justly or not, we have neglected in
the interest of newer and sometimes
weightier demands. Substance is
more important than polish, and in
itiative outweighs all other forms of
efficiency. It is our highest aim in
America to grant not merely a lib
eral education, but, to borrow a word
from Dr. Peabody, a "liberating edu
cation," which shall fit a man to meet
unforseen demands.
Pledged To Personal Inithitive.
Democratic discipline and paternal
discipline lie at opposite poles in
national development. Each has its
defenders in our republic as else
where. But as a nation we stand
pledged to the discipline that evolves
from within and rests on personal
initiative. Its results are unequal,
but in the long run it is more effic
ient as an impulse in individual or
social life. We work under orders as
before, but not sealed orders. The
true American belongs to a political
party or a religious organization, not
to take direction from it, but to use
it for purposes which he shares with
the group. To him the party or or
ganization is a means towards indi
vidual or social ends, not an end in
itself. In our higher education as in
our political affairs, we have rejected
paternal dictation. From the dis
cipline self-imposed arises a form of
social discipline, unselfish devotion to
a common cause, characteristic of a
land of undivided freedom. The
highest patriotism, the patriotism of
humanity, cannot develop in a people

whose every man is a patient cog in
the wheels of a social, industrial or
military machine.
Appreciation of College >lenin War.
In a discussion of the affairs of
Belgium, Professor Vernon L. Kellogg
makes this reference to the work of
these students: "There are many
other bits that might be told. Only
one shall I add. It is a word of ap
preciation of the young Americans—
I am an old one—who offered their
services and performed their work in
a way to bring warmth to the heart
and mist to the eyes of a believer in
our country and its way of producing
men. Most of these helpers—a few
more than seventy Americans have
been so far in the service—are young
college men, a considerable fraction
of them.being Rhodes scholars from
the various Oxford colleges. Trained
in college for anything but the specific
work of the commission, they seem
to have found a training that, added
to a natural initiative, has made them
capable actors in the world's work.
Thrown into a situation requiring tact
and utmost discretion, loaded with
large responsibilities and asked to
take care of themselves and import
ant affairs of the commission under
most unusual circumstances, they
have done it, almost to a man, with
success. They have won the admira
tion of the Belgians and Germans
alike. They make one proud of
America and they lend great encour
agement to an observer of American
educational methods. Viewed in their
workings, these methods have seemed
to many of us very faulty; viewed in
their results, so far as young America
is a result of education at all, our too
easy pessimism is given a proper un
settling. I return to my university
chair with renewed confidence in
American educational work."
Man Trained for Man's Work.
The democratic type of educational
discipline aims to train a man to do
a man's work in life. It should help
him to strike at the heart of world
problems for himself, guided by no
precedent. Tt enables him to act in
telligently where others are contented
with blind feeling. In the future of
Europe the transfer of its activities
from the control of the few to the
welfare of the many, the American
scholar may prove a leading or even
a determining factor.
But after all consideration of uni
versity organization and of Stanford's
participation in it, we come back to
our first proposition, ihe imperative
ness of personality. A university is
a human group. In the long run it is
what its teachers make it. Through
the resultant of all the influences that
go out from tlieni its personality is
developed. The personality of Stan
ford for these twenty-five years has
been a very friendly one. In the first
year, teachers and students lived to
gether in Eneina Hall, and when our
world and everybody in it was young,
sometimes one could hardly tell pro
fessors and students apart. The
schools of old Japan, they say, prided
themselves on the fact that the teach
ers were merely the elder scholars,
"sen-sei," they called them, "those
born before." It is moreover record
ed of these teachers, "They knew each
of us by name."
Such a condition existed in the
early days of Stanford. We as teach
ers seemed, to ourselves at least, not
much older than our students. In the
pioneer classes, we knew everyone by
name. Happily we know them still.
And while increasing numbers and the
unifying tendencies which beset every
student body have made it no longer
possible for each of us to know all of
you by name, the old habit remains.
We are still students too—only a bit
farther along. So when we meet in
the world outside, it is as friends and
fellows devoted to each other, to our
university, our nation and our ideals.
Women Temper "Stanford Spirit."
One large factor in the temper of
constructive friendliness which we
call "the Stanford spirit" comes from
the welcome presence of the Stanford
women. I remember well the feverish
haste in which Mrs. Stanford com
pleted Roble Hall between the middle
of June and the last day of September

twenty-five years ago. She said that
the women must be in at the very be
ginning, otherwise they would always
be considered as interlopers. They
should be at home at Stanford, and
from the very first day.
Whatever the future of the univer
sity, we hope that the spirit of mu
tual trust and mutual friendliness, so
potent in the early days, will always
abide here. Changes in organization
and development must come. We
trust that changes in spirit will ap
pear only as intensification.
Today we are mounting the brow
of the hill from which we look for
ward to the future as well as back
over the past. In material ways it
has been a rocky road, with perils of
litigation, financial crises, emergen
cies of earthquake and fire, misunder
standings sometimes within and with
out. But all these are left behind
and the great future opens out. We
stand, indeed, before the very Gate of
Hercules.
Progress Result of Unrest.
They say that the American univer
sity is now in a period of unrest. It
always is. Out of unrest flows pro
gress. All our institutions are in
process of change. Nothing has yet
permanent form. Straight ahead of
us at Stanford may be seen the sep
aration of the junior college. This
means the expansion of the higher
work, a more thorough training of
men "for direct usefulness in life"
than is involved in the conventional
college education. The hour for the
change need not be hastened. It will
hasten itself. The limitation in num
bers already forced upon us is a bid
for the best, a guarantee of the high
est possible service.
(■ranting of Diplomas a Privilege.
Today I look back over a long life
of teaching. 1 began it with the sole
ambition to become a naturalist, an
explorer, with an abounding passion
for geography as related to the life
of plants and animals and men. I had
never the slightest longing for execu
tive responsibility until circumstances
thrust this upon me. Rut T can see
that there is no experience in life, no
position of trust or honor, no field of
endeavor which 112 would have chosen
instead above what the fortunes of
life have assigned to me. Twenty
five years ago my colleague, President
Thwing of Western Reserve, wrote me
in congratulation, "T would rather be
President of Stanford University than
Emperor." So would I, and so would
1 again if I hart my life to live over.
Tt is the college president's func
tion not to govern, but to help; not
to rule, but to co-ordinate. His suc
cess rests on the devotion of the col
leagues with whom he surrounds
himself. With large risks and larger
trials, he has also unsurpassed op
portunities. He deals with a nation's
"youth of promise" and he meets
their parents on their best. side.
I am not unmindful of the generous
freedom accorded me by the Poard of
Trustees for the last three years with
the title of Chancellor. Put among
the experiences of my life, I count
this with the best, that nearly r>ooo
Stanford men and women have re
reived their diplomas from my hand.
To begin with, these young people
were choice spirits, else they would
never have gone to college, never
have come to Stanford University.
Here they have lived with Nature at
her best, and have "walked with
Henslows" of all types and degrees.
Finally, they have gone down "the
ppu.w atn o}m (I s.<ua\ api.w .inoj
ctich to do his nan in a brave and
reasonable way. I have met these
men and women in every state in the
Union, in London, in Germany, in
Australia, in Korea, in Japan. Some
little part, in the achievements of each
of them 1 claim for myself, a much
larger part 112 claim for my colleagues.
Leadership In Stanford Hands.
And this is our exceeding great
and unfailing reward, the only one we
ask, a grateful remembrance of our
work. Put not the least of our satis
faction in this hour lies in the cer
tainty that Stanford's leadership lies
in Stanford's hands. No stone of the
edifice we have builded during the

last twenty-five years need be rejected
in the foundation of the preater Stan
ford which is to come.
This day rounds out the first Quar
ter Century of Stanford University,
the best part of a lifetime for me and
for those of my colleagues who gath
ered around me in the early days.
This day I stand before you in some
sense as their spokesman and advo
cate. What account can we render of
our stewardship on the threshold of a
new cycle?
Speaking for myself, who have
been for forty-six years a teacher of
college men and women, I shall not
leave the fairest field of human effort
without profound emotion. But this
1 do not ask you to share. None of us
are here to stay, none of us would
halt, the procession. The old Rou
manian proverb, "Our blood goes over
into the veins of the young," we ac
cept without flinching. Young men
and young universities move faster
than old ones, and in this fact Stan
ford finds part of the secret of her
success.
Outlines Academic Ideal
Something of this success and the
elements which made it I shall try
to set before you today. I shall not
speak again of the founders' wisdom.
I have already on another occasion
recounted, largely in Mr. Stanford's
own words, his sane ideals of educa
tion and his generous plans for carry
ing them into effect. The story of the
six dark years, illuminated and saved
by the devoted loyalty of Mrs. Stan
ford, I have told at still another time
as well as I could. My present task
is to give you some account of the
principles embodied in the academic
life of the institution itself without
reference to particular individuals or
special events.
First of all, Stanford University had
for its basis a lofty moral and spir
itual purpose born of the fair hope
and the fi*ee hand which its founders
held out to us. Moreover, its roman
tic origin at once lifted it out of the
commonplace. Furthermore, as we
dreamed, it was not to duplicate old
successes or older failures, but was
to mark a new era, so we hoped, in
the training of men and women. In
a word, it was to bring the education
of tomorrow straight to the youth of
today.
Unhampered by Tradition
In those marvelous days of creative
opportunity, we were hampered by no
prearranged rule of action. No tra
dition from the old world or the new
laid on us its dead hand. As the
young president standing in the west
end of the Quadrangle proclaimed on
that eventful first day of October,
1891: "Our University has no history
to fall back upon. Xo memories of
great teachers haunt its corridors. In
none of its rooms appear the traces
which show where a great man has
lived and worked. No tender asso
ciations cling, ivy-like, to its fresh
new walls. It is hallowed by no tra
ditions. It is hampered by none. Its
finger posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow, as the
splendid lily from the modest bulb."
To be sure, we had then all the ex

perlence of the world to fall back
upon. But we were to draw our own
conclusions. Nothing forced us to use
it in any specified way. Any method
quantity was found in the ever-vary
ing traits of human nature. And on
the recognition of this infinite variety
our scheme was primarily based.
Every form of talent, we held, was
worthy of training. To develop
strength we must bring out person
ality. To this end we must first have
teachers adequate for their responsi
bilities. A university performs its
function not in what it compels, still
less in what it forbids, but in its pro
vision for intensifying the student's
best abilities.
Organization Second
Organization is a secondary thing.
It will come soon enough. Like age,
it creeps on us unawares. So the
fewer rules the better until rules make
themselves. Under the worst possible
organization, or none at all. great
teachers may do noble work, as the
history of learning clearly shows.
Wherever placed, the great man
leaves a mark on all with whom he
comes in contact. Professor Osborn
of Columbia once refered to the lie
lief that the American college, with
its happy-go-lucky lack of system,
could never produce a Darwin. In
opposition to this view, I claimed that
it could quite as readily as any other
system, given, of course, the raw ma
terial to work upon.
To my mind, in the making or a
great naturalist three things are
necessary: the original material, the
fine human stuff; next, contact with
nature; and finally, the help and ex
ample of a great teacher. These three
factors co-operated in the life of
Darwin. It is clear that Cambridge
and Edinburgh as schools of science,
did not make him. He himself bears
witness to the "incredible dullness"
of the lectures he heard. If that were
all, Stanford University could cer
tainly have done a better job.
Essentials of Greatness
But the first essential, the raw ma
terial, the choice mosaic of germ
plasm—this was already there to work
upon, and this no school could create.
The second element, contact with
nature—a free gift to all who seek it
—Darwin found on the moors of Cam
bridgeshire, by its brooks and its
bridges. In fullest measure, Califor
nia offers the same to all.
As to the third essential, the spell
of a great life, this Cambridge pro
vided. Darwin himself gives the clue.
He says that he "walked with liens
low," and Henslow was one of the
great botanists of bis time. To walk
with Henslow was in itself a gener
ous education. To make possible such
relations is the university's choicest
function. It should furnish the Hens
lows with whom the Darwins may
walk.
For the permanent values of a uni
versity center in its faculty. All the
virtues of mind and soul should be
theirs collectively, and as far as may
be, individually,—friendliness, self-de
votion, intellectual honesty, sincerity
I of purpose, love of work, strength to
; carry it on, accuracy, profundity,

broadmindedness, reverence, refine
ment, above all else, an unshaken and
unshakeable faith in human nature —
each one of these is vitally essential.
This may not all be detected in any
one man or woman, bat they must ap
pear in the composite whole.
Principles of Beginning
Nevertheless, whatever stress may
justly be laid on the personality of
teachers, one must not undervalue de
tails of organization. Traditions there
are that belittle, regulations that
starve or cramp, details that irritate,
and limitations that waste. A uni
versity should be framed for advance
ment. The chambers of its soul
should widen as the years go by.
Whatever bounds it imposes on itself
should be flexible and temporary.
Then as its life grows more complex,
it must frame certain rules of pro
cedure. The value of these rules will
rest on the principle that lies behind
them. Stanford was free to choose its
own educational principles. The four
most fundamental with which we
started were (a) the democracy of
mental powers, (b) the elective sys
tem, (c) the major department ar
rangement, and (d) the vital import
ance of individual initiative as the
prime element in character building.
With these, coeducation and the ap
plication of science were taken as mat
ters of course.
Aim of Quality Chosen
Negatively, we did not believe in
prescribed courses of study, in the
disciplinary value of undigested learn
ing, in promoting scholarship by pro
hibitions, by marks, honors, prizes, or
by financial subsidies as baits in
the educational trap. Furthermore, we
resolved that a university need not be
valued for its bigness, nor even for
the variety of its functions, believing
it better to do a few things well than
to strive weakly to cover the whole
ground of learning. For the ultimate
function of the endowed university
must be differentiated from that of the
state institution. It is the duty of
the latter to minister to all the higher
educational needs of the state. It is
the privilege of the former to set
standards of aim and standards of
achievement.
And further still, we conceived of
university life as an opportunity, to
be looked on as such by all who
came. Those who did not rise to its
stimulus were better somewhere else.
So because the chief source of human
wastage in our republic is the open
saloon, from the first we refused to
enter into rivalry with this, —or any
other institution that fattens on men's
weaknesses. The chains of a vile
habit inhibit wholesome development.
"Free should the scholar be, free and
brave."
Democracy of Mental Powers
Let us go bark to our four prin
ciples of organization, to consider
them in some detail. And here I must
ask the kind indulgence of all whose
fate it has been for a quarter of cen
tury to hear me expound in theory
and in practice the element of free
dom in education. That has been our
watchword. And because from the be

ginning we wished to emphasize the
value of intellectual freedom, of dis
cipline which is self-imposed, not
vouchsafed from above, we chose as
our academic motto the words of Ill
rich von Hutten, spoken four centur
ies ago, "Die Luft der Freheit weht,"
"The winds of freedom are blowing."
Democracy of the mind was the in
spiration of the early days of Cornell
University. Under its lead, we of the
pioneer clas-s of 1872 established our
first college journal. We called it
"The Cornell Era." For it truly
marked a new era in college history
when college men studied engineering
and agriculture along with Greek and
Latin, when even in a literary course
geology and botany might be counted
towards a degree. That such sub
jects could be accepted was the pri
mary reason why I myself went to
Cornell and not to Yale.
Democracy of the mind was not the
discovery of Andrew D. White, its
greatest apostle. No great idea orig
inates perhaps with any one person.
Hut at Cornell it was first developed
in workable fashion. It holds that
all mental powers should be recog
nized as free and equal, each alike
entitled to make the most of itself.
In this spirit, Ezra Cornell had said,
"I would found an institution in which
any person may find instruction in
any study." Indeed, it is not for the
university to foster any aristocracy of
studies. It shall not maintain Latin
or Greek or philosophy or physics, or
anything else, as a primary essential
in education, or that those whose
minds do not turn in some favored
direction shall be left uneducated. All
the powers of the mind, the applica
tion of knowledge as well as its ex
tension and preservation, are the sub
ject-matter of the university.
Elective System Adopted
Such a conception of higher educa
tion naturally finds its expression in
the elective system, which involves
the abandonment of the old idea in
volved in the word "curriculum" or
little race-course, with its low and
high hurdles, its "little go" and its
"great go," around which the student
moved for three or four years, return
ing at commencement for his final re
ward. The more tedious the discip
line, the greater was its supposed
value, and the reward for penance
done lay in the goodfellowship which
common boredom entailed. Under the
pressure of the widening of human
knowledge, the applications of sci
ence and the insistence of human
needs, the American college has
changed its theory in these regards.
The curriculum is no longer a race
course. Its participants do not run in
a circle, but set out in all directions
along widely divergent paths. For
the new appeal of widened helpful
ness has brought into the college new
and variant types of men, with variant
needs. Teachers brought up under the
old regime have generally ill under
stood how to deal with these. Mean
while the new appeal has brought new
popularities and it must be admitted
that many students are sent to the
universites because they have shown
no promise anywhere else.

Two Classes'of Students
College students in general may be
divided into two classes: those who
care and those who don't. Only the
first class need be considered. What
ever the needs of the others, their
place is not in the college. Students
who care may be again divided as to
the impulse, whether volitional or vo
cational, which compels their interest.
The best students in each field are
those who work for the love of it.
They may be classical scholars,
"Greek-minded men or Roman-minded
men," to use Emerson's phrase, or
they may be botanists, anatomists,
physiologists, chemists, teachers, phil
ologists, historians, engineers, econ
omists, physicians or jurists. They
may spring up in any field, and they
work to the limit for the mere joy of
working. The investigators of the
world, those who widen the scope of
knowledge in an appreciable degree,
belong to this class. Every door
should be held wide open for them,
and not one of them should be com
pelled to turn out of his way by the
lure of a.degree.
The vocational impulse has also its
place in the higher training. It may
express itself in perseverance rather
than in enthusiasm. A man will stick
to an uninteresting topic if he can
relate it to the affairs of life. An in
telligent student will always recognize
vocational reasons for pushing onward
to success. This is why the engineer
ing students in our universities are,
broadly speaking, better scholars than
students of literature. They see that
their future depends absolutely on
preparation. They are to deal with
the forces of nature, and nature
brooks no ignorance or deception..
They say at Harvard, "One is a fool
to study in the college; one is a fool
not to study in the law school." It
is a matter of common observation
that in professional schools of high
standards even the idler and the
dilettante may suddenly rise to hon
est work.
Joy in Vocational Training
It is, therefore, not a forward move
ment, for colleges and universities to
turn away from vocational studies in
the interest of pure culture. The vo
cation. however, must not be narrow
ly construed, as a man of force in any
field needs as wide a horizon as the
university can give him. No effort is
wasted if undertaken conscientiously
and with the purpose of adding found
ation on which one's specialty may
rest. Hut without volitional or voca
tional relations, without joy in the
work or hope in its final completion,
a boy would better keep out of col
lege and turn his attention as soon as
possible to something which to him is
real.
In the beginning Stanford Univer
sity adopted the elective system with
open eyes, certain that no other one
made possible the best scholarship.
The old classical course has not
broken down under the pressure of
live subjects and live issues. It rested
on the noble basis of Greek thought
and Greek expression. Its ideal look-
ed backward and upward to the loft
iest achievements of the human race
in the matter of beauty of form, of
language and of thought. As Thoreau
once observed, "Those only talk of
forgetting Greek who never knew it."
To the "Greek-minded man" these four
years in academic shades in company
with gracious thoughts were most sat
isfying and enlarging.
Hut the course was narrow and
special, and some thirty years ago it
began to give place to that condition
of affairs which I have elsewhere
called the "patchwork" stage of the
curriculum. The expansion of the
natural and physical sciences, each
one changing the whole current of
thought in its field; the demands of
French and German literature; a new
attitude towards the movements of
history; the growth of economics, jur
isprudence, modern philosophy, not
safe nor sane perhaps, but drawn
from the study of things as they are,
—all these, one by one or altogether,
clamored for a place in college
courses. Slowly, grudgingly, all were
admitted, crowding out, in greater or
less measure, Greek, calculus and
Latin. Each new subject, like the
camel with its head under the tent,
moved forward to occupy. Each sub
ject, old and new, was squeezed to
the briefest possible compass, though
the new ones were no more compre
hensible than the old. It was clear
before long that not all could be
brought into one uniform course. To
that end several arrangements were
devised, in each of which some edu
cational faction should have its way
But these ill adjusted and shifting
courses were necessarily less special
ized and therefore less thorough than
the old classical one, and as ad
vanced work in one subject has a
greater cultural value than elementary
work in several, so in almost every
regard the patchwork system marked
a step downward.
This period, however, was only one
of transition, and led directly to the
elective system, which made thorough
ness possible in any one of many
lines. In a prescribed course the stu
dent has little or no choice, and yet
the element of choice is in itself a
leading factor in individual training.
A democratic institution should min
ister to all types of men in quest of
higher education. It matters not
through what agency the miracle is
wrought. It may be achieved through
the melting of vanadium steel or by
a study of the satires of Horace.
The structure of the cell-nucleus of
a tadpole is as intricate and may be
as fascinating as that of the British
constitution, or a drama of Euripides.
Under the elective system it is pos
sible for a teacher to do his finest
work. No longer occupied with "the
dregs of learning," as Agassiz once
termed the college course at Harvard,
he can lead the learner and thus lead
himself to the firing lines of science.
With students in earnest, advanced
and thorough work becomes possible.
Such students give the teacher new
life.
Elective System Marks New Growth.
With the enlarged usefulness which
marked the advent of the elective sys
tem twenty to thirty years ago, began
the new growth of the colleges. They
drew men of new kinds, and many
more of them than ever before. This
fresh impulse was dominant in the
early days of Stanford, and a like
stimulus soon gave new life to the
whole university world. Ready-made
courses, the acme of pedagogic lazi
ness, were discarded. Like ready
made clothing, such courses really fit
nobody, and an education, like a suit
of clothes, should be fitted to the man
who is to wear it.
Some criticisms still apply to the
elective system. It has not yet wholly
eliminated "the reluctant student."
Hut can any system do this? No plan
ever made a lazy man brilliant. It is
to the earnest and efficient that the
opportunities of college life should be
granted. As a rule, students do not
elect the easiest studies and those
who do soon find their enjoyments
elsewhere.
Further, we are told that the elec

tive system offers temptations to un
due or premature specialization. This
also is true, and premature specializa
tion, like other forms of precocious
virtue, is to be deprecated. But ex
perience does not show that the
danger of "undue specialization" is a
serious one. The current, in college
and out, mostly sets the other way.
The fact that a man ventures to spec
ialize at all, shows that he has a cer
tain independence of character for the
odds are against it. Specialization im
plies thoroughness. It gives to each
man a base-line by which he can
measure the attainments of others.
No knowledge comes amiss to an in
vestigator; but no investigator can af
ford to sacrifice his specialty for the
sake of breadth. Thoroughness is the
main point, and should take preced
ence over versatility. 1 do not advo
cate narrowness of sympathy or nar
rowness of culture. The broadest ed
ucation is none too broad for the
growing scholar in any field. But the
forces of the mind should not be scat
tered in guerilla bands, but marshalled
toward leadership.
Major Department Arrangement.
Recognizing the conditions from the
very first, Stanford attempted to
strengthen and support the principle
of election in studies by means of the
major department arrangement. This
plan as we know it at Stanford and
as more or less developed in several
other universities, among them Har
vard, was forshadowed in these words
of Agassiz to his students in 1873:
"A specialty is the backbone of edu
cation. The mind is made strong by
the thorough possession of some
thing."
The final test of the elective system
must be found in its results. What
sort of man does it produce? What
is its relation to the discipline neces
sary to effectiveness in life? Dis
cipline means self-control, the power
to subordinate personal interest to the
larger needs of societies or nations,
the power to co-operate with other
men in the accomplishment of worthy
results. In this matter our people
tend to undervalue our actual achieve
ments, for too often uniformity is
mistaken for discipline. Unques
tioned obedience is not discipline.
Real discipline involves response
with head and heart to the dictates
of individual conscience, the "cate
gorical imperative" as set forth by
Immanuel Kant-. The uncritical sub
mission now shown by the masses
in Central Europe stands in exact
opposition to the dictum of the great
philosopher.
The output of our colleges has not
the uniformity for which Europe has
striven. Much that Europe values,
justly or not, we have neglected in
the interest of newer and sometimes
weightier demands. Substance is
more important than polish, and in
itiative outweighs all other forms of
efficiency. It is our highest aim in
America to grant not merely a lib
eral education, but, to borrow a word
from Dr. Peabody, a "liberating edu
cation," which shall fit a man to meet
unforseen demands.
Pledged To Personal Inithitive.
Democratic discipline and paternal
discipline lie at opposite poles in
national development. Each has its
defenders in our republic as else
where. But as a nation we stand
pledged to the discipline that evolves
from within and rests on personal
initiative. Its results are unequal,
but in the long run it is more effic
ient as an impulse in individual or
social life. We work under orders as
before, but not sealed orders. The
true American belongs to a political
party or a religious organization, not
to take direction from it, but to use
it for purposes which he shares with
the group. To him the party or or
ganization is a means towards indi
vidual or social ends, not an end in
itself. In our higher education as in
our political affairs, we have rejected
paternal dictation. From the dis
cipline self-imposed arises a form of
social discipline, unselfish devotion to
a common cause, characteristic of a
land of undivided freedom. The
highest patriotism, the patriotism of
humanity, cannot develop in a people

whose every man is a patient cog in
the wheels of a social, industrial or
military machine.
Appreciation of College >lenin War.
In a discussion of the affairs of
Belgium, Professor Vernon L. Kellogg
makes this reference to the work of
these students: "There are many
other bits that might be told. Only
one shall I add. It is a word of ap
preciation of the young Americans—
I am an old one—who offered their
services and performed their work in
a way to bring warmth to the heart
and mist to the eyes of a believer in
our country and its way of producing
men. Most of these helpers—a few
more than seventy Americans have
been so far in the service—are young
college men, a considerable fraction
of them.being Rhodes scholars from
the various Oxford colleges. Trained
in college for anything but the specific
work of the commission, they seem
to have found a training that, added
to a natural initiative, has made them
capable actors in the world's work.
Thrown into a situation requiring tact
and utmost discretion, loaded with
large responsibilities and asked to
take care of themselves and import
ant affairs of the commission under
most unusual circumstances, they
have done it, almost to a man, with
success. They have won the admira
tion of the Belgians and Germans
alike. They make one proud of
America and they lend great encour
agement to an observer of American
educational methods. Viewed in their
workings, these methods have seemed
to many of us very faulty; viewed in
their results, so far as young America
is a result of education at all, our too
easy pessimism is given a proper un
settling. I return to my university
chair with renewed confidence in
American educational work."
Man Trained for Man's Work.
The democratic type of educational
discipline aims to train a man to do
a man's work in life. It should help
him to strike at the heart of world
problems for himself, guided by no
precedent. Tt enables him to act in
telligently where others are contented
with blind feeling. In the future of
Europe the transfer of its activities
from the control of the few to the
welfare of the many, the American
scholar may prove a leading or even
a determining factor.
But after all consideration of uni
versity organization and of Stanford's
participation in it, we come back to
our first proposition, ihe imperative
ness of personality. A university is
a human group. In the long run it is
what its teachers make it. Through
the resultant of all the influences that
go out from tlieni its personality is
developed. The personality of Stan
ford for these twenty-five years has
been a very friendly one. In the first
year, teachers and students lived to
gether in Eneina Hall, and when our
world and everybody in it was young,
sometimes one could hardly tell pro
fessors and students apart. The
schools of old Japan, they say, prided
themselves on the fact that the teach
ers were merely the elder scholars,
"sen-sei," they called them, "those
born before." It is moreover record
ed of these teachers, "They knew each
of us by name."
Such a condition existed in the
early days of Stanford. We as teach
ers seemed, to ourselves at least, not
much older than our students. In the
pioneer classes, we knew everyone by
name. Happily we know them still.
And while increasing numbers and the
unifying tendencies which beset every
student body have made it no longer
possible for each of us to know all of
you by name, the old habit remains.
We are still students too—only a bit
farther along. So when we meet in
the world outside, it is as friends and
fellows devoted to each other, to our
university, our nation and our ideals.
Women Temper "Stanford Spirit."
One large factor in the temper of
constructive friendliness which we
call "the Stanford spirit" comes from
the welcome presence of the Stanford
women. I remember well the feverish
haste in which Mrs. Stanford com
pleted Roble Hall between the middle
of June and the last day of September

twenty-five years ago. She said that
the women must be in at the very be
ginning, otherwise they would always
be considered as interlopers. They
should be at home at Stanford, and
from the very first day.
Whatever the future of the univer
sity, we hope that the spirit of mu
tual trust and mutual friendliness, so
potent in the early days, will always
abide here. Changes in organization
and development must come. We
trust that changes in spirit will ap
pear only as intensification.
Today we are mounting the brow
of the hill from which we look for
ward to the future as well as back
over the past. In material ways it
has been a rocky road, with perils of
litigation, financial crises, emergen
cies of earthquake and fire, misunder
standings sometimes within and with
out. But all these are left behind
and the great future opens out. We
stand, indeed, before the very Gate of
Hercules.
Progress Result of Unrest.
They say that the American univer
sity is now in a period of unrest. It
always is. Out of unrest flows pro
gress. All our institutions are in
process of change. Nothing has yet
permanent form. Straight ahead of
us at Stanford may be seen the sep
aration of the junior college. This
means the expansion of the higher
work, a more thorough training of
men "for direct usefulness in life"
than is involved in the conventional
college education. The hour for the
change need not be hastened. It will
hasten itself. The limitation in num
bers already forced upon us is a bid
for the best, a guarantee of the high
est possible service.
(■ranting of Diplomas a Privilege.
Today I look back over a long life
of teaching. 1 began it with the sole
ambition to become a naturalist, an
explorer, with an abounding passion
for geography as related to the life
of plants and animals and men. I had
never the slightest longing for execu
tive responsibility until circumstances
thrust this upon me. Rut T can see
that there is no experience in life, no
position of trust or honor, no field of
endeavor which 112 would have chosen
instead above what the fortunes of
life have assigned to me. Twenty
five years ago my colleague, President
Thwing of Western Reserve, wrote me
in congratulation, "T would rather be
President of Stanford University than
Emperor." So would I, and so would
1 again if I hart my life to live over.
Tt is the college president's func
tion not to govern, but to help; not
to rule, but to co-ordinate. His suc
cess rests on the devotion of the col
leagues with whom he surrounds
himself. With large risks and larger
trials, he has also unsurpassed op
portunities. He deals with a nation's
"youth of promise" and he meets
their parents on their best. side.
I am not unmindful of the generous
freedom accorded me by the Poard of
Trustees for the last three years with
the title of Chancellor. Put among
the experiences of my life, I count
this with the best, that nearly r>ooo
Stanford men and women have re
reived their diplomas from my hand.
To begin with, these young people
were choice spirits, else they would
never have gone to college, never
have come to Stanford University.
Here they have lived with Nature at
her best, and have "walked with
Henslows" of all types and degrees.
Finally, they have gone down "the
ppu.w atn o}m (I s.<ua\ api.w .inoj
ctich to do his nan in a brave and
reasonable way. I have met these
men and women in every state in the
Union, in London, in Germany, in
Australia, in Korea, in Japan. Some
little part, in the achievements of each
of them 1 claim for myself, a much
larger part 112 claim for my colleagues.
Leadership In Stanford Hands.
And this is our exceeding great
and unfailing reward, the only one we
ask, a grateful remembrance of our
work. Put not the least of our satis
faction in this hour lies in the cer
tainty that Stanford's leadership lies
in Stanford's hands. No stone of the
edifice we have builded during the

last twenty-five years need be rejected
in the foundation of the preater Stan
ford which is to come.
This day rounds out the first Quar
ter Century of Stanford University,
the best part of a lifetime for me and
for those of my colleagues who gath
ered around me in the early days.
This day I stand before you in some
sense as their spokesman and advo
cate. What account can we render of
our stewardship on the threshold of a
new cycle?
Speaking for myself, who have
been for forty-six years a teacher of
college men and women, I shall not
leave the fairest field of human effort
without profound emotion. But this
1 do not ask you to share. None of us
are here to stay, none of us would
halt, the procession. The old Rou
manian proverb, "Our blood goes over
into the veins of the young," we ac
cept without flinching. Young men
and young universities move faster
than old ones, and in this fact Stan
ford finds part of the secret of her
success.
Outlines Academic Ideal
Something of this success and the
elements which made it I shall try
to set before you today. I shall not
speak again of the founders' wisdom.
I have already on another occasion
recounted, largely in Mr. Stanford's
own words, his sane ideals of educa
tion and his generous plans for carry
ing them into effect. The story of the
six dark years, illuminated and saved
by the devoted loyalty of Mrs. Stan
ford, I have told at still another time
as well as I could. My present task
is to give you some account of the
principles embodied in the academic
life of the institution itself without
reference to particular individuals or
special events.
First of all, Stanford University had
for its basis a lofty moral and spir
itual purpose born of the fair hope
and the fi*ee hand which its founders
held out to us. Moreover, its roman
tic origin at once lifted it out of the
commonplace. Furthermore, as we
dreamed, it was not to duplicate old
successes or older failures, but was
to mark a new era, so we hoped, in
the training of men and women. In
a word, it was to bring the education
of tomorrow straight to the youth of
today.
Unhampered by Tradition
In those marvelous days of creative
opportunity, we were hampered by no
prearranged rule of action. No tra
dition from the old world or the new
laid on us its dead hand. As the
young president standing in the west
end of the Quadrangle proclaimed on
that eventful first day of October,
1891: "Our University has no history
to fall back upon. Xo memories of
great teachers haunt its corridors. In
none of its rooms appear the traces
which show where a great man has
lived and worked. No tender asso
ciations cling, ivy-like, to its fresh
new walls. It is hallowed by no tra
ditions. It is hampered by none. Its
finger posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow, as the
splendid lily from the modest bulb."
To be sure, we had then all the ex

perlence of the world to fall back
upon. But we were to draw our own
conclusions. Nothing forced us to use
it in any specified way. Any method
quantity was found in the ever-vary
ing traits of human nature. And on
the recognition of this infinite variety
our scheme was primarily based.
Every form of talent, we held, was
worthy of training. To develop
strength we must bring out person
ality. To this end we must first have
teachers adequate for their responsi
bilities. A university performs its
function not in what it compels, still
less in what it forbids, but in its pro
vision for intensifying the student's
best abilities.
Organization Second
Organization is a secondary thing.
It will come soon enough. Like age,
it creeps on us unawares. So the
fewer rules the better until rules make
themselves. Under the worst possible
organization, or none at all. great
teachers may do noble work, as the
history of learning clearly shows.
Wherever placed, the great man
leaves a mark on all with whom he
comes in contact. Professor Osborn
of Columbia once refered to the lie
lief that the American college, with
its happy-go-lucky lack of system,
could never produce a Darwin. In
opposition to this view, I claimed that
it could quite as readily as any other
system, given, of course, the raw ma
terial to work upon.
To my mind, in the making or a
great naturalist three things are
necessary: the original material, the
fine human stuff; next, contact with
nature; and finally, the help and ex
ample of a great teacher. These three
factors co-operated in the life of
Darwin. It is clear that Cambridge
and Edinburgh as schools of science,
did not make him. He himself bears
witness to the "incredible dullness"
of the lectures he heard. If that were
all, Stanford University could cer
tainly have done a better job.
Essentials of Greatness
But the first essential, the raw ma
terial, the choice mosaic of germ
plasm—this was already there to work
upon, and this no school could create.
The second element, contact with
nature—a free gift to all who seek it
—Darwin found on the moors of Cam
bridgeshire, by its brooks and its
bridges. In fullest measure, Califor
nia offers the same to all.
As to the third essential, the spell
of a great life, this Cambridge pro
vided. Darwin himself gives the clue.
He says that he "walked with liens
low," and Henslow was one of the
great botanists of bis time. To walk
with Henslow was in itself a gener
ous education. To make possible such
relations is the university's choicest
function. It should furnish the Hens
lows with whom the Darwins may
walk.
For the permanent values of a uni
versity center in its faculty. All the
virtues of mind and soul should be
theirs collectively, and as far as may
be, individually,—friendliness, self-de
votion, intellectual honesty, sincerity
I of purpose, love of work, strength to
; carry it on, accuracy, profundity,

broadmindedness, reverence, refine
ment, above all else, an unshaken and
unshakeable faith in human nature —
each one of these is vitally essential.
This may not all be detected in any
one man or woman, bat they must ap
pear in the composite whole.
Principles of Beginning
Nevertheless, whatever stress may
justly be laid on the personality of
teachers, one must not undervalue de
tails of organization. Traditions there
are that belittle, regulations that
starve or cramp, details that irritate,
and limitations that waste. A uni
versity should be framed for advance
ment. The chambers of its soul
should widen as the years go by.
Whatever bounds it imposes on itself
should be flexible and temporary.
Then as its life grows more complex,
it must frame certain rules of pro
cedure. The value of these rules will
rest on the principle that lies behind
them. Stanford was free to choose its
own educational principles. The four
most fundamental with which we
started were (a) the democracy of
mental powers, (b) the elective sys
tem, (c) the major department ar
rangement, and (d) the vital import
ance of individual initiative as the
prime element in character building.
With these, coeducation and the ap
plication of science were taken as mat
ters of course.
Aim of Quality Chosen
Negatively, we did not believe in
prescribed courses of study, in the
disciplinary value of undigested learn
ing, in promoting scholarship by pro
hibitions, by marks, honors, prizes, or
by financial subsidies as baits in
the educational trap. Furthermore, we
resolved that a university need not be
valued for its bigness, nor even for
the variety of its functions, believing
it better to do a few things well than
to strive weakly to cover the whole
ground of learning. For the ultimate
function of the endowed university
must be differentiated from that of the
state institution. It is the duty of
the latter to minister to all the higher
educational needs of the state. It is
the privilege of the former to set
standards of aim and standards of
achievement.
And further still, we conceived of
university life as an opportunity, to
be looked on as such by all who
came. Those who did not rise to its
stimulus were better somewhere else.
So because the chief source of human
wastage in our republic is the open
saloon, from the first we refused to
enter into rivalry with this, —or any
other institution that fattens on men's
weaknesses. The chains of a vile
habit inhibit wholesome development.
"Free should the scholar be, free and
brave."
Democracy of Mental Powers
Let us go bark to our four prin
ciples of organization, to consider
them in some detail. And here I must
ask the kind indulgence of all whose
fate it has been for a quarter of cen
tury to hear me expound in theory
and in practice the element of free
dom in education. That has been our
watchword. And because from the be

ginning we wished to emphasize the
value of intellectual freedom, of dis
cipline which is self-imposed, not
vouchsafed from above, we chose as
our academic motto the words of Ill
rich von Hutten, spoken four centur
ies ago, "Die Luft der Freheit weht,"
"The winds of freedom are blowing."
Democracy of the mind was the in
spiration of the early days of Cornell
University. Under its lead, we of the
pioneer clas-s of 1872 established our
first college journal. We called it
"The Cornell Era." For it truly
marked a new era in college history
when college men studied engineering
and agriculture along with Greek and
Latin, when even in a literary course
geology and botany might be counted
towards a degree. That such sub
jects could be accepted was the pri
mary reason why I myself went to
Cornell and not to Yale.
Democracy of the mind was not the
discovery of Andrew D. White, its
greatest apostle. No great idea orig
inates perhaps with any one person.
Hut at Cornell it was first developed
in workable fashion. It holds that
all mental powers should be recog
nized as free and equal, each alike
entitled to make the most of itself.
In this spirit, Ezra Cornell had said,
"I would found an institution in which
any person may find instruction in
any study." Indeed, it is not for the
university to foster any aristocracy of
studies. It shall not maintain Latin
or Greek or philosophy or physics, or
anything else, as a primary essential
in education, or that those whose
minds do not turn in some favored
direction shall be left uneducated. All
the powers of the mind, the applica
tion of knowledge as well as its ex
tension and preservation, are the sub
ject-matter of the university.
Elective System Adopted
Such a conception of higher educa
tion naturally finds its expression in
the elective system, which involves
the abandonment of the old idea in
volved in the word "curriculum" or
little race-course, with its low and
high hurdles, its "little go" and its
"great go," around which the student
moved for three or four years, return
ing at commencement for his final re
ward. The more tedious the discip
line, the greater was its supposed
value, and the reward for penance
done lay in the goodfellowship which
common boredom entailed. Under the
pressure of the widening of human
knowledge, the applications of sci
ence and the insistence of human
needs, the American college has
changed its theory in these regards.
The curriculum is no longer a race
course. Its participants do not run in
a circle, but set out in all directions
along widely divergent paths. For
the new appeal of widened helpful
ness has brought into the college new
and variant types of men, with variant
needs. Teachers brought up under the
old regime have generally ill under
stood how to deal with these. Mean
while the new appeal has brought new
popularities and it must be admitted
that many students are sent to the
universites because they have shown
no promise anywhere else.

Two Classes'of Students
College students in general may be
divided into two classes: those who
care and those who don't. Only the
first class need be considered. What
ever the needs of the others, their
place is not in the college. Students
who care may be again divided as to
the impulse, whether volitional or vo
cational, which compels their interest.
The best students in each field are
those who work for the love of it.
They may be classical scholars,
"Greek-minded men or Roman-minded
men," to use Emerson's phrase, or
they may be botanists, anatomists,
physiologists, chemists, teachers, phil
ologists, historians, engineers, econ
omists, physicians or jurists. They
may spring up in any field, and they
work to the limit for the mere joy of
working. The investigators of the
world, those who widen the scope of
knowledge in an appreciable degree,
belong to this class. Every door
should be held wide open for them,
and not one of them should be com
pelled to turn out of his way by the
lure of a.degree.
The vocational impulse has also its
place in the higher training. It may
express itself in perseverance rather
than in enthusiasm. A man will stick
to an uninteresting topic if he can
relate it to the affairs of life. An in
telligent student will always recognize
vocational reasons for pushing onward
to success. This is why the engineer
ing students in our universities are,
broadly speaking, better scholars than
students of literature. They see that
their future depends absolutely on
preparation. They are to deal with
the forces of nature, and nature
brooks no ignorance or deception..
They say at Harvard, "One is a fool
to study in the college; one is a fool
not to study in the law school." It
is a matter of common observation
that in professional schools of high
standards even the idler and the
dilettante may suddenly rise to hon
est work.
Joy in Vocational Training
It is, therefore, not a forward move
ment, for colleges and universities to
turn away from vocational studies in
the interest of pure culture. The vo
cation. however, must not be narrow
ly construed, as a man of force in any
field needs as wide a horizon as the
university can give him. No effort is
wasted if undertaken conscientiously
and with the purpose of adding found
ation on which one's specialty may
rest. Hut without volitional or voca
tional relations, without joy in the
work or hope in its final completion,
a boy would better keep out of col
lege and turn his attention as soon as
possible to something which to him is
real.
In the beginning Stanford Univer
sity adopted the elective system with
open eyes, certain that no other one
made possible the best scholarship.
The old classical course has not
broken down under the pressure of
live subjects and live issues. It rested
on the noble basis of Greek thought
and Greek expression. Its ideal look-
ed backward and upward to the loft
iest achievements of the human race
in the matter of beauty of form, of
language and of thought. As Thoreau
once observed, "Those only talk of
forgetting Greek who never knew it."
To the "Greek-minded man" these four
years in academic shades in company
with gracious thoughts were most sat
isfying and enlarging.
Hut the course was narrow and
special, and some thirty years ago it
began to give place to that condition
of affairs which I have elsewhere
called the "patchwork" stage of the
curriculum. The expansion of the
natural and physical sciences, each
one changing the whole current of
thought in its field; the demands of
French and German literature; a new
attitude towards the movements of
history; the growth of economics, jur
isprudence, modern philosophy, not
safe nor sane perhaps, but drawn
from the study of things as they are,
—all these, one by one or altogether,
clamored for a place in college
courses. Slowly, grudgingly, all were
admitted, crowding out, in greater or
less measure, Greek, calculus and
Latin. Each new subject, like the
camel with its head under the tent,
moved forward to occupy. Each sub
ject, old and new, was squeezed to
the briefest possible compass, though
the new ones were no more compre
hensible than the old. It was clear
before long that not all could be
brought into one uniform course. To
that end several arrangements were
devised, in each of which some edu
cational faction should have its way
But these ill adjusted and shifting
courses were necessarily less special
ized and therefore less thorough than
the old classical one, and as ad
vanced work in one subject has a
greater cultural value than elementary
work in several, so in almost every
regard the patchwork system marked
a step downward.
This period, however, was only one
of transition, and led directly to the
elective system, which made thorough
ness possible in any one of many
lines. In a prescribed course the stu
dent has little or no choice, and yet
the element of choice is in itself a
leading factor in individual training.
A democratic institution should min
ister to all types of men in quest of
higher education. It matters not
through what agency the miracle is
wrought. It may be achieved through
the melting of vanadium steel or by
a study of the satires of Horace.
The structure of the cell-nucleus of
a tadpole is as intricate and may be
as fascinating as that of the British
constitution, or a drama of Euripides.
Under the elective system it is pos
sible for a teacher to do his finest
work. No longer occupied with "the
dregs of learning," as Agassiz once
termed the college course at Harvard,
he can lead the learner and thus lead
himself to the firing lines of science.
With students in earnest, advanced
and thorough work becomes possible.
Such students give the teacher new
life.
Elective System Marks New Growth.
With the enlarged usefulness which
marked the advent of the elective sys
tem twenty to thirty years ago, began
the new growth of the colleges. They
drew men of new kinds, and many
more of them than ever before. This
fresh impulse was dominant in the
early days of Stanford, and a like
stimulus soon gave new life to the
whole university world. Ready-made
courses, the acme of pedagogic lazi
ness, were discarded. Like ready
made clothing, such courses really fit
nobody, and an education, like a suit
of clothes, should be fitted to the man
who is to wear it.
Some criticisms still apply to the
elective system. It has not yet wholly
eliminated "the reluctant student."
Hut can any system do this? No plan
ever made a lazy man brilliant. It is
to the earnest and efficient that the
opportunities of college life should be
granted. As a rule, students do not
elect the easiest studies and those
who do soon find their enjoyments
elsewhere.
Further, we are told that the elec

tive system offers temptations to un
due or premature specialization. This
also is true, and premature specializa
tion, like other forms of precocious
virtue, is to be deprecated. But ex
perience does not show that the
danger of "undue specialization" is a
serious one. The current, in college
and out, mostly sets the other way.
The fact that a man ventures to spec
ialize at all, shows that he has a cer
tain independence of character for the
odds are against it. Specialization im
plies thoroughness. It gives to each
man a base-line by which he can
measure the attainments of others.
No knowledge comes amiss to an in
vestigator; but no investigator can af
ford to sacrifice his specialty for the
sake of breadth. Thoroughness is the
main point, and should take preced
ence over versatility. 1 do not advo
cate narrowness of sympathy or nar
rowness of culture. The broadest ed
ucation is none too broad for the
growing scholar in any field. But the
forces of the mind should not be scat
tered in guerilla bands, but marshalled
toward leadership.
Major Department Arrangement.
Recognizing the conditions from the
very first, Stanford attempted to
strengthen and support the principle
of election in studies by means of the
major department arrangement. This
plan as we know it at Stanford and
as more or less developed in several
other universities, among them Har
vard, was forshadowed in these words
of Agassiz to his students in 1873:
"A specialty is the backbone of edu
cation. The mind is made strong by
the thorough possession of some
thing."
The final test of the elective system
must be found in its results. What
sort of man does it produce? What
is its relation to the discipline neces
sary to effectiveness in life? Dis
cipline means self-control, the power
to subordinate personal interest to the
larger needs of societies or nations,
the power to co-operate with other
men in the accomplishment of worthy
results. In this matter our people
tend to undervalue our actual achieve
ments, for too often uniformity is
mistaken for discipline. Unques
tioned obedience is not discipline.
Real discipline involves response
with head and heart to the dictates
of individual conscience, the "cate
gorical imperative" as set forth by
Immanuel Kant-. The uncritical sub
mission now shown by the masses
in Central Europe stands in exact
opposition to the dictum of the great
philosopher.
The output of our colleges has not
the uniformity for which Europe has
striven. Much that Europe values,
justly or not, we have neglected in
the interest of newer and sometimes
weightier demands. Substance is
more important than polish, and in
itiative outweighs all other forms of
efficiency. It is our highest aim in
America to grant not merely a lib
eral education, but, to borrow a word
from Dr. Peabody, a "liberating edu
cation," which shall fit a man to meet
unforseen demands.
Pledged To Personal Inithitive.
Democratic discipline and paternal
discipline lie at opposite poles in
national development. Each has its
defenders in our republic as else
where. But as a nation we stand
pledged to the discipline that evolves
from within and rests on personal
initiative. Its results are unequal,
but in the long run it is more effic
ient as an impulse in individual or
social life. We work under orders as
before, but not sealed orders. The
true American belongs to a political
party or a religious organization, not
to take direction from it, but to use
it for purposes which he shares with
the group. To him the party or or
ganization is a means towards indi
vidual or social ends, not an end in
itself. In our higher education as in
our political affairs, we have rejected
paternal dictation. From the dis
cipline self-imposed arises a form of
social discipline, unselfish devotion to
a common cause, characteristic of a
land of undivided freedom. The
highest patriotism, the patriotism of
humanity, cannot develop in a people

whose every man is a patient cog in
the wheels of a social, industrial or
military machine.
Appreciation of College >lenin War.
In a discussion of the affairs of
Belgium, Professor Vernon L. Kellogg
makes this reference to the work of
these students: "There are many
other bits that might be told. Only
one shall I add. It is a word of ap
preciation of the young Americans—
I am an old one—who offered their
services and performed their work in
a way to bring warmth to the heart
and mist to the eyes of a believer in
our country and its way of producing
men. Most of these helpers—a few
more than seventy Americans have
been so far in the service—are young
college men, a considerable fraction
of them.being Rhodes scholars from
the various Oxford colleges. Trained
in college for anything but the specific
work of the commission, they seem
to have found a training that, added
to a natural initiative, has made them
capable actors in the world's work.
Thrown into a situation requiring tact
and utmost discretion, loaded with
large responsibilities and asked to
take care of themselves and import
ant affairs of the commission under
most unusual circumstances, they
have done it, almost to a man, with
success. They have won the admira
tion of the Belgians and Germans
alike. They make one proud of
America and they lend great encour
agement to an observer of American
educational methods. Viewed in their
workings, these methods have seemed
to many of us very faulty; viewed in
their results, so far as young America
is a result of education at all, our too
easy pessimism is given a proper un
settling. I return to my university
chair with renewed confidence in
American educational work."
Man Trained for Man's Work.
The democratic type of educational
discipline aims to train a man to do
a man's work in life. It should help
him to strike at the heart of world
problems for himself, guided by no
precedent. Tt enables him to act in
telligently where others are contented
with blind feeling. In the future of
Europe the transfer of its activities
from the control of the few to the
welfare of the many, the American
scholar may prove a leading or even
a determining factor.
But after all consideration of uni
versity organization and of Stanford's
participation in it, we come back to
our first proposition, ihe imperative
ness of personality. A university is
a human group. In the long run it is
what its teachers make it. Through
the resultant of all the influences that
go out from tlieni its personality is
developed. The personality of Stan
ford for these twenty-five years has
been a very friendly one. In the first
year, teachers and students lived to
gether in Eneina Hall, and when our
world and everybody in it was young,
sometimes one could hardly tell pro
fessors and students apart. The
schools of old Japan, they say, prided
themselves on the fact that the teach
ers were merely the elder scholars,
"sen-sei," they called them, "those
born before." It is moreover record
ed of these teachers, "They knew each
of us by name."
Such a condition existed in the
early days of Stanford. We as teach
ers seemed, to ourselves at least, not
much older than our students. In the
pioneer classes, we knew everyone by
name. Happily we know them still.
And while increasing numbers and the
unifying tendencies which beset every
student body have made it no longer
possible for each of us to know all of
you by name, the old habit remains.
We are still students too—only a bit
farther along. So when we meet in
the world outside, it is as friends and
fellows devoted to each other, to our
university, our nation and our ideals.
Women Temper "Stanford Spirit."
One large factor in the temper of
constructive friendliness which we
call "the Stanford spirit" comes from
the welcome presence of the Stanford
women. I remember well the feverish
haste in which Mrs. Stanford com
pleted Roble Hall between the middle
of June and the last day of September

twenty-five years ago. She said that
the women must be in at the very be
ginning, otherwise they would always
be considered as interlopers. They
should be at home at Stanford, and
from the very first day.
Whatever the future of the univer
sity, we hope that the spirit of mu
tual trust and mutual friendliness, so
potent in the early days, will always
abide here. Changes in organization
and development must come. We
trust that changes in spirit will ap
pear only as intensification.
Today we are mounting the brow
of the hill from which we look for
ward to the future as well as back
over the past. In material ways it
has been a rocky road, with perils of
litigation, financial crises, emergen
cies of earthquake and fire, misunder
standings sometimes within and with
out. But all these are left behind
and the great future opens out. We
stand, indeed, before the very Gate of
Hercules.
Progress Result of Unrest.
They say that the American univer
sity is now in a period of unrest. It
always is. Out of unrest flows pro
gress. All our institutions are in
process of change. Nothing has yet
permanent form. Straight ahead of
us at Stanford may be seen the sep
aration of the junior college. This
means the expansion of the higher
work, a more thorough training of
men "for direct usefulness in life"
than is involved in the conventional
college education. The hour for the
change need not be hastened. It will
hasten itself. The limitation in num
bers already forced upon us is a bid
for the best, a guarantee of the high
est possible service.
(■ranting of Diplomas a Privilege.
Today I look back over a long life
of teaching. 1 began it with the sole
ambition to become a naturalist, an
explorer, with an abounding passion
for geography as related to the life
of plants and animals and men. I had
never the slightest longing for execu
tive responsibility until circumstances
thrust this upon me. Rut T can see
that there is no experience in life, no
position of trust or honor, no field of
endeavor which 112 would have chosen
instead above what the fortunes of
life have assigned to me. Twenty
five years ago my colleague, President
Thwing of Western Reserve, wrote me
in congratulation, "T would rather be
President of Stanford University than
Emperor." So would I, and so would
1 again if I hart my life to live over.
Tt is the college president's func
tion not to govern, but to help; not
to rule, but to co-ordinate. His suc
cess rests on the devotion of the col
leagues with whom he surrounds
himself. With large risks and larger
trials, he has also unsurpassed op
portunities. He deals with a nation's
"youth of promise" and he meets
their parents on their best. side.
I am not unmindful of the generous
freedom accorded me by the Poard of
Trustees for the last three years with
the title of Chancellor. Put among
the experiences of my life, I count
this with the best, that nearly r>ooo
Stanford men and women have re
reived their diplomas from my hand.
To begin with, these young people
were choice spirits, else they would
never have gone to college, never
have come to Stanford University.
Here they have lived with Nature at
her best, and have "walked with
Henslows" of all types and degrees.
Finally, they have gone down "the
ppu.w atn o}m (I s.<ua\ api.w .inoj
ctich to do his nan in a brave and
reasonable way. I have met these
men and women in every state in the
Union, in London, in Germany, in
Australia, in Korea, in Japan. Some
little part, in the achievements of each
of them 1 claim for myself, a much
larger part 112 claim for my colleagues.
Leadership In Stanford Hands.
And this is our exceeding great
and unfailing reward, the only one we
ask, a grateful remembrance of our
work. Put not the least of our satis
faction in this hour lies in the cer
tainty that Stanford's leadership lies
in Stanford's hands. No stone of the
edifice we have builded during the

last twenty-five years need be rejected
in the foundation of the preater Stan
ford which is to come.
This day rounds out the first Quar
ter Century of Stanford University,
the best part of a lifetime for me and
for those of my colleagues who gath
ered around me in the early days.
This day I stand before you in some
sense as their spokesman and advo
cate. What account can we render of
our stewardship on the threshold of a
new cycle?
Speaking for myself, who have
been for forty-six years a teacher of
college men and women, I shall not
leave the fairest field of human effort
without profound emotion. But this
1 do not ask you to share. None of us
are here to stay, none of us would
halt, the procession. The old Rou
manian proverb, "Our blood goes over
into the veins of the young," we ac
cept without flinching. Young men
and young universities move faster
than old ones, and in this fact Stan
ford finds part of the secret of her
success.
Outlines Academic Ideal
Something of this success and the
elements which made it I shall try
to set before you today. I shall not
speak again of the founders' wisdom.
I have already on another occasion
recounted, largely in Mr. Stanford's
own words, his sane ideals of educa
tion and his generous plans for carry
ing them into effect. The story of the
six dark years, illuminated and saved
by the devoted loyalty of Mrs. Stan
ford, I have told at still another time
as well as I could. My present task
is to give you some account of the
principles embodied in the academic
life of the institution itself without
reference to particular individuals or
special events.
First of all, Stanford University had
for its basis a lofty moral and spir
itual purpose born of the fair hope
and the fi*ee hand which its founders
held out to us. Moreover, its roman
tic origin at once lifted it out of the
commonplace. Furthermore, as we
dreamed, it was not to duplicate old
successes or older failures, but was
to mark a new era, so we hoped, in
the training of men and women. In
a word, it was to bring the education
of tomorrow straight to the youth of
today.
Unhampered by Tradition
In those marvelous days of creative
opportunity, we were hampered by no
prearranged rule of action. No tra
dition from the old world or the new
laid on us its dead hand. As the
young president standing in the west
end of the Quadrangle proclaimed on
that eventful first day of October,
1891: "Our University has no history
to fall back upon. Xo memories of
great teachers haunt its corridors. In
none of its rooms appear the traces
which show where a great man has
lived and worked. No tender asso
ciations cling, ivy-like, to its fresh
new walls. It is hallowed by no tra
ditions. It is hampered by none. Its
finger posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow, as the
splendid lily from the modest bulb."
To be sure, we had then all the ex

perlence of the world to fall back
upon. But we were to draw our own
conclusions. Nothing forced us to use
it in any specified way. Any method
quantity was found in the ever-vary
ing traits of human nature. And on
the recognition of this infinite variety
our scheme was primarily based.
Every form of talent, we held, was
worthy of training. To develop
strength we must bring out person
ality. To this end we must first have
teachers adequate for their responsi
bilities. A university performs its
function not in what it compels, still
less in what it forbids, but in its pro
vision for intensifying the student's
best abilities.
Organization Second
Organization is a secondary thing.
It will come soon enough. Like age,
it creeps on us unawares. So the
fewer rules the better until rules make
themselves. Under the worst possible
organization, or none at all. great
teachers may do noble work, as the
history of learning clearly shows.
Wherever placed, the great man
leaves a mark on all with whom he
comes in contact. Professor Osborn
of Columbia once refered to the lie
lief that the American college, with
its happy-go-lucky lack of system,
could never produce a Darwin. In
opposition to this view, I claimed that
it could quite as readily as any other
system, given, of course, the raw ma
terial to work upon.
To my mind, in the making or a
great naturalist three things are
necessary: the original material, the
fine human stuff; next, contact with
nature; and finally, the help and ex
ample of a great teacher. These three
factors co-operated in the life of
Darwin. It is clear that Cambridge
and Edinburgh as schools of science,
did not make him. He himself bears
witness to the "incredible dullness"
of the lectures he heard. If that were
all, Stanford University could cer
tainly have done a better job.
Essentials of Greatness
But the first essential, the raw ma
terial, the choice mosaic of germ
plasm—this was already there to work
upon, and this no school could create.
The second element, contact with
nature—a free gift to all who seek it
—Darwin found on the moors of Cam
bridgeshire, by its brooks and its
bridges. In fullest measure, Califor
nia offers the same to all.
As to the third essential, the spell
of a great life, this Cambridge pro
vided. Darwin himself gives the clue.
He says that he "walked with liens
low," and Henslow was one of the
great botanists of bis time. To walk
with Henslow was in itself a gener
ous education. To make possible such
relations is the university's choicest
function. It should furnish the Hens
lows with whom the Darwins may
walk.
For the permanent values of a uni
versity center in its faculty. All the
virtues of mind and soul should be
theirs collectively, and as far as may
be, individually,—friendliness, self-de
votion, intellectual honesty, sincerity
I of purpose, love of work, strength to
; carry it on, accuracy, profundity,

broadmindedness, reverence, refine
ment, above all else, an unshaken and
unshakeable faith in human nature —
each one of these is vitally essential.
This may not all be detected in any
one man or woman, bat they must ap
pear in the composite whole.
Principles of Beginning
Nevertheless, whatever stress may
justly be laid on the personality of
teachers, one must not undervalue de
tails of organization. Traditions there
are that belittle, regulations that
starve or cramp, details that irritate,
and limitations that waste. A uni
versity should be framed for advance
ment. The chambers of its soul
should widen as the years go by.
Whatever bounds it imposes on itself
should be flexible and temporary.
Then as its life grows more complex,
it must frame certain rules of pro
cedure. The value of these rules will
rest on the principle that lies behind
them. Stanford was free to choose its
own educational principles. The four
most fundamental with which we
started were (a) the democracy of
mental powers, (b) the elective sys
tem, (c) the major department ar
rangement, and (d) the vital import
ance of individual initiative as the
prime element in character building.
With these, coeducation and the ap
plication of science were taken as mat
ters of course.
Aim of Quality Chosen
Negatively, we did not believe in
prescribed courses of study, in the
disciplinary value of undigested learn
ing, in promoting scholarship by pro
hibitions, by marks, honors, prizes, or
by financial subsidies as baits in
the educational trap. Furthermore, we
resolved that a university need not be
valued for its bigness, nor even for
the variety of its functions, believing
it better to do a few things well than
to strive weakly to cover the whole
ground of learning. For the ultimate
function of the endowed university
must be differentiated from that of the
state institution. It is the duty of
the latter to minister to all the higher
educational needs of the state. It is
the privilege of the former to set
standards of aim and standards of
achievement.
And further still, we conceived of
university life as an opportunity, to
be looked on as such by all who
came. Those who did not rise to its
stimulus were better somewhere else.
So because the chief source of human
wastage in our republic is the open
saloon, from the first we refused to
enter into rivalry with this, —or any
other institution that fattens on men's
weaknesses. The chains of a vile
habit inhibit wholesome development.
"Free should the scholar be, free and
brave."
Democracy of Mental Powers
Let us go bark to our four prin
ciples of organization, to consider
them in some detail. And here I must
ask the kind indulgence of all whose
fate it has been for a quarter of cen
tury to hear me expound in theory
and in practice the element of free
dom in education. That has been our
watchword. And because from the be

ginning we wished to emphasize the
value of intellectual freedom, of dis
cipline which is self-imposed, not
vouchsafed from above, we chose as
our academic motto the words of Ill
rich von Hutten, spoken four centur
ies ago, "Die Luft der Freheit weht,"
"The winds of freedom are blowing."
Democracy of the mind was the in
spiration of the early days of Cornell
University. Under its lead, we of the
pioneer clas-s of 1872 established our
first college journal. We called it
"The Cornell Era." For it truly
marked a new era in college history
when college men studied engineering
and agriculture along with Greek and
Latin, when even in a literary course
geology and botany might be counted
towards a degree. That such sub
jects could be accepted was the pri
mary reason why I myself went to
Cornell and not to Yale.
Democracy of the mind was not the
discovery of Andrew D. White, its
greatest apostle. No great idea orig
inates perhaps with any one person.
Hut at Cornell it was first developed
in workable fashion. It holds that
all mental powers should be recog
nized as free and equal, each alike
entitled to make the most of itself.
In this spirit, Ezra Cornell had said,
"I would found an institution in which
any person may find instruction in
any study." Indeed, it is not for the
university to foster any aristocracy of
studies. It shall not maintain Latin
or Greek or philosophy or physics, or
anything else, as a primary essential
in education, or that those whose
minds do not turn in some favored
direction shall be left uneducated. All
the powers of the mind, the applica
tion of knowledge as well as its ex
tension and preservation, are the sub
ject-matter of the university.
Elective System Adopted
Such a conception of higher educa
tion naturally finds its expression in
the elective system, which involves
the abandonment of the old idea in
volved in the word "curriculum" or
little race-course, with its low and
high hurdles, its "little go" and its
"great go," around which the student
moved for three or four years, return
ing at commencement for his final re
ward. The more tedious the discip
line, the greater was its supposed
value, and the reward for penance
done lay in the goodfellowship which
common boredom entailed. Under the
pressure of the widening of human
knowledge, the applications of sci
ence and the insistence of human
needs, the American college has
changed its theory in these regards.
The curriculum is no longer a race
course. Its participants do not run in
a circle, but set out in all directions
along widely divergent paths. For
the new appeal of widened helpful
ness has brought into the college new
and variant types of men, with variant
needs. Teachers brought up under the
old regime have generally ill under
stood how to deal with these. Mean
while the new appeal has brought new
popularities and it must be admitted
that many students are sent to the
universites because they have shown
no promise anywhere else.

Two Classes'of Students
College students in general may be
divided into two classes: those who
care and those who don't. Only the
first class need be considered. What
ever the needs of the others, their
place is not in the college. Students
who care may be again divided as to
the impulse, whether volitional or vo
cational, which compels their interest.
The best students in each field are
those who work for the love of it.
They may be classical scholars,
"Greek-minded men or Roman-minded
men," to use Emerson's phrase, or
they may be botanists, anatomists,
physiologists, chemists, teachers, phil
ologists, historians, engineers, econ
omists, physicians or jurists. They
may spring up in any field, and they
work to the limit for the mere joy of
working. The investigators of the
world, those who widen the scope of
knowledge in an appreciable degree,
belong to this class. Every door
should be held wide open for them,
and not one of them should be com
pelled to turn out of his way by the
lure of a.degree.
The vocational impulse has also its
place in the higher training. It may
express itself in perseverance rather
than in enthusiasm. A man will stick
to an uninteresting topic if he can
relate it to the affairs of life. An in
telligent student will always recognize
vocational reasons for pushing onward
to success. This is why the engineer
ing students in our universities are,
broadly speaking, better scholars than
students of literature. They see that
their future depends absolutely on
preparation. They are to deal with
the forces of nature, and nature
brooks no ignorance or deception..
They say at Harvard, "One is a fool
to study in the college; one is a fool
not to study in the law school." It
is a matter of common observation
that in professional schools of high
standards even the idler and the
dilettante may suddenly rise to hon
est work.
Joy in Vocational Training
It is, therefore, not a forward move
ment, for colleges and universities to
turn away from vocational studies in
the interest of pure culture. The vo
cation. however, must not be narrow
ly construed, as a man of force in any
field needs as wide a horizon as the
university can give him. No effort is
wasted if undertaken conscientiously
and with the purpose of adding found
ation on which one's specialty may
rest. Hut without volitional or voca
tional relations, without joy in the
work or hope in its final completion,
a boy would better keep out of col
lege and turn his attention as soon as
possible to something which to him is
real.
In the beginning Stanford Univer
sity adopted the elective system with
open eyes, certain that no other one
made possible the best scholarship.
The old classical course has not
broken down under the pressure of
live subjects and live issues. It rested
on the noble basis of Greek thought
and Greek expression. Its ideal look-
ed backward and upward to the loft
iest achievements of the human race
in the matter of beauty of form, of
language and of thought. As Thoreau
once observed, "Those only talk of
forgetting Greek who never knew it."
To the "Greek-minded man" these four
years in academic shades in company
with gracious thoughts were most sat
isfying and enlarging.
Hut the course was narrow and
special, and some thirty years ago it
began to give place to that condition
of affairs which I have elsewhere
called the "patchwork" stage of the
curriculum. The expansion of the
natural and physical sciences, each
one changing the whole current of
thought in its field; the demands of
French and German literature; a new
attitude towards the movements of
history; the growth of economics, jur
isprudence, modern philosophy, not
safe nor sane perhaps, but drawn
from the study of things as they are,
—all these, one by one or altogether,
clamored for a place in college
courses. Slowly, grudgingly, all were
admitted, crowding out, in greater or
less measure, Greek, calculus and
Latin. Each new subject, like the
camel with its head under the tent,
moved forward to occupy. Each sub
ject, old and new, was squeezed to
the briefest possible compass, though
the new ones were no more compre
hensible than the old. It was clear
before long that not all could be
brought into one uniform course. To
that end several arrangements were
devised, in each of which some edu
cational faction should have its way
But these ill adjusted and shifting
courses were necessarily less special
ized and therefore less thorough than
the old classical one, and as ad
vanced work in one subject has a
greater cultural value than elementary
work in several, so in almost every
regard the patchwork system marked
a step downward.
This period, however, was only one
of transition, and led directly to the
elective system, which made thorough
ness possible in any one of many
lines. In a prescribed course the stu
dent has little or no choice, and yet
the element of choice is in itself a
leading factor in individual training.
A democratic institution should min
ister to all types of men in quest of
higher education. It matters not
through what agency the miracle is
wrought. It may be achieved through
the melting of vanadium steel or by
a study of the satires of Horace.
The structure of the cell-nucleus of
a tadpole is as intricate and may be
as fascinating as that of the British
constitution, or a drama of Euripides.
Under the elective system it is pos
sible for a teacher to do his finest
work. No longer occupied with "the
dregs of learning," as Agassiz once
termed the college course at Harvard,
he can lead the learner and thus lead
himself to the firing lines of science.
With students in earnest, advanced
and thorough work becomes possible.
Such students give the teacher new
life.
Elective System Marks New Growth.
With the enlarged usefulness which
marked the advent of the elective sys
tem twenty to thirty years ago, began
the new growth of the colleges. They
drew men of new kinds, and many
more of them than ever before. This
fresh impulse was dominant in the
early days of Stanford, and a like
stimulus soon gave new life to the
whole university world. Ready-made
courses, the acme of pedagogic lazi
ness, were discarded. Like ready
made clothing, such courses really fit
nobody, and an education, like a suit
of clothes, should be fitted to the man
who is to wear it.
Some criticisms still apply to the
elective system. It has not yet wholly
eliminated "the reluctant student."
Hut can any system do this? No plan
ever made a lazy man brilliant. It is
to the earnest and efficient that the
opportunities of college life should be
granted. As a rule, students do not
elect the easiest studies and those
who do soon find their enjoyments
elsewhere.
Further, we are told that the elec

tive system offers temptations to un
due or premature specialization. This
also is true, and premature specializa
tion, like other forms of precocious
virtue, is to be deprecated. But ex
perience does not show that the
danger of "undue specialization" is a
serious one. The current, in college
and out, mostly sets the other way.
The fact that a man ventures to spec
ialize at all, shows that he has a cer
tain independence of character for the
odds are against it. Specialization im
plies thoroughness. It gives to each
man a base-line by which he can
measure the attainments of others.
No knowledge comes amiss to an in
vestigator; but no investigator can af
ford to sacrifice his specialty for the
sake of breadth. Thoroughness is the
main point, and should take preced
ence over versatility. 1 do not advo
cate narrowness of sympathy or nar
rowness of culture. The broadest ed
ucation is none too broad for the
growing scholar in any field. But the
forces of the mind should not be scat
tered in guerilla bands, but marshalled
toward leadership.
Major Department Arrangement.
Recognizing the conditions from the
very first, Stanford attempted to
strengthen and support the principle
of election in studies by means of the
major department arrangement. This
plan as we know it at Stanford and
as more or less developed in several
other universities, among them Har
vard, was forshadowed in these words
of Agassiz to his students in 1873:
"A specialty is the backbone of edu
cation. The mind is made strong by
the thorough possession of some
thing."
The final test of the elective system
must be found in its results. What
sort of man does it produce? What
is its relation to the discipline neces
sary to effectiveness in life? Dis
cipline means self-control, the power
to subordinate personal interest to the
larger needs of societies or nations,
the power to co-operate with other
men in the accomplishment of worthy
results. In this matter our people
tend to undervalue our actual achieve
ments, for too often uniformity is
mistaken for discipline. Unques
tioned obedience is not discipline.
Real discipline involves response
with head and heart to the dictates
of individual conscience, the "cate
gorical imperative" as set forth by
Immanuel Kant-. The uncritical sub
mission now shown by the masses
in Central Europe stands in exact
opposition to the dictum of the great
philosopher.
The output of our colleges has not
the uniformity for which Europe has
striven. Much that Europe values,
justly or not, we have neglected in
the interest of newer and sometimes
weightier demands. Substance is
more important than polish, and in
itiative outweighs all other forms of
efficiency. It is our highest aim in
America to grant not merely a lib
eral education, but, to borrow a word
from Dr. Peabody, a "liberating edu
cation," which shall fit a man to meet
unforseen demands.
Pledged To Personal Inithitive.
Democratic discipline and paternal
discipline lie at opposite poles in
national development. Each has its
defenders in our republic as else
where. But as a nation we stand
pledged to the discipline that evolves
from within and rests on personal
initiative. Its results are unequal,
but in the long run it is more effic
ient as an impulse in individual or
social life. We work under orders as
before, but not sealed orders. The
true American belongs to a political
party or a religious organization, not
to take direction from it, but to use
it for purposes which he shares with
the group. To him the party or or
ganization is a means towards indi
vidual or social ends, not an end in
itself. In our higher education as in
our political affairs, we have rejected
paternal dictation. From the dis
cipline self-imposed arises a form of
social discipline, unselfish devotion to
a common cause, characteristic of a
land of undivided freedom. The
highest patriotism, the patriotism of
humanity, cannot develop in a people

whose every man is a patient cog in
the wheels of a social, industrial or
military machine.
Appreciation of College >lenin War.
In a discussion of the affairs of
Belgium, Professor Vernon L. Kellogg
makes this reference to the work of
these students: "There are many
other bits that might be told. Only
one shall I add. It is a word of ap
preciation of the young Americans—
I am an old one—who offered their
services and performed their work in
a way to bring warmth to the heart
and mist to the eyes of a believer in
our country and its way of producing
men. Most of these helpers—a few
more than seventy Americans have
been so far in the service—are young
college men, a considerable fraction
of them.being Rhodes scholars from
the various Oxford colleges. Trained
in college for anything but the specific
work of the commission, they seem
to have found a training that, added
to a natural initiative, has made them
capable actors in the world's work.
Thrown into a situation requiring tact
and utmost discretion, loaded with
large responsibilities and asked to
take care of themselves and import
ant affairs of the commission under
most unusual circumstances, they
have done it, almost to a man, with
success. They have won the admira
tion of the Belgians and Germans
alike. They make one proud of
America and they lend great encour
agement to an observer of American
educational methods. Viewed in their
workings, these methods have seemed
to many of us very faulty; viewed in
their results, so far as young America
is a result of education at all, our too
easy pessimism is given a proper un
settling. I return to my university
chair with renewed confidence in
American educational work."
Man Trained for Man's Work.
The democratic type of educational
discipline aims to train a man to do
a man's work in life. It should help
him to strike at the heart of world
problems for himself, guided by no
precedent. Tt enables him to act in
telligently where others are contented
with blind feeling. In the future of
Europe the transfer of its activities
from the control of the few to the
welfare of the many, the American
scholar may prove a leading or even
a determining factor.
But after all consideration of uni
versity organization and of Stanford's
participation in it, we come back to
our first proposition, ihe imperative
ness of personality. A university is
a human group. In the long run it is
what its teachers make it. Through
the resultant of all the influences that
go out from tlieni its personality is
developed. The personality of Stan
ford for these twenty-five years has
been a very friendly one. In the first
year, teachers and students lived to
gether in Eneina Hall, and when our
world and everybody in it was young,
sometimes one could hardly tell pro
fessors and students apart. The
schools of old Japan, they say, prided
themselves on the fact that the teach
ers were merely the elder scholars,
"sen-sei," they called them, "those
born before." It is moreover record
ed of these teachers, "They knew each
of us by name."
Such a condition existed in the
early days of Stanford. We as teach
ers seemed, to ourselves at least, not
much older than our students. In the
pioneer classes, we knew everyone by
name. Happily we know them still.
And while increasing numbers and the
unifying tendencies which beset every
student body have made it no longer
possible for each of us to know all of
you by name, the old habit remains.
We are still students too—only a bit
farther along. So when we meet in
the world outside, it is as friends and
fellows devoted to each other, to our
university, our nation and our ideals.
Women Temper "Stanford Spirit."
One large factor in the temper of
constructive friendliness which we
call "the Stanford spirit" comes from
the welcome presence of the Stanford
women. I remember well the feverish
haste in which Mrs. Stanford com
pleted Roble Hall between the middle
of June and the last day of September

twenty-five years ago. She said that
the women must be in at the very be
ginning, otherwise they would always
be considered as interlopers. They
should be at home at Stanford, and
from the very first day.
Whatever the future of the univer
sity, we hope that the spirit of mu
tual trust and mutual friendliness, so
potent in the early days, will always
abide here. Changes in organization
and development must come. We
trust that changes in spirit will ap
pear only as intensification.
Today we are mounting the brow
of the hill from which we look for
ward to the future as well as back
over the past. In material ways it
has been a rocky road, with perils of
litigation, financial crises, emergen
cies of earthquake and fire, misunder
standings sometimes within and with
out. But all these are left behind
and the great future opens out. We
stand, indeed, before the very Gate of
Hercules.
Progress Result of Unrest.
They say that the American univer
sity is now in a period of unrest. It
always is. Out of unrest flows pro
gress. All our institutions are in
process of change. Nothing has yet
permanent form. Straight ahead of
us at Stanford may be seen the sep
aration of the junior college. This
means the expansion of the higher
work, a more thorough training of
men "for direct usefulness in life"
than is involved in the conventional
college education. The hour for the
change need not be hastened. It will
hasten itself. The limitation in num
bers already forced upon us is a bid
for the best, a guarantee of the high
est possible service.
(■ranting of Diplomas a Privilege.
Today I look back over a long life
of teaching. 1 began it with the sole
ambition to become a naturalist, an
explorer, with an abounding passion
for geography as related to the life
of plants and animals and men. I had
never the slightest longing for execu
tive responsibility until circumstances
thrust this upon me. Rut T can see
that there is no experience in life, no
position of trust or honor, no field of
endeavor which 112 would have chosen
instead above what the fortunes of
life have assigned to me. Twenty
five years ago my colleague, President
Thwing of Western Reserve, wrote me
in congratulation, "T would rather be
President of Stanford University than
Emperor." So would I, and so would
1 again if I hart my life to live over.
Tt is the college president's func
tion not to govern, but to help; not
to rule, but to co-ordinate. His suc
cess rests on the devotion of the col
leagues with whom he surrounds
himself. With large risks and larger
trials, he has also unsurpassed op
portunities. He deals with a nation's
"youth of promise" and he meets
their parents on their best. side.
I am not unmindful of the generous
freedom accorded me by the Poard of
Trustees for the last three years with
the title of Chancellor. Put among
the experiences of my life, I count
this with the best, that nearly r>ooo
Stanford men and women have re
reived their diplomas from my hand.
To begin with, these young people
were choice spirits, else they would
never have gone to college, never
have come to Stanford University.
Here they have lived with Nature at
her best, and have "walked with
Henslows" of all types and degrees.
Finally, they have gone down "the
ppu.w atn o}m (I s.<ua\ api.w .inoj
ctich to do his nan in a brave and
reasonable way. I have met these
men and women in every state in the
Union, in London, in Germany, in
Australia, in Korea, in Japan. Some
little part, in the achievements of each
of them 1 claim for myself, a much
larger part 112 claim for my colleagues.
Leadership In Stanford Hands.
And this is our exceeding great
and unfailing reward, the only one we
ask, a grateful remembrance of our
work. Put not the least of our satis
faction in this hour lies in the cer
tainty that Stanford's leadership lies
in Stanford's hands. No stone of the
edifice we have builded during the

last twenty-five years need be rejected
in the foundation of the preater Stan
ford which is to come.
This day rounds out the first Quar
ter Century of Stanford University,
the best part of a lifetime for me and
for those of my colleagues who gath
ered around me in the early days.
This day I stand before you in some
sense as their spokesman and advo
cate. What account can we render of
our stewardship on the threshold of a
new cycle?
Speaking for myself, who have
been for forty-six years a teacher of
college men and women, I shall not
leave the fairest field of human effort
without profound emotion. But this
1 do not ask you to share. None of us
are here to stay, none of us would
halt, the procession. The old Rou
manian proverb, "Our blood goes over
into the veins of the young," we ac
cept without flinching. Young men
and young universities move faster
than old ones, and in this fact Stan
ford finds part of the secret of her
success.
Outlines Academic Ideal
Something of this success and the
elements which made it I shall try
to set before you today. I shall not
speak again of the founders' wisdom.
I have already on another occasion
recounted, largely in Mr. Stanford's
own words, his sane ideals of educa
tion and his generous plans for carry
ing them into effect. The story of the
six dark years, illuminated and saved
by the devoted loyalty of Mrs. Stan
ford, I have told at still another time
as well as I could. My present task
is to give you some account of the
principles embodied in the academic
life of the institution itself without
reference to particular individuals or
special events.
First of all, Stanford University had
for its basis a lofty moral and spir
itual purpose born of the fair hope
and the fi*ee hand which its founders
held out to us. Moreover, its roman
tic origin at once lifted it out of the
commonplace. Furthermore, as we
dreamed, it was not to duplicate old
successes or older failures, but was
to mark a new era, so we hoped, in
the training of men and women. In
a word, it was to bring the education
of tomorrow straight to the youth of
today.
Unhampered by Tradition
In those marvelous days of creative
opportunity, we were hampered by no
prearranged rule of action. No tra
dition from the old world or the new
laid on us its dead hand. As the
young president standing in the west
end of the Quadrangle proclaimed on
that eventful first day of October,
1891: "Our University has no history
to fall back upon. Xo memories of
great teachers haunt its corridors. In
none of its rooms appear the traces
which show where a great man has
lived and worked. No tender asso
ciations cling, ivy-like, to its fresh
new walls. It is hallowed by no tra
ditions. It is hampered by none. Its
finger posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow, as the
splendid lily from the modest bulb."
To be sure, we had then all the ex

perlence of the world to fall back
upon. But we were to draw our own
conclusions. Nothing forced us to use
it in any specified way. Any method
quantity was found in the ever-vary
ing traits of human nature. And on
the recognition of this infinite variety
our scheme was primarily based.
Every form of talent, we held, was
worthy of training. To develop
strength we must bring out person
ality. To this end we must first have
teachers adequate for their responsi
bilities. A university performs its
function not in what it compels, still
less in what it forbids, but in its pro
vision for intensifying the student's
best abilities.
Organization Second
Organization is a secondary thing.
It will come soon enough. Like age,
it creeps on us unawares. So the
fewer rules the better until rules make
themselves. Under the worst possible
organization, or none at all. great
teachers may do noble work, as the
history of learning clearly shows.
Wherever placed, the great man
leaves a mark on all with whom he
comes in contact. Professor Osborn
of Columbia once refered to the lie
lief that the American college, with
its happy-go-lucky lack of system,
could never produce a Darwin. In
opposition to this view, I claimed that
it could quite as readily as any other
system, given, of course, the raw ma
terial to work upon.
To my mind, in the making or a
great naturalist three things are
necessary: the original material, the
fine human stuff; next, contact with
nature; and finally, the help and ex
ample of a great teacher. These three
factors co-operated in the life of
Darwin. It is clear that Cambridge
and Edinburgh as schools of science,
did not make him. He himself bears
witness to the "incredible dullness"
of the lectures he heard. If that were
all, Stanford University could cer
tainly have done a better job.
Essentials of Greatness
But the first essential, the raw ma
terial, the choice mosaic of germ
plasm—this was already there to work
upon, and this no school could create.
The second element, contact with
nature—a free gift to all who seek it
—Darwin found on the moors of Cam
bridgeshire, by its brooks and its
bridges. In fullest measure, Califor
nia offers the same to all.
As to the third essential, the spell
of a great life, this Cambridge pro
vided. Darwin himself gives the clue.
He says that he "walked with liens
low," and Henslow was one of the
great botanists of bis time. To walk
with Henslow was in itself a gener
ous education. To make possible such
relations is the university's choicest
function. It should furnish the Hens
lows with whom the Darwins may
walk.
For the permanent values of a uni
versity center in its faculty. All the
virtues of mind and soul should be
theirs collectively, and as far as may
be, individually,—friendliness, self-de
votion, intellectual honesty, sincerity
I of purpose, love of work, strength to
; carry it on, accuracy, profundity,

broadmindedness, reverence, refine
ment, above all else, an unshaken and
unshakeable faith in human nature —
each one of these is vitally essential.
This may not all be detected in any
one man or woman, bat they must ap
pear in the composite whole.
Principles of Beginning
Nevertheless, whatever stress may
justly be laid on the personality of
teachers, one must not undervalue de
tails of organization. Traditions there
are that belittle, regulations that
starve or cramp, details that irritate,
and limitations that waste. A uni
versity should be framed for advance
ment. The chambers of its soul
should widen as the years go by.
Whatever bounds it imposes on itself
should be flexible and temporary.
Then as its life grows more complex,
it must frame certain rules of pro
cedure. The value of these rules will
rest on the principle that lies behind
them. Stanford was free to choose its
own educational principles. The four
most fundamental with which we
started were (a) the democracy of
mental powers, (b) the elective sys
tem, (c) the major department ar
rangement, and (d) the vital import
ance of individual initiative as the
prime element in character building.
With these, coeducation and the ap
plication of science were taken as mat
ters of course.
Aim of Quality Chosen
Negatively, we did not believe in
prescribed courses of study, in the
disciplinary value of undigested learn
ing, in promoting scholarship by pro
hibitions, by marks, honors, prizes, or
by financial subsidies as baits in
the educational trap. Furthermore, we
resolved that a university need not be
valued for its bigness, nor even for
the variety of its functions, believing
it better to do a few things well than
to strive weakly to cover the whole
ground of learning. For the ultimate
function of the endowed university
must be differentiated from that of the
state institution. It is the duty of
the latter to minister to all the higher
educational needs of the state. It is
the privilege of the former to set
standards of aim and standards of
achievement.
And further still, we conceived of
university life as an opportunity, to
be looked on as such by all who
came. Those who did not rise to its
stimulus were better somewhere else.
So because the chief source of human
wastage in our republic is the open
saloon, from the first we refused to
enter into rivalry with this, —or any
other institution that fattens on men's
weaknesses. The chains of a vile
habit inhibit wholesome development.
"Free should the scholar be, free and
brave."
Democracy of Mental Powers
Let us go bark to our four prin
ciples of organization, to consider
them in some detail. And here I must
ask the kind indulgence of all whose
fate it has been for a quarter of cen
tury to hear me expound in theory
and in practice the element of free
dom in education. That has been our
watchword. And because from the be

ginning we wished to emphasize the
value of intellectual freedom, of dis
cipline which is self-imposed, not
vouchsafed from above, we chose as
our academic motto the words of Ill
rich von Hutten, spoken four centur
ies ago, "Die Luft der Freheit weht,"
"The winds of freedom are blowing."
Democracy of the mind was the in
spiration of the early days of Cornell
University. Under its lead, we of the
pioneer clas-s of 1872 established our
first college journal. We called it
"The Cornell Era." For it truly
marked a new era in college history
when college men studied engineering
and agriculture along with Greek and
Latin, when even in a literary course
geology and botany might be counted
towards a degree. That such sub
jects could be accepted was the pri
mary reason why I myself went to
Cornell and not to Yale.
Democracy of the mind was not the
discovery of Andrew D. White, its
greatest apostle. No great idea orig
inates perhaps with any one person.
Hut at Cornell it was first developed
in workable fashion. It holds that
all mental powers should be recog
nized as free and equal, each alike
entitled to make the most of itself.
In this spirit, Ezra Cornell had said,
"I would found an institution in which
any person may find instruction in
any study." Indeed, it is not for the
university to foster any aristocracy of
studies. It shall not maintain Latin
or Greek or philosophy or physics, or
anything else, as a primary essential
in education, or that those whose
minds do not turn in some favored
direction shall be left uneducated. All
the powers of the mind, the applica
tion of knowledge as well as its ex
tension and preservation, are the sub
ject-matter of the university.
Elective System Adopted
Such a conception of higher educa
tion naturally finds its expression in
the elective system, which involves
the abandonment of the old idea in
volved in the word "curriculum" or
little race-course, with its low and
high hurdles, its "little go" and its
"great go," around which the student
moved for three or four years, return
ing at commencement for his final re
ward. The more tedious the discip
line, the greater was its supposed
value, and the reward for penance
done lay in the goodfellowship which
common boredom entailed. Under the
pressure of the widening of human
knowledge, the applications of sci
ence and the insistence of human
needs, the American college has
changed its theory in these regards.
The curriculum is no longer a race
course. Its participants do not run in
a circle, but set out in all directions
along widely divergent paths. For
the new appeal of widened helpful
ness has brought into the college new
and variant types of men, with variant
needs. Teachers brought up under the
old regime have generally ill under
stood how to deal with these. Mean
while the new appeal has brought new
popularities and it must be admitted
that many students are sent to the
universites because they have shown
no promise anywhere else.

Two Classes'of Students
College students in general may be
divided into two classes: those who
care and those who don't. Only the
first class need be considered. What
ever the needs of the others, their
place is not in the college. Students
who care may be again divided as to
the impulse, whether volitional or vo
cational, which compels their interest.
The best students in each field are
those who work for the love of it.
They may be classical scholars,
"Greek-minded men or Roman-minded
men," to use Emerson's phrase, or
they may be botanists, anatomists,
physiologists, chemists, teachers, phil
ologists, historians, engineers, econ
omists, physicians or jurists. They
may spring up in any field, and they
work to the limit for the mere joy of
working. The investigators of the
world, those who widen the scope of
knowledge in an appreciable degree,
belong to this class. Every door
should be held wide open for them,
and not one of them should be com
pelled to turn out of his way by the
lure of a.degree.
The vocational impulse has also its
place in the higher training. It may
express itself in perseverance rather
than in enthusiasm. A man will stick
to an uninteresting topic if he can
relate it to the affairs of life. An in
telligent student will always recognize
vocational reasons for pushing onward
to success. This is why the engineer
ing students in our universities are,
broadly speaking, better scholars than
students of literature. They see that
their future depends absolutely on
preparation. They are to deal with
the forces of nature, and nature
brooks no ignorance or deception..
They say at Harvard, "One is a fool
to study in the college; one is a fool
not to study in the law school." It
is a matter of common observation
that in professional schools of high
standards even the idler and the
dilettante may suddenly rise to hon
est work.
Joy in Vocational Training
It is, therefore, not a forward move
ment, for colleges and universities to
turn away from vocational studies in
the interest of pure culture. The vo
cation. however, must not be narrow
ly construed, as a man of force in any
field needs as wide a horizon as the
university can give him. No effort is
wasted if undertaken conscientiously
and with the purpose of adding found
ation on which one's specialty may
rest. Hut without volitional or voca
tional relations, without joy in the
work or hope in its final completion,
a boy would better keep out of col
lege and turn his attention as soon as
possible to something which to him is
real.
In the beginning Stanford Univer
sity adopted the elective system with
open eyes, certain that no other one
made possible the best scholarship.
The old classical course has not
broken down under the pressure of
live subjects and live issues. It rested
on the noble basis of Greek thought
and Greek expression. Its ideal look-
ed backward and upward to the loft
iest achievements of the human race
in the matter of beauty of form, of
language and of thought. As Thoreau
once observed, "Those only talk of
forgetting Greek who never knew it."
To the "Greek-minded man" these four
years in academic shades in company
with gracious thoughts were most sat
isfying and enlarging.
Hut the course was narrow and
special, and some thirty years ago it
began to give place to that condition
of affairs which I have elsewhere
called the "patchwork" stage of the
curriculum. The expansion of the
natural and physical sciences, each
one changing the whole current of
thought in its field; the demands of
French and German literature; a new
attitude towards the movements of
history; the growth of economics, jur
isprudence, modern philosophy, not
safe nor sane perhaps, but drawn
from the study of things as they are,
—all these, one by one or altogether,
clamored for a place in college
courses. Slowly, grudgingly, all were
admitted, crowding out, in greater or
less measure, Greek, calculus and
Latin. Each new subject, like the
camel with its head under the tent,
moved forward to occupy. Each sub
ject, old and new, was squeezed to
the briefest possible compass, though
the new ones were no more compre
hensible than the old. It was clear
before long that not all could be
brought into one uniform course. To
that end several arrangements were
devised, in each of which some edu
cational faction should have its way
But these ill adjusted and shifting
courses were necessarily less special
ized and therefore less thorough than
the old classical one, and as ad
vanced work in one subject has a
greater cultural value than elementary
work in several, so in almost every
regard the patchwork system marked
a step downward.
This period, however, was only one
of transition, and led directly to the
elective system, which made thorough
ness possible in any one of many
lines. In a prescribed course the stu
dent has little or no choice, and yet
the element of choice is in itself a
leading factor in individual training.
A democratic institution should min
ister to all types of men in quest of
higher education. It matters not
through what agency the miracle is
wrought. It may be achieved through
the melting of vanadium steel or by
a study of the satires of Horace.
The structure of the cell-nucleus of
a tadpole is as intricate and may be
as fascinating as that of the British
constitution, or a drama of Euripides.
Under the elective system it is pos
sible for a teacher to do his finest
work. No longer occupied with "the
dregs of learning," as Agassiz once
termed the college course at Harvard,
he can lead the learner and thus lead
himself to the firing lines of science.
With students in earnest, advanced
and thorough work becomes possible.
Such students give the teacher new
life.
Elective System Marks New Growth.
With the enlarged usefulness which
marked the advent of the elective sys
tem twenty to thirty years ago, began
the new growth of the colleges. They
drew men of new kinds, and many
more of them than ever before. This
fresh impulse was dominant in the
early days of Stanford, and a like
stimulus soon gave new life to the
whole university world. Ready-made
courses, the acme of pedagogic lazi
ness, were discarded. Like ready
made clothing, such courses really fit
nobody, and an education, like a suit
of clothes, should be fitted to the man
who is to wear it.
Some criticisms still apply to the
elective system. It has not yet wholly
eliminated "the reluctant student."
Hut can any system do this? No plan
ever made a lazy man brilliant. It is
to the earnest and efficient that the
opportunities of college life should be
granted. As a rule, students do not
elect the easiest studies and those
who do soon find their enjoyments
elsewhere.
Further, we are told that the elec

tive system offers temptations to un
due or premature specialization. This
also is true, and premature specializa
tion, like other forms of precocious
virtue, is to be deprecated. But ex
perience does not show that the
danger of "undue specialization" is a
serious one. The current, in college
and out, mostly sets the other way.
The fact that a man ventures to spec
ialize at all, shows that he has a cer
tain independence of character for the
odds are against it. Specialization im
plies thoroughness. It gives to each
man a base-line by which he can
measure the attainments of others.
No knowledge comes amiss to an in
vestigator; but no investigator can af
ford to sacrifice his specialty for the
sake of breadth. Thoroughness is the
main point, and should take preced
ence over versatility. 1 do not advo
cate narrowness of sympathy or nar
rowness of culture. The broadest ed
ucation is none too broad for the
growing scholar in any field. But the
forces of the mind should not be scat
tered in guerilla bands, but marshalled
toward leadership.
Major Department Arrangement.
Recognizing the conditions from the
very first, Stanford attempted to
strengthen and support the principle
of election in studies by means of the
major department arrangement. This
plan as we know it at Stanford and
as more or less developed in several
other universities, among them Har
vard, was forshadowed in these words
of Agassiz to his students in 1873:
"A specialty is the backbone of edu
cation. The mind is made strong by
the thorough possession of some
thing."
The final test of the elective system
must be found in its results. What
sort of man does it produce? What
is its relation to the discipline neces
sary to effectiveness in life? Dis
cipline means self-control, the power
to subordinate personal interest to the
larger needs of societies or nations,
the power to co-operate with other
men in the accomplishment of worthy
results. In this matter our people
tend to undervalue our actual achieve
ments, for too often uniformity is
mistaken for discipline. Unques
tioned obedience is not discipline.
Real discipline involves response
with head and heart to the dictates
of individual conscience, the "cate
gorical imperative" as set forth by
Immanuel Kant-. The uncritical sub
mission now shown by the masses
in Central Europe stands in exact
opposition to the dictum of the great
philosopher.
The output of our colleges has not
the uniformity for which Europe has
striven. Much that Europe values,
justly or not, we have neglected in
the interest of newer and sometimes
weightier demands. Substance is
more important than polish, and in
itiative outweighs all other forms of
efficiency. It is our highest aim in
America to grant not merely a lib
eral education, but, to borrow a word
from Dr. Peabody, a "liberating edu
cation," which shall fit a man to meet
unforseen demands.
Pledged To Personal Inithitive.
Democratic discipline and paternal
discipline lie at opposite poles in
national development. Each has its
defenders in our republic as else
where. But as a nation we stand
pledged to the discipline that evolves
from within and rests on personal
initiative. Its results are unequal,
but in the long run it is more effic
ient as an impulse in individual or
social life. We work under orders as
before, but not sealed orders. The
true American belongs to a political
party or a religious organization, not
to take direction from it, but to use
it for purposes which he shares with
the group. To him the party or or
ganization is a means towards indi
vidual or social ends, not an end in
itself. In our higher education as in
our political affairs, we have rejected
paternal dictation. From the dis
cipline self-imposed arises a form of
social discipline, unselfish devotion to
a common cause, characteristic of a
land of undivided freedom. The
highest patriotism, the patriotism of
humanity, cannot develop in a people

whose every man is a patient cog in
the wheels of a social, industrial or
military machine.
Appreciation of College >lenin War.
In a discussion of the affairs of
Belgium, Professor Vernon L. Kellogg
makes this reference to the work of
these students: "There are many
other bits that might be told. Only
one shall I add. It is a word of ap
preciation of the young Americans—
I am an old one—who offered their
services and performed their work in
a way to bring warmth to the heart
and mist to the eyes of a believer in
our country and its way of producing
men. Most of these helpers—a few
more than seventy Americans have
been so far in the service—are young
college men, a considerable fraction
of them.being Rhodes scholars from
the various Oxford colleges. Trained
in college for anything but the specific
work of the commission, they seem
to have found a training that, added
to a natural initiative, has made them
capable actors in the world's work.
Thrown into a situation requiring tact
and utmost discretion, loaded with
large responsibilities and asked to
take care of themselves and import
ant affairs of the commission under
most unusual circumstances, they
have done it, almost to a man, with
success. They have won the admira
tion of the Belgians and Germans
alike. They make one proud of
America and they lend great encour
agement to an observer of American
educational methods. Viewed in their
workings, these methods have seemed
to many of us very faulty; viewed in
their results, so far as young America
is a result of education at all, our too
easy pessimism is given a proper un
settling. I return to my university
chair with renewed confidence in
American educational work."
Man Trained for Man's Work.
The democratic type of educational
discipline aims to train a man to do
a man's work in life. It should help
him to strike at the heart of world
problems for himself, guided by no
precedent. Tt enables him to act in
telligently where others are contented
with blind feeling. In the future of
Europe the transfer of its activities
from the control of the few to the
welfare of the many, the American
scholar may prove a leading or even
a determining factor.
But after all consideration of uni
versity organization and of Stanford's
participation in it, we come back to
our first proposition, ihe imperative
ness of personality. A university is
a human group. In the long run it is
what its teachers make it. Through
the resultant of all the influences that
go out from tlieni its personality is
developed. The personality of Stan
ford for these twenty-five years has
been a very friendly one. In the first
year, teachers and students lived to
gether in Eneina Hall, and when our
world and everybody in it was young,
sometimes one could hardly tell pro
fessors and students apart. The
schools of old Japan, they say, prided
themselves on the fact that the teach
ers were merely the elder scholars,
"sen-sei," they called them, "those
born before." It is moreover record
ed of these teachers, "They knew each
of us by name."
Such a condition existed in the
early days of Stanford. We as teach
ers seemed, to ourselves at least, not
much older than our students. In the
pioneer classes, we knew everyone by
name. Happily we know them still.
And while increasing numbers and the
unifying tendencies which beset every
student body have made it no longer
possible for each of us to know all of
you by name, the old habit remains.
We are still students too—only a bit
farther along. So when we meet in
the world outside, it is as friends and
fellows devoted to each other, to our
university, our nation and our ideals.
Women Temper "Stanford Spirit."
One large factor in the temper of
constructive friendliness which we
call "the Stanford spirit" comes from
the welcome presence of the Stanford
women. I remember well the feverish
haste in which Mrs. Stanford com
pleted Roble Hall between the middle
of June and the last day of September

twenty-five years ago. She said that
the women must be in at the very be
ginning, otherwise they would always
be considered as interlopers. They
should be at home at Stanford, and
from the very first day.
Whatever the future of the univer
sity, we hope that the spirit of mu
tual trust and mutual friendliness, so
potent in the early days, will always
abide here. Changes in organization
and development must come. We
trust that changes in spirit will ap
pear only as intensification.
Today we are mounting the brow
of the hill from which we look for
ward to the future as well as back
over the past. In material ways it
has been a rocky road, with perils of
litigation, financial crises, emergen
cies of earthquake and fire, misunder
standings sometimes within and with
out. But all these are left behind
and the great future opens out. We
stand, indeed, before the very Gate of
Hercules.
Progress Result of Unrest.
They say that the American univer
sity is now in a period of unrest. It
always is. Out of unrest flows pro
gress. All our institutions are in
process of change. Nothing has yet
permanent form. Straight ahead of
us at Stanford may be seen the sep
aration of the junior college. This
means the expansion of the higher
work, a more thorough training of
men "for direct usefulness in life"
than is involved in the conventional
college education. The hour for the
change need not be hastened. It will
hasten itself. The limitation in num
bers already forced upon us is a bid
for the best, a guarantee of the high
est possible service.
(■ranting of Diplomas a Privilege.
Today I look back over a long life
of teaching. 1 began it with the sole
ambition to become a naturalist, an
explorer, with an abounding passion
for geography as related to the life
of plants and animals and men. I had
never the slightest longing for execu
tive responsibility until circumstances
thrust this upon me. Rut T can see
that there is no experience in life, no
position of trust or honor, no field of
endeavor which 112 would have chosen
instead above what the fortunes of
life have assigned to me. Twenty
five years ago my colleague, President
Thwing of Western Reserve, wrote me
in congratulation, "T would rather be
President of Stanford University than
Emperor." So would I, and so would
1 again if I hart my life to live over.
Tt is the college president's func
tion not to govern, but to help; not
to rule, but to co-ordinate. His suc
cess rests on the devotion of the col
leagues with whom he surrounds
himself. With large risks and larger
trials, he has also unsurpassed op
portunities. He deals with a nation's
"youth of promise" and he meets
their parents on their best. side.
I am not unmindful of the generous
freedom accorded me by the Poard of
Trustees for the last three years with
the title of Chancellor. Put among
the experiences of my life, I count
this with the best, that nearly r>ooo
Stanford men and women have re
reived their diplomas from my hand.
To begin with, these young people
were choice spirits, else they would
never have gone to college, never
have come to Stanford University.
Here they have lived with Nature at
her best, and have "walked with
Henslows" of all types and degrees.
Finally, they have gone down "the
ppu.w atn o}m (I s.<ua\ api.w .inoj
ctich to do his nan in a brave and
reasonable way. I have met these
men and women in every state in the
Union, in London, in Germany, in
Australia, in Korea, in Japan. Some
little part, in the achievements of each
of them 1 claim for myself, a much
larger part 112 claim for my colleagues.
Leadership In Stanford Hands.
And this is our exceeding great
and unfailing reward, the only one we
ask, a grateful remembrance of our
work. Put not the least of our satis
faction in this hour lies in the cer
tainty that Stanford's leadership lies
in Stanford's hands. No stone of the
edifice we have builded during the

last twenty-five years need be rejected
in the foundation of the preater Stan
ford which is to come.
This day rounds out the first Quar
ter Century of Stanford University,
the best part of a lifetime for me and
for those of my colleagues who gath
ered around me in the early days.
This day I stand before you in some
sense as their spokesman and advo
cate. What account can we render of
our stewardship on the threshold of a
new cycle?
Speaking for myself, who have
been for forty-six years a teacher of
college men and women, I shall not
leave the fairest field of human effort
without profound emotion. But this
1 do not ask you to share. None of us
are here to stay, none of us would
halt, the procession. The old Rou
manian proverb, "Our blood goes over
into the veins of the young," we ac
cept without flinching. Young men
and young universities move faster
than old ones, and in this fact Stan
ford finds part of the secret of her
success.
Outlines Academic Ideal
Something of this success and the
elements which made it I shall try
to set before you today. I shall not
speak again of the founders' wisdom.
I have already on another occasion
recounted, largely in Mr. Stanford's
own words, his sane ideals of educa
tion and his generous plans for carry
ing them into effect. The story of the
six dark years, illuminated and saved
by the devoted loyalty of Mrs. Stan
ford, I have told at still another time
as well as I could. My present task
is to give you some account of the
principles embodied in the academic
life of the institution itself without
reference to particular individuals or
special events.
First of all, Stanford University had
for its basis a lofty moral and spir
itual purpose born of the fair hope
and the fi*ee hand which its founders
held out to us. Moreover, its roman
tic origin at once lifted it out of the
commonplace. Furthermore, as we
dreamed, it was not to duplicate old
successes or older failures, but was
to mark a new era, so we hoped, in
the training of men and women. In
a word, it was to bring the education
of tomorrow straight to the youth of
today.
Unhampered by Tradition
In those marvelous days of creative
opportunity, we were hampered by no
prearranged rule of action. No tra
dition from the old world or the new
laid on us its dead hand. As the
young president standing in the west
end of the Quadrangle proclaimed on
that eventful first day of October,
1891: "Our University has no history
to fall back upon. Xo memories of
great teachers haunt its corridors. In
none of its rooms appear the traces
which show where a great man has
lived and worked. No tender asso
ciations cling, ivy-like, to its fresh
new walls. It is hallowed by no tra
ditions. It is hampered by none. Its
finger posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow, as the
splendid lily from the modest bulb."
To be sure, we had then all the ex

perlence of the world to fall back
upon. But we were to draw our own
conclusions. Nothing forced us to use
it in any specified way. Any method
quantity was found in the ever-vary
ing traits of human nature. And on
the recognition of this infinite variety
our scheme was primarily based.
Every form of talent, we held, was
worthy of training. To develop
strength we must bring out person
ality. To this end we must first have
teachers adequate for their responsi
bilities. A university performs its
function not in what it compels, still
less in what it forbids, but in its pro
vision for intensifying the student's
best abilities.
Organization Second
Organization is a secondary thing.
It will come soon enough. Like age,
it creeps on us unawares. So the
fewer rules the better until rules make
themselves. Under the worst possible
organization, or none at all. great
teachers may do noble work, as the
history of learning clearly shows.
Wherever placed, the great man
leaves a mark on all with whom he
comes in contact. Professor Osborn
of Columbia once refered to the lie
lief that the American college, with
its happy-go-lucky lack of system,
could never produce a Darwin. In
opposition to this view, I claimed that
it could quite as readily as any other
system, given, of course, the raw ma
terial to work upon.
To my mind, in the making or a
great naturalist three things are
necessary: the original material, the
fine human stuff; next, contact with
nature; and finally, the help and ex
ample of a great teacher. These three
factors co-operated in the life of
Darwin. It is clear that Cambridge
and Edinburgh as schools of science,
did not make him. He himself bears
witness to the "incredible dullness"
of the lectures he heard. If that were
all, Stanford University could cer
tainly have done a better job.
Essentials of Greatness
But the first essential, the raw ma
terial, the choice mosaic of germ
plasm—this was already there to work
upon, and this no school could create.
The second element, contact with
nature—a free gift to all who seek it
—Darwin found on the moors of Cam
bridgeshire, by its brooks and its
bridges. In fullest measure, Califor
nia offers the same to all.
As to the third essential, the spell
of a great life, this Cambridge pro
vided. Darwin himself gives the clue.
He says that he "walked with liens
low," and Henslow was one of the
great botanists of bis time. To walk
with Henslow was in itself a gener
ous education. To make possible such
relations is the university's choicest
function. It should furnish the Hens
lows with whom the Darwins may
walk.
For the permanent values of a uni
versity center in its faculty. All the
virtues of mind and soul should be
theirs collectively, and as far as may
be, individually,—friendliness, self-de
votion, intellectual honesty, sincerity
I of purpose, love of work, strength to
; carry it on, accuracy, profundity,

broadmindedness, reverence, refine
ment, above all else, an unshaken and
unshakeable faith in human nature —
each one of these is vitally essential.
This may not all be detected in any
one man or woman, bat they must ap
pear in the composite whole.
Principles of Beginning
Nevertheless, whatever stress may
justly be laid on the personality of
teachers, one must not undervalue de
tails of organization. Traditions there
are that belittle, regulations that
starve or cramp, details that irritate,
and limitations that waste. A uni
versity should be framed for advance
ment. The chambers of its soul
should widen as the years go by.
Whatever bounds it imposes on itself
should be flexible and temporary.
Then as its life grows more complex,
it must frame certain rules of pro
cedure. The value of these rules will
rest on the principle that lies behind
them. Stanford was free to choose its
own educational principles. The four
most fundamental with which we
started were (a) the democracy of
mental powers, (b) the elective sys
tem, (c) the major department ar
rangement, and (d) the vital import
ance of individual initiative as the
prime element in character building.
With these, coeducation and the ap
plication of science were taken as mat
ters of course.
Aim of Quality Chosen
Negatively, we did not believe in
prescribed courses of study, in the
disciplinary value of undigested learn
ing, in promoting scholarship by pro
hibitions, by marks, honors, prizes, or
by financial subsidies as baits in
the educational trap. Furthermore, we
resolved that a university need not be
valued for its bigness, nor even for
the variety of its functions, believing
it better to do a few things well than
to strive weakly to cover the whole
ground of learning. For the ultimate
function of the endowed university
must be differentiated from that of the
state institution. It is the duty of
the latter to minister to all the higher
educational needs of the state. It is
the privilege of the former to set
standards of aim and standards of
achievement.
And further still, we conceived of
university life as an opportunity, to
be looked on as such by all who
came. Those who did not rise to its
stimulus were better somewhere else.
So because the chief source of human
wastage in our republic is the open
saloon, from the first we refused to
enter into rivalry with this, —or any
other institution that fattens on men's
weaknesses. The chains of a vile
habit inhibit wholesome development.
"Free should the scholar be, free and
brave."
Democracy of Mental Powers
Let us go bark to our four prin
ciples of organization, to consider
them in some detail. And here I must
ask the kind indulgence of all whose
fate it has been for a quarter of cen
tury to hear me expound in theory
and in practice the element of free
dom in education. That has been our
watchword. And because from the be

ginning we wished to emphasize the
value of intellectual freedom, of dis
cipline which is self-imposed, not
vouchsafed from above, we chose as
our academic motto the words of Ill
rich von Hutten, spoken four centur
ies ago, "Die Luft der Freheit weht,"
"The winds of freedom are blowing."
Democracy of the mind was the in
spiration of the early days of Cornell
University. Under its lead, we of the
pioneer clas-s of 1872 established our
first college journal. We called it
"The Cornell Era." For it truly
marked a new era in college history
when college men studied engineering
and agriculture along with Greek and
Latin, when even in a literary course
geology and botany might be counted
towards a degree. That such sub
jects could be accepted was the pri
mary reason why I myself went to
Cornell and not to Yale.
Democracy of the mind was not the
discovery of Andrew D. White, its
greatest apostle. No great idea orig
inates perhaps with any one person.
Hut at Cornell it was first developed
in workable fashion. It holds that
all mental powers should be recog
nized as free and equal, each alike
entitled to make the most of itself.
In this spirit, Ezra Cornell had said,
"I would found an institution in which
any person may find instruction in
any study." Indeed, it is not for the
university to foster any aristocracy of
studies. It shall not maintain Latin
or Greek or philosophy or physics, or
anything else, as a primary essential
in education, or that those whose
minds do not turn in some favored
direction shall be left uneducated. All
the powers of the mind, the applica
tion of knowledge as well as its ex
tension and preservation, are the sub
ject-matter of the university.
Elective System Adopted
Such a conception of higher educa
tion naturally finds its expression in
the elective system, which involves
the abandonment of the old idea in
volved in the word "curriculum" or
little race-course, with its low and
high hurdles, its "little go" and its
"great go," around which the student
moved for three or four years, return
ing at commencement for his final re
ward. The more tedious the discip
line, the greater was its supposed
value, and the reward for penance
done lay in the goodfellowship which
common boredom entailed. Under the
pressure of the widening of human
knowledge, the applications of sci
ence and the insistence of human
needs, the American college has
changed its theory in these regards.
The curriculum is no longer a race
course. Its participants do not run in
a circle, but set out in all directions
along widely divergent paths. For
the new appeal of widened helpful
ness has brought into the college new
and variant types of men, with variant
needs. Teachers brought up under the
old regime have generally ill under
stood how to deal with these. Mean
while the new appeal has brought new
popularities and it must be admitted
that many students are sent to the
universites because they have shown
no promise anywhere else.

Two Classes'of Students
College students in general may be
divided into two classes: those who
care and those who don't. Only the
first class need be considered. What
ever the needs of the others, their
place is not in the college. Students
who care may be again divided as to
the impulse, whether volitional or vo
cational, which compels their interest.
The best students in each field are
those who work for the love of it.
They may be classical scholars,
"Greek-minded men or Roman-minded
men," to use Emerson's phrase, or
they may be botanists, anatomists,
physiologists, chemists, teachers, phil
ologists, historians, engineers, econ
omists, physicians or jurists. They
may spring up in any field, and they
work to the limit for the mere joy of
working. The investigators of the
world, those who widen the scope of
knowledge in an appreciable degree,
belong to this class. Every door
should be held wide open for them,
and not one of them should be com
pelled to turn out of his way by the
lure of a.degree.
The vocational impulse has also its
place in the higher training. It may
express itself in perseverance rather
than in enthusiasm. A man will stick
to an uninteresting topic if he can
relate it to the affairs of life. An in
telligent student will always recognize
vocational reasons for pushing onward
to success. This is why the engineer
ing students in our universities are,
broadly speaking, better scholars than
students of literature. They see that
their future depends absolutely on
preparation. They are to deal with
the forces of nature, and nature
brooks no ignorance or deception..
They say at Harvard, "One is a fool
to study in the college; one is a fool
not to study in the law school." It
is a matter of common observation
that in professional schools of high
standards even the idler and the
dilettante may suddenly rise to hon
est work.
Joy in Vocational Training
It is, therefore, not a forward move
ment, for colleges and universities to
turn away from vocational studies in
the interest of pure culture. The vo
cation. however, must not be narrow
ly construed, as a man of force in any
field needs as wide a horizon as the
university can give him. No effort is
wasted if undertaken conscientiously
and with the purpose of adding found
ation on which one's specialty may
rest. Hut without volitional or voca
tional relations, without joy in the
work or hope in its final completion,
a boy would better keep out of col
lege and turn his attention as soon as
possible to something which to him is
real.
In the beginning Stanford Univer
sity adopted the elective system with
open eyes, certain that no other one
made possible the best scholarship.
The old classical course has not
broken down under the pressure of
live subjects and live issues. It rested
on the noble basis of Greek thought
and Greek expression. Its ideal look-
ed backward and upward to the loft
iest achievements of the human race
in the matter of beauty of form, of
language and of thought. As Thoreau
once observed, "Those only talk of
forgetting Greek who never knew it."
To the "Greek-minded man" these four
years in academic shades in company
with gracious thoughts were most sat
isfying and enlarging.
Hut the course was narrow and
special, and some thirty years ago it
began to give place to that condition
of affairs which I have elsewhere
called the "patchwork" stage of the
curriculum. The expansion of the
natural and physical sciences, each
one changing the whole current of
thought in its field; the demands of
French and German literature; a new
attitude towards the movements of
history; the growth of economics, jur
isprudence, modern philosophy, not
safe nor sane perhaps, but drawn
from the study of things as they are,
—all these, one by one or altogether,
clamored for a place in college
courses. Slowly, grudgingly, all were
admitted, crowding out, in greater or
less measure, Greek, calculus and
Latin. Each new subject, like the
camel with its head under the tent,
moved forward to occupy. Each sub
ject, old and new, was squeezed to
the briefest possible compass, though
the new ones were no more compre
hensible than the old. It was clear
before long that not all could be
brought into one uniform course. To
that end several arrangements were
devised, in each of which some edu
cational faction should have its way
But these ill adjusted and shifting
courses were necessarily less special
ized and therefore less thorough than
the old classical one, and as ad
vanced work in one subject has a
greater cultural value than elementary
work in several, so in almost every
regard the patchwork system marked
a step downward.
This period, however, was only one
of transition, and led directly to the
elective system, which made thorough
ness possible in any one of many
lines. In a prescribed course the stu
dent has little or no choice, and yet
the element of choice is in itself a
leading factor in individual training.
A democratic institution should min
ister to all types of men in quest of
higher education. It matters not
through what agency the miracle is
wrought. It may be achieved through
the melting of vanadium steel or by
a study of the satires of Horace.
The structure of the cell-nucleus of
a tadpole is as intricate and may be
as fascinating as that of the British
constitution, or a drama of Euripides.
Under the elective system it is pos
sible for a teacher to do his finest
work. No longer occupied with "the
dregs of learning," as Agassiz once
termed the college course at Harvard,
he can lead the learner and thus lead
himself to the firing lines of science.
With students in earnest, advanced
and thorough work becomes possible.
Such students give the teacher new
life.
Elective System Marks New Growth.
With the enlarged usefulness which
marked the advent of the elective sys
tem twenty to thirty years ago, began
the new growth of the colleges. They
drew men of new kinds, and many
more of them than ever before. This
fresh impulse was dominant in the
early days of Stanford, and a like
stimulus soon gave new life to the
whole university world. Ready-made
courses, the acme of pedagogic lazi
ness, were discarded. Like ready
made clothing, such courses really fit
nobody, and an education, like a suit
of clothes, should be fitted to the man
who is to wear it.
Some criticisms still apply to the
elective system. It has not yet wholly
eliminated "the reluctant student."
Hut can any system do this? No plan
ever made a lazy man brilliant. It is
to the earnest and efficient that the
opportunities of college life should be
granted. As a rule, students do not
elect the easiest studies and those
who do soon find their enjoyments
elsewhere.
Further, we are told that the elec

tive system offers temptations to un
due or premature specialization. This
also is true, and premature specializa
tion, like other forms of precocious
virtue, is to be deprecated. But ex
perience does not show that the
danger of "undue specialization" is a
serious one. The current, in college
and out, mostly sets the other way.
The fact that a man ventures to spec
ialize at all, shows that he has a cer
tain independence of character for the
odds are against it. Specialization im
plies thoroughness. It gives to each
man a base-line by which he can
measure the attainments of others.
No knowledge comes amiss to an in
vestigator; but no investigator can af
ford to sacrifice his specialty for the
sake of breadth. Thoroughness is the
main point, and should take preced
ence over versatility. 1 do not advo
cate narrowness of sympathy or nar
rowness of culture. The broadest ed
ucation is none too broad for the
growing scholar in any field. But the
forces of the mind should not be scat
tered in guerilla bands, but marshalled
toward leadership.
Major Department Arrangement.
Recognizing the conditions from the
very first, Stanford attempted to
strengthen and support the principle
of election in studies by means of the
major department arrangement. This
plan as we know it at Stanford and
as more or less developed in several
other universities, among them Har
vard, was forshadowed in these words
of Agassiz to his students in 1873:
"A specialty is the backbone of edu
cation. The mind is made strong by
the thorough possession of some
thing."
The final test of the elective system
must be found in its results. What
sort of man does it produce? What
is its relation to the discipline neces
sary to effectiveness in life? Dis
cipline means self-control, the power
to subordinate personal interest to the
larger needs of societies or nations,
the power to co-operate with other
men in the accomplishment of worthy
results. In this matter our people
tend to undervalue our actual achieve
ments, for too often uniformity is
mistaken for discipline. Unques
tioned obedience is not discipline.
Real discipline involves response
with head and heart to the dictates
of individual conscience, the "cate
gorical imperative" as set forth by
Immanuel Kant-. The uncritical sub
mission now shown by the masses
in Central Europe stands in exact
opposition to the dictum of the great
philosopher.
The output of our colleges has not
the uniformity for which Europe has
striven. Much that Europe values,
justly or not, we have neglected in
the interest of newer and sometimes
weightier demands. Substance is
more important than polish, and in
itiative outweighs all other forms of
efficiency. It is our highest aim in
America to grant not merely a lib
eral education, but, to borrow a word
from Dr. Peabody, a "liberating edu
cation," which shall fit a man to meet
unforseen demands.
Pledged To Personal Inithitive.
Democratic discipline and paternal
discipline lie at opposite poles in
national development. Each has its
defenders in our republic as else
where. But as a nation we stand
pledged to the discipline that evolves
from within and rests on personal
initiative. Its results are unequal,
but in the long run it is more effic
ient as an impulse in individual or
social life. We work under orders as
before, but not sealed orders. The
true American belongs to a political
party or a religious organization, not
to take direction from it, but to use
it for purposes which he shares with
the group. To him the party or or
ganization is a means towards indi
vidual or social ends, not an end in
itself. In our higher education as in
our political affairs, we have rejected
paternal dictation. From the dis
cipline self-imposed arises a form of
social discipline, unselfish devotion to
a common cause, characteristic of a
land of undivided freedom. The
highest patriotism, the patriotism of
humanity, cannot develop in a people

whose every man is a patient cog in
the wheels of a social, industrial or
military machine.
Appreciation of College >lenin War.
In a discussion of the affairs of
Belgium, Professor Vernon L. Kellogg
makes this reference to the work of
these students: "There are many
other bits that might be told. Only
one shall I add. It is a word of ap
preciation of the young Americans—
I am an old one—who offered their
services and performed their work in
a way to bring warmth to the heart
and mist to the eyes of a believer in
our country and its way of producing
men. Most of these helpers—a few
more than seventy Americans have
been so far in the service—are young
college men, a considerable fraction
of them.being Rhodes scholars from
the various Oxford colleges. Trained
in college for anything but the specific
work of the commission, they seem
to have found a training that, added
to a natural initiative, has made them
capable actors in the world's work.
Thrown into a situation requiring tact
and utmost discretion, loaded with
large responsibilities and asked to
take care of themselves and import
ant affairs of the commission under
most unusual circumstances, they
have done it, almost to a man, with
success. They have won the admira
tion of the Belgians and Germans
alike. They make one proud of
America and they lend great encour
agement to an observer of American
educational methods. Viewed in their
workings, these methods have seemed
to many of us very faulty; viewed in
their results, so far as young America
is a result of education at all, our too
easy pessimism is given a proper un
settling. I return to my university
chair with renewed confidence in
American educational work."
Man Trained for Man's Work.
The democratic type of educational
discipline aims to train a man to do
a man's work in life. It should help
him to strike at the heart of world
problems for himself, guided by no
precedent. Tt enables him to act in
telligently where others are contented
with blind feeling. In the future of
Europe the transfer of its activities
from the control of the few to the
welfare of the many, the American
scholar may prove a leading or even
a determining factor.
But after all consideration of uni
versity organization and of Stanford's
participation in it, we come back to
our first proposition, ihe imperative
ness of personality. A university is
a human group. In the long run it is
what its teachers make it. Through
the resultant of all the influences that
go out from tlieni its personality is
developed. The personality of Stan
ford for these twenty-five years has
been a very friendly one. In the first
year, teachers and students lived to
gether in Eneina Hall, and when our
world and everybody in it was young,
sometimes one could hardly tell pro
fessors and students apart. The
schools of old Japan, they say, prided
themselves on the fact that the teach
ers were merely the elder scholars,
"sen-sei," they called them, "those
born before." It is moreover record
ed of these teachers, "They knew each
of us by name."
Such a condition existed in the
early days of Stanford. We as teach
ers seemed, to ourselves at least, not
much older than our students. In the
pioneer classes, we knew everyone by
name. Happily we know them still.
And while increasing numbers and the
unifying tendencies which beset every
student body have made it no longer
possible for each of us to know all of
you by name, the old habit remains.
We are still students too—only a bit
farther along. So when we meet in
the world outside, it is as friends and
fellows devoted to each other, to our
university, our nation and our ideals.
Women Temper "Stanford Spirit."
One large factor in the temper of
constructive friendliness which we
call "the Stanford spirit" comes from
the welcome presence of the Stanford
women. I remember well the feverish
haste in which Mrs. Stanford com
pleted Roble Hall between the middle
of June and the last day of September

twenty-five years ago. She said that
the women must be in at the very be
ginning, otherwise they would always
be considered as interlopers. They
should be at home at Stanford, and
from the very first day.
Whatever the future of the univer
sity, we hope that the spirit of mu
tual trust and mutual friendliness, so
potent in the early days, will always
abide here. Changes in organization
and development must come. We
trust that changes in spirit will ap
pear only as intensification.
Today we are mounting the brow
of the hill from which we look for
ward to the future as well as back
over the past. In material ways it
has been a rocky road, with perils of
litigation, financial crises, emergen
cies of earthquake and fire, misunder
standings sometimes within and with
out. But all these are left behind
and the great future opens out. We
stand, indeed, before the very Gate of
Hercules.
Progress Result of Unrest.
They say that the American univer
sity is now in a period of unrest. It
always is. Out of unrest flows pro
gress. All our institutions are in
process of change. Nothing has yet
permanent form. Straight ahead of
us at Stanford may be seen the sep
aration of the junior college. This
means the expansion of the higher
work, a more thorough training of
men "for direct usefulness in life"
than is involved in the conventional
college education. The hour for the
change need not be hastened. It will
hasten itself. The limitation in num
bers already forced upon us is a bid
for the best, a guarantee of the high
est possible service.
(■ranting of Diplomas a Privilege.
Today I look back over a long life
of teaching. 1 began it with the sole
ambition to become a naturalist, an
explorer, with an abounding passion
for geography as related to the life
of plants and animals and men. I had
never the slightest longing for execu
tive responsibility until circumstances
thrust this upon me. Rut T can see
that there is no experience in life, no
position of trust or honor, no field of
endeavor which 112 would have chosen
instead above what the fortunes of
life have assigned to me. Twenty
five years ago my colleague, President
Thwing of Western Reserve, wrote me
in congratulation, "T would rather be
President of Stanford University than
Emperor." So would I, and so would
1 again if I hart my life to live over.
Tt is the college president's func
tion not to govern, but to help; not
to rule, but to co-ordinate. His suc
cess rests on the devotion of the col
leagues with whom he surrounds
himself. With large risks and larger
trials, he has also unsurpassed op
portunities. He deals with a nation's
"youth of promise" and he meets
their parents on their best. side.
I am not unmindful of the generous
freedom accorded me by the Poard of
Trustees for the last three years with
the title of Chancellor. Put among
the experiences of my life, I count
this with the best, that nearly r>ooo
Stanford men and women have re
reived their diplomas from my hand.
To begin with, these young people
were choice spirits, else they would
never have gone to college, never
have come to Stanford University.
Here they have lived with Nature at
her best, and have "walked with
Henslows" of all types and degrees.
Finally, they have gone down "the
ppu.w atn o}m (I s.<ua\ api.w .inoj
ctich to do his nan in a brave and
reasonable way. I have met these
men and women in every state in the
Union, in London, in Germany, in
Australia, in Korea, in Japan. Some
little part, in the achievements of each
of them 1 claim for myself, a much
larger part 112 claim for my colleagues.
Leadership In Stanford Hands.
And this is our exceeding great
and unfailing reward, the only one we
ask, a grateful remembrance of our
work. Put not the least of our satis
faction in this hour lies in the cer
tainty that Stanford's leadership lies
in Stanford's hands. No stone of the
edifice we have builded during the

last twenty-five years need be rejected
in the foundation of the preater Stan
ford which is to come.
This day rounds out the first Quar
ter Century of Stanford University,
the best part of a lifetime for me and
for those of my colleagues who gath
ered around me in the early days.
This day I stand before you in some
sense as their spokesman and advo
cate. What account can we render of
our stewardship on the threshold of a
new cycle?
Speaking for myself, who have
been for forty-six years a teacher of
college men and women, I shall not
leave the fairest field of human effort
without profound emotion. But this
1 do not ask you to share. None of us
are here to stay, none of us would
halt, the procession. The old Rou
manian proverb, "Our blood goes over
into the veins of the young," we ac
cept without flinching. Young men
and young universities move faster
than old ones, and in this fact Stan
ford finds part of the secret of her
success.
Outlines Academic Ideal
Something of this success and the
elements which made it I shall try
to set before you today. I shall not
speak again of the founders' wisdom.
I have already on another occasion
recounted, largely in Mr. Stanford's
own words, his sane ideals of educa
tion and his generous plans for carry
ing them into effect. The story of the
six dark years, illuminated and saved
by the devoted loyalty of Mrs. Stan
ford, I have told at still another time
as well as I could. My present task
is to give you some account of the
principles embodied in the academic
life of the institution itself without
reference to particular individuals or
special events.
First of all, Stanford University had
for its basis a lofty moral and spir
itual purpose born of the fair hope
and the fi*ee hand which its founders
held out to us. Moreover, its roman
tic origin at once lifted it out of the
commonplace. Furthermore, as we
dreamed, it was not to duplicate old
successes or older failures, but was
to mark a new era, so we hoped, in
the training of men and women. In
a word, it was to bring the education
of tomorrow straight to the youth of
today.
Unhampered by Tradition
In those marvelous days of creative
opportunity, we were hampered by no
prearranged rule of action. No tra
dition from the old world or the new
laid on us its dead hand. As the
young president standing in the west
end of the Quadrangle proclaimed on
that eventful first day of October,
1891: "Our University has no history
to fall back upon. Xo memories of
great teachers haunt its corridors. In
none of its rooms appear the traces
which show where a great man has
lived and worked. No tender asso
ciations cling, ivy-like, to its fresh
new walls. It is hallowed by no tra
ditions. It is hampered by none. Its
finger posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow, as the
splendid lily from the modest bulb."
To be sure, we had then all the ex

perlence of the world to fall back
upon. But we were to draw our own
conclusions. Nothing forced us to use
it in any specified way. Any method
quantity was found in the ever-vary
ing traits of human nature. And on
the recognition of this infinite variety
our scheme was primarily based.
Every form of talent, we held, was
worthy of training. To develop
strength we must bring out person
ality. To this end we must first have
teachers adequate for their responsi
bilities. A university performs its
function not in what it compels, still
less in what it forbids, but in its pro
vision for intensifying the student's
best abilities.
Organization Second
Organization is a secondary thing.
It will come soon enough. Like age,
it creeps on us unawares. So the
fewer rules the better until rules make
themselves. Under the worst possible
organization, or none at all. great
teachers may do noble work, as the
history of learning clearly shows.
Wherever placed, the great man
leaves a mark on all with whom he
comes in contact. Professor Osborn
of Columbia once refered to the lie
lief that the American college, with
its happy-go-lucky lack of system,
could never produce a Darwin. In
opposition to this view, I claimed that
it could quite as readily as any other
system, given, of course, the raw ma
terial to work upon.
To my mind, in the making or a
great naturalist three things are
necessary: the original material, the
fine human stuff; next, contact with
nature; and finally, the help and ex
ample of a great teacher. These three
factors co-operated in the life of
Darwin. It is clear that Cambridge
and Edinburgh as schools of science,
did not make him. He himself bears
witness to the "incredible dullness"
of the lectures he heard. If that were
all, Stanford University could cer
tainly have done a better job.
Essentials of Greatness
But the first essential, the raw ma
terial, the choice mosaic of germ
plasm—this was already there to work
upon, and this no school could create.
The second element, contact with
nature—a free gift to all who seek it
—Darwin found on the moors of Cam
bridgeshire, by its brooks and its
bridges. In fullest measure, Califor
nia offers the same to all.
As to the third essential, the spell
of a great life, this Cambridge pro
vided. Darwin himself gives the clue.
He says that he "walked with liens
low," and Henslow was one of the
great botanists of bis time. To walk
with Henslow was in itself a gener
ous education. To make possible such
relations is the university's choicest
function. It should furnish the Hens
lows with whom the Darwins may
walk.
For the permanent values of a uni
versity center in its faculty. All the
virtues of mind and soul should be
theirs collectively, and as far as may
be, individually,—friendliness, self-de
votion, intellectual honesty, sincerity
I of purpose, love of work, strength to
; carry it on, accuracy, profundity,

broadmindedness, reverence, refine
ment, above all else, an unshaken and
unshakeable faith in human nature —
each one of these is vitally essential.
This may not all be detected in any
one man or woman, bat they must ap
pear in the composite whole.
Principles of Beginning
Nevertheless, whatever stress may
justly be laid on the personality of
teachers, one must not undervalue de
tails of organization. Traditions there
are that belittle, regulations that
starve or cramp, details that irritate,
and limitations that waste. A uni
versity should be framed for advance
ment. The chambers of its soul
should widen as the years go by.
Whatever bounds it imposes on itself
should be flexible and temporary.
Then as its life grows more complex,
it must frame certain rules of pro
cedure. The value of these rules will
rest on the principle that lies behind
them. Stanford was free to choose its
own educational principles. The four
most fundamental with which we
started were (a) the democracy of
mental powers, (b) the elective sys
tem, (c) the major department ar
rangement, and (d) the vital import
ance of individual initiative as the
prime element in character building.
With these, coeducation and the ap
plication of science were taken as mat
ters of course.
Aim of Quality Chosen
Negatively, we did not believe in
prescribed courses of study, in the
disciplinary value of undigested learn
ing, in promoting scholarship by pro
hibitions, by marks, honors, prizes, or
by financial subsidies as baits in
the educational trap. Furthermore, we
resolved that a university need not be
valued for its bigness, nor even for
the variety of its functions, believing
it better to do a few things well than
to strive weakly to cover the whole
ground of learning. For the ultimate
function of the endowed university
must be differentiated from that of the
state institution. It is the duty of
the latter to minister to all the higher
educational needs of the state. It is
the privilege of the former to set
standards of aim and standards of
achievement.
And further still, we conceived of
university life as an opportunity, to
be looked on as such by all who
came. Those who did not rise to its
stimulus were better somewhere else.
So because the chief source of human
wastage in our republic is the open
saloon, from the first we refused to
enter into rivalry with this, —or any
other institution that fattens on men's
weaknesses. The chains of a vile
habit inhibit wholesome development.
"Free should the scholar be, free and
brave."
Democracy of Mental Powers
Let us go bark to our four prin
ciples of organization, to consider
them in some detail. And here I must
ask the kind indulgence of all whose
fate it has been for a quarter of cen
tury to hear me expound in theory
and in practice the element of free
dom in education. That has been our
watchword. And because from the be

ginning we wished to emphasize the
value of intellectual freedom, of dis
cipline which is self-imposed, not
vouchsafed from above, we chose as
our academic motto the words of Ill
rich von Hutten, spoken four centur
ies ago, "Die Luft der Freheit weht,"
"The winds of freedom are blowing."
Democracy of the mind was the in
spiration of the early days of Cornell
University. Under its lead, we of the
pioneer clas-s of 1872 established our
first college journal. We called it
"The Cornell Era." For it truly
marked a new era in college history
when college men studied engineering
and agriculture along with Greek and
Latin, when even in a literary course
geology and botany might be counted
towards a degree. That such sub
jects could be accepted was the pri
mary reason why I myself went to
Cornell and not to Yale.
Democracy of the mind was not the
discovery of Andrew D. White, its
greatest apostle. No great idea orig
inates perhaps with any one person.
Hut at Cornell it was first developed
in workable fashion. It holds that
all mental powers should be recog
nized as free and equal, each alike
entitled to make the most of itself.
In this spirit, Ezra Cornell had said,
"I would found an institution in which
any person may find instruction in
any study." Indeed, it is not for the
university to foster any aristocracy of
studies. It shall not maintain Latin
or Greek or philosophy or physics, or
anything else, as a primary essential
in education, or that those whose
minds do not turn in some favored
direction shall be left uneducated. All
the powers of the mind, the applica
tion of knowledge as well as its ex
tension and preservation, are the sub
ject-matter of the university.
Elective System Adopted
Such a conception of higher educa
tion naturally finds its expression in
the elective system, which involves
the abandonment of the old idea in
volved in the word "curriculum" or
little race-course, with its low and
high hurdles, its "little go" and its
"great go," around which the student
moved for three or four years, return
ing at commencement for his final re
ward. The more tedious the discip
line, the greater was its supposed
value, and the reward for penance
done lay in the goodfellowship which
common boredom entailed. Under the
pressure of the widening of human
knowledge, the applications of sci
ence and the insistence of human
needs, the American college has
changed its theory in these regards.
The curriculum is no longer a race
course. Its participants do not run in
a circle, but set out in all directions
along widely divergent paths. For
the new appeal of widened helpful
ness has brought into the college new
and variant types of men, with variant
needs. Teachers brought up under the
old regime have generally ill under
stood how to deal with these. Mean
while the new appeal has brought new
popularities and it must be admitted
that many students are sent to the
universites because they have shown
no promise anywhere else.

Two Classes'of Students
College students in general may be
divided into two classes: those who
care and those who don't. Only the
first class need be considered. What
ever the needs of the others, their
place is not in the college. Students
who care may be again divided as to
the impulse, whether volitional or vo
cational, which compels their interest.
The best students in each field are
those who work for the love of it.
They may be classical scholars,
"Greek-minded men or Roman-minded
men," to use Emerson's phrase, or
they may be botanists, anatomists,
physiologists, chemists, teachers, phil
ologists, historians, engineers, econ
omists, physicians or jurists. They
may spring up in any field, and they
work to the limit for the mere joy of
working. The investigators of the
world, those who widen the scope of
knowledge in an appreciable degree,
belong to this class. Every door
should be held wide open for them,
and not one of them should be com
pelled to turn out of his way by the
lure of a.degree.
The vocational impulse has also its
place in the higher training. It may
express itself in perseverance rather
than in enthusiasm. A man will stick
to an uninteresting topic if he can
relate it to the affairs of life. An in
telligent student will always recognize
vocational reasons for pushing onward
to success. This is why the engineer
ing students in our universities are,
broadly speaking, better scholars than
students of literature. They see that
their future depends absolutely on
preparation. They are to deal with
the forces of nature, and nature
brooks no ignorance or deception..
They say at Harvard, "One is a fool
to study in the college; one is a fool
not to study in the law school." It
is a matter of common observation
that in professional schools of high
standards even the idler and the
dilettante may suddenly rise to hon
est work.
Joy in Vocational Training
It is, therefore, not a forward move
ment, for colleges and universities to
turn away from vocational studies in
the interest of pure culture. The vo
cation. however, must not be narrow
ly construed, as a man of force in any
field needs as wide a horizon as the
university can give him. No effort is
wasted if undertaken conscientiously
and with the purpose of adding found
ation on which one's specialty may
rest. Hut without volitional or voca
tional relations, without joy in the
work or hope in its final completion,
a boy would better keep out of col
lege and turn his attention as soon as
possible to something which to him is
real.
In the beginning Stanford Univer
sity adopted the elective system with
open eyes, certain that no other one
made possible the best scholarship.
The old classical course has not
broken down under the pressure of
live subjects and live issues. It rested
on the noble basis of Greek thought
and Greek expression. Its ideal look-
ed backward and upward to the loft
iest achievements of the human race
in the matter of beauty of form, of
language and of thought. As Thoreau
once observed, "Those only talk of
forgetting Greek who never knew it."
To the "Greek-minded man" these four
years in academic shades in company
with gracious thoughts were most sat
isfying and enlarging.
Hut the course was narrow and
special, and some thirty years ago it
began to give place to that condition
of affairs which I have elsewhere
called the "patchwork" stage of the
curriculum. The expansion of the
natural and physical sciences, each
one changing the whole current of
thought in its field; the demands of
French and German literature; a new
attitude towards the movements of
history; the growth of economics, jur
isprudence, modern philosophy, not
safe nor sane perhaps, but drawn
from the study of things as they are,
—all these, one by one or altogether,
clamored for a place in college
courses. Slowly, grudgingly, all were
admitted, crowding out, in greater or
less measure, Greek, calculus and
Latin. Each new subject, like the
camel with its head under the tent,
moved forward to occupy. Each sub
ject, old and new, was squeezed to
the briefest possible compass, though
the new ones were no more compre
hensible than the old. It was clear
before long that not all could be
brought into one uniform course. To
that end several arrangements were
devised, in each of which some edu
cational faction should have its way
But these ill adjusted and shifting
courses were necessarily less special
ized and therefore less thorough than
the old classical one, and as ad
vanced work in one subject has a
greater cultural value than elementary
work in several, so in almost every
regard the patchwork system marked
a step downward.
This period, however, was only one
of transition, and led directly to the
elective system, which made thorough
ness possible in any one of many
lines. In a prescribed course the stu
dent has little or no choice, and yet
the element of choice is in itself a
leading factor in individual training.
A democratic institution should min
ister to all types of men in quest of
higher education. It matters not
through what agency the miracle is
wrought. It may be achieved through
the melting of vanadium steel or by
a study of the satires of Horace.
The structure of the cell-nucleus of
a tadpole is as intricate and may be
as fascinating as that of the British
constitution, or a drama of Euripides.
Under the elective system it is pos
sible for a teacher to do his finest
work. No longer occupied with "the
dregs of learning," as Agassiz once
termed the college course at Harvard,
he can lead the learner and thus lead
himself to the firing lines of science.
With students in earnest, advanced
and thorough work becomes possible.
Such students give the teacher new
life.
Elective System Marks New Growth.
With the enlarged usefulness which
marked the advent of the elective sys
tem twenty to thirty years ago, began
the new growth of the colleges. They
drew men of new kinds, and many
more of them than ever before. This
fresh impulse was dominant in the
early days of Stanford, and a like
stimulus soon gave new life to the
whole university world. Ready-made
courses, the acme of pedagogic lazi
ness, were discarded. Like ready
made clothing, such courses really fit
nobody, and an education, like a suit
of clothes, should be fitted to the man
who is to wear it.
Some criticisms still apply to the
elective system. It has not yet wholly
eliminated "the reluctant student."
Hut can any system do this? No plan
ever made a lazy man brilliant. It is
to the earnest and efficient that the
opportunities of college life should be
granted. As a rule, students do not
elect the easiest studies and those
who do soon find their enjoyments
elsewhere.
Further, we are told that the elec

tive system offers temptations to un
due or premature specialization. This
also is true, and premature specializa
tion, like other forms of precocious
virtue, is to be deprecated. But ex
perience does not show that the
danger of "undue specialization" is a
serious one. The current, in college
and out, mostly sets the other way.
The fact that a man ventures to spec
ialize at all, shows that he has a cer
tain independence of character for the
odds are against it. Specialization im
plies thoroughness. It gives to each
man a base-line by which he can
measure the attainments of others.
No knowledge comes amiss to an in
vestigator; but no investigator can af
ford to sacrifice his specialty for the
sake of breadth. Thoroughness is the
main point, and should take preced
ence over versatility. 1 do not advo
cate narrowness of sympathy or nar
rowness of culture. The broadest ed
ucation is none too broad for the
growing scholar in any field. But the
forces of the mind should not be scat
tered in guerilla bands, but marshalled
toward leadership.
Major Department Arrangement.
Recognizing the conditions from the
very first, Stanford attempted to
strengthen and support the principle
of election in studies by means of the
major department arrangement. This
plan as we know it at Stanford and
as more or less developed in several
other universities, among them Har
vard, was forshadowed in these words
of Agassiz to his students in 1873:
"A specialty is the backbone of edu
cation. The mind is made strong by
the thorough possession of some
thing."
The final test of the elective system
must be found in its results. What
sort of man does it produce? What
is its relation to the discipline neces
sary to effectiveness in life? Dis
cipline means self-control, the power
to subordinate personal interest to the
larger needs of societies or nations,
the power to co-operate with other
men in the accomplishment of worthy
results. In this matter our people
tend to undervalue our actual achieve
ments, for too often uniformity is
mistaken for discipline. Unques
tioned obedience is not discipline.
Real discipline involves response
with head and heart to the dictates
of individual conscience, the "cate
gorical imperative" as set forth by
Immanuel Kant-. The uncritical sub
mission now shown by the masses
in Central Europe stands in exact
opposition to the dictum of the great
philosopher.
The output of our colleges has not
the uniformity for which Europe has
striven. Much that Europe values,
justly or not, we have neglected in
the interest of newer and sometimes
weightier demands. Substance is
more important than polish, and in
itiative outweighs all other forms of
efficiency. It is our highest aim in
America to grant not merely a lib
eral education, but, to borrow a word
from Dr. Peabody, a "liberating edu
cation," which shall fit a man to meet
unforseen demands.
Pledged To Personal Inithitive.
Democratic discipline and paternal
discipline lie at opposite poles in
national development. Each has its
defenders in our republic as else
where. But as a nation we stand
pledged to the discipline that evolves
from within and rests on personal
initiative. Its results are unequal,
but in the long run it is more effic
ient as an impulse in individual or
social life. We work under orders as
before, but not sealed orders. The
true American belongs to a political
party or a religious organization, not
to take direction from it, but to use
it for purposes which he shares with
the group. To him the party or or
ganization is a means towards indi
vidual or social ends, not an end in
itself. In our higher education as in
our political affairs, we have rejected
paternal dictation. From the dis
cipline self-imposed arises a form of
social discipline, unselfish devotion to
a common cause, characteristic of a
land of undivided freedom. The
highest patriotism, the patriotism of
humanity, cannot develop in a people

whose every man is a patient cog in
the wheels of a social, industrial or
military machine.
Appreciation of College >lenin War.
In a discussion of the affairs of
Belgium, Professor Vernon L. Kellogg
makes this reference to the work of
these students: "There are many
other bits that might be told. Only
one shall I add. It is a word of ap
preciation of the young Americans—
I am an old one—who offered their
services and performed their work in
a way to bring warmth to the heart
and mist to the eyes of a believer in
our country and its way of producing
men. Most of these helpers—a few
more than seventy Americans have
been so far in the service—are young
college men, a considerable fraction
of them.being Rhodes scholars from
the various Oxford colleges. Trained
in college for anything but the specific
work of the commission, they seem
to have found a training that, added
to a natural initiative, has made them
capable actors in the world's work.
Thrown into a situation requiring tact
and utmost discretion, loaded with
large responsibilities and asked to
take care of themselves and import
ant affairs of the commission under
most unusual circumstances, they
have done it, almost to a man, with
success. They have won the admira
tion of the Belgians and Germans
alike. They make one proud of
America and they lend great encour
agement to an observer of American
educational methods. Viewed in their
workings, these methods have seemed
to many of us very faulty; viewed in
their results, so far as young America
is a result of education at all, our too
easy pessimism is given a proper un
settling. I return to my university
chair with renewed confidence in
American educational work."
Man Trained for Man's Work.
The democratic type of educational
discipline aims to train a man to do
a man's work in life. It should help
him to strike at the heart of world
problems for himself, guided by no
precedent. Tt enables him to act in
telligently where others are contented
with blind feeling. In the future of
Europe the transfer of its activities
from the control of the few to the
welfare of the many, the American
scholar may prove a leading or even
a determining factor.
But after all consideration of uni
versity organization and of Stanford's
participation in it, we come back to
our first proposition, ihe imperative
ness of personality. A university is
a human group. In the long run it is
what its teachers make it. Through
the resultant of all the influences that
go out from tlieni its personality is
developed. The personality of Stan
ford for these twenty-five years has
been a very friendly one. In the first
year, teachers and students lived to
gether in Eneina Hall, and when our
world and everybody in it was young,
sometimes one could hardly tell pro
fessors and students apart. The
schools of old Japan, they say, prided
themselves on the fact that the teach
ers were merely the elder scholars,
"sen-sei," they called them, "those
born before." It is moreover record
ed of these teachers, "They knew each
of us by name."
Such a condition existed in the
early days of Stanford. We as teach
ers seemed, to ourselves at least, not
much older than our students. In the
pioneer classes, we knew everyone by
name. Happily we know them still.
And while increasing numbers and the
unifying tendencies which beset every
student body have made it no longer
possible for each of us to know all of
you by name, the old habit remains.
We are still students too—only a bit
farther along. So when we meet in
the world outside, it is as friends and
fellows devoted to each other, to our
university, our nation and our ideals.
Women Temper "Stanford Spirit."
One large factor in the temper of
constructive friendliness which we
call "the Stanford spirit" comes from
the welcome presence of the Stanford
women. I remember well the feverish
haste in which Mrs. Stanford com
pleted Roble Hall between the middle
of June and the last day of September

twenty-five years ago. She said that
the women must be in at the very be
ginning, otherwise they would always
be considered as interlopers. They
should be at home at Stanford, and
from the very first day.
Whatever the future of the univer
sity, we hope that the spirit of mu
tual trust and mutual friendliness, so
potent in the early days, will always
abide here. Changes in organization
and development must come. We
trust that changes in spirit will ap
pear only as intensification.
Today we are mounting the brow
of the hill from which we look for
ward to the future as well as back
over the past. In material ways it
has been a rocky road, with perils of
litigation, financial crises, emergen
cies of earthquake and fire, misunder
standings sometimes within and with
out. But all these are left behind
and the great future opens out. We
stand, indeed, before the very Gate of
Hercules.
Progress Result of Unrest.
They say that the American univer
sity is now in a period of unrest. It
always is. Out of unrest flows pro
gress. All our institutions are in
process of change. Nothing has yet
permanent form. Straight ahead of
us at Stanford may be seen the sep
aration of the junior college. This
means the expansion of the higher
work, a more thorough training of
men "for direct usefulness in life"
than is involved in the conventional
college education. The hour for the
change need not be hastened. It will
hasten itself. The limitation in num
bers already forced upon us is a bid
for the best, a guarantee of the high
est possible service.
(■ranting of Diplomas a Privilege.
Today I look back over a long life
of teaching. 1 began it with the sole
ambition to become a naturalist, an
explorer, with an abounding passion
for geography as related to the life
of plants and animals and men. I had
never the slightest longing for execu
tive responsibility until circumstances
thrust this upon me. Rut T can see
that there is no experience in life, no
position of trust or honor, no field of
endeavor which 112 would have chosen
instead above what the fortunes of
life have assigned to me. Twenty
five years ago my colleague, President
Thwing of Western Reserve, wrote me
in congratulation, "T would rather be
President of Stanford University than
Emperor." So would I, and so would
1 again if I hart my life to live over.
Tt is the college president's func
tion not to govern, but to help; not
to rule, but to co-ordinate. His suc
cess rests on the devotion of the col
leagues with whom he surrounds
himself. With large risks and larger
trials, he has also unsurpassed op
portunities. He deals with a nation's
"youth of promise" and he meets
their parents on their best. side.
I am not unmindful of the generous
freedom accorded me by the Poard of
Trustees for the last three years with
the title of Chancellor. Put among
the experiences of my life, I count
this with the best, that nearly r>ooo
Stanford men and women have re
reived their diplomas from my hand.
To begin with, these young people
were choice spirits, else they would
never have gone to college, never
have come to Stanford University.
Here they have lived with Nature at
her best, and have "walked with
Henslows" of all types and degrees.
Finally, they have gone down "the
ppu.w atn o}m (I s.<ua\ api.w .inoj
ctich to do his nan in a brave and
reasonable way. I have met these
men and women in every state in the
Union, in London, in Germany, in
Australia, in Korea, in Japan. Some
little part, in the achievements of each
of them 1 claim for myself, a much
larger part 112 claim for my colleagues.
Leadership In Stanford Hands.
And this is our exceeding great
and unfailing reward, the only one we
ask, a grateful remembrance of our
work. Put not the least of our satis
faction in this hour lies in the cer
tainty that Stanford's leadership lies
in Stanford's hands. No stone of the
edifice we have builded during the

last twenty-five years need be rejected
in the foundation of the preater Stan
ford which is to come.
This day rounds out the first Quar
ter Century of Stanford University,
the best part of a lifetime for me and
for those of my colleagues who gath
ered around me in the early days.
This day I stand before you in some
sense as their spokesman and advo
cate. What account can we render of
our stewardship on the threshold of a
new cycle?
Speaking for myself, who have
been for forty-six years a teacher of
college men and women, I shall not
leave the fairest field of human effort
without profound emotion. But this
1 do not ask you to share. None of us
are here to stay, none of us would
halt, the procession. The old Rou
manian proverb, "Our blood goes over
into the veins of the young," we ac
cept without flinching. Young men
and young universities move faster
than old ones, and in this fact Stan
ford finds part of the secret of her
success.
Outlines Academic Ideal
Something of this success and the
elements which made it I shall try
to set before you today. I shall not
speak again of the founders' wisdom.
I have already on another occasion
recounted, largely in Mr. Stanford's
own words, his sane ideals of educa
tion and his generous plans for carry
ing them into effect. The story of the
six dark years, illuminated and saved
by the devoted loyalty of Mrs. Stan
ford, I have told at still another time
as well as I could. My present task
is to give you some account of the
principles embodied in the academic
life of the institution itself without
reference to particular individuals or
special events.
First of all, Stanford University had
for its basis a lofty moral and spir
itual purpose born of the fair hope
and the fi*ee hand which its founders
held out to us. Moreover, its roman
tic origin at once lifted it out of the
commonplace. Furthermore, as we
dreamed, it was not to duplicate old
successes or older failures, but was
to mark a new era, so we hoped, in
the training of men and women. In
a word, it was to bring the education
of tomorrow straight to the youth of
today.
Unhampered by Tradition
In those marvelous days of creative
opportunity, we were hampered by no
prearranged rule of action. No tra
dition from the old world or the new
laid on us its dead hand. As the
young president standing in the west
end of the Quadrangle proclaimed on
that eventful first day of October,
1891: "Our University has no history
to fall back upon. Xo memories of
great teachers haunt its corridors. In
none of its rooms appear the traces
which show where a great man has
lived and worked. No tender asso
ciations cling, ivy-like, to its fresh
new walls. It is hallowed by no tra
ditions. It is hampered by none. Its
finger posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow, as the
splendid lily from the modest bulb."
To be sure, we had then all the ex

perlence of the world to fall back
upon. But we were to draw our own
conclusions. Nothing forced us to use
it in any specified way. Any method
quantity was found in the ever-vary
ing traits of human nature. And on
the recognition of this infinite variety
our scheme was primarily based.
Every form of talent, we held, was
worthy of training. To develop
strength we must bring out person
ality. To this end we must first have
teachers adequate for their responsi
bilities. A university performs its
function not in what it compels, still
less in what it forbids, but in its pro
vision for intensifying the student's
best abilities.
Organization Second
Organization is a secondary thing.
It will come soon enough. Like age,
it creeps on us unawares. So the
fewer rules the better until rules make
themselves. Under the worst possible
organization, or none at all. great
teachers may do noble work, as the
history of learning clearly shows.
Wherever placed, the great man
leaves a mark on all with whom he
comes in contact. Professor Osborn
of Columbia once refered to the lie
lief that the American college, with
its happy-go-lucky lack of system,
could never produce a Darwin. In
opposition to this view, I claimed that
it could quite as readily as any other
system, given, of course, the raw ma
terial to work upon.
To my mind, in the making or a
great naturalist three things are
necessary: the original material, the
fine human stuff; next, contact with
nature; and finally, the help and ex
ample of a great teacher. These three
factors co-operated in the life of
Darwin. It is clear that Cambridge
and Edinburgh as schools of science,
did not make him. He himself bears
witness to the "incredible dullness"
of the lectures he heard. If that were
all, Stanford University could cer
tainly have done a better job.
Essentials of Greatness
But the first essential, the raw ma
terial, the choice mosaic of germ
plasm—this was already there to work
upon, and this no school could create.
The second element, contact with
nature—a free gift to all who seek it
—Darwin found on the moors of Cam
bridgeshire, by its brooks and its
bridges. In fullest measure, Califor
nia offers the same to all.
As to the third essential, the spell
of a great life, this Cambridge pro
vided. Darwin himself gives the clue.
He says that he "walked with liens
low," and Henslow was one of the
great botanists of bis time. To walk
with Henslow was in itself a gener
ous education. To make possible such
relations is the university's choicest
function. It should furnish the Hens
lows with whom the Darwins may
walk.
For the permanent values of a uni
versity center in its faculty. All the
virtues of mind and soul should be
theirs collectively, and as far as may
be, individually,—friendliness, self-de
votion, intellectual honesty, sincerity
I of purpose, love of work, strength to
; carry it on, accuracy, profundity,

broadmindedness, reverence, refine
ment, above all else, an unshaken and
unshakeable faith in human nature —
each one of these is vitally essential.
This may not all be detected in any
one man or woman, bat they must ap
pear in the composite whole.
Principles of Beginning
Nevertheless, whatever stress may
justly be laid on the personality of
teachers, one must not undervalue de
tails of organization. Traditions there
are that belittle, regulations that
starve or cramp, details that irritate,
and limitations that waste. A uni
versity should be framed for advance
ment. The chambers of its soul
should widen as the years go by.
Whatever bounds it imposes on itself
should be flexible and temporary.
Then as its life grows more complex,
it must frame certain rules of pro
cedure. The value of these rules will
rest on the principle that lies behind
them. Stanford was free to choose its
own educational principles. The four
most fundamental with which we
started were (a) the democracy of
mental powers, (b) the elective sys
tem, (c) the major department ar
rangement, and (d) the vital import
ance of individual initiative as the
prime element in character building.
With these, coeducation and the ap
plication of science were taken as mat
ters of course.
Aim of Quality Chosen
Negatively, we did not believe in
prescribed courses of study, in the
disciplinary value of undigested learn
ing, in promoting scholarship by pro
hibitions, by marks, honors, prizes, or
by financial subsidies as baits in
the educational trap. Furthermore, we
resolved that a university need not be
valued for its bigness, nor even for
the variety of its functions, believing
it better to do a few things well than
to strive weakly to cover the whole
ground of learning. For the ultimate
function of the endowed university
must be differentiated from that of the
state institution. It is the duty of
the latter to minister to all the higher
educational needs of the state. It is
the privilege of the former to set
standards of aim and standards of
achievement.
And further still, we conceived of
university life as an opportunity, to
be looked on as such by all who
came. Those who did not rise to its
stimulus were better somewhere else.
So because the chief source of human
wastage in our republic is the open
saloon, from the first we refused to
enter into rivalry with this, —or any
other institution that fattens on men's
weaknesses. The chains of a vile
habit inhibit wholesome development.
"Free should the scholar be, free and
brave."
Democracy of Mental Powers
Let us go bark to our four prin
ciples of organization, to consider
them in some detail. And here I must
ask the kind indulgence of all whose
fate it has been for a quarter of cen
tury to hear me expound in theory
and in practice the element of free
dom in education. That has been our
watchword. And because from the be

ginning we wished to emphasize the
value of intellectual freedom, of dis
cipline which is self-imposed, not
vouchsafed from above, we chose as
our academic motto the words of Ill
rich von Hutten, spoken four centur
ies ago, "Die Luft der Freheit weht,"
"The winds of freedom are blowing."
Democracy of the mind was the in
spiration of the early days of Cornell
University. Under its lead, we of the
pioneer clas-s of 1872 established our
first college journal. We called it
"The Cornell Era." For it truly
marked a new era in college history
when college men studied engineering
and agriculture along with Greek and
Latin, when even in a literary course
geology and botany might be counted
towards a degree. That such sub
jects could be accepted was the pri
mary reason why I myself went to
Cornell and not to Yale.
Democracy of the mind was not the
discovery of Andrew D. White, its
greatest apostle. No great idea orig
inates perhaps with any one person.
Hut at Cornell it was first developed
in workable fashion. It holds that
all mental powers should be recog
nized as free and equal, each alike
entitled to make the most of itself.
In this spirit, Ezra Cornell had said,
"I would found an institution in which
any person may find instruction in
any study." Indeed, it is not for the
university to foster any aristocracy of
studies. It shall not maintain Latin
or Greek or philosophy or physics, or
anything else, as a primary essential
in education, or that those whose
minds do not turn in some favored
direction shall be left uneducated. All
the powers of the mind, the applica
tion of knowledge as well as its ex
tension and preservation, are the sub
ject-matter of the university.
Elective System Adopted
Such a conception of higher educa
tion naturally finds its expression in
the elective system, which involves
the abandonment of the old idea in
volved in the word "curriculum" or
little race-course, with its low and
high hurdles, its "little go" and its
"great go," around which the student
moved for three or four years, return
ing at commencement for his final re
ward. The more tedious the discip
line, the greater was its supposed
value, and the reward for penance
done lay in the goodfellowship which
common boredom entailed. Under the
pressure of the widening of human
knowledge, the applications of sci
ence and the insistence of human
needs, the American college has
changed its theory in these regards.
The curriculum is no longer a race
course. Its participants do not run in
a circle, but set out in all directions
along widely divergent paths. For
the new appeal of widened helpful
ness has brought into the college new
and variant types of men, with variant
needs. Teachers brought up under the
old regime have generally ill under
stood how to deal with these. Mean
while the new appeal has brought new
popularities and it must be admitted
that many students are sent to the
universites because they have shown
no promise anywhere else.

Two Classes'of Students
College students in general may be
divided into two classes: those who
care and those who don't. Only the
first class need be considered. What
ever the needs of the others, their
place is not in the college. Students
who care may be again divided as to
the impulse, whether volitional or vo
cational, which compels their interest.
The best students in each field are
those who work for the love of it.
They may be classical scholars,
"Greek-minded men or Roman-minded
men," to use Emerson's phrase, or
they may be botanists, anatomists,
physiologists, chemists, teachers, phil
ologists, historians, engineers, econ
omists, physicians or jurists. They
may spring up in any field, and they
work to the limit for the mere joy of
working. The investigators of the
world, those who widen the scope of
knowledge in an appreciable degree,
belong to this class. Every door
should be held wide open for them,
and not one of them should be com
pelled to turn out of his way by the
lure of a.degree.
The vocational impulse has also its
place in the higher training. It may
express itself in perseverance rather
than in enthusiasm. A man will stick
to an uninteresting topic if he can
relate it to the affairs of life. An in
telligent student will always recognize
vocational reasons for pushing onward
to success. This is why the engineer
ing students in our universities are,
broadly speaking, better scholars than
students of literature. They see that
their future depends absolutely on
preparation. They are to deal with
the forces of nature, and nature
brooks no ignorance or deception..
They say at Harvard, "One is a fool
to study in the college; one is a fool
not to study in the law school." It
is a matter of common observation
that in professional schools of high
standards even the idler and the
dilettante may suddenly rise to hon
est work.
Joy in Vocational Training
It is, therefore, not a forward move
ment, for colleges and universities to
turn away from vocational studies in
the interest of pure culture. The vo
cation. however, must not be narrow
ly construed, as a man of force in any
field needs as wide a horizon as the
university can give him. No effort is
wasted if undertaken conscientiously
and with the purpose of adding found
ation on which one's specialty may
rest. Hut without volitional or voca
tional relations, without joy in the
work or hope in its final completion,
a boy would better keep out of col
lege and turn his attention as soon as
possible to something which to him is
real.
In the beginning Stanford Univer
sity adopted the elective system with
open eyes, certain that no other one
made possible the best scholarship.
The old classical course has not
broken down under the pressure of
live subjects and live issues. It rested
on the noble basis of Greek thought
and Greek expression. Its ideal look-
ed backward and upward to the loft
iest achievements of the human race
in the matter of beauty of form, of
language and of thought. As Thoreau
once observed, "Those only talk of
forgetting Greek who never knew it."
To the "Greek-minded man" these four
years in academic shades in company
with gracious thoughts were most sat
isfying and enlarging.
Hut the course was narrow and
special, and some thirty years ago it
began to give place to that condition
of affairs which I have elsewhere
called the "patchwork" stage of the
curriculum. The expansion of the
natural and physical sciences, each
one changing the whole current of
thought in its field; the demands of
French and German literature; a new
attitude towards the movements of
history; the growth of economics, jur
isprudence, modern philosophy, not
safe nor sane perhaps, but drawn
from the study of things as they are,
—all these, one by one or altogether,
clamored for a place in college
courses. Slowly, grudgingly, all were
admitted, crowding out, in greater or
less measure, Greek, calculus and
Latin. Each new subject, like the
camel with its head under the tent,
moved forward to occupy. Each sub
ject, old and new, was squeezed to
the briefest possible compass, though
the new ones were no more compre
hensible than the old. It was clear
before long that not all could be
brought into one uniform course. To
that end several arrangements were
devised, in each of which some edu
cational faction should have its way
But these ill adjusted and shifting
courses were necessarily less special
ized and therefore less thorough than
the old classical one, and as ad
vanced work in one subject has a
greater cultural value than elementary
work in several, so in almost every
regard the patchwork system marked
a step downward.
This period, however, was only one
of transition, and led directly to the
elective system, which made thorough
ness possible in any one of many
lines. In a prescribed course the stu
dent has little or no choice, and yet
the element of choice is in itself a
leading factor in individual training.
A democratic institution should min
ister to all types of men in quest of
higher education. It matters not
through what agency the miracle is
wrought. It may be achieved through
the melting of vanadium steel or by
a study of the satires of Horace.
The structure of the cell-nucleus of
a tadpole is as intricate and may be
as fascinating as that of the British
constitution, or a drama of Euripides.
Under the elective system it is pos
sible for a teacher to do his finest
work. No longer occupied with "the
dregs of learning," as Agassiz once
termed the college course at Harvard,
he can lead the learner and thus lead
himself to the firing lines of science.
With students in earnest, advanced
and thorough work becomes possible.
Such students give the teacher new
life.
Elective System Marks New Growth.
With the enlarged usefulness which
marked the advent of the elective sys
tem twenty to thirty years ago, began
the new growth of the colleges. They
drew men of new kinds, and many
more of them than ever before. This
fresh impulse was dominant in the
early days of Stanford, and a like
stimulus soon gave new life to the
whole university world. Ready-made
courses, the acme of pedagogic lazi
ness, were discarded. Like ready
made clothing, such courses really fit
nobody, and an education, like a suit
of clothes, should be fitted to the man
who is to wear it.
Some criticisms still apply to the
elective system. It has not yet wholly
eliminated "the reluctant student."
Hut can any system do this? No plan
ever made a lazy man brilliant. It is
to the earnest and efficient that the
opportunities of college life should be
granted. As a rule, students do not
elect the easiest studies and those
who do soon find their enjoyments
elsewhere.
Further, we are told that the elec

tive system offers temptations to un
due or premature specialization. This
also is true, and premature specializa
tion, like other forms of precocious
virtue, is to be deprecated. But ex
perience does not show that the
danger of "undue specialization" is a
serious one. The current, in college
and out, mostly sets the other way.
The fact that a man ventures to spec
ialize at all, shows that he has a cer
tain independence of character for the
odds are against it. Specialization im
plies thoroughness. It gives to each
man a base-line by which he can
measure the attainments of others.
No knowledge comes amiss to an in
vestigator; but no investigator can af
ford to sacrifice his specialty for the
sake of breadth. Thoroughness is the
main point, and should take preced
ence over versatility. 1 do not advo
cate narrowness of sympathy or nar
rowness of culture. The broadest ed
ucation is none too broad for the
growing scholar in any field. But the
forces of the mind should not be scat
tered in guerilla bands, but marshalled
toward leadership.
Major Department Arrangement.
Recognizing the conditions from the
very first, Stanford attempted to
strengthen and support the principle
of election in studies by means of the
major department arrangement. This
plan as we know it at Stanford and
as more or less developed in several
other universities, among them Har
vard, was forshadowed in these words
of Agassiz to his students in 1873:
"A specialty is the backbone of edu
cation. The mind is made strong by
the thorough possession of some
thing."
The final test of the elective system
must be found in its results. What
sort of man does it produce? What
is its relation to the discipline neces
sary to effectiveness in life? Dis
cipline means self-control, the power
to subordinate personal interest to the
larger needs of societies or nations,
the power to co-operate with other
men in the accomplishment of worthy
results. In this matter our people
tend to undervalue our actual achieve
ments, for too often uniformity is
mistaken for discipline. Unques
tioned obedience is not discipline.
Real discipline involves response
with head and heart to the dictates
of individual conscience, the "cate
gorical imperative" as set forth by
Immanuel Kant-. The uncritical sub
mission now shown by the masses
in Central Europe stands in exact
opposition to the dictum of the great
philosopher.
The output of our colleges has not
the uniformity for which Europe has
striven. Much that Europe values,
justly or not, we have neglected in
the interest of newer and sometimes
weightier demands. Substance is
more important than polish, and in
itiative outweighs all other forms of
efficiency. It is our highest aim in
America to grant not merely a lib
eral education, but, to borrow a word
from Dr. Peabody, a "liberating edu
cation," which shall fit a man to meet
unforseen demands.
Pledged To Personal Inithitive.
Democratic discipline and paternal
discipline lie at opposite poles in
national development. Each has its
defenders in our republic as else
where. But as a nation we stand
pledged to the discipline that evolves
from within and rests on personal
initiative. Its results are unequal,
but in the long run it is more effic
ient as an impulse in individual or
social life. We work under orders as
before, but not sealed orders. The
true American belongs to a political
party or a religious organization, not
to take direction from it, but to use
it for purposes which he shares with
the group. To him the party or or
ganization is a means towards indi
vidual or social ends, not an end in
itself. In our higher education as in
our political affairs, we have rejected
paternal dictation. From the dis
cipline self-imposed arises a form of
social discipline, unselfish devotion to
a common cause, characteristic of a
land of undivided freedom. The
highest patriotism, the patriotism of
humanity, cannot develop in a people

whose every man is a patient cog in
the wheels of a social, industrial or
military machine.
Appreciation of College >lenin War.
In a discussion of the affairs of
Belgium, Professor Vernon L. Kellogg
makes this reference to the work of
these students: "There are many
other bits that might be told. Only
one shall I add. It is a word of ap
preciation of the young Americans—
I am an old one—who offered their
services and performed their work in
a way to bring warmth to the heart
and mist to the eyes of a believer in
our country and its way of producing
men. Most of these helpers—a few
more than seventy Americans have
been so far in the service—are young
college men, a considerable fraction
of them.being Rhodes scholars from
the various Oxford colleges. Trained
in college for anything but the specific
work of the commission, they seem
to have found a training that, added
to a natural initiative, has made them
capable actors in the world's work.
Thrown into a situation requiring tact
and utmost discretion, loaded with
large responsibilities and asked to
take care of themselves and import
ant affairs of the commission under
most unusual circumstances, they
have done it, almost to a man, with
success. They have won the admira
tion of the Belgians and Germans
alike. They make one proud of
America and they lend great encour
agement to an observer of American
educational methods. Viewed in their
workings, these methods have seemed
to many of us very faulty; viewed in
their results, so far as young America
is a result of education at all, our too
easy pessimism is given a proper un
settling. I return to my university
chair with renewed confidence in
American educational work."
Man Trained for Man's Work.
The democratic type of educational
discipline aims to train a man to do
a man's work in life. It should help
him to strike at the heart of world
problems for himself, guided by no
precedent. Tt enables him to act in
telligently where others are contented
with blind feeling. In the future of
Europe the transfer of its activities
from the control of the few to the
welfare of the many, the American
scholar may prove a leading or even
a determining factor.
But after all consideration of uni
versity organization and of Stanford's
participation in it, we come back to
our first proposition, ihe imperative
ness of personality. A university is
a human group. In the long run it is
what its teachers make it. Through
the resultant of all the influences that
go out from tlieni its personality is
developed. The personality of Stan
ford for these twenty-five years has
been a very friendly one. In the first
year, teachers and students lived to
gether in Eneina Hall, and when our
world and everybody in it was young,
sometimes one could hardly tell pro
fessors and students apart. The
schools of old Japan, they say, prided
themselves on the fact that the teach
ers were merely the elder scholars,
"sen-sei," they called them, "those
born before." It is moreover record
ed of these teachers, "They knew each
of us by name."
Such a condition existed in the
early days of Stanford. We as teach
ers seemed, to ourselves at least, not
much older than our students. In the
pioneer classes, we knew everyone by
name. Happily we know them still.
And while increasing numbers and the
unifying tendencies which beset every
student body have made it no longer
possible for each of us to know all of
you by name, the old habit remains.
We are still students too—only a bit
farther along. So when we meet in
the world outside, it is as friends and
fellows devoted to each other, to our
university, our nation and our ideals.
Women Temper "Stanford Spirit."
One large factor in the temper of
constructive friendliness which we
call "the Stanford spirit" comes from
the welcome presence of the Stanford
women. I remember well the feverish
haste in which Mrs. Stanford com
pleted Roble Hall between the middle
of June and the last day of September

twenty-five years ago. She said that
the women must be in at the very be
ginning, otherwise they would always
be considered as interlopers. They
should be at home at Stanford, and
from the very first day.
Whatever the future of the univer
sity, we hope that the spirit of mu
tual trust and mutual friendliness, so
potent in the early days, will always
abide here. Changes in organization
and development must come. We
trust that changes in spirit will ap
pear only as intensification.
Today we are mounting the brow
of the hill from which we look for
ward to the future as well as back
over the past. In material ways it
has been a rocky road, with perils of
litigation, financial crises, emergen
cies of earthquake and fire, misunder
standings sometimes within and with
out. But all these are left behind
and the great future opens out. We
stand, indeed, before the very Gate of
Hercules.
Progress Result of Unrest.
They say that the American univer
sity is now in a period of unrest. It
always is. Out of unrest flows pro
gress. All our institutions are in
process of change. Nothing has yet
permanent form. Straight ahead of
us at Stanford may be seen the sep
aration of the junior college. This
means the expansion of the higher
work, a more thorough training of
men "for direct usefulness in life"
than is involved in the conventional
college education. The hour for the
change need not be hastened. It will
hasten itself. The limitation in num
bers already forced upon us is a bid
for the best, a guarantee of the high
est possible service.
(■ranting of Diplomas a Privilege.
Today I look back over a long life
of teaching. 1 began it with the sole
ambition to become a naturalist, an
explorer, with an abounding passion
for geography as related to the life
of plants and animals and men. I had
never the slightest longing for execu
tive responsibility until circumstances
thrust this upon me. Rut T can see
that there is no experience in life, no
position of trust or honor, no field of
endeavor which 112 would have chosen
instead above what the fortunes of
life have assigned to me. Twenty
five years ago my colleague, President
Thwing of Western Reserve, wrote me
in congratulation, "T would rather be
President of Stanford University than
Emperor." So would I, and so would
1 again if I hart my life to live over.
Tt is the college president's func
tion not to govern, but to help; not
to rule, but to co-ordinate. His suc
cess rests on the devotion of the col
leagues with whom he surrounds
himself. With large risks and larger
trials, he has also unsurpassed op
portunities. He deals with a nation's
"youth of promise" and he meets
their parents on their best. side.
I am not unmindful of the generous
freedom accorded me by the Poard of
Trustees for the last three years with
the title of Chancellor. Put among
the experiences of my life, I count
this with the best, that nearly r>ooo
Stanford men and women have re
reived their diplomas from my hand.
To begin with, these young people
were choice spirits, else they would
never have gone to college, never
have come to Stanford University.
Here they have lived with Nature at
her best, and have "walked with
Henslows" of all types and degrees.
Finally, they have gone down "the
ppu.w atn o}m (I s.<ua\ api.w .inoj
ctich to do his nan in a brave and
reasonable way. I have met these
men and women in every state in the
Union, in London, in Germany, in
Australia, in Korea, in Japan. Some
little part, in the achievements of each
of them 1 claim for myself, a much
larger part 112 claim for my colleagues.
Leadership In Stanford Hands.
And this is our exceeding great
and unfailing reward, the only one we
ask, a grateful remembrance of our
work. Put not the least of our satis
faction in this hour lies in the cer
tainty that Stanford's leadership lies
in Stanford's hands. No stone of the
edifice we have builded during the

last twenty-five years need be rejected
in the foundation of the preater Stan
ford which is to come.
This day rounds out the first Quar
ter Century of Stanford University,
the best part of a lifetime for me and
for those of my colleagues who gath
ered around me in the early days.
This day I stand before you in some
sense as their spokesman and advo
cate. What account can we render of
our stewardship on the threshold of a
new cycle?
Speaking for myself, who have
been for forty-six years a teacher of
college men and women, I shall not
leave the fairest field of human effort
without profound emotion. But this
1 do not ask you to share. None of us
are here to stay, none of us would
halt, the procession. The old Rou
manian proverb, "Our blood goes over
into the veins of the young," we ac
cept without flinching. Young men
and young universities move faster
than old ones, and in this fact Stan
ford finds part of the secret of her
success.
Outlines Academic Ideal
Something of this success and the
elements which made it I shall try
to set before you today. I shall not
speak again of the founders' wisdom.
I have already on another occasion
recounted, largely in Mr. Stanford's
own words, his sane ideals of educa
tion and his generous plans for carry
ing them into effect. The story of the
six dark years, illuminated and saved
by the devoted loyalty of Mrs. Stan
ford, I have told at still another time
as well as I could. My present task
is to give you some account of the
principles embodied in the academic
life of the institution itself without
reference to particular individuals or
special events.
First of all, Stanford University had
for its basis a lofty moral and spir
itual purpose born of the fair hope
and the fi*ee hand which its founders
held out to us. Moreover, its roman
tic origin at once lifted it out of the
commonplace. Furthermore, as we
dreamed, it was not to duplicate old
successes or older failures, but was
to mark a new era, so we hoped, in
the training of men and women. In
a word, it was to bring the education
of tomorrow straight to the youth of
today.
Unhampered by Tradition
In those marvelous days of creative
opportunity, we were hampered by no
prearranged rule of action. No tra
dition from the old world or the new
laid on us its dead hand. As the
young president standing in the west
end of the Quadrangle proclaimed on
that eventful first day of October,
1891: "Our University has no history
to fall back upon. Xo memories of
great teachers haunt its corridors. In
none of its rooms appear the traces
which show where a great man has
lived and worked. No tender asso
ciations cling, ivy-like, to its fresh
new walls. It is hallowed by no tra
ditions. It is hampered by none. Its
finger posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow, as the
splendid lily from the modest bulb."
To be sure, we had then all the ex

perlence of the world to fall back
upon. But we were to draw our own
conclusions. Nothing forced us to use
it in any specified way. Any method
quantity was found in the ever-vary
ing traits of human nature. And on
the recognition of this infinite variety
our scheme was primarily based.
Every form of talent, we held, was
worthy of training. To develop
strength we must bring out person
ality. To this end we must first have
teachers adequate for their responsi
bilities. A university performs its
function not in what it compels, still
less in what it forbids, but in its pro
vision for intensifying the student's
best abilities.
Organization Second
Organization is a secondary thing.
It will come soon enough. Like age,
it creeps on us unawares. So the
fewer rules the better until rules make
themselves. Under the worst possible
organization, or none at all. great
teachers may do noble work, as the
history of learning clearly shows.
Wherever placed, the great man
leaves a mark on all with whom he
comes in contact. Professor Osborn
of Columbia once refered to the lie
lief that the American college, with
its happy-go-lucky lack of system,
could never produce a Darwin. In
opposition to this view, I claimed that
it could quite as readily as any other
system, given, of course, the raw ma
terial to work upon.
To my mind, in the making or a
great naturalist three things are
necessary: the original material, the
fine human stuff; next, contact with
nature; and finally, the help and ex
ample of a great teacher. These three
factors co-operated in the life of
Darwin. It is clear that Cambridge
and Edinburgh as schools of science,
did not make him. He himself bears
witness to the "incredible dullness"
of the lectures he heard. If that were
all, Stanford University could cer
tainly have done a better job.
Essentials of Greatness
But the first essential, the raw ma
terial, the choice mosaic of germ
plasm—this was already there to work
upon, and this no school could create.
The second element, contact with
nature—a free gift to all who seek it
—Darwin found on the moors of Cam
bridgeshire, by its brooks and its
bridges. In fullest measure, Califor
nia offers the same to all.
As to the third essential, the spell
of a great life, this Cambridge pro
vided. Darwin himself gives the clue.
He says that he "walked with liens
low," and Henslow was one of the
great botanists of bis time. To walk
with Henslow was in itself a gener
ous education. To make possible such
relations is the university's choicest
function. It should furnish the Hens
lows with whom the Darwins may
walk.
For the permanent values of a uni
versity center in its faculty. All the
virtues of mind and soul should be
theirs collectively, and as far as may
be, individually,—friendliness, self-de
votion, intellectual honesty, sincerity
I of purpose, love of work, strength to
; carry it on, accuracy, profundity,

broadmindedness, reverence, refine
ment, above all else, an unshaken and
unshakeable faith in human nature —
each one of these is vitally essential.
This may not all be detected in any
one man or woman, bat they must ap
pear in the composite whole.
Principles of Beginning
Nevertheless, whatever stress may
justly be laid on the personality of
teachers, one must not undervalue de
tails of organization. Traditions there
are that belittle, regulations that
starve or cramp, details that irritate,
and limitations that waste. A uni
versity should be framed for advance
ment. The chambers of its soul
should widen as the years go by.
Whatever bounds it imposes on itself
should be flexible and temporary.
Then as its life grows more complex,
it must frame certain rules of pro
cedure. The value of these rules will
rest on the principle that lies behind
them. Stanford was free to choose its
own educational principles. The four
most fundamental with which we
started were (a) the democracy of
mental powers, (b) the elective sys
tem, (c) the major department ar
rangement, and (d) the vital import
ance of individual initiative as the
prime element in character building.
With these, coeducation and the ap
plication of science were taken as mat
ters of course.
Aim of Quality Chosen
Negatively, we did not believe in
prescribed courses of study, in the
disciplinary value of undigested learn
ing, in promoting scholarship by pro
hibitions, by marks, honors, prizes, or
by financial subsidies as baits in
the educational trap. Furthermore, we
resolved that a university need not be
valued for its bigness, nor even for
the variety of its functions, believing
it better to do a few things well than
to strive weakly to cover the whole
ground of learning. For the ultimate
function of the endowed university
must be differentiated from that of the
state institution. It is the duty of
the latter to minister to all the higher
educational needs of the state. It is
the privilege of the former to set
standards of aim and standards of
achievement.
And further still, we conceived of
university life as an opportunity, to
be looked on as such by all who
came. Those who did not rise to its
stimulus were better somewhere else.
So because the chief source of human
wastage in our republic is the open
saloon, from the first we refused to
enter into rivalry with this, —or any
other institution that fattens on men's
weaknesses. The chains of a vile
habit inhibit wholesome development.
"Free should the scholar be, free and
brave."
Democracy of Mental Powers
Let us go bark to our four prin
ciples of organization, to consider
them in some detail. And here I must
ask the kind indulgence of all whose
fate it has been for a quarter of cen
tury to hear me expound in theory
and in practice the element of free
dom in education. That has been our
watchword. And because from the be

ginning we wished to emphasize the
value of intellectual freedom, of dis
cipline which is self-imposed, not
vouchsafed from above, we chose as
our academic motto the words of Ill
rich von Hutten, spoken four centur
ies ago, "Die Luft der Freheit weht,"
"The winds of freedom are blowing."
Democracy of the mind was the in
spiration of the early days of Cornell
University. Under its lead, we of the
pioneer clas-s of 1872 established our
first college journal. We called it
"The Cornell Era." For it truly
marked a new era in college history
when college men studied engineering
and agriculture along with Greek and
Latin, when even in a literary course
geology and botany might be counted
towards a degree. That such sub
jects could be accepted was the pri
mary reason why I myself went to
Cornell and not to Yale.
Democracy of the mind was not the
discovery of Andrew D. White, its
greatest apostle. No great idea orig
inates perhaps with any one person.
Hut at Cornell it was first developed
in workable fashion. It holds that
all mental powers should be recog
nized as free and equal, each alike
entitled to make the most of itself.
In this spirit, Ezra Cornell had said,
"I would found an institution in which
any person may find instruction in
any study." Indeed, it is not for the
university to foster any aristocracy of
studies. It shall not maintain Latin
or Greek or philosophy or physics, or
anything else, as a primary essential
in education, or that those whose
minds do not turn in some favored
direction shall be left uneducated. All
the powers of the mind, the applica
tion of knowledge as well as its ex
tension and preservation, are the sub
ject-matter of the university.
Elective System Adopted
Such a conception of higher educa
tion naturally finds its expression in
the elective system, which involves
the abandonment of the old idea in
volved in the word "curriculum" or
little race-course, with its low and
high hurdles, its "little go" and its
"great go," around which the student
moved for three or four years, return
ing at commencement for his final re
ward. The more tedious the discip
line, the greater was its supposed
value, and the reward for penance
done lay in the goodfellowship which
common boredom entailed. Under the
pressure of the widening of human
knowledge, the applications of sci
ence and the insistence of human
needs, the American college has
changed its theory in these regards.
The curriculum is no longer a race
course. Its participants do not run in
a circle, but set out in all directions
along widely divergent paths. For
the new appeal of widened helpful
ness has brought into the college new
and variant types of men, with variant
needs. Teachers brought up under the
old regime have generally ill under
stood how to deal with these. Mean
while the new appeal has brought new
popularities and it must be admitted
that many students are sent to the
universites because they have shown
no promise anywhere else.

Two Classes'of Students
College students in general may be
divided into two classes: those who
care and those who don't. Only the
first class need be considered. What
ever the needs of the others, their
place is not in the college. Students
who care may be again divided as to
the impulse, whether volitional or vo
cational, which compels their interest.
The best students in each field are
those who work for the love of it.
They may be classical scholars,
"Greek-minded men or Roman-minded
men," to use Emerson's phrase, or
they may be botanists, anatomists,
physiologists, chemists, teachers, phil
ologists, historians, engineers, econ
omists, physicians or jurists. They
may spring up in any field, and they
work to the limit for the mere joy of
working. The investigators of the
world, those who widen the scope of
knowledge in an appreciable degree,
belong to this class. Every door
should be held wide open for them,
and not one of them should be com
pelled to turn out of his way by the
lure of a.degree.
The vocational impulse has also its
place in the higher training. It may
express itself in perseverance rather
than in enthusiasm. A man will stick
to an uninteresting topic if he can
relate it to the affairs of life. An in
telligent student will always recognize
vocational reasons for pushing onward
to success. This is why the engineer
ing students in our universities are,
broadly speaking, better scholars than
students of literature. They see that
their future depends absolutely on
preparation. They are to deal with
the forces of nature, and nature
brooks no ignorance or deception..
They say at Harvard, "One is a fool
to study in the college; one is a fool
not to study in the law school." It
is a matter of common observation
that in professional schools of high
standards even the idler and the
dilettante may suddenly rise to hon
est work.
Joy in Vocational Training
It is, therefore, not a forward move
ment, for colleges and universities to
turn away from vocational studies in
the interest of pure culture. The vo
cation. however, must not be narrow
ly construed, as a man of force in any
field needs as wide a horizon as the
university can give him. No effort is
wasted if undertaken conscientiously
and with the purpose of adding found
ation on which one's specialty may
rest. Hut without volitional or voca
tional relations, without joy in the
work or hope in its final completion,
a boy would better keep out of col
lege and turn his attention as soon as
possible to something which to him is
real.
In the beginning Stanford Univer
sity adopted the elective system with
open eyes, certain that no other one
made possible the best scholarship.
The old classical course has not
broken down under the pressure of
live subjects and live issues. It rested
on the noble basis of Greek thought
and Greek expression. Its ideal look-
ed backward and upward to the loft
iest achievements of the human race
in the matter of beauty of form, of
language and of thought. As Thoreau
once observed, "Those only talk of
forgetting Greek who never knew it."
To the "Greek-minded man" these four
years in academic shades in company
with gracious thoughts were most sat
isfying and enlarging.
Hut the course was narrow and
special, and some thirty years ago it
began to give place to that condition
of affairs which I have elsewhere
called the "patchwork" stage of the
curriculum. The expansion of the
natural and physical sciences, each
one changing the whole current of
thought in its field; the demands of
French and German literature; a new
attitude towards the movements of
history; the growth of economics, jur
isprudence, modern philosophy, not
safe nor sane perhaps, but drawn
from the study of things as they are,
—all these, one by one or altogether,
clamored for a place in college
courses. Slowly, grudgingly, all were
admitted, crowding out, in greater or
less measure, Greek, calculus and
Latin. Each new subject, like the
camel with its head under the tent,
moved forward to occupy. Each sub
ject, old and new, was squeezed to
the briefest possible compass, though
the new ones were no more compre
hensible than the old. It was clear
before long that not all could be
brought into one uniform course. To
that end several arrangements were
devised, in each of which some edu
cational faction should have its way
But these ill adjusted and shifting
courses were necessarily less special
ized and therefore less thorough than
the old classical one, and as ad
vanced work in one subject has a
greater cultural value than elementary
work in several, so in almost every
regard the patchwork system marked
a step downward.
This period, however, was only one
of transition, and led directly to the
elective system, which made thorough
ness possible in any one of many
lines. In a prescribed course the stu
dent has little or no choice, and yet
the element of choice is in itself a
leading factor in individual training.
A democratic institution should min
ister to all types of men in quest of
higher education. It matters not
through what agency the miracle is
wrought. It may be achieved through
the melting of vanadium steel or by
a study of the satires of Horace.
The structure of the cell-nucleus of
a tadpole is as intricate and may be
as fascinating as that of the British
constitution, or a drama of Euripides.
Under the elective system it is pos
sible for a teacher to do his finest
work. No longer occupied with "the
dregs of learning," as Agassiz once
termed the college course at Harvard,
he can lead the learner and thus lead
himself to the firing lines of science.
With students in earnest, advanced
and thorough work becomes possible.
Such students give the teacher new
life.
Elective System Marks New Growth.
With the enlarged usefulness which
marked the advent of the elective sys
tem twenty to thirty years ago, began
the new growth of the colleges. They
drew men of new kinds, and many
more of them than ever before. This
fresh impulse was dominant in the
early days of Stanford, and a like
stimulus soon gave new life to the
whole university world. Ready-made
courses, the acme of pedagogic lazi
ness, were discarded. Like ready
made clothing, such courses really fit
nobody, and an education, like a suit
of clothes, should be fitted to the man
who is to wear it.
Some criticisms still apply to the
elective system. It has not yet wholly
eliminated "the reluctant student."
Hut can any system do this? No plan
ever made a lazy man brilliant. It is
to the earnest and efficient that the
opportunities of college life should be
granted. As a rule, students do not
elect the easiest studies and those
who do soon find their enjoyments
elsewhere.
Further, we are told that the elec

tive system offers temptations to un
due or premature specialization. This
also is true, and premature specializa
tion, like other forms of precocious
virtue, is to be deprecated. But ex
perience does not show that the
danger of "undue specialization" is a
serious one. The current, in college
and out, mostly sets the other way.
The fact that a man ventures to spec
ialize at all, shows that he has a cer
tain independence of character for the
odds are against it. Specialization im
plies thoroughness. It gives to each
man a base-line by which he can
measure the attainments of others.
No knowledge comes amiss to an in
vestigator; but no investigator can af
ford to sacrifice his specialty for the
sake of breadth. Thoroughness is the
main point, and should take preced
ence over versatility. 1 do not advo
cate narrowness of sympathy or nar
rowness of culture. The broadest ed
ucation is none too broad for the
growing scholar in any field. But the
forces of the mind should not be scat
tered in guerilla bands, but marshalled
toward leadership.
Major Department Arrangement.
Recognizing the conditions from the
very first, Stanford attempted to
strengthen and support the principle
of election in studies by means of the
major department arrangement. This
plan as we know it at Stanford and
as more or less developed in several
other universities, among them Har
vard, was forshadowed in these words
of Agassiz to his students in 1873:
"A specialty is the backbone of edu
cation. The mind is made strong by
the thorough possession of some
thing."
The final test of the elective system
must be found in its results. What
sort of man does it produce? What
is its relation to the discipline neces
sary to effectiveness in life? Dis
cipline means self-control, the power
to subordinate personal interest to the
larger needs of societies or nations,
the power to co-operate with other
men in the accomplishment of worthy
results. In this matter our people
tend to undervalue our actual achieve
ments, for too often uniformity is
mistaken for discipline. Unques
tioned obedience is not discipline.
Real discipline involves response
with head and heart to the dictates
of individual conscience, the "cate
gorical imperative" as set forth by
Immanuel Kant-. The uncritical sub
mission now shown by the masses
in Central Europe stands in exact
opposition to the dictum of the great
philosopher.
The output of our colleges has not
the uniformity for which Europe has
striven. Much that Europe values,
justly or not, we have neglected in
the interest of newer and sometimes
weightier demands. Substance is
more important than polish, and in
itiative outweighs all other forms of
efficiency. It is our highest aim in
America to grant not merely a lib
eral education, but, to borrow a word
from Dr. Peabody, a "liberating edu
cation," which shall fit a man to meet
unforseen demands.
Pledged To Personal Inithitive.
Democratic discipline and paternal
discipline lie at opposite poles in
national development. Each has its
defenders in our republic as else
where. But as a nation we stand
pledged to the discipline that evolves
from within and rests on personal
initiative. Its results are unequal,
but in the long run it is more effic
ient as an impulse in individual or
social life. We work under orders as
before, but not sealed orders. The
true American belongs to a political
party or a religious organization, not
to take direction from it, but to use
it for purposes which he shares with
the group. To him the party or or
ganization is a means towards indi
vidual or social ends, not an end in
itself. In our higher education as in
our political affairs, we have rejected
paternal dictation. From the dis
cipline self-imposed arises a form of
social discipline, unselfish devotion to
a common cause, characteristic of a
land of undivided freedom. The
highest patriotism, the patriotism of
humanity, cannot develop in a people

whose every man is a patient cog in
the wheels of a social, industrial or
military machine.
Appreciation of College >lenin War.
In a discussion of the affairs of
Belgium, Professor Vernon L. Kellogg
makes this reference to the work of
these students: "There are many
other bits that might be told. Only
one shall I add. It is a word of ap
preciation of the young Americans—
I am an old one—who offered their
services and performed their work in
a way to bring warmth to the heart
and mist to the eyes of a believer in
our country and its way of producing
men. Most of these helpers—a few
more than seventy Americans have
been so far in the service—are young
college men, a considerable fraction
of them.being Rhodes scholars from
the various Oxford colleges. Trained
in college for anything but the specific
work of the commission, they seem
to have found a training that, added
to a natural initiative, has made them
capable actors in the world's work.
Thrown into a situation requiring tact
and utmost discretion, loaded with
large responsibilities and asked to
take care of themselves and import
ant affairs of the commission under
most unusual circumstances, they
have done it, almost to a man, with
success. They have won the admira
tion of the Belgians and Germans
alike. They make one proud of
America and they lend great encour
agement to an observer of American
educational methods. Viewed in their
workings, these methods have seemed
to many of us very faulty; viewed in
their results, so far as young America
is a result of education at all, our too
easy pessimism is given a proper un
settling. I return to my university
chair with renewed confidence in
American educational work."
Man Trained for Man's Work.
The democratic type of educational
discipline aims to train a man to do
a man's work in life. It should help
him to strike at the heart of world
problems for himself, guided by no
precedent. Tt enables him to act in
telligently where others are contented
with blind feeling. In the future of
Europe the transfer of its activities
from the control of the few to the
welfare of the many, the American
scholar may prove a leading or even
a determining factor.
But after all consideration of uni
versity organization and of Stanford's
participation in it, we come back to
our first proposition, ihe imperative
ness of personality. A university is
a human group. In the long run it is
what its teachers make it. Through
the resultant of all the influences that
go out from tlieni its personality is
developed. The personality of Stan
ford for these twenty-five years has
been a very friendly one. In the first
year, teachers and students lived to
gether in Eneina Hall, and when our
world and everybody in it was young,
sometimes one could hardly tell pro
fessors and students apart. The
schools of old Japan, they say, prided
themselves on the fact that the teach
ers were merely the elder scholars,
"sen-sei," they called them, "those
born before." It is moreover record
ed of these teachers, "They knew each
of us by name."
Such a condition existed in the
early days of Stanford. We as teach
ers seemed, to ourselves at least, not
much older than our students. In the
pioneer classes, we knew everyone by
name. Happily we know them still.
And while increasing numbers and the
unifying tendencies which beset every
student body have made it no longer
possible for each of us to know all of
you by name, the old habit remains.
We are still students too—only a bit
farther along. So when we meet in
the world outside, it is as friends and
fellows devoted to each other, to our
university, our nation and our ideals.
Women Temper "Stanford Spirit."
One large factor in the temper of
constructive friendliness which we
call "the Stanford spirit" comes from
the welcome presence of the Stanford
women. I remember well the feverish
haste in which Mrs. Stanford com
pleted Roble Hall between the middle
of June and the last day of September

twenty-five years ago. She said that
the women must be in at the very be
ginning, otherwise they would always
be considered as interlopers. They
should be at home at Stanford, and
from the very first day.
Whatever the future of the univer
sity, we hope that the spirit of mu
tual trust and mutual friendliness, so
potent in the early days, will always
abide here. Changes in organization
and development must come. We
trust that changes in spirit will ap
pear only as intensification.
Today we are mounting the brow
of the hill from which we look for
ward to the future as well as back
over the past. In material ways it
has been a rocky road, with perils of
litigation, financial crises, emergen
cies of earthquake and fire, misunder
standings sometimes within and with
out. But all these are left behind
and the great future opens out. We
stand, indeed, before the very Gate of
Hercules.
Progress Result of Unrest.
They say that the American univer
sity is now in a period of unrest. It
always is. Out of unrest flows pro
gress. All our institutions are in
process of change. Nothing has yet
permanent form. Straight ahead of
us at Stanford may be seen the sep
aration of the junior college. This
means the expansion of the higher
work, a more thorough training of
men "for direct usefulness in life"
than is involved in the conventional
college education. The hour for the
change need not be hastened. It will
hasten itself. The limitation in num
bers already forced upon us is a bid
for the best, a guarantee of the high
est possible service.
(■ranting of Diplomas a Privilege.
Today I look back over a long life
of teaching. 1 began it with the sole
ambition to become a naturalist, an
explorer, with an abounding passion
for geography as related to the life
of plants and animals and men. I had
never the slightest longing for execu
tive responsibility until circumstances
thrust this upon me. Rut T can see
that there is no experience in life, no
position of trust or honor, no field of
endeavor which 112 would have chosen
instead above what the fortunes of
life have assigned to me. Twenty
five years ago my colleague, President
Thwing of Western Reserve, wrote me
in congratulation, "T would rather be
President of Stanford University than
Emperor." So would I, and so would
1 again if I hart my life to live over.
Tt is the college president's func
tion not to govern, but to help; not
to rule, but to co-ordinate. His suc
cess rests on the devotion of the col
leagues with whom he surrounds
himself. With large risks and larger
trials, he has also unsurpassed op
portunities. He deals with a nation's
"youth of promise" and he meets
their parents on their best. side.
I am not unmindful of the generous
freedom accorded me by the Poard of
Trustees for the last three years with
the title of Chancellor. Put among
the experiences of my life, I count
this with the best, that nearly r>ooo
Stanford men and women have re
reived their diplomas from my hand.
To begin with, these young people
were choice spirits, else they would
never have gone to college, never
have come to Stanford University.
Here they have lived with Nature at
her best, and have "walked with
Henslows" of all types and degrees.
Finally, they have gone down "the
ppu.w atn o}m (I s.<ua\ api.w .inoj
ctich to do his nan in a brave and
reasonable way. I have met these
men and women in every state in the
Union, in London, in Germany, in
Australia, in Korea, in Japan. Some
little part, in the achievements of each
of them 1 claim for myself, a much
larger part 112 claim for my colleagues.
Leadership In Stanford Hands.
And this is our exceeding great
and unfailing reward, the only one we
ask, a grateful remembrance of our
work. Put not the least of our satis
faction in this hour lies in the cer
tainty that Stanford's leadership lies
in Stanford's hands. No stone of the
edifice we have builded during the

last twenty-five years need be rejected
in the foundation of the preater Stan
ford which is to come.
This day rounds out the first Quar
ter Century of Stanford University,
the best part of a lifetime for me and
for those of my colleagues who gath
ered around me in the early days.
This day I stand before you in some
sense as their spokesman and advo
cate. What account can we render of
our stewardship on the threshold of a
new cycle?
Speaking for myself, who have
been for forty-six years a teacher of
college men and women, I shall not
leave the fairest field of human effort
without profound emotion. But this
1 do not ask you to share. None of us
are here to stay, none of us would
halt, the procession. The old Rou
manian proverb, "Our blood goes over
into the veins of the young," we ac
cept without flinching. Young men
and young universities move faster
than old ones, and in this fact Stan
ford finds part of the secret of her
success.
Outlines Academic Ideal
Something of this success and the
elements which made it I shall try
to set before you today. I shall not
speak again of the founders' wisdom.
I have already on another occasion
recounted, largely in Mr. Stanford's
own words, his sane ideals of educa
tion and his generous plans for carry
ing them into effect. The story of the
six dark years, illuminated and saved
by the devoted loyalty of Mrs. Stan
ford, I have told at still another time
as well as I could. My present task
is to give you some account of the
principles embodied in the academic
life of the institution itself without
reference to particular individuals or
special events.
First of all, Stanford University had
for its basis a lofty moral and spir
itual purpose born of the fair hope
and the fi*ee hand which its founders
held out to us. Moreover, its roman
tic origin at once lifted it out of the
commonplace. Furthermore, as we
dreamed, it was not to duplicate old
successes or older failures, but was
to mark a new era, so we hoped, in
the training of men and women. In
a word, it was to bring the education
of tomorrow straight to the youth of
today.
Unhampered by Tradition
In those marvelous days of creative
opportunity, we were hampered by no
prearranged rule of action. No tra
dition from the old world or the new
laid on us its dead hand. As the
young president standing in the west
end of the Quadrangle proclaimed on
that eventful first day of October,
1891: "Our University has no history
to fall back upon. Xo memories of
great teachers haunt its corridors. In
none of its rooms appear the traces
which show where a great man has
lived and worked. No tender asso
ciations cling, ivy-like, to its fresh
new walls. It is hallowed by no tra
ditions. It is hampered by none. Its
finger posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow, as the
splendid lily from the modest bulb."
To be sure, we had then all the ex

perlence of the world to fall back
upon. But we were to draw our own
conclusions. Nothing forced us to use
it in any specified way. Any method
quantity was found in the ever-vary
ing traits of human nature. And on
the recognition of this infinite variety
our scheme was primarily based.
Every form of talent, we held, was
worthy of training. To develop
strength we must bring out person
ality. To this end we must first have
teachers adequate for their responsi
bilities. A university performs its
function not in what it compels, still
less in what it forbids, but in its pro
vision for intensifying the student's
best abilities.
Organization Second
Organization is a secondary thing.
It will come soon enough. Like age,
it creeps on us unawares. So the
fewer rules the better until rules make
themselves. Under the worst possible
organization, or none at all. great
teachers may do noble work, as the
history of learning clearly shows.
Wherever placed, the great man
leaves a mark on all with whom he
comes in contact. Professor Osborn
of Columbia once refered to the lie
lief that the American college, with
its happy-go-lucky lack of system,
could never produce a Darwin. In
opposition to this view, I claimed that
it could quite as readily as any other
system, given, of course, the raw ma
terial to work upon.
To my mind, in the making or a
great naturalist three things are
necessary: the original material, the
fine human stuff; next, contact with
nature; and finally, the help and ex
ample of a great teacher. These three
factors co-operated in the life of
Darwin. It is clear that Cambridge
and Edinburgh as schools of science,
did not make him. He himself bears
witness to the "incredible dullness"
of the lectures he heard. If that were
all, Stanford University could cer
tainly have done a better job.
Essentials of Greatness
But the first essential, the raw ma
terial, the choice mosaic of germ
plasm—this was already there to work
upon, and this no school could create.
The second element, contact with
nature—a free gift to all who seek it
—Darwin found on the moors of Cam
bridgeshire, by its brooks and its
bridges. In fullest measure, Califor
nia offers the same to all.
As to the third essential, the spell
of a great life, this Cambridge pro
vided. Darwin himself gives the clue.
He says that he "walked with liens
low," and Henslow was one of the
great botanists of bis time. To walk
with Henslow was in itself a gener
ous education. To make possible such
relations is the university's choicest
function. It should furnish the Hens
lows with whom the Darwins may
walk.
For the permanent values of a uni
versity center in its faculty. All the
virtues of mind and soul should be
theirs collectively, and as far as may
be, individually,—friendliness, self-de
votion, intellectual honesty, sincerity
I of purpose, love of work, strength to
; carry it on, accuracy, profundity,

broadmindedness, reverence, refine
ment, above all else, an unshaken and
unshakeable faith in human nature —
each one of these is vitally essential.
This may not all be detected in any
one man or woman, bat they must ap
pear in the composite whole.
Principles of Beginning
Nevertheless, whatever stress may
justly be laid on the personality of
teachers, one must not undervalue de
tails of organization. Traditions there
are that belittle, regulations that
starve or cramp, details that irritate,
and limitations that waste. A uni
versity should be framed for advance
ment. The chambers of its soul
should widen as the years go by.
Whatever bounds it imposes on itself
should be flexible and temporary.
Then as its life grows more complex,
it must frame certain rules of pro
cedure. The value of these rules will
rest on the principle that lies behind
them. Stanford was free to choose its
own educational principles. The four
most fundamental with which we
started were (a) the democracy of
mental powers, (b) the elective sys
tem, (c) the major department ar
rangement, and (d) the vital import
ance of individual initiative as the
prime element in character building.
With these, coeducation and the ap
plication of science were taken as mat
ters of course.
Aim of Quality Chosen
Negatively, we did not believe in
prescribed courses of study, in the
disciplinary value of undigested learn
ing, in promoting scholarship by pro
hibitions, by marks, honors, prizes, or
by financial subsidies as baits in
the educational trap. Furthermore, we
resolved that a university need not be
valued for its bigness, nor even for
the variety of its functions, believing
it better to do a few things well than
to strive weakly to cover the whole
ground of learning. For the ultimate
function of the endowed university
must be differentiated from that of the
state institution. It is the duty of
the latter to minister to all the higher
educational needs of the state. It is
the privilege of the former to set
standards of aim and standards of
achievement.
And further still, we conceived of
university life as an opportunity, to
be looked on as such by all who
came. Those who did not rise to its
stimulus were better somewhere else.
So because the chief source of human
wastage in our republic is the open
saloon, from the first we refused to
enter into rivalry with this, —or any
other institution that fattens on men's
weaknesses. The chains of a vile
habit inhibit wholesome development.
"Free should the scholar be, free and
brave."
Democracy of Mental Powers
Let us go bark to our four prin
ciples of organization, to consider
them in some detail. And here I must
ask the kind indulgence of all whose
fate it has been for a quarter of cen
tury to hear me expound in theory
and in practice the element of free
dom in education. That has been our
watchword. And because from the be

ginning we wished to emphasize the
value of intellectual freedom, of dis
cipline which is self-imposed, not
vouchsafed from above, we chose as
our academic motto the words of Ill
rich von Hutten, spoken four centur
ies ago, "Die Luft der Freheit weht,"
"The winds of freedom are blowing."
Democracy of the mind was the in
spiration of the early days of Cornell
University. Under its lead, we of the
pioneer clas-s of 1872 established our
first college journal. We called it
"The Cornell Era." For it truly
marked a new era in college history
when college men studied engineering
and agriculture along with Greek and
Latin, when even in a literary course
geology and botany might be counted
towards a degree. That such sub
jects could be accepted was the pri
mary reason why I myself went to
Cornell and not to Yale.
Democracy of the mind was not the
discovery of Andrew D. White, its
greatest apostle. No great idea orig
inates perhaps with any one person.
Hut at Cornell it was first developed
in workable fashion. It holds that
all mental powers should be recog
nized as free and equal, each alike
entitled to make the most of itself.
In this spirit, Ezra Cornell had said,
"I would found an institution in which
any person may find instruction in
any study." Indeed, it is not for the
university to foster any aristocracy of
studies. It shall not maintain Latin
or Greek or philosophy or physics, or
anything else, as a primary essential
in education, or that those whose
minds do not turn in some favored
direction shall be left uneducated. All
the powers of the mind, the applica
tion of knowledge as well as its ex
tension and preservation, are the sub
ject-matter of the university.
Elective System Adopted
Such a conception of higher educa
tion naturally finds its expression in
the elective system, which involves
the abandonment of the old idea in
volved in the word "curriculum" or
little race-course, with its low and
high hurdles, its "little go" and its
"great go," around which the student
moved for three or four years, return
ing at commencement for his final re
ward. The more tedious the discip
line, the greater was its supposed
value, and the reward for penance
done lay in the goodfellowship which
common boredom entailed. Under the
pressure of the widening of human
knowledge, the applications of sci
ence and the insistence of human
needs, the American college has
changed its theory in these regards.
The curriculum is no longer a race
course. Its participants do not run in
a circle, but set out in all directions
along widely divergent paths. For
the new appeal of widened helpful
ness has brought into the college new
and variant types of men, with variant
needs. Teachers brought up under the
old regime have generally ill under
stood how to deal with these. Mean
while the new appeal has brought new
popularities and it must be admitted
that many students are sent to the
universites because they have shown
no promise anywhere else.

Two Classes'of Students
College students in general may be
divided into two classes: those who
care and those who don't. Only the
first class need be considered. What
ever the needs of the others, their
place is not in the college. Students
who care may be again divided as to
the impulse, whether volitional or vo
cational, which compels their interest.
The best students in each field are
those who work for the love of it.
They may be classical scholars,
"Greek-minded men or Roman-minded
men," to use Emerson's phrase, or
they may be botanists, anatomists,
physiologists, chemists, teachers, phil
ologists, historians, engineers, econ
omists, physicians or jurists. They
may spring up in any field, and they
work to the limit for the mere joy of
working. The investigators of the
world, those who widen the scope of
knowledge in an appreciable degree,
belong to this class. Every door
should be held wide open for them,
and not one of them should be com
pelled to turn out of his way by the
lure of a.degree.
The vocational impulse has also its
place in the higher training. It may
express itself in perseverance rather
than in enthusiasm. A man will stick
to an uninteresting topic if he can
relate it to the affairs of life. An in
telligent student will always recognize
vocational reasons for pushing onward
to success. This is why the engineer
ing students in our universities are,
broadly speaking, better scholars than
students of literature. They see that
their future depends absolutely on
preparation. They are to deal with
the forces of nature, and nature
brooks no ignorance or deception..
They say at Harvard, "One is a fool
to study in the college; one is a fool
not to study in the law school." It
is a matter of common observation
that in professional schools of high
standards even the idler and the
dilettante may suddenly rise to hon
est work.
Joy in Vocational Training
It is, therefore, not a forward move
ment, for colleges and universities to
turn away from vocational studies in
the interest of pure culture. The vo
cation. however, must not be narrow
ly construed, as a man of force in any
field needs as wide a horizon as the
university can give him. No effort is
wasted if undertaken conscientiously
and with the purpose of adding found
ation on which one's specialty may
rest. Hut without volitional or voca
tional relations, without joy in the
work or hope in its final completion,
a boy would better keep out of col
lege and turn his attention as soon as
possible to something which to him is
real.
In the beginning Stanford Univer
sity adopted the elective system with
open eyes, certain that no other one
made possible the best scholarship.
The old classical course has not
broken down under the pressure of
live subjects and live issues. It rested
on the noble basis of Greek thought
and Greek expression. Its ideal look-
ed backward and upward to the loft
iest achievements of the human race
in the matter of beauty of form, of
language and of thought. As Thoreau
once observed, "Those only talk of
forgetting Greek who never knew it."
To the "Greek-minded man" these four
years in academic shades in company
with gracious thoughts were most sat
isfying and enlarging.
Hut the course was narrow and
special, and some thirty years ago it
began to give place to that condition
of affairs which I have elsewhere
called the "patchwork" stage of the
curriculum. The expansion of the
natural and physical sciences, each
one changing the whole current of
thought in its field; the demands of
French and German literature; a new
attitude towards the movements of
history; the growth of economics, jur
isprudence, modern philosophy, not
safe nor sane perhaps, but drawn
from the study of things as they are,
—all these, one by one or altogether,
clamored for a place in college
courses. Slowly, grudgingly, all were
admitted, crowding out, in greater or
less measure, Greek, calculus and
Latin. Each new subject, like the
camel with its head under the tent,
moved forward to occupy. Each sub
ject, old and new, was squeezed to
the briefest possible compass, though
the new ones were no more compre
hensible than the old. It was clear
before long that not all could be
brought into one uniform course. To
that end several arrangements were
devised, in each of which some edu
cational faction should have its way
But these ill adjusted and shifting
courses were necessarily less special
ized and therefore less thorough than
the old classical one, and as ad
vanced work in one subject has a
greater cultural value than elementary
work in several, so in almost every
regard the patchwork system marked
a step downward.
This period, however, was only one
of transition, and led directly to the
elective system, which made thorough
ness possible in any one of many
lines. In a prescribed course the stu
dent has little or no choice, and yet
the element of choice is in itself a
leading factor in individual training.
A democratic institution should min
ister to all types of men in quest of
higher education. It matters not
through what agency the miracle is
wrought. It may be achieved through
the melting of vanadium steel or by
a study of the satires of Horace.
The structure of the cell-nucleus of
a tadpole is as intricate and may be
as fascinating as that of the British
constitution, or a drama of Euripides.
Under the elective system it is pos
sible for a teacher to do his finest
work. No longer occupied with "the
dregs of learning," as Agassiz once
termed the college course at Harvard,
he can lead the learner and thus lead
himself to the firing lines of science.
With students in earnest, advanced
and thorough work becomes possible.
Such students give the teacher new
life.
Elective System Marks New Growth.
With the enlarged usefulness which
marked the advent of the elective sys
tem twenty to thirty years ago, began
the new growth of the colleges. They
drew men of new kinds, and many
more of them than ever before. This
fresh impulse was dominant in the
early days of Stanford, and a like
stimulus soon gave new life to the
whole university world. Ready-made
courses, the acme of pedagogic lazi
ness, were discarded. Like ready
made clothing, such courses really fit
nobody, and an education, like a suit
of clothes, should be fitted to the man
who is to wear it.
Some criticisms still apply to the
elective system. It has not yet wholly
eliminated "the reluctant student."
Hut can any system do this? No plan
ever made a lazy man brilliant. It is
to the earnest and efficient that the
opportunities of college life should be
granted. As a rule, students do not
elect the easiest studies and those
who do soon find their enjoyments
elsewhere.
Further, we are told that the elec

tive system offers temptations to un
due or premature specialization. This
also is true, and premature specializa
tion, like other forms of precocious
virtue, is to be deprecated. But ex
perience does not show that the
danger of "undue specialization" is a
serious one. The current, in college
and out, mostly sets the other way.
The fact that a man ventures to spec
ialize at all, shows that he has a cer
tain independence of character for the
odds are against it. Specialization im
plies thoroughness. It gives to each
man a base-line by which he can
measure the attainments of others.
No knowledge comes amiss to an in
vestigator; but no investigator can af
ford to sacrifice his specialty for the
sake of breadth. Thoroughness is the
main point, and should take preced
ence over versatility. 1 do not advo
cate narrowness of sympathy or nar
rowness of culture. The broadest ed
ucation is none too broad for the
growing scholar in any field. But the
forces of the mind should not be scat
tered in guerilla bands, but marshalled
toward leadership.
Major Department Arrangement.
Recognizing the conditions from the
very first, Stanford attempted to
strengthen and support the principle
of election in studies by means of the
major department arrangement. This
plan as we know it at Stanford and
as more or less developed in several
other universities, among them Har
vard, was forshadowed in these words
of Agassiz to his students in 1873:
"A specialty is the backbone of edu
cation. The mind is made strong by
the thorough possession of some
thing."
The final test of the elective system
must be found in its results. What
sort of man does it produce? What
is its relation to the discipline neces
sary to effectiveness in life? Dis
cipline means self-control, the power
to subordinate personal interest to the
larger needs of societies or nations,
the power to co-operate with other
men in the accomplishment of worthy
results. In this matter our people
tend to undervalue our actual achieve
ments, for too often uniformity is
mistaken for discipline. Unques
tioned obedience is not discipline.
Real discipline involves response
with head and heart to the dictates
of individual conscience, the "cate
gorical imperative" as set forth by
Immanuel Kant-. The uncritical sub
mission now shown by the masses
in Central Europe stands in exact
opposition to the dictum of the great
philosopher.
The output of our colleges has not
the uniformity for which Europe has
striven. Much that Europe values,
justly or not, we have neglected in
the interest of newer and sometimes
weightier demands. Substance is
more important than polish, and in
itiative outweighs all other forms of
efficiency. It is our highest aim in
America to grant not merely a lib
eral education, but, to borrow a word
from Dr. Peabody, a "liberating edu
cation," which shall fit a man to meet
unforseen demands.
Pledged To Personal Inithitive.
Democratic discipline and paternal
discipline lie at opposite poles in
national development. Each has its
defenders in our republic as else
where. But as a nation we stand
pledged to the discipline that evolves
from within and rests on personal
initiative. Its results are unequal,
but in the long run it is more effic
ient as an impulse in individual or
social life. We work under orders as
before, but not sealed orders. The
true American belongs to a political
party or a religious organization, not
to take direction from it, but to use
it for purposes which he shares with
the group. To him the party or or
ganization is a means towards indi
vidual or social ends, not an end in
itself. In our higher education as in
our political affairs, we have rejected
paternal dictation. From the dis
cipline self-imposed arises a form of
social discipline, unselfish devotion to
a common cause, characteristic of a
land of undivided freedom. The
highest patriotism, the patriotism of
humanity, cannot develop in a people

whose every man is a patient cog in
the wheels of a social, industrial or
military machine.
Appreciation of College >lenin War.
In a discussion of the affairs of
Belgium, Professor Vernon L. Kellogg
makes this reference to the work of
these students: "There are many
other bits that might be told. Only
one shall I add. It is a word of ap
preciation of the young Americans—
I am an old one—who offered their
services and performed their work in
a way to bring warmth to the heart
and mist to the eyes of a believer in
our country and its way of producing
men. Most of these helpers—a few
more than seventy Americans have
been so far in the service—are young
college men, a considerable fraction
of them.being Rhodes scholars from
the various Oxford colleges. Trained
in college for anything but the specific
work of the commission, they seem
to have found a training that, added
to a natural initiative, has made them
capable actors in the world's work.
Thrown into a situation requiring tact
and utmost discretion, loaded with
large responsibilities and asked to
take care of themselves and import
ant affairs of the commission under
most unusual circumstances, they
have done it, almost to a man, with
success. They have won the admira
tion of the Belgians and Germans
alike. They make one proud of
America and they lend great encour
agement to an observer of American
educational methods. Viewed in their
workings, these methods have seemed
to many of us very faulty; viewed in
their results, so far as young America
is a result of education at all, our too
easy pessimism is given a proper un
settling. I return to my university
chair with renewed confidence in
American educational work."
Man Trained for Man's Work.
The democratic type of educational
discipline aims to train a man to do
a man's work in life. It should help
him to strike at the heart of world
problems for himself, guided by no
precedent. Tt enables him to act in
telligently where others are contented
with blind feeling. In the future of
Europe the transfer of its activities
from the control of the few to the
welfare of the many, the American
scholar may prove a leading or even
a determining factor.
But after all consideration of uni
versity organization and of Stanford's
participation in it, we come back to
our first proposition, ihe imperative
ness of personality. A university is
a human group. In the long run it is
what its teachers make it. Through
the resultant of all the influences that
go out from tlieni its personality is
developed. The personality of Stan
ford for these twenty-five years has
been a very friendly one. In the first
year, teachers and students lived to
gether in Eneina Hall, and when our
world and everybody in it was young,
sometimes one could hardly tell pro
fessors and students apart. The
schools of old Japan, they say, prided
themselves on the fact that the teach
ers were merely the elder scholars,
"sen-sei," they called them, "those
born before." It is moreover record
ed of these teachers, "They knew each
of us by name."
Such a condition existed in the
early days of Stanford. We as teach
ers seemed, to ourselves at least, not
much older than our students. In the
pioneer classes, we knew everyone by
name. Happily we know them still.
And while increasing numbers and the
unifying tendencies which beset every
student body have made it no longer
possible for each of us to know all of
you by name, the old habit remains.
We are still students too—only a bit
farther along. So when we meet in
the world outside, it is as friends and
fellows devoted to each other, to our
university, our nation and our ideals.
Women Temper "Stanford Spirit."
One large factor in the temper of
constructive friendliness which we
call "the Stanford spirit" comes from
the welcome presence of the Stanford
women. I remember well the feverish
haste in which Mrs. Stanford com
pleted Roble Hall between the middle
of June and the last day of September

twenty-five years ago. She said that
the women must be in at the very be
ginning, otherwise they would always
be considered as interlopers. They
should be at home at Stanford, and
from the very first day.
Whatever the future of the univer
sity, we hope that the spirit of mu
tual trust and mutual friendliness, so
potent in the early days, will always
abide here. Changes in organization
and development must come. We
trust that changes in spirit will ap
pear only as intensification.
Today we are mounting the brow
of the hill from which we look for
ward to the future as well as back
over the past. In material ways it
has been a rocky road, with perils of
litigation, financial crises, emergen
cies of earthquake and fire, misunder
standings sometimes within and with
out. But all these are left behind
and the great future opens out. We
stand, indeed, before the very Gate of
Hercules.
Progress Result of Unrest.
They say that the American univer
sity is now in a period of unrest. It
always is. Out of unrest flows pro
gress. All our institutions are in
process of change. Nothing has yet
permanent form. Straight ahead of
us at Stanford may be seen the sep
aration of the junior college. This
means the expansion of the higher
work, a more thorough training of
men "for direct usefulness in life"
than is involved in the conventional
college education. The hour for the
change need not be hastened. It will
hasten itself. The limitation in num
bers already forced upon us is a bid
for the best, a guarantee of the high
est possible service.
(■ranting of Diplomas a Privilege.
Today I look back over a long life
of teaching. 1 began it with the sole
ambition to become a naturalist, an
explorer, with an abounding passion
for geography as related to the life
of plants and animals and men. I had
never the slightest longing for execu
tive responsibility until circumstances
thrust this upon me. Rut T can see
that there is no experience in life, no
position of trust or honor, no field of
endeavor which 112 would have chosen
instead above what the fortunes of
life have assigned to me. Twenty
five years ago my colleague, President
Thwing of Western Reserve, wrote me
in congratulation, "T would rather be
President of Stanford University than
Emperor." So would I, and so would
1 again if I hart my life to live over.
Tt is the college president's func
tion not to govern, but to help; not
to rule, but to co-ordinate. His suc
cess rests on the devotion of the col
leagues with whom he surrounds
himself. With large risks and larger
trials, he has also unsurpassed op
portunities. He deals with a nation's
"youth of promise" and he meets
their parents on their best. side.
I am not unmindful of the generous
freedom accorded me by the Poard of
Trustees for the last three years with
the title of Chancellor. Put among
the experiences of my life, I count
this with the best, that nearly r>ooo
Stanford men and women have re
reived their diplomas from my hand.
To begin with, these young people
were choice spirits, else they would
never have gone to college, never
have come to Stanford University.
Here they have lived with Nature at
her best, and have "walked with
Henslows" of all types and degrees.
Finally, they have gone down "the
ppu.w atn o}m (I s.<ua\ api.w .inoj
ctich to do his nan in a brave and
reasonable way. I have met these
men and women in every state in the
Union, in London, in Germany, in
Australia, in Korea, in Japan. Some
little part, in the achievements of each
of them 1 claim for myself, a much
larger part 112 claim for my colleagues.
Leadership In Stanford Hands.
And this is our exceeding great
and unfailing reward, the only one we
ask, a grateful remembrance of our
work. Put not the least of our satis
faction in this hour lies in the cer
tainty that Stanford's leadership lies
in Stanford's hands. No stone of the
edifice we have builded during the

last twenty-five years need be rejected
in the foundation of the preater Stan
ford which is to come.
This day rounds out the first Quar
ter Century of Stanford University,
the best part of a lifetime for me and
for those of my colleagues who gath
ered around me in the early days.
This day I stand before you in some
sense as their spokesman and advo
cate. What account can we render of
our stewardship on the threshold of a
new cycle?
Speaking for myself, who have
been for forty-six years a teacher of
college men and women, I shall not
leave the fairest field of human effort
without profound emotion. But this
1 do not ask you to share. None of us
are here to stay, none of us would
halt, the procession. The old Rou
manian proverb, "Our blood goes over
into the veins of the young," we ac
cept without flinching. Young men
and young universities move faster
than old ones, and in this fact Stan
ford finds part of the secret of her
success.
Outlines Academic Ideal
Something of this success and the
elements which made it I shall try
to set before you today. I shall not
speak again of the founders' wisdom.
I have already on another occasion
recounted, largely in Mr. Stanford's
own words, his sane ideals of educa
tion and his generous plans for carry
ing them into effect. The story of the
six dark years, illuminated and saved
by the devoted loyalty of Mrs. Stan
ford, I have told at still another time
as well as I could. My present task
is to give you some account of the
principles embodied in the academic
life of the institution itself without
reference to particular individuals or
special events.
First of all, Stanford University had
for its basis a lofty moral and spir
itual purpose born of the fair hope
and the fi*ee hand which its founders
held out to us. Moreover, its roman
tic origin at once lifted it out of the
commonplace. Furthermore, as we
dreamed, it was not to duplicate old
successes or older failures, but was
to mark a new era, so we hoped, in
the training of men and women. In
a word, it was to bring the education
of tomorrow straight to the youth of
today.
Unhampered by Tradition
In those marvelous days of creative
opportunity, we were hampered by no
prearranged rule of action. No tra
dition from the old world or the new
laid on us its dead hand. As the
young president standing in the west
end of the Quadrangle proclaimed on
that eventful first day of October,
1891: "Our University has no history
to fall back upon. Xo memories of
great teachers haunt its corridors. In
none of its rooms appear the traces
which show where a great man has
lived and worked. No tender asso
ciations cling, ivy-like, to its fresh
new walls. It is hallowed by no tra
ditions. It is hampered by none. Its
finger posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow, as the
splendid lily from the modest bulb."
To be sure, we had then all the ex

perlence of the world to fall back
upon. But we were to draw our own
conclusions. Nothing forced us to use
it in any specified way. Any method
quantity was found in the ever-vary
ing traits of human nature. And on
the recognition of this infinite variety
our scheme was primarily based.
Every form of talent, we held, was
worthy of training. To develop
strength we must bring out person
ality. To this end we must first have
teachers adequate for their responsi
bilities. A university performs its
function not in what it compels, still
less in what it forbids, but in its pro
vision for intensifying the student's
best abilities.
Organization Second
Organization is a secondary thing.
It will come soon enough. Like age,
it creeps on us unawares. So the
fewer rules the better until rules make
themselves. Under the worst possible
organization, or none at all. great
teachers may do noble work, as the
history of learning clearly shows.
Wherever placed, the great man
leaves a mark on all with whom he
comes in contact. Professor Osborn
of Columbia once refered to the lie
lief that the American college, with
its happy-go-lucky lack of system,
could never produce a Darwin. In
opposition to this view, I claimed that
it could quite as readily as any other
system, given, of course, the raw ma
terial to work upon.
To my mind, in the making or a
great naturalist three things are
necessary: the original material, the
fine human stuff; next, contact with
nature; and finally, the help and ex
ample of a great teacher. These three
factors co-operated in the life of
Darwin. It is clear that Cambridge
and Edinburgh as schools of science,
did not make him. He himself bears
witness to the "incredible dullness"
of the lectures he heard. If that were
all, Stanford University could cer
tainly have done a better job.
Essentials of Greatness
But the first essential, the raw ma
terial, the choice mosaic of germ
plasm—this was already there to work
upon, and this no school could create.
The second element, contact with
nature—a free gift to all who seek it
—Darwin found on the moors of Cam
bridgeshire, by its brooks and its
bridges. In fullest measure, Califor
nia offers the same to all.
As to the third essential, the spell
of a great life, this Cambridge pro
vided. Darwin himself gives the clue.
He says that he "walked with liens
low," and Henslow was one of the
great botanists of bis time. To walk
with Henslow was in itself a gener
ous education. To make possible such
relations is the university's choicest
function. It should furnish the Hens
lows with whom the Darwins may
walk.
For the permanent values of a uni
versity center in its faculty. All the
virtues of mind and soul should be
theirs collectively, and as far as may
be, individually,—friendliness, self-de
votion, intellectual honesty, sincerity
I of purpose, love of work, strength to
; carry it on, accuracy, profundity,

broadmindedness, reverence, refine
ment, above all else, an unshaken and
unshakeable faith in human nature —
each one of these is vitally essential.
This may not all be detected in any
one man or woman, bat they must ap
pear in the composite whole.
Principles of Beginning
Nevertheless, whatever stress may
justly be laid on the personality of
teachers, one must not undervalue de
tails of organization. Traditions there
are that belittle, regulations that
starve or cramp, details that irritate,
and limitations that waste. A uni
versity should be framed for advance
ment. The chambers of its soul
should widen as the years go by.
Whatever bounds it imposes on itself
should be flexible and temporary.
Then as its life grows more complex,
it must frame certain rules of pro
cedure. The value of these rules will
rest on the principle that lies behind
them. Stanford was free to choose its
own educational principles. The four
most fundamental with which we
started were (a) the democracy of
mental powers, (b) the elective sys
tem, (c) the major department ar
rangement, and (d) the vital import
ance of individual initiative as the
prime element in character building.
With these, coeducation and the ap
plication of science were taken as mat
ters of course.
Aim of Quality Chosen
Negatively, we did not believe in
prescribed courses of study, in the
disciplinary value of undigested learn
ing, in promoting scholarship by pro
hibitions, by marks, honors, prizes, or
by financial subsidies as baits in
the educational trap. Furthermore, we
resolved that a university need not be
valued for its bigness, nor even for
the variety of its functions, believing
it better to do a few things well than
to strive weakly to cover the whole
ground of learning. For the ultimate
function of the endowed university
must be differentiated from that of the
state institution. It is the duty of
the latter to minister to all the higher
educational needs of the state. It is
the privilege of the former to set
standards of aim and standards of
achievement.
And further still, we conceived of
university life as an opportunity, to
be looked on as such by all who
came. Those who did not rise to its
stimulus were better somewhere else.
So because the chief source of human
wastage in our republic is the open
saloon, from the first we refused to
enter into rivalry with this, —or any
other institution that fattens on men's
weaknesses. The chains of a vile
habit inhibit wholesome development.
"Free should the scholar be, free and
brave."
Democracy of Mental Powers
Let us go bark to our four prin
ciples of organization, to consider
them in some detail. And here I must
ask the kind indulgence of all whose
fate it has been for a quarter of cen
tury to hear me expound in theory
and in practice the element of free
dom in education. That has been our
watchword. And because from the be

ginning we wished to emphasize the
value of intellectual freedom, of dis
cipline which is self-imposed, not
vouchsafed from above, we chose as
our academic motto the words of Ill
rich von Hutten, spoken four centur
ies ago, "Die Luft der Freheit weht,"
"The winds of freedom are blowing."
Democracy of the mind was the in
spiration of the early days of Cornell
University. Under its lead, we of the
pioneer clas-s of 1872 established our
first college journal. We called it
"The Cornell Era." For it truly
marked a new era in college history
when college men studied engineering
and agriculture along with Greek and
Latin, when even in a literary course
geology and botany might be counted
towards a degree. That such sub
jects could be accepted was the pri
mary reason why I myself went to
Cornell and not to Yale.
Democracy of the mind was not the
discovery of Andrew D. White, its
greatest apostle. No great idea orig
inates perhaps with any one person.
Hut at Cornell it was first developed
in workable fashion. It holds that
all mental powers should be recog
nized as free and equal, each alike
entitled to make the most of itself.
In this spirit, Ezra Cornell had said,
"I would found an institution in which
any person may find instruction in
any study." Indeed, it is not for the
university to foster any aristocracy of
studies. It shall not maintain Latin
or Greek or philosophy or physics, or
anything else, as a primary essential
in education, or that those whose
minds do not turn in some favored
direction shall be left uneducated. All
the powers of the mind, the applica
tion of knowledge as well as its ex
tension and preservation, are the sub
ject-matter of the university.
Elective System Adopted
Such a conception of higher educa
tion naturally finds its expression in
the elective system, which involves
the abandonment of the old idea in
volved in the word "curriculum" or
little race-course, with its low and
high hurdles, its "little go" and its
"great go," around which the student
moved for three or four years, return
ing at commencement for his final re
ward. The more tedious the discip
line, the greater was its supposed
value, and the reward for penance
done lay in the goodfellowship which
common boredom entailed. Under the
pressure of the widening of human
knowledge, the applications of sci
ence and the insistence of human
needs, the American college has
changed its theory in these regards.
The curriculum is no longer a race
course. Its participants do not run in
a circle, but set out in all directions
along widely divergent paths. For
the new appeal of widened helpful
ness has brought into the college new
and variant types of men, with variant
needs. Teachers brought up under the
old regime have generally ill under
stood how to deal with these. Mean
while the new appeal has brought new
popularities and it must be admitted
that many students are sent to the
universites because they have shown
no promise anywhere else.

Two Classes'of Students
College students in general may be
divided into two classes: those who
care and those who don't. Only the
first class need be considered. What
ever the needs of the others, their
place is not in the college. Students
who care may be again divided as to
the impulse, whether volitional or vo
cational, which compels their interest.
The best students in each field are
those who work for the love of it.
They may be classical scholars,
"Greek-minded men or Roman-minded
men," to use Emerson's phrase, or
they may be botanists, anatomists,
physiologists, chemists, teachers, phil
ologists, historians, engineers, econ
omists, physicians or jurists. They
may spring up in any field, and they
work to the limit for the mere joy of
working. The investigators of the
world, those who widen the scope of
knowledge in an appreciable degree,
belong to this class. Every door
should be held wide open for them,
and not one of them should be com
pelled to turn out of his way by the
lure of a.degree.
The vocational impulse has also its
place in the higher training. It may
express itself in perseverance rather
than in enthusiasm. A man will stick
to an uninteresting topic if he can
relate it to the affairs of life. An in
telligent student will always recognize
vocational reasons for pushing onward
to success. This is why the engineer
ing students in our universities are,
broadly speaking, better scholars than
students of literature. They see that
their future depends absolutely on
preparation. They are to deal with
the forces of nature, and nature
brooks no ignorance or deception..
They say at Harvard, "One is a fool
to study in the college; one is a fool
not to study in the law school." It
is a matter of common observation
that in professional schools of high
standards even the idler and the
dilettante may suddenly rise to hon
est work.
Joy in Vocational Training
It is, therefore, not a forward move
ment, for colleges and universities to
turn away from vocational studies in
the interest of pure culture. The vo
cation. however, must not be narrow
ly construed, as a man of force in any
field needs as wide a horizon as the
university can give him. No effort is
wasted if undertaken conscientiously
and with the purpose of adding found
ation on which one's specialty may
rest. Hut without volitional or voca
tional relations, without joy in the
work or hope in its final completion,
a boy would better keep out of col
lege and turn his attention as soon as
possible to something which to him is
real.
In the beginning Stanford Univer
sity adopted the elective system with
open eyes, certain that no other one
made possible the best scholarship.
The old classical course has not
broken down under the pressure of
live subjects and live issues. It rested
on the noble basis of Greek thought
and Greek expression. Its ideal look-
ed backward and upward to the loft
iest achievements of the human race
in the matter of beauty of form, of
language and of thought. As Thoreau
once observed, "Those only talk of
forgetting Greek who never knew it."
To the "Greek-minded man" these four
years in academic shades in company
with gracious thoughts were most sat
isfying and enlarging.
Hut the course was narrow and
special, and some thirty years ago it
began to give place to that condition
of affairs which I have elsewhere
called the "patchwork" stage of the
curriculum. The expansion of the
natural and physical sciences, each
one changing the whole current of
thought in its field; the demands of
French and German literature; a new
attitude towards the movements of
history; the growth of economics, jur
isprudence, modern philosophy, not
safe nor sane perhaps, but drawn
from the study of things as they are,
—all these, one by one or altogether,
clamored for a place in college
courses. Slowly, grudgingly, all were
admitted, crowding out, in greater or
less measure, Greek, calculus and
Latin. Each new subject, like the
camel with its head under the tent,
moved forward to occupy. Each sub
ject, old and new, was squeezed to
the briefest possible compass, though
the new ones were no more compre
hensible than the old. It was clear
before long that not all could be
brought into one uniform course. To
that end several arrangements were
devised, in each of which some edu
cational faction should have its way
But these ill adjusted and shifting
courses were necessarily less special
ized and therefore less thorough than
the old classical one, and as ad
vanced work in one subject has a
greater cultural value than elementary
work in several, so in almost every
regard the patchwork system marked
a step downward.
This period, however, was only one
of transition, and led directly to the
elective system, which made thorough
ness possible in any one of many
lines. In a prescribed course the stu
dent has little or no choice, and yet
the element of choice is in itself a
leading factor in individual training.
A democratic institution should min
ister to all types of men in quest of
higher education. It matters not
through what agency the miracle is
wrought. It may be achieved through
the melting of vanadium steel or by
a study of the satires of Horace.
The structure of the cell-nucleus of
a tadpole is as intricate and may be
as fascinating as that of the British
constitution, or a drama of Euripides.
Under the elective system it is pos
sible for a teacher to do his finest
work. No longer occupied with "the
dregs of learning," as Agassiz once
termed the college course at Harvard,
he can lead the learner and thus lead
himself to the firing lines of science.
With students in earnest, advanced
and thorough work becomes possible.
Such students give the teacher new
life.
Elective System Marks New Growth.
With the enlarged usefulness which
marked the advent of the elective sys
tem twenty to thirty years ago, began
the new growth of the colleges. They
drew men of new kinds, and many
more of them than ever before. This
fresh impulse was dominant in the
early days of Stanford, and a like
stimulus soon gave new life to the
whole university world. Ready-made
courses, the acme of pedagogic lazi
ness, were discarded. Like ready
made clothing, such courses really fit
nobody, and an education, like a suit
of clothes, should be fitted to the man
who is to wear it.
Some criticisms still apply to the
elective system. It has not yet wholly
eliminated "the reluctant student."
Hut can any system do this? No plan
ever made a lazy man brilliant. It is
to the earnest and efficient that the
opportunities of college life should be
granted. As a rule, students do not
elect the easiest studies and those
who do soon find their enjoyments
elsewhere.
Further, we are told that the elec

tive system offers temptations to un
due or premature specialization. This
also is true, and premature specializa
tion, like other forms of precocious
virtue, is to be deprecated. But ex
perience does not show that the
danger of "undue specialization" is a
serious one. The current, in college
and out, mostly sets the other way.
The fact that a man ventures to spec
ialize at all, shows that he has a cer
tain independence of character for the
odds are against it. Specialization im
plies thoroughness. It gives to each
man a base-line by which he can
measure the attainments of others.
No knowledge comes amiss to an in
vestigator; but no investigator can af
ford to sacrifice his specialty for the
sake of breadth. Thoroughness is the
main point, and should take preced
ence over versatility. 1 do not advo
cate narrowness of sympathy or nar
rowness of culture. The broadest ed
ucation is none too broad for the
growing scholar in any field. But the
forces of the mind should not be scat
tered in guerilla bands, but marshalled
toward leadership.
Major Department Arrangement.
Recognizing the conditions from the
very first, Stanford attempted to
strengthen and support the principle
of election in studies by means of the
major department arrangement. This
plan as we know it at Stanford and
as more or less developed in several
other universities, among them Har
vard, was forshadowed in these words
of Agassiz to his students in 1873:
"A specialty is the backbone of edu
cation. The mind is made strong by
the thorough possession of some
thing."
The final test of the elective system
must be found in its results. What
sort of man does it produce? What
is its relation to the discipline neces
sary to effectiveness in life? Dis
cipline means self-control, the power
to subordinate personal interest to the
larger needs of societies or nations,
the power to co-operate with other
men in the accomplishment of worthy
results. In this matter our people
tend to undervalue our actual achieve
ments, for too often uniformity is
mistaken for discipline. Unques
tioned obedience is not discipline.
Real discipline involves response
with head and heart to the dictates
of individual conscience, the "cate
gorical imperative" as set forth by
Immanuel Kant-. The uncritical sub
mission now shown by the masses
in Central Europe stands in exact
opposition to the dictum of the great
philosopher.
The output of our colleges has not
the uniformity for which Europe has
striven. Much that Europe values,
justly or not, we have neglected in
the interest of newer and sometimes
weightier demands. Substance is
more important than polish, and in
itiative outweighs all other forms of
efficiency. It is our highest aim in
America to grant not merely a lib
eral education, but, to borrow a word
from Dr. Peabody, a "liberating edu
cation," which shall fit a man to meet
unforseen demands.
Pledged To Personal Inithitive.
Democratic discipline and paternal
discipline lie at opposite poles in
national development. Each has its
defenders in our republic as else
where. But as a nation we stand
pledged to the discipline that evolves
from within and rests on personal
initiative. Its results are unequal,
but in the long run it is more effic
ient as an impulse in individual or
social life. We work under orders as
before, but not sealed orders. The
true American belongs to a political
party or a religious organization, not
to take direction from it, but to use
it for purposes which he shares with
the group. To him the party or or
ganization is a means towards indi
vidual or social ends, not an end in
itself. In our higher education as in
our political affairs, we have rejected
paternal dictation. From the dis
cipline self-imposed arises a form of
social discipline, unselfish devotion to
a common cause, characteristic of a
land of undivided freedom. The
highest patriotism, the patriotism of
humanity, cannot develop in a people

whose every man is a patient cog in
the wheels of a social, industrial or
military machine.
Appreciation of College >lenin War.
In a discussion of the affairs of
Belgium, Professor Vernon L. Kellogg
makes this reference to the work of
these students: "There are many
other bits that might be told. Only
one shall I add. It is a word of ap
preciation of the young Americans—
I am an old one—who offered their
services and performed their work in
a way to bring warmth to the heart
and mist to the eyes of a believer in
our country and its way of producing
men. Most of these helpers—a few
more than seventy Americans have
been so far in the service—are young
college men, a considerable fraction
of them.being Rhodes scholars from
the various Oxford colleges. Trained
in college for anything but the specific
work of the commission, they seem
to have found a training that, added
to a natural initiative, has made them
capable actors in the world's work.
Thrown into a situation requiring tact
and utmost discretion, loaded with
large responsibilities and asked to
take care of themselves and import
ant affairs of the commission under
most unusual circumstances, they
have done it, almost to a man, with
success. They have won the admira
tion of the Belgians and Germans
alike. They make one proud of
America and they lend great encour
agement to an observer of American
educational methods. Viewed in their
workings, these methods have seemed
to many of us very faulty; viewed in
their results, so far as young America
is a result of education at all, our too
easy pessimism is given a proper un
settling. I return to my university
chair with renewed confidence in
American educational work."
Man Trained for Man's Work.
The democratic type of educational
discipline aims to train a man to do
a man's work in life. It should help
him to strike at the heart of world
problems for himself, guided by no
precedent. Tt enables him to act in
telligently where others are contented
with blind feeling. In the future of
Europe the transfer of its activities
from the control of the few to the
welfare of the many, the American
scholar may prove a leading or even
a determining factor.
But after all consideration of uni
versity organization and of Stanford's
participation in it, we come back to
our first proposition, ihe imperative
ness of personality. A university is
a human group. In the long run it is
what its teachers make it. Through
the resultant of all the influences that
go out from tlieni its personality is
developed. The personality of Stan
ford for these twenty-five years has
been a very friendly one. In the first
year, teachers and students lived to
gether in Eneina Hall, and when our
world and everybody in it was young,
sometimes one could hardly tell pro
fessors and students apart. The
schools of old Japan, they say, prided
themselves on the fact that the teach
ers were merely the elder scholars,
"sen-sei," they called them, "those
born before." It is moreover record
ed of these teachers, "They knew each
of us by name."
Such a condition existed in the
early days of Stanford. We as teach
ers seemed, to ourselves at least, not
much older than our students. In the
pioneer classes, we knew everyone by
name. Happily we know them still.
And while increasing numbers and the
unifying tendencies which beset every
student body have made it no longer
possible for each of us to know all of
you by name, the old habit remains.
We are still students too—only a bit
farther along. So when we meet in
the world outside, it is as friends and
fellows devoted to each other, to our
university, our nation and our ideals.
Women Temper "Stanford Spirit."
One large factor in the temper of
constructive friendliness which we
call "the Stanford spirit" comes from
the welcome presence of the Stanford
women. I remember well the feverish
haste in which Mrs. Stanford com
pleted Roble Hall between the middle
of June and the last day of September

twenty-five years ago. She said that
the women must be in at the very be
ginning, otherwise they would always
be considered as interlopers. They
should be at home at Stanford, and
from the very first day.
Whatever the future of the univer
sity, we hope that the spirit of mu
tual trust and mutual friendliness, so
potent in the early days, will always
abide here. Changes in organization
and development must come. We
trust that changes in spirit will ap
pear only as intensification.
Today we are mounting the brow
of the hill from which we look for
ward to the future as well as back
over the past. In material ways it
has been a rocky road, with perils of
litigation, financial crises, emergen
cies of earthquake and fire, misunder
standings sometimes within and with
out. But all these are left behind
and the great future opens out. We
stand, indeed, before the very Gate of
Hercules.
Progress Result of Unrest.
They say that the American univer
sity is now in a period of unrest. It
always is. Out of unrest flows pro
gress. All our institutions are in
process of change. Nothing has yet
permanent form. Straight ahead of
us at Stanford may be seen the sep
aration of the junior college. This
means the expansion of the higher
work, a more thorough training of
men "for direct usefulness in life"
than is involved in the conventional
college education. The hour for the
change need not be hastened. It will
hasten itself. The limitation in num
bers already forced upon us is a bid
for the best, a guarantee of the high
est possible service.
(■ranting of Diplomas a Privilege.
Today I look back over a long life
of teaching. 1 began it with the sole
ambition to become a naturalist, an
explorer, with an abounding passion
for geography as related to the life
of plants and animals and men. I had
never the slightest longing for execu
tive responsibility until circumstances
thrust this upon me. Rut T can see
that there is no experience in life, no
position of trust or honor, no field of
endeavor which 112 would have chosen
instead above what the fortunes of
life have assigned to me. Twenty
five years ago my colleague, President
Thwing of Western Reserve, wrote me
in congratulation, "T would rather be
President of Stanford University than
Emperor." So would I, and so would
1 again if I hart my life to live over.
Tt is the college president's func
tion not to govern, but to help; not
to rule, but to co-ordinate. His suc
cess rests on the devotion of the col
leagues with whom he surrounds
himself. With large risks and larger
trials, he has also unsurpassed op
portunities. He deals with a nation's
"youth of promise" and he meets
their parents on their best. side.
I am not unmindful of the generous
freedom accorded me by the Poard of
Trustees for the last three years with
the title of Chancellor. Put among
the experiences of my life, I count
this with the best, that nearly r>ooo
Stanford men and women have re
reived their diplomas from my hand.
To begin with, these young people
were choice spirits, else they would
never have gone to college, never
have come to Stanford University.
Here they have lived with Nature at
her best, and have "walked with
Henslows" of all types and degrees.
Finally, they have gone down "the
ppu.w atn o}m (I s.<ua\ api.w .inoj
ctich to do his nan in a brave and
reasonable way. I have met these
men and women in every state in the
Union, in London, in Germany, in
Australia, in Korea, in Japan. Some
little part, in the achievements of each
of them 1 claim for myself, a much
larger part 112 claim for my colleagues.
Leadership In Stanford Hands.
And this is our exceeding great
and unfailing reward, the only one we
ask, a grateful remembrance of our
work. Put not the least of our satis
faction in this hour lies in the cer
tainty that Stanford's leadership lies
in Stanford's hands. No stone of the
edifice we have builded during the

last twenty-five years need be rejected
in the foundation of the preater Stan
ford which is to come.
