# DR. JORDAN OUTLINES PRINCIPLES OF ACADEMIC LIFE
## Records Stanford's Success in Bringing the Education of Tomorrow to the Youth of Today by Uniting Essentials of Darwin 
### Chancellor David Starr Jordan 
This day rounds out the first Quar
ter Century of Stanford University,
the best part of a lifetime for me and
for those of my colleagues who gath
ered around me in the early days.
This day I stand before you in some
sense as their spokesman and advo
cate. What account can we render of
our stewardship on the threshold of a
new cycle?
Speaking for myself, who have
been for forty-six years a teacher of
college men and women, I shall not
leave the fairest field of human effort
without profound emotion. But this
1 do not ask you to share. None of us
are here to stay, none of us would
halt, the procession. The old Rou
manian proverb, "Our blood goes over
into the veins of the young," we ac
cept without flinching. Young men
and young universities move faster
than old ones, and in this fact Stan
ford finds part of the secret of her
success.
Outlines Academic Ideal
Something of this success and the
elements which made it I shall try
to set before you today. I shall not
speak again of the founders' wisdom.
I have already on another occasion
recounted, largely in Mr. Stanford's
own words, his sane ideals of educa
tion and his generous plans for carry
ing them into effect. The story of the
six dark years, illuminated and saved
by the devoted loyalty of Mrs. Stan
ford, I have told at still another time
as well as I could. My present task
is to give you some account of the
principles embodied in the academic
life of the institution itself without
reference to particular individuals or
special events.
First of all, Stanford University had
for its basis a lofty moral and spir
itual purpose born of the fair hope
and the fi*ee hand which its founders
held out to us. Moreover, its roman
tic origin at once lifted it out of the
commonplace. Furthermore, as we
dreamed, it was not to duplicate old
successes or older failures, but was
to mark a new era, so we hoped, in
the training of men and women. In
a word, it was to bring the education
of tomorrow straight to the youth of
today.
Unhampered by Tradition
In those marvelous days of creative
opportunity, we were hampered by no
prearranged rule of action. No tra
dition from the old world or the new
laid on us its dead hand. As the
young president standing in the west
end of the Quadrangle proclaimed on
that eventful first day of October,
1891: "Our University has no history
to fall back upon. Xo memories of
great teachers haunt its corridors. In
none of its rooms appear the traces
which show where a great man has
lived and worked. No tender asso
ciations cling, ivy-like, to its fresh
new walls. It is hallowed by no tra
ditions. It is hampered by none. Its
finger posts still point forward. Tra
ditions and associations it is ours to
make. From our work the future of
the University will grow, as the
splendid lily from the modest bulb."
To be sure, we had then all the ex

perlence of the world to fall back
upon. But we were to draw our own
conclusions. Nothing forced us to use
it in any specified way. Any method
quantity was found in the ever-vary
ing traits of human nature. And on
the recognition of this infinite variety
our scheme was primarily based.
Every form of talent, we held, was
worthy of training. To develop
strength we must bring out person
ality. To this end we must first have
teachers adequate for their responsi
bilities. A university performs its
function not in what it compels, still
less in what it forbids, but in its pro
vision for intensifying the student's
best abilities.
Organization Second
Organization is a secondary thing.
It will come soon enough. Like age,
it creeps on us unawares. So the
fewer rules the better until rules make
themselves. Under the worst possible
organization, or none at all. great
teachers may do noble work, as the
history of learning clearly shows.
Wherever placed, the great man
leaves a mark on all with whom he
comes in contact. Professor Osborn
of Columbia once refered to the lie
lief that the American college, with
its happy-go-lucky lack of system,
could never produce a Darwin. In
opposition to this view, I claimed that
it could quite as readily as any other
system, given, of course, the raw ma
terial to work upon.
To my mind, in the making or a
great naturalist three things are
necessary: the original material, the
fine human stuff; next, contact with
nature; and finally, the help and ex
ample of a great teacher. These three
factors co-operated in the life of
Darwin. It is clear that Cambridge
and Edinburgh as schools of science,
did not make him. He himself bears
witness to the "incredible dullness"
of the lectures he heard. If that were
all, Stanford University could cer
tainly have done a better job.
Essentials of Greatness
But the first essential, the raw ma
terial, the choice mosaic of germ
plasm—this was already there to work
upon, and this no school could create.
The second element, contact with
nature—a free gift to all who seek it
—Darwin found on the moors of Cam
bridgeshire, by its brooks and its
bridges. In fullest measure, Califor
nia offers the same to all.
As to the third essential, the spell
of a great life, this Cambridge pro
vided. Darwin himself gives the clue.
He says that he "walked with liens
low," and Henslow was one of the
great botanists of bis time. To walk
with Henslow was in itself a gener
ous education. To make possible such
relations is the university's choicest
function. It should furnish the Hens
lows with whom the Darwins may
walk.
For the permanent values of a uni
versity center in its faculty. All the
virtues of mind and soul should be
theirs collectively, and as far as may
be, individually,—friendliness, self-de
votion, intellectual honesty, sincerity
I of purpose, love of work, strength to
; carry it on, accuracy, profundity,

broadmindedness, reverence, refine
ment, above all else, an unshaken and
unshakeable faith in human nature —
each one of these is vitally essential.
This may not all be detected in any
one man or woman, bat they must ap
pear in the composite whole.
Principles of Beginning
Nevertheless, whatever stress may
justly be laid on the personality of
teachers, one must not undervalue de
tails of organization. Traditions there
are that belittle, regulations that
starve or cramp, details that irritate,
and limitations that waste. A uni
versity should be framed for advance
ment. The chambers of its soul
should widen as the years go by.
Whatever bounds it imposes on itself
should be flexible and temporary.
Then as its life grows more complex,
it must frame certain rules of pro
cedure. The value of these rules will
rest on the principle that lies behind
them. Stanford was free to choose its
own educational principles. The four
most fundamental with which we
started were (a) the democracy of
mental powers, (b) the elective sys
tem, (c) the major department ar
rangement, and (d) the vital import
ance of individual initiative as the
prime element in character building.
With these, coeducation and the ap
plication of science were taken as mat
ters of course.
Aim of Quality Chosen
Negatively, we did not believe in
prescribed courses of study, in the
disciplinary value of undigested learn
ing, in promoting scholarship by pro
hibitions, by marks, honors, prizes, or
by financial subsidies as baits in
the educational trap. Furthermore, we
resolved that a university need not be
valued for its bigness, nor even for
the variety of its functions, believing
it better to do a few things well than
to strive weakly to cover the whole
ground of learning. For the ultimate
function of the endowed university
must be differentiated from that of the
state institution. It is the duty of
the latter to minister to all the higher
educational needs of the state. It is
the privilege of the former to set
standards of aim and standards of
achievement.
And further still, we conceived of
university life as an opportunity, to
be looked on as such by all who
came. Those who did not rise to its
stimulus were better somewhere else.
So because the chief source of human
wastage in our republic is the open
saloon, from the first we refused to
enter into rivalry with this, —or any
other institution that fattens on men's
weaknesses. The chains of a vile
habit inhibit wholesome development.
"Free should the scholar be, free and
brave."
Democracy of Mental Powers
Let us go bark to our four prin
ciples of organization, to consider
them in some detail. And here I must
ask the kind indulgence of all whose
fate it has been for a quarter of cen
tury to hear me expound in theory
and in practice the element of free
dom in education. That has been our
watchword. And because from the be

ginning we wished to emphasize the
value of intellectual freedom, of dis
cipline which is self-imposed, not
vouchsafed from above, we chose as
our academic motto the words of Ill
rich von Hutten, spoken four centur
ies ago, "Die Luft der Freheit weht,"
"The winds of freedom are blowing."
Democracy of the mind was the in
spiration of the early days of Cornell
University. Under its lead, we of the
pioneer clas-s of 1872 established our
first college journal. We called it
"The Cornell Era." For it truly
marked a new era in college history
when college men studied engineering
and agriculture along with Greek and
Latin, when even in a literary course
geology and botany might be counted
towards a degree. That such sub
jects could be accepted was the pri
mary reason why I myself went to
Cornell and not to Yale.
Democracy of the mind was not the
discovery of Andrew D. White, its
greatest apostle. No great idea orig
inates perhaps with any one person.
Hut at Cornell it was first developed
in workable fashion. It holds that
all mental powers should be recog
nized as free and equal, each alike
entitled to make the most of itself.
In this spirit, Ezra Cornell had said,
"I would found an institution in which
any person may find instruction in
any study." Indeed, it is not for the
university to foster any aristocracy of
studies. It shall not maintain Latin
or Greek or philosophy or physics, or
anything else, as a primary essential
in education, or that those whose
minds do not turn in some favored
direction shall be left uneducated. All
the powers of the mind, the applica
tion of knowledge as well as its ex
tension and preservation, are the sub
ject-matter of the university.
Elective System Adopted
Such a conception of higher educa
tion naturally finds its expression in
the elective system, which involves
the abandonment of the old idea in
volved in the word "curriculum" or
little race-course, with its low and
high hurdles, its "little go" and its
"great go," around which the student
moved for three or four years, return
ing at commencement for his final re
ward. The more tedious the discip
line, the greater was its supposed
value, and the reward for penance
done lay in the goodfellowship which
common boredom entailed. Under the
pressure of the widening of human
knowledge, the applications of sci
ence and the insistence of human
needs, the American college has
changed its theory in these regards.
The curriculum is no longer a race
course. Its participants do not run in
a circle, but set out in all directions
along widely divergent paths. For
the new appeal of widened helpful
ness has brought into the college new
and variant types of men, with variant
needs. Teachers brought up under the
old regime have generally ill under
stood how to deal with these. Mean
while the new appeal has brought new
popularities and it must be admitted
that many students are sent to the
universites because they have shown
no promise anywhere else.

Two Classes'of Students
College students in general may be
divided into two classes: those who
care and those who don't. Only the
first class need be considered. What
ever the needs of the others, their
place is not in the college. Students
who care may be again divided as to
the impulse, whether volitional or vo
cational, which compels their interest.
The best students in each field are
those who work for the love of it.
They may be classical scholars,
"Greek-minded men or Roman-minded
men," to use Emerson's phrase, or
they may be botanists, anatomists,
physiologists, chemists, teachers, phil
ologists, historians, engineers, econ
omists, physicians or jurists. They
may spring up in any field, and they
work to the limit for the mere joy of
working. The investigators of the
world, those who widen the scope of
knowledge in an appreciable degree,
belong to this class. Every door
should be held wide open for them,
and not one of them should be com
pelled to turn out of his way by the
lure of a.degree.
The vocational impulse has also its
place in the higher training. It may
express itself in perseverance rather
than in enthusiasm. A man will stick
to an uninteresting topic if he can
relate it to the affairs of life. An in
telligent student will always recognize
vocational reasons for pushing onward
to success. This is why the engineer
ing students in our universities are,
broadly speaking, better scholars than
students of literature. They see that
their future depends absolutely on
preparation. They are to deal with
the forces of nature, and nature
brooks no ignorance or deception..
They say at Harvard, "One is a fool
to study in the college; one is a fool
not to study in the law school." It
is a matter of common observation
that in professional schools of high
standards even the idler and the
dilettante may suddenly rise to hon
est work.
Joy in Vocational Training
It is, therefore, not a forward move
ment, for colleges and universities to
turn away from vocational studies in
the interest of pure culture. The vo
cation. however, must not be narrow
ly construed, as a man of force in any
field needs as wide a horizon as the
university can give him. No effort is
wasted if undertaken conscientiously
and with the purpose of adding found
ation on which one's specialty may
rest. Hut without volitional or voca
tional relations, without joy in the
work or hope in its final completion,
a boy would better keep out of col
lege and turn his attention as soon as
possible to something which to him is
real.
In the beginning Stanford Univer
sity adopted the elective system with
open eyes, certain that no other one
made possible the best scholarship.
The old classical course has not
broken down under the pressure of
live subjects and live issues. It rested
on the noble basis of Greek thought
and Greek expression. Its ideal look-
