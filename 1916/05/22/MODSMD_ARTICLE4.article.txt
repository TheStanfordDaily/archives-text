# VARIED PROGRAM FOR CLASS DAY EXERCISES
## PLATE IS DEDICATED E.R. Beal Receives Care of Mausoleum as Junior Representative 
### 
Class Day, celebrated by the mem
bers of the 1916 class last Friday,
was marked both by light entertain
ment and impressive exercises. Dedi
cation of the Memorial Plate, class
exercises, the Prom, and Dr. and Mrs.
Wilbur's reception to the seniors,
were the features of the day. Fol
lowing the meeting of the academic
council in the morning, the seniors,
dressed in caps and gowns, met on
the lawn in front of the Quadrangle
for the annual class day program. In
the opening exercises Class President
W. F. Noonan recounted briefly the
work of the out-going class. The
clas history, class will, and class or
ation were then given by C. W. Hatch,
W. P. Staniford, and A. H. Morosco,
respectively.
Following the class exercises, 191(5
dedicated one more numeral plate to
the University. The addition of the
'10 bronze plate makes a total of
twenty-two numerals that now guard
the records of Stanford's classes.
Later in the morning, the 1916 class
relinquished to 1917 the care of Maus
oleum. A. S. Hayes and Miss Alice
Butcher turned over the honor to E.
It. Heal, the representative of the
Juniors.
In his speech in dedication of the
Class Plate, A. H. Morosco, the class
orator, spoke in part as follows:
"So we have come to the end —
out in the wind and rain. Fellow
members of the class of 'I(!—we have
passed the foothills and the mountains
are in sight. You are going out into
the world, which, despite his faults
and shortcomings, offers a glorious
possibility; but it remains true that
no one of our people can do any work
really worth while unless he does it
primarily as an American. Our sol
diers, our statesmen, our orators, our
wilderness winners, our common
wealth builders, the men who have
made our laws and seen them ex
ecuted —all these have drawn wisdom
and experience from every age and
nation; but nevertheless have thought
and worked and conquered purely as
Americans.
"Dr. Wilbur—in behalf of the class
of 1916 I wish to express to you our
deepest gratitude. To Dr. Jordan and
Dr. Branner —all those who have
fathered us in our college existence
from babyhood until today we stand
at our majority—we thank you that
you have made this day possible. To
the Board of Trustees likewise we
extend our thanks, and bow in rever
ence to the Founders. And to the
last parting act we leave this plate
to you. And as we go forth from
the 'red tiled principality' we pledge
to you our loyalty and faith —we go
forth in the firm belief that our Alma
Mater is in the hands of men of
strength and vision.
"And to you, fellow classmates —
'quit yourselves like men' —yours has
been the abundant life —justify it."
President Wilbur spoke in response
to Morosco's address, and recounted
the history of the first class plate,
that of the '9G class, of which Dr.
Jordan was president.
