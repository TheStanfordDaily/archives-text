And there will be eats! 'Nuff said.
And there will be decorations,
There will be music, the kind that
I. C. Perkins's seven-piece orchestra

And there will be fun, the kind of
fun that lingers long in the memory,
for the fun will be of the variety that
is tinctured with the "last time"
thoughts of the Seniors, the "old time"
thoughts of those who have come back
for the occasion, and the "first time"
thoughts of the younger generation.
