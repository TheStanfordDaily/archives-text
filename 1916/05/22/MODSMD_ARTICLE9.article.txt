# "PAIR OF SIXES" GETS FULL HOUSE
## Players Score Heavily With Aid of Coach Mathieu 
### Otis Castle, '14 
1916 held A Pair of Sixes and drew
a Full House.
Hut as you say, Mehitabel, allusions
to poker—especially puns!—have no
place in college journalism. So let us
try literchoor:
"Care to our Coffin adds a Nail, no
doubt,
And every grin, so merry, draws one
out."
A number of local coffins were rend
ered totally insecure by the farce of
Wednesday evening. Which is to say
that "A Pair of Sixes" achieved its ob
ject. It entertained, and royally.
In the first place, it was a happy
selection. Peple's play may not go
down in the history of farce classics
by tiie side of "Charley's Aunt." Yet
it was a good, clean, mile-a-minute
comedy, with the requisite amount of
plot, sufficient clever lines, and a
plentitude of mirth provoking situa
tions.
The play was good, and the Stan
ford players put it over big. Their
acting was increasingly excellent as
the performance progressed. At the
very first a little nervousness was
evidenced; cues were occasionally
fumbled or slowly taken up, and the
true farce "pace" was not quite hit.
Hut these faults, inevitable in any
amateur work and especially in a play
prepared during the stress and storm
of Stanford examination-week, were
notably absent in the later scenes.
Ileing a non-professional production,
it goes without saying that there were
technical faults. Some actors masked
their expressions with gestures in
front of the body; others played to the
stage and not to the audience; and in
tlie second act some scenes were lost
to those in front of the house by being
played behind the large settee. Such
things are essentially minor; the play
goes in the front rank of Senior
farces, and it tickled a large and
mighty enthusiastic audience. Fur

ther, it justified the laurels already
awarded to some Stanford actors; and
there appeared in the heavens certain
new and very bright stars.
One of those is Miss Florence
Mason. She is not entirely new to our
stage; but on Wednesday evening she
found herself as an actress. Not only
does she make a very appealing hero
ine and act with skill, but she ex
hibited real talent in the reading of
her lines. Using a manner of speech
as natural as that which she might
employ on the Quad, she yet man
ages to indicate a complex of ideas,
hidden meanings, hopes, fears. And
the best thing about Miss Mason is
that she has undoubtedly not yet done
her best work. In all future plays for
which she is eligible we are assured
of an excellent actress for leading or
ingenue roles.
As Mrs. Nettleton, Miss Josephine
Welch had one of the most exacting
and unsympathetic parts in the produc
tion. The fact that she carried it in
an entirely acceptable manner is then
so much the more to her credit. In
conception and execution her por
trayal of the jealous but good-hearted
young matron addicted to fake hys
terics was one of the successes of the
evening.
The work of Muss Thurlyne Buffum
as Coddles was a bright part of the
production. The parlor maid, the
kitchen maid, and their English
cousin, the " 'twennie," are the stock
characters of farce. Endowed by the
costumer and the make-up man with
large flat shoes, pig tails, and a face
that only a mother could love, many
an actress has convulsed the gallery in
such roles. So Peple dragged Coddles
into his manuscript simply by the 'air
of 'er' ead. Rut Miss Buffum made
us thank him for doing it. Her skill
ful acting as she portrayed the unc
tuous solicitude of Coddles for the
state of Mr. Hoggs' heart was side-
