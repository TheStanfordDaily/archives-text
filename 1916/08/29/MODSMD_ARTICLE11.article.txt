# POSTER FIGHT TO APPEAR IN STRANGE GARB
## STRIPPING UNDER BAN Conference Members Will Be on Hand to Watch Wednesday Night's Rivalry 
### 
Refereed almost as thoroughly as
(lie annual underclass tie-ups of the
past, the freshman-sophomore poster
fight will appear this time in an en
tirely new garb. Instead of an open
"game" season extending over a per
iod of four or five days, but one short
twelve hour period will be allowed
the sophomores to make men of their
new friends the freshmen. During
these twelve hours all members of
the student conference and ten addi
tional upperclassmen will be "011 the
job" in order to see that all factions
are given a square deal.
Conference .>len in Squads,
At a meeting of the Conference this
afternoon the members of the gov
erning body divided themselves into
squads which will watch campus ac
tivities during the open season, which
will extend from 4:30 tomorrow af
ternoon until 4:30 Thursday morning.
The ban has been placed on stripping,
that activity which enjoyed unusual
popularity last fall. Choking and
slugging have also met with the dis
approval of the conference.
Sophomores will be given detailed
information in regard to the new
rules and regulations at a meeting to
be held in room 214 at 1:10 tomorrow
afternoon. Student Hody President
T. E. Swigart, '17, Conference Presi
dent J. W. Templeton, '17, and Stu
dent Adviser Paul Staniford, '16, will
address the nineteeners in regard to
what they can and cannot do during
the rush and tie-up.
Freshmen Meet at 1:45.
Freshmen, members of Stanford
1920, will meet for the first time in
room 214 at 1:45, immediately follow
ing the sophomoric session. They
will be addressed by the same student
officers, and will be given additional
information about the workings of
student government. Every freshman
is expected to be on hand at this
meeting, which will serve as his chief
aid in "getting on the boat" about
the activities of the first week of the
semester.
