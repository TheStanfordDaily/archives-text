ham's fast team, the Stanford men
played nine scheduled matches in six
states, g*avo three exhibitions, and
travelled from Stanford to Boston and
hack to New York. So close was the
schedule that the team remained at
some of the colleges only long enough
to play off the games. At Utah, for
instance, the men arrived at 3 o'clock
in the afternoon, and left on the 5
o'clock train for Colorado. At sev
eral other places the stay was under
four hours.

7-5, before Johns settled the affair.
