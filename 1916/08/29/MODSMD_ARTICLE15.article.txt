Once again tell-tale sounds, be
speaking a rolling press, spiced with
spasmodic tappings and jinglings of
typewriters and linotype machines,
call to mind that the opportune
moment has arrived for pouring forth
ardent words in the form of a decla
ration of policies. In the past we
have always regarded such a task a
riddle indissoluble, and the opinion
remains, since the direction of any
editorial pendulum can not be fore
told. Yet there remains one policy,
or rather custom, quite common and
attractive, namely, straddling that
much worn wooden fence —from
which a departure is now politely
sought. Easy riding is found on the
crest of the wave of public opinion
in an effort to safely avoid the un
pleasant complications of the troughs,
but occasionally it will not be to our
liking. So friends, when in the future
The Daily Palo Alto turns black
sheep as the stir of conflict is in the
air, do not begrudge the fact that all
four feet are firmly entrenched on one
side of the fence.
