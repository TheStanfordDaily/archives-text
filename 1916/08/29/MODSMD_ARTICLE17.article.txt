# Seasonal Tickets Sell For Entire Year Now
## 
### 
Season tickets are being sold by
Graduate Manager Behrens and his
agents in rapid lire fashion. The
usual price of $5.00 per year is
charged for the pasteboards, but the
management will not split the tickets
as has been the case in the past, one
for each semester. The season tick
ets admit the bearers to all athletic
contests and give them the right to
vote and participate in any student
activities.
