IT'S HERE.
The time has come, Prex. Wilbur says,
To cancel many things,
All motor cars and orchid buds,
And two-bit taxi-wings.
The time has come, the co-ed cries,
To pray for many tilings,
For motor cars and orchid buds,
And Fall engagement rings.
The hour is nigh, the big Prof, smiles,
To plan for many things,
For acid tests and smoke-up slips,
â€”A final cx that stings.
The time has came, the freshman
squeaks,
To shrink from many tasks,
! From bubbling, perfumed Searsville
drink,
(This rhymes with whisky flasks)!
The time is ripe, red '19 gloats,
To boost ourselves up high,
With ruddy soph'more battle roar:
Swat the freshman fly!
The time has come, the Junior says,
To think of one big thing,
Of what may come with Junior Week,
When all the world shouts "Spring!"
The year has dawned, the Senior
sighs,
To think up many ways,
To aid the helpless faculty
To plan for future days.
The time has come, the hangman
warns,
To stop and cry "Enuf!"
And beg a thousand humble pardons,
For throwing out this stuff.
H. S. M.
