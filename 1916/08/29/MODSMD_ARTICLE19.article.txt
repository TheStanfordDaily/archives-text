# Y.M.C.A. Open Semester's Activities
## 
### 
Though social activities of the Y.
M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. will not be
started until Friday and Saturday
evenings when the freshmen stag and
joint reception are scheduled, both
associations are busy assisting new
arrivals on the campus. Tme Y. M.
C. A. has its usual flood of applicants
for work, while positions so far have
proved to be all too scarce.
