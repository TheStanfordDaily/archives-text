# Wind Big Bens for Eight A.M. Classes
## Day's Work Shifted Forward to Make Way for Longer Afternoon 
### 
Important changes in the Univer
sity curriculum have been announced
in the schedule and by the Registrar's
Office. Classes have been shifted and
new courses have been added, but
probably the most vital change has
been in the time the classes are
called and in the adding of another
day for school work.
Instead of answering the bell at
5:25 lor the first morning recitation,
the students will be expected to be
in the seats by 8:10 o'clock. The re
maining morning classes convening at
9, 10, and 11 o'clock, respectively.
The afternoon periods have been
moved forward thirty minutes, the
times being set for l:0r>, 2:05, 3:0.",
and 4:05.
(Jives .More Afternoon Time.
The principal reason for this
change, as stated by Professor H. C.
Moreno, associate professor of Ap
plied Mathematics, is to give both the
students and members of the faculty
more time in the afternoon for par
ticipation in athletics. Under the old
system, those interested in outdoor
sports were not given ample time to
engage in them.
To relieve the congestion in some
of the classes, thirty-four recitations
have been shifted to Saturday morn
ing, a change suggested last semester
by President Wilbur. The request of
the Academic Council that the 11
o'clock period on Thursdays be left
vacant for student assemblies was
granted, so there will be no recita
tions at this time during the present
year. The only other change of im
portance is the admittance of first
year students into Geology and Geog
raphy 1.
