# BIG COMPETITION IN ALL MINOR SPORTS
## SWIMMING THIS FALL Physical Training Department Increases Scope by New Innovation 
### 
With the present semester an inno

championships will be held in the

rugby, soccer, basketball, swimming,
fencing, indoor soccer, and golf will
be given trips to meet other teams in
competition to a much greater degree
than has been possible under the old
system.
May Swim In Fall.
At the present time negotiations are
being carried on to determine the ad
visability of holding the swimming
