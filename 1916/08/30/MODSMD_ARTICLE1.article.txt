# BIG COMPETITION IN ALL MINOR SPORTS
## SWIMMING THIS FALL Physical Training Department Increases Scope by New Innovation 
### 
With the present semester an inno
vation is to be introduced into the
physical training department by
-which the scope of athletic competi
tion, both intercollegiate and other
wise, will be greatly broadened, there
by providing the advantages of such
competition to the great number of
Stanford men who heretofore were
confined to gymnasium work.
Competition for All.
The new plan,which has been care
fully worked out by Dr. Stolz and
which has the hearty support of Pres
ident Wilbur, provides for the main
tenance of intercollegiate competi
tion for all minor sports by the phy
sical training department. This has
been impossible before, due to the
heavy drain upon the student body
treasury caused by the varsity events.
The added expense which increased
minor sport competition will cause
is to be met by the five dollar student
fee imposed by the Physical Training
department this semester, thus assur
ing minor sports of a much more fav
ored position than they have hereto
fore held.
Cup Contests In Spring.
During the fall semester of each
year novice meets, in which everyone
is eligible to compete, will be held
in both major and minor sports with
in the university, while university cup
championships will be held in the
spring. At the same time teams in
rugby, soccer, basketball, swimming,
fencing, indoor soccer, and golf will
be given trips to meet other teams in
competition to a much greater degree
than has been possible under the old
system.
May Swim In Fall.
At the present time negotiations are
being carried on to determine the ad
visability of holding the swimming
meets in the fall rather than in the
spring semester when the sport cal
endar is overcrowded. If the innova
tion can be carried out it will serve
to attract those who are engaged in
other sports during the spring. Sev
eral promising swimmers have en
tered in the class of 1920, among
them Ross and Balbach. The former
is reckoned among the few hest
swimmers in the United States.
Although minor sports will be
greatly popularized through the in
novation of providing trips for out
side competition, regular classes will
also be held for those who desire
straight gymnasium work. However
no gymnasium work will be compul
sory, nor will university credit be
given in these classes, registration for
which will be held tomorrow and Fri
day in the gymnasium. Locker keys
can be secured upon presentation of
deposit receipts, which can be ob
tained at the Business Office, tomor
row and Friday.

With the present semester an inno
vation is to be introduced into the
physical training department by
-which the scope of athletic competi
tion, both intercollegiate and other
wise, will be greatly broadened, there
by providing the advantages of such
competition to the great number of
Stanford men who heretofore were
confined to gymnasium work.
Competition for All.
The new plan,which has been care
fully worked out by Dr. Stolz and
which has the hearty support of Pres
ident Wilbur, provides for the main
tenance of intercollegiate competi
tion for all minor sports by the phy
sical training department. This has
been impossible before, due to the
heavy drain upon the student body
treasury caused by the varsity events.
The added expense which increased
minor sport competition will cause
is to be met by the five dollar student
fee imposed by the Physical Training
department this semester, thus assur
ing minor sports of a much more fav
ored position than they have hereto
fore held.
Cup Contests In Spring.
During the fall semester of each
year novice meets, in which everyone
is eligible to compete, will be held
in both major and minor sports with
in the university, while university cup
championships will be held in the
spring. At the same time teams in
rugby, soccer, basketball, swimming,
fencing, indoor soccer, and golf will
be given trips to meet other teams in
competition to a much greater degree
than has been possible under the old
system.
May Swim In Fall.
At the present time negotiations are
being carried on to determine the ad
visability of holding the swimming
meets in the fall rather than in the
spring semester when the sport cal
endar is overcrowded. If the innova
tion can be carried out it will serve
to attract those who are engaged in
other sports during the spring. Sev
eral promising swimmers have en
tered in the class of 1920, among
them Ross and Balbach. The former
is reckoned among the few hest
swimmers in the United States.
Although minor sports will be
greatly popularized through the in
novation of providing trips for out
side competition, regular classes will
also be held for those who desire
straight gymnasium work. However
no gymnasium work will be compul
sory, nor will university credit be
given in these classes, registration for
which will be held tomorrow and Fri
day in the gymnasium. Locker keys
can be secured upon presentation of
deposit receipts, which can be ob
tained at the Business Office, tomor
