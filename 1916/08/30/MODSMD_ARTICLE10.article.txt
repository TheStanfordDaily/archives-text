# RUGBY RALLY ON BOARDS FOR THURSDAY
## PLAYERS TO SIGN UP Encina's Roof Being Renailed Preparatory to Big Yell Meeting 
### 
Rugby will come to the front for
the year 1916 with a bang tomorrow
night when Yell Leader Hill Gilroy
calls for the first "Skyrocket" of the
season in Encina Hall promptly at
7:30 in the evening.
Gilroy and Graduate Manager Beli
rens have lined up a galaxy of speak
ers who know everything from A to
Z about every phase of the pigskin
game, and when they get through
with their talks it is prophesied that
every man present who has enough
wind in his lungs to hunt the proper
corner will tack his John Henry for
a semester's frolic on the turf.
First Workout Saturday.
The aforementioned frolic will be
gin in true sweat and blood style
Saturday morning, when Coach Floyd
Brown lines up the huskies for scrim
mage demonstrations, and delivers
the speedy willowy boys over to one
of his assistants for some backfield
exercise. Then after a little warm
ing up by that arrangement, Coach
Brown will gaze at the lightning
passes of the backs somewhat after
the usual fashion that he invariably
uses from September Ist to the time
of the Big Game. It's probable, too,
that some of the jottings he makes in
his note book will figure conspicuous
ly between now and said Big Game.
I)r. Murray On Table.
Among those present on the speak
ers' table at Encina tomorrow night
will be Dr. A. T. Murray, who has
been named head of the Rugby Union
of this state; E. C. Behrens, graduate
manager; Coach Floyd Brown;
Leland Cutler, president of the
Alumni Association in San Fran
cisco; Student Body President Earl
Swigart, and Rugby Captain Joe
Braden. In addition to these enter
tainers, Yell Leader Gilroy promises
music by some of the best of the
Cardinal ivory ticklers.
According to medical men, healthy
Americans need something to go into
a frenzy about every once in a while.
After the present quiet summer, it is
prophesied by student body leaders
that every Stanford man will avail
himself of this opportunity to look
after his health.
In anticipation of a rush for foot
ball togs, Graduate Manager Behrens
has well stocked the store, and will
have this dispensary open Friday af
ternoon to sell goods.
In the meantime, workmen are busy
renailing down Encina's roof prepara
tory to the annual rally, while all
along the row and everywhere they
are brushing up on songs and yells,
with the intention of loosening those
nails via the lung expansion route.

Cardinal ivory ticklers.
According to medical men, healthy
Americans need something to go into
a frenzy about every once in a while.
After the present quiet summer, it is
prophesied by student body leaders
that every Stanford man will avail
himself of this opportunity to look
after his health.
In anticipation of a rush for foot
ball togs, Graduate Manager Behrens
has well stocked the store, and will
have this dispensary open Friday af
ternoon to sell goods.
In the meantime, workmen are busy
renailing down Encina's roof prepara
tory to the annual rally, while all
along the row and everywhere they
are brushing up on songs and yells,
with the intention of loosening those
nails via the lung expansion route.
Rugby will come to the front for
the year 1916 with a bang tomorrow
night when Yell Leader Hill Gilroy
calls for the first "Skyrocket" of the
season in Encina Hall promptly at
7:30 in the evening.
Gilroy and Graduate Manager Beli
rens have lined up a galaxy of speak
ers who know everything from A to
Z about every phase of the pigskin
game, and when they get through
with their talks it is prophesied that
every man present who has enough
wind in his lungs to hunt the proper
corner will tack his John Henry for
a semester's frolic on the turf.
First Workout Saturday.
The aforementioned frolic will be
gin in true sweat and blood style
Saturday morning, when Coach Floyd
Brown lines up the huskies for scrim
mage demonstrations, and delivers
the speedy willowy boys over to one
of his assistants for some backfield
exercise. Then after a little warm
ing up by that arrangement, Coach
Brown will gaze at the lightning
passes of the backs somewhat after
the usual fashion that he invariably
uses from September Ist to the time
of the Big Game. It's probable, too,
that some of the jottings he makes in
his note book will figure conspicuous
ly between now and said Big Game.
