# OUR ATHLETIC CLUB
## 
### 
As far back into the remote re
cesses of the past as any of the
present generation's. memory can
travel, there has always been one
hour in the university curriculum,
which a student could safely place
among the sacred fifteen —the gym
nasium credit. This custom has sud
denly passed into the records of an
cient history.

Often it is the case with the gen
eral public, that when one places a
worn copper cent directly before its
eye, the gold piece farther back be
comes obliterated from sight. Whether
such will be the plight of the male
population of the campus rests solely
with them.
** * * * * * *
In relegating the gymnasium credit
to the scrap heap, Stanford's athletic
policy, competition for the many un
der the most ideal conditions, takes
another big stride ahead. Those in
charge of the gymnasium are desir
ous of interesting each individual
registered in the university, rather
than paying court to five or six hun
dred in need of an extra hour. No
opportunity has been overlooked in
making Stanford's Athletic Club as at
tractive as possible, so as to answer
every whim and need of her guests.
Efficiency in physical training has be
come a byword.

Over a dozen minor sports are in
cluded on the calendar with their ad
ditional second, third and fourth
teams, each provided with schedule
and suitable coaching. All expenses
of competition will be met by the
university, while the profits resulting
from these contests are turned into
the coffers of the graduate manager.
Heretofore the major games required
the bulk of athletic revenue.
* * * * * * * *
Occasionally now we hear a long
and lang< \ wail issue from some
corner of the campus lamenting the
loss of an easy graduation hour.
This complaining handful had best
obtain their exercise through a cor
respondence school. The great major
ity, however, will appreciate and
keenly enjoy Stanford's Athletic Club.
