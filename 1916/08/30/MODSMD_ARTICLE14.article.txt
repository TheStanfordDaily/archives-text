"Doc* Hayes Will
Return to Farm.
Allen Hayes, '16, and H. J. Steiny,
'16, spent several weeks in a Los An
geles hospital as a result of having
been thrown from their motorcycle in
Hollywood, while returning from the
summer geology camp. Steiny suf
fered a fractured leg, while Hayes
received a complete break. In spite
of the injury he hopes to return to

Ruth Alluni, *16.
Laurence L. Hill, '11, and Miss Ruth

Quad, was editor of The Daily Palo
Alto in his senior year, and claimed
membership in Encina Club, Press

lie Wanted a Job and
He Went After It!
"How about a job?" said Donald P.
McDiarmid, '20, of Stockton, to Allen
Payne, representing the campus
"hashing" trust. "I'll try and fix you
up over at lloble," was the reply.
"Come and see me in my r00m —77."
Payne lives at Encina. McDiarmid
thought he referred to —yes, you
guessed it! That's exactly what hap
pened! The freshman finally landed
in the shower room, where he was
found by the matron and showered
with indignation.
"You give me a payne!" McDiarmid
said to his employer, later. Which,
after all, is nice talk for a freshman
who has seen as much of the world
as has McDiarmid.

Lynn Murray, '13, former track star
and varsity tennis captain, was one

Looking for "Student"
Had Check Passer
Acting Chief of Police Evans of
Palo Alto is looking for a youth who
passed about $20 worth of bogus

a counter check. His purchases were
for small amounts, but he tendered

Looking for "Student"
Had Check Passer
Acting Chief of Police Evans of
Palo Alto is looking for a youth who
passed about $20 worth of bogus
checks on unsuspecting Palo Alto
merchants recently, while posing as
an incoming Stanford student. The
mysterious check-passer used meth
ods ingenious and effective. He
would search vainly for a check-book;
not finding it, he would resort to
a counter check. His purchases were
for small amounts, but he tendered
five dollar pdper.
"Doc* Hayes Will
Return to Farm.
Allen Hayes, '16, and H. J. Steiny,
'16, spent several weeks in a Los An
geles hospital as a result of having
been thrown from their motorcycle in
Hollywood, while returning from the
summer geology camp. Steiny suf
fered a fractured leg, while Hayes
received a complete break. In spite
of the injury he hopes to return to

berth when diamond practice is called

Ruth Alluni, *16.
Laurence L. Hill, '11, and Miss Ruth

Quad, was editor of The Daily Palo
Alto in his senior year, and claimed
membership in Encina Club, Press
Club and Quadrangle Club,
lie Wanted a Job and
He Went After It!
"How about a job?" said Donald P.
McDiarmid, '20, of Stockton, to Allen
Payne, representing the campus
"hashing" trust. "I'll try and fix you
up over at lloble," was the reply.
"Come and see me in my r00m —77."
Payne lives at Encina. McDiarmid
thought he referred to —yes, you
guessed it! That's exactly what hap
pened! The freshman finally landed
in the shower room, where he was
found by the matron and showered
with indignation.
"You give me a payne!" McDiarmid
said to his employer, later. Which,
after all, is nice talk for a freshman
who has seen as much of the world
as has McDiarmid.
Murray Still Doing 1
Things In the East.
Lynn Murray, '13, former track star
and varsity tennis captain, was one
of the few men to register a clean
