TABASCO.
He l.ad run the gauntlet of 73 ac
quaintances, heard their "Glad to see
you back!" and wondered how much
they meant it. He had loosened and
tightened and then loosened his purse
strings until they had become mere
shreds. He had subscribed to this,
that and The Daily Palo Alto. He
had given polite ear to the bellow
ing of the ballyhoo boys whose sole
interest was to dispense with a mem
bership in the Down and Out Club, or
the Up and Going Society, in ex
change for a few trifling dollars. He
had assented to send his collars to
one laundry, his socks to another, his
"flat" work to some Oriental bazaar,
and his shirts to somewhere in
France. He had promised to stay in
bed two days while he placed his
clothes under the chaperonage of
Rippum and Tearem, Owatan Oder,
and the Out D. Spot Dying Company,
well known Palo Alto Cleaners.
Then he set out for home and rest.
But, turning a corner of the Quad, he
encountered an old acquaintance
agent.
"Why, hello!" breezed the acq.-
agent. "Awfully glad to see "
The other cut him short.
"Hello! I don't believe a word you
say. Yes, I had a good summer, but
I did too many things to enumerate at
this instance, although I am tickled
to be back; however, 1 am not going
to work too hard. Yes, things do
look the same, why shouldn't they?
VVhat'd you do to change them? You
may see me again, and maybe you
won't. Depends who looks first. If
you were awfully glad to see me, you
stand alone â€”I wasn't particularly
overwhelmed at a glimpse of your
countenance. So long! Good-bye but
not au revoir!"
