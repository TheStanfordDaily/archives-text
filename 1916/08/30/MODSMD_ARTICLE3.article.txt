# Women to Learn What Every Wife Ought to Know
## 
### 
"How much meat should be
contained in a Hamburg steak?"
"How much sawdust?"
"How much wood would a
woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck
could chuck wood?"
"How much would a 25-year
old husband chuck?"
These are some of the things
that every housewife should
know, and same of the questions
that are to be answered for Stan
ford women in the newest course
to be given in the Universityâ€”
home economics.
Beginning tomorrow afternoon Dr.
Jessica Peixotto, of the University of
California, will meet Stanford women
every Thursday at 4 o'clock, for a
two-hour course in the problems of
house planning and household man
agement. The first hour will be a
lecture period; the second will be
devoted to conference work.
Dr. Peixotto is a well known au
thority on economic subjects. Her
services were secured for a course
at Stanford through the efforts of
the resident alumni.
Dr. Peixotto will meet her audiences
in the old chapel, room 100. All who
have had Economics 1 are eligible to
attend. Visitors are to be welcomed.
