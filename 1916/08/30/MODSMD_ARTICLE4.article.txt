# Union Board Wants Thousand Members
## Added Privileges For All Result From Vigorous Canvassing 
### 
One thousand members for the
Union is the object of the vigorous
campaign launched by the Board of
Governors. With a membership com
mittee composed of seniors and grad
uate students, among whom are Ilix
Maurer, '17, M. J. Cody, '16, S. W.
Oberg, '17, W. R. Wheatly, '17, S. F.
Adams, '17, and I). F. Clark, '17, new
and old students alike are being
signed up. From the results shown
from the first days of campaigning a
thousand members will be secured
with very little difficulty.
Large Membership Needed.
To carry out the fundamental ob
ject of the Union and make it a suc
cess as intended by the founders, a
large membership is a primary neces
sity. Not only from a financial stand
point but to promote the Stanford
spirit of democracy there must be a
membership representing the entire
Stanford community. The founders
intended to make the Union a place
where all students, from freshmen to
graduates, /and members of the fac
ulty, could meet on an equal footing
and become better acquainted. For
new students the Union offers this
to a far greater extent than found in
most colleges. Old students and
members of the faculty have recog
nized this and are responding better
this year than ever before.
