Stanford football teams must meet
the most strenuous schedule ever ar

ager Behrens, who has just an
nounced the 191G line up of games.

9, and the schedule will not be fin
ished until some time after the Big
Game has been played, if the plans
for a post season game materialize.

it is possible that the former back

nounced the 191G line up of games.

from early in September until in No
vember, and other contests still to
come.
The varsity will have a game with
outsiders every Saturday. The var
sity contest will be the Big Game

November 11.
Both the second and third varsity
squads have a healthy program to

meet. As yet no games have been
slated with Woodland high school,
Stockton high school, and San Jose
high school. Graduate Manager Beh

changes in the freshman schedule to

Rugliy In Full Rlooni.
According to present indications
there will be more rugby rampant on
and off the campus than in any pre
vious year, so far as Stanford is con
cerned. With Charlie Austin to coach
the Santa Clara huskies, the Big Game
assumes a doubtful nature again, and
it is possible that the former back
fielder can spring surprises.
About a month before the Big Game
rugby fans can get a line on Austin's
ability to make a team, when the local
first year the Mission class
