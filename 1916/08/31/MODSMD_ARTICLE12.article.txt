# OFFICER FOR MILITARY DRILL ARRIVES TODAY
## MANY STUDENTS SIGN FOR NEW COURSE President Wilbur Requests All Men Interested to See Dr. Stolz at Once MANY STUDENTS SIGN FOR DRILL 
### 
According to an announcement
given out by President Wilbur this
morning, a course in military train
ing will be installed at Stanford im
mediately. President Wilbur has been
in conference with General Bell in
San Francisco and a non-commission
ed officer will arrive on the campus
today to take charge of the work.
In all probability, a commissioned of
ficer will be given command, but this
cannot be done until the Washington
authorities sanction the plan.
Over one hundred first year students
signed up to take the course, as have
many sophomores and upperclassmen.
President Wilbur requests that all
those who wish to become affiliated,
with the movement or who are in the
least interested in it, see Dr. Her
bert R. Stolz at the gymnasium as
soon as possible.
To Study Tactics.
Military drill alone will not consti
tute the course, as it is planned to
make a thorough study of military
tactics, lectures being given at regu
larly appointed periods. The work
will be made very interesting and as
bfenefifift! to those taking it as pos
sible. T experience of training citi
zen rookies" at the various summer
camps has given the officers interested
in this movement an expert knowl
edge of the necessary procedure.
Many of the students who have de
clared their willingness to enlist have
had some previous experience, mak
ing it much easier for rapid advance
ment in the drill work.
May Petition for Credit
In regard to University credit being
given for the military work, President
Wilbur announced that credit would
not be offered as an incentive to
take the course. If the students, after
signing up, decide that they want the
credit and petition for it, the petition
will in all probability be granted. As
the military work is something en
tirely new on the Stanford campus
and as it is a part of a widespread
movement all over the country, it is
hoped and expected by the leaders
of the movement that a large percent
age of the students will get into com
munication with Dr. Stolz and en
thusiastically join in it.
