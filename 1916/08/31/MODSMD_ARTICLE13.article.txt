# Rugby Dope Favors Cardinal Prospects
## Coach Brown and Joe Braden Optimistic Qver Outlook of Football Season 
### 
Football Captain Joe Bradeti' figures
that the Cardinal' rugby'ites stan'd well
to (lie front on the old, thumb-worn
dope sheet. With the 1916 season of
ficially ushered in tonight in a gigan
tic rally, the question of Stanford's
possible success or failure is often
heard on the campus. Braden be
lieves that the fifteen of this year
will compare favorably with any pre
vious team. Sample, Pettingill, Hal
sted, Walker, Carroll, Dink Temple
ton, Swigart, Braden, Smitherum,
and possibly Hick Teiupleton of last
year's victorious team, will he on
hand to don their suits in the first
practice on Saturday. Of the sub
stitutes, Chandler, Coleman, Long,
Scott, and Dievendorff will be back
in harness.
Otto Lachmund. one of the best
rugby players on the coast, is hack in
college after a year in the business
world. His presence will add a world
of strength to the Cardinals. His
playing in the last two Stanford-Cali
fornia struggles was the feature of
the contests, and the bleacher warm
ers figure on seeing swerve to many a
try this season.
Hest of all, Coach Floyd Hrown,
who has endeared himself to every
Cardinal rooter, will again hold the
coaching reins. This in itself assures
the squad of success. Hrown states
that the material with which to mold
a team is exceptionally good and that
with tlie new men that he expects to
come out, nothing but victories should
be recorded on the turf score board.
