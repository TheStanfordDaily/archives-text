A rollicking welcome was extended
to all new women by the-Y. W. C. A.
last evening at the Club House, where
a good majority of the "500" gathered
for the first get-together of the year.
The freshmen women presented a
clever movie of Lochinvar at the open
ing of the program. Everyone had
ample opportunity to meet the new
Dean of Women, Miss Harriet Brad
ford, and the new Y. W. C. A. secre
tary, Miss Mary H. Pope.
The charming personality and sim
ple friendliness of Miss Bradford has
already won the love and respect of
all Stanford women. Miss Pope is a
graduate of Northwestern, although
her home is in Evanston, Illinois.
After completing her course at North
western, she took a course at the
New York Training School for Secre
taries, and came to Stanford well pre
pared to fill the vacancy left by Miss
Eileen Everett.
Miss Bradford, Miss Pope and Miss
Dorothy Metz, '17, president of
Women's Conference, gave short ad
dresses of welcome, after which danc
ing and "eats" completed the eve
ning's entertainment.
