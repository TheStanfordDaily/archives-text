# Frosh Give Sophs Close Poster Fight
## Though Outnumbered Second-Year Men Succeed in Getting Edicts Down 
### 
Though stubbornly opposed, the
sophomore class wis successful last
night in decorating the campus and
Palo Alto with posters elaborately
decorated with advice and edicts for
the special benefit of their rivals, the
members of '20. from early yester
day afternoon until 1:80 o'clock this
morning tlie two underclasses were
in more or less constant conflict,
though the principal battle of the
night was not staged until after 4
o'clock this morning. As the hands
of the campus clocks neared the of
ficial "open season," the sophomores
began operations in "picking off'
stray freshmen and conveying them
to a peaceful farmyard ten miles
from the campus.
Classes Establish Headquarters.
Immediately following th< class
meetings the members of the rival
classes began gathering in their re
spective camps. The nineteeners met
out on the road to Wunder Inn, where
they established a camp and re
mained until after 3 o'clock this
morning. The first year men met on
the football field, but later moved up
to Frenchman's dam until late in the
night, when they moved to the Row,
where they lay in waiting until the
sophomores came in from the country
this morning.
Row Fight Close.
Outnumbered, the sophomores had
their hands more than full in holding
the freshmen in the fight on the Row
this morning, the '20 men claiming a
slight advantage at the end. Both
sophomores and freshmen were given
hose baths gratis, but while this con
flict was in progress the nineteeners
had a dozen autos out laying posters.
This year's Row fight did not reach
the proportions of the scrap between
eighteen and nineteen on the D. K. E.
lawn last year.
