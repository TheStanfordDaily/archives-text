# '19 May Have Lost
## But Gerry, '19, Won 
### 
Sometimes battles are won by
losing.
Here's a tale of an such.
Gerry Thomas, '19, Imperial Valley,
was quietly walking down University
avenue last night at 6:51 p.m. when
he was spotted by a crowd of two
hundred freshmen.
At 6:52 p.m. Gerry was speeding
along at a twenty-five mile per clip,
with said two hundred freshmen of
Twenty howling after him.
Unfortunately, Gerry stubbed his
toe, slipped, fell, and fainted, which
act queered the whole deal.
Palo Alto's chief of police, seeing
the Class of '20 doing a war dance
around Gerry's body, concluded Gerry
a dead one at the hands of the frosh.
Witness, then, two hundred of the
Class of Twenty being driven out of
Town by the Police, leaving Gerry
coming to his own, a victorious war
rior, gurgling joyously, "Tu-'ll wi' th'
Class o' Twenty."
.Moral: There's more than one way
of cleaning the frosh.
