# ORNAMENTS WILL BE UNWELCOME AT STANFORD
## DR. WILBUR REAL MEN SOUGHT President Talks Very Frankly at Initial Assembly of 1916 Year 
### 
Advice, both good and extra good,
was offered the Stanford men and
women today, at the first assembly
of the year. The gathering, brought
about for the purpose of welcoming
new and returning undergraduates,
and for the purpose of imparting
knowledge of Stanford ideals to the
freshman, served its purpose.
From the words of President Wil
bur, Chaplain Gardner, Dean of
Women Harriet Bradford, and Student
Adviser Paul Stamford, the new
Stanford undergraduate could not fail
but realize that he was wanted and
needed here—and that, in return for
what was given him, he was expect
ed to do and refrain from doing cer
tain things laid down by rules of
honor.
Dr. Wilbur Speaks Plainly.
Dr. Wilbur spoke plainly and
directly. He declared that he had
not yet learned to think one thing
and say another. He told his audi
ence in frank terms just what sort of
men were wanted, and what sort were
not wanted at Ptanf.ord.
He said that the attainment of
knowledge was the main business of
the college man, and that other mat
ters were side issues, pure and sim
ple. He told that he believed that if
a man expects to play his part later
in life, he must play it here.
"If you cut classes," Dr. Wilbur de
clared, "or if you dodge examinations,
or crib —you'll get that much less
from the University."
No Parlor Ornaments Wanted.
The type of man that can be labeled
a parlor ornament is not wanted at
Stanford, Dr. Wilbur made clear. He
referred to his letter to students' par
ents, remarking that the greatest dis
approval had undoubtedly come from
the students rather than from their
elders.
i "If a man has a big bank account,"
said the president, "let him keep
quiet about it. If he has more money
than he needs, let him give to a
worthy charity. We do not care for
any display. We do not want par
j lor ornaments here. We want men
I who may be in the Four Hundred,
but we do not desire the ciphers.
"We have removed the observatory
on the hill so that it will be difficult
to keep poker parties going. There
may be other haunts that we may
! have to give our attention to."
| Introducing Miss Bradford.
Referring to Miss Harriet Brad
ford, Stanford's new Dean of Women,
President Wilbur designated her as
"another splendid young woman whom
we have been able to bring here in
spite of the 500."
Miss Bradford voiced Dr. Wilbur's
sentiment that Stanford expects noth
ing more than good all around
womanhood from its women. She
said more than that, however, ex
pressing an opinion that the ideal is
to be sought out, rather than merely
found.
Classroom tiber Alles.
"Safety first" "as the slogan that
Student Adviser Paul Staniford ad
vised freshmen to keep in mind, in
their struggle to avoid being wrecked
by the wayside.
"Keep your mind first on the class
room," said Staniford. "Classroom
education is one of the two great
benefits that can be derived from
college.
Broadmindedness, gleaned from as
sociation with a great number of peo
ple with varied aims and interests,
was the second great benefit of uni
versity life mentioned by the Student
Adviser.
Rev. Gardner Merry.
Acting in a friendly advisory capac
ity, the Rev. D. Charles Gardner, in
a very merry mood, told new under
graduates of the road to success in
Stanford life.
"Read the charter for knowledge
of the Founders," said the Rev. Gard
ner, "and then you will know your
Alma Mater standing above all per
sonal —something to admire and re
spect.
"College friendships must be free
from advice, gambling, snobbery, ex
travagance, licentiousness. These
evils are alien to Stanford."
"Hail Stanford Hail" was not sung
at the conclusion of today's assem
bly. Yell Leader Gilroy was unable
to be present. The student body
failed to take command of the situa
tion and did not sing the tarditional
hymn upon its own volition.

education is one of the two great

Rev. Gardner Merry.
Acting in a friendly advisory capac
ity, the Rev. D. Charles Gardner, in
a very merry mood, told new under
graduates of the road to success in
Stanford life.
"Read the charter for knowledge
of the Founders," said the Rev. Gard
ner, "and then you will know your
Alma Mater standing above all per
sonal —something to admire and re
spect.
"College friendships must be free
from advice, gambling, snobbery, ex
travagance, licentiousness. These
evils are alien to Stanford."
"Hail Stanford Hail" was not sung
at the conclusion of today's assem
bly. Yell Leader Gilroy was unable
to be present. The student body
failed to take command of the situa
tion and did not sing the tarditional
hymn upon its own volition.
Advice, both good and extra good,
was offered the Stanford men and
women today, at the first assembly
of the year. The gathering, brought
about for the purpose of welcoming
new and returning undergraduates,
and for the purpose of imparting
knowledge of Stanford ideals to the
freshman, served its purpose.
From the words of President Wil
bur, Chaplain Gardner, Dean of
Women Harriet Bradford, and Student
Adviser Paul Stamford, the new
Stanford undergraduate could not fail
but realize that he was wanted and
needed here—and that, in return for
what was given him, he was expect
ed to do and refrain from doing cer
tain things laid down by rules of
honor.
Dr. Wilbur Speaks Plainly.
Dr. Wilbur spoke plainly and
directly. He declared that he had
not yet learned to think one thing
and say another. He told his audi
ence in frank terms just what sort of
men were wanted, and what sort were
not wanted at Ptanf.ord.
He said that the attainment of
knowledge was the main business of
the college man, and that other mat
ters were side issues, pure and sim
ple. He told that he believed that if
a man expects to play his part later
in life, he must play it here.
"If you cut classes," Dr. Wilbur de
clared, "or if you dodge examinations,
or crib —you'll get that much less
from the University."
No Parlor Ornaments Wanted.
The type of man that can be labeled
a parlor ornament is not wanted at
Stanford, Dr. Wilbur made clear. He
referred to his letter to students' par
ents, remarking that the greatest dis
approval had undoubtedly come from
the students rather than from their
elders.
i "If a man has a big bank account,"
said the president, "let him keep
quiet about it. If he has more money
than he needs, let him give to a
worthy charity. We do not care for
any display. We do not want par
j lor ornaments here. We want men
I who may be in the Four Hundred,
but we do not desire the ciphers.

on the hill so that it will be difficult

| Introducing Miss Bradford.
Referring to Miss Harriet Brad
ford, Stanford's new Dean of Women,
President Wilbur designated her as
"another splendid young woman whom
we have been able to bring here in
spite of the 500."
Miss Bradford voiced Dr. Wilbur's
sentiment that Stanford expects noth
ing more than good all around
womanhood from its women. She
said more than that, however, ex
pressing an opinion that the ideal is
to be sought out, rather than merely
found.
