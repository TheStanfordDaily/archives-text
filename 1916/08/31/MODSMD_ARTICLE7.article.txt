# Matriculation Test Puzzles Freshmen
## Quarter of 1920 Class Pass. Babes Excel in Original Spelling 
### 
Results of the freshman matricula
tion test in English posted on the
Bulletin Hoard of the Registrar's of
fice this morning showed a greater
percentage of failures than previous
examinations. Out of 411 who took
the test Monday, 125 passed, 84 were
recommended to English 11, and 202
failed. The large percentage of fail
ures is explained by a stiffer set of
questions this year.
Many amusing examples of the
usual freshman mistakes were
brought out in a dictation of a pas
sage from "Don Quixote." Every
thing from "Dunkey Ola" to "John
Jacoby" was offered as a substitute
for the unsurmountable title.
Grammar as usual presented the
greatest stumbling block and caused
a high percentage of failures. The
most popular theme for composition
was a letter of first impressions. All
of these were filled with pointless
comments on "cords" and displayed
in great abundance the freshman awe
for the upperclassmen.

Results of the freshman matricula
tion test in English posted on the
Bulletin Hoard of the Registrar's of
fice this morning showed a greater
percentage of failures than previous
examinations. Out of 411 who took
the test Monday, 125 passed, 84 were
recommended to English 11, and 202
failed. The large percentage of fail
ures is explained by a stiffer set of
questions this year.
Many amusing examples of the
usual freshman mistakes were
brought out in a dictation of a pas
sage from "Don Quixote." Every
thing from "Dunkey Ola" to "John
Jacoby" was offered as a substitute
for the unsurmountable title.
Grammar as usual presented the
greatest stumbling block and caused
a high percentage of failures. The
most popular theme for composition
was a letter of first impressions. All
of these were filled with pointless
comments on "cords" and displayed
in great abundance the freshman awe
for the upperclassmen.

passed the test: Allen Eleanor, Hob
