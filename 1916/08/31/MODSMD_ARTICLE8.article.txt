# Small Increase Shown in Total of Registration
## 
### 
Registration figures this morning
showed that Stanford now has more
students than at a corresponding
time a year ago in spite of the new
scholarship requirements which were
designed to limit enrollment.
According to the Registrar's office,
this is no surprise, and the boost in
scholarship was meant to bring about
just the result accomplished. Had it
not been lor the requirements, Stan
ford's enrollment for 191(i would have
increased in proportions that would
make it impossible to care for every
one properly.
Six hundred and ten new students
were registered yesterday. Twelve
hundred and sixty-four old students
are back, making the total registra
tion eighteen hundred and seventy
four. This is an increase of twelve
over a year ago.
No men have been turned down as
yet who have had the necessary re
quirements. It is expected that sev
eral new students will be added to the
present list.
