# WORK ON NEW LIBRARY WILL SOON BEGIN
## CENTER OF NEW QUAD Stack Space of New Structure to Greatly Exceed That of Present Building 
### 
Work on the new Stanford library
will begin at once if the plans sub
mitted by Hakewell and Brown, of
San Francisco, are approved by the
Hoard of Trustees. The half-million
needed to complete the structure has
been set aside from the recent general
building appropriation.
The new building will form part of
the second quad, being placed oppo
site the center arch of the inner quad
rangle. In architecture it will con
form to the Thomas Wei ton Stanford
museum, being in brown sandstone,
though somewhat different from the
buildings of the present quadrangle.
Efficiency Keynote.
Suggestions from the library staff
and committee have been incorporated
in the plans to make the new building
as near perfect as possible. Eight
hundred thousand to one million vol
ume stack space has been provided
for. This will supply a long-felt need
for room, the present library being
so crowded that all books of the six
hundred class have been moved in the
trophy room.
Plans are now in the hands of
Librarian G. T. Clark.
