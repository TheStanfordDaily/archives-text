# STANFORD'S DUTY
## 
### 
Not many months back on the cal
endar, the word "preparedness," al
though existing in Noah Webster's
famous compilation, was unknown to
this country. During the present day,
the identical word has become an in
centive lor parades of hundred thous
ands, and a slogan for political par
ties, not to mention the fact that it is
used as a decoy in advertising.
Everywhere one meets the same topic
—adequate national defense.
** * * * * * *
Through the untiring efforts of a
handful of zealous students, combined
with the hearty co-operation of Presi
dent Wilbur and various members of
the faculty, this university is now
able to perform her part in the great
movement that has taken the United
States by storm. Permission was yes
terday secured from Washington to
install a military training school for
reserve officers at Stanford. A non
commissioned officer arrived today on
the campus to take command of the
two hundred men who have signified
their intention of taking advantage of
the wonderful opportunity.
* * * * * *##
At this time it is needless to dwell
upon either the merits or necessity
of preparedness, as both are better
known in this age than the ten com
mandments. The proposed plan not
only affords one the chance of becom
ing acquainted with military drill, but
also the acquisition of war tactic
knowledge through lectures. Further
more the preparation is to train re
serve officers, not high privates in
the rear ranks. University credit and
non-compulsory enlistment in case of
war are other features.
* * * # # ***
Due to the snail pace of the Demo
cratic red tape, the arrival of a com
missioned officer will be delayed for
several days. In the meantime it is
of the utmost importance that all
those interested sign up with Dr.
Stolz, as an enlistment of four hun
dred has been set as the goal. Help
Stanford to do her share in being pre
pared.
