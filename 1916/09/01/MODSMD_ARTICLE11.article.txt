Freshman tryouts for the staff of
The Uaily I J alo Alto will continue
Monday afternoon. Owing to the fact
that the present staff is quite limited
in number, a fair-sized squad of the
first-year men will be added at the
conclusion of the tryout period. Ap
pointments will be made at the end
of six weeks in competitive work. The
success of candidates will be based
on intelligence, energy, and ability to
Secure and write news accurately.
The Daily Palo Alto will welcome men
and women of the entering classes
who wish to enroll for the tryouts.
