# Frosh Fall Before Sophomores' Rush
## Last of Freshmen Smell Paint Before the End of First Twenty Minutes 
### 
Spurning the use of the full thirty
minutes allotted them, the sopho
mores yesterday afternoon tied up in
barely twenty minutes every freshman
who participated in the annual rush
011 the varsity football field. Thor
oughly incensed over the stubborn re
sistance shown by the members of
the '20 class in the poster fights of
the previous night, the nineteeners
amply repaid the babes for their en
ergetic tearing up of posters by
branding them with red paint at the
rate of one for every five seconds of
the contest.
Strategy Does Work.
Strategy on the part of the sopho
mores was the stumbling block for
the freshmen. Instead of carrying
the fight into the freshman territory,
the second year men allowed the
"frosh" to bring the fight close to the
sophomore "morgue," where captured
freshmen needed to be carried but a
relatively short distance to the paint
can. Though the nineteeners had ex
pected the freshmen to carry the fight
to them, none of the sophomores had
been so optimistic as to expect the
freshmen to "fall" for the ruse so
easily. During the first ten minutes
the sophomores were kept more than
busy tying up the freshmen who vir
tually walked into their tying squad.
Better organization was the secret of
the sophomoric success.
Over two hundred participants rep
resented each of the classes. 1 lie
fight was refereed by Coach Floyd
Brown, while all varsity "S" men
were on hand to prevent all unfair
ness.
