"The time has come,"
Said Tal, "by gum,
To stck the studes for mon.
Avast there, youse,
Don't chew that bun,
Until you've paid your dues."
This is a friendly warning. If you
tumble into Frank Tagawa's Union
I hashery, and get comfortably seated,
and begin to eat, and have just stowed
away enough of a juicy steak to be
an appetizer—
And then if a tough looking individ
ual who looks about as much like a
prize fighter as Freddie Welsh, strides
in, and says, "Stop, there, don't take
another bite "
And then don't get scared, because
the steak isn't poisoned, for Frank
doesn't serve any such steaks, and
don't think the stranger wants your
steak —for he doesn't
He wants your money.
Just dig for your check book and
pay your Union dues, and then carry
your card on a string around your
ueck—where Tal Smith can see it
1 while you eat —and he'll not look
| tough or disturb you.
But don't get sore at Tal —it isn't
his fault—it's yours—Union dues are
due and overdue —and the best way
to become one of the One Thosuand
I here is to contribute your two dollars
| E. pluribus Unum.
