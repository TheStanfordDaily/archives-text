# STANFORD MEN RALLY TO CAUSE OF RUGBY GAME
## More Than Two Hundred Sign Up For 1916 Season 
### 
"Get behind the coach and captain
and give them all you've got," was the
way W. Palmer Fuller, former editor
of The Daily Palo Alto, expressed the
football sentiment at Stanford for
1916. And from the way Fuller's
statement was echoed and cheered, it
may be judged that Cardinal athletes
agree entirely with the former editor.
Many Sign l'|».
Accordingly, the rugby season was
ushered in with a rush to the corner
tables of Encina's clubroom to sign
up. After the scramble was over,

Coach Floyd Drown reported that two
hundred and twenty-five huskies, and
speedy ones, and medium ones, had
signed up—the usual beginning of a
Stanford football season and the usual
flock of players from which a Cardinal
Big Team is eventually picked.
First practice on (he turf will begin
at 3:30 Saturday afternoon, Coach
lirown told his men, and following
that every day at 4:50 sharp.

The first speaker on the program
after Yell Leader Hill Uilroy had di
rected the opening spasm of yells and
noise for a time, was Dr. A. T. Mur
ray. "The storm is all passed be
tween the facility and student body,
if there ever was one," began Dr. .Mur
ray, who pledged the friendship of the
faculty for the coming year.
"We stand on the threshhold of a
good year," he continued. "There
never has been a time when the out
look for sport was so good—never a
time when things we wanted were so
bright—go-get-'em."
Dr. Murray then explained the ath
letic machinery that is back of the
men on the fields for the benefit of j
the new men—and old ones.
Must Win Hotli (tallies.
Leland Cutler, president of the
Stanford Alumni Association, next
took the table. "We are all agreed
011 two things. One is that we must
win from Santa Clara and win both
games. Santa Clara thinks she can
win—there is no gain for us by hold
ing an opponent too cheaply. The
other thing we are agreed upon is
that this year we are fighting the big
gest battle of all with our old love —
California. Stanford ideals are to be
put to a severe test. I pledge you
the support of the alumni if you men
get behind the coach."
Earl C. Behrens, graduate manager,
explained the financial arrangements

which make possible the forty-four
contests already slated for the coming
year. To date, according to Hehrens,
no school that was on the schedule
last year has dropped off this year.
In past years competition with South
ern California schools has not
amounted to much, and has been very
limited. So far as finances are con
cerned, Stanford is well fixed.
