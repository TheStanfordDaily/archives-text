# RUGBY PRACTICE OPENS WITH WORKOUT
## SQUAD PLEASES COACH Material For Eight Teams Limbered Up on Turf Saturday Afternoon 
### 
Under the guidance of Coach Floyd
Brown, over one hundred men turned
out in suits Saturday afternoon to
start the rugby season with what was
termed the initial practice. This is
but one-half of the total number
signed up to compete for places on
the various teams, but the size of the
squad will undoubtedly grow as the
season advances, many of the new
men and veterans not being able to
come out during the lirst few days of
limbering up.
Many New Men Out.
Both Coach Brown and Captain Bra
den expressed themselves as being
very well satisfied with the workout.
Nearly half of the men were unfamil
iar with rugby, coming from schools
that have adopted American football,
but Coach Brown thinks that there is
splendid material with which good
teams can be molded. The freshmen
stacked up as a bunch of huskies,
while among those out for varsity
places were many old faces to Card
inal followers of the turf sport.
Coach Outlines Season.
After the roll call, Coach Brown
gave the squad a short talk on what
he expected of them during the next
three months. He explained his sys
tem of placing lists on the training
house with the names of the men and
the positions they were to play. He
asked their hearty support, not only
when everything seemed optimistic,
but when things were going wrong.
According to the coach, training rules
will not go into effect for a few
weeks.
Ten minutes of gymnasium exer
cises were gone through by the entire
squad and then some of the funda
mentals of rugby were shown the
new men by coach, captain, and mem
bers of the 1915 varsity. Danny Car
roll and Pettingill proved to be of
great help in showing the new blood
the rudiments of back field and scrum
Play.
Teams .Hade By Classes.
The lists posted Saturday had the
men divided into class teams, the
following being a list of those picked
for positions on the first teams of each
