# WEEKLY LECTURE SERIES STARTS WEDNESDAY
## REV. SULLIVAN SPEAKS Plan to Bring Stanford People Nearer to Big Men of Outside World 
### 
As a means of bringing Stanford in
closer touch with the world at large
a series of weekly lectures for stu
dents and other members of the Uni
versity community has been arranged
by the Public Exercises committee
through Professor G. .J. Peirce, chair
man. Though the meetings are de
signed to take the place formerly
held by the Tuesday evening lectures
of several years ago, they will not
always be given on Tuesday evening,
but will rather be given at the times
when the '"biggest" men can be ob
tained. Tuesday evenings will be the
regular time, except in cases where
it is impossible for the prospective
speakers or entertainers to be here at
that time.
Key. SullivaH First Speaker.
The first of the speakers will be
Rev. William L. Sullivan who will
arrive on the campus Wednesday
morning and will speak in room 100,
the old chapel, at 7:30 that evening.
Rev. Sullivan is now the foremost
apostle of Unitarian evangelism in the
United States, but was trained as a
Roman Catholic and was a Paulist
father, that is, a member of the
preaching evangelist body of the
Catholic church. He left the Catholic
church at the time of the "Modernist"
movement, and has since been an ad
vocate of liberality in religion. He
will speak on the subject, "A Religion
for Modern Men." at Wednesday
night's meeting.
Other Big Events Coming.
Other events arranged for are the
appearance of Rev. Charles W. Gilkey
of the Hyde Park Baptist church,
Chicago, on September 22, when he
will speak on "The Religious Signific
ance of the Personality of .Jesus;" a
song recital by Mrs. Leonard W. Ely
on September 19, anil a lecture by
Professor Alvin S. Johnson on Sep
tember 26. Later, Harris Weinstock,
state commissioner of markets, Miss
Amy Hoi man, soloist, and the Savan
nah String quartet, will be obtained.
Tiie weekly meetings will usually
be held in room 100, but on some oc
casions the Memorial Church and the
Assembly Hall will be brought into
use The re-establishment of the
weekly evening lectures is in line
with a new policy to rid Stanford of
its trend toward provincialism. The
meetings will begin promptly at 7:30
and will never last more than an
hour, and will not interfere with
study and school work.
