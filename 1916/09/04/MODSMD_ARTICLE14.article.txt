Despite numerous and amusing
rumors to the contrary, Stanford Uni
versity exists primarily for the fur
therance of education. The funda
mental object of two hundred faculty
members at the helm is to inject
their knowledge into some two thous
and students —while the only visible
cause for the student's presence is to
imbibe the proffered knowledge.
** * * * * * *
Yet we find in our midst a definite
group which seemingly opposes the
very purpose for which the Univer
sity was founded. Fraternities, a
score in number, embracing over five
hundred men, stand contentedly upon
a scholarship record anywhere from
five to thirty per cent lower than the
non-fraternity men's average. All
blame and responsibility vests solely
with the Creek letter societies. Sure
ly, then, the time must come when
either fraternity scholarship must be
raised to normal, or else these or
ganizations find themselves carefully
laid away upon a dark and dusty
shelf.
The highest mortality rates rest
with the freshmen, who permit the
false glamor of college life to blur
out the more serious duties. Should
fraternities by means of a joint ruling,
delay initiation of all neophytes until
the opening of the second semester,
when the proper scholarship quali
fications have been demonstrated, a
long step will have been taken to right
the existing fault. The incentive is
thereby offered to pass creditably in
all fifteen hours.

A word concerning rushing, in this
connection seems appropriate. That
the present system in vogue on the
Stanford campus is basically wrong,
there can be no doubt. Neither is a
newcomer afforded sufficient time to
determine which group it would be
most advantageous for him to join,
nor is an organization given the
proper period during which to con
sider the man. The seizing of an un
sophisticated youth while in high
school is inexcusable. Tonight during
the rattle of chains, and moans of
skeletons, the fraternities might well
consider the proposal of both a two
weeks' rushing season minus the
chloroform, along with the question
of raising scholarship standards.
