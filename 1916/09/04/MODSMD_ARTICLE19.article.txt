"Dear Ma, I've been here just one
week," wrote Clementine Got-Rocks
"I've learned to smoke and say kej
down'; my wardrobe's in a hat box.
I've got my cap and joined a frat. I
went to church one day. But ma, my
pocket book's gone flat, what will
your husband say? Tell him that you
need a hat and send me fifty 'seeds,'
or whisper in his ear mama, the
Ladies Aid's in need. I've one book
and need ten more, each one "1111181
be brand new.' There's 'Dippy,'
'Chappy,' gym and lab., each one has
money due. Oh ma! I'll smoke bird
seed, corn fiakes, if 1 can have some
mon. Tell pa I'm almost through my
course, and I'm bis only son. Or say
you know a Belgian boy whose charge
has been quite heavy; he's trying to
hold Verdun himself, the dum-dum
siege is steady. I dare not write to
him myself and say, 'send me some
mon.' He'll swear and say 'come
home my son, your education's done.
You're making us all paupers here
and grandpa's got the gout. Your
sister needs a bathing spit, she's bad
to do without.' So ma, you ask hinii
please for me. He'll say, here wife's
the cash. Go buy a hat with silk
chiffon and add a pink-rose sash. So
111 a, I'll feed on beans and prunes and
go without my fun until I bear from
you again. Your loving, hungry
Son."
