"The big feature was the boxing
bout between Willie Ritchie, the for
mer lightweight champion of the
world, and Hoi) Lytle, the nervy
youngster from Stanford University,
who stood up and exchanged punch
for punch with the champion,
Crowd Cheers Lytle.
"The crowd gave a loud cheer when
Lytle shot out from his coiner and
clipped Ritchie on the chin. The blow
was a surprise to Willie. After that
it was all Ritchie, and it would not
be stretching the point to state that
Ritchie could have ended the bout at
any time. He showed remarkable
cleverness and was unliitable when
he wanted to elude Lytle's swings.
Ritchie showed splendid sportsman
ship throughout and made a deep hit
with the crowd. Lytle is a game fel
low and Ritchie admired his courage.
Once Ritchie slipped to his knees, and
Lytle aided him to his feet. Ritchie
smiled an acknowledgement of thanks
for the sportsmanlike act of the col
lege athlete."
