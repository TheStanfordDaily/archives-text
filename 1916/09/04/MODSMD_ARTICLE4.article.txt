# OVER ONE HUNDRED AWAIT COMING OF MILITARY OFFICER
## 
### 
No progress can be made in the
plans for military drill until the non
commissioned officer promised as an
instructor for the Stanford prepared
ness enthusiasts arrives on the cam
pus. General Bell said that he would
be on the ground several days ago,
but war department red tape has pre
vented his coming. Over a hundred
freshmen and many students from
other classes have enrolled for the
military training course. University
credit is not offered as a bait to get
men into the drill work, but students
who take it may petition for credit
later, if they wish to do so.
