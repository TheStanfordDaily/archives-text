# Soccer Innovation Attracts Athletes
## 
### 
Because of the decision which has
been reached to play the two big soc
cer games with the University of Cali
fornia during the fall semester, in
stead of having them extend into the
spring semester, soccer is calculated
to attract to its ranks a great num
ber of athletes who heretofore did
not care to give up other spring
sports to finish the soccer season.
Dates Set for (tames.
The first of the two games with
U. C. will be played probably at Berk
eley on the morning of the big game
with Washington, while the second
will be played on the local field on
Thanksgiving Day. Negotiations are
at present being carried on for a
game with Sacramento. The first
game in the Saturday league, which
will include such teams as the Olym
pic Club and the Barbarians, will be
played on the first Saturday in Oc
tober.
Opportunities for new men are es
pecially favorable this year, due to
the many vacancies in the lTneup of
last year. The following men, in
cluding substitutes, are back this
year: Captain Adams, Rooney, Mc-
Clung, Ketcham, and McMahan. These
men will form a nucleu* for this
year's team but it will be the new men
who will have to make it a winning
team.
