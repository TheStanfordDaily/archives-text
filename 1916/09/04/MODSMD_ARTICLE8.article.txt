# Embryo Yell Leaders to Be Trained in Special Gilroy School For Bleacher Howlers
## 
### 
Are you a psychologist?
Maybe you think you were cut out
for a leader of a howling mob.
If you think so, are you an Eight
eener?
You ought to be a male, too, though
there's no law on the books that pro
hibits you from being a female.
Above all, do you want a job?
Well, then, here's the proposition.
Yell Leader Gilroy is going to start a
school for embryo leaders shortly,
preparatory to having the student
body name his worthy assistants for
the coming year.
Try-outs begin Tuesday evening,
tomorrow. Candidates are requested
to report to Gilroy on or before that
time at the Chi Psi lodge.
