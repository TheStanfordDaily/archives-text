# SANTA CLARA LOOMS UP AS STRONG RIVAL
## MANY VETERANS BACK Cardinal Ruggers Play First Practice Games of 1916 Football Season 
### 
Rumors drift up from Santa Clara
that the Mission Town will be repre
sented this season by the strongest
fifteen that has ever worn the Red
and White. Charlie Austin, who got
his first rugby experience on the
champion Berkeley High team, and
later starred at first five-eighths for
Stanford, is now coaching the rival
squad, and if his opinion counts for
much in the football world, the Big
Game is not going to be any walk
away.
Last year the Santa Clara team was
a strong combination, and those who
witnessed the Big Tangle know that
the final score did the game an in
justice. from the first whistle, the
game was decidedly a contest and no
one team affair. Santa Clara had a
splendid fifteen, but superior team
play and individual class defeated
her.
Ten Siiuta Clarans Return.
Ten of the 1915 Red and White
pig-skinners are back in harness, and
many prep school and club stars have
entered the Catholic institution.
Archie Quill, who played for Santa
Clara three years ago and who has
participated against Stanford for var
ious club teams, is back at Santa
Clara, and with a goodly number of
scrum veterans on the job, the for
wards should show some speed. With
Austin as coach, there is little doubt
that the backfield will be able to with
stand the heaviest attacks and show
some ability to score.
Cardinal Shows Up Well.
Yesterday's workout on the local
varsity and auxiliary turfs showed
that Stanford will be well able to cope
with the strongest team that Santa
Clara will have to pit against the
Cardinal fifteen. The seniors met the
first freshmen on the varsity field,
while the jnniors and the second
freshmen played a short game on the
outside turf. The freshmen showed
that they have a husky contingent
and prospects for a winning team,
while the seniors with many varsity
men, played well. All the men out
seemed to show lack of condition.
Practices will be held every night,
the first games being scheduled for
next Saturday. Coach Brown believes
that the three teams on the boards to
play before the Stanford rooters will
be in good condition, no injuries being
reported so far, and well able to
hold their opponents down.
