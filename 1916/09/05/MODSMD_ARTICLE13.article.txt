# "DON'T TEACH WRONG MEN," JORDAN WARNS
## ANALYZES WEAKNESS University Loses Character by Wasting Energy on Idle, Dissipated Youths 
### 
"The greatest weakness of the
American college system comes from
teaching the wrong men," says Dr.
lJavid Starr Jordan, in his article up
on American colleges, which appears
in the September Forum. "Energy
devoted to the teaching of the idle and
dissipated is worse than wasted. The
gain in income from the admission
of the 'tender rich,' with their pri
vate tuition and evasion of strenuous
effort, docs not balance the loss of
character to the University."
In spite of this, and other objec
tions to the state university system in
the west, Dr. Jordan claims that the
American college does pay dividends
on an investment of a billion dol
lars. In the articlo he says:
"To the average public the Uni
versity President is a licensed beggar,
the agent in a game in which the
winner each year is the one who gets
the most names in his catalogue. It
is not true that the most populous
university for that reason is the most
prosperous or the one capable of the
best service.
"The highest merit of the system is
that it is constantly in a state of flux
and change. A weak feature is that
the professional side of law and med
icine is too long left outside the Uni
versity system altogether. The Amer
ican student is two years behind the
German student upon entering col
lege, although the American knows
vastly more of the world, and has
earned moneyâ€”sometimes al! that he
has.
"The American University has
staked its future on its direct useful
ness to the people. The entire com
monwealth is under its care."
