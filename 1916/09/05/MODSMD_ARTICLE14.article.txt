# Scarcity of Work Report Job Seekers
## Y.M.C.A. in Search of Employment For Undergraduate Students 
### 
Demand for student employment is
unabated, according to .T. I?. Watson,
secretary of the Stanford Y. M. C. A.
Men seeking work have applied at the
Association odice in the Stanford
Union in even larger numbers than
last year, and the supply of jobs, both
temporary and permanent, has no
where begun to equal the number of
applicants.
Thirty Positions.
So far thirty men have obtained
permanent positions. Hashing, dish
washing, cooking, tending furnaces,
and taking care of lawns are the
principal occupations of the thirty, but
a stenographer, a printer, a wood
turner, and an electrician are included
in their number. The positions have
been on the campus, in Menlo, and
in Palo Alto. Irregular employment
for twenty others has been found.
A large number of men are still un
supplied with work, and some of them
will have to have employment of some
kind or leave the University. Mr.
Watson is at his desk on the lower
floor of the Stanford Union every
morning from 9 until 12.
