Venerable and gray haired elders
have spent countless hours hammer
ing into their more youthful offsprings
the sensible doctrine of the impossibil
ity of existence on mere love Car
toonists have been wont to sketch the
futility of acquiring any satisfactory
experience of fancy dancing through
correspondence schooling. Although
these facts may seem to the average
observer somewhat irrelevant, yet the
same principle underlies the financial
scheme of all university student
bodies.

Up to the present time .only one
fourth of the students registered have
purchased season tickets, despite the
attractive array of athletic entertain
ments arranged by the graduate man
ager. It is especially interesting to
note that out of the five hundred card
boards sold, the feminine contingent
have bought a larger proportional
number of tickets than the male dele
gation. This fact brings to mind the
song which ends with the words, "but
Stanford for her men."

When considering the question from
any angle, one is forced to admit that
all paths lead to a rapid and generous
opening of the purse strings. Value
received is guaranteed. An expecta
tion of something for nothing always
ends in disappointment. Furthermore,
Stanford counts on your help.
