# Frosh Elect Sloman to Class Presidency
## 
### 
Frank Sloman, San Francisco, star
quarter-miler, was elected president of
the 1920 class at a meeting held this
afternoon. Scant interest was shown
by members of the new class, only 75
votes being cast.
Miss Florence Fabling, Denver, was
chosen vice-president, and Mildred
Miller, Seattle, secretary. The contest
for treasurer is still undecided. W.
K. Esgen received a plurality of four
votes over Milton Samis, his nearest
competitor, but owing to the fact that
a majority is necessary another vote
for this oflice will be held in the near
future.
