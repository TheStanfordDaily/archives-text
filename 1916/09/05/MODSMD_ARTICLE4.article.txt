# WILL BUILD BAND STAND NEAR UNION
## 
### 
With the appropriation of five
thousand dollars by the Board of
Trustees for the building of a band
stand, the long felt need of a com
mon out-of-door meeting place at
Stanford has been realized.
Plans are now being drawn by the
University architects, Bakewell and
Brown, of San Francisco. The stand
is to be a part of the quadrangle be
tween the Union and Club House
buildings and is to coincide with the
architecture of the other University
buildings.
Besides being used for band con
certs the building will be appropriate
for open-air speaking, and the head
quarters for athletic rallies. Dress
ing rooms will be in connection with
the stand, and movable seats are to
be provided in order to accommodate
a large audience in the adjoining
court, where trees and grass are to be
planted.
