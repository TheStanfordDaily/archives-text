In keeping with the ideals of the
University, Stanford's public exer
cises committee has arranged a sched
ule of lectures and entertainments,
which will take place each week
either in the Little Theater, Memorial
Church, or Assembly Hall. A galaxy
of speakers, musical performances
and similar attractions have been
placed on the semester's program,
following the expenditure of a good
deal of time and expense.
Often one hears the.pitiful song of
an alumni —and numerous undergrad
uates —lamenting the hodge-podge that
they have made of their short exist
ence in ITniversity circles. No doubt
the wail could be termed universal
in many respects. The recent an
nouncement concerning weekly lec
tures, the first of which is sched
uled for this evening, in the Little
Theater, should be of especial inter
est to the complaining individuals and
those who desire to reap the greatest
harvest out of college.

As an educational feature, the in
novation introduced by the public ex
ercises committee will prove a decided
boon to campus life in offsetting the
present steady diet of motion pic
tures and other amusements, which
in time with constant repetition be
come a bit monotonous. No gold
brick or sugar coated pill is prof
fered, merely a rare opportunity of
becoming acquainted with the affairs
and thoughts of the world. It is to
be sincerely hoped that the student
body will demonstrate their appre
ciation of the manifold advantages
obtainable, by forcing the census
taker of the Little Theater to register
a packed house.
