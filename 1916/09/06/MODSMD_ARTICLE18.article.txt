Editor The Daily Palo Alto:
Sir: One of the most poignant
nuisances, that annoys a great many
of us who do not enjoy the bosky
sibillants of the self-propelling ve
hicle, beside which the arrogant brag
of the latter day klaxon is as the
silent hour of prayer is that expres
sion of callous inconsideration â€”the
open muffler.
Can it be that we do not realize the
spectacular greatness of these off
springs of our Mr. 0.-Howe-Opulents,
and in order that we shall, they cut
out the muffler so that it's snorting
susurrus will the more impress us
with their stellar properties, or is it
mere indifference to public pleasure?
1 am often impelled to think, when
I hear, see, smell, taste, (or distaste),
and feel one of these rampaging swine
pass "Ah, there lie goes, the dear old
chap, with a weak mind, and an open
muffler." Sincerely, T. H. C.
