Mr. Hewston stated today: "There
is no more water in Searsville Lake
now than is necessary, and we have
to conserve all that we have. The
water in the lake is down to the
point where we don't want to see it
get any lower. We want enough
water for fire protection, and if people
are allowed to turn their hose loose
on their lawns, the supply will not
he sufficient. It is a very serious
problem."
