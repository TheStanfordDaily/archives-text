# Chi Omega in Quarantine
## 
### 
The campus was startled today by
the announcement that the Chi Omega
house would be quarantined for
eighteen hours, due to the presence of
diphtheria. Miss Elizabeth Bucking
ham, instructor in English, is the un
fortunate victim of the disease, and
because she has been living in the
sorority house, many others have
been exposed.
Miss Esther Liversidge, who has
been assisting Miss Ruckingham in
the English department, will also be
quarantined until an anti-toxin has
been given and the time in which the
disease is said to develop has passed.
