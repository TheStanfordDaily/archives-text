# Sam Back! Kappa
## Famine Forgotten 
### 
Sara Kappa Gamma, ex-'l6, is back
on the campus. And there is joy in
the hearts of the members of the
Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, Sam's
namesake. For many days these
women would have faced starvation,
had they not sought refuge each meal
hour at the rejuvenated Stanford Inn,
where Frank Tagawa undertook to
feed them a la carte and a la Sam.
The coming of Kappa sorrow dates
back to the day long weeks ago when
S. L. Gamma, ex-'l6, went on a pro
longed "vacation," forsaking the
shores of Lagunita for the more ver
dant fringes of Lake Tahoe. Then
came mourning to the hearts and ap
petities of Kappa Kappa Gamma, and
also a new cook —for such was Sam.
Recently a tong war broke out be
tween Sam's successor, and those for
whom he faced the hot oven. Even
though the cook may have been right,
he left. For days and days Kappa
Kappa Gamma faced starvation and
each other across alien table cloths.
But Sam is back. Allee samee
heap big joy time at Kappa house!
