### 
What makes a newspaper great
and in the highest sense successful?
The foundation is plainly the con
fidence of its readers and the respect
of the community to which it ap
peals," said Louis Wiley, business
manager of the New York Times, last
night in the Little Theater, which was
filled with students interested in jour
nalism.
This foundation, according to Mr.
Wiley, "comes of many renunciations,
of principles clearly formulated and
unswervingly adhered to, of ideals re
ligiously cherished and never aband
oned.
Secret of Success.
"When a newspaper conforms to
such principles, and brains are added
illuminating and vitalizing all these,
the newspaper that is the fruit of
this blending wins the confidence of
the public. If to such a newspaper
come the rewards of great circulation,
large volume of advertising, and sub
stantial profit, may not the student
of journalism say that this reward lias
been earned because the journal is a
newspaper of principles, of ideals, of
convictions, of brains, and of intelli
gence?"
Modern Newspaper Essential.
That the modern daily newspaper
has come to be regarded as one of
the essentials of life, was the convic
tion of Mr. Wiley. "The newspaper is
the stimulus of the statesman, soldier,
lawyer, professional man and day
laborer," he said.
Mr. Wiley complimented Stanford
on the promising outlook for the
Stanford Journalism School, and paid
high tribute to Everett W. Smith, its
head. That seventy-five per cent of
the men in responsible positions on
the staffs of New York papers are col
lege men, was Mr. Wiley's answer to
one of the numerous interesting ques
tions asked him following his talk.
He was introduced by President Ray
Lyman Wilbur.
