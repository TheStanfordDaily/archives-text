### 
An innovation in student body
meetings will be inaugurated at the
opening assembly of the year tomor
row morning by Yell Leader Gilroy,
who has plans to stimulate songs and
cheering at Stanford.
The first meeting will be called by
Student Body President Earl T. Swi
gart, to explain to the incoming
members of the campus community,
Stanford student government organ
izations. Miss Dorothy Metz, presi
dent of the Women's Conference, will
be the only woman speaker on tho
program.
Student Adviser VV. Paul Staniford,
Graduate Manager E. C. Behrens, and
President Swigart will be the men
who will talk tomorrow.
To Sing Stanford Songs.
Yell Leader Gilroy will start sing
ing as soon as enough students have
been seated to carry a chorus. It is
the plan to do this at every meeting
during the year, and have songs while
the student body is assembling.
The Stanford Band has been in
vited to be present and lead the
music.
Two New Songs.
Two new songs for Stanford stu
dents have been accepted by the com
mittee in charge of yells and songs,
but are not in shape to be tried out to
morrow.
It is the plan to stimulate produc
tion of new songs during the year
that Stanford may have songs enough
to sing soon without having to laud
and bless California. It is the aim
of those in charge of the song move
ment to stimulate purely Stanford
songs rather than music alluding to
rivals.
