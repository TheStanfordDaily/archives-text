# Dr. Wilbur Tackles Fraternity Problem
## Societies Must Raise Scholarship and Pay Debts, President Declares in Letter 
### 
Proclaiming his iuterest in removing
such grounds for criticism of Stanford
fraternities as low scholarship stand
ing, Dr. Wilbur addressed a strong
letter to the Greek letter organiza
tions on the campus, declaring it to
be his intention of taking stops at the
end of two years toward disbanding
any local chapter of a national or
ganization which is markedly defic
ient in scholarship or is iif debt for
current expenses.
Extracts from President Wilbur's
letter follows:
Stanford University, Cal.,
September ii, 1916.
To Stanford Fraternities:
Stanford University is constantly in
receipt of severe criticism because the
members of its fraternities as a whole
have lower scholarship records than
the non-fraternity groups, and because
of dclits contracted by some of the
fraternity houses.
When asked, as I often am, why
Stanford tolerates the fraternities
when it stands for high scholarship
and they as University organizations,
at least in individual instances, stand
for inferior scholarship, I am forced
to answer that the fault does not lie
in the fraternity system, other insti
tutions being free from it, hut does lie
in the conditions existing locally in
some of the Stanford fraternities, con
ditions which we shall endeavor to
correct.
In order to help the fraternities
and Stanford, I wish to inform you
that it is my intention at the end of
two years, through the national or
ganizations or otherwise, to arrange
for the disbanding of any fraternity
at Stanford that is in debt for current
expenses or markedly deficient in
scholarship.
I am deeply interested in removing
all grounds for legitimate criticism
of fraternity conditions at Stanford
and because of this I am planning
eventually to urge a one-year resi
dence rule before admission to fra
ternity membership.
