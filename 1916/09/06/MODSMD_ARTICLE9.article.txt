# GETS MARRIAGE LICENSE-MUST FORGO WEDDING
## 
### 
Miss Laura Anderson, '18, is at the
Kappa Kappa Gamma house recover
ing from "auto intoxication," a pecu
liar psychological malady. Miss An
derson does not know why she per
mitted herself to suffer a stroke yes
terday. Fortunately, her little bout
with fate and romance was not seri
ous.
Yesterday afternoon, Martin Detels,
'14, Delta Tau Delta, with a strange
couple whom Miss Anderson did not
know, called at the Kappa Kappa
Gamma house to take Miss Anderson
out riding. The ride carried them to
San Jose.
En route to San Jose, the other
couple talked of getting married, and
took out licenses when they reached
that city. As a ruse, or a lark, Detels
asked Miss Anderson to take out a
license to marry him. As a ruse, or
a lark, and only as such, Miss Ander
son signed the permit.
Unfortunately, for Miss Anderson, a
newspaper man was on the job in
San Jose, and the story appeared in
this morning's papers as a Stanford
elopement. Now Miss Anderson does
not know why she signed the mar
riage license, and she is sorry. She
and her sorority sisters blame the af
fair on Detels, who has just received
an advanced law degree from Colum
bia, and upon whose advice the per
mit was taken out.
At any rate no wedding bells will
ring for the couple, though Miss An
derson's ears will ring for some time.
