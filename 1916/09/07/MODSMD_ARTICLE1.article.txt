# ENTHUSIASM MARKS FIRST OF MEETINGS
## ASSEMBLY A SUCCESS Breadth of Mind Necessity For College Man, E.T. Swigart Tells Audience 
### 
Stanford freshmen were inoculated
with the germ of genuine Stanford en
thusiasm today at the first student
body assembly of the year—a gather
ing pervaded by the true Cardinal
spirit, and a gathering which may be
recorded by many as an epoch in the
unwritten history of full-spirited as
semblies.
Real things were said today by
Student Body President Earl T. Swi
gart, Student Adviser Paul Staniford,
Graduate Manager E. C. Behrens, and
Miss Dorothy Metz, president of the
Women's Conference.
In his opening address, a college
life marked by broad-mindedness, a
life unmarred by narrowness and
snobbery, were named as necessities
by Swigart for the man who expects
to go into the world a real Stanford
man and broad-minded American.
University Life Flexible.
"Throughout the next four years
your life will be narrowed to col
lege affairs," he said, speaking to
the freshmen. "This condition, oppon
ents of higher education claim, is dis
astrous to character building. We be
lieve this is untrue, for narrow as
college life may be, after all it is as
broad as you choose to make it.
College Mail in Danger.
"To be best prepared to win your
way in the world is the motive of
college training," Swigart went on.
"All through life the college man finds
himself in a position, or at least, in
the state of mind above the work-day
sort, a position requiring great skill
and integrity to guard. Upon being
stamped as a college man, one is open
to continuous attacks from the classes
college men are wont to deal with.
"It behooves him to exercise self
restraint, and make ample allowance
for the point of view of those who
have not had the advantages of edu
cation; to remember that many men
are working as hard as he with the
same natural ability, but due to medi
ocre education, have not succeeded
with the same conspicuousness."
"Ignorance of the Law "
"Freshmen, you are necessary, for
indeed, without you, in a few years
we would have no university," was
the frank manner in which Miss Dor
othy Metz, president of the Women's
Conference, offered a hand of welcome
to the newcomers.
But her words after this introduc
tion applied to old and new women
students alike. She advised a thor
ough acquaintance with undergraduate
government, because, as she naively
expressed it, "Ignorance of the law
excuses no one."
Participate in Athletics.
"I would suggest," Miss Metz con
tinued, "that each of you young ladies
take some branch of athletics, some
gym work. The exercise will do
much toward making you more lit
for your other undertakings. You
will find in athletics that nice read
justment between serious effort and
reasonable relaxation which enables
one to make the most of all the good
that is in oneself."
Stauiford Commands Attention.
"There are definite regulations
against bringing liquor on the cam
pus," said Student Adviser Paul
Staniford. "The feeling of the trus
tees is so strong against this prac
tice, that there cannot be any toler
ance.
"Spiking the punch must go"! It is
all the same how you use liquor. Any
organization found putting booze in
punch will not have the chance that
certain other things are said to have
under certain conditions."
under certain conditions.
"Roughing must stop if it goes to
extremes," was another remark from
Staniford that made the assembly
take sharp notice. "There can be no 1
more breaking into houses and taking
things. While there can be no ob
jection to visiting at dances, these
instances of petty thievery must end."

Conference, offered a hand of welcome
to the newcomers.

"I would suggest," Miss Metz con
tinued, "that each of you young ladies
take some branch of athletics, some
gym work. The exercise will do
much toward making you more lit
for your other undertakings. You
will find in athletics that nice read
justment between serious effort and
reasonable relaxation which enables
one to make the most of all the good
that is in oneself."

"There are definite regulations
against bringing liquor on the cam

Staniford. "The feeling of the trus

"Spiking the punch must go"! It is

"Roughing must stop if it goes to

Staniford that made the assembly
take sharp notice. "There can be no 1

Stanford freshmen were inoculated
with the germ of genuine Stanford en
thusiasm today at the first student
body assembly of the year—a gather
ing pervaded by the true Cardinal
spirit, and a gathering which may be
recorded by many as an epoch in the
unwritten history of full-spirited as
semblies.
Real things were said today by
Student Body President Earl T. Swi
gart, Student Adviser Paul Staniford,
Graduate Manager E. C. Behrens, and
Miss Dorothy Metz, president of the
Women's Conference.
In his opening address, a college
life marked by broad-mindedness, a
life unmarred by narrowness and
snobbery, were named as necessities
by Swigart for the man who expects
to go into the world a real Stanford
man and broad-minded American.
University Life Flexible.
"Throughout the next four years
your life will be narrowed to col
lege affairs," he said, speaking to
the freshmen. "This condition, oppon
ents of higher education claim, is dis
astrous to character building. We be
lieve this is untrue, for narrow as
college life may be, after all it is as
broad as you choose to make it.
College Mail in Danger.
"To be best prepared to win your
way in the world is the motive of
college training," Swigart went on.
"All through life the college man finds
himself in a position, or at least, in
the state of mind above the work-day
sort, a position requiring great skill
and integrity to guard. Upon being
stamped as a college man, one is open
to continuous attacks from the classes
college men are wont to deal with.
"It behooves him to exercise self
restraint, and make ample allowance
for the point of view of those who
have not had the advantages of edu
cation; to remember that many men
are working as hard as he with the
same natural ability, but due to medi
ocre education, have not succeeded
with the same conspicuousness."
