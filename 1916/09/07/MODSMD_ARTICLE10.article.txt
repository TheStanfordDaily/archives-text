# Women Adopt New Date Book Rules
## Each Organization to Hold One Friday Dance Under the One O'clock Rule 
### 
New rules for the "Date Hook" were
the main feature of the first meeting
of Women's Conference, held last
night in the Women's Club House.
The most radical change made was
the partial granting of the 1 o'clock
rule, and a general confirmation of
the action taken last week by the
Men's Conference. The list of rules
passed on this subject follows:
Each organization may give one
dance a year lasting until 1 o'clock.
Friday nights, except as excepted
below, are open. Saturday nights
may be reserved and closed for the
organizations named below:
The following dates are closed
