Not long ago a faculty member as
serted that Stanford students should
be divided into two distinct groups,—
the scholars who enter the Univer
sity for the sole purpose of profound
study, and the remainder who are clas
sified as inhabitants of the Cardinal
Country Club. This latter element,
consisting of personages who dallied
in the various college activities, was
to be permitted a campus residence,
but denied scholastic remuneration in
the shape of hours and diplomas.

Then there bobbed up a loyal Stan
fordite, quite in opposition to the pro
fessor, who boldly stated that the
knowledge of Chaucer's rhymes and
remembrance of the middle names of
Henry the Eighth's wives, would be
better substituted by some active par
ticipation in University activities. To
be sure, he decried education, yet he
was no farther distant from the truth
than his cynical instructor.

Those who have delved in the oft
tiine dangerous activity, appreciate
keenly the invaluable dividend re
turned. Although the honor be in
significant, the wealth of experience,
the spark of ambition, and the hosts
of real friendships made, —the worth
of these is untold. Finally, there
comes the benefit derived by the Uni
versity from the earnest, yet unso
licited interest in campus life.

If, instead of devising a quarantine
station such as the suggested Coun
try Club for the participators in stu
dent government, athletics, journal
ism, dramatics and the like, a univer
sal professorial smile of approbation
was forthcoming, more men would in
dulge in activities without feeling it
necessary to obtain a diploma insur
ance policy. On the other hand, the
diamond star must bear in mind that
merely knocking the paint off of ad
vertisements on the outfield fence does
not entitle him to a sheep-skin
brought forth on a silver platter.
Co-operation is the idea, understand?
