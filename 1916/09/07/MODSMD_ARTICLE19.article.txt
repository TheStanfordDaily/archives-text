The medals, which will be awarded
each year under the auspices of the
Foil and Mask society, will be known
as the "Maloney Medals," according
to the express wish of Mr. Howard,

the subject of founding such a fund
even before be had completed his col
lege course.

developing the sport of fencing at
Stanford, serving as the first presi

The medals which lie has provided
for will be awarded at the end of each
year by Instructor Maloney for gen
eral all-around proficiency in the art
of fencing, regardless of the number
of points won by individuals during
