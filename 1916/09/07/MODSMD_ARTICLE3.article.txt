# BIG ATHLETIC YEAR IS AHEAD SAYS BEHRENS
## 
### 
An eastern trip for a Cardinal nine,
new quarters for crew, and a full
calendar of sports, new and old, with
prosperous financial indications, were
some promises made by Graduate
Manager Behrens in a prophesy of
the athletic outlook, which he labeled
as "not merely hopeful, but promis
ing," at the student body assembly to
day.
"We have taken a course, which we
will follow," Behrens said. "But in
unity alone is there the strength to
prove that we are right. Cooperation
is necessary to success. It is incum
bent upon each individual to have a
part in making the 1916 rugby season
a success."
New Source of Revenue.
A proportion of the University
gymnasium fees turned over to the
student body treasury, is a new source
of athletic revenue announced by Beh
rens today. From this source $4500
will be realized; $2500 will be ap
portioned to major sports and $2000
to minor sports.
Behrens stated that with the Santa
Clara game rugby would care for it
self; he declared that baseball last
spring approached closely the paying
margin, and gave every indication of
paying for itself in 1917.
During the summer arrangements
were completed to send a Cardinal
nine throughout the middle west and
east to the Atlantic coast. All ex
penses will be met by the teams
played enroute. San Carlos will here
after be the headquarters of the Stan
ford crew, Behrens announced today,
favorable negotiations being under
way with the San Carlos Country Club
to provide a location. San Carlos is
being made into a bayside resort by
the club, which lias brought the Ohio
building from the exposition for their
clubhouse.
Intercollegiate Ice-Hockey.
Ice-hockey as a new sport will be
come a reality if the organization
backing the sport, for colleges offers
a satisfactory proposition. Basket
ball will be given added impetus due
to a rapid schedule which will bring
the pastime to a close by March 1.
Soccer and swimming arc to have im
portant places on the fall calendar,
in order not to crowd too much into
the early spring months.
Behrens also hinted that before
many semesters the Union, Club
House, Guild and student body fees
would be combined into one, affording
these organization greater assurance
of financial support, and at the same
time, lessening the burden upon the
individual.
