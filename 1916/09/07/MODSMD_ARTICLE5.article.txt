# Fraternity Men Aroused by Letter
## 
### 
With the advent of Dr. Wilbur's let
ter to the Stanford fraternities asking
their co-operation in the raising of
scholarship, local Greek letter men
are again discussing the problems
brought up last spring at meetings
of inter-fraternity representatives.
The one semester rule which was
discussed at thai, time failed of vol
untary acceptance by the fraternities
because of the outright refusal of one
of the organizations to consider it.
They gave as a reason for their ac
tion the belief that all of the fratern
ities would not stand behind the
agreement, which provided that
pledges would not be initiated into
the societies until the first semester
was over and their scholarship stand
ing was satisfactorily assured. Sev

eral other fraternities at this time re
fused to back the plan unless all
would be bound by it.
The plan, which would not have in
terfered with the present method of
rushing, has been successfully adopt
ed at the University of Oregon and
other universities, all of which report
that the arrangement has materially
raised fraternity scholarships not
only among new men, but among the
members of the house as a whole.
Fraternity men are therefore anxious
to reconsider last semester's pro
posal, which failed to pass only be
cause of the opposition of a few
houses, in the hope of thereby solving
the scholarship problem which is the
subject of attack in Dr. Wilbur's let
ter.
