"Don't lose your nerve when fight
ing for spiritual and moral liberty,"
was the keynote of Rev. W. L. Sulli
van's address in the Little Theater
last night. Rev. Sullivan talked to a
packed house, and clothed his rather
radical views with phrases that made
them seem less emphatic than they
really were.
"Hold to the last to a moral inter
pretation of life," he told his audi
ence, "for only in it is there a sound
conception of beauty and life and

health. It is not enough that we
have had men go before us who have
died for liberty, unless we are will
ing to do the same.
"The first duty is to see that human
worth is lifted up above what we call
human value. Value is how much you
can produce. Worth is a thing of the
soul.
"I look and hope for America to
furnish a sound and wholesome re
ligion for free men.
"Ideals die unless they are re-born
every day."
