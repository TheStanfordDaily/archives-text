# CHANCELLOR JORDAN BACK FROM WORLD PEACE MEET
## Called to Washington by President Wilson to Confer as to Means of Ending World War Through Use of Neutral Offices 
### 
Chancellor David Starr Jordan returned last night from Washington,
whore he was called by President Wilson to confer with peace advocates
from all parts of the country as to the best means of bringing about peace
in Europe.
Three main plans were discussed, according to Chancellor Jordan.

First—A congress of neutral nations
might take the lead in bringing the
belligerents together, this congress to
be made up of executives from neutral
nations. Second —United States might
take that lead independently. Third
—Congress might call a conference
of neutral nations, this congress to
be made up of representatives from
congresses.
As yet no decision has been reached
according to Chancellor Jordan. Dr.
Jordan is not able to give out what
took place at the conference in
Washington, since all publicity is to
be handled by President Wilson.
However, Chancellor Jordan gives
his own personal opinion of what
may come of the conference. "In my
judgment, irresponsible of the con
ference, the president cannot do any
thing before the coming election be
cause he cannot undertake a peace
movement that would be attacked
politically at home.
"Both Sides Defeated."
"Probably, what will result will be
that ultimately the president and con
gress will join in a peace movement.
That time will not come for two or
three months because the advent of
Greece and Roumania in the war has
given hope to a victory for the allies,
which would be as ruinous as a de
feat. From the beginning it is plain
that both sides are defeated. What
ever ruin comes to one conies to the
other.
"Those who brought on the war in
Germany have gradually lost the con
fidence of the people. In Great Brit
ain the war group has encroached on
the other party and conditions have
arisen which would have been incon
ceivable two years ago."
Chancellor Jordan looks for the
war to end in six months, but says
his view of the situation may be based
too much on hope. He is well pleased
with the conference at Washington,
and with several minor conferences
he held with people in New \ork.
According to Dr. Jordan, the move
ment for peace must come from the
United States, though he places great
confidence in Louis P. Lachner, for
merly here at Stanford with the chan
cellor. "The Ford conference in
Sweden is growing in importance," he
said, "and is the chrystalizing point
for peace in Europe. It is working
for an honorable peace, which means
the integrity of Belgium and France
will be respected."
Chancellor Jordan will remain at
Stanford until the end of this month
when he will again go on the road
"stumping it"for peace.
