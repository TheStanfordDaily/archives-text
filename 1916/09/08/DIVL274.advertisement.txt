Dear Belgium Girlies—
Sounds rather foolish as a caption to
this drawing—yet it is about as sen
sible as some people are who think
they get better footwear by riding
thirty miles to a big city for a pair
of shoes. People who know have
found that the newest and best in the
footwear line is found at Thoits'—
right at home.
