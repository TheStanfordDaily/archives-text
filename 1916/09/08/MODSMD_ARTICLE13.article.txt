# RUGBY SCHEDULE OPENS WITH VARSITY FACING OLYMPIC CLUB'S VETS
## Five Teams Lined Up For Saturday Contests FRESHMAN VS. S.F. POLY FIRST AFTERNOON GAME 
### 
Five Cardinal football teams will
usher in the 1916 rugby season on the
varsity turf tomorrow, the third and
fourth varsities playing each other at
10 o'clock, the freshmen meeting the
San Francisco Polytechnic team at
1:30, the varsity taking on the fast
Olympic Club aggregation at 3 o'clock,
and the second varsity ending the
day of pigskin sport in a contest with
the Insurrectos at 4 o'clock.
First Week Strenuous.
Coach lirown has put the entire
squad through a strenuous first
week's practice, and the opening day
finds the men in excellent condition.
Most of the players have shown their
ability before the Stanford bleachers,
but tomorrow will be the initial ap
pearance of the team representing the
class of 1920. As has been the caso
in the past few years, a large crowd
will undoubtedly turn out to the af
ternoon games.
Graduate Manager Behrens an
nounces that L. S. Reading will ref
eree the freshman contest, W. P.
Fuller will handle the varsity game,
and Jack Tufts will officiate in the
second varsity tangle. It would be
hard to get three more competent
whistle blowers. Season tickets will
admit spectators to the three games,
while those without the pasteboards
will be forced to part with 50 cents
to view the contests. The morning
game will be played on the varsity
turf also, no admission being charged.
The freshmen have a strong team
on paper, a number of names being
very familiar to followers of rugby.
Just how they will stack up against
the fast high school team from the
bay region is problematical, but the
game will at least serve as an intro
duction for the fifteen to Stanford en
thusiasts.
And the Varsity.
Some strange faces appear in the
varsity lineup, but the fifteen is
mainly a combination of veterans,
last year's second varsity men, and
material from the 1919 aggregation.
Kester, Single, Coleman, and Fisher
played on the All Blacks of Stanford,
Scott, Johnson, Long, and Dievendorf
were substitutes on the 1915 team,
Swartz, Winham, Katten, and Pelouze
pliiyed on the 1919 class team, while
Sample, Pettingill, Halsted, Braden,
Walker, Carroll, Swigart, and Temple
ton cavorted on last season's victor
ious fifteen. Butterfield, Henry, and
Marriott come to Stanford from the
College of the Pacific, all being well
known for former activities on the
football turf.
Against the first string players of
Coach Brown, the "Winged O" will
send a strong delegation. Three for
mer Cardinal stars appear in the
visitors' lineup, Peck, Erb, and Urban
being scheduled to work out against
their old team-mates. The opposing
team will face the kick-off as follows:
Forwards, Alillikcn, Peck, Armitage,
