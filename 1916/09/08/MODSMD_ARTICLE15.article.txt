# Fall Track Begins Monday Afternoon
## Two Interclass Meets Feature Fall Season on the Cinderpath 
### 
The fall track season will be inau
gurated next Monday afternoon when
Captain H. V. Aupperle and the mem
bers of last year's varsity team will
meet all men interested in track at
the oval at 4 o'clock. It is important
that a good crowd of freshmen, as
well as all men who have been out
for track before, should attend this
meeting, as Captain Aupperle iutends
to start fall training immediately.
Unusual inducements are being of
fered to track enthusiasts. There
will be at least two interclass meets,
one of which will be of a formal na
ture, and possibly competition with
California in a cross-country race
later in the fall. The captain of the
California team is eager to meet the
Cardinal runners in the latter part of
November, and Captain Aupperle will
make every effort to get a good squad
together.
