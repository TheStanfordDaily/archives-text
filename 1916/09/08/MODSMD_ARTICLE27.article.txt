# Professor Wildman Reports on Colonies
## "Little Landers" Movement Is Subject of Committee's Investigation 
### 
Complying with the wish of Dr.
Elwood Mead, of the Agricultural de
partment of the University of Cali
fornia, a committee consisting of
Professor M. S. Wildman, professor of
Economics at Stanford, and R. L.
Adams, assistant professor of Agro
nomy at the University of California,
spent about one month during the
summer vacation investigating the
"Little Landers" movement that is
spreading in the United States. The
findings have just been compiled and
sent to the authorities at Berkeley.
Inexperienced Agriculturists.
In recent years several colonies
have been formed in California on the
assumption that families can make an
independent and comfortable living
on small areas of land situated near
a city, without regard to past agricul
tural experience.
The committee investigated four
colonies. Detailed results of settlers'
experiences collected through confer
ences arranged with the leaders in
the communities, and interviews with
business men in neighboring towns,
have been published with the report.
The four colonies visited were San
Ysidro Little Landers Colonoy, near
Los Angeles, Hay ward Heath, near
Hayward, and Ilunnymede, near Palo
Alto.
About the same type of people were
found to have settled in each of the
colonies investigated, and taken as a
whole the report shows that the ven
ture has been none too prosperous.
Those who have made a success in
the main, have outside incomes, and
would probably do better on a larger
piece of ground, while the colonies
can be criticized for confining the
young people and making them dis
satisfied with life.
