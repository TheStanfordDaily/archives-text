# No Chance Now to Get on Campus Water Wagon
## 
### 
Oiling of all the roads around the
Quad will make the abolition of cam
pus water wagons possible. Lasuen
and Santa Inez streets have also been
oiled and rolled.
The work of cleaning the lake bot
tom has begun, and is so thorough
in character that Lagunita bids fair
to be in better shape than ever this
spring.
Kumquat trees are now linging the
roadway through the Quad. Flag
poles have been erected in front of
the men's gymnasium, as well as in
front of the Quad, to fly the pennants
of Stanford and competing teams.
