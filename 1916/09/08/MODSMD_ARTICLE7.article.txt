# OFFICERS NAMED FOR DRILL AT STANFORD
## ARRIVE IN TEN DAYS Men Who Will Lead Military Training Come From Fort Douglas, Utah 
### 
Non-commissioned officers from
Fort Douglas, Utah, will arrive on
the campus a week from Monday, to
take charge of military instruction at
Stanford, according to a telephone
message received late yesterday by
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, from
General Franklin Bell at the San
Francisco presidio. Unavoidable dif
ficulties had prevented the selection
of men to lead Stanford's prepared
ness enthusiasts until yesterday.
To Make lip for Delay.
Actual work will start immediately
upon the arrival of the Fort Douglas
officers. To make up for the delay
of several weeks, drills will be held
every day at first until the men be
come versed in the rudiments of army
tactics. The officers chosen to direct
the work have had considerable ex
perience in summer instruction camps
for students and business men, and
are therefore in a position to know
just what procedure will be the most
effective here.
.May Get Major Itugge.
These officers will probably only
remain in charge during the first part
of the fall semester, as General Rell
hopes to secure the appointment o"
Major Rugge, U. S. A., retired, as
permanent military instructor at Stan
ford. This can be effected under the
new bill concerning such positions,
just passed by congress. Major
Bugge, according to General Rell,
would be the best man in the coun
try that the War department could
assign to Stanford. He lias made a
special study of the most effective
methods of conducting military train
ing classes in universities and col
leges, and has had considerable ex
perience in the actual work of in
struction. President Wilbur is en
thusiastic about the outlook for the
drill work.
