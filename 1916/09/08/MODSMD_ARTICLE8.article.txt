## 
### 
"I have been writing to a former
teacher at Stanford. It is 2:30 in the
morning, and the shells from German
guns have been blowing my candle
out."
So writes Henry Lyne, a Stanford
student, ex-'l2, in a letter to W. H.
Maloney of the Gymnasium depart
ment.
The letter he mentions was mailed
to (J. H. Clevenger, associate professor
in metallurgy here, and shows no
signs of the nervousness which such
a situation would naturally arouse.
He writes: "... I wish this
beastly war would soon finish! It is
2 a.m. and I am on duty in charge of
a battery. We have just stopped
firing. . . .
"This gas shell is a beastly thing.
It makes one's eyes run so badly one
cannot see to do anything, and we
have to wear sponge goggles."
"... Word just came over the
phone to open fire again. Goodbye,
with best wishes."
Lyne was In Australia, following up
the metallurgy work, when the war
broke out. He spent some time in
the training camps in England, was
wounded in the Dardenelles. He was
then stationed in Egypt, from where
lie was moved to the front in France,
from where the letters were received.
He has been promoted to first lieu
tenant for efficient work.
