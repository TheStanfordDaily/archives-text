# New Water Stars in Interclass Swim
## Meet Featured by Showing of Ross, Balbach, Green and Stewart 
### 
Indications are that the first inter
class swimming meet of the season,
which was held at the gymnasium this
afternoon, has brought some new
aquatic stars to the lore. The fresh
men and sophomores presented the
strongest aggregations, with such men
as Ross, Ralbach, Green, Coonse, and
Stewart, for the former, and E. Ped
ley, Daniels, McGaffney, Penniman,
Henderson, and Wright for the nine
teeners.
Recause of only five entries in the
plunge for distance event no tryouts
were held yesterday, as was originally
announced. Ostrander, and McGilvray
are easily the two strongest men in
this event.
