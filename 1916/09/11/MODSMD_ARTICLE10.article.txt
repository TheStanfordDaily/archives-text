A raging forest fire, covering sev

sulted in the death of one man and
the destruction of a great deal of
brush and small timber, yesterday af

Professor C. I?. Wing, of the Stan
ford Engineering department, who is
a member of the California Redwood
Parks Association, this morning stated
that the Big Basin region was in no
danger of fire, contrary to the scare
head reports of the San Francisco
morning papers.
Farm Superintendent llewston hur

ried from Stanford with his two fore
men and the score of workmen em
ployed to keep up the University
grounds, to the scene of the fire, yes
terday afternoon, but, seeing that his
little force could accomplish nothing
on account of the density of the brush
in which the fire was raging, he re
turned to the campus to protect it
in case the fire made headway in
this direction.
Carl Stagen, ranch hand at William
Fitzhugh's summer house at Portola,
was burned to death while trying to
combat the blaze.
