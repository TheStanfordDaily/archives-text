# THREE VICTORIES OPEN CARDINAL SEASON
## VARSITY WINS 9 TO 8 Largest First Day Crowd of Years Proves Interest in Rugby 
### 
Stanford's 1916 rugby season open
ed with a clean score board.
The Varsity defeated the WiHged-0
squad 9 to 8.
Freshmen won over Han Francisco
Poly, 42 to 0.
The Stanford All-Blacks captured
an 11 -to 8 victory over St. Ignatius.
More people were present to see
the opening game Saturday than at
any opening game in the last five
years, according to Graduate Manager
E. C. Behrens, all of which makes
the G. M. smile when he realizes that
interest in the squad is greater than
ever, contrary to expectations.
Freshmen On Toes.
The opening whistle Saturday af
ternoon brought the freshmen to their
toes with San Francisco Polytechnic
opposing them. The freshmen stayed
on their toes during the entire fifty
five minutes of play.
The best surprise of the day was
the lightning play of the first-year
backfield. Risling, Larkin, and Need
ham proved a combination that kept
the Poly players guessing—guessing
principally, "What will the final score
be?" It was forty-two. Nothing to
be said about the other side of it.
Game Interesting.
However, the prep school players
were on the job all the time, and
the game proved an interesting spec
tacle from the fan's point of view, in
6pite of the lop-sided score. The
Poly scrum had the edge on the
freshmen most of the time. This
proved the weakest point in the fresh
man team.
The Varsity encountered a team of
Big Game caliber in the 191G Olympic
aggregation. With Art Erb, .Joe Ur
ban, and others of local renown in
the backfield, and the same old fight
ing scrum, the club men were in a
good way to defeat the Varsity. They
probably would have done it, too, had
the business men been in better con
dition, and held up in the second half
as they did in the first.
Frank Walker's Defense.
Several things are evident as the
result of the Varsity's tussle. First,
that Frank Walker is about the best
defense man that Stanford has on her
lineup. The nervy junior has a habit
of falling intrepidly into any drib
bling rush that comes along, and
stopping it up all by himself until
his colleagues gather around.
Secondly# Dink Templeton's toe is
just as good as it ever was, when it
comes to finding touch. Toes would
be better, for Dink uses all ten toes
equally well. Third, Bobby Pelouze
isn't at all slow at wing. For that
matter, the Varsity has a wealth of
first caliber backfield material that,
can score effectively if the forwards
will get the ball out of the scrum and
into play.
New Men Made Debut.
Several new men made their debut
in Varsity company, among them Mar
riott, from the College of Pacific, who
was at" home on the wing. Pretty
Lachmund, senior, plays the same
style game that Pretty Lachmund,
sophomore, did two years ago, when
the papers made such a hullabaloo
about it.
Taking it through and through, the

Varsity looks like a good bet, if bets
can be made this early in the sea
son.
'The first half of the Varsity-Olym
pic game Saturday afternoon was an
even break, ending 3 to 3. Both
points were scored by penalty goals,
Hale booting for the visitors, and
Templeton for the Varsity.
In the second half the Olympics
kicked off, but were forced to retire
gradually to the defense. Toward the
middle of the half a lightning passing
rush by Long and Braden resulted in
a score by the latter. A few moments
later IJobby Pelouze carried the ball
j over the goal line again.
I Olympics Rally.
The Olympics rallied as the final
] shot rang out, and a rush by Urban,
Montgomery, and Guerin ended with
the latter huskie sprawled over the
1 line, the ball under him. Montgomery
! converted, making the final score 8
to 9 for the Cardinal,
i The second varsity put up a scrappy
game with St. Ignatius in the eve
ning. Meese, from College of Pacific,
proved an effective sprinter, carry
ing the ball over twice in the first
half. Tedford scored in the second
half. The final score stood 11 to 8.
