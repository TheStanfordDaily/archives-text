# THE 						MAXIM SILENCER

Should an outsider have dropped
into the Stanford rooting section
Saturday afternoon with the intention
if lending vocal support, this same
ldividuaj would have departed with
lite erroneous impressions. For
,yone not in touch with the existing
pathy of the bleacher warmers would
nave held the athletic contests some
thing akin to motion pictures with
the accompanying yell-yeaders as
mere side-line clowns, which a blase
audience suffered to continue with
amused tolferance. The very atmos
phere seemed to spell an undertakers'
convention.

No doubt the effort of training a
handful of yell-leaders may be a bit
tedious or tiresome, yet each one is
deserving of hearty support. The
positions to be filled are of import
ance, and a wise selection is prohib
ited by lackadaisical interest. Satur
day's exhibition of enthusiasm was a
farce. In the most instances when the
neophytes would summon sufficient
courage to exact a well earned cheer
from the onlookers, a sickening
silence would follow, interrupted only
by three desperate voicesâ€”those of
the yell-leaders. In the future it is
to be sincerely hoped that the old
soldiers' home attitude or sewing club
behavior will be permanently substi
tuted by genuine rooting.
