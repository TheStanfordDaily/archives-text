for tomorrow afternoon's interclass
rugby contest at 4:15, the freshmen
sophomore game taking place this
afternoon on the varsity turf.
Lyttle, Lachmund, Carroll, and Diev
endorf are some of the senior back
field men, while Single, Sample, Scott,
Pettingill, and Oberg are a few of the
men from whom the scrum will be
chosen. The juniors, with Walker,
Henry, Heron, Templeton, and Hauser
will form a nucleus from which to
form the thirs-year squad, and a hard
fought struggle is the prophecy.
* * *
Otto Lachmund received a slight
scalp wound Saturday, requiring a
couple of stitches, but Trainer "Doc"
Reynolds figures on having him back
in the game in two or three days.
Winham was also the victim of a
sprained ankle during the Olympic
contest which will probably keep him
out of the game for a week. Captain
Joe Braden went out of the game
late in the second half, owing to a
sudden attack of cramps.
* * *
Santa Clara opened its rugby sea
son auspiciously yesterday, with a 54

Coscliina, Fitzpatrick, Milburn, Bens
berg, and Scholtz, took part in yes
terday's contest.
* * *
Although the Cardinal freshmen
outclassed the Poly Hi boys so com
pletely, the babes gave evidence of

kin, Risling, Angell, and Needham
appear to lie a combination hard to
beat, in their backfield.
* * *
Graduate Manager E. C. Behrens
reports a very brisk sale of season
tickets, Saturday, prior to the rugby
contests. The largest crowd at the
opening games in the history of Stan

ing several passing rushes, and being
very much on the job at all times.

Juniors vs. seniors is the schedule
for tomorrow afternoon's interclass
rugby contest at 4:15, the freshmen
sophomore game taking place this
afternoon on the varsity turf.
Lyttle, Lachmund, Carroll, and Diev
endorf are some of the senior back
field men, while Single, Sample, Scott,
Pettingill, and Oberg are a few of the
men from whom the scrum will be
chosen. The juniors, with Walker,
Henry, Heron, Templeton, and Hauser
will form a nucleus from which to
form the thirs-year squad, and a hard
fought struggle is the prophecy.
* * *
Otto Lachmund received a slight
scalp wound Saturday, requiring a
couple of stitches, but Trainer "Doc"
Reynolds figures on having him back
in the game in two or three days.
Winham was also the victim of a
sprained ankle during the Olympic
contest which will probably keep him
out of the game for a week. Captain
Joe Braden went out of the game
late in the second half, owing to a
sudden attack of cramps.

Coscliina, Fitzpatrick, Milburn, Bens
berg, and Scholtz, took part in yes
terday's contest.

Although the Cardinal freshmen
outclassed the Poly Hi boys so com

appear to lie a combination hard to
beat, in their backfield.
