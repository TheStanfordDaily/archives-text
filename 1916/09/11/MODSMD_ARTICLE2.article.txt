# No-Decision Debate With U.C. Adopted
## Annual Intercollegiate Contest Expected to Increase in Educational Value 
### 
Stanford and California will hold
the annual intercollegiate debate this
fall under the "no-decision" plan, it
has been announced, following a final
consultation between the debating
committees of the two universities,
Saturday. Instead, the meeting of the
two forensic squads will be more in
the nature of a public discussion of a
vital question of the day. With no
judges to convince, in order to win
the contest, it is hoped to increase
public interest in debating by mak
ing the competition broader and more
educative in nature, and less narrow
in scope. Wherever the "no-decision"'
type of debate has been introduced in
the east, it has proven a decided suc
cess.
I'repuredness Is Subject.
"Preparedness" is the general topic
selected for this year's forensic meet
ing with California. The specific
question will be decided upon next
Friday at Perkeley, when Stanford
and California representatives will
consider suggestions from each insti
tution. As in previous years the de
bate will be held in San Francisco,
three men arguing on each side.
Although there will be no judges
under the new system, it is planned to
have two prominent public men, fol
lowing the speeches of the college or
ators, sum up the arguments of the
respective teams from an outside
viewpoint and give their own views
on the subject discussed.
U. S. C. Debate Important.
Stanford's debate with the Univer

fornia in San Francisco, will not be
