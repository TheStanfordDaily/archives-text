# Dr. Gilkey Gives a Forceful Sermon
## 
### 
Holding that religion is of value
only when it is first hand, —that it
can be neither borrowed, bequeathed,
nor inherited, Dr. Charles W. Gilkey
addressed a forceful sermon to a large
audience in the Memorial Church, yes
terday.
"Evil spirits in our human life are
so powerful that they will not yield
to second hand treatment," he held,
giving as an example the evil spirits
of unmastered impulse, and doubt, in
the mind of man.
Man Is Religious.
"Man," said Dr. Gilkey, "is inevit
ably religious. Religion is today,
as it always has been, and always
will be, one of the great elemental ex
periences and vital forces in life. If
man says religion is failing, he does
not know the depths of his age nor
of his own life. Religion runs like
electricity, on conductors, who are all
those who believe. It is with religion
as with all other great things in life
—the only ones who know are those
who care. It cannot come second
hand."
