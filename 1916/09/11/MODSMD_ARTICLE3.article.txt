### 
Totally surprising his friends
and upsetting all dope, C. It.
Wakefield, '16, recently editor of
The Daily Palo Alto, confided
Saturday that he had broken a
vow made long years ago, and had
become a benedict. Wakefield was
married to Miss Dorothy Davey,
daughter of Frank Davey, of Palo
Alto, in San Francisco, Saturday.
Wakefield's announcement
caused consternation among his
Delta Chi fraternity brothers, for
he recently hung crepe on the
house door and stated that "finan
cial" matters compelled him to
leave the University.
Saturday, before the news
came out, Wakefield told his
friends that he was "selling au
tomobiles in Sacramento." Mr.
and Mrs. WakJefield will matye
their home in Palo Alto. The for
mer editor will continue to attend
classes at Stanford, while his
bride will resume her art studies
in Palo Alto.
