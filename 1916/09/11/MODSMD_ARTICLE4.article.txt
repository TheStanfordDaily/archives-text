# BATTLE FOR RAH RAH LEADERS ON
## 
### 
Nine candidates answered the call
of Yell Leader Gilroy for men to act
as assistant yell leaders during the
ensuing year, and made their tryout
debut before Cardinal fans Saturday.
After a strenuous tryout period,
during which time votes will be taken
on the bleachers to decide the course
of popular favor, an elimination pro
cess will bring the race between four
men. From this quartet the Execu
tive Committee will elect two assist
ant yell leaders.
The following juniors aspire to lead
the bleachers: Henry Eichoff, H. P.
Hauser, G. H. Luhrs, A. M. Mack, E.
A. Sears, R. R. Spears, J. H. Stearn,
S. C. Townsley, J. F. Williamson.
