# Y.M.C.A. ESTABLISHES NEW MEMBERSHIP BASIS
## 
### 
To establish the Y. M. C. A. on
a firmer footing on the campus, the
cabinet of the local Association has
accepted the recommendations of the
membership committee that the basis
of membership be changed. Hereto
fore, membership has been based
largely on dues. In the future it will
be based on attitude toward the Y. M.
C. A. and its work.
No Dues Now.
In the past anyone who wished
could become a member of the Asso
ciation by payment of the necessary
dues. Now the plan is to pick the
men that are needed to help carry
on the work of the Y. M. C. A. There
will be no dues to entitle men to
membership.
It is felt by. the cabinet of the Y. M.
C. A. that the aims of the Association
have been misunderstood here, and
that a large amount of the misunder
standing comes from the monetary
side of the membership question.
Hence the change. The financial loss,

it is felt, can be made up in another
way.
Make Y. M. C. A. Nearer Men.
In order to bring the Y. M. C. A.
nearer to the men of Stanford, a
canvass of the campus is to be taken
this semester to find out opinion of
and attitude toward the Association,
it is thought that the organization
can get much valuable information in
this way.
According to Y. M. C. A. leaders, the
aims of the Association are practically
the same as the ideals of practically
every Stanford man, namely, "Clean
living and service," and it is ex
pected that closer co-operation with
men who are not members of the
local organization, will help in bring
ing about conditions on the campus
that most people want.
After the census of opinion has
been taken by the membership com
mittee, it will be tabulated, and the
most practical and useful suggestions
will be put into effect.
