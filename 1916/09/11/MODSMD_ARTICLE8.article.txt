Diving—Won by Rakestraw (17);
Halbach (19), second); Kohale (20),
third; Green (20), fourth.
Relay—Won by sophomores. Time,
1:13 1-5.
Freshmen swimmers were victor
ious in the annual interclass swim
ming and diving competition held Fri
day afternoon at the gymnasium, piling
up a score of 54 points to the 39
points annexed by their nearest riv
als, the sophomores. The junior and
senior teams were last, the former
with 24 points and the latter with
11%.
Norman Ross, '20, was the mainstay
of the first-year aggregation and the
indivdual star of the meet. He came
in first in the 200- and 600-foot dis
tances, free stroke, and the 200-foot
backstroke. The relay proved to be
the closest race of the meet. Ross,
swimming the last lap for the fresh
men, overcame a big lead which the
sophomores had obtained, but finished
a fraction of a second behind the
second-year swimmer.
