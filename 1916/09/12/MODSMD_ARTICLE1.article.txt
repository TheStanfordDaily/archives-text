# RUGBY UNION TO HELP HIGH SCHOOL TEAMS
## HOLD INITIAL MEETING "Court of Appeals" Appointed to Settle Differences Between Schools 
### 
Important business that is expected
to further the interests of rugby in
the high schools of the state was
transacted last night at the first
meeting of the Rugby Union, held in
the quarters of the Barbarian Club in
San Francisco. All of the delegates
to the Union were present, and Dr.
A. T, Murray, the president, opened
the meeting, stating that he believed
that a prosperous year was in store
for the rugby players and the follow
ers of the game.
Invite School Representatives.
Invitations were extended the
schools composing the California In
terscholastic Federation, and the San
Francisco Athletic League, to send
delegates to all future meetings of
the Rugby Union. It is expected that
the high schools afliliated with these
organizations will glady accept the
invitations.
A fund of one hundred dollars was
set aside for the promotion of rugby
in the high schools and a committee
will he appointed to supervise the
spending of the fund. Dr. H. R. Stolz
and "Ric" Templeton will make a tour
of some of the high schools playing
rugby, and by lecturing and the use
of charts, hope to instruct the prep
teams in some of the fine points of
the game.
A "Court of Appeals," consisting
of a committee of three, will be in
stalled to handle all disputes that
cannot be settled between the two
teams concerned, although it is ex
pected that nearly all disagreements
will be settled in the latter way. A
number of informal talks concluded
the evening's business.
