# REV. GILKEY WARNS, ALSO INVITES YOU
## LECTURE AT 7:30 P.M. Chicagoan Will Try to Rout Religious and Spiritual Doubts of Campus 
### F. J. Taylor, '18 
Clearing up religious and spiritual
doubts of Stanford men and women is
the business of Rev. Charles W. Gilk
ey of Chicago during the next three
weeks. A lot of the clearing will be
done during the next three days.
On first thought, you wonder if
Rev. Gilkey has not undertaken a
pretty big job. On second thought—
said second thought coming after you
have met the man and felt the
strength and realized the depth of his
character —you conclude that Rev.
Gilkey can put the doubts to rout if
any one can.
Does Not Overawe Visitor.
Rev. Gilkey is not the type of man
who overawes you while you are in
his presence. As a matter of fact, you
and Rev. Gilkey are a couple of pals
while you are together, and it is not
until you are alone and thinking of
your interview that you begin to feel
the influence of your man.
Warns His Audience.
Here comes a man who is perfectly
fair with his audience. "I want every
one of you to know just what he is
getting into before lie comes to my
lecture," said Rev. Gilkey, with char
acteristic frankness. "I know every
one is busy, and I wouldn't blame the
students if they didn't come. I'll be
interested to see how many of them
are there, though."
If Rev. Gilkey has an interest in
everyone present, as you feel sure he
has, it is a fairly safe bet that he
will be forced to stretch said interest
to a good healthy scope tonight.
"Here's what I'm trying to do,"
said Rev. Gilkey, frankly. "I've writ
ten out my introduction, and you can
print that. We'll be fair." Rev.
Gilkey was once a college journalist
at Harvard.
Gives Out Introduction.
Accordingly, The Daily Palo Alto
prints the following, that it and Rev.
Gilkey entice no one to tonight's lec
ture. It is Rev. Gilkey's introduction,
which you are likely to miss if you
don't get into the Little Theater by
7:30 sharp.
"In every great American university
at the present time, there are a con
siderable number of students who are
very much up in the air about relig
ion. Many of these were brought up
in Christian homes and were taught
there and in church the orthodox
Christianity of the last generation:
but coming to college, they find them
selves in a new social and intellectual
world, where the tight little theology
of their childhood, at least as they
understood it, no longer seems to fit;
and they are naturally wondering
whether there is anything in the re
ligion of their fathers or not. Then
there are those whose home training
was not particularly religious; but
who have discovered from their read
ing and study at the University some
thing of the history, thought, and
life: and as intelligent men and
women are not willing (as unhap
pily so many American students seem
to be) to go through life ignorant
or indifferent as to so great and fund
amental a human interest.
"Now it is to all these, who, to
borrow a happy phrase from old Sir
Henry Vane, belong to 'the sect callcd
Seekers.' that these three lectures are
frankly addressed."
