# YE ARISTOCRACY

### 
Representing the humble and pleb
ian majority whose paltry incomes
barely permit a slim expenditure for
the necessities of existence, we wish
to heartily endorse the restrictions
placed upon the Stanford aristocracy.
Ever since the opening of the fall
semester, campus pedestrians have
worn a haunted and harrowed ex
pression, thai comes from the pursuit
of gasoline hounds. Those who hun
ger for the quiet solitude and peace of
slumber have found relaxation impos
sible, due to the music of unclosed
mufflers, and antics of speed maniacs.

That the great body of campus resi
dents should suffer on account of the
recklessness and negligence of a few
thoughtless drivers is intolerable. The
overhanging threat of hiring men for
the purpose of strictly enforcing the
speed and closcd muffler regulations
is one which involves the integrity of
student self-government. Hereafter,
the owners of automobiles and motor
cycles had best curtail their joy-riding
instincts for the common welfare, so
that in the future complaint will be
unnecessary.
