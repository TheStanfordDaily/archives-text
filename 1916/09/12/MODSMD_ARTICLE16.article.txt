Stanford has always been proud of
The Five Hundred, but today's happen
ings would rather place the gentler
sex in the role of parlor ornament,
than a wide-awake and important link
in the University life. Following
columns of publicity, the election for
the position of president of the
Women's Athletic Association resulted
in but a scattered handful turning out
at the polls. The magnificent total of
fifty-nine votes cast presents a pretty
accurate picture of the interest dis
played by the women in campus ac
tivities. it would seem as if the op
portunity of casting a ballot was re
garded more in the light of a dreaded
sewing bee, than a privilege and duty.
Yet they whimper about women's suf
frage—more food for the squirrels.
