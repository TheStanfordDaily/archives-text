SPIRITS OF '96.
The scenery is that corner of the
Quad which was cued with the most
English. Two graduates are observed
observing the Thomas YVelton Stan
ford Museum, now in course of con
struction as the tirst unit of a new
quadrangle.
First Grad.—How dost like the new
musee?
Second Grad.—Rather a shame,
think I, to use that fine corner for
that!
First —Verily, 'tis a good location
for a libe.
Second—l wasn't thinking of a li
brary !
First —No?
Second No! That corner was
never made to hold even books.
First —Right you are! (he removes
his hat and blots a brow of per
spiration with a bookstore blotter).
Second —That corner was only made
for one item! (he licks his lips with
his own tongue).
First —(hailing a passing jitney) —
I have you Stephano! And you have
spaken words of wisdom. The Lord
meant that corner for but one variety
of structure. REDWOOD CITY,
PRESTO! (this last was to the chauf
feur, who, understanding, spoke a
quiet word to the Ford, which know
ingly turned its nose in the most
proper direction, and galloped on).
(Author's Note—Undoubtedly many
undergraduates will heartily endorse
the views of these men of '96 that the
Post Oflice should be located adjoin
ing the Quad.)
