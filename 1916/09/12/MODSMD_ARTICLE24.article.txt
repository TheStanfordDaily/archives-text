# WOMEN'S POOL PROMISES TO BE POPULAR
## 
### 
Swimming is proving to be one of
the biggest attractions ever offered
to Stanford women. Already three
hundred students have registered in
regular classes, and this number does
not include those women who will
swim at irregular hours. This large
registration has necessitated the form
ing of a number of new classes,
among which are separate classes for
faculty and alumnae, faculty children
and university assistants; moreover,
as soon as all the women of the Uni
versity have been provided for, special
classes will be formed for the Palo
Alto public schools, Castilleja, and
Marker's school.
The equipment of the new tempor
ary building rank the new pool as one
of the most complete on the coast.
There are special rooms for suits, for
laundry, for hair-drying, all supplied
with apparatus; there are eighteen
white enameled showers and seventy
two dressing rooms; there will be
abundant mirror space; the buildings
and the pool will be electric-lighted;
the rooms will be steam-heated; and
the water for the pool will be heated
and constantly refiltered.
Some of the special features are, an
adjustable springboard designed by
Mr. Ernest Bransten of Encina gym
nasium, a high dive, and apparatus
for water polo. The reading room,
which in past years has proved of
such interest at Roble gymnasium,
has been transferred to the new gym
nasium, and will be open at any time
to all women of the University.
