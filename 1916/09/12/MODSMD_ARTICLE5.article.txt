Speed and closed-muffler regulations
on the campus and University grounds
will be strictly enforced hereafter, ac
cording to a statement issued this af
ternoon by Student Adviser W. P.
Staniford, '16. When near the Quad
and residences, motorists must not
exceed fifteen miles an hour. Else
where on the estato the limit is twen
ty-five miles per hour. Mufflers must
be closed at all times near the Quad
rangle.
Unless student motorists cease to in
fringe these rules, the University au
thorities state that they will have to
employ special officers to prevent the
possibility of accidents in the future.
If this move is taken, offenders will
be kept from using their machines on
the estate, and if the offense is seri
ous, dismissal of the guilty student
may result.
Student Adviser Stamford's state
ment follows:
St an i ford's Statement.
"The attention of all drivers of
motor vehicles is called to the fact
that the speed and closed-muffler reg
ulations on the estate will be en
forced. In the vicinity of the instruc
tion buildings and residences, a
fifteen miles per hour is allowed; else
where on the roads of the estate which
arc open, the limit is twenty-five
miles per hour. Mufflers must be
kept closed at all times near the
Quadrangle.
May Have Speed "Cops."
"Though the University authorities
do not wish to subject campus motor
ists to a rigid speed censorship, they
do not intend to wait until a serious
accident occurs before adopting pre
ventive measures. Any continued in
fringement of the regulations will re
sult in the employment of special of
ficers.
"Offenders will then be apprehend
ed, and will be prevented from using
their vehicles on the estate. In ag
gravated cases of violation of the reg
ulations, the guilty students will face
the grave danger of dismissal.
Danger of Accidents.
"Due to the fast and reckless driv
ing of students in automobiles and ou
motorcycles this semester, several mis
haps have been narrowly averted.
Complete disregard for the safety of
pedestrians, and of people in other
vehicles has been displayed by stu
dents who possess motor conveyances.
Most tourists and visitors drive at
moderate rates of speed.
"Drivers who in the past have made
themselves public nuisances should for
their own benefit and for that of
others, live within the regulations.
(Signed) "PAUL STANIFORD,
"Student Adviser."
