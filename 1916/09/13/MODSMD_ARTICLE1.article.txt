# SENIORS ARE 8-3 VICTORS OVER JUNIORS
## HARD FIGHT OFFERED Interclass Rugby Title to Be Decided Tomorrow Night on Turf 
### 
Establishing their right to meet the
sophomores for the annual interclass
championship, to be played next
Thursday, the seniors defeated the
juniors yesterday afternoon in one
of the best rugby battles seen this
season, the final score reading 8 to
3. The game was played before a
large crowd of rooters representing
their respective classes, and was an
even contest from the start till the
time-keeper's gun was fired. In fact
it was a contest even after this, for
the play continued six minutes after
the final whistle.
First Half Scoreless.
The first half ended without either
side scoring, the play having see-sawed
from one end of the field to the other,
featured by the backfleld runs of
the seniors and the excellent defen
sive of the juniors. "Dink" Temple
ton was much in evidence during the
second period, his long kicks to touch
being a prominent feature of the
game. The lone three points of the
third year men were made on a drop
kick by Templeton after being award
ed a free kick by Referee "Ric" Tem
pleton.
Kester and Halsted counted the
seniors' points, both going over for
trys, the latter converting one of the
touchdowns. The seniors were weak
ened by the loss of some of their best
players. Sample, Swigart, and Bra
den were kept out of the game on ac
count of injuries, and Lachmund and
Carroll played only part of the game.
The lineups were as follows:
Seniors —Kester, Scott, and Single,
front rank; Pettingill and Murray,
middle rank; Gladstone, Halsted, and
Hayes, (Fisher), rear rank; Tedford,
