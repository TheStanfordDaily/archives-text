# ARMY INSTRUCTOR ARRIVES ON CAMPUS
## AWAITS ORDERS HERE Training Expected to Start on Monday Under Direction of Major Bugge 
### 
Major Jens Bugge, or the 21st U. S.
Infantry, who has been recommended
to the War department by General
Franklin Bell as the best man for the
position of military instructor at Stan
ford, arrived in Palo Alto yesterday
afternoon. Although he has not yet
received his official appointment, due
partly to official red tape, Major Bugge
has offered his services to President
Wilbur, and is ready to take what
ever steps are deemed advisable under
the circumstances.
Start Work .Monday.
It is probable that nothing can be
done until Monday, when the non
commissioned officers from Fort Doug
las, Utah, arrive to assist in direct
ing the work. Following their com
ing, drills will be held every day for
a short time in order to make up for
the time lost at the beginning of the
semester. The work will be by no
means limited to drilling, according
to Major Bugge, but will also include
training in camp and battlefield tac
tics, and rifle practice, if arrange
ments can be made for the construc
tion of pits.
Expects Big Success.
"I look for a big success in the
military training at Stanford. The
University is big enough to have a
department of military instruction,
and I fee] sure that the number of
students enrolled will increase rap
idly. That one hundred and fifty or
more men are already signed up for
the work insures a good start. About
the first thing to do will be to select
student officers to take charge of
squads of men. College students al
ways advance more rapidly than the
average army 'rookie.' "
Jttajor Bugge a Young Mam.
Major Bugge is a young man,
though his hair has begun to silver,
and he is the kind of a man who
understands young men. His experi
ence in summer camps throughout
the country, and as instructor in the
War College at Washington, has fitted
him for just the kind of problems to
be met in the military training at
Stanford.
He closed up his business affairs in
Los Angeles and motored up to Palo
Alto in order to be able to begin work
as soon as possible. He will rent a
house in Palo for himself and
his family, which consists of his wife
and two little yellow-haired children.
