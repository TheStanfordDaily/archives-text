## Stanford Is Denied the Right of Franchise in Coming Election 
### 
Uecause residents of almshouses,
asylums and institutions of learning
"do not gain or lose a residence by
virtue of their being there," accord
ing to state law, Stanford students
will be denied the right of franchise
at the coming general election, and
at any following election.
It is this clause, often labeled a
! "joker," which prevents students from
obtaining the privilege and exercis
ing their duty of casting a ballot
at any election, according to persons
acquainted with the voting laws.
And because students "do not gain
or lose a residence" while in an in
stitution of learning, Stanford stu
dents will not be able to secure on
the campus that prerequisite of every
voterâ€”the establishment of resi
dence.
Itenjaniin's Opinion.
As recently stated in a letter from
Raymond Benjamin, deputy state at
torney-general, which was printed in
The Daily Palo Alto, "residence is a
pure question of intention, and the
fact that a young man is a student at
the University does not compel him
to claim the home of his parents as
his home. . .
However, Deputy County Clerk
O'Neill, of San Jose, stated emphatic
ally today that residence is more
than a matter of intention.
"There must be an actual removal,"
Mr. O'Neill said. "A person must cut
loose from his former place of resi
dence. He must evidence no inten
tion of returning. The matter of
whether or not a student is self-sup
porting or not does not concern his
right to vote."
Assistant Registrar J. E. McDowell,
who registers voters in this precinct,
said last night that he would follow
the instructions of the county clerk's
office. This means that students will
be denied the right to vote unless
they can show, to the satisfaction of
Mr. McDowell, that they "have es
tablished residence" at Stanford.
According to Deputy County Clerk
O'Neill, it is up to Mr. McDowell en
tirely to decide if a student has made
Stanford his residence. Effort to
reach Deputy Attorney-General Ben
jamin in San Francisco today was un
successful.
