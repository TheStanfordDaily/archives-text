## Stanford Is Denied the Right of Franchise in Coming Election 
### 
Uecause residents of almshouses,
asylums and institutions of learning
"do not gain or lose a residence by
virtue of their being there," accord
ing to state law, Stanford students
will be denied the right of franchise
at the coming general election, and
at any following election.
It is this clause, often labeled a
! "joker," which prevents students from
obtaining the privilege and exercis
ing their duty of casting a ballot
at any election, according to persons
acquainted with the voting laws.
And because students "do not gain
or lose a residence" while in an in
stitution of learning, Stanford stu
dents will not be able to secure on
the campus that prerequisite of every
voterâ€”the establishment of resi
dence.
Itenjaniin's Opinion.
As recently stated in a letter from
Raymond Benjamin, deputy state at
torney-general, which was printed in
The Daily Palo Alto, "residence is a
pure question of intention, and the
fact that a young man is a student at
the University does not compel him
to claim the home of his parents as
his home. . .
However, Deputy County Clerk
O'Neill, of San Jose, stated emphatic
ally today that residence is more
than a matter of intention.
"There must be an actual removal,"
