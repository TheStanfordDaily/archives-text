According to advices received from
the county clerk, there seems to exist
a disagreement among political officials
of the state as to whether Stanford
students of voting age should be per
mitted suffrage privileges. From
present indications, it would appear
that a more thorough understanding
of the situation would clear up the
difficulties with the resulting voting
rights authorized.

Until the present year, Stanford
students were denied full prerogative
of suffrage, being classed with luna
tics and paupers on the grounds of
non-support. Through the grace of
the chief deputy attorney-general of
the state of California, the stigma of
such a classification was removed two
weeks back and balloting privileges
simultaneously granted. Today the
county clerk again withholds from stu
dents the right to vote, this time on
the grounds of non-residence.

Despite this edict, the law distinct
ly provides that anyone of age,
attending an institution of learning,
may establish a voting residence at
the University. That a misunder
standing should prevent Stanford stu
dents from exercising the sacred right
of voice in public affairs is neither
justifiable or conceivable. The situa
tion in respect to students at Stan
ford is. no wise different from that of
the Berkeley student, where one is
entitled to establish a residence at the
college, register and vote. It is not
the intention of Stanford students to
meddle with Palo Alto politics, but
they do, as a University unit, insist
upon having a voice in affairs of such
importance as the presidential elec
tion, November 7.
