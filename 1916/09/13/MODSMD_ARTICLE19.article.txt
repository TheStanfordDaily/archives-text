# Kicks to Touch
## 
### 
"Dink" Templeton looks better
every time he steps on the field. His
kicking is always a feature for ac
curacy and distance, the forwards
being saved much of the usual run
ning back and forth on account of
"Dink's" habit of always finding touch.
* * *
The backfield of the juniors was in
evidence more on defense than of
ferrse yesterday. The work of Walker,
Henry, and Heron standing out, the
former saving many dribbling rushes
by falling on the ball and the latter
two featuring by their heavy tackling.
♦ * ♦
Sam Ilalsted has joined the ranks
of goal kickers. His percentage
stands 500 so far, as he converted
one try and missed on the other at
tempt. The tall forward is putting
up a good game in the scrum this sea
son.
* * *
Trainer "Doc" Reynolds states that
his list of cripples is decreasing rap
idly. Braden is ready for the game
now, Laclimund played for a few
minutes yesterday, Winham will be off
crutches by the end of the week, and
although Phil Sample had to go to the
hospital on account of an infection
in one eye set up by a fingernail
scratch, he will be in good shape in
a few days.
* * *
The third year men claim that the
seniors changed their backfield so
many times during the game yester
day that they did not know what
man to mark. It would take a mathe
matician to follow this: Townsend re
places Tedford at half, Carroll re
places Meese at five-eighths, Meese
taking Phillips' place on the wing,
Lachmund replaces Carroll, Carroll re
placing Dievendorf, and Dievendorf re
placing Meese. Looks like a game of
chess. I

The College of Pacific football team
of last year seems to be well repre

Meese, Marriott, Butterficld, and
Needlmm all playing on Stanford
teams this season.
