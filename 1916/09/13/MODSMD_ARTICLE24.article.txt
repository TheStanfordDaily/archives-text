# Professor Stillman Praised as Educator
## Charles H. Shinn Says Vice President's Teaching Is Inspired 
### 
Professor John Maxson Stillraan,
vice-president of the University, is
given much praise by Charles H. Shinn
in an article of Prominent Califor
nians published in a recent issue of the
Fresno Republican. Extracts from
the article follow:
"A third Californian who is worthy
of remembrance among the thinkers
is Dr. John M. Stillman of Stanford,
son of the late Dr. J. D. Stillman, a
noted San Francisco physician. He,
our John M., is a home product, plus
the best of Germany, and his trail up
the rocks has been and is that of the
chemist. He has not published much
except technical papers now and then,
but he belongs to everything in his
line, and his teaching is of the inspired
order. The chemist can be about as
big as they make them, too; he has to
know physics, mathematics and phil
osophy, his world goes very far, and
so keeps on into infinite distance.
Wise, gentle, and fairly shining with
"the inner light," this pleasant Cali
fornian goes right along in his work
of making experts in chemistry over at
Stanford. He happens to be vice-presi
dent there, also. As the years pass,
he more and more reminds one of the
late "Dr. Jo" Le Conte of Berkeley.
Sum them up: Stillman, Royce, How
ison, Buckham! It is men such as
these who are creating our future
California."
