# MUST REALIZE YOUR IDEALS, SAYS GILKEY
## 
### 
If the "sect called Seekers" did not
feel that one portion of their search
was completed after last night's lec
ture in the Little Theater, it was not
the fault of Rev. Charles W. Gilkey,
who went about clearing up religious
and spiritual doubts in a straight
from-the-shoulder manner.
The problem of religion is the "ac
tualizing of an ideal," according to
Rev. Gilkey. "Christianity offers to us
the combination of a moral sense of
responsibility toward fellow men, and
a religious life of action. This dis
tinctive and unique thing in Christian
ity is the personality of Jesus. His
power is felt by the millions of people
bound together by a common right
for nineteen centuries, and in the ac
knowledged fact that Christianity is
the only one of the great religions of
the world in which the power of re
form has been the central power."
To Rev. Gilkey, the essentials of this
religion are not found in dogmas, in
apostolic theology or even in the
teachings of Jesus, but in great forces
making ideals work. Much has been
said against the church, but even the
most radical have admired the won
derfully inspiring personality of Jesus,
which might best be explained by that
teaching—"Then shall the dust return
unto the earth as it was, but the spirit
shall return unto the God who gave
it."
Tomorrow evening Rev. Gilkey will
give the second of his series of three
evening lectures, his subject being
"The Authority of Jesus." As usual
the lecture will be held in the Little
Theater, and will begin promptly at
7:30 o'clock.
