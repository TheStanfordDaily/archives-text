# OVER THIRTY GO TO FIGHT FIRE
## Professor C.B. Wing Calls for Volunteersâ€”Blaze More Threatening 
### 
Answering the call for additional
fire fighters to combat the blaze now
sweeping the mountains back of the
campus, over thirty students under
the leadership of Student Body Presi
dent T. E. Swigart left the campus
at 4 o'clock this afternoon enroute to
the scene of the fire, about half-way
to the coast. Most of the men an
swering the call are upperclassmen
registering in the Engineering depart
ment.
Professor C. B. Wing has been in
the mountains most of the day and
late this afternoon communicated to
Swigart, stating that help was needed
and requesting him to obtain at least
thirty (volunteers. After the ward
spread that help was needed, the
number of volunteers far exceeded the
capacity of the big auto truck sup
plied for the purpose. More men are
anxious to go if those enroute are
not enough. Undoubtedly the men
will not return until late tomorrow.
Among those who have gone are:
F. Schwarzenbeck, '18, C. R. Swarts,
