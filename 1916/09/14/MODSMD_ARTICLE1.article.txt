# ANITA ALLEN BACK FROM ARCTIC TRIP
## TO ATTEND COLUMBIA Stanford Polar Circle Exploress to Spend Week Here Before Going East 
### 
"What's the best thing I've seen
this summer? Why," replied Anita
Allen, '17, former Daily Palo Alto
Women's editor, Cap and Gown mem
ber, and many other things, "it's
Stanford."
Which is fine stuff to begin a val
uable interview. This is a valuable
interview, for if it were printed in
a Nome, Alaska, newspaper the size
of The Daily Palo A,lto, it would
cost you twenty-five cents to secure
a copy.
Saw Little!
Anita Allen says she saw and did
little of interest. The following
things which she says she saw are re
spectfully submitted as interesting, ice
bergs, seals, whaling schooners, min
ing camps, Arctic explorers, Eskimos,
high prices, and thousands of people.
All she did was make a trip long
enough to carry her half way around
the world, and visit the farthest north
town in Alaska.
Had Anita Allen's plans material
ized she would have spent several
months in the frozen Arctic Circle
searching for the North Pole, in the
staunchest and most modern explor
ing vessel ever built. Papers all
along the coast ran accounts of her
plans, for the Stanford explorcss
would have been the first white
woman to penetrate to distant icy
lands of the north.
Anita Allen did not reach the Arc
tic Circle, as she planned, but it was
not her fault. While she was wait
ing in Nome for the "Great Bear," the
exploring ship captained by her uncle,
Louis L. Lane, the boat struck a rock
off the coast of Alaska. It is still
on the rock, slowly being battered
to pieces, while Captain Lane and
John Borden of Chicago, who financed
the expedition, are building a new and
still better vessel, in which to travel
north next year.
"I spent six weeks in Nome," said
Anita Allen, who arrived home last
night, and who is being greeted today
by her friends, "principally doing
nothing. There wasn't anything to
do, except meet people who remem
bered me from the time I was a little
kid, and who were ever telling me
how 1 used to look in overalls."
Be it known, though, that "doing
nothing" to Anita Allen, includes
riding horseback, fishing, boating,
dancing, interviewing and recuper-

ating in health. This latter she did
well. "I gained twenty pounds," she
said, confidentially, "but don't tell
anybody." So please remember, don't
tell anybody.
Captain Lane and his crew were
forced to spend two weeks on an
island near the rock on which the
"Great Bear" was stranded. For
tunately, they were able to remove
practically all their supplies to the
island from the "Great Bear," and
they led a Robinson Crusoe life de

luxe,-with phonographs, fine meals
and delicious desserts, and in fact, all
of the comforts of a modern ship, at
their disposal. "Isn't it awful that I
wasn't along for that wreck!" ex
claimed our adventuress. "Just see
what T missed. I might have lost
everything but a sweater and an odd
skirt in the crash, but think of the
fun."
Leaving Thursday for Columbia
does not give Anita Allen much time
at Stanford. She will leave for New
York to study a year at the Pulitzer
Journalism school, living with Miss
Edith Mirrielees, and Mrs. Theresa
Russell of the English department of
Stanford. A year from now she plans
to come back to Stanford to complete
advanced work and get her master's
degree.
