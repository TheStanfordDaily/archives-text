# ANITA ALLEN BACK FROM ARCTIC TRIP
## TO ATTEND COLUMBIA Stanford Polar Circle Exploress to Spend Week Here Before Going East

"What's the best thing I've seen
this summer? Why," replied Anita
Allen, '17, former Daily Palo Alto
Women's editor, Cap and Gown mem
ber, and many other things, "it's
Stanford."
Which is fine stuff to begin a val
uable interview. This is a valuable
interview, for if it were printed in
a Nome, Alaska, newspaper the size
of The Daily Palo A,lto, it would
cost you twenty-five cents to secure
a copy.
Saw Little!
Anita Allen says she saw and did
little of interest. The following
things which she says she saw are re
spectfully submitted as interesting, ice
bergs, seals, whaling schooners, min
ing camps, Arctic explorers, Eskimos,
high prices, and thousands of people.
All she did was make a trip long
enough to carry her half way around
the world, and visit the farthest north
town in Alaska.
Had Anita Allen's plans material

months in the frozen Arctic Circle
searching for the North Pole, in the
staunchest and most modern explor
ing vessel ever built. Papers all
along the coast ran accounts of her
plans, for the Stanford explorcss
