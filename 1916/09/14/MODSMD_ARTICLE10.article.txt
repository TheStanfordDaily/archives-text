# CO-EDUCATION CRITICISED BY DEAN BARROWS

."Girls are more mature and more
docile than men. They learn faster
than men, and for that reason it is an
injustice to the men to keep them in
classes together," said Dean Barrows
of California, in an interview this
morning, when questioned regarding
an article in the San Francisco ex
aminer, yesterday, which stated that
both President Wilbur and Dean Bar
rows had been rebuked by President
Wheeler of the University of Cali
fornia, for criticising co-education in
an after-dinner speech.
"I would start special classes in
the University where boys would be
segregated from girls. I believe in
co-educational life â€” outside of
classes," said Dean Barrows. "Co
education is very wholesome and
splendid, but girls should be trained
as girls, not as men. I believe the
general trend toward segregation is
becoming stronger and stronger."
In the Examiner, President Wilbur
is quoted as saying "I do not believe
there exists quite the same feeling
in the two great universities of Cali
fornia that exists at Mills or any
other college devoted exclusively to
the needs of women." In the inter
view this morning he did not make
any further statement of his views.
