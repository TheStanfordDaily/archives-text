# ASSEMBLY ENJOYS DEAN BARROWS' LECTURE
## WAR STORIES APPEAL Speaker Praises Work Done by Herbert Hoover in Belgium 
### 
Dean David P. Barrows of the Uni
versity of California knows how to
tell stories. Stanford men and women
are agreed on that, after hearing him
tell vividly this morning of conditions
as ho found them in Belgium, France,
and England.
Sane and Calm Opinions.
Dean Harrows has lived through
what he saw in Europe, and has
thought about it sufficiently to form
sane and calm opinions. His lesßon
to Stanford people is, "I-iord Morely
says, 'Beware of crusades, they don't
pay. I have been an optimist, but
if the United States enters this war
1 will lose my confidence in human
ity.' Lord Morely is the anti-war man
of England.
"Was he right? I don't know. I've
thought it over many weeks, and I
am still inclined to doubt. Nations
have to look out for themselves. You
have to balance the motto of 'safety
first' against the maxim of Napoleon
to 'live dangerously.'
"Let's choose a middle way, cer
tainly, but be prepared on occasion
to take the heroic part, men and
women of Stanford, even though life
is the cost."
Describing Herbert C. Hoover, '96,
as the greatest man that the state of
California has trained and given to
the service of the world, Dean Har
rows told of the responsibility of the
head of the Belgian Relief Commis
sion.
"The situation in Belgium is so ex
traordinary," said Dean Barrows, af
ter comparing feeding of ten million
Belgians to that of feeding all the
men in the western armies of both
the Allies and the Germans, "so ex
traordinary, that if Mr. Hoover lost
heart tomorrow or died, in a few days
the Belgians would be without food
and starving."
With true economic insight Dean
Harrows traced the dependence of
foreign countries on the American
wheat crop and the American mar
ket.
Portrays Important Scenes.
Scenes in the House of Commons
during the Irish rebellion, battle
scenes, and places familiar to news
paper readers through their presence
in daily headlines, were described by
Dean Barrows from first hand obser
vation. In one French forest, now
held by Germans, he encountered a
group of many graves where a whole
French battallion had been caught
unawares by the Germans and anni
hilated. Simple German crosses only,
with legends that "Here lies a brave
French soldier," mark the graves of
these men in this somber forest.

Portrays Important Scenes.
Scenes in the House of Commons
during the Irish rebellion, battle
scenes, and places familiar to news
paper readers through their presence
in daily headlines, were described by
Dean Barrows from first hand obser
vation. In one French forest, now
held by Germans, he encountered a
group of many graves where a whole
French battallion had been caught
unawares by the Germans and anni
hilated. Simple German crosses only,
with legends that "Here lies a brave
French soldier," mark the graves of
these men in this somber forest.
Dean David P. Barrows of the Uni
versity of California knows how to
tell stories. Stanford men and women
are agreed on that, after hearing him
tell vividly this morning of conditions
as ho found them in Belgium, France,
and England.
Sane and Calm Opinions.
Dean Harrows has lived through
what he saw in Europe, and has
thought about it sufficiently to form
sane and calm opinions. His lesßon
to Stanford people is, "I-iord Morely
says, 'Beware of crusades, they don't
pay. I have been an optimist, but
if the United States enters this war
1 will lose my confidence in human
ity.' Lord Morely is the anti-war man
of England.
"Was he right? I don't know. I've
thought it over many weeks, and I
am still inclined to doubt. Nations
have to look out for themselves. You
have to balance the motto of 'safety
first' against the maxim of Napoleon
to 'live dangerously.'
"Let's choose a middle way, cer
tainly, but be prepared on occasion
to take the heroic part, men and
women of Stanford, even though life
is the cost."
Describing Herbert C. Hoover, '96,
as the greatest man that the state of
California has trained and given to
the service of the world, Dean Har
rows told of the responsibility of the
head of the Belgian Relief Commis
sion.
"The situation in Belgium is so ex
traordinary," said Dean Barrows, af
ter comparing feeding of ten million
Belgians to that of feeding all the
men in the western armies of both
the Allies and the Germans, "so ex
traordinary, that if Mr. Hoover lost
heart tomorrow or died, in a few days
the Belgians would be without food
and starving."
With true economic insight Dean
Harrows traced the dependence of
foreign countries on the American
wheat crop and the American mar
ket.
