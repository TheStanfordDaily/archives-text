This forenoon's assembly brought
once more into public light the dearth
of songs appropriate for genuine
Stanford use. In an effort to increase
the number of Cardinal ballads and
ditties, the Executive Committee last
week voted prizes for the best orig
inal songs composed and penned by
local talent. One may yodel any
number of contentious bleacher
lyrics, but with the exception of
"Come Join the Band" and "Hail
Stanford Hail," such a thing as an
honest to goodness unadulterated
Stanford song does not exist. Despite
the fact that the thought of sending
California to perdition has merit, yet
the expression of the idea on all oc
casions, especially in the presence of
visiting blue and gold professors, be
comes tiresome. Herein a rare op
portunity is afforded campus musical
artists to rid their Alma Mater of a
long-standing grievance, by composing
a bona fide Stanford song.
