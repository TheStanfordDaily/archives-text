Experience secured through meet
ing one's fellow men and the result
ing friendships gained, may be classed
as one of the seven wonders of uni
versity training. Tomorrow after
noon all Stanford newcomers are
granted the privilege of not only
shaking hands with but becoming well
acquainted with their President and
the thirty members of the University
Conference at Dr. Wilbur's recep
tion. Although reception is the of
ficial title, yet in truth the occasion
will be a garden party sparkling with
entertainment and merriment. All
roads, between the hours of 4 and 0,
tomorrow afternoon, should lead to
the President's home in Palo Alto.
