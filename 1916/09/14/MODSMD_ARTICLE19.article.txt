# Band Dance Date Is Set for This Month
## 
### 
The first band dance of the year
will be given Friday evening, Sep
tember 29, in the Armory at Palo Alto.
Permission to use the Encina gymnas
ium floor could not be obtained, as
dancing on it spoils the door for bas
ketball games. The band, which is
in excellent shape this year, con
taining over forty pieces, promises a
list of popular selections for the af
fair. Tickets will be placed on sale
at the Pookstore in the near future.
