### 
Recruiting fire fighters on the cam
pus is the latest. Escaping from re
cruiting officers has become the new
est indoor sport.
Last evening, when a fire warden
telephoned to several Stanford fra
ternities announcing that it would be
necessary for all University men to
turn out and oppose the onrushing
flames, conversation gave way to con
sternation.
Later, when a group of men fra
ternizing around the festive board
heard a heavy step upon their front
porch, they trembled. When they
heard the door bell vibrate vigorously
they had had enough. Via the near
est window the room was emptied of
its human contents, which, then, in
dividually, took to the woods.
Over in the Beta Theta Pi fratern
ity, joy reigned. The "fire-warden"
at the telephone, as he rang each cam
pus fraternity, ordering them to turn
out, grinned elatedly, with the feeling
that he had accomplished a good day's
labor.
