# Sophomores Hold Jolly-Up Tomorrow
## 
### 
Friday evening, September 15, at 8
o'clock, is the time.
The Women's Clulr House is the
place.
This is the verdict of the Sopho
more Jolly-Up Committee, which met
last night. As no other date is avail
able until the middle of October, the
committee was forced to rush things
and decided upon tomorrow night as
the time for the 1919 get-together.
Surprises in the way of eats will be
the novelty sprung this year and the
committee guarantees that no one
will go away hungry. One of the
best three-piece orchestras on the
campus will furnish the music and
straight dances as well as cut-ins are
promised. A cordial invitation is ex
tended to transfer and freshmen girls
but for all except these honored
guests, a tax of fifty cents will be
levied. Despite its late announce
ment, all sophomores are expected to
turn out to make this Jolly-Up a suc
cess. â€¢
