# FIRE BREAKS OUT ANEW DESPITE FIGHTERS
## BREEZES FAN FLAMES All Night Vigil by Students Results in Great Headway Against Blaze 
### C.A. Randau, '19 
Due to a fresh outbreak in the
forest fire in the hills back of the
Charles Deering ranch, five miles
southwest of Los Altos, thirty ad
ditional student fire fighters left
the campus late this afternoon in
response to a call from Professor
C. B. Wing and Student Rody
President T. E. Swigart. The
thirty will join and later relieve
the fifteen students who remained
over from last night's vigil. At
noon today the fire was thought to
be under control, but was fanned
into fresh fury by the incoming
ocean breezes.

Within twenty-four hours after
being placed in charge of the forces
which arc fighting the forest fire
which has been burning in the Santa
Cruz mountains since Sunday fore
noon, Professor C. 13. Wing of the
Engineering department, this after
noon has the situation well in
hand. At noon, yesterday, Professor
Wing received instructions from the
state forest supervisor at Sacramento
requesting his aid in combating the
onrushing flames, and asking that he
assume charge of the fire fighters.
Calls for Volunteers.
lie left immediately for the scene
of the fire, and after making a hasty
survey of the situation, sent word to
Student Body President Swigart that
thirty men were needed at once. More
than the required number of students
answered the call, and from 4 o'clock
yesterday afternoon, until this after
noon, Stanford men have taken a
prominent part in the fighting.
Though a few of the men left for
home early this morning, the larger
number were retained to prevent new
outbreaks.
Sororities Furnish "Grub."
While Stanford men were battling
with the flames, the women of the
University were doing their part in
furnishing food. At 8 o'clock last
night, the Stanford Illustrated Re
view, with the co-operation of Grad
uate Manager Behrens, sent out an
auto loaded with supplies prepared by
the sororities. On arriving at that
part of the fire nearest the campus
' and adjoining the Letcher ranch, which
I can be distinguished from the campus
by the three bright lights buring on
the top of the mountain each evening,
! the "rescuers" found that the Stan
| ford squad had been divided into three
j divions. One group, under the lead
! ership of T. E. Swigart, was engaged
in assisting a squad from San Jose
!in back-firing, below the Letcher
ranch house. The second group, but
| a short distance to the south, was
! clearing a strip fifty feet wide the en
j tire way across a deep, wide gulch.
The third and largest of the Stan
ford groups was engaged at the ex
treme southern end of the fire, where
the flames momentarily threatened to
; wipe out the beautiful "Hidden
Villa," the home of Charles Deering.
Here professor Wing himself was
directing the attack, and by the fre
j quent use of the mountain telephone
' lines was able to keep in touch with
the headway being made at other
places on the mountains.

yesterday afternoon are as follows:
