# BABES DEFEAT PALY RUGGERS
## Fast Backfield Plays Feature First Midweek Game of Season 
### 
Playing the first game of a series of
three, the Stanford freshmen defeated
the Palo Alto high school rugby team
yesterday afternoon on the Cardinal
turf, the final score reading 24 to 5.
The game was a good exhibition of
rugby, although ragged in spots. It
was distinctly a star's contest, three
or four players standing out prom
inently for their excellent work.
First Half Speedy.
The first half was the better of the
two, the high school team playing its
best in this period. Scofield got away
for a 45-yard run for the visitors,
which resulted in the first score of
the game, the try being converted by
Green. The freshmen tied the count
when Larkin broke through and
passed to Needham, who scored, and
then converted the touchdown. The
only real passing rush of the day was
executed here, the ball going from
Larkin to Risling to Angell to Strong
to Needham, who went over for an
other count, the conversion failing.
Larkin went across for three more
points a few minutes later, and Need
ham converted a difficult one, bring
ing the score of the first half up to
13 to 5.
With a much changed lineup, the
1920 squad had things all their own
way in the second period, although
4 'Pally" put up a stubborn resist
ance at times, led by Green and Nagel.
Angell did some good booting for the
first-year men, and the scrum seemed
to get the ball out better than in the
early part of the game. Three trys
and one conversion brough the final
count up to 24, the high school dele
gation not being able to cross the line
again. Lockhart Card refereed a
good game. The lineups follow:
Freshmen—Wayland, James and Ar
nott, (Henry, Swift), front rank; Mil
lington and Atchison, (Bowden, Mc-
Cartney), middle rank; Snook, Tilton

gell, (Rogers, Joerge), five-eighths

ham converted a difficult one, bring
ing the score of the first half up to
13 to 5.
With a much changed lineup, the
1920 squad had things all their own
way in the second period, although
4 'Pally" put up a stubborn resist
ance at times, led by Green and Nagel.
Angell did some good booting for the
first-year men, and the scrum seemed
to get the ball out better than in the
early part of the game. Three trys
and one conversion brough the final
count up to 24, the high school dele
gation not being able to cross the line
again. Lockhart Card refereed a
good game. The lineups follow:
Freshmen—Wayland, James and Ar
nott, (Henry, Swift), front rank; Mil
lington and Atchison, (Bowden, Mc-
Cartney), middle rank; Snook, Tilton

Playing the first game of a series of
three, the Stanford freshmen defeated
the Palo Alto high school rugby team
yesterday afternoon on the Cardinal
turf, the final score reading 24 to 5.
The game was a good exhibition of
rugby, although ragged in spots. It
was distinctly a star's contest, three
or four players standing out prom
inently for their excellent work.
First Half Speedy.
The first half was the better of the
two, the high school team playing its
best in this period. Scofield got away
for a 45-yard run for the visitors,
which resulted in the first score of
the game, the try being converted by
Green. The freshmen tied the count
when Larkin broke through and
passed to Needham, who scored, and
then converted the touchdown. The
only real passing rush of the day was
executed here, the ball going from
Larkin to Risling to Angell to Strong
to Needham, who went over for an
other count, the conversion failing.
Larkin went across for three more
points a few minutes later, and Need
ham converted a difficult one, bring
ing the score of the first half up to
13 to 5.
