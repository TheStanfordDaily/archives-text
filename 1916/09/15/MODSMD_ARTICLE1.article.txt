# HORIZON CLEARS FOR STUDENT BALLOTERS
## EXIT BAN ON VOTING Raymond Benjamin, Attorney for State, Opposes Views of County Authorities 
### 
Whether or not Stanford students
are to have the privilege of register
ing to vote at the coming general
election became a still greater prob
lem today, when Mr. Raymond Ben
jamin, deputy attorney general for
the State of California, contradicted
views that have hitherto been preva
lent regarding the status of college
voters, and which have prohibited
university men from holding the priv
ilege of casting a ballot.
"Residence a Matter of Intent."
Over the long distance telephone
today Mr. Benjamin seconded the
opinions stated in a letter recently
written to Mr. Meyer Lissner of Los
Angeles, and which was later pub
lished in The Daily Palo Alto,. The
gist of this communication was that
the paramount question regarding the
right to register was that of resi
dence. Mr. Benjamin's answer to this
problem, was that "residence is
purely a matter of intention," which
is contrary to the views of both Dep
uty County Clerk O'Neil of San Jose,
and J. E. McDowell, Assistant Reg
istrar at Stanford, who has been act
ing under the instruction of the
county clerk's office.
Here Is Benjamin's Opinion.
"A student 21 years of age has the
right to prove a residence on the
campus, if he so chooses," Mr. Ben
jamin declared today. "It does not
alter matters if his parents reside
elsewhere. It makes no difference if
he is supported by his parents, who
live elsewhere.
"He can make his college his resi
dence even though he knows fthat
when he has completed his education
he will go elsewhere."
These two statements of Mr. Ben
jamin'are sufficient to grant students
the power of registration, unless some
technicality interferes. However, the
usual requirement of 90-day residence
in the county will apply to student
voters. This will preclude new stu
dents and freshmen. Stanford men
and women who were registered prior
to the present semester can comply
with this qualification. If they are
registered elsewhere new problems
arise, it being likely that under such
circumstances they cannot declare
Stanford their residence.
Assistant Registrar McDowell im
plied today that he would grant stu
dents the privilege of registering, up
on receipt of instructions from the
county clerk. Mr. Benjamin will be
prevailed upon immediately to com
municate his opinion to the San Jose
authorities.

usual requirement of 90-day residence
in the county will apply to student
voters. This will preclude new stu
dents and freshmen. Stanford men
and women who were registered prior
to the present semester can comply
with this qualification. If they are
registered elsewhere new problems
arise, it being likely that under such
circumstances they cannot declare
Stanford their residence.
Assistant Registrar McDowell im
plied today that he would grant stu
dents the privilege of registering, up
on receipt of instructions from the
county clerk. Mr. Benjamin will be
prevailed upon immediately to com
municate his opinion to the San Jose
authorities.
