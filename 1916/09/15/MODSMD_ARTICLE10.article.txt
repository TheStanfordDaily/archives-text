# Women's Roughing at Dances Is Tabooed
## Conference Will Enforce 10:30 Ruleâ€”Second Show at Movies No Excuse 
### 
Houghing at dances by women is
prohibited according to action taken
last night at a meeting of the presi
dents of the women's houses, which
action confirmed the decision of
Women's Council, taken Wednesday,
that such should be punished as "im
proper conduct." The enforcement
of this rule is made necessary by
recent disorderly roughing on the
campus.
Enforce Ten-Thirty Rule.
Stricter compliance of the ten
thirty rule is to be enforced, here
after. Miss Dorothy Metz, '17, presi
dent of Women's Conference, has ex
plained the correct interpretation of
the rules regulating the conduct of
Stanford women as stated in the hand
book of student government. Slips
will be sent to each of the ten houses
and to the halls. The tardy person
will be asked to sign her own name,
this method being considered the
most effective in reminding the of
fender of her offense. Such slips are
to be sent to council once a month,
and persons disobeying the rule will
be asked to appear before that body.
Special permission of late leave
may be obtained by application to
one member of Women's Council, who
must, in turn, gain the consent of
two other members. Such leave will
not he granted except for exception
ally good excuses of which the sec
ond show at the movies is not one.
Tuesday, September 19, has been
declared an open date to attend the
circus in San Jose. Students wishing
to attend the circus will not be
bound by the ten-thirty ruling.
