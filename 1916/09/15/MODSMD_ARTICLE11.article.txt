sity and second varsity battles are to

Barbs Strong Tomorrow.
All the games should be fast and
close, as the teams are in fairly good
condition now, and the less experi
enced visiting squads have had the
opportunity of some hard contests
this year. The Barbarian Club made
a poor showing against Santa Clara
University, but the management as
sures the rooters that a stronger
team will face the Cardinal tomor
row.
The Palo Alto Athletic Club will
make their initial appearance of the
season against the "All Blacks," and
from the looks of their lineup, will
furnish plenty of competition. The
following are the men who will take
the field for the "Pally" club: Glad
stone, Huttmau, O'Laine, Stevens,
Bihlman, Cash el, Greeve, Butterfield,
Card, Davis, Pratt, Meese, "Ric" Tem
pleton, Nagel, and Phippen.
Oakland "Tech" vs. 1920.
Former varsity captain, Jimmy
Thoburn, who handles the coaching
reins at the Oakland Technical high
school, says that his fifteen will be
a strong outfit, and capable of giving
the 1920 squad a hard game. The
freshmen seem to have a clever team,
their backfield being especially ef
fective.
L. S. Reading will handle the ref
eree's whistle in the varsity game,
the other referees not being named as
yet. The usual 50 cent gate fee will
be charged those without season tick
ets, although the pasteboards will be
sold at the gate. The band will be
in the bleachers, and.the men try
ing out for positions as assistant yell
leaders will be given opportunity to
display their ability, as will the root
ers in the stands. The lineups fol
