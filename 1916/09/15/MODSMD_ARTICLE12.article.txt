# New Era Opens for Local Golf Players
## Greater Field of Membership to Make Improvement of Links Possible 
### 
What gives promise of being the be
ginning of a new era for local golf
enthusiasts can be seen in the action
of a committee of the Stanford CJolf
Club, who met last night at the home
of Dr. H. R. Stolz and determined to
carry out a plan for widening the field
of membership in the golf club to in
clude the entire peninsula.
In order to put the links into the
proper shape and keep them in that
condition it is estimated by golf ex
perts that a sum of at least $3,000
would have to be expended on them.
Since the local membership can not
assume so great a burden the com
mittee has deemed it advisable to of
fer the privileges of the links to golf
players in other clubs up and down
the peninsula, with the idea that they
would be glad of the privilege to make
Sunday trips down here to use the
Stanford links. A letter, setting forth
a definite proposition for outside golf
players, with the request of a definite
reply on a blank form, is being drawn
up and will be sent out shortly.
The question of an adequate water
supply for the green has proved a
disturbing problem in the plan of the
committee for improving the links.
