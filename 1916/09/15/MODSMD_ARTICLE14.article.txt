# COMPANY, ATTENTION!

Bull-dog tenacity, coupled with ex
treme patience has at length been
granted its merited reward. The
handful of students who so long and
persistently agitated the innovation
of military training at Stanford will
see their laborious efforts bear fruit
Monday afternoon, when Major Bugge
is scheduled to lay the corner stone
to the venture. Success or failure of
the project, which has taken so many
eastern universites by storm, now
rests solely with the men of this Uni
versity.

Up to the present writing only one
hundred and fifty students have sig
nified their intention of enrolling in
Stanford's Officer Militia. However,
the reason for such a small number
may be assigned to the fact that
nothing definite could be announced
to the campus public previous to to
day. When dealing with college men,
it is unnecessary to harp upon the
numerous advantages, both educa
tional and physical, that are derived
from military training. Four hundred
has been set as the goal.
