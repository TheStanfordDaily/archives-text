# Fire Makes the Campus Cooler, Says Professor

"The campus might possibly have
been a couple of degrees warmer if
there had been 110 fire in the hills,"
said Professor F. J. Rogers of the
Physics department today. "If the
fire has made any difference in the
temperature, it lias been towards the
lower part of the tube. It is abso
lutely impossible for the fire to make
it any hotter at Stanford, but it
might make it cooler, although not a
great deal." These are the surpris
ing things Professor Rogers said this
morning. He also stated that the
smoke and dust of the fire is very
probably responsible for the mist and
fog in the vicinity.
