# ROVERS MAY LOOK FOR IMPROVED ARBORETUM
## 
### 
Since the Botany department has
given charge of the arboretum stu
dents of the University may look for
much improvement in this popular
refuge. Late last fall the trustees
appropriated $3000 for the upbuild
ing of the arboretum and put the
task into the hands of the Botany de
partment.
It was originally planned to have
all the trees and plants in the grounds
which would grow in this climate.
Only about 250 are represented, while
some 3000 could be planted. How
ever, the Botany faculty, with the help
of John McLaren, superintendent of
Golden Gate Park and the foremost
landscape gardner in the west, will
bring the arboretum to the standard
planned by Senator Stanford.
