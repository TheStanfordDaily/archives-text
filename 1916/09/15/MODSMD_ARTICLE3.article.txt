# Women's Council Going to Circus, Open Date Results
## 
### 
Hurrah for the Women's Coun
cil! They know a good thing when
they see It.
The next good thing is Tuesday.
It's an open date.
Here's what transpired at the
Women's Council meeting last
night:
It happened that one member
of the Women's Council had an
engagement to attend the circus
in San Jose, Tuesday night. So
she said, "I move that Tuesday be
an open date!"
An open date permits women to
stay out until 12 o'clock, or there
abouts.
It happened that four other
members of the Women's Council
had dates for the same circus.
There are five members of the
Women's Council.
And so, the motion carried un
animously.
