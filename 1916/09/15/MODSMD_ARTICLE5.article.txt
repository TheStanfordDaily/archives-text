# Fire Fighters Finally Win
## 
### 
Professor C. B. Wing, who has been
in the fire zone since Wednesday noon,
and the 25 students who were sent out
as a relief party yesterday afternoon,
returned late today from the mountains
after watching for new outbreaks since
last night. The last of the student vol
unteers who were sent out Wednesday
afternoon, returned last night, after the
fire had been finally brought under
control. Since 9 o'clock last night the
chief duty has been to prevent new
fires from gaining headway.
Seventy Students Help.
In all, about seventy Stanford stu
dents have assisted in putting out the
various fires. During the last 48 hours
fully half of the fighters have been
from the University. The work of
Professor Wing and the students under
him made a decided "hit" with the
ranchers. Though small fires are still
burning near the Rolph properties, the
danger is thought to be past.
