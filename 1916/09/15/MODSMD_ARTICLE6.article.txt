# Racquet Wielders to Play
## 
### 
Winning of two out of three sets
will be necessary in all the games of
the second novice tennis tournament
which will begin tomorrow, instead of
only one in the finals, as was the case
in last Saturday's tournament. This
will necessitate the completion of the
tournament on Sunday morning. The
play is open only to those who are not
on the tennis team or who have never
won in a tournament at Stanford.
Twenty-five cents will be collected
from each contestant, which will be
used for the purchase of a trophy for
the winner.
