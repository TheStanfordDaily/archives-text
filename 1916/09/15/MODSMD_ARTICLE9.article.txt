# Military Men Will Mark Time Monday
## Drill to Commence in Earnest Under Instruction of Major Bugge 
### 
Military training at Stanford will
start Monday, according to a state
ment issued by President Ray Lyman
Wilbur today. All men signed up for
the course in military work, and all
others who wish to enroll, should be
present at the men's gymnasium at
4 o'clock Monday afternoon, when
they will be divided into different
squads by Dr. H. R. Stolz, head of
the Physical Training department.
Ol'licerH On Hand.
Major Jens Pugge, U. S. A., will be
on hand to take charge of the work,
and the two non-commissioned of
ficers from Fort Douglas, Utah, who
will work under him, are expected to
arrive some time in the morning or
in the early afternoon, Monday.
At first the military activity will
consist primarily of drills, which will
be held every day of the college week
for a short time, in order to make up
for the delay which ensued while
waiting for officers to be appointed
by the War department. Rifle prac
tice, camp and war manoeuvers will
be included later in tbe semester.
Expect Increase IiÂ» Squad.
University credit is not being used
as a bait to entice men into the train
ing class, but the men can petition
for it later on if they wish to do so.
The leaders of the movement expect
many more men to join the one hun
dred and fifty or more students now
signed up for the preparedness
course.
