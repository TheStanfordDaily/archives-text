# MISSION TOWN TO HAVE SPEEDY FIFTEEN
## SCRUM MEN STRONG Charlie Austin Develops Team That Will Force the Cardinal 
### N.H. Petree, '19 
After two weeks of more or less
strenuous football at the universities
playing rugby—Stanford aind Santa
Clara —it now seems opportune to
type out a few lines of comparative
dope, from a spectator's viewpoint, on
the old Underwood. The writer has
witnessed both of the games played
by Stanford as well as the two con
tests that the Mission Town team
has engaged in, and although natur
ally prejudiced in favor of the Card
inal, at the present writing, the doiie
scales do not balance, and the local
varsity is not the fifteen that im
presses us as being the stronger of
the two.
Mold Cardinal Team.
With nine veterans on the job, in
cluding the speedy and elusive Lach
mund, Sample, Braden, Halsted, Pet
tingill, Walker, Carroll, Swigart, and
Templeton, the Stanford team that
will be molded during the present
season should compare favorably with
any fifteen of the past. No one in
terested in rugby can help, however,
but have noticed the lack of team
play in the varsity thus far. Al
though winning the games from the
Club teams,, there has been an appar
ent lack of clash and machine like
play that has featured Cardinal
teams. No doubt the work of the
first string men will greatly improve
as the season progresses.
Santa Clara, on the other hand, is
displaying remarkable early season
form. While comparative scores do
not as a rule, signify much, one can
not help but be surprised at the ease
with which the Catholic college squad
defeated a better Olympic Club team
by an 18 to 0 score, than Stanford
beat by a bare 9 to 8 tally. The Bar
barians were defeated 42 to 0 by the
Cardinal, but the Santa Clara delega
tion ran through them for a 54 to 0
score.
The forwards of the Santa Clara
team look to be a much faster, harder
fighting, and better drilled bunch of
scrum men than the "Farm" pos
sesses now. In fact, most of the
scoring is done by the Santa Clara
forwards. In Curtin, Howell, O'Neil,
.J. Muldoon, Don, B. Muldoon, Korte,
Mickey, Winston, and Coschino, Coach
Charlie Austin has a formidable squad
of fighters. The backfield, with Diaz,
Fowler, Berndt, Gitzpatrick, Milburn,
Shultz, and Leberveau, will stack up
well with-any opponent, but the old
fault of not feeding the ball to the
backs seems to still prevail at Santa
Clara regardless of the excellent
coaching of the former star Cardinal
five-eighths. A game between Stan
ford and Santa Clara, next Saturday,
would be an even battle, and al
though hampered by a lack of ma
terial,

beat by a bare 9 to 8 tally. The Bar
barians were defeated 42 to 0 by the
Cardinal, but the Santa Clara delega

score.
The forwards of the Santa Clara
team look to be a much faster, harder
fighting, and better drilled bunch of
scrum men than the "Farm" pos

scoring is done by the Santa Clara
forwards. In Curtin, Howell, O'Neil,

Mickey, Winston, and Coschino, Coach
Charlie Austin has a formidable squad
of fighters. The backfield, with Diaz,
Fowler, Berndt, Gitzpatrick, Milburn,
Shultz, and Leberveau, will stack up
well with-any opponent, but the old
fault of not feeding the ball to the
backs seems to still prevail at Santa
Clara regardless of the excellent
coaching of the former star Cardinal
five-eighths. A game between Stan

After two weeks of more or less
strenuous football at the universities
playing rugby—Stanford aind Santa
Clara —it now seems opportune to
type out a few lines of comparative
dope, from a spectator's viewpoint, on
the old Underwood. The writer has
witnessed both of the games played
by Stanford as well as the two con
tests that the Mission Town team
has engaged in, and although natur
ally prejudiced in favor of the Card
inal, at the present writing, the doiie
scales do not balance, and the local
varsity is not the fifteen that im
presses us as being the stronger of
the two.
Mold Cardinal Team.
With nine veterans on the job, in
cluding the speedy and elusive Lach
mund, Sample, Braden, Halsted, Pet
tingill, Walker, Carroll, Swigart, and
Templeton, the Stanford team that
will be molded during the present
season should compare favorably with
any fifteen of the past. No one in
terested in rugby can help, however,
but have noticed the lack of team
play in the varsity thus far. Al
though winning the games from the
Club teams,, there has been an appar
ent lack of clash and machine like
play that has featured Cardinal
teams. No doubt the work of the
first string men will greatly improve
as the season progresses.
Santa Clara, on the other hand, is
displaying remarkable early season
form. While comparative scores do
not as a rule, signify much, one can
not help but be surprised at the ease
with which the Catholic college squad
defeated a better Olympic Club team
by an 18 to 0 score, than Stanford
beat by a bare 9 to 8 tally. The Bar
barians were defeated 42 to 0 by the
Cardinal, but the Santa Clara delega
