# EVEN BREAK FOR LOCAL RUGBY FIFTEENS
## VARSITY BEATS BARBS Freshmen Win Over Oakland Techical in a Close Contest 
### 
Approximately one hundred and
eighty men participated in five foot
ball games held on the Stanford turf
Saturday, four Cardinal teams ending
the day with an even break, the var
sity and freshmen winning their
games, while the second and third
varsities met defeat. The curtain
raiser in the morning between the
Hayward high school team and the
second team of the Palo Alto high
school ended in favor of tlie Hayward
squad, the score reading 8 to 5. The
Lowell high school fifteen literally
swamped the third varsity, carrying
off the honors with a 20 to 3 tally.
Thrilling Football.
The afternoon games gave the
bleacherites some thrilling football.
With Joe Urban refereeing, and a
large crowd in the stands, the fresh
men started the festivities by nosing
a 6 to 3 win over the fifteen repre
senting the Oakland Technical high
school. The game was a nip and tuck
struggle from the start, the scores of
the freshmen being made in the first
half. The high school forwards out
played the scrum men on the 1920
team, and with Captain John Black
in the lead, the visitors were always
threatening. Risiing, Needham, and
Angell were the stars of the fresh
men, the first two scoring on trys,
while "Snowball" featured with some
good boots to touch.
From a spectator's standpoint, the
varsity contest was the poorest of
the games, although the Cardinal
first string men ran up a 43 to 0
score on the Barbarian Club of San
Francisco. The play was loose and
ragged, and the varsity did not seem
to work in the same machine like
fashion that Stanford rooters are used
to watching. Lachmund, Walker, Bra
don, Pelouze, and Templeton figured
in the scoring and did most of the
twinkle-twinkle acts. Many substi
tutes were sent into the game, which
may account for the lack of team
play.
P. A. V. Defeats All Blacks.
With a strong lineup, including
many Stanford rugby stars, the Palo
Alto Athletic Club defeated the sec
ond varsity in the concluding game of
the afternoon, the final count reading
1X to 3. Wallace, Smitherum, Cashel,
Card, and Stevens showed up well for
the Club, while Chandler, Hauser,
Townsend, Wilcox, Heron, and Rogers
were the best of the All Blacks. This
game was probably the best of the
day, as it was featured by good pass
ing rushes and fast, with few delays.
