# "BY THEIR FRUITS"

### 
Some of the ancient sophists, semi
philosophers of the old Greek world,
preached anti-humanitarian doctrines
upholding the justice of individual
selfishness. Thought and actions have
changed since then with the evolution
of the modern day. Ample illustra
tion is afforded by the brush fire that
swept the nearby hills during the past
week, in which Stanford performed
their share unasked and without the
enticement of material gain, or the
goad of self-preservation.

When a hundred men from any
community lay aside their own work
and pleasure in order to aid a neigh
boring populace which is in stress,
they are deserving of hearty com
mendation. Stanford students on
three successive occasions, Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday, filled the role
of fire-fighters under the supervision
of a Stanford professor , success
finally crowning their generous ef
forts.

Both thanks and praise are due to
these brigades of good citizens, while
the same should be seasoned with a
little sympathy for those who are
suffering from tormenting cases of
poison oak. One also can not over
look the fine spirit of co-operation
displayed by the women in their im
mediate response to the request for
sandwiches, salads, and other re
freshments for the fire-fighters. Hats
off to Stanford Spirit!
