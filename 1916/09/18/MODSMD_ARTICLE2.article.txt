## 
### 
Swimming the 400-foot relay race in
1:08 3-5 time between events of the
Inter-Fraternity Meet, held last Fri
day afternoon, Stanford's four-man
team bettered the mark set by the
University of California last year by
a full second, and established a new
Stanford record for the event.
Records Equalled.
The quartette, composed of Ross,
Penniman, Goldsmith, and Green, at
temped early in the meet to lower
the Berkeley record of 1:09 3-5, but
were successful only in equalling that
mark. In the second attempt, which
resulted in the lowering of the record,
two watches were held at the finish,
one stopping at 1:08 2-5. The
slower time was accepted, however.
In the 100-yard exhibition dash, Nor
man Ross, '20, negotiated the distance
in the fast time of :58 flat. He was
paced by Penniman, Brokenshire, and
Nagle, each swimming 100 feet.

Swimming the 400-foot relay race in
1:08 3-5 time between events of the
Inter-Fraternity Meet, held last Fri
day afternoon, Stanford's four-man
team bettered the mark set by the
University of California last year by
a full second, and established a new
Stanford record for the event.
Records Equalled.
The quartette, composed of Ross,
Penniman, Goldsmith, and Green, at
temped early in the meet to lower
the Berkeley record of 1:09 3-5, but
were successful only in equalling that
mark. In the second attempt, which
resulted in the lowering of the record,
two watches were held at the finish,
one stopping at 1:08 2-5. The
slower time was accepted, however.
In the 100-yard exhibition dash, Nor
man Ross, '20, negotiated the distance
in the fast time of :58 flat. He was
paced by Penniman, Brokenshire, and
Nagle, each swimming 100 feet.
