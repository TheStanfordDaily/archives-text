# Biederwolf Versus Circus All-Star San Jose Contest
## 
### 
Evangelists are psychologists and
at the same time wizards of rugby
strategy. They know that conver
sions are made in proportion to the
difficulty of the angle.
The caravan of Biederwolf, an
evangelist now holding forth in San
Jose, invaded the campus today, trav
eling de luxe in motor cars, and
armed with a bugle, a chorus of
voices and several Salvation Army
lasses. Evidently Biederwolf's object
wuis to convert many hundred heathen
college men. He struck the campus
at noon, the hungry hour, when
man's angle of resistance is negli
gible.
The result of the evangelist's pass
ing rush will not be known, as in
rugby, until the game is over. The
real test will come tomorrow night,
when two all-star teams line up. The
one is Biederwolf, the evangelist, at
the Tabernacle. The other is the cir
cus, on a vacant lot somewhere near
a hot-dog wagon in San Jose.
