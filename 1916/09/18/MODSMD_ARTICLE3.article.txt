Fate isn't exactly fair and just in
the rewards she metes out to the de
serving, sometimes.
Everyone knows that a lot of the
most public-minded citizens of the
L. S. J. U. campus went out and
fought lire in the hills last week.
Nearly everyone knows who the
heroes are, and by the sign of the
singed head and eyelash—as they once
more engage in academic work —and
praise them by word or glance.
Hut few know that some twelve of
the worthiest who engaged in the
thickest of the fight, entangling them
selves in the densest of the herbage,
were smitten by the evil God of the
thickets —Poison Oak. Now they lie
glowing, not with praise, in the Penin
sula Hospital, "unwept, unhonored
and unsung."
Fear, of increasing the size of their
already inflated heads, and modesty
on the part of the victims, who pre
fer to "blush unseen," prevents re
vealing the names of the unfortunate
ones. But the truly sympathetic,
made so by hitter experience, will not
fail to drop a tear for the unknown
sufferers.
