# "ATTAIN YOUR LEVEL"—--REV. GILKEY
## 
### 
"Each one of us has his own place,
to which his soul by spiritual grav
ity carries him," said Rev. Charles W.
Oil key in his foreful sermon to a
large audience in the Memorial
Church yesterday. "If we <lo not rise
by our own effort and sturgglr to a
higher level, we shall sink to our
own place, which may not necessarily

be the low level of infamy, but of
mediocrity."
.hidns An Example.
Rev. Gilkey graphically illustrated
this fact by the fall of Judas, a
grasping soul, who saw in his ac
quaintance with Jesus, a chance to
make money.
"This power of financial ambition
still exists. All Judas' privileges did
not save him from himself, since great
acquaintances do \not alvvay make
great men, and high privileges do not
cause men to rise to their level," con
tinued Mr. Gilkey.
How About Your Level.
"The question here is not—have
students completed four years of
work —but have they made the in
tellectual and spiritual level of this
University their own, so that they
can resist the swirling tide of medi
ocrity, cheapness and vulgarity, of
which American life is so full? Are
you making the life for which this
University stands so much your own
that when you get away from here,
you will stand in the community in
which you live as the highest type of
American manhood?" These were
questions directed by Rev. Gilkey to
Stanford students.
"The power to rise rests not in our
strength alone, but in the deeping
experience of a 'love that will not let
us go,' " concluded Rev. Gilkey.
