"Frosh" vs. College of l'iicilio.
While the Lick-Third varsity game
is on here, the freshmen team will
journey to San Jose to meet the Col
lege of Pacific fifteen. This game
was originally scheduled for the Stan
ford turf, but owing to the fact that
it was the opening game of the sea
son, the College of Pacific requested
that it be transferred to their field.
The freshmen will probably use the
same lineup as heretofore, though
some minor changes are apt to be
made.
Lick-Wilmerding will bring a good
strong team down to meet the third
varsity and a good contest is ex
pected. Art Erb, '15, former varsity
half, is coach of Lick, which assures
formidable opposition.
Coach Brown has not chosen the
third varsity fifteen as yet for to
morrow's contest, but it will probably
include Edwards, Hough, McGilvray,
Westenhaver, Kyle, Barneson, Pehl,
Culp, Harris, Nagel, Wilkins, Wright,
Neuner, K. Henry, Jeffers, Needham,
Ames, Smith, and 13. Rogers.
