### 
Military training at Stanford was
given a line stai t yesterday afternoon,
when some two hundred and fifty en
thusiasts gathered at Encina gymnas
ium to hear Major Jens Bugge out
line the aims of the course. A roll
call of the men who had previously
signed tip found many of these ab
sent, but over two hundred of those
present signified their intention to
take up the work.
President Wilbur States.
President Wilbur makes the follow
ing statement in regard to military
training:
"I am very glad to have such an
opportunity in the University. I
think it is a chance to develop citizen
ship and the feeling of responsibility
necessary under a democratic govern
ment. Personally, 1 should like to
see tht freshmen take it up and stay
with it for four years. Military train
ing should promise a good develop
ment for a strong man, and be a great
thing for the University."
Tonight the men will report at the
gym, ready to fall in at 4:15. It is
expected that a number of men who
could not be present last night will
be on hand this afternoon. Men can
enlist, any afternoon this week. Those
in charge of the movement anticipate
an enrollment of at least four hun
dred for this the initial semester.
! Sixteen non-commissioned officers
and three commissioned officers are
to help in getting the work of drill
under way. As soon as officers from
among the students themselves be
come capable of taking charge of
the squads of men, these assistants
will return to their regular posts in
the army.
Six Already Here.
Of the non-commissioned officers,
four from Fort Winfield Scott and two
from Fort Miley arrived on the cam
pus this morning. Ten non-commis
sioned and three commissioned of
ficers from Fort Douglas, Utah, are
due late this afternoon. The six who
came this morning are as follows:
Sergeants Benjamin H. Davis, Com
pany 4; Frank B. Richards, Company
6; John R. Osborne, Company 10, and
Erwin B. Smith, Company 10, of Fort
Winfield Scott; and Corporals Joseph
B. McKay, Company 1, and William
E. Johnson, Company 2, of Fort
Miley.
Train Student Officers.
Major Bugge will make his primary
aim the training of students as of
ficers, he stated yesterday afternoon.
The class will be technically known
as the Stanford University reserve of
ficers training corps, and men doing
acceptable work in the course will be
in line for second lieutenantships in
the regular army in case of war. Em
phasis will be placed on drill only
until the men have mastered the
necessary rudiments. Lectures and
special study of tactics used in ac
tual warfare, map making, and rifle
practice will be taken up later on.
Men will meet every afternoon for
two weeks, in order to make up for
time lost on account of the delay in
starting the movement. Later three
meetings will be held a week, prob
ably Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
afternoons, from 4 to 6, or from 4:15
to (5:15, with a makeup class on Sat
urday mornings.
That credit would be surely granted
to the men in the military course, was
the assurance made by President
Wilbur this morning. One unit will
be granted for three hours of work,
and two units will be awarded for
twice that amount. Dr. Wilbur stated
that University credit was not to be
made a bait to entice men to sign up
in the work, but that men should
come out because of their interest in
the training.
Major Bugge has received his of
ficial appointment as instructor of the
drill at Stanford from the War de
partment. This means that there will
be no possible barrier to progress in
military training at Stanford.
