# THE 						WHITE SLIPS

Supporters of favorite sons will be
afforded their fourth opportunity of
casting ballots for the positions of as
sistant yell leader tomorrow after
noon between halves of the mid-week
rugby tangle. Thereafter the pruning
knife will raise havoc with the re
cruiting reduction of candidates to a
quartette, which number will con
tinue to wave their arms like scythes
in a grain field until the completion
of the try-out period.

The position of yell leader is one
of prominence and importance, there
by necessitating careful scrutiny, fol
lowed by a wise and worthy selection
on the part of the bleachers. Per
sonality, a world of enthusiasm, agil
ity of brain, and a smattering of grace
are all qualifications requisite to one
holding the office. Although seemingly
this calls for the introduction of the
superman, the material is adequate,
if proper choice is forthcoming.

An effort should be made tomorrow
by the writers of the white-slips to
overlook for the time being personal
friendship, and to cast aside fratern
ity brothers or club-mates when found
wanting. The existing practice of
placing first the name of a friend
and then the weakest candidate pos
sible upon the ballot as a decoy, ex
hibits a spirit truly un-Stanford in
character. As a result of this clever
political ruse, an Indian statue or
Swedish immigrant is rendered likely
of appointment. Be honest with
yourself by voting for the best man.
