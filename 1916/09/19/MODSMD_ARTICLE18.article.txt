# Museum Takes New Inventory
## 
### 
Direct charge of the museum has
been placed in the hands of President
Wilbur and a complete inventory cat
alog is being prepared. From 1891
until her death, the museum was
under the immediate supervision of
Mrs. Stafford, later passing under the
control of the Board of Trustees.
About four months ago the directing
of the institution was given over to
the President of the University. Cur
ator H. C'. Peterson with nine assist
ants has started the stupendous task
of taking 40,000 separate articles
which the museum contains, number
ing them consecutively, measuring
them three ways, in 4000 instances
weighing them, and entering all this
material, together with all data pos
sible about each article, upon the
4x6 cards especially made for this
purpose. The fact that nearly all
records were destroyed in the earth
quake has made the work extremely
difficult. After cataloging comes a
complete re-classittcation, re-labeling
and re-arrangement. Another two
months will see the completion of this
task.
