# Capitalist to Send Seattle Crew East
## 
### 
Reports come from the University
of Washington that assure the follow
ers of the annual crew races that the
big event between Stanford ami the
northern university will be a close
race this year, as Washington has
every incentive to turn out a success
ful eight to compete with the Card
inal oarsmen. Coach Hiram Coni
bear, who has developed many victor
ious crews for Washington, is going
to return, contrary to early reports,
and will have five veterans to start
the season with.
Washington supporters are very
enthusiastic already because it was
expected that the veteran coach
would not return to handle the des
tinies of the shell, and on account of
enlistment in the militia, it was
thought that there would be few old
crew men on the job this year. There
will be a short fall practice to get
the men in shape and to get a line on
new material.
H. C. Henry, a capitalist in Seattle,
Washington, who has been accus
tomed to donating $2 r >o yearly to the
northern crew, has offered to pay all
the expenses of a trip east to the
Poughkeepsie regatta, provided Wash
ington wins the Pacific Coast, title in
the spring rowing contests. Conse
quently every effort will be made to
turn out a winning eight by both the
coaches and students.
