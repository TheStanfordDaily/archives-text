"By cricky, them there college
dandies do be tantalizing!" Such a
speech is credited to a certain town
marshal of Lindsay, Tulare, who
found to his sorrow that jailing a town
bum and trying to jail an educated
college man —a Stanford law gradu
ate —were not one and the same prop
osition.
Quoting from a Tulare county daily:
"It's a mighty hard matter to jail j
a lawyer as I tried it the other day,"
said Marshal Lynch this week. Now
Lynch is a good marshal and he does
not intend to have anything slipped J
over on him. He found a man in the j
outskirts of town this week selling
aluminum ware without a license and I
proposed to make the young man :
come through.
The young man stated that he did j
not have to as he was acting within j
the law. Lynch evidently thought that
lie was being hoodwinked and pro
posed to take the young man before
Judge Fenn. It all proved out that
the guilty party was one Ohas. Hill,
a young attorney, who recently got i
his D. I). X. Y. Z., or something like
that, from the Law department at j
Stanford and was onto the law.
It seems that there is a law per
mitting a manufacturer from outside
of the state sending an agent to the
state and soliciting orders without j
paying the customary business li
cense. "Yes," said Lynch, "I am
through trying to jail lawyers."
