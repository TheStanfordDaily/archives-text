# CAMPUS EVENTS FILL DATE BOOK
## 
### 
Stanford society lights will burn
brightly during this semester, if the
Registrar's date book is any fore
caster of events. The roundup of
dates made today shows that twenty
nine affairs are already registered,
some of which as far in advance as
March, 1917.
The first large affair will be the
freshman jolly-up, which will be held
in the Armory September 23. This is
followed by the band dance on Fri
day, September 29, and the first En
cina Club dance on Saturday, Sep
tember 30.
October 7 will be the butterfly's
busy day as the Society Circus, at
Miss Marker's School: the Alpha Delta
Phi dance in the Women's Club
House; the first Roble At Home, and
the Sigma Chi informal, are all sched
uled for that date.
Friday, the 13th (of October) will
bring a piece of luck in the shape of
the "Seven Keys to Raid pate," pre
sented by Sword and Sandals. An
other piece of luck (for those who
have to hire dress suits) is the fact
that the informal affairs have a large
lead on the forraals, so far, the total
being 12 to 5 in favor of the inforra
als. Each organization on the cam
pus is to be allowed a 1 o'clock dance
this semester, and up to this date,
twenty-one dances have been ar
ranged for.
The organizations which have been
farsighted enough to sign up for next
semester are Masquers, who have re
served February 2d; Gamma Phi
Beta, which is dated for a formal on
February 9th, and the Junior Opera,
which is scheduled for March 29.

Stanford society lights will burn
brightly during this semester, if the
Registrar's date book is any fore
caster of events. The roundup of
dates made today shows that twenty
nine affairs are already registered,
some of which as far in advance as
March, 1917.
The first large affair will be the
freshman jolly-up, which will be held
in the Armory September 23. This is
followed by the band dance on Fri
day, September 29, and the first En
cina Club dance on Saturday, Sep
tember 30.
October 7 will be the butterfly's
busy day as the Society Circus, at
Miss Marker's School: the Alpha Delta
Phi dance in the Women's Club
House; the first Roble At Home, and
the Sigma Chi informal, are all sched
uled for that date.
Friday, the 13th (of October) will
bring a piece of luck in the shape of
the "Seven Keys to Raid pate," pre
sented by Sword and Sandals. An
other piece of luck (for those who
have to hire dress suits) is the fact
that the informal affairs have a large
lead on the forraals, so far, the total
being 12 to 5 in favor of the inforra
als. Each organization on the cam
pus is to be allowed a 1 o'clock dance
this semester, and up to this date,
twenty-one dances have been ar
ranged for.
The organizations which have been
farsighted enough to sign up for next
semester are Masquers, who have re
served February 2d; Gamma Phi
Beta, which is dated for a formal on
February 9th, and the Junior Opera,
which is scheduled for March 29.
