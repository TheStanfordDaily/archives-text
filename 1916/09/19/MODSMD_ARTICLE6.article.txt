A cast of veterans of Stanford dra
matics, 14 —count 'ein, 14 —in num
ber, was named today by Sword and
Sandals to handle the roles in "Seven
Keys to Baldpate," due to arrive on
the Assembly Hall stage on the eve
ning of Friday-the-13th.
Memories of recent Junior Operas,
of "Stop Thief," of "The Great Divide,"
"Ready Money," and last and far from
least, "A Pair of Sixes," will be re
freshed on the eventful evening when
the cast of "Seven Keys" is revealed
at the rise of the asbestos. For in
truth as well as in press agent stuff,
"Seven Keys" is to have a cast of all
stars.
There will be E. R. Martin, '18, F.
W. Weeks, 'IS, Buford Williams, '16,
Florence Mason, 'IS, Thurlyn Buffum,
'18, and Josephine Welch, '18, whose
names were seen on the program of
the long-to-be remembered "Pair of
Sixes." There will be R. L. Johnston,
'17, W. G. Paul, '15, Gordon Pavis. '18,
J. C. Cross, '17, J. D. McLachlan, '17,
11. P. Hauser, '18, H. A. Buffum, '18,

and Nellita Choate, '17, whose names
will be ever linked with recollections
of recent dramatic and operatic super
successes.
Not a One-Man Play.
Coming with the announcement of
cast, is word that "Seven Keys" will
not be a one-man or a woman drama.
Due to the fact that the experience
and ability of many of the 14 are of
equally high cabliber, Sword and San
dals finds it impossible to determine
just who could be properly dubbed
what is commonly known as the
"lead." When the curtain falls at 11
o'clock, October 13, perhaps some one
will have discovered the character
whose work surmounted all others
enough to classify him as the "lead
ing man."
Until then, Sword and Sandals
would have it known that "Seven
Keys" is a play without a lead, al
though there are two parts—those
played in New York by Wallace Ed
dinger and Gail Kane, respectively,
that the newspapers christened
"leads."
