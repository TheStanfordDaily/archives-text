# SCHOLARSHIP HOLDERS FOR YEAR CHOSEN
## 
### 
A new scholarship worth $250 a
year, has just been established at the
University by Mrs. J. M. Braly of
Fresno, to assist in the education at
Stanford of a young woman from
Fresno or Santa Clara county. This
scholarship will be known as the
Bertha Hyde Hraly scholarship, as it
will be in honor of the memory of
Mrs. Braly's daughter, Bertha Hyde
Hraly, a Stanford graduate with the
class of 1597, whose death occurred
some three years ago. This scholar
ship has not yet been awarded for
the coming year, but is still before the
Academic Committee on Scholarship.

Sorority Scholarship.
A scholarship prize of $100 will be
awarded at the end of the present
year to the Junior sorority woman
who maintains the highest scholarship
throughout the year. Each of the ten
chapters of women's fraternities at
Stanford have contributed $10 to this
fund.
Fraternities Compete for Cup.
Fraternities will compete for the
first time this year for the scholar
ship cup, the gift of twenty Greek
letter organizations, which will be
awarded at, the end of the year to the
fraternity house with the best scholar
ship average. This cup, which is a
beautiful silver trophy, was designed
by Professor A. B. Clark of the Edu
cation department, and made by Hans
Tauchen at Ye Olde Copper Shop in
San Francisco. It is now on exhi
bition at the Registrar's office.
