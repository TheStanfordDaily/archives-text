# No Advertising in 1918 Year Book Aim of Manager
## 
### 
That the 1918 Quad will be a Quad
without ads is the general opinion of
Manager Foster Weeks, and the new
Quad board. Plans are being worked
out, and several schemes point to a
probability of abolishing advertise
ment matter this year.
Manager Weeks will meet with the
Quad board tomorrow morning to
confer on plans proposed to overcome
the deficit which will result from re
placing ads with reading matter. It
is the aim to make the changes per
manent by sanction of the Executive
Committee. Whatever changes are
made will be based on reports of past
managers.
it is believed by Manager Weeks
that cost of securing ads has been
almost as great as the amount re
ceived from them, and that the slight
deficit can be overcome by raising
the price of the Quad a little.
Picture contracts nave been let to
Davy in Palo Alto for individuals,
and Franklin for groups. Manager
Weeks has issued a call for juniors
to pay their five dollar assessments,
which covers the cost of their books,
and have their pictures taken before
the rush sets in. November 15 is the
last date on which junior pictures
will be taken. A year ago more than
a hundred pictures were run through
in the last two days only with great
difficulty.
Editor Wolilford has assigned his
staff to their work. Wohlford plans
to spread the work of publishing the
Quad over the entire year, that care
may be taken with every detail.
