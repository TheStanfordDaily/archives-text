Shortly after the opening of the
spring semester last year, Stanford
determined to eliminate freshmen
from participating with any varsity
team, no matter whether the contest
was in the nature of an intercollegiate
match or a preliminary game with
ah athletic club. Once again the
question of lirst-year eligibility seems
rife on the campus, when considering
the personnel of the rugby fifteen
which will oppose Santa Clara in the
final scramble on the turf next No
vember.

Evidently those individuals decry
ing the exclusion of freshmen except
from first-year teams, unintentionally
overlook, or perhaps intentionally, the
grave inconsistency of their position.
Should Stanford, having made the un
alterable decision of moulding varsity
teams without the aid of freshmen
during the spring semester, abruptly
turn tail the fall term by permitting
first-year men to participate in var
sity society, excellent ground for
criticism and satire is laid bare.

The merits of the question as to
whether or no freshmen should be
eliminated from varsity competition
hardly enters the discussion, al
though it may be said that there are
some mighty good arguments to be
floated before the public on both
sides. The point to bear in mind is
that an irrevocable decision has been
made to bar freshmen from intercol
legiate and preliminary competition
during the second term, —and for just
and sound reasons. If such lie the
athletic policy of this University, why
not show sufficient strength of char
acter and courage to maintain the
same consistently the entire year
around?
