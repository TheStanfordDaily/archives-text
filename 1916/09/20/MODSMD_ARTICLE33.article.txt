# Mrs. Leonard Ely Delights Audience
## Dr. Wilbur Prefers "La Maumariee"â€”Other Numbers Well Received 
### 
When asked what she considered
the best number 011 her program,
given in the Little Theater last night,
Mrs. .Leonard W. Ely appealed to
President Wilbur, who emphatically
said "La Maumariee," giving as his
only reason that it "just was best."
The little old French verse was so
apart from the usual choice of ster
eotyped selections that it was difficult
to say why it was best.
Mrs. Ely sang down into the hearts
of her hearers, making them feel her
feeling and change with her moods.
From the waltz measures of Delibes'
"Copelia Ballet" to the plaintive
lament of the little girl who wondered
what she would do if no one ever
married her, the audience lived in the
songs with thought rather of their
content than of their technique.
With a program well suited to a
college audience, Mrs. Ely interpreted
German, French, and English songs
with a remarkable daintiness and var
iety of range. Cadman's "I Hear a
Thrush at Eve," as an encore, was no
less pleasing than the announced
numbers.
Mrs. Ely was accompanied at the
piano by Miss Eleanor Morris of Palo
Alto.
