# Second"500" Rises Soon to Be a "600"
## 
### 
Stanford now has two "five hun
dreds."
One is old and established â€”the
other is new and coming.
One wears skirts, and the other
doesn't.
One is very exclusive, but the other
isn't.
The new "five hundred" will soon
cease to rival the old "five hundred,"
says Tal Smith, who knows all about
the new half thousand.
The new "Five Hundred" refers to
members of the Stanford Union. The
roll reached the five hundred mark
today.
To date no special membership cam
paign has been conducted for the
Union, though Manager Smith has un
earthed a campaign against the pop
ular institution. Smith is unable to
understand the attitude of the leader
of the campaign, who advocates and
practices membership without pay
ment of dues.
Every day brings new members,
according to Smith, and it is but a
question of time until the Union
reaches its record mark.
