# U. of C. Swimmers Call Off Big Meet
## California Aquatic Athletes Have No Time for the Fall Competition 
### 
California swimmers have declined
to meet the Stanford aquatic squad
this fall in intercollegiate competi
tion.
According to a message from the
Blue and Gold managers, they find it
"impossible to meet Stanford in
swimming in the fall."
There are several reasons why the
contest cannot be staged in the fall,
but the important one probably is
that Ludy Langer, Berkeley's Big C
swimmer, has not returned from the
Hawaiian Islands. The California
swimmers say that their team is not
in a position to meet any rivals this
fall, and they have turned down all
negotiations for contests.
Managers at Berkeley maintain that
the fall athletic, slate for California
athletes is already too crowded and
there is not a single chance for an
aquatic contest.
Coach Brandsten is not unduly dis
appointed with the change, though lie
so.ught to have the meet this fall.
According to Brandsten, the Card
inals will be stronger than ever in
the spring, and the local hoys will be
able to find plenty of competition
without a California contest this fall.
