The loneliest place on earth
A snow-storm beating against its doors
A log fire that nobody built
The wild ringing of a telephone long since disconnected
The flash of electric lights from currentless wires.
One more key, the 7th, andâ€”
A woman reporter, a novelist, a blackmailer,
A crook politician, a thief, a railroad president,
A romantic chaperone.
Shake them up any way you will, and you have drama.
But only George M. Cohan could
Shake them as he has in
"SEVEN KEYS TO BALDPATE"
Friday, the 13th
