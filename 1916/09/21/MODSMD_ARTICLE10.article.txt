# Student Officers Are To Be Chosen Within Two Weeks
## 
### 
Temporary appointments of officers
in the Stanford University reserve
corps will be made within two
weeks, according to Major Jens
Bugge, United States array, in charge
of the school, today.
By that time, Major Bugge and his
assistants hope to have trained the
men in the school sufficiently so that
they can take command of the squads
themselves. Daily drill will continue
for some time, until the hours lost
in the delay of organizing are made
up.
Major Bugge calls to the attention
of prospective students in the school
the uniform they should obtain. This
will include an army hat, khaki shirt,
two pairs of khaki trousers, leggings
and shoes. All this equipment is the
standard used by the United States
army. The cost will be between
eight and nine dollars. The value of
these articles exceeds the cost to the
students by several dollars, as the
government, buying in great quanti-
I
ties, obtains the uniforms at a low
cost.
