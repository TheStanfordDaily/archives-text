Like Odysseus' mariners stranded
on the Island of the Sun, after becom
ing accustomed to a hand-to-mouth
existence, anyone finds it diificult to
omerge from a deepening rut. For
many years, due to no fault of its ed
itor or manager, but rather to the
system in vogue, Stanford's Junior
Year Book, has been decidedly medi
ocre in character, when held in com
parison with other university an
nuals. A proposal is now being agi
tated that has a wealth of promise
and is deserving of encouragement—
elimination of all Quad advertising.
********
At first thought such a step might
appear radical and unpractical, but
the demonstration of a few facts may
lead to a reverse opinion. Approxi
mate estimates concerning advertis
ing in last year's annual show a bare
even break over expenses, with adver
tising profits nihil. Expenses incur
red in soliciting, the cost of printing,
followed by deduction of commissions
and salaries from the revenue, in
toto more than equal the derived in
come from advertising.
********
The world of improvement that
would result from exclusion of ad
vertising in the general appearance
of the Quad hardly needs mention.
The case is analogous to a city beau
tiful campaign, in which bill-boards
are denied the privilege of decorating
the public highways.
********
Benefit to be derived by campus
publications from elimination of Quad
advertising becomes another serious
consideration. At present the field of
college advertising is madly over-run,
rendering acceptance of trade ads,
cutting of rates, loss of regular cus
tomers necessary features. With the
Year Book out of the tangle, the sit
uation would be clarified.
ft*******
Quad advertising, again, has con
tinally undergone the fire of criticism
on the basis of its management. The
custom of farming the advertising,
which seems a necessary evil, pre
cludes loss from heavy commissions,
and misuse of commodities derived
from trade ads. Furthermore, this
practice is contrary to the principles
of any try-out system. All in all,
evidence favoring exclusion of Quad
advertising seems to overlap any ar
guments 011 the other side of the
ledger.
