Editor of The Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir: As I understand it, we
students of Stanford have self-gov
ernment of the representative type.
I assume, therefore, that we may crit
icize the legislation of our local rep
resentatives, just as we do that of
our national congress. Permit me
then:
"A girl desiring to go to San Fran
cisco on a week night, must obtain
the consent of three members of Con
ference."
The above rule is, in substance at
least, a rule passed by the Women's
Conference last week, in a worthy at
tempt to protect the health, morals,
and scholarship of our beloved "Five
Hundred." Such a rule, Mr. Editor,
is not legislation, it is confiscation
confiscation of inherent rights. It is
a rule that might be necessary in a
convent or house of correction, but
not at Stanford, and its purport casts
a slur that all Stanford women
should rightly resent.
The reason advanced for the rule is:
The Conference wishes, as it right
fully should, to know when, and for
what purpose, Stanford women leave
the campus in mid-week. This is
legitimate and proper information for
the governing body of our women, but
if the rule goes deeper and sets a
positive limit on the week night free
rom, then it loses any foundation of
power and common sense it may have
had.
Student government is self-govern
ment. One group, no matter how rep
resentative, cannot assume full re
sponsibility and decide the private
and personal problems of its many
constituents. The arbitrary rule just
stated, belies, in its enforcement, the
existence of any such thing as self
government, and puts a positive limit
on the mental freedom and control a
true woman must exercise to properly
develop. The effort of the Confer
ence, though noble and self-sacrific
ing, is totally unwarranted, unneces
sary, and unbearable.
There can be no sound reason for
subjecting a normal, active, Stanford
woman to the humiliation of securing
the consent of three Conference mem
bers when she desires to leave the
campus. It is barely possible that
the Conference members may be
younger and less sophisticated than
the woman, or that their visions may
be dwarfed and narrow: Wherein
can the efficiency of such a rule,
that subjects the women of Stanford
to such unfair, unnecessary, and un
precedented domination, be found?
Conference has legislated with good
intent, but has adopted the wrong
remedy. As a suggestion: Let every
woman who leaves the campus in
form a Conference member of her
destination and purpose. In this
way the Conference will have an ac
curate check and if any individual
becomes too free with her privileges
then she can be disciplined and re
stricted without casting insinuation
and hardship on the undeserving
majority.

a rule that might be necessary in a
convent or house of correction, but
not at Stanford, and its purport casts
a slur that all Stanford women
should rightly resent.
The reason advanced for the rule is:
The Conference wishes, as it right
fully should, to know when, and for
what purpose, Stanford women leave
the campus in mid-week. This is
legitimate and proper information for
the governing body of our women, but
if the rule goes deeper and sets a
positive limit on the week night free
rom, then it loses any foundation of
power and common sense it may have
had.
Student government is self-govern
ment. One group, no matter how rep
resentative, cannot assume full re
sponsibility and decide the private
and personal problems of its many
constituents. The arbitrary rule just
stated, belies, in its enforcement, the
existence of any such thing as self
government, and puts a positive limit
on the mental freedom and control a
true woman must exercise to properly
develop. The effort of the Confer
ence, though noble and self-sacrific
ing, is totally unwarranted, unneces
sary, and unbearable.
There can be no sound reason for
subjecting a normal, active, Stanford
woman to the humiliation of securing
the consent of three Conference mem
bers when she desires to leave the
campus. It is barely possible that
the Conference members may be
younger and less sophisticated than
the woman, or that their visions may
be dwarfed and narrow: Wherein
can the efficiency of such a rule,
that subjects the women of Stanford
to such unfair, unnecessary, and un
precedented domination, be found?
Conference has legislated with good
intent, but has adopted the wrong
remedy. As a suggestion: Let every
woman who leaves the campus in
form a Conference member of her
destination and purpose. In this
way the Conference will have an ac
curate check and if any individual
becomes too free with her privileges
then she can be disciplined and re
stricted without casting insinuation
and hardship on the undeserving
majority.

Editor of The Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir: As I understand it, we
students of Stanford have self-gov
ernment of the representative type.
I assume, therefore, that we may crit
icize the legislation of our local rep
resentatives, just as we do that of
our national congress. Permit me
then:
"A girl desiring to go to San Fran
cisco on a week night, must obtain
the consent of three members of Con
ference."
The above rule is, in substance at
least, a rule passed by the Women's
Conference last week, in a worthy at
tempt to protect the health, morals,
and scholarship of our beloved "Five
Hundred." Such a rule, Mr. Editor,
is not legislation, it is confiscation
confiscation of inherent rights. It is
a rule that might be necessary in a
convent or house of correction, but
not at Stanford, and its purport casts
a slur that all Stanford women
should rightly resent.
The reason advanced for the rule is:
