# California Notes
## 
### 
California freshmen football play
ers will meet the Olympic Club next
Saturday. The Winged-0 men have
an average weight of 200 pounds, and
promise to give the babes a good
workout.
The Junior Day Farce will be given
at. the Berkeley T. & D. Theater, in
stead of at one of the Oakland the
aters, as was the former custom.
Coach Andy Smith criticised the
football playing in Saturday's game
as being very much in .need of im
provement. "The players showed up
well in straight line bucks but on end
runs or on any play where finesse
was required they were woefully
weak."
Tryouts for the California debating
team, which will meet Stanford, No
vember 24, will be held October 10
and 12. There are.#.bout thirty men
trying out, including several veter
ans.
Twenty-four new men were chosen
for the U. C. Glee Club last night, in
preparation for the trips north at the
time of the big game with Wash
ington.
If tlie regents of the University of
California sanction present plans, a
Red Cross division will be estab
lished at Berkeley to co-operate with
the Department of Military Science.
Should the division be organized it
will mean that Red Cross nurses, am
bulance drivers, pharmacists and as
sistants will be trained for regular
army service. Those making up the
Red Cross column will be known as
the enlisted reserve for the U. S.
Medical department.
Professor J. W. Gregg of the De
partment of Landscape Gardening is
directing work in operating upon and
repairing oak trees which have been
attacked by destructive insects or by
decay. The trees are repaired by
means of cement fillings.
