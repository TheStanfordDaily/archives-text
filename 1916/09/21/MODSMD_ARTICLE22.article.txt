"Bawl-Out" proof sheets are partly
set up, and the first three pages have
been posted up in front of the Reg

to watch this board and report any
errors to the office. Proofs are not

Belirens Negotiates for
Thanksgiving Game.
Graduate Manager Earl C. Behrens

Amos Elliott, a former California
track captain, are in charge of the
football squad for the club, and it is
probable that last year's slate can be
duplicated again this fall.
