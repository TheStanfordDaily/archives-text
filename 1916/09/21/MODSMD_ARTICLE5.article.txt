# Forbes' Show Shop Is Sophomore Play
## Successful Comedy of Inside Theatrical Life Offers a Play Within Play 
### 
Not an unrealistic farce, but a true
to-life comedy of the inside of the
atrical life and the characters of the
theater-world, —a successful play of
the stage containing a successful play
within itself, —is "The Show Shop,"
the selection of the Sophomore class
for presentation on local boards, Fri
day evening, November 3.
Without a dull moment, with laughs
because of situations and character
conflicts, but not because of horse
play or extractions from a bag of
tricks, "The Show Shop" not only
promises but guarantees to be "in
teresting as well as instructive."
"The Show Shop" is instructive only
because it reveals a very great deal
about the stage, and the romantic
lives of stage people, at the same time
telling a great many things that
everyone wants to know, —about sal
aries, managers, stage "mothers,"
leading women in love with leading
men, leading men in love with leading
women, midnight rehearsals, failures,
successes and the bright glims of
Broadway.
James Forbes is the author of "The
Show Shop." He also wrote "The
Chorus Lady," one of the most suc
cessful theatrical dramas ever writ
ten. The play chosen for presenta
tion here is still very much in its
teens, having started a long run at
the Hudson Theater in New York, a
year last January, with Douglas Fair
banks and Patricia Collinge in the
leading roles.
Romance is the atmosphere of the
Forbes comedy, the romance of a
young girl of the stage and a "man
about-town" who is railroaded into
playing the leading role in "A Drop
of Poison" (the inside drama of 'The
Show Shop') with the understanding
that the play will fail —so he can
marry the girl. "A Drop of Poison,"
with its title altered to "Dora's
Dilemma," to insure its failure, is de
clared a hit. Thereby hangs the tale
that runs through four acts of mer
riment, located in the manager's of
fice, behind the scenes at rehearsal,
on the stage during the crucial act of
the inside melo-drama, and in the
bachelor apartments of the hero.
All sophomores are urged to try
out for "Show Shop." The selection to
be read may be obtained from Miss
Ruth Taylor, Miss Christine Weather
by, P. G. Whealton, R. M. L.
Levy, and D. M. Smith.

"The Show Shop" is instructive only
because it reveals a very great deal
about the stage, and the romantic
lives of stage people, at the same time
telling a great many things that
everyone wants to know, —about sal
aries, managers, stage "mothers,"
leading women in love with leading
men, leading men in love with leading
women, midnight rehearsals, failures,
successes and the bright glims of
Broadway.
James Forbes is the author of "The
Show Shop." He also wrote "The
Chorus Lady," one of the most suc
cessful theatrical dramas ever writ
ten. The play chosen for presenta
tion here is still very much in its
teens, having started a long run at
the Hudson Theater in New York, a
year last January, with Douglas Fair
banks and Patricia Collinge in the
leading roles.
Romance is the atmosphere of the
Forbes comedy, the romance of a
young girl of the stage and a "man
about-town" who is railroaded into
playing the leading role in "A Drop
of Poison" (the inside drama of 'The
Show Shop') with the understanding
that the play will fail —so he can
marry the girl. "A Drop of Poison,"
with its title altered to "Dora's
Dilemma," to insure its failure, is de
clared a hit. Thereby hangs the tale
that runs through four acts of mer
riment, located in the manager's of
fice, behind the scenes at rehearsal,
on the stage during the crucial act of
the inside melo-drama, and in the
bachelor apartments of the hero.
All sophomores are urged to try
out for "Show Shop." The selection to
be read may be obtained from Miss
Ruth Taylor, Miss Christine Weather
by, P. G. Whealton, R. M. L.
Levy, and D. M. Smith.
