# Former Quad Editor Married at Martinez
## 
### 
"I'm not in a position to give ad
vice yet. I was married only yes
terday," said Hob Worthy, former
Quad editor, student body president,
and varsity basketball player, today.
"Wait a year or so and I'll tell you."
Accordingly, waiting is in order, as
is also a story on the newly-weds.
Some three years ago, A. E. Worthy,
'15, met Miss Irene Lawrence at a
church social in Palo Alto. Worthy
was studying law at Stanford, while
Miss Lawrence was in training at the
Peninsula Hospital.
During the latter part of his career
at Stanford, Worthy found it neces
sary to go to the hospital so much
that the Guild refused to pay his ex
rencc became as consistent a basket
ball fan as Worthy was a player.
Worthy and Miss Lawrence were
married at Martinez, yesterday after
noon. Worthy will continue to study
at the Berkeley Theological Seminary
for another year before entering the
ministry.
