# FRESHMEN DEFEAT FIFTEEN FROM U. OF P.
## CARDINAL SCORE 6-0 Good Kicking Saves the Game. Ambert and Tilton Are Point-Winners 
### 
Minus Jay Risling and "Bud" Lar
kin, two of the early season's best
ruggers, the Stanford freshmen de
feated the fast College of Pacific
fifteen yesterday, on the opponent's
field. After one hour of close play,
the ball see-sawing back and forth
most of the time, the final count read
(i to 0, the Cardinal registering two
trys, neither one being converted.
The football lot of the Orange and
Black team was strange to Stanford
players, as it was hard ground, with
at least one inch of dust on the sur
face. This proved a handicap and
made the game as a whole slow and
devoid of passing rushes, which make
rugby a favorite game with the spec
tators. Of these, there was an abund
ance, the bleachers being crowded.
Freshmen On Defense.
In the early stages of the game,
the College of Pacific team showed
the results of Coach Flannagan's ex
cellent training, and held the fresh
men on defense, but the first year
men soon brought the ball down to
their opponents' goal. Goal kicks
by Dalton and Wright saved scores.
Just before the first half closed, "Red"
Aubert picked up the ball as it came
out of a ruck, and went over. In
the excitement after an unsuccessful
attempt at conversion, Tilton secured
the ball, and after a short run, took
it across for the last score of the
day.
The second half was even through
out,both teams fighting hard. Sperry
and Walker featured for the College
of Pacific, while Joerg and Meyers
did good work for the freshmen. The
lineups follow:
Freshmen —Wayland, Darneson, and
Aubert, front rank; Millington and
Atchison, middle rank; Gardner, Mey
ers and Stearn, rear rank; Davis,
