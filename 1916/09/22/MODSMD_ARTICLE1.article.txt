# SWIMMING MARKS ARE IN DANGER TOMORROW
## ROSS TO BE PRESSED Freshmen Scheduled to Meet Commerce High in Tank Competition 
### 
Instructor Brandsten is quite con
fident that several new Stanford tank
records will have been made when the
results of tomorrow's swimming meet
between the freshmen and the Com
merce high school squad of San Fran
cisco are made known. Among the
marks which are in danger of going
by the boards are the 50-, 100-, and
220-yard dashes, and the 50-yard back
stroke.
Goodman vs. Ross.
In the 50-yard sprint, "Sandy"
Goodman of the prep school aggrega
tion will urge Ross to his utmost.
Goodman is credited with doing
:24 2-5 in the short distance at San
Diego, which is better than the exist
ing Stanford tank record. Ross has
also negotiated the distance in about
the same time. A battle royal can
be looked for.
The Stanford record for the 100-
yard event at present stands at
:58 2-5, made by Duke Kahanomoku.
In a previous meet Ross finished the
distance in about the same time, and
when pressed by Goodman is likely
to better his previous record. The
220-vard mark of 3:01, made by Ludv
Langer in the local tank, also appears
on the verge of giving way to a bet
ter effort in tomorrow's meet. Sev
eral men have been showing up well
in the backstroke and promise to bet
ter the time of :34 in the 50-yard
event, which is the local record, made
by Buckland last year.
The diving squad will give an ex
hibition of high springboard diving,
since there are 110 diving events sched
uled in the meet. The freshmen and
high school swimmers will compete
in all events. There are also two
events scheduled for the novice
squad, and three for the varsity squad.
Ladies are especially invited to the
meet, which will begin at 10:30
o'clock. Twenty-five cents or a stu
dent body ticket will admit.
