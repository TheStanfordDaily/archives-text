Activity was suspended on the cam
pus yesterday by a freak electrical
storm which swept over this part of
the state, starting with San Jose as
a center. A curtain of black clouds
rolled in about 2 o'clock, leaving the
country in semi-darkness, bringing
lightning, which played havoc with the
lights. According to the Palo Alto
weather man, John Squires, about .36
of an inch of rain fell yesterday after
noon and last night.
The storm was most severe at San
Jose, where many street cars, houses
and trees were struck by lightning,
and crops damaged by rain.
According to assistant weather bu
reau forecaster Reed of San Fran
cisco, the storm, which was an un
usual occurrence for this part of the
country, was caused by a trough of
low pressure which extended over
California, Arizona and Oregon. Un
settled weather, with showers, is pre
dicted for tonight and Saturday.
