# Rowell Asked to Speak for Local Hughes' Club
## 
### 
Chester Rowell, "the brains of the
Progressive movement in tlie west,"
will be asked to speak at the Univer
sity to the Republicans and members
of the local Hughes Club, next week,
according to T. L. Smith, '14, manager
of Stanford Union.
The 30 or more members who turned
out to the itaitial meeting of the
Hughes Club last night, decided to
postpone the elections and further or
ganization until the middle of next
week. This was felt necessary on ac
count of the absence of a number of
prospective members, due to inclement
weather.
