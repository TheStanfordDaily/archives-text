# OLYMPIC CLUB TO PLAY CARDINAL VARSITY
## FIVE GAMES SLATED Freshman and Berkeley High Scheduled for Curtain Raiser 
### 
Rugby from breakfast to dinner is
the card that is offered for tomorrow
by Graduate Manager Behrens, five
and possibly six games being on the
schedule for the Cardinal teams. In
the morning, a squad from the pea
nut division will meet the fifteen from
San Mateo high, and there is a possi
bility of a Concord team meeting a
second peanut fifteen, though this is
still undecided. At 1:30, the fresh
men team will tangle with the crack
Berkeley high fifteen.
Immediately following this, the
Varsity-Olympic Club feature will be
staged, and at 4 the final contest on
the home turf will take place, the
third varsity meeting the Bushrod
Park boys of Oakland. While the
afternoon contests are taking place
here, the second varsity will journey
to Santa Clara, where they will have
the Sodality Club as opponents, this
club team being made up of former
Santa Clara and San .Jose high school
stars.
Berkeley Cracks vs. 1020.
Berkeley High vs. Stanford fresh
men will undoubtedly furnish a fine
rugby exhibition, as the Berkeley
boys are supposed to have one of the
crack high school teams of the state,
and in fact have captured the state
interscholastic championship the last
year or so. The Cardinal babes will
go into the contest with much the
same lineup as heretofore, though
some few shifts have been made by
Coach Brown. Larkin will be back
at half again as will .lay Risling at
five-eighths. "Snowball" Angell will
be seen at center-three tomorrow.
Pete Flannigan will referee this strug
gle.
No Olympic Changes.
Practically the same lineup as met
the varsity here before will be used
tomorrow. Nor has Coach Brown
made startling changes, Townsend at
sub-half, West, wing, Chandler, rear
rank, being about the only new faces
offered. W. P. Fuller will have charge
of the whistle for this game.
As a final contest, the Bushrod
Park team of Oakland meet the third
varsity. The Bushrod team, com
posed of high school stars of the bay
district, will furnish plenty of com
petition for third team men, as they
have a victory over Oakland Tech
nical school and Fremont high school
to their credit.
Graduate Manager Behrens expects
the band on hand tomorrow to en
liven the occasion and the five candi
dates for the yell leader position will
also no through the usual antics.
Admission will be season tickets or
fifty cents.
