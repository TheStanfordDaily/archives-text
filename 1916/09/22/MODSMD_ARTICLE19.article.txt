Rumors and accusations have been
whispered about in far off corners of
the campus, intimating that The Stan
ford Illustrated Review is in the
nature of a wild-cat periodical organ
ized for the purpose of filling the cof
fers of its editorial board and man
ager with filthy shekels. None
stoop so low as to suggest facts, but
rather wisely shake their heads in
stern disapproval, and cast forth gobs
of slander.

It is a curious coincidence in this
world of ours, that when any individ
ual or group of men formulates and
engineers 011 its own initiative, any
thing worth while, a large flock of
the little men pout and villify the ven
ture. The Illustrated, at present, is
humping against that same old
stumbling block. If the public al
lows itself to be deluded into believ
ing wild tales that rival Baron von
Munchausen in absurdity, a grave in
justice results.

An examination of the manager's
financial statement at this time, shows
The Illustrated is behind in its ac
counts, due to heavy initial expend
iture. By October, however, the slate
will be cleared from all debt, the
profits thereafter going right back
into the magazine to help it improve
and grow. VVbat would be more ab
surd then than the charge that the
periodical is a stepping-stone of
financial magnates.

What is more, The Stanford Illus
trated Review is an undertaking that
merits the approbation of the student
body. It entered a field transgressed
by 110 journalistic enterprise. Breezy
articles on all sides of University
life, action pictures that rival Bathe,
and snappy comments, feature the
magazine. Those sleuths that indict
the Illustrated with wild-catting had
best turn their attention to knitting,
where their torpidity will have a
harmless pasture.
