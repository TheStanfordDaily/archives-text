CONVENT OK COLLEUE?
(See communication published yes
terday.)
The scene is (he council chamber
el' the llotchkiss Convent for Girls,
during the meeting of the Women's
Student Council. There are live mem
bers present, four of which are con
servative and careful, and one radical
and rather modern.
Lucy Ipswich—As 1 was saying,
gurruls, we'd better enforce a strict
leave-of-absence rule.
Marylynn Worcestershire —Yes, it
would please our dear guardians.
Emma Goldfish (the radical) —Hang
the guardians! Give me liberty or
give me death!
Gretchen O'Leary—Tut tut, my
dear!
Eunice Belmont —I have a plan.
Emma —Spring it!
Eunice—We must require that every
girl who leaves the convent must tell
where she is going.
Emma—Good!
Gretchen—Emma approves. That
isn't strict enuf.
Eunice —No, not nearly. But we'll
make every girl who leaves tell US
where she is going.
Chorus —Oh, lovely!
Eunice —Considering the matter
further, I think we had better de
mand that every girl ASK us for per
mission to leave.
Lucy—Now you're talking!
Eunice —If she's going out in the
garden, she must ask one of us for
permission; if she's taking a walk,
she must ask two. How does that
sound?
Lucy—Spiffy.
Eunice —And if she's going bicycle
riding she must ask three of us.
Marylynn—Yes, Eunice. And if she
goes auto riding, she must ask four
of us.
Eunice —You have it, sister! And
if she goes to the big city she must
ask ALL of us for permission.
Marylynn—Yes, and
Emma Goldfish (interrupting)— Yes,
and I suppose she has to tell ALL of
you with whom she is going, and why
and where and when, and how much
he will spend, and when he asked
you and why; and something else T
want to know is this —is this a con
vent OR is it a college?
