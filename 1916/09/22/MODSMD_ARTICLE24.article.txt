### 
A new conception of the periodic
system and the structure of atoms
was expounded to professors and stu
dents of the Chemistry department
this morning by Professor W. D.
Harkins of the University of Chicago
who has been engaged in research
work on these subjects for several
years past. Professor llarkins re
ceived his early training under Dr. J.
M. Stillman, graduating with the class
of 1900, and taking the Ph.D. degree
here in 1908. For a time he was pro
fessor of Chemistry at the University
of Montana, and now holds the same
