It appeared in the Scientific Monthly,
and in the "Recueil des Rapports,"

Summarizing his article on Annex

"No right of conquest should be rec

force, as a result of war or conquest.
Transfer of allegiance should be left
to the vote of the people concerned,
and expressed in the secret ballot,
without duress."
