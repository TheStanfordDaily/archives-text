# Game and Dinner for Soccer Eleven Nov. 30
## 
### 
The Stanford soccer team has been
invited to journey to Sacramento on
Thanksgiving Day, November 30, to
meet a team of stars of the Capitol
City. The local players have sent in
their acceptance to the contest and to
a dinner that is to go with it.
Changing the date of the game with
California to November 25th makes
this contest possible, as one of the big
contests with the Blue and Gold was
slated for the Turkey Holiday.
