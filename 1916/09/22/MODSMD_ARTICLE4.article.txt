# Too Much Class Is Bad For Jolly-Up-- Frosh Release It
## 
### 
A bird in the hand isn't always worth
two in a bush, especially when the
bird's a woman. Then, again, too
many birds spoil the broth.
So say the freshmen.
Furthermore, the next time the class
of '20 gives a jolly-up, it will get into
a glass house and not throw bids at
the women of the campus.
Now we can go on with the story.
The Class of Twenty is giving a
jolly-up. It sought to be exclusive.
Then someone put a bug under the
freshman bonnet, figuratively speak
ing, only, and the entire "500" of
Stanford wore invited to make up for
the dearth of feminine class.
Then the bug got stifled under the
freshman bonnet. Graduate, senior,
and junior women are too aged and
motherly to suit freshman ideals.
Now the freshmen men will dance
only with freshman and sophomore
damsels at the jolly-up Saturday night
in the Armory.
