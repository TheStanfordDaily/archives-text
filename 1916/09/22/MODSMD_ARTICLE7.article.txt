### 
Debating for women is a reality at
Stanford. For a number of years in
the past, agitations with this end in
view have been started, only to fail.
Without any outside prompting, a
group of fifteen women met last eve
ning in the Little Theater to form a
Stanford women's debating club.
This club will meet every Thursday
evening at S o'clock, according 1o
present plans.
Teams from the women's society
will compete with those from each of
the men's debating organizations later
in the semester, and there is a possi
bility of intercollegiate platform con
tests with the women of California
and other universities.
Four Out For Teams.
Four women are out for the inter
collegiate teams that will meet Cali
fornia and U. S. C. this fall, and others
may follow their example. A record
number of men will compete in these
tryouts, a week from today, Friday,
September 29, in the Little Theater.
Names of all wishing to enter the
competition should be handed at once
to Debating Coach K. E. Leib or
