# Screen to Assist Athletic Training
## New Projecting Machine Makes Illustrated Lectures Possible 
### 
Pictures of Stanford athletes in ac
tion, projected on a screen by a "Hal
optican" projecting machine, which
was received yesterday at the Physical
Training department, will hereafter
form an integral part of athletic
training at Stanford, and represents
an upward step in the idea of lec
tures for athletes which was inaug
urated last semester by "liic" Tem
pleton, in connection with track.
Photographs of any sort can be used
in the machine, which makes it espec
ially valuable for the guidance of
athletes. It is the intention of the
Physical Training department to use
photographs of well known athletes
showing proper form in track events,
football plays, etc.
In line with this educational fea
ture for the development of Stanford
athletes, the department is making a
collection of photographs of athletes
and games which will be displayed in
the gymnasium. Among the excellent
photographs already acquired is the
finish of last semester's intercollegiate
hurdle race, which was won by Mur
ray, a picture of Ralph Rose in ac
tion, and another of the All Blacks
in action, taken at the time of their
invasion of California.
