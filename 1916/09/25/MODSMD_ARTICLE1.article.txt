# DR. JORDAN TELLS OF STANFORD'S FIRST DAYS
## NOT BOUND BY PAST Roble Built From Remnants of Encina to Bring Women Here Early 
### 
For the purpose of acquainting
freshmen and other new students
with his life work and with the be
ginning of Stanford University, Dr.
Jordan last night gave his hearers
at the Encina Hall meeting an hour
of interesting reminiscences, during
the course of which lie clearly out
lined the broad lines along which the
founders of the University worked in
building Stanford.
Not Bound By Tradition.
"We determined not to be bound by
the tradition of the past," said Dr.
Jordan. "Senator Stanford was es
pecially emphatic on this point and
often asserted that he did not want
the University to be bound by outworn
customs of other institutions. The
finger posts all pointed forward, with
nothing backward.
"We decided to make no class dis
tinctions, and it was only to satisfy
a common demand that Dr. Elliott
finally hit upon the plan of printing
in the Student directory the the num
ber of credits each man had made.
Challenges Term "Co-ed."
"I was never able to understand
why women were any more 'co-edu
cated' than the men, and as we
wanted women here we decided to
have them 011 the same plane with the
men. Incidentally 1 have found that
girls are necessary to teach some
manners. We even went so far as
build Jtoble Hall out of the remnants
of Encina in order to get the women
here on the day the University
opened. k
Itefused to Coddle Languages.
"One of the commonest faults of
universities is that they coddle some
subjects, such as Latin and Greek.
We determined to get away from that
plan, and have never offered higher
degrees to students who have studied
these subjects. We wanted the stu
dents to choose for themselves. Four
years of choosing for one's self is
bound to have a beneficial effect. The
cut and dried courses are like ready
made suits; they don't fit anybody.
Discipline From Within.
"Discipline consits of obedience
within. You should have your own
head under your own hat. Be abso
lutely obedient, but be obedient to
yourself. The ideal of social service
rather than that of service to arbi
trary order is the ideal we have held
up here.
Wanted Little Machinery.
"In getting Stanford under way we
wanted as little machinery as pos
sible. We desired to do away with
the imposing, but thoroughly useless,
processions of professors in caps and
gowns. We wanted to make it so
that a man did not have to go through
a lot of useless formality to get his
degree. Many men have done per
fectly foolish things in order to get
their Ph.D. degree. Wisdom is know
ing what to do next, virtue is doing
it. Religion is knowing what is the
right thing and what is the wrong
thing."
In beginning his talk, Dr. Jordan
told of his early teaching days, when
he was president of the University of
Indiana. He told of how after seven
years as head of that institution he
was called upon to undertake the or
ganizing of Stanford. He said that
among the young professors who were
making a name for themselves at that
time and who he tried to induce to
come to Stanford, was Woodrow
Wilson, then just "breaking in." Dr.
. Jordan said he made it a practice not
to hire any professors who were older
than he was, and consequently he
kept, the faculty young and subject to
progressive ideas.
