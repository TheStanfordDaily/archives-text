Dr. Angell is glad to he back. He
said so himself, and displayed his
pleasure by the questions he asked.
"How's tilings in athletics? Rugby
coming right along—that's good. Rig
ger turnouts at the games? I'm glad
to hear that. And over at California
—who are they playing? Winning
from the Olympics every week. 23 to
0! Well, they'll soon tire of Hiat."
For seven months, Dr. Angell tour
|ed Belgium, for the most part alone,
but occasionally accompanied by
American delegates. His work was
to investigate and report upon the
success or failure of Belgian relief.
Two reports have already been made
to the executive body of the rejief as
sociation. The third, a comprehen
sive report to be prepared for publi
cation, Dr. Angell hopes to complete
before the close of the present year.
