# DR. FRANK ANGELL RETURNS FROM BELGIUM
## "GLAD TO BE HOME" Believes Belgium Relief Work Is Greatest Humanitarian Enterprise 
### 
Seven months in Belgium, working
on a report for the Committee on Re
lief has not changed Dr. Frank An
gell, for 24 years a member of the
Stanford faculty, recent chairman of
the Faculty Athletic Committee, and
now head of the Department of Psy
chology.
Dr. Angell returned yesterday, with
a year of trying experiences added to
those lie lias already known. He re
turned ready for University work, and
at once became a part of the college
unit. Tomorrow he will be seen at
the head of classes in psychology.
Thursday he will tell of his experi
ences at 11 o'clock assembly.

Dr. Angell is glad to he back. He
said so himself, and displayed his
pleasure by the questions he asked.
"How's tilings in athletics? Rugby
coming right along—that's good. Rig
ger turnouts at the games? I'm glad
to hear that. And over at California
—who are they playing? Winning
from the Olympics every week. 23 to
0! Well, they'll soon tire of Hiat."
For seven months, Dr. Angell tour
|ed Belgium, for the most part alone,
but occasionally accompanied by
American delegates. His work was
to investigate and report upon the
success or failure of Belgian relief.
Two reports have already been made
to the executive body of the rejief as
sociation. The third, a comprehen
sive report to be prepared for publi
cation, Dr. Angell hopes to complete
before the close of the present year.
"Seven million people are being
cared for in Belgium," he said.
"They are not facing starvation, but
are suffering from inanition —insuffic-
ient food is weakening them, and les
sening their power to resist such dis
eases as tuberculosis and rickets,
foods makes this condition on inani
tion prevalent.
"Everybody is not suffering from
lack of food —but principally the class
that embraces employees. Wealthy
people are able to buy what they
need. In the country there is not
much misery. Hut in the cities, in
Liege and other industrial cities, con
diitions are at their worst.
"The birth rate has greatly de
clined. And it is among the infants
who have to depend upon milk that
the greatest danger is found. Many
herds of cattle have been taken in
c harge by the Commission for Relief.
The German government has aided
this work by eliminating milk-bear
ing cattle from army requisition.
"They are great people—the Bel
gians; no race could have been more
deserving of this greatest of all char
ities."

Dr. Angell is glad to he back. He
said so himself, and displayed his
pleasure by the questions he asked.
"How's tilings in athletics? Rugby
coming right along—that's good. Rig
ger turnouts at the games? I'm glad
to hear that. And over at California
—who are they playing? Winning
from the Olympics every week. 23 to
0! Well, they'll soon tire of Hiat."
For seven months, Dr. Angell tour
|ed Belgium, for the most part alone,
but occasionally accompanied by
American delegates. His work was
to investigate and report upon the
success or failure of Belgian relief.
Two reports have already been made
to the executive body of the rejief as
sociation. The third, a comprehen
sive report to be prepared for publi
cation, Dr. Angell hopes to complete
before the close of the present year.
"Seven million people are being
cared for in Belgium," he said.
"They are not facing starvation, but
are suffering from inanition —insuffic-
ient food is weakening them, and les
sening their power to resist such dis
eases as tuberculosis and rickets,
foods makes this condition on inani
tion prevalent.
"Everybody is not suffering from
lack of food —but principally the class
that embraces employees. Wealthy
people are able to buy what they
need. In the country there is not
much misery. Hut in the cities, in
Liege and other industrial cities, con
diitions are at their worst.
"The birth rate has greatly de
clined. And it is among the infants
who have to depend upon milk that
the greatest danger is found. Many
herds of cattle have been taken in
c harge by the Commission for Relief.
The German government has aided
this work by eliminating milk-bear
ing cattle from army requisition.
"They are great people—the Bel
gians; no race could have been more
deserving of this greatest of all char
ities."
