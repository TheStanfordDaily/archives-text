# UNIVERSITY CREDIT FOR MILITARY DRILL
## President Wilbur and Major Bugge Agree on Number of Units Allowed 
### 
With the plan in view of immedi
ately increasing the number of men
encased in military training from 160
to 200, Major Bugge today arranged
with President Wilbur to make mili
tary drill more accessible to Univer
sity men.
Students who present themselves at
once will bo admitted to the ranks,
and will not be handicapped beyond
the extent of making up a few hours
work to put them on a par with those
men who have drilled for a fortnight.
Three Hour* Work IVr Week.
Registration in military may be for
three hours each week, ; or for daily
drill. The former nets one unit of
University credit, the latter two units.
Men who cannot attend every day on
account of other athletic activity may
drill three times each week.
Upon securing permission from
Major Bugge. students who do not
seek credit, may join the military
corps whenever they are able to find
the time requisite. Major Bugge de
clared today that he is particularly
desirous that senior men enroll, in
asmuch as it is from the upperelass
ranks that a majority of the student
officers will be recruited.
