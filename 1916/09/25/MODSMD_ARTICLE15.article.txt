# AN EXCHEQUER CHECK
## 
### 
University democracy oftentimes is
characterized by an exhibition of
shiftlessness and inefficiency, due en
tirely to a negligent laissez-faire prac
tice of permitting affairs to care for
themselves. Excellent proof of this
indictment can be found in the whole
atmosphere which pervades the in
excusable conduct of class finances.
* * * * 9fc * * *
Freshmen or Juniors, whatever may
be the group, assemble semi-annually
with the resulting election of some
poor devil to the ollice of class treas
urer. If the sorry individual is up
right, he maintains a hap-hazard ac
counting system carried on in a Y.
M. C. A. calendar, and attempts to
settle long-standing obligations of
suffering merchants by the scanty
contribution of a few silver pieces
from a handful of unsophisticated
mates. However, should the class
financier be selfishly inclined, after
having ambitiously collected a pot of
gold he departs thence, far distant
from this educational environment.
********
Like'any other flock of sheep that
has been continually shorn, we merely
lament the utter inefficiency of the
entire system, although when viewed
from any angle, it is indefensible. We
are perfectly content to allow a treas
urer to conduct his business kinder
garten fashion; to have the mer
chants charge bills to profit and loss;
—or else hear that the official has
pocketed the surplus.
********
Yet the introduction of a few sim
ple regulations, strictly adhered to
and enforced, would satisfactorily
clear up all difficulties. First, ail
class finances should pass through the
central accounting office of the stu
dent body, where accurate history of
debits and credits may be secured.
Second, a report should be made at
the beginning of each month to both
the class and student body account
ant of the existing financial condi
tion. Finally, at the conclusion of
each semester, the retiring treasurer
should deposit all funds with the ac
countant. The installation of the
above advocated plan could not but
improve the status of existing class
finances, which have become paleozoic
in management.
