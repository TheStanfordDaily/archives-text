Warning that the national prayer
of Americans is likely to be "God
give 11s prosperity," Rev. Charles W.
Gilkey preached his final sermon at
Stanford 011 the text, "He granted
them their request but sent leanness
unto their souls."
That the average collegt student is
getting everything he wants, at the
expense of his inner self, is the fear
of Rev. Gilkey. "Reverse the text to
get its full meaning," he said. "lie
denied them their request but sent
riches unto their souls."
"Over and over again in life we
may re-discover the fact that the
pathway to inner riches is the path
way of outer denial. The things that,
our fathers worked for, we college
students have on request—whether it
is education or automobiles.
"Drinking all the pleasures of care
free college life, we must take care
that the verdict be not 'ITe gave them
their request but sent lean-ness into
their souls.'"
