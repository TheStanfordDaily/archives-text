# MORLEY TALKS ON ANCIENT AMERICA
## Early Civilization Equal to That of Europe, Says Noted Archaeologist 
### 
That a civilization existed in South
America for the first fifteen hundred
years of the Christian era which com
pared with that of Europe, is the
opinion of Dr. Sylvanus G. Morley,
who lectured Friday evening in the
Little Theater, under the auspices of
the Stanford Archaeology society. Dr.
Morley, who was the guest of Pro
fessor H. R. Fairclough of the Latin
department, illustrated his lecture
with slides.
Mayas Far Advanced.
"The heiroglyphics left by the Maya
Indians in Central America, show
that they were as far advanced in
civilization during the first centuries
after the birth of Christ, as were the
nations of Europe and Asia at that
time," said Dr. Morley, when inter
viewed here. The Maya civilization
had grown to its height and dwindled
away to its last fctage when Columbus
discovered Americaâ€”having never
been seen by white men. The Mayas
were followed by the Aztecs and
Incas, who copied their accomplish
ments, but never reached the height
of their predecessors. According to
Dr. Morley, the Mayas built monu
ments in the plazas of their towns,
and on these every five years was in
scribed their history for that time in
heiroglyphics. It is from these that
explorers are unearthing the story of
ancient civilization, full of proofs of
former great wealth, civic develop
ment, and comparative culture.
