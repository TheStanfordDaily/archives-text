Santa Clara rugby team defeated
St. Ignatius College team of San
Francisco by an overwhelming score
of 43 to 0 yesterday on the Santa
Clara turf.' At half-time the score
was 18-0 for Santa Clara, the scoring
being credited chiefly to forward
work. In the second half, however,
the backfield began to work, executing
several passing rushes resulting in
tries for the Mission ruggers. Mil
burn starred l'or Santa Clara.

"Doc" Reynolds now has three on
his cripple list with sprained ankles,
the trio being Winham, Pettingill, and
Pelouze, Bob injurying his ankle late
Friday afternoon. Pettingill will be
back in the game tonight. In addi
tion, Saturday, Bart Gillespie received
a gash over the eye, necessitating a
couple of stitches, and C. C. Cowin,
freshman, did likewise, both occurring
in the morning's Peanut-San Mateo
contest. Phil Sample is still out of
practice on account of his eyes, but
expects to be back soon. Bert West
is out for a day or two with an in
jured knee.

Graduate Manager "Squire" Beh
rens was wearing one of those smiles
that won't rub off, Saturday, from the
time that the gates to the football
bleachers were opened, until the end
of the day's rugby contests, the rea
son being the steady crowd that
poured in until one of the largest
crowds in many days was on hand
to take in the games.

"Dink" Templeton pulled off a good
joke on himself when he attempted to
end Saturday's game when he had
been awarded a free kick after the
whistle blew by kicking to touch a
few yards back of the point from
where he stood. Referee Palmer
Fuller would not stand for anything
like that, so gave the Olympics a
scrum from that point.

Timekeeping in Saturday's games
should have been exceedingly accurate
for four men were handling the
watch and making the necessary cal
culations for time taken out. It's a
good thing to have accurate time,
anyhow, especially when the entire
group of officials have season tickets,
making no passes necessary.

Charlie Long played a nice game at
five-eighths Saturday, getting away
to some nice runs, getting his passes
in at the right time, and also tackling
in excellent shape. Dachmund and
Carroll lived up to their reputations
as backfield experts.
