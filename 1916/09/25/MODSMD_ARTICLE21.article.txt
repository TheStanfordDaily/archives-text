# Freshman Jolly-Up for Everybody But the Class of 1920
## 
### 
Society Item: â€”Senior, junior
and sophomore men were enter
tained by the freshman class at a
delightful dance held in the Palo
Alto Armory, Saturday evening.
The affair was in the nature of a
jolly-up given in honor of fresh
men and sophomore women.
Among those present were sev
eral score of upperclassmen and
few members of the class of 1920.
That is the naked truth of the
freshman jolly-up as staged Sat
urday. But it wasn't meant to
have been that way at all. In
fact, the affair was to have been
a very exclusive party. All but
freshmen women were barred.
This idea seemed despotic.
Then women of all classes were
invited. This met with opposi
tion. So sophomore women were
the guests of the 1920 men. But
the jolly-up didn't jolly that way.
For a few rounds the dance
was distinctly a freshman func
tion. But as soon as the fair
partners had become acclimated,
upperclassmen took charge and
relegated the host of quivering
twenties to the scrap heap as
chaperones for what few wall
parties were present.
