# Initial Soccer Game 2-1 Cardinal Defeat
## Penalty Kick Which Results in Winning Goal to Be Protested 
### 
In the first Soccer League game of
the season, the All Stars, composed
of former Stanford and California
alumni, scored two goals to one for
the Stanford Varsity, on the Golden
Gate grounds in Oakland, Saturday.
A protest against counting the game
in the series has been filed with the
league olhcials, in which it is as
serted that a penalty kick (which re
sulted in a goal for the All Stars)
was unjustly awarded by the umpire.
In the first half, Williams, acting
as goal keeper for the Cardinal, car
ried the ball three steps, upon which
grounds the umpires awarded a pen
alty kick to the opposing aggregation.
It is the opinion of W. H. Maloney,
president of the league, backed by
the highest soccer authority, that a
penalty goal cannot be awarded
against goal keeper. This contention
was admitted at the close of the con
test by members of the All Star team.
It is thought certain that the game
will either be played over or called
a tie.
Stanford's single tally was scored
by Westenhaver, who was shifted from
his regular position to center-half, to
take the place of Rooney, who was
out of the game from injuries re
ceived last Tuesday. Farrel and Eyer
in the backfield, and Alderton, in the
forward line, played consistently.
The lineup of the teams follow:
Stanford —Williams, Egger, Farrell,
Yewell, Westenhaver, McClung, Mc-
Mahon, Adams, Alderton, Weller,
1 law ley.
All Stars —Chris, Rizzo, Hoag, Cork,
Kiser, Price, Jones, Reynolds, Wheat
ly, Iloppe, Mittie.
