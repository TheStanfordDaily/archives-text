It happened in the library this
morning.
She was a sweet young miss of
the class of '20.
He was a sturdy lad of the
class of '20. They were sitting on
opposite sides of the aisle in the
main reading room. Both of them
had evidently heard of the great
Stanford democracy. She hap
pened to glance across the aisle.
He was smiling at her. She
dropped her eyes. Then she raised
them, —and she smiled. Ditto and
ditto.
He crossed to where she was
sitting. They started a conver
sation, but under some objection
on her part. "But I don't even
know yonr name," she said.
Here entered another character.
He had overheard her remark.
"What's this,"he demanded. "Do
you know this young lady's
name?" "No, sir," replied the
blushing frosh. "Well, then,
scamper out of here, as quick as
you know how." The names of
the first two parties are un
known, but the third party was
Dr. Wilbur.
