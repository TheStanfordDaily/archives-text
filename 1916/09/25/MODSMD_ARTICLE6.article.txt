# WATERLOO GAME FOUGHT BY FROSH
## VARSITY BACKS WIN Berkeley High Players Show Cardinals How Rugby Squad Can Work 
### 
Things were mixed up on the rugby
s!ate for Saturday. The Varsity
should have played the Berkeley
High, and the Olympics should have
picked on the freshmen. The third
varsity game was all right—if you
don't care what you say.
Not that the Varsity was in bad
form, but that the Berkeley High rug
gers were good—decidedly good.
They played the best all around
game of rugby seen on the turf this
season, and perhaps in other seasons
—that's risky comparison to make.
First Half Was Varsity's.
Propriety demands that the Varsity
be mentioned first. Honesty demands
that thoy be given everything prac
tically, in the first half. It was theirs
meaning the backfield, Walker,
Long, Lachmund, Carroll, and Tem
pleton. At the end of the half, the
score stood 23 to 3, .loe Urban having
wiggled over the line for one score.
The second half was very much of a
toss-up—arithmetic gives slightly the
better of it, fifteen points to thirteen
for the Winged-0 men.
Danny and Joe Hay.
Among the features of the game
were Danny Carroll's rnns, in which
he tried to get away from Joe Urban's
playful tackles. Danny didn't have
the faculty of slipping past Joe. Art
Erb was in half-back form, in spite
of his added proportions. Some good
sporting editor would do well to de
cide who is the better half-back, Erb
or his successor.
The Freshman - Berkeley game
opened with bans —naturally—and
with a surprise, as "Hie" Temple
ton's huskies rushed the local babes
down the field. Lucky kicks by An- .
gell and Needham put the freshmen in .
la better position, but a Berkeley
player got through the home pack
like lightning for a score.
Freshmen Retaliate.
The freshmen retaliated, and man
aged to score after Strain, fullback,
dropped a kick to touch a couple of
yards from the line. The half ended
to 3 for the visitors.
In the second half the trans-bay
ruggers had everything their way, de
spite hard fighting. Speed in getting
under way, taking passes, kicking,
tackling—in fact, all that rugby teams
need —seemed theirs. Miller Peter
son trounced across for three tries
and Jacobson for another.
Larkin Mas Strong.
Something may have been lacking
with the freshmen, in spite of the fact
that they met a better team than
they were Saturday. Larkin played
his usual strong and intelligent game.
Risling and Angell were not up to
form. Jeorg and Strain proved to be
the main defense in the backfield.
The main features of the contest
were that the Berkeleyites tackled to
stop their men. The freshmen did
not always do that. Once they start
ed the visitors were off with a rush
that carried them along. The fresh
men were slow in getting under way.
Perhaps this accounts for the 23 to
3 score.
Bushrod Playground defeated the
third varsity in the final home turf
contest 8 to 6, in a ragged and un
interesting game.
Stanford AH Blacks were victorious
over the Sodality Club at Santa Clara
to the extent of (5 to 3, in a hard and
fighting' game.
San Mateo high school defeated the
first peanuts 15 to 8 in .the morning,
and Lick High won over Palo Alto 8
to 3.

First Half Was Varsity's.
Propriety demands that the Varsity
be mentioned first. Honesty demands
that thoy be given everything prac
tically, in the first half. It was theirs
meaning the backfield, Walker,
Long, Lachmund, Carroll, and Tem
pleton. At the end of the half, the
score stood 23 to 3, .loe Urban having
wiggled over the line for one score.
The second half was very much of a
toss-up—arithmetic gives slightly the
better of it, fifteen points to thirteen
for the Winged-0 men.
Danny and Joe Hay.
Among the features of the game
were Danny Carroll's rnns, in which
he tried to get away from Joe Urban's
playful tackles. Danny didn't have
the faculty of slipping past Joe. Art
Erb was in half-back form, in spite
of his added proportions. Some good
sporting editor would do well to de
cide who is the better half-back, Erb
or his successor.
The Freshman - Berkeley game
opened with bans —naturally—and
with a surprise, as "Hie" Temple
ton's huskies rushed the local babes
down the field. Lucky kicks by An- .
gell and Needham put the freshmen in .
la better position, but a Berkeley
player got through the home pack
like lightning for a score.
Freshmen Retaliate.
The freshmen retaliated, and man
aged to score after Strain, fullback,
dropped a kick to touch a couple of
yards from the line. The half ended
to 3 for the visitors.
In the second half the trans-bay
ruggers had everything their way, de
spite hard fighting. Speed in getting
under way, taking passes, kicking,
tackling—in fact, all that rugby teams
need —seemed theirs. Miller Peter
son trounced across for three tries
and Jacobson for another.
Larkin Mas Strong.
Something may have been lacking
with the freshmen, in spite of the fact
that they met a better team than
they were Saturday. Larkin played
his usual strong and intelligent game.
Risling and Angell were not up to
form. Jeorg and Strain proved to be
the main defense in the backfield.
The main features of the contest
were that the Berkeleyites tackled to
stop their men. The freshmen did
not always do that. Once they start
ed the visitors were off with a rush
that carried them along. The fresh
men were slow in getting under way.
Perhaps this accounts for the 23 to
3 score.
Bushrod Playground defeated the
third varsity in the final home turf
contest 8 to 6, in a ragged and un
interesting game.
Stanford AH Blacks were victorious
over the Sodality Club at Santa Clara
to the extent of (5 to 3, in a hard and
fighting' game.
San Mateo high school defeated the
first peanuts 15 to 8 in .the morning,
and Lick High won over Palo Alto 8

were Danny Carroll's rnns, in which
he tried to get away from Joe Urban's
playful tackles. Danny didn't have
the faculty of slipping past Joe. Art
Erb was in half-back form, in spite
of his added proportions. Some good
sporting editor would do well to de
cide who is the better half-back, Erb
or his successor.
The Freshman - Berkeley game
opened with bans —naturally—and
with a surprise, as "Hie" Temple
ton's huskies rushed the local babes
down the field. Lucky kicks by An- .
gell and Needham put the freshmen in .
la better position, but a Berkeley
player got through the home pack
like lightning for a score.
Freshmen Retaliate.
The freshmen retaliated, and man
aged to score after Strain, fullback,
dropped a kick to touch a couple of
yards from the line. The half ended
to 3 for the visitors.
In the second half the trans-bay
ruggers had everything their way, de
spite hard fighting. Speed in getting
under way, taking passes, kicking,
tackling—in fact, all that rugby teams
need —seemed theirs. Miller Peter
son trounced across for three tries
and Jacobson for another.
Larkin Mas Strong.
Something may have been lacking
with the freshmen, in spite of the fact
that they met a better team than
they were Saturday. Larkin played
his usual strong and intelligent game.
Risling and Angell were not up to
form. Jeorg and Strain proved to be
the main defense in the backfield.
The main features of the contest
were that the Berkeleyites tackled to
stop their men. The freshmen did
not always do that. Once they start
ed the visitors were off with a rush
that carried them along. The fresh
men were slow in getting under way.
Perhaps this accounts for the 23 to
3 score.
Bushrod Playground defeated the
third varsity in the final home turf
contest 8 to 6, in a ragged and un
interesting game.
Stanford AH Blacks were victorious
over the Sodality Club at Santa Clara
to the extent of (5 to 3, in a hard and
fighting' game.
San Mateo high school defeated the
first peanuts 15 to 8 in .the morning,
and Lick High won over Palo Alto 8
to 3.

Things were mixed up on the rugby
s!ate for Saturday. The Varsity
should have played the Berkeley
High, and the Olympics should have
picked on the freshmen. The third
varsity game was all right—if you
don't care what you say.
Not that the Varsity was in bad
form, but that the Berkeley High rug
gers were good—decidedly good.
They played the best all around
game of rugby seen on the turf this
season, and perhaps in other seasons
—that's risky comparison to make.
First Half Was Varsity's.
Propriety demands that the Varsity
be mentioned first. Honesty demands
that thoy be given everything prac
tically, in the first half. It was theirs
meaning the backfield, Walker,
Long, Lachmund, Carroll, and Tem
pleton. At the end of the half, the
score stood 23 to 3, .loe Urban having
wiggled over the line for one score.
The second half was very much of a
toss-up—arithmetic gives slightly the
better of it, fifteen points to thirteen
for the Winged-0 men.
