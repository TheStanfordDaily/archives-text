# Judge's Decision Gives Stanford a Girls' Dormitory
## 
### 
That a home i'or deserving girl stu
dents at Stanford will be built on the
old Timothy Hopkins estate, was as
sured by the decision of Judge R. J.
Welch of Santa Clara county, which
gave to Mrs. Katherine K. Gould, the
noted actress-philanthropist, posses
sion of that estate. According to her
attorneys, Mrs. Gould vowed at the be
ginning of the suit that if she won,
she would dedicate the estate, in her
niothers's name, to the use of a girls*
free home, and in this way befriends
deserving girls of California who
could not otherwise finance their way
through Stanford.
Decision Hinged On Old Letter.
The decision in favor of Mrs. Gould,
which was made last Friday, hinged
upon the discovery of a letter in an
old trunk. Mrs. Gould's attorney
stated that work on the project would
be started as soon as the final steps
in litigation are attended to. The
Hopkins estate is siuated in a beau
tiful spot in the foothills northwest
of the campus, and is a splendid site
for such a home.
