## 
### 
Interesting developments in the
fight for the ballot between the stu
dents ol' Stanford and the county au
thorities were revealed Saturday when
Deputy County Clerk O'Neil of San
.lose pointed out to a representative
of The Daily Palo Alto how the trend
of legal precedent did not favor the
student voter, and at the same time
admitted that the county authorities
are opposing the enfranchisement of
Stanford men in fear tliat their ballots
will be of influence in county pol
itics.
Political Frame-Up.
Investigation today revealed the
opinion that the parties in the county
who are holding the ruling hand in
the question of enfranchisement, are
holding front seats in Hie county po
litical machine.
This is significant especially since
it has been but a matter of a few
years since the county clamped the
lid on the student ballot in order to
check its influence on local political
tickets. At present, according to the
belief of persons acquainted with
county conditions, the southern end of
the county is having difficulty in ex
erting its influence upon the north
ern end. It is evident, then, that the
student vote would disturb this care
fully contrived balance.
