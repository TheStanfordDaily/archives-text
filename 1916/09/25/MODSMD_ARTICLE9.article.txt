# BALLOT FIGHT REACHES HIGH TENSION HERE
## 
### 
Interesting developments in the
fight for the ballot between the stu
dents ol' Stanford and the county au
thorities were revealed Saturday when
Deputy County Clerk O'Neil of San
.lose pointed out to a representative
of The Daily Palo Alto how the trend
of legal precedent did not favor the
student voter, and at the same time
admitted that the county authorities
are opposing the enfranchisement of
Stanford men in fear tliat their ballots
will be of influence in county pol
itics.
Political Frame-Up.
Investigation today revealed the
opinion that the parties in the county
who are holding the ruling hand in
the question of enfranchisement, are
holding front seats in Hie county po
litical machine.
This is significant especially since
it has been but a matter of a few
years since the county clamped the
lid on the student ballot in order to
check its influence on local political
tickets. At present, according to the
belief of persons acquainted with
county conditions, the southern end of
the county is having difficulty in ex
erting its influence upon the north
ern end. It is evident, then, that the
student vote would disturb this care
fully contrived balance.
The question of the power of the in
telligent vote is not a new one. It is
so old, that to win out with the legal
decisions and county officials against
the student franchise, will be a dif
ficult matter. Boiling the matter
down, the light stands between coun
ty officials, the attorney-general of
the states ol' state of California, who
opposes the views taken by the local
authorities, and the men of the Uni
versity, backed up by the head of
their faculty.
liciijuntin Letter Hopeful.
A letter that breathes hope, from
Raymond Benjamin, chief deputy at
torney-general, is indicative of the at
titude the state will take in the ques
tion.
Benjamin stated recently that he
and Attorney-General Webb were
working upon the question of student
rights, and would very soon submit
an opinion to President Wilbur.
