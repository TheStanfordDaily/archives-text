ICE HOCKEY
5 -
—in Sunny California —it's a new
thing, ami a fine thing. Ice hockey
is I'u 11 —but it requires good strong
ankles. Said ankles mean good care
of tlie feet—strong, straight soles, and
solid heels, the kind that Tholts
Brothers have supplied to the cam
pus for years. Phone for the campus
agent—twenty-four hours is sufficient
time for soles and heels.
How About Your Shoes?
AN INSTITUTION
"There's one institution around here that isn't
recognized," observed Co-Edna. "It's a regular
feature of the campus, it influences many people,
it's a joy, and an inspiration. / don't see why it
isn't recognized in the Quad,"
Co-Edna was right again. She did know of an
institution.
"Think how many friendships have been formed
by means of this institution. Think how steady a/id
dependable it is. / couldn't thrive without it.
What's this institution ? Why. everyone knows it's
Wilson's malted milk."
