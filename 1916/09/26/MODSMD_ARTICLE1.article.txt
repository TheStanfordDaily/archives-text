# PELLISSIER HEARS LAST BUGLE CALL
## LONGED FOR CAMPUS Faculty Loses Strong Member of the Younger Guard Through War 
### 
With the arrival of the telegram to
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, telling
of the death of Assistant Professor
Robert E. Pcllissier in France, Stan
ford experienced the loss of a strong
member of the younger guard in the
University faculty. Both students and
faculty members will miss the per
sonality of this man, whose great
wish, as expressed in his letters to
friends, was to return and take up his
work at Stanford.
.Might Have Been Here.
Professor Pcllissier might have had
that opportunity a year ago, when he
was wounded in the shoulder so seri
ously that he could no longer pack
the knapsack of a private. Instead of
securing his release, Professor Pellis
sier took the examination for Saint
Maixent military school, passed, and
after a brief period of training
emerged a sergeant, re-entering the
French ranks, this time as an officer.
Incident Shows Loyalty.
The incident shows the remarkable
loyalty of Professor Pellissier, who
lived in America since he was fifteen
years of age, received his education
in this country, and yet who gave up
his work at Stanford at once on the
declaration of war, to voluntarily en
ter the ranks of France. Letters to
Professor O. M. Johnston, head of
the French department, show the un
weakening loyalty and patriotism of
the former Stanford professor, in
spite of conditions under which he
labored in the army, and his contin
ual desire to return to the Stanford
"farm."
"[ wish for nothing more earnestly
than to return to Stanford and take
up my work once more," Professor
Pellissier wrote last June. "We are
in a new sector, but it is always the
same kind of a life."
"I am back in Alsace after nearly
a year's absence," he wrote, shortly
after his release from the military
school and his confinement in the hos
pital as the result of his wound. "To
think that when I last left this valley
1 sincerely thought 1 should be back
in three or four weeks at the most.
It is about the same mud, the same
never-ending lines of autos, troop
going up and down the valley. 1 wish
1 could be certain of seeing my Stan
lord friends year after next."
Professor Pellissier expected the
war to end within another twelve
months. Professor Johnston received
a letter from him last Saturday, post
marked August 26. Evidently this
was one of the last letters he wrote,
since military delays would prevent
word of his deatli from reaching the
outside world at once. ,
Death in Somnie Valley.
Death overtook Professor Pellissier
while he was leading his charge in
the valley of the Somme river, where
the French and German combatants
have been fighting furiously during
the last month. It was probably in
one of the tremendous French attacks
on German lines that Professor Pel
| iissier died, since his last "post carte"
mentions the terrible thundering of
great guns, which had been deafening
for the last three days and nights
continuously.
Professor Pellissier leaves two sis
ters in this country, one a teacher
in Smith College, Massachusetts, and
another married sister in New York
City, from whom the message of his
death was sent to President Wilbur.
Born In France.
The late Stanford professor was
born in Besancon, France. He grad
uated from Harvard, and came west
to Stanford, where he taught two
years as assistant in the French de
partment. This was in 1909 and 1910.
In 1911 he went to Harvard for grad
uate work, and returned to this Uni
versity in the fall of 1911. Shortly
before leaving for Europe, Professor
Pellissier was promoted to the rank
of assistant professor. He has been
absent on leave from the Board of
Trustees. He was about thirty-five
years of age, and leaves no relatives
in the west.

The incident shows the remarkable
loyalty of Professor Pellissier, who
lived in America since he was fifteen
years of age, received his education
in this country, and yet who gave up
his work at Stanford at once on the
declaration of war, to voluntarily en
ter the ranks of France. Letters to
Professor O. M. Johnston, head of
the French department, show the un
weakening loyalty and patriotism of
the former Stanford professor, in
spite of conditions under which he
labored in the army, and his contin
ual desire to return to the Stanford
"farm."
"[ wish for nothing more earnestly
than to return to Stanford and take
up my work once more," Professor
Pellissier wrote last June. "We are
in a new sector, but it is always the
same kind of a life."
"I am back in Alsace after nearly
a year's absence," he wrote, shortly
after his release from the military
school and his confinement in the hos
pital as the result of his wound. "To
think that when I last left this valley
1 sincerely thought 1 should be back
in three or four weeks at the most.
It is about the same mud, the same
never-ending lines of autos, troop
going up and down the valley. 1 wish
1 could be certain of seeing my Stan
lord friends year after next."
Professor Pellissier expected the
war to end within another twelve
months. Professor Johnston received
a letter from him last Saturday, post
marked August 26. Evidently this
was one of the last letters he wrote,
since military delays would prevent
word of his deatli from reaching the
outside world at once. ,
Death in Somnie Valley.
Death overtook Professor Pellissier
while he was leading his charge in
the valley of the Somme river, where
the French and German combatants
have been fighting furiously during
the last month. It was probably in
one of the tremendous French attacks
on German lines that Professor Pel
| iissier died, since his last "post carte"
mentions the terrible thundering of
great guns, which had been deafening
for the last three days and nights
continuously.
Professor Pellissier leaves two sis
ters in this country, one a teacher
in Smith College, Massachusetts, and
another married sister in New York
City, from whom the message of his
death was sent to President Wilbur.
Born In France.
The late Stanford professor was
born in Besancon, France. He grad
uated from Harvard, and came west
to Stanford, where he taught two
years as assistant in the French de
partment. This was in 1909 and 1910.
In 1911 he went to Harvard for grad
uate work, and returned to this Uni
versity in the fall of 1911. Shortly
before leaving for Europe, Professor
Pellissier was promoted to the rank
of assistant professor. He has been
absent on leave from the Board of
Trustees. He was about thirty-five
years of age, and leaves no relatives
in the west.
With the arrival of the telegram to
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, telling
of the death of Assistant Professor
Robert E. Pcllissier in France, Stan
ford experienced the loss of a strong
member of the younger guard in the
University faculty. Both students and
faculty members will miss the per
sonality of this man, whose great
wish, as expressed in his letters to
friends, was to return and take up his
work at Stanford.
.Might Have Been Here.
Professor Pcllissier might have had
that opportunity a year ago, when he
was wounded in the shoulder so seri
ously that he could no longer pack
the knapsack of a private. Instead of
securing his release, Professor Pellis
sier took the examination for Saint
Maixent military school, passed, and
after a brief period of training
emerged a sergeant, re-entering the
French ranks, this time as an officer.
