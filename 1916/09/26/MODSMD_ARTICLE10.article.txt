# MARTIAL LAW FOR COMING RIOT
## 
### 
Palo Alto police officials, the sher
iff's office, and local military organ
izations may be called out if martial
law is declared two weeks from today,
to dispel any rioting that may occur
when seats for "Seven Keys to Bald
pate" are placed on sale at the book
store and at Weingartner's drug store,
Palo Alto.
That there will be a riot for lucky
numbers in the drawing for places,
is. comparatively speaking, a cer
tainty, if the current of public in
terest may be judged a forecast of
the number of people from all Penin
sula points who are planning to en

joy "Seven Keys."
With the realization that two weeks
from today pasteboards are to go on
sale, the Sword and Sandals cast of
14 people has buckled down in prep
aration for a solid fortnight of re
hearsals.
Sword and Sandals society is of
the opinion that it has chosen the
best fitting cast of any Stanford ven
ture of recent years. This fact,
coupled with the experience of every
"Seven Keys" player, is assurance
that the two weeks is amply suf
ficient time for Coach Mathieu to per
fect his cast.
