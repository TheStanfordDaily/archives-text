# A.D. GRIFFIN WILL CAPTAIN DISTANCE MEN
## NEED OF CANDIDATES To Take Aupperle's Place as Leader of Cross Country Runners 
### 
A. D. Griffin, '17, was elected cap
tain of the cross-country squad at a
meeting of cross-country inen called
yesterday afternoon by Track Cap
tain H. V. Aupperle, '17. This is the
first time in the history of the Uni
versity that an election for cross
country captain has been held.
.May Meet California.
Griffin aud Aupperle will meet Cap
tain Sherman of the University of
California team, Wednesday, looking
forward to the establishment of an
annual cross-country run between the
two schools. Prospects for this event
are bright, as California has already
made some overtures in that direc
tion.
Griffin is one of the best cross-coun
try men in school. He is also on the
track squad, being a distance man.
His election was made necessary by
the fact that Captain Aupperle leaves
the University Friday for an ab
sence of six weeks, to accompany
Chancellor Emeritus Jordan on a
speaking tour of the country, as his
private secretary.
Call For Candidates.
Captain Grilfin has issued a call
for more candidates for the team. At
present fifteen men are working out
on Monday, Wednesday and Friday
afternoons. For the present, these
workouts will consist of a three or
four mile run across the country. In
the event that a meet with California
is arranged, it is hoped that a larger
squad will report for practice, as the
Blue and Gold has an exceptionally
strong team. Any men wishing to try
out for the team can see Captain
Griffin at the gym on any of the three
practice nights.
