A bad bluffer always was a sort of
obnoxious person—one that talked in
terras of steam yachts and imported
valets, when his purse failed to meet
his laundry obligations. All of which
brings to mind a certain element that
dwells peacefully on the campus,
which fails to sec the storm of dis
approbation brewing about their
heads.

Two hundred and twenty-five men,
on the last day of August, scrawled
their John Hancocks upon cards at
the rugby rally, signifying their in
tention of supporting the football sea
son with their presence until the final
blast of the whistle in November. An
adding machine is not required to
count the number out for football to
day—Chinese ciphering is sufficient.
Invariably, when the roll call is con
cluded by the coach, from one-third
to one-half of the pigskin candidates
are among the wounded, missing, or
deserted —chiefly deserted.

During the fall, two years back, the
Cardinal second varsity was surnained
the Stanford All Blacks, after the
champion fifteen from across the Pa
cific, because of their unequalled dis
play of brilliancy and fighting spirit.
Today half the All Blacks fail to re
spond when their names are barked
out by the coach, while the Peanut
League, on the outside turf, is as ec
centric a quantity as mining stock.

Rugby is on the boards for this
season, no matter what change of
game the future has in store. Those
who pledged themselves members of
the 1916 football squad should be
found only in one place during hours
of football practice—it is their priv
ilege and duty. Better toss away the
white feather before forced to hang
your head in shame before an accus
ing public opinion.
