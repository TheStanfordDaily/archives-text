# Underclass Women Win Baseball Match From Juniors and Seniors
## 
### 
Yesterday afternoon the underclass
women defeated the upperclass
women in the first baseball match of
the season, by a score of 4 to 3. The
victory was closely contested through
out the game, as is shown by the fact
that, the underclassmen made their
winning run in the last half of the
last inning. New material for the
varsity nine is very promising in the
two lower classes, and this fact will
cause every place on the team to be
closely contested this year.
Arrangements are being made by
the manager for match games with
Mills College, San Jose Normal, and
Fremont high school.
