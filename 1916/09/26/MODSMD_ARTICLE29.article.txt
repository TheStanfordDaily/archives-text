# ASKS RECRUITS FOR AMBULANCE WORK IN FRANCE
## 
### 
Chas. J. Freeborn, section director
of the American Ambulance Service
in France, was on the campus yester
day, arranging for recruits for the
French service. Mr. Freeborn, who
is a Yale graduate, was the man who
started this service in Paris, and has
driven an ambulance since the war
began. He has been given a com
mission by the French government to
obtain recruits to double the number
of Americans in France at present.
Mr. Freeborn told some interesting
facts regarding the men who are
there. With few exceptions, they are
college students. All the large col
leges with the exception of Stanford
are represented, so he is making a
special effort here. The pictures
which were shown in the Assembly
Hall last night are of actual war
conditions in France, shown for the
purpose of acquainting recruits with
conditions in Europe.
Mr. Freeborn, besides recruiting for
men, is seeking money with which to
buy ambulances, and for this reason
has been conducting meetings among
the wealthy people of the United
States. Several Stanford students are
considering going over as ambulance
drivers, and at least one has made
formal application for his passports.
