# Queen or Pay ... .. Five Dollars .. ... Say the D.U.'s

### 
Malcolm Tedford, '17, house man
ager of the Delta Upsilon house, is
not able to manage his own house
hold. It's better to have tried to
queen than never to have queened at
all. Such used to be his sentiments,
hut they've changed. He's off queen
ing.
It came about in this way.
Sunday night, Tedford thought he
had a date; he knew he had a date—
he'd just called her up. So he bet
five dollars on his knowledge and
with the whole D. U.house lined up in
front of Madrona, confidently rang
the doorbell. He was informed that
the lady of his choice had departed.
On a dollar —generously deducted
from the bet by those in the D. U.
bonds —he took "her" room-mate to
look over the movies in search of the
lady he had expected to queen.
The story goes that he drew a seat
next to "her," and who should be
queening "her" but a freshman from
his own house.
