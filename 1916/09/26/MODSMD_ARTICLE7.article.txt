# MIDWEEK CARD WILL PLEASE BLEACHERITES
## FINAL YELL TRYOUTS Palo Alto High Vs. Freshmen Should Result in Fast Rugby Tangle 
### 
Midweek football of a high class
variety will be displayed to the rugby
fans tomorrow afternoon, when the
Stanford freshmen line up against the
fifteen representing Palo Alto high
school. This will be the second
of a series of three on the
schedule. In the first tangle the
freshmen carried off the honors in a
hard contest, the final score reading
24 to 5. The high school team was
not in the best condition and the first
year contingent ran up a higher score
than is usual when these two squads
meet.
Lust Tryout For Yell Leaders.
Yell Leader Gilroy is especially
anxious that the bleachers be well
filled as the yell tryouts for the two
assistants will be concluded Wednes
day. SeasoUi tickets can be used,
those without the cards being required
to pay the usual twenty-five cents ad
mission fee. The game will be called
promptly at 4:30, "Ric" Templeton
handling the whistle.
Coach Brown will probably shake
lip the "Baby" lineup after the defeat
of last Saturday, but so far he has
not announced the freshmen fifteen
for tomorrow's contest. The Berkeley
team was a strong one and the fresh
men played good football, but a few
changes in the personnel of the fifteen
will undoubtedly help matters. I'alo
Alto has a light team this year, but
the backfield is fast and many vet
erans are back in suits. The com
bination of Nagel, G. Green, C. Green
and Shone is a speedy one, and the
bleacher warmers can expect some
fast football.
