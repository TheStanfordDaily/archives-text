# MIDWEEK CARD WILL PLEASE BLEACHERITES
## FINAL YELL TRYOUTS Palo Alto High Vs. Freshmen Should Result in Fast Rugby Tangle 
### 
Midweek football of a high class
variety will be displayed to the rugby
fans tomorrow afternoon, when the
Stanford freshmen line up against the
fifteen representing Palo Alto high
school. This will be the second
of a series of three on the
schedule. In the first tangle the
freshmen carried off the honors in a
hard contest, the final score reading
24 to 5. The high school team was
not in the best condition and the first
year contingent ran up a higher score
than is usual when these two squads
meet.
Lust Tryout For Yell Leaders.
Yell Leader Gilroy is especially
anxious that the bleachers be well
filled as the yell tryouts for the two
assistants will be concluded Wednes
day. SeasoUi tickets can be used,
those without the cards being required
to pay the usual twenty-five cents ad
mission fee. The game will be called
promptly at 4:30, "Ric" Templeton
