## 
### 
Four companies, each composed of
six squads, have been formed by the
military training enthusiasts under
the direction of Major J. Bugge, and E.
H. Jewell, sergeant of instruction.
Last night two hundred and nine men
were out for the class. Of this num
ber thirteen were new men. By this
time, a good working basis has been
established, as far as the number of
men out for the work is concerned.
A number of those who signed up
for the course at the first of the se
mester, have definitely dropped out,
but additional men are entering the
ranks every afternoon.

This afternoon the time was taken
up with the fundamentals of squad
movements. Drill yesterday consisted
in instruction in the following com
mands: Form squad, count off, guide,
right and left oblique, in place halt,
i resume march.
Company For Athletes.
A company of football men will be
formed in a few days, according to
Major Bugge, who is trying to find a
time convenient for all men out for
football who wish to take the drill
work.
In older to clear up misunder-
standing in regard to the amount of
University credit given for the mili
tary, the following information is is
sued officially by Major Bugge.
Credit is given on the basis of one
unit for three hours of drill.
At present drill is held two hours
every day to make up for time lost at
the beginning of the term. Later it
is probable that a tworhour period
will be held three afternoons a week,
with make-up periods on Saturday.
Although most of the men will take
the six hours of work for two aca
demic units, those who wish can take
three hours a week for one unit.
At the end of this week the roll
of class will be sent in to the Regis
trar's office. Individual petitions need
only be made by men who would be
taking more hours than they would
regularly be permitted to if they take
the military training, and by men
who wish to drop other courses in
order to take military training.
