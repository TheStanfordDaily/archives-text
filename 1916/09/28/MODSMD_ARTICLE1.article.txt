# BELGIANS ARE BRAVEST OF ALL PEOPLE
## CHILDREN WELL FED Stanford Psychologist Narrates Belgium's Condition From Inside View 
### 
Stanford, two thousand strong,
under the leadership of Dr. Frank
Angell, evaded the British blockade,
and the German iron ring, and visited
Belgium from the interior this morn
ing. Not a few hitherto unexplored
nooks in Belgium relief were opened
wide as day. At the conclusion of
Dr. Angell's address not a soul in the
assembly hall breathed who did not
agree with him in his sentiments,
"that of Caius Julius Caesar, tho
bravest are the Belgians."
I>r. Angell a Neutral.
Dr. Angell began has narrative with
his arrival in Belgium, following a
conference with Herbert C. Hoover
in London. Dr. Angell arrived in
Belgium, a neutral, "wearing an
English overcoat, Belgian shoes, and
speaking French with a German ac
cent."
According to Dr. Angell, the Amer
icans are devoting their time to se
curing food, while the Belgians arc
distributing it. His work in Belgium,
Dr. Angell described as "standing a
Belgian up and poking questions at
him to find out how things were being
managed. " This work gave Dr. An
gell a clearer insight into the real
conditions of the Belgians probably
than any other American has ever
had, since few foreigners are allowed
on German soil.
"When I found out what I was to
do 1 felt as a chip on an ocean of
relief," said Dr. Angell, who was
amazed at the immensity of the
work. "The ashes were not cold after
the first German invasion before
towns began to devise means of
relief. All means of commun
ication were stopped, and no
man might go from one town to
to devise means of relief. All means
of communication were stopped, and
no man might go from one town to
another to get provisions. Classes of
people made themselves into societies
to help. Since they were working
against each other a national com
mittee took charge to divide work.
The biggest men and women of
Europe are in charge of work.
Three Needy Classes.
"Three great classes needed help,
the unemployed, the unsupported,
whose breadwinners had been killed,
and those dependent before the war,
who were rendered doubly so by the
war. Every household had to go
through an investigation to show that
the income was not over eighty cents
per week, or had 110 dogs, wayward
daughters, or members who attended
archery meetings or owned a carbaret
show. A large dog eats as much as a
man, and betting on archery and car
rier pigeons "is a national vice.
Sixty Cents a Week Support.
"An unemployed man gets sixty
cents, his housekeeper thirty cents,
and his children ten cents per week
lor support. The commune has to
give the rest, necessary for support.
"There has never been anything in
the world so complicated as the Bel
gian relief work. No other country
that the sun shines upon couid have
ever done it. The Belgians are so
well educated, the communes so in
dependent, and the population so
stable that relief is possible for mil
lions. Every Belgian wants to get
back to bis home at night or over the
week end, and government railroads
have made this possible through one
tenth of a cent per mile travel.
"The Belgians are the kindest, most
charitable, and most sincere people
I have seen," concluded Dr. Angell.
"1 have watched them in every way.
Their leaders are trying to keep their
people sound in mind in spite of relief
â€”not charity, for Belgians will not
accept help as charity. They are
happy, joyous, and kind, in spite of
their condition."
