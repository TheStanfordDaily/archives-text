# BALLOT FIGHT SECONDED BY ATTORNEY FOR STATE
## CLIMAX IS REACHED IN DISPUTE Opinion Favoring Student Right Throws Burden of Proof Upon County Clerk 
### H. S. Marshutz, '17 
New and vital evidence in the dis
pute between the students of Stan
ford University and the County Clerk
of Santa Clara county, brought forth
today in the form of a documentary
communication from Attorney-Gen
eral Webb to President Wilbur, chalks
up a point in the favor of the Stan
ford student body, and brings the
light to a climax by creating a ten
sion that will only be relieved when
the county clerk decides that he will
or will not alter his views and fol
low those of the state's attorney.
Must Convince County.
According to Deputy County Clerk
O'Neil, today, the opinion of the at
torney-general is only an opinion, and
if it does not convince the county
clerk that he is wrong, will not sup
ersede the policy of student registra
tion that has been enforced for ten
years here.
Raymond Benjamin, in his letter to
Dr. Wilbur, clearly indicates that the
state's opinion is quite at outs with
that of the local authorities.
The County Argument.
The county clerk avers that a stu
dent cannot declare the University his
residence, because: I—He has an
other place that lie designates as
home, and to which he repairs during
vacation; 2 —That the University is es-
seutially a temporary stopping place;
3—That what facts the average stu
dent can bring to bear out his declara
tion of residence at Stanford are not
sufficient.
The State Opinion.
On thp other hand, the attorney
general contends: I—That1 —That at all
times it is a student's privilege to
lose an established residence and to
gain a new one if he desires; 2—
That the offer of a student to register
is evidence of his abandonment of
former residence; 3 —That the mere
fact that a student is assisted by his
parents or that he returns to his for
mer residence during vacations, is
not of controlling importance.
Draws Fine Distinction.
Analysis of Mr. Benjamin's report
discloses that he has not ignored the
question of the right of the student
to establish residence. The state
makes clear that not every student
possesses all the necessary qualifica
tions. The only distinction drawn is
between two classes of students: 1 —
Those who intend to re-adopt their
former residence upon completion of
their college career; 2—Those who
do not know definitely that they in
tend to resume their former resi
dence.
In the first mentioned class above,
according to Mr. Benjamin, a failure
to abandon the former residence is
indicated. As to the second class of
students, to quote from Mr. Ben
jamin's summary:
To sum up the situation, there
fore, with respect to Stanford,
or any other university or insti
tution of learning, it may be said,
that having gained the age of 21
years and possessing all requi
site qualifications of an elector,
that it is within the power and
the right of such students to es
tablish for themselves a resi
dence at the university, or in its
immediate vicinity, while they are
attending the university; that such
intention upon their part must be
affirmative and accompanied by
acts evidencing a bona fide resi
dence; that it is not essential to
the establishment of such a resi
dence that they have an inten
tion to remain at the university
or in its vicinity after having
completed their course of study;
that in so establishing their resi
dence at or near Stanford Uni
versity it must be with the intent
to make that place their perm
anent residence at least during
the time that they are attending
the university, and that when so
doing they have no present in
tention of returning to the for
mer residence for the purpose of
making such former residence
their actual residence after they
have completed their course of
study.
What Is Permanent Abode?
This opinion, as all others in the
communication, is seconded by, and
in fact, is based upon court decisions,
rather than upon the Political Code
or the State Constitution, upon which
the County Clerk leans.
Thus the case appertaining to stu
dents of Wesleyan University (Berry
v. Wilcox) is quoted by the Supreme
Court of Illinois (Dale v. Wilcox) as
follows:
What is a permanent abode?
Must it be held to be an abode
which the party does not intend
to abandon at any future time?
This, it seems to us, would be a
definition too stringent for a
country whose people and char
acteristics are ever on the change.
No man in active life in this state
can say, wherever he may be
placed, this is and ever shall be
my permanent abode. It would be
safe to say a permanent abode,
in the sense of the statute, means
nothing more than a domicile, a
home, which the party is at lib
erty to leave, as interest or whim
dictate, but without any present
intention to change it.
California law (the supreme court
decision in the case of Stewart v.
Kaiser) is cited by Mr. Benjamin as
an example of an identical dispute
arising at Napa College, where an
unsuccessful candidate challenged the
election because students voted. To
quote Mr. Benjamin: "Apparently,
the right of such students to vote
in the precinct where the college
was located, was so clearly estab
lished that in deciding the case the
judgment was affirmed without a dis
cussion of that point."
The county clerk's end has been
upheld by the county clerk's deputy,
Mr. O'Neil. County Clerk Pfister is
expected to return from vacation,
Monday. He will then be shown Mr.
Benjamin's opinion, which revelation
will compel Mr. Pfister either to ac
cord Stanford students the privilege
of registration, or to contend that the
opinion of the State has not been
convincing.
