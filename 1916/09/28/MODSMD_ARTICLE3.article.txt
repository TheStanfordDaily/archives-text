# ROBLE GYM TO BE MOVED SAYS DOCTOR WILBUR
## 
### 
President Wilbur sprang a surprise
at the Women's athletic rally last
night by announcing plans to have
the old Roble gymnasium building
moved over by the new pool. In
urging all women to take advantage
of their opportunities for physical ex
ercise, he continued: "Girls are more
conscientious than men, and often
graduate with well-developed brains
and nothing else. They neglect their
bodies, and without any physique they
can never be a success."
Sport for Sport's Sake.
Dr. Frank Angell, once more at the
head of Stanford athletics, joined
President Wilbur in a plea for the
participation of all in sports. "We de
veloped these grounds in order that
there might be a secluded spot where
Stanford women could enjoy them
selves. Our ideal is to have all
women come out, not for credit or
honor, but for the sake of the sport."
"Excel in one sport, but take part
in all of them," was the policy urged
by Mr. H. W. Maloney, fencing coach
for the women.
Comparative Merits Outlined.
The value of participation in sports
from the social point of view was
emphasized by Miss Harriet Brad
ford, Doan of Women. Leaders in the
various sports proclaimed the com
parative merits of each, Miss Dorothy
Metz, '17, for fencing and baseball,
and Miss Ruth Sampson, '15, for boat
ing and basketball. Miss Greta .Jo
hannson, instructor in the newest
sport for Stanford women, declared
swimming to be an art superior to
all others. Yells, led by J. Campbell,
'18, V. Pilcher, '18, and G. Cluff, '18,
followed each speech.
