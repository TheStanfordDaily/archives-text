## 
### 
"Engineers should broaden their
outlook and widen their interests in
order to gain the recognition that
they are entitled to have," said Dr.
J. A. L. Waddell, yesterday afternoon,
in a lecture before the assembled
Stanford engineering students upon
the "Profession of Engineering." "Be
cause an engineer deals with cold
facts all the time, he has a different
position from a doctor or a lawyer,
who is constantly gaining a broader
view."
In speaking of the proper educa
tion for an engineer as a remedy
for this condition, Dr. Waddell said:
"Engineering students should pay at
tention to English and cultural sub
jects, as well as learning to speak
well in public. Spanish is .the mod
ern language which is most practical
for the engineer, and he slionld have
more adequate instruction in it. As
soon as the war is over in Mexico,
there will be a big demand for en
gineers there, as well as in South
America."
Dr. Waddell, who is one of the best
known bridge builders and structural
engineers in the country, stopped in
San Francisco yesterday and today,
and it was there that Professor Wing
was able to secure him. He was
formerly an instructor in the Im
perial University of Tokio, Japan, and
lias written several of the best known
text books on bridge building.
