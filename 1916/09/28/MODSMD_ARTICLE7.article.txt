# Freshmen Win 14-3 in Ragged Football
## Paly Fifteen Shown Superior to 1920 in All But Weight and Endurance 
### 
Playing a brand of football that was
listless, ragged, and everything else
that it should not be, the freshmen
rugby team managed to nose a win
over the Palo Alto high school fifteen
yesterday afternoon. The score was
14 to 3, but this does not do the game
justice, for the high school squad was
the better of the two teams through
out, the superior weight and natural
endurance of the older men being the
deciding factor.
"lJ>2<r Going Back.
From a team that showed prospects
of developing into one of the Card
inal's best, baby squads, the fifteen
representing the class of 1!)20 has
gone back until their playing is hard
ly on the same standard of the aver
age preparatory school aggregation.
The backfield is ragged, showing signs
of class at times, but being very weak
on defense, while the forwards seem
tired before the play has gone five
minutes.
'Tally'' Leads First Half.
"Ric" Templeton, who refereed the
contest yesterday, blew the starting
whistle at 4:30. The bleachers were
well filled, as the game marked the
final tryouts for the two assistants
for Yell Leader Gilroy. For the first
ten minutes of play, the freshmen
contingent was driven off its feet, and
it is surprising that "Pally'' did not
make more than the one score which
was made by Clark, who went across
after a ten-yard run. This half was
featured by excellent passing rushes
on the part of the opponents' back
field, good kicking by the whole Palo
Alto team, and a splendid attempt at
a drop kick for the goal by Angell
of the freshmen. The half ended with
Palo Alto leading 3 to 0.
Brown Shifts Lineup.
In the second period, Coach Floyd
Drown made several changes in the
1920 lineuu, which seemed to put a
little life in the squad. Needham,
Barneson, Larkin and Joerg scored
during the half, one of the trys being
converted by Needham. The try by
Joerg was made after the final
whistle, and after a run of forty
yards.
"Pep" Is Minns Quantity.
Judging from the last three fresh
men games, the Santa Clara delega
tion will be hard to beat, unless the
first year lineup receives a big shake
up or gets a little enthusiasm into the
play.
The lineups follow:
Freshmen —Wayland, Barneson and
Henry, front rank; Martin, Bowden,
(Millington), middle rank; Meyers,
(Toole), Til ton and Gardner, rear
rank; Larkin, half; Davis and Joerg,
five-eighths; Angell, center-three;
Rogers, (Needham), and Strong,
wings; Strain, full.
Palo Alto —Owen and Holston, front
rank; Ilawley, Collier and Clark,
middle rank; Meyers and Snell, rear
rank; Patrick, wing forward; Brown,
half; Nagel and Green, five-eighths;
Shone, center-three; Kline and Scho
field, wings; Stanton, full.
