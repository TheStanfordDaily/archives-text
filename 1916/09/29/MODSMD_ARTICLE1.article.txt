# FIVE CONTESTS ON FOOTBALL CARD TOMORROW
## VARSITY MEETS CLUB College of Pacific Scheduled to Tangle With Speedy All Blacks 
### 
Stanford rugby hostilities will open
tomorrow afternoon with the fresh
men taking on the fast Fremont High
fifteen as a curtain-raiser at 1:30, fol
lowed by the feature contest, the Var
sity vs" F'alo Alto Athletic Club boys
at 3 o'clock, and concluded as per
custom by the second varsity, who
will meet the College of Pacific team.
In addition to these games in the af
ternoon, there will be two games
in the morning for the boys of the
outside squads, the third varsity op
posing Alameda High, and a picked
Peanut squad taking on the Manzan
ita boys of Palo Alto.
Athletic ( Inl) Strong.
Followers of the rugby sport an
ticipate a thriller when the Varsity
stacks up against the Palo Alto Club
boys of "Mush" Stevens, and judging
from the count against the second
varsity two weeks ago, the Varsity
will have a hard battle on their
hands. Stevens has made practically
no changes in his lineup, and will
lead out the same squad.
Coach Floyd Brown has made a
few conservative shifts, Johnson and
Chandler being listed as breakaways,
while Captain Braden is out of the
game on account of. injuries. In the
backfield, Long as sub-half, is a
slight innovation, while Wark as sub
first-five, is another. The rest of the
backfield remains essentially the
same, with Lachmund at second-five,
Carroll at center, Swigart and Wark
on the wings, and Templeton at full.
11>20 vs. Fremont.
Freshmen vs. Fremont will make up
an interesting opener. The freshmen
have been going none too well in
their appearances, but have undergone
two strenuous nights of practice, and
Coach Brown expects to see a marked
improvement in their work tomorrow.
Larkin will again handle the half
position, while Davis will appear at
first-five, with .Joerg at second.
"Snowball" Angell will hold down
three-quarters, with Needham and
Strong on the wings. This combina
tion should prove effective.
Concluding the day's performance,
the Second Varsity-College of Pacific
game should be very close. The C. P.
lads have a good turnout for rugby
every night.
Pete Flanigan, von Monderschied,
and .loe Urban will referee the games
and this assures snap to the strug
gles.
Admittance tomorrow will be sea
son tickets, or r>o cents to those not
possessing the necessary pasteboards.
Season tickets may be procured at
the gate.
