# A
						BIRTHDAY GRIN
## There come 
### 
turnstile epochs in the un
broken lives of a fortunate
handful, when events of
such startling and gigantic

significance blast forth that one's
very breath chokes and one's heart is
lost in the palate, like a swimmer
taken aghast plunging into icy waters.
Stanford University, its faculty,
alumni and undergraduates, must ex
perience that same thrill today upon
becoming cognizant of the mighty
steps of progress just accomplished
by the Board of Trustees and the
President.

It seems an unfathomable coinci
dence that the appropriations and
legislation enacted a few hours ago
should occur simultaneously with the
celebration of Stanford's Quarter Cen
tennial. Verily a golden age shines
forth since twenty-five years ago
David Starr Jordan, then a young
man, presented his inaugural ad
dress before the pioneers of this LTni
versity.

Attorney Frank Deering, who hero
after assumes the duties borne by
the late splendid figure, Horace
Davis, may now be welcomed as a
Stanford man as well as a Blue and
Gold alumnus. The charming predic
ament of having one of the enemy's
camp whip the executive reins is a
novel but admirable innovation.
Binds of semi-interlocking director
ates should aid in forming happy re
lations between the two sister uni
versities.
********
Nothing could have taken the cam
pus more by pleasant surprise than
the announced project of transform
ing Roble Hall into a men's dormi
tory, with the surrounding grounds
generously donated for athletic util
ization. Senator and Mrs. Stanford's
spring dream of the Big Family is
near realization. Henceforth it will
be unnecessary for one-third of the
male population of Stanford to be
hermited in Palo Alto or neighboring
municipalities. Stanford democracy
becomes a fact rather than an empty
name.

Authorization of a University press
building, with equipment for local
publications sounds taps for the ex
isting starved rations of campus
periodicals, with an era of rare
promise looming in the future. By
the installation of a naval base at
Lane Hospital, the camping ground
of the Medical School, Stanford again
demonstrates her vanguard position
among educational institutions of the
country.
********
Numerous other innovations were
included in the minutes of a
meeting that will forever go on rec
ord as shooting the value of Stanford
stock sky-high. Hence we take a
glad hitch in our belt and smile. A
quarter of a century ago the wheels
of education were started —slowly—
and now one hears whirring and
whirling that denotes capacity speed
and efficiency under night and day
shifts.
