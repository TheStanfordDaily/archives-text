# Hash Minus "Cabaret" Is Order of Roble Women
## 
### 
The fate of the hasher is hard. He
is born unto trouble, even as the
sparks fly upward.
A calamity lias come to pass. There
will be no more queening in the Roble
dining room. No more irrevelant
words must pass between the humble
waiter and the fair waits.
This was the edict given out last
night, after a home meeting of Roble
girls. On the Qrad or in the par
lor, they speak to him, if they like,
just as if he were an ordinary human
being. As a hasher, in his official
capacity, lie is not to be recognized,
say. tiie Roble girls. In the mean
time, the chastened and subdued
hashers hash humbly on.
