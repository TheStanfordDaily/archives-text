# Must Pay Student Body Dues to Swim
## Conference Decides Question After Investigation by Committee 
### 
That persons who have not paid
their student body dues arc not en
titled to the use of the swimming
pool was the decision of the Men's
Conference last night, after hearing
the report of the special committee
which was detailed to investigate the
authority of the Executive Committee
in regard to the plunge. Though the
plunge is built adjacent to Encina
gymnasium, unlike the gymnasium, it
is (he property of the Associated Stu
dents, and is open only to those who
hold student body membership.
After hearing the result of the in
vestigation. the Conference passed a
resolution to the effect that all Con
ference members make it their duty
to report to the Student Council all
eases of use of the plunge by per
sons who are not members of the stu
dent body.
Investigation into the cause of the
delay in getting hot water for the En
cina showers was ordered. It is the
aim of the Conference to learn why
hot water has not been furnished and
to see that it is provided at the ear
liest possible date.
The suggestion that all members of
the Conference attend the Faculty
Club reception on the evening of Oc
tober 6 was unanimously approved.
