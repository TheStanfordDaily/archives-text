# ANNIVERSARY TO BE OBSERVED IN CHAPEL
## PUT OFF CELEBRATION Quarter Century Has Elapsed Since University Was Opened 
### 
Simple exercises in the Memorial
Church, Sunday, October Ist, will
mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of
the opening of Stanford University.
According to Professor G. J. Peirce
of the Public Exercises Committee,
of the faculty, the big celebration of
the anniversary will be combined with
that of Founders' Day, March 9, in
stead of having any special demon- j
stration of the students Sunday, as
both Dr. Jordan and Dr. Wilbur will
be away on lecture tours, on that
day.
Rev. I). Charles Gardner, chaplain,
has prepared a special sermon for
tlio services in the Memorial Church,
which will commemorate the event.
Special music will be combined with
the anniversary services, and every
thing possible will be (lone to make
the occasion one to be remembered.
I'lan For March !>.
Professor Peirce is working on a
plan whereby the play "Admetus,"
written by Irving Outcault, will be
produced at the celebration of Found
ers' Day on March 9. Outcault is a
Stanford alumnus, of the same class
in which Dr. Wilbur graduated, and
his production, which has proven
very successful in San Diego, would
be appropriate to the occasion.
The play itself is a beautiful and
imaginative interpretation of the
Grecian myth. It could be produced
on an out-door stage, such as was
used at the exposition in San Diego,
and either the Museum or Quad
buildings would be an ideal back
ground for the simple stage settings.
