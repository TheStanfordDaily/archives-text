Nineteen sophomores ceased to be
students today and became instead
men and women of stageland, when
Coach Frank Mathieu of San Fran
cisco made public the players of the
1919 class who will appear in "The
Show Shop," to be presented here
November 3.
Of the chosen 19, five have been
seen in Stanford dramatic produc
tions. The other 14 have had yet to
make their debut on a Stanford stage.

From now on, the people of Mathieu's
selection will live in slageland, for
"The Show Shop" is every bit what
its name implies—a story of the
stage.
The naming of Richard Derby
brings to memory his playing of the
Dutchman in"In Dutch," last spring.
Derby will be seen in November as
Jerome Relden, the man-about-town
hero of "The Show Shop," who.
against his will, is forced to become
a limelight hero.
To R. R. Tourtillott falls the role
of Max Rosenbaum, an essentially
modern theatrical manager. Tour
tillott will have opportunity to display
his powers in the character who off
the stage or on is worth many a
laugh.
Another Junior Opera echo is the
naming of D. M. Smith for the happy
role of Wilbur Tompkins. Smith
played himself into the hearts of his
audience in a comedy part of "In
Dutch."
W. W. Lloyd and M. L. Levy have
been chosen for the roles of Johnny
Brinkley and Granby Smith. Good
win Knight, who appeared last Jan
uary in one of the Masquers' one-act
plays, will act the part of Goldman
in"The Show Shop." Roland Wheal
ton, who held a lead in"In Dutch,"
has been named to act Mr. Billings.
A first rehearsal of "The Show
Shop" is set for Monday.

From now on, the people of Mathieu's
selection will live in slageland, for
"The Show Shop" is every bit what
its name implies—a story of the
stage.
The naming of Richard Derby
brings to memory his playing of the
Dutchman in"In Dutch," last spring.
Derby will be seen in November as
Jerome Relden, the man-about-town
hero of "The Show Shop," who.
against his will, is forced to become
a limelight hero.
To R. R. Tourtillott falls the role
of Max Rosenbaum, an essentially
modern theatrical manager. Tour
tillott will have opportunity to display
his powers in the character who off
the stage or on is worth many a
laugh.
Another Junior Opera echo is the
naming of D. M. Smith for the happy
role of Wilbur Tompkins. Smith
played himself into the hearts of his
audience in a comedy part of "In
Dutch."
W. W. Lloyd and M. L. Levy have
been chosen for the roles of Johnny
Brinkley and Granby Smith. Good
win Knight, who appeared last Jan
uary in one of the Masquers' one-act
plays, will act the part of Goldman
in"The Show Shop." Roland Wheal
ton, who held a lead in"In Dutch,"
has been named to act Mr. Billings.
A first rehearsal of "The Show
Shop" is set for Monday.

1919 class who will appear in "The
Show Shop," to be presented here
November 3.
Of the chosen 19, five have been
seen in Stanford dramatic produc
tions. The other 14 have had yet to
make their debut on a Stanford stage.
