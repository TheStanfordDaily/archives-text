FRANK P. DEERING NEW
STANFORD TRUSTEE
A California graduate is the new
trustee. Frank I'. Deering, a life-long
friend of Horace Davis, is a San Fran
cisco attorney. He was born in
Tuolonie county, and has lived in
California all liis life. Trustee Deer
ing is the author of the first anno
tated code of California laws, which,
according to Dean Huston of the law
department, "is enough work for any
lawyer."
Deering. who is a member of Chit-
Chat Club, Bohemian Club, The
Pacific Union Club, and the Unitarian
Club, all of San Francisco, is attorney
for the Davis estate. He is appointed
for ten years, whereas his predeces-
Ssor held the office for life,
j When reminded of the unusual situ
•ation he held as a California graduate
on the Stanford Hoard of Trustees,
Deering retorted, "All education is
one. Stanford and California are riv
als intellectually and athletically, but
I take up this task as a public service
for education."
ROBLE HALL TO BECOME
MEN'S DORMITORY
The plan to make Roble Hall a
men's dormitory is one of President
Wilbur's favorite schemes. Approval
of the plans by the Hoard of Trustees
means authority to erect four or five
houses on the Row in which to house
the one hundred and twenty women
of Roble in small groups.
George W. Kelhan, the architect
of the Palace Hotel, will be asked to
come to the campus, look over sites,
and suggest the best possible houses
for the members of Roble Club. As
yet no type has been agreed upon.
Grounds near Roble will be en
larged for athletic purposes and
turned over to the men. Roble gym
will be moved from the vicinity of
Rable Hall, and newer equipment will
he put up for the feminine athletes.
FORMULATING PLANS FOR
I PRESS BUILDING
Plans for the press and press build
ing, which will house editorial and
business departments of all campus
publications, have not been com
pleted. It is thought that the local
University Press, owned and operated
by J. A. Quelle, will be taken over
and moved into new quarters sofne
time next summer, to be ready for dse
by the opening of the fall semester.
