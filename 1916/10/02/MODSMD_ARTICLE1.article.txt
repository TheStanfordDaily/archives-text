# CARDINALS MAKE CLEAN SWEEP IN RUGBY
## PLAY GOOD FOOTBALL Palo Alto Athletic Club Springs Surprise for Fans With a Show of Strength 
### 
Displaying the best rugby of the
present season, four Cardinal foot
ball teams made a clean sweep of
Saturday's pigskin calendar. The
Peanut Leaguers started the day with
a 25 to 0 win over Manzanita high
school, the game being played at 10
o'clock with the weather conditions
none too favorable. In the after
noon's curtain-raiser, the freshmen
camp to life and played with increased
energy and fight, beating the huskies
of Fremont high school by a 24 to
5 score. The varsity tangle went to
the Cardinals as did the game be
tween the second varsity and the Col
lege of Pacific. The varsity had the
fast Palo Alto Athletic Club as its
opponents and managed to squeeze a
13 to 8 victory out of the contest,
while the second varsity ran the
count up to 24, the visiting team not
being able to score a try.
Freshmen Display Speed.
From the first game to the last the
enthusiasts were treated to excellent
football. Although the day was cloudy
and dismal, the teams had fight from
the first whistle and brought the small
crowd to its feet with long attempts at
field goals, drop kicks on penalties
awarded by the referee, spirited pass
ing rushes, and speedy play in the
forwards at all times. In the fresh
man game, the backfield repeatedly
startled with long rushes, the ball
traveling from Larkin to Risling to
Joerg to Angel 1 to Needham or to
Strong in lightning fashion. Six trys
were made by the freshmen, two by
Risling, and one apiece by Needham,
Larkein, Joerg and Gardner. Need
ham converted three of the scores.
Hanson went across for the visitors,
the try being converted by Brooks.
Although the Athletic Club had a
strong lineup, many believed that the
varsity, with their superior condition,
would run up a big score, at least in
the second period. This was not the
case, as the clubmen had the varsity
on defense during a great part of the
hour's rugby, and as the final whistle
blew were in the Cardinal's terri
tory. One of the fame's many fea
aures was a kicking duel between the
Templeton brothers, "Itic" and "Dink."
If a choice could be made in kicking
ability as displayed Saturday, it
would have to be given to the former
Stanford star, "Ilic," for his conver
sion of "Pally's" first score seemed
uncanny.
Lachmund Scores First.
Following a kicking duel between
the oppoing fullbacks, the ball was
served to the Stanford scrum men,
who advanced it into dangerous
ground. A rush with the pigskin
traveling from Murray to Braden to
Henry to Coleman to Lachmund ended
in the first score. The attempt at
converting failed. After a fumble of
a cross-kick, Davidson scooped the
ball, and when stopped transferred it
to Gladstone, who passed to Greev<.
the latter going over. Templeton sent
the ball between the posts from a dif
ficult angle. Dropouts from the
twenty-five yard line saved the club
men twice in the next few minutes,
for the varsity were playing as the
fifteen had not played before this sea
son. The backfleld were continually
advancing the sphere while the for
wards were in the game at all times.
From a one-yard scrum called by Ref
eree Von Monderschied, Coleman went
over for the locals' second try.
"Dink" Templeton converted.
Casliel Stars for "Pally."
In the second half Lachmund tallied
for Stanford while Cashel scored for
the Athletic Club, after a forty-yard
run. Both markers were converted
bringing the score to its final count
