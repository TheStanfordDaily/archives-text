# FRESHMEN DECIDE FATE OF HONOR SYSTEM
## ATTITUDE IS PIVOTAL Student Advisor and Conference to Explain Government to First Year Men 
### 
That the eventual establishment of
a universial honor system in all de
partments of the University depends
in a great part upon the attitude
which freshmen and new students are
taught to take toward class room
honesty is the belief of the Men's
Conference, and for the purpose of in
forming freshmen of tlie inside work
ings of student government a meeting
of all men of the first year class has
been called for Thursday morning.
Conference Men To Speak.
At that time Student Adviser Paul
Staniford, J. W. Templeton, '17, presi
dent of the Men's Conference, and W.
R. Wheatly, '17, secretary of the Con
ference, will speak to the first year
men in an attempt to give them a
proper insight into the intentions of
the honor system. It is the belief of
Staniford and members of the Confer
ence that the only cause of failure of
the honor system is the attitude of
the students toward it. If this fresh
men class and succeeding classes are
converted in their attitude toward hon
esty in the classroom, the honor sys
tem, it is believed, will in time be
come a success.
Proper Campus Conduct.
In addition to detailed information
about the workings of the honor sys
tem the freshmen will be given infor
mation as to what is expected of
them in ro -ard to general â€¢ campus
conduct.
Those who have had student affairs
in charge have found in the past that
much of the improper conduct of un
dergraduates, and of underclassmen
in particular, has been due to misin
formation. That every member of
the present freshman class may not
suffer in this rfcspect, the Conference
members will explain just what may
and what may not be done in campus
life. In the hope of getting the fresh
men lined up on the right side before
their views had been polluted, the
meeting Vas planned for as early in
the semester as possible.
At present, the Law department is
the only one in which the honor sys
tem is in full force. In other depart
ments the system has not been given
full sway because of the lack of re
spect in which it is held by the in
coming students. It is generally be
lieved that the only thing in the way
of a universally successful honor sys
tem is the awakening of an underclass
conscience.
The meeting will be held in the
Little Theater at 11 o'clock, on Thurs
day. All fraternities and clubs are
urged to see to it that all their first
year members are present at the gath
ering.
