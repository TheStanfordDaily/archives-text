Greek historians have handed down
to later generations failles of Demos
thenes, picturing the famous Athenian
orator acquiring his inimitable elo
quence through constant practice
alone on the beach with pebbles in
his mouth, —in an effort to remove a
defect in speech. In that age, and
centuries following, the art of debate
occupied a front rank position in the
toll of personal attainments. Al
though as a vocation, its popularity
has gradually waned, yet oratorical
skill still retains lasting and immeas
urable utility.

Campus opinion, with few excep
tions, on account of an unexplainable,
or rather, inexcusable prejudice, takes
advantage of every opportunity for
belittling and disparaging debating as
a University activity. In fact there
appears to exist no field so fertile for
sarcastic comment. Forensic art is
scathingly placed in the same category
with knitting and domestic science.
When all has been said and done,
such an attitude seems characteristic
of the atmosphere pervading the vil
lage grocery store, where little men
harangue on big topics with phrases
of ignorance.
*«****♦»
Common mortals, ingrained with
what is popularly termed horse
sense, recognize the untold advant
ages derived from debating. An in
telligent, audience realizes the inval
uable educational features afforded,
since nowhere are both sides if live
wire issues presented simultaneously
with such certainty and understand
ing. Although other universities place
oratory on a lofty plane as an activ
ity, yet tlu> Stanford public shows an
evidence of approval hardly equal to
the display of affection for syllabus
fees.

Added interest displayed by the
women in forensic attainments insures
debating, if allowed an inch of rope,
an assumption of its proper standing.
Surely there is no valid reason why
campus opinion should not join the
parade, by transforming unworthy
criticism into deserving appreciation.
