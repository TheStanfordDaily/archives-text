Till NEW CONFERENCE RULING.
Editoi The Daily Palo Alto:
There has been a good deal of ex
travagant comment on the recent Con
ference ruling concerning late leave,
and as a Conference member, I should
like to throw a little light on a sub
ject which has been very much mis
represented. This is not to be con
sidered in any way as an official com
munication —merely u personal view
point.
In the first place, the rule lias been
widely misquoted. It reads in the
minutes: "No woman may sign up
for late leave 011 week nights without
permission from Women's Council."
There is nothing whatever about
"queening," or going to the city, and
there is no "slur cast on the character
of the Stanford women," as one ve
hement, melodramatic critic has it.
The rule simply aimed at a more strict
enforcement —at least for week nights
-—of the 10:30 rule, which indiscrim
inate "signing-up" had practically
neutralized.
Personally, I think the rule as it
stands is very unwieldly when put into
practice, and it will doubtless be re
adjusted; but it is only fair that the
community should have a clear con
ception of the rule's real object, and
not excite itself with wild tales' of
"convents," "the honor of the Stan
ford women," and other such child
ish. sensational and misleading catch
words.
