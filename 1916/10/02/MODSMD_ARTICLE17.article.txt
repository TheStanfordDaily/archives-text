# Santa Clara Ruggers Beat Olympics, 12-0
## 
### 
Santa Clara ruggers trounced the
Winged-0 squad for a to 0 victory
yesterday. Wet field and a slippery
ball made the game slow. The Mis
sionites were handicapped by the ab
sence of Hickey, Don, and Fitzpatrick,
three stars now on the injured list.
The first half of the game was much
of a fifty-fifty proposition, but when
the second half opened the Santa
Clarans" took things their own way,
and rushed over the line four times
in Quick succession for tries. A
heavy ball and difficult angles resulted
in failures to convert.
The Santa Clara squad met the
Olympics and defeated them largely
through their characteristic scrappi
ness. Scholz, Muldoon and Milburn
wore the stars in yesterday's game.
