# Plans Formulating for Press Building
## Editors and Business Managers of University Publications to Meet Tuesday 
### 
Editors and business managers will
meet in room 205, English building,
tomorrow, at 1 o'clock, to discuss the
establishment of a Stanford Univer
sity Press building. Plans for such
a press are being formulated, the site
to be announced soon. Stanford pub
lications are uniting in urging the
erection of such a building to handle
the University's printing.
A letter from E. W. Smith, head of
the Department of Journalism, fol
lows :
"The Stanford University Press is
established primarily to handle the
University's printing business,
but will he equipped to print under
graduate publications, provided the
publications desire it.
"The management of the press and
the location and arrangement of the
proposed building to be erected will
be very largely in the hands of Busi
ness Manager Stow. The building
can he arranged to provide quarters
for the undergraduate publications,
provided these publications make their
desires known.
"My suggestion is that as soon as
possible the publications either in
dividually, or through a joint com
munication, make their desires known
through a letter or letters to Presi
dent Wilbur.
