# Seamen's Law Is Wage Equalizer Claims Furuseth
## 
### 
That the Seamen's law will soon
equalize conditions under which ocean
going ships operate and soon place
United States on a competitive basis
favorable with that of other nations,
is the stand of Andrew Puruseth, head
of the Seamen's Union, who spoke in
Encina Hall, last night.
Makes Seamen Free.
The purpose of the Seamen's Law
is to make the man on the sea free to
quit his ship when she reaches a port
tinder the American Hag. Heretofore,
American officers have arrested men
who left ships to go to others for
higher wages. Now, according to
Furuseth, all nation's ship are com
pelled to pay wages nearly those
which Americans demand in order to
hold their crews,
law Equalizes Wages.
"The general conception is that no
one goes to sea if he can do anything
else. Whenever the men of a nation
cease to do a certain thing, the nation
loses its power to do that thing.
American sailing will not be alive
again until the American boy takes to
sea again. Sea power is no more than
the seamen. The American boy quits
the ships because of contracts which
forced him to stay by ships even if he
wanted to quit. Paying enough to
hold men when in American ports
equalizes wages in all ports of the
world.
"The Seamen's Bill is based on the
soundest thing in the world, self-love
or greed. The men who passed the
bill knew men as they are." The law
is just going into effect, according to
Furßiieth, and its effect is being no
ticed already in equalized wages, the
principal disadvantage under which
American shippers worked.
