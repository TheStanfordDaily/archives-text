Freeze-Out Contest
Latest Freak Race
Finals in the "freakiest" kind of
a freak race will be run during the
coming week, unless the Univer
sity authorities, out of sheer sym
pathy, put a stop to the contest.
The race is a race for cold
bloodedness, and is on between the
men of Encina Hall and the other
men of the campus. There is no
hot water in the gymnasium—the
showers are filled with shivering
aqua searsvilla (slightly deodor
ized). Which is a point to the
favor of all University men.
But with no steam heat in P]n
cina, and the inmates shivering
until the building shakes like
shades of 1906, the race for cold
bloodedness looks all to the candy
for Encina.
But here's the rub —and a cold
one at that—Encina doesn't want
to win. She wants to lose.

Stanford bicyclists must mount

county highway between the cam

President Wilbur doesn't know

Freeze-Out Contest
Latest Freak Race
Finals in the "freakiest" kind of
a freak race will be run during the
coming week, unless the Univer
sity authorities, out of sheer sym
pathy, put a stop to the contest.
The race is a race for cold
bloodedness, and is on between the
men of Encina Hall and the other
men of the campus. There is no
hot water in the gymnasium—the
showers are filled with shivering
aqua searsvilla (slightly deodor
ized). Which is a point to the
favor of all University men.
But with no steam heat in P]n
cina, and the inmates shivering
until the building shakes like
shades of 1906, the race for cold
bloodedness looks all to the candy
for Encina.
But here's the rub —and a cold
one at that—Encina doesn't want
to win. She wants to lose.
