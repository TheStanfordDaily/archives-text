# CAST FOR "SEVEN KEYS" MAKES HEADWAY
## ONE CHANGE IS MADE Coach Mathieu Drills Veterans for Sword and Sandals Productions 
### 
With only one change in the cast as
originally announced. Coach Mathieu
has his "Seven Keys to Baldpate"
players so primed, that the fact that
less than two weeks remain is not at
all startling.
The leading role of the novelist,
about, whom the cyclone of events
whirls, has been assigned to R. L.
Johnston, '17, who has appeared on
the Stanford stage in "Stop Thief,"
and "Ready Money." Johnston will
play opposite Miss Florence Mason,
'18, the newspaper reporter in "Seven
Keys." Miss Mason played the lead
of the epoch-marking "Pair of Sixes,"
last May.
Ilrotlier Opposite Sister.
An unusual coincidence is the pair
ing of H. A. Buffum, '18, and Miss
Thurlyne Buffum, '18, for the roles of
the Keeper of Baldpate and his spouse.
Upon the rise of the curtain, H. A.
Buffum and Miss Buffum will hold the
center of the stage for considerable
time, and among other things, will
put the audience into the proper vari
ety of happy mood for what is to
follow.
Buffum was seen in"The Great Di
vide last spring, and in "Bobby Bur
nit," his sophomore play. Miss iiuf
fum will be best remembered for her
rendering of the super-romantic

man to the mayor of "Seven Keys."
E. R. Martin, '18, the partner in the

Sixes," is scheduled to be Cargan, the
the mayor, who is so crooked that he
makes the road up Tamalpais look
like a straight-jacket.
Buford Williams, '16, the other con
vulsion conspirator of "A Pair of
Sixes," is slated to interpret the role
of Bland —quite what the name im
plies. Williams has also been seen

"Seven Days." "Men and Women," in
the lead of "The Fortune Hunter," his
Sophomore play, and other dramatic
ventures.

"The Great Divide," and other Stan
ford productions, will be seen at his
best in the role of the Hermit.
Miss Nellita Choate, '17, is to be a
blackmailer in "Seven Keys." She

and played in "Men and Women" and
"Sherwood."
