# SUFFRAGE QUESTION IN BALANCE
## 
### 
Fne-tliirtj P. M. Bulletin—Right of
Stanford students to register and vote
will probably be settled by a confer
ence held late this afternoon in the
office of Professor E. M. Cathcart of
the Law department by D. K. O'Neil,
Chief Deptuy County Clerk, J. E. Me-
Dowell, assistant registrar, Professor
It. L. Green, formerly chairman of the
county central committee, R. .1. Glen
denning, attorney from San Jose, who
is representing tho student body, and
Professor Cathcart.
(Jleiideniiing to Front.
Lenders in the Hughes Club referred
the matter to Glendenning last week,
and after investigation the San .lose
attorney found what he believed to be
evidence enough to convince authori
ties of the students' right to vote.
County Clerk Pfister returned to San
Jose today, but refrained from making
any decision in the voting question,
and leaving any action resulting from

Raymond Benjamin's letter to Chief
Deputy County Clerk O'Neil. O'Neil
is of the opinion that students cannot
vote, and refused to consider the Ben
jamin letter vital.
Professor E. M. Cathcart was in
clined to take a conservative view,
and along with O'Neil was the opposi
j lion to Glendenning, who is fighting
| for the students. Professor R. L.
j Green is in favor of allowing a vote
Ito the students who wish to make
| their residence Stanford.
Assistant Registrar McDowell ex
pressed himself neutral in the issue.
He will take whatever stand is de
cided upon by the county clerk's of
fice.
Few decisions have been rendered in
California by which the voting laws
can be interpreted. However, accord
ing to Glendenning it is entirely a
matter of preference where their resi
dence will be, and the trouble encoun
tered by the local student body is
brought about by the fact that their
preferences are made for them rather
than by themselves.
It is now too late to bring a test
case before the courts in time for reg
istration next Friday, the last day for
registration for the November presi
dential elections. Consequently, the
decision rendered at the conference
this evening will have to be final,
probably, so far as 191 voting is con
cerned.
