CO-EDNA ON ' ABSENCE "
"Absence makes the heart grow fonder," quoth
Co-Edna as she composed this ad, ••but it applies
not always. It's not true at ail of ice creams "
Co-Edna reflected.
"Wilson's Frozen Nut Custard, for example,"
she said. "It makes you say yum-yum to have a
spoonful of it present in your mouth — it's a sort of
frozen pudding, made of rich double cream, se
lected pecan nuts, and other choice ingredients.
There's nothing absent from it."
