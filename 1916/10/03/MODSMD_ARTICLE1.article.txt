M. Ham, E. T. Johnston, G. J. Levy,
R. A. Peters, J. A. Sellards, W. P.

Wakefield, .!. C. Wood.
Seniors—E. S. Anderson, A. S. Parr.
at the request of T. L. Smith, '14, of

cal Hughes Club.
Full harmony was not the outstand
ing feature of yesterday's conference,
the county and the members of the
Stanford faculty disagreeing on sev
eral points. Although Professors
Cathcart and Bingham and Green
were of the belief that an unfiexible
rule should be applied to all students
applying, O'Neil refused to acquiesce,
holding firm that on account of the
haze surrounding the term "abandon
ment" no firm and fast rule could
be applicable.
Contrary to opinion that has pre
vailed for many years, and upon
which decisions regarding abandon
ment of former residence have been
based, self-support is not a requisite
for the privilege of establishing resi
dence.
In brief, a student who has not reg
istered elsewhere during the past 90
days and who wishes to adopt a new
legal residence and cast off former
legal residence and cast off a former
domicile and who can offer facts to
bear out his declaration of intention,
is in a position to declare residence.
Four days yet remain for registra
tion, either in Palo Alto or on tho
campus. Those who are doubtful of
their status as residents of Stanford.
I are advised to consult with McDowell.
