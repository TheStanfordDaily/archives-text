# SUFFRAGE! NOW WHAT
## 
### 
After a spirited parley of political
and legal war-chiefs over the student
vote controversy, which has held a
spotlight center of the campus stage
during the past week, disputed points
have been hashed and thrashed out to
a fairly satisfactory conclusion with a
resulting slight shade in favor of the
ballot campaigners. As a conse
quence there have evolved from the
suffrage wrangle various interesting
side-lights that bear close scrutiny.

Consensus of opinion, with which
the worthy representative of the coun
ty clerk acquiesced, concludes that
any student has the right to declare
Stanford University his legal resi
dence following abandonment of his
former home; and that the question
of non-support in no wise concerns
the argument at hand. The only open
issue remaining then upon which a
final verdict lingers, winds itself
about the word "abandonment."
Despite the fact that an explanation
of this term would satisfactorily clar
ify matters, the gentleman from the
county clerk's office begged absolute
excusal, feigning there were a thous
and and one things entering into such
a definition —yet upon second thought
we are led to believe there are not
nearly so many.

Upon Assistant Registrar McDowell
now rests the responsibility of regist
ering students according to the best
of his knowledge of the individual.
No definite rule may be applied, but
rather each distinct case left to Mr.
McDowell's discretion —which under
the existing circumstances of the
county clerk's refusal to define
abandonment seems undoubtedly the
wisest course to pursue. During the
past few years, the trend of court
decisions and existing practice of of
ficials in charge has been character
ized by wide liberality in awarding
students suffrage privileges, wherever
a broad reading of the law will per
mit. The student-body may rest as
sured Mr. McDowell will pursue a
similar just and liberal policy when
conducting registration.

Saturday evening, which marks
thirty days before the election, is the
final hour established by law for reg
istration. All students, both men
and women, should not fail, if of age,
immediately to ascertain and make
use of voting privileges before the
final rinsing down of the curtain.
Proper realization of public duty and
responsibility demand this act.
