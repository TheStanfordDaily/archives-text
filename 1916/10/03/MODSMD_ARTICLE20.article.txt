Don't become excited or fright
ened tomorrow, when you emerge
from one of your class rooms if
you see a monster bug in the air
and hear the buzzing of its wings.
Also don't become frightened
should you see a man sitting in
this monstrous bug, holding a lit
tle box and turning a little
crank.
He will be shooting you, but
there will be no need for seeking
a cyclone cellar or other place of
shelter. No, war will not be de
clared by that time.
The aeroplane and the man turn
ing the crank will be on an en
tirely peaceful mission. Frank
Bryant, instructor at the Christ
offerson School of Aeronautics, at
Redwood, will pilot the machine,
and he will be accompanied by a
Hearst-Selig film concern man,
"who will turn the crank."
