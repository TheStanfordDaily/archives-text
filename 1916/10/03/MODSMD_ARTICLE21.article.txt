Dates for the Football Benefit
Dance, which is to occur next Fri
day evening in Encina Hall, are still
in order. Rumor has it that those
who have not yet made arrangements
for this occasion will suffer the re
sults of procrastination. Since definite
announcement of the dance was made
only yesterday, careful canvassing
shows that only a few of the willing
"500" are "engaged."
Support of this affair is urgently
requested by L. 11. Chandler, '18,
chairman of the committee in charge,
as proceeds arc needed to defray
training table expenses. The best of
music will be furnished by campus
talent, and a series of original stunts
are to be given in between dances.
Tickets may be obtained from the
bookstore or from fraternity repre
sentatives for the small sum of $1.00.
