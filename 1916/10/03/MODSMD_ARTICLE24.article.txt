F. K. Murray, '17, and N. W. Ilake
straw, '16, are the only entrants in
the Rhodes scholarship qualifying ex
aminations today and tomorrow.
Their papers will be sent to Oxford
for correction, and word will be sent
back as to whether or not they have
qualified. As no selection will be
made from California for a scholarship
this year, Stanford students who qual
ify in similar examinations next fall
are also eligible.
Selection Next Fall.
Following next year's tests, one man
from every California university and
college competing, will be consid
ered by the state committee, of which
Dr. Benjamin Ide Wheeler, president
of the University of California, is
chairman, and one candidate will be
elected to the scholarship for three
years, beginning in the fall of 1!)18, at
Oxford. The scholarship is worth $1500
a year, and is awarded every two out
of three years to one man from Cali
fornia.
Professor A. T. Murray, of the Greek
department, chairman of the local
committee, is anxious to see any stu
dents who contemplate preparing for
the examinations next fall. Only one
year of Greek is necessary for the
tests, according to Dr. Murray.
