# Construction Work Progresses Rapidly
## Ninety-One New Encina Rooms to House One Hundred and Fifty Men 
### 
All construction work on the cam-1
pus is being pushed forward at a
rapid rate in order that the greater
part ol' the building activities may
be over beiore the approach oi' the
winter months.
A force of eighty-three workmen Is
rushing the improvements on Encina
Hall to completion. A considerable
portion of the new fifth lloor has been
plastered already, while the remainder
is being walled off and lathed. In
the basement of the dormitory, the
work has been started more recently,
but, as there is less to be done, it
will be completed in the course of
two months, the same time that the
work on the upper lloor will be fin
ished.
Between 130 and 150 new men will
be enabled to enter the hall next se
mester as a result of these enlarge
ments. Old men will be given iirst
i pick of the new rooms, following
j which new men will hold a drawing
■ in December to fill the new and old
! rooms that are vacant. Custodian G.
I J. Griest has expressed the belief that
I the opening of the new rooms at En
i ciua will just about abolish the wait
ing list, for the present at least. Al
! though there are three hundred names
|on the list, a number of these men
| have made other permanent living ar
! rangements or else have left college.
In all, ninety-one new rooms will re
j suit from the additions to the men's
| dormitory. Thirty-four of these are
1 in the basement, and are almost with
out exception double apartments.
| Upstairs, in what was formerly the
'attic, are fifty single and seven double
! rooms. The dormer windows on the
roof have bet n enlarged to allow for
sufficient light and air.
South and west walls of the Thomas
Wei ton Stanford Art Museum are
completed to what v.ill be the level
of the eaves. Arches and walls of
the arcades and entrances facing the
! Quad and the Encina sidewalk are also
i practically finished. A large portion
jof the root will be of glass, to furn
: ish sufficient light for the galleries
| beneath.
Most of the tiles for the arcade
flooring on the southeast corner of
the Quad, around the History corner,
I have been replaced, now that a firmer
I foundation lias been installed to hold
up the pavement. As soon as all of
the temporary framework can be re
moved, construction of classrooms in
the basement of the History building
itself will be completed.
Other University structures of var
ious kinds which are being built this
semester, and which are going up
speedily, include the new school
house on the east side of Lasuen,
! women's swimming tank, the new
j presidential residence on the campus,
