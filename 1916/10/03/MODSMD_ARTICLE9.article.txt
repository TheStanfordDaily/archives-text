# Lowell High Versus Freshmen Tomorrow
## Coach Makes Few Changes in First Year Line-Up as Team Improves 
### 
Lowell high school will be the op
| ponent of the Stanford freshmen in
I tomorrow's football game. Graduate
Manager Hehrens has received word
! from the San Francisco school stating
that the fifteen to meet the local first
year team is a strong one, and will
i give them a hard game. It is ex
| pected that the bleachers wilt be well
filled, as the freshmen have come back
to life and are now playing a good
brand of rugby. Season tickets will
1 be honored at the gate, the admission
l'ee for those without the pasteboards
i lif-i'ig set at tire usual twenty-five
1 cents.
i Referee "Ric" Tenipleton will start
the contest at 4:30. Coach Brown has
made a few changes in the freshmen
lineup, but in the main, the same team
i will be used that decisively defeated
i Fremont high school in the curtain
! raiser last Saturday. Toole, who has
I been playing in the forwards, is slated
J for a try at the backfield, while it is
possible that ' Red" Aubert, who had
his nose broken in practice last week,
j will again take a fling at front rank
! Rumor has it that Jay Risling, the
J crack five-eighths of. the 1920 squad,
may leave college. If this is the case,
the freshmen team will be greatly
weakened, as the little player from
Palo Alto is a great scoring man.
The lineup of the Lowell team fol
lows: Manelli, McMillian and Bassett.
front rank: Cunha and MacKenzie,
middle rank: Postlethwaite, Wilson
and Bering, rear rank; Adams, half;
Young and Shaffer, five-eighths; Turk
