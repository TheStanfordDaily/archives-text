# NO FOOTBALL ISSUE EXISTS SAYS DR. F. ANGELL
## WRITES PUBLIC LETTER Surprised to Hear That Vote Had Been Taken By the Local Student Body 
### 
At the request of a number of peo
ple on tlie campus, Dr. Frank Angell
has- prepared the following statement
of the athletic policy of the Univer
sity, as it will he handled through his
office, that of head of the Faculty
Athletic Committee.
The letter follows:
"On my return to the campus I met
a representative of (lie press, who
asked me to give my opinion on the
'football situation.' I was unaware
that there was a 'situation' till I was
informed that it existed.
"To be sure, while abroad, I was
somewhat perplexed by the report
that there had been a vote on bring
ing back the old game. So far as I
knew, this was no more a matter to
be settled by vote than is the require
ment in English A. Both are meas
ures passed by the University au
thorities, and it is as valid to vote
on the one as the other.
Conditions Not Clear.
I"I presumed, however, that this
i state of affairs was not clearly known
to the most of the men in the Univer
sity.
"Some 14 years ago we started in
011 the general athletic policy for
which Stanford now enjoys some con
siderable reputation throughout the
country—the policy of 'general partic
ipation. The chief obstacle in the
way of the spread of that policy was
found to be the American game of
football. Chiefly for this reason it
was abolished. Specifically the ruling
was passed a few years later that
110 football game admitting interfer
ence would be allowed as an official
game on the campus. As is evident
from the football conditions in most
American colleges the objections to
the American game which were chief
ly operative in its abolishment are
still valid, and there is not the slight
ets prospect that the ruling as regards
interference will be rescinded in any
prospective time.
"The question of preference for one
form of game as opposed to another
is not at issue here. A university ad
ministration has no business with
preferences which it would try to im
pose on the students: but a university
administration has, or should have, a
clear cut athletic policy, and in pur
suance of that policy it should take
such measures as it thinks wise.
"The policy of Stanford for over 14
years has been that of opening up
and broadening athletics—that is, the
policy of general participation. With
that policy the American game of
football is in conflict. To think that
there is going to be any change or
reversal of this policy and bring down
the football situation here to the level
that exists in most American colleges
today, is out of the question."
