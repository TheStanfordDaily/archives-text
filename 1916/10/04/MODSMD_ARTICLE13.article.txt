## WRITES PUBLIC LETTER Surprised to Hear That Vote Had Been Taken By the Local Student Body 
### 
At the request of a number of peo
ple on tlie campus, Dr. Frank Angell
has- prepared the following statement
of the athletic policy of the Univer
sity, as it will he handled through his
office, that of head of the Faculty
Athletic Committee.
The letter follows:
"On my return to the campus I met
a representative of (lie press, who
asked me to give my opinion on the
'football situation.' I was unaware
that there was a 'situation' till I was
informed that it existed.
"To be sure, while abroad, I was
somewhat perplexed by the report
that there had been a vote on bring
ing back the old game. So far as I
knew, this was no more a matter to
be settled by vote than is the require
ment in English A. Both are meas
ures passed by the University au
thorities, and it is as valid to vote
on the one as the other.
Conditions Not Clear.
I"I presumed, however, that this
i state of affairs was not clearly known
