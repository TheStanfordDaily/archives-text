## Poll Will Be Taken of Local Attitude Toward Proposed Preparedness Plan 
### 
Stanford students' attitude toward
the adoption 01 tlie Swiss system of
military drill for the United States
will be sought some time during the
present week, when ballots will be
distributed throughout the student
body. Under the auspices of the
"Sacramento Bee" a poll on this ques
tion is being taken, the ballots calling
for a vote on the advisability of es
tablishing military training in this
country on the system in effect in
Switzerland, where all young men who
are physically and mentally tit are
liable for a limited period of military
drill.
Swiss System Explained.
In brief, the Swiss system subjects
every male upon becoming twenty
years of age, to a physical and men
tal examination. The tests are so
strict that only fifty per cent of the
youth of the country pass it. Those
who are accepted are sent to an in
fantry school for sixty days, or to a
cavalry school for ninety days. Fol
lowing this short period at a military
school, the men are subject to eleven
days of military drill in alternate
years for twelve years. Then, having
reached the age of 32, the men are
subject to but one eleven-day period
during the succeeding eight years.
After 40, the men are subject to call
only in case of war.
Tax Those Who Fail.
The men who do not pass the mili
tary examination are subjected to an
income tax sufficient to pay for the
military expenses involved in train
ing the physically and mentally fit.
The chief virtue of the Swiss system
is regarded as being in the fact that
it is a successful "preparedness"
plan and yet avoids militarism.
