## 
### 
Wednesday evening, October 18,
will be the date of this year's Ber
wick Peace Prize contest, instead of

the change. The Berwick will be held
in the Little Theater, beginning at
7:30.
A prize of $i>o is awarded every
year in this contest, by Edward Ber
wick of Pacific Grove, in honor of the
memory of his son, Edward Berwick,

port to Associate Professor L. E. Bas
sett. of the English department, at
once. Last year's winner in the Ber
wick was A. L. Johnson, '15.
