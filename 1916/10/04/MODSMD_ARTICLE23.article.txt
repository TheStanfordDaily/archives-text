# Mat Contest Brings Out Many Entrants
## Seven Weight Divisions Made for Thursday Wrestling Bouts 
### 
Entries in tlie 135-pound and 125-
pound weight divisions of the novice
wrestling tournament, which will be
held tomorrow evening, indicate that
those classes will be well represented
in the first novice tourney of the
year. The 145-pound and 175-pound
divisions have attracted the next
greatest number of contestants, lie
sides these weight classes there will
be bouts in the 105-, 115-, and 158-
pound classes. Entries are still open
and can be made with 1). C. Wise, '17,
who announces that contestants
should hand in their names by Thurs
day noon. All contestants will be
weighed in just before the match.
The tournament is scheduled to
start promptly at 7:30 in Encina gym
nasium. Because of the relatively
large number of entries to date it bids
fair to be one of the most successful
contests of its kind that Stanford has
witnessed. It is the hope of those in
charge that it will be the means of
bringing out some new material for
the coining intercollegiate matches.
