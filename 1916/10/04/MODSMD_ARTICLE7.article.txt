Threatening the proprietor with
ruin, if he did not "fork over" a set
of flattering photographs of each and
every one of the party, a score of
crooked politicians and blackmailers,
accompanied by a romantic, adven
ture-seeking newspaper woman, in
vaded the studio of Frank Davey of
Palo Alto, the other day, and with the
admonition to "make it snappy," don
ned costumes and make-up and dis

ported themselves in front of the
camera.
Davey saved himself and his name
by snapping one of the most attrac
tive sets of dramatic photographs yet
prepared for campus display.
Sword and Sandals has promised a
new feature for their photographic
exhibition of the "Seven Keys to Hald
pate" players, with orders placed for
enlargements several times the size
of the ordinary Quad placard print.
