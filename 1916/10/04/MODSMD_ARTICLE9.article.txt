Editorial Statement)
Although Stanford stud
ents are perfectly cog
nizant of the fact that
the university campus
is their legal resi
dence, yet they success
fully manage to bam
boozle themselves out
of their voting privi
leges by a chicken
hearted and weak-kneed
refusal to allow due
consideration to the
verdict of their own
conscience. Instead of
acting like ordinary
human beings, they be
come convinced that by
surrendering suffrage
rights upon a questioned
registration they are
performing a patriotic
act of loftymoral tone.
Any man or woman of
age attending an educa
tional institution in
the state of California,
who has been in the
county ninety days and
state one year, thereby
excluding freshmen, may
register and vote, pro
vided he or she holds the
campus to be his or her
residence, and have not
registered elsewhere
during the past three
months ,
Stanford University, beyond the
shadow of a doubt, is the legal resi
dence of every student, to all intents
and purposes, who is not registered
elsewhere, since he lias moved, bag
and baggage, from his former domi
cile to the campus. Thereafter a stu
dent is in no position to predict his
future legal residence, whether Hono
lulu or San Quentin; but one para
mount fact is apparent—that all for
mer residences have been abandoned
with the resulting substitution of
Stanford.
* * * * * * * *
Just why a large number of stu
dents complacently assent to denial
of suffrage privileges upon the intro
duction of a few hypothetical theories
by the registrar—rather placing them
selves in the category of a pack of
dumb hounds in a dog show, with the
California voters as the whipping
trainers—is unfathomable. Especially
unintelligible is the situation when it
is common knowledge that the exhi
bition of a little backbone and gump
tion in demanding voting rights, when
reasonable, will secure the same.
Which classification do you fall in:
the tender-hearted who believes he is
and isn't a citizen, like the negroes
and the grandfather class in the
south, or haven't you stirred up suf
ficient energy out of a lethargic sys
tem to even attempt to vote? Both
classes are contemptible.
The Daily Palo Alto takes pleasure
in announcing in today's issue the ap
pointment of Frank F. Walker, '18, to
the position of assistant business man
ager. For the past year he has ex
hibited an uncanny knack of landing
advertising contracts, besides show
ing skill in running the business end
of the paper, for which reasons the
appointment is well merited.

advertising contracts, besides show

appointment is well merited.
Editorial Statement)
Although Stanford stud
ents are perfectly cog
nizant of the fact that
the university campus
is their legal resi
dence, yet they success
fully manage to bam
boozle themselves out
of their voting privi
leges by a chicken
hearted and weak-kneed
refusal to allow due
consideration to the
verdict of their own
conscience. Instead of
acting like ordinary
human beings, they be
come convinced that by
surrendering suffrage
rights upon a questioned
registration they are
performing a patriotic
act of loftymoral tone.
Any man or woman of
age attending an educa
tional institution in
the state of California,
who has been in the
county ninety days and
state one year, thereby
excluding freshmen, may
register and vote, pro
vided he or she holds the
campus to be his or her
residence, and have not
registered elsewhere
during the past three
months ,
Stanford University, beyond the
shadow of a doubt, is the legal resi
dence of every student, to all intents
and purposes, who is not registered
elsewhere, since he lias moved, bag
and baggage, from his former domi
cile to the campus. Thereafter a stu
dent is in no position to predict his
future legal residence, whether Hono
lulu or San Quentin; but one para
mount fact is apparent—that all for
mer residences have been abandoned
with the resulting substitution of
Stanford.
* * * * * * * *
Just why a large number of stu
dents complacently assent to denial
of suffrage privileges upon the intro
duction of a few hypothetical theories
by the registrar—rather placing them
selves in the category of a pack of
dumb hounds in a dog show, with the
California voters as the whipping
trainers—is unfathomable. Especially
unintelligible is the situation when it
is common knowledge that the exhi
bition of a little backbone and gump
tion in demanding voting rights, when
reasonable, will secure the same.
Which classification do you fall in:
the tender-hearted who believes he is
and isn't a citizen, like the negroes
and the grandfather class in the
south, or haven't you stirred up suf
ficient energy out of a lethargic sys
tem to even attempt to vote? Both
classes are contemptible.
The Daily Palo Alto takes pleasure
in announcing in today's issue the ap
pointment of Frank F. Walker, '18, to
the position of assistant business man
ager. For the past year he has ex
hibited an uncanny knack of landing
advertising contracts, besides show
ing skill in running the business end
of the paper, for which reasons the
appointment is well merited.
