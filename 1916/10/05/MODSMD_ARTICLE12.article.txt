# PLAN TO OMIT ALL ADS FROM FUTURE QUADS
## RAISE PRICE OF BOOK Executive Committee Seeks New Method for Choosing Yell Leaders 
### 
That the Stanford "Quad" be pub
lished without advertisements and
that the price of the year book be
raised from $2.50 to $3.00 are the
recommendations to the Junior Class
passed by the Executive Committee
at last night's meeting, following the
report of a special committee ap
pointed to investigate the matter. The
loss occasioned by entirely elimin
ating ads will not be great, as the
expense of obtaining advertisers and
of printing the ads has eaten up the
greater portion of the gross receipts
from this source. Though the .Junior
Class lias bad no opportunity to act
on the recommendation, F. W. Weeks,
'18, manager of the 1918 year book,
has expressed his approval of the
plan. He will present the matter to
the class at its next meeting, when
definite action will be taken.
Make Quad More Artistic.
Entirely aside from financial con
siderations, it is maintained by the
members of the Quad investigating
committee that the Quad will gain
much in an artistic way by leaving
out the advertising section. The prin
cipal purpose of the book is to furn
ish a record of the year's activities,
and it is held that ads in no way help
the book in fulfilling its intended pur
pose.
Change Veil Leader Elections.
In the hopes that a more suitable
method of electing yell leaders may
be evolved than that now in force, a
committee was appointed to consult
with Yell Leader Gilroy in working
out an improved plan. The com
plaint against the present plan is
lai'gcly that it is too cumbersome and
ineffective.
The minutes of the meeting are as
follows:
President Swigart in chair.
Pelouze absent.
M. S. C. That committee of three be
appointed to comsult with Yell
Leader Gilroy about a more suitable
way to elect yell leaders in future.
M. S. C. That the Executive Commit
