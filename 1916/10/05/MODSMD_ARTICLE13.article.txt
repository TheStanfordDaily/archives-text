houses have already signed, while
others have signified their intention
of doing so. The teams desiring to
enter should sign up at the gym be
fore October in, at which time draw
ings for places in the league will be
held.
In order that no houses will have
undue advantage, varsity men will not

It is expected that in this way the
teams will be more equalized, afford
ing keener competition.
New men out for the squad are hold
ing practice every Wednesday and
Friday under the direction of Captain
Wheatly.
Pre-season practice will be in the
nature of a peanut league in which
every man out for the squad will
have a chance to play. This league,
according to Wheatly, will commence
in a short time, and should bring to
light new varsity material before the
season actually starts.
