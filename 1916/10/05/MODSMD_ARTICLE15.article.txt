# DEBASED SHEEPSKINS
## 
### 
Sometimes a man receives an
emolument or honor which he sadly
recognizes as undeserved, thus strip
ping praise of false trimmings and
transforming esteem into an eternal
bad taste. Sometimes a few individ
uals receive university diplomas that
should signify a hungered-for reward
in return for honest study, yet the sig
nificance of their sheepskins is but
mechanical, other than the harbinger
of a pang of remorse. When the
freshmen were advised and warned
against cheating at the assembly (in
the Little Theater) this morning, the
point at issue was brought home in
a striking manner.

Of late years, the educational pen
dulum at Stanford lias swung slowly
toward the adoption of the honor
system in various departments of the
University. The most recent installa
tion was made by the Department of
Economics, where cheating, once a
common occurrence, now faces a
shrunken anti-climax. A more ideal
example of gentlemanly conduct dur
ing examinations could hardly be
found in any educational institution
than that exemplified in the Stanford
Law department, which for many
years has practiced the honor system.
«*«****»
Sketched briefly, the honor system
provides for temporary isolation of
professor and student during the ex
amination period,—the faculty mem
ber leaving the class room, while the
blue book scribblers are left to their
own devices. In any case where
cheating is observed, the infringer of
the law is warned by his fellow stu
dents. Upon a second occurrence of
the offense, the Council is notified
and doles out proper punishment.
When correctly operated through co
operation of professor and student, the
honor system is unimpeachable, mark
ing clearly the line of demarcation
between preparatory schools and uni
versities. Future growth of the honor
system is dependent upon personal
individual integrity.
