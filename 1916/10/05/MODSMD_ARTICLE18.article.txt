# Advisory Board Will Dine at Santa Clara
## 
### 
Professors A. T. Murray and Frank
Angell, Doctor S. M. Williams, E. C.
Behrens, T. E. Swigart and R. Maurer,
composing the Stanford Advisory
Board, will go to the University of
Santa Clara tonight as guests at a
dinner given by the athletic manage
ment of that institution. Graduate
Manager Behrens stated that he ex
pected that the details of the game
between the Stanford freshmen and
the freshmen of Santa Clara Univer
sity would be arranged tonight.
The game will be played on the 14th
of October, but whether it will be
played on the local turf or on the field
in the Mission Town has not been
determined. The lists of eligible
players have not been exchanged as
yet, but this will be done within a
day or two. The question of a ref
eree will probably be settled tonight
also.
