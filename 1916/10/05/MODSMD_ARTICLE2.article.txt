# Military Men to Get Suits Without Cost
## New Bill Passed By Congress Provides Free Uniforms for Recruits 
### 
That uniforms as well as arms will
be furnished the men in the military
training class at Stanford, became
known today when President Wilbur
received a copy of the new bill re
cently passed by Congress in regard
to instruction in military tactics. This
bill makes legal the appointment of
Major Jens Bugge, retired army of
ficer, as director of the Department
at Stanford.
Announcement that there will be
no charge for suits is expected to
boost registration in the drill course,
as a number of students did not feel
willing to expend ten dollars or more
for a uniform. The only thing that
each man will have to purchase, ac
cording to the new ruling, will be
an army shirt.
To Speed Shipment.
Major Bugge conferred with (Jen
oral Bell in San Francisco yesterday
concerning possibilities of expediting
shipment of uniforms and of arms
and munitions to the campus. It is
expected that both will be here with
in approximately a fortnight. Tonight
Major Bugge will talk on the use of
the rifle.
All but five non-commissioned in
structors will be released at the end
of this week, Major Bugge believed
today. He stated that at that time
he will be able to name at least some
of the senior student officers.
