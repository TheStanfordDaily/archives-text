# Cathcart Defines "Legal Residence"
## Student Voters Now Total Over 225 in Palo Alto and on Campus 
### 
In an exposition of the meaning and
importance of "residence" as regards
tlie status of the student voter, Pro
fessor A. M. Cathcart of the Depart
ment of Law, today made the follow
ing two points, the knowledge of
which is necessary, and at the same
time of invaluable benefit to the stu
dent-citizen.
1. Inasmuch as intention of resi
dence is the fact that must be given
foremost consideration, if the stu
dent has chosen his college as his
true home, he may justly claim that
he is a resident of the Stanford pre
cinct.
2. No student who regards himself
as having a home elsewhere when reg
istration and voting are not under
consideration, cannot make this pre
cinct his legal residence lor voting
purposes only.
According to estimates close to 225
students have registered in Palo Alto
and on the campus since the opening
of the present semester. Of this num
ber, 125 have signed the big book in
the Registrar's ollice on the Quad; the
other 100 became citizens at the City
Hall in Palo Alto. Saturday is the
final day for registration.
Editor The Daily Palo Alto:
You have asked for a brief state
ment of my understanding of the
meaning and importance of resi
dence in determining whether a
particular student has a right to
register and vote. It is of course
generally understood that the
voter must be 21 years of age, that
he must have resided within the
state one year, within the county
ninety days, and within the pre
cinct thirty days before the elec
tion. What is meant by "re
sided" in this connection? This
question is answered in full by
Sec. 1239 of the Political Code.
In so far as they are applicable
to our problem the rules laid
down by this section are as fol
lows:
(1) That place must be consid
ered and held to be the resi
dence of a person in which his
habitation is fixed, and to which,
whenever he is absent, it is his
intention to return; (2) A person
must not be held to have gained
or lost residence . . . while a
student at any institution of learn
ing . . . (9) mere intention to
acquire a new residence, with
out the fact of removal, avails
nothing; neither does the fact of
removal, without the intention.
Rule 2 seems to be pretty se
vere upon the student. It is how
ever but repetition of Sec. 4, art.
II of the Constitution. In Stewart
v. Kyser, 105 Cal. 459, it is held
that this provision did not pre
vent students of Napa College
from gaining a residence at the
college. In fact, the cases seem
to show that the ultimate fact is
the intention with which the stu
dent comes to the University. If
he has always lived in Los An
geles, he may decide to abandon
that city as his home and to move
to the Stanford campus; he may
thereafter regard the campus as
his only true home so that in case
he goes to see his friends or rel
atives, even his own parents, in
Los Angeles, he will go as a vis
itor only and not as oue return
ing home. If all this is true he
may justly claim that he is a
resident of the Stanford precinct.
If, however, he regards himself
as having a home at Los Angeles
when registration and voting are
not under consideration, nothing
can be clearer than that he can
not make this precinct his legal
residence for voting purposes
only.
Respectfully,
A. M. CATITCART.
