# Engineering Men Hear Major Bugge On Army Science
## 
### 
"An army cannot be organized over
night," Major Bugge told the Engi
neering assembly this morning. "We
must organize our hospital corps, our
armies, and our supply departments
now. It will be too late when war
comes." According to Major Bugge
we have a false sense of security for
we believe our coast defenses are
sufficient to protect us, but in reality
have only harbor defenses. "An army
could land on our unprotected coast
line and take our defenses from the
rear. We need an army to guard
against this danger."
"The war in Europe has taught the
value of artillery, but it has also
taught that a powerful army is needed
to guard the artillery."
Major Bugge outlined the whole
system of military science to his aud
ience, strategy, tactics, and supply or
ganization. "I am a strong advocate
of the German system. We should
have every man trained along these
three lines."
