Former Coacli George Presley was
on the sidelines last Saturday, and
expressed his opinion of the men in
action. He believes that Stanford will
be represented this year by a team
that will be as good as any past var
sity. He says that the men show the
necessary fight and dash, and that
individually the team cannot be
beaten. If, by a few more practice

proved, Presley thinks that victory is
assured in the game with Santa Clara.
