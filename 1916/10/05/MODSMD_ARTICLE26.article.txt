### 
By working all day Saturday, Octo
ber 7, the members of the Zoology
Club intend to finish the construction
of the field experiment station, which
is being built near Searsville. Girls
in the club will furnish a hot lunch
to the workers.
The club met last night at the home
of Dr. J. O. Snyder, in Palo Alto, and
Professor C. 11. Gilbert of the Zoology
department related his experiences
working for the British government
in Canada, experimenting with ways
in which to increase the salmon runs.
