# SOCIOLOGICAL CLUB SPEAKER ARRAIGNS LABOR FEDERATIONS
## 
### 
"This nation will be free in name
only, whenever the natural right of
a man to earn a livelihood is con
trolled by a labor organization," said
James A. Emery, counsel for the Na
tional Manufacturers' Association, in
his lecture last night at the Little
Theater, on "Labor Organizations and
Government." His address, which
was under the auspices of the Socio
logical Society, was a severe arraign
ment of the purposes and methods of
the National Federation of Labor, and
his arguments were presented with
lawyer-like clearness and force.
"The weapons of the strike and boy
cott are as deadly and destructive as
the artillery of a modern army. No
fair-minded man can object to the
right of an organization for the bene
fit of the members, but it is a well
known fact that a combination is not
a mere aggregate of individuals. In
it a member must subordinate his own
thoughts, ideas, and purposes, to those
of his leaders. The organized minor
ity controls the unorganized majority,
giving the power of numbers to the
organization of a unit."
Concluding his speech, Mr. Emery
said: "Out of justice to the men
who are coming to this country as
immigrants, we must preserve equal
rights and equal opportunities,. A
man must be able to pursue his busi
ness. without bowing to the caprice or
whim of leaders with whom he is not
in sympathy."
