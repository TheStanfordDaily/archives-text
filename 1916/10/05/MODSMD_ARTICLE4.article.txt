# TO TAKE VOTE ON MILITARY SYSTEM
## 
### 
Students will be given an opportun
ity tomorrow morning to express
themselves in regard to the system
of military training which is being
proposed for adoption by the United
States. Ballots calling fos a vote on
the desirability of the Swiss system
for this country will be distributed
in all S o'clock classes unless the pro
fessors in charge object to the voting.
In the 9 o'clock classes, ballots will
be distributed to those students who
have not been in any 8 o'clock class.
The ballots were sent out by the Sac
ramento, "Bee," which publication is
taking a wide poll on the question.
President Wilbur sanctioned the poll
of the student body upon his return
to the campus today.
Wording of Hsillot.
The ballots call for a vote on the
proposition: "I am an ad
vocate of National legislation which
will place the Military Policy of the
country on the basis of a true democ
racy as provided in the Constitution
of the United States.
"1 believe this can be brought about
only by making all young men who
are physically and mentally fit liable
for military training before reaching
the age of twenty-one.
"I believe that such a policy would
not only produce the force of trained
citizen soldiers necessary to the pres
ervation of the Nation, but would con
serve the human resources of the Na
tion so as to reduce the criminal rate,
produce higher type of manhood, and
destroy all traces of class distinction
by training and educating the poor
and rich alike in the higher duties of
citizenship under the same ennobling
and invigorating system.
"I believe that military training on
the Swiss system of devoting a slight
period of time during youth, or legis
lation along these lines worked out
with the advice of the general staff
of the army, will solve the problem."
The Swiss system calls upon all
menially and physically fit males of
twenty years for a short period of
training, and for the twelve years
between the ages of 20 and 32 gives
11 days of training in alternate years.
One 11 day period of training be
tween the ages of 32 and 40, and read
iness for call in case of war for men
over 40 are additional provisions.
Those who are not fit for military ser
vice arc called upon for an income
tax sufficient to cover the cost of
training the mentally and physically
able.

"1 believe this can be brought about
only by making all young men who
are physically and mentally fit liable
for military training before reaching
the age of twenty-one.
"I believe that such a policy would
not only produce the force of trained
citizen soldiers necessary to the pres
ervation of the Nation, but would con
serve the human resources of the Na
tion so as to reduce the criminal rate,
produce higher type of manhood, and
destroy all traces of class distinction
by training and educating the poor
and rich alike in the higher duties of
citizenship under the same ennobling
and invigorating system.
"I believe that military training on
the Swiss system of devoting a slight
period of time during youth, or legis
lation along these lines worked out
with the advice of the general staff
of the army, will solve the problem."
The Swiss system calls upon all
menially and physically fit males of
twenty years for a short period of
training, and for the twelve years
between the ages of 20 and 32 gives
11 days of training in alternate years.
One 11 day period of training be
tween the ages of 32 and 40, and read
iness for call in case of war for men
over 40 are additional provisions.
Those who are not fit for military ser
vice arc called upon for an income
tax sufficient to cover the cost of
training the mentally and physically
able.
