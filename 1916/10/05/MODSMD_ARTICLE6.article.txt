# LOWELL BEATS BABES AFTER HARD CONTEST
## VISITORS ARE HEAVY Wet Field Slows Up Backfield Action of Cardinal Frosh Who Lose 3 to 0 
### 
Although beaten by Lowell high
school by a 3 to 0 score, the freshmen
won their way into the hearts of the
Stanford rugby fans, yesterday after
noon, by their wonderful finish. From
a game that was void of unusual ex
citement, and made slow by continual
forward play, the contest suddenly
changed, in the last period, to one
that would arouse the most pessimis
tic bleacher-warmer, fn the last ten
minutes of the midweek tangle, en
thusiasm ran wild, and the rooters
quickly entered into the spirit of the
game.
Lowell Fifteen Husky.
Lowell high school trotted out fif
teen very husky specimens of foot
ball material, and considering the fact
that they held the same Berkeley ag
gregation that defeated the freshmen,
to a 3 to 0 score, the prospects of
victory for the Cardinal babes looked
none too promising. The final result
was not unexpected and was not a dis
credit to the Stanford team.
No Score In First.
The first half ended without either
side scoring. The game was slow
for the most part, being featured by
the rushes of the high school for
wards, and some excellent kicking by
Angell, freshman fullback. The only
real opportunity the freshmen had
for a score was on an attempted goal
kick on a penalty by Needham. The
angle was difficult, and tne Kick
failed.
From the first whistle from Referee
Lockliart Card in the second half, the
play seemed to go faster. The game
was opened up more to the backfields
and presented a better spectacle to
the bleachers. Lowell took the ball
away from the freshmen continually
in the scrum and consequently had
an advantage. With the 1920 team on
defense, the ball went from Adams to
Schaffer, to Turkington to Weil, who
went over for the lone try of the game.
The attempt at conversion failed.
Freshmen Display Comeback.
From this point on the freshmen
opened up and "showed more" than
they have displayed all season. With
Larkin, Barneson, Henry, Risling and
.loerg leading in offensive, the first
year aggregation swept Lowell ahead.
The final whistle found the teams
buttling in the center of the field and
for five minutes the freshmen kept
the ball in play in a vain effort to
tie or defeat the high school fifteen.
The ball finally went to touch on the
Lowel ten-yard line with the Stanford
team playing as it had not played
before this season. The lineups fol
low :
Stanford Freshmen —Wayland, Har
neson and Henry, (James), front
rank; Bowden and Martin, middle
rank; Snook, (Meyer), Toole and
Gardner, rear rank; Larkin, half;
Risling and .loerg, five-eighths;
Strong, (Angell), center-three; Need

Angell, (Strain), full.
Lowell High School —Manelli and

Weil and Schaffer, five-eighths; Turk
ington, center-three; Stevick and Ad

Although beaten by Lowell high
school by a 3 to 0 score, the freshmen
won their way into the hearts of the
Stanford rugby fans, yesterday after
noon, by their wonderful finish. From
a game that was void of unusual ex
citement, and made slow by continual
forward play, the contest suddenly
changed, in the last period, to one
that would arouse the most pessimis
tic bleacher-warmer, fn the last ten
minutes of the midweek tangle, en
thusiasm ran wild, and the rooters
quickly entered into the spirit of the
game.
Lowell Fifteen Husky.
Lowell high school trotted out fif
teen very husky specimens of foot
ball material, and considering the fact
that they held the same Berkeley ag
gregation that defeated the freshmen,
to a 3 to 0 score, the prospects of
victory for the Cardinal babes looked
none too promising. The final result
was not unexpected and was not a dis
credit to the Stanford team.
No Score In First.
The first half ended without either
side scoring. The game was slow
for the most part, being featured by
the rushes of the high school for
wards, and some excellent kicking by
Angell, freshman fullback. The only
real opportunity the freshmen had
for a score was on an attempted goal
kick on a penalty by Needham. The
angle was difficult, and tne Kick
failed.
From the first whistle from Referee
Lockliart Card in the second half, the
play seemed to go faster. The game
was opened up more to the backfields
and presented a better spectacle to
the bleachers. Lowell took the ball
away from the freshmen continually
in the scrum and consequently had
an advantage. With the 1920 team on
defense, the ball went from Adams to
Schaffer, to Turkington to Weil, who
went over for the lone try of the game.
The attempt at conversion failed.
Freshmen Display Comeback.
From this point on the freshmen
opened up and "showed more" than
they have displayed all season. With
Larkin, Barneson, Henry, Risling and
.loerg leading in offensive, the first
year aggregation swept Lowell ahead.
The final whistle found the teams
buttling in the center of the field and
for five minutes the freshmen kept
the ball in play in a vain effort to
tie or defeat the high school fifteen.
The ball finally went to touch on the
Lowel ten-yard line with the Stanford
team playing as it had not played
before this season. The lineups fol
low :
Stanford Freshmen —Wayland, Har
neson and Henry, (James), front
rank; Bowden and Martin, middle
rank; Snook, (Meyer), Toole and
Gardner, rear rank; Larkin, half;
Risling and .loerg, five-eighths;
Strong, (Angell), center-three; Need
