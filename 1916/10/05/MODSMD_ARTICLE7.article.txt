# "Get Started Right" Advises Staniford
## Action of Freshmen to Decide Fate of Honor System at Stanford 
### 
"Get going on the right foot, keep
out ol' all trouble, and do everything
in your power to cooperate with the
authorities of student government,"
were the words of Student Adviser
W. P. Staniford, ably seconded by W.
R. Wheatly of the Student Council,
to an assembly of freshmen held this
morning in the Little Theater.
Aside from the usual welcoming as
sembly to the new students, the gath
ering this morning was the first one
of its kind ever held on the campus.
The freshmen attended in full force,
the Little Theater being well filled.
The only speakers were Staniford and
Wheatly, but in well chosen words,
they expressed the hopes that the
University as a whole has for the
first year students.
Honor System Explained.
The honor system was explained in
detail, and the freshmen were instruc
ted in regard to the rules that affect
student government. The students
were not threatened, but were told
that the actions of the Student
Council were firm in dealing with
those that disobey the rules in the
little red book. Staniford stated that
it was expected that few of those
present would ever come in contact
with the ruling body of the Associ
ated Students, but that it was thought
wise "to pour a little oil on the ma
chinery of student government" and
stop trouble before it began.
Kiglit, for Right's Sake.
Wheatly spoke to quite an extent of
the spirit that freshmen should have,
and of the idea of mutual coopera
tion that should come with "getting
on the boat." As a final plea, the
men who will be the Stanford upper
classmen in two years, were asked to
do right for right's sake, to do right
because the Student Council and the
faculty expected it, and lastly to do
the right thing because that is the
way of a real Stanford man.

Final tryouts for the Mandolin
Club will be held in the band room
of the Engineering department to
night at 7:30. Anyone who can play
a stringed instrument of any kind is
eligible to try out. R. R. Coleman,
'18, leader of the club, and J. H. East
man, '18, business manager, are ar
ranging trips for the stringsters.
