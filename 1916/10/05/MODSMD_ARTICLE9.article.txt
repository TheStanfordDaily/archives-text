# DR. WILBUR BACK FROM ALUMNI VISIT
## 
### 
President Wilbur returned yester
day from visits to the Stockton and
Sacramento alumni this week-end.
Friday evening he attended a banquet
given in his honor by the Stanford
Club of Stockton at Hotel Clark, in
that city. It was on this occasion
that a misguided printer caused the
place cards to read "Complimentary
dinner to President Wheeler of Stan
ford University."
In the principal speech of the eve
ning, President Wilbur summarized
recent changes and improvements on
the "farm." George A. Ditz, '11,
president of the Stockton alumni, re
plied. Between fifty and sixty old
Stanford people were present.
Approximately ninety alumni were
present at the dinner given to Presi
dent Wilbur Saturday evening in Sac
ramento. A number of members of
the pioneer class were on hand to
bear Stanford's executive tell of the
progress of the University in the last
year. O. W. Newman, *13, president
of the Sacramento alumni, and Dr. H.
D. Lawhead, Cooper Medical School
'83, also spoke.
