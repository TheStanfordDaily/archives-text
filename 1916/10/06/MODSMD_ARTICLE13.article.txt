# THREE BATTLES ON FOOTBALL CARD SATURDAY
## VARSITY VS. Frosh meet Chico High; While Second Varsity Plays Sodality 
### 
Three speedy battles are promised
devotees of the rugby sport on the
card arranged for tomorrow by Grad
uate Manager Behrens. The opening
feature at 1:30 finds the Stanford
"babes" lining up against the stal
wart lads from Chico high school, fol
lowed immediately by the feature con
test with the Varsity slated to meet
the VVinged-0 men of San Francisco.
The closing feature is the match be
tween the Sodality Club of San Jose
and the second varsity, or "All-
Blacks," as the bleachers warmers
delight in calling them. In addition
to the afternoon features Oakland
high school will meet the third var
sity at 10 in the morning, and the
College of Pacific fifteen lines up
against the Palo Alto Athletic Club
team on the outside field during the
afternoon.
Few Varsity Changes.
Few changes will be noted in the
Varsity lineup from that of last week.
Pettingill returns to the his former
position at middle rank, while Win
ham is back again at breakaway. In
the backfield Wilkins is listed as sub
stitute to Frank Walker at half;
Wark is at first-five and Long at sec
ond, Lachmund being out of the game,
and Dievendorff is again playing wing.
Hale's Olympic Club aggregation will
again trot out on the field with prac
tically the same lineup that has here
tofore put up a hard struggle for vic
tory.
In the Sodality Club of San Jose, a
team composed of former Santa Clara
and San Jose rugby stars, the second
varsity will meet an able opponent.
In the game between these two teams
earlier in the season, the second var
sity captured a 6 to 3 victory after
two 30-minute halves of hard scrap
ping. The club men have had more
practice since then and expect to get
away with tomorrow's struggle. The
squad of 1920 will have the same lin
up as that of the mid-week game with
the one exception that "Red" Aubert
breaks back into the game at front
rank, having practically recovered
from his recent injury. In the Chico
high school fifteen they will run up
against one of the strongest high
school aggregations of Northern Cali
fornia, judging from the record of this
squad. The Chico boys arrived on
the campus today to look the field
over and be ready for the contest to
morrow.

Palmer Puller will handle the
whistle in the Varsity game, with
Pete Plannigan in charge of the fresh
men game. The official for the sec
ond varsity contest has not been se
cured as yet, but that someone com
petent will be on hand is assured.
Season tickets will secure admission 1
to the games, while 50 cents will be
the tax for those not possessing the
pasteboards.
