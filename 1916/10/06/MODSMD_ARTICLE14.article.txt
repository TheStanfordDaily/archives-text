# Stanford Soccerites and All-Stars Clash
## Cardinals With Strengthened Line-Up Expect to Gain Victory 
### 
With a much strengthened lineup the
Cardinal Varsity soccer team again
clashes with the All Stars on the
Stanford Held, at 3 o'clock, before
whom it went down to defeat two
weeks ago. The All Stars represent
a picked aggregation of former Stan
ford and California so'ccer players
and is managed by "Red" Reynolds,
an ex-captain of a Stanford soccer
team. In view of the showing made
last week in defeating the Olympic
Club, Captain Adams is confident that
the Cardinal eleven will triumph in
Saturday's contest. The Allies, the
forwards for which will be furnished
from Stanford second string men,
will meet the University of California
varsity on California field, Saturday
afternoon.
