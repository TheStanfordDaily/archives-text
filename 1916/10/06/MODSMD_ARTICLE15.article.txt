# Postpone Swiss Military System Vote Indefinitely
## 
### 
Because of the belief that the word
ing on the ballots sent out by the
Sacramento "Bee" calling for a vote
on the advisability of adopting the
Swiss military system in America is
unfair to the unprejudiced voter, the
poll of the student body which was an
nounced for this morning was indef
initely postponed. The newspaper
has been notified that the poll will
not be taken unless a different ballot
is used, and no action will be taken
until a reply is received. The ballots
are so worded that an affirmative vote
carries with it the approval of a num
ber of unrelated propositions.
