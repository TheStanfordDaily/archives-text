Ever since Adam was a boy, there
has existed a malady, one quite prev
alent and malicious, which physic
ians, despite collossal investigation
of mental and bodily ailments, evi
dently have overlooked. Germs of
this disease have become pregnant
on the campus until of late the fever
seemingly has assumed hypnotical
power. Over-confidence, rank self
sufficiency diluted with a blase in
terest have characterized the atmos
phere pervading Stanford's rugby
season.

If there be the tiniest grain of
truth in the old proverb—pride goeth
before a fall—the major body of Card
inal football fans, whether advocates
of one game or another, had best
prepare for bitter loss of self-esteem
and a fall that has no bottom, if the
spoils of the season go Santa Clara
way, due to the prevailing attitude of
self-satisfaction and overconfidence.

Reins of the rival rugby camps are

playing a genuine, fighting brand of
football; but the campus slumbers
with fatal egotism.
