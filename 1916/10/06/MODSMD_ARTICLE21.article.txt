# Stanford to Have Alcazar's Stage for Seven Keys
## 
### 
First steps to temporarily move
the stage of the Alcazar Theater of
San Francisco to the Stanford As
sembly Hall were taken this
morning when a truck load of
stage equipment arrived on the
Quad. Sword and Sandals has
undertaken to bring the Alcazar
stage to Stanford in order to as
sure a realistic and finished pro
duction of "Seven Keys to Bald
pate," which is due here one week
from tonight.
The Cohan comedy demands
more in the way of scenery than
the average college play. "Seven
Keys" was put on at the Alcazar
by the original company a year or
so ago, at which time a full stage
sotting was constructed.
Arrangements concluded with
the Alcazar company will bring
this set, as well as Alcazar car
penters, electricians, and stage
hands, to the Assembly Hall for
next Friday evening.
