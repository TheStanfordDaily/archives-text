### 
Ten men will represent the Cardinal
swimming team in a meet with the
Piedmont Athletic Club, which will
be held at Piedmont Baths in Oak
land, Saturday night. The Piedmont
Club has a strong combination of
swimmers this year, but with Ross
swimming for Stanford the odds seem
to be in favor of the Cardinal.
The events scheduled for the con
test include a 50-, 100-, 220-, and 440-
yard free stroke; a 220-yard breast
stroke, and a lofl-yard back stroke.
Each team will also enter a four-man
relay team.
The following ten men will make
the trip to Oakland tomorrow with
Instructor Brandsten: Ross, Pcnni
man. Green, Coonse, Stewart, McGaf
fey, Iredell, Balbach, Kahle and Ped
ley.
