# FIRE TAKES HOME OF ALPHA PHI SORORITY
## VANDALS MADE RAIDS Quick Action of Students Saves Total Destruction When Equipment Fails 
### 
Fire, plus water, coupled with in
adequate protection against blazes at
Stanford, routed members of the Alpha
Phi sorority from their home, Friday
night. What might have been but a
small blaze resulted in a five thous
and dollar Joss, when equipment fail
ed to appear on time.
Once bereft of their homes, Alpha
Phis were further depleted by van
dals posing as souvenir hunters. All
the campus is up in arms against a
small group who took advantage of
the situation to raid personal belong
ings. It is probable that culprits ap
prehended will be dealt with in a way
befitting the the cheapness of their
uncouth behavior.
All Might Have (turned.
The entire Alpha Phi house would
have burned to the ground had it not
been for the quick work of hundreds
of students who manned hoses, when
they did arrive, and who carried
everything from the house except
some trunks on the top lloor, in
which, unfortunately, were stored n
many winter garments of Alpha Phis.
Members 01 the sorority moved to
a Hini>orar\ home ir: Palo Alto, on
Forest and Webster streets, Satur
day. The Alpha Plii home will be off
the campus until next semester, it is
expected.
The Alpha Phi sorority members
owned the house in which they lived.
Losses in the building are fully, cov
ered by insurance and the burned
building will be repaired at once.
Practically no personal insurance was
carried by any of the members.
The Alpha Phi blaze started while
a dance was being held. G. J. Knight,
'19, passing the Alpha Phi house at
11 o'clock, Friday evening, noticed
the flames crackling from the roof,
while dancers stepped to the tune of
"Pretty Baby." He shouted a warn
ing, and the dance was forgotten as
men rushed from room to room,
throwing clothes, beds, bureaus, and
books from windows and down stairs.
While hordes of men brought hoses
into play, others rushed Alpha
Phi belongings to lawns and auto
mobiles. Fortunately, few things
were lost in the scramble, though a
small flock of barbarian souvenir
seekers had to be driven from the
scene of trouble.
Cause >'ot Certain.
How the Alpha Phi fire started is
not known for certain. Two theories
seem to stand: one that an electric
iron left burning started the blaze,
and a second that a defective flue
caused the conflagration.
Blame is fixed by some for the
huge loss on the Palo Alto Fire De
partment, which refused to allow
equipment to come to the campus
without permission from Chief Miller,
who could not be found. After delay
caused by red tape, Wallace Curtis,
'16, with other students, took the hose
cart without permission to the cam
pus.
Would Arrest Curtis.
Saturday, Palo Alto officers were
for arresting Curtis, but University
authorities prevented such procedure.
The Palo Alto officials claim they
were justified in refusing help, since
sending equipment from Palo Alto
leaves the city at the mercy of any
blaze that might spring up in its
absence.
Broke l'p Dances.
The conflagration broke up a num
ber of dances immediately, as men
rushed to the aid of the Alpha Phis,
and women hastened to provide shel
ter for the night for members of the
sorority. They were cared for in
various sorority houses.
Quick action by Stanford men, re
gardless of themselves, won much ad
miration. Many men fought the fire
in their ball room clothes, and were
drenched by water.
The greatest loss was from water,
many personal properties being
soaked through and through when
water ran through ceilings.
