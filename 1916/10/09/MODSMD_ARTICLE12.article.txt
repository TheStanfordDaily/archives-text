# FIRE TAKES HOME OF ALPHA PHI SORORITY
## VANDALS MADE RAIDS Quick Action of Students Saves Total Destruction When Equipment Fails 
### 
Fire, plus water, coupled with in
adequate protection against blazes at
Stanford, routed members of the Alpha
Phi sorority from their home, Friday
night. What might have been but a
small blaze resulted in a five thous
and dollar Joss, when equipment fail
ed to appear on time.
Once bereft of their homes, Alpha
Phis were further depleted by van
dals posing as souvenir hunters. All
the campus is up in arms against a
small group who took advantage of
the situation to raid personal belong
ings. It is probable that culprits ap
prehended will be dealt with in a way
befitting the the cheapness of their
uncouth behavior.
All Might Have (turned.
The entire Alpha Phi house would
have burned to the ground had it not
been for the quick work of hundreds
of students who manned hoses, when
they did arrive, and who carried
everything from the house except
some trunks on the top lloor, in
which, unfortunately, were stored n
many winter garments of Alpha Phis.
