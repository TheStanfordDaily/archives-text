Stanford Varsity, 39; Olympic
Club, 16.
Stanford Freshmen, 3G; Chico
High, 0.
Stanford Seconds, -'9; Sodality
Club, 0.

Stanford's rugby fifteens had added
three more scalps to their belts when
the final whistle blew on Saturday's
contests, the freshmen getting away
with the opener from tlie Chico High
lads, the Varsity conquering the
Winged "O" men of San Francisco,
and the second varsity walking away
from the Sodality Club fifteen of
Santa Clara. Several tilings were par
ticularly noticeable in Saturday's
play, first that the freshmen are a
much improved fifteen from that of
two weeks ago, second that there is
still room for improvement in the
varsity's tackling, and lastly, that the
Stanford forwards are improving in
their work each successive appear
ance.
Although the score at the end of
the first half of the Varsity struggle
was 13 to 8 in favor of the Varsity,
the honors of this half really belong
to the Olympic players, excellent pass
ing rushes by their backfield featur
ing. Stanford scored first blood when
Captain Joe Braden picked the ball
from the ruck near the Olympic ten
yard line and carried it over, Temple
ton converting. The clubmen came
right back and sensational runs by
Hale, Hanley, Urban, and Stevens
forced the ball near the Cardinal line,
where Joe Urban wiggled his way
