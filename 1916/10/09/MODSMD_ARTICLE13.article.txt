Stanford's rugby fifteens had added
three more scalps to their belts when
the final whistle blew on Saturday's
contests, the freshmen getting away
with the opener from tlie Chico High
lads, the Varsity conquering the
Winged "O" men of San Francisco,
and the second varsity walking away
from the Sodality Club fifteen of
Santa Clara. Several tilings were par
ticularly noticeable in Saturday's
play, first that the freshmen are a
much improved fifteen from that of
two weeks ago, second that there is
still room for improvement in the
varsity's tackling, and lastly, that the
Stanford forwards are improving in
their work each successive appear
ance.
Although the score at the end of
the first half of the Varsity struggle
was 13 to 8 in favor of the Varsity,
the honors of this half really belong
to the Olympic players, excellent pass
ing rushes by their backfield featur
ing. Stanford scored first blood when
Captain Joe Braden picked the ball
from the ruck near the Olympic ten
yard line and carried it over, Temple
ton converting. The clubmen came
right back and sensational runs by
Hale, Hanley, Urban, and Stevens
forced the ball near the Cardinal line,
where Joe Urban wiggled his way
across for their first try, Captain Hale
making a perfect conversion.
A few minutes later, Wieslander,
wing forward for the club men, suc
ceeded in carrying the ball over for a
second try, Hale failing the onver
sion. Stanford's Varsity now seemed
to come to life and rushed the ball to
the other end of the field, where Diev
endorff carried it over after receiving
a pass from Pettingill, Templeton
again converting. After ten minutes
of play, during which the ball see
sawed from one end of the field to
the other, Halsted crossed for the
final score of this half, conversion
failing.
Some sort of a change appeared to
have come over the Varsity between
halves, for this half was a walkaway
for the Cardinal boys, their backfield
showing exceptional ability. Immedi
ately following the kick-off, a light
ning pass from Walker, to Wark, to
Long, to Carroll, to Marriott, re
sulted in a try, which was converted.
Following this Captain Hale of the
Olympics succeeded in making a try,
which he converted. Stanford's next
score was rather a lucky one, for
Johnson fell on a loose ball over the
line, onversion of this failing. A start
ling run by Wark, with a pass to
Long, resulted in another Cardinal
score. Wilkins at half for Stanford
made the final Cardinal score, while
a successful penalty kick by Hale
the clubmen their last, making
the final sore 39 to 1(1.
Chico High proved to no match
or the freshmen in the curtain-raiser
of the day, the Stanford "babes" show
ing to the best advantage that they
have exhibited this season. Their
backfield work was of high grade
order, while the forwards excelled the
Chico scrum men. Angell, Joerg,
Gardner, Needham, and Risling, made
trys. Improvement in their defense
work was also noticeable from that of
the previous week.
In the last event of the day, play
was exceptionally snappy, but the
Stanford second string men proved too
strong for the Sodality fifteen. Roy
Needham, Meese, Mauser, Jel'fers, and
Flood succeeded in making the trys,
Bert West converting four of them.
