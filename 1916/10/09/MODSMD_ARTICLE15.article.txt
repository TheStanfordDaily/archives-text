# BLAZES AND BANDITS

### 
Friday evening's battle with the
flames, that augured total annilhila
tion of the Alpha Phi sorority house,
when valiant rescue service on the
part of the students managed to
dampen the ardor of the conflagra
tion, unearthed a pair of discrepan
cies, both of which are entitled to
serious consideration, —lire protection
and vandalism.

As seems almost the law of nature,
a community is want to let affairs take
their own course, hit or miss, trust
ing to the grace of providence, until
the serenity of their existence is in
terrupted by some straight-arm jolt
which sets minds to thinking and con
structing. Such is the case of Fri
day's fiasco, a loss that could have
been prevented by the innovation of
system and adequate facilities.

At present, fire defense is epitom
ized by the clang of bells, an army
of volunteers, and several feet of
hose —in truth, not a strictly modern
equipment. This was well illustrated
at the Alpha Phi fire, when looking
glasses and pictures were thrown out
of' second story windows, while pil
lows were carefully lugged down
stairs.
* * * *
Although the local water-bucket
brigade has had good fortune in the
past, in putting out dangerous blazes
and simultaneously saving the resi
dences threatened, inevitably the time
will come when an irreparable loss
will be experienced. Herein the au
thorities will find a wide pasture for
improvement.
* * * *
While credit must be bestowed upon
the unselfish fire-fighters of Friday
evening, at the same time a finger of
shame must be directed at those in
dividuals who committed acts of in
excusable vandalism and ungentle
manly conduct. Those who have
taken it upon themselves to intern
letters and property not theirs had
best return their ill-gotten spoils be
fore the storm breaks.
