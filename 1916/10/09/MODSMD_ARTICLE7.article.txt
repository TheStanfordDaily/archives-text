# BOSTON NOSES OUT BROOKLYN AFTER FOURTEEN FAST INNINGS
## 
### 
In one of the most sensational of
World's Series games, the Boston Red
Sox made it two straight for the 1916
title today, by nosing out the Brook
lyn Dodgers in a fourteen-inning
struggle, the final score tallying 2 to
1. Manager Robinson sprung a sur
prise by starting Smith in the box for
Brooklyn, and the big fellow twirled
a wonderful game, equalling the per
formance of the experienced Ruth, the
Hose dinger.
The two teams now journey to

Brooklyn, for two games, to be played
on Tuesday and Wednesday. Accord
ing to the National Commission, the
seat sale will break all existing rec
ords. Manager Robinson says that
his team still has the fighting spirit,
and are confident, although they real
ize that the Boston aggregation has
a decided advantage. Coombs will be
the pitching selection for tomorrow's
game, while it is expected that Leon
ard will twirl for the Red Sox.
