by the Sacramento "Bee," will he held
Wednesday, in the morning classes
Upon being advised that the students
would not be asked to vote on the bal
lots received last week, the "Bee"
sent new ballots, much simpler in
form and containing 110 objectionable
or unfair propositions.

The wording 011 the new ballots is
as follows: "Are you an advocate of
National legislation which will make
| all young men. physically and men
; tally fit, liable for military training
before reaching the age of twentv-one,
i on the model of the Swiss system of
devoting a slight period during youth,
or legislation along these lines as
I adapted to conditions in this country
! with advice of the General Staff of
I the Army? Vote yes or no."
