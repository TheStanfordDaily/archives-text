# FRESHMEN AND "PALLY" MEET IN LAST GAME
## TO PLAY TOMORROW Preliminary Contest Will Give Fans a Line on Final '20 Aggregation 
### 
Palo Alto high school and the Stan
ford freshmen will furnish the mid
week football spectacle for the local
followers of the pigskin sport. The
contest is important for a number of
reasons. It is the last practice game
for the Cardinal players before the
intercollegiate contest with the first
year team of the University of Santa
Clara. The lineup that will he used
in the banner game next Saturday
will be the same as that used 011 Wed
nesday, unless something unforseen
takes place in the rugby camp.
Therefore the bleacherites can get a
line on the composition of the 1920
official aggregation.
Third Uanie Willi "Pally."
This is the third and last time that
"Pally" and the freshmen will en
deavor to smear each other this sea
son. This fact gives the game added
interest for the many rooters who
will journey from Palo Alto to the
campus to see the high school fifteen
work out. Coach Brown has appar
ently been very undecided as to the
best placing of the freshmen players,
and has been continually shifting the
lineup to get better results. It will
be interesting to note the final decis
ion as to the positions that some of
the "babes" are to play, and it is ex
pected that the bleachers will be well
