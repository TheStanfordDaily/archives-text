# STUDENTS TO VOTE ON SWISS MILITARY PLAN IN CLASSES TOMORROW
## 
### 
In order that every student in the
University may have an opportunity
to vote on the advisability of adopt
ing the Swiss military system in the
United States, extra ballots will be on
hand in the Student Adviser's office
tomorrow, in addition to those issued
to most of the departments.
Time for balloting will be allowed
in most of the morning classes, but
in case any student does not have an
opportunity to express, his views on
the Swiss military question, he can
do so at the Student Adviser's office
between 10 and 12 in the morning or
2 to 3 in the afternoon.
This straw vote is being taken by
the Sacramento Bee, and was post
poned from last week in order to
simplify the ballots and remove ob
jectionable and unfair propositions
from them.
