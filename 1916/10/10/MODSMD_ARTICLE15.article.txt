# BURSTED BUBBLES
## 
### 
Judging from bits of campus gossip
that roam around uncorraled, Doctor
Wilbur should be regarded as the
traditional bugaboo with the fraterni
ties acting the part of balking and
abused objects of attack. Imagina
tion stretched a little farther would
picture the Greek letter societies in
the role of St. George swinging, a
spiked club in wait for the President's
evil onslaught.

Misunderstanding always was the
root of a whole lot of unnecessary
misfortune, which if allowed to con
tinue, like weeds in a garden, causes
chaos out of a perfect serenity. Sen
timent at present prevails that Doc
tor Wilbur is rabidly opposed to fra
ternities, regarding the institution as
some malevolent malady which must
be eradicated. Those entertaining
this opinion never attempt to scratch
beneath the surface of a rumor, but
rather content to amuse themselves
with self-compassion.

Evident interpretation of the Presi
dent's letters dispatched to fraterni
ties, renders plain the fact that they
are not in the nature of a Wilson
note, but anticipate definite results.
Scholarship must be raised to nor
mal —no affliction for university stu
dents. Again, the requirement is
made that inside of two years all
long suffering debt shall bo wiped off
the slate. Seemingly neither of these
ultimatums, if one wishes to title
them, steps on anyone's toes or vio
lates the principles of the ten com
mandments.

With these difficulties rectified, the
President comes out flatly with the
statement, that he believes fraterni
ties have their place on the campus.
Tomorrow evening the opportunity
will be afforded those interested in
the supposed controversy to meet
with Dr. Wilbur and ascertain the ac
tual status of the situation. Those
who expect a verdict in the first de
gree will find a bursted bubble, while
others aiming at reform legislation
may acquire a broader angle.
