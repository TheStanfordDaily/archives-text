# FULLER REFEREE FOR FROSH GAME
## All Santa Clara Coming to Farm Saturday—-Admission to Be Fifty Cents 
### 
W. Palmer Fuller will referee the
intercollegiate football game between
the Stanford freshmen and the first
year team of the University of Santa
Clara, to be played on the Cardinal
I turf next Saturday. This conclusion
was reached at a meeting of the ath
letic committees of the two universi
ties, held yesterday afternoon. The
( question of who would handle the con
test has been an important one for
the past few weeks and has been
more or less of an issue between the
rival camps. Fuller satisfies both
teams and will undoubtedly keep the
•play moving fast, and give both fif
teens an even break.
Season tickets will not be honored
for admission to the game. Graduate
Manager Behrens announces that the
admission price will be fifty cents anil
the tickets will be sold at the gate.
The contest will be started at 3
o'clock, being preceded by a game be
tween San Jose high school and Low
ell high school, and followed by fifty
minutes of rugby between the third
varsity and the Stockton high school
fifteen.
Santa Clara will come to the game
in a special train and will bring a
host of rooters. A baud will also ac
company the students and supporters
of the Catholic college, while their
yell leader announces that a rooting
section has been organized, and that
they feel confident of surpassing Stan
ford in bleacher activities.
Stanford will occupy the northern
side of the bleachers, as is the case
in all intercollegiate contests played
on the Cardinal field. The Santa
Clara delegation will use the south
ern end of the bleachers, having the
advantage of the sun being at their
backs. Blocks of tickets are being
sold in the Mission Town, thus as
suring a large visiting crowd.
In addition to the Santa Clara root
ers, the San Jose high school is plan
ning on making Saturday a big day.
The Junior Chamber of Commerce of
that institution is handling all ar
rangements, and will bring up some
five hundred followers of the high
school team. Lowell has also asked
tliat the Graduate Manager reserve
some seats for students of that school
who will accompany the team to Stan
ford. The preliminary game should
be a close and exciting contest, as
both teams have a good record so
far this season. It is slated to start
promptly at 1:30, with "Ric" Temple
ton handling the whistle.
