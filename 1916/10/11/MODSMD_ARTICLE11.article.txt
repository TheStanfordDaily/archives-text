# Palace Hotel Again Big Game Rendevous
## Graduate Manager Plans Dinner Dance for Cardinals After Game 
### 
Stanford students and friends will
again make the Palace Hotel their
headquarters for the big game with
Santa Clara in San Francisco, No
vember 11. According to the plans now
being formulated by Graduate Man
ager Behrens, a dinner dance will
probably be held this year similar to
that held last year. Invitations have
already been sent to former noted
Stanford entertainers, and on hearing
from them a definite program will be
arranged.
At present, the holding of a Stan
lord smoker in San Francisco the
night before the game, is also being
considered. Something of this sort
would undoubtedly prove very pop
ular. Decision as to this pre-game
festivity will be made in a short time.
