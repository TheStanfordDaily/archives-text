# Dr. Frank Angell to Address Local Belgian Workers
## 
### 
Dr. Frank Angell will address the
Stanford-Palo Alto Belgian Relief
Commission next Sunday afternoon, at
the Marker School, in Palo Alto. Gen
eral interest aroused by Dr. Angell's
talk at the assembly two weeks ago
on the same subject lias convinced the
local Belgian committee that many
residents of the surrounding com
munities would welcome a chance to
hear him again.
Dr. Angell's talk will include the
main points of his assembly speech,
with the addition of a number of per
sonal experiences which were omitted
a week ago Thursday, because he
lacked the time to touch on them.
A fifty-cent general admission will
be charged and the proceeds will go
to the local fund of the Commission
for Belgian Relief.
