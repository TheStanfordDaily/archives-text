# Jay Risling Injured in Automobile Crash
## 
### 
Jay M. Risling, '20, had his ankle
broken in an automobile accident last
night at 6:10. Risling is one of the
most clever players on the '20 rugby
team, and since his injury will keep
him out of the freshmen big game,
Saturday, the chances for a Cardinal
victory will be lessened.
Auto Hits Bicycle.
Risling was riding to his home in
Palo Alto on his bicycle after foot
ball practice, when an automobile,
coming around a corner, hit him
squarely. His wheel was completely
demolished and he was thrown over
the fender of the car. The two occu
pants of the car, William Laugenour
and Fred Chamarouv, both of Man
zanita school, were scratched up bad
ly, Laugenour being cut over one eye
so that it was necessary to take sev
eral stitches in the wound.
The bones of Risling's ankle arc
broken and his foot and leg badly
damaged, so there is no hope that he
will get in Saturday's game.
