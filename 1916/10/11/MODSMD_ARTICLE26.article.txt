# Varsity Swimmers to Meet Freshmen
## First Year Tank Men Expected to Give Veterans Hard Competition 
### 
The Stanford varsity swimmers will
clash with the freshman aggregation
Friday. This contest was previously
scheduled for last week, but was post
poned untfl the coming Friday.
The first year men seem to have
the edge on the veterans, with Ross,
holder of the coast record and ac
knowledged as one of the best swim
mers of the present clay, and' Balbach,
holder of the fancy diving champion
ship of thr, San Francisco exhibition.
Stewart, Green, and Considine, of the
class of '20, will also have to be reck
oned with in the final summary.
Pedley, Goldsmith, Penniman, Ire
dell, McGaffney, Wickersham, Mont
gomery and Ford form the backbone
of the varsity squad. The four-man re
lay team to represent the varsity in a
100-yard race with the first year men,
will be picked from Penniman, Gold
smith, Iredell, McGaffney, and Ford.
The freshmen quartette will be chosen
from Ross, Considine, Balbach, Green,
and Stewart. A very close contest is
expected.
The possibility of a new tank rec
ord for the 100-yard back stroke event
will add interest to the meet. Ross,
who has been swimming the back
stroke race in excellent form, will
attempt to better the existing record
of 1:16 2-5, held by Buckland. An
other special feature will be a 220-
yard novice race for those who will
not swim in the meet.
In all, seven events have been plan
ned for the dual contest between the
varsity aquatic stars and the fresh
men, besides the relay. These events
include a 50-. 100-, and 220-yard free
style dash; a 100-yard back stroke,
and a 220-yard breast stroke race, and
a fancy diving competition from the
springboard.
