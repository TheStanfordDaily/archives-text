# Campus Makes . . Movie Debut . . Via Aeroplane

### 
Stanford University unconsciously
broke into the movies this afternoon
when Frank Bryant, instructor in the
Christofferson School of Aviation,
piloted an areoplane carrying a
Hearst photo service camera man over
the campus.
The movies from the sky have been
planned for some time, but the rainy
weather has prevented snapshots
from above during the past week.
Today was the first clear day for the
films.
The aviator and his camera man
companion arrived in Stanford atmos
phere at 1:30 this afternoon, coming
from the northwest. Circling over
the Row, the Quad, and the Arbor
etum, the biplane shot back toward
the school in Redwood.
