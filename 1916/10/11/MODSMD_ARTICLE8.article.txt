# REFEREE PROBLEM FOR 1920 GAME IN AIR
## MAY NOT BE FULLER Santa Clara Bringing Rooters and Band to Aid "Babes" Conquer 
### 
Although the referee question for
the Stanford-Santa Clara freshmen
was thought to have been thorough
ly threshed out and Palmer Fuller de
cided upon, Santa Clara athletic bod
ies have had many objections from
their alumni, owing to the fact that
Fuller is a former Stanford man, a
thing which they do not think advis
able in an intercollegiate contest.
Owing to the fact that Fuller has al
ready been asked to officiate, he may
do so yet, but this has not been fully
agreed to by Santa Clara. Fuller,
Pete Flannigan, and von Monderscheid
are the men now under consideration.
Tonight will see the question finally
decided.
Varsity vs. P. A. A. ('.
Stanford varsity will play Saturday
at 4:150 against the Palo Alto Athletic
Club fifteen. The third varsity will
meet the Stockton high school rugby
lads at 10 o'clock Saturday morning,
instead of 4:30, as originally planned.
Lowell High vs San Jose High will be
the curtain-raiser of Saturday after
noon, and will provide a fast game.
Santa Clarans are coming to the
campus Saturday confident that their
first year men will capture the strug
gle. A special train is to bring their
rooters and band. Stanford should
have a large crowd of rooters on
hand for the 3920 boys, and Yell
Leader Clilroy desires the north
bleachers filled with supporters.
Stanford's second varsity will play
College of Pacific squad at San Jose
on Friday afternoon. This game is
being held on Friday so that the boys
can be on hand to witness the fresh
men game here on Saturday.
