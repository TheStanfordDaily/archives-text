# Freshmen Fifteens Await Final Game
## STANFORD TEAM WORK TO BE MATCHED AGAINST THAT OF STARS 
### 
Rival football coaches, Floyd
Brown of Stanford and Charlie Aus
tin of Santa Clara, today announced
the personnel of the two freshmen
teams that will line up on the Card
inal turf next Saturday afternoon.
Many surprises and eleventh-hour
changes were sprung by the two men
who control the destinies of the op
posing fifteens, but in the main, the
lineups are identical with those put
down in the "dopesters* book" several
days ago.
BOTH TEAMS HAVE MEN
ON INJURED LIST
The Santa Clara lineup was chosen
after a hard scrimmage with the var
sity, while the Cardinal fifteen was
selected after the sad tryout of yes
terday afternoon against Palo Alto
high school. Charlie Austin expressed
himself as being perfectly satisfied
with his aggregation, all the men be
ing in excellent shape, with the ex
ception of Howell, varsity front
ranker, who sprained an ankle Sun
day. Coach Brown is hardly as well
pleased with the recent showing of
the freshmen, but stated that he be
lieved that with Risling in the lineup,
he would have had a fifteen that would
win from Santa Clara.
CARDINAL TEAMS ALWAYS
COME THROUGH
Risling is out of the game, and
Larkin is not in the best of shape.
This would seem to be enough to
completely demoralize the backfield
combination of the first year team,
but previous experience has shown
that Stanford rugby teams "come
through" when an intercollegiate
struggle is at stake. The freshmen
have played all sorts of football this
season, good, bad, and indifferent, and
there now seems to be an excellent
chance that the squad will pull itself
together and hold the heavy Santa
Clara delegation.
Wayland, Barneson, and Aubert
form a fighting trio in the front rank,
and with Henry substituting, the
j Stanford team should feel confident
of getting the ball at a "fifty-fifty
percentage" in the scrums. Milling
ton and Martin should hold up the
middle rank, and according to early
season playing should do well in the
banner contest. As a substitute,
Bowden will be on the lines to go in
as needed. The rear rank finds a
formidable combination in Snook, Til
ton, and Gardner. These three men
have held their own against strong
competition, and will undoubtedly
show up well. Myers and McCartney
will substitute these positions,
"HUD" LARKIN WILL HELP
FRESHMEN SCORE
"Bud" Larkin will again don a rugby
suit, tape up his badly sprained ankle,
and take his position behind the
freshman scrum. Larkin is a flashy
half back, and regardless of late in
juries, will be one of the danger
points for the "Missionit.es" to guard
against. Strain, who has held down
the full back berth consistently this
season, will substitute Larkin at half.
Risling's place will be filled by mov
ing in the backfield one notch, .Toerg
