# Freshmen Fifteens Await Final Game
## STANFORD TEAM WORK TO BE MATCHED AGAINST THAT OF STARS 
### 
Rival football coaches, Floyd
Brown of Stanford and Charlie Aus
tin of Santa Clara, today announced
the personnel of the two freshmen
teams that will line up on the Card
inal turf next Saturday afternoon.
Many surprises and eleventh-hour
changes were sprung by the two men
who control the destinies of the op
posing fifteens, but in the main, the
lineups are identical with those put
down in the "dopesters* book" several
days ago.
BOTH TEAMS HAVE MEN
ON INJURED LIST
The Santa Clara lineup was chosen
after a hard scrimmage with the var
sity, while the Cardinal fifteen was
selected after the sad tryout of yes
terday afternoon against Palo Alto
high school. Charlie Austin expressed
himself as being perfectly satisfied
with his aggregation, all the men be
ing in excellent shape, with the ex
ception of Howell, varsity front
ranker, who sprained an ankle Sun
day. Coach Brown is hardly as well
pleased with the recent showing of
the freshmen, but stated that he be
lieved that with Risling in the lineup,
he would have had a fifteen that would
win from Santa Clara.
CARDINAL TEAMS ALWAYS
COME THROUGH
Risling is out of the game, and
Larkin is not in the best of shape.
This would seem to be enough to
completely demoralize the backfield
combination of the first year team,
but previous experience has shown
that Stanford rugby teams "come
through" when an intercollegiate
struggle is at stake. The freshmen
have played all sorts of football this
season, good, bad, and indifferent, and
there now seems to be an excellent
chance that the squad will pull itself
together and hold the heavy Santa
Clara delegation.
Wayland, Barneson, and Aubert
form a fighting trio in the front rank,
and with Henry substituting, the
j Stanford team should feel confident
of getting the ball at a "fifty-fifty
percentage" in the scrums. Milling
ton and Martin should hold up the
middle rank, and according to early
season playing should do well in the
banner contest. As a substitute,
Bowden will be on the lines to go in
as needed. The rear rank finds a
formidable combination in Snook, Til
ton, and Gardner. These three men
have held their own against strong
competition, and will undoubtedly
show up well. Myers and McCartney
will substitute these positions,
"HUD" LARKIN WILL HELP
FRESHMEN SCORE
"Bud" Larkin will again don a rugby
suit, tape up his badly sprained ankle,
and take his position behind the
freshman scrum. Larkin is a flashy
half back, and regardless of late in
juries, will be one of the danger
points for the "Missionit.es" to guard
against. Strain, who has held down
the full back berth consistently this
season, will substitute Larkin at half.
Risling's place will be filled by mov
ing in the backfield one notch, .Toerg
filling the first five-eighths position,
with Angell receiving the passes at
second-five. Strong will be matched
against the fast Santa Clara center
three-quarter man, while Needham
and Rogers will handle the wings.
Campbell completes the lineup at
full back, with Cass on the sidelines
as his substitute.
Taken as a team, the Stanford
freshmen compare favorably with their
opponents. They have played many
games this year, and have developed
a semblance of teamwork. This has
been broken up somewhat by unfor
tunate accidents, but the men know
each other, and are accustomed to
playing side, by side. In this respect,
the Cardinals have an advantage over
Santa Clara, a team of stars, var
sity men, second varsity players, and
the pick of the left-overs. The op
posing squad has been together only
on paper, and for one final scrim
mage with what was left of the Mis
sion Town varsity after the freshmen
were eliminated. O'Neil, Muldoon,
Don, Dincini, Desmond, McKenzie,
Berndt. and Leßourveau are all play
ers of tried ability, and will make I
their presence felt against Stanford.
Howell is a star of the first rank, and
his loss will be a" big handicap to the
visiting fifteen, but this in a way,
balances the Stanford misfortune in
connection with Risling.
Roth teams will rest on Friday, the
final workout being this afternoon.
The Santa Clara team will come to
Palo Alto ahead of the special train
that will bring the visiting rooters.
They will have lunch on the campus,
and Immediately go to the training
quarters, where Coach Austin will is
sue his final instructions. Following
the preliminary game between Lowell
and San .Tose high schools, both the
Stanford and Santa Clara fifteens will
come on the field. The time of the
halves, and the kick-off, will be set
tled just prior to the game, the for
mer by the captains, who will be
elected in the training quarters be
fore the starting whistle blows, and
the latter by the toss of a coin.

show up well. Myers and McCartney
will substitute these positions,
"HUD" LARKIN WILL HELP
FRESHMEN SCORE
"Bud" Larkin will again don a rugby
suit, tape up his badly sprained ankle,
and take his position behind the
freshman scrum. Larkin is a flashy
half back, and regardless of late in
juries, will be one of the danger
points for the "Missionit.es" to guard
against. Strain, who has held down
the full back berth consistently this
season, will substitute Larkin at half.
Risling's place will be filled by mov
ing in the backfield one notch, .Toerg
filling the first five-eighths position,
with Angell receiving the passes at
second-five. Strong will be matched
against the fast Santa Clara center
three-quarter man, while Needham
and Rogers will handle the wings.
Campbell completes the lineup at
full back, with Cass on the sidelines
as his substitute.
Taken as a team, the Stanford
freshmen compare favorably with their
opponents. They have played many
games this year, and have developed
a semblance of teamwork. This has
been broken up somewhat by unfor
tunate accidents, but the men know
each other, and are accustomed to
playing side, by side. In this respect,
the Cardinals have an advantage over
Santa Clara, a team of stars, var
sity men, second varsity players, and
the pick of the left-overs. The op
posing squad has been together only
on paper, and for one final scrim
mage with what was left of the Mis
sion Town varsity after the freshmen
were eliminated. O'Neil, Muldoon,
Don, Dincini, Desmond, McKenzie,
Berndt. and Leßourveau are all play
ers of tried ability, and will make I
their presence felt against Stanford.
Howell is a star of the first rank, and
his loss will be a" big handicap to the
visiting fifteen, but this in a way,
balances the Stanford misfortune in
connection with Risling.
Roth teams will rest on Friday, the
final workout being this afternoon.
The Santa Clara team will come to
Palo Alto ahead of the special train
that will bring the visiting rooters.
They will have lunch on the campus,
and Immediately go to the training
quarters, where Coach Austin will is
sue his final instructions. Following
the preliminary game between Lowell
and San .Tose high schools, both the
Stanford and Santa Clara fifteens will
come on the field. The time of the
halves, and the kick-off, will be set
tled just prior to the game, the for
mer by the captains, who will be
elected in the training quarters be
fore the starting whistle blows, and
the latter by the toss of a coin.
Rival football coaches, Floyd
Brown of Stanford and Charlie Aus
tin of Santa Clara, today announced
the personnel of the two freshmen
teams that will line up on the Card
inal turf next Saturday afternoon.
Many surprises and eleventh-hour
changes were sprung by the two men
who control the destinies of the op
posing fifteens, but in the main, the
lineups are identical with those put
down in the "dopesters* book" several
days ago.
BOTH TEAMS HAVE MEN
ON INJURED LIST
The Santa Clara lineup was chosen
after a hard scrimmage with the var
sity, while the Cardinal fifteen was
selected after the sad tryout of yes
terday afternoon against Palo Alto
high school. Charlie Austin expressed
himself as being perfectly satisfied
with his aggregation, all the men be
ing in excellent shape, with the ex
ception of Howell, varsity front
ranker, who sprained an ankle Sun
day. Coach Brown is hardly as well
pleased with the recent showing of
the freshmen, but stated that he be
lieved that with Risling in the lineup,
he would have had a fifteen that would
win from Santa Clara.
CARDINAL TEAMS ALWAYS
COME THROUGH
Risling is out of the game, and
Larkin is not in the best of shape.
This would seem to be enough to
completely demoralize the backfield
combination of the first year team,
but previous experience has shown
that Stanford rugby teams "come
through" when an intercollegiate
struggle is at stake. The freshmen
have played all sorts of football this
season, good, bad, and indifferent, and
there now seems to be an excellent
chance that the squad will pull itself
together and hold the heavy Santa
Clara delegation.
Wayland, Barneson, and Aubert
form a fighting trio in the front rank,
and with Henry substituting, the
j Stanford team should feel confident
of getting the ball at a "fifty-fifty
percentage" in the scrums. Milling
ton and Martin should hold up the
middle rank, and according to early
season playing should do well in the
banner contest. As a substitute,
Bowden will be on the lines to go in
as needed. The rear rank finds a
formidable combination in Snook, Til
ton, and Gardner. These three men
have held their own against strong
competition, and will undoubtedly
show up well. Myers and McCartney
will substitute these positions,

Rival football coaches, Floyd
Brown of Stanford and Charlie Aus
tin of Santa Clara, today announced
the personnel of the two freshmen
teams that will line up on the Card
inal turf next Saturday afternoon.
Many surprises and eleventh-hour
changes were sprung by the two men
who control the destinies of the op
posing fifteens, but in the main, the
lineups are identical with those put
down in the "dopesters* book" several
days ago.
BOTH TEAMS HAVE MEN
ON INJURED LIST
The Santa Clara lineup was chosen
after a hard scrimmage with the var
sity, while the Cardinal fifteen was
selected after the sad tryout of yes
terday afternoon against Palo Alto
high school. Charlie Austin expressed
himself as being perfectly satisfied
with his aggregation, all the men be
ing in excellent shape, with the ex
ception of Howell, varsity front
ranker, who sprained an ankle Sun
day. Coach Brown is hardly as well
pleased with the recent showing of
the freshmen, but stated that he be
lieved that with Risling in the lineup,
he would have had a fifteen that would
win from Santa Clara.
CARDINAL TEAMS ALWAYS
COME THROUGH
Risling is out of the game, and
Larkin is not in the best of shape.
This would seem to be enough to
completely demoralize the backfield
combination of the first year team,
but previous experience has shown
that Stanford rugby teams "come
through" when an intercollegiate
struggle is at stake. The freshmen
have played all sorts of football this
season, good, bad, and indifferent, and
there now seems to be an excellent
chance that the squad will pull itself
together and hold the heavy Santa
Clara delegation.
Wayland, Barneson, and Aubert
form a fighting trio in the front rank,
and with Henry substituting, the
j Stanford team should feel confident
of getting the ball at a "fifty-fifty
percentage" in the scrums. Milling
ton and Martin should hold up the
middle rank, and according to early
season playing should do well in the
banner contest. As a substitute,
Bowden will be on the lines to go in
as needed. The rear rank finds a
formidable combination in Snook, Til
ton, and Gardner. These three men
have held their own against strong
competition, and will undoubtedly
show up well. Myers and McCartney
will substitute these positions,
"HUD" LARKIN WILL HELP
FRESHMEN SCORE
"Bud" Larkin will again don a rugby
suit, tape up his badly sprained ankle,
and take his position behind the
freshman scrum. Larkin is a flashy
half back, and regardless of late in
juries, will be one of the danger
points for the "Missionit.es" to guard
against. Strain, who has held down
the full back berth consistently this
season, will substitute Larkin at half.
Risling's place will be filled by mov
ing in the backfield one notch, .Toerg
filling the first five-eighths position,
with Angell receiving the passes at
second-five. Strong will be matched
against the fast Santa Clara center
three-quarter man, while Needham
and Rogers will handle the wings.
Campbell completes the lineup at
full back, with Cass on the sidelines
as his substitute.
Taken as a team, the Stanford
freshmen compare favorably with their
opponents. They have played many
games this year, and have developed
a semblance of teamwork. This has
been broken up somewhat by unfor
tunate accidents, but the men know
each other, and are accustomed to
playing side, by side. In this respect,
the Cardinals have an advantage over
Santa Clara, a team of stars, var
sity men, second varsity players, and
the pick of the left-overs. The op
posing squad has been together only
on paper, and for one final scrim
mage with what was left of the Mis
sion Town varsity after the freshmen
were eliminated. O'Neil, Muldoon,
Don, Dincini, Desmond, McKenzie,
Berndt. and Leßourveau are all play
ers of tried ability, and will make I
their presence felt against Stanford.
Howell is a star of the first rank, and
his loss will be a" big handicap to the
visiting fifteen, but this in a way,
balances the Stanford misfortune in
connection with Risling.
Roth teams will rest on Friday, the
final workout being this afternoon.
The Santa Clara team will come to
Palo Alto ahead of the special train
that will bring the visiting rooters.
They will have lunch on the campus,
and Immediately go to the training
quarters, where Coach Austin will is
sue his final instructions. Following
the preliminary game between Lowell
and San .Tose high schools, both the
Stanford and Santa Clara fifteens will
come on the field. The time of the
halves, and the kick-off, will be set
tled just prior to the game, the for
mer by the captains, who will be
elected in the training quarters be
fore the starting whistle blows, and
the latter by the toss of a coin.
