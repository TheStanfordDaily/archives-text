# PLAINTIVE PULING
## 
### 
After a strenuous six-weeks' stretch
Df scrums and passing rushes, Coaches
\ustin and Brown have announced
he personnel of their baby squads
which lock horns Saturday afternoon
in the first freshman intercollegiate
tangle ever scheduled between Santa
Clara and Stanford. Possum rooters,
self-styled Cardinal fans, but in real
ity excellent material for Sabbath
Bible sessions in a decrepit theolog
ical seminary, should be effectively
shocked out of their unfathomable
inertia by present prognostications.

Without consultation of star-gazers,
mind-readers, or fortune tellers, any
plebian bleaclierite may safely fore
cast a hot battle sprinkled with thrills
and heartaches. Football experts and
dope-sheet compilers pretty generally
agree that the mission town first year
ruggers have a favorable balance of
points. If the Stanford rooting sec
tion displays that same undertaker
convention enthusiasm that has char
acterized their support in the past,
the verdict will be a mere matter of
formality.
Tonight, while the small-black is
being passed around, Cardinal fans
might open fire by singing bleacher
songs and practicing a few of the
yells to which they are now strangers.
Freshmen should be well versed pre
vious to Saturday in all knowledge
necessary to formation of a success
ful rooting section. This week will
sound the opening gun for that in
itiation of a unified, consistent and
impetuous ardor which should boom
the season to the final whistle of
the big game on November 11. And
while we are rantingâ€”here's a hand
shake of congratulation to the mem
bers of the Twenty football team, and
a smile of appreciation for those who
just missed their goal.
