# Come-Back in Last Half Defeats Frosh
## Palo Alto High Players Win By Sensational Spurt With 18 to 17 Score 
### 
After showing symptoms of at least
a little knowledge of rugby, in the
first half of the final practice game
played with the Palo Alto high school
fifteen yesterday afternoon on the
Cardinal turf, the Stanford freshmen
blew up, in the second period, and
were played off their feet, being de
feated by an 18 to 17 score.
Larkin and Kisling Out.
Weakened by the absence of two of
the team's star players, Larkin and
ltisling, the Stanford "babes" looked
to be disorganized from the first.
Fast playing, combined with more
"pep" than the fifteen has shown tor
considerable time, gave them an early
lead, and the contest had the appear
ance of a walkaway. During the first
half, Barneson, Gardner, Needham,
and Strong went across for trys, while
Angell added three points by drop
kicking a goal on a penalty, and
Needham converted one of the scores.
Nagel made the only touch for Palo
Alto, converting from an easy angle.
The half ended with Stanford lead
ing, 17 to 5.
Substitutes Play Second Half.
Coach Brown sent the team on the
field for the second half with many
substitutes in the lineup, presumably
to give them a final once-over before
choosing the fifteen to meet Santa
Clara. Either the new men slowed the
team up and took all the fight out of
it, or "Pally" played with renewed
vigor. At any rate, there was a de
cided change, and from a procession,
with the freshmen taking the ball
over regularly, the contest reversed
itself, the high school players having
their older opponents on the run dur
ing the greater part of the final half.
Green scored three trials and con
verted two of the trys.
"Pally" Shows ( lass.
The bleachers were in sympathy
with the freshmen and never lost
confidence in their ability to pull the
game out of the fire, and maintain the
lead gained early in the contest.
There were few, however, who were
not stirred by the brand of football
that Palo Alto was displaying. Pass
ing rushes in which five or six men
would handle the ball were frequent,
and the younger team featured by
long ground-gaining kicks.
Game May lie llunoli.
Many believe that the result of the
! game will mean the same to the fresh
men that the holding of an old liorse
(shoe does for some people. It is
thought that the set-back will serve
as a lesson, and that the first year
team will pull together and show all
they have in the game next Saturday.
During the whole season, the 1920
aggregation has played inconsistently,
showing a flash at times, and then
again acting as if the individual play
! ers were tied down. Saturday may
lie one of the flashy days. Figuring
on yesterday's play, the squad is past
due.
The lineups follow:
Freshmen —Wayland, (Henry), Bar
neson and Aubert, front rank; Mill
i ington, (.ranies"), and Martin, (Bow
jden), middle rank; Snook, (Myers),
Tilton, (Toole), and Gardner, (Mc-
Cartney), rear rank; Strain, half;
Joerg, (Havis), and Angell, five
eighths; Strong, center-three; Need
ham and Cass. (Rogers), wings; and
Campbell, (Cass), full.
Palo Alto High School —Owen and
ITolsten, front, rank; Clark, lock;
Clark, G., and Collier, breakaways;
Schnell and Meyers, rear rank; Pat
rick, wing forward; Brown, half;
Nagel and Shone, five-eighths; Green,
G., center-three; Woodard and Scho
fleld, wings; and Green, T., full.

cided change, and from a procession,
with the freshmen taking the ball
over regularly, the contest reversed
itself, the high school players having
their older opponents on the run dur
ing the greater part of the final half.
Green scored three trials and con
verted two of the trys.
"Pally" Shows ( lass.
The bleachers were in sympathy
with the freshmen and never lost
confidence in their ability to pull the
game out of the fire, and maintain the
lead gained early in the contest.
There were few, however, who were
not stirred by the brand of football
that Palo Alto was displaying. Pass
ing rushes in which five or six men
would handle the ball were frequent,
and the younger team featured by
long ground-gaining kicks.
Game May lie llunoli.
Many believe that the result of the
! game will mean the same to the fresh
men that the holding of an old liorse
(shoe does for some people. It is
thought that the set-back will serve
as a lesson, and that the first year
team will pull together and show all
they have in the game next Saturday.
During the whole season, the 1920
aggregation has played inconsistently,
showing a flash at times, and then
again acting as if the individual play
! ers were tied down. Saturday may
lie one of the flashy days. Figuring
on yesterday's play, the squad is past
due.
The lineups follow:
Freshmen —Wayland, (Henry), Bar
neson and Aubert, front rank; Mill
i ington, (.ranies"), and Martin, (Bow
jden), middle rank; Snook, (Myers),
Tilton, (Toole), and Gardner, (Mc-
Cartney), rear rank; Strain, half;
Joerg, (Havis), and Angell, five
eighths; Strong, center-three; Need
ham and Cass. (Rogers), wings; and
Campbell, (Cass), full.
Palo Alto High School —Owen and
ITolsten, front, rank; Clark, lock;
Clark, G., and Collier, breakaways;
Schnell and Meyers, rear rank; Pat
rick, wing forward; Brown, half;
Nagel and Shone, five-eighths; Green,
G., center-three; Woodard and Scho
fleld, wings; and Green, T., full.

After showing symptoms of at least
a little knowledge of rugby, in the
first half of the final practice game
played with the Palo Alto high school
fifteen yesterday afternoon on the
Cardinal turf, the Stanford freshmen
blew up, in the second period, and
were played off their feet, being de
feated by an 18 to 17 score.
Larkin and Kisling Out.
Weakened by the absence of two of
the team's star players, Larkin and
ltisling, the Stanford "babes" looked
to be disorganized from the first.
Fast playing, combined with more
"pep" than the fifteen has shown tor
considerable time, gave them an early
lead, and the contest had the appear
ance of a walkaway. During the first
half, Barneson, Gardner, Needham,
and Strong went across for trys, while
Angell added three points by drop
kicking a goal on a penalty, and
Needham converted one of the scores.
Nagel made the only touch for Palo
Alto, converting from an easy angle.
The half ended with Stanford lead
ing, 17 to 5.
Substitutes Play Second Half.
Coach Brown sent the team on the
field for the second half with many
substitutes in the lineup, presumably
to give them a final once-over before
choosing the fifteen to meet Santa
Clara. Either the new men slowed the
team up and took all the fight out of
it, or "Pally" played with renewed
vigor. At any rate, there was a de
cided change, and from a procession,
with the freshmen taking the ball
over regularly, the contest reversed
