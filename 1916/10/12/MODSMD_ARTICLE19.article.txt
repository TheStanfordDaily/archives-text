# Must Sport Tail Lights to Avoid Speed Cops
## 
### 
Bicycle riders of tlie campus must
sport tail lights on their vehicles or
become subject to jail and fined, ac
cording to word received by Student
Adviser W. P. Stamford from the
Santa Clara county police officers.
Motorcycle officers will be on the
highway to pick up everyone not com
plying with this ordinance. The
crossing from the University to Palo
Alto is considered one of the worst
in the county, and every effort is
being made by officers to eliminate
danger of collisions at night. Students
will be shown no lenience, the of
ficers say, now that they have been
notified of the ordinance and the in
tention to enforce it.
