# Dr. Wilbur Suggests Fraternity Remedies
## Believes That They Can Be of Great Service to Stanford 
### 
That he believes that fraternities
can be of great service to the Stan
ford community, but that there are
now certain fundamental wrongs in
the fraternity system on the campus,
was the statement of President Wil
bur in his talk with representatives
of the various chapters in the execu
tive oflices last evening. Dr. Wilbur
outlined in brief his plans for the
future Stanford. Among the changes
. which he hopes to see brought about
are the following:
(1) The erection of a number of
, small dormitories accommodating
from 80 to 100 men each.
(2) The separation of the men's and
women's living quarters to different
parts of the campus.
(3) The elimination of first semes
ter's initiations.
Not Opposed To Fraternities.
Dr. Wilbur stated emphatically that
he is not opposed to fraternities. He
stated, however, that investigation
proved that men who make good in
college stand a better chance of mak
ing good in life work, and on this
basis he urged the fraternities to take
steps to bring up their average schol
arship.
Does Not Favor Present System.
He told the representatives of the
various chapters, with whom he met
at their own request, that he is anx
ious to eliminate the present system
of picking members. He believes that
freshmen should not be permitted to
join the secret organization, and is an
advocate of a new system by which
j the fraternities as well as the pros-
I pective members will have at least
, one sep;estor to gain more intimate
knowledge of each other.
No action was taken at last night's
; meeting, but following a meeting of
tlie Men's Conference this evening,
the fraternity men will remain in ses
sion to consider the matter of first
semester initiations.
