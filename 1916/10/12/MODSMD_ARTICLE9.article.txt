# Peter Flanagan to Referee Frosh Santa Clara Game
## 
### 
After two weeks of conferences be
tween tho athletic bodies of Stanford
and Santa Clara, Peter Flanagan
was yesterday cliosen to referee the
intercollegiate football game between
the freshmen teams of the two univer
sities. W. Palmer Fuller was the orig
inal choice of the athletic committees,
but there were many objections from
the alumni of Santa Clara because
Fuller was formerly a Stanford man.
Hearing of these, Mr. Fuller yester
day sent a letter to the managers of
the teams declining the position.
Flanagan was then chosen, and has
accepted. He is an ideal man to
handle the whistle in such an impor
tant contest, as he has had a great
deal of experience both as a player
and as a referee. Flanagan first ap
peared on local rugby turfs when he
played with the "Waratahs" of Aus
tralia, on their tour several years
ago. He was a star forward of this
aggregation, and made a favorable im
pression on the football fans.
lie did not return to his native land
with the rest of the team, but went
into business in San Francisco. From
that time on, he was a favorite with
the rugby enthusiasts, as playing on
the Olympic Club and Barbarian Club
teams against Stanford, California,
and Santa Clara. He has refereed
many contests held on the Cardinal
turf, and has always given satisfac
tion.
The referee in an intercollegiate
game is an important figure. Santa
Clara and Stanford have had consider
able trouble this year in securing a
man that would satisfy both univer
sities and their alumni, but in Flana
gan they have found the solution to
their difficulties. When he blows the
starting whistle Saturday, the bleach
ers will feel confident that the play
will be fast, but minus the rough and
unfair tactics that often prevail when
an inefficient referee has the whistle.
