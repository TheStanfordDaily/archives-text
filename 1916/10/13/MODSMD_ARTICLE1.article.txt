There is not the least shadow of a
doubt that any man or woman, omit
ting the possibility of supernatural
powers, can forecast the ultimate cli
max of the hurricane of events that
take place in the great room of Bald
pate Inn.
Not, To Be Forgotten.
Baldpate Inn is a domicile that will
remain in the minds of a thousand
people after tonight, both on account
of the tragic and comic occurrences
that happen within its snowbound
walls, and because of the impressive
ness of this scene as erected on the
Stanford stage by the Alcazar Theater
of San Francisco.
Oiled, primed, trimmed, and cleared
for action, the players of "Seven
Keys" form a perfectly organized ma
chine, ready to run its race for pop

bly Hall tonight.
Scat Sale Shatters Record.
At 3 o'clock this afternoon an
nouncement was made that seat sales
for "Seven Keys to Baldpate" had
shattered all records for Stanford
dramatic productions*. If the demand
for the tickets which remain con
tinues unbroken, it is safe to predict
that even sales records for Junior
Operas will be outshadowed. Many
75 and 50 cent seats, and a few dol
lar accommodations are yet to be
had.
