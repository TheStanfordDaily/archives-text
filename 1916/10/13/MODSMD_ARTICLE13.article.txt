10 v^aiiipuo

10:00 a.m.—Peanut Squad vs. San
Alateo llijrh.
1:80 p.m.—Third Varsity vs.
Stockton IlijL'ii, on outside
turf.
1:80 p.m.—Lowell of San
Francisco vs. San Jose High.
8:00 p.m.—Stanford Freshmen vs.
Santa Clara Freshmen.
•1:00 p.m.—Stanford Varsity vs.
Palo Alto Athletic Club.

When Referee Peter Flannigan
blows the whistle at 3 p.m., tomorrow,
Stanford's first intercollegiate contest
of the 1916 season will be on, with
the Stanford babes lining up against
the fast team of the Santa Clara first
year men. A great deal of interest
surrounds this contest, and judging
from the respective lineups, a battle
royal should result.
Preceding this game, at 1:30, the
fifteen of Lowell high school of San
Francisco will meet San Jose High,
and immediately following the fresh
men contest, the varsity takes on the
fast Palo Alto Athletic Club, the ag
gregation of "Mush" Stevens.
Fifty cents has been set as the
price of admission to these three
thrillers. From all reports a large
crowd will be on hand. Santa Clara
University students might be said to
be coming in their entirety, accom
panied by tlioir band. In addition to
this, thoy will have many supporters
here from San Francisco as well as
San Jose and Santa Clara.
San .lose High is bringing their
Junior Chamber of Commerce, while
I
Lowell has asked for a block of seats
to be reserved for them. As the
Stockton and San Matoo high school
boys are here, many of the high school
players of the state will get a chance
to witness not only our freshmen play
but the varsity as well.
As in all former intercollegiate con
tests, Stanford students and their
supporters will occupy the north
bleachers —the sections on the sunny
side of the field, opposite those used
during preliminary contests. Stanford
Band will be on deck to aid Yell
Leader "Sharkey" Gilroy, and his as
sistants, Hauser and Speers, to en
liven the rooters.
To avert, hindrance of the crowds,
automobiles will not be allowed to
park near the gates or within the en
closures.
Varsity -Minus Itraden.
Coach Brown will present the var
sity tomorrow in practically the same
lineup as heretofore. Captain Joe
Braden will be out of the game to
morrow on account of a weak ankle.
"Cy"Katten, who has been out of the
game for some weeks owing to a
threatened attack of appendicitis, is
listed tomorrow as substitute half,
while Bacon is to play one of the
wings. Other than this the lineup
will be the same.
Palo Alto should offer the varsity
strong opposition, comprising Davis,
Templeton, Stolz, Greeve, Hammond,
and Huttman, a backfield that em
bodies speed. This team was unable
to score against the Santa Clara var
sity last Sunday at Santa Clara. Con
sequently, tomorrow's struggle will
serve somewhat as a basis of compari
son between the two varsities at the
present time.
At 1:30, the third varsity play the
Stockton high school squad on the
outside turf, this game taking place
at the same time as the Lowell-San
Jose game on the inside.
For the second varsity men, a game
has been arranged with the College
of Pacific, on their field, this after
noon. This battle is being staged on
Friday in order that the team may
have an opportunity to witness the

and immediately following the fresh
men contest, the varsity takes on the
fast Palo Alto Athletic Club, the ag
gregation of "Mush" Stevens.
Fifty cents has been set as the
price of admission to these three
thrillers. From all reports a large
crowd will be on hand. Santa Clara
University students might be said to
be coming in their entirety, accom
panied by tlioir band. In addition to
this, thoy will have many supporters
here from San Francisco as well as
San Jose and Santa Clara.
San .lose High is bringing their
Junior Chamber of Commerce, while
I
Lowell has asked for a block of seats
to be reserved for them. As the
Stockton and San Matoo high school
boys are here, many of the high school
players of the state will get a chance
to witness not only our freshmen play
but the varsity as well.
As in all former intercollegiate con
tests, Stanford students and their
supporters will occupy the north
bleachers —the sections on the sunny
side of the field, opposite those used
during preliminary contests. Stanford
Band will be on deck to aid Yell
Leader "Sharkey" Gilroy, and his as
sistants, Hauser and Speers, to en
liven the rooters.
To avert, hindrance of the crowds,
automobiles will not be allowed to
park near the gates or within the en
closures.
Varsity -Minus Itraden.
Coach Brown will present the var
sity tomorrow in practically the same
lineup as heretofore. Captain Joe
Braden will be out of the game to
morrow on account of a weak ankle.
"Cy"Katten, who has been out of the
game for some weeks owing to a
threatened attack of appendicitis, is
listed tomorrow as substitute half,
while Bacon is to play one of the
wings. Other than this the lineup
will be the same.
Palo Alto should offer the varsity
strong opposition, comprising Davis,
Templeton, Stolz, Greeve, Hammond,
and Huttman, a backfield that em
bodies speed. This team was unable
to score against the Santa Clara var
sity last Sunday at Santa Clara. Con
sequently, tomorrow's struggle will
serve somewhat as a basis of compari
son between the two varsities at the
present time.
At 1:30, the third varsity play the
Stockton high school squad on the
outside turf, this game taking place
at the same time as the Lowell-San
Jose game on the inside.
For the second varsity men, a game
has been arranged with the College
of Pacific, on their field, this after
noon. This battle is being staged on
Friday in order that the team may
have an opportunity to witness the
freshmen contest at home, Saturday.

Coach Brown will present the var
sity tomorrow in practically the same
lineup as heretofore. Captain Joe

morrow on account of a weak ankle.
"Cy"Katten, who has been out of the
game for some weeks owing to a
threatened attack of appendicitis, is
listed tomorrow as substitute half,
while Bacon is to play one of the
wings. Other than this the lineup
will be the same.
Palo Alto should offer the varsity
strong opposition, comprising Davis,
Templeton, Stolz, Greeve, Hammond,
and Huttman, a backfield that em
bodies speed. This team was unable
to score against the Santa Clara var
sity last Sunday at Santa Clara. Con
sequently, tomorrow's struggle will
serve somewhat as a basis of compari
son between the two varsities at the
present time.
At 1:30, the third varsity play the

When Referee Peter Flannigan
blows the whistle at 3 p.m., tomorrow,
Stanford's first intercollegiate contest
of the 1916 season will be on, with
the Stanford babes lining up against
the fast team of the Santa Clara first
year men. A great deal of interest
surrounds this contest, and judging
from the respective lineups, a battle
royal should result.
Preceding this game, at 1:30, the
fifteen of Lowell high school of San
Francisco will meet San Jose High,
and immediately following the fresh
men contest, the varsity takes on the
fast Palo Alto Athletic Club, the ag
gregation of "Mush" Stevens.
Fifty cents has been set as the
price of admission to these three
thrillers. From all reports a large
crowd will be on hand. Santa Clara
University students might be said to
be coming in their entirety, accom
panied by tlioir band. In addition to
this, thoy will have many supporters
here from San Francisco as well as
San Jose and Santa Clara.
San .lose High is bringing their
Junior Chamber of Commerce, while
I
Lowell has asked for a block of seats
to be reserved for them. As the
Stockton and San Matoo high school
boys are here, many of the high school
players of the state will get a chance
to witness not only our freshmen play
but the varsity as well.
As in all former intercollegiate con
tests, Stanford students and their
supporters will occupy the north
bleachers —the sections on the sunny
side of the field, opposite those used
during preliminary contests. Stanford
Band will be on deck to aid Yell
Leader "Sharkey" Gilroy, and his as
sistants, Hauser and Speers, to en
liven the rooters.
To avert, hindrance of the crowds,
automobiles will not be allowed to
park near the gates or within the en
closures.
