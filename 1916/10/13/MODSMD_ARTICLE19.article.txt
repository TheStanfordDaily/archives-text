# Washington Rooters Must Stay at Home
## 
### 
Rooting at the California-Washing
ton game will be featured by even
more onesidedness this year than last
because of the refusal of the Univer
sity of Washington faculty to permit
students to accompany their team
south. Attendance of Washington stu
dents at the game in Berkeley would
necessitate their absence from the
classes for two or three days, and
this the faculty refused to sanction.
Washington supporters will now have
to be contented with bulletined re
ports of their big game.
