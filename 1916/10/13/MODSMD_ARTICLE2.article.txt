# Election Returns for Assembly Audience
## 
### 
Stanford students will know the re
sults of the coming presidential elec
tion as soon as the votes are counted.
The Daily Palo Alto and the San
Francisco Examiner have cooperated
in a proposition that will give the
students service equal to any in the
country. Not only will they be able
to know the final result as soon as
the ballots are counted, but the re
turns willbe shown as they are tallied
in different sections.
President Wilbur has given his as
surance that the Asernbly Hall may
be used, so The Daily Palo Alto is
making full arrangements for the eve
ning's entertainment. .T. S. Ross, '15,
sporting correspondent for the Ex
aminer on the campus, and G. G.
Weigle, '95, editorial auditor of the
Examiner, have arranged with the
authorities of the San Francisco paper
to get the Hearst service for the cam
pus. A special wire will be installed
in the Assembly Hall, and what equip
ment is needed will be shipped from
San Francisco. Mr. Weigle plans on
coming down himself to see that ade
quate service is maintained.
The Daily Palo Alto has made ar
rangements for a reel of motion pic
tures of the last Stanford-Santa Clara
football game, and is now attempting
to get a number of other forms of
entertainment for the students who
come to the Assembly Hall. Rams
Head, the Glee Club, and the Man
dolin Club will all furnish skits, and
it is expected that both the Hughes
and "Wilson clubs will have some fea
tures.
A foe of 2") cents will be charged
for admission, The Daily Palo Alto
turning this money over to the stu
dent body. This system was carried
out four years ago, and was a suc
cess, the students crowding the As
sembly Hall.
