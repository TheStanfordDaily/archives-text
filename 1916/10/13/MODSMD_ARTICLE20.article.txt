# New System to Relieve Confusion at U.C. Hops
## 
### 
To minimize the confusion and
crowding of the hall room floor dur
ing the exchange of dances, the com
mittee in charge of the Sophomore
Hop at California has adopted a now
system of introduction, by which tho
couples occupy numbered "booths."
When dances are to be exchanged,
the couple having (ho highest num
ber proceeds to the lower numbered
booth.
