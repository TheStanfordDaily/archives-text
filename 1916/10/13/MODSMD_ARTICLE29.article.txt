# Fast Rugby Slated for Santa Clara Sunday P.M.
## 
### 
Santa Clara varsity takes on the
Olympic Club fifteen of San Fran
cisco this coming Sunday on the Mis
sion Town turf. No scores have been
made a yet this year on the proteges
of Charley Austin, and the club men
are fully resolved to cross the Santa
Clara line even if they succeed in
doing nothing more.
Many rooters from San Jose and
vicinity will be on band to watch the
conflict, and some will go down from
here so as to lie able to dope some
idea as to the prowess of the local
varsity as compared with that of the
Mission college.
