# WE DON'T MIND IF OUR HUBBIES STAY AWAY, WOMEN VOTE
## 
### 
Students of Stanford not only
went on record today as over
whelmingly in favor of a compul
sory system of military training,
but the women of the University
cast their ballots almost unani
mously iu favor of a plan of
training which will later take
their sweethearts and husbands
away from home for a short per
iod.
These are the conclusions
that may be drawn from the vote
on the Swiss system of military
training, which was completed
here yesterday. The vote, which
was conducted by the Sacramento
"Bee," through the Student Ad
viser's office, went 590 votes for
and 217 against.
