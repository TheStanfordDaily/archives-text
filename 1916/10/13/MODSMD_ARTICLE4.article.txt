# "Chappie" Increases High Cost of Living
## 
### 
Along with bread, beef-steaks, shoes
and other necessities of life, Chap
arral is now to cost the ultimate con
sumer more, a new subscription rate
of one dollar and a half per year
going into effect November Ist. Un
like other commodities, however, more
will be offered for the money. As
surance is given that under the aew
rate more colors, latitude for better
covers, and more pages of reading
matter will constitute a raise in qual
it to accompany the raise in price.
The Chaparral is now conceded a
place among the highest class college
comics in the United States, and may
be expected to advance even more
with the wider range afforded.
Manager Ed Martin has granted
two weeks before the raise becomes
effective in order that all who desire
may have a chance to subscribe under
the existing dollar rate. He advises
all who wish to take advantage of this
to talk business immediately with 0.
G. Lachmund, who is in charge of
the circulation, or with one of his
assistants.
