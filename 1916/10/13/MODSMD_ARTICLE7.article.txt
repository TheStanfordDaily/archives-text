# PRESIDENT TELLS OF THE FUTURE STANFORD
## CAMPUS FAN-SHAPED Women to Be Moved West of Quad, Men to the East, Faculty on Row 
### F.J. Taylor, '18 
Picture a gigantic fan, with two
Quadrangles as the nucleus, with a
woman's "Row" extending toward old
Roble bridge, with a woman's athletic
headquarters extending toward Lagun
ita, with homes of professors skirting
the hill, with a fraternity and men's
dormitory "Row" toward the section
now known as the "Hall" district,
and with men's athletic fields where
they now are and toward Cottage
Terrace—picture this anil put a 192—
date line on it, and you have the ideal
conception of Stanford of the future
as President Ray Lyman Wilbur sees
it.
The Biir Idea.
This is the bid idea of the huge
proposition. The Stanford campus has
not been arranged with a long dis
tance view, except the old Quad and
the new one that is coming. In a gen
eral way. President Wilbur and the
Trustees now see in the distance what
the "farm" of the future will look
like when an aviator of some future
decade carries a movie man over the
campus.
Now for a few specific changes
which "the powers that be" have in
mind. Probably the first feature that
needs attention is the housing of
everyone on the campus.
Roble Hall, men's dormitory, will
be but a temporary arrangement.
Some day no man can head toward
Roble Bridge without acknowledging
that he is invading the realm of
women. Both sorority and non-soror
ity women will live in that section of
houses, though non-sorority women
the campus, presumably in small
may be grouped about a court.
All women's athletic equipment will
be erected near the women's houses.
Go west, years from now, and you go
into the territory of the feminine,
where everything is feminine, and
where the feminine will rule supreme.
Go in the opposite direction, when
you make this visit to Stanford, and
you will enter the realm of "mere
man." From the edge of the new Quad
toward Cottage Terrace will be the
houses of the fraternities and the
smaller dormitories. Encina will be
there unchanged, in all probability,
since it is included in President Wil
bur's scheme of things. Men's ath
letic equipment will be near the men's
living quarters.
In that day to come, professors can
enjoy themselves on the present
"Row" and in the hills, without the
banging of drums and the musical
strains of pianos, or the songs of the
fraternity men. These will have been
moved Encina-ward.
The center of the fan will be the
road between the two Quads, past
the Union and toward the post office.
Tn the old Quad will be the classes
largely of the University. In the
new Quad it is hoped to have a Com
mons, such as the one at Harvard or
at Chicago universities, where very
one can eat —if everyone so desires
—at the nominal cost available only
in groups of a thousand or so. The
Commons will be tho gathering place
of the campus, where all tlie elements
of the community come together and
contribute their sfaarc to that ics
sentlal article called Stanford spirit.
"These are our plans in a general
way," said President Wilbur, this
morning. "They are rather hazy as
yet, because 'it takes time for us to
think them over and work them out.
Tt, will take years to bring these
things about, but when we do we
will have everyone living on the cam
pus in the best possible way, and will
have things working together in a
way that will make Stanford boom
along." And President Wilbur's eyes
lighted lip in a way that made you
feel that theso fine things will come
about in shorter time than even he
anticipates.
