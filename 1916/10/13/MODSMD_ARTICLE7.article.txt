# PRESIDENT TELLS OF THE FUTURE STANFORD
## CAMPUS FAN-SHAPED Women to Be Moved West of Quad, Men to the East, Faculty on Row 
### F.J. Taylor, '18 
Picture a gigantic fan, with two
Quadrangles as the nucleus, with a
woman's "Row" extending toward old
Roble bridge, with a woman's athletic
headquarters extending toward Lagun
ita, with homes of professors skirting
the hill, with a fraternity and men's
dormitory "Row" toward the section
now known as the "Hall" district,
and with men's athletic fields where
they now are and toward Cottage
Terrace—picture this anil put a 192—
date line on it, and you have the ideal
conception of Stanford of the future
as President Ray Lyman Wilbur sees
it.
The Biir Idea.
This is the bid idea of the huge
proposition. The Stanford campus has
not been arranged with a long dis
tance view, except the old Quad and
the new one that is coming. In a gen
eral way. President Wilbur and the
Trustees now see in the distance what
the "farm" of the future will look
like when an aviator of some future
decade carries a movie man over the
campus.
Now for a few specific changes
which "the powers that be" have in
mind. Probably the first feature that
needs attention is the housing of
everyone on the campus.
