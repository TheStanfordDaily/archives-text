# Economists Discuss Effects of War
## "Hughes and Wilson Favor Same Laws," Says Johnson at Smoker 
### 
Some startling facts of trade and
politics were revealed to Economic
students at the annual smoker held
in the Union last night, when Pro
fessors M. S. Wildman, A. C. Whit
aker, A. S. Johnson, and S. I. Miller
of the Economics department, in their
talks, laid emphasis on the theory that
the United States at the end of the
war will face a great stress in trade.
Professor Wildman, in welcoming
new men, explained the instruments
of education at hand in the Univer
sity, urging close acquaintance with
the library. He was followed by Pro-
fessor A. C. Whitaker, with a discus
sion of the "Dollar Exchange." This
movement of a new medium of ex
change will, if it is successful, shift
the money market of the world from
London to New York. "In the past,
90 per cent of the trade of the world
has been financed through London,"
said Professor Whitaker, "and the
New York bankers are trying to get
some of this for themselves. The only
way that this can be done is for the
United States to become a creditor
nation. When we are able to dis
count bills of exchange cheaply, we
will become the foremost money power
in the world."
"Hughes or Wilson" was the subject
of Professor Alvin S. Johnson's dis
cussion. "We can not hope for any
great laws or changes in the next
four years; both condidates stand for
about the same type of legislation, so
there cannot be any great difference
who is president," he stated. Accord
ing to Professor Johnson, the whole
issue is "do we want Hughes, with
his superior executive ability, or do
we want Wilson, with his passion for
constitutional reform."
Professor Miller predicted the gov
ernment ownership of railroads as a
result of the war. "The trade war
will call forth government control and
this will mean that every man will
have to be alive to citizenship in the
highest sense of the word," was one
of his statements.
A. J. Hettinger closed the smoker
with an explanation of the courses at
hand for students in the department.
