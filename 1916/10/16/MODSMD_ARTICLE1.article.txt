# "SEVEN KEYS" TO LIVE AS SUPER SUCCESS
## HAS RECORD HOUSE Dramatic Triumph Is Result of Well Chosen Star Cast and Finished Coaching 
### H.S. Marshutz '17 
When five "hell's," a dozen "damns,"
five pistol shots, a score of melodra
matic lines of the "stand-back
villyan" sort, and a deal of what is
vulgarly dubbed "love stuff" can get
over and convince when played by
amateurs, —to a college audience at
that, —there is unchallengeable evi
dence of a dramatic triumph.
"Seven Keys to Haldpate," produced
by Sword and Sandals under the di
rection of Frank L. Mathieu, of San
Francisco, took its place Friday eve
ning as the most successful-in-every
way drama yet produced here, playing
before the largest, audience ever in
attendance at student plays.
Acting Made Success.
But the Haldpate play did not suc
ceed only because of the swearing,
the shooting, the tumult and the
shouting. Haldpate was a happy
choice. The important characters —
and practically every role was vital —
were chosen by a master hand, and
justified their choice. The gestures,
the well-timed screams, the gasps of
fear and astonishment, these essen
tial bits of stage tactics as built into
the play by the actors, were a tribute
to their own strength and to Frank
Mathieu, whose magic touch caused
a finished play to spring where before
were only lines and men and women
to interpret them.
Some Trifles.
What if a line or two was accident
ally omitted? What if a player,
slightly dazzled by the consciousness
of an audience slipped a cue, or per
mitted his stage voice to drop? What
if some narrow spectator snickered
at the unrealistic fire, the silent locks,
or creaking stair when all was evi
dently still —what of these trifles?
There were bigger things in the minds
of all, Friday.
Someone labeled Haldpate a play
without a lead. Far be it! Go out
