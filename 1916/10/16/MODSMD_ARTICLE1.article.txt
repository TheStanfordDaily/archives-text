# "SEVEN KEYS" TO LIVE AS SUPER SUCCESS
## HAS RECORD HOUSE Dramatic Triumph Is Result of Well Chosen Star Cast and Finished Coaching 
### H.S. Marshutz '17 
When five "hell's," a dozen "damns,"
five pistol shots, a score of melodra
matic lines of the "stand-back
villyan" sort, and a deal of what is
vulgarly dubbed "love stuff" can get
over and convince when played by
amateurs, —to a college audience at
that, —there is unchallengeable evi
dence of a dramatic triumph.
"Seven Keys to Haldpate," produced
by Sword and Sandals under the di
rection of Frank L. Mathieu, of San
Francisco, took its place Friday eve
ning as the most successful-in-every
way drama yet produced here, playing
before the largest, audience ever in
attendance at student plays.
Acting Made Success.
But the Haldpate play did not suc
ceed only because of the swearing,
the shooting, the tumult and the
shouting. Haldpate was a happy
choice. The important characters —
and practically every role was vital —
were chosen by a master hand, and
justified their choice. The gestures,
the well-timed screams, the gasps of
fear and astonishment, these essen
tial bits of stage tactics as built into
the play by the actors, were a tribute
to their own strength and to Frank
Mathieu, whose magic touch caused
a finished play to spring where before
were only lines and men and women
to interpret them.
Some Trifles.
What if a line or two was accident
ally omitted? What if a player,
slightly dazzled by the consciousness
of an audience slipped a cue, or per
mitted his stage voice to drop? What
if some narrow spectator snickered
at the unrealistic fire, the silent locks,
or creaking stair when all was evi
dently still —what of these trifles?
There were bigger things in the minds
of all, Friday.
Someone labeled Haldpate a play
without a lead. Far be it! Go out
into your garden, pick a bouquet, and
hand it to Richard Johnston. Less
was known of Johnston's powers at
tiie opening of the curtains than of
any of the Baldpate veterans. At the
close, lie had established himself as
an exceedingly clever actor, showing
to particular advantage in the soft
sentimental situations, which on ac
count of their utter naivete, required
tip-toe handling, and a sixth sense
of knowing just how far to carry the
illusions.
The First Key.
The first key to Baldpate Inn un
locked a secret: that Harry and Thur
lyne Buffum, before the footlights, are
worship-inspiring interpreters of char
acter. As the old Quimbys, they por
trayed human eccentricities with such
wierd exactness that their work on
the stage must be judged by profes
sional standards.
The Second Key.
With key number two came the hope
of a perfected bit of character inter
pretation, and those who hoped met
no disappointment in Ruford Williams,
a veteran of Stanford dramatics. His
acting was up to the standard Stan
ford theater-goers have reason to ex
pect of him. As in all of Williams'
work, his command of facial expres
sion, and his quick yet deliberate ac
tion, was a strong asset to his role.
Key Tliree.
Although the winter wind whistled
through the sjiow, when the door
opened for key three, sunshine entered
with Florence Mason. In "Seven
Keys" she was at her best, display
ing personality plus a powerful smile
duly punctuated by well placed dim
ples, all of which entered into con
spiracy to make her presence on the
stage a delightful necessity in the
barren mountain-top hostelry.
Fourth Key.
The fourth key brought a revelation
in the acting of Joseph C. Cross as
the hermit, Peters. In the most in
tricate role of the play, Cross put
over a character that equaled, if it
did not out-hermit the original Bald
pate Peters.
Key Five.
Nellita Choate came in by means of
key five, and with her came a fault
less rendition of the woman black
mailer. Miss Choate won well de
served applause as Mvra Thornhill.
There can hardly have been a bit on
any stage anywhere that excelled her
lightning transition that came with
her words: "Who are those women?"
Cordon Davis should have been ad
mitted by a golden key. His acting
Friday was the finished brand that
is seen but once in a blue-moon, on
an amateur stage. Davis put his all
into the role of Don Max, displaying
a range of emotional powers that sur
prised even those who knew him best.
His portrayal of uncontrollable inter
nal struggle was one of the high points
of the performance.
Stage presence, facial expression,
and a naturalness of gesture and
voice made the role of Cargan, as
played by Edward Martin, who en
tered with key six. a piece of high
class acting. Martin's work indicated
his strength as an actor.
Josephine Welch, making a success
of a thankless role; Foster Weeks of
fering an accurate picture of an un
scrupulous, bullying man of money;
John Russell, aided by Henry TTauser
and Harry W.vckoff, as the arms of the
law, were those who, although not
furnished with keys by the author,
gave a great deal of good acting that
went toward the making of "Seven
Keys," Friday.
The seventh key to Baldpate be
longed to Francis Murray, who hewed
to the line in a role that offered great
expectations for the audience, but lit
tle to accomplish on the stage.

a range of emotional powers that sur
prised even those who knew him best.
His portrayal of uncontrollable inter
nal struggle was one of the high points
of the performance.
Stage presence, facial expression,
and a naturalness of gesture and
voice made the role of Cargan, as
played by Edward Martin, who en
tered with key six. a piece of high
class acting. Martin's work indicated
his strength as an actor.
Josephine Welch, making a success
of a thankless role; Foster Weeks of
fering an accurate picture of an un
scrupulous, bullying man of money;
John Russell, aided by Henry TTauser
and Harry W.vckoff, as the arms of the
law, were those who, although not
furnished with keys by the author,
gave a great deal of good acting that
went toward the making of "Seven
Keys," Friday.
The seventh key to Baldpate be
longed to Francis Murray, who hewed
to the line in a role that offered great
expectations for the audience, but lit
tle to accomplish on the stage.
When five "hell's," a dozen "damns,"
five pistol shots, a score of melodra
matic lines of the "stand-back
villyan" sort, and a deal of what is
vulgarly dubbed "love stuff" can get
over and convince when played by
amateurs, —to a college audience at
that, —there is unchallengeable evi
dence of a dramatic triumph.
"Seven Keys to Haldpate," produced
by Sword and Sandals under the di
rection of Frank L. Mathieu, of San
Francisco, took its place Friday eve
ning as the most successful-in-every
way drama yet produced here, playing
before the largest, audience ever in
attendance at student plays.
Acting Made Success.
But the Haldpate play did not suc
ceed only because of the swearing,
the shooting, the tumult and the
shouting. Haldpate was a happy
choice. The important characters —
and practically every role was vital —
were chosen by a master hand, and
justified their choice. The gestures,
the well-timed screams, the gasps of
fear and astonishment, these essen
tial bits of stage tactics as built into
the play by the actors, were a tribute
to their own strength and to Frank
Mathieu, whose magic touch caused
a finished play to spring where before
were only lines and men and women
to interpret them.
Some Trifles.
What if a line or two was accident
ally omitted? What if a player,
slightly dazzled by the consciousness
of an audience slipped a cue, or per
mitted his stage voice to drop? What
if some narrow spectator snickered
at the unrealistic fire, the silent locks,
or creaking stair when all was evi
dently still —what of these trifles?
There were bigger things in the minds
of all, Friday.
Someone labeled Haldpate a play
without a lead. Far be it! Go out
into your garden, pick a bouquet, and
hand it to Richard Johnston. Less
was known of Johnston's powers at
tiie opening of the curtains than of
any of the Baldpate veterans. At the
close, lie had established himself as
an exceedingly clever actor, showing
to particular advantage in the soft
sentimental situations, which on ac
count of their utter naivete, required
tip-toe handling, and a sixth sense
of knowing just how far to carry the
illusions.
The First Key.
The first key to Baldpate Inn un
locked a secret: that Harry and Thur
lyne Buffum, before the footlights, are
worship-inspiring interpreters of char
acter. As the old Quimbys, they por
trayed human eccentricities with such
wierd exactness that their work on
the stage must be judged by profes
sional standards.
The Second Key.
With key number two came the hope
of a perfected bit of character inter
pretation, and those who hoped met
no disappointment in Ruford Williams,
a veteran of Stanford dramatics. His
acting was up to the standard Stan
ford theater-goers have reason to ex
pect of him. As in all of Williams'
work, his command of facial expres
sion, and his quick yet deliberate ac
tion, was a strong asset to his role.
Key Tliree.
Although the winter wind whistled
through the sjiow, when the door
opened for key three, sunshine entered
with Florence Mason. In "Seven
Keys" she was at her best, display
ing personality plus a powerful smile
duly punctuated by well placed dim
ples, all of which entered into con
spiracy to make her presence on the
stage a delightful necessity in the
barren mountain-top hostelry.
Fourth Key.
The fourth key brought a revelation
in the acting of Joseph C. Cross as
the hermit, Peters. In the most in
tricate role of the play, Cross put
over a character that equaled, if it
did not out-hermit the original Bald
pate Peters.
Key Five.
Nellita Choate came in by means of
key five, and with her came a fault
less rendition of the woman black
mailer. Miss Choate won well de
served applause as Mvra Thornhill.
There can hardly have been a bit on
any stage anywhere that excelled her
lightning transition that came with
her words: "Who are those women?"
Cordon Davis should have been ad
mitted by a golden key. His acting
Friday was the finished brand that
is seen but once in a blue-moon, on
an amateur stage. Davis put his all
into the role of Don Max, displaying
a range of emotional powers that sur

stage a delightful necessity in the
barren mountain-top hostelry.
Fourth Key.
The fourth key brought a revelation
in the acting of Joseph C. Cross as
the hermit, Peters. In the most in
tricate role of the play, Cross put
over a character that equaled, if it
did not out-hermit the original Bald
pate Peters.
Key Five.
Nellita Choate came in by means of
key five, and with her came a fault
less rendition of the woman black
mailer. Miss Choate won well de
served applause as Mvra Thornhill.
There can hardly have been a bit on
any stage anywhere that excelled her
lightning transition that came with
her words: "Who are those women?"
Cordon Davis should have been ad
mitted by a golden key. His acting
Friday was the finished brand that
is seen but once in a blue-moon, on
an amateur stage. Davis put his all
into the role of Don Max, displaying
a range of emotional powers that sur
prised even those who knew him best.
His portrayal of uncontrollable inter
nal struggle was one of the high points
of the performance.
Stage presence, facial expression,
and a naturalness of gesture and
voice made the role of Cargan, as
played by Edward Martin, who en
tered with key six. a piece of high
class acting. Martin's work indicated
his strength as an actor.
Josephine Welch, making a success
of a thankless role; Foster Weeks of
fering an accurate picture of an un
scrupulous, bullying man of money;
John Russell, aided by Henry TTauser
and Harry W.vckoff, as the arms of the
law, were those who, although not
furnished with keys by the author,
gave a great deal of good acting that
went toward the making of "Seven
Keys," Friday.
The seventh key to Baldpate be
longed to Francis Murray, who hewed
to the line in a role that offered great
expectations for the audience, but lit
tle to accomplish on the stage.
When five "hell's," a dozen "damns,"
five pistol shots, a score of melodra
matic lines of the "stand-back
villyan" sort, and a deal of what is
vulgarly dubbed "love stuff" can get
over and convince when played by
amateurs, —to a college audience at
that, —there is unchallengeable evi
dence of a dramatic triumph.
"Seven Keys to Haldpate," produced
by Sword and Sandals under the di
rection of Frank L. Mathieu, of San
Francisco, took its place Friday eve
ning as the most successful-in-every
way drama yet produced here, playing
before the largest, audience ever in
attendance at student plays.
Acting Made Success.
But the Haldpate play did not suc
ceed only because of the swearing,
the shooting, the tumult and the
shouting. Haldpate was a happy
choice. The important characters —
and practically every role was vital —
were chosen by a master hand, and
justified their choice. The gestures,
the well-timed screams, the gasps of
fear and astonishment, these essen
tial bits of stage tactics as built into
the play by the actors, were a tribute
to their own strength and to Frank
Mathieu, whose magic touch caused
a finished play to spring where before
were only lines and men and women
to interpret them.
Some Trifles.
What if a line or two was accident
ally omitted? What if a player,
slightly dazzled by the consciousness
of an audience slipped a cue, or per
mitted his stage voice to drop? What
if some narrow spectator snickered
at the unrealistic fire, the silent locks,
or creaking stair when all was evi
dently still —what of these trifles?
There were bigger things in the minds
of all, Friday.
Someone labeled Haldpate a play
without a lead. Far be it! Go out
into your garden, pick a bouquet, and
hand it to Richard Johnston. Less
was known of Johnston's powers at
tiie opening of the curtains than of
any of the Baldpate veterans. At the
close, lie had established himself as
an exceedingly clever actor, showing
to particular advantage in the soft
sentimental situations, which on ac
count of their utter naivete, required
tip-toe handling, and a sixth sense
of knowing just how far to carry the
illusions.
The First Key.
The first key to Baldpate Inn un
locked a secret: that Harry and Thur
lyne Buffum, before the footlights, are
worship-inspiring interpreters of char
acter. As the old Quimbys, they por
trayed human eccentricities with such
wierd exactness that their work on
the stage must be judged by profes
sional standards.
The Second Key.
With key number two came the hope
of a perfected bit of character inter
pretation, and those who hoped met
no disappointment in Ruford Williams,
a veteran of Stanford dramatics. His
acting was up to the standard Stan
ford theater-goers have reason to ex
pect of him. As in all of Williams'
work, his command of facial expres
sion, and his quick yet deliberate ac
tion, was a strong asset to his role.
Key Tliree.
Although the winter wind whistled
through the sjiow, when the door
opened for key three, sunshine entered
with Florence Mason. In "Seven
Keys" she was at her best, display
ing personality plus a powerful smile
duly punctuated by well placed dim
ples, all of which entered into con
spiracy to make her presence on the
stage a delightful necessity in the
barren mountain-top hostelry.
