# Womens Pool Opened
## 
### 
Stanford women were able to dive
into their new swimming pool today
for the first time. From now on reg
ular student classes will be conducted.
Until now the faculty and alumnae
have been the only ones benefitted
by the pool, which has been com
pleted for over a week, owing to a
mistake made in the delivery of the
suits by Qantner and Mattern Co., with
whom the students' order was placed.
