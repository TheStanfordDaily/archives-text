# MISSION BABES TOO POWERFUL FOR FRESHMEN
## LOSE TO S.C. 9 TO 0 Cardinal Babes Show Fight and Pluck But Are Plainly Outclassed 
### N.H. Petree, '19 
"They played a wonderful same
with heavy odds against them, and I
am very proud of every member of the
team, and also of the substitutes that
helped make the team what it was."
These were „the words of football
coach Floyd Brown, immediately after
the game between the Stanford fresh
men and the University of Santa
Clara freshmen, played on the Card
inal turf, last Saturday.
Although the game ended with the
local 1920 aggregation on the short
end of a 9 to 0 score, every one of
the three thousand rooters who
swarmed to the bleachers for the
spectacular rugby card, had nothing
but praise for the losing team.
Cardinals Swoop.
With the band playing, and the
stands responding to the gestures of
the yell leaders, referee Peter Flan
nigan started the feature contest at
3:15. The Stanford fifteen swooped
down with a rush, and looked danger
ous lor the first few minutes, but be
fore the play had gone far, it was evi
dent that the Santa Clara team was the
better of the two squads.
After sixteen minutes of thrilling
rugby, in which time Campbell, Need
ham, liarneson. Larkin, and Angell
won their way into the hearts of the
Cardinal pigskin followers by their
splendid defensive work, the Mission
Town team got under way for the
first score of the contest. McKecknie
intercepted a pass by Rogers, ran
thirty yards, and transferred to Cap
tain Muldoon, who went over for the
first touchdown. Muldoon failed to
convert his try, leaving the score 3
to 0.
Buttle Royal.
From then 011 until the whistle that
ended the first half, the contest was
a battle royal. It surged from one end
of the field to the other, but was in
the Stanford territory most of the
time. Larkin featured with some
clever runs, regardless of a painful
ankle, while Rogers aided the cause
with timely boots to touch. The half
ended with 110 more scores being
marked up, although Muldoon was
nearly successful in an attempt at a
goal kick on a penalty.
With Palmtag at Eisert's place for
Santa Clara, the second period started
with a rush. The weight of the visit
ing team began to count, and in con
trast with the Stanford backlield, the
Mission speed artists passed the ball
with brilliancy. Muldoon, Don, and
Vincini of the forwards greatly as
sisted Berndt and McKecknie in pass
ing rushes goalward. Their teamwork
improved, showing the effects of the
excellent coaching of Charlie Austin,
former Stanford star, and from a con
test with both teams on the offensive,
the game changed to a battle with the
Santa Clara fifteen battering forward,
and the Stanford squad bravely fight
ing every inch of the way.
Injuries Frequent.
Injuries or a minor nature were
frequent, especially on the Cardinal
team, as the opposing players drove
hard at the smaller and weaker fif
teen. Cass went in for Angell and
McCartney replaced Tilton, making
seventeen men for the Executive Com
mittee to grant numerals to. Santa
Clara scored twice in the second half,
Muldoon missing both attempts at
conversion. The first try came about
when Joerg fumbled Larkin's poor
pass, giving McKecknie a chance to
get under way. The five-eighths star
passed to Don, who went across for
the second score. The final count
came after a ruck in the last minute
of the game, McCarthy flinging him
self over for an easy try.
Outclassed, outweighed, and in real
ity outgeneraled from the start, the
Stanford team was forced to acknowl
edge defeat, but in the amount of
fight and gameness displayed, the
Cardinal "babes" took the palm.
They fought all the way, never giving
up, and always attempting to give the
University a victory with the cards
stacked against them.
Varsity Defeats I*. A. A. 0.
Foil owing the freshmen game, the
varsity met the fast Palo Alto Athletic
Club in a hard contest. Finishing in
the dark, the Stanford players rung
al9 to 8 defeat on the clubmen. Spec
tacular playing featured the game,
with the university men winning he
cause of superior condition, although
Coach Drown used all the available
substitutes.
Carroll, Scott, and Winham scored
in the first half for the varsity, 'Dink"
Templeton converting two of the trvs.
Stolz went over for the Athletic Club,
"Ric" Templeton sending the ball be
tween the posts for two more points.
The first period ended without fur
ther scoring, the board reading 13 to
5. In the second half, Sample and
Chandler scored for Stanford, while
Hammon, after a long run, tallied for
the opponents. The game was ex
citing all the way, and was resplend
ant with brilliant plays.
As a curtain-raiser to the main
event of the day's football, Lowell
high school defeated San Jose high
school by an 8 to 0 tally. The game
was weird from a rugby standpoint,
but furnished a great, deal of amuse
ment for those who arrived early.

sisted Berndt and McKecknie in pass
ing rushes goalward. Their teamwork
improved, showing the effects of the
excellent coaching of Charlie Austin,
former Stanford star, and from a con
test with both teams on the offensive,
the game changed to a battle with the
Santa Clara fifteen battering forward,
and the Stanford squad bravely fight
ing every inch of the way.
Injuries Frequent.
Injuries or a minor nature were
frequent, especially on the Cardinal
team, as the opposing players drove
hard at the smaller and weaker fif
teen. Cass went in for Angell and
McCartney replaced Tilton, making
seventeen men for the Executive Com
mittee to grant numerals to. Santa
Clara scored twice in the second half,
Muldoon missing both attempts at
conversion. The first try came about
when Joerg fumbled Larkin's poor
pass, giving McKecknie a chance to
get under way. The five-eighths star
passed to Don, who went across for
the second score. The final count
came after a ruck in the last minute
of the game, McCarthy flinging him
self over for an easy try.
Outclassed, outweighed, and in real
ity outgeneraled from the start, the
Stanford team was forced to acknowl
edge defeat, but in the amount of
fight and gameness displayed, the
Cardinal "babes" took the palm.
They fought all the way, never giving
up, and always attempting to give the
University a victory with the cards
stacked against them.

"They played a wonderful same
with heavy odds against them, and I
am very proud of every member of the
team, and also of the substitutes that
helped make the team what it was."
These were „the words of football
coach Floyd Brown, immediately after
the game between the Stanford fresh
men and the University of Santa
Clara freshmen, played on the Card
inal turf, last Saturday.
Although the game ended with the
local 1920 aggregation on the short
end of a 9 to 0 score, every one of
the three thousand rooters who
swarmed to the bleachers for the
spectacular rugby card, had nothing
but praise for the losing team.
Cardinals Swoop.
With the band playing, and the
stands responding to the gestures of
the yell leaders, referee Peter Flan
nigan started the feature contest at
3:15. The Stanford fifteen swooped
down with a rush, and looked danger
ous lor the first few minutes, but be
fore the play had gone far, it was evi
dent that the Santa Clara team was the
better of the two squads.
After sixteen minutes of thrilling
rugby, in which time Campbell, Need
ham, liarneson. Larkin, and Angell
won their way into the hearts of the
Cardinal pigskin followers by their
splendid defensive work, the Mission
Town team got under way for the
first score of the contest. McKecknie
intercepted a pass by Rogers, ran
thirty yards, and transferred to Cap
tain Muldoon, who went over for the
first touchdown. Muldoon failed to
convert his try, leaving the score 3
to 0.
Buttle Royal.
From then 011 until the whistle that
ended the first half, the contest was
a battle royal. It surged from one end
of the field to the other, but was in
the Stanford territory most of the
time. Larkin featured with some
clever runs, regardless of a painful
ankle, while Rogers aided the cause
with timely boots to touch. The half
ended with 110 more scores being
marked up, although Muldoon was
nearly successful in an attempt at a
goal kick on a penalty.
With Palmtag at Eisert's place for
Santa Clara, the second period started
with a rush. The weight of the visit
ing team began to count, and in con
trast with the Stanford backlield, the
Mission speed artists passed the ball
with brilliancy. Muldoon, Don, and

"They played a wonderful same
with heavy odds against them, and I
am very proud of every member of the
team, and also of the substitutes that
helped make the team what it was."
These were „the words of football
coach Floyd Brown, immediately after
the game between the Stanford fresh
men and the University of Santa
Clara freshmen, played on the Card
inal turf, last Saturday.
Although the game ended with the
local 1920 aggregation on the short
end of a 9 to 0 score, every one of
the three thousand rooters who
swarmed to the bleachers for the
spectacular rugby card, had nothing
but praise for the losing team.
Cardinals Swoop.
With the band playing, and the
stands responding to the gestures of
the yell leaders, referee Peter Flan
nigan started the feature contest at
3:15. The Stanford fifteen swooped
down with a rush, and looked danger
ous lor the first few minutes, but be
fore the play had gone far, it was evi
dent that the Santa Clara team was the
better of the two squads.
After sixteen minutes of thrilling
rugby, in which time Campbell, Need
ham, liarneson. Larkin, and Angell
won their way into the hearts of the
Cardinal pigskin followers by their
splendid defensive work, the Mission
Town team got under way for the
first score of the contest. McKecknie
intercepted a pass by Rogers, ran
thirty yards, and transferred to Cap
tain Muldoon, who went over for the
first touchdown. Muldoon failed to
convert his try, leaving the score 3
to 0.
Buttle Royal.
From then 011 until the whistle that
ended the first half, the contest was
a battle royal. It surged from one end
of the field to the other, but was in
the Stanford territory most of the
time. Larkin featured with some
clever runs, regardless of a painful
ankle, while Rogers aided the cause
with timely boots to touch. The half
ended with 110 more scores being
marked up, although Muldoon was
nearly successful in an attempt at a
goal kick on a penalty.
With Palmtag at Eisert's place for
Santa Clara, the second period started
with a rush. The weight of the visit
ing team began to count, and in con
trast with the Stanford backlield, the
Mission speed artists passed the ball
with brilliancy. Muldoon, Don, and
Vincini of the forwards greatly as
sisted Berndt and McKecknie in pass
ing rushes goalward. Their teamwork
improved, showing the effects of the
excellent coaching of Charlie Austin,
former Stanford star, and from a con
test with both teams on the offensive,
the game changed to a battle with the
Santa Clara fifteen battering forward,
and the Stanford squad bravely fight
ing every inch of the way.
Injuries Frequent.
Injuries or a minor nature were
frequent, especially on the Cardinal
team, as the opposing players drove
hard at the smaller and weaker fif
teen. Cass went in for Angell and
McCartney replaced Tilton, making
seventeen men for the Executive Com
mittee to grant numerals to. Santa
Clara scored twice in the second half,
Muldoon missing both attempts at
conversion. The first try came about
when Joerg fumbled Larkin's poor
pass, giving McKecknie a chance to
get under way. The five-eighths star
passed to Don, who went across for
the second score. The final count
came after a ruck in the last minute
of the game, McCarthy flinging him
self over for an easy try.
Outclassed, outweighed, and in real
ity outgeneraled from the start, the
Stanford team was forced to acknowl
edge defeat, but in the amount of
fight and gameness displayed, the
Cardinal "babes" took the palm.
They fought all the way, never giving
up, and always attempting to give the
University a victory with the cards
stacked against them.
Varsity Defeats I*. A. A. 0.
Foil owing the freshmen game, the
varsity met the fast Palo Alto Athletic
Club in a hard contest. Finishing in
the dark, the Stanford players rung

tacular playing featured the game,
with the university men winning he
cause of superior condition, although
Coach Drown used all the available
substitutes.
Carroll, Scott, and Winham scored
in the first half for the varsity, 'Dink"
Templeton converting two of the trvs.
Stolz went over for the Athletic Club,
"Ric" Templeton sending the ball be
tween the posts for two more points.
The first period ended without fur

the game between the Stanford fresh
men and the University of Santa
Clara freshmen, played on the Card
inal turf, last Saturday.
Although the game ended with the
local 1920 aggregation on the short
end of a 9 to 0 score, every one of
the three thousand rooters who
swarmed to the bleachers for the
spectacular rugby card, had nothing
but praise for the losing team.
Cardinals Swoop.
With the band playing, and the
stands responding to the gestures of
the yell leaders, referee Peter Flan
nigan started the feature contest at
3:15. The Stanford fifteen swooped
down with a rush, and looked danger
ous lor the first few minutes, but be
fore the play had gone far, it was evi
dent that the Santa Clara team was the
better of the two squads.
After sixteen minutes of thrilling
rugby, in which time Campbell, Need
ham, liarneson. Larkin, and Angell
won their way into the hearts of the
Cardinal pigskin followers by their
splendid defensive work, the Mission
Town team got under way for the
first score of the contest. McKecknie
intercepted a pass by Rogers, ran
thirty yards, and transferred to Cap
tain Muldoon, who went over for the
first touchdown. Muldoon failed to
convert his try, leaving the score 3
to 0.
Buttle Royal.
From then 011 until the whistle that
ended the first half, the contest was
a battle royal. It surged from one end
of the field to the other, but was in
the Stanford territory most of the
time. Larkin featured with some
clever runs, regardless of a painful
ankle, while Rogers aided the cause
with timely boots to touch. The half
ended with 110 more scores being
marked up, although Muldoon was
nearly successful in an attempt at a
goal kick on a penalty.
With Palmtag at Eisert's place for
Santa Clara, the second period started
with a rush. The weight of the visit
ing team began to count, and in con
trast with the Stanford backlield, the
Mission speed artists passed the ball
with brilliancy. Muldoon, Don, and
Vincini of the forwards greatly as
sisted Berndt and McKecknie in pass
ing rushes goalward. Their teamwork
improved, showing the effects of the
excellent coaching of Charlie Austin,
former Stanford star, and from a con
test with both teams on the offensive,
the game changed to a battle with the
Santa Clara fifteen battering forward,
and the Stanford squad bravely fight
ing every inch of the way.
Injuries Frequent.
Injuries or a minor nature were
frequent, especially on the Cardinal
team, as the opposing players drove
hard at the smaller and weaker fif
teen. Cass went in for Angell and
McCartney replaced Tilton, making
seventeen men for the Executive Com
mittee to grant numerals to. Santa
Clara scored twice in the second half,
Muldoon missing both attempts at
conversion. The first try came about
when Joerg fumbled Larkin's poor
pass, giving McKecknie a chance to
get under way. The five-eighths star
passed to Don, who went across for
the second score. The final count
came after a ruck in the last minute
of the game, McCarthy flinging him
self over for an easy try.
Outclassed, outweighed, and in real
ity outgeneraled from the start, the
Stanford team was forced to acknowl
edge defeat, but in the amount of
fight and gameness displayed, the
Cardinal "babes" took the palm.
They fought all the way, never giving
up, and always attempting to give the
University a victory with the cards
stacked against them.
Varsity Defeats I*. A. A. 0.
Foil owing the freshmen game, the
varsity met the fast Palo Alto Athletic
Club in a hard contest. Finishing in
the dark, the Stanford players rung
al9 to 8 defeat on the clubmen. Spec
tacular playing featured the game,
with the university men winning he
cause of superior condition, although
Coach Drown used all the available
substitutes.
Carroll, Scott, and Winham scored
in the first half for the varsity, 'Dink"
Templeton converting two of the trvs.
Stolz went over for the Athletic Club,
"Ric" Templeton sending the ball be
tween the posts for two more points.
The first period ended without fur
ther scoring, the board reading 13 to
5. In the second half, Sample and
Chandler scored for Stanford, while
Hammon, after a long run, tallied for
the opponents. The game was ex
citing all the way, and was resplend
ant with brilliant plays.
As a curtain-raiser to the main
event of the day's football, Lowell
high school defeated San Jose high
school by an 8 to 0 tally. The game

but furnished a great, deal of amuse
ment for those who arrived early.
