# BASKET SHOOTING
## 
### 
Things just around the corner that
one stumbles over by a mere chance
of fate invariably lead one into realms
of interest and entertainment. It is
the unanticipated llip of a coin that
transforms world-weary surfeited in
dividuals into wide-awake, thinking
human beings. This afternoon, suf
ferers from callousness, who lament
the lack of novelty, may find a refuge
in the interclub basketball tourney,
which is slated to initiate the season.
********
Twenty-four quintets have thus far
signified their intention of competing
for honors, thereby shattering all pre
vious records for preliminary hostil
ities. Organizations still unrepresented
in competition should not overlook the
opportunity of placing a team in the
field, while fives which have already
entered the lists should take care to
avoid defaulting. Arrangements have
been completed so as to offer an ex
cellent chance for an inexperienced
team to annex the championship.

Basketball commences in earnest
the Monday following the intercol
legiate rugby match with Santa Clara,
which is a little over three weeks
distant. Last semester, when block
letters were awarded members of the
Stanford quintet, the sport proved a
headlincr, ranking with other major
games, after occupying a shelf posi
tion for years. With the aid of an ex
pert coach, a large squad of candi
dates, and a splendid schedule includ
ing Washington, Oregon, Nevada, and
California, a bright outlook for the
season is guaranteed.
********
Exceptional possibilities lie in the
interclub tussle which begins today
and continues throughout the week,
for enlivening Ihe game, swelling fu
ture squads, and building up a strong
varsity quintet. Whether or not an
organization ever caught a glimpse
of a basket-shooter, it should at least
enter a team of bridge players, or
horse-shoe throwers. Amusement,
sport, and exercise derived will aid in
the final termination of a successful
and prosperous season.
