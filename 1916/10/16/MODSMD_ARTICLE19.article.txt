Surprises were frequent in the Stan
lord-Santa Clara frosh game. One of
the many was the tackling of the
Stanford freshmen baekfield. Their
chief weakness throughout the sea
son has been their inability to get
their man, but Saturday, Needham,
Rogers, Campbell and the rest were
tackling like fiends. When they
nailed their man, he was put down to
stay.
The home players were handicapped
by the loss of Jay Risling. More than
one fan on the lines, Saturday, de
cided that Jay's swerving rushes could
have been the only single thing to
combat the sure tackling and accurate
passing of the Santa Clara backs.
Similarly, a goodly number of fans
now realize how important Otto Lacli
raund's swerves will be on November
11.
Fans turned out in strength to see
the contest. They were not disap
pointed. The Santa Clara freshmen
played a clean, live game, and did
a lot to smear an all-too-prevalent
notion around here that the rivals up
the prune belt cannot play as whole
some a contest as can Stanford. They
can and do, or did.
Charlie Austin has taught the Mis
sionites how to utilize the baekfield.
Spectacular passing is not often seen
as a by-product of a Santa Clara team.
Usually the Santa Clara way is to
push the way to the goal line by ap
plication of beef. Now the Catholics
pass.
"Red" Hauser becoming too ener
getic and enthused Saturday, for
got he was standing on a narrow
place while officiating as yell leader,
consequently "Red" took a little back
ward tumble to the turf below. Yell
ing on "Red's" part was therefore a
little weak for a few minutes.
Santa Clara frosh entered the game
Saturday at the start of both halves
with their legs thoroughly covered
with grease. Presumably, the idea
was modelled after the old greasy pig
idea—hard to catch and hold, but this
did not hinder the Cardinal frosh in
their tackling.
Dick Wright, fullback for the Palo
Alto athletic boys, appeared to good
advantage against the varsity. Ht is a
College of Pacific player, and rated as
one of the best fullbacks on the coast.
It is rumored that he will transfer
to Stanford next year, being a fresh
man at C. P. now.
The Templeton trio was on deck
Saturday. "Ric" represented the fam
ily as five-eighths for "Pally," "Dink"
as varsity fullback, while "Mutt" held
down a job as linesman.
Santa Clara rooters remaining for
the varsity game were outspoken root
ers for the club boys.
"Rud" Larkin, with his ankle in good'
condition, might possibly have gotten
away a couple of times, Saturday, for
a long run and score. For a man
with an ankle which was not expected
to last a third of the game, he put up
a game fight through its entirety.
"Eddie" Strain, freshman fullback,
is a martyr. "Eddie" sat on the side
lines ready to be called to take "Bud"
Larkin's berth, if the lattcr's ankle
gave out. It didn't, and the official
freshmen fullback missed his numer
als by a fluke of fate.
Fillmore Sample was back in at
front rank in the varsity contest after
being out of the game for several
weeks on account of an eye injury.

pass.
"Red" Hauser becoming too ener
getic and enthused Saturday, for
got he was standing on a narrow
place while officiating as yell leader,
consequently "Red" took a little back
ward tumble to the turf below. Yell
ing on "Red's" part was therefore a
little weak for a few minutes.
Santa Clara frosh entered the game
Saturday at the start of both halves
with their legs thoroughly covered
with grease. Presumably, the idea
was modelled after the old greasy pig
idea—hard to catch and hold, but this
did not hinder the Cardinal frosh in
their tackling.
Dick Wright, fullback for the Palo
Alto athletic boys, appeared to good
advantage against the varsity. Ht is a
College of Pacific player, and rated as
one of the best fullbacks on the coast.
It is rumored that he will transfer
to Stanford next year, being a fresh
man at C. P. now.
The Templeton trio was on deck
Saturday. "Ric" represented the fam
ily as five-eighths for "Pally," "Dink"
as varsity fullback, while "Mutt" held
down a job as linesman.
Santa Clara rooters remaining for
the varsity game were outspoken root
ers for the club boys.
"Rud" Larkin, with his ankle in good'
condition, might possibly have gotten
away a couple of times, Saturday, for
a long run and score. For a man
with an ankle which was not expected
to last a third of the game, he put up
a game fight through its entirety.
"Eddie" Strain, freshman fullback,
is a martyr. "Eddie" sat on the side
lines ready to be called to take "Bud"
Larkin's berth, if the lattcr's ankle
gave out. It didn't, and the official
freshmen fullback missed his numer
als by a fluke of fate.
Fillmore Sample was back in at
front rank in the varsity contest after
being out of the game for several
weeks on account of an eye injury.
Surprises were frequent in the Stan
lord-Santa Clara frosh game. One of
the many was the tackling of the
Stanford freshmen baekfield. Their
chief weakness throughout the sea
son has been their inability to get
their man, but Saturday, Needham,
Rogers, Campbell and the rest were
tackling like fiends. When they
nailed their man, he was put down to
stay.
The home players were handicapped
by the loss of Jay Risling. More than
one fan on the lines, Saturday, de
cided that Jay's swerving rushes could
have been the only single thing to
combat the sure tackling and accurate
passing of the Santa Clara backs.
Similarly, a goodly number of fans
now realize how important Otto Lacli
raund's swerves will be on November
11.
Fans turned out in strength to see
the contest. They were not disap
pointed. The Santa Clara freshmen
played a clean, live game, and did
a lot to smear an all-too-prevalent
notion around here that the rivals up
the prune belt cannot play as whole
some a contest as can Stanford. They
can and do, or did.
Charlie Austin has taught the Mis
sionites how to utilize the baekfield.
Spectacular passing is not often seen
as a by-product of a Santa Clara team.
Usually the Santa Clara way is to
push the way to the goal line by ap
plication of beef. Now the Catholics
pass.
