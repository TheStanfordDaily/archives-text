# Raise Junior Quad Dues. Says Manager
## 
### 
That Junior Quad dues will soon be
raised from the present five dollars,
on account of the abolition of Quad
advertising, is the opinion of Man
ager Foster Weeks, '18. Weeks an
nounces that this probable change
will not affect those who have paid
their dues already, and that if the re
maining juniors pay their dues im
mediately and have their pictures
taken at Davey's, they will not be
subjected to the extra assessment.
November 15 has been set as the
last day for juniors to come in under
the present rate and he photographed
for the 1918 yearbook. Three dollars
will be the cost of the book to the
public.
An important meeting of the 1918
Quad staff will be held at the Kappa
Alpha Theta house, Tuesday evening.
