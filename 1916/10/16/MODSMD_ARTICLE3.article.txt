# Rugby Is Funny ..As U.C. Sees It
## 
### 
Stanford's rugby prospects were
made the butt of much ridicule by
the Californians at their Pajama
rino Rally last week, in two short
acts.
The first was entitled "The End
of the Trail," after the famous
statue at the Exposition, in which
a wearer of the Block S, head
sunk upon his chest and a foot
ball tucked under his arm, rode
slowly out upon the stage upon a
drooping old nag.
The second was a thrust at the
financial end of the situation. A
bleachers of very limited capacity
held a dozen or so rooters who
cheered daintily at the antics of
the football team, a one man ag
gregation, who had a fine time
jumping around and throwing the
ball in the air. This was the 191G
season. When the lights were
again turned on and the 1917 sea
son shown, only the bleachers re
mained , the team and rooters
having departed.
