## 
###

backfield, coupled with brilliant work
by their forwards, proved too much
for the club men. Captain Milburn,
Connors, Winston, Diaz, and Fowler
starred for the Mission Town boys.

was that the Olympics were again
unable to cross the Santa Clara line
and that as yet this year no one has
made a try against the Santa Clarans.
The Stanford varsity was able to
down this same Olympic squad only
39 to 1(> in the contest of one week
ago.
