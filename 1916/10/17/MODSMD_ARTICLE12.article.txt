Five members from among the fra

pointed by O. G. Lachmund, '17, will
meet this evening at the Alpha Tan
Omega house to draw up some tenta
tive rules to govern rushing. The en
tire question of second semester
pledging from the fraternity stand
point will be discussed, but it is ex

fraternities will take place at some
later date at a meeting of the entire
body of fraternity representatives.
