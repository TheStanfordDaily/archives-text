## Inter-Fraternity and Inter-Club Series Opens With Two One-Sided Games 
### 
Chi Psi and Phi Gamma Delta bas
ketball shooters were victorious yes
terday in the first games of the inter
fraternity interclnb basketball series.
In the first game called, the Phi
Gamma Delta five walloped the Phi
Kappa Psi to a tune of 31 to 8, fol
lowed by a 22 to 10 win for Chi Psi
over the Breakers Club.
The Phi Gamma Delta team, owing
to their weight and speed, and a num
ber of star players, had the edge on
their opponents throughout the en
tire game, having a 3 to 13 lead at
the end of the first half, and piling it
up to 31 to 8 in the second. Poyd
ston and Sullivan were conspicuous
stars for the winning five, the for
mer shooting seven goals and Sulli
van at guard offering an almost im
pregnable defense whenever the ball
approached his opponents' goal. Ham
secured five of the losing team's
points, shooting two goals and one
free throw.
The second game, between the
Breakers and the Chi Psi representa
tives was more evenly contested.
Owing to the failure of a number of
the eating club's best players to enter
until near the end of the first half,
the fraternity five had a 14 to 1 lead
at half time. In the second period
the club took a brace and secured
.<-ix points to their opponents' eight.
Wallace at forward and Sheldon at
center were the heaviest point win
ners, taking between them, IS of the
fraternities' total score. For the
breakers tlio two Mason brothers at j
the forward positions displayed a j
large amount of speed and team
work.
