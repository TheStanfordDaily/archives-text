This University lias always prided
herself on her democracy, family life,
and broad, communistic spirit, which
has rendered the name Stanford sy
nonymous for western equality and
open-hearted affability. Yet, us one
ponders over the matter, doubts and
queries assail the mind, questioning
the truth of the reputation. Perhaps
a revered tradition is waning, or rep
resents a high-sounding but empty
phraseology.

Investigation by social reformers
would be unnecessary to bring to
light the fact that the average stu
dent never is acquainted- with more
than a score of his own caste, whether
that be club or fraternity. We stroll
along in our own rut, ingrained with
a narrow feeling of self-satisfaction.
The old adage—There is so much good
in the worst of us, and so much bad
in the best of us—we seem wont to
overlook. Value of transforming pro
vincial ideas, worth of meeting and
knowing men, and regard for genuine
friendship, are but partially appre
ciated.

A panacea that would prove effect

reserve may be found in the intro
duction of biennial class smokers,
which misht be held either in the
Union or Encina Hall. The plan is
fertile with possibilities for obtaining
closer relationships among men of
the university, through the free and
easy-going spirit that is embodied in
the get-togethers. There is nothing
comparable to entertainment, re
freshments, plus clouds of blue smoke,-
for unloosening the heart strings.

Another feature, which enjoys but
scant favor, is the interclub and fra

upperclassmen of the respective
groups dining together. When ming
ling on mutual grounds of hunger
around the table, red tape blocking
immediate friendships is snipped ef

attempt to arrange exchange dinners
with all other units, the result would

When it comes to rock bottom, we
are too prone to pick faults in
strangers without making an attempt
