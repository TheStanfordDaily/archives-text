# Third Varsity Meets Freshmen Tomorrow
## No Admission to Be Required for This Midweek Rugby Contest 
### 
Although the big game for the fresh
men team is over and the seventeen
men who played have earned their
numerals, the football schedule calls
for several more contests in which the
1020 fifteen will participate. The
third Cardinal varsity will be the
opponents in the usual midweek rugby
tangle to be played on the Stanford
field tomorrow.

The game will be callcd at 4:30,
no charge being made for the contest
between the two Stanford teams,
Yell Leader "Mill" Gilroy is trying
to work up enthusiasm for the Big
Game with Santa Clara, and is anx
ious that the bleachers be better filled
than has been the case for the past
Wednesday games. The new songs
will be tried out, and it is hoped that
some spirit can be aroused.
Coach Brown will in all probability
use the same lineup that he used in
the game against Santa Clara, except
Larkin stood the Santa Clara test re
strain playing behind the scrum.
Lrakin stood the Santa Clara test re
markably well for one with a badly
injured ankle, but it is best that he
should rest now.
Aubert, Rarneson, and Wayland
make up the front rank, Martin and
Millington hold up the middle rank,
while Snook, Tilton, and Gardner
complete the scrum in the rear rank.
Strain at half, .Toerg at fist five, An
gell, if his injury will permit him to
play, at. second five, Strong in the
three-quarter berth, and Needham and
Rogers on the wings, make up a good
defensive backfield and a fairly good
scoring machine. Campbell holds
down the last line of defense in ex
cellent shape.
