# OFFERS TRIP BACK TO OLD BROADWAY
## CHANCE TO SEE N.Y, Tickets for Three Plays and Entrance Behind Scenes Are on Program 
### 
A trip lo old Broadway, a commu
tation ticket good for three different
plays, and a personally conducted
sight-seeing trip hack of tiie scenes
along the bright lights, is the triple
attraction in store for Stanford people
who take advantage of the opportun
ity now offered them.
November J?, Date of Trip.
November 3 is the date set for the
transcontinental journey. In consid
eration of the demand, accommoda
tions are to be put on sale but four
days before the date of sailing.
"The Wallop," "Dora's Dilemma,"
are two of the plays which are to be
seen. The third is the "Show Shop,"
or rather, it is in the four acts of
"The Show Shop" that "The Wallop"
and "Dora's Dilemma" are contained.
Furthermore, within the* four sections
of cleverness in James Forbes' com
edy is found the equivalent of a trip
to Broadway and a prolonged visit
into the mysteries of life behind the
footlights.
"Behind the Scenes" Play.
That is why "The Show Shop" was
successful in a long New York run.
Forbes' romantic comedy is a story of
j tlio inside of the theatrical business,
and makes its strong plea because it
reveals human nature from behind a
mask of grease paint. Forbes wrote
iin the idiomatic dialogue of the
Broadway stage, the language of the
scene-shifter and the chorus girl.
"The Show Shop" rings true.
With atmosphere of Broadway of
today, the 1910 Sophomore play is
something of a departure from the
usual run of second year productions.
Each of its five scenes is a novelty in
itself, with act one in the office of
Max Rosenbaum play magnate; act
two in the parlor of the Palace City
Hotel, where the company of "The
Wallop" has stranded; act the third
during a rehearsal of "Dora's Dilem
ma," and the climax of that drama on
the opening night, and act four in
the bachelor apartments of the newly
I made star, the hero of "Dora's
Dilemma."
