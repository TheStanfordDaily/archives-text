# Bell Will Address Economics Students
## Conditions of Housing in Labor Camps Subject of Talk Thursday 
### 
George L. Bell, executive secretary
of the California Commission of Im
migration and Housing, will address
the students of the Economics depart
ment in the Little Theater, Thursday,
at 11 o'clock, the regular assembly
hour.
Conditions of immigration and hous
ing in labor camps in California have
been the subject of much investiga
tion by this commission, and as a re
sult they have collected some very
valuable information along these
lines. The work has been under the
active supervision of Mr. Bell, so the
material will be given first hand by
the man most interested.
Mr. Bell will bring some slides that
have been taken in the course of the
work, and these will be shown in con
nection with his lecture. There will
be no regular assembly on Thursday,
giving every student an opportunity
to be present for the address.
