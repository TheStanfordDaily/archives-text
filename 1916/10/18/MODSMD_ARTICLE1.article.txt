# NOVEMBER 22 SET FOR U.S.C. DEBATE
## ON STANFORD CAMPUS "No-Decision" Contest Against California to Follow on November 24 
### 
Stanford debaters will clash with
those of the University of Southern
California on this campus, Wednes
day evening, November 22, Debating
Coach K. E. Leib, '15, announced to
day, following the receipt of a letter
from the U. S. C. committee in regard
to the date. The Little Theater will
probably not be large enough to hold
the crowd that it is anticipated will
attend this intercollegiate forensic
contest, and hence the Assembly Hall
may be used.
Just Before 1. C. Debate.
This debate will come two nights
before that with the University of
California, Friday evening, November
21, in San Francisco. Both will be on
the same question, "Resolved, That
the United States should adopt the
Swiss system of compulsory military
training."
An important difference between the
two platform events will be that a de
cision will be rendered by judges on
that with the U. S. C„ while the "no
decision" plan will be tried out on
the California contest. A prominent
public man will be secured to sum
up the arguments of the two teams,
and present his own views at the close
of the latter debate. It is hoped to
broaden the interest in this contest
and increase its educational value,
by this scheme.
I'. C. Team To Visit,
Members of California's squad
will visit the campus, Friday, to set
tle upon the main issues of the ques
tion, in order to insure a clean-cut
clash of opinion in the debate. Stan
