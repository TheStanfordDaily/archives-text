by walking away from their oppon
ents, Delta Tau Delta and Japanese
Club, with scores of 32 to 2 and 31 to
7, respectively.
Team Work Wilis.
Early in (lie game it looked as if
the fraternities were pretty evenly
matched, both as to weight and speed.

but before many minutes of play had
elapsed it could be seen that the Phi i
Kappa Sigma aggregation had the edge |
on their opponents in the matter of
team work and the accuracy with
which they located the basket.
Gibson, as forward, was the prin
cipal point winner of the game, shoot
ing nearly every goal he attempted,
and scoring IS points for his team.
1). IT. Height Counts.
Delta Upsilon, owing to their height
and weight, had little difficulty in
winning over the speedy Japanese
Club. For the most part the hall
centered around the fraternity men's
goal, where Carver and McCloskey
conveyed it to the basket with seem
ingly little difficulty. The Japanese,
however, put up a game fight, and
would have undoubtedly shown up
much better against a team nearer
their own size.
