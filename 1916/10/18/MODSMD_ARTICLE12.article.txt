# PLAN MEMORIAL TO PROFESSOR PELLISSIER
## CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED Ambulance to Be Purchased for Field Service in Europe With Stanford Fund 
### 
To do honor to the memory of Pro
fessor R. E. Pellissier by establishing
a concrete testimonial to the self
sacrifice of a Stanford man, who lost
his life fighting for his native land in
the European war, is the object of a
campaign to raise a fund, to be
known as "The Pellissier Memorial
Fund," for the purchase and main
tenance of an ambulance on the
French front for one year.
Killed at Front.
Professor Pellissier, who was killed
in the Battle of the Somme, on Aug
ust 29, while fighting with the French
army, had worked up from an instruc
torship in the French department to
the post of associate professor. Al
though with a great love for his work
here, which was shown by many let
ters which lie wrote expressing a wish
to be back at his life occupation at
Stanford, Professor Pellissier never
theless sacrificed what seemed to be
a brilliant future to engage in what
he considered a work of duty. He left
here in August, 1914, and remained at
the front until his untimely death.
Other Colleges in Work.
The cost of purchasing and maintain
ing an ambulance as has been pro
posed, will be $1600.00. A number of
other American universities have
taken up the idea of establishing an
ambulance for field service work in
the war, among them being Columbia,
University of Chicago, Harvard, Yale,
Princeton, and the College of the City
of New York.
Although no soliciting has been car
ried on as yet, the sum of $200.00 has
been spontaneously contributed by
friends of Professor Pellissier, who
have appreciated the high ideals
which actuated his work. The ex
ecutive committee in charge of the
campaign, which will be closed by
November 10, are Professor O. M.
Johnston, Professor H. R. Fairclough,
Professor A. M. Cathcart, Professor
P. A. Martin, and Student Adviser W.
P. Staniford. Preliminary plans to
raise the sum among faculty, students
and outsiders will be taken up at a
meeting of the committee tomorrow
afternoon.
