# CLASS OF 'TWENTY
## 
### 
A state of semi-hysteria and unlim
ited zest, once a by-product of univer
sity s])ort, in recent years has become
indispensable to intercollegiate ath
letics, rendering rooters' activities an
inseparable feature. Stanford, a few
years ago, adopted the custom where
by the neck might be blown off bot
tled enthusiasm —namely, the intro
duction of the serpentine around the
freshmen bonfire at the Thursday
evening rally previous to the Big
Game.

Skull cap wearers are scheduled to
assemble tomorrow afternoon for the
purpose of organizing plans, which
must result in the hasty erection of
the traditional pyre. It behooves
every first year student to attend in
person the class meeting in order to
acquire a definite knowledge of in
dividual requirements.

Owing to the fact that work has
been postponed until this late in the
semester, unusual industry and steady
application must characterize the ef
forts of Nineteen-Twenty. Less than
three weeks remain in which to as
semble the material, and put the tim
ber into place, in truth a mammoth
task. • Hereafter every freshman
should plan to sacrifice a few sub
sidiary interests and devote a fair
proportion of time toward construc
tion of Santa Clara's holocaust.
