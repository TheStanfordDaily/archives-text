# Varsity Downs Fast Berkeley Ruggers
## High School Fifteen Affords Cardinals Good Evening Workout 
### 
Providing good competition for the
Stanford varsity, but outclassed in
weight and experience, "Ric" Temple
ton's Berkeley high school ruggers
lost to the Stanford varsity by a 29
to 0 score, yesterday.
Referee 1 tort West started the con
test promptly at 4:40. Owing to the
fact that a couple of the school lads
were unable to make the journey
down, "Ric" went in as half and Need
ham was loaned as a wing.
Laeliiminri and Carroll Sliit't.
Coach Brown shifted Lachmund and
Carroll in the backfleld, yesterday, the
former playing center-three, while
Danny moved up to second-five. This
change in the combination seemed
effective, as the varsity backfleld ex
ecuted many pretty passing rushes.
The Berkeley lads are due mention in
regard to this feature, too, for although
not performing so many, they did give
several glimpses of how a backfleld
ought to work.
"Pretty* Makes First Try.
"Pretty" Lachmund made the first
try, taking the ball over after a splen
did passing rush from Walker, to
Wark, to Carroll, "Dink" Ternpleton
converting.
When play was resumed, Berkeley
annoyed the varsity for a few
moments, forcing the ball down to
the 10-yard line. Stanford rushed the
ball back, and, taking a pass from
Walker, Carroll made a 50-yard run
for a try, Ternpleton again convert
ing, making the score 10 to 0 at the
end of the first half.
Weight and experience told in the
second half, for the varsity started
scoring at once. Carroll, Wilkins,
Murray, Chandler, and Marriott made
the scores of this half, Ternpleton
converting two of them.
