# DR. PERCIVAL LOWELL, WHO ADVANCES THEORY THAT MARS IS INHABITED PLANET.
## EARTH DUE TO BE EXTINCT PLANET SAYS ASTRONOMER 
### 
In accordance with his theory of
planet life, evolved as a result of his
study of the celestial bodies, in his
laboratory at Flagstaff, Arizona, Dr.
Percival Lowell, in his lecture on
"The Far Horizon of Science," told
an overflowing audience in the Little
Theater, last night, how it is possible
that all life on this earth will ulti
mately become extinct, as has oc
'curred on Venus, Mercury, and other
bodies.

Dr. Lowell told how planets have a
life history, as have human beings,
beginning in a chaotic condition, pass
ing into a condition of highest life,
and then gradually reaching old age.
Neptune, according to the well
known astronomer, is the youngest of
the planets in the solar system; Mars
is in a stage most like that of the
earth, and Mercury has reached the
period of degeneracy.
Referring to habitation on Mars,
Dr. Lowell's words were: "Our ob
servations have convinced us without
a doubt that the lines on Mars which
have caused so much discussion, are
canals. There is some form of in
telligence on Mars. I do not mean
human beings, but some intellect cap
able of accomplishing these feats."
Science first became interested in
man himself; then in the earth itself,
and is now gradually reaching out to
wider horizons, Dr. Lowell explained.
And because the student will not be
taught these newer things of science
until they have become history, the
astronomer criticised prevailing edu
cational systems.
"Some people seem to think that re
cently discovered facts are too homeo
pathic for youth, and that such ideas
must not be given to youthful stu
dents until they are so old that they ,
are nearly worn out," said Dr. Lowell. I
"But 1 believe in giving young people |
the newest things which can be found
in no other place."
