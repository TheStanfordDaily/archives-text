# STAGE FRIGHT IS FEARED BY MISSION TOWN COACH
## 
### N.H. Petree, '19 
Experimenting is about at an end
in the rival rugby camps of Stanford
and Santa Clara. The squads have
been cut down, strict training rules
with the men on the training tables
established, and both teams are now
on the home stretch, driving forward
to the final goal, the Hig Game on
November 11. The last three weeks of
practice will be devoted largely to
perfecting team play, so essential in
an intercollegiate sport.
After several visits to the Mission
Town football field, training quarters,
and training table, the writer has a
definite conception, perhaps erroneous,
of the prominent differences and com
parisons between the wearers of the
Cardinal and those of the Red and
White.
Austin Some Developer.
Charlie Austin has developed a
wonderful fifteen, with but sixty men

to choose from. His squad is com
posed of fighters, who put all they
have into the game, never slowing up
until the final whistle blows. They
are big men, and look to outweigh
Stanford at least five pounds to the
man.
Austin is going to play a "2-3-2"
scrum formation, with a wing for
ward, in the Big Game, something that
has not been done in an intercollegiate
contest for some time. He defends
his choice of the style of play in the
following words: "Every club that
has played the Cardinal this season
lias demonstrated that this formation
is better than the old Australian
"3-2-3" style that Stanford sticks to.
The scrum packs better, and a clever
wing forward will break up a major
ity of the opponent's plays."
Santa Clara is not overconfident,
but the excellent showing that their
jteam lias made in the games so far
this season, has given them high
hopes of victory in the banner con
test. Austin believes that but few
points, perhaps three, will separate
th final scores of the two teams. He
says that "stage fright" is the big
thing that he is afraid of, as Stan
ford players are more accustomed to
Big Games than are his men. He
cites the freshmen game of last Sat
urday and the final game of last year
as an example of this.
S. C. Lineup a Problem.
The final Santa Clara lineup is still
problematical, but from hints dropped
by the coach and the other men in a
position to know, it looks as if the team
will take the field in the following
order: Howell and Curtin in front
rank, with a possibility of O'Neil dis
placing Curtin; J. Muldoon will lock
the scrum, W. Muldoon and Don will
fill the breakaway berths, with
Hickey and Coschina completing the
scrum in the rear rank. Korte may
beat Hickey o-.t, as the big fellow is
cn the injured list.
IHuk and Winston.
"Dumpy" Diaz is a cinch for half
back, as is Winston for wing forward,
although there has been some thought
of bringing Benny Fitzpatrick in to
handle this important position. Fow
ler will play first five-eighths, and up
to last week it looked as though
Herndt would play the other five
eighths position. Le√üourveau may
be placed here, however, and Berndt
shifted to center-three, where Fitz
patrick has played during the season.
Milburn and Scholz will play the
wings, with Conners and McKecknie
as backfield substitutes.
Bensberg and Wassum are having a
battle royal for the fullback berth,
with the former favored on account
of Wassum's injury to his shoulder
in the first game of the season.
Sailtu Clara Has Ldge.
At the present time, discounting all
scores made in the club games, Santa
! Clara looks to have the edge on the
Stanford varsity. Three weeks can
I make a wonderful change, however,
'and as the same situation existed at
this time last year, the supporters
of the Cardinal are not worrying.
Floyd Brown has not made up his
mind as to the exact composition of
the local fifteen, and is now giving
every man an opportunity to make
good. As soon as he has determined
in his own mind, who are the best
men for the fifteen positions and be
gins to play them with some degree
of regularity, the bleacher-warmers
can be assured of a better brand of
football, with the team working more
as a unit.
