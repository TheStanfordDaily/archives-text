## Former California Captain Is Asked to Play in Game Against Varsity 
### 
An effort is being made by George
Presley, coacli of the All Star foot
ball team, that will meet the Stan
ford varsity next Saturday on the
Cardinal field, to get Amos Elliott,
captain of the University of California
rugby team in 1911, to play with the
invading aggregation.
Elliott a Star.
Elliott is one of the best ruggers
that ever played in this part of the
state, and when with California, was
one of the danger points of their
winning combination. He has been
acting as coach of tlie Stockton high
school team .along with his other
duties as athletic director of the
school, and teacher in the History
department.
Presley Has Strong Squad.
The team gathered together by
Presley will be the strongest fifteen
that Stanford will meet this season,
except Santa Clara in the Big Game.
The men are working out in San
Francisco, and the official lineup will
be announced tomorrow.
Counting substitutes, the Palo Alto
Athletic Club will be well repre
sented on the All Star lineup, Casliel,
Card, Smitlierum, O'Laine, Gladstone,
Davis, Stolz, Templeton, Bihlman, and
Darsie, being signed up by Presley
to tryout for the team. Some of these
men will be on the sidelines, but
quite a number will trot out against
the varsity.
Yell Leader Gilroy is preparing a
line entertainment for the rugby
teams who will take part in the foot
ball barbecue to be held on the turf
Saturday night. Several skits have
been arranged for the occasion, and
some of the campus songsters will
help with a few selections.
Six of the best lambs of the Uni
versity fiock have been sacrificed to
the cause, Sam McDonald, famed chef,
being in charge of this part of the
barbecue.
Graduate Manager Behrens says
that most of the arrangements have
been completed for the games and
the evening's entertainment. The
referees have been selected, Fuller,
Von Monderschied, Flannagan, "Red"
Hauser, and West, being slated to
officiate in the five contests.
Freshmen Victors.
Augmented by Katten of the var
sity squad and Prior of the second
varsity, the freshmen, minus Snook,
Gardner, Larkin, Tilton, Strain, and
Angell, defeated the second varsity
yesterday afternoon by a 4 to 3 score.
The game was a farce from start
to finish. Neither team showed any
class, and but one thirty minute half
was played. Dievendorff scored for
the second varsity, West failing to
convert from an easy angle. With
but a few minutes to play, Campbell
dropped the ball between the posts
from the twenty yard line while it
was in play, scoring four points for
the freshmen, and enough to beat the
wearers of the black.

Yell Leader Gilroy is preparing a
line entertainment for the rugby
teams who will take part in the foot
ball barbecue to be held on the turf
Saturday night. Several skits have
been arranged for the occasion, and
some of the campus songsters will
help with a few selections.
Six of the best lambs of the Uni
versity fiock have been sacrificed to
the cause, Sam McDonald, famed chef,
being in charge of this part of the
barbecue.
Graduate Manager Behrens says
that most of the arrangements have
been completed for the games and
the evening's entertainment. The
referees have been selected, Fuller,
Von Monderschied, Flannagan, "Red"
Hauser, and West, being slated to
officiate in the five contests.
Freshmen Victors.
Augmented by Katten of the var
sity squad and Prior of the second
varsity, the freshmen, minus Snook,
Gardner, Larkin, Tilton, Strain, and
Angell, defeated the second varsity
yesterday afternoon by a 4 to 3 score.
The game was a farce from start
to finish. Neither team showed any
class, and but one thirty minute half
was played. Dievendorff scored for
the second varsity, West failing to
convert from an easy angle. With
but a few minutes to play, Campbell
dropped the ball between the posts
from the twenty yard line while it
was in play, scoring four points for
the freshmen, and enough to beat the
wearers of the black.
An effort is being made by George
Presley, coacli of the All Star foot
ball team, that will meet the Stan
ford varsity next Saturday on the
Cardinal field, to get Amos Elliott,
captain of the University of California
rugby team in 1911, to play with the
invading aggregation.
Elliott a Star.
Elliott is one of the best ruggers
that ever played in this part of the
state, and when with California, was
one of the danger points of their
winning combination. He has been
acting as coach of tlie Stockton high
school team .along with his other
duties as athletic director of the
school, and teacher in the History
department.
Presley Has Strong Squad.
The team gathered together by
Presley will be the strongest fifteen
that Stanford will meet this season,
except Santa Clara in the Big Game.
The men are working out in San
Francisco, and the official lineup will
be announced tomorrow.
Counting substitutes, the Palo Alto
Athletic Club will be well repre
sented on the All Star lineup, Casliel,
Card, Smitlierum, O'Laine, Gladstone,
Davis, Stolz, Templeton, Bihlman, and
Darsie, being signed up by Presley
to tryout for the team. Some of these
men will be on the sidelines, but
quite a number will trot out against
the varsity.
