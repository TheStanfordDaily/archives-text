# G.L. BELL TELLS OF IMMIGRATION
## Economics Majors Hear Housing Expert on Treatment of Foreigners 
### 
"We, as citizens, must help (the
immigrants for our self-protection.
We must instill American ideals and
American institutions into them. Only
then can we settle the hyphenated
American problem that has been the
cause of so much trouble in the last
few years," said George L. 13ell at
the Economics assembly this morning.
Mr. Bell, who is executive secretary
of the California Commission of Im
migration and Housing, explained that
this line of work is what the com
mission has been doing since its crea
tion, two years ago.
Must Change Attitude.
The attitude of the people of this
state has been to scorn the immigrant
rather than help him. As long as we
do {his we will have an immigrant
problem, said Mr. Bell. When edu-
cation and good living conditions are
provided, the newcomer will become
an American.
Explains Labor Conditions.
In explaining the work that has
been done to improve living condi
tions, Mr. Hell said that when the
first investigations were made by the
commission it was found that condi
tions were so bad that human beings
could not live. "To improve these
conditions wc have issued the only
book of its kind in Ihe world. This
book explains how to take care of
camps and of laboring men, and we
have enforced its use and find that
conditions are improving wonder
fully."
Slides that, have been taken in the
course of the work by the commission
were shown by Mr. Bell.
