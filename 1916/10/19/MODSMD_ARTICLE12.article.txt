a welcome to the new members last

now our department is ranked as one

a guitar solo by Ed. Bennett, consti-

The most thrilling event of the eve

air, given by Dr. E. C. Franklin, in
which lie froze roses and grapes, and
shattered them like glass, after dip
ping them in the liquid air, which
boils at 180Â° below zero. A ball of
cotton was made to explode like a
bomb, when it was touched by a flame
after having been immersed in the
strange liquid.
