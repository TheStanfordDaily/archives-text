## 
### 
"President Wilson is a man who
looks into the future; his every act
meets with my entire approval," said
President Emeritus Branner last night,
at the initial meeting of the Stanford
Wilson Club. "There is no doubt in
my mind about my attitude in the
present campaign." t
Dr. Frank Angell spoke on the ad
ministration record, laying particular
stress on the Underwood tariff and
the Federal Reserve act. A profit of
70% has been made on sporting goods
until recently, because of the tariff,
said Dr. Angell.
H. W. Maloney gave a short talk,
in which he spoke of Brainbridge
Colby, who will speak at the Armory
tonight. The fact that Mr. Colby will
speak tonight is due to the strenuous
efforts of the Palo Alto Wilson Club
to secure a nationally prominent man
to address Palo Alto and Stanford
communities. The Stanford Band will
play for an hour on the Circle in Palo
Alto before the meeting starts.
Elections of the following officers
were held by the members of the club:
President, A. ,T. Hettinger; first vice
president, .T. C. Anspach; second vice
president, .T. V. Wood; secretary and
treasurer, P. V. Adams.
