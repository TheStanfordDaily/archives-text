# ROLL OF HONOR
## 
### 
Robert Eouard Pellissier, who suf
fered a most honorable death when
he fell fighting in behalf of the coun
try of his birth, will continue to serve
France in spirit if the University pur
sues to completion suggested plans for
the establishment of a representation
in the American Ambulance Field
Service. Sixteen hundred dollars
measures the amount solicited by sub
scriptions among students, faculty,
and alumni —all friends.

In the very near future ,when a
call for funds is issued by the com
mittee in charge, Stanford students
cannot but remember a Stanford pro
fessor, who stoically surrendered a
brilliant future and a precious home.
Pellissier considered enlistment under
the tri-colored banner a duty. This
University may regard the establish
ment of an ambulance memorial a
privilege.

Leading educational institutions of
the east—Yale, Columbia, Harvard,
and Princeton, are all performing
their share in the care of the wound
ed from European slaughter fields. A
glowing opportunity is now given
Stanford to initiate a bigger and
deeper something in the west —to
take a part in humanity's aid, and
immortalize her soldier professor.
