An ill-born practice of a few fra
ternities monopolizing visiting high
school athletes has lately arisen,
which brings about their heads blunt
criticism. Although an organization
may be exceedingly desirous of sup
plying sustenance and a downy
couch for attractive members of pre
paratory school teams, it would
be far more courteous should com
pliance be made with the distribution
arranged by student body authorities.
Hereafter let fraternities limit them
selves to entertaining visiting guests
alloted to them at the training house.
