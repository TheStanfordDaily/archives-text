# Women to Send Gifts to French Soldiers
## 
### 
Stanford has enlisted her services
in a national movement to send
Christmas gifts to the soldiers 011 the
front. Fifty thousand "comfort bags"
are to be sent from all over the coun
try free of charge to the wounded
as well as those in service. Arrange
ments have been made whereby these
may be sent as late as October 25
and arrive in time for the celebra
tion.
Hags may be made of any strong
material, and are to be filled with
certain little articles that it is thought
the men will appreciate the most.
Full information may be had of the
Y. W. C. A. secretary or from Mrs.
B. Willis, 5 Lasuen. Everyone is
urged to make at least one of these
bags.
