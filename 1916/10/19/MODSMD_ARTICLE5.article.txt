# HOLLAND WINS BERWICK PRIZE
## Victor Gets Fifty Dollars and Chance at Higher Laurels 
### 
Fifty dollars and the right to com
pete for the Pacific Coast champion
ship went to .T. C. Holland, '17, who
last evening won the Edward Ber
wick Junior Peace Prize, from a field
of nine contestants. Holland's speech,
"A Supreme Court of Nations," was
considered to be the one most prac
tical and effective plan for interna
tional peace, by the judges, who
united in saying that competition for
the prize was exceptionally close this
year.
"Supreme Court of Nations."
"We can never have permanent
peace so long as war is regarded as
a means of deciding international dis
putes, and periods between wars are
used for preparation for hostilities,"
said Holland. He pointed out that the
United States of all nations had a
great opportunity to bring about the
formation of an international league.
National Laurels Possible.
Holland will compete against rep
resentatives of universities and col
leges of California, Oregon, Wash
ington, Nevada and Utah, in a Pacific
Coast section peace oratorical contest
in the spring. A fifty-dollar prize is
offered in this. If successful there
he will go back to MohaWk, N. Y., next
fall, to compete for the one hundred
dollar national prize offered by the
United States Intercollegiate Peace
Association.
Holland is a member of the Stan
ford intercollegiate debating commit
tee, and of Ncstoria.
Close Competition.
L. S. Miller. '17, W. T. Ames, '18,
and the two Crobaugh brothers, were
Holland's closest competitors last
night. Miller's strongest points
against war were made in his de
scriptions of his experiences with the
militia on the Mexican border this
summer. Ames chose as his topic,
"The United States and World Peace,"
and confined himself to arguing the
duty of the United States in taking
the lead in the world-peace movement
after the present European struggle,
rather than outlining any system of
world confederation. M. Crobaugh,
'18, presented a scholarly exposition
of the advantages of "Aggressive
Pacifism" in securing permanent
peace. C. .T. Crobaugh, '10, urged the
solution of educational, of social and
economical, and of political problems
as the way to world peace.
Turley Entertains.
.T. R. Broken shire, 'If, spoke on
"Law vs. War;" T. 11. Claussen, '14,
on "The Splendid Web;" E. E. Wil
liams, '16, on "The Next Logical
Step," and J. S. Turley, gr., on "The
Prospects for Permanent Peace." Tur
ley was an eleventh-hour entrant, and
his speech might be termed, in some
respects, the most entertaining of all
the orations.
Judges last night were J. S. P. Tat
lock, professor of English Philology;
Assistant Professor M. P. Kirkwood
of the Law school, and Dr. IT. R.
Stolz of the Physical Training depart
ment. Debating Coach K. E. Leib, '15,
presided.
