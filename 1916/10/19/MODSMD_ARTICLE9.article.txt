# Basket in Final Minute of Play Wins Close Game
## 
### 
By far tlio best game played in the
present basketball series was that
staged yesterday afternoon, when af
ter running neck and neck for two
fifteen-minute halves, Beta Theta Pi
tossers succeeded in ringing up a bas
ket in the last minute of play, thereby
breaking a tie and nosing a 15 to 13
win from their opponents, Alpha Delta
Phi. In the second game El Campo
Club put it over on the Sigma Nu ag
gregation with a 41 to 10 score.
First (Janie 11 si r«l Fought.
A more evenly matched game has
not been seen on the Stanford court
this season than that of the two fra
ternities which lined up against each
other for the first game. It was a
hard tight from start to finish and at
no time did one team lead the other
by more than three points.
At the end of tlie first half the
Alpha Delta Phi baskcters had an S to
♦! loiid over their opponents, and ap
peared to have the edge on the other
five both in the matter of teamwork
an ] tlie accuracy with which they lo
cated the basket. Both Clark and
Williamson showed up well for them.
In the second period the work of
Watson, Beta Theta Pi forward, began
to tell for his team, and enabled them
to tally 9 points to the other team's
5. He won the game for his fratern
ity when, after some clever passing
by Jones and Burton, he found the
basket for two more points.
The game between El Campo Club
and the Sigma Nu contingent was a
walkaway for the eating club. The
fraternity was outplayed not only in
the matter of speed but also in team
work. Righter, center on last year's
freshman team, rolled up the high
est individual score of the day, mak
ing 16 points.
Dolan for the club also played a
brilliant game, seeing to it that the
ball stayed at his end of the field most
of the time. Estes for the Sigma Nu's
put up a fine defensive game, having
the difficult task of playing against
Dolan.
Tomorrow afternoon the slate shows
Theta Xi opposed to Delta Chi and
Theta Delta Chi lipied up against
