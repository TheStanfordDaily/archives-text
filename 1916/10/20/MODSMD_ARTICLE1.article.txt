# DEATH KNELL OF CHEATING IS SOUNDED
## COUNCIL MAKES MOVE Those Who Cut Classes Often Not to Get Chance at Finals 
### 
Action was taken yesterday by the
Academic Council upon the recom
mendations made in the report of
former Student Adviser Otis H. Castle,
'14, after an investigation held last se
mester by a committee of the Student's
Council.
Recognizing the complaint made in
this report that cheating being a very
serious offense, should be accorded
uniformity of treatment, important
regulations were adopted by the Aca
demic Council.
They are as follows: First, that
since cheating is a University of
fense, cases of cheating require uni
formity of treatment. The instructor
shall report all offenders promptly to
the President. Second, certain definite
rules for the conduct of examinations
are laid out. Third, strict account
shall be kept of absences and reported
to the Registrar, and lastly end-se
mester examinations shall be required
of all students except such as are ex
cluded because of absence or unsatis
factory work.
Would Remove Temptation.
Members of the Council feel that in j
many cases if temptations to cheat
were removed there would not be so
many cases of it, so uniformity of
rules have been adopted. In the first
place, alternate seats only shall be
used, or else alternate questions be
provided. The instructor, or some
representative shall lie present dur
ing the examination. Standard ex
amination books shall be furnished by
the University through the Registrar's
office. Exceptions to these rules may
be made in the case of advanced
classes, with the approval of the de
partment and instructor.
In the matter of end-semester ex
aminations, the recommendations
should provide that examinations shall
be held in all courses, and be re
quired of all students. Instructors
will be expected to drop from their
classes, students who cut freely or
whose work is markedly unsatisfac
tory. These students will not be ac
corded the privilege of an examina
tion.
Instructors will keep a daily record
of attendance and will make a weekly
report of the absences to the Regis
trar. In the case of large classes,
proctors may be appointed to keep
the record of attendance. It is felt
that absence is one cause that brings
about cheating.
These resolutions are not intended
to replace the "honor system" where
it is in use at the present time, such
as in the Law department. No reflec
tions are cast upon that system, the
idea of the resolutions being to rem
edy the disorganized conditions of
which complaint has been made.

serious offense, should be accorded
uniformity of treatment, important
regulations were adopted by the Aca
demic Council.
They are as follows: First, that
since cheating is a University of
fense, cases of cheating require uni
formity of treatment. The instructor
shall report all offenders promptly to
the President. Second, certain definite
rules for the conduct of examinations
are laid out. Third, strict account
shall be kept of absences and reported
to the Registrar, and lastly end-se
mester examinations shall be required
of all students except such as are ex
cluded because of absence or unsatis
factory work.
Would Remove Temptation.
Members of the Council feel that in j
many cases if temptations to cheat
were removed there would not be so
many cases of it, so uniformity of
rules have been adopted. In the first
place, alternate seats only shall be
used, or else alternate questions be
provided. The instructor, or some
representative shall lie present dur
ing the examination. Standard ex
amination books shall be furnished by
the University through the Registrar's
office. Exceptions to these rules may
be made in the case of advanced
classes, with the approval of the de
partment and instructor.
In the matter of end-semester ex
aminations, the recommendations
should provide that examinations shall
be held in all courses, and be re
quired of all students. Instructors
will be expected to drop from their
classes, students who cut freely or
whose work is markedly unsatisfac
tory. These students will not be ac
corded the privilege of an examina
tion.
Instructors will keep a daily record
of attendance and will make a weekly
report of the absences to the Regis
trar. In the case of large classes,
proctors may be appointed to keep
the record of attendance. It is felt
that absence is one cause that brings
about cheating.
These resolutions are not intended
to replace the "honor system" where
it is in use at the present time, such
as in the Law department. No reflec
tions are cast upon that system, the
idea of the resolutions being to rem
edy the disorganized conditions of
which complaint has been made.
