# DEATH KNELL OF CHEATING IS SOUNDED
## COUNCIL MAKES MOVE Those Who Cut Classes Often Not to Get Chance at Finals 
### 
Action was taken yesterday by the
Academic Council upon the recom

former Student Adviser Otis H. Castle,

are laid out. Third, strict account
shall be kept of absences and reported

of all students except such as are ex
cluded because of absence or unsatis
factory work.
Would Remove Temptation.

rules have been adopted. In the first

used, or else alternate questions be
provided. The instructor, or some

the University through the Registrar's
office. Exceptions to these rules may
be made in the case of advanced
classes, with the approval of the de
