in the Big Game will be tried out, as

bleacher stunts being arranged by the

Captain Bradcn Hi.
The varsity lineup is a well bal
anced combination, and should do well
against the fast and heavy All-Stars. I
The men are now in excellent condi :
tion, having been on the training table
for the past week, and restricted by
rigid training rules for some time.
Captain Braden will not be in the
game, owing to a bad knee and a
slight attack of grippe, while Winliam

sprained shoulder. Otherwise, the
