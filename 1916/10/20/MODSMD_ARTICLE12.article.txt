In the games between the fratern
ities it could be seen from Ihe begin
ning that Phi Delta Theta had their
opponents outplayed in every way.
The few times that the Alpha Tau
Omega delegation did succeed in get

they had a great deal of difliculty in
locating the basket. Dykes, one of
their forwards, managed to locate the
hoop once out of nine attempts. For
the winning team, Earl and Coppes

The spectators were treated to a
much better contest in the Delta Kap

side. In the first period the club
led their opponents by just one point
and only succeeded in tallying up four
more in the second. Draper, Thomp

point winners for the club, and Twohy
and Molton played a good game for
the fraternity.
Four more teams have entered the
league since the drawing for places,
