# CONSCIENCE EASERS

Chroniclers narrate the story of how
a famous White House occupant, after
a walk of four miles, returned three
cents undeserved profit received while
a clerk in a rural grocery store. Rem
iniscence of this unusual bit of integ
rity, brings forth on the horizon of
thought the subject of honesty in uni
versity classrooms. Without quib
bling, the topic has been one in the
past upon which we have allowed
gobs of moss to collect.
********
Without endeavoring to submerge
the name of Stanford in the mud, we
feel no compunction in stating that
cheating bobs up intermittently In
university examinations. Especially
is this indictment true of the under
classmen, where this misconduct is
most prevalent. No student other
than a spineless, rubber-stamp indi
vidual, ever attempts to justify such
malpractice. With the great major
ity, debased sheepskins are taboo.
********
Advocates of justice and honesty in
examinations recognize the big stride
of progress toward the ultimate ideals
in the uniform and progressive regu
lations adopted by the Faculty Coun
cil. One may be pretty sure that the
recipient of the degree is as deserv
ing of the honor as his neighbor.
********
A short-hand summary of the
scheme plainly advertises its merits.
Uniform treatment of examinations is
guaranteed by the introduction of
concrete University regulations. Pre
cautions are to be taken to prevent
and discourage dishonesty, since pos
sibility and temptation is minimized.
With attendance at lectures made im
perative, the opportunity of seriously
falling down in any subject is re
moved, since cutting classes has been
the greatest factor in low scholar
ships, and the subsequent desire to
cheat. Finally, the future growth of
the honor system, the ultimate goal,
is made nearer of attainment simul
taneous with a resulting elevation of
standards.
