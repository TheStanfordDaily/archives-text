# Rhodes Scholarship Denied to Germans
## 
### 
American students of German de
scent will not be included among those
ineligible to compete for the Rhodes
scholarship. A bill passed yesterday
by the English House of Commons, ex
cludes all students of Germany from
competing for the scholarship but is
not aimed at those of German par
ents living in other lands according
to Dr. 11. R. Stolz who won the
Rhodes honor here in 1909.
