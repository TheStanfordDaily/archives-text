# SINGLE TAX AMENDMENT BAD, WARNING
## BE MENACE TO "FARM" Stow Urges Students to Vote "No" in November Election 
### 
That the "Single Tax amendment,"
to be voted on at the election in No
vember, is unfair, and that it would
work permanent harm to Stanford
University if passed, is the opinion of
Vanderlynn Stow, treasurer and busi
ness manager of the University, who
has issued a circular statement in
which he expresses bis views for the
benefit of the 100 voters on the cam
pus.
Stanford's property is inalienable
as the result of clauses in the found
ers' wills, and incomes from rentals
would be materially reduced if a land
tax were added to University ex
penses. The letter follows:
To those interested in the present and
future welfare of The Leland Stan
ford Junior University.
There will come before the people,
to be voted upon at the November
( lection, the following measure, known
as "The Single Tax Amendment."
"The People of the State of Cali-
fornia do Enact as follows:
"Article XXX of the Constitution is
hereby amended to take effect Jan
nary Ist, 1917, by the following sec
tion:
"Public revenues, State, county,
municipal and district, shall be
rais'ed by taxation of land values,
exclusive of improvements, and
no tax or charge for revenue shall
be imposed on any labor product,
occupation, business or person;
but this shall not prevent the as -
sessment of incomes and inherit
ances to provide funds for old age
pensions, mothers' endowments,
and workingmen's disemployment
and disability insurance.
"Land holdings shall be equally
assessed, according to their value
for use or occupance, without re
gard to any work of man thereon;
this value shall be determined in
municipalities, and wherever else
practicable,., by the 'Somers sys
tem,' or other means of exact
computation from central loca
tions.
"The intent of this provision is
to take for public use the rental
and site values of land, and to re
duce land holdings to those only
who live on or make productive
. use of it.
"Conflicting provisions are here
by repealed."
If carried, land and real estate will
have the entire burden of taxes, and
those whose property consists of what
is designated as "Personal Property,"
such as Bonds, Stocks, Mortgages,
Xotes, Money in Bank, etc., will pay
no taxes whatever. Such a measure,
if passed, would be not only unjust
and unfair to the last degree, but
would be extremely onerous and in
jurious to all real estate and land
interest.
The property of the University
known as the Palo Alto Farm, situ
ated in Santa Clara and San Mateo
counties, by the will of the donors,
was made inalienable. It therefore
cannot be sold and the only way it
can be made self-supporting and of
benefit to the University, is by the
rental system.
rt, has been decided by the Board
of Trustees that the best possible use
that can be made of the Stanford
Vina and Stanford Durham ranches
for the benefit of the University is
by the rental system. If this amend
ment carries, the University will be
deprived of all such revenues. "The

To those interested in the present and

ford Junior University.
There will come before the people,
to be voted upon at the November
( lection, the following measure, known
as "The Single Tax Amendment."
"The People of the State of Cali-
fornia do Enact as follows:
"Article XXX of the Constitution is
hereby amended to take effect Jan
nary Ist, 1917, by the following sec
tion:
"Public revenues, State, county,
municipal and district, shall be
rais'ed by taxation of land values,
exclusive of improvements, and
no tax or charge for revenue shall
be imposed on any labor product,
occupation, business or person;
but this shall not prevent the as -
sessment of incomes and inherit
ances to provide funds for old age
pensions, mothers' endowments,
and workingmen's disemployment
and disability insurance.
"Land holdings shall be equally
assessed, according to their value
for use or occupance, without re
gard to any work of man thereon;
this value shall be determined in
municipalities, and wherever else
practicable,., by the 'Somers sys
tem,' or other means of exact
computation from central loca
tions.
"The intent of this provision is
to take for public use the rental
and site values of land, and to re
duce land holdings to those only
who live on or make productive
. use of it.
"Conflicting provisions are here
by repealed."
If carried, land and real estate will
have the entire burden of taxes, and
those whose property consists of what
is designated as "Personal Property,"
such as Bonds, Stocks, Mortgages,
Xotes, Money in Bank, etc., will pay
no taxes whatever. Such a measure,
if passed, would be not only unjust
and unfair to the last degree, but
would be extremely onerous and in
jurious to all real estate and land
interest.
The property of the University
known as the Palo Alto Farm, situ
ated in Santa Clara and San Mateo
counties, by the will of the donors,
was made inalienable. It therefore
cannot be sold and the only way it
can be made self-supporting and of

rental system.
