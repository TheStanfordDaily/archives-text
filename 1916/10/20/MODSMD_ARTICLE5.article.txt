# FREE ELECTION RETURNS FOR CAMPUS
## 
### 
An open, free-for-all battle between
the Hughes and Wilson factions on
the campus has been definitely as
surred, by means of arrangements
just completed by The Daily Palo
Alto. The leaders of the two local
political clubs are arranging plans for
I a "big" time, while their members are
i sharpening their voices for a noisy
| contest. The scene of the affair will
be in the Assembly Hall, 011 the eve
ning of the presidential election, No
vember 7.
Hearst Service Assured.
Word was received over the tele
phone from the San Francisco "Ex
aminer" today that the Hearst ser

vice will be offered to the Univer
sity public. President Wilbur lias
granted formal permission for dash
ing the returns in the Assembly Hall.
The Examiner is cooperating with The
Daily Palo Alto in completing ar
rangements for an evening's enter
tainment. Short skits will be staged
by Ram's Head and musical novelties
will be inserted in the programme at
times when the political opposition
threatens to become too strenuous.
Contrary to an earlier statement,
there will be no charge for admission
to the Assembly Hall, the Examiner
extending its services free of charge.
The election returns will be received
on the Assembly Hull stage direct
from the wire. The telegraph com
pany will have a wire connected to
instruments on the stage through the
telephone company, and the returns
will be taken down by a special oper
ator from San Francisco. Gilbert G.
Weigle, '95, who has been instru
mental in having the service extended
to the campus, will probably be on
hand for the affair to direct the final
arrangements.
The same returns flashed at Stan
ford will go on the screen in San
Francisco and other large cities of
the country. The reports will be put
on the wire in the various cities as
soon as they are counted, and sum
mary estimates will be reported from
the larger cities and state capitals.
