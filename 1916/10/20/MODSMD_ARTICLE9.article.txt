# Swimming Dance May Outgrow Club House
## 
### 
Everybody is getting in the swim.
It can't be that the hot water makes
the difference.
! Nor can the rush to the swim be
j credited to the new women's plunge.
It's doubtful if the new swimming
suits have anything to do with it.
However, one thing is certain.
EVERYBODY IS GETTING INTO
THE SWIM.
The swim—right now —is the stu
dent body dance for the swimming
I team, one week from tomorrow night.
' According to Captain A. A. Goldsmith,
I so many couples will be at the dance,
I that the affair may be held at Encina
instead of the Women's Club House,
at which place it was originally plan
ned.
