# VARSITY WALLOPS ALL-STARS OF PRESLEY
## BARBECUE ENDS DAY Olympic Club Fifteen Conquers Fast College of Pacific Ruggers 
### 
Two victories and a like number of
defeats sura up the part of Stanford
teams in Saturday's "carnival-of foot
ball," the varsity walking away from
Presley's All-Stars and the freshmen
winning from the Chico Normal fif
teen, while the second varsity lost to
the Barbarians and the third varsity
to the fast Berkeley High boys. In
addition to these Stanford teams'
games here, the Olympic Club was
successful in conquering the College
of Pacific ruggers and Hitchcock
Military Academy won from the Man
zanila Hall boys of Palo Alto.
Shirs Dimmed.
Father Time had rather dimmed
some of the stars of George Presley,
and also, due to their rather i>oor con
dition, the varsity had little trouble in
coming out on top of a 35 to 6 score,
in a ragged exhibition. It must be
said of the Stars that they put up the
best that they had, and at moments
gave glimpses of their former clever
ness. "Mow" Mitchell, at first five
eighths, played an excellent game
throughout, and was well aided hy
the other backfield men, Joe Urban,
Greve, Huttman, Wallace and Henry.
Davis put up his usual stellar game at
half until he was removed late in
the second half, due to an injury on
the head.
Forwards of the Stars were the ones
whose lack of condition was partic
ularly noticeable. "Hero" Chcda, in
the front rank, was almost all in from
the outset, but managed to last the
first half, when O'Laine relieved him.
John O. Miller and George Presley
also showed signs of distress at the
first, but seemed to obtain sort of a
second wind, Presley playing through
out and Miller the first half.
Varsity Score First,
The varsity scorcd a few minutes
after the kick-off by John Miller,
Pelouze taking the ball over after a
snappy pass from Walker to Carroll,
"Dink" Templeton failing the conver
sion. When play Avas again resumed,
Wallace and Miller made one of the
Stars' best runs, carrying the ball
about 40 yards. Wallace was injured
on this play, and "Dutch". Henry took
his place on the wing. The varsity
now retaliated, and Single took the
ball over, Templeton again failing the
conversion.
Dribbling by Card and Flanagan,
and runs by "Mow" Mitchell, Joe
Urban, and Grove brought the ball
down near the varsity line, where
Flanagan finally took it over. George
Montgomery failed to convert this.
Single again made a try for the var
sity, conversion of this failing too.
Pelouze Gees Over.
The next score of the varsity
brought out the prettiest backfield
work of the day, Pelouze going over
after the ball had passed out from
! Walker, to Wark, to Long, to Carroll.
For the fourth time Templeton failed
the conversion. The last score made
by the varsity in this half was made
when Stanford was awarded a penalty
i kick on the 25-yard line and "Dink"
dropped the ball over the goal posts.
Huttman, receiving a pass from
. Presley on the 50-yard line, ran
through a scattered field for the last
' score made by the All-Stars. The
score at half time was 15 to G.
\1! Stun ford Half.
Stanford did all the scoring in the
second half, Halsted and Single going
] over once, while Chandler crossed the
line twice. Templeton converted the
! four tries of this half.
Lachmund, Wark and Davis received
injuries during this half, necessitating
their withdrawal.
Freshmen Slaughter Chico.
Jn the curtain-raiser of the after
noon the boys of 1920 conquered tiic
prospective school teachers of Chico
l Normal, !» to .1. Although hard fought
at all times the play was rather rag
jged. Needham, Tilton and Barneson
made the tries for the freshmen, while
: Xoal Cumrnings scored for the Chico
squad after a 55-yard run. Neither
team converted any of the scores.
Barbarian Club of San Francisco
was returned victor over the second
varsity in probably the most evenly
matched exhibition of the day. The
final score was G to 5, and although
the last half was played partly in the
dark, a good battle was offered at all
times.
On the outside turf at the same time
las Ibis contest, the Olympic Club de
feated the College of Pacific, 24 to 10.
Braunsweiger and Wright were the
stars of the college lads while Hale
played well for the clubmen.
Berkeley Victors.
Berkeley High conquered the third
varsity in the morning's contest, 11
to 0. Due to the slippery condition of |
the turf, on account of the heavy fog
of the morning, Berkeley was unable
to' hold the ball in their runs, while
on the other hand the Stanford team
played extremely well- and surprised
the few who arose in time to witness
the contest..
Hitchcock Military Academy of San
Rafael also won from Manzanita in
the morning on the auxiliary field, 9
to 112).
Festivities of the day were con
eluded with the barbecue at 0 o'clock
for the visiting athletes, and the pro
ducts of Sam McDonald were much
enjoyed by the players.
