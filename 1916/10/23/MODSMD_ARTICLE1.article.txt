# VARSITY WALLOPS ALL-STARS OF PRESLEY
## BARBECUE ENDS DAY Olympic Club Fifteen Conquers Fast College of Pacific Ruggers 
### 
Two victories and a like number of
defeats sura up the part of Stanford
teams in Saturday's "carnival-of foot
ball," the varsity walking away from
Presley's All-Stars and the freshmen
winning from the Chico Normal fif
teen, while the second varsity lost to
the Barbarians and the third varsity
to the fast Berkeley High boys. In
addition to these Stanford teams'
games here, the Olympic Club was
successful in conquering the College
of Pacific ruggers and Hitchcock
Military Academy won from the Man
zanila Hall boys of Palo Alto.
Shirs Dimmed.
Father Time had rather dimmed
some of the stars of George Presley,
and also, due to their rather i>oor con
dition, the varsity had little trouble in
coming out on top of a 35 to 6 score,
in a ragged exhibition. It must be
said of the Stars that they put up the
best that they had, and at moments
gave glimpses of their former clever
ness. "Mow" Mitchell, at first five
eighths, played an excellent game
throughout, and was well aided hy
the other backfield men, Joe Urban,
Greve, Huttman, Wallace and Henry.
Davis put up his usual stellar game at
half until he was removed late in
the second half, due to an injury on
the head.
