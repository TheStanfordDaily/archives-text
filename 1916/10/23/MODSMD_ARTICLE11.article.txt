# HONOR SYSTEM IS NOT HAMPERED BY FACULTY
## E. P. LESLEY EXPLAINS Prominent Men Approve Recent Academic Council Rulings 
### 
Misinterpretation of the regulations
in regard to student examinations
passed at the last meeting of the Aca
demic Council of the faculty as print
ed in Friday's issue of The Daily Palo
Alto has caused a widespread im
pression that student self government
is being interfered with by the fac
ulty. That no such intent or purpose
is involved in the action of the Aca
demic Council was brought out today
in statements made by student of
ficials and by the Student Affairs
Committee. That the new rules are
based entirely on investigations made
by the Student Adviser last semester,
is the statement of Associate Profes
sor E. P. Lesley, chairman of the Stu
dent Affairs Committee.
Students Approve Action.
Maintaining that the honor system
is in no way being hindered and that
no authority is being taken from the
Student Council, President J. W. Tem
pleton, '17, of the Men' Conference;
Student Adviser W. P. Staniford, 'IG,
and W. R. Wheatly, '17, secretary of
the Men's Conference, today approved
the action of the faculty committee as
being an additional step toward stu
dent control.
Lesley Statement Follows.
Lesley's' explanation of the new
rules, which was approved by Presi
dent Wilbur this morning, is as fol
lows
Stanford University, California,
October 23. 1010.
"Questions recently asked me about
the intent of the rules on cheating,
conduct of examinations, attendance
to classes, adopted by the Academic
; Council 011 October 19th, indicate that
I there is considerable misunderstand
ing prevalent as to the purpose of the
Council in taking this action.
Utiles On Investigation.
"The rules were drawn by the Ex
ecutive Committee of the Academic
Council. They are, with minor
changes, th esubstance of recommend
ations made by the Student Affairs
Committee at the close of the year
3915-16. The recommendations were
I made after a careful consideration of
a preliminary report. The material
from which the preliminary report
was made was gathered by Student
\dviser Castle and Professor H. C.
Moreno. It consisted largely of an
swers to questionaires sent out by Mr.
Castle to faculty heads of departments
and to representative upperclassmen.
( asilo's Purpose.
"Mr. Castle's purpose was to learn
(1) the extent of cheating, (2) the
kind of a course in which it exists,
large or small classes, advanced or
j elementary work, and (3) what might
lie done to eliminate it.
"I believe that Mr. Castle and mem
bers of the Men's Conference approved
the preliminary report upon which
the Stndent, Affairs Committee based
jits recommendations of which the
( rules adopted arc the substance.
! President Central Authority.
"1. Cheating. Instructors are re
j quired to report to the President be
: cause lie is the recognized central
authority. Everyone knows who he is
j and where his ofllce is. The office is
| equipped with machinery for handling
| business expeditiously. It is to be
assumed that as long as student self
government exists, and my hope and
expectatioh is that it will continue,
the student councils will continue to
try cases involving student discipline
| and recommend punishments. The
councils will now be assured of ac
curate reports in proper form before
eases are handed to them. Certainly
110 dissatisfaction with the previous
actions of the student councils is ex
pressed by the adoption of this rule.
Purpose of Absents Pule.
"The purpose of the rule in regard
to absences is twofold. To place a
check upon the instructor and upon
the student. Answers to Mr. Castle's
questionaires showed that in courses
where students can cut freely or in
what are designated as "pipes," cheat
ing is most prevalent. The Regis
trar's office is best fitted to collect
and compile data of the attendance
of classes. The intent of the other
rules is to remove the student who
has no wish to cheat from any con
tact with cheating. Alternate seats
or questions and official ex. hooks free
him from suspicion.
Will Lessen Cheating.
"I believe the faculty recognizes
that all of these rules will not pre
vent the deliberate cheat from perpe
trating fraud at times. They will
make it somewhat harder for him and
ho will be easier to detect, because
the man who is on the square is
somewhat protected and free to pay
attention to his work."

demic Council was brought out today
in statements made by student of
ficials and by the Student Affairs
Committee. That the new rules are
based entirely on investigations made
by the Student Adviser last semester,
is the statement of Associate Profes
sor E. P. Lesley, chairman of the Stu

Students Approve Action.
Maintaining that the honor system
is in no way being hindered and that
no authority is being taken from the
Student Council, President J. W. Tem
pleton, '17, of the Men' Conference;
Student Adviser W. P. Staniford, 'IG,
and W. R. Wheatly, '17, secretary of
the Men's Conference, today approved
the action of the faculty committee as
being an additional step toward stu
dent control.
Lesley Statement Follows.
Lesley's' explanation of the new
rules, which was approved by Presi
dent Wilbur this morning, is as fol
lows
Stanford University, California,
October 23. 1010.
"Questions recently asked me about
the intent of the rules on cheating,
conduct of examinations, attendance
to classes, adopted by the Academic
; Council 011 October 19th, indicate that
I there is considerable misunderstand
ing prevalent as to the purpose of the
Council in taking this action.
Utiles On Investigation.
"The rules were drawn by the Ex
ecutive Committee of the Academic
Council. They are, with minor
changes, th esubstance of recommend
ations made by the Student Affairs
Committee at the close of the year
3915-16. The recommendations were
I made after a careful consideration of
a preliminary report. The material
from which the preliminary report
was made was gathered by Student
\dviser Castle and Professor H. C.
Moreno. It consisted largely of an
swers to questionaires sent out by Mr.
Castle to faculty heads of departments
and to representative upperclassmen.
( asilo's Purpose.
"Mr. Castle's purpose was to learn
(1) the extent of cheating, (2) the
kind of a course in which it exists,
large or small classes, advanced or
j elementary work, and (3) what might
lie done to eliminate it.
"I believe that Mr. Castle and mem
bers of the Men's Conference approved
the preliminary report upon which
the Stndent, Affairs Committee based
jits recommendations of which the
( rules adopted arc the substance.
! President Central Authority.
"1. Cheating. Instructors are re
j quired to report to the President be
: cause lie is the recognized central
authority. Everyone knows who he is
j and where his ofllce is. The office is
| equipped with machinery for handling
| business expeditiously. It is to be
assumed that as long as student self
government exists, and my hope and
expectatioh is that it will continue,
the student councils will continue to
try cases involving student discipline
| and recommend punishments. The
councils will now be assured of ac
curate reports in proper form before
eases are handed to them. Certainly
110 dissatisfaction with the previous
actions of the student councils is ex
pressed by the adoption of this rule.
Purpose of Absents Pule.
"The purpose of the rule in regard
to absences is twofold. To place a
check upon the instructor and upon
the student. Answers to Mr. Castle's
questionaires showed that in courses
where students can cut freely or in
what are designated as "pipes," cheat
ing is most prevalent. The Regis
trar's office is best fitted to collect
and compile data of the attendance
of classes. The intent of the other
rules is to remove the student who
has no wish to cheat from any con
tact with cheating. Alternate seats
or questions and official ex. hooks free
him from suspicion.
Will Lessen Cheating.
"I believe the faculty recognizes
that all of these rules will not pre
vent the deliberate cheat from perpe
trating fraud at times. They will
make it somewhat harder for him and
ho will be easier to detect, because
the man who is on the square is
somewhat protected and free to pay
attention to his work."
Misinterpretation of the regulations
in regard to student examinations
passed at the last meeting of the Aca
demic Council of the faculty as print
ed in Friday's issue of The Daily Palo
Alto has caused a widespread im
pression that student self government
is being interfered with by the fac
