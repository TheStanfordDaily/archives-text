# Semi-Final Basket Play Starts Tuesday
## Delta Chi and Kappa Sigma Fives Defeat Theta Delta Chi and Theta Xi Teams 
### 
Another close and evenly matched
game of basketball was staged Fri
day afternoon, when Delta Chi, after
a rally in the second half, overcame
a load of six points, and defeated
Theta Xi by tallying two goals and
a foul throw in the last two minutes
of play,in making a final score of 25
to 21. The second game, between
Theta Delta Chi and Kappa Sigma,
fell short of the first one from a spec
tator's point of view, being won by
the latter team with a score of 29 1o 8.
King Stars for Delta Clii.
King, a:; forward, was the mainstay
of the Delta Chi team, locating the
basket with seeming ease, and scoring
five points for his team in the first
period and twelve in the second. Had
it not been for King the game would
have undoubtedly been a walkaway
for the Theta Xi's, for taken as a team
they had the edge on their opponents,
both in the matter of teamwork and
goal shooting. Shriver, one of their
forwards, ran King a close second in
the knack of locating the hoop, and
had he been sufficiently backed up
by the rest of his team, would have
kept the load over bis opponents in
the second half.
After the end of the first half the
second game looked like a whitewash
for the Theta Delta Clii aggre
gation, the Kappa Sigma's piling up
a 20 to 1 score. With this lead they
sluffed off in the second period and
succeeded in scoring only 9 points to
their opponents' 7, making the final
score 29 to S. Their victory was due
more to the brilliant playing of one
or two men rather than to any no
ticeable amount of teamwork.
Bonney as center succeeded in get
ting away with the ball time after
j time, and after dribbling it the length
! of the court ringing the basket with
j little difficulty. Wheatly as forward
: and Crosby as guard also were point
winners for their team.
Tomorrow will see the beginning
of the second round in the series,
which will eliminate six of the twelve
teams now contesting. After a third
1 round is played, the semi-finals will
be reached, the latter part of next
week.

Thursday—Delta Chi vs. Kappa Sis
ma. Winners of Kappa Alpha vs. Can
ary Cottage, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon
vs. Stanford Inn.
Another close and evenly matched
game of basketball was staged Fri
day afternoon, when Delta Chi, after
a rally in the second half, overcame
a load of six points, and defeated
Theta Xi by tallying two goals and
a foul throw in the last two minutes
of play,in making a final score of 25
to 21. The second game, between
Theta Delta Chi and Kappa Sigma,
fell short of the first one from a spec
tator's point of view, being won by
the latter team with a score of 29 1o 8.
King Stars for Delta Clii.
King, a:; forward, was the mainstay
of the Delta Chi team, locating the
basket with seeming ease, and scoring
five points for his team in the first
period and twelve in the second. Had
it not been for King the game would
have undoubtedly been a walkaway
for the Theta Xi's, for taken as a team
they had the edge on their opponents,
both in the matter of teamwork and
goal shooting. Shriver, one of their
forwards, ran King a close second in
the knack of locating the hoop, and
had he been sufficiently backed up
by the rest of his team, would have
kept the load over bis opponents in
the second half.
After the end of the first half the
second game looked like a whitewash
for the Theta Delta Clii aggre
gation, the Kappa Sigma's piling up
a 20 to 1 score. With this lead they
sluffed off in the second period and
succeeded in scoring only 9 points to
their opponents' 7, making the final
score 29 to S. Their victory was due
more to the brilliant playing of one
or two men rather than to any no
ticeable amount of teamwork.
Bonney as center succeeded in get
ting away with the ball time after
j time, and after dribbling it the length
! of the court ringing the basket with
j little difficulty. Wheatly as forward
: and Crosby as guard also were point
winners for their team.
Tomorrow will see the beginning
of the second round in the series,
which will eliminate six of the twelve
teams now contesting. After a third
1 round is played, the semi-finals will
be reached, the latter part of next
week.
