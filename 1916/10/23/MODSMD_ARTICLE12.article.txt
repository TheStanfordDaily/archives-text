# Semi-Final Basket Play Starts Tuesday
## Delta Chi and Kappa Sigma Fives Defeat Theta Delta Chi and Theta Xi Teams 
### 
Another close and evenly matched
game of basketball was staged Fri
day afternoon, when Delta Chi, after
a rally in the second half, overcame
a load of six points, and defeated
Theta Xi by tallying two goals and
a foul throw in the last two minutes
of play,in making a final score of 25
to 21. The second game, between
Theta Delta Chi and Kappa Sigma,
fell short of the first one from a spec
tator's point of view, being won by
the latter team with a score of 29 1o 8.
King Stars for Delta Clii.
King, a:; forward, was the mainstay
of the Delta Chi team, locating the
basket with seeming ease, and scoring
five points for his team in the first
period and twelve in the second. Had
it not been for King the game would
have undoubtedly been a walkaway
for the Theta Xi's, for taken as a team
they had the edge on their opponents,
both in the matter of teamwork and
goal shooting. Shriver, one of their
forwards, ran King a close second in
the knack of locating the hoop, and
had he been sufficiently backed up
by the rest of his team, would have
kept the load over bis opponents in
the second half.
After the end of the first half the
second game looked like a whitewash
