# Kicks to Touch

### 
Saturday was rugby day at Stanford,
if any particular day can be dedicated
to a football game. From early morn
ing until darkness sot in, the turf was
crowded with members of the various
fifteens that cavorted before the
bleachers. The barbecue in the eve
ning was a fitting conclusion to the
eventful day, the hungry players
flocking to taste the meat prepared by
the veteran cook, Sam McDonald.
In the first half of the varsity-All
| Star game, the play was exceedingly
I ragged and loose, but when the
"papas" were replaced by younger
'blood, the affair took on the appear
ance of a real contest although the
i Stanford men ran up quite a score.
One thing that was particularly no
ticeable was the amount of scoring
.done by the Cardinal forwards. The
I pack seemed to be on the ball and as-
I listed the backfield in many passing
j rushes.
The varsity was very much weak
ened by injuries, Braden and Win
ham being out of the game. With.
Wark and Lachmund added to the
list, the team will have a high per
centage of cripples, but it is better to
have them out now than two or three
weeks later.
Lachmund received a bad kick in
jilie side and was forced to go to the
hospital, but is out on the campus to
! day.
Wark hurt both knees in the All
i Star game and will not be in a suit
J for a few days, but Trainer Reynolds
! thinks that Lee will be back in har
'ness very soon.
Dink Templeton broke even for the
day converting goals. In the first half
| he did not look particularly good, mis
sing goals badly, but in the second
period he came back strong, convert
jing from difficult angles.
San .lose high school was unable to
show u]) for their game with the Pea
, nut Leaguers in the morning. The
Garden City team had a League game
on the boards with San Mateo.
Berkeley high did not play up to
their usual form in the contest with
the Stanford third varsity. Although
they won the game, 11 to ft, the wet
field made the passing rushes that
Ric Templeton's team has been dis
i playing this season, impossible.
Frank Walker displayed wonderful
i ability behind the scrum. His work
i has improved with every season, and
: now be is, without doubt, one of the
stars of the Cardinal team. He gets
| the ball out to the backs in fine style,
and is one of the squad's best men on
| defense.
The freshmen played fairly well in
I the game with Chico Normal, but on
the whole, the affair was slow and did
not cause the bleachers to become
| enthused.
I "Dutch" Henry showed class on the
wing for the All-Stars. He did not
| feature with any star plays, but was
'always in the game and was sure on
defense.
"Bob" Johnson is the second player
;on the varsity training table to fall
before the dreaded faculty axe. He
was unable to get off probation as
was expected, and will be unable to
play with the varsity this season.
Danny Carroll needed some glue on
j bis hands last Saturday. He fumbled
a number of passes, spoiling chances
of the backfield carrying the ball over
for scores.
