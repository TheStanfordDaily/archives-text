# STAMFORD THINKS ACTION LEAD TO HONOR SYSTEM
## 
### W.P. Staniford, '16 
1 am convinced the action of the
Academic Council is a good one. It
is going a long way toward providing
the healthy condition of attitude to
ward class work which we have not
obtained because of the presence in
many classes of several dishonest per
sons who allowed themselves to cheat.
Their presence and actions led others
into their path.
The move is not, as many persons
have supposed, a step away from the
honor system, but it is a definte step
towards this system, which we are
trying to install in all departments
outside of the Department of Law.
It gives a man a chance to be honest
if he wants to. The majority of the
students will feel that the move, is
warranted; the expressions of dissat
isfaction will come only from those
stdents whom the shoe pinches.
