### 
Marriage license clerks, and jus
tices of the peace, have been
routed out in the middle of the
night since time immemorial, to
j tie the proverbial knot for ro
mantic lovers, but it is rare in
deed that a photographer is stir
red from his quietude to snap the
shutter to aid youth and love.
It happened in Palo Alto this
morning. Two Stanford people,
devoted to each other with almost
dramatic fervor, aroused Frank
Davey from his dark-room.
"We're in love and want to get
married," said the youth. "Her
mother won't let us. She's away
now, and we figure if we post our
pictures on the campus together
in an 'almost married' pose, the
rest will be easy."
"Such has happened, you know,"
quoth Mr. Davey. And then from
behind the black cloth, "Smile
just a trifle! That's it! Register
devotion!"
Jerome Belden, '18, and Betty
Dean, 'IS, left the studio happy.
Unless there is maternal melting,
. or unler-'s she hears of the scheme,
pictures of the Belden-Dean ro
mance will be displayed on the
campus in a .day or two—on
"Show Shop" posters.
