## 
### 
Santa Clara v&rMty took yesterday's
rugby contest from the Palo Alto Ath
lelic Club :i I to 3, this being the first
score made against the Santa Clara
team tliis year. "Ric" Templeton
dropped t lie ball right between the
goal posts when Erb marked the ball
on the 4.~Â»-yard line. This was one of
the prettiest kicks of the season, as
it was made from a point, very near
Hie sideline.
The game was replete with passing
rushes and dribbling, and though the
clubmen put up a hard battle, they
were unable to penetrate Santa
Clara's defense. Fowler, Winston,
Diaz, Don and Korte showed up ex
ceptionally well for the Mission Town
boys. Fitzpatriek, Howell and Hickey
of the collegians' team were unable to
nlay.
