# Marriage Daggers Threaten "Co-Ed"
## 
### 
The new "Bawl-Out" not only lived
up to its name, but appeared in the
somewhat startling role of a matri
monial bureau when a transfer girl
consulted it the other day.
She glanced through it leisurely,
and was very much interested to dis
cover the significant way in which the
faculty otlicers who were married were
designated. They had little daggers
in front of their names. She then
turned the pages of the fascinating
volume to the W's, witli the usual
tense and excited expression which
accompanies an effort to find one's
name in print. Yes, there it was, —
Nina Westbie, Engl.,—dagger!
Horrors! She wasn't married, nor
did she have a family! She was only
a transfer!
What a bawl-out!
