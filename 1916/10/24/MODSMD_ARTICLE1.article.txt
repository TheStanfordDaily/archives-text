### 
Freshmen football coach, "Dutch"
Henry, will send his lirst year squad
against the speedy San Mateo high
school fifteen, tomorrow afternoon, in
the midweek rugby contest. The

turf, being called at 4:30, with twen
ty-five cents or season tickets slated
as the admission requirement.

Lock Card will referee, assuring a
fast game, as Card uses the whistle
sparingly, always playing to the ad
vantage. This is an excellent way
to officiate and satisfy the spectators
and the players at the same time. The
game is faster, and there are fewer
delays by the constant blowing of the
whistle.
Henry Coaches Freshmen.
Henry has been able to devote his
entire attention to the freshmen and
the team has greatly improved in the
last few weeks. It seemed that the
game with Santa Clara was really the
starter for the "babes," and that they
have now struck their stride. Al
though some of the best players are
out of the game with injuries, the
fifteen is displaying excellent form.
San Mateo is one of the best high
school teams in this part of the state.
They played both San Jose and Palo
Alto to tie scores, and have a good
chance to win the league title. Their
backfield work is fast and the whole
team has a reputation of fighting
from the first whistle to the final gun.
Hunter and Given, at first and second
five-eighths, are the stars of the fif
teen, and have done most of the scor
ing for the Orange and Black team
this season.
The freshmen lineup is not much
changed from that of the past few
games. There are a number of new
names in the ranks of the substitutes,
however, while Gibbs, in Needham's
place on the wing, is a new player
on the squad. Risling, Larkin, and
Angell are still on the list of crip
ples, their absence from the lineup
weakening the ruggers considerably.
Good weather is promised by the
agent of Uncle Sam, and so the man
agement expects a good crowd to
sive the teams a hand. The freshmen
have few more games to play this
year, and as the contest scheduled
for November Sth, with Woodland, is
to be made a feature pigskin battle,
the team should be encouraged In
these final scrimmages.
The lineup of the freshmen follows-
Aubert, Wayland and Barneson,
(Henry), front rank; Millington,
(Bowden), and Martin, (Swift), mid
dle rank; Gardner, (Humphreys), Til
ton, and Snook, (McCartney), rear
rank; Strain, halfback; Cass and
.Toerg, five-eighths; Strong, (Toole),
center-three; Rogers, (Thayer), and
Gibbs, (Cattern), wings, and Camp
bell, fullback.

and the players at the same time. The
game is faster, and there are fewer
delays by the constant blowing of the
whistle.
Henry Coaches Freshmen.
Henry has been able to devote his
entire attention to the freshmen and
the team has greatly improved in the
last few weeks. It seemed that the
game with Santa Clara was really the
starter for the "babes," and that they
have now struck their stride. Al
though some of the best players are
out of the game with injuries, the
fifteen is displaying excellent form.
San Mateo is one of the best high
school teams in this part of the state.
They played both San Jose and Palo
Alto to tie scores, and have a good
chance to win the league title. Their
backfield work is fast and the whole
team has a reputation of fighting
from the first whistle to the final gun.
Hunter and Given, at first and second
five-eighths, are the stars of the fif
teen, and have done most of the scor
ing for the Orange and Black team
this season.
The freshmen lineup is not much
changed from that of the past few
games. There are a number of new
names in the ranks of the substitutes,
however, while Gibbs, in Needham's
place on the wing, is a new player
on the squad. Risling, Larkin, and
Angell are still on the list of crip
ples, their absence from the lineup
weakening the ruggers considerably.
Good weather is promised by the
agent of Uncle Sam, and so the man
agement expects a good crowd to
sive the teams a hand. The freshmen
have few more games to play this
year, and as the contest scheduled
for November Sth, with Woodland, is
to be made a feature pigskin battle,
the team should be encouraged In
these final scrimmages.
The lineup of the freshmen follows-
Aubert, Wayland and Barneson,
(Henry), front rank; Millington,
(Bowden), and Martin, (Swift), mid
dle rank; Gardner, (Humphreys), Til
ton, and Snook, (McCartney), rear
rank; Strain, halfback; Cass and
.Toerg, five-eighths; Strong, (Toole),
center-three; Rogers, (Thayer), and
Gibbs, (Cattern), wings, and Camp
bell, fullback.
Freshmen football coach, "Dutch"
Henry, will send his lirst year squad
against the speedy San Mateo high
school fifteen, tomorrow afternoon, in
the midweek rugby contest. The
game will be played on the Stanford
turf, being called at 4:30, with twen
ty-five cents or season tickets slated
as the admission requirement.
Curd AY ill Referee.
Lock Card will referee, assuring a
fast game, as Card uses the whistle
sparingly, always playing to the ad
vantage. This is an excellent way
to officiate and satisfy the spectators
and the players at the same time. The
game is faster, and there are fewer
delays by the constant blowing of the
whistle.
