# Professor C. J. Keyser of Columbia to Speak to Thursday Assembly
## 
### 
A man who combines philosophy
and mathematics in such a way as to
make them both interesting, is com
ing to Stanford, Thursday, when Pro
fessor Cassius .1. Keyser, head of the
Mathematics department at Columbia
University, will lecture to the morn
ing assembly on "Ways to Pass the
Walls of the World." This philosoph
ical lecture will be illustrated by dia
grams on a blackboard where he will
work out his connections between the
two apparently widely separated sub
jects.
Professor Keyser is exchanging
places with a professor in the Univer
sity of California this year, where he
has taught summer school several
times.
