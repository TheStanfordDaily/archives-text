■Stanford went "wet" today in a
straw vote taken this noon by The
Daily Palo Alto at fraternities, soror
ities, eating clubs, and lloble, by a
vote of 429 to 309 against amendment
number one, which provides for ab
solute prohibition of manufacture and
sale of liquor in California.
At the same time "drys" scored a
comeback in the second amendment,
which prohibits the sale of liquor at
public places and in quantities less
than two gallons. Evidently, the cam
pus does not fear the two gallon min
imum limit, for the second amendment,
carried 403 to 32G.
Clubs Are Strong "Wets."
Fraternity men went against the
first amendment by about the same
percentage as the club men, though
the latter came out strongly against
the second amendment, while the fra
ternity vote in this instance was prac
tically a fifty-fifty proposition.
In both amendments the women of
the campus went dry, the sorority
women being stronger in proportion
lor the first amendment than the club
women, though the vote ol the latter
played a strong part in carrying
amendment two, Roble going 83 to 15
against retail sale of liquor in steins.
Five Frats for No. 1.
Four fraternities, Delta Upsilon,
Delta Chi, Alpha Delta Phi, Phi Kap
pa Sigma, and Acacia, voted dry, on
amendment one, with Delta Kappa
Epsilon fifty-fifty. Nine fraternities
favor amendment two. They are
Tlieta Delta Chi, Phi Kappa Sigma,
Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Delta Theta,
Acacia, Alpha Delta Phi, Alpha Tau
Omricon, Delta Upsrtlon, and Delta

El Toro eating club refused to com

suffragettes. Roth amendments car

Daily Palo Alto at fraternities, soror

vote of 429 to 309 against amendment
number one, which provides for ab
solute prohibition of manufacture and
sale of liquor in California.
At the same time "drys" scored a

In both amendments the women of

Amendment one carried in every

vote was 16 to 0 against. Amend
ment two carried in every women's
house but Chi Omega, Gamma Phi
Heta, Kappa Alpha Theta, and the
Kappa Kappa Gamma house. In the
latter, the members refused to vote,
but stated that the house was for
prohibition. No vote was taken by
the Alpha Phi house, whose members
do not meet at home every noon.
Training Table Is Dry.
El Toro eating club refused to com
mit itself, preferring the ranks of the
suffragettes. Roth amendments car
ried at the training table, Phi Kappa
Psi, the first by a close margin, and
the latter by a healthy majority. The
S. A. E. house was afraid to commit
itself on the liquor question, and kept
its ballot secret to members.
If California were not a suffrage state
and the women could not have voted
this noon the first amendment would
have lost 32S to 2. r >, and the second
would have tumbled 263 to 229.

■Stanford went "wet" today in a
straw vote taken this noon by The
Daily Palo Alto at fraternities, soror
ities, eating clubs, and lloble, by a
vote of 429 to 309 against amendment
number one, which provides for ab
solute prohibition of manufacture and
sale of liquor in California.
At the same time "drys" scored a
comeback in the second amendment,
which prohibits the sale of liquor at
public places and in quantities less
than two gallons. Evidently, the cam
pus does not fear the two gallon min
imum limit, for the second amendment,
carried 403 to 32G.
Clubs Are Strong "Wets."
Fraternity men went against the
first amendment by about the same
percentage as the club men, though
the latter came out strongly against
the second amendment, while the fra
ternity vote in this instance was prac
tically a fifty-fifty proposition.
In both amendments the women of
the campus went dry, the sorority
women being stronger in proportion
lor the first amendment than the club
women, though the vote ol the latter
played a strong part in carrying
amendment two, Roble going 83 to 15
against retail sale of liquor in steins.
Five Frats for No. 1.
Four fraternities, Delta Upsilon,
Delta Chi, Alpha Delta Phi, Phi Kap
pa Sigma, and Acacia, voted dry, on
amendment one, with Delta Kappa
Epsilon fifty-fifty. Nine fraternities
favor amendment two. They are
Tlieta Delta Chi, Phi Kappa Sigma,
Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Delta Theta,
Acacia, Alpha Delta Phi, Alpha Tau
