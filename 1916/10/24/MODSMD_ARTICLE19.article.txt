The Daily Palo Alto:
In a statement concerning the so
called "honor" system which has been
installed by the Academic Council of
the faculty, W, P. Staniford made the
statement, "The move is not, as many
persons have supposed, a step away
from the honor system, but it is a
definite step towards this system,
which we are trying to install in all
departments outside of the Depart
ment of Law."
This statement seems very paradox
ical. If this new action is a definite
step toward the honor system, and is
being installed In all departments ex
cept the Department of Law, what
then, is the system which exists in
the Law department? The dishonor
system? For certainly two system's
so diametrically opposite cannot both
be the honor system. If this new sys
tem of forcing the professors to stay
in the room during examinations is
the best system to prevent cheating
and to put students on their honor,
why is it not installed in the Law
department? In a statement by Pro
fessor Lesley of the Faculty Commit
tee on Student Affairs, there is the
statement "the man who is on the
square (under this system) is some
what protected and free to pay at
tention to his work." Why, then, if
this new system is going to benefit
every honest student and allow him
to pay more attention to his work, are
not the law students put under the
same system which (according to the
statement - ) would benefit them so? In
a statement by Wheatly in the same
issue, it is said that "cheating will be
put under such a severe penalty that
it will be entirely discouraged, as it
is at Princeton and other great uni
versities." Put how is it discour
aged at Princeton? Not by the sys
tem which is being putin here at
present, but rather by the system
which is in effect in the Law depart
ment.
No, it is really a little too much to
try to hoax the students at large by
calling the new system the "Honor"
system, when in reality it is nothing
more than a "police" or "spy" system.
There is no honor involved in it, but
merely the threat of greater vigilance
on the part of the University—watch
ing every student upon the assump
tion that if he is not watched he will
be dishonest. The student who is in
clined to be dishonest is coerced, but
no appeal is made to his honor or
loyalty. He is only warned to be
more wary in cheating.
The real honor system is not fund
amentally based upon the idea of stu
dent spying on student, but rather up
on the idea that the professor be
lieves his class honest—so much so,
in fact, that he does not feel the least
need of standing over them and
watching them. And the student on
his part feels a loyalty to the pro
fessor and to this system that would
prevent him from cheating even if
the thought of doing so came to his
mind. In a word, it is conducting
an examination on the basis of a
gentleman's agreement rather than
on the police system.
This system has been installed in
the Law department and has worked
out so effectively that cheating in the
Law department is a minus quantity.
A student caught cheating in a law
exam would not have to wait to be
thrown out by the Student Council,
for the rest of the class would make
it so hot for him that he would not
dare show up there again. The Aca
demic Council knows this, and yet it
has so little faith in it, or so little
faith in the rest of the University,
that it thinks it far better to spy on
students rather than to appeal to
their honor or loyalty. Tf we are to
have the honor system, let us have
it, but if we ftre to have a police sys
tem, at least let us not delude our

solves by calling it, "The Honor Sys
tem."
