ner in which Ambassador Page se
cured Mr. Hoover, and says"he has
won for himself a distinction not only
in the eyes of his own rescued coun

"Mr. Hoover is a curious kind of in
dividual, if I may be allowed a little
of the personal comment that 110 so
particularly and intensely dislikes,"
A British Cabinent minister said of
him:
"How is it that the bluntest man in
Europe is able, without apparent ef
fort, to handle a situation involving
more irreconcilable elements than
any other situation in this war?"
"Nobody knows. Ask any man in
the organization why he is giving up
six months or a year or two years of
his life to the performance of unpaid,
and what must sometimes seem to
be unappreciated, service, and nine
chances in ten he will say: 'Oh, I
don't know. Mr. Hoover asked me to.'
"Through all the discussion over
points of international law which it
was feared were about to be tres
passed upon and through all the var
ious arguments that arose, Mr. Hoover
introduced a monotone which recited
and kept on reciting that, Hague Con
ventions or no Hague Conventions,
rights or no rights, while all this ar
gument was in progress seven million
Belgians were rapidly approaching
the reckless and rioting wholesale
horror stage of the worst famine in
the world. What were they going to
do about it? Mr. Hoover negotiated
the 1914 Anglo-German 'treaty' which
provided that the Belgians should be
fed from overseas, under neutral sup
ervision and control, and the Germans
should undertake to exempt all im
ported civilian food supplies from
requisition."

Hoover's supervision, a description
which was furnished Stanford stu

"Mr. Hoover is a curious kind of in
dividual, if I may be allowed a little
of the personal comment that 110 so
particularly and intensely dislikes,"
A British Cabinent minister said of
him:
"How is it that the bluntest man in
Europe is able, without apparent ef
fort, to handle a situation involving
more irreconcilable elements than
any other situation in this war?"
"Nobody knows. Ask any man in
the organization why he is giving up
six months or a year or two years of
his life to the performance of unpaid,
and what must sometimes seem to
be unappreciated, service, and nine
chances in ten he will say: 'Oh, I
don't know. Mr. Hoover asked me to.'
"Through all the discussion over
points of international law which it
was feared were about to be tres
passed upon and through all the var
ious arguments that arose, Mr. Hoover
introduced a monotone which recited
and kept on reciting that, Hague Con
ventions or no Hague Conventions,
rights or no rights, while all this ar
gument was in progress seven million
Belgians were rapidly approaching
the reckless and rioting wholesale
horror stage of the worst famine in
the world. What were they going to
do about it? Mr. Hoover negotiated
the 1914 Anglo-German 'treaty' which
provided that the Belgians should be
fed from overseas, under neutral sup
ervision and control, and the Germans
should undertake to exempt all im
ported civilian food supplies from
requisition."
The remainder of the article is
taken up with a description of the
work that is being done under Mr.
Hoover's supervision, a description
which was furnished Stanford stu
dents several weeks ago by Dr. Frank
Angell, who has been associated with
Mr. Hoover in the relief work.
