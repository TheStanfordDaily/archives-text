# Miller to Speak on the Making and Sale of Books
## 
### 
"The Making and Marketing of
Books" will be the topic of an address
which Mr. G. C. Miller, manager of
the Stanford bookstore, will give be
fore the members of English Club at
the regular meeting of that organiza
tion, to be held tomorrow night in
the Women's Club House.
Mr. Miller gave a lecture on this
subject before the California Library
Association at Coronado, two years
ago, and it was received with great
interest, for he treats it from a view
point unknown not only to the public
at large but to the majority of librar
ians themselves. He will illustrate
the points brought out by some forty
or fifty books which he will have on
hand. Mr. Miller has been in the
book business for some ten years,
and for the last three he has man
aged the local bookstore. He has
made a special study of this subject,
and is an authority upon it.
