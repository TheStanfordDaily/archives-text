# Women Swimmers Are Not Permitted To Hear Own Splashing When In Tank
## 
### 
This is inside information, in
several senses of the word, and
comes to Daily Palo Alto readers
after having been weighed, sealed,
and certified by the censor.
Stanford women swimmers are
unfortunate. They are required to
stuff their ears with wads of cot
ton before taking their plunge. As
a result they cannot enjoy the
sound of their own splash. Fur
thermore, they are unable to hear
the voice of the swimming instruc
tor, and consequently occasionally
jump in feet first when told to
dive head foremost.
Not only that, but the mermaids
are not permitted to take their
own hair in swimming. Boxes
near each of the numerous mir
rors in the dressing rooms, are
labeled "Put Hair Here." The size
of the boxes indicate that they
were intended to contain more
than mere combings. With some
hair yellow, and some hair red,
and the danger of accidentally
exchanging hair, ever present,
there is a possibility that multi
colored hair for women will come
in vogue.
