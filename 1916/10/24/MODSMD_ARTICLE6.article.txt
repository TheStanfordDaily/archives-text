# Four Ruggers Added to the Training Table
## 
### 
Swarts, Single, Scliwarzenbek, Wil
kins and Marriott were yesterday ad
ded to the list of rugby players on
the varsity training table, now in ses
sion at the Phi Kappa Psi house. Coach
Brown now has twenty-three men on
the "yearly diet squad," including thir
teen forwards and ten backfield men.
Four men are fighting for the front
rank berths, five for the middle rank
jobs, and four for the rear rank po
sitions. Most of these players can,
however, play any position in the
scrum.
In the backfield, it looks as though
the only positions of serious doubt are
at first five-eighths, and on one wing.
