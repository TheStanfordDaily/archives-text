# Canary Cottage Is Winning Quintet
## Sigma Alpha Epselon Looses to Stanford Inn in Fast First Round Game 
### 
A surprise was sprung on local bas
ketball enthusiasts yesterday after
noon, when five tossers representing
the "Canary Cottage" Club, admin
istered a 4.3 to 0 whitewash on the
Kappa Alpha contingent. The game
between Sigma Alpha Epsilon and
Stanford Inn loyalists was much in
the nature of a walkaway, being won
by the latter with a .30 to 14 score, but
in comparison with the first game ap
peared as keen competition.
Club lliis Strong Team.
Composed of five veteran players,
the club aggregation treated the spec
tators to one of the best exhibitions
of the round ball game that has been
seen on the Stanford court this se
mester. Heckstrom, a transfer,
starred continually for them. After
securing tbo ball at the far end of
the court be dribbled it with little
difficulty through tbo fraternity's
guards and found the basket the ma
jority of times.
.letvHt Killed Out.
Augmented by Jewett, the club of
fered one of the strongest goal shoot
ing combinations in the league.
Jewett, however, was not eligible to
compete with the club, not being a
member, and it was only with the
consent of the Kappa Alpha team that
he was allowed to play. He has been
ruled out of future games.
In the second game Simpson for the
Inn team played the strongest game,
scoring a majority of the points, and
together with Caughell and Randau,
displaying a tremendous amount of
teamwork. Sigma Alpha Epsilon
was outplayed in every way, but put
up a game scrap. With a little prac
tice they would have given the Inn
team a hard run.
The second round of the series com
menced this afternoon, when Chi Psi
and Phi Gamma Delta fives clashed
for two fifteen-minute halves and the
Phi Kappa Sigma lined up against
Delta Upsilon.
