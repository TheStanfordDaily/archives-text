This is the truth and as good a dresser as any
man at Stanford used these exact words:
"The strongest argument in favor
of Ready-to-Wear Clothes IS Tailor-
Made Clothes."
He has suffered.

Dear ''Pop'' Franklin :
Was your photographic work satisfactory to
the Associated Students during the four years that
I was their manager? It was indeed, as the pic
tures of all the Varsity athletic teams in those
years hear witness. And it was not only the ex
cellence of your photographs, even of the most
difficult groups, but also the pleasure in enjoy
ing your genial manner and skill, in jollying the
various crowds of fellows into'proper position,
which caused us to return year after year.
I trust your nerves have stood the strain
of later generations and that the years have been
profitable.
Very truly yours,
(Signed) D. W. BURBANK.
