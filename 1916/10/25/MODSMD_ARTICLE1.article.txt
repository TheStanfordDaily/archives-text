# RUGBY RALLY TURNS LOOSE ENTHUSIASM
## BROWN HITS KEYNOTE Yell Leaders Head March to Training Table at Phi Psi House 
### 
Pulling out the cork that held rugby
enthusiasm bottled up during the pres
ent season, the Stanford students, led
by the yell leaders, marched, sang,
yelled, and let loose with every avail
aide noise-making implement, last
night, in the first spontaneous foot
ball rally of the semester.
After a general roundup of the Row,
the Hall, and the boarding houses,
the students, thrilled with the first
inkling of real pep since intercol
legiate activities last spring, thronged
toward the Phi Kappa Psi house, the
present home of the varsity football
men who are on the training table.
Arm-waving yell leaders and red fire
helped the long pent up rally spirit
break loose. In answer to the thund
erings of the enthusiasts, Captain Joe
Braden appeared and started the list
of speech-makers. "We're glad you're
here, and hope to show you that Stan
ford is better than Santa Clara on
November 11. We wish that the stu
dents as a whole felt what a job we
have on our shoulders, and would give
us more support, however," were the
words of the rangy skipper.
Coach and Trainer Speak.
Coach Brown and Trainer "Doc"
Reynolds, followed by Doctor .T. M.
Williams, '97, of I'alo Alto, told tlio
supporters of the team what the Big
Game meant, and what was expected
of the students. The small attendance
at the games and practices so far
was naturally criticized, but all of the
above speakers seemed confident that
Stanford men would show that they
were behind the team from now on
until the final struggle.
Lachmund, Carroll, Swigart and
Walker were dragged from hiding by
the yell leaders, and told the students
what the game meant to them, as
"members of the fifteen that would
meet the strong Mission Town aggre
gation. As a conclusion to the bring
ing forth of prominent footballers, the
whole training table, with the excep
tion of "Swede" Pettingill, who sought
the bath-tub for safety, were marched
out on a balcony where the rooters
could give them the once over.
After "Ilaii, Stanford, Hail," the
long-coming, but extremely success
ful rally was brought to a close with
a "Varsity" loud enough to be heard
in the opponents' training quarters at
Santa Clara.
