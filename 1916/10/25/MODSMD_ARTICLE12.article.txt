# STANFORD FOOTBALL POLICY FIRM
## Dr. Wilbur Issues Formal Statement To Students No Possible Chance of American Football Being Sub-stituted for Rugby at any Time by Old Game Enthusiasts 
### 
"Having set a standard after a careful survey of the past,
present and probable future, Stanford cannot and will not vacillate.
The soundness of this position will become increasingly evident ns time
goes by." These were the words of Doctor Wilbur to a committee of
students who interviewed him yesterday in an effort to find out if there
w;is not some possible opportunity of American football being substi
tuted for rugby at Stanford.
The football question is now definitely settled for all time. Stan-

ford will play rugby in the future,
and any action to the contrary on
the part of the students will be of
no avail. President Wilbur made
his position plain to the student
committee yesterday, and in a pub
lic report, considered to be a state
ment of football policy, the stand
that the head executive of the Uni
versity will take is very evident.
IL" the students should again cam
paign to change the style of football
to be played at Stanford, and should
vote for American, the question
would be turned over to the Academic
Council by the faculty. According to
Doctor Wilbur, this would mean a
discontinuance of intercollegiate ath
letic relations, some of the faculty and
Academic Council already being con
vinced that such relations are of no
benefit to the University.
Doctor Wilbur's complete statement
follows, as sent to The Daily Palo
Alto today from the President's of
fice.

"There lias been a rapid growth in
the resentment felt by many Univer
sity men and University faculties to-
I wards intercollegiate athletics, largely
|it seems to me because of the ex
, traneous coach and the by-products
: that go with him, professionalism,
i anything for victory, secret practice
! in football, failure to keep from in
| terfering with the University work of
i players and so on. American football,
j well known as a coach's game, is the
! greatest menace to intercollegiate
I athletics. Those of us who believe in
I friendly athletic relations between
neighboring universities, and in the
fine spirit of emulation and in the
breadth of acquaintance thus devel
oped, look with much concern to the
| future. A committee of investigation
lat Yale has recently suggested that
I abolition of intercollegiate relations
may be the only solution unless a halt
!is called somewhere in the present
| system.

SUCCESS FOR YEARS
"Some years ago the University of
, California and Stanford, fully cog
! nizant of the evils of the American
game as it had developed, decided to
| change to Rugby. In it they found a
I satisfying substitute which left noth
ing to be desired either in the way of
a sport or a spectacle. Proper in-
I struction in this game is desirable and
| possible, but it does not lend itself to
j becoming a coach's contest. Various
types of physique, strong individual
i possibilities and teamwork all come
j into it. It can be played alike by boys
I and middle-aged men. The best argu-
I ment for it is tho history of the Palo
| Alto high school rugby team.
"When 112 assumed my present, duties
as President of Stanford, I made a
careful survey of the history of ath
letics in California, as well as else
where. 1 asked for the help and ad-
vice of many of those most familiar
with the problem and was thoroughly
convinced that one of the wisest steps
as yet taken in America to keep inter
collegiate athletics free from abuses,
and consequently to make them per
manent, was the inauguration of the
Rugby game 011 this coast. Conse
quently, after getting a uniformly fav
orable expression of opinion from the
Athletic Advisory Board, the Faculty
Athletic Committee, the Executive
Committee of the Associated Students
and a majority vote in favor of Rugby
from the Associated Students, the con
tinuation of the Stanford policy of
playing Rugby was definitely assured.
Stanford can afford to do what it
thinks right, can afford to look ahead
and stand for certain ideals in sports
as well as in its other activities.
Having set a standard after a careful
survey of the past, present and prob
able future Stanford cannot and will
not vacillate. The soundness of this
position will become increasingly evi
dent as time goes by. The institutions
that pioneer, that go against the gen
eral current, no matter how saturated
it may be with evils or weak
nesses, must expect a struggle. No
one though dare say that the Ameri
can universities will continue in their
present supine and undignified atti
tude towards professionalized intercol
legiate athletics. They are bound to
see that emulation in great and
worthy purposes will outweigh ath
letic victories won by buying the
brains of any coach.
