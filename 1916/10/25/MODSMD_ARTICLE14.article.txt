# AMERICAN VS. RUGBY
## 
### 
According to an unappealable and
irrevocable mandate, Stanford Univer
sity must retain rugby football on the
athletic calendar, campus passports
for the American game being politely
but curtly withheld. Some exigencies
require diplomacy, coupled with well
oiled phraseology, while other situa
tions demand a frank, blunt expres
sion of unvarnished opinion—at pres
ent we deem plain speech to be at a
premium.
• • • • • • ♦ *
In company with a nigh majority o!
students, The Daily Palo Alto has
heartily favored the future introduc
tion of American football in Cardinal
sport circles. We sincerely believed
that the Old Game could be adopted
by Stanford without the accompany
ing evils that President Wilbur fears
must necessarily follow. Tt would be
folly to again summarize the argu
ments pro and con of this particular
question.
********
Before disappointedly waving the
red flag, two facts, which loom boldly
beyond any other issues of the dis
pute, must first be thoroughly digested
and appreciated. Future agitation in
behalf of American football comprises
wasted and unwise effort, since bump
ing one's head against a brick ob
struction does not properly picture
the absolute futility of waging a cam
paign against the administration.
Furthermore, the President announces
emphatically that any organized at
tempt to reinstate American football
at Stanford will not only be unsuc
cessful, but will result in the com
plete abolishment of intercollegiate
athletics by the Academic Council. Tf
one Flecherizes the significance of
these assertions, perhaps one may be
well on the road to recovery.

One word concerning the future, a
plea and counsel, following a careful
weighing and balancing of the issues.
Old Came advocates did their best to
install their favorite, but failed when
the administration patiently listened
and vetoed. Stanford men (under
scoring Stanford) will henceforth let
the curtain drop before American foot
ball discussions. Contention, dissatis
faction, and wrangling thereby pre
cipitated, merely can result in a di
vided student body and elimination of
intercollegiate athletics. Whether
American advocates or Rugby sup
porters, all are Stanford men, who
will pursue the course marked out
to tramp.
