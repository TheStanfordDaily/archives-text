# Krehbiel to Lecture on Neutrality Plans
## 
### 
Professor E. B. Krehbiel of the His
tory department will talk in the Little
Theater tonight at 7:30, on the
"American Neutral Peace Committee."
Some time ago Professor Krehbiel
spoke upon the same subject at a
meeting of the Cosmopolitan Club, and
it proved so interesting that the
Women's Debating Society has asked
him to speak again in order that more
may have an opportunity to hear him.
Anyone interested in the subject is
cordially invited.
