Issue Statement.
The University has just suffered a
severe loss in the death of Robert E.
Pellissier, Assistant Professor of Ro
manic Languages. Dr. Pellissier was
appointed Instructor in French in 1911
and three years later was promoted to
the rank of Assistant Professor. On
the outbreak of the European war he
took out a leave of absence and en
listed as a private in the French
army. His courage and ability soon
won him recognition and in Decem
ber last he was raised to the rank of
sergeant. He was killed in the great
Somme offensive on August 29th.
To do honor to the memory of Pro
fessor Pellissier. it is proposed to
raise a fund among the members and
friends of the University to be known
as the Pellissier Memorial Fund.
This fund is to be devoted to the fur
thering of the work of the American
Field Ambulance Service in France
by the purchase, or part purchase, of
an ambulance to be maintained for
one year. The total cost would be
$1600.
Tt is confidently expected that the
faculty, students, alumni and friends
of the University will embrace the op
portunity to make possible the main
tenance of a Stanford ambulance in
honor of a Stanford man who sacri
ficed his life at the call of duty.
Contributions may be sent to the
treasurer of the fund, or to any mem
ber of the committee. Checks should
be marked "Pellissier Memorial
Fund."

Issue Statement.
The University has just suffered a
severe loss in the death of Robert E.
Pellissier, Assistant Professor of Ro
manic Languages. Dr. Pellissier was
appointed Instructor in French in 1911
and three years later was promoted to
the rank of Assistant Professor. On
the outbreak of the European war he
took out a leave of absence and en
listed as a private in the French
army. His courage and ability soon
won him recognition and in Decem
ber last he was raised to the rank of
sergeant. He was killed in the great
Somme offensive on August 29th.
To do honor to the memory of Pro
fessor Pellissier. it is proposed to
raise a fund among the members and
friends of the University to be known
as the Pellissier Memorial Fund.
This fund is to be devoted to the fur
thering of the work of the American
Field Ambulance Service in France
by the purchase, or part purchase, of
an ambulance to be maintained for
one year. The total cost would be
$1600.
Tt is confidently expected that the
faculty, students, alumni and friends
of the University will embrace the op
portunity to make possible the main
tenance of a Stanford ambulance in
honor of a Stanford man who sacri
ficed his life at the call of duty.
Contributions may be sent to the
treasurer of the fund, or to any mem
ber of the committee. Checks should
be marked "Pellissier Memorial
Fund."
