# MR. WILSON IS BIG ARGUMENT FOR HUGHES
## SO PINCHOT PUTS IT Forester Scores Democrats for Their "Failure" to Keep Promises 
### 
President Wilson is the greatest
argument for the election of Charles
Evans Hughes to the presidency of
the United States. Resolved down to
a question of men, Hughes is the most,
desirable candidate, and in compari
son with the present administration,
the more favorable does the Repub
lican champion appear.
In* brief, this was the opinion of
Gifford Pinchot, and the argument
which he offered concerning the rival
presidential candidates in his talk in
the Stanford Union, this afternoon, to
convince his listeners that "Hughes is
a better man for the office than is
Wilson."
"What we most want to know," said
Pinchot, "is which man can we best
trust?" Pinchot's arguments an
swered the question by pointing to
Hughes as a man whose record has
been clean, and a man whom oppon
ents dare not assail as unreliable.
"I know no other man," declared
Gifford Pinchot, referring to the
President, "who could say one thing
and do another, and get away with it
as well as Mr. Wilson." In this re
gard, attention was directed to the
presidential treatment of the free tolls
question, the single term plank, and
the subsequent refusal to consider
woman's suffrage "because it was not
a part of the Democratic platform."
Pinchot severely criticized the Wil
sonian rule on other counts, on his
secrecy in dealing with affairs of
which the people should have been
informed, for his disposal of Philip
pine positions for patronage, for his
removal of trained men from office
and the appointment of less able sub
stitutes, for liis so-called fickleness in
regard lo tiio naval appropriations,
and preparedness, for his change in
attitude pertaining to the national
military reserve plan, and for his
handling of tlie Mexican situation.
"One of the greatest arguments ror
Wilson," Pinchot pointed out, "has
been that ho has kept us out of war.
Tint other Presidents have kept us
from war. Cleveland, in dealing with
the Venezuelan controversy with Eng
land, placed national honor above all.
Now tliis nation lias lost its stand
ing by a lack of firmness.
"Hughes has not. always been wise
in his political methods, because he
isn't a politician, but Hughes runs
true and straight to form. He is the
kind of man this country needs."
