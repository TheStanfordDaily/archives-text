# Irene Bonnet Will Interpret "Sadie" in "Show Shop"
## 
### 
Sadie of "The Show Shop" came
into her own last evening, when Miss
Irene Bonnett was selected, after com
petitive tryouts, to play the role of
the effervescent stenographer of the
Forbes comedy. Tryouts for the po
sition of Sadie yesterday wore a re
minder of Junior Opera days, with
the Assembly Hall echoing the high
S's of strained voices.
This occurred because one of the re
quirements of a "Show Shop" Sadie
is the ability of not knowing how to
sins. The typewriting girl in the
Sophomore comedy is quite an impor
tant factor of the play. Her lines
open the dialogue, and her mockery
of the actresses who visit the office
of her employer put over a great pro
portion of the first act laughs. He
cause she insists upon singing, and
does not understand the art, Sadie is
one of the funniest of stage stenog
raphers.
