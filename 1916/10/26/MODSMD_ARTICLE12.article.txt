# LICK SWIMMERS TO MEET FRESHMEN IN LOCAL POOL FRIDAY
## 
### 
Lick high school will journey from
San Francisco tomorrow to meet the
freshmen in a swimming meet in the
local pool at 4:30. The list of events
will include a 100-, and 220-yard
free style race, as well as a 100-yard
breast stroke and 50-yard back stroke.
A relay race is scheduled for the con
test. Norman Ross, '20, will probably
not swim for the freshmen, but will
be seen in exhibition events.
On Sunday, Ross will attempt one
ol' the hardest swimming feats known
