# 1920 RUGGERS EASILY BEAT SAN MATEO
## CHANGES ARE MADE 19 to 0 Is Final Score After One Hour's Strenuous Football 
### 
Playing ragged football during the
greater part of the game, but showing
occasional backfield form that swept
their opponents from their feet, the
freshmen yesterday defeated San
Mateo high school by a 19 to 0 score.
"Mush" Stevens handled the whistle,
and the bleachers can thank him for
the little speed that was displayed,
for Stevens halted the game only at
extreme violations of the official rules,
allowing the teams to play to the ad
vantage.
Try Out "Yali-Hoo" Yell.
One of the best midweek crowds
that has putin an attendance this sea
son was on hand to cheer the fresh
men, and to help the yell leaders in
the initial tryout of the now "Yah
hoo'' yell, expected to rival the famous
"Oski-Wow-wow" of the University of
California. The new yell was given
many times during the course of the
rugby game, the rooters taking to it
with enthusiasm.
"Bud" Larkin was back in the
tangle, playing for the first time since
the Santa Clara contest. He held
down the fullback berth during the
first half and moved into first five
eighths during the second period. His
work was of high order, and seemed
to put new life into the "baby" squad.
Shift in Lineup.
Coach "Dutch" Henry has made a
number of changes in the lineup and
is trying out some new men. The
freshmen, although the "numeral"
game has been played, have every in
ducement to stay out. Good games
are scheduled to fill out the season,
and the Graduate Manager is making
arrangements for the freshmen to take
an excellent trip. This will be made
either before the Big Game or during
the Thanksgiving vacation.
In yesterday's contest, Barneson,
Joerg, Larkin, Millington, Waylaiul
and Cass starred for the freshmen,
being 011 the ball at all times. Hunter
and Hirschey played well for the San
Mateo fifteen. The game was fought
hard, and the high school had the
freshmen on defense at. times. The
weight and endurance of the Univer
sity team told in the end and the
visitors were kept from scoring.
The freshmen trys were made by
Barneson, Campbell, Millington,
Toole and Joerg. Cass converted two
of the scores.
