# Speaker Tells What Is Known of Space
## Professor Keyser Entertains His Audience, But Leaves Hearers Amazed 
### 
. .It is a pleasure to sit still and have
some one fool you if you are satisfied
that he is not trying to sell you
osmething. Professor Cassius Jack
son Keyser was not trying to sell any
thing this morning—consequently stu
dents and faculty members were de
lighted to sit still and he deceived
into learning that the "Way to Pass
the Four Walls of the Earth" are
none.
Professor Keyser deceived his aud
ience most cleverly hv adroit use of
his personality a piece of chalk, and
a few ideas. Furthermore, his aud
ience was tickled at his tricks.
Wliat Space Is.
"In the words of Pastelle, space is
an infinite sphere whose center is
everywhere and whose surface is no
where," Professor Keyser said, and
began to prove the statement.
"Think of a point with a bundle of
lines going through it in every di
rection," and while everyone thought
and imagined, Professor Keyser intro
duced the infinite unit, Aleph, repre
sentative of the number of units bo
tween here and the end of things.
Then, after everyone had imagined
to his wit's ends, Professor Keyser
remarked, gently but firmly, that be
yond Aleph were "infinitely more points
than Aleph lying." And everyone
really felt that Aleph was lieing.
"Go as far as you will in infinite
space and liurl your javelin. If it
goes on there must he space for it to
go in—if it stops there must be space
in which to stop it. Thus space is
infinite."
And everyone present rose and sang
"Hail, Stanford, Hail," with the subtle
feeling, lie it the highest feeling or
the lowest, that this jolly visitor from
Columbia and California had "put
over something good," though no one
was rpiite certain that this was the
case.
