The statement issued in last night's
Daily Palo Alto concerning football,
affords a great many opportunities
that have heretofore been unavailable.
First, a unification of the student
body, divided through various misun
derstandings, must necessarily result.
This in turn will bring about the sec
ond effect of greater loyally to Stan
ford and a realization of the high
ideals upon which our University is
founded. Another, the clarification
and establishment of an unimpeach
able athletic policy that must live not
by our support only but by its own
worthiness.
The step taken by the President is
plainly a forward step and worthy of
every Stanford man's support.
