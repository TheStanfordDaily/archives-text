Although heartily favoring the adop
tion of the American game at first,
and doing all in my power to bring
about its adoption, after the interview
with Doctor Wilbur and having the
facts plainly presented to me, I realize
that no other game but rugby could
coincide with the policies of Stan
ford. In view of the fact, I believe
that every REAL Stanford man should
drop forever the idea of going back
to American and get behind rugby
and stick there.
