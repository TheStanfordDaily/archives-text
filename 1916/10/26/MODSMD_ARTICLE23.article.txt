We, who wanted American, could
not come out in the open for the old
game during the present rugby sea
son. and wanted the change too much
to idealize the present situation,
which did not and does not look good.
What we are to do now depends on
our common sense and what we
tliink of Dr. Wilbur. That is a mat
ter for each man to decide for him
self. Personally, 1 see 110 use in a
sore-head attitude or an infant revolu
tion, simply because it would be a
waste of energy and of 110 good to
Stanford. Also, 1 believe Dr. Wilbur
will do the square thing for the pres
ervation of intercollegiate athletics
But it's too early for me to throw up
my hat in glee.
