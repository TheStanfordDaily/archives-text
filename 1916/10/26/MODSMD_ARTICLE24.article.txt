Last spring, when it seemed pos
sible for us to play American football
fit Stanford, T tbat game my
hearty support. Hut now that our
policy has been decided for us —and
we are to play rugby—I am for sup
porting that policy.
We may be American enthusiasts,
or rugby supporters, but above all, we
should be for Stanford. We should
be for Stanford, first, last, and al
ways, and should do all we can to

make this season and every football
season a sncccss.
If every STANFORD man will set
behind the University and its policy,
there is no doubt but what we can
make rugby the standard game in
Northern California and our athletic
future will be an assured success.
