### 
Prohibition speakers, among them
J. Stitt Wilson of Socialistic fame,
swooped down on the campus yester
day and delivered a scathing attack
upon the liquor industries of the state.
Stationed in front of the Union at a
time when afternoon classes were let
ting out, it did not take long for a
crowd to gather.
Stitt Wilson was preceded in his
talk by Walter E. Evans, district at
torney of Multnomah county, Oregon,
of which Portland is the county seat.
Mr. Evans repudiated with cold facts
and figures the charges of the "wet"
contingent, that prohibition had ruined
Oregon.
Twice elected mayor of Berkeley on
the Socialist ticket, Stitt Wilson won
the crowd from the first with his con
vincing enthusiasm. His attack was
centered around three questions
which he directed at the liquor inter
ests. "This business cannot give one
proof of its ever having been a real
| mechanical, intellectual, or moral
help to the world's progress," said
Mr. Wilson.
In reply to the second question,
"What use is tlie liquor business?" it.
was pointed out that no benefit had
ever resulted to the body, mind, or
character through the workings of
this industry. The third question
dealt, with the product, of the liquor
business.
Mr. Wilson was followed by E. L.
Rich, '03, who has charge of the "dry"
campaign in the Santa Clara district,
who explained briefly the significance
of the two prohibition amendments.
