# Encina Hall to Be Scene of Upperclass Jolly-Up
## 
### 
The Coleman String Quartet has
been engaged to play during the eve
ing for the upperclass jolly-up, which
is to be held on November 4 in Encina
Hall. Individual stunts also will be
given between dances. A three-piece
orchestra will furnish the dance
music. Because of the scarcity of
men at some of the jolly-ups held
this semester, the committee decided
to invite 110 underclass women. An
efficient method of introduction has
been planned by those in charge.
