Realizing that if progress of aero
nautics continues to be as swift as it
lias been in the last few years, in live
■ years from now aircraft will be used
extensively for commercial purposes,
and the aeronautic held will afford
splendid opportunities for the young
men who are now at universities fitting
themselves for agtive life, the Aero
Club of America, to interest college
men in aeronautics has decided to of
fer three medals of merit to Stanford,
to be awarded to the three students
who write the best essays by March

(1) Military aeronautics;
(2) Mechanics of the aeroplane and

Great Opportunities.
"Young men who are now in univer
sities, fitting themselves for active life
[are the men who will live in this new
aerial age—and they have much to
give and much to receive from it.
"The fact that the American aero
nautic industry now has about $50.-
000,00(1 worth of business, and that as
soon as aircraft are being employed
for carrying mail, in the Coast Guard
Service, and for general purposes,
which may begin with the coming
spring, there will be an even greater
development, makes us realize that
undoubtedly, this field affords extra
ordinary opportunity for the young
men who are now at the universities
fitting themselves for active life.
"Aeroplanes are rapidly growing in
size and speed, and there arc aero
planes being constructed to lift 15
tons, and which are undoubtedly cap
able of flying across the Atlantic.
What the next, five years will bring
forth no one can anticipate, but after
witnessing the tremendous flevelop
ment that has taken place in the
past three years, we cannot but admit
that the next five years will see the
advent of the Aerial Age—the employ
ment of aircraft for general utilitar
ian purposes.
