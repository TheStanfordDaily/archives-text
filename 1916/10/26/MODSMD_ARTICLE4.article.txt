# Yah—Ho-o-o!.. Hoo—Ya-a-h!. .. Newest Yell
## 
### 
Here's something weird, hair
raisins, without sense, without
reason, ghostly, uncanny, but full
of jazz and pel), to be tried on
your piazza when you get home
tonight.
It's the newest yell creation
under the sun, composed by the
yell committee. It has been ded
icated to the 1 1G rugby season.
It will be known as the Yah-Hoo
yell.
Now, a Yah-Hoo may be a bird,
or a bug, or a biped—but the
Yah-Hoo yell is a bear —of a yell.
Here it is—try it.
Tlie Ynli-Hoo.
Ow-w-w-w-w - - - - rah,

Hooyah ----- TTooyah,

Stan ford,
Ow-w-w-w-w-rah !
