Crosscountry enthusiasts have a
treat in store in the near future with

and many good men will be out for
their numerals. The course for the
interclass will be staked out this af
ternoon so as to follow no hard roads,
and the squad will go over it for the
first time tomorrow. In order to give
new men a good chance, all those
who have previously won their num

It is expected that this method will
make the competition keener and sc
