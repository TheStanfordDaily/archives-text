# Get Back of Rugby Urges Conference
## Committee to Look Into Matter of Placing Restriction on Office Holders 
### 
That rugby football should be
whole-heartedly supported by all in
dividuals, as well as organizations, as
a body, was the consensus of opinion
among members of Men's Conference
at last night's meeting. Tt was sug
gested along this line that all refer
ence to American football be elimin
ated.
The question of restricting men
from holding too many executive and
other student body positions was taken
up. A committee will be appointed by
.T. W. Templeton, '17, to investigate
the entire matter and especially the
plan proposed by L. D. Summerfield,
'12, which provided for the ranking
of all organizations and activities in
a point system.
According to this system, an execu
tive office, captaincy, etc., would give
the person holding it so nianV points.
When he has so acquired a certain
number of points he will be made in
eligible to hold further office.
The commttee which is to be ap
pointed is expected to bring in a re
port to the fonferenee regarding the
advisability of adopting the system,
after which the organization is ex
pected to take some action.
