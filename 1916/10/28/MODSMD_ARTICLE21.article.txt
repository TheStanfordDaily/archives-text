# Questionable Story Brings Five Hours
## Council Takes Action When Junior Fails to Use Good Judgement 
### 
Three recommendations of the Men's
Student Council adding graduation re
quirements and placing students upon
probation, were made public today.
Five hours added to the number of
units necessary to graduate a junior
student were deemed proper punish
ment for causing a questionable ar
ticle to be printed in a campus pub
lication; a senior student was placed
under probation as regards his per
sonal conduct for the remainder of
the semester, as punishment for his
part in the melee following the Alpha
Phi fire, and a member of the Confer
ence exonerated from similar charges
of misconduct, were the actions an
nounced today.
The sentences and the pardon were
issued over the signatures of J. W.
Templeton, '17, head of the Men's Stu
dent Council; E. P. Lesley, chairman
of the Student Affairs Committee of
the faculty, and Dr. R. L. Wilbur.
In the case of the questionable ar
ticle, the editor of the publication was
warned. Tt was demonstrated by the
guilty author that he had in no way
intended to pen anything that could
have been deemed objectionable.
