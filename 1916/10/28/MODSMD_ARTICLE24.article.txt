# FOOTBALL PRACTICE UNDER SEARCHLIGHTS AT U.C.
## 
### 
Football practice on a field illumin
ated by searchlights is an innovation
to be introduced at the University of
California in order that more time
may be spent in preparation for the
big game with Washington. Large re
flectors from the Greek Theater are
to be moved to the football field and
with the aid of powerful searchlights
it will be made possible to practice
until 6:30.
