# STANFORD WOMEN JOIN TO SIMPLIFY STYLES OF DRESS
## 
### 
As a part of the nation-wide move
ment to standardize women's dress,
Stanford women are cooperating with
those of Palo Alto in forming an or
ganization to be known as the Re
sartus Club. If the plans of this
movement become effective women's
dress will be reduced to two or three
styles, suitable for all occasions.
For day and street wear, the club
has recommended to its members the
so-called "Piping Rock" suit. This
has a plain skirt, from two and a half
to three yards in width, and from
four to seven inches from the ground,
made preferably upon a waist, so that
the skirt may be supported from the
shoulders. A plain, loosely fitting
coat and a blouse are included in the
proposed street outfit.
Miss Harriett Bradford, Dean of
Women, expressed herself regarding
the new movement, today, as follows:
"Simplified dress is very advisable,
but I am not sure that I could ap
prove of a standardized form for
everybody. Simplified dress while in
college, will fit women to better suc
ceed in occupation and life after col
lege. I am interested to see what
will come of the movement."
Miss Dorothy Metz, '17, head of the
Women's Conference, said: "I do
not believe in one style of dress for
all women. It is better for each
woman to follow her own individual
taste, than for all to assume one uni
form. Wearing of extravagant
clothes, lace waists and the like by
Stanford women on the Quad, is a dis
play of poor taste and lack of knowl
edge as to how to dress properly.
Enforcement of dress uniformity
won't work. It will kill individual
ity."
Genevieve Morse, '16, declared: "I
approve simplicity of dress, but am
against any set style. I think the
matter of style should be left to the
individual. Otherwise women's dress
at Stanford might become too much
like that in a convent."
Nellita Choate, '17, was of the fol
lowing opinon: "I feel that any
standardization of women's dress
would tend to detract from the vari
ety and picturesqueness of life. T am
opposed to any arbitrary mode, and
would like to see the time when
women will follow their individual
tastes so exclusively that one in Grec
ian robes would be quite as accept
able as another in breeches and waist
coat. Tn regard to the present move
ment on the campus, T am not pre
pared to express an opinion, due to
lack of familiarity with its raison d'
etre.
