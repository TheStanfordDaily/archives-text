### 
Beginning Wednesday, the present
five-cent loaf of bread will cost six
cents, and the dime loaf, twelve cents,
at all Palo Alto bakeries. A similar
raise in price will go into effect all
over the state. High cost of flour,
caused by the rise in wheat, owing
to European demand and speculation,
in turn has necessitated the increase
in price of bread to the ultimate
consumer. Two years ago flour cost
$5.40 a barrel in Palo Alto. Now the
price is $0.05.
