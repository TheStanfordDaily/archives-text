# FLUNK RUMOR FALSE, SAYS O.L. ELLIOTT
## NO NEW RESTRICTION Regulations Affect Only Those Receiving Satisfactory Grades in Clases 
### 
That a report now being circulated
by word of mouth over the campus,
that a certain percentage of each class
will have to he dunked under a new
ruling of the faculty, is false, is the
statement of Doctor O. L. Elliott, reg
istrar, made today.
Dr. Elliott and other faculty mem
bers have been unable to account for
the story, which has been growing In
force since the faculty regulations of
last week.
Lust Semester Regulation.
The only regulations which affect
the percentage of students who receive
a certain kind of grade, are those
made last semester, which recommend
that a certain percentage of students
who receive a passing grade shall be
given certain marks.
The ruling, which has nothing to do
with the number of students who fail,
reads, "A shall be considered as nor
mally applicable to not more than
15%, Band C to 35% each, and D to
15% of passing grades. This valu
ation of grades is advisory, but its
use generally by members of the in
struction staff is urged. It is un
derstood to admit of a certain degree
of flexibility in the handling of small
classes."
Not for Small Classes.
The ruling, then, applies only to
those who pass, is advisory only, and
need be applied only when the profes
sor so desires, and is not designed for
small classes. It is flexible, Iliat it
may not work hardship unfairly in
some classes.
Members of the Stanford Women's
Club met for their first social supper
last night, in the Women's Club
House, from 6 to 8. Coffee and pump
kin pie were served by the clubhouse
board of directors. Stanford women
from the classes of '97 to '20 were
present, and a marked atmosphere of
that unity which the clubhouse was
intended to create was felt. All stu
dents not having paid their dues arc
urged to do so before the next get
together.
