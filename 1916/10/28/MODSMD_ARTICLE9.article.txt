# Women Eligible for 1919 Quad Tryouts
## Committee Comes to Decision After Investigation of Other Colleges 
### 
Women are eligible to compete in
the 1919 Quad tryouts both for the
position of editor and for that of man
ager. This decision was made last
night by the 1919 Quad tryout com
mittee. At the University of Califor
nia, some women do even better work
than the men in the tryouts. A num
ber of years ago the Stanford Quad
had a woman editor. Any 1919 wo
men who wish to tryout should call
up Palo Alto 676 W.
Amount of Work Basis.
Amount of work will be the sole ba
sis on which candidates for 1919 Quad
manager wil be nominated, according
to the decision last night. The ques
tion of managerial ability wil be left
to the present sophomore class to de
cide.
I.imit Managerial Tryouts.
Owing to the fact that there will be
no advertisements in this year's an
nual, there is much less work to he
done by sophomore candidates. Col-
lection of junior and organization
dues will be the chief tasks. As all
junior dues and photographs must he
in by November loth, the first part of
the tryouts wil lie over shortly. Or
ganizations, including fraternities,
have until February 1st to get their
group pictures taken and pay for
space in the yearbook, and manager
ial competition in hustling those, will
of course end at this time.
