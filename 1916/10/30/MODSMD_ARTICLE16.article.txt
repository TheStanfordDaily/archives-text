# VARSITY WINS BUT NOT WITHOUT FRIGHT
## P.A.A.C. SURPRISES Visitors Lead Cardinals at End of Half; Final Score Favors Stanford 36 to 9 
### 
Stanford rooters were given the
worst scare of the season when the
varsity met the speedy Palo Alto Ath
letic Club on the local turf Satur
day. The game ended with the Card
inal victorious by a 26 to 9 score, but
the result was nothing to be proud of,
taking all things into consideration.
The Athletic Club led by a 9 to 3
count at the end of the first period,
and it was only superior condition on
the part of the varsity that made it
possible for them to sweep the field
after the interval, and run up twenty
three points.
O'Lsiine's 11 uii Feutures.
The Palo Alto Club rushed the var
sity off its feet in the first half. Har
vey started the scoring, drop-kicking
a goal from the thirty-five yard line
on a penalty. After the varsity drib
bled the ball to their opponents'
twenty-yard line, Hammon scooped
the sphere, passed to O'Laine, who
proceeded to pull the feature play of
the day. He circled the Stanford line,
left the Cardinal pursuers behind, and
ran fully eighty yards for a try. Har
vey failed to convert from a hard
angle. The final three points of the
visitors' score were chalked up when
Referee Palmer Fuller awarded an
other free kick on the thirty-yard
mark. Harvey sent the ball between
| the posts. The end of the half found
j the varsity on defense, Swlgart hoot
ing the ball out to save a score.
With the clubmen winded, owing to
their lack of condition, and the var
sity showing the effects of the
coaches' words during the intermis
sion, the play changed in the second
half. The Stanford team showed new
life and kept their opponents on de
fense most of the time. There were
few stars on the Cardinal fifteen, how
ever, Wilkins, substituting for Walker,
looming up as a real varsity pros
pect, and Templeton saved his team
by long and timely boots to touch.
Bihlman, appearing on the varsity for
the first time this season, did well.
Stanford won two of the other three
games played, and tied the remaining
contest. In the morning the third
varsity defeated the Palo Alto high
! school team by a 21 to 13 score, while
j the freshmen beat the College of Pa
: cific in the afternoon curtain-raiser,
jll to fi being the final count. In the
last game of the day, the Stanford
] second varsity and the Barbarian Club
played to an 8 to 8 tie.
