# Santa Clara Defeats Olympic Ruggers
## Hard Fought Game Ends With Mission Men Scoring 25 to 5 
### 
Santa Clara defeated the Olympic
Club yesterday in a bitterly contested
game by a score of 24 to 5. The
Winged "O" men crossed the Santa
Clara line in the second half for the
first time this year, Art. Erb being the
successful clubman to fall on the ball,
which was booted across the line by
Hanley.
The game was hard fought, the
Olympics continually trying to pene
trate the Mission defense, without
success. Tt was for the most part a
forward's game, the ball seldom com
ing out. of the scrums cleanly. In the
first half, play was for the most part
in the Olympic territory, but in the
second half, the Santa Clarans could
not get started and as a result the
play was entirely in their territory.
Coschina, Korte, Diaz. Leberveau,
and Shultz were much in the lime
light. for the collegians, while Guerin,
Flannagan, Erb and Urban put up
their usual good game for the Olym
pics.
