finds democracy and personal inde
pendence opposed by mechanical ver
botans ;ind arid provincialism, con
trasting German kulture and naive
French charm. The significance lies
not so much in statistics, but the dif
ference exhibited in the spirit of the
people. Doubts assail one whether
the proffered rationality is worth the
price of resulting perversion and dis
content. A natural healthy resent
ment arises against deluded puritan
ical squeamishness that is ccrtain to
spread other odious and insufferable
theories.

Although there exists many effect
ual and desirable reforms of the
liquor problem exemplified in other
states and nations, yet in their pro
vincial ardor the proponents of amend
ments one and two insist upon either
complete annihilation of California's
greatest industry through prohibition
or discontinuance of retail liquor
trade, the latter labeled a necessary
forerunner of prohibition. Remedies
such as graduated taxation of liquors
according to alcoholic strength; re
striction of spiritous beverages, such
as whiskies and brandies; genuine
regulation of the saloon similarly tc
the Norwegian system; blacklisting
known alcoholics; enforcement of law
through unimpeachable officials; or
an attempt at temperance rather than
tax profils—differ from the suggested
operation of severing one's hand tc
cure a wart. Amendments one and
two should be voted down as prim
itive, fanatical, repressive and unwise
legislation.
