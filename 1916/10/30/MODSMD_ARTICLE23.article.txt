# Button Birds . . . . Gobble Dimes . . . . For Yah-hoo
## 
### 
Have you seen it? —an even
stranger creature than the wild
Yah-lioo. Quite inoffensive look
ing at first, it might readily be
mistaken for a Stanford "Stiule,"
but for the wild uncanny gleam in
its eye and the little oblong box
it carries. It belongs to the bug
family, and in unscientific terms
is known as the camera-loony
bug.
Such a bird was observed all
over the campus, yesterday, and
every time he perched upon a coat
lapel, he picked off a dime for the
collection which will build the big
Yah-hoo bird, to be placed upon
Ewing Field the day of the big
game. This mascot is to put fear
■ in the hearts of the Santa Clara
men.
