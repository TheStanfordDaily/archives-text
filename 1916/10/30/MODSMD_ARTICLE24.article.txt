# DEFEAT OLYMPIC CLUB IN SOCCER
## 
### 
In a game marked by rather ragged
playing, due partly to the slippery
condition of Ewing Field, the Card
inal varsity soccer eleven played the
Olympic Club, Saturday, for a 2 to 1
victory. Across the bay, the Allies
met defeat at the hands of the All
Star aggregation, the score standing
1 to 0 at. the end of the game.
A change was made in the second
half of the game, when Wheatly, play
ins; goal, shifted places with Farrell
of the forward pack. Alderton, at
left half, played a consistently steady
game. The two tallies for the varsity
were made by Wheatly and McMahon.
The varsity through winning this
game continues to be tied with the
All Stars for first place in the Uni
versity and Club Soccer League.
