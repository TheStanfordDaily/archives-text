# SHOW SHOP BOOST FOR STANFORD DRAMATICS
## SEAT SALE TUESDAY Sophomores Almost Ready for Production of Play Within a Play Next Friday 
### 
"Say what you want," declared a
former Stanford newspaper man and
dramatic critic, the other night, as he
viewed a rehearsal of the 1919 Sopho
more play, "but dramatics here are
certainly on the uphill road."
The erstwhile writer of college
drama was sitting well in front in the
Assembly Hall as Frank Mathieu di
rected the big fight scene of "Dora's
Dilemma," the play whose hair-rais
ing climax is shown in the tricky third I
act of "The Show Shop."
"We used to go to sophomore plays
to wait for the 'bonehcad' stunts," the
critic said. "I suppose people come
now to be entertained, just as they
would in San Francisco. This show'Jl
do it, all right. Lots of action."
This outsider's opinion of "Show
Shop" rehearsals makes anticipation
the keener for the appearance of the
sophomores in the Assembly Hall next i
Friday evening.
