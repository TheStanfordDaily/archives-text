Dear ''Pop'' Franklin:
Was your photographic work satisfactory to
the Associated Students during the four years that
I was their manager? It was indeed, as the pic
tures of all the Varsity athletic teams in those
years bear witness. And it was not only the ex
cellence of your photografhs, even of the most
difficult groups, but also the pleasure in enjoy
ing your gonial manner and skill, in jollying the
various crowds of fellowo into proper position,
which caused us to return year after year.
I trust your nerves have stood the strain
of later generations and that the years have been
prof i table.
Very truly yours,
(Signed) D. W. BURBANK.
