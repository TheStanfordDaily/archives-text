# GEOLOGY MEN STRENGTHEN HONOR SYSTEM
## UPPERCLASSMEN ACT Pledge Selves to Eliminate Cheating and Punish Offenders 
### 
As a result of the recent action of
the Academic Council, upperclassmen
in the Geology and Mining depart
ments have drawn up an honor sys
tem, which lias been approved by
professors and by President Wilbur,
and will go into effect at once.
The Geology and Mining deparment
honor system makes all students re
sponsible for enforcing honesty in
classes and in examinations. Upper
classmen in the departments have
taken it upon themselves to see that
cheating is a minus quantity, and
when they arc unable to cope with
the situation themselves, will refer of
fenders to the Student Council.
Draw l r p I'lans.
The present attention to the honor
system was brought up at the in
stance of the Geology and Mining so
ciety, which desired to strengthen the
system already prevailing. The honor
platform of the upperclassmen,
framed under the auspices of the so
ciety, follows:
"We, the upperclassmen of the
Geology and Mining department, do
hereby agree (with the permission of
the faculty) to maintain the honor
sytem in this department. The con
ception of the honor system here to
bo maintained, sliall be a mutual and
reciprocal confidence among the stu- j
dents and the faculty, as outlined by
a statement, from Professor Willis.
Discipline Cheater.
"If at any time it should transpire
that a student be found offending
against this 'gentlemen's agreement,'
he shall be disciplined at the discre
tion of upperclassmen of this depart
ment. it shall be the duty of any
I person seeing or knowing of any of
fense against this agreement, to act
| immediately for bis loyalty to the
honor system, the department, and the
University."
This statement is signed by D. B.
Carroll, '1(5, TT. 11. Dievendorff, '17,
and A. C. Mattel, '17.
Professor Bailey Willis, head of tlio
department, has outlined the honor
system as it is understood by the
geology and mining faculty. It fol
lows:
"The honor system consists in a
mutual understanding between stu
dents and instructors tlmt cheating
will neither be practiced nor toler
ated. It assumes that instructors may
trust the students to be honest, ft
implies that every student will resist
any temptation to take advantage of
the confidence placed in him and will
inform any fellow student, or may do
so, that cheating will not be toler
ated by those who are honestly work
ing for the degree that he is trying
to get fraud.
"The honor system can be main
tained only if supported by the stu
dents themselves. The power to con
trol cheating lies with them. A per
sistent offender should be made to
realize that be had better leave Stan
ford as soon and with as little pub
licity as possible.
"In case any group of honest stu
dents should be unable to control fel
low students who are not honest, ap
peal lies to the Student Council. The
advice of any instructor may be
sought, if desired. Thus back of the
initiative of the honest students
I stands the Department faculty. We
desire to practice the honor system.
We do not wish to have to take meas
ures against cheating. But the honor
[system is based on confidence and con
fidence can spring only from the
| united action of the students. Will
'you as a body ai;ree to uphold us and
help maintain the honor system?"
The resolution passed by the stu
dents was transmitted by Mr. Willis
to President Wilbur, who replied:
"I have your interesting communi
cation in regard to the adoption of
the honor system by the uppcrclass
men in the Department of Geology and
Mining. This fits into the plan adopt
ed by the faculty, and T hope and
trust it will he a great success."

Professor Bailey Willis, head of tlio
department, has outlined the honor
system as it is understood by the
geology and mining faculty. It fol
lows:
"The honor system consists in a
mutual understanding between stu
dents and instructors tlmt cheating
will neither be practiced nor toler
ated. It assumes that instructors may
trust the students to be honest, ft
implies that every student will resist
any temptation to take advantage of
the confidence placed in him and will
inform any fellow student, or may do
so, that cheating will not be toler
ated by those who are honestly work
ing for the degree that he is trying
to get fraud.
"The honor system can be main
tained only if supported by the stu
dents themselves. The power to con
trol cheating lies with them. A per
sistent offender should be made to
realize that be had better leave Stan
ford as soon and with as little pub
licity as possible.
"In case any group of honest stu
dents should be unable to control fel
low students who are not honest, ap
peal lies to the Student Council. The
advice of any instructor may be
sought, if desired. Thus back of the
initiative of the honest students
I stands the Department faculty. We
desire to practice the honor system.
We do not wish to have to take meas
ures against cheating. But the honor
[system is based on confidence and con
fidence can spring only from the
| united action of the students. Will
'you as a body ai;ree to uphold us and
help maintain the honor system?"
The resolution passed by the stu
dents was transmitted by Mr. Willis
to President Wilbur, who replied:
"I have your interesting communi
cation in regard to the adoption of
the honor system by the uppcrclass
men in the Department of Geology and
Mining. This fits into the plan adopt
ed by the faculty, and T hope and
trust it will he a great success."
As a result of the recent action of
the Academic Council, upperclassmen
in the Geology and Mining depart
ments have drawn up an honor sys
tem, which lias been approved by
professors and by President Wilbur,
and will go into effect at once.
The Geology and Mining deparment
honor system makes all students re
sponsible for enforcing honesty in
classes and in examinations. Upper
classmen in the departments have
taken it upon themselves to see that
cheating is a minus quantity, and
when they arc unable to cope with
the situation themselves, will refer of
fenders to the Student Council.
Draw l r p I'lans.
The present attention to the honor
system was brought up at the in
stance of the Geology and Mining so
ciety, which desired to strengthen the
system already prevailing. The honor
platform of the upperclassmen,
framed under the auspices of the so
ciety, follows:
"We, the upperclassmen of the
Geology and Mining department, do
hereby agree (with the permission of
the faculty) to maintain the honor
sytem in this department. The con
ception of the honor system here to
bo maintained, sliall be a mutual and
reciprocal confidence among the stu- j
dents and the faculty, as outlined by
a statement, from Professor Willis.
Discipline Cheater.
"If at any time it should transpire
that a student be found offending
against this 'gentlemen's agreement,'
he shall be disciplined at the discre
tion of upperclassmen of this depart
ment. it shall be the duty of any
I person seeing or knowing of any of
fense against this agreement, to act

honor system, the department, and the
