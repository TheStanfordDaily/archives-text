# To Get Special Fare to Santa Clara Game
## 
### 
Graduate Manager E. C. Behrens
has concluded arrangements with the
Southern Pacific Railway company
for a special rate of $1.20 from Palo
Alto to San Francisco and return for
the Stanford-Santa Clara big game on
November 11. These tickets will go
on sale Friday afternoon, the 10th of
November, and will be good to Mon
day morning.
Though at first sight this might not.
seem to be a great reduction in the
rate, under ordinary rules of the ex
cursion department of the Southern
Pacific, excursion tickets must be
used on the special train and are
good just for the day.
Tickets sold at this $1.20 rate may
lie used on any train and not just
on the special. Southern Pacific com
pany have also announced a rate of
a fare and a third from all points of
the state on account of the Big Game.
