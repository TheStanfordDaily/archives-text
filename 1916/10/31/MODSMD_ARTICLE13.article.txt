ceived a telegram from Washington
stating that surgeons were needed for

Lane Hospital a few minutes after re
ceiving the message, Dr. Wilbur met
Beasley on the steps, and asked him
if he wanted to respond to the tele
graphic appeal.
"Yes, I'll go," was Beasley's imme
diate response.
"When will you be ready?" asked
Dr. Wilbur.
"I'm afraid T can't make it this af
ternoon, but I will be ready to leave
in -the morning," and Dr. Beasley had
settled his plans for a year.

While serving in the Spanish-Amer
ican war, Beasley performed several
acts of personal bravery for which
lie is still commended. Tn a retreat
of his company across a river, a com
rade fell 011 the bank before "making"
the river. With the remainder of the
company safely across the river,
Beasley espied his wounded comrade
on the far bank, and without hesita
tion swam back and rescued the fallen
soldier, being under fire of the enemy
throughout.
