# FRATERNITIES IN FAVOR OF CONFERENCE
## BETTER SCHOLARSHIP Will Form an Inter-Fraternity Organization, Each House Being Represented 
### 
Sentiment toward the formation of
the proposed [nterfraternity Confer
ence, as indicated by the affirmative
vote of nine of the twelve houses
which took i ction last night, seems
to be detinit< ly favorable. Eight of
the chapters saw lit to postpone ac
tion until nex .Monday, while of those
voting "no" t.vo did so conditionally,
and indicated their willingness to
favor the plan with certain changes.
I'lun Provides for Conference.
The constitution which was pro
posed by a committee of seven of the
fraternity representatives at a meet
ing held last Thursday night, provides
for a conference, which shall be com
posed of one member from each fra
ternity chapter on the campus. The
executive work of this committee is
to be in the hands of an executive
i council composed of the president of
the conference, a member of the fac
ility, who must be a member of a fra
i ternity established at Stanford, and
i three students picked from the con-
I fere nee.
The by-laws, which are appended to
the constitution as voted on last night,
govern the initiation of freshmen,
transfers, and other students. In re
gard to freshmen, the by-laws provide
that they may he pledged in the first
semester, as before, but that no fresh
man may be initiated until the second
semester, and then only on condition
that he has made at least seventy-five
per cent of his hours in the preceding
semester. However, a freshmen may
lose one five-hour course, and, pro
viding this does not put him on pro
bation, will still be permitted to be
initiated into the organization. Any
freshmen not qualifying for initiation
on the grounds stated, will not be per
mitted to board or room in the chap
ter house.
He may keep his pledge, however,
and can be initiated at such a time as
he has made seventy-five per cent of
his combined hours for the preceding
semesters. All other students must
have made at least seventy-five per
cent of their hours in preceding se
mesters before they are eligible for
initiation. Fraternity men who are
transfers will not be eligible for af
filiation with the chapter at Stanford
unless Ihey have had at least one se
mester of accredited work at the in
stitution from which they transferred.
The constitution and by-laws, if
adopted by fraternities, will not be
effective until August, 1917. Another

meeting of fraternity representatives
will probably be held next, week, at
which time they will be prepared to
vote for their respective houses.
The vote among the twenty-one fra
ternities on the adoption of the consti
tution was as follows:
For the plan—Alpha Tan Omega,
Beta Theta Pi, Chi Psi. Delta Chi,
Delta Tail Delta, Delta Upsilon, Phi
Kappa Psi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sig
ma Chi.
