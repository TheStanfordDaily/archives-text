# "Show Pep and We'll Win"â€”--Captain Braden
## 
### 
Football enthusiasm broke loose
again last night, resulting in the sec
ond spontaneous rally of the season
being held at the varsity training
quarters. Several hundred howling
students gathered on the large lawn
in the rear of the Phi Kappa Psi
house at 7:30, and brought the whole
campus to attention by rousing yells.
"You fellows show this kind of pep
from now on until the day of the game,
and show a little more on November
11, and the team will do the rest,"
Captain Joe Braden, the first speaker,
told the rooters.
Trainer Reynolds, Pelouze, Swigart,
Pettingill, Lachmund, Templeton. and
Graduate Manager Belirens all echoed
Captain Braden's sentiments, and all
seemed glad that the students are be
ginning to realize the stiff proposi
tion the varsity will face when they
meet the Santa Clara fifteen.
"Squire" Belirens told the enthus
iasts that lie thought the victory of
last year would be repeated. "They
have a bunch of fighters, however,
and we don't want to get over-con
fident," he added.
Yell Leaders Gilroy, llauser, and
Speers helped put enthusiasm into the
rally while several kinds of musical
instruments and a good supply of red
fire livened up the occasion.
"Hail, Stanford, Hail," and a "Var
sity" brought the rally to a close.
