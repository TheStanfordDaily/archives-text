Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Obviously the inspiration which
produced last night's editorial ar
raignment of "puritanical squeamish
ness" must have had some origin.
The alleged "wet" majority of last
week seems to be the logical source.
Far be it from the writer to say how
a paper should be run, or that the ed
itor was not acting "within bounds;"
but the appearance of the article
brings the question into the realm of
student discussion. Dismissing all
personal opinions in order that any
approach to the Plug Ugly fiasco of
last year may be averted, let there be
a frank and friendly consideration.
I One feature stands out very clearly.
The Daily Palo Alto is the only re
spectable paper in Northern Califor
nia besides the San Francisco "Call,"
which lias been brave enough in this
campaign to defend the saloon. Not.
even the San .Tosc "Evening Post,"
published solely for anti-prohibition
campaign purposes, has had the nerve
to do that, but has "hidden" behind
the wine industry. According to the
Chicago Tribune, there are over SOO
real newspapers in the country now
refusing liquor ads and opposing the
traffic editorially. In the face of these
facts, to have courage of one's con
victions strongly enough to express
them as has been done is admirable,
while the distinction to be gained is
equally notorious.
Considering the two cardinal points
of argument advanced, the writer
would like to submit to campus in
telligence these questions: Is the
wine industry "California's greatest
industry?" Secondly: Was it "puri
tanical squeamishness" that led the
Hoard of Trustees to abolish liquor
from this campus and liquor ads from
campus publications, as well as to
work for the passage of the "one and
one-half mile dry zone" bill for uni
versities? Was it "puritanical squeam
ishness" which led of> per cent of the
railroads to adopt Rule "G?" or Doc
tor Jordan 1o say that "alcoholism is
the second greatest evil confronting
the human race," and advocate prohi
bition as the remedy?
