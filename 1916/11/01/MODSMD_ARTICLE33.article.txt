"The great defect of American edu
cation is mediocrity. Tt is rather
good, but not good enough," accord
ing to Dr. Mary Whiton Calkins, who
lectured on "The Aristocratic and
Democratic Tdoals in Education," in
the Little Theater last night. Dr.
Calkins asserted +hat American
schools turn out more average stu
dents "serviceable in the average
world," than the European schools,
but fewer real scholars.
She believes that this is duo to the
democratic attitude in this country,
for in England, Germany and France,
the favored few. composed of children
of rank or of exceptional ability, are
trained with exceptional care at the
expense of the less fortunate. A
greater fusion of the democratic with
the aristocratic ideal is necessary,
says Dr. Calkins, for both are too val
uable to lose.
