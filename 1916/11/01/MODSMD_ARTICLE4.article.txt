# What Ho! 1920 Maid Ordered to Appear for Duty at Bonfire
## 
### 
Dear Miss Church:* You are
expected to appear ready for work
on the Freshman Bonfire, east of
the Quad, on the above hours.
So read a post-card received by Miss
Dell Church, 20. That is, she read it
that way. It really said, Dear Sir.
But she had overlooked that saluta
j tion. The "above" hours were truly
high over her head —7-9 p.m., 12-4 a.m.,
| 4-6 p.m. Miss Church was confused.
She had never chopped wood, and
j had shown little talent for construct
| ing bonfires. Still she was a fresh
j man—her duty lay before her.
But a friend explained. "Dell" is
ja dangerous name in directories, Miss
(Church has decided. It can mean.Del
j phine, Delaware, or Delia. But the
I freshman bonfire committeemen
i thought it stood for Delbert. A care
j less error!
