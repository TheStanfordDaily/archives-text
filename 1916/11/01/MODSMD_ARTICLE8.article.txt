# SECOND VARSITY DESERVING OF PRAISE
## BIG CARDINAL ASSET Brown, Braden and Reynolds Express Thanks to All-Blacks 
### 
Football Coach Floyd Brown is en
thusiastic over the work of the sec
ond varsity during the present sea
son. He believes that much 'of the
condition and ability of the varsity
can be accredited to this team. Four
nights a week, the wearers of the
black sweaters meet the grays in a
scrimmage, and it is at this time that
the varsity is given its beet training
and real competition.
Little praise falls to the lot of the
All Blacks, us the second varsity is
popularly called. Their games are
generally played in semi-darkness, be
fore empty bleachers, the students
showing no enthusiasm for the Stan
ford second string players. Accord
ing to "Doc" Reynolds, the real
knocks of the training season are re
ceived by the members of this team.
They bear the brunt of the varsity
attacks, and more second varsity men
are forced to visit the trainers than
any other players.
Speaking at the rally held at the
Phi Kappa Psi house, both Coach
Brown and Captain Braden expressed
their appreciation of the work of the
second varsity, and told the rooters
what the All Blacks meant to the
varsity. Without this fifteen, it would
he practically useless to try to de
velop a team capable of holding the
fast Santa Clara aggregation.
When the honors are passed out
after the Big Came, many should be
sprinkled among the following play
ers, who have so helped to make the
Stanford varsity what it is: Flood,
Curtis, Bowes, Pehl, Summerfield,
Fisher, Hayes, Oberg, Hough, Prior,
Hobbs, Wright, Katten, Henry, Bacon,
Ames, .Teffers, Needham, Dievendorff,
Morris, West and McCormack.
