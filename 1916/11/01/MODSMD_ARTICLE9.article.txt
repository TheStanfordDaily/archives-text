# BIG INCREASE IN MILITARY BOND
## Trustees Authorize Total of $25,000 to Cover Suits and Rifles 
### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur has
been authorized by the Board of Trus
tees to sign an additional bond for
$ir>.ooo with the United States govern
ment for the care and safeguarding
of ordnance stores to be used by the
Department of Military Training in
the University. This makes a total of
$25,000 in bonds that the University
will have signed for this purpose,
$10,000 having been already bonded
for guns and other equipment that
will soon reach the University.
Additional rifles, shelter tents, con
ical tents, blanket rolls, and other
necessary field equipment, will he
covered by the additional bond. This
bond will also make it possible for
Ihe corps to have a machine sun when
it becomes prepared to tain up work
in that branch of military tactics.
The regulations provide that the men
have to be efficient in infantry tactics
before they can take up cavalry
training, artillery or machine guns.
This would make it likely that no
work would be begun on machine
suns until next, year, although there
is a possibility that if the men show
rapid progress they might, be ready
for this work at the end of the pres
ent year.
