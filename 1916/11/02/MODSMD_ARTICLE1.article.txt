# VARSITY GOES BETTER AFTER DEFEAT SCARE
## TEAM WORK IMPROVES Athletic Club Game Shows Few Weaknesses That are Being Corrected 
### 
Saturday's varsity contest with the
Palo Alto Athletic Club appears now
to have been productive of good re
sults. Varsity practice this week has
been very snappy and the showing of
the varsity lias been much more prom
ising than heretofore. Perhaps that
scare of the first half caused the
boys to realize what they were going
to buck against when they meet the
Santa Clara fifteen on Ewing Field.
Fight for Places.
Coach Brown has come nearer to
wearing a smile this week than he
has for some time during evening
workouts. Kester, Single and Sample
have been working out at front rank,
with "Here" Bihlman and Scott re
lieving them, and the combination
seems to be getting more efficient.
Pettingill, Coleman and Murray are
still at middle rank, arid the contest
between the last two men waxes
warmer as the time goes by. Mur
ray's height, coupled with his ability
to get off the ground in the lineouts
is a big aid to him, while Dick Cole
man's speed is noticeable. Captain
Joe Braden has been able to take
part in the evening scrimmages this
week.
Lnclimiind Still Out.
in the backfield, Marriott has
seemed to go much better this week
than heretofore, while on the other
wing Swigart too has shown much
improvement. Pelouze has been play
ing at three-quarters, while Lach
mund is on the shelf, but will un
doubtedly move back to the wing po
sition when "Pretty" gets back in the
game.
Bucking up against the second var-
Stity every night, the varsity have
shown a great deal of speed and have
scored with much more ease than for
merly, despite the hard efforts of the
second string men.
Coach Brown will take the training
table squad up to San Francisco on
the 12:45 train, tomorrow, to give
them an opportunity to get used to
the difference between Ewing Field
and the varsity turf. They will eat
dinner in the city and will return in
the evening to be the guests of the
management at "The Show Shop."
The Olympic Club of San Francisco
will provide the competition on Sat
urday for the first team men, the last
appearance that the varsity will make
prior to the game with Santa Clara.
The lineup chosen for this contest
will probably serve to the fans as
some sort of a criterion of the final
lineup.
Captain Hale of the Olympics will
present his usual strong lineup, the
team taking the field as follows:
Milliken, Peek, No on an, Flannagan,
Edmunds,'Crlasson, (luerin, Slater, for
wards: Wilson, wing forward: Lar
kin, TTanley, Erb, Hale, Urban, Steph
ens, Davis, Montgomery, backfield.
Charlie Austin took his Mission
Town players up to San Francisco
vesterdav, and reported that although
the field was not as yet in the best
of condition, he thought that it would
be in excellent shape for the big strug
gle.

the evening to be the guests of the
management at "The Show Shop."
The Olympic Club of San Francisco
will provide the competition on Sat
urday for the first team men, the last
appearance that the varsity will make
prior to the game with Santa Clara.
The lineup chosen for this contest
will probably serve to the fans as
some sort of a criterion of the final
lineup.
Captain Hale of the Olympics will
present his usual strong lineup, the
team taking the field as follows:
Milliken, Peek, No on an, Flannagan,
Edmunds,'Crlasson, (luerin, Slater, for
wards: Wilson, wing forward: Lar
kin, TTanley, Erb, Hale, Urban, Steph
ens, Davis, Montgomery, backfield.
Charlie Austin took his Mission
Town players up to San Francisco
vesterdav, and reported that although
the field was not as yet in the best
of condition, he thought that it would
be in excellent shape for the big strug
gle.
Saturday's varsity contest with the
Palo Alto Athletic Club appears now
to have been productive of good re
sults. Varsity practice this week has
been very snappy and the showing of
the varsity lias been much more prom
ising than heretofore. Perhaps that
scare of the first half caused the
boys to realize what they were going
to buck against when they meet the
Santa Clara fifteen on Ewing Field.
Fight for Places.
Coach Brown has come nearer to
wearing a smile this week than he
has for some time during evening
workouts. Kester, Single and Sample
have been working out at front rank,
with "Here" Bihlman and Scott re
lieving them, and the combination
seems to be getting more efficient.
Pettingill, Coleman and Murray are
still at middle rank, arid the contest
between the last two men waxes
warmer as the time goes by. Mur
ray's height, coupled with his ability
to get off the ground in the lineouts
is a big aid to him, while Dick Cole
man's speed is noticeable. Captain
Joe Braden has been able to take
part in the evening scrimmages this
week.
Lnclimiind Still Out.
in the backfield, Marriott has
seemed to go much better this week
than heretofore, while on the other
wing Swigart too has shown much
improvement. Pelouze has been play
ing at three-quarters, while Lach
mund is on the shelf, but will un
doubtedly move back to the wing po
sition when "Pretty" gets back in the
game.
Bucking up against the second var-
Stity every night, the varsity have
shown a great deal of speed and have
scored with much more ease than for
merly, despite the hard efforts of the
second string men.
Coach Brown will take the training
table squad up to San Francisco on
the 12:45 train, tomorrow, to give
them an opportunity to get used to
the difference between Ewing Field
and the varsity turf. They will eat
dinner in the city and will return in
the evening to be the guests of the
management at "The Show Shop."
