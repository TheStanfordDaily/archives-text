# VIVID RELIEF STORY TOLD AT ASSEMBLY
## TRIBUTE TO STANFORD Whirlwind Campaign Will Start Tonight for Pellissier Memorial Fund 
### 
Campus Campaign Begins Tonight.
Representatives in each fratern
ity and sorority will collect funds
for the Pellissier Memorial Ambu
lance tonight. Meetings will be
held at Encina and Roble for the
same purpose. The campaign will
be of a whirlwind nature, being well
under way among alumni, and
friends of the University.

War relief work and raising of the
Pellissier Memorial Fund were
brought home to Stanford folks viv
idly this morning by Miss Ethel Mary
Crocker of San Francisco, and Dr.
Shadworth O. Reasley, of the Stan
ford Medical school, both of whom re
turned recently from Europe, where
they were actively engaged in human
itarian work. Miss Crocker was in
Red Cross work in France, while Dr.
Reasley spent six months in stricken
Servia.
Reasley Tells of Servia.
Dr. Reasley dealt entirely with
conditions in Servia. "The Americans
have complete control of the Red
Cross work there," he said. "The
biggest work is caring for the typhus
epidemic. One hundred thousand peo
ple have died of the dread disease."
He told how the majority of the work
was medical rather than surgical.
More danger is encountered from dis-
ease in time of war than from powder
and sliot.
Trihutc to Stanford.
Miss Crocker paid a slowing tribute
to Stanford, for its activity in the in
terests of humanity. Miss Crocker
spent four months in France, and Her
brother, William IT. Crocker, Jr.. is
still there in the American Ambulance
Corps, being in the field service.
Aside from her brother's letters,
Miss Crocker described the great
warehouse used as the receiving hos
pital in Paris, where the wounded
are brought from the front. "When
the train stopped, the Americans, who
were standing in formation, immedi
ately were chosen to do this most
difficult job on account of their pa
tience and tenderness.
"I can't exaggerate the unpleasant
ness that our boys fiave to contend
with. They are obliged to go into
trains, where the sick and wounded
have been shut up for days. All that
I can say is that it* takes all their
American pluck."
Field Work Different.
Field ambulance work, according to
Miss Crocker, is different. Miss
Crocker's brother is in this service,
working in the vicinity of Verdun.
"Our post is about five hundred yards
from the Germans, but the French
have such complete control of the sit
uation, that the Germans rarely fire.
Tf they do send a shell the French
answer it with five, if they send ten,
the French send fifty.
"At the post we sleep with the sol
diers in the cellar of an old farm
house. Tt is fixed up as a bomb
shelter with supporting logs, sacks
of sand, and braces. At night the
soldiers close the doors tight and
there we sleep, hermetically sealed
until morning, when we stagger out,
half suffocated. Our food is a sol
dier's rations, mashed potatoes, a
picee of meat, and a cup of wine.
We have to walk half a mile and bring
it back in a dinner pail."

Red Cross work in France, while Dr.
Reasley spent six months in stricken
Servia.
Reasley Tells of Servia.
Dr. Reasley dealt entirely with
conditions in Servia. "The Americans
have complete control of the Red
Cross work there," he said. "The
biggest work is caring for the typhus
epidemic. One hundred thousand peo
ple have died of the dread disease."
He told how the majority of the work
was medical rather than surgical.
More danger is encountered from dis-
ease in time of war than from powder
and sliot.
Trihutc to Stanford.
Miss Crocker paid a slowing tribute
to Stanford, for its activity in the in
terests of humanity. Miss Crocker
spent four months in France, and Her
brother, William IT. Crocker, Jr.. is
still there in the American Ambulance
Corps, being in the field service.
Aside from her brother's letters,
Miss Crocker described the great
warehouse used as the receiving hos
pital in Paris, where the wounded
are brought from the front. "When
the train stopped, the Americans, who
were standing in formation, immedi
ately were chosen to do this most
difficult job on account of their pa
tience and tenderness.
"I can't exaggerate the unpleasant
ness that our boys fiave to contend
with. They are obliged to go into
trains, where the sick and wounded
have been shut up for days. All that
I can say is that it* takes all their
American pluck."
Field Work Different.
Field ambulance work, according to
Miss Crocker, is different. Miss
Crocker's brother is in this service,
working in the vicinity of Verdun.
"Our post is about five hundred yards
from the Germans, but the French
have such complete control of the sit
uation, that the Germans rarely fire.
Tf they do send a shell the French
answer it with five, if they send ten,
the French send fifty.
"At the post we sleep with the sol
diers in the cellar of an old farm
house. Tt is fixed up as a bomb
shelter with supporting logs, sacks
of sand, and braces. At night the
soldiers close the doors tight and
there we sleep, hermetically sealed
until morning, when we stagger out,
half suffocated. Our food is a sol
dier's rations, mashed potatoes, a
picee of meat, and a cup of wine.
We have to walk half a mile and bring
it back in a dinner pail."
Campus Campaign Begins Tonight.
Representatives in each fratern
ity and sorority will collect funds
for the Pellissier Memorial Ambu
lance tonight. Meetings will be
held at Encina and Roble for the
same purpose. The campaign will
be of a whirlwind nature, being well
under way among alumni, and
friends of the University.

War relief work and raising of the
Pellissier Memorial Fund were
brought home to Stanford folks viv
idly this morning by Miss Ethel Mary
Crocker of San Francisco, and Dr.
Shadworth O. Reasley, of the Stan
ford Medical school, both of whom re
turned recently from Europe, where
they were actively engaged in human
itarian work. Miss Crocker was in
Red Cross work in France, while Dr.
Reasley spent six months in stricken
