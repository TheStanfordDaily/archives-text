San Jose high school fought gamely
against the Stanford freshmen yes
terday afternoon, but were over
whelmed, a 23 to 0 score being chalked
up against them. The freshmen
showed more knowledge of rugby
than they have displayed during a
majority of the games this season,
and clearly demonstrated that the in
dividual attention of one coach greatly
helps the general work of the team.
Play.
"Dutch" Henry sent a lineup with
a number of new faces on the field.
The players, who were unfamiliar to
the Stanford bleachers, showed to
good advantage. Gibbs, Seeley, Swift,
Humphreys, Phair and Cattern ad
vancing the hall like veterans. Mc-
Cartney of the forwards, and .Toerg
of the backfield, were tlie individual
stars of the freshmen fifteen.
For the first ten minutes, the irame
looked to lie an even struggle, hut
the 1020 aggregation soon swept down
tlie field, and a dribbling rush with
McCartney and Miliington on the hall,
it then being passed from Snook to
.Toerg, resulting in the first score.
Cass converted.
The next try came as a result of a
long run by Toole, tlie ball traveling
out to the wing and back to Toole,
who went over. Cass again sent the
ball between tlie posts. The half
ended with the score 10 to 0.
In tlie "second period, Henry tried
out many substitutes, the fifteen
clearing showing that the contest was
well in hand. Three trys were made
during this half, Cass hooting the
extra two points twice. McCartney
scored one of the trys, getting across
after a short sprint. Barneson made
the feature run of the day, accepting
a pass from Tilton on the Stanford
forty-yard line, and tearing sixty
yards to a score. After the final gun.
.Toerg squirmed over for the last try
of the day.
Lynch's excellent kiefking to touch,
and the heavy work of the forwards
featured the play of the San .lose
fifteen. The lineups follow:
Freshmen —Auhert, (Phair), Barn
eson. Wayland, (Henry), front rank;
Millington, (Bowden), and Swift,
(Martin"), middle rank; McCartney,
Tilton and Snook, (Humphreys), rear
