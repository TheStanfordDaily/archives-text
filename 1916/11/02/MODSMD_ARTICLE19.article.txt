# Wary Missionites Capture Visiting Stanford Jnuior
## 
### 
In spite of the fact that paint is
"up" Cardinal pigment went "down"
011 sacred precincts in Santa Clara,
Tuesday evening, and as a result L.
J. Olinder, '18, suffered the scare of
his life last night, while on his way
to a dance in the city of Santa Clara.
Olinder had not painted huge red
S's on the Missionite fences. He was
not aware of the ract that anyone
had accomplished such a feat. And
so as he stepped from a street car
in the heart of the enemy's territory,
he did not notice that his Stanford
fob swung boldly before the eyes of
the red and white fans.
Olinder was seized, carried to a
temporary "lock-up" and told to pre
pare himself for the terrible ordeal
of which he had read. It required
yards of explanation, and the evidence
of a friend, to prove to Santa Claran
satisfaction that the Stanford junior
was there 011 a peaceful errand. Ol
inder was released with a warning.
