This can only be appreciated (if fit
all) by Stanford folks. The scene
takes lis to tlie Phi Fee Fie booth in
the library. It is 9:45 p.m. She is
ostensibly studying political economy,
but in reality is hoping that someone
will come to buy her a sody at the
democratic campus candy shop, lie
is standing in the siisle, studying per
sonal economy, for he owns but 20
cents, hardly enough for a satisfying
trip to Wilson's.
She looks up, nods, smiles and mur
murs—Hello Ben!
He—Hello, Bettina. tyhatcha (loin'?
She—Studying. Sit clown.
He —Studying hard?
She—Not awfully.
He (to himself) —Guess T can keep
her mind off drinks. (Sits)— Didn't
know you were a student of polities!
She —(if hp only would ask me to
walk home!)— Why, a woman has to
know politics now and then. How are
you voting, Ben?
("The lights flash a warning of clos
ing time. - )
He —(to himself) —Don't suppose
she's thirsty.
She —Are you for Hughes?
He—(thinking that they can walk
home so as to evade the candy store")
—No, T'm for Wilson, even though T
don't like his policies.
She —(becoming more thirsty at each
word) —Nor T. Ben. His chocolates
are much better.
He—(believing Bettina is using a
technical term) —Then you're not for
Wilson's
She —(interruptine:)—NOT for Wil
son's? Yes, sir; T'm for him every
time. Thanks! T was dying for a
drink.
He—(feebly)—Then why didn't you
sav so, right out? Let's go!
