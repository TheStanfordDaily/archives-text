# Must Take Sorority Quad Pictures This Semester Says Editor
## 
### 
Sorority pictures for the 1918 Quad
must be taken this semester, and as
soon as possible, according to Editor
B. C. Wohlford, '18. Individual pic
tures, similar to those in last year's
annual, will be used in the house
groups. All members of the same
sorority must have their pictures
taken by the same photographer, pre
ferably by one in Palo Alto, and must
be of uniform size.
A white background will be used
this year. According to Editor Wohl
ford, pictures should be taken prefer
ably in white dresses, with no touch
of color. Good, clean photographs,
with no deep shadows and as few pro
files as possible, will be most conduc
ive to superior half-tone reproduction.
