# Buy Hot-Dogs of Women Tuesday
## 
### 
Did you ever think that you might
be hungry during tlie long hours of
anxious waiting for election returns —
that you might like something to
chew on if your candidates were
losing? Well, Cap and Gown thought
of that, too, —and Cap and Gown--
being women—thought of a remedy.
It's this way:
Hot-dogs, peanuts, candy and gum
Are to he sold; you'd better cum.
Anyway, the money is going to help
pay expenses and swell the Pellissier
Memorial Fund, and when you pay
the five pennies you would have spent
on peanuts at the football game, you
will have the consolation of knowing
that you've killed two birds with one
stone.
