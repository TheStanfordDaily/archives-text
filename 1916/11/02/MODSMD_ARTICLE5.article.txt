# Prizes and Eats at Jolly-Up Saturday
## 
### 
'Way back in history there was a
! freshmen and a sophomore jolly-up,—
I and now—leaving the hest till last —
I conies the annual upperclass get-to
j gether. There are going to he four
j hours of solid fun at Encina, Satur
day night! Four hours of dancing,
stunts, prizes and eats—all better
than ever, as the committee in charge
has profited by four years of experi
! ence.
There's only one prerequisite (other
than fifty cents) for admittance to
Encina, Saturday, and that is "rough
neck" dress —men in coats and girls
in silks will be very much out of or
drr —say those in charge of the affair,
while soft shirts and middies will be
ultra-fashionable.
