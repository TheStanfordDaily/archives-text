# THEY'RE OFF FOR OLD BROADWAY TONIGHT
## IN "THE SHOW SHOP" Sophomore Comedy Will Tell in Clever Manner Story of Stage Romance 
### 
It's "All Aboard for Broadway!"
A thousand passengers have already
climbed on, the sophomore special is
puffing impatiently! In an hour or
two the revelations of James Forbes*
"Show Shop" will have carried the
thousand, train and all, to the land
of the midnight son and the past-mid
night frolic.
This can be said because the com
cdy chosen by the 1919 class for pre
sentation tonight is distinctly of the
stage and of stage people. Two of
its acts take place behind the cur
tains, and the other pair are located
in quarters inhabited by men and
women of the footlights.
Betty Dean, the heroine, is a show
girl, with a bit of talent and a mother
ambitious to engrave her daughter's
name in the bright-lights. Teresa
Hilin plays the role of Bettina. In
love with Betty is Jerome Belden, a
hang-about-the-club sort of a man.
He has never acted. In fact, he has
never even recitcd Kipling before a
high school audience. When he gels
on the stage so he can be with Betty,
and later marry her, he pulls* what the
unparlor-bred term a "boot."
