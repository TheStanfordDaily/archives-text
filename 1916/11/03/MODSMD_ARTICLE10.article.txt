# Reynolds Assures Condition for Team
## 
### 
Trainer "Doc" Reynolds yesterday
expelled the fears of the anxious
Cardinal rugby supporters who have
been worrying over the condition of
players on the varsity training table.
More men have been on the hospital
list this season than in previous years,
but in the final stretcli the team is
quickly rounding into form, and on
the day of the Big Game will run on
the field in perfect shape.
According to Trainer Reynolds, the
list of injured is decreasing daily.
Sample, Rraden, Winham, Lachmund,
Walker, Pelouze, and Wilkins have all
been held back by unfortunate mis
haps during different parts of the
season, but all of these men will be
able to show at their best on Novem
ber 11th.
Sample is fully recovered, as is
Pelouze, while Rraden, Walker, Lach
mund and Wilkins are fast working
into Rig Game shape. Winham, who
has been kept out with a bad shouder.
is expected to be in playing condition
by the middle of next week.
Pettingill received a wrenched ankle
last night while engaged in dribbling
practice. The injury will keep the
big forward out of the game tomor
row, but he will be fully recovered
by the following Saturday.
Santa Clara has been extremely
fortunate in injuries, Wassum and
Howell being the only varsity men
badly hurt this season. Roth have
come around to good condition. Peo
ple who have watched both Stanford
and Santa Clara plav throughout the
season, feel that the Cardinal will
reach the height of condition next
week, the ideal time, while Santa
Tiara is perhaps getting stale, the
fifteen not looking as strong as it did
two weeks ago.
