# CHAPPIE COMING A LA BIG GAME
## 
### 
Football at Stanford is the raison
d'etre of the November Chaparral
which will start campus tongues
wagging on the Quad, Monday morn
ing. Monk Antrim's three-color
cover covers the situation from a
national standpoint, and its caption,
"The Little Man's Here to Stayâ€”
Watch Him Grow," is carried out
with more or less consistency
throughout the number.
"Sport for Sport's Sake," the
frontispiece, by G. W. Hall, '!!), is a

striking silhouette of striking sig
nificance. Hall contributes a num
ber of smaller silhouettes that show
considerable artistic individuality. Art
j Editor J. W. Wallace, '17, offers vivid
explanations of rugby nomenclature
in a double-page cartoon, "The Tech
nicalities of the Game." Dave Smith,
'19, contributes a full-page drawing
of distinctly metropolitan style.
Features of the issue are a "Cold
Gray Elegy on the Demise of Inter-
collegiate Athletics," by W. TT. Water
man, '18, and "Two and Two Are
Four, Proved by Statistics," by M. C.
Hall. '18. Lovers of the risque will
be highly interested in Chappie's an
nouncement of a mysterious prize
contest.
Chappie advises Stanford students
that they should all feel greatly re
lieved over the fact that the athletic
policy of the University has been de-
cided for them, in his '"Now That"
page.
He also suggests in connection with
the new "honor" system that "a com
mittee search the students before,
and put them through a third degree
after examinations."
