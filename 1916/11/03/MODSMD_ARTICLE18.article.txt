Stanford's impassive cocksuredness
seems to have experienced a complete
flip-flop, along with campus sportdom
turning agog over the coming foot
ball classic. That old adage of a
stitch in time saving nine may be
truthful, but from all indications
Cardinal fans underwent some mighty
necessary eleventh-hour mending, if
hopes were held of staving loff a
Santa Clara bombasting. Despite re
cent exhibitions of enthusiasm and
unanimity, there are some remaining
rough corners that require attention.

Latest bulletins from the rugby cal
endar show but two more contests
previous to the titular match with
the Mission aggregation. If these
were the lone opportunities for local
rooters to acquire a passable reper
toire of Stanford songs and yells, one
should feel a bit dubious of their in
tended bow before the public gaze at
Ewing Field. Which reminds one
that while enjoying the caffeine aroma
arising from the small-blacks at the
dinner table, Cardinal supporters
should henceforth take advantage of
the brief spasm between now and the
Big Game in learning the latest in
bleacher noise and music.

Yesterday evening the freshmen
proved poor night owls, when only a
quintet out of forty-five displayed
sufficient backbone to answer the
early morning bonfire shift. As a re
sult Santa Clara raiders started a
conflagration that was extinguished
only through tlie grace of Providence.
Timely intervention by sophomores
who might employ Hindenburg meth
ods, seems appropriate.

Rut with all the minor discrepan
cies, the Big Game fever is rapidly
changing into a campus epidemic—
truly a welcome malady. When the
varsity engages the Olympics in its
final scramble tomorrow afternoon,
a handsome crowd should decorate the
bleachers. Dope-sheet compilers have
opened hostilities, so if you haven't
figured out possible scores, and suf
fered resulting insomnia, you are sev
eral leagues to the rear of the parade.
