# FRESHMEN GUARD DETECTS PLOT TO BURN BONFIRE
## 
### 
Freshmen sleuths last night detected
a plot to burn the semblance of a
bonfire under construction. A motor
cycle, presumably the property of a
Santa Clara arsonist, was found in
the brush by Encina gymnasium. \
little later two skulking forms were
seen, but t.licy eluded their pursuers.
While these were being chased, a fire
broke out in the pile of wood.
The blaze was soon put out with no
damage. The experience will only
tend to increase the pyre-builders'
vigilance.
