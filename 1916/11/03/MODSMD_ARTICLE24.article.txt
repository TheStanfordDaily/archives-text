# Give Books for Belgian Fair in San Francisco
## 
### 
Books for the Belgians is the new
est request made of Stanford stu
dents, â€”not old books that are no
longer wanted, but attractive, second
hand books that will sell.
There is to be a great Fair in San
Francisco for the Belgian cause, and
attractive books will bring good
prices.
Students wishing to contribute such
books will send them by the Bth of
November, if possible, to Mrs. Parker
S. Maddox, 1146 Bryant street, Palo
Alto. From here all will be shipped
together to the city.
