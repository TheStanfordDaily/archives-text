# Rooters' Excursion to Big Game Planned
## Cardinal Supporters to Charter Auto Busses for Entire Day in City 
### 
Accompanied by yell loaders and
megaphones, a large crowd of Card
inal rooters in chartered auto-busses
will make up one of the main excur
sions to the r.ig Game on November
the 11th. This plan, whereby Stan
ford may make a live showing in the
city, and on the road, has been ap
proved by Graduate Manager Reh
rens, who will furnish one of the big
banners, and send along one of the
regular yell leaders.
The excursion may be led by a
brass band, if enough rooters signify
their intention of going. The busses
will be chartered for all day and
most of the night, and will be avail
able for taking the excursionist root
ers all over the city, without addi
tional expense. The tickets will cost
$1.25, going on sale at Andrus' Cam
pus Taxi stand Monday night.
