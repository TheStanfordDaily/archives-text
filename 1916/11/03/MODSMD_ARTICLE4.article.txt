# High Cost Wallops Stanford Queeners Blows Below Bells
## 
### 
The high cost of "queening" is
getting something fierce.
After being belted again and
again in the vicinity of the
pocketbook by the rising cost of
entertaining the "eternal femin
ine," campus swains must suffer
the cruelest blow of all.
Movies have gone up one jit
per seat.
Beginning Monday, both the
Varsity and Marquee theaters will
charge fifteen cents for paste
boards entitling holders to ac
commodations.
But it's worth it, anyway.
'"Everything lias gone up," say
the managers, "films, carbons,
posters, and even tickets."
