# Santa Clara Meets Barbs
## 
### 
Santa Clara plays the last
same of the preliminary foot ban
season Sunday afternoon, meeting
the Barbarian Club of San Fran
cisco on the Mission Town turf.
The game will be called at 2:!J0,
by Referee Peter Flanagan.
The Barbarians are a much
weaker aggregation than the other
clubs that Santa Clara has been
playing, but should furnish fairly*
good competition.
