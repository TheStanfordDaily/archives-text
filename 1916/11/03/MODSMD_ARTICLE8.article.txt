# BALLOT CHANGES EXPLAINED TO VOTERS
## HEAR FACULTY MEN Doubt on Questions Dispelled as Real issues Involved are Outlined 
### 
Clear, concise explanations of seven
slate amendments to be presented to
voters at the coming election by mem
bers of the faculty last night, at the
Union, did much towards dispelling
the doubt among those present as to
the real issues involved in these ques
tions. Nearly one hundred and fifty
voters, among them many women,
heard the program of short talks.
Wet or Dry.
The prohibition amendments, 1 and
2, needed little explanation. Profes
sor R. L. Green, who talked on these
propositions, pointed out that No. 1
meant absolute destruction of the
liquor traffic, prohibiting its manufac
ture, sale or possession after January
1, 1920, except for certain specified
purposes. Amendment No. 2, on the
other hand, he said, is ot' a less dras
tic character, directed solely at the
retail liquor traffic, and in no way
limiting its manufacture or use in pri
vate homes.
Highway Acts.
Professor C. B. Wing, in regard to
the two state highway acts, numbers
3 and 7, declared: "There is really
no argument against either one of
these propositions." Number pro
vides for the issuance of $15,000,000,
in bonds, for the construction of un
completed portions of the state high-
way, as prescribed in the State High
way Act of 1909.
Number 7, an amendment of the
State Highway Act, provides that
counties shall not be assessed propor
tionately to the expenditure on their
roads, in case the state engineering
department decides that an unjust
burden would thereby be imposed.
Direct Primary Amendments.
The direct primary law was ex
plained by Professor Y. J. West, who
termed it"the longest and least im
portant of them all." This is an
amendment of the present primary
law which requires voters to declare
their party affiliation thirty days be
fore election. Under the proposed
law, a profession of party affiliation
is not necessary until the day of elec
tion.
A 114*111 Hie Single Tax.
The single tax question, one of the
most, far-reaching on the ballot, was
presented by Assistant. Professor P.
B. Garver. This law, designed to
overthrow the present system of tax
ation, provides that all public revenue
shall he raised by taxation of land
values, exclusive of improvements, the
land is to be assessed according to
its value for use or occupancy. "If
you believe in private ownership of
land," said the speaker, "vote against
this amendment, for it will virtually
make the state your landlord."
The remaining proposition, the in
eligibility to office act, was taken up
by Professor A. S. Johnson. This is
a law which declares that no legisla
tor shall lie appointed to any position
of public trust during his term of of
fice. "The aim of this amendment,"
said Professor Johnson, "is to prevent
the governor from creating a political
machine by the dealing out of public
offices."

A 114*111 Hie Single Tax.
The single tax question, one of the
most, far-reaching on the ballot, was
presented by Assistant. Professor P.
B. Garver. This law, designed to
overthrow the present system of tax
ation, provides that all public revenue
shall he raised by taxation of land
values, exclusive of improvements, the
land is to be assessed according to
its value for use or occupancy. "If
you believe in private ownership of
land," said the speaker, "vote against
this amendment, for it will virtually
make the state your landlord."
The remaining proposition, the in
eligibility to office act, was taken up
by Professor A. S. Johnson. This is
a law which declares that no legisla
tor shall lie appointed to any position
of public trust during his term of of
fice. "The aim of this amendment,"
said Professor Johnson, "is to prevent
the governor from creating a political
machine by the dealing out of public
offices."
Clear, concise explanations of seven
slate amendments to be presented to
voters at the coming election by mem
bers of the faculty last night, at the
Union, did much towards dispelling
the doubt among those present as to
the real issues involved in these ques
tions. Nearly one hundred and fifty
voters, among them many women,
heard the program of short talks.
Wet or Dry.
The prohibition amendments, 1 and
2, needed little explanation. Profes
sor R. L. Green, who talked on these
propositions, pointed out that No. 1
meant absolute destruction of the
liquor traffic, prohibiting its manufac
ture, sale or possession after January
1, 1920, except for certain specified
purposes. Amendment No. 2, on the
other hand, he said, is ot' a less dras
tic character, directed solely at the
retail liquor traffic, and in no way
limiting its manufacture or use in pri
vate homes.
Highway Acts.
Professor C. B. Wing, in regard to
the two state highway acts, numbers
3 and 7, declared: "There is really
no argument against either one of
these propositions." Number pro
vides for the issuance of $15,000,000,
in bonds, for the construction of un
completed portions of the state high-
way, as prescribed in the State High
way Act of 1909.
Number 7, an amendment of the
State Highway Act, provides that
counties shall not be assessed propor
tionately to the expenditure on their
roads, in case the state engineering
department decides that an unjust
burden would thereby be imposed.
Direct Primary Amendments.
The direct primary law was ex
plained by Professor Y. J. West, who
termed it"the longest and least im
portant of them all." This is an
amendment of the present primary
law which requires voters to declare
their party affiliation thirty days be
fore election. Under the proposed
law, a profession of party affiliation
is not necessary until the day of elec
tion.
