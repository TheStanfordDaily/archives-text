# SHOW SHOP WINS IN SPITE OF HANDICAP
## THIRD ACT SAVES PLAY Forbes' Comedy Puts Sophomores to Test in Presentation of Difficult Scenes 
### H.S. Marshutz, '17 
Twenty sophomores fought victor
iously against uphill odds in"The
Show Shop," Friday evening. . Scep
ticism against sophouioric plays, an
intricate comedy that depended for its
success upon one of four acts, and
upon the manipulating of old tricks
in a revised manner, were the ob
stacles overcome.
The underclass actors, for the most
part, hold the ruling hand. "Laugh!"
said the play. And the audience
laughed. "Feel deep emotion!" The
people felt. "Applaud after these
lines," said the author. The audi
ence did applaud. Which speaks very
well for Friday evening, because the
1919 actors succeeded in getting
James Forbes' concoction into the
eraniums of tired business men, col
lege men, their wives and companions.
Actors Deserve Glory.
Aside from its third act broadside,
"The Show Shop," as a dramatic ve
hicle runs on a flat wheel. Hut be
cause every man and every woman
rolled up their sleeves for that act,
and made it something to remember,
the Sophomore play for 1916, the cast
and Frank Mathieu, deserve whatever
glory goes with newspaper commend
ation.
Teresa Hihn may have been a dis
appointment to a few, but by far the
greater number, those who under
stood her role, had nothing but high
praise for the manner in which she
was herself in a part that demanded
that she should be so.
Two New Lights.
Muriel Burdick and Murel Manna
gave some truly good acting, the for
mer especially in the eventful third
act. The latter throughout the per
formance displayed pleasing natural
ness. Miss Burdick was undoubtedly
an asset to "The Show Shop."
D. M. Smith's Max Rosenbaam was
brilliant at times, and good always.
His work was voted that of the born
actor. Again and again well time i
and well made gestures and perfect
facial adjustment struck the auii
ence in the right place. Johnny
Brinkly in the drama is an old-time
actor. So W. W. Lloyd played the
part, Friday. If Lloyd feit the pres
ence of the audience, he never b3-
;ayed himself. He nearly stands
above the usual run of co'loge actori,
possessing everything needed to con
vince.
Derby A l'uzzle.
Richard De -by was a puzzle in
spite of the fact that he admitted his
nervousness, Derby carried his bulg
ing lead without serious struggle. At
times he was masterful. Then again,
he forgot to be masterful. It appears
that he had it in his power to be at
his best all of the time instead of
merely during part of it.
Sadie, the stenographer, by Irene
Bonnett, after but a week of rehear
sal, was a faultless and genuinely
funny bit of character work. The
play would have been better with more
of Sadie.
R. R. Tourtillott was an excellent
stage manager, because he did not
exaggerate. There was a high-pow
ered punch behind his acting. M. L.
Levy stood of criticism with
his Granby Smith, and easily won him
self a place on the credit side of the
dramatic ledger.
As for the "finds" of the evening—
Sophomore plays usually bring out a
"find" or two —they were all found
satisfying, every son and daughter,
from leading lady to leading man.
L. J. Rehm, R. G. Whealton, H. H.
Heth, P. A. Betts, E. C. LaForge, G. J.
Knight, L. E. Graham, E. W. Bruns,
and the Misses Flora Duncan, Martha
Gravely and Dorothy Plummer—had
little to do but gave collectively one
of the most commendable features of
"The Show Shop"—well chosen play
ers for minor parts.

ation.
Teresa Hihn may have been a dis
appointment to a few, but by far the
greater number, those who under
stood her role, had nothing but high
praise for the manner in which she
was herself in a part that demanded
that she should be so.
Two New Lights.
Muriel Burdick and Murel Manna
gave some truly good acting, the for
mer especially in the eventful third
act. The latter throughout the per
formance displayed pleasing natural
ness. Miss Burdick was undoubtedly
an asset to "The Show Shop."
D. M. Smith's Max Rosenbaam was
brilliant at times, and good always.
His work was voted that of the born
actor. Again and again well time i
and well made gestures and perfect
facial adjustment struck the auii
ence in the right place. Johnny
Brinkly in the drama is an old-time
actor. So W. W. Lloyd played the
part, Friday. If Lloyd feit the pres
ence of the audience, he never b3-
;ayed himself. He nearly stands
above the usual run of co'loge actori,
possessing everything needed to con
vince.
Derby A l'uzzle.
Richard De -by was a puzzle in
spite of the fact that he admitted his
nervousness, Derby carried his bulg
ing lead without serious struggle. At
times he was masterful. Then again,
he forgot to be masterful. It appears
that he had it in his power to be at
his best all of the time instead of
merely during part of it.
Sadie, the stenographer, by Irene
Bonnett, after but a week of rehear
sal, was a faultless and genuinely
funny bit of character work. The
play would have been better with more
of Sadie.
R. R. Tourtillott was an excellent
stage manager, because he did not
exaggerate. There was a high-pow
ered punch behind his acting. M. L.
Levy stood of criticism with
his Granby Smith, and easily won him
self a place on the credit side of the
dramatic ledger.
As for the "finds" of the evening—
Sophomore plays usually bring out a
"find" or two —they were all found
satisfying, every son and daughter,
from leading lady to leading man.
L. J. Rehm, R. G. Whealton, H. H.
Heth, P. A. Betts, E. C. LaForge, G. J.
Knight, L. E. Graham, E. W. Bruns,
and the Misses Flora Duncan, Martha
Gravely and Dorothy Plummer—had
little to do but gave collectively one
of the most commendable features of
"The Show Shop"—well chosen play
ers for minor parts.
Twenty sophomores fought victor
iously against uphill odds in"The
Show Shop," Friday evening. . Scep
ticism against sophouioric plays, an
intricate comedy that depended for its
success upon one of four acts, and
upon the manipulating of old tricks
in a revised manner, were the ob
stacles overcome.
The underclass actors, for the most
part, hold the ruling hand. "Laugh!"
said the play. And the audience
laughed. "Feel deep emotion!" The
people felt. "Applaud after these
lines," said the author. The audi
ence did applaud. Which speaks very
well for Friday evening, because the
1919 actors succeeded in getting
James Forbes' concoction into the
eraniums of tired business men, col
lege men, their wives and companions.
Actors Deserve Glory.
Aside from its third act broadside,
"The Show Shop," as a dramatic ve
hicle runs on a flat wheel. Hut be
cause every man and every woman
rolled up their sleeves for that act,
and made it something to remember,
the Sophomore play for 1916, the cast
and Frank Mathieu, deserve whatever
glory goes with newspaper commend
ation.
