# SHOW SHOP WINS IN SPITE OF HANDICAP
## THIRD ACT SAVES PLAY Forbes' Comedy Puts Sophomores to Test in Presentation of Difficult Scenes 
### H.S. Marshutz, '17 
Twenty sophomores fought victor
iously against uphill odds in"The
Show Shop," Friday evening. . Scep
ticism against sophouioric plays, an
intricate comedy that depended for its
success upon one of four acts, and
upon the manipulating of old tricks
in a revised manner, were the ob
stacles overcome.
The underclass actors, for the most
part, hold the ruling hand. "Laugh!"
said the play. And the audience
laughed. "Feel deep emotion!" The
people felt. "Applaud after these
lines," said the author. The audi
ence did applaud. Which speaks very
well for Friday evening, because the
1919 actors succeeded in getting
James Forbes' concoction into the
eraniums of tired business men, col
lege men, their wives and companions.
Actors Deserve Glory.
Aside from its third act broadside,
"The Show Shop," as a dramatic ve
hicle runs on a flat wheel. Hut be
cause every man and every woman
rolled up their sleeves for that act,
and made it something to remember,
the Sophomore play for 1916, the cast
and Frank Mathieu, deserve whatever
