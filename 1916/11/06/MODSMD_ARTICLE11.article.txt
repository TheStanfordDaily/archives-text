That Stanford will" know the ap
proximate result of the national elec
tion by 10 o'clock tomorrow evening
is the prediction of those who are iii
charge of the arrangements for show
ing the returns in the Assembly Hall.
Through the agency of the San Fran
cisco Examiner and The Daily Palo
Alto, plans were perfected today for
giving the campus direct service from
the Hearst News Service headquarters
in the city. Beginning promptly at
8:30 o'clock a continuous service is
promised the campus public.
Local Results Eearly.
Among the first returns to be shown
will be the complete results on the
presidential, senatorial and prohibi
tion vote in the campus and I'alo Alto
precincts. From the closing of the
polls at G o'clock special efforts wil'
be made in counting the ballots on tne
big questions, the vote on matters of
lesser interest being left open for
later tallying.
Doors To Open Late.
Though it was originally planned
to show the returns beginning at 7:30
o'clock, the hour for opening the doors
was changed to 8.30, because of the
lecture scheduled for the earlier hour
in the Little Theater. The actual re
turns, however, will have come m
throughout the hour, ana a great sup
ply of results in eastern districts will
be on hand when the spectators arp
admitted.
Private telephone connections from
the Assembly Hall to San Francisco
were installed today. The Hearst Ser
vice will send two men to the campus
to handle the returns, one being as
signed to the phone and the other to
the typing of the results. A local mo
tion picture operator will handle the
machine.
Though but few waits are looked
for, special pains have been taken
to avoid any monotony during the eve
ning. Ram's Head and the Glee Club
are both planning stunts and songs
for the evening.
