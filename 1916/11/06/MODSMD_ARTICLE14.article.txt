# CANDIDATE HUGHES

Campus thought, once stifled, has
been running wild of late, students
becoming concerned over state and
national issues—topics surely beneath
university interest. Several hundred
men and women registered early in
October, itself a novelty. Like other
educational institutions, realization of
the right to mingle in affairs of ser
ious moment has become apparent. A
period of Renaissance dawned, with
resulting Hughes and Wilson clubs
being formed and political speakers
addressing the local precinct.

The Daily Palo Alto is perfectly
cognizant of the past custom of re
fusal to defile its columns with any
political comment —perhaps concern
over the government is something
which university students should
proudly disdain. At least this was
he opinion upheld by the county clerk
during the recent agitation to prevent
strangling of voting privileges. But
now The Daily Palo Alto, after en
tering into conflict over suffrage
rights and prohibition, throws tradi
tion a third time to the winds by
taking a stand on the morrow's elec
tion.

The support of the candidacy of
Mr. Hughes for the presidency is earn
estly and frankly urged. In the Re
publican nominee, one finds a man
whose public record is above reproach;
who squarely and without evasion or
well-oiled phraseology criticizes the
present administration; and who, with
equal bluntness, outlines his own pan
aceas for the glaring faults, should he
occupy the White House. Mr. Hughes,
previous to being governor of New
York, bared the insurance scandal by
a singular display of business and
legal acumen; while in the executive
chair of the state, he ousted the no
torious Barnes machine; and as as
sociate justice of the Supreme Court,,
he has demonstrated a keenly pro
gressive and highly intellectual ca
pacity.

On the other hand, President Wil
son has woefully blundered in re
spect to Mexico, exhibited shameful
timidity as regards foreign affairs,
and shown flagrant violation of Her
itable appointment.

Mr. Wilson proudly points to the
prosperity of the nation —a prosperity
only temporary, precarious and un
sound, due to the presence of the
European war. Normal Wilsonian
prosperity was well evidenced pre
vious to the outbreak of international
conflict, when unemployment, de
creased productivity anil languishing
business were common. Again, the
President flaunts the existent peace
of this country as another Democratic
argument—a peace that has made us
the scorn of Europe, and has turned
our pride into shame and humiliation.

We have witnessed a foreign policy
that blustered at. the outset, only to
vacillate into dishonorable fiascos of
the Lusitania and British usurpation
of mails. Mr. Wilson terms himself
a staunch advocate of preparedness—
after Mr. Roosevelt had forced his
hand. Preparedness under Josephus
Daniels and Pacificist Baker exacts
but scant enthusiasm.

A vote for Mr. Hughes is a vote
for national and industrial prepared
ness, a government for and by the
people, and a vote for the mainten
ance of American rights and national
honor.
