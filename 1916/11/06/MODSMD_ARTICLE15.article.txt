# Kicks to Touch
## 
### 
Swigart played a spectacular game
Saturday, his sw r erves proving very
effective against the fast Olympic
backfield. Taking all in all, "Swig"
played by far the best game that he
has this season. His work could
really bring hope into the hearts of
the rooters.
Danny Carroll executed the pret
tiest defensive play of the season
early in the contest, when lie saved a
certain score by forcing two Olympic
men to touch with the ball. He ac
tually got rid of four men in this
play, having disposed of two when
he forced the two with the ball out.
"Pretty" Lachmund's work in the
first half was another thing that
brought cheer to the fans, as Lach
mund displayed his old time ability
in getting through a closed field. He
fumbled the ball a good deal, how
ever, but practice this week will un
doubtedly remedy that.
"Bill" Winliam's return to the game
was marked by the same spirited work
he has displayed heretofore. Winham
is in the game from the opening
whistle to the last play.
"Bay" Murray seemed to be right
where he was needed when it was
necessary for some forward to take a
pass and fall over the line with it.
Murray played a strong game through
out the contest.
Both backfields' work was marred in
the second half by fumbling, but that
can be attributed to the drizzling rain
which began right at the start of this
period.
Captain Joe Braden gave a good
account of himself but appeared to be
somewhat worried by his game knee.
Very little to complain about could
have been found with "Shrimp" Wil
kins' work at half. He handled his
passes in excellent shape.
Graduate Manager Behrens requests

Big Game tickets through his office,

The tickets have arrived and will be

uate Manager's office.
