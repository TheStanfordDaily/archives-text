# Wagers on Election Outcome Will Make Fun for Onlookers
## 
### 
All hail to the memory of the pub
lic initiation, which died an unnatural
death a year ago! With state and na
tional elections on the program for
Tuesday and a rugby classic due in a
week, the campus public will soon be
able to enjoy the nearest thing to the
public initiationâ€”the public payment
of election bets.
Both E. E. Engles, '17, and F. G.
Galliand, '18, will be seen in full dress
togs on the Quad next Wednesday, if
Woodrow Wilson fails to be re-elect
ed. J. A. Quinby, '18, and L. S. Lyons,
'IS, are on the other side of the bar
gain, and are slated to appear in their
classrooms in ballroom style should
Hughes be the loser.
H. M. Jones, '17, at the conclusion
of a hot argument with W. B. Cur
tis, '16, has agreed that if Wilsoh
conies out at the short end lie will
push a wheelbarrow containing Cur
tis the length of fraternity row. Cur
tis will provide similar transportation
for Jones, if the Democratic cham
pion gets the decision.
