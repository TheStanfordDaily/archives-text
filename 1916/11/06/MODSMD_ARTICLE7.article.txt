# DANNY CARROLL DISABLED
## Ex—--Skipper Makes Last Defense in 29 to 0. Victory 
### 
A 2!) to 0 victory, over the speedy
Olympic Club fifteen, last Saturday,
on the local turf, in no way expelled
the feeling of depression that spread
broadcast over the campus when the
news leaked out that Danny Carroll
was in the Peninsula Hospital, and
would not be able to play in the Big
Game.
Carroll Was Starring-.
Carroll, captain of last year's win
ning varsity, is a football hero, and
every rooter felt that with him in the
lineup, chances were bright for vic
tory next Saturday. He was playing
the best game that he has put up this
season, lie was hurt when he fell
on his shoulder, following a heavy
tackle by the Olympic Club wing,
after ho had broken loose for a thirty
yard run, roc iving a pass from Win
ham.
Fans Stay Despite ltain.
Dismal rain fell during part of both
the varsity and second varsity con
tests. The bleachers remained well
filled regardless of this, however, be
cause followers of the team realized
that the showing of the men yester
day would in a large measure decide
the composition of the final fifteen.
On the whole, (he team played with
a dash that spoke well for Cardinal
chances in the Big Game, the second
'half dragging a little, but that is ac
counted for by the fact that nine new
men were in the lineup. The for
wards followed the ball closely, and
the baekfield featured with some ex
cellent passim rushes. Ternploton
did his kicking in his usual form, but
did not sain touch as he should.

Danny Carroll is out of (he game for
the rest of the season. There is not
the slightest chance that he will be
able to play in the Big Game against
the University of Santa Clara next
Saturday, according to Doctor T. M.
Williams ,who is attending (lie in
jured rugby star, and Trainer "Doc"
Reynolds.
injury i'ainful.
When he was tackled in the game
with the Olympic Club, last Saturday,
he was running at full speed, and
was thrown heavily on his right
shoulder. The clavicle was torn loose
from the scapular, making his
shoulder very painful and slow to re
cover. It was found, by tliose attend
ing Carrol], that it was almost im
possible to get him in any position
so that the severed ligaments would
knit rapidly. Also, the patient has to
lie (lat on his back to ease the pain
as much as possible.
Danny Carroll is a name that is
famous in rugby annals. He was an
international player before coming to
Stanford, playing on the Australian
Wallabies that toured the British Isles
in 1909 and stopped for a few games
on the Pacific Coast on the way home.
When the Waratahs came to Califor
nia in 1!)12, Carroll decided to remain
| at Stanford and try for a degree.
Was Hack field Pivot.
This is his fourth year on the Card
inal varsity,' and he would have won
the distinction of being a four-star
man next Saturday. He has been the
pivot around which 'tho baekfield
worked. On the defensive, no man on
the team was his equal, and on the of
The first try was made as a result
of fast playing on the part of Win
ham and Single. The former got
away for a long run and transferred
to the husky frontranker, who went
over. Templeton missed an easy con
version. The second try was made
by Kester, Lachmund and Hraden fig
uring in the rush that made it pos
sible for Kester to drive through the
clubmen. Templeton again failed to
convert, this time from a harder
angle.
"Dink" Templeton redeemed himself
a few minutes afterward, adding three
more points with a beautiful drop be
tween the bars from the twenty-five
yard penalty, booting from the ex
treme sidelines. The two remaining
trys of this half were made by Mur
ray and Swigart, both culminating
flashy plays. Templeton added the
four points. The score at halftime
was 19 to 0.
In Second Half.
In the second period, rain fell heav
ily, making good rugby impossible.
The ball was slippery, and the backs
could not handle it. Murray and
Wilkins scored trys during this half,
Templeton converting both. The
"Winged 0" squad had the Cardinal on
defense many times, coming within an
ace of scoring on three occasions.
Larkin, Erb, Hanley, Hale, Montgom
ery and Guerin played with a dash
throughout, giving the Stanford men
plenty of opportunity to practice
tackling.
In a ragged game, ending in dark
ness, the Palo Alto Athletic Club de
feated the second varsity by a lf> to 0
tally. Gladstone, Card, and Mecse
each made a try, all three being con
verted by Cass. The above players,
along with "Reddy" Greve, were the
stars for the clubmen, while Wright,
Summerfield, Flood and Henry played
well for the Stanford team.
The line-ups follows:
Stanford—Kester, (Pihlman), Sin
gle, (Scott), and Sample, (Schwarzen
bek), front rank; Coleman and Mur
ray, middle rank; Braden, (Chandler),

fense, Danny was a player always
watchcd by opponents. Reynolds says
that Carroll was in the best shape
that lie has ever been in. lie came
back to college this season after a
hard summer's work, and last Sat
urday was in tlie pink of condition,
lie was faster than ever before, and
was counted on to do a great deal in
t lie iinal struggle. The whole team
will miss Carroll's defense, and his
loss will put the l?ig Game on an even
basis.
