FEDERAL TELEGRAPH COMPANY
Palo Alto, Calif., Nov. 2, 1916.
Mr. J. C. Franklin.
Dear Pop:
In reply to your inquiry, I wish to say that the
photographic work which you did for the 1916 Quad was
satisfactory in every way. It was our aim in publishing
the book to get a good likeness of everyone whose picture
appeared. This requires clear, clean-cut photographs
of uniform quality—exactly what you gave us.
Our engravers often remarked that they wished all
the photographs they got were as uniformly good as the
ones we sent them from your studio.
I wish also to again express my appreciation of
the interest you took in our Quad, and the time you spent
helping us with it,
Very truly yours,
(Signed) H. F. ELLIOTT,
Manager 1916 Quad.
