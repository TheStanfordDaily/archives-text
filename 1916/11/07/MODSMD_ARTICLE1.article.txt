# UNMACK TELLS WHY RUGBY IS HERE TO STAY
## REFEREED FIRST GAME Writes of Improvement Since Introduction on Coast in 1906 
### William Unmack 
William Unmack, former sporting
editor of the San Francisco Chronicle,
and one of the foremost rugby critics
on the Pacific Coast, voluntarily sent
the following article to The Daily
Palo Alto, stating his reasons for in
creased growth of competition between
Stanford and the University of Santa
Clara, and for the indefinite continu
ance of the game now played.—Ed
note.

The question is asked over and over
a train—is rugby going to stick?
My personal opinion is that it is.
No matter what the differences be
tween Stanford and California may be,
110 matter that these colleges are not
playing a big game at this time —and
it is negligible if they ever get to
gether again for football —rugby is
going to stay.
My reason for this is two-fold —the
California Rugby Union and the Sta:i
ford-Santa Clara game. The former is
dojng an immense amount of good to
wards making the game stick and is
working out of the old adage, "Unity
is strength."
Thinks Interest Will (*row.
Two years ago, when the SLant'onl-
California break came, in a conversa-
tion with Father V. V. White, then
athletic director at Santa Clura, I
pointed out the possibilities of a big
game between the two colleges, say
ing that with proper cohesion between
the two colleges, the backing of the
game by the alumni of both and the
positive assurances of those in power
that the rugby code would be main
tained ,then the time would come when
the Stanford-Santa Clara game would
be to this section of the state and
the coast just what the Stanford-Cali
fornia game was in the past. I still
think that way.
Expects More "Pep."
I do not mean that this will all
come about in the course of one or
two years, but with the proper co
hesion and healthy rivalry between
the two big rugby colleges the inter
est and enthusiasm for this contest
will grow rapidly and at the
end of another five years it will not
surprise me to see Ewing Field or
any larger field packed to its capacity
with the same yelling madness, the
same colorful effects and the same
pre-game boiling enthusiasm.
First Contest Crude.
When I look back to the first rugby
game in 1906, which I refereed, and
the game as played today, it is ludi
crous. The game of 1906 was a
scramble, with little rugby, a lot of
American game, and science conspic
uous by its absence. Today the Amer
ican game element of football is miss
ing in rugby, and the science of the
code stands out pre-eminently. It is
a fitting reply to those who in 1906
belittled the rugby code and claimed
that it could not be brought up to
the standards of play and science the
game has attained in New Zealand,
Australia, and elsewhere.
The playing of Stanford and Santa
Clara today compares more than fav
orably with teams of similar organi
zations in any part of the world, and
a combined rugby team of stars from
these and other colleges and the big
clubs will hold its own with any for
eign rugby team.
The advancement of the game in
the schools has been just as rapid and
wonderful as in the colleges and while
fewer schools are playing rugby now
than a year ago yet the standard in
play of schools has increased and
high class scientific rugby is the rule.
Place for Ilotli Games.
California University is not only
satisfied with the American game, but
does not intend to return to the rugby
code. Stanford and Santa Clara are
satisfied with rugby and intend to
stick by it. There is room for both
games. Rugby has shown itself to
the public as a "spectators' game." It
is a game where individual merit and
spontaneous effort finds its place, and
the combination of man with man
makes its team play something that
the spectators applaud and demand,
rather than a game evolved in the
brain of the professional coach, where
each man has to play his part as di
rected only.
The coming Stanford-Santa Clara
game will be without doubt one of
the best exhibitions of the code ever
seen here. Santa Clara from all ac
counts has never shown to such ad
vantage, and while Stanford is hav
ing a lot of hard luck with injuries,
! etc., the boys from the farm will show
that spirit of recuperation when the
time comes for the final issue and the
thousands who go to Ewing Field will
see a game worth witnessing.
