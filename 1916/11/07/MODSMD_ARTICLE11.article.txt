# Campus and Palo Alto Follow Lead of Nation in Breaking All Records on Polling Votes
## 
### 
Early and heavy voting was the
general tendency throughout the
United States today, according to af
ternoon press dispatches. With over
half the voting population of San
Francisco at the polls by noon, all
records were shattered.
On the Stanford campus 347 voters
out of a total registration of 424 had
cast their ballots by 3:30 o'clock.
Over 200 had been out by 12 o'clock
By far the greater proportion of this
number were students. Over 100 mem
bers of the student body wielded the
rubber stamp in Palo Alto, where the
polls were thronged. There was a
considerable number of men and
women students who journeyed to
their homes —in some instances as far
as San Francisco —to cast their first
presidential ballot.
Total campus registration reached
424. Of this number 289 were men,
13") women, 209 Republicans, and 121
Democrats. Fifty-nine declined to
state.
Little satisfaction could be gleaned
from the first returns this afternoon.
Although Hughes was the favorite in
these figures, the basis for the calcu
lation was usually small-town statis
tics. Incomplete returns from 2:"> out
of 32 precincts in Topeka, Kansas,
save Wilson 874, and Hughes 1389.
