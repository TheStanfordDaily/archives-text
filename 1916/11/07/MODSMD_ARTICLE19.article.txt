Revised Spelling
Declared Necessary.
That English may be the universal
commercial language of the world, is
the statement of Professor John S. P.
Tatlock of the English department,
the only influence working against
this being the English spelling, which
makes it very difficult for foreigners
to learn the language. With but a 26
letter alphabet, we have some sixty
sounds, which are often spelled in six
or eight different ways, he says. The
"Literary Digest" now uses revised
spelling entirely.
