Odds Fnvor Woodland.
The Woodland fifteen is a strong
team, as is shown by the game with
Lowell high school yesterday. It will
be remembered by followers of the
game, that Lowell defeated the fresh
men this season, so the first year
squad will have to play hard tomor
row to come out on the long end of
the score.
Coach "Dutch" Henry had the fresh
men out practicing last night, and
will present a strong lineup in the
last game of the season on home
grounds. He is confident that the
first year fifteen, as it now stands, is
a stronger team than the one that
was defeated by Santa Clara, and is
anxious to see ins men work out
against Woodland.
Woodland will have a hard grind,
playing three tough games this week.
The Lowell contest was hard fought,
the freshmen game is expected to be
even, and on Friday, Palo Alto will
take 011 the visitors for the concluding
game of the northerners' tour.
The yell leaders are especially ur
gent that all those that can possibly
get to the bleachers, join in the yell
practice on Wednesday. The Santa
Clara game is but a l'ew days off, and
the school is woefully weak 011 the
new songs and yells. The practice
will have several novel features that
the leaders are not disclosing until
the workout.
The freshmen lineup follows:
Wayland, (Henry), Aubert, (Phair),
and Barneson, front rank; Millington,
(Bowden), and Martin, (Swift), mid
dle rank; Snook, (Humphries), Til
ton and McCartney, (Barneson), rear
rank; .loerg, (Strain), half; Cass and
Toole, five-eighths; Strong, center;
Gibbs, (Cattorn, Thayer), Seeley,
(Rogers), wings; Campbell (Larkin),
fullback.
