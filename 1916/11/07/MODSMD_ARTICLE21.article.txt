# Dr. Paul Shorey Delights Greek Literature Classes
## 
### 
Sheer wit and satire delighted the
audience of Dr. Paul Shorey, when
he translated the buffoonery and trib
ulations of the ancient Greek gods and
philosophers into twentieth century
language and experiences for his lis
teners this morning in his talk to Dr.
Murray's class in Greek Epic. Dr.
Shorey chose as his subject, "Lucius,
the Most Readable of the Ancients,"
but he overflowed in his enthusiasm
into the whole realm of ancient lit
erature.
