With nearly $1100 already on hand,
and several hundred dollars more def
initely promised, the campaign being
conducted for funds with which to buy
a relief ambulance as a memorial for
Professor Robert R. Pellissier gives
promise of undoubted success. The
amount which has been set as a goal is
$1000, which av ill be sufficient to buy
and maintain a Ford ambulance for
one year in France.
Student Campaign ruder Way.
Of the money now collected, $190
has been contributed by students.
This sum includes only contributions
from a part of the living groups. Ac
tual collections among the students
were begun for the most part only
last night. In most of the fraternities
and sororities and in Encina and Roble
Halls the solicitation for funds will
continue until Friday evening, when
the campaign will be arbitrarily
halted.
Professors 0. M. Johnston and P. A.
Martin spent Saturday in San Fran
cisco, and though but little actual col
lecting was done, received assurances
that friends of the University and of
Pellissier in the city will help along
the fund.
At tonight's meeting in the Assem
bly Hall, Cap and Gown will sell
candy and refreshments to the watch
ers of the presidential returns, and all
proceeds will be turned over to the
Pellissier fund.
