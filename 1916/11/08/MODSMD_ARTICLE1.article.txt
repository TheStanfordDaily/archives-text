In tlie closest national campaign
in forty years, Wilson and Hughes
ran neck and neck for the necessary
2GG electoral votes today. Through
out the day tlie tide turned from one
candidate to the other, the President
making his greatest gains late in the
afternoon. Both sides still claim

everything, though the Republican
confidence in evidence throughout the
nation last night, dwindled.
Wilson was conceded 2">l electoral
votes at G:l5 this afternoon, with
Hughes sure of 230. This grouping
did not include the states of Califor
nia, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New
Mexico. Oregon, Nortn Dakota, and
With returns complete in 430(5 pre
cincts out of a total of 5917 precincts,
Wilson leads in California by over
2,000 votes. In Minnesota, with the
tally two-thirds complete, Wilson
was in the lead by G,r»oo votes.
The states still recorded in the
doubtful column, control 50 electoral
votes. Of these Wilson needs 15 to
elect, if the states conceded to him
remain in line. Hughes, on the other
hand, needs 36. The states which Ite
publicans claim for Hughes are, New
Hampshire, Oregon, and West Vir
ginia, bringing the Republican total
to 247. California, growing more
doubtful as the count progresses,
might add 13 to Hughes' total. The
Democrats, on the other hand, claim
Minnesota, New Mexico, and North
Dakota. California is also claimed by
the Wilson supporters, who regard
the reelection of the President as
"safe."
Amendments In Doubt.
Vote on both prohibition amend
ments was close, with the wets lead
ing on number 1, while returns on
number 2 favored the drys. The re
turns 011 fully one-third of the state
aro still to come in. The precincts
not counted included some in both
wet and dry strongholds, and leave
both the "dry" and "wet" enthusi
asts in doubt as to the final result.
Wilson Wins On Campus.
Complete returns show that the
Stanford campus cast 177 votes for
Hughes and 200 for Wilson. On the
amendments, the vote at the campus
poll in the Women's Club House was
on number 1, yes 207, no 163; on num
ber 2, yes 262, 110 119.
The total vote in Palo Alto and the
campus was for Hughes 1204, and for
Wilson 1367. On amendment 1, the
drys cast 1730 votes against 916 for
the nos. Amendment 2 also carried,
1924 to 739.
Tension in the Assembly Hall, last
evening, during the receipt of "Ex
aminer" returns, was at breaking
point, as it must have been in every
section of the country. Although the
earliest bulletins favored the Repub
lican choice, it was not until figures
had arrived from the centers of pop
ulation, the large states of the east,
middle-west and New England, that
G. O. P. supporters felt assured of
victory.
Bulletins Favor Hughes.
The regularity with which Repub
lican pluralities came in convinced
Hughes' supporters that their candi
date had won. Wilson men left the
hall surprised, but for the most part
resigned to defeat. The real surprise
of the returns was the sudden switch
to Wilson which characterized the late
returns. Hughes men were dumb
founded during the morning hours,
Wilson men becoming more and more
confident as the day wore on.
