# UNCORK RUGBY ENTHUSIASM AT RALLY TOMORROW NIGHT
## Brown Names Varsity on Turf at 4:30 
### 
Positively no one will be admit
ted to the rally tomorrow evening
without a ticket. Tickets will be
distributed by the Registrar's of
ti<V, and only one will be given to
each student. Only students will
receive pasteboards.

Two events of intense interest are
on the card for Stanford supporters
tomorrow. At . p.m., the first occurs,
when the rooters at the rugby turf
learn from Coach Brown the line-up
of the varsity that opposes Santa
Clara. The Assembly Hall rally in
the evening, coupled with the serpen
tine and bonfire, completes the day's
calendar.
Promptly at 7:45 tomorrow night,
immediately after the striking of the
chimes, a blast from an old medieval
horn will be the signal for the red
fire all along the Row and towards
Encina to burst into flames. Upon
the blowing of this horn, which can
be hoard at all parts of the campus,
the mammoth rally of the evening will
start the program.
TICKETS NECESSAR Y
FOR ADMITTANCE
Tickets for this rally will be an
absolute necessity, and all should ob
tain them from the Registrar's office
tomorrow afternoon. Everyone should
obtain a pasteboard, for thero will be
no chance of obtaining admission with
out it. Palo Alto people will be ad
mitted through one door only. This
door will be the balcony door nearest
the library.
Five live speakers are listed on the
program already by Graduate Man
ager Behrens, with a possibility of
more. George Presley and James Lan
agan, former football coaches, and
both well known on the campus for
their rally speaking, head llio list.
Chris Bradley, '99, a former speaker
of note on the campus, is another of
the speakers. Coach Floyd Brown and
Trainer "Doc" Reynolds will also ad
dress the "howling mob.
Due to some hard luck, the confetti
did not arrive on the campus until
late this afternoon, and consequently
the freshmen will be expected to show
up at the training quarters any free
periods that they have tomorrow
morning. Tomorrow afternoon the
work must be completed, so freshmen
will have to show up then.
COACH HROWN NAMES
FIFTEEN AT 4:30
Approximately twenty-four hours
remain for Stanford dopesters to figure
on the fifteen that will meet the Santa
Clara squad. Tomorrow afternoon at
4:."0, Coach Floyd Brown will send
out 011 the field the team as they will
line-up for the bleachers to give the
once-over. Due to the fact that there
are apt to be many eleventh-hour
changes and to the close contest for
several positions, a large crowd will
be on hand without doubt, to know the
result.
Danny Carroll's injury has made
some backfield changes necessary and
thus at present the backfield is largely
a matter of speculation. Yell Lead
ers Gilroy, Hauser and Speers will be
on hand to direct the crowd in giving
the successful candidates for the 1916
Stanford varsity the vocal encourage
ment they deserve for their hard work
this season.
