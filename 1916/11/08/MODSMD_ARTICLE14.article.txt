# SUFFERING CATS

### 
During these nerve-racking hours of
llig Game anticipation and political
wrangling, the Stanford campus has
whirled topsy-turvy; in fact, gone
mad with enthusiasm. Old timers,
when reminiscing pioneer days, fail
to recall a week of such intense riv
alry and heated argument from which
there seems no abatement. Announce
ment tomorrow of the Cardinal varsity
opposing Santa Clara in the feature
match of the fall season, only serves
as additional oil to the fires.

After ten weeks' ceaseless grind
ing, today concludes the preliminary
practice, unmarred by a defeat. The
fifteen men who will be selected as
the Stanford varsity, in company with
the substitutes, deserve both hearty
support and warm appreciation.
Hardships undergone are but little
known to the average onlooker.
Thursday afternoon should find foot
ball enthusiasts galore on the bleach
ers, expressing their approbation at
the call of the yell-leaders.

That the customary display of ef
ficient, leather-lunged rooting of the
Stanford followers may be a feature
of the contest, every effort should be
made to master the words and music
of the new songs and acquire pro
ficiency in the yells. Sporting experts
are unanimous in the opinion that a
battle royal, which will be remem
bered for many moons, confronts the
fans. Tomorrow afternoon is* but the
opening gun of hostilities—all paths
leading to the rugby turf. In the
words of Bill Jordan, "Let 'er go!"
