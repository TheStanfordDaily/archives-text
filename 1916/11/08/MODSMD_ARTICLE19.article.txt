ELECTION AFTEKMATIIS.
Anyway, YOUR vote liad nothing to
do with it!
What's the use of being partial?
Hooray for Hughlson! That's the
sentiment of the I-never-bet boys
who don't care an elctoral vote who
wins.
As Tillie the Troubadour, sang to
day, "Many are the hearts that are joy
ous tonight, waiting for the bets to
be paid."
Yes, the pang of losing a bit of
coin is like the taste of onionsâ€”the
flavor lasts.
With the election over and last
night's howling success of an assem
bly a bygone, what are we going to
talk about now?
It started off something like this,
last evening: Hughes kicked off at
8:33 p.m., Wisconsin taking the ball
to the 3000-yard lino, passing to Chi
cago in time to avert being tackled by
Ohio. It ended thuswise: Taking the
ball from Wilson, Hughes dodged
through and planted the pigskin for a
try. This morning indications were
that some one had protested the game.
