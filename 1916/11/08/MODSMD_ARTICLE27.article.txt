# Euripides' Poetry Lowbrow Is Verdict
## 
### 
Euripides might be called a "low
brow" in the language of today, accord
ing to Dr. Paul Shorey of Chicago,
who lectured on "The Case of Euri
pides" iu the Little Theater last night.
"He dragged the stately four-beat
anapestic verse of Sophocles down to
the level of the frying pan and the
bourgeois," according to Dr. Shorey.
"The fashion for translation of
Greek poetry is as variable as that of
fall hats," he remarked, in comment
ing on interpreters of Euripides.
"Whatever Euripides thought, he
had to say, and his thoughts were as
plentiful as microbes."
