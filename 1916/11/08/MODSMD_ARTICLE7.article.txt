# WORK STARTS ON NEW LIBRARY IN MONTH
## CONTRACT AWARDED Stanford Inn to Make Way for New Half Million-Dollar Edifice 
### 
Actual work on Stanford's new half
million-dollar library will start within
a month, or at most within six weeks,
according to an announcement made
today by Business Manager Vanderlynn
Stow. Located in the center of the
new Quadrangle, the new library will
be the most impressive building of the
newer group of buildings, just as the
Memorial Church is the main archi
tectural feature of the old Quad
rangle.
General plans for the new library
have been approved, and the contract
for its construction has been awarded
to the P. J. Walker Company of San
Francisco. This company will have
general supervision of the erection
and will let all subcontracts with the
I approval of the University manage
ment. All that remains to be done
before ground can be broken
new structure is the completion of
final plans and specifications by Hake
well and Brown, University archi
tects.
To Remove J mi.
Removal of the Stanford Inn to a
point opposite the Engineering corner
and the Bookstore, will be made
necessary by the erection of the new
library. Arcades will •eventually join
the front facade of the library to the
sale of refreshments to those watch
ins election returns, of which sum
about $35 is profit and will be added
: to the Pellissier fund.
A letter addressed to President
| Wilbur from Henry D. Sleeper, who is
! in charge of the American Ambulance
Service in New York, explains the
use' to which the ambulance will be
j put:
"Through Mr. Charles Freeborn, 1
■ have learned today of your tribute o!'
j friendship in behalf of the Field Ser
! vice, and the truly valiant help you
are giving us in raising money for an
ambulance in memory of Professor
| Pellissier. As manager of this fund
j I want to offer you, and those who
are making this effort for us, our very
keenest appreciation. To those of us
who are doing our part in this coun
try, such encouragement helps more
than anything else to carry us
through to success.
"I want to tell you, in what may
seem rather dry statistics, exactly
how much good one of these am
bulances in the Field Service accom
plishes. Each of our cars carries, 011
a low average, ten men a day, or over
3,600 in a year. As our past two
1 years' experience has proven that over
50 per cent of these wounded French
men are saved by our first quick aid,
it does make all the time and labor
we can put into the effort seem glor
iously worth while.

are making this effort for us, our very
keenest appreciation. To those of us
who are doing our part in this coun

than anything else to carry us
through to success.

how much good one of these am

a low average, ten men a day, or over
3,600 in a year. As our past two

50 per cent of these wounded French
men are saved by our first quick aid,
it does make all the time and labor

Actual work on Stanford's new half
million-dollar library will start within
a month, or at most within six weeks,
according to an announcement made
today by Business Manager Vanderlynn
Stow. Located in the center of the
new Quadrangle, the new library will
be the most impressive building of the
newer group of buildings, just as the
Memorial Church is the main archi
tectural feature of the old Quad
rangle.
General plans for the new library
have been approved, and the contract
for its construction has been awarded
to the P. J. Walker Company of San
Francisco. This company will have
general supervision of the erection
and will let all subcontracts with the
I approval of the University manage
ment. All that remains to be done
before ground can be broken
new structure is the completion of
final plans and specifications by Hake
well and Brown, University archi
tects.
