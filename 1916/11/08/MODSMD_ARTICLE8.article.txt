# AUSTIN MAY SHIFT MISSION RUGGERS
## Coach Decides to Start Berndt and Hickey in Final Fifteen 
### 
Charley Austin is making few
eleventh-hour changes on the Univer
sity of Santa Clara varsity. He is
practicing the same lineup that he
has been playing throughout the sea
son, and the fifteen seems to be in ex
cellent shape.
There is a possibility that Hickey
will at last win out over lvorte for a
rear rank berth, playing opposite
Coschina. This move would cause lit
tle comment, as Hickey is a veteran
of two years, and has had lots of ex
perience. He is not in the best of
condition, however, having a weak
knee that was injured in baseball.
O'Neil is back in college and will in
all probability replace Jimmy C'urtin
at trout rank. O'Neil and Howell
make a pair of wonderful hookers,
and should get the ball 011 even terms
with the Cardinal trio.
llatkiielri Easy to Dope.
111 the backfield, Berndt is the only
man that has not played regularly
that stands a chance to nose into the
Big Game lineup, lie may take Le-
Berveau's place at second five, al
though the Frenchman has shown
good tackling ability, a necessary
requisite when playing against Otto
Lachmund.
