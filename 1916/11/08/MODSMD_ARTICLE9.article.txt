## 
### 
Final division of the Stanford de
bating squad into teams, to meet the
University of Southern California and
the University of California, was
made today by Debating Coach K. E.
Leib. '15.
F. S. Field, '18, W. T. Ames, 'IS, and
Miss Margaret Shedd, '20, will strive
to outargue the U. S. C. orators in
the Stanford Assembly Hall, Wednes
day evening, November 22. D. W.
Evans, '20, G. J. Knight, '19, and H. C.
Blote, '18, meet the California foren
sic squad in San Francisco on the
evening of Friday, November 24. Miss

Dorothy Hoskins, '19, will act as al
ternate for both teams.
The Stanford squad is rounding into
shape slowly, but from now on will
pick ii]) speed in the work of prepar
ation, according to Coach Leib.
Of the two trios, the one which will
oppose U. S. C. appears to be a little
stronger, as regards experience, at
least. For the first time in a number
of years a woman has a place on a
Stanford varsity debating team. Miss
Shedd last year won first prize in the
California High School Debating
