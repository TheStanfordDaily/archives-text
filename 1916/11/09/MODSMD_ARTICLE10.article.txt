Congratulations, numerous and
hearty, arc extended fifteen ruggers
who will don Cardinal colors in Sat
urday's intercollegiate classic with
Santa Clara. Only after two months

minute, is selected. Every player de
serves a host of credit. Ris;ht along
side, in the honor roll, place Coach
Brown and Trainer Reynolds, both of
whom cut in for a healthy slicc of
handshakes.

Another paragraph is begun, a
short one, but it contains genuine ap
preciation. While the rugby satellites
are being slapped upon the back, bear
in mind, the men whose generous ser
vice has been invaluable, —to the sec
ond varsity one must extend a world
of credit. As for the substitutes who
just missed their goal, we are only too
sorry that there are not seven addi
tional block letters to be distributed.

Surely it remains unnecessary to
urge the student body to turn out en
masse at this evening's rally. Foot
ball enthusiasts, dopesters, and sport
ing experts will be thicker than mi
crobes in the Assembly Hall, where
Clays and Calhouns are scheduled to
orate, sandwiched in between the veil
leaders' hysteria.
