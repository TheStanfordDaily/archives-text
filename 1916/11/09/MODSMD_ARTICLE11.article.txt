# Hale Favors Stanford

### Bill Hale 
It's true that all of the "dope"
seems to favor Santa Clara, but, nev
ertheless, I don't think that they will
win. It's just a hunch, I'll admit that.
T have always felt that the Santa
Clara team is giving everything that
it has in each game, playing to the
margin of its power, without the abil
ity to draw on any reserve "pep."
Stanford teams always have a way
of playing 'way over their heads in
these big games.
