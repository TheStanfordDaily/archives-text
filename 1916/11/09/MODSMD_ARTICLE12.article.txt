# Mission Team Should Be Winner
## Opinion of S.F. Sporting Writer Favors Red and White 
### R.C. Bailey 
Santa Clara ought to win, if they
resist the emotional atmosphere of
the Big Game and play the scientific
rugby Charlie Austin has taught them.
.Judged by the preliminary cam
paign, the Mission lifteen is distinctly
better balanced. The Stanford back
field, even without Danny Carroll, re
mains more brilliant in attack, but
in defense they are less reliable. The
Santa Clara pack is superior in the
tight and loose, and if the ground is
wet, their more accomplished foot
work should give them an important
advantage. If they are not seized
with an epidemic of Big Occasion
nerves, the result of their youthl'ul
ness, it will not be surprising to see
the Prune-pickers' pack win the
match.
The unknown quantity in the situ
ation is Stanford spirit. it has
achieved great things in the past. The
injury to Danny Carroll is a stagger
ing blow. But disaster rouses the

dauntless to heroic deeds. Stanford
has never had a better chance to
show what sort of stuff they are made.
The Editor recklessly writes: "Tell
us what you think of rugby." Will be
print a library? Probably not, in this
headlong age. Perhaps, he can con
trive a corner for a paragraph.
Rugby is the finest football game
because it demands all that is fine
in the heart of a man and nothing
that is not. Rugby needs Stanford, be
cause it is the sort of place that will
play it in the right spirit. Stanford
needs rugby to help mold it into the
great University it ought to be.
Pioneer work was ever dull and
difficult. But what work is more
worth while? Where would America
be without it? Some day this coun
try will be grateful to Stanford for
establishing on a firm foundation a
noble game. At a time when sport
plays so all-important a part in the
life of the people, it is a task worthy
of the best efforts of a great Univer
sity.
