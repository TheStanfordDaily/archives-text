# Stanford Spirit Will Win Game
## 
### C.J. Smith 
The Stanford-Santa Clara game is
probably a more important event
from a Santa Clara standpoint than
from Stanford's. Santa Clara is
keener to win. A victory over the
Cardinal would be the greatest they
have ever achieved on an athletic
field.
Stanford has had the experience.
These "big games" have been annual
events with the college since the first
two were played back in 1892. The
spirit is different with Stanford than
Santa Clara. The Cardinal fifteen
will go on the field expecting to win
and will play their game. Santa
Clara will take the field confident but
anxious.
Judging the teams solely on pre
liminary games there is no denying
that the Missionites have the shade,
and a fairly pood shade at that. They
have done all that has been asked of
them during the season and have done
it in good, workmanlike, consistent
style. Stanford has been more or
less erratic.
Many followers of the sport figure
that over-anxiety will bring about the
downfall of the Missionites. That may

be quite si factor in the outcome of the
game, but even if both teams play up
to their I>est form, I can't help feeling
that Stanford will be returned the
winner.
Following these games closely since
the season of 1593, I have seen any
number of Stanford teams, not only
apparently shaded, as this one is, but
seemingly badly outclassed in the pre
liminary season, come along in the
last week and mop up with California.
It's a wonderful spirit Stanford has
and it has carried them through many
a crisis before.
Doubtless the Stanford fifteen has
a tough battle on its hands. The boys
are going against one of the best de
fensive teams that ever played the
rugby game here. Santa Clara's
splendid offense is surpassed by its
defense, so the Cardinal must also
show a wonderful defense to win.
That's where 1 expect to see Stanford
surpriseâ€”on Ihe defense. They're
great fighters when their goal line is
in jeopardy. With two great defensive
teams on the field there is liable to
be less scoring in this game than :'s
usual in rugby. A small score, and
that in favor of Stanford, is the way
I figure it.
