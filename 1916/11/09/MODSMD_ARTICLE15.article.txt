# Woodland vs "Pally" on Turf Tomorrow
## Local High School Team Is After Champiomship of North 
### 
Woodland high shool ruggers will
meet the fast Palo Alto High team
ion the varsity field at 3:30 tomorrow.
I The game will bo the last that the
! Woodland team will play during their
trip in this part of the state.
The up-state players demonstrated
in their game yesterday with the
freshmen and in the contest with
Lowell, Wednesday, that they furnish
the style of play that is pleasing to
the bleacherites. They play the ball
hard all the time and are heavy tack
lers.
The "Pally" team has been going
fine this season. Their defeat of San
Jose and the hopes of a victory over
Berkeley for the northern champion
ship, encourages them to give a good
account of themselves tomorrow.
Palo Alto is outweighed by the Wood
land team, but they have shown better
football knowledge.
