# Sproule Enumerates Precepts of Success
## 
### 
Six strong qualities must be prev
alent in men and women if they are
to be successful, according to William
Sproule, head of the Southern Pacific,
who spoke in the Assembly Hall this
morning. "The qualities of men who
accomplish things," said President
Sproule, "are energy, initiative, pur
pose, ability to think clearly, per
sonal character, and humanitarian
spirit." The speaker enlarged on
these ideas, and pointed out that mere
amassing of wealth is not sufficient
purpose in life, and that the modern
successful man takes a broader and
more generous attitude toward life.
Senator Stanford was cited as an ex
ample of this type of man.
