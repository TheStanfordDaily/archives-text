SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 9.—As much
doubt surrounded the final outcome of
the Hughes-Wilson race at noon to
day as had been in evidence at a late
hour last night. Chances for the elec

the announcement that the Republican
candidate had carried Minnesota, and
that Wilson's lead both in California
and North Dakota were being gradu
ally worn down.
At 3 o'clock this afternoon New

lier bulletins, and gave the lead
in that state to Wilson by 73S

time, had been carried by the
Democrats.
