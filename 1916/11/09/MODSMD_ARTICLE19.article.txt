(Internationnl News Service Bulletin.)
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 9.—As much
doubt surrounded the final outcome of
the Hughes-Wilson race at noon to
day as had been in evidence at a late
hour last night. Chances for the elec
tion of Hughes seemed to grow wuu
the announcement that the Republican
candidate had carried Minnesota, and
that Wilson's lead both in California
and North Dakota were being gradu
ally worn down.
At 3 o'clock this afternoon New
Mexico reports contradicted ear
lier bulletins, and gave the lead
in that state to Wilson by 73S
votes. New Hampshire, at this
time, had been carried by the
Democrats.
California returns are gradually
becoming more favorable to
Hughes. Wilson's lead in this
state early this afternoon was re
ported as not over 500, and grow
ing smaller at each return. Over
25,000 California votes are yet to
be tallied, with over 300 precincts
unheard from.
Late North Carolina figures
brought the Wilson advantage
from 1248 to about 1000.
The swing of California will in
all probability decide the election,
with 255 electoral votes now gen
erally conceded to both Hughes
and Wilson. With the result
pending upon this narrow mar
gin, there is no doubt but that the
losing side will contest the elec
tion. This will mean that a def
inite decision will not be known
for some days.
Here is the situation in tabu
lated form:
