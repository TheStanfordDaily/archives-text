# HUGE BONFIRE WILL ENTHUSE CARDINAL FANS
## 
### 
At the striking of the 7:45 chimes,
tonight, followed by a strong blast on
an old cow horn, red (Ire will blase
up along the entire length of the Row
and also in the direction of Encina.
Leather-lunged rooters will then pour j
forth and wend their way to the As
sembly Hall, led by tin pans, horns,
and noise-making devices of every
sort.
One thing that is absolutely neces
sary for every rooter is that a tickc-t
of admission be procured from the
Registrar's office during the after
noon. Distribution will be made until
the closing of the Registrar's office,
and positively no one will be admitted
without one.
Former Coaches Speakers.
At the Assembly Hall, seats will be
made to stand in rather than to be Pat J
in. Speakers of first class caliber are
on the program. James Lanagan,
coach of the Cardinal football teams
from 190.J-07, will be one of the lead
ers of the evening. George Presley,
former Stanford coach, also will be a
feature speaker of the evening. An
other of the old-time brigade who will â€¢
speak to the howling mob is Chris
Bradley, '99, well known on the cam
pus for his peppery speeches.
Coach Brown will tell of the game
from the standpoint of the coach, while
Trainer "Doc" Reynolds will tell of
the latest on the condition of the
team. "Daddy" Marx completes th"
list of speakers of the evening.
Front Rows for Team.
When the crowd is assembled, the |
team will file in and will occupy the i
two front rows reserved for them.
Members of the training table began j
the Big Game festivities this after
noon with the annual peerade on the
Row, starting and ending at the Phi
Psi house.
Due to the program of the evening
being filled, rooters at the Assembly
Hall are requested to give vent to
their feelings at the proper moments,
so that the leaders will have time to
give instructions before the bonfire
attracts the bunch to the open air.
Seats in the balcony are reserved
for the women of the University, and
it is expected that they will avail
themselves of the privilege and be in
their places before the men arrive.
