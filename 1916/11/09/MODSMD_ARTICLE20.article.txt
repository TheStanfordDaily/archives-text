# COACH AUSTIN FIGURES TEAM LUCKY TO WIN
## 
### Coach Austin 
I regret the loss of Carroll to Stan
ford, as I appreciate his value, hav
ing played the line with him. I was
anxious to have Santa Clara stack
up against the best possible team
from the Farm. We will consider
ourselves fortunate if we win, despite
such a loss.
