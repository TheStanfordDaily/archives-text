# Records Do Not Count

### Manager Aurrecoechea 
Wo regret the loss of Carroll to
Stanford, but appreciate that Stanford
will play better than they have dur
ing the training season. I do not
think that the records of the prelim
inary games are a criterion for the
Big Game. It is anybody's game.
The forwards look to be about equal
in ability, while the backs are untried
as yet. Stanford has more stars in
the line-up.
May the bettor team be victorious.
