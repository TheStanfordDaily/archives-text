# Stanford Should Win
## 
### Jim Wylie 
I have never been more confident of
a rugby team winning a game than I
am over the Stanford team that will
take the field against Santa Clara
next Saturday. It is most unfortunate
for Stanford that Danny Carroll, a
hero of many a rugby struggle on both
sides of the globe, should be placed
hors de combat during the final week
of preparation, because his place can
not be adequately filled. The ques
tion is then, can the forwards more
than offset his absence in the back
fiold? I feel sure that they will come
through and that they will even sur
prise Coach Brown.
The game should go down in history
as one of the most exciting and evenly
contested rugby games ever witnessed
on this coast. Stanford, however,
should win, because they are an ex
tremely well balanced team.
