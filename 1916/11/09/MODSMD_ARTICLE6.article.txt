# "Babes" Capture Moonlight Rugby
## Despite Flying Tackles Woodand Loses to Freshmen by 5-0 Score 
### 
Stanford freshmen defeated the
heavy Woodland high school fifteen
yesterday afternoon on the Cardinal
turf, the score at the end of one hour's
hard rugby reading to 0.
"Mush" Stevens handled the whistle
and speeded up the play by bis ex
cellent work. Few delays were
caused by the awarding of penalties.
Woodland played a defensive game
throughout, but showed a dash that
took the freshmen off their feet at
times.
The game was ragged for the first
fifteen minutes, but a try by Jottrg,
who received a pass from Snook near
the line, started the hostilities. Cass
converted the lone score of the game,
bringing the total up to five. From
then on, the game was intensely ex
citing, the bleacherites being thrilled
by long runs, and hard tackling.
Captain Wraith and Smith, the
breakaways of the northern fifteen,
were the stars, sharing honors, how
ever, with "Bud" Larkin of the fresh
men. The game ended with the teams
playing by moonlight, the second half
being even up, leaving the score at
5 to 0.
