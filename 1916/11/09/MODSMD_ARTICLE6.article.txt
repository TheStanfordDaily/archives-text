# "Babes" Capture Moonlight Rugby
## Despite Flying Tackles Woodand Loses to Freshmen by 5-0 Score 
### 
Stanford freshmen defeated the
heavy Woodland high school fifteen
yesterday afternoon on the Cardinal
turf, the score at the end of one hour's
hard rugby reading to 0.
"Mush" Stevens handled the whistle
and speeded up the play by bis ex
cellent work. Few delays were
caused by the awarding of penalties.
Woodland played a defensive game
throughout, but showed a dash that
took the freshmen off their feet at
times.
The game was ragged for the first
fifteen minutes, but a try by Jottrg,
who received a pass from Snook near
the line, started the hostilities. Cass
