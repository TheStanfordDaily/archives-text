# COACH BROWN OPTIMISTIC OF FINAL SCORE
## 
### Coach Brown 
It would be very hard to pick a
likely winner of the Big Game to be
played on Ewing Field next Satur
day. Before I attempt it, I would
like to express my appreciation of the
work of the second varsity and the
whole squad. Without these players,

(ho varsity could not bo what it is,
tho team would suffer from a lack
of strong competition, and material
for future Stanford teams would not
he developed.
Santa Clara has a fifteen that we
expect will call forth every effort on


. Coach Floyd Brown.
