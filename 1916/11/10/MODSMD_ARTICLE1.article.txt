# STANFORD SPIRIT BLAZES FORTH AT RALLY
## APPLAUSE FOR BROWN Assembly Hall Kept in Constant Uproar by Six Dyed in Wool Orators 
### 
Stanford Assembly Hall was crowd
ed to its utmost last night when the
long smouldering Stanford Spirit
burst into flames, followed shortly
afterwards by the huge pyre erected
by the Class of IUL'O. Shortly after 7,
the march towards the hall started
along the Row and from the Hall,
meeting at the Quad, and filing in the
Assembly Hall. Then the Ya-Hoo
mascot was brought in, amid a roar
of applause.

Last night's rally might easily be
said to be the best that has been
seen on the campns for many a day.
Yell Leader Gilroy and his assistants
had little difficulty in urging the
crowd to make a noise, for it just
naturally burst forth. Six live ora
tors were listed on the program, and
their remarks kept the crowd in a
continual uproar.
Leland W. Cutler, president of the
Stanford Alumni Association, was the
first speaker on the bill. lie stated


Stanford Cheer Loaders.
that Stanford undergraduates may
rest assured that the alumni are back
of us in everything that we tackle
and that Saturday's contest is no ex
ception.
Chris Bradley Brings Out "Pep."
Following Cutler was Chris Bradley,
'99, well remembered for his speech
of last year. Bradley's words again
brought forth enthusiasm from the
rooters. "Danny Carroll's injury will

help Stanford rather than hinder
them. Each and every member of the
fifteen that opposes Santa Clara will
be the more on his mettle and will
play a little bit harder on acconnt of
the thought of their injured comrade.
Danny Carroll will thus, in a way, be
in the game, and Stanford will win
that game," were a part of his re
marks on the subject.
Coach Brown Starts Things.
Coach Floyd Brown was the next
speaker called upon and pandemonium
then did break loose. Fully five
minutes were given over to cheering

Coach Brown. Wlien he finally got a
chance to speak, he said, In part: "The
first thing that I wish to do is to
thank the second varsity and entire
squad for their willingness displayed
on the field this entire season, (ireat
credit must be given them for the
fighting spirit, for they fight hardest
when chances seem smallest. If the
Stanford student body gets behind the
fifteen for the full eighty minutes of
play, Saturday, and fights as these
men have done, I am confident that
you will not be disappointed in the
result."
"Doc" Reynolds' Sentiments.
Trainer "Doc" Reynolds now ap
peared and, like Coach Brown, com
plimented the second varsity squad
j He stated that the varsity was one in
j every sense of the word and that with
j the bleachers behind them, Saturday,
fully believed that they would win.
Business Manager Vanderlynn Stow
made a brief speech, in which he said
it was his opinion that anyone who
missed the intercollegiate, Saturday,
would miss one event in life that he
would ever regret missing.
"Jimmy" Lanagan, former Stanford

football coach, made the concluding
speech of the evening, and although
he said he was no orator, his remarks
would rather prove otherwise. "What
ever might be said of Santa Clara,"
he remarked, "we must say with all
due credit to them, that they have
never gone back on any agreement
made with Stanford." Lanagan also
praised Floyd Brown for his work and
for the influence that lie has upon
the men on the campus. "I believe
that Floyd Brown is one of the best
football coaches that Stanford has
ever had, and that his inlluence as
a man is as great as any head of a
department in the faculty. May Stan
ford continue to have men of the type
of Floyd Brown in charge of their
athletics," was the way he stated it.
At this point, led by the band and
yell leaders, the crowd marched out
and serpentined through the Inner
Quad and to the bonfire.


Coach Floyd Brown.
