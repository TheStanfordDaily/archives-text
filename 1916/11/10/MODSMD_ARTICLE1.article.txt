# STANFORD SPIRIT BLAZES FORTH AT RALLY
## APPLAUSE FOR BROWN Assembly Hall Kept in Constant Uproar by Six Dyed in Wool Orators 
### 
Stanford Assembly Hall was crowd
ed to its utmost last night when the
long smouldering Stanford Spirit
burst into flames, followed shortly
afterwards by the huge pyre erected
by the Class of IUL'O. Shortly after 7,
the march towards the hall started
along the Row and from the Hall,
meeting at the Quad, and filing in the
Assembly Hall. Then the Ya-Hoo
mascot was brought in, amid a roar
of applause.

Last night's rally might easily be
said to be the best that has been
seen on the campns for many a day.
Yell Leader Gilroy and his assistants
had little difficulty in urging the
crowd to make a noise, for it just
naturally burst forth. Six live ora
tors were listed on the program, and
their remarks kept the crowd in a
continual uproar.
Leland W. Cutler, president of the
Stanford Alumni Association, was the
first speaker on the bill. lie stated


Stanford Cheer Loaders.
