# Manager Behrens Picks Stanford
## Looks for Cardinal Victory by 10 Point Margin 
### E.C. Behrens 
The present season has been a most
trying one. More games have been
played than ever before, and this has
thrown an added burden on Coach
Floyd Brown and Trainer Reynolds
and their assistants. Cheerfully
lacing the training season, filled with
many unheralded difficulties, these
two men have given their best efforts
toward moulding a varsity fifteen
which will carry the confidence of
the Stanford campus into the game on
Saturday. The loyalty and untiring
zeal of Brown and Reynolds must not
be forgotten by the rooters when the
1916 rugby year is in review.
The score is to be a close one—it
should not be anything but close —
with two teams as well matched as
the opponents on Saturday. A mar
gin of ten points should place Stan
ford in the winning column. Stan
ford will win because the varsity will
be at the height of its condition, phy
sically and mentally, on Saturday; be
cause its team combination will be
better than that shown during the
preliminary tryout games, and be

cause Stanford teams may be relied
on to play better, fight harder and
prove their best worth under the most
crucial of circumstances.
No Stanford team has shown to
better advantage than when it was
placed in a crucial position. On Sat
urday, eight men on the Cardinal fif
teen will feel the sensations of a "big
game" for the first time. But this
should not terrify the Stanford root
ers. Rugby experience, condition, and
that indefinable something called the
"Stanford spirit" is to prove that the
newspaper critics are in error in pre
dicting a defeat for the Cardinal by
at least two tries. As in past seasons
the Stanford backfield has been point
ed to as the pride of the rugby turf,
while the forwards have been given
second place in selecting the strong
points of the rival players. Santa
Clara boasts of the prowess of her
forwards, but no follower of rugby is
justified in assuming that the Stan
ford forwards will not prove as help
ful toward a Cardinal victory as the
underrated forward line on the teams
of the past few years.
