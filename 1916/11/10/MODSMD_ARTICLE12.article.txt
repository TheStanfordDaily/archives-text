# PSYCHOLOGY OF GAME WILL WIN
## 
### Neil H. Petree, '19 
vvnen me news uroKe during the
summer months that Charlie Austin
would coach the University of Santa
Clara football team this season, all of
us who stand firmly behind the rugby
standard were glad. Austin was one
of the greatest football stars that this
coast has ever known, being a cog in
that wonderful combination, Erb, Aus
tin, Lachmund, Carroll, and Urban.
Those who knew him expected him to
be as good a coach as a player.
The work of the Santa Clara fifteen
during the present season has been
phenomenal. They have inflicted
overwhelming defeats upon teams that
Stanford has found great difficulty in
winning over, while their goal line has
been crossed but once, and that on a
rank fluke.
Every clew that can be doped be
fore the big game points to a Mission
Town victory. As some of the San
Francisco sporting editors say, "If

Santa Clara will play rugby as they
know how to play it, the Cardinal will
have a tough job." This I do not be
lieve they will do. Using former
games with Santa Clara as a criter
ion, as well as the freshmen game
this year, 1 think that the spirit of
the intercollegiate contest will en
thuse the Stanford players, and they
will play away above their heads,
while on the contrary, the crowd will
make the less experienced Catholic
college team nervous and over-anx
ious, and their game will be below
standard.
Danny Carroll's loss makes it
doubly hard for Stanford to come
through as in the past, but Floyd
Brown has all the confidence that his
team will be returned a winner, so
why should not we humble followers
join in the swim, have faith in the
"psychology of the Rig Game," and be
sincere in the belief that a Stanford
team, even with odds against it, will
win.
