The fact that Santa Clara has scored
more points and has been scored on
less than Stanford, this fall, does not
mean much to one who has followed
Santa Clara teams closely for the
past five years.
The reason is simple. The Mission
boys enter into every contest as
though it were a big game. Their
rooters are with the team, at every
moment of every preliminary game.
Spurred on by this support, Santa
Clara players go out for a big score

in every contest.
Stanford players and fans do not
take the practice games so seriously.
Whether this is a fanlt is another
question. But the fact remains that
they do not show the spirit of the
Santa Clarans during the preliminary
season.
This difference in the attitude of
the two colleges toward their teams
means that the Catholic school al
most invariably makes a better pre
big game showing. It was the case
last year, although in a lesser degree.

It is therefore safe to say that
Santa Clara has been seen at her best.
Austin's men have been in condition
for several weeks. "Doc" Reynolds
assures us that the Stanford varsity
will reach the height of condition to
morrow. Herein lies the advantage
which Stanford surely holds, and
which should mean victory.
Charley Austin has in a large meas
ure transplanted the Stanford style of
play down at Santa Clara, and the
Red and White wearers will be seen
playing a different game from pre
vious years. Austin has not trans
planted the Stanford spirit, and if the
Cardinal rooters give their support
tomorrow, the tradition that Stan
ford teams "come through" in big
games will be upheld.
