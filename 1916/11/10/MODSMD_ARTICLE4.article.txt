# FAVOR STANFORD TO WIN CONTEST
## Australian Star Believes Forwards Deciding Factor 
### Peter Flanagan 
The Mig (lame next Saturday prom
ises to lie the hardest game of the
season.
About three weeks ago Santa Clara
was exhibiting far superior rugby to
that displayed by Stanford.
In the last game against the Olym
pic Club, however, Santa Clara could
not boast the same relative superior
ity as in previous games against the
city players.
I have played several times against
both teams, and think that during tlio
last couple of weeks the Stanford
players have improved so much that

they should be slight favorites.
Id my opinion the winning of the j
ball in the scrum will he a very im
portant factor—perhaps tlie most im
portant factor —in this department. I
believe the eight-man scrum will
prove superior to tho seven. In other
departments of forward play tho
teams appear to be evenly matched,
tho Stanford eight perhaps having the
edge in sliced. The back field play, de
pending as it does largely on how the
forwards operate, is more or less an
unknown quantity. The absence of
Carroll is of course irremediable, but
notwithstanding this I think that
Stanford will still win.
