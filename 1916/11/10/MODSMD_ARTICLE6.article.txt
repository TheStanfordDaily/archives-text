# "RIC" templeton SAYS VARSITY WINNER
## VICTOR HARD TO PICK Comparitive Scores of Little Value in Doping Result of Game 
### "Ric" Templeton 
"There never was a winner harder
to pick"—that is the verdict first
voiced by the newspaper men and
popularly echoed by the rest of us.
A consideration of the affecting in
fluences may help to analyze this
feeling.
( (inclusion From Tlirw Stands.
There are three standpoints on
which we may base our conclusions.
They are, firstly, by comparative
scores; secondly, by comparative
methods of play; and thirdly, by a
comparison of the possible effect
which "big game" feeling may have
upon the individuals making up the
two teams,
Coinparsitive Scores of Xo Value.
A comparison of the scores shows
Santa Clara to be far in the lead, and
if this be the only base for our con
clusions, we should well feel shaky,
despite the fact that for various rea
sons it is impossible in club circles to
assemble as strong a team on Sun
day as on Saturday. The personnel
may be the same, but they are not as
able physically nor as well-tuned psy
chologically, consequently this basis
must be moderated.
In rugby there are two large meth
ods of play—the one, playing the ball;
the other, playing the man. After
playing both teams, the club foot
baller is ready to place Stanford in
the first division and Santa Clara mid
way between the first and second.
Under the conditions existing in the
first, be will play as hard and as long
as his physical condition will per
mit, but in the second, mere personal
contact is the large feature, he will
not indulge so whole-heartedly be
cause of the additional risk of injury
and also because he -is playing for
fun and that ceases as soon as the
game assumes such an aspect. Con
sequently the showing of his team is
less than it would otherwise be, and
this in a large way accounts for the
disparity of scores as made by the
two teams.
As for the possible effect which "big
game" feeling will have upon the two
teams, not enough attention is paid.
Without level-headedness, combination
is impossible, and the game becomes
a series of interminable forward
rushes, random kicks, and tiresome
scrums, consequently the team which
can stand aloof from the influences of
the Big Game and remain on earth,
or at least are the first to return
there, stands every chance of being the
winner. This, I believe Stanford the
far more capable of doing. Enthusi
asm is a racial temperament, but
poise is an additional acquirement.
Any team can and will play the man
under tense feeling—that is natural,
but to play the ball to win requires
something far deeper than enthusi
asm.
This, Coach Brown has succeeded
in instilling in past years, and the
supposition that it has been over
looked in the present season is ab
surd. It is the explanation that
"Stanford teams come at the season."
