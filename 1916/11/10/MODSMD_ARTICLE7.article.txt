# Bartlett Has Hunch of Cardinal Winning
## Stanford's Scoring Line of Backs Will Equal Scrum of Santa Clara 
### R.S. Bartlett 
"Enie, meenie, minie, mo."
That is about the fashion in which
most of us uninformed and rudder
less has-beens look upon this Sanla
Clara-Stanford rugby business. It re
solves itself right down to the case of
old Josephus Hunch. Both teams
have played high class ball all through
!the season. Santa Clara is granted
superior strength in the scrum and a
set of grim, hard tackling backs, who
have kept attackers away from their
goal line during practically every
contest of the season. On the other
hand, Stanford seems to have an av
erage pack, which may improve in the
next week and another swift -and
powerful scoring line of backs.
Scoring Hacks Will Win.
It has been the experience in the
past that scoring backs have won
from strong defense and determined
forwards. This has proved up with
mathematical precision. While Santa
Clara's backs look better this year
than last it is my opinion that Stan
ford, if her forwards come close to
holding the Mission Town pack, should
win. This, however, with very little
close knowledge.
The lads with the dope sheets are
at a loss to pick the winner, and so
my view is not worth much. Still,
reverting back to the old-time days of
give and take, I feel that Stanford
will win, and this via the old hunch
route.
