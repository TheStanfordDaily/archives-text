MURADG, The Turkish
Cigarettes, 15 cents, are BET
TER in EVERY WAY than
many cigarettes you pay 25
cents fcr.
Made cf better tobaccos, costing
more to manufacture.
Richer in cc'izfacticn and in class.
With mere "EY', more sparkle,
more subctcnce.
Net a "little betternot "perhaps
better"—but to MUCH better, thct
you will feel like having yourself
locked up fcr cheating yourself-—and
then go your cwn bail to get cut and
smoke a Murad.
Makers of the Highest G r vdc
Turkish and Egyptian
Cigarettes in the World.
