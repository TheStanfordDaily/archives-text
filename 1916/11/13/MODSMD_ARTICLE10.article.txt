# CARDINAL DEFEAT VICTORY FOR RUGBY
## COMPETITION ASSURED Missionites Demonstrate Their Worth as Competitors for Stanford 
### F.J. Taylor, '18 
That Saturday's defeat of the var
sity at the hands of Chariie Austin's
Santa Clara ruggers may ho a cloud
through which shines a silver lining,
is the opinion of many rugby fans.
That silver lining is foreseen in com
petition which the Missionite squad
can put up for the Cardinals in the
future.
Cardinal Has Competition.
The principal criticism of Stanford's
consistent policy for rugby has been
that local ruggers might become won
ders at ihe game but would have 110
opponents upon which to practice
their tricks except weak teams such as
Santa Clara puts out. That criticism
was hauled out with the hearse, which
over-confident Cardinal fans had 011
hand for the institution up the prune
belt.
The team of Charlie Austin's which
faced Stanford's varsity last Saturday
was probably the best rugby team
that has ever been put together in
California. At least, it worked better
as a lightning scoring machine. Some
I fans think it could have beaten any
| team that California or Stanford has
j ever mustered.
| It Was si Itlpr Game.
Saturday's game was a Big Game
from a rugger's point of view. The
Santa Clarans demonstrated that,
whatever they may have been past
masters of, their present mastery of
the clean, open game of rugby is al
most perfect. With their speed and
accuracy they put a new note into the
game of rugby Saturday.
The problem before Stanford rugby
players is how to equal the skill of
the Santa Clara players by the next
Big Game and in Big Games to come.
The Missionites have proven that
they are worthy competitors, and have
put the Cardinal on the defense.
They have shown that Stanford has
an annual" problem to get the rugby
championship of this country. The
result of Saturday's contest is suf
ficient to convince skeptical ones that
the present Big Game is a Big Game
in every way.
A Victory for Rugby.
The Mission Town University de
serves credit for rising to the situa
tion as it has, and placing itself in
the big university caliber in so short
a time. The victory it scored Satur
day, though a blow to Cardinal dignity
and supremacy, was a victory for
! rugby in America.
