# Council Suspends Students
## 
### 
Two men have been suspended from
the University by tbe Men's Student
Council until the fall semester, 1917.
The first student, an upperclassman,
was disciplined for flagrant cheating
in connection with laboratory reports,
and the second, a junior student, was
guilty of thefts in the University
community.
The action was taken October 29,
but was given out for the first time
