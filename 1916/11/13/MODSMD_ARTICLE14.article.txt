# UNWHOLESOME DIET
## 
### 
Two thousand years ago, in Grecian
days, professional mourners were
hired to add their wails to funeral of
flciations. Stanford needs none.
Napoleon's chagrin at Waterloo lias
been re-enacted. Following Satur
day's flood, the chief enjoyment af
forded campus residents seems to lie
in laughing at the all pervading sight
of listless pain—the same look found
in a canine's eyes when undeservedly
whipped. Yet when all has been said
and done, a few evident truths and
some satisfaction may be derived
from the late defeat.
♦ * * *
It is impossible to underestimate
the beneficial effects of the bombast
ing, despite the distastefulness. After
annexing the majority of points for
so long, Stanford has grown a bit sur
feited, content to rest placidly on its
oars in self-admiration. Excess of
victories lias been an unwholesome
diet for Stanford Spirit. The defeat
cannot but result in a better unity
and cohesion of conflicting elements.
Paucity of candidates for football
honors and mild bleacher support
will not undermine the coming fall.
Something remains which must be
wiped off the slate, a fact that will
transform the future.

That cheerful bugaboo of intercol
legiate competition for Cardinal foot
ball teams has passed to the Great
Beyond, leaving not a vestige of the
former complaint bemoaning the lack
of a rival which might offer decent
competition. Such gabble is suicide,
the pendulum having swung to the
other extreme.

As for the Stanford varsity, one
can have nothing but \v r ords of praise
—sympathy is unnecessary. Eighteen
ruggers fought with all the determ
ination and courage possible, but
they stopped at the wrong house to
peddle their goods. Basketball, crew,
track and baseball are on the athletic
horizon—Up and at 'em!
