# Chimes Time and Tune Off
## 
### 
Stanford's supposedly depend
able chimes were two and a half
minutes off this morning, thereby
messing up the schedule of
classes considerably. Their tune
being so nearly that of "How Dry
I Am," it is suggested by frequent
week-end rioters that that tune
lie adopted.
Probably those taking the
change in the campus time-keeper
most seriously are those of the
"500" who found lock-outs hang
ing over their heads at 10:30 last
night.
