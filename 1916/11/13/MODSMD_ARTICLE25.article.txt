Professor C. B. Bradley of Cali
fornia, aided by two other California
professors, has succeeded in plotting
the modulations of the human voice,
by means of the wave lengths. The
scientific world has long been looking
for a discovery of this kind, as it will
greatly facilitate the teaching of
deaf-mutes to talk, and the speaking
of Oriental languages.
