# STANFORD BACKS BOTANY WORK
## 
### 
Professor Le√üoy Abrams, of the
Botany department of this University,
is preparing to undertake publication :
of a complete and authoritative "11- |
lustrated Flora of the Pacific Coast," j
a work of four volumes, which will
take about eight years to complete.
The work will contain illustrations
and descriptions of all species of
ferns and flowering plants, including
trees and shrubs, of the coast, the il
lustrations numbering in all about
6,000.
Professor Abrams will have asso
ciated with him in this work. Dr.
Nathaniel Lord Britton, formerly pro
fessor at Columbia, and co-author
with Addison Brown of the standard
"Illustrated Flora of the Northern
United States, Canada, and the British
Possessions." Dr. Britton will con
tribute funds for about half of the
drawings.
The trustees of the University, upon
the recommendation of President
Wilbur, have made this undertaking
possible by appropriating money to
meet the expenses from year to year.
This is the first time that the Univer
sity has backed a publication in this
manner.
Stanford has just come into posses
sion of the finest and most complete
collection of botanical specimens of
Southern California in existence. This
is the herbarium of Mr. S. B. Parish
of San Bernardino. Mr. Parish, who
is now 77 years old, has been collect
ing the plants of the southern part
of the stae during his whole adult
life, and since he was eager that his
collection should remain in Califor
nia, the University was enabled to ac
quire it for $0,000, although lie could
have obtained two or three times that
amount at least by offering it for sale !
in the east.
The collection compries about 50,-
000 specimens gathered and identi
fied by this recognized authority of
Southern California flora. The herb
arium is notable and particularly val
uable since it contains "authentic
specimens," that is, those used by the
eminent botanists, Gray and Watson,
in describing species in their stand
ard works.
Stanford already has a very fine
collection in the "Dudley Herbarium,"
which has been enlarged and supple
mented by members of the Botany
department, and this will enrich the
representation of Southern California
plant life contained in the new ac
quisition.
