# CARDINAL LOSES TO BETTER TEAM
## Missionites Take Big Game With 28 to 5 Count 
### N.H. Petree, '19 
Outplayed in every department of
the game, except kicking, Stanford
varsity went down to defeat at the
hands of the University of Santa Clara
rugby fifteen Saturday in the 191(5
Big Game. Eighty minutes of the
best football displayed in an intercol
legiate contest for the past few years
ended with the Mission Town team
on the long end of a 2S to 5 score.
The Best Team Won.
All critics, the captain, coach, and
trainer of the losing team, and a ma
jority of the rooters left Ewing Field
feeling that the best team had won
the day. Santa Clara played with a
perfect teamwork that spoke well for
the coaching of Charlie Austin, and
had the Cardinal on the defense dur
ing a greater part of the game, and
never were in danger after the first
few minutes.
l.anre Crowd Mtenris.
The game was played before a
crowd that was equally as large as
that of last year. The stands were
evenly divided between Stanford and
Santa Clara sympathizers, and the
rooting across the turf aroused en
thusiasm in the most skeptical of but
partially interested spectators. The
Big Game stunts were very tame, as
were the bleachers specialties. The
Stanford block "S" looked more like
a Yah-Hoo bird than the ninteenth
letter of the alphabet that was sup
posed to put fear into the hearts of
the opposing rooters.
Lnhciiiiinil Goes Over.
At 3 o'clock the game was started
by Referee Amos Elliott. "Dink"
Templeton kicked off, Stanford hav
ing won the toss but taking the side
facing the sun. The ball was played
about in the midtield, each side start
ing short rushes. After three minutes

Laclimund secured the sphere and
dashed forty yards for the only Card
inal try. Templeton converted from
an easy angle.
Injured Doing Well.
From then on the game was in
Santa Clara's favor, although Stan- '
ford fought gamely to hold her own.
The Cardinal was put on the defense
by the splendid work of the Mission
town forwards, aided by some excel
lent passing in the backfield. An in-;
jury list, that ended only when the j
limited number of substitutes were
added to the lineup of both teams,
was started early in tlu contest. Diaz
was removed to a hospital, when it ;
was discovered that he had a slight
concussion of the brain, received
when he was tackled near the Stan- j
ford goal line. The other men to be
taken out on account of injuries were
Wark, Walker and Single of Stanford,
and Winston and Howell of Santa
Clara. All of the players are getting
along well now.
Santa Clara's First Try.
Santa Clara's first try came as a j
result of a sixty yard passing rush,
Scholtz to Fowler to Berndt to Mul
doon to Fowler. The speedy first
five went over the line for a clean
score. Fitzpatrick failed to convert.
During the next fifteen minutes,
both teams played the hardest and
most even rugby of the game. The
play surged up and down the field, ;
with the scrums battling for the pos
session of the ball. Winston and Cur
tin stood out prominently for the
Catholic College fifteen, while Pettin
gill, Wilkins and Wark showed the
most for Stanford.
Good lick Blocked.
From a lineout in midfield, Scholtz
secured the pigskin, and transferred
to Howell. Howell in turn passed to

Curtin, who went over for Santa
Clara's second score. This tally
seemed to turn the tide, and strange
to say, it was made on a play that
was not legitimate. The refereeing
of Amos Elliott was good in the main,
but the pass from Howell to Curtin,
in the rush that ended in the try just
mentioned, was at least five feet for
ward. Fitzpatrick's kick for the goal
was blocked.
Forwards Failed to Get Ball.
Two more unconverted trys were
made by Santa Clara before the
timer's gun ended the first half. Stan
ford played desperately, but seemed
outclassed. The forwards failed ut
terly to get the ball to the backfield.
and when by some piece of good for
tune, one of the Cardinal speedsters
did get the ball, he was quickly
smothered by the heavy tackling Santa
Clara backs. Lachmund was a mark
ed man, and was of little use to his
team in offensive play after his first
sensational run. Receiving a pass
from Srholtz, Berndt tore to within
fifteen yards of the opponents' goal,
where he passed to Hickey; Walker
of Stanford attempted to save with a
boot to touch. Milburn intercepted
and scampered over for the third
marker. Fitzpatrick again failed from
an easy angle.
Loose Plnyinir.
Loose playing featured the re
mainder of the first period, the scrums
being in the limelight. Pettingill and
Braden were always on the ball for
Stanford, while Don, Hickey, Muldoon
and Winston advanced the ball for
the Red and White. From a lineout,
Berndt kicked into the loose. Win
ston scooped the ball and tore for the
white line. Passing Templeton, he
registered another try. Bensberg
failed to convert this score, the half
eliding with Santa Clara on the long
end of a 12 to 5 count.
Stanford Tries Come-Hack.
Stanford started the second half
with a rush and looked due for a
comeback. The backfield ran the ball
to Santa Clara's ten yard line, but
were sent back on a penalty kick to
the Missionites. Bensberg and Tem
pleton engaged in a punting duel, with
the honors going to the latter. Long
made a wild pass to Walker, Le Ber
veau intercepting sent the ball back
to Templeton, who was forced to
touch on the Cardinal five yard line.
From a scrum, Rudy Scholtz shot
over the line. Bensberg failed to
plant the ball between the posts.
Missionite Score Grows.
Although Stanford seemed to take
a new lease on the game, and drove
the heavy scrum of their opponents
back. Santa Clara continued to pile
up the score. Scholtz passed to Fitz
patrick in midfleld. The center
three ran twenty yards, and shot the
ball to Milburn, who went over for
another score. Bensberg converted
this try, the first time that the extra
two points were added.
Two more scores were made by the
winning fifteen, Fitzpatrick and Korte
touching the ball down. Muldoon
went over for a try, but lost the ball
when Charlie Long dove for a feature
tackle. One of the final scores was
converted by Bensberg, bringing the
count up to 28. Stanford failed to

roach the Santa Clara goal line after
their initial effort and ended the game
with 5 points.
Teinpleton's Boots Help.
Superior in the things that counted
for tallys, the Santa Clara team com
pletely overwhelmed Stanford during
a greater part of the contest. At
times, generally aided hy "Dink"
Templetori's long boots, the Cardinal
advanced the ball into the danger
zone, but lacked the punch to carry it
over. The game was an exact repeti
tion of last year's Big Game, only the
teams were reversed.
Austin has developed a wonderful
combination this season. He had a
veteran fifteen to start the football
year with, while Stanford has been
unfortunate in the number of veter
ans out, and in injuries. Danny Car
roll's loss was the big depressing ele
ment that helped defeat the Cardinal,
but even with Danny in the game and
going at his best, the Mission Town
fifteen would have won. The team was
better, and clearly showed that Santa
Clara was a worthy competitor of
Stanford.
Rugby Given Boost.
Rugby interest could not have been
helped more than by the result of
Saturday's game. Enthusiasm will
run high next season, and the Big
Game will be a real Big Game, at
tended by a monster crowd of real
football "dyed in the wool" rooters,
and the season at Stanford will be fea
tured by an increased number of men
out, and consequently a better team.
