# Campus Is Scene of Election Tragedyâ€”Bill Bets on Hughes and Spills the Beans at P.O.
## 
### 
If Charles Evans Hughes is a
has-been, "Hill" Fundenberg, '19,
is a has-been. Hefore the elec
tion, Hill had the Hughes boom
in bis bean. Hill wouldn't have
given a hill of beans to see Wil
son elected. He imparted this
sentiment to a Wilsonite.
Today Bill braved the chilly
winds and glances of the campus
at the postoffice steps for two
hours, not for the mail. Bill was
counting beans, and the number
of beans he dropped into the
bucket would make Wilson's
plurality in the solid south look
meager. At 11:10 Hill threw his
55,000 th bean in the pail. At
11:15 Hill lost count and had to
begin again. Hill's next bet will
be a sure-thing or at least it will
involve no mention of beans.
