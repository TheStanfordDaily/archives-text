# S.F. Citizens Thought They Were Seeing Things When Yah-hoo Flew by on Ford
## 
### 
Many San Franciscans thought
they "had 'em again," when they
saw tiie big Stanford Ya-Hoo bird
go sailing through the streets
aboard a Ford auto-truck on its
way to the warehouse near Mar
| ket street. The Ya-Hoo was ac-
I companied by a guard of some 120
j or 30 howling Stanford men,
whose watchword was "stay by
the bird."
The boys had to get out and
push a couple of times on the
steep hills, but the Ya-Hoo reach
ed its destination safely in spite
I of the Santa Clara menace. Some
Cardinal fans wish the Mission
it.es had captured the Ya-Hoo, or
that it had been dumped in the
bay.
