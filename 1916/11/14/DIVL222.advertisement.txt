THE BIG GAME BET
"Now that bet's paid,' said Co-Edna, coming
out of Wilson's, "I enjoyed it. Betting's not so bad
after all."
It all depends on the bet.
"Yod see, when you bet a Wilson special it
makes no difference whether you win or lose,
because you enjoy it either way. If you win there's
nothing you'd rather get—if you lose there's nothing
you'd rather give—than a treat at Wilson's."
