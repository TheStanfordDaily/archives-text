# WOW! RUGBY IS IN DUTCH WITH THE CALL
## ALAS POOR STANFORD Ye Sport Ed. Suffers an Idea and Springs It Four Columns Worth 
### 
"Alas, jioor Stanford." That's what
the Call sporting editor says. Stan
lord doesn't know how bad off she is,
so the Call Sporting Ed. takes half
a page to tell us about it.
The Call says "rugby made its last
gasp when' Santa Clara defeated Stan
ford 2S to 5," and that "Stanford will
abandon the imported game." From
his busy desk, the Call man seems
to have stumbled on a lot of advance
information that even President Wil
bur doesn't know about.
Call Sense of llnmor.
The Call man has a peculiar sense
of humor. He goes back into ancient
history of 1893, before the war, and
calls a lot of the old boys by -their
first names, arid * says we ought to
show the same old spirit they did. He
says we'd quit playing rugby now that
we've been licked by Santa Clara. The
Call man thinks that would be "Stan
ford spirit," but of course he doesn't
know any better —he's judging by an
other college be's more partial to.
Knew First Names.
Says the Call man: "In the old
days every Stanford fellow 011 the
squad knew every other fellow. It
was 'Hello, Tom, Dick, or Harry.'
Every one knew the other one by his
first name and called him by it." The
Call man, somehow, lias acquired the
idea that Stanford ruggers so onto
| the field for practice with, "Good af
ternoon, Professor Brown," or "Greet
ings, Doctor liraden," or "Au revoir,
Mister Carroll." The Call man ought
to stir himself from his soft seat
once or twice'a year, and come down
to the Farm to get an ear-full of
modern pet names, like "Swede,"
"Danny," "Dink," .Joe, and as many
more as there are men on the squad.
Owing to rugby, according to the
Call man, "few Stanford students
know the others by their first names
now." He says we don't have any
good fellowship, and that "there is
no visiting at fraternity houses." The
Call man has a keen imagination,
even if he does show poor logic.
Women Won Rugby.
He says that Doctor Wilbur rounded
up all the women at Stanford and
";:ot" them to vote for rugby. He
blames the "500" for putting rugby
over and says"the girls are respon
sible for it." The Call man in one
breath says that rugby is rougher
than American, while in an other he
charges that the Stanford "500" voted
for it because they did not want hand
some Stanford men mussed up by the
rough American game. Again ho
says: "Neither sport is for weaklings,
and one is as dangerous as the other."
The Call man thinks the teams Sat
urday at Ewing Field "went about
their work in a slipshod, listless man
ner, which must have convinced Dr.
Wilbur that their hearts were not in
their play." Most people thought
Charlie Austin's .speed demons were
anything but listless and Slipshod, and
the Call man would know, if he had j
a correspondent, as other papers do. I
that President Wilbur was in the
eas-t, Saturday, attending the conven-'
tion of University presidents at Wor- i
cester. Maybe (lie Call man was just j
telling Dr. Wilbur, for fear that some
one around here wouldn't do it.
Dr. Wilbur a Sport ?
The Cull man thinks President Wil
bur ought to be ashamed of himself.
"How would President Wilbur like to
look back upon the time he was a
famous shotputter for the Cardinal?"
he asks. The Call man thinks that
Dr. Wilbur of those days M'as a real
sport, but now he charges the Presi
dent with slipping things over by in
fluencing (he co-eds' sympathies. The
Call man doesn't know Dr. Wilbur —
he ought to come down and lalk to
Stanford's "Proxy" for ten or fifteen
minutes, some time. Then watch (lie
Call's sporting page.
Alas, poor Call man! He thinks he's
done something for American foot
ball. But he doesn't know Stanford
men, of now, or of the past. He must
think they have soup in their veins
instead of red blood, and that fhelr
brains are in their legs instead of
their heads. He's judging Stanford
men by a few professional athletes
he's met up in his office. It's a shame
to hurt his feelings but the Call man
ought to be told 011 the quiet that out
side of the game Saturday, his ar
ticle on the sporting page lins done,
more to cinch rugby at Stanford than
anything sincc President Wilbur's of
ficial statement.

Charlie Austin's .speed demons were
anything but listless and Slipshod, and
the Call man would know, if he had j
a correspondent, as other papers do. I
that President Wilbur was in the
eas-t, Saturday, attending the conven-'
tion of University presidents at Wor- i
cester. Maybe (lie Call man was just j
telling Dr. Wilbur, for fear that some
one around here wouldn't do it.
Dr. Wilbur a Sport ?
The Cull man thinks President Wil
bur ought to be ashamed of himself.
"How would President Wilbur like to
look back upon the time he was a
famous shotputter for the Cardinal?"
he asks. The Call man thinks that
Dr. Wilbur of those days M'as a real
sport, but now he charges the Presi
dent with slipping things over by in
fluencing (he co-eds' sympathies. The
Call man doesn't know Dr. Wilbur —
he ought to come down and lalk to
Stanford's "Proxy" for ten or fifteen
minutes, some time. Then watch (lie
Call's sporting page.
Alas, poor Call man! He thinks he's
done something for American foot
ball. But he doesn't know Stanford
men, of now, or of the past. He must
think they have soup in their veins
instead of red blood, and that fhelr
brains are in their legs instead of
their heads. He's judging Stanford
men by a few professional athletes
he's met up in his office. It's a shame
to hurt his feelings but the Call man
ought to be told 011 the quiet that out
side of the game Saturday, his ar
ticle on the sporting page lins done,
more to cinch rugby at Stanford than
anything sincc President Wilbur's of
ficial statement.
"Alas, jioor Stanford." That's what
the Call sporting editor says. Stan
lord doesn't know how bad off she is,
so the Call Sporting Ed. takes half
a page to tell us about it.
The Call says "rugby made its last
gasp when' Santa Clara defeated Stan
ford 2S to 5," and that "Stanford will
abandon the imported game." From
his busy desk, the Call man seems
to have stumbled on a lot of advance
information that even President Wil
bur doesn't know about.
Call Sense of llnmor.
The Call man has a peculiar sense
of humor. He goes back into ancient
history of 1893, before the war, and
calls a lot of the old boys by -their
first names, arid * says we ought to
show the same old spirit they did. He
says we'd quit playing rugby now that
we've been licked by Santa Clara. The
Call man thinks that would be "Stan
ford spirit," but of course he doesn't
know any better —he's judging by an
other college be's more partial to.
Knew First Names.
Says the Call man: "In the old
days every Stanford fellow 011 the
squad knew every other fellow. It
was 'Hello, Tom, Dick, or Harry.'
Every one knew the other one by his
first name and called him by it." The
Call man, somehow, lias acquired the
idea that Stanford ruggers so onto
| the field for practice with, "Good af
ternoon, Professor Brown," or "Greet
ings, Doctor liraden," or "Au revoir,
Mister Carroll." The Call man ought
to stir himself from his soft seat
once or twice'a year, and come down
to the Farm to get an ear-full of
modern pet names, like "Swede,"
"Danny," "Dink," .Joe, and as many
more as there are men on the squad.
Owing to rugby, according to the
Call man, "few Stanford students
know the others by their first names
now." He says we don't have any
good fellowship, and that "there is
no visiting at fraternity houses." The
Call man has a keen imagination,
even if he does show poor logic.
Women Won Rugby.
He says that Doctor Wilbur rounded
up all the women at Stanford and
";:ot" them to vote for rugby. He
blames the "500" for putting rugby
over and says"the girls are respon
sible for it." The Call man in one
breath says that rugby is rougher
than American, while in an other he
charges that the Stanford "500" voted
for it because they did not want hand
some Stanford men mussed up by the
rough American game. Again ho
says: "Neither sport is for weaklings,
and one is as dangerous as the other."
The Call man thinks the teams Sat
urday at Ewing Field "went about
their work in a slipshod, listless man
ner, which must have convinced Dr.
Wilbur that their hearts were not in
their play." Most people thought
Charlie Austin's .speed demons were
anything but listless and Slipshod, and

first name and called him by it." The
Call man, somehow, lias acquired the
idea that Stanford ruggers so onto
| the field for practice with, "Good af
ternoon, Professor Brown," or "Greet
ings, Doctor liraden," or "Au revoir,
Mister Carroll." The Call man ought
to stir himself from his soft seat
once or twice'a year, and come down
to the Farm to get an ear-full of
modern pet names, like "Swede,"
"Danny," "Dink," .Joe, and as many
more as there are men on the squad.
Owing to rugby, according to the
Call man, "few Stanford students
know the others by their first names
now." He says we don't have any
good fellowship, and that "there is
no visiting at fraternity houses." The
Call man has a keen imagination,
even if he does show poor logic.
Women Won Rugby.
He says that Doctor Wilbur rounded
up all the women at Stanford and
";:ot" them to vote for rugby. He
blames the "500" for putting rugby
over and says"the girls are respon
sible for it." The Call man in one
breath says that rugby is rougher
than American, while in an other he
charges that the Stanford "500" voted
for it because they did not want hand
some Stanford men mussed up by the
rough American game. Again ho
says: "Neither sport is for weaklings,
and one is as dangerous as the other."
The Call man thinks the teams Sat
urday at Ewing Field "went about
their work in a slipshod, listless man
ner, which must have convinced Dr.
Wilbur that their hearts were not in
their play." Most people thought
Charlie Austin's .speed demons were
anything but listless and Slipshod, and
the Call man would know, if he had j
a correspondent, as other papers do. I
that President Wilbur was in the
eas-t, Saturday, attending the conven-'
tion of University presidents at Wor- i
cester. Maybe (lie Call man was just j
telling Dr. Wilbur, for fear that some
one around here wouldn't do it.
Dr. Wilbur a Sport ?
The Cull man thinks President Wil
bur ought to be ashamed of himself.
"How would President Wilbur like to
look back upon the time he was a
famous shotputter for the Cardinal?"
he asks. The Call man thinks that
Dr. Wilbur of those days M'as a real
sport, but now he charges the Presi
dent with slipping things over by in
fluencing (he co-eds' sympathies. The
Call man doesn't know Dr. Wilbur —
he ought to come down and lalk to
Stanford's "Proxy" for ten or fifteen
minutes, some time. Then watch (lie
Call's sporting page.
Alas, poor Call man! He thinks he's
done something for American foot
ball. But he doesn't know Stanford
men, of now, or of the past. He must
think they have soup in their veins
instead of red blood, and that fhelr
brains are in their legs instead of
their heads. He's judging Stanford
men by a few professional athletes
he's met up in his office. It's a shame
to hurt his feelings but the Call man
ought to be told 011 the quiet that out
side of the game Saturday, his ar
ticle on the sporting page lins done,
more to cinch rugby at Stanford than
anything sincc President Wilbur's of
ficial statement.
