## Professor E.C. Franklin Will Show Phenomena in Little Theatre Tonight 
### 
Professor E. C. Franklin of the
Chemistry department will lecture in
the Little Theater tonight on "Liquid
Air." Many interesting demonstra
tions will he given with the talk
showing the unusual properties of air
in this state.
Professor Franklin's demonstrations
include treating meat with liquid air,
then pulverizing it between the
fingers; boiling the air by treating it
with ice, and other phenomena that
seem almost impossible to the lay
man.
The lecture is the first in a series
