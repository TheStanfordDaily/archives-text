# STANFORD ATTACKED
## 
### 
Marvellous to behold, the San Fran
cisco Call has installed the American
same of football at Stanford Univer
sity, simultaneously .sounding the
death-knell of Rugby. One wonders
how they accomplished this feat —
yet when carefully perusing the mo
mentous article it is pleasing to note
the substitution was performed
single-handed by a sporting writer,
without even consulting Stanford.
Surely there is nothing so delightful
as having some well-informed, unob
trusive friend aid in running one's
affairs. Dr. Wilbur is hastening back
to the campus in order to relinquish
the reins to the producer of the ab
normal eruption which easily sur
passes the standard set by Baron von
Munchausen or Mother Goose's tales.

The task of assembling such con
coctions of hyperboles and falsehoods
leads one to believe the writer has
missed his vocation, since any individ
ual with such an imagination should
draw down more than the weekly sti
pend 011 a sporting editor's desk if he
would favor The Saturday Evening
Post. Nevertheless the inference is
exceedingly plain that every effort is
being made to force Stanford into
adopting the Old Game. Far be it
from The Daily Palo Alto to mention
who is directing the steam roller.

Omitting a discussion as to the mer
its of the two games, since adherents
of both admit likeable features in the
other, suppose for a brief moment a
few of the absurdities that have been
boldly llung to the world as truth be
re-numerated. Stanford spirit van
ished, as evidenced by the failure of
visiting in fraternity houses; ignor
ance of nick-names on the football
squad, and finally inhibition existent
at rallies, are listed as evils of rugby.
Without offering a grain of substan
tiation, knowing such an attempt
would be fatal, fluid gobs of spurious
chatter, highly amusing in character,
arc generously doled out to the pub
lic by the yard. Furthermore the
sage critic bemoans the slipshod, list
less play of the Stanford varsity, and
in the same breath speaks with hor
ror of the injured men wearing the
Cardinal. On account of the tradition
at stake, Stanford spirit would be im
proved by adopting American football,
since the defeat by Santa Clara, is the
writer's opinion.

The author of the drivel continues
by adding that a total vote of about

fiOO was cast at the football election
last semester, when but slight effort
would have permitted him to find
that 840 votes were cast. Then the
rash statement is made that the
women students carried the day for
the supporters of the English game,
despite the fact that not even the
election officials knew or could have
secured any knowledge as to how the
feminine vote loaned. However, the
Call lias graciously condescended to
take the position of the Almighty, and
lias determined the character of this
balloting.

To cap the climax, the worthy
newspaper without a moment's warn
ing, in tearful complaint requests its
readers to look back en the time
when Doctor Wilbur was a famous
shot-putter, etc. The Daily Palo Alto
is forced to award the prize to the
Call for originating the best joke that
has invaded the campus for many a
day. President Wilbur never donned
a track uniform in his undergraduate
life. Before closing, The Daily Palo
Alto would like to extend its compli
ments to the embryonic sporting writer
for the masterful article which is
bound to transform the football world.
