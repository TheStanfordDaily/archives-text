YOU NEVER CAN TELL.
Scone 1 is a campus bedroom.
Freddie and Teddie are checking up
their Kin Game expenditures.
Fred —Got it yet?
Ted —Yeh. ..
Fred—Then shoot.
Ted —Forty-three dollars, forty
cents.
Fred —Good Lord, man! On who?
Ted —Gladys. How much were you
cleaned?
Fred —Four-seventy-five, outside of
tickets.
Ted —You weren't cleaned. That's
just a spot-and-press. It was Helena,
wasnt it?
Fred —Yes. Glad must have had a
joy time on $43.
Ted—l should say so. She raved
all evening.
Fred —I'm not so sure about Helena;
we just did three things—the game,
dinner at Taits, and danced after
ward. I sure enjoyed it. All I can do
is hope that she did.
Ted —I can't say as I felt so happy.
The pressure was awful.
Fred —Yes, they ?ay that when one
gets submerged deep it's hard on the
ears.
Tod —Guess that's why I couldn't
hear the waiter praise the cream
chicken.
Scene II is another campus hed
room. Gladys and Helena are talking
it over.
Gladys—Oh, it wasn't as bad as all
that! But he's a pill! Spent money
like a fish and nothing to show for it!
Helena —I thought you liked Ted.
Gladys—Oh, he's a convenient meal
and-theater ticket. But as a man he's
deficient. Did you enjoy yourself?
Helena—Uh huh! Freddie certainly
knows how to handle women. We
breezed into Tait's after the game,
and had a regular party. He's a dead
game sport. I sure have to hand it
to him for giving a girl a good time.
Gladys—That's lovely. But Tod
spends a lot. He rolls in paper.
Helena—Yes, very likely wheat
straw.
