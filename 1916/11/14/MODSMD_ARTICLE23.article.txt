# California Notes
## 
### 
On account of tlie small sale of stu
dent tickets sold to the California-
Washington game, the California
graduate manager has opened to the
public an entire new section of seats
more than was intended. The U. C.
students are not buying Big Game
tickets as rapidly as was expectcd.
The St. Mary's game was only a
practice for the University of Cali
fornia varsity, last Saturday, the final
score being 48 to 6. The U. C. men
j had little trouble and exhibited form
I that will make Washington extend
themselves to win next Saturday.
Nine men have been named at Cali
fornia as the varsity basketball squad.
Five more will be added after the
Washington game, when football men
will lie released.
The repainting of the big "C" of
California about this time of the year
has become an annual event. One
hundred and fifty sophomores went
up Saturday morning and gave the
"C" a coat of gold paint and the
women of the class served buns, hot
dogs, and coffee, for the workers.
