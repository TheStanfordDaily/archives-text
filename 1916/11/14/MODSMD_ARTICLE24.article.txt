# Greatest Sale in History for Yale-Harvard Classic
## 
### 
Sixty-nine thousand seats are not
enough for the Yale and Harvard men
who wish to witness their Big
Game. With the contest two weeks
off 100,000 seats have already been
applied for, which means that over
31,000 fans are going to be denied ad
mittance to the greatest of all grid
iron battles. To carry the crowds to
the game, sixteen trains will run from
New York City, four from Boston and
five from Hartford.
