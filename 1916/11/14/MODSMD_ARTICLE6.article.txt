# Fund Given Marx to Aid Gear Research
## 
### 
Professor (luido Marx and Lawrence
E. Cutter. '0(>. both of the Engineer
ing department, will have the benefit
of a fund which will allow them to
continue their experiments with gear
ing teeth.
Professor Marx has been experi
menting with gear teeth for the past
twenty years, and has been assisted
by Cutter since the latter was an up
perclassman in the Engineering de
partment. The aim is to And better
and more efficient methods of gear
ins.
The fund, which will aid Professor
Marx, is the only one made from the
foundation of Ambrose Swasey, the
noted eastern manufacturer and en
gineer, which was placed under the
auspices of the national engineering
societies of the country. A number
of other funds have been considered
by the Swasey foundation but have
not been granted. The whole fund
has now been turned over to the Na
tional Research Council.
A number of manufacturers of the
country who are keenly interested in
Professor Marx's experiments have
agreed to cooperate and aid him with
both equipment and funds. Professor
Marx states that his experiments can
now be carried on indefinitely, until
he discovers the best methods of
handling gearing.
