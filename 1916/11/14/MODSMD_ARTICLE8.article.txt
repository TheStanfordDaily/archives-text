# INTIMIDATING LETTER SENT BY FANATIC
## THREATENS EASTMAN Ambulance Men Had Better Stay in "Stanford's University" Than "Go to War" 
### 
That J. H. Eastman, 'IS, had much j
better stay in "Stanford's University" j
than go to France to drive an am
bulance in the French Relief Service
is the ultimatum conveyed in an un
signed letter received by Eastman
from a writer in San Francisco. The
letter follows:
"Mr. J. H. Eastman:
"You had better stay in Stan
ford's University instead of fight
ing for an uncivilized Country
like Russia, France or England.
Read what young Mr. Akard says
about Nigger Frenchmen. What
they done to German wounded
Soldiers; cut their Heads off!
What ilo you celebrate the Battle
of Bunker Hill for. England and 1
France are our Enemies. They
fought us in War. Go to the Na
tional Cemetery in San Francisco.
You will find no Russian, Italian,
French or English United States
Soldiers there, but you will find
! 1000 German-American Soldiers
sleeping there. Washington will
return if you go!
N. B. Every one of you is going
to lie reported to the German Gov
ernment â€”if you are caught.
Good bye!
'N. B. Leland Stanford would
close up his University (if he was
alive) today when lie would see
you and your Gang."
One Hundred Want to Go.
The writer of the letter undoubtedly
heard of the plan of sending a number
of Stanford students to France to as
sist in the American Red Cross Ser
vice, for lie addressed the letter to
J. H. Eastman, Junior Student, Palo
Alto, Stanford University. In the ar
ticles in the San Francisco papers,
Eastman, who has had charge of the
recruiting on the campus, was refer
red to as a junior. One hundred stu
dents recently signified their inten
tions of wanting to assist in the re
lief work. The proposition is now up
to the financial supporters who prom
ised the money for the expedition.
I'lan Xot Yet Definite*
At the time the plan was put up to
the students, it was made clear that
the proposition was purely of a ten
tative nature and that nothing definite
had been decided.
That the letter received by Eastman
will fail of its purpose of frightening
the men who want to go to France
was made evident today when the
missive provoked nothing but mirth
among the prospective ambulance
drivers. That the writer is from Ger
many is made doubly evident by his
practice of capitalizing all nouns.
