### 
Two Stanford debating teams clash
with two trios from California this
evening in an intercollegiate inter
society forensic contest. A large
crowd is anticipated at the Nestoria-
Congress debate in room 12, the large
Law lecture room, on the Stanford
campus, this evening at 8. While this
contest is taking place here, squads
representing Euphronia and the Senate
society of the State University will
take the platform on the Berkeley
campus.
Eight-Hour Question.
Right-hour legislation is the general
topic of the debate, and the specific
question, which follows, is timely in
interest: "Resolved, That the Federal
Congress was justified in passing the
Adamson eight-hour law."
Eat Then Debate.
M. B. Hanna, '16, H. H. Hoss, *18,

C. Congress will be L. A. Clearv, '18,
