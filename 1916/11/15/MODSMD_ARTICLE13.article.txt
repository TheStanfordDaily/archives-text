# LONG RUN IS ON PROGRAM FOR FRIDAY
## EXPECT CLOSE RACE Cross Country Event Is First Competition Against California 
### 
Stanford's first Intercollegiate com
petition against the University of Cali
fornia this year will come Friday,
when representatives of both institu
tions will compete in a four-mile
cross-country run, which will be
staged on the campus and in the vi
cinity. This is also the first time
that a cross-country meet has ever
been held between the two schools.
Start at I'ostoffice.
A. D. Griffin, '17, captain of the
cross-country team, made a tour of
the country surrounding the campus
today, in an attempt to map out the
course, which will consist of two
miles on fiat country and two miles
across the hills. The race will start
at the postoffice and will extend into
the hills, finishing at the boathouse,
which will afford spectators an ex
ceptional opportunity to view a large
portion of the stretch loading up to the
finish.
Samis Not Eligible.
Stanford will be handicapped to a
certain extent by the ineligibility of
Milton F. Samis, '20, who won the in
terclass cross-country meet recently.
Freshmen are not permitted to com
pete. California's best time in the
recent interclass meet held at the
Berkeley school was 24:51 for a four
mile course, while Samis covered four
and one-half miles in 27:03.05. A
comparison of these times would in
dicate that a close contest is in store
for spectators of the race.
