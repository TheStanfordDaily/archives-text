Parentis Complain About
Oregon's Bonfire.
Strenuous parental objections have
been nmde to the authorities of the
University of Oregon against the con
tinuance of the freshmen bonfire. The
expense and time involved by both
men and women in the erection of a
pyre twice a year is the basis of the
parents' complaint. No action has
been taken on the matter as yet, but
even if the custom is not abolished,
it is thought probable that the bon
fire will be limited in size.

"Fight* in Players.
According to Coach "Andy" Smith
of the Blue and Gold varsity, Califor
nia will have a fighting team in the
field against Washington next Satur
day. Although two-thirds of the sea

I the lack of knowledge of the American
game, it is expected that the Califor
nia pack will give a good account of
themselves.
