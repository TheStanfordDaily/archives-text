# Stantord Alumni in Oriental Outbreak
## E.H. Lock wood Writes and Depicts Life as Led in Canton China 
### 
Jii a letter received recently, E. H.
Lockwood, formerly secretary of the
Stanford Y. M. C. A., and now en
gaged in educational work in Can
ton, China, gives an interesting side
of the late outbreak in China. He
says that this last uprising has firmly
fixed the republican idea in the minds
of the Chinese. "China will always
remain a republic, now," writes Mr.
Lockwood.
He also tells of the peculiar tax of
levying two months' rent from all the
inhabitants of Canton, by the military
governor, to defray expenses of keep
ing soldiers in Canton, and of an Ori
ental assassination.
Mr. Lockwood's letter follows, in
part:
We are living in the midst of rice
fields on a hill outside of the city,
about twenty minutes launch ride dis
tant. We have here the beginning of
a colony which we expect to grow to
be predominantly American. On this
hill we now have four bungalows and
two large houses. We will also have
here the buildings of the Union Theo
logical Seminary. You will be inter
ested in this seminary, in which all
of the missionary bodies, except the
Southern Baptists, have united. This
is a sign of what is coming in the
mission field.
We occupy one of the bungalows,
and are very comfortable so far as
housing conditions are concerned.
Our house is screened against the
mosquitoes and the thousand different
| kinds of insects which inhabit the air
here. In spite of screens we get a
good many in the house. This time of
the year the sun comes up so early
that we must early to bed and early
to rise. There is no sleeping in this
country after the sun gets up over the
i horizon.
Tench Language All Day.
"Our days are much alike. Lang
uage study begins early in the morn
ing and continues, with a break for
lunch until 5 in the afternoon. Our
evenings are spent in reading or at
meetings which we are sometimes re
quired to attend.
"Many of our winter days are like
those of California. I do not think
that either Mrs. Lockwood nor I feel
as much vitality here as in America.
Canton I'nder Military Kule.
"As you say, for many months we
did not know whether China was to
become a monarchy or remain a re
public. As you know now, the ques
tion has been decided. Now I think
China will always remain a republic.
This history of the past months has
influenced her people so much that
now the republic idea is more than
ever firmly established. There were
a good many bombs thrown in the
city and for days we thought that
street fighting would break out. A
number of the enemies of the military
governor of Canton were assassinated
in a typical Oriental fashion at a con
ference of the factions.
Y. 31. C. A. Buildings Are Modem.
"Both of us are very glad to be
here. Our association is just com
pleting a building which I wish you
could see. It is as modern a build
ing as you will find in any city in
America, although not so large. It
has the best in the way of character
building equipment that the West can
offer the East.
"The moral blindness of the people
and consequent economic poverty, the
lack of friendships such as we would
have in America combine to make our
work difficult. Therefore we are
greatly in need of the prayers of
I hose interested in this country and
in us.
"EDWARD H. LOCKWOOD."
