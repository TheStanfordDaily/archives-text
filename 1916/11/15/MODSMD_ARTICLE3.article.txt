# Tal Has Big Idea Union Wants Lawn
## 
### 
Tal Smith, manager of the Union,
says the men of the campus are a
bashful league. Tal had a big idea a
couple of weeks ago, by which he
would have a Union Labor Day and
get all the members out to clean up
the grounds and plant blue grass seed.
Then Tal was going to have Chaplain
Gardner, the Y. M. C. A., and the Y.
W. C. A. pray for rain, and before the
campus could get "hep" to his plans
and make new paths across the Union
grounds, a lawn would come up, pro
vided the birds didn't get too familiar
with the seeds.
Tal thought that every healthy, able
bodied Union member would hit for
the nearest neighbor's house, and
freeze onto the first hoe or spade he
came to. Then all Tal would have
to do would be to get out there with
a couple of Catling guns and keep
the boys from tramping down the
newly dug up ground.
