# Tal Has Big Idea Union Wants Lawn
## 
### 
Tal Smith, manager of the Union,
says the men of the campus are a
bashful league. Tal had a big idea a
couple of weeks ago, by which he
would have a Union Labor Day and
get all the members out to clean up
the grounds and plant blue grass seed.
Then Tal was going to have Chaplain
Gardner, the Y. M. C. A., and the Y.
W. C. A. pray for rain, and before the
campus could get "hep" to his plans
and make new paths across the Union
grounds, a lawn would come up, pro
vided the birds didn't get too familiar
with the seeds.
Tal thought that every healthy, able
bodied Union member would hit for
the nearest neighbor's house, and
freeze onto the first hoe or spade he
came to. Then all Tal would have
to do would be to get out there with
a couple of Catling guns and keep
the boys from tramping down the
newly dug up ground.
However, the Union members were
| bashful. They didn't want to start
anything without being sure that it
was perfectly 0. K. It wouldn't be
I right to start in digging without hav
i ing Teddy Roosevelt, or Chancellor
Jordan, or Charlie Austin on hand to
turn over the first shovelful. So they
hesitate, while Tal makes arrange-
I ments.
It took Tal quite a while to get
next, but in that time he thought up
ja couple more ideas, which were good
J ones. In the first place, he talked
i the Union Hoard into contributing a
(hundred dollars to putin the lawn,
i Tal thinks he'll spend about ten dol
lars for seeds, eighty dollars for
poles and barb wire to make a fence,
and the rest for an electric chair in
which to put people who walk on
lawns before it's time for them to do
so.
Hie Other Idea.
The other idea is that members of
the Women's Club House stage feeds
for the boys who are digging in the
cold, cold ground, these feeds not to
come so often or last so long that the
boys forget about a spade being a
spade—to dig with. At the same time,
the Union members are to dig up the
ground around the Women's Club
House and plant a few million seeds
there.
Tal is going to set a day soon. He's
?oing to announce it better than Wash
ington ever announced the crossing of
the Delaware, and he expects the boys
to flock to the grounds armed with
spades and hoes just as though every
one of them was to be given a free
lassage to France to drive a Ford
imbulance. It's going to be the j
Union's labor day party, when there j
will be a great unearthing to putin :
the Union and Club House lawns.

turn over the first shovelful. So they
hesitate, while Tal makes arrange-
I ments.
It took Tal quite a while to get
next, but in that time he thought up
ja couple more ideas, which were good
J ones. In the first place, he talked
i the Union Hoard into contributing a
(hundred dollars to putin the lawn,
i Tal thinks he'll spend about ten dol
lars for seeds, eighty dollars for
poles and barb wire to make a fence,
and the rest for an electric chair in
which to put people who walk on
lawns before it's time for them to do
so.
Hie Other Idea.
The other idea is that members of
the Women's Club House stage feeds
for the boys who are digging in the
cold, cold ground, these feeds not to
come so often or last so long that the
boys forget about a spade being a
spade—to dig with. At the same time,
the Union members are to dig up the
ground around the Women's Club
House and plant a few million seeds
there.
Tal is going to set a day soon. He's
?oing to announce it better than Wash
ington ever announced the crossing of
the Delaware, and he expects the boys
to flock to the grounds armed with
spades and hoes just as though every
one of them was to be given a free
lassage to France to drive a Ford
imbulance. It's going to be the j
Union's labor day party, when there j
will be a great unearthing to putin :
the Union and Club House lawns.
Tal Smith, manager of the Union,
says the men of the campus are a
bashful league. Tal had a big idea a
couple of weeks ago, by which he
would have a Union Labor Day and
get all the members out to clean up
the grounds and plant blue grass seed.
Then Tal was going to have Chaplain
Gardner, the Y. M. C. A., and the Y.
W. C. A. pray for rain, and before the
campus could get "hep" to his plans
and make new paths across the Union
grounds, a lawn would come up, pro
vided the birds didn't get too familiar
with the seeds.
Tal thought that every healthy, able
bodied Union member would hit for
the nearest neighbor's house, and
freeze onto the first hoe or spade he
came to. Then all Tal would have
to do would be to get out there with
a couple of Catling guns and keep
the boys from tramping down the
newly dug up ground.
However, the Union members were
| bashful. They didn't want to start
anything without being sure that it
was perfectly 0. K. It wouldn't be
I right to start in digging without hav
i ing Teddy Roosevelt, or Chancellor
Jordan, or Charlie Austin on hand to
turn over the first shovelful. So they
