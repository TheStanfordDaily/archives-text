So great is the interest in the U.
S. C. debate that the Assembly Hall
has been obtained to hold the crowd
that is expected to attend. The fact
that the Swiss compulsory military
system has been the subject of cam
paign speeches and of newspaper
straw ballots all over the nation is
evidence of the widespread interest in

lic.
"Resolved, That the United States
should adopt the Swiss system of com
pulsory military training," is the exact
reading of the question. Stanford will
take the negative side in the U. S. C.
contest, and the affirmative against
California.
That Stanford has the odds against
her in the U. S. C. debate is the opin
ion of Debating Coach K. E. Leib, '15,
and Chairman J. F. Jr., '16, of
the intercollegiate debating commit
tee. The Southern Californians have
defeated a number of the best forensic
squads turned out by eastern univer
sities. Such strong teams as those of
Columbia, Northwestern and Idaho
universities have gone down before
the platform attacks of the U. S. C.
squads.
