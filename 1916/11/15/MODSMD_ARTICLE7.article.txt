# CAMPAIGNERS ACHIEVE GOAL OF $1600 FUND
## $1500 SAFE IN BANK Pellissier Memorial Ambulance Assuredâ€”Canvass Completed in Record Time 
### 
With $1500 safely stored away in a
Palo Alto bank, and but $100 standing
between the present accomplishment
and the achievement of its goal, the
collection of $1600 for the purchase
and maintainance of a Pellissier
Memorial Ambulance, the campaign
for the establishment of the monu
ment to the memory of the late Stan
ford faculty member, has been brought
to a close.
Campaign Successful.
The Pellissier campaign has been a
successful one in every way. Although
the bank balance of the fund is $100
below the total amount desired, this
amount has actually been promised,
and has only to be collected to bring
the $1500 to the desired mark.
\o More Solicitation.
In accordance with the new policy
of campus charity and other cam
paigns for money, the Pellissier ef
forts were confined to the period of a
fortnight. The banking of $1500 in
two weeks is record time for this ac
complishment.
Students contributed over $200, or
to be exact $201.16. The $100 to be
collected represents student offerings.
Upon the completion of the $1600
fund the amount will be forwarded
to Lee, Higginson Company, of Bos
ton, bankers, who are the financial
representatives of the American Field
Ambulance Hospital.
This firm is to have charge of the
purchase and forwarding of the Pel
lissier Ambulance to France. One
thousand dollars will be required to
meet the purchase price, while $600
will convey the vehicle to Europe, and
there maintain it for one year.
