# Pally Ruggers Play Berkeley Saturday
## Contest on Stanford Turf Decides North Coast Section Championship 
### 
Palo Alto high school's rugby fifteen
meets the speedy ruggers of Berkeley
High on the varsity turf Saturday
morning at 10 o'clock, for the North
Coast section rugby championship.
Both teams have appeared on the
Stanford field several times this sea
son, and have put up probably the
best exhibitions of rugby seen here.
Admission will be 25 cents.
Captain Collier of Palo Alto has
pronounced his ruggers ready for the
fray and will lead his team on the
field with the same lineup that has been
used heretofore. Owen and Holsten
will play front rank. Captain Collier,
G. Clark and Clark will hold down the
middle rank, while Schnell and Mey
ers are in the rear rank. Brown is
stationed at half. Nagel, Shone, G.
Green, Woodard, Schofield, T. Green,
and Klein complete the backfiold.
Patrick is the wing forward.
"Ric*' Templeton's Berkeley boys,
who have defeated the freshmen and
third varsity, are coming with their
strong lineup. Judging from previous
showing, the Berkeley lads appear to
have somewhat of an edge on the
"Pally" boys, but the local players
seem to have an uncanny way of win
ning when least expected, so the con
test should prove a thriller.
"Blondy" Peterson and Aitken, front
rank; Fraga, lock: Bliss and McHenry,
side rank; Jackson and Buttons, rear
rank, make up the list of forwards.
The backflcld is composed of Crow,
half; La Haine and Parrlsh, five
eighths; Cook, center-three; Seeley
and Maas, wings, and Cobb, full.
