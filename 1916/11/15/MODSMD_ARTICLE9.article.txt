# Grapes Changed to Marbles by Chemist
## Professor Uses Liquid Air to Enact Strange Experiments in Little Theater 
### 
With the aid of liquid air Professor
E. C. Franklin of the Chemistry de
partment turned a bunch of grapes
into a bunch of hard marbles, rubber
balls into dry crackling spheres, made
roses brittle and solidified gasoline, at
at a lecture given in the Little The
ater last night. Did you ever see mer
cury made into a hammer, or a steel
watch spring burned, or an engine
operated with air? All these things
were accomplished at the demonstra
tion.
Mercury, which boils at 360 de
grees below zero, was placed in a
glass of liquid air. A handle was
stuck into it, and it soon solidified
into a three-pound hammer. Liquid
air, which is made by cooling air with
oxygen and pressure, boils when it
comes in contact with ice. When
brought in contact with a steel watch
spring, the very great heat of the
steel made the liquid air so hot that
