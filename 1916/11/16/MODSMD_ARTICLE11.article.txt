# DR. WILBUR BACK FROM EASTERN JOURNEY
## GRADS INTERESTED Amused at Call's Attempts to Settle Stanford's Problems in Athletics 
### 
President Wilbur returned to the
campus this afternoon for a three
hour visit, following his trip through
the east, on which he attended the
convention of University Presidents,
held at Clark University, Worcester,
Massachusetts. The President left the
campus at G this evening, to speak at
the dedication of the Fresno Normal
school tomorrow.
Alumni Interested.
"The most encouraging thing about
the whole trip was meeting delega
tions of Stanford alumni all over the
country, all of whom were vitally in
terested in the University and its
progress", said President Wilbur this
afternoon. President Wilbur met alum
ni all along his trip, and found large
groups in New York, at Cornell, and
in Chicago.
Favor Military Training.
"Many questions came up at the
convention," said Dr. Wilbur. "Among
' them military training. Sentiment
was for military training in univer
sities, in spite of a number of pacific- 1
j ists at the convention. That atli
| letics are overdone is the general
j opinion of university presidents,
though this did not come up for dis
cussion publicly."
When asked about the San Fran
cisco Call's kindly attempt to settle
Stanford's athletic problem, President
Wilbur said: "I thought the article of
Smith's went about as far as I used
to throw the shot." President Wil
bur was highly amused at being con
sidered a great athlete.
"There is no reason why men can't
play American if they want to, but
they can't represent the University,"
stated President Wilbur. "We have
made no change in our football ath
letic policy since 190G, and do not ex
pect to.
Nothing New To I)o.
"There is nothing to do about the
present situation. There are always
a few people who have to let off steam
—we always expect a few. The Call
(speaks of the old days of Stanford
spirit. It is just as true now as of the
■)Id days that Stanford never was a
putter. The idea that we would quit
rugby because we are defeated by
Santa Clara is foolish. That outsiders
could step in and settle our athletics
for us is the most preposterous of all.
"Everything is settled. The present
kick-off has no bearing on the situa
tion. It is ridiculous that I am defied
by students who want to play Amer
ican football." When asked what
would happen if a majority of students
a gitated for American, President Wil
bur reiterated his former stand.

I "We'll play rugby or we won't play
anything. We have a policy and we'll
enforce it."
"I met a California woman a short
time ago who had something to say
that bears on the present situation.
She said, 'It is impossible for me to
;nderstand why some Stanford men
can be so disloyal as to play them
selves in the hands of people at Cali
fornia, when Stanford has such a
iron;; athletic policy. It is astound
in.;. It would never happen at Cali
fornia. No one would be so disloyal
over hero.' "
