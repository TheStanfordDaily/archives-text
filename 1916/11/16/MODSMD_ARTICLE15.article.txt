# A 						LAST WORD

### 
Today a climax is reached in tlie
American-Rugby imbroglio stirred up
viciously by tlie San Francisco Call
and abetted honestly by a few stu
dents interested in tlie adoption of the
Old Game at Stanford. Unquestion
ably the situation has assumed an ex
ceedingly grave nature, which de
mands serious and intelligent under
standing. In order to insure a proper
insight as to tlie best future policy of
the Student Body, a brief rehearsal
of the entire intercollegiate dispute is
necessary.
* * * *
Ten years ago, at the instigation of
Presidents Wheeler of California and
Jordan of Stanford, (lie original
switch was made from 'American foot
ball to Hugby, on account of various
well-known reasons. For eight sea
sons following, the English game
nourished at both institutions, until in
15)11, California advocated the elim
ination of freshmen from varsity com
petition. Immediately upon Stanford's
refusal to conform with this demand,
California broke off all relations—re
turning to the Old Game, while Stan
ford continued to play Hugby football.
Last sin-ills' two events of importance
took place on the local campus: first
year men were declared ineligible for
varsity teams, while later in the se
mester the English game was upheld
by a slight majority.
* * * *
This week the wrangle lias attained
the high water mark. Should Stan
ford adopt American football in order
to compete with out natural rival in
football? Assailed with this query,
President Wilbur emphatically laid
down the following mandate: Stan
ford University will not and cannot
play American football, regardless of
what style of football the present stu
dent body may favor. Furthermore,
any agitation resulting in a vote for
the Old Game will mean abolishment
of all intercollegiate athletics,
whether football, track or crew!
* * * *
Hence the Stanford Student Body,
realizing that Hugby is positively the
only possible alternative, should bond
every effort toward making the most
of the piece of pie offered, and wiping
oft" the slate last Saturday's defeat,
rather than to pout in futile exasper
ation (if they be exasperated) and
wave the red ilaur, thereby losing all
vestige of athletics.

The handful of American football
enthusiasts who practiced on the Aux
iliary Field yesterday afternoon, were

not playing; because they loved tlio
sport, but were inspired by anotlicr
far more important niolive. They were
ranking a spectacle of themselves be
<anse they hoped thereby to aid in
•>rintj;iiitr back relations with Califor
nia through a recognition of American
football, which they deemed the only
possible basis for another California*
Stanford game. However, they failed
to bear in mind, that the issue never
lias wound itself around a brand of
football, since President Wilbur lias
knocked the wind out of nil Cardinal
elevens. The Ileal Issue is contained
merely in bringing the two sister uni
versities together—a Stanford-Califor
nia Hig Game. One offers no valid ob
jection toward Stanford students play
ing for the love of the sport any par
ticular came, (as a communication
falsely asserts) but there is a well
founded criticism raised against pre
meditated eiidaiiircriiient of intercol»
leu late athletics at Stanford; against
continuance of an unhealthy hotbed
of unnecessary sedition; and finally
Against being, us dupes of the San
Francisco Call, an easy prey for de
testable, nauseating malitfiinient.

Stanford—pull together.

In conclusion it might well be stated
when dealing with the topic of Stan
ford-California relations, that since
Stanford has conceded the freshmen
j ruling: the only original grievance,
land cannot adopt American football,
the University of California, if desir
ous of renewing Stanford football re

of re-establishment of such on a

Ten years ago, at the instigation of

switch was made from 'American foot

well-known reasons. For eight sea

nourished at both institutions, until in

ination of freshmen from varsity com
petition. Immediately upon Stanford's
refusal to conform with this demand,
California broke off all relations—re
turning to the Old Game, while Stan
ford continued to play Hugby football.
Last sin-ills' two events of importance
took place on the local campus: first
year men were declared ineligible for
varsity teams, while later in the se

by a slight majority.

This week the wrangle lias attained
the high water mark. Should Stan
ford adopt American football in order
to compete with out natural rival in
football? Assailed with this query,
President Wilbur emphatically laid
down the following mandate: Stan
ford University will not and cannot
play American football, regardless of
what style of football the present stu
dent body may favor. Furthermore,
any agitation resulting in a vote for
the Old Game will mean abolishment
of all intercollegiate athletics,
whether football, track or crew!
* * * *
Hence the Stanford Student Body,
realizing that Hugby is positively the
only possible alternative, should bond
every effort toward making the most
of the piece of pie offered, and wiping
oft" the slate last Saturday's defeat,
rather than to pout in futile exasper

The handful of American football
enthusiasts who practiced on the Aux

not playing; because they loved tlio
sport, but were inspired by anotlicr
far more important niolive. They were
ranking a spectacle of themselves be
<anse they hoped thereby to aid in

nia through a recognition of American
football, which they deemed the only
possible basis for another California*
Stanford game. However, they failed
to bear in mind, that the issue never
lias wound itself around a brand of
football, since President Wilbur lias
knocked the wind out of nil Cardinal
elevens. The Ileal Issue is contained
merely in bringing the two sister uni
versities together—a Stanford-Califor
nia Hig Game. One offers no valid ob
jection toward Stanford students play
ing for the love of the sport any par
ticular came, (as a communication
falsely asserts) but there is a well
founded criticism raised against pre

of unnecessary sedition; and finally

In conclusion it might well be stated

Stanford has conceded the freshmen
