Quite in accord with the "sport for
sport's sake" policy, and fully intend
ing to encourage the greatest number
to participate in any form of ath
letics, The Daily Palo Alto yesterday
very graciously accorded the embry
onic American football team a kindly
bit of advertising in the form of a
news item.
It is true that the men "out" did
not have any equipment, and played in
what the D. P. A. was pleased to refer
to as "collarless shirts and a brand
of muchly advertised underwear," —it
is also very probable that they will
not be offered any equipment from
the athletic funds to which they have
quite extensively contributed. They
are not, however, asking any support
nor appealing to any college spirit to
urge them onward. If they purchase
their own equipment and play for the
sake of the game which they enjoy—
without any hopes of receiving var
sity emblems or a ray from the ath
letic limelight—it shows that the game
means something to them.
The "thirteen men" of whom the
D. P. A. wrote hardly wish to be con
sidered martyrs and they are far
from traitors. They are not even ask
ing for fair play, but they are a part
of Stanford and want to be allowed
the right to believe in "principles"
and to act according to their own de
sires and opinions.
The D. P. A. purports to be the or
gan of the student body and yet it
seems to find pleasure in ridiculing
a part of its supporters. It pretends
to be ready at all times to dissem
inate the news of the community, and
if it is a real newspaper in any other
sense it might be expected to recog
nize two sides to every question and
at least allow the "wrong" side to be
heard. And if it wants news to re
place the sarcastic views under the
guise of its yesterday's report of the
American football turn-out, it might
be interested to know that more than
one challenge in the interfraternity
American Football series has been is
sued and accepted.
