A ( HI-EL VIEWPOINT.
Palo Alto, Nov. 16.
Dear Sir:
Congratulations upon your record
breaking achievement, the wonderfully
vivid and unassailable manner in
which your able reporter handled the
story of Professor Franklin's demon
stration of liquid air. Baron Mun
chausen himself could not have done
as well. The greatest liar in the
world could not have touched your ac
count.
Mercury boils about 3CO degrees
holow zero! Phenomenal! Marvel
ous, my dear sir! Professor Franklin
demonstrated the high combustibility
of oxygen! Magnificent! Oxygen
combustible? Just about as com
bustible as gravity or the price of
lienfood.
I wonder if your little writer realizes
the meaning of "combustible." Ask
her or him if fire is combustible!
Every scientist died of spontaneous
combustion upon reading yesterday's
Daily Palo Alto.
Pardon this letter. 1 don't mind if
you publish it —the scientific world
should know of your great achieve
ment! Very truly yours,
CONSTANT READER.
Dear Constant Reader: —Thank you
for your praise. The freshman who
"covercd" the Tuesday evening lecture
majors in the Englisn department, and
has been since recommended for the
Nobel prize for literature. We have
no scientists on this paper. They
dau't handle language. Your criticism
is interesting, but of trivial import
ance.
What matters it if mercury boils at
360 above or below zero? Doth tem
peratures are impractical for general
enjoyment. The average housewife,
too, boils her eggs in water.
We took a canvass of the staff as
to whether or not oxygen is combust
ible, and the majority voted in favor
of rugby. Two upperclassmen agreed
that matches, if kept dry, were com
bustible. We thank you for your in
terest, and your praise.
