# "Ya-Hoo Is Good Bird, Says Gilroy
## 
### 
Among the thoughtful Stanford men,
the disposal of the Ya-Hoo bird is
being discussed. The 1920ites are
alarmed at the rumor that they will
have to build another bonfire in which
the famous bird will be cremated and
the Ya-hoo buttons burned with great
ceremony.
Another clever scheme is that the
ostrich (?) be thrown into the bay, and
someone else even suggested that it be
taken up in the hills and tied to a
tree.
A science student's idea of deep
humor is to bury the bird and let
some Stanford professor, fifty years
hence, find this strange mammal of
the pre-historic ages. It would un
doubtedly please the professor.
ft has also been suggested that since
Santa Clara has such a great desire
for the weird-looking creature, as was
indicated immediately following the
game, it be sent to the Mission Town
school with the compliments of the
Stanford Student Body.
W. Gilroy, '17, official custodian and
trainer of the only Ya-hoo bird in ex
istanee, sticks to his original conten
tion that "The Ya-hoo is a good bird,"
and refuses to talk further on the sub
ject, when interviewed. Meanwhile
the subject of all this discussion
sleeps peacefully in a San Francisco
storage house.
