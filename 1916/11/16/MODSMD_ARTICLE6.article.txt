Cardinal Handicapped.
California will have the advantage
in number of men entered, the Berk
eley institution having nominated fif
teen runners, while only nine will
represent Stanford. The fact that M.
F. Samis, '20, winner of the recent in
terclass cross-country event, will he
barred by the freshman ineligibility
rule, and that H. V. Aupperle, '17,
track captain and distance man, is in
the east with Dr. Jordan, will also be
a handicap to the Stanford runners.
Stanford will have a slight advant

age in that the Cardinal team has
been training over the kind of ground
on which the course will be run, but
this advantage is discounted some
what by the fact that the team has
never gone over the exact course for
the race, which will wind around the
hills for two and one-half miles after
leaving the post-office, and will then
consist of two miles around the estate,
looping around the lake and finishing
at the postoffice, This course will en
able spectators to view not only the
start and finish but also that portion
of the race which will be run in the
| vicinity of the lake.

bo counted as point-winners, and the
team having the smallest total of
points the winner. This system
