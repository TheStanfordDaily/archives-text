# San Francisco Call Man Is Funny, But Can't Fool Stanford
## 
### 
It's a shame to take good space
in this column advertising the Call
sport man's sporting blood. But
the Call man and his ideas are the
funniest things in the world, and
anything that's really funny ought
to be printed.
The Call man thinks his middle
name is Lincoln, and that he is
emancipating Stanford athletes. He
says he's started a campaign to
bring back, bring back, bring back
the Big Game to us. And the fun
niest part of it all is that Call man
actually thinks he's accomplishing
things.
Well, come to think of it, he is.
He's stirring up the yellowest lit
tle rumpus in his columns that
we've had in years. He's messing
up whatever chances Stanford and
California had of getting together
tliis year, by putting a lot of pep
pery little bugs into the public's
bonnet, tbat will postpone getting
together for a few years more.
Poor Call man, that's going to
work a hardship on him, because
he can't write just fiction and bunk
for that long a time without get
ting caught at the game, even in
the outside world. If he'd kept his
fingers out of the pie, he might
have had lots of copy about Big
Games every year.
Funny, too, how figures will lie!
Of course, one can't blame the
Call man if figures do lie. But
then the Call man's figures said
sixty men were out whooping it
for the American game last night,
.lust plain arithmetic only counted
sixteen —maybe it was a misprint,
sixteen is a good deal like sixty.
The Call man likes to kid him
self along. He says he's being re
ceived in open arms by Stanford
folk, and that the students hooray
after every word of his guff. May
be they do, with laughter. It's
amusing to have some off-the-boat
outsider tell you how to run your
own affairs.
Funny, too, how (lie Call man
started his campaign. "I need
copy," he must hare said. "I'll
start some agitation for a Stan
ford-California Hits- Game. Guess
I'll pick on Stanford, because slie
seems weakest. They always give
in iit Stanford." So the Call man
came out. lint lie didn't know that
Stanford can't help laughing at
such si funny campaign.
The Call man thinks that a few
fellows out for American practice
means Stanford swings over from
rugby, lie doesn't seem to real
ize that a man can do as he pleases
down here —lie can play ping-pong
whist if he wants to—so long as
lie doesn't pose as ot'licial repre
sentative of the student body.

Funny, too, how figures will lie!
Of course, one can't blame the
Call man if figures do lie. But
then the Call man's figures said
sixty men were out whooping it
for the American game last night,
.lust plain arithmetic only counted
sixteen —maybe it was a misprint,
sixteen is a good deal like sixty.
The Call man likes to kid him
self along. He says he's being re
ceived in open arms by Stanford
folk, and that the students hooray
after every word of his guff. May
be they do, with laughter. It's
amusing to have some off-the-boat
outsider tell you how to run your
own affairs.
Funny, too, how (lie Call man
started his campaign. "I need
copy," he must hare said. "I'll
start some agitation for a Stan
ford-California Hits- Game. Guess
I'll pick on Stanford, because slie
seems weakest. They always give
in iit Stanford." So the Call man
came out. lint lie didn't know that
Stanford can't help laughing at
such si funny campaign.
The Call man thinks that a few
fellows out for American practice
means Stanford swings over from
rugby, lie doesn't seem to real
ize that a man can do as he pleases
down here —lie can play ping-pong
whist if he wants to—so long as
lie doesn't pose as ot'licial repre
sentative of the student body.
It's a shame to take good space
in this column advertising the Call
sport man's sporting blood. But
the Call man and his ideas are the
funniest things in the world, and
anything that's really funny ought
to be printed.
The Call man thinks his middle
name is Lincoln, and that he is
emancipating Stanford athletes. He
says he's started a campaign to
bring back, bring back, bring back
the Big Game to us. And the fun
niest part of it all is that Call man
actually thinks he's accomplishing
things.
Well, come to think of it, he is.
He's stirring up the yellowest lit
tle rumpus in his columns that
we've had in years. He's messing
up whatever chances Stanford and
California had of getting together
tliis year, by putting a lot of pep
pery little bugs into the public's
bonnet, tbat will postpone getting
together for a few years more.
Poor Call man, that's going to
work a hardship on him, because
he can't write just fiction and bunk
for that long a time without get
ting caught at the game, even in
the outside world. If he'd kept his
fingers out of the pie, he might
have had lots of copy about Big
Games every year.
