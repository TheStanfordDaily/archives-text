Back on the Job—
With books, and pencil, and paper
we're off lor the final grind. Elec
tion, The Big Game, etc. —they're
over for a while. However, shoe
worries are not over except for
Thoits' customers —who never
worry. Shoe worries are Thoits'
business. Let Thoits Brothers do
it for you.
"VWcOuT"
-HOW ABO IT YOUR SHOES?"
Stanford Inn doesn't profess to be a Waldorf-Astoria.
Nor does the Inn attempt to compete with cheap eating houses.
You can eat more elaborately than at the Inn.
You can pay less than at the Inn.
But you cannot eat BETTER than at the Inn no
matter how much you pay or where you go.
7.—Well-cooked food.
2.—Efficient service.
3.—Pleasing atmosphere.
4.—Prices that are moderate.
— That's the Inn.
