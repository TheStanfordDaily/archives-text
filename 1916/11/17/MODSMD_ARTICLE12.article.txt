Stanford cross-country runners up
set tlie dope sheet this afternoon when
they defeated the University of Cali
fornia team in the first annual inter
collegiate cross-country run. Arthur
Wilson, '18, of the Stanford team,
placed first, in 27 minutes, 42 1-5 sec
onds, and was closely followed by
Jimmy McPlierson, '18. Captain
Sherman of California, who crossed
tho finish line in third place, was the
first Blue and Gold runner to place.
The distance was four miles, two of
which were over hilly country.
ft had been agreed that, the team
placing five men in the best order
among the first ten to finish would
win, thus making the team that scored
the least number of points the win
ner. Stanford's score was 2G, while
California's was 29.
Wilson and McPlierson jumped into
the load during the first quarter of
a mile, and were never headed, al
though Sullivan of California gave
them a stiff race during the first two
miles and a half. He broke while
crossing the lake and Sherman went
into third place.
Teitsworth ran a gritty race the en
tire distance, but did not appear to be
in the best of form. Teitsworth
placed fifth. Lloyd Kinnear was an
other man who put everything into
the race that he had, being barely
beaten out at the finish by Howard of
the California team.
Captain Griffin was the fifth Stan
ford man to win his Circle "S," and
it was his defeat of Talbot of Cali
fornia for the tenth position that
gave Stanford the victory.
Wilson's time for the distance is
remarkable, considering the character
of the ground covered. The first two
miles was exceedingly difficult run
ning, several of the hills being very
steep. The course was a harder one
than that picked for the recent inter
class race, and this accounts for the
slightly slower time that was made.
The California men were better equip
ped for the hill climbing, in that they
wore regulation cross-country shoes,
while the Stanford men wore tennis
shoes.
The course was such that it en
abled the large crowd of spectators to
get a good view of the race at sev
eral points. The start and the finish
were behind the postoffice.
Coach Walter Christie of the Cali
fornia team declared himself well sat
isfied with the conduct of the long
grind, and said that the better team
had won.

Stanford cross-country runners up
set tlie dope sheet this afternoon when
they defeated the University of Cali
fornia team in the first annual inter
collegiate cross-country run. Arthur
Wilson, '18, of the Stanford team,
placed first, in 27 minutes, 42 1-5 sec
onds, and was closely followed by
Jimmy McPlierson, '18. Captain
Sherman of California, who crossed
tho finish line in third place, was the
first Blue and Gold runner to place.
The distance was four miles, two of
which were over hilly country.
ft had been agreed that, the team
placing five men in the best order
among the first ten to finish would
win, thus making the team that scored
the least number of points the win
ner. Stanford's score was 2G, while
California's was 29.
Wilson and McPlierson jumped into
the load during the first quarter of
a mile, and were never headed, al
though Sullivan of California gave
them a stiff race during the first two
miles and a half. He broke while
crossing the lake and Sherman went
into third place.
Teitsworth ran a gritty race the en
tire distance, but did not appear to be
in the best of form. Teitsworth
placed fifth. Lloyd Kinnear was an
other man who put everything into
the race that he had, being barely
beaten out at the finish by Howard of
the California team.
Captain Griffin was the fifth Stan
ford man to win his Circle "S," and
it was his defeat of Talbot of Cali
fornia for the tenth position that
gave Stanford the victory.
Wilson's time for the distance is
remarkable, considering the character
of the ground covered. The first two
miles was exceedingly difficult run
ning, several of the hills being very
steep. The course was a harder one
than that picked for the recent inter
class race, and this accounts for the
slightly slower time that was made.
The California men were better equip
ped for the hill climbing, in that they
wore regulation cross-country shoes,
while the Stanford men wore tennis
shoes.
The course was such that it en
abled the large crowd of spectators to
get a good view of the race at sev
eral points. The start and the finish
were behind the postoffice.
Coach Walter Christie of the Cali
fornia team declared himself well sat
isfied with the conduct of the long
grind, and said that the better team
had won.
