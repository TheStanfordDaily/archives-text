# IN MEMORIAM
## 
### 
In the early morning hours between
Monday and Tuesday there passed into
the Great Quiet one who had he
longed to the University life since its
beginning—Belle Thompson. Coming
with her family that opening year, in
order that a young brother might re
ceive a degree with Stanford's first
class, she went into the library.
Many an old graduate has cause to
remember her helpfulness and inter
est in his particular request, as she
sought to find the book that was
needed. Later, Miss Thompson en
tered the campus postoffice, where,
behind the window, she served her
community with that same spirit of
kindliness which characterized her
work at the library desk. Strange
how a window may separate us from
the world on the other side! Hers
was a life of quiet service, for she
was one of those rare individuals who
do their deeds and "scorn to blot
them with a name." Only closest
friends can realize the full beauty of
her life—but there be many who will
say, "I owed her much."
