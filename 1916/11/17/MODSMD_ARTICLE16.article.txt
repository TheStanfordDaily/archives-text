Both pleasing and noteworthy has
been the rapid development of ath
letics at Stanford University, when
for the moment dropping the bars of
the present, one becomes reminiscent
of the past. Not many years ago,
there existed but a meager list of
sports which claimed the popular
limelight. Since then the field has
been enlarged into a veritable net
work of athletic diversions, which
when added together total over a
score. This afternoon marked the
successful entrance of intercollegiate
cross-country into the realms of
Cardinal sportdom, the California
squad being humbled in a gruelling
race across the hills. Congratulations
are in order.
