LOOKING BACKWARD.
(From The Daily Palo Alto, Novem
ber 18, 1Â»4({.)
Claiming that Stanford is too dem
ocratic, the San Francisco "Call" to
day began a campaign to abolish the
custom of "hello" between all stu
dents of the University, women as well
as the men, which has grown up dur
ing the past decade. Says the "Call"
sporting editor:
"Stanford is the only educational
institution in the country which tol
erates this gross familiarity between
its students. In 1916 men who were
not of the same department, or who
were not playing the same sport, never
spoke to each other without good
cause. For instance, a track man
would not condescend to greet a
member of the military corps; a rugby
man would not bow to a debater, and
a man who attended formal dances
would not speak to a student whom
he had never seen in a full dress suit.
"Among the women, it was even
| more ideal. The 'co-ed' spoke only
to the man who spent bis money on
her at least once each week, and she
deigned to take the initiative in salu
tation only when the 'man' was rum
ored to be engaged to her. . . .
"Conditions on the campus at Stan
ford now are intolerable. They must
stop ... if they do not change
themselves, we will slop them."
A human being in attendance at
this institution was yesterday punish
ed by the Students' Council to the ex
tent of having several hours added to
his or her or its graduation require
ments for failing to reply to a cer
tain creature of the opposite sex when
spoken to on the Quad. Another stu
dent was warned for refusing to take
a person of the opposite sex to din
ner, theater and dance in San Fran
cisco when it was hinted that he, she
or it should do so.
