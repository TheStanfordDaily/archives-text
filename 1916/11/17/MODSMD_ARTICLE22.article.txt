Working under the direction of the
Associated Charities of San Fran
cisco, and under the immediate chair
manship of Mrs. E. W. Smith, the
social service committees of the Y. W.
C. A. and the Y. M. C. A. are making
plans for a campus "old clothes"
campaign.
The custom of spending $200 an
nually for this purpose has been
necessarily abandoned this year, due
to the shortage of funds, while the
demand lias not decreased.
Although the greatest need is for
cast-off clothing, the list of necessary
articles covers a large range. Papers,
cardboard, rubbers and furniture, etc.,
will be very acceptable.
A collection of articles from the
sorority and fraternity houses and the
halls will be made by the social ser
vice committee in December, and
others having things to give are asked
to telephone to J. B. Watson, Y. M. C.
A. secretary, who will have them
! called for.
