# Hewston Dispels Wild Rumors of a Drained Lagunita
## 
### 
"We have just had Lake Lagunita
cleaned out, so that the swimming and
boating would be better next year,
and I'm surprised to hear these wild
stories about drying up Lake Lagun
ita to decrease mosquitoes or to in
crease water pressure. If the stu
dents want it dried up, I wish they
would have told me before we spent
so much money in cleaning it out,"
said Farm Superintendent Hewston
when lie was told of the rumors float
ing around the campus in regard to
the elimination of Stanford's "little
ocean."
"It is absolutely false," said Hews
ton. "Lake Lagunita is a permanent
institution and we have no intention
of draining it."
