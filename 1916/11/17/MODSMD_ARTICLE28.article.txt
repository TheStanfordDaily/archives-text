Ice-hockey men are starting their
sport in earnest now with the close
of the football season, and a full
year's schedule is being arranged.
Sunday afternoon the ice-hockey team
will journey to San Francisco for
final practice of the year.
The Winter Garden is open to the
practice of Stanford students be
tween' r>:3o and 6:30 every Sunday
evening.
It is practically assured that a game
with California will be arranged as
soon as the football season at that
university is over.
