# 800 Members Will Observe Wednesday As Union Labor Day
## 
### 
Tal Smith, '14, manager of the
Stanford Union, has announced that
I Wednesday, November 22, is Union
Labor Day for all members of the
Union. The object of this day of labor
for the 800 members of the Union is
to dig the lawn around the Union and
Women's Club House, and plant grass
seed.
Members of the Union are going
to assemble during their spare hours
that day, with borrowed hoes, rakes,
spades, and other farming imple
ments, to get the ground in shape for
seeding. A team with a plow made
its first appearance on the ground
today and will have all the ground
ready before Wednesday. On that
day the ground will be smoothed over
and seeded. Smith expects a good
crowd out all day and promises a
regular picnic rather than a union
labor party.
In payment for the cultivation of
their lawn, the members of the
Woman's Club House are going to
pass out light refreshments to the
laborers, at various times during the
day.
