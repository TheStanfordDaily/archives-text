# Dark for Decade Famous Ikeda Room to Open
## 
### 
Ever since the earthquake in 190G,
one room in Stanford Museum has re
mained closed. Next Sunday, this
room is again to be opened, and once
more the priceless collection of Jap
anese and Chinese art treasures, the
Ikeda set, will he viewed by the pub
lic.
In 1904, Mrs. Jane Lathrop Stanford
purchased from S. Ikeda, Jr., son of
the groat collector, several nundred
pieces of the Ikeda collection, which
had just been assigned to Ihe British
Museum, at a price of over $100,000.
Since that time the art treasures have
increased greatly in value, the price
of one piece alone being set at $30,-
000.
The collection, as a whole, com
prises several hundred pieces, every
one of which is genuine, and is rep
resentative of the best artistic efforts
which the Japanese and Chinese have
put forth during the past seven cen
turies.
Due to the untiring efforts of H. 0.
Peterson, curator of the Stanford
Museum, pieces broken by the earth
quake have been pieced together and
the set tabulated and arranged in
proper order.
