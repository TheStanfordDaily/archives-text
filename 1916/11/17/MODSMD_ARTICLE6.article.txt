# Will Name Varsity Skipper Sunday A.M.
## 
### 
following a custom that, has been
in vogue at Stanford for a number of
years, the football team will elect
next year's captain when the varsity
gathers at Franklin's Studio, in Palo
Alto, to have a team picture taken,
next Sunday morning.
It is not certain who will he chosen
by the players, but there are several
men worthy of the position.
