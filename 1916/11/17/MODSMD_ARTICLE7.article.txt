# TWENTY TURF MEN WILL BE READY NEXT YEAR
## BROWN MAY COACH Two Former Captains Will Be on Hand for 1917 Rugby Varsity 
### 
Twenty men, out of the total of
twenty-six that were included in the
list of varsity players and substitutes
this year, will be back to don rugby
togs next season when the call is is
sued, following the big rally in Sep
tember. This is an overwhelmingly
large proportion, and speaks well for
the fifteen that will try a come-back
next year.
Sample, Bihlman, Schwarzenbeck,
Coleman, Swartz, Pettingill, Braden,
Winham, Chandler, Wilkins, Walker,
Wark, Long, Lachmund, Carroll, Pe
louze, Templeton, Wilcox, and Mar
riott have all signified their intentions
of trying out for the Stanford varsity
when the next pigskin season comes
around. Kester, Single, Murray, Hal
stead, Swigart,, and West arc the
players who will be unable to take
another fling at intercollegiate foot
ball.
Two Ex-Captains on Hand.
Moth Braden and Carroll will be eli
gible and will add a great deal to the
strength of the fifteen. It. is seldom
that two past captains are able to
play with a team. Strong competition
for places will result when some of
the freshmen players of this season
put their efforts toward making the
Cardinal varsity. Barneson, Tilton,
Larkin, ami several other stars of the
1920 team, will look well in gray suits
next season.
i!I Seek Brown us Coach.
It is understood that efforts will
again be made to secure the services
of Floyd Brown as football coach.
Brown has had a very successful ca
reer as head of the football destinies
of Stanford, and has made an enviable
record.
Graduate Manager Behrens says that
the Big Game will again be played
with the University of Santa Clara,
probably at Ewing Field in San Fran
cisco, and the date will be the second
Saturday in November. Plans are al
ready under way for a full schedule
of games for all the teams on the
campus. There will be a number of
other fifteens playing rugby next sea
son that will be able to furnish excel
lent competition, besides the club
teams that met the varsity this year.
Santa Clara will have another
good team next year, only losing
Milburn, Coschina and Bensberg
probability retaining Charlie Austin
as the coach. Rugby has at last been
drilled into the Mission Town players,
and from all indications, Stanford
will have to turn out a much better
fifteen than the squad developed this
season, if the Cardinal is to come out
on the long end of Big Game scores.
