Gold again, Saturday morning, on the
California field. The victory is the
first of the 191G series, and if the
Stanford players win next Saturday
on the home turf it will make the
eighth consecutive year that the Card
inal soccerites have triumphed over
the California squad.
First Half An Even Ilreak.
The first half was an even break for
the two teams and good dribbling
characterized it. Offsetting this drib
bling and thus preventing scores, were
the long and well placed kicks of full
backs. California scored first when
McKinlay drove the ball in from out
side forward to Captain Harding,
who centered. Wilson, the Blue and
Gold outside left, was right on the
spot, and placed a neat little kick
into the net for the Bears' first and
only score.
Adams Scores for Stanford.
Near the end of this half, Sid Ad
ams, outside left for Stanford, evened
i up the score with a pretty drive to
the net, the result of a long dribbling
rush.by the Cardinal forwards.
The first of the second half started
with the Californians as the aggres
sors, and it looked like a win for the
Bears. Blue and Gold men on the
outside of the lino centered the ball
continually to their backs, and the
Stanford goal was peppered contin
ually for twenty minutes. Williams,
the Cardinal goal, was too steady for
them, and efforts of the Blue and Gold
j to score failed.
Cardinals In Load.
Stanford look the lead when Weller,
outside left, hooked the ball down
near the Cardinal goal line, made an
unassisted dribbling rush down the
field, and finally kicked to the Bears'
goal. Wheatly, outside forward, was
followed up, and placed a kick into
, the net. The last score of the game
; was also made by Wlieatly, making
the total score 3 to 1 in favor of Stan
ford.
