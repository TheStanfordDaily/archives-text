# UNION LABORITES
## 
### 
Cynics, skeptical of the value of
university training, maintaining em
ployment of the manual labor type
epitomizes the fruits of a four-year
siege of college education, would
wisely shake their heads if they could
hut pay a visit to the campus Wednes
day. During this festal occasion, all
Stanford folks, whether advocates of
long hours and small wages, organ
ized or unorganized lahor, or even
strike-breakers, will be found, irre
spective of creed, class, or national
ity, toiling industriously toward the
beautifying of the grounds surround
ing the Union. Even the women will
add their mite by supplying refresh
ments to the Slavonic horde.

Ever since the construction of the
men's clubhouse, the barren grounds
have been an eye-sore to campus resi
dents, earlier improvement being im
possible, due to the shortage of funds.
With the aid of the Union members,
the land having been graded during
the past few days, the manager in
tends to transform the waste by
means of lawn, shrubbery, and flowers
of variegated descriptions. No matter
whether prospective laborers disclaim
all knowledge of botanical technique,
plant anatomy, morphology, pathology
or any other form of ology, their ser
vices will be anticipated and appre
ciated some time during the day.

Needless to mention, any effort
toward aiding the Stanford Union at
tain the lofty plane for which it was
founded, is a cause of worthy char
acter. Any attempt to propound the
position and need that the clubhouse
occupies in the university life, would
be equally as unnecessary as rehears
ing the ten commandments before a
theological seminary. Every male in
habitant should devote a portion of his
time Wednesday brandishing a garden
weapon, thereby doing his small part
in the improvement of the Union
grounds.
