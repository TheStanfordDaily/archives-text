among the highest in his particular
calling to that of a convict in two
penitentiaries, the men who heard R.
H. Baldwin tell his life story in Encina
last evening, listened intently as Bald
win traced his downfall.
Born of a good family, educated at
Yale and in the leading universities
of Europe, Baldwin became a high
church official in New York. His
prominent position led to his election
to a number of exclusive clubs. As
member of a club he learned to like
strong drink, which, he stated, led
directly to his downfall.
Following a succession of experi
ences as rector, literary critic, school
teacher and lecturer, Baldwin finally
lost all of these positions through his
addiction to drink, he said, and came
to the Pacific Coast, where he secured
employment as a book agent in Port
land and Seattle. Later he drifted to
Los Angeles, where through playing
the races he became involved in ille
gal practices while under the in
fluence of 3*quor and was sent to Fol
som for two years.
Released from Folsom shortly after
the San Francisco disaster, he determ
ined to start life anew, but in a few
years again committed a crime while
working in Spokane as a traveling
salesman. Sent to the prison at
Walla Walla, he soon rose to the
highest position held by a prisoner,
and through his monthly commissary
reports to the governor became ac
quainted with that official and was
pardoned after serving but a portion
of his sentence.
