# Rifles for Drill to Reach Here Tuesday
## University May Have to Buy Uniformsâ€”No Federal Appropriation 
### 
Military enthusiasts will be able to
use rifles for the first time Wednes
day afternoon, according to an an
nouncement by Sergeant E. H. Jewell,
today. After a wait of over a month,
the bill of lading for the rifles has
been received, and the rifles them
selves will be here by.tomorrow morn
ing, according to the sergeant.
That uniforms will probably have
to be purchased by the University,
with remuneration by the government
at an early date in the future, is now
apparent. After many weeks of ex
pectation, news has been received by
Major Jens Bugge, that, although laws
to cover the furnishing of uniforms
to university corps such as the one
at Stanford has been passed, no ap
propriation had been made to cover
the cost of the uniforms.
