SEEING AMERICAN FIRST.
Scone—On tlie boat going home.
Time—After the Calwash frame. Char
acters —Tlie football nsed in tlie game
and 'nother pitrskin not used.
First Ball (as Dobie said to the
press)— Thank God, it's over with.
'Nother Ball —What's over with?
F. B. —The great western intercol
legiate American bull fest. The af
fair was the greatest debating con
test I ever kicked into.
'N. B.—What did they debate about?
F. B. —Cal. players argued who
should be the next man to break the
string holding his shoulder pads in
place. Wash, as far as I could dope
it, debated how big a score should be
rolled up. They always ended by
ringing in some Spokane class that
was on the boat coming down. Bet
the girls' ears burned.
'N. B.—Who won?
F. B.—The game or the debate?
Sharpe won the Cal debate because he
convinced all his team-mates that he
should be permitted to carry the ball
straight out to the sidelines every
three minutes, in order to give the
bleachers a little real rugby excite
ment.
'N. B. —But the game?
F. B. —Oh, that was never in doubt.
Wash would play better'nell until they
were in danger of scoring and then
they'd give Cal a turn, though Wash
did accidentally slip over 13 points,
while U. C. only nabbed 3.
'N. B. —What means Dobie when he
said he "hoped to keep the score
down?"
F. B.—Well, didn't he! Washington
kept the score just as low as was pos
sible without letting the ref get next.
'N. B. —was anybody hurt?
F. B. —No, that's the joke. If some
player had been considerate enough to
get hurt once in a while, there
wouldn't have been so many broken
shoe strings. After every play some
man would have to call "Shoestring,
oh My Kingdom for a shoe string,"
and at the signal the two elevens
would gather in two groups to renew
the debate. Once, when T was close
to the Cal group, I listened close.
Brud was saying, "We got to get 'em
now; Pete you slip the ball to Hie,
and he'll push it to .Take, and then
Sharpe can run over toward the
bleachers, and we'll fox 'em. After
this play it's my turn to bust a shoe
string."
