# Athletic Club Loses to Winged O Players
## Templeton and Urban Feature With Star Plays in 19 to 3 Game 
### 
Another surprise was sprung in the j
annual club rugby championship ser
ies, Sunday, when the Olympic Club
â– fifteen defeated the speedy Palo Alto
Athletic Club by al9 to score. Tin
game was played on the University oi
Santa Clara turf.
Roth teams had strong line-ups and
put forward every effort to win. The
game was a forward battle, the
Winged O's keeping the ball away
from the fast Palo Alto backs. This
was their only hope, and it won the
contest, as the San Francisco team j
was much the stronger In the pack.
The backfield of the Olympics i
showed considerable speed at times,
.Toe Urban, Billy Hale, Art Erb, and
Hanley, tearing through for long and
sensational runs. Noonan, Hanley, |
Weislander and Erb scored for the
winners, Hale converting one of the !
tallies, while Templeton went over i
for the lone Palo Alto try.
"Uic" Templeton featured the con- j
test with lon.n boots to touch, Ilis,
work saved the Palo Alto club from i
a worse defeat. .Toe Urban was the |
star of the Olympic Club fifteen. He
advanced the ball many times, ably
assisted by his team-mate, Hanley.
The Olympic Club will meot the win- ;
ner of the Barbarian Club-Palo Alto
came for the club championship.
