# "Review" Appears Now Under Press Club Sponsorship
## 
### 
Editorial announcement of Press
Club's sponsorship of The Stanford
Illustrated Review is made in the fifth
number of the new illustrated maga
zine which will be placed on sale to
morrow. Heretofore the magazine has
had no official connection with a recog
nized student organization, having
been begun by students acting inde
pendently. The new arrangement, by
which Press Club, the oldest honorary
organization on the campus, takes
over the publication, promises to be
an important step for both the mag
azine and the Press Club.
No Interference With Policy.
The new plan will not embrace any
interference with the independence of
the lllustrated's board of editors, but
will serve purely as a stabilizing in
fluence, tending to giving permanence
to the publication which has met with
such a warm welcome on the part of
the student body.
Notable Contributions.
"Profit and Loss of Wilson's Vic
tory," by Professor Alvin S. Johnson,
and "First Aid to the Honest," by
Professor S. W. Young of the Chem
istry department, are two of the
notable contributions in the current
number. Professor Johnson explains
the meaning of the recent election,
and from information available to him
points out what the country may ex-
pect from the Democrats. Professor
Young discusses the "Honor System"
from an entirely new viewpoint, taking
for his subject the "System" as it af
fects the honest rather than the dis
honest.

Kneass, MS; "Heads or Tails," by P.
