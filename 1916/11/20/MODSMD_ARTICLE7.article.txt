# AUTOS BARRED FROM QUAD ROADS
## 
### 
Automobiles, carriages and all other
wheeled vehicles, with the exception
of bicycles, will be barred from all
roads adjacent to the Quadrangle, be
ginning tomorrow morning, according
to a statement made today by Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Completion of class rooms in the
l-asemcnt of the English building, the
use of which is impracticable under
present noise conditions, is the imme
diate cause of the new traffic restric
tions. With the construction of the
art. museum and the new library, life
of the University will center more than

t ever before on the south side of the
i present Qnarl, and classroom and study
! conditions would bo imperfect as long
as traffic was permitted on the roads
| bordering the Quad.
Chains will act as traffic blockers
until such time as permanent sand
stone gates can be erected.
As a result, of these regulations, ve
hicles soing from Palo Alto to Alva
rado. Salvatierra or Lasuen streets,
will have to take a more roundabout,
route, either going around by way of
Eneina or by the upper road on the
northern side of the Quadrangle.
