# And The Ya-Hoo Lies Burned 'Neath The California Sod
## 
### 
"The Ya-hoo bird is buried,
Underneath the Berkeley sod.."
The Ya-hoo bird is dead. Con
ceived and dedicated to the fight
ing spirit of Stanford, this young
est and most ill-fortuned of all
varsity mascots, wished its last
jinx on the University of Cali
fornia campus, Saturday morning,
during the opening game of the
191(i intercollegiate socccr series.
BerkeleyiteS successfully raided
the Turk street warehouse, Fri
day night, overpowering the
watchman.
As died Joan of Arc, so did the
Ya-hoo bird meet death, undaunt
ed, unmoved, hot but collected,
even as the Blue and Gold flames
soared high.
Retrieved Its Past.
In the face of death, the Ya-hoo
bird retrieved its short-lived past,
and put an end to the mystery
surrounding its identity. The Ya
hoo proved to be of the genus
"Swanus," for as it died there rose
from the hitherto silent bird a
"swan" songâ€”a song of defeat for
California.
Ignorant of the capture of the
Ya-hoo, Stanford soccer players
were stunned at the sight of their
mascot on the enemy's ground,
and allowed California to run
through their lines for the first
score of the contest. As the flames
mounted skyward and the victim
sank lower, the Cardinal blood ran
i strong, and to the tune of the
Ya-hoo's death paean trampled all
over the. Blue and Gold.
Released Dread Spell.
The Ya-hoo's crumbling to ashes
released the Cardinals of a dread
' spell.
The Ya-hoo bird, grim hoodoo of
j the Cardinal, had awakened at
the warmth of Berkeley fire and
the smell of California blood. As
it died in flame so shall it rise in
flame, in a new form. For the
soul of the Ya-hoo is as the
Phoenix, immortal, say sporting
writers. At any rate, the Ya-hoo
at its cremation, played havoc
with California's goat, something
like 3 to 1.
