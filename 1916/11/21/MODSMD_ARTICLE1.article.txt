# TAKE DRILL TWO YEARS; GET SALARY
## RECEIVE $9 A MONTH Must Be Recommended and Agree to Remain in the Service 
### 
Students who take two years of mili
tary training, and who are recom
mended by the professor of Military
Science and Tactics and by the Presi
dent of the University, will receive
an allowance of approximately nine
dollars a month, according to an an
nouncement issued today by Major
Jens Bugge, U. S. A., retired, head of
the department.
Must Sign Agreement.
Students eligible for this remuner
ation, in order to obtain it, must sign
the following written agreement:
"In consideration of commutation of
subsistence to be furnished me in ac
cordance with law, I hereby agree to
continue in the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps during the remainder
of my course in Leland Stanford
Junior University, to devote five hours
per week during such period to mili
tary training prescribed, and to pur
sue the course of camp training dur
ing such period, prescribed by the
Secretary of War."
Only Students Eligible.
To become a member of the corps
a student must be a bona fide mem
ber of the University, must be a citi
zen of the United States, and must be
in fit physical condition. Anyone not
fulfilling these requirements, but wish
ing to take military training, may do
so, and will be allowed the use of
arms and equipment issued to the
University, but will have to furnish
his own uniform, and cannot be
counted in the strength of the organ
ization to which they may be at
tached.
This promise of material remunera
tion for continued service in the drill
work is expected to result in an in
crease of interest in military.
