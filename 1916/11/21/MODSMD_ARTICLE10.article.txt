### 
Tal Smith, '14, the promoter of the
Union Labor Day, announces that the
preparations are complete and every
thing is in readiness for the mem
bers of the Union and all interested
Stanford men to start work on the
lawn, tomorrow morning.
The grounds have been plowed,
black dirt has been carted in, and
the work is not to be heavy but will
consist, of smoothing the ground and
seeding it. As many men as possible
are wanted to come out during their
spare hours in the morning, and every
body is expected out in the afternoon.
The volunteer workmen are to bring
their own implements, where possible,
but there will also be the shovels,
hoes, and rakes of the University for
those without tools.
W. Gilroy, '17, is assisting Smith
and is the recruiting agent. Miss Vaal
Stark, '17, will have charge of a group
of Women's Club House members who
will pass out sandwiches and coffce to
the men as their share in getting the
neutral ground between the Club
House and the Union planted to grass.
In order to avoid paths across the
grass and "Keep Off the Grass" signs,
gravel paths will be made where there
is traffic. Directly in front of the
Union building will be a gravel court
with a grass plot around the trees.
