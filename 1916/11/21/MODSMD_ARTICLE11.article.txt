In rare instances the public is per
mitted to open its purse strings for
tho benefit of a worthy cause and simul
taneously receive any material ad
vantages from said act of generosity.
Usually it is forced to contribute with
that same spirit of fortitudinous af
fection which shrouds Yule-tide gifts
to cantankerous relatives—a duty that
must be borne in silent suffering.
Bearing in mind the petulance of
human nature, the San Francisco and
campus divisions of the Auxiliary to
the Stanford Clinics —a splendid
humanitarian service of the Univer
sity—present an opportunity to Stan
ford men and women to entertain
themselves and their friends with a
whirlwind, roaring comedy Monday
evening in the Assembly Hall, the pro
ceeds of the performance going to the
maintenance of University Clinics at
the Lane Hospital.

Those individuals who have only a
hazy notion of the great undertaking
carried on in conjunction with the
Medical School, might gain an added
feeling of pride in their University, if
they could but secure a dim insight
into the invaluable social service
rendered. Annually close to fifty
thousand poverty-stricken patients,
sufferers from disease or malnutrition,
unable to obtain medical assistance on
account of paucity of finances, are
cared for gratuitously or at nominal
charge. Hundreds, whose lives are
brightened with but scant sunshine,
have been enabled to transform their
hum-drum existence and proceed with
a lighter heart. West of Chicago, the
Stanford Clinic of the Lane Hospital
owned by the University—has no rival
—standing foremost in the field of
public benefactors.

A crowded house should greet Mon
day evening's production of the famous
Belasco comedy, "The Concert," which
is replete both with humor and sen
sation, and played by a clever cast.
Tomorrow noon's seat sale should
present a quite accurate estimate of
the interest evinced by the University
in its most commendable and thor
oughly human enterprise.
