## 
### 
Leo N. Jones, who while posing as
a Stanford student, has been looting
telephone coin boxes in Palo Alto, on
the campns, and other peninsula
points, was taken into custody yester
day near University Junction. He was
trailed by Merna Wilkes, daughter of
the proprietor of the Palo Alto Hotel,
whore Jones made his last attempt.
Jones may have been a clever looter,
but that he knew little of the class he
imitated, and less of Stanford men,
is evidenced by the fact that he is
described as a "well dressed stranger."
and then again, as wearing "his
clothes in a manner typical of a col
lege student." He was generally
taken to be a college student in the
towns along the Peninsula, and be
cause Jones' disguise was successful,
reflection is cast on the knowledge of
Peninsulans regarding the Stanford
rough.
