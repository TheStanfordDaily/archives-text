Stanford University, Nov. 21.
Dearest Ma. It is out at last —the
mvstery of the peculiar tingling in
the atmosphere. The faculty has been
praying—they set up a chain of
prayer around the Quad, and today
Dr. Wilbur, after feeling the pulse
of the situation and diagnosing the
case as gasolinicus disturbius, dis
placed the chain of prayer with a
chain of steel. The Quad is now as
inaccessible by auto as the inside of a
cigarette by a street-car. Before one
may enter the sacred precincts he
must raise his right hand and swear
upon bound volumes of Dr. Price's
Almanac and the Mayfleld Weakly
Busrle that he has studied the assign
ment diligently, and is not going to
the library to make a date.
The faculty chain today reminded
me of the chain that the old Turks
put across the Hellespont to keep out
the Creek submarines B4 and U2. The
way the Engineers and other brows
hung catsup bottles, old clothes, tin
cans, pictures, and other relics of the
San Francisco and Alpha Phi fires on
the chains, and the way they hung
around the chain themselves hooting
at the women who were afraid to pass
through their "ranks," looked like
grammar school and kindergarten in
the middle ages.
Tt was just an Pop the Shoeshiner
said: "They needed them chains, they
d'd. Autos have no risrht to go scootin'
past the Quad drowning out the noise
thSt. the electric riveter on the new
museum is making'."
T want you to come up her on
ITenrv Ford's birthday—they're going
to let down the chain then. Much
love, your SONNY.
