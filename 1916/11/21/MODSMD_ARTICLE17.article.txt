# FAR NORTH TOLD OF BY G.A. CLARK
## 
### 
G. A. Clark, Stanford Academic Sec
retary, gave an interesting lecture on
his travels in Alaska in connection
with the work of the seal commission,
of which Dr. David Starr Jordan was
the head, before the Cosmopolitan
Club, in room 50, last night.
Mr. Clark has made several trips to
the far north, and recounted many in
teresting experiences of his own, as
well as some stories of Dr. Jordan in
the far north.
The Alaska seals are not common
seals but bear-seals, according to Clark.
They have much longer foreflippers
than the true Labrador seals. These
valuable animals are rapidly decreas
ing in number, and in 1912 there were
only 22,000 in the Alaska rookeries, as
compared to 50,000 in 189G. The birds,
walruses and other animals of the
northern clime came in for a good
deal of attention.
