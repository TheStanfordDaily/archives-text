# Interfraternity and Club Rugby Starts
## Alpha Delta Phi-Zeta Psi Team Defeats Opponents in Close Contest 
### 
Interfraternity and interclub rugby
was started with a rush yesterday af
ternoon, two games being played on
the varsity and auxiliary fields. The
Zeta Psi-Alplia Delta Phi fifteen de
feated the Delta Tau Delta-Alpha Tau
Omega team by a G to 0 score, while
the Kappa Sigma-El Toro squad
swamped the Phi Gamma Delta-El
Campo ruggers by a 20 to 0 count.
The first game was played on the
varsity turf and developed some ex
cellent rugby. Both teams fought
from the start and were evenly
matched. The play surged from one
end of the field to the other, neither
side being able to carry the ball over
for a try. Cass scored the six points
for the winners, planting two drop
kicks between the posts on penalties.
Henry, Single, Chandler, Gladstone,
Lachmund, Dickey, Swarts, Duddelson,
Williams, Clark, Adams, Sayre and
Templeton featured the contest by
clever plays.
With Ponney playing a star game,
assisted by Townsend, Wheatly, Camp
bell, Rogers and Bihlman, the Kappa
Sigma-El Toro combination swept,
their opponents off their feet. Touch
judges, time-keepers, and a referee
seemed to be a minus quantity, but the
play proceeded just the same. The
winning fifteen had a strong aggre-
gation, while the losers were weak
ened by the absence of several of their
best players. Davis and Righter
played well for the Phi Gamma Delta-
El Campo squad.
This afternoon, the Phi Kappa Psi-
Pine Cottage team meets the Sigma
Nu-Phi Kappa Sigma fifteen, and the
Phi Delta Theta and Breakers com
bination takes on the Beta Theta Pi-
Kappa Alpha aggregation. Both games
should result in good rugby.
The final winners of the interfra
ternity-interclub series will be pre
sented with the Timothy Hopkins cup.
Victors Hold Rally.
Waking the campus at 11 o'clock
last night, the members of Zeta Psi
and Alpha Delta Phi conducted a rally
celebrating their victory of the after
noon. They paraded the Row and
stopped at the Alpha Tau Omega and
Delta Tau Delta houses to give yells
for the opposing football teams.
