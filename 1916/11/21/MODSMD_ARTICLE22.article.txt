# Mr. Bean's Campus Popularity Declines
## High Prices Responsible for Disappearance of Old Standby 
### 
The bean is not the popular fellow
that he used to be, on Sunday nights
and other occasions. Whether his de
cline in popularity has been the sig
nal for joy or sorrow is questionable,
but there's a tragedy in the disappear
ance of the bean. He is now worth
nearly 100 per cent more than at this
time one year ago. Campus cooks
have been unable to keep up with
Mr. Bean's rapid rise.
Managers Face Problem.
With quotations of practically all
foodstuffs constantly on the increase,
and with prevailing prices for some
commodities greater by 97 per cent
than one year ago, campus culinary
artists, house and restaurant man
agers, are face to face with the great
est problem that has yet confronted
them. How to keep up quality and
quantity without raising prices is the
all-important puzzle.
Flour as listed yesterday stood at
$9.40, an increase of 57 per cent in
the past twelve months. Bread has
risen 25 per cent within the fortnight.
As quoted yesterday fresh eggs were
at 57 cents per dozen. Storage eggs
could be bought for 34 cents. Best
hams cannot be purchased for less
than 29% cents per pound raw, or 31
cents boiled. Low grade ham may be
had for 14 cents.
