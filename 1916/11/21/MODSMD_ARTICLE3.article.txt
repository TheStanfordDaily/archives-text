# Women Probe .. .. Mystery of .. ... Missing Day
## 
### 
Stanford women became book
keepers yesterday. At the insti
gation of Miss Mary Pope, secre
tary of the Y. W. C. A., they took
niion themselves the task of
watching their own steps until
next Monday. Upon the printed
forms each woman is to record
what she does each five minutes
of the day. It is believed that the
results computed will afford in
teresting information as to just
how college women employ their
time. Tn addition to offering
statistics concerning the women
as a whole, it is believed that the
scheme will offer each member of
the "500" opportunity to find out
exactly what use she is making of
her time.
According to a sample computa
tion, in sleeping, studying, eating,
telephoning, attending classes,
gossiping, riding, walking, amus
ing and being amused, the average
woman will spend 147V& hours.
Inasmuch as each week contains
IGB hours, there remain 20-)4 un
accounted hours per week, or
2 9-10 per day. Tt is to explore
the mysteries of these unaccounted
hours, and to fathom the swallow
ing of almost a day each week by
the whirlpool of time, that the Y.
W. C. A. is converting students in
to bookkeepers.
