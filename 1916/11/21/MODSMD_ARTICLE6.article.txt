Low Kates Here.
Peninsula patrons will pay $3 per
seat for"The Concert," in San Mateo.
Inasmuch as pasteboards are at prem
ium, and the Stanford public is being
accorded rates of BO cents, 75 cents
and one dollar, ticket sellers are al
ready feeling the pressure of a heavy
demand. Twelve hundred seats are
now in circulation.
Rehearsals, which are being held
every afternoon and evening under the
direction of Frank Mathieu, have re
vealed the fact that Ditrichstein's ver
sion of the typical Hungarian story is
American in snap and vigor. Three
acts, with but one shift of scenery
promise a quick-flowing evening of
drama.
