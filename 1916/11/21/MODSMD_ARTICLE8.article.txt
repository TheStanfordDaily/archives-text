# Rooting Section Is Provided for Debate
## Stanford to Meet U.S.C. in Big Forensic Battle Tomorrow Evening 
### 
A rooting section, with Assistant
Yell Leader R. R. Speers, '18, in
charge, will feature tomorrow night's
debate with the University of Southern
California. Greater interest is being
shown on the part of the Stanford
public in the IT. S. C. debate than in
any previous forensic contest.
Compulsory Training Question.
Compulsory military training—the
question to be discussed—is the big
issue before Congress at present, and
the debaters have studied the issues
involved extensively. 1 ioth teams are
evenly matched, with 11. S. C. having
a slight advantage.
Two-IMis \dniission.
An admission fee of twenty-five
cents will be charged tomorrow eve
ning, the object being to make de
bating self-supporting, as at other
universities. If the right kind of sup
port is given at tomorrow night's
platform battle, debates witji Har
vard, Wisconsin, Michigan and Minne
sota will be made possible. Harvard
has already approved the idea in its
tentative form.
A feature of the ,U. S. C. contest to
morrow night is the presence of a
woman on the squad, it having been
a decade or more since a Stanford
woman has made a varsity debating
team. Miss Margaret C. Shedd, '20, F.
S. Field, '18, and W. I. Ames, '18, are
the members of the trio to meet V. C.
Perkins, '17, W. T. Watson, '17, and
A. W. Wendt, '17, of the University
of Southern California.
Friday evening, in San Francisco,
H. C. Blote, '18, G. J. Knight, '19, and
D. W. Evans, '20, of Stanford, will op
pose the University of California in
a "no-decision" debate.
