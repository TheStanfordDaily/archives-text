Three games on the local floor and
four away from home for the varsity,
is the schedule announced today for
the Intercollegiate Basketball League
of California and Nevada. The list
includes contests with Santa Clara,
St. Ignatius, St. Mary's, University of
California, Davis Farm School, College
of Pacific, and University of Nevada.
The schedule seems to favor the
Cardinal, since the California game
will be played at home, as will the
contest with the fast University of
Nevada five. These two teams caused
the varsity more trouble than any
others in the league last year, and
home games with them should be a
boost for basketball this year.
Arrange Extra Games.
Tn addition to the regular league
games a contest has been scheduled
with Santa Clara for February 10, on
the Encina floor. Several other off
schedule games will be arranged for
the varsity and a complete program
will be drawn up for the freshmen,
second varsity and third varsity
teams, and will be announced soon.
The first game for the interclass
title will be run off Monday, when the
freshmen and sophomores meet. The
juniors and seniors will play Tuesday
for the upperclass championship and
the winners will fight for the class
trophy after the Thanksgiving vaca
tion.
