Three games on the local floor and
four away from home for the varsity,
is the schedule announced today for
the Intercollegiate Basketball League
of California and Nevada. The list
includes contests with Santa Clara,
St. Ignatius, St. Mary's, University of
California, Davis Farm School, College
of Pacific, and University of Nevada.
The schedule seems to favor the
Cardinal, since the California game
will be played at home, as will the
contest with the fast University of
Nevada five. These two teams caused
the varsity more trouble than any
others in the league last year, and
home games with them should be a
boost for basketball this year.
Arrange Extra Games.
Tn addition to the regular league
games a contest has been scheduled
with Santa Clara for February 10, on
the Encina floor. Several other off
schedule games will be arranged for
the varsity and a complete program
will be drawn up for the freshmen,
second varsity and third varsity
teams, and will be announced soon.
The first game for the interclass
title will be run off Monday, when the
freshmen and sophomores meet. The
juniors and seniors will play Tuesday
for the upperclass championship and
the winners will fight for the class
trophy after the Thanksgiving vaca
tion.
Several stars have shown up in each
class during the interfraternity-inter-
club scries and some fast games should
result in the interclass contests. The
fight for the trophy seems to lie be
tween the seniors and sophomores
from results so far. The 1919 men
who have shown well are Bonney, the
star of the interclub series, Pelouze
and Righter. The seniors have Cap
tain Wheatly, Lytle, and several other
men who have shown up well during
preliminary games.
Freshmen Are Strong.
Evidences are at present that the
freshmen will have a strong team.
Bucklin is one of the best forwards
that has been seen on the local floor,
while Joerg and Hood have shown to
advantage in preliminary games. The
1920 five defeated San Jose Normal,
Friday, 38 to 17, in a practice game,
and showed that some good playing
can be expected from them.
In preparation for the class games
the freshmen and sophomores are
practicing Monday and Wednesday
nights, while the juniors and seniors
have the floor on Tuesday and Thurs
day. The other nights are given over
to practice games.

San Jose.

Three games on the local floor and
four away from home for the varsity,
is the schedule announced today for
the Intercollegiate Basketball League
of California and Nevada. The list
includes contests with Santa Clara,
St. Ignatius, St. Mary's, University of
California, Davis Farm School, College
of Pacific, and University of Nevada.
The schedule seems to favor the
Cardinal, since the California game
will be played at home, as will the
contest with the fast University of
Nevada five. These two teams caused
the varsity more trouble than any
others in the league last year, and
home games with them should be a
boost for basketball this year.
Arrange Extra Games.
Tn addition to the regular league
games a contest has been scheduled
with Santa Clara for February 10, on
the Encina floor. Several other off
schedule games will be arranged for
the varsity and a complete program
will be drawn up for the freshmen,
second varsity and third varsity
teams, and will be announced soon.
The first game for the interclass
title will be run off Monday, when the
freshmen and sophomores meet. The
juniors and seniors will play Tuesday
for the upperclass championship and
the winners will fight for the class
trophy after the Thanksgiving vaca
tion.
Several stars have shown up in each
class during the interfraternity-inter-
club scries and some fast games should
result in the interclass contests. The
fight for the trophy seems to lie be
tween the seniors and sophomores
from results so far. The 1919 men
who have shown well are Bonney, the
star of the interclub series, Pelouze
and Righter. The seniors have Cap
tain Wheatly, Lytle, and several other
men who have shown up well during
preliminary games.
Freshmen Are Strong.
Evidences are at present that the
freshmen will have a strong team.
Bucklin is one of the best forwards
that has been seen on the local floor,
while Joerg and Hood have shown to
advantage in preliminary games. The
1920 five defeated San Jose Normal,
Friday, 38 to 17, in a practice game,
and showed that some good playing
can be expected from them.
In preparation for the class games
the freshmen and sophomores are
practicing Monday and Wednesday
nights, while the juniors and seniors
have the floor on Tuesday and Thurs
day. The other nights are given over
to practice games.
