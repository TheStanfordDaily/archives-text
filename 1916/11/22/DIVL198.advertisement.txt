TO WHOM IT MAV CONCERN
PRICES ARE MOVING HEAVENWARD. IT'S A
HARD FIGHT, BUT STANFORD INN IS HANGING
ON. STANFORD INN CONTINUES TO USE ONLY
THE REST IN MEATS, VEGETABLES AND OTHER
COMMODITIES.
QUALITY AND QUANTITY REMAIN CONSTANT.
THERE HAS BEEN NO RAISE IN PRICES BUT
WE WERE FORCED TO LOWER MEAL-TICKET
DISCOUNT 5% â€”A CHANGE THAT YOU WILL
HARDLY FEEL BUT WHICH MAKES A WORLD
OF DIFFERENCE TO US.
THE INN 15 STILL THE PLACE TO EAT
