# Benefit Soccer With California Saturday
## Victory for Cardinal in Second Game With Bears Means 1916 Championship 
### 
Soccer football between Stanford
and California will be Saturday after
noon's attraction. Cardinal soccer
men defeated the Blue and Gold eleven
last Saturday after a hard struggle,
and the game this week is expected
to be harder. This contest Saturday
is the second of a series of three and
in case Stanford wins will decide the
1916 championship. The game will be
called at 3.
Twenty-five cents admission fee will
be required. An important feature, how
ever, is that a percentage of the gate
receipts will be turned over to the
local branch of the Auxiliaries to the
Stanford Clinics. Due to this and also
to the caliber of soccer offered, the
bleachers should be well filled.
Coach Harry Maloney states that
the Cardinal squad Is in good condi
tion and that they hope for victory.
Overconfidence is something that does
not have to be feared, however, for
the Stanford men realize that they are
up against the fastest soccer team ever
turned out by the Bears.
