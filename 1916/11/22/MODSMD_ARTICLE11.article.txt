# Hungarian Drama Too Modern for Student Playing
## 
### 
Monday evening is to see a rare
brand of charitable entertainment in
the Assembly Hall, when society folk
of peninsula towns present Ditrlch
stein's romantic comedy, "The Con
cert."
Charity productions do not come
under the category of few and far be
tween, but according to those well
acquainted with the players now re
hearsing under Frank Mathieu, it is
seldom and very far between that real
acting ability, of professional stand
ard, couples itself with benefit dra
matics.
Secondly, only the light of a blue
moon sees a comedy on the order of
"The Concert." Putting it frankly, as
one enthusiastic drama-fan remarked,
it is fortunate that "grown-ups" are
giving the campus and Palo Alto pub
lic opportunity to view this comedy.
Tt is evident that the powers that
be would not permit students to re
hearse a drama as essentially "mod
ern" is Ditrichstein's Hungarian
rhapsody.
