# CRACK DEBATERS U.S.C.
## CLOSE FIGHT TONIGHT Discussion of Adoption of Swiss Military System Expected to Thrill Hearers 
### 
Stanford clashes with the University
of Southern California in the Assem
bly Hall this evening at 8 o'clock, in
what promises to be the most exciting
debate in which Stanford has partici
pated for a number of years. To
night's debate will be full of thrills,
not only because of the fact that the
teams are exceedingly evenly matched,
but because the subject is one of the
most intense interest at the present
time.
Itecord Crowd Anticipated.
It is expected that a majority of the
student body will turn out to tonight's
debate. It is understood that almost
without exception every man enrolled
in military training will be present.
Adoption of the Swiss system of
military training by the United States
is the question to be debated. Stan
ford has the negative against the U. S.
C., the team being composed of Miss
Margaret C. Shedd, '20, F. S. Field, '18,
and W. I. Ames, '18. U. S. C.'s af
firmative trio consists of V. D. Per
kins, W. T. Watson, and A. W. Wendt,
all seniors.
Woman on Card Trio.
Field and Ames for Stanford are
both veterans from last year's Tri-
State teams. Miss Shedd, the first
woman in years to make a Stanford
debating varsity, proved herself the
best high school debater in the state
last year by winning the California
High School League championship.
Professor W. H. Carruth, head of
the English department, will act as
chairman this evening. Judge John E.
Richards of the appellate bench of
San Francisco, attorney Samuel G.
Tompkins of San Jose, and William A.
Morris, a Stanford graduate, now pro
fessor of History at the University of
California, will judge the debate.
Music for the evening will be furn
ished by the University Orchestra, un
der the direction of M. Blumenthal,
'16. Yells will be furnished by a root
ing section under the charge of As
sistant Yell Leader R. R. Speers, *18.
Debaters and officials will be guests
of Delta Sigma Rho, debating honor
fraternity, after the contest, at a ban
quet given in the Delta Kappa Epsilon
house.
An admission fee of twenty-five
cents will be charged at the debate to
night, in order to make the debate
self-supporting. If a big attendance
tonight makes it apparent that de
bating can be made a self-supporting
activity, debates are possible in the
near future with the best schools of
the country, including Harvard, Wis
consin, Michigan, and Minnesota.
Friday evening, the Stanford af
firmative team, made up of H. C.
Blote, '18, G. J. Knight, '19, and D. W.
Evans, '20, meets the University of
California in the Knights of Columbus
auditorium, San Francisco, on the
same question.
In accordance with the suggestion
of the U. C. debating committee, the
new "no-decision' plan will be tried
out in this "contest." There will be
no judges, but instead it is the plan
to have some prominent man deliver
his opinion on the question at the end
of the debate. As yet California has
not secured the "prominent man."
