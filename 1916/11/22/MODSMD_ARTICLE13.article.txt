Stanford clashes with the University

what promises to be the most exciting
debate in which Stanford has partici

student body will turn out to tonight's
debate. It is understood that almost
without exception every man enrolled
in military training will be present.
Adoption of the Swiss system of
military training by the United States
is the question to be debated. Stan
ford has the negative against the U. S.

all seniors.
Woman on Card Trio.
Field and Ames for Stanford are
both veterans from last year's Tri-
State teams. Miss Shedd, the first
woman in years to make a Stanford
debating varsity, proved herself the
best high school debater in the state
last year by winning the California
High School League championship.
