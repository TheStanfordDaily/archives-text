# SHOW SPEED IN TROPHY SERIES
## Phi Delt- Breakers and Phi Psi-Pine Cottage Teams Win in Rugby Play 
### 
Two more rugby teams were elim
inated yesterday afternoon in the in
terfraternity and interclub football
series. The combined squad of Beta
Tlieta Pi and Kappa Alpha fell before
tbe Plii Delta Theta-Breakers com
bination by a 17 to 0 score, while the
Phi Kappa Psi-Pine Cottage fifteen
were victors over the Sigma Nu-Phi
Kappa Sigma ruggers, taking a close
game by a 3 to 0 count.
Plii-Dclt-Breakcr Team Strong.
The former contest showed the best
rugby, although the final score was
lop-sided, especially so considering
the fact that the halves were only
twenty-fifteen. Either Phi Delta
Theta or the Breakers Club would
have good fifteens alone, and com
bined together, they form a team hard
to beat. Their passing rushes are ex
cellent and the play of the forwards
is fast at all times. Hayes, Schwar
zenbek, Grave, West, Marriott and
Meese were the best of this squad
yesterday, while Larkin, Barneson,
Kyle, Murray, Pettlngill and Pieven
dorff starred for the losers.
I*lii I'sis Win Close Game.
In the game played on the auxiliary
i field the play surged back and forth,
the final result being in doubt until
the last. Jay Risling, playing as a
freelance, was the star of the win
ners. Captain Braden, Ham, Fisher,
Cameron and Wayland were the best
players of this team, while Pelouze,
Hobbs, Montgomery, Smith, Gibson and
Seeley starred for the losers.
Final games in the preliminary
round of the interfraternity, inter
club rugby series are being played off
this afternoon, when Sigma Alpha Ep
silons and Chi Psis unite against
Delta Kappa Epsilon and Theta Delta
Chi, and Theta Xi andDelta Upsilon
play Sigma Chi and Delta Chi.
This year the winner of the inter
fraternity-club series will be allowed
to have possession of the Timothy
Hopkins rugby trophy for the year,
each of the two victorious houses
probably keeeping the cup a semester.
