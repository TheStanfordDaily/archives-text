series. The combined squad of Beta

Plii-Dclt-Breakcr Team Strong.
The former contest showed the best
rugby, although the final score was
lop-sided, especially so considering
the fact that the halves were only

have good fifteens alone, and com
bined together, they form a team hard
to beat. Their passing rushes are ex

is fast at all times. Hayes, Schwar
zenbek, Grave, West, Marriott and
Meese were the best of this squad
yesterday, while Larkin, Barneson,
Kyle, Murray, Pettlngill and Pieven
dorff starred for the losers.
