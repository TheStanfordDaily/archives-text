# Symphony Orchestra Meets With Approval
## 
### 
Members of the Palo Alto Sym
phony Orchestra gave their first con
cert of the year in the Asssembly Hall
last night, assisted by Mrs. Leonard
Ely, who sang three solos in German
from compositions by Schubert.
The largest audience that has at
tended a concert this year was pres
ent and fully enjoyed the two over
tures and two symphonies by the or
chestra in addition to the songs by
Mrs. Ely. An overture by Beethoven
was the first number rendered, the
second being the famous "Unfinished"
Symphony by Schubert, the third a
symphony from Beethoven, and the
last the "Rosemunde" overture by
Schubert.
