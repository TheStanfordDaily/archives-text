Union Labor Day was a success
—so says Tal Smith, manager.
Beginning early in the morning,
sod and rocks flew right and left,
and the lawn, long needed in front
of the Union and the Women's
Club House, began to take shape,
as students, professors, visitors,
graduate managers, athletes and
everyone forsook their customary
haunts to man shovels, wheel
barrows, hoes, rakes, and other
farm implements.
Truly, Stanford men can be
farmers when they need to.
Women of the Club House were
on the job early in the forenoon
with a spread of sandwiches,
cookies, coffee, and other edibles
furnished by the different soror
ities of the campus. Said sand
wiches disappeared continually
before the appetites stimulated by
pick and shovel work.
