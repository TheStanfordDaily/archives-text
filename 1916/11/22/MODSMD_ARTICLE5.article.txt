# Rugby Games Slated for Thanksgiving Day
## 
### 
Arrangements have been completed
whereby three Stanford rugby teams
will play away from home on Thanks
giving Day. Freshmen will journey
to Stockton, where they line up against
the Stockton high school fifteen.
Third varsity men will make a trip
to Chico to play the Chico high squad.
Coach "Dutch" Henry has his
"babes" out practicing regularly and
expects to have a speedy lineup when
they tackle the Stockton ruggers.
