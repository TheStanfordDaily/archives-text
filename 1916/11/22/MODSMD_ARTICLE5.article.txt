# Rugby Games Slated for Thanksgiving Day
## 
### 
Arrangements have been completed
whereby three Stanford rugby teams
will play away from home on Thanks
giving Day. Freshmen will journey
to Stockton, where they line up against
the Stockton high school fifteen.
Third varsity men will make a trip
to Chico to play the Chico high squad.
Coach "Dutch" Henry has his
"babes" out practicing regularly and
expects to have a speedy lineup when
they tackle the Stockton ruggers.
Amos Elliott, former Blue and Gold
backfleld star and captain of the 1911
varsity, is coach of the Stockton fif
teen. This squad has won the cham
pionship of the San Joaquin Valley
federation and are a fast team.
Chico High has a fairly strong fif
teen and expects to give the third var
sity men a struggle. The game is
being well advertised there and an
exceptionally large crowd will be on
hand.
Late this afternoon, a game was
scheduled for the second varsity at
Woodland. Graduate Manager Beh
rens will probably take along about
20 men for the team. Woodland has
one of the hardest tackling fifteens
that have appeared on the Stanford
turf this season and second varsity
men look for a warm contest.
