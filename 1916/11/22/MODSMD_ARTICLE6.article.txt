### 
Programs for the Sophomore Cotil
lion will he distributed at Wideman's
campus store, Friday, was the an
nouncement made today by the com
mittee in charge of the dance. They
will be exchanged for tickets that
have already been secured. Taxis
and flowers are absolutely taboo as
in former years. If women are found
wearing flowers they will be re
quested to remove them.
In order to facilitate regular car
service two extra cars will leave the
bookstore, the first between 8 and
8:10, and the second between 8:10 and
8:20. These two cars will make the
use of taxis unnecessary.
Decorations for the cotillion will be
put up Thursday and Friday after
noons, arid every sophomore is re
quested to be at Encina gymnasium
one of those days, and both if pos
sible.
Dancing will begin promptly at 8:30
and will end at 1.
