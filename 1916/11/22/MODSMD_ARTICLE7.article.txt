# RIFLES FOR DRILL CORPS ARRIVE ON CAMPUS
## TO BEGIN USE FRIDAY Will Take Up Manual of Arms Trustees May Buy Uniforms 
### 
Three hundred Krag rifles arrived
at Stanford yesterday afternoon for
the use of the Department of Military
Science and Tactics. The work of
cleaning and oiling the guns will take
quite a little time, so they will not
be available for use in drill until Fri
day afternoon at least.
Manual of Arms Next.
Training in the manual of arms
will be the next thing the military
classes will take up, and proficiency
in this will determine to a consider
able extent the comparative standings
of the four companies in the next
competitive drill at the end of the
semester.
At present the men are still prac
ticing battalion movements without
arms.
Major Bugge has selected as a site
for the rifle pits to be constructed
next semester, a location in the little
valley to the southwest of the cam
pus near Frenchman's Dam. Later
on IJ. S. rifles of the latest make, one
for every fifteen men in the corps,
will be ordered for the target practice.
Whether or not the University will
purchase the uniforms for the men
taking military will be decided at the
monthly meeting of the Board of
Trustees, Friday afternoon, in San
Francisco.
Although Congress had passed legis
lation authorizing the issuance of uni
forms to military corps in universi
ties, no appropriation has yet been
passed to cover the cost of the suits.
If the University bought the equip
ment now, it would probably be reim
bursed by a special appropriation
during the next session of Congress.
Work has started in the north locker
room of the Encina gymnasium on the
storeroom and armory which will con
tain the guns, ammunition and other
supplies of the Department of Mili
tary Science and Tactics.
