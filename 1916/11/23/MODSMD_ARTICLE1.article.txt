# MILITARY MEN ADOPT THREEFOLD PLEDGE
## TO SIGN CONTRACT Reserve Officers Take Oath of Honor in University and Drill 
### 
"Honor, —Loyalty—Patriotism" is
the three-fold motto adopted by the
"Reserve Officers' Training Corps,"
which is made up of practically the
entire present enrollment in military
drill. A declaration has been drawn
up embodying the principles of the
corps, and every man of the corps
has signified his intention to sign it.
All who put their names to this
document bind themselves to the honor
system, not only in the military work,
but in all other University work and
in all other activities and actions.
The motto, in terms of conduct, is in
terpreted as "To be honarable in
everything we do; to be loyal to our
selves and to all superiors; to revere
our flag and all it stands for."
Following is the declaration which
in the future must be signed by every
student who joins the Stanford unit
of the Oflicers' Reserve Training
Corps;
Will Further Patriotism.
"We, the undersigned, hereby pledge
our selves that we will do all in our
power to further the movement for
the development of an efficient na
tional patriotism in the United States.
We adopt the following declaration,
to which we promise to adhere in the
letter and the spirit.
"1. Believing that good citizenship
means love of country, and veneration
of the democratic institutions which
we may be called upon to protect with
our lives, we agree to do all in our
power to create a greater respect of
the American Hag.
"2. Intelligent obedience being the
most important quality which goes
toward the making of a good soldier,
we bind ourselves to abide faithfully
by such rules of discipline as may be
promulgated by the proper authority,
to obey and respect our officers as
such, and to devote seriously that
time scheduled for military training,
to the study and practice of the sci
ence.
"3. Realizing that self-imposed re
straint is the perfection of discipline
and that self-control is a fundamental
requisite to the ability to control
others, and that the development of
character is a prime necessity among
men who may be called upon to pro
tect the nation, we pledge ourselves
to promote and abide by an inflexible
principle of honor in our relations
with our fellows. With due apprecia
tion of the duty of a soldier to his of
ficers, and the responsibility of an of
ficer for the lives of his men —on
which is based the effectiveness and
morale of the service—we will con
sider it a matter of discipline and of
personal honor to report to the proper
authority any cases of cheating or
other dishonesty associated with the
actions of any member of the Stan
ford unit. We also believe that any
member who has signed this declara
tion, and who thereafter is found
guilty by court-martial of cheating, or
of other conduct unbecoming an of

ficer and gentleman, in this or any
other department of the University,
should be dismissed from the service
unless he resigns of his own volition.
We believe these things to be the
duties of honorable citizenship and
social responsibility, and of service to
the maintenance of the integrity of the
Stanford unit."
