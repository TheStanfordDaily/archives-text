# UNITED STATES' MISSION IS FAR EAST LIBERTY
## NATIONALITY NEEDED Bishop Brent Says Philippines Must Be Educated for Self-Government 
### 
"United States is the greatest na
tional experiment the world has ever
seen," Bishop Charles H. Brent,
"the most loved man in the Philip
pines," told a Stanford audience this
morning in the Assembly Hall.
Bishop Brent spoke to a limited audi
ence on "America's National Mission."
America's Mission.
America's national mission, as
Bishop Brent sees it, is to educate the
Philippinos for national liberty, and
place them in the position now held
by Cubans. Bishop Brent believes that
the Philippines are not ready for In
dependence and liberty until they are
able to take over the responsibilities
as well as the pleasures. The tend
ency to "speed up" the Philippino ed
ucation advocated by many Americans
is bad. according to Bishop Brent.
The Nation a Trust.
Describing the qualities that make
up nationality, Bishop Brent said:
"The nation comes to us as a trust
to develop and care for. The nation
is a corporate personality. I would
say the nation is a person. The ob
ject of national life is to create out
of many conflicting elements a group
personality.
"A nation must become a personal
itv by self-unifiCation. The United
States is the greatest national experi
ment the world has ever known. One
of the greatest tasks today is to
achieve coherence. Nationality is not
a matter of chance of birth. It must
always be a matter of choice. If a
man cannot be loyal to the nation in
which he is born he is duty bound to
find one he can be loyal to.
"Every nation must have a char
acteristic of its own. Ours is liberty.
Our foundations were laid in the desire
to achieve religious liberty, afterwards
there came political and personal lib
erty. Now we are striving for indi
vidual and social liberty. We have
only begun to learn what liberty is.
"Liberty is not the power to do as
we like. It is the power to do more
as we don't likeâ€”and it takes more
the man to do that.
