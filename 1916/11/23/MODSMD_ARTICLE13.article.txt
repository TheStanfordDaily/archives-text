# Union Promises a "Dance de Luxe"
## Glee Club Quartet Secured for Entertainment Between Dance Sectiyns 
### 
"Dance de Luxe" is the title which
the Union dance committee has decided
to use to designate the character of
the evening arranged for next Wed
nesday, Thanksgiving eve. All ef
forts are being centered upon making
this second Union affair all that the
name implies.
Arrangements have been completed
to bring the Glee Club quartet before
the dancers during intermission, with
a program of favorite harmony. It is
believed this attraction will be an
other point added to the already long
list of features which make Union
dances rare affairs.
Plenty of snappy bang-bang music
has been leased for the occasion, with
J. T. Reynolds, '18, slated to sit be
fore the elephant tusks.
Programs will be ready Monday at
the Union cigar stand.
