# dishonorable honor
## 
### 
Stanford's Officer Reserve Corps
has come out flat-footedly for the
adoption of the honor system, em
bodying in its initial pledge for mem
bership commendable and practical
rules for strict enforcement through
out every sphere of the University.
Highly interesting to note is the wide
contrast evident in the Service, when
compared with the good intentioned
yet inconsistent attitude exhibited by
the usual faint-hearted supporters. In
the former case, one stumbles against
men trained to obedience, loyalty and
efficiency, while in the latter, the av
erage civil student shows an indecisive
tolerance of cheating.

Upon this principle of personal re
sponsibility rests the whole bulwark
of student government. Strange to say,
the large group of individuals voicing
enthusiasm for self-government and
extolling its virtues in reverent
terms, brazenly deliver their pet a
death-blow by failing to assume the
responsibilities necessitated.

Tn a similar spirit of honest right
eousness, students are wont to com
mend the honor system, fondly point
ing to the innumerable advantages
and improvement of the morale there
by gained. Yet when the psychological
moment arrives for displaying a bit
of backbone in enforcing the law, the
majority swallow their better dictates
without any qualms—maintaining a
purified aloofness.

Yesterday's firm stand- taken by
Stanford's soldiery cannot but prove a
significant step in the right direction,
the effect of which will become far
reaching. It would seem imperative
for the best interests of all concerned,
that the upperclassmen within every
department of the University should
adopt such an honor system—a gen
uine system that develops personal in
tegrity and self-control, and insures
a sheepskin of equitable, standard
value.
