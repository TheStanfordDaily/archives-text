down by an automobile driven by

Witnesses are of the opinion that
Mrs. Rouse, blinded by the headlights
of the oncoming machine, misjudged
its speed, and after waiting, attempted
to cross the street before the car had
completely passed. She was struck
on the knee by the rear fender, the
impact hurling both Mrs. Rouse and
her companion to the ground.
Examination at the Peninsula Hos

conveyed by Mrs. Hanna, disclosed no
serious consequences.
