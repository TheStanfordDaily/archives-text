# DEBATE WITH U.S.C. WON BY STANFORD
## BIG CROWD ATTENDS Miss Shedd's Refutation and Ames Rebuttal Too Much for Southerners 
### 
A sensational speech by Miss Mar
garet C. Sliedd, '20, followed by a
clinching negative rebuttal by W. T.
Ames, '18, won last night's debate
with the University of Southern Cali
fornia for Stanford. All indications
prior to the debate pointed to a U. S.
C. victory, and it was only in the
closing moments of the most thrill
ing debate in a number of years that
it became evident that Stanford had
the southerners out-argued.
The judges, the lion. John E. Rich
ards, appellate court judge, Samuel G.
Tompkins, prominent San Jose at
torney, and Professor W. A. Morris of
the University of California, gave
Stanford a 2 to 1 decision.
Iturden of Proof On IT.l T . S. C.
Stanford's negative speakers were
successful in putting the burden of
proof on the affirmative, and showed
conclusively that the U. S. C. trio had
failed to show that the United States
is in danger of war from any foreign
power; that they failed to prove the
Swiss system would be of benefit even
in case of war.
U. S. C. tried to demonstrate that
no one could tell whether or not the
United States was in danger of war,
and advanced five constructive argu
ments: First, that the adoption of a
sytem of compulsory military training
similar to that of Switzerland would
result in manhood and physical well
being of the United States; second,
that trade conditions of this nation
demand the adoption of this system;
third, that the present volunteer sys
tem is inefficient; fourth* that the
adoption of the Swiss system would
give the United States necessary mili
tary force, and last, that its adoption
would result in the peace of America
and of the world.
P. S. Field, '18, for Stanford, put
the burden of proof on the affirma
tive, pointed out that there were bet
ter methods to obtain physical train
ing than the Swiss compulsory mili
tary system, and showed that the
United States was in no danger of
war.
In the least effective speech of the
evening, W. T. Watson, of U. S. C.,
vainly endeavored to refute Field and
to show that the Swiss system pro
moted democracy. Watson had a fine
vocabulary but lacked force.
W. 1. Ames, '18, for Stanford, found
most of the weak places in Watson's
speech in a telling refutation, and
proved that it would be better to
change and improve the present army
system than to adopt the Swiss sys
tem. He defended the volunteer plan
in time of war.
A. W. Wendt, third affirmative or
ator, made the best showing for the
southern squad. His arguments and
presence were positive and he had
the audience convinced that the
adoption of the Swiss system would
make for United States and world
peace.
The audience's convictions promptly
changed when Miss Margaret C. Shedd,
'20, first woman to make a Cardinal
debating team in years, smashed his
arguments in a strong refutation.
Miss Shedd made an excellent im
pression, and presented some of the
best arguments of the evening, point
ing out many dangers that would re
sult from the Swiss system. She
proved that it would increase mili
tarism and would make labor condi
tions harder.
Professor W. 11. Carruth of the Eng
lish department acted as chairman.
Delta Sigma Rho, debating honor so
ciety, entertained debaters and judges
with a banquet at the Delta Kappa
Epsilon house, following the contest.
