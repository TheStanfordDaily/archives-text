###

Woman's dress should be in perfect
harmony with nature, says Madame
Vahmah, known in real life as Mrs.
Virginia House Chamberlain. To this

created, and copyrighted zodiacal
gowns.
"There are but twelve personalities
in the world," says Madame. "These
correspond to the twelve months of
the year. Three of the months be
long to each of the four elements, of
which the earth is composed."
Thus, it follows that women born in
the months of April, August and De
cember should wear red and its varie
gated tones, for these are the fire
months. May, September and January
are the earth elements, and people
born in these months should wear blue
tones, as yellow tones belong to the
water clement months, July, November
and March. Those born in .Tune, Oc
tober and February should wear
green, the color for the air element.
