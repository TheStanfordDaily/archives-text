# A 						BIG IDEA

Yesterday's announcement concern
ing the installation of a Stanford
Commons, an enterprise that will ac
commodate in the neighborhood of a
thousand patrons, should he hailed
with a smile of unmasked delight and
approval. Not until one fully grasps
the idealistic principles upon which
the proposed innovation is based, —
rock-bottom economy and first-class
rations —does the real significance of
the plan become apparent.

Ever since the pioneer days of the
University, the problem of providing
sustenance for the students not cared
for by eating clubs or fraternities
has proved an unsolvable riddle to the
authorities. To some extent the eat
ing difficulty was partially mitigated
by the establishment of two restaur
ants on the campus, yet frequent crit
icism has been voiced against insti
tuting a monopoly. Despite the fact
that these cafes provide hundreds of
meals daily, scores still find it neces
sary-to patronize Palo Alto and Col
lege Terrace establishments, while
numerous others are unable to meet
the Union or Inn prices.

The Stanford Commons should not
only prove an effective panacea for
the unsatisfactory conditions of the
present time, but should also prove an
important factor in the development
of a closer association between the
various units among the students. It
is to be hoped that the Tdoa once ex
pressed will in the very near future
be put into actual practice.
