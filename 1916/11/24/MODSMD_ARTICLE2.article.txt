Cardinal Well IJepresenled.
In past years the Cardinal lias been
well represented by a strong delega
tion of men interested in Christian af
fairs in universities, and Secretary J.
B. Watson is confident of an equal
representation this year. The student
conference held yearly at Asilomar is
a gathering of men from all colleges
of California, Nevada, and Arizona.
Similar conferences are held all over
the country for other colleges. The
California colleges holding member
ship in the conference, in addition to
Stanford, are the I'niversity of Cali
fornia, College of Pacific, U. S. C. (
Redlands, Pomona, and Whittier.
The conference offers great oppor
tunities for meeting men of other uni
versities and for assimilation of ideas.
Everywhere in the United States the
conferences have mot with groat ap
proval not only by men of religious
inclinations, but by others interested
in general welfare of universities, and
in getting a broader scope of college
life.
A good part of the time spent at
the conference is given over to recre
ation, athletics, hikes, swimming, and
other amusements, the site of the
meeting at Asilomar being one of the
most beautiful along the Pacific
Coast, owing to the rugged coast,
high waves and rocky shores.
Regular classes in social and relig
ious subjects are taught by well known
leaders from all parts of the United
States, among them Bishop W. M.
Bell, whom a well known insurance
company took across the continent to
speak to employees for twenty
minutes; Dr. James A. Francis, pastor
of the First Baptist Church in Los
Angeles; Dr. Katsuji Kato, well known
Japanese loader; "Bad" Elliott, for
mer football star, and a student sec
retary; William H. Lewis, a big busi
ness man of Seattle, and a number of
other prominent Y. M. C. A. men of
national repute.
Further information regarding the
student conference is available from
J. B. Watson, secretary of the local
Y. M. C. A., who has offices in the
Union.
