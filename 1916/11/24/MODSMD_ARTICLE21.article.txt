Members of the Resartus Club, the |
organization boosting for standard
ized dress for women, will meet at
the home of Miss Helen Sutliff, Mon
day afternoon at 3 o'clock, to consider
a number of simple styles that have
been submitted by modistes for ap
proval.
At the last meeting the Resartians
were unable to agree 011 any specific
dress, though in general a simple
style for morning, afternoon, and eve- j
ning wear submitted by a San Fran
cisco designer, met with considerable
approval.
Mrs. John S. P. Tatloclc, president
of the Resartus Club, has extended an
invitation to all women of Palo Alto
and the campus who are interested in
the standardized dress movement, to
attend the meeting. Suggestions
from all will be welcomed, as the club
plans to carry its aim into effect by
example rather than by a definite
campaign against the present ever
changing modes of feminine dress.
