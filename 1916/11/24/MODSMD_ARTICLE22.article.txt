ALAS, POOR YOIiICK!
They found liim in a far corner of
t lie - lakeâ€”a sequestered spot, fre
quented only by wooing lovers and
loving wooers, and then not fre
quently. Although the lake was quite
dry, he had drowned in a deluge of his
own fears. On his hack they found this
message, affixed with a golden safety
pin:
To False and Pickle Woman: I'm
sorry but I had 110 time to live.
Everything went wrong; sweet Blue
belle in Pasadena married a million
aire; movies went up; not long ago
1 received an invitation to a swell
dance and the very day tliat my full
dress suit came from Chicago they
burned their sorority house down;
the co-ed who invited me to dinner
now and then died of insomnia tlie
other night; man can stand so much
and then lie must sit down! While
sitting with a girl last week she said
she couldn't go with me to the movies
on next Valentine's day as she had
a toothache. 1 sent her a box of
candy and she didn't thank me. I
heard yesterday that taxis have run
out and that auto trucks and liay
wagons have been brought from San
Francisco to meet (he demand for the
cotillion, and that after the flowers
were exhausted, the dorists were
sending out vegetaldes. Good-bye,
false and liowery world.
This was found clenched in a white
and chapped fist:
To the Faculty: You won't miss
me; you can't go right on killing us
off. I was flunking the course in Oy
ster Beds in the Far East, and was
I raised on Oyster Bay; my petition to
drop this course was rejected; I
studied a day and a night on Vital
Statistics of Heligoland, and drew 37
in the exam. I missed a house-party
for a Saturday class and the prof,
cut! What's the use, I say? Yester
day I slipped in the gym and cut my
allowance. Man is made of dust and
last week the sophomores in our house
settled me with Searsville water. I
have nothing to live for except the
future and the faculty has put chains
around that. Good-bye, Agatha dear,
I loved you. So long, Prof. Humpty,
you are stupid. T'm dead now and you
can't dink me! Signed, Yorick
Crumble, '20.
