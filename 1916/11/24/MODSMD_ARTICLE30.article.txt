# Rugby Star Byrne On French Front
## 
### 
T. E. D. Byrne, former Vancouver
rugby star, and referee of the last
Stanford-California rugby game in
1914, is now on the French front.
Byrne left Vancouver two years
ago, and has seen sixteen months of
continuous service on the firing line.
He has been mentioned in dispatches
for his gallantry and has been recom
mended for a decoration.
Lieutenant Byrne in a letter to a
friend in Vancouver says in part:
"The climate is hellish, and as these
Bulgars rather fancy themselves with
the knife, we are endeavoring to show
them there are competitors at the
game."
