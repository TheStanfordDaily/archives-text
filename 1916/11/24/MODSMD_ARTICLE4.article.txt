# Sing Ho! Women's Daily Due Monday
## 
### 
The time has come, the big
chief said, to think of charming
thingsâ€”of fluffy stuff, loved by
the rough, with which the fair
one rings. The little dears, for
all their fears, have got a lot of
notions. They'll have their
chance, warned in advance to
watch their punctuations. So we
of the staff get ready to laugh;
we expcct a flock of "boners."
We relinquish all claim to what
ever fame comes on Monday,
when women arc owners.
"Which is how The Daily Palo Alto
poet looks forward to Monday, when
the women's edition will replace the
usual afternoon paper, according to
semi-annual custom.
