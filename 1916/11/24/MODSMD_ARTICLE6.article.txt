# Women Debaters Lose to Nestoria
## 
### 
The question whether members of
the women's or men's debating so
cieties are superior at Stanford was
settled last night in room 12 of the
Law department, when teams from
Nestoria and the Women's Debating
Society upheld the subject of the terri
torial integrity of China. Nestoria,
the men's debating society, gained the
decision.
The women who debated the af
firmative of the question were Miss
Dorothy Ifoskins, '19, alternate on the
Intercollegiate debating team, Miss
Ellen Calhoun, '20, and Miss Helen
Spalding, 'Hi. Members of Nestoria
on the negative of the question were
W. C. Fundenberg, '19, J. C. Holland,
'10, V. A. Mathews, '20. J. McMena
min, '20, acted as alternate for the
negative.
