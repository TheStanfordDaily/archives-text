# We Dedicate to "Doc" This Sheet
## 
### 
Dear Doc, â€”tlie Women dedicate
This deep brain work to thee
Because, despite your youth, you show
A marked ability!
To run a campus sheet and say
How college ought to be,
To tell your elders what to do
Although they don't agree.
Ami though we know (it's inside
dope)
Staff Women you can't see,
We think it wise to dedicate
These pages unto thee.
