# MEN MAY SIP TEA IN CLUB HOUSE
## 
### 
"A kosy kup of tea and komfy fire
will bo ready and waiting for kween
ers and others who wish to drop in at
the Women's Klub House on Sunday
afternoons of next semester," says
.Mrs. Bailey Willis of the Club House
committee.
The one restriction to attendance
at these informal receptions is that
women shall be members of the club.
To satisfy the long-felt want for
a general place where faculty and stu
dents may "get together," for occu
pation of "lonesome Sunday after
noons," and to make all feel generally
at home and comfortable, as well as 1o
encourage membership in the Club
House, is the purpose of the recep
tions.
Club House members will be divided
into groups, each acting in conjunc
tion with the faculty women as host
esses.
