# San Mateo Actors Give Play Tonight
## Charity and Fun Combined in Snappy Production of "The Concert" 
### 
To have a good time and at the
same time do a good deed, —that's an
unusual combination. But it's a pos
sible one if you'll buy a ticket to "The
Concert" tonight.
The money goes from you to the
Stanford Medical Clinic and the fun
comes to you from one of the clever
est and snappiest dramatic productions
on the Stanford stage this year.
"The Concert" made a tremendous
hit last Friday night, when it was
presented in the San Mateo Auditor
ium. It will probably make a bigger
one tonight, for the cast has had the
benefit of an extra rehearsal, held yes
terday morning on the Assembly Hall
stage.
The cast is good and the night is
good,—for Monday, as the hardest day
in the week, is the ideal one on which
to relax and go to a show. Above all,
the play is good—and spicy. It is un
passed by the board of censorship,
and it is a noteworthy fact that not a
single speech has been condemned to
the "cutting" process.
