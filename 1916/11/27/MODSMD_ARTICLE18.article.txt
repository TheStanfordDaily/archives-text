# AND MEN

### 
Previous Women's Editions have
conscientiously aimed remarks at the
"500" —here's to the men! We don't
object to the rough—though reciproc
ity of dress comment might be timely
—for he has often proven that real
culture lies not in outer adornment.
It is rather to the growing laxity in
the common courtesies toward women
that criticism is aimed. Engineering
corner—even on chain day—is not
nearly so objectionable as are those
men who consistently forget to re
move a pipe or cigarette when speak
ing to a woman.
And there are men, capable of dem
onstrating unusual intelligence, doing,
every day, dozens of things both
praiseworthy and interesting, who fail
to manifest anything above prep
school capacity when talking to one
of the opposite sex, —and they wonder
why the Stanford women have
"nothing above the ears," and do much
discussing of the evils of co-education.
It is of these self-satisfied humans
that we would ask the chance of being
judged fairly on the basis on which
one man judges another.
