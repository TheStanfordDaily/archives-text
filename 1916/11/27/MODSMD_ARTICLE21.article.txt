# Kan Kolleges.. .by Koncerned. ..for Rugby if-?

Once there was One on the Kollege
Kampus who favored American foot
ball. He couldn't see why the powers
that be declared Rugby to be the
game, when all the other Kolleges
of note played his chosen game. Still
less could he fathom how his univer
sity could endure to be beaten by a
Wee Spark among the Lesser Lights
of the Circle of Higher Education.
"I'll look into this matter," said he.
"Surely I am not the Only One who
sees to what our Kollege is drifting."
So the Only One took a walk up
the Ristocratic Row. He saw in front
of Some of the Houses the Brothers
blowing hard in stiff collars and coats.
They were jumping joyfully upon, and
running after, a football. They had
been Swayed by a Breeze on the Kam
pus.
"We like American," they were
shouting.
"So do I," said the One.
So One talked with the Brothers and
arranged for a team to be made, to
meet at a certain field at a certain
time.
Then went the One most interested
to a near-by town, San Jose. Here he
signed up another American team, in
order that his Kollege Squad might
have competition. Filled with satis
faction, and a realization of his own
worth to his Fellow Students, he re
turned to his Kampus and went to
watch the progress of the New-born
team.
The Brothers were just scrumming
up. They were fighting for the Lath
rop Cup.
"We like Rugby!" they shouted.
"I'm the Only One who knows what
he wants," groaned Jim Quinby, '17.
