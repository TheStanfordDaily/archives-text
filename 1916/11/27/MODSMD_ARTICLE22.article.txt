# The
						Sauce Box

### 
We dedicate this Sauce Box space
To our Herb Marshutz. On his face
You see the light of wit and mirth;
Each thought to some now joke
gives birth.
Me has been known to dictate three
Good jokes at once, and also see
A feature story on the fly
When all the staff would pass it by.
For length of words lie's in a class
With "Doc" alone, quite unsur
passed.
He writes of anything, but best
In ridicule, burlesque or jest.
His biggest aim, just now's a wife
With whom be hopes to share his
life.
He has not lived these years for
naught;
Immortal is each Sauce Box thought.
