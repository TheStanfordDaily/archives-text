# First Locomotive Put on Exhibition
## "Governor Stanford," of the Central Pacific, has Been Installed in Museum 
### 
One of Stanford's most prized pos
sessions was placed on exhibition
when the old "Governor Stanford," the
first locomotive on the Central Pa
cific, was placed in a special room in
the Museum last week.
Since the Midwinter Fair in San
Francisco, when it was exhibited in
1893 it has been housed in a rough
wooden shed back of the Museum
building. This week a hole was cut
in the Museum wall big enough to
run it through, and it is now on pub
lic exhibition for the first time in
twenty-three years.
This "No. 1" is a little older than
the "No. 1" that was on exhibition
at the P. P. I. E., which was run on
the Union Pacific. The "Governor
Stanford" operated between Sacra
mento and Colfax before the trans
continental line was linked up. Later
its run was from Sacramento to Og
den.
The "Governor Stanford," first pas
senger engine on the new line, was
built in Philadelphia and delivered
and put to work, with a baggage car
and two passenger cars, in 1863. It
was thought fitting by the Board of
Trustees that this old wood-burner
pioneer of the railroad, the outcome of
Senator Stanford's faith and energy,
should be preserved at the Univer
sity.
