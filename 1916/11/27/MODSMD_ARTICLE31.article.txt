# Comets Subject of Lecture Here Last Saturday
## 
### 
"Until two centuries ago it was be
lieved that comets were huge, fiery
balls, hurled to earth for punishment,
as famines, wars and diseases have
curiously enough followed in their
wake," said Dr. W. W. Campbell, di
rector of the Lick Observatory, in his
lecture on "Comets," in the Little
Theater, Saturday night. He ex
plained that the distinguishing fea
ture of these infrequent visitors is
their long, streaming tails, composed
presumably of gaseous matter of
small density, which are always
pointed away from the sun.
Dr. Campbell delivered this lecture
in response to a request made by Pro
fessor S. D. Town ley, President of the
Astronomical Society of the Pacific,
which met previous to the lecture at
a banquet at the Stanford Inn. This
is the first time the society has ever
met at Stanford.
