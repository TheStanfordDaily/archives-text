# Daily Make-Up Man F.J. Leard
## 
### 
This is how the make-up man
Daily looks when lie
Spends long hours shoving type
Grimy as can be.
Every day from 1 (?) 'till G
At his bench he stands,
Fitting in the sticks of type
With his inky hands.
'Tis no joke—(as well we know)
Making news look neat;
So we dedicate to him —
The make-up of this sheet.
