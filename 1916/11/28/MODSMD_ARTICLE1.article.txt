# PENINSULA FOLKS DELIGHTFULLY SHOCKING
## COMEDY GRATIFYING Audience Finds Cleverness and Rare Acting in "The Concert" 
### H.S. Marshutz, '17 
Society folks from B'lingham, and
up that way, motored down the Penin
sula last night, donned make-up, and
a few un-society costumes, and pro
ceeded to shock Assembly llall seat
holders into enjoying an evening of
genuine theatricals.
The play was"The Concert," a Hun
garian comedy not at all about a con
cert, translated by Leo Ditrichstein,
himself a European, but a resident of
New York. "The Concert" was both
typically European and Manhattanish.
It was not disconcerting in the least.
Rich In Cleverness.
Rich in ultra-clever eye-opening
lines, the comedy was a treat to those
who have been steeped in prim and
puritan college dramatic productions
for several generations. The Ditrich
stein effusion was very much of a
Hungarian rhapsody, varying from
pathos to the farcical, not over-or
thodox in its conformity with the
books that tell how to write a play,
and not over-chaste in lines and situ
ations.
If Mamma and Papa Prude were
there last evening they probably slid
deep down into their seats, drew
their Hungarian goulashes over their
ears and hung on. determined to last
it out. For it was a benefit produc
tion, for the Clinic Auxiliary, and that
made a vast difference. They, and the
over-critical critics, were the only
unsatisfied humans in the audience.
A witty comedy, with unblemished
acting in the vital roles, and predica
ments that held the seat-holders
guessing and hoping and wondering
