# ANTICIPATION MINUS

### 
Yankeeism evinces a trait of ag
gressiveness, a love of competition
which thrives on rivalry. Any battle
of wits or nniscle that ends in a draw
seems tantalizing and unsatisfactory.
Above all, the sight of a pre-arranged
contest, the winner of which is an
nounced, is comparable with the at
tempt to satisfy the hunger of the
starved with the odor of beefsteak.
When the public is left in the dark
as to the recipient of the victor's
laurels, it grumbles in ill-concealed
discontent.

• Friday evening of the past weeK,
California and Stanford debating trios
met in their annual intercollegiate
match. Theoretically, neither team
annexed the honors, since no decision
was rendered —the latest fad in for
ensic circles. All the speeches were
instructive and entertaining, each or
ator endeavoring to out-general his
opponents. When the dust had set
tled, both sides claimed tho decision
in the manner of European war bul
letins.

At the conclusion of the debate a
prominent figure instate politics was
to summarize arguments of the rival
squads, later presenting his own
views concerning the evening's issue.
Thereafter, the audience passed in
their checks, calling for coats and
hats —wondering all the while which
university had won. The idea of hav
ing some well-known speaker act in
the role of an explanatory mediator
meets with approval, but at the same
time there seems to be no valid rea
son for not satisfying a thoroughly
human craving by permitting judges
to pronounce a winner.
