# ELLIOTT EXPLAINS HONOR POINT SYSTEM
## CLEARS UP DOUBT Credit-Counting Plan in Effect for First Time This Semester 
### 
In order to clear up many erron
eous impression- concerning the
honor point system which was putin
vogue at Stanford this year, Registrar
O. L. Elliott today issued instructions
regarding both grading and granting
of points.
In order to graduate, a student must
have, in addition to the required num
ber of units in bis major department,
a number of honor points equal to
tbe number of units. It a student is
in a department requiring 120 units
to graduate he must have 120 points,
and if he is required to have 150 units
for graduation he is required to get
150 honor points.
Points are issued on the basis of
marks received in his course, under
the following conditions. A grade of
A gives two points, B one and one
half, C one, and D none, while a grade
of "plus" gives one point. A condi
tion not made up subtracts one point,
while if the condition is made up it
does not subtract any points, but does
not add any to the total number. A
failure in any course means the loss
of one and one-half points, with no
chance to regain them. A general
average of C for the entire four years
will provide the necessary number of
points for graduation.
Students entering the University
for the first time are put on an even
basis and must obtain the necessary
number of units. Others, however, are
given a number of points equal to the
number of units that have been se
cured before without regarding fail
ures and conditions, but for the re
mainder of their time must secure a
number of points equal to the number
of units necessary for graduation. A
senior in a course requiring 120
units to graduate and having 100
units at the present time is given
100 points, and must secure the re
maining 20 honor points as well as
20 units.
