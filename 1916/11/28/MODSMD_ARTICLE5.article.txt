# SANTA CLARA SATISFIED WITH RUGBY
## 
### 
"Santa Clara University will stick
to rugby. The students are strong
for the game, and want the competi
tion with Stanford. There has never
been any thought of changing to the
American game on the campus here,
and the rumor published in the San
Francisco "Bulletin" must have been
originated in the city or at Berkeley."
These were the words of Football
Captain Louis Milburn, this morning,
in regard to the report circulated
yesterday that the Mission Town
school would adopt the American game
in the near future.
Father Walsh, athletic moderator
of the Catholic college, was equally
as strong in his reply when ques
tioned by a Daily Palo Alto reporter.
"We are perfectly satisfied with

Rugby and with the annual Big Game.
No change in football play or rela
tions has been contemplated at Santa
Clara."
Graduate Manager Aurreoechea was
very much surprised at the rumor and
said that everything was being done
to trace it down to its source.
The merchants of Santa Clara are
enthusiastic over the excellent show
ing of the university fifteen this sea
son, tendering a banquet to the team
last week, and presenting Coach Aus
tin with a trophy in expression of
their appreciation for his work.
Prospects for another good team of
Missionites are bright, as but three of
the fifteen that met Stanford this year
will be absent when the call is issued
next season. Efforts are being made
to again obtain the services of Charlie
Austin to coach the players, but the
former Cardinal star has not accepted
as yet.
