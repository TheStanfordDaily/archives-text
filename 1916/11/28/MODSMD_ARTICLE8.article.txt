# Mutiny in India Incited by Former Stanford Lecturer
## 
### 
Stanford lecturer to leader of the
most pretentious mutiny in India
since lSn7, is the story of liar Dyal,
an educated Hindu who lectured on
the Philosophy of India before Stan
ford students while making plans to
overthrow the British government in
his native land of India. The mutiny
dates back to 1913, immediately after
Dyal left Stanford and was suppressed
after much bloodshed within the last
couple of months.
At Stanford in 1912.
liar Dyal came to Stanford and
gave a course of lectures in the spring
semester of 1912. He started the sec
ond semester, but left after a few
weeks. Later he went to San Fran
cisco to preach atheism, traveling
about talking mutiny against the
British among his countrymen on the
coast. He published the Ghadr
(Mutiny) a newspaper, urging all
Hindoos to return to their native coun
try and rise up against the British
government. Dyal displayed early
knowledge of the European situation,
which it is believed came from Ger
man sources, as lie told the Hindoos
of the coast that the time to strike
was just after England got into war.
He was instrumental in sending sev
eral hundred Hindoos over to Punjab
to incite the revolution, but was him
self arrested by the U. S. authorities
on a charge of anarchy. He put up
bail and left the country, and has
since been heard of from Germany.
He is now believed to be in Turkey,
inciting a revolution there.
Dyal's position at Stanford was
only that of an unpaid lecturer, and
he was never really a member of the
regular faculty. He was a clever
talker, and a man of great intellectual
attainments, having been sent through
Oxford by the Indian government. He
is remembered by some of the faculty
as a brilliant man, but with radical
ideas. He spent his vacation inter
vening between the two semesters, in
Palo Alto, but nothing is known of
him during that time.
