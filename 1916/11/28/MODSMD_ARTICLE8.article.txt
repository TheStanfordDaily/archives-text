most pretentious mutiny in India
since lSn7, is the story of liar Dyal,
an educated Hindu who lectured on
the Philosophy of India before Stan

overthrow the British government in
his native land of India. The mutiny
dates back to 1913, immediately after

couple of months.
At Stanford in 1912.
liar Dyal came to Stanford and
gave a course of lectures in the spring
semester of 1912. He started the sec
ond semester, but left after a few
weeks. Later he went to San Fran
cisco to preach atheism, traveling
about talking mutiny against the
British among his countrymen on the
coast. He published the Ghadr
(Mutiny) a newspaper, urging all
Hindoos to return to their native coun
try and rise up against the British
government. Dyal displayed early

of the coast that the time to strike
was just after England got into war.
