sfy!— that's a new thing
for a cigarette to do
It's nothing for a cigarette to just taste good—lots of
cigarettes may do that. But Chesterfields do more—they
satisfy! Just like a thick, juicy steak satisfies when
you're hungry.
Yet, with all that, Chesterfields are MILD !
No other cigarette can give you this new enjoyment
(satisfy, yet mild), for the good reason that no cigarette
maker can copy the Chesterfield blend —an entirely new
combination of tobaccos and the most important develop
ment in cigarette blending in 20 years.
