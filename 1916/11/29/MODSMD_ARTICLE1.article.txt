# SCHUMANN â€“ HEINK THRILLS MUSIC LOVERS
## SHOWS WAR SORROW Appreciative Audience Feels Europe's Burdens in Singer's Tone 
### 
Something of the sorrow which has
entered the heart of Madame Schu
mann-Heink with the great affliction
of her people, and something of the
joy it gives her to aid in lifting the
burden, was communicated by the
great contralto to the music lovers
who heard her in the Assembly Hall
last evening. Not a person w T as there
but felt both the pathetic appeal and
the happy charm of her music, selec
tions varying from the dramatically
tragic to simple lilting melodies of
lighter vein.
Range of Tone Incomparable.
In range of tone, in clearness and
sweetness of quality, Schumann-Heink
is probably incomparable. The deep,
rich notes of her lower range, perfect
though they are, do not surpass in
beauty those lighter and higher tones,
which never failed to send a thrill
through the listeners. But there is
another charm in the art of Schu
mann-Heink, a charm which everyone
present felt last evening. It is in her
personality, in her smile and in her
attitude of a mother singing to little
children.
The program gave a glimpse of the
great versatility of the singer. In
the rendition of Schubert's "The Erl-
King," particularly, and to perhaps a
lesser degree in the aria, "Ah Mon
Fils," from the opera of "Le Pro
phete," by Meyerbeer, and the "Cry
of Rachel," by Salter, the dramatic
element was uppermost. The tense
interpretation of the moods in"The
Erl-King" was remarkable. Scarcely
less so was the singing of "Ileim
weli," into which Schumann-Heink put
her whole soul.
Of those lighter songs, Schubert's
"Die Forelle" seemed to meet with
the greatest popular favor, the ap
plause being so insistent as to secure
a repetition. The German folk song,
"Spinnerlicdchen," and "Good Morn
ing, Sue," by Leo Delibes, breathed
happiness and good nature, and were
also well received.
For encores, Schumann-Heink sang
the aria from Massenet's "Sampson
and Delilah," "Laddie Boy," an Irish
folk song, and "Stille Nacht," the old
German song which has been made
famous by the great contralto.
