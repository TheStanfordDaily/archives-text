# Interclub Football Is Still in Balance
## Kappa Sigma-El Toro Fifteen Holds Zeta Psi-Alpha Delta Phi to Tie 
### 
Tn the best football displayed in the
interfratornity and intcrclub series,
the Zeta Psi and Alpha Delta Phi com
bination held the Kappa Sigma and
El Toro fifteen to a scoreless tie yes
terday afternoon on the varsity tnrf.
Surges Back ami Forth.
Surging from one end of the field
to the other, the game was seldom
to the advantage of either side for a
long period. Good backfield rushes
by both squads were smothered by
heavy tackling, and the forwards met
with the odds even in all but drib
bling. Tn this, .Tanssen of the Zeta
Psi and Alpha Delta Phi team, was the
star. His work was of high order
throughout. Bihlman and Bonney
were the other feature players of the
forwards.
The game was the final contest of
the present series and the winner
would have received the Timothy Hop
kins trophy. As the contest ended in
a tie score, it will have to be played
over again. The date has not been
determined as yet, but will probably
be on Monday, December 4, 1916.
