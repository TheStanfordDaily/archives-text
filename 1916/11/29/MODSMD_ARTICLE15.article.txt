After gazing in reverent awe at
chains that encircle the quadrangle,
excluding vehicles of every descrip
tion and allowing moss to flourish in
the once worn highways, one wonders
if the benefits to be derived from
such monastic seclusion are exten
sive. Especially when driving upon
the roundabout roads or jumble of
chuckholes and young mountains that
form the so-called streets accessible
to automobiles, does one rise in wrath
at having the various organs of the
body dislodged and shifted in such a
disconcerting manner. Evidently the
idea was for the convenience of stu
dents during class hours —both while
patiently listening to the conclusion
of the lecture, and when gamboling
about on the street in company with
Lady Nicotine. But even should one
be forced to suffer this benefit, it
would seem unnecessary to retain the
penitentiary symbols before S o'clock
in the morning, during the noon
hour, and after classes are dismissed
in the afternoon. Sic Semper Tyrannis.
