# TURKEY DAY
## 
### 
It is a mighty gay moment wlion this
column can slide out from under the
usual sober jacket and laugh in care
free abandon. Realization is usually
lost somewhere in the fog—but today
marks a respite in the grind, turkeys
and cranberry sauce substituted for
the past diet of amoebas, logerithms,
contracts, and Chaucerian verse
spiced with split-hair theories and his
torical facts and fables. Cobwebs and
a thick layer of dust will fill the gap.
But remember, while you imbibe cop
ious helpings of the rare fowl, to ap
ply the knowledge of a college edu
cation —Fletcherize and be merry.
No, The Daily Palo Alto has not sunk
to the depths of a half-witted journal;
it merely desires to extend sincere
wishes for a right royal Thanksgiving
vacation.
