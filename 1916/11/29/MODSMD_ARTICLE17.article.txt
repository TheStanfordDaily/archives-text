# U. C. TO DEVOTE FOOTBALL PROCEEDS TO WAR SUFFERERS
## 
### 
In response to a request for con
tributions for the relief of European
war sufferers, the University of Cali
fornia has decided to donate to this
fund the proceeds of the Freshmen-
University Farm School football
game, to be played tomorrow at Berk
eley.
The call for a Prisoners' Relief Fund
has met with startling results from
eastern colleges. Williams, with only
400 students, has raised $10,000, Wis
consin $25,000, while the proceeds of
the Yale-Princeton game netted the
largest sum of all.
