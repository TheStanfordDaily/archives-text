# Stanford Wrestlers Defeat Y. M. C. A. Team
## 
### 
Winning two and tying one out of
four bouts, the Stanford wrestlers
carried off the honors in the tourna
ment with San Francisco Y. M. C. A.
last night in Encina gymnasium. The
bouts were snappy throughout, and
although G. H. Bihlman, '17, and R. E.
Daniels, '18, were on the sick list and
could not participate, the remaining
four bouts and an exhibition between
R. F. Crawford, '20, and M, Stamas of
San Francisco, furnished some live
entertainment for the spectators.
First Preliminary Meet.
The meet, which was the first
chance the Stanford wrestlers have
had to try themselves against outside
opponents, was the first of several
which are planned as "workouts" for
the tournament with California next
March. A novice tournament, and
contests with the Olympic Club and
the San Francisco "Y" again, will
probably bo held early next semester.
More upperclassmen are needed, ac
cording to Coach D. C. Wise, '18, as
the freshmen, who are especially well
represented in this sport, will not be
allowed to compete against California
next semester.
The results of the tournament fol
low:
Welterweight—P. H. Jones (S)
throws A. Poulos (SF), 6 minutes.
Lightweight—W. Lunthal (SF)
throws H. M. Kent (S), 6 minutes.
Special—lT. E. Egami (S) throws O.
Goldman (SF), 3 minutes.
