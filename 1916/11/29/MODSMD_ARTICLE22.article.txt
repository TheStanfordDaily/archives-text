TWO THANKSGIVING DINNERS.
The scene Is in the family (lining
room at home. Mr. Gump, Mrs.
Gump, and little William Gum]) sit
before the Thanksgiving' meal.
Mrs. G.—l said "no," once, William,
and don't you believe me?
Mr. G.—l don't want you to aggra
vate your mother.
William —If there aint goin' to be
no turkey, I aint goin' to eat.
Mrs. G. —Please, William, please un
derstand.
Wm. —Understand what?
Mr. —If you're not satisfied with
what your parents offer you, the door
is always
Mrs. G. (interrupting)— Don't be
harsh, father; remember, he doesn't
understand —he is only
Wm.—Thanksgiving without no tur
key, oh lobsters!
Mrs. G. (threatening to cry)— Wil
liam, for your brother's sake, please be
kind to me. Please! Don't you see
we can't afford turkey this year?
Times are hard. We are very for
tunate to have this brisket and horse
radish sauce. Yesterday I sent a cake
and some candy to college for Cuth
bert —I don't feel as if we here should
have a great dinner, and our other
boy is sitting down to a frugal col
lege meal —beans, perhaps, as he often
writes. Please don't make me cry,
William.
Wm. —Oh, all right. Don't be a
cry-baby. Pass the jam, —please.
The scent changes,—to the 4 'big
city" near the college. There Is a
little table built for two on the brink
of an ice-rink. There are two at the
table, a man and a girl.
The man—lt's a wonderful day, isn't
it!
The girl—Lovely! You're awfully
good to me, Cuthbert.
The man —Easy there. You'll have
me have some more turkey?
The girl—No, thanks.
The man—Some more wine?
The girl—Can't say that I'd mind.
It's very good,—today.
The man (filling her glass, and bis
own)— There we are! Now let's
drink—who to? The old folks at home
—liow's that for a toast on Thanks
giving Day?
The girl—Oh, let's make it exciting!
We know they're happy. Here's to
OUR future happiness,—may we live
long, until, until ?
The man (dramatically) — Until
death do us part! How's that, little
girl ?
The girl (dreamily)— Glorious!
Perfectly glorious?
