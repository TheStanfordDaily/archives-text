Michigan (Jame Probable.

ruggers is not at all certain, but it
still seems to be probable, and the
new offers for games helps matters
considerably. R. P. Woodward, the
man who referecd two Stanford-Cali

the "father of rugby in the north," is
the main spirit behind the movement
to bring the Michigan players to
Seattle.
W. H. Davies, superintendent of th ra
Vancouver Island Athletic Club, tele
graphed Graduate Manager Behrens
today requesting that the visiting
team play at Victoria. Other mes
sages have arrived making a game at
Calgary, Canada, entirely possible.

Graduate Manager Behrens leaves
tomorrow morning for Seattle, where
he will represent Stanford at the first
meeting of the new Pacific Coast Ath

go to Vancouver and Calgary, where
he will attempt to schedule the con

fifteen. While at Seattle, he will help
with the schedules that are being
made out for the intersectional track
