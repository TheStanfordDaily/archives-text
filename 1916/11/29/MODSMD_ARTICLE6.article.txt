You will find enclosed the letter
which the military chanlain wrote to
me concerning his death, and about

Militaire" and the "Croix de Guerre."
I received a copy of the order for
this order from the War Office, signed
"Joffre," as well as the two medals.
Thanking you again and wishing
you good luck with the Ambulance
Corps which you are forming. 1 see
by the French newspapers that 200 of
your students have already enrolled,
thus giving the strongest proof that
the United States is on the side of
peace and justice. Accept, my dear
sir, the assurance of my deepest re
spect. Most sincerely yours,
