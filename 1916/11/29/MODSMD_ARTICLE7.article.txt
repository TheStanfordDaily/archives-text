# Call of Cranberry and Turkey Causes Stanford Students to Leave Farm for Thanksgiving
## 
### 
Many Stanford students an
swered the call of the turkey and
cranberry sauce and left for home
this afternoon to spend Thanks
giving, but on the campus tomor
row will be found the conscien
tious students who will spend the
vacation in study. The eye
shades and bathrobes will be in
evidence as their owners start the
semi-annual burning of the mid
night oil for final examinations.
With finals only seven school
days away, students who will not
be able to go home are planning
a quiet vacation. The Union dance
tonight and the Encina dance on
Saturday ends all festivities of
the season, and the campus will
be quiet until celebrations start
after the annual period of depres
sion.
