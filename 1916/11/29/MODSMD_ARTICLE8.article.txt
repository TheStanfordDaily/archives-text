# MISS SPINNEY TO READ GREEK PLAY
## 
### 
Miss Dorothea Spinney will give a
second Greek dramatic reading in the
Little Theater next Monday evening,
December 4th, at S o'clock. The play
chosen by Miss Spinney is the "Trojan
Woman" of Euripides, a tragedy of
singular power and beauty, and one
of peculiar interest at this time.
It was produced in 415 D. C., at a
time when the war-party at Athens
was supreme, and it follows closely
upon the most terrible act of "fright
ftilness" with which that party stained
the name of Athens. Tlie play inter
prets, not the glory of a Greek tri
umph, but the pity and horror of war
as seen in the fate of the vanquished,
and thus becomes a powerful protest
against, all war.
