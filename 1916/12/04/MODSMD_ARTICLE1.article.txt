# HISTORY MAJORS TAKE OATH OF HONOR
## PLEDGE FOR SYSTEM Stand Strongly Against Cheating and for Punishment of Offenders 
### 
Students in the Department of His
tory are binding themselves to the
honor system, thereby working toward
the permanent installation of such a
system in that department.
Twenty-five Have Signed.
Twenty-five signatures have already
been placed on the manifesto drawn
up by a committee appointed at a re
cent meeting of the department. This
declaration is on file in the History
reading room and may be signed by
History majors between now and the
beginning of Ex. week.
No campaign for signatures is to be
made but if a hundred or more majors
sign on their own initiative the mat
ter will be presented to the Academic
Council by Professor E. D. Adams
with the recommendation that the
honor system be installed in the de
partment.
Students Originate Movement.
The movement originated several
weeks ago with the students of the
department for the purpose of creating
a permanent organization to inform
all non-History majors in History
classes of the conditions under which
work was to be done in that depart
ment.
Following is the declaration which
is now being signed:
"We, the undersigned, are united
in the belief that the installa
tion of the honor system in the
History department would result
in raising materially the moral
standards of the department and
of the University as a whole.
"We recognize that a self-en
forcing moral tradition is not to
be built in a day, and we believe
that as an organized majority,
working for the social good, we
not only have the right but are in
duty bound to enforce the new
moral code at the cost of any
amount of inconvenience to our
selves.
"We therefore bind ourselves,
each personally, not only to re
frain from every form of dishon
esty with the conduct of Univer
sity examinations, but to report to
the Student Council each and
every instance of dishonesty in
connection with History examina
tions which come under our no
tice."
