### 
Uniforms for the Stanford Military
Training corps arrived Friday and
with the rifles already on hand the
Stanford army will begin to take on a
more martial aspect this week.
Members of the battalion who re
mained in tbo camp over Thanksgiv
ing vacation were fitted ont in their
olivo drab on Saturday and appeared
for drill today in uniform.
Uniforms Arc Olive Drab.
The uniforms are the regulation
olivo drab service garb of the United
States army, and with the exception
of one box of caps, which will bo here
early this week, the entire battalion
of 23. r > men will be issued complete
outfits.
Insignia for the collars and caps
has not been received yet but Major
T"Sugge stales that it will be here in
the near future. The officers will buy
their own insignia of rank for the
collar.
Wear Uniforms to Class.
"Except for an overcoat, no civilian
clothing will be worn with any part
of the uniform, but the wearing of
the entire uniform to classes 011 drill
days is to be encouraged," said Major
Bugge, last night. "The uniform may
seem strange at first, but the fellows
will find it very comfortable and
handy. Drill is to be in uniform from
now on."
Major Bugge says that he wishes all
those who are intending to take drill
next semester would let him know as
soon as possible, because if he knows
in the next few days he can order
their uniforms so that they will be
here by the opening of the new se
mester. Enthusiasm rs running high
now and many recruits are expected
to sign up for two hours of Univer
sity credit in drill next semester.
May Have To Pay.
The question of who will pay for
the uniforms is still undecided pend
ing the passage of a bill in Congress,
and meanwhile the Stanford Trustees
have advanced the funds for the de
livery of the rifles and uniforms. If
the bill fails to pass Congress, the
students will have to pay for their
own outfits, but the situation looks
favorable for the passage of the bill,
which would mean that the govern
ment would reimburse the University
for the uniforms.
