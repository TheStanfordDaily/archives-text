This moralization was not penned
for scholars, so, should the Phi Beta
Kappa key decorate your front you
might as well exchange the coming
paragraphs for lighter brain-stimu
lant. But for the plebian-minded
gentry, just jot down this epitaph in
the diary—ten days hence two thous
and hollow-eyed sheepskin chasers,
armed with Blue-hooks and Water
mans, commence on the initial lap of
a grewsome grind. Staring one in
the face is the test, designating for
many probation, for another generous
handful, the grand finale.

Rarely does one feel called upon to
don the horn-rimmed spectacles, shake
the dust off the notes, and perhaps
dive hastily into a few scattered vol
umes —but recall that on this partic
ular voyage sentimentality has booked
no passage. To cut across corner
lots, the moment has arrived to
buckle down, since the hours are few,
the stakes high, and the game almost
closed, with the winnings perhaps
sadly on the ebb.

One never fully appreciates his
scholastic peril, until the home stretch
has been reached, when a state of
coma becomes existent. Then after
the strain is past, the student is not
among the shouting, carefree throng
—he's lost. Better start active train
ing tonight, and then you won't be
chanting that doleful swan song sig
nifying eligibility to the faculty dis
abled list.
