# Y. M. C. A. Lines Up Men for Asilomar
## 
### 
James B. Watson, general secretary
of the Y. M. C. A., leaves the campus
tomorrow for Pasadena, where he will
attend the Older Boys' Conference, as
official representative of the Stanford
Association. Watson will be the only
Stanford representative at the Pasa
dena conference.
The local Association is organizing
a delegation to attend the Christmas
College Men's Conference at Asilomar,
from December 26 to January 4. It is
the plan to send thirty picked men to
the conference this year, a slightly
larger delegation than former years
have seen.
The picking of the 1916 delegation
is largely in the hands of former dele
gates. Religious, moral, and educa
tional problems are considered at the
conference by college men from all
institutions in California, Nevada and
Arizona.
The former Stanford delegates arc
hearty in their approval of the broad
ening influences of the Asilomar an
nual conference. R. M. Wenzel, Y. M.
C. A. president, and Chaparral artist,
says: "A man cannot develop the best
that's in him merely by trying. He
must expose himself to carefully
chosen influences. Asilomar is a
healthful and helpful experience."
According to H. C. Blote, "Asilomar
recalls a week of good fun, mingled
with small doses of education, dips
in the Pacific, eats that take the
wrinkles out of your appetite, fire
side talks with a punch, and a chance
to get chummy with some of the big
gest men of the state."
Chance to Meet Men.
"Asilomar is the one chance a man
has to meet fellows from all the other
California colleges and learn to know
them and of their student life. Cher
ished friendships from the conference
week are alone worth the trip."
Roy E. Needham says:"In my
opinion the nine days spent at the
Asilomar conference furnish a student
with the best possibility for a good
time, coupled with the greatest op
portunity for helpfulness a man can
possibly receive, than nine days spent
under any other circumstances."
"I consider the Asilomar Conference
one of the biggest opportunities that
come to a Stanford man during his
college days," states J. F. Elden,
Stanford debater.
