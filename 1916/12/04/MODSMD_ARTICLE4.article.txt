# Stanford Signs Up With Members of Coast Conference
## 
### 
Stanford University was admitted to
membership in the Pacific Coast Inter
collegiate Athletic Conference, at the
annual meeting of the organization in
Seattle, 011 Friday and Saturday of
last week. Washington State College
was taken into the Conference at the
same session. The membership of the
Conference now consists of the six
leading univt rsities of the west, the
University of Washington, the Univer
sity of California, the University of
Oregon and the Oregon Agricultural
College already having been mem
bers.

Following Stanford's acceptance of
the invitation to join the conference
at last Tuesday's meeting of the ex-
ecutive commmittee, Graduate Man
ager E. C. Behrens immediately left
tlie campus to attend the annual
meeting. As all other members of
the intercollegiate organization play
American football, Stanford will ar
range no schedule in this sport, but
the Graduate Manager will secure
contests in baseball and basketball,
while all the conference members will
meet in general track competition.
Conference is Kew.
The present conference was organ
ized only last year at the time of the
football and freshman competition
disputes. Stanford was at that time
invited to join the group as a charter
member, but declined the invitation
because the conference demanded the
elimination of freshmen in all inter
collegiate competition.
The University of Southern Califor
nia applied for membership in the
conference at last week's session, but
was denied. No statement was given
out as to the cause of the refusal, but
it was generally believed in Seattle
that the Southern university was re
garded as not strong enough in ath
letics to entitle it to membership.
