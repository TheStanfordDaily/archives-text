kind of work encountered in each of
the many branches offered to the
woman who makes nursing lie;- pro
fession, in a lecture given to women
of the University in the Little Theater
yesterday afternoon, by request of
the Y. W. C. A. vocational committee.
Formerly women nurses and physic

told of the work of the New England
Hospital of Boston, the first which
undertook to train women in these
two professions. It was here that
Miss Jamme received her training.
In connection with the subject, Miss
Jamme spoke of the proposed Health

hospitals which would give free care
to the sick.
