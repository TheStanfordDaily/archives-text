# MARK A CROSS
## 
### 
Some Stanford folk delight in be
littling the ability and projects of
their student leaders, deriving keen
enjoyment from destructive and per
haps occasionally deserved ill-com
ment. Should a roll-call be taken of
deprecators of official representatives,
the most rabid reformers would be
found to lie in the non-voting popu
lation. Another group merely slum
bers in peaceful unconcern. Endowed
in the nature of these individuals
who evince but slight responsibility
and desultory interest in public af
fairs exists spasmodic revolutionary
discontent —but without a grain of
justification, due to their refusal either
to nominate officers or to cast a bal
lot. Tomorrow during the late morn
ing and early afternoon the semi-an
nual election will be decided by pop
ular vote. It is the duty of all eli
gible voters —those who possessed
sufficient pride in Stanford to pay
their student body dues—to voice their
opinion.
