## Stanford and California Teams Also Slated for Doubles Match 
### 
What promises to be the most spec
tacular exhibition of indoor tennis
that has been witnessed around the
bay in recent years will be played in
the civic auditorium in San Francisco
on Friday night, December 8, when
"Bill" Johnson and "Peck" Griffin
meet Maurice McLaughlin and John
Strachan in a doubles match. On the
same night there will also be a doubles
exhibition between Stanford and Cali
fornia.
The premier event of the exhibition
brings together four of the best rac
quet wielders that have played on
American courts. Johnson is well
known as national singles champion
in 1915. Together with Griffin the
pair holds the present national
doubles championship. McLaughlin
will long be remembered in tennis an
nals as one time national champion,
and a player who still attracts a na
tion-wide interest. John Strachan is
holder of the state title.
Stanford vs. U. C. Exhibition.
The team which will represent
Stanford against California will be
composed of 11. V. Johns, '18, and A.
H. Barber, '18, present tennis cap
tain. Both men are veterans, and it
is certain that they will put up a good
exhibition against the Blue and Gold
combination of Emory Rogers and
Axel Graven.
The two matches, the first starting
at 7:45, will be followed by a dance.
The proceeds derived from admit
tance charges to the exhibition will
go into a fund for the building of a
clubhouse in Golden Gate Park in
San Francisco.
