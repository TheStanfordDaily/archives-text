Former Stanford
Man Wins Honors.
Herbert E. Bolton, professor of
American History at Stanford in 1910
and 1911, now at the University of
California, has been given the highest
honor that can be bestowed on a Blue
and Gold professor, the position of
faculty research lecturer for the com
ing semester. This is an honor
granted to those who distinguish
themselves by adding in some re
markable way to the world's store of
knowledge.
Over Two Thousand
Atliletes at U. C.
Statistics recently compiled by Pro
fessor Frank Kleeberger of the De
partment of Physical Culture have
revealed a record-breaking participa
tion in athletics at the University of
California. Two thousand one hun
dred and thirty-five men are now
taking part in some form of athletics,
of which track now claims the largest
number, with baseball, gymnasium,
crew and basketball not far behind.
Canada Debates
Higher Education.
War versus education is the strug
gle being waged in the Canadian Par
liament at Ottawa. It is alleged that
schools of learning diminish patriot
ism, and accordingly, it is argued by
some, all institutions of higher learn
ing should be closed until after the
termination of the European struggle.
Friends of the universities of Canada
claim that the results of this plan
would be more detrimental than the
casualties of war.
California Juniors
Hood Financiers.
The Junior Class at California
broke a long standing "jinx" when
$350 was cleared through Junior Day
festivities. The profit on the Junior
Farce, the annual theatrical produc
tion of the class, was $270, and $80
was cleared on the Prom. Last year
the class of '17 lost about $175.
Spend $250,000
On U. C. "Union."
According to the most recent esti
mates, the cost of the proposed new
Student's Union at the University of
California will be in the neighbor
hood of $250,000. The cash on hand
at present is about $27,000, leaving
some $225,000 still to be raised. It is
proposed to borrow the needed money
and then pay it back from the yearly
income of the Union, which is ex
pected to be about $20,000. At this
rate the building will be paid for in
less than 25 years.
Senior Extravaganzas
at U. C. Leave Deficit.
Because of repeated deficits caused
by the senior dramatic productions at
California, manuscripts submitted for
the extravaganzas must hereafter be
accompanied by a careful estimate of
their probable cost. Since 1912 no
profit has been made on these produc
tions, last year's setback amounting
to $1100.

California Juniors
Hood Financiers.
The Junior Class at California
broke a long standing "jinx" when
$350 was cleared through Junior Day
festivities. The profit on the Junior
Farce, the annual theatrical produc
tion of the class, was $270, and $80
was cleared on the Prom. Last year
the class of '17 lost about $175.
Spend $250,000
On U. C. "Union."
According to the most recent esti
mates, the cost of the proposed new
Student's Union at the University of
California will be in the neighbor
hood of $250,000. The cash on hand
at present is about $27,000, leaving
some $225,000 still to be raised. It is
proposed to borrow the needed money
and then pay it back from the yearly
income of the Union, which is ex
pected to be about $20,000. At this
rate the building will be paid for in
less than 25 years.
Senior Extravaganzas
at U. C. Leave Deficit.
Because of repeated deficits caused
by the senior dramatic productions at
California, manuscripts submitted for
the extravaganzas must hereafter be
accompanied by a careful estimate of
their probable cost. Since 1912 no
profit has been made on these produc
tions, last year's setback amounting
to $1100.
Former Stanford
Man Wins Honors.
Herbert E. Bolton, professor of
American History at Stanford in 1910
and 1911, now at the University of
California, has been given the highest
honor that can be bestowed on a Blue
and Gold professor, the position of
faculty research lecturer for the com
ing semester. This is an honor
granted to those who distinguish
themselves by adding in some re
markable way to the world's store of
knowledge.
Over Two Thousand
Atliletes at U. C.
Statistics recently compiled by Pro
fessor Frank Kleeberger of the De
partment of Physical Culture have
revealed a record-breaking participa
tion in athletics at the University of
California. Two thousand one hun
dred and thirty-five men are now
taking part in some form of athletics,
of which track now claims the largest
number, with baseball, gymnasium,
crew and basketball not far behind.
Canada Debates
Higher Education.
War versus education is the strug
gle being waged in the Canadian Par
liament at Ottawa. It is alleged that
schools of learning diminish patriot
ism, and accordingly, it is argued by
some, all institutions of higher learn
ing should be closed until after the
termination of the European struggle.
Friends of the universities of Canada
claim that the results of this plan
would be more detrimental than the
casualties of war.
