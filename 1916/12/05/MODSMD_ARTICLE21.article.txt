Stanford, 12-5-16.
Dearest Ma, These are the usual
days of trite interrogation. One lives
by asking one's acquaintances "How
many exes have you?" "When you
going home?" No one cares partic
ularly how many exams the other fel
low is up against—the fun is in hav
ing an excuse to give out informa
tion regarding one's own misfortune.
Yesterday a new tradition was started
when military men attended classes
in simplified clothing—military uni
forms. The new olive drab monkey
suits are appealing-looking uniforms,
but they fail to appear uniform on
every soldier. There are other new
traditions here this year, ma. Mili
tary men now salute their major on
the Quad; the chancellor of the Uni
versity (out of respect, because he is
for peace) and also any woman to
whom the uniform-wearer is socially
obligated. When the council gave a
junior student 5 hours for blowing
his nose too loud during a lecture an
other valuable tradition was started.
Only seniors who are failing in one
third of their subjects can sit on the
chains that surround the Quad. This
is to prevent the Quad from falling
over. But in spite of these traditions,
we are progressing, education to the
contrary, for we dance now until one
a.m., and the women are using more
slang. Remember 15 more shopping
days, and mend your stocking before
you hang it up. Much love, your
SONNY.
