# HAYES RETURNS TO PLAY BALL WITH VARSITY
## AGAIN IN CONDITION Will Captain Team Regardless of Rumors to Contraryâ€” Prospects Bright 
### 
Cardinal baseball prospects for the
coming season loom bright as the list
of varsity eligibles increases. Cap
tain "Doc" Hayes will be back on the
job, and will be in excellent condition 1
according to reports from the Gradu- j
ate Manager's oflice. Hayes had his
leg badly broken and received other
injuries in a motorcycle accident last
summer. Tt was thought at first that
he would be unable to play baseball
again, but former coach Harry Wolter
believes that Hayes will be as good
as ever when the 1917 season rolls
around.
Wilson Successful Couch.
Russell Wilson, who has been se
lected to handle the coaching reins,
has had a great deal of experience,
both playing and coaching the national
pastime. He was successful at Whit
tier, his nine winning the southern
championship. With good material
to start the season, he should give
Stanford a winner.
Veterans For Game.
Besides first sacker Hayes, Hoover,
Mattei and Draper will be on hand to
give the Cardinal a good twirling
staff. Lander may return to college,
and with E. Mitchell, should work in
well behind the plate. R. Mitchell
will compete with Hayes for first base,
while Stevens, Shriver, Reagon, Par
thum and Hensel will complete the
list of prospects for the infield.
Cowan has signified his intention of
returning to the University, but it is
doubtful whether he will be eligible
to play.
Bihlman, Braden, Sanborn, Lilly,
Ryan and Boydston seem to be the
best of the outfielders. There un
doubtedly will be several dark-horses
spring up when the first practices
start, but the pick of the above list
would give a team capable of strong
competition.
Fresliraen Unknown Quantity.
The freshmen team is hard to esti
mate at this early date. Pike has
played excellent baseball, as has An
gel 1 and several of the other mem
bers of the 1920 class have had experi
ence on the diamond. Graduate Man
ager 15 eh r ens is arranging a long
schedule of games for both teams, as
well as contests for a second var
sity to be picked from the teams of
the Peanut League. With Stanford in
the Pacific Coast Conference, baseball
activities should take on a new spirit.
Besides the intercollegiate games
With the University of California, con
tests will be staged with teams from
Washington and Oregon.
