# SEASON OUTLOOK PROMISING IN TRACK
## MANY STARS OF HAND Captain Aupperle Will Start Practice With Opening of Next Semester 
### 
Cardinal track men will begin to
shake the dust from their running
togs and start actual practice on the
track immediately after the start of
next semester. Soine practice has
been indulged in of late by track stars
but no regular workouts have been
hold. Captain Aupperle returns to tho
campus Friday and it is expected that
he will set an actual date for the
initial practice.
Coach Not Selected.
Selection of a coach for the team
has not been announced as yet but
will be before the next semester.

Stanford are bright and many of the
former stars will be on hand to don
the spikes.
The return of "Pretty" Laclimund is
a big aid to the team in both the 100
and 220. Davis, Levi and Losh of last
year's team will be on hand for the
sprints . From last year's freshmen
team, Wark and Floete are eligible.
House, star of last year's Cardinal
babes, will probably return to college
in January and in case he does will be
eligible for this as well as the hurdles.
I'rospects Seem llrijrlit.
In the quarter-mile Dievendorff of
last year's squad looms up along with
Rogers, who made the fastest lap in
last year's Irish Marathon outside of
the varsity team, and Pelouze, who
ran for the freshmen. "Hob" Williams,
who showed up well at the close of
last season as a high hurdler, is ex
pected to come through in good style.
Halsted will compete and should de
velop into a sure point winner.
Captain Aupperle will undoubtedly
run the half and mile and Schnell is
also on hand. A. Wilson, Scott, Mc-
Pherson, Chapman and Teitsworth of
the 1919 squad are the other known
