California Men
Play Ice Hockey.
Thirty-five men turned out for ice
hockey last Saturday at the Univer
sity of California, and held their first
practice in San Francisco at the Win
ter Garden Rink, where Stanford has
been practicing for the past two
months. At present the men are being
coached by Wendell Kuhu and cap
tained by G. W. Young, '18, both for
mer members of the Princeton ice
hockey team. Two preliminary and a
final intercollegiate contest are sched
uled for next semester.
Dobie May
Coach U. C.
Coach Gilmore Dobie of Washington
University may be seen coaching Cali
fornia's eleven next season, if rumors
that are again flying broadcast prove
true. Much feeling developed against
Dobie, recently, on the Seattle cam
pus, because of the suspension of one
of the players, and this, it is believed,
lias crystallized a sentiment against
him among those in authority. If, as
many expect, Dobie has coached the
northerners for the last time, it is
not unlikely that he may be at the
head of the Bears next season, as
they have tried to secure his services
already.
Sword and Sandals To
Initiate "Hay" Murray.
"Bay" Murray, '17, will be initiated
into Sword and Sandals tonight at a
meeting held for that purpose. Mur
ray was elected to membership some
time ago, but was not able to be in
itiated on account of being train
ing for football. A banquet at the
Stanford Inn will follow the initiation.
