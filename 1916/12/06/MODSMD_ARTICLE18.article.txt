Editor The Daily Palo Alto:
Sir: Although the damnuisance
mentioned by you may be made neces
sary by the thoughtlessness, and in
civility of drivers of motorcycles and
automobiles, yet proper planning and
foresight in conjunction, by diverting
tragic into more convenient channels,
would have obviated the necessity of
these chain barriers.
They stand as monuments to that
policy which has allowed such a con
dition to come into being—namely,
bap-hazard hand-to-mouth develop
ment—the bane of most of our Ameri
can cities.
Under the present administration it
is to be expected that a permanent,
far-siglited, competent board will be
appointed to develop the ground plan
of the University along logical and ar
tistic lines.
Such opportunities for community
development along artistic and con
venient lines as exist at Stanford
would make the heart of any enthus
iastic city planner turn turtle with
ambition.
The past waste of these opportuni
ties makes anyone that has observed
it exceedingly disappointed.
Sincerely
T. H. C.
