# "The Concert" Brings $300 to Clinic Fund
## 
### 
Although a full report has not yet
been made as to the amount netted
for the Stanford clinics by the pro
duction here of "The Concert," on
November 27, approximate estimates
indicate that $300 will be the sum
brought to the fund through the ef
forts of the San Mateo players.
A complete report will not be avail
able until the return of Mrs. Parmer
Fuller, Jr., from a visit to Southern
California. Inasmuch as the gross in
come was about $400, and expenses not
more than $100, it is probable that the
Campus Auxiliary will be able to
place $300 in the hands of the San
Francisco clinics.
