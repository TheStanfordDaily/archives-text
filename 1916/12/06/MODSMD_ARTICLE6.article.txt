## 
### 
Final competition in the interfra
ternity and intcrclub rugby scries will
be completed tomorrow afternoon at
4:30, when the Zeta Psi-Alpha Delta
Phi combination hooks up with the
Kappa Sigma-El Toro fifteen to play
off the tie which ended the first game
between the two teams. The winning
team of tomorrow's contest will re
ceive the Timothy Hopkins trophy, to
l)e held for one year.
The series has stimulated a great
deal of enthusiasm largely because of
the excellent brand of rugby which
has been displayed in practically all
of the contests. From the exhibition
put up last Tuesday afternoon, when
Kappa Sigma and El Toro held Zeta
Psi and Alpha Delta Phi to a score
less tic in a game that was played sev
eral minutes over time, tomorrow's
tangle is expected to bring out a high
order of rugby.
Neither of the two teams at the
present time appears to have any per
ceptible advantage. Kappa Sigma and

El Toro combination won their first
game easily and then upset all dope
by defeating the strong Phi Delta
Theta and Breakers combination by
a It to 0 score. They earned the
right to compete in the finals by de
feating Phi Kappa Psi and Pine Cot
tage.
Zeta Psi and Alpha Delta Phi started
their season by defeating Delta Tail
Delta and Alpha Tan Omega in a fast
game, the score standing 6 to 0. The
second game proved to be one of the
closest of the series and was only won
in the last few minutes of play, when
"Dutch" Henry of the Zeta Psi-Alpha
Delta Phi fifteen carried the ball
across for a try. A bye was drawn so
that no third game was played.
Captains of the two teams have lined
up their men for tomorrow's contest
as follows:
Zeta Psi-Alpha Delta Phi —Henry,
Single, front rank; Janssen, Meural,
Chandler, middle rank; Millington,
Brann, rear rank; Scott, wing l'or
