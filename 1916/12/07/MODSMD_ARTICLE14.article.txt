# Sees Danger In Ultra-Practical
## Dr. Reinhardt, of Mills College. Gives 7 Precepts for College Students 
### 
"The Quest of Diogenes," as a lec
ture subject, is deceptive. Dr. Aurelia
Reinhardt, president of Mills College,
today told an Assembly audience lit
tle of Greek philosophy and much of
the average American, of his hanker
ing to follow the line of least resist
ance, and of his eagerness to accept
the pragmatism of today, which
scants old ideals in favor of more
practical learning.
Education Too Practical.
"The ideal of American education,"
said Dr. Reinhardt, "is truth and
light." Our education, she explained,
tending to follow the school of Diog
enes, has reached a higher pragmatism
â€”a profound practicalness, which
threatens to ignore the ideals for the
practical, and to substitute the pop
ular for the truly democratic.
Points Out Seven Precepts.
Dr. Reinhardt summarized her be
liefs in seven precepts, which may bo
interpreted as follows:
1. Don't neglect college for the "big
city."
2. Don't lose too much in pursuit
of the identical, in imitation, for
saking imagination, inertia, and init
iative.
3. Beware of speed, of acceleration.
Remember that Ood manes a pumpkin
grow in six weeks, but permits an
oak to take 100 years.
4. Beware of noise. Don't feel that
everything can be uttered in a shout.
Much can be expressed by silence.
5. Be careful of your interpretation
of the words of the Biblical command-
ment, that divides the week into six
days of work and one of rest. You
should think more of the six days
than of the one.
6. Learn to know yourself, especi
ally in relations to others. Know
your work and do it.
In her seventh precept Dr. Rein
liardt told her audience of the sig
nificance of Americanism today.
"Americans have much to do," she
said. "We cannot sit still. Freedom
gives every man a chance to sit on
a soft sofa, his feet very high, smok
ing a cigarette, even in the face of
doom. But freedom is by no means
the cue for laziness. We must act
with the spirit of mobilization rather
than in the spirit of the mob."
