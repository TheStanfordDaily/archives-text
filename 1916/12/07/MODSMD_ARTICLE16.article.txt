# MERIT SYSTEM
## 
### 
This afternoon's election of Frank
Jacques Leard to the editorship of
The Daily Palo Alto insures a high
standard and efficient direction of the
student publication for the spring se
mester. The promotion is well mer
ited, following three and a half years
of commendable, conscientious jour
nalism, which rendered Leard's ser
vices invaluable. With sincere pleas
ure the present administration of The
Daily Palo Alto extends its congratu
lations and bestows official blessing
upon Volume 50. Simultaneously a
few words might be said regarding the
merit system now in vogue.
* * * *
During the past quarter-century,
the editorship of The Daily Palo
Alto has been on a semi-appointive
basis, the managing editor advancing
to the final post without competition,
the tradition being broken on only
four occasions out of a total of fifty.
Between the span of freshmen and
senior years, seven editors pass upon
the ability of the various reporters,
ranking the staff according to indus
try and promise displayed. That the
existing system involves absolute jus
tice and integrity will be attested to
by all who have been in any way
connected with the student publica
tion. In lieu of the fact that the
public has no means to secure even a
glimpse of the ability of the candi
dates but must either vote upon rec
ommendation of the staff or other
wise upon mere popularity, it would
seem highly advisable that the merit
system might be guaranteed in the
future through changing the present
manner of election so that each edi
tor hereafter may recommend his suc
cessor with the approval of the Ex
ecutive Committee.
