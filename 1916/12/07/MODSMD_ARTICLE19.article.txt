AH, THERE'S THE RlIB!
The scene is heaven. At the gat©
sits the Committee 011 Admission and
Advanced Standing, and towering
above them, swinging on a chain, St.
Peter.
Ist Committeeman —Let me make a
suggestion—that we test applicants
more thoroughly on their sense of ob
servation.
2d Comm. —Yes, let's. How about
that, St. Pete?
St. Peter —O. K. with me.
(Enter an applicant. She is young
and fair, and carries a diploma.)
2d Comm. —Are you on the pre
ferred list?
App.—Not up here.
2d Comm. —Where, then, are you
preferred?
App.—On my college campus. Dear
old Stanford, how I loved
Ist Comm. —Tut, tut, my dear young
lady. Do not reveal sorority secrets
among strangers. Being as you are a
recent graduate, we would test your
power of observation ere we admit
you.
App.—Shoot!
Ist Comm. —How many of your men
acquaintances are bow-legged?
App.—l—beg—your—pardon!
Ist. Comm —Tut, tut again. No harm
meant. Think!
App.—l've never seen any of my
friends in military uniform.
Ist Comm. —But there's another
way—in their campus clothes, —
think!
App—Think! Me, a college grad!
2d Comm. —My dear young lady—
you must answer this admission re
quirement. We must test your power
of observation!
App.—Bow-legged! Eureka! I have
it! It's Wobbly Bill —he's as bow
legged as a bulldog.
Ist Comm.—How do you know?
2d Comm. —Ah, there's the rub!
App.—Ah, there's NO rub! That's
how I know he's bow-legged. When
Wobbly Bill walks fast his corduroys
never scrape with that melodious
whine.
St. Pter —You're admitted!
App.—Heavenly! I'm tickled!
