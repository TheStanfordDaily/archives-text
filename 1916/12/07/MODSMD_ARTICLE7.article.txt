# STANFORD IN P.C.C. WITH THREE SPORTS
## E.C. BEHRENS BACK Track, Basketball, and Crew Arranged in Scheduleâ€”Baseball Undecided 
### 
Graduate Manager Behrens returned
from his northern trip last night, and
is well pleased with the arrangements
made for Cardinal competition with
Washington and Oregon universities.
Though four games come under the
rulings of the northern conference so
far as Stanford is concerned, but three
major sports were arranged for, bas
ketball, track, and crew. Baseball
schedules were not made, though it
was agreed that if any team goes
north, it will be the winner of the
Stanford-California series.
Conference Track at Seattle.
The Pacific Coast Conference track
meet will be held at Seattle this year
on May 19, at which time the new field
of the University of Washington will
be dedicated. This will be after the
California universities have closed
their doors for the summer, but the
northern institutions will still be run
ning full blast. It is probable .that
a year from now the annual track
meet will be held in California, the
plan being to alternate the location
in the different states.
Triangular Hegntta April 14.
Arrangements were made by Stan
ford, California, and Washington, for
the triangular crew regatta at Oak
land estuary again this year. Cali
fornia and Stanford prefer to hold
this e'vent on the morning of April
14, the date of the Big Meet between
the two track teams of the universi
ties, held this year in Berkeley. How
ever, Washington must secure permis
sion from the faculty to come south
