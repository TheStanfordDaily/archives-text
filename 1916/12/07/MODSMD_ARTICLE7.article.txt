# STANFORD IN P.C.C. WITH THREE SPORTS
## E.C. BEHRENS BACK Track, Basketball, and Crew Arranged in Scheduleâ€”Baseball Undecided 
### 
Graduate Manager Behrens returned
from his northern trip last night, and
is well pleased with the arrangements
made for Cardinal competition with
Washington and Oregon universities.
Though four games come under the
rulings of the northern conference so
far as Stanford is concerned, but three
major sports were arranged for, bas
ketball, track, and crew. Baseball
schedules were not made, though it
was agreed that if any team goes
north, it will be the winner of the
Stanford-California series.
Conference Track at Seattle.
The Pacific Coast Conference track
meet will be held at Seattle this year
on May 19, at which time the new field
of the University of Washington will
be dedicated. This will be after the
California universities have closed
their doors for the summer, but the
northern institutions will still be run
ning full blast. It is probable .that
a year from now the annual track
meet will be held in California, the
plan being to alternate the location
in the different states.
Triangular Hegntta April 14.
Arrangements were made by Stan
ford, California, and Washington, for
the triangular crew regatta at Oak
land estuary again this year. Cali
fornia and Stanford prefer to hold
this e'vent on the morning of April
14, the date of the Big Meet between
the two track teams of the universi
ties, held this year in Berkeley. How
ever, Washington must secure permis
sion from the faculty to come south
on that date. Tn case the Washing
ton oarsmen are not allowed to leave
Seattle for that date, the regatta will
probably be held a week earlier.
U. S. C. was not taken in as a mem
ber principally because no application
was made, according to Behrens, who
was not at the meeting when the
membership was discussed. The mem
bers now are Washington University,
Washington State, Oregon Agricul
tural College, Oregon, California, and
Stanford.
The basketball schedule has been
arranged so as to allow a maximum
amount of competition without much
loss of time from college studies.
Washington State College will meet
the University of Washington quintet
by January 27, and the winner of the
series will come south for two games
with Stanford, February 2 and 3, and
with California, January 30 and 31.
The Oregon Agricultural College will
settle the championship of the Web
foot state with the University of Ore
gon by a similar date and the winner
of this series will send a team south
to meet Stanford, February 21 and 22,
and with California, February 23
and 24.
Stanford and California will play
the first baskteball contest here on
February 17, and the second at Cali
fornia, March 3. In case of a tie, a
third game will be played on March
10, the place to be decided. The win
ner of the Conference championship
will be decided on a percentage basis
of games won out of the series of six
contests played on California soil.

Washington State College will meet
the University of Washington quintet
by January 27, and the winner of the
series will come south for two games
with Stanford, February 2 and 3, and
with California, January 30 and 31.
The Oregon Agricultural College will
settle the championship of the Web
foot state with the University of Ore
gon by a similar date and the winner
of this series will send a team south
to meet Stanford, February 21 and 22,
and with California, February 23
and 24.
Stanford and California will play
the first baskteball contest here on
February 17, and the second at Cali
fornia, March 3. In case of a tie, a
third game will be played on March
10, the place to be decided. The win
ner of the Conference championship
will be decided on a percentage basis
of games won out of the series of six
contests played on California soil.
Graduate Manager Behrens returned
from his northern trip last night, and
is well pleased with the arrangements
made for Cardinal competition with
Washington and Oregon universities.
Though four games come under the
rulings of the northern conference so
far as Stanford is concerned, but three
major sports were arranged for, bas
ketball, track, and crew. Baseball
schedules were not made, though it
was agreed that if any team goes
north, it will be the winner of the
Stanford-California series.
Conference Track at Seattle.
The Pacific Coast Conference track
meet will be held at Seattle this year
on May 19, at which time the new field
of the University of Washington will
be dedicated. This will be after the
California universities have closed
their doors for the summer, but the
northern institutions will still be run
ning full blast. It is probable .that
a year from now the annual track
meet will be held in California, the
plan being to alternate the location
in the different states.
Triangular Hegntta April 14.
Arrangements were made by Stan
ford, California, and Washington, for
the triangular crew regatta at Oak
land estuary again this year. Cali
fornia and Stanford prefer to hold
this e'vent on the morning of April
14, the date of the Big Meet between
the two track teams of the universi
ties, held this year in Berkeley. How
ever, Washington must secure permis
sion from the faculty to come south
on that date. Tn case the Washing
ton oarsmen are not allowed to leave
Seattle for that date, the regatta will
probably be held a week earlier.
U. S. C. was not taken in as a mem
ber principally because no application
was made, according to Behrens, who
was not at the meeting when the
membership was discussed. The mem
bers now are Washington University,
Washington State, Oregon Agricul
tural College, Oregon, California, and
Stanford.
The basketball schedule has been
arranged so as to allow a maximum
amount of competition without much
loss of time from college studies.
