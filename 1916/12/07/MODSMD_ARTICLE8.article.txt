# SOPHOMORES WIN BASKET TANGLE
## Bonney is Star, Scoring More Than Half of the Tallys for Nineteeners 
### 
Sophomores defeated the juniors for j
the interclass basketball championship
by a score of 3.") to 24 last night, in
the hardest fought game that has been
seen on the local floor this year. The
teams were within a few points of
each other all the way, and it was
only in the last few minutes when the
1919 men scored four baskets in sue-,
cession that the game was decided.
Long Throws Feature.
The contest was filled with unusual
plays. Sullivan for the sophomores
and Dolan for the juniors each made
a basket from the center of the floor,
while Bonney threw a score from the
most difficult angle of the court.;
Pelouze was not far behind with two;
phenomenal shots from hard posi-1
tions. The guarding was so close!
that few opportunities for scores from
an easy position were afforded.
Individuals Star.
Bonney for the sophomores was
easily the star of the contest, making
seven field baskets and throwing
seven free throws out of ten that he
attempted. In all he scored 21 points
for his team. Of the guards Sulli- |
van played by far the best game. He
scored 4 points and in addition was
all over the floor, keeping the juniors
from scoring several baskets. Pelouze,
playing only the first half, put up a
strong game, with three baskets to his
credit.
For the juniors, Jewett and Watson
were the stars. Grevc made three
baskets, but did not succeed in guard
ing his forward.
