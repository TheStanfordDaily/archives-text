# DR. JORDAN BACK AFTER LENGTHY PEACE TOUR
## AUPPERLE RETURNS Chancellor Emeritus Sees No Change in European Situation 
### 
Chancellor Emeritus David Starr
Jordan has returned to the campus
today after stumping the country for
peaco for almost two months, and
giving 67 lectures. H. V. Aupperle,
'17, track captain, who was Dr. Jor
dan's secretary on the trip, is also
hack.
Chancellor Jordan is feeling well.
He is glad to get back to Stanford,
where he will remain "until he gets
ready to go to The Hague." Dr. Jor
dan does not know when he will go to
Europe.
Sees No Change In Europe.
The European situation, as Dr. Jor
dan sees it, is practically the same as
it has been for many months. "I am
hoping to see peace soon," he said,'
"because very strong influences in all
nations are working for peace.
U. S. Should Act.
"United States, being the only well
person in the world, should exert it
self toward political sanitation. Pres
ident Wilson will act for peace when
ever any gain will come from his ac
tion. He will have to be his own
judge as to the proper time."
According to Dr. Jordan, the feel
ing in the United States against the
war is strongest west of the Appa
lachians, away from the large cities.
"That is what turned the election this
year," said Dr. Jordan. "People in the
east wanted war to continue for the
money in it. The west took a dif
ferent attitude. The west couldn't
dilly-dally. Waiting for a decisive vic
tory to end the war is just the same
as saying war will last indefinitely. I
can't prophesy when the war will be
over. The more one knows of the
forces at work in war, the less one
knows of when the war will end. The
American people must realize that war
is the most awful calamity that can
come, and that therefore every other
conceivable plan should be consid
ered and tried before war is resorted
to."
