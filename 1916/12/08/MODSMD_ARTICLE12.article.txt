# 4 QUARTER YEAR SYSTEM TO BE ADOPTED
## TO BEGIN OCTOBER 1 Plan Will Give Present Student Body Long Summer Recess 
### 
Stanford University will remain in
session the year around beginning
with October of this year, and will
divide the academic year into four in
stead of two semesters as at present.
The Academic Council reached this
decision at its meeting yesterday af
ternoon, and declared in favor of the
plan, "provided that adequate finan
cial support can be secured." That
this support will be given by the Board
of Trustees is the opinion of Presi
dent Wilbur, by whom the plan had
been informally presented to the Board
before the faculty's action yesterday.
Long 1917 Vacation.
The present Stanford student body
will be most directly and immediately
affected by the change through the
four-and-one-half months vacation
during the coming summer. The final
examinations will end on May 16,
while fall registration will begin on
Monday, October 1. In the future the
vacation period for those students
who merely substitute three short
terms for the present two semesters
will be from the middle of June to
! the first of October. September will
j lie the one vacation month for all.
Way Graduate in Three Years.
Students who wish may graduate in
three academic years if they remain
in s college all four semesters for three
consecutive years. On the other
hand, it is expected that by far the
greater number of students will con
tinue to attend only a part of the
year, taking four years for the course.
It is thought that for the first few
years the greater number of students
during the summer session will con
sist of teachers and special students
who are otherwise occupied during
the regular academic year

The fall semester, under the new
plan, will begin on October 1, and
will continue for twelve weeks to De
cember 21. The winter quarter will
date from January 2 to March 22, a
period of eleven weeks. The spring
quarter will begin after the Easter
recess on April 1 and will continue
for eleven weeks to June 13. The
summer quarter will then run for
eleven weeks from June 18 to August
31, leaving only September as a vaca
