# Eastern Trip for Card Nine Assured
## Faculty Objections to Trip are Not Thought to be Serious 
### 
Graduate Manager Behrens an
nounced today that it was definitely
settled that the Stanford varsity base
ball team would go east during the
I coming summer. There is but one ob
stacle to the contemplated trip, and
that is objection by the faculty. It
is doubtful if the University authori
ties will oppose the trip, because none
of the games will be played during
the college year and the team will not
leave until final examinations are
over.
Financed by Easterners.
The schedule of contests has not
been arranged, but Graduate Manager
Behrens will have the complete list
of games to give to the public some
time during the Christmas vacation.
The trip is being financed by the
Eastern colleges, who are anxious to
meet the Cardinal and who believe
that the far western nine will be a
big drawing card. It is expected that
the whole trip will take one month or
perhaps a little longer.
Games will not only be played with
some of the universities in the mid
dle west, but the principal contests
of the tour will be staged with the big
teams on the far eastern seaboard.
Yale, Harvard, Columbia, Princeton,
Cornell and Pennsylvania will all be
met by the traveling Cards.
