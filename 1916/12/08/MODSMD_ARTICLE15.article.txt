# GOODBYE-GOOD LUCK!

### 
With the last jingle of the linotype
and final rumble of the press, Volume
Forty-Nine of The Daily Palo Alto is
this afternoon laid permanently on
the shelf —thus concluding its journal
istic career. Verily, just preceding
the drop of the curtain, the scene af
fords rare opportunity for soliloquy
and moralization; but at this climactic
moment the editorial "we" drops the
traditional role in order to express a
sincere and heartfelt sentiment.
Should there be credit cast upon this
volume, let it be bestowed entirely
upon the staff members, who toiled
unselfishly throughout the semester.
*****
The outside public little realizes the
excessive grind, the long hours and
amount of work undergone by the
handful of reporters and news-editors
when daily combing the campus for
items, and in their subsequent publica
tion. Tonight, though but a barren
appreciation, glance over the list of
staff names who have shouldered the
heavy burden of the task —and give
them just credit. To the editorial
"we" belongs no share.
*****
Contrary to the usual custom, a de
parture is made from the narrow
path just long enough to underscore
and praise the efforts of one staff
member—Herbert S. Marshutz. His
assistance has been invaluable and his
work both faithful and brilliant, an
asset to Stanford journalism.
*****
To its readers, Volume Forty-Nine
bids a sorrowful yet hearty Aufwieder
sehen.
