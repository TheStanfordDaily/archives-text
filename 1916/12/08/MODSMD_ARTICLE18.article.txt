"Any rags, any bags, any old
clothes?" This is the newest cry on
the campus. It comes out via the Y.
W. C. A. and the Y. M. C. A.
Next Thursday will be old clothes
day at Stanford. On that day the local
Christian organizations will collect
clothes from sororities, fraternities
and clubs, to be turned over to the
Associated Charities for Christmas
gifts to the poor.
Mrs. Elliott Publishes
Book of Verse.
Mrs. Ellen Coit Elliott, wife of Reg
istrar O. L. Elliott, is the author of a
little book of thirteen poems called
"In Xanadu: A Fantasy of the Expo
sition." The poems were inspired by
the Panama-Pacific Exposition, and
take as their theme Coleridge's legend
of "Kubla Khan." Distinctive fea
tures of the exposition are the sub
jects for the different poems, and each
brings out some artistic verse which
is enhanced by the writer's keen ob
servation.
The book, which is illustrated, has
been put on sale at the Bookstore.
Special Musical Service
Sunday Evening.
I Special musical services will be
held in the Memorial Church, Sunday
evening, at 7:30 o'clock. Mr. L. H.
Eaton, organist, has planned the pre
sentation of several unusual numbers,
and toward that end the choir has
been practicing all semester. Mr.
Savannah of the San Francisco Sav
annah Quartet will assist in the ser
vices. Miss Edith Harvey and Miss
Esther Liversidge will be special solo-
I ists for the evening.
Geog. I Students Will
Take Final Dec. 13.
Georgraphy I students will come
prepared to take their final examina
tion on Wednesday, the 13th of De
; cember, instead of on the last day of
final week, as scheduled. Prepara
tion, in addition to knowledge of the
work, consists of bringing the little
globes previously exhibited on the
Quadrangle.
This unusual occurrence is due to
the fact that the class is so large that
examination papers could not be cor-
I rected before Christmas. The final
lecture period will be given over to
the examination if the authority be
granted by the Committee on Sched
ule, according to Professor Bailey
I Willis.

chairman of the faculty committee on

Geog. I Students Will
Take Final Dec. 13.
Georgraphy I students will come
prepared to take their final examina
tion on Wednesday, the 13th of De
; cember, instead of on the last day of
final week, as scheduled. Prepara
tion, in addition to knowledge of the
work, consists of bringing the little
globes previously exhibited on the
Quadrangle.

I rected before Christmas. The final
lecture period will be given over to
the examination if the authority be
granted by the Committee on Sched
ule, according to Professor Bailey
I Willis.
