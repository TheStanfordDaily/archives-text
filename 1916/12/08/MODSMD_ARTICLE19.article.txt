# Grainger at Piano Pleases Big Crowd
## Artist is Master of Technique But His Own Compositions Lack Perfect Unity 
### F.J. Leard, '17 
Percy Grainger, although perhaps
not a Paderewski, gave a very credit
able interpretation of some of the
great masters of composition in the
Assembly Hall last evening. The
concert was a success, in that it en
tertained most of the large crowd
present. The Peninsula Musical As
sociation is to be congratulated on
securing the attraction. Mr. Grainger
has not appeared in the United States
to any great extent, having almost
confined himself to European tours,
and was consequently received with
not a little curiosity.
Mastery of Technique.
The program served very well to
bring out the fact that the artist has
a mastery of technique seldom found
in so young a man. He excelled in
the interpretation of three well chosen
selections from Chopin, perhaps the
most enjoyable numbers of the eve
ning from an artistic standpoint.
From the standpoint of execution, the
Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 by Liszt,
was most remarkable. In this num
ber Grainger's unique individuality
was striking.
The Debussy selections, essentially
compositions for the piano, Schu
mann's Sonta in G minor, and Brahms'
Intermezzo in E flat Op. 117 No. 1,
while somewhat less impressive, were
nevertheless well rendered, and helped
to establish Grainger's reputation as a
player of individual brilliancy among
the people of the Peninsula.
Of Percy Grainger, the composer, it
must be said that he was disappoint
ing in some respects, at least upon
first acquaintance. Though his work
is intricate, and extremely interesting
as something different, it seems to
lack the unity of well constructed
composition.
He played seven of his own pieces
during the evening, four being on the
program and three encores. His orig
inal Colonial Song succeeds admir
ably in doing just what he wanted it
to do â€”express the shifting moods
which might be called forth by the
changing scenery of his native coun
try.
For encores Grainger played his
own compositions "The Stanford Gig,"
"Irish Tune from County Derry," and
"Gay but Wistful."
