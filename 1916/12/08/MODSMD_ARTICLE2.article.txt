# Written Agreement for Rival Ruggers
## Stanford and Santa Clara Will Draw up Rules to Govern Athletic Relations 
### 
. Stanford and the University of
Santa Clara will be bound by a formal
written agreement that will include
all athletic relations between the two
institutions, if plans promulgated here
today by Father Sullivan, athletic mod
erator of the Mission Town college,
and E. C. Behrens, materialize. There
will be a meeting of the athletic com
mittees of the rival universities some
time during the Christmas vacation,
and the agreement will be drawn up.
Stricter IJiilos to Bind S. C.
It is understood that Santa Clara is
anxious to have the same scholar
ship requirements that are in force
at Stanford. _ The freshmen ruling
will probably not be included in the
agreement, because of the small num
ber of studenLs attending the Cath
olic college. Otherwise, the rules and
regulations will be the same as those
that bind Stanford and California in
the spring sports.
Big Game November 10.
November 10, 1917, has been definite
ly decided upon as the date of the
Big Came next year. The contest
will probably be staged in San Fran
cisco as was the case this season and
last year, but it is not certain. There
has been a good deal of dissatisfac
tion with the seating arrangements at
Ewing Field, and another more suit
able location may be found to hold the
feature rugby tangle.
