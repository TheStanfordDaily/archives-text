who will appear at the opening pro

many a San Francisco audience at
concerts; Ralph Allen, whistler, from
the Orpheum circuit, and two four
piece orchestras. Miss d' Aubigny
will sing both classical and popular
numbers in her solos.
The Wilson Company expects to
show friends of the store that the
Wilson service will be better than

of comfort and beauty. The Wilson
force is being organized to equal any
service on the coast. No change in
prices will take place by reason of this
de luxe service.
The new Wilson store is fitted out
to seat over one hundred patrons at

cozy, with thick leather seats, and are

along the peninsula by reason of the
luncheon service, which will be in
stalled in addition to the usual Wil
son catering. —Publicity.
