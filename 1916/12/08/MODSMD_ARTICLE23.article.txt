# Dec.15 Dead Line for Quad Photos
## 
### 
The aim of the 1918 Quad manage
ment to contain more junior pictures
than any previous annual will not be
realized unless all Eighteeners who
have not already paid their dues and
had photographs taken by Davey, at
tend to the matter at once.
Any member of the Junior Class
who fails to pay his dues before Fri
day, December 15, will be excluded
from representation in the class pho
tograph section. "No dues; no pic
ture," says Manager Weeks.
