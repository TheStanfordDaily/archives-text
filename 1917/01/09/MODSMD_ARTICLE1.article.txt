Stanford won four out of five bas
ketball games played on their trip
south during the Christmas recess.
Defeats by large scores were reg
istered against the champion Whittier
team, University of Southern Cali
fornia, Los Angeles Athletic Club, and
Long Beach Y. M. C. A. Only at Or
ange Athletic Club was the varsity
forced to accept the short end of the
score.
Bonney and Wliently Star.
Bonney, the lightning forward, and
Captain Wheatly were the stars of
the trip. Bonney had a case of basket
fever, with the result that he made
from six to eleven baskets each game
and in addition was successful in
converting a large number of free
throws that he attempted. Although
Wheatly did not make as many bas
kets as his team-mate, his .playing
was not far behind because of his
wonderful defensive work. Of the
guards, Greve put up an especially
strong game, while Dolan was not far
behind in the defensive department.
At Whittier, where the team met the
new coach, Russel Wilson, for the
first time, and in the game against
the Long Beach Y. M. C. A., the Stan
ford five played the best games of the
series. Captain Wheatly was not in
the game against Orange Athletic
Club, and Roney was not in good con
dition. Had these two men been
going strong the quintet might not
have been forced to accept the short
end of the score in this contest.
Faculty Axe.
All the players out for the team
were successful in avoiding the fac
ulty axe, so the fine team work that
was displayed in every game on the
trip will not be broken up. Regular
practice under coach Wilson is being
held in preparation for the opening
of the season in a week.
Russell Wilson met the team before
the Los Angeles Athletic Club game,
and finished the trip with the five.
His coaching was largely responsible
for the clever teamwork and fine
shooting of the men throughout the
series. Wilson has a reputation of the
finest basketball trainer in southern
California and should turn out a win
ner this year.
The men who made the trip are
captain Wheatly, Bonney, Dolan,
Greve, Estes, Roney, Righter, and Sul
livan.
