# Shift Inn to Make Place for Library
## Many Improvements are Made on Campusâ€”Rooms in Encina are Filled 
### 
Moving of Stanford Inn to a site
opposite Wilson's campus store is
practically completed, and destruc
tion of Pine Cottage will soon begin,
in order to clear ground for the con
struction of the half-million-dollar
Jewel library, which will be the cen
tral architectural unit of the second
quadrangle. Actual work on the
library itself will begin the last of
this month or the first of February.
Meals will be served in the Inn, be
ginning today, despite the fact that
it is being moved, it being necessary
to give it a quarter-turn to make the
main entrance face the quad.
Occupy New Encina Rooms.
Most of the new rooms on the fifth
floor and basement of Encina Hall
were taken at the close of college,
last semester, and the remainder have
been set aside for entering students.
Three additional double rooms will be
created, when the alcoves on the sec
ond, third and fourth floors of the
men's dormitory, over the entrance
lobby on the ground lloor, are walled
off.
Having finished the exterior walls
of the $80,000 Thomas Wclton Stan
ford Art Museum, the first building
of the new quadrangle, workmen are
now engaged in the construction of
the roof, which will be partly of con
crete slabs and partly of glass. As
an overhead lighting was desired,
practically 110 windows are provided
in the building, which will be finished
in March.
Start Bandstand.
Work is in progress on the $10,000
bandstand, situated to the rear of the
plot between the Union and the
Women's Club House. This will serve
as a platform for band concerts, and
as a stage for outdoor plays and Uni
versity gatherings too large for the
Assembly Hall. Benches purchased
from the Panama-Pacific Exposition
will be placed in front of the band
stand.
Finish Mosaic Repairs.
Repair of the mosaics of the Mem
orial Church destroyed by the earth
quake of 1906, has just been com
pleted during the Christmas holi
days, Salviati & Company of Venice,
Italy, repairing some minor injuries
to the mosaics on the museum, as a
gift to the University.
Lorenzo Zampato, quaint Italian ar
tisan in charge of the mosaic work,
has left for his home in Italy, to re
tire. He put the mosaic work into
the original church, commencing his
task in 1902. During all the time he
has spent in this country, he has
steadfastly refused to learn any Eng
lish.
Ten thousand dollars has been ex
pended on repairing the accoustic-i of
the Memorial Church, and as a re
sult the ceiling of the interior pre
sents a different, though not less
pleasing, appearance, and echoes are
110 longer possible, due to the felt
pads concealed behind the wooden
panels.
New classrooms in the basement of
the English building have been com
pleted, and will be used this semester.
The interior of the main room of the
business office has been partitioned
off, for the greater convenience of its
various departments.
All but the finishing touches have
been completed of the new $22,000
campus schoolhouse on Lasuen. Out
of-door classroom conditions are
made possible by the construction of
the attractive building.

quake of 1906, has just been com
pleted during the Christmas holi
days, Salviati & Company of Venice,
Italy, repairing some minor injuries
to the mosaics on the museum, as a
gift to the University.
Lorenzo Zampato, quaint Italian ar
tisan in charge of the mosaic work,
has left for his home in Italy, to re
tire. He put the mosaic work into
the original church, commencing his
task in 1902. During all the time he
has spent in this country, he has
steadfastly refused to learn any Eng
lish.
Ten thousand dollars has been ex
pended on repairing the accoustic-i of
the Memorial Church, and as a re
sult the ceiling of the interior pre
sents a different, though not less
pleasing, appearance, and echoes are
110 longer possible, due to the felt
pads concealed behind the wooden
panels.
New classrooms in the basement of
the English building have been com
pleted, and will be used this semester.
The interior of the main room of the
business office has been partitioned
off, for the greater convenience of its
various departments.
All but the finishing touches have
been completed of the new $22,000
campus schoolhouse on Lasuen. Out
of-door classroom conditions are
made possible by the construction of
the attractive building.
Moving of Stanford Inn to a site
opposite Wilson's campus store is
practically completed, and destruc
tion of Pine Cottage will soon begin,
in order to clear ground for the con
struction of the half-million-dollar
Jewel library, which will be the cen
tral architectural unit of the second
quadrangle. Actual work on the
library itself will begin the last of
this month or the first of February.
Meals will be served in the Inn, be
ginning today, despite the fact that
it is being moved, it being necessary
to give it a quarter-turn to make the
main entrance face the quad.
Occupy New Encina Rooms.
Most of the new rooms on the fifth
floor and basement of Encina Hall
were taken at the close of college,
last semester, and the remainder have
been set aside for entering students.
Three additional double rooms will be
created, when the alcoves on the sec
ond, third and fourth floors of the
men's dormitory, over the entrance
lobby on the ground lloor, are walled
off.
Having finished the exterior walls
of the $80,000 Thomas Wclton Stan
ford Art Museum, the first building
of the new quadrangle, workmen are
now engaged in the construction of
the roof, which will be partly of con
crete slabs and partly of glass. As
an overhead lighting was desired,
practically 110 windows are provided
in the building, which will be finished
in March.
Start Bandstand.
Work is in progress on the $10,000
bandstand, situated to the rear of the
plot between the Union and the
Women's Club House. This will serve
as a platform for band concerts, and
as a stage for outdoor plays and Uni
versity gatherings too large for the
Assembly Hall. Benches purchased
from the Panama-Pacific Exposition
will be placed in front of the band
stand.
