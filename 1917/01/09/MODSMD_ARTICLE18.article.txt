# NOT A MERE MIRROR
## 
### 
We have often heard it stated that
The Daily Palo Alto should exist as a
mere mirror of student opinion, re
flecting what the majority of students
think with faithful precision. Al
though it is not our intention to talk
much of policy at this time, we wish
to repudiate any such idea. The Daily
does not subscribe to an "ear-to-the
ground" platform.
Due to its peculiar position in the
college community, however, it seems
that there should be something of the
mirror in the nature of The Daily.
No matter what may be its stand on
a particular question, we feel that in
dividuals or groups should have the
right to be heard through the columns
of this paper. In order that this may
be accomplished, no communication
of reasonable length will be rejected
on the ground that it is not in accord
with the policy of The Daily. Through
the medium of "Another Viewpoint"
we expect to hear from those who
have ideas which they want to ex
press.
Otherwise, we reserve the privilege
of scraping a little of the mercury
from the back of the mirror now and
then, and the right of interpreting the
things seen on the other side to the
best of our ability. By such an ar
rangement, all corners on the ex
pression of independent thought will
be eliminated.
