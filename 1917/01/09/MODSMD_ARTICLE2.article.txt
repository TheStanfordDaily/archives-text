# Baseball Prospects Were Never Better
## Six Veterans Will Form Strong Nucleus for Good Team on Diamond. 
### 
Prospects for a winning combina
tion on the baseball diamond never
looked brighter at Stanford than they
do now. Captain "Doc" Hayes has
fully recovered from his serious in
jury sustained during the summer, and
will be able to hold down first base
in his old-time form, while the nine
will be greatly assisted by the coach
ing of Russel T. Wijson, who takes
the reins for the first time on Friday,
when the squad gets together to start
the season.
"Vets'' on Deck.
Lander, Hoever, Mattel, Bihlman,
Xoonan, Campbell, Stevens, IJraden,
and possibly Canborn, of last year's
varsity, will be on deck to form a
nucleus for a winning team. Shriver,
Lilly, Reagon, E. Mitchell, R. Mitch
ell and Hoydston of the freshmen
nine, will be eligible for varsity com
petition. The team promises to be a
speedy bunch of ball tossers, and give
the Cardinal strong hopes of a victory
over California in the national pas
time.
As has been the case for the past
few years, a peanut league will be or
ganized and will start playing on next
Monday night. Captains will be ap
pointed immediately, trophies for the
winner of the series, the best, batter,
and the best fielder, will bo put up,
and as both the auxiliary and faculty
diamonds have been re-surfaced, the
farming league for varsity players
should have a prosperou i season.
