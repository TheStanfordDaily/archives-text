football and in all contests this
spring, the rival teams will play un
; der a more definite agreement and
under stricter regulations than was
the case last year. The graduate
managers of both universities are
working on an agreement that will
bind the opposing teams. It is under
stood that Stanford will not request
Santa Clara to abolish freshmen in
intercollegiate athletics on account of
the limited number of students in the
Mission Town college, but the mem
bers of the various teams will be
forced to meet the same scholarship
requirements that are in force at Stan
ford.
When an agreement is framed, it
will be presented to the athletic
boards of both universities and be
fore the executive committee of Stan
ford for approval. All actions toward
this end so far are unofficial and the
terms only tentative, but it is under
stood that an agreement will be in
force soon .
