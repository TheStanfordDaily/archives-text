# Stanford Men to Leave for French Service in Month
## 
### 
Twenty Stanford men will leave the
campus about the first of February
for France, where they will form the
Stanford unit of the American Am
bulance service organized at the Uni
versity by San Francisco business
men through J. li. Eastman '18.
The donors of the money to allow
the men to make the trip to France
and to maintain themselves while
there do not wish to have their names
known, and to avoid this have organ
ized into the "Friends of France" So
ciety to handle the trip. Several
thousands of dollars have been sub
scribed by them and arrangements
made to keep the men in France at
least a year and in some cases until
the completion of the war.
Those in charge of the movement
are refusing to give out a list of the
men going or details of the trip. Men
who have already made arrangements
to go, however, are R. A. Griffin, '17,
R. R. Speers, '18, H. C. Hlote, '18, J.
H. Eastman, '18, C. A. Randau, '19,
W. J. Losh, '17.
