# Acacia Disbands and Returns its Charter
## 
### 
Stanford chapter of Acacia, the na
tional association of Masons in uni
versities, has given up its charter in
the fraternity, and will be disbanded
at the end of this semester. The
house will be run as a club until the
present lease runs out.
Requirements in the fraternity that
a man must be twenty-one years old
before he could become a member has
made it very hard to keep the chapter
large enough to keep down tiie ex
penses of maintaining the house.
The local Acacia was the second
chapter of the fraternity to be found
ed, the first being established at the
University of Michigan. The organ
ization has been maintained here since
1904.
