# EIGHTY STUDENTS DISMISSED FOR POOR WORK
## MORE THAN IN 1915 Sixty-Six Get First Failures, Forty-Six on Probation at Semester End 
### 
Eighty students have fallen victims
to the faculty axe, and have been dis
missed from college on account of
poor scholarship. Previous announce
ments set the flunk-out mortality at
seventy-three, but a number of doubt
ful cases have met with an adverse
decision since then.
According to the revised totals,
sixty-six students went on first fail
ure, and forty-six were placed on pro
bation. A freshman not making half
of his hours, or an upperclassman not
making two-thirds of his hours, are
given a "first failure," and are al
lowed to return the following semes
ter, on probation. A student who
makes sufficient hours, but whose
work is unsatisfactory as a whole,
may be placed on simple probation.
Comparison with last year's figures
shows that fifty-three students out of
a total enrollment of 2055 flunked out
at Christmas time, as compared to the
eighty out of 2029 this year. A year
ago eighty-six received first failures,
and fifty-one went on probation, as
compared to the sixty-six and forty
six, respectively, this year.
