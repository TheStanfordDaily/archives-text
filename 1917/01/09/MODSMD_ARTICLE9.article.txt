# Four-Quarter System Causes Spring Rugby
## Captain Lachmund to Conduct Workouts in Preparation for 1917 Season 
### 
Rugby practice will be held this
spring semester for the first time at
Stanford University in many years.
Captain Otto Lachmund states that the
reason for having workouts this se
mester is due to the shortness of the
football season next fall.
When the four-quarter system is
inaugurated the University will not
open until about the first of Octobcr.
This would leave only this month for
selecting the varsity fifteen, as the
Santa Clara game is scheduled for
November. One month would be alto
gether too short a time to sclect and
condition the squad, hence the neces
sity for spring practice.
Lacliiniiiid in Charge.
"Pretty" Lachmund will have charge
of the workouts and will be assisted
by other varsity men. Three nights
a week are scheduled for light prac
tice. The men will be divided into
squads and games between the squads
will furnish the practice. Interspersed
with these will be games with outside
tedrns. Captain Lachmund will an
nounce in the near future the day upon
which be will start the spring work.
Prospects for a bright season with
good competition are predicted for
next fall. One of the first schools to
signify its intention of putting a
rugby fifteen out next season is the
Oregon Agricultural College. Grad
uate Manager Behrens has scheduled
a game with them for October 27 on
the Stanford turf. The Aggies have
always turned out good teams in all
sports so they are expected to have a
strong fifteen for the fray.
The Multonomah Athletic Club of
Portland are also entering a team in
the field and negotiations are under
way now for a game with them.
In addition to these games a trip to
the Northwest has been arranged for
rugby fifteen with games in Van
couver, Victoria, Portland, and Spo
kane.
