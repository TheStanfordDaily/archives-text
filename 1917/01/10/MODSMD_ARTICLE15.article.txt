Stanford's basketball five bas re
turned from a most successful tour
of Southern California, bringing with
it four scalps—the result of five en
counters with southern teams—and a
full measure of glory for the Cardinal.
If any student still harbored a doubt
concerning the ellicacy of raising bas
ketball to a major sport, it surely
must be dispelled by the remarkable
showing made during the holidays.
Basketball should not, however, be
accepted only because it looks like a
winner. It is a man's game through
and through, and one in which Stan
ford should be well represented and
which Stanford students should sup
port royally. The Cardinal five will
soon take the floor against strong
rivals, and these contests will be the
first of the spring athletic atractions.
Let's be there to cheer, no matter how
the game goes.
