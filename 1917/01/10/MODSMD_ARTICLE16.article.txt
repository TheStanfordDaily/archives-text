# A 						WORTHY PROJECT
## 
### 
Establishment of a bureau to serve
as a medium of employment between
graduate students and employers, is a
move which should be of the greatest
interest to all, and particularly to
upperclassmen. The method by which
the administration hopes to help place
all worthy alumni seeking for posi
tions will be explained at tomorrow's
assembly. Such institutions have
proved great successes throughout the
east, and are gradually being installed
in western universities.
A subject more worthy of the at
tention of all students would be hard
to imagine. The rule requiring fresh
men to attend assemblies should be
extended and self-imposed upon every
member of the University tomorrow
morning.
