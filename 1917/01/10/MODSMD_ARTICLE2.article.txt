# Uncork Ginger Jar at Rally Tomorrow
## Yell Leader Gilroy Makes Large Preparations for Encina Noise-Fest 
### 
Yell Leader Gilroy announces that
the annual combined spring sports
rally will start promptly at 7:45 to
morrow night at Encina Hall. As
there is not enough room for all the
students, those who are anxious to be
on deck for the noise-opener will prob
ably congregate in the Hall earlier.
Spirit that has been smouldering over
the vacation, will easily be revived
with Stanford yells and songs.
Aupperle, Hayes, Maurer, Wheatly,
coach Wilson and coach Guerena are
the principal speakers of the evening, j
and promise the students some good
dope on the season's prospects. In
all of the major sports Stanford will
present strong lineups and with ex
cellent schedules, the year should
total many victories.
After the rally tomorrow night, the
captains of the various sports will
ask the students to sign up for the
season. It is expected that this year
will be the record breaker for the
number signing up.
