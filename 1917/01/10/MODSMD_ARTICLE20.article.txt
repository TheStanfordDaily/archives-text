Registration totals at 3 o'clock this i
afternoon showed that 1815 students j
arc enrolled in Stanford for the com-!
ing semester. Of this number 55 are
new men and 26 are new women.
Last year's total registration at this
time was 1834, showing a decrease of j
17 for this year. Last semester 2010
students were enrolled. The decrease
is caused by the number of Christ
mas graduates, graduates by request,
and of those who have dropped out
