Interfraternity Conciliation.
Scene—Peaceful plot of ground be
tween the Sigma Chi and Delta Gam
ma houses. Delta is in window on
the second floor of the Gamma house,
and Sig fills a similar window in the
Chi mansion. The fireworks follow:
Sig—Can 1 come over, Delta ?
Delta —I should say not —I'm Phi
Delt now.
S—What's matter, D?
D—l'm peeved.
S —Whaffor. Why didn't you say
so?
D—l did.
S —When?
D—This morning. Didn't you see
the sign on the lawn?
S—Naw. What's on it?
D—"Keep off the grass." And I wish
you to do it.
S —Aw, Delta, don't do that. Think
what it means to us. (Sig gets down
011 his knees in the window, folds his
hands, and pleads with Delta.) How
can we ever get any rushees if we
can't play ball in front? 'Sposen one
muffs the pill? Aw, have a heart,
Delta.
D —Nothing doing—that's final.
S —But, Delta, you're not sore, are
you?
D —Yes, but why,
S —Well, you see, I wanta make a
date for Junior week.
D—Oh, how exciting. Awfully nice
weather, isn't it?
S—Swell. Let's sec if there's any
water in the lake.
D—Oki, Sig—and if any rushee
throws the ball over on our lawn,
it'll be all right to get it, you know.
