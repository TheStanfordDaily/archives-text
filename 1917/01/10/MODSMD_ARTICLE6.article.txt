# Stanford Nine Will Play Numerous Games
## 
### 
Although the baseball schedule for
the present season is not complete
and can not be published for a few
days, Graduate Manager Hehrens an
nounced that Stanford varsity would
meet more teams this year and play
more games than former Cardinal
nines.
There will be the series with the
University of California, a series with
the University of Santa Clara, games
with St. Mary's, St. Ignatius, the
Olympic Club, Agnews, Swain and
Sheehan's Stars, "Wabbles" Stafford's
Stars, teams in the northern states
that belong to the Pacific Coast Con
ference, the University of Southern
California, Pomona, and with all the
important college nines on the east
ern seaboard.
With such teams on the schedule,!
the diamond resurfaced and put into
excellent playing condition, the as
surance of the best of coaching, and
a strong squad of varsity aspirants,
baseball captain "Doc" Hayes should
feel confident of giving the Cardinal
a winner.
For the past few years Stanford has
lost games because of a lack of hitting
ability. The team that will cavort
on the diamond this season will be
made up of sluggers. Shriver, Hayes,
Lilly, Mitchell, Lander and Bihlman
are all heavy hitters. If the pitching
department can hold up their end,
there is little question of Stanford
having the most successful baseball
season she has ever had this year.
