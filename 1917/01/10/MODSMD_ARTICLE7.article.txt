been assigned to each company,
squads of which will take turns prac
ticing witlj them. Two hundred
rounds of ammunition have arrived
for each man in the Stanford corps.
Bayonet fence sets have arrived for
each company, also, as have insignia
for all men enrolled. The insignia
cost thirty-five cents. Sabers have
arrived for the officers, but the neces
sary belts failed to accompany them,
so they will be of little use until the
belts come.
Whether or not the trusttes of the
University will he reimbursed for
money advanced for the purchase of
military uniforms is still an unde
cided question. A bill now before
Congress appropriates money for fu
ture uniforms needed by universities
and colleges, but whether or not it
contains specific appropriation to re
imburse the Stanford trustees is not
known. Congressman Kahn has
been queried, but no reply has been
received as yet in regard to the mat
ter.
Make Additional Appropriation.
There will be no trouble in getting
additional suits for the new men who
are enrolling this semester, as the
trustees have voted an additional ap
propriation, containing a provision
regarding expected reimbursement by
the government, which provides for
two hundred more uniforms, if needed.
»>v One-Hour Drill.
An additional drill period will be
carried on this semester, from 11 to
12, Monday, Wednesday and Friday

credit is allowed for this course,
which is aimed to meet the needs of
men engaged in athletic workouts in
the afternoons, and for all others
who cannot attend the two-hour drill
from 4 to 6, Monday, Wednesday and
Friday afternoons, in which two units
of credit are given.
Two new non-commissioned officers
have arrived to assist Major Bugge,
professor of Military Science and Tac
tics, in the instruction work. They
are Sergeant George H. Hates and

E. H. Jewell will remain at Stanford
also.
An outdoor rifle range, with eight
pits, and corresponding targets, is
being erected at a cost of $1000, ap
propriated by the trustees, west of
San Juan Hill. An indoor rifle range
has been constructed in the basement
of the anthropological laboratories, to
the rear of the museum. Two late
model rifles for target practice have
been assigned to each company,
squads of which will take turns prac
ticing witlj them. Two hundred
rounds of ammunition have arrived
for each man in the Stanford corps.
Bayonet fence sets have arrived for
each company, also, as have insignia
