# Track Practice to Start Next Monday
## Outlook Bright for Strong Team With Several of Last Years Stars Back. 
### 
Cinder path artists will don the 112
spikes for the first regular workout
next Monday night. Men will sign up j
at the spring sports rally at Encina
Thu(r!j|rtay night. Captain Aupperle .
will direct the workouts until the
coach is selected. Negotiations are I
now under way for one and the selec- j
tion will be announced in (he near fu- i
ture. Assisting Aupperle will be
"Ric" Templeton and Johnny Norton,
former Cardinal track stars.
Strong 1 in Sprints.
Stanford looks to be stronger this
year in the sprints than last. Mere
dith House, freshman star of last
year, is back in college, and will add
much strength to this department.
Otto Lachmund, star of previous years,
is also on hand and will be a strong
participant. Carl Floete, of the nine
teen class, is in good shape this year.
At a meet at the exposition last year
he defeated "Feg" Murray in both the
100 and 220. From last year's squad
Davis, Levy and Losh will be con
tenders.
"Jud" House is, of course, counted
Strongly upon for the low hurdles. In
the high hurdles, "Bob" Williams, who
ran Norton so closely when he made
his rccord of :15.1, and Sam Halsted
is also on hand for the hurdle events.
Rogers in Quarter.
The quarter-mile finds Dievendorff
as a strong contender. Rogers, Irish
Marathon star of last season, is ex
pected to figure to splendid advant
age, as he is credited with many fast
laps.
Schnell, winner of the 880 in last
year's meet with California, is 'in
splendid shape for work this year.
Teitsworth and Price of the freshmen
squad should render a good account
of themselves. Scott will be a strong
contender. Captain Aupperle, if he
enters this event, looks to be a point
winner.
Distance events find the Cardinal
fairly strong. Aupperle is in splen
did shape and will make any wearer
of the Blue and Cold step to break the
eligible, and bis loss will be felt,
last year, "Skin" Wilson, will not be
eliigible, and his loss will be felt.
Teitsworth is a good man for this
event also. Chapman looms up as a
likely winner of the two-mile, with
Frye as a good contender.
In Field Events.
As usual Stanford does not look to
be any too strong in the field events.
"Bill" Sisson, star broad jumper, is
absent this year. House and Lach
niund will be contenders in this event.
Wilcox and Morris, freshmen pole
vaulters of last year, should be able
to perform to better advantage this
year, and the Cardinal looks to be
stronger in this event.
"Reg" Caughey and "Here" Bihl
man both report themselves as feeling
in fine shape, and look to figure as
point winners in the weight events.
Workouts will probably develop
stars that are unknown at present
and for this reason captain Aupperle
is desirous of having the largest num
ber of men out for track that have
ever been out.

ber of men out for track that have
ever been out.
Cinder path artists will don the 112
spikes for the first regular workout
next Monday night. Men will sign up j
at the spring sports rally at Encina
Thu(r!j|rtay night. Captain Aupperle .
will direct the workouts until the
coach is selected. Negotiations are I
now under way for one and the selec- j
tion will be announced in (he near fu- i
ture. Assisting Aupperle will be
"Ric" Templeton and Johnny Norton,
former Cardinal track stars.
Strong 1 in Sprints.
Stanford looks to be stronger this
year in the sprints than last. Mere
dith House, freshman star of last
year, is back in college, and will add
much strength to this department.
Otto Lachmund, star of previous years,
is also on hand and will be a strong
participant. Carl Floete, of the nine
teen class, is in good shape this year.
At a meet at the exposition last year
he defeated "Feg" Murray in both the
100 and 220. From last year's squad
Davis, Levy and Losh will be con
tenders.
"Jud" House is, of course, counted
Strongly upon for the low hurdles. In
the high hurdles, "Bob" Williams, who
ran Norton so closely when he made
his rccord of :15.1, and Sam Halsted
is also on hand for the hurdle events.
Rogers in Quarter.
The quarter-mile finds Dievendorff
as a strong contender. Rogers, Irish
Marathon star of last season, is ex
pected to figure to splendid advant
age, as he is credited with many fast
laps.
Schnell, winner of the 880 in last
year's meet with California, is 'in
splendid shape for work this year.
Teitsworth and Price of the freshmen
squad should render a good account
of themselves. Scott will be a strong
contender. Captain Aupperle, if he
enters this event, looks to be a point
winner.
Distance events find the Cardinal
fairly strong. Aupperle is in splen
did shape and will make any wearer
of the Blue and Cold step to break the
eligible, and bis loss will be felt,
last year, "Skin" Wilson, will not be
eliigible, and his loss will be felt.
Teitsworth is a good man for this
event also. Chapman looms up as a
likely winner of the two-mile, with
Frye as a good contender.
In Field Events.
As usual Stanford does not look to
be any too strong in the field events.
"Bill" Sisson, star broad jumper, is
absent this year. House and Lach
niund will be contenders in this event.
Wilcox and Morris, freshmen pole
vaulters of last year, should be able
to perform to better advantage this
year, and the Cardinal looks to be
stronger in this event.
"Reg" Caughey and "Here" Bihl
man both report themselves as feeling
in fine shape, and look to figure as
point winners in the weight events.
Workouts will probably develop
stars that are unknown at present
and for this reason captain Aupperle
is desirous of having the largest num
ber of men out for track that have
ever been out.
