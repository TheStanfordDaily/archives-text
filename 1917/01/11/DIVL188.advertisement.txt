HHHERE Is No Better Pipe To
-®- bacco —than Velvet. We hon
estly believe that. Smoker after
smoker has told us so. Before you
agree or disagree, we ask you to
put Velvet to any test that will con
vince you personally.
Velvet is the best Kentucky Burley tobacco
—the variety American pipe smokers have
agreed to be the world's finest pipe tobacco
and the natural qualities of this tobacco ha ve
been brought to perfect maturity by two
years of ageing in wooden hogsheads.
We challenge you to compare Velvet to-day with any
pipe tobacco at any price ?
