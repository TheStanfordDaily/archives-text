tertaining, President Wilbur opened

year with a general survey of the
problems confronting the University,
and expressed satisfaction with the
scholarship standing of Stanford at the
present time, which he characterized
as being "remarkably sound."
In speaking of Stanford's progress,
President Wilbur indicated his belief
that the University was fast "getting
over its infantile ways," and that he
was hopeful of building a University
of the genuine university type, one
that would meet with the approval of
men out of college who have sons to
send.
Danger of Specialization.
In bringing Tip the subject of the as
sembly, that of vocational guidance
and the work of the employment bu
reau, President Wilbur emphasized
the danger of too much specialization
in preparing for a vocation. lie also
said that he considered the most im
portant thing that the student who was
front was the proper valuation and
preparing for a vocation had to con
conception of his own powers.
Professor J. G. Rrown of the com
mittee on Vocational Guidance, fol
lowed President Wilbur, and some
what briefly outlined the history of
the matter of vocational guidance.
The committee of five which was ap
pointed by the president to co-operate
with the heads of the departments,
made several investigations with the
purpose of studying the possible vo
cations open to students and of giv
ing students an opportunity to make
an intelligent choice of a vocation.
In carrying out this policy he an
nounced that a more or less compre
hensive list of vocations open to stu
dents in various departments of study
had been prepared. He said further
that a collection of books on voca
tions had been placed in the reference
room of the library. Still a third way
of providing students with the neces
sary knowledge of vocations to make
a choice will be provided in a series
of talks by men of affairs.
Specialists to Speak.
Among the speakers who have been
secured in this connection are Thomas
H. Reed, city manager of San Jose,
who will speak on the subject of
municipal management. W. A. Cattell
of Palo Alto, who is consulting en
gineer of San Francisco, will speak
on the subject of engineering, while
George C. Marshall will talk on the
opportunity in the army.
Mrs. Elizabeth B. Snell, who has
the official title of appointment secre
tary, explained the work of her of
fice, which is to assist graduates to
find employment in lines of work in
which they are fitted. She said that
there were at the present time more
calls for students from employers
than there were graduates to fill them.
She urged seniors to obtain a list of
credentials from their professors and
to file them, so that the employment
bureau may intelligently recommend
graduates for positions.
J. E. McDowell, alumni secretary,
was the concluding speaker of the day.

until they are ready to graduate. He

third among American universities in
point of number of graduates who are
affiliated with the alumni association.

strict application to study, saying that
the cost to the individuals and to the
University of maintaing those who
"merely rub the dust from college
walls" was too great.
