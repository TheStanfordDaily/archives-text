# Stanford Democracy "Claptrap" Is Claim
## Anonymous Graduate Contributes Sensational Article to Alumnus 
### 
That Stanford's traditional "Democ
racy" is "largely clap-trap," and "is
to often the snobbishness of unaspir
ing mediorcity," is the assertion made
in the holiday number of the Alum
nus, which appeared during the Christ
mas vacation, by a Stanford graduate,
who keeps his identity secret.
Writing under the title, "Stanford and
State Education," he recommends the
"weeding out of puerile traditions at
Stanford." "Stanford has been al

That education which doesn't pay
has little value, is the third notion.
"The object of instruction is not di
rectly economic, but directly intel

education can be got easily by mere
residence at college is the fourth no

ing to the unknown graduate. Notion
No. 5, that everybody should have an
education since everybody can get it,
receives its following because of the
prevalent fallacy that numbers of
people being educated is more impor
tant than the education they are get
ting.
State universities, professional foot
ball coaches, and the "so-called"
elective system are also attacked.
"Intercollegiate athletics can be
abandoned any moment without hurt
ing anyone or anything," he says
Other articles which feature this is
sue of the Alumnus include eulogy of
the late Samuel Watson Charles, '98,
and articles on the continuous ses
sion plan, changes in Encina, Belgian
Relief Work, the Pellissier fund, and
athletics.
