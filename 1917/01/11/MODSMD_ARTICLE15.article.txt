# "LIVES THERE A MANâ€”"

### 
Just a year ago, military training
at Stanford was but a fond dream in
the minds of a handful of enthusi
asts. That the dream would ever
come true was doubtful, for not only
did the lethargy of indifference on the
part of many have to be overcome, but
a failure in the past history of the
University led others to doubt the
possibility of success. Today, the
campus bristles with arms, and men in
uniform are ceasing to be stared at
as a curiosity. Thanks to the per
severance of this handfull of students
and the co-operation of the board of
trustees and President Wilbur, mili
tary training is a success. There can
be no doubt of this when we glance
at the greatly increased enrollment
list for the semester.
Whether or not the enthusiasm
shown for military training last fall
was a mere flash in the pan, remaineu
for this semester's registration to
prove. Drill is here to stay. It was
a success last semester in spite of
heavy odds against it in the way of
poor equipment; with the added facil
ities now obtained, its future is as
sured.
Stanford should be glad to have al
lied herself with a nation-wide move
ment of such importance. Although
those of pacifist tendencies may look
askance at the martial display, it
seems to us that military training
here is robbed of any objectionable
quality by its voluntary nature. The
very fact that it is not compulsory
shows that many students are alive
to our great problems of national de
fense, and feel it their duty to do
something toward its solution. We
hope that the squads will continue to
grow.
