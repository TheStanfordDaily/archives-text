# Chick Farm Fails
## To Make Dad Rich 
### 
Keeping the peace on a chicken
farm in Santa Cruz has been proved
more nerve-racking, more arduous,
more painful and less remunerative
than keeping the same peace on the
Stanford campus.
Without laboratory testing ma
terials of any sort, "Dad" Mercer,
quondam peace officer on the quad
rangle, has proved this conclusively.
That is why "Dad" is back at his old
job today, after an abscnce of a se
mester. Early last fall "Dad" resigned
his position as patrolman. He showed
reticence when questioned as to the
reasons for his actions, but finally
admitted that he had fallen from the
state of single blessedness to a state
of double unhappiness. He was to
marry an extensive chicken farm In
Santa Cruz and assume the fond par
entage of innumerable feathered
creatures from whom he hoped to
"make his fortune and make it quick.
So "Dad" left.
Yesterday he again appeared on the
campus and assumed his duties. His
chicken farm had failed to realize the
huge profits that would raise "Dad"
*into the ranks of the "nouvcau riche."
Of course the war is blamed for
every little out-of-the-ordinary event
these days, and "Dad" lays his mis
fortunes at the feet of Moloch. The
price of wheat was too high, or some
thing like that. Further than that he
refuses to testify. But he vows that
the experience gained during his ten
ure of office in Santa Cruz has im
proved his disciplinary ability a
thousand per cent, and declares that
the peace on this campus will be kept
and treasured as no peace ever before
has been. "Dad" is strongly against
war.
