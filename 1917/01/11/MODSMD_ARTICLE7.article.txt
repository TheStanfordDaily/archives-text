Tryouts for voices to fill vacancics
in the Stanford Glee Club -announced
for tonight, have been postponed, on
account of the rally, until Tuesday,

be held at the regular rehearsal room,
No. 81, on the inner quad. Candidates
may also take trials at the special
rehearsal to be held Friday, January
12th, at 7:30 p.m.
Vacancies have occurred in every
j>art, but second tenors and second
basses are needed especially. New
candidates should not consider them
selves handicapped because of lack of
experience or failure at the trials last
Call or because the club has been
singing as a body for several months,
for there is now music to be learned
by all.
Men making the club now will sing
at several concerts to be given at Oak
land and elsewhere during the pres
ent semester, and will be eligible for
the trip which the management is en
deavoring to arrange as the climax of
the Glee Club season.
