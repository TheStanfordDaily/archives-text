# Eighty New Men Are Enrolled for Military Training
## 
### 
Eighty new men enrolled for mili
tary training yesterday afternoon at
the first drill of the semester. The
greater part of the men in the corps
last year were again on hand and in
uniforms. That many more men will
be out at the next regular drill, Fri
day afternoon, is the opinion of Major
Bugge and his assistants, who are:
greatly pleased by the prospects for
the coming term.
Divide New Class.
While old members were going
through company drill, the new class
was divided into four divisions of
twenty men each. One of these di
visions was assigned to each of the
present four companies, and student
officers of the companies proceeded to
teach the fundamentals of drill with
out arms.
Athletes Enroll.
A number of men expecting to de
vote their afternoons to training for
track, baseball, crew, or for other
branches of sport, have already sig
nified their intention of joining the
new morning drill class from 11 to
12, Monday, Wednesday and Friday
mornings, in which one unit of Uni
versity credit is allowed. Some stu
dents drill from 4 to 5, instead of from
4 to 6, three afternoons a week, Mon
day, Wednesday and Friday, and re
ceive one unit instead of two units of
credit.
Lecture Friday.
Major Bugge will address the corps
on "The Military Policy of the United
States," in the Little Theater, Friday
afternoon, in place of the regular
drill. Previous to this, companies
will assemble at the gymnasium for
roll call, and time will be allowed for
additional enrollments.
A number of other interesting and
valuable talks are scheduled for Jan
uary and February. Almost all of
these will be given in the Little The
ater, also. They include the follow
ing:
January 17 —"Personal Hygiene," by
Dr. H. R. Stolz, head of the Physical
Training department.
January 19—"First Aid," by Dr.
Stolz; January 24—"Target Practice";
January 24—"Camp Sanitation"; Feb
ruary 9 —"Field Engineering."
