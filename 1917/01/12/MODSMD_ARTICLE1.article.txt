# MRS. KELLOGG RETURNS FROM BELGIAN WORK
## TRIBUTE TO HOOVER Belgium Situation Said to Be More Difficult Each Month of War 
### 
"The Situation in Belgium grows
more difficult with each month of the
war," declared Mrs. Vernon Lyman
Kellogg, wife of the head of Stan
ford's Entomology department, oil her
arrival on the campus, late yesterday
afternoon, after six months spent in
the relief work in Belgium.
Tribute to Hoover.
"There is a greater scarcity of food

of Mr. Hoover has gone on undaunted.
Stanford should be prouder every day

Professor Kellogg Stays.
