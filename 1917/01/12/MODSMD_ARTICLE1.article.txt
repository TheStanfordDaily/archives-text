# MRS. KELLOGG RETURNS FROM BELGIAN WORK
## TRIBUTE TO HOOVER Belgium Situation Said to Be More Difficult Each Month of War 
### 
"The Situation in Belgium grows
more difficult with each month of the
war," declared Mrs. Vernon Lyman
Kellogg, wife of the head of Stan
ford's Entomology department, oil her
arrival on the campus, late yesterday
afternoon, after six months spent in
the relief work in Belgium.
Tribute to Hoover.
"There is a greater scarcity of food
supplies all over the world," said Mrs.
Kellogg. "It is more difficult to get
wheat and fat, and they cost more
when you get them. Shipping space
is harder to get. And yet the genius
of Mr. Hoover has gone on undaunted.
Stanford should be prouder every day
of him."
Professor Kellogg Stays.
Mrs. Kellogg thought that Professor
Kellogg would be able to come back to
Stanford with her, but Herbert C.
Hoover, '95, director of the relief com
mission, needed Dr. Kellogg's help in
Lojidon, so Mrs. Kelloog came on
alone. She does not know when her
husband will he able to return, nor
does she know what her own future
plans will be.
Uefore going to the central office of
the relief commission in London, last
December, Professor Kellogg was di
rector of distribution for all of Bel
gium. Under him were forty-two
American workers, a dozen of whom
were from the state of California.
These workers were allowed the use
of eighteen automobiles by the Ger
man officials.
Mrs. Kellogg served in the "C. R.
8.," the "Commission for the Relief
in Belgium," as a worker among the
women workers.
"It was my privilege," said Mrs.
Kellogg, "to go from one part of Bel
gium to another, visiting the relief
centers wherever the women were
working, talking with the women, and
encouraging them.
"It is the women of Belgium who
stand next to the people. It is the
women who ladle out the soup, ap
portion out the provisions, feed the
; babies. It is the women who keep J
up the courage and cheerfulness of
the entire people. Their moral effect
j is tremendous.
"The Americans bring in the food
and turn it over to the 55,000 Belgian
and French men workers. These men
work in bureaus, offices and mills. !
They place part of this food in shape
where it can be bought by those who
still have money. The rest goes to,
the relief centers where it is given j
to the destitute.
"It is in these centers that the great:
army of Belgian women are working
from morning to night every day, !
seven days in the week. They never
stop. They have been working in this
way for two years.
"You don't get the feeling of the
awful need of the people nor of the j
size of the tasks until it is ground [
into you by actual contact with the
work. It is the biggest humanitarian
undertaking in history. It is unique.
"Expenses of the commission have j
gone up two and a half million dollars !
a month during the last few months, j
the work ol ! the commission now cost
ing about ten millions a month. Dur- |
ing the past two years, two hundred
millions of dollars have been spent
for two million tons of foodstuffs. Of
these two hundred million dollars the
United States has contributed eight
millions. This means that the United j
States has fed Belgium one month."
