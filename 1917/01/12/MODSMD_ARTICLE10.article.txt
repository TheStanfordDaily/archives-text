ternoon at 4:30.
Following is the new faculty rule as
adopted by the academic council on
the recommendation of its executive
committee:
"All undergraduates shall be re
quired to devote three schedule
hours per week for the first four
semesters, or six quarters, as the case
may be, either to physical or military
training. Students must register in
regular classes for the above work,
and satisfactory attention to it will
be required. Students entering with
advanced standing may offer equiva
lent training in other colleges or uni
versities in whole or partial fulfillment
of this requirement."

This means that no credit will be
given in military after this semester.

In taking this action, Stanford's
faculty follows the lead of a large
number of eastern universities.

ferring from other colleges and uni-
versities of recognized standing, will

women transfers will have to wait

tee on graduate study and of the ex
ecutive committee, the academic coun
cil revised the requirements for ad
vanced degrees by approving a series

ternoon at 4:30.
Following is the new faculty rule as
adopted by the academic council on
the recommendation of its executive
committee:
"All undergraduates shall be re
quired to devote three schedule
hours per week for the first four
semesters, or six quarters, as the case
may be, either to physical or military
training. Students must register in
regular classes for the above work,
and satisfactory attention to it will
be required. Students entering with
advanced standing may offer equiva
lent training in other colleges or uni
versities in whole or partial fulfillment
of this requirement."
Xo Credit for Drill.
This means that no credit will be
given in military after this semester.
Students will have their choice be
tween military and physical training,
and do not necessarily have to stick to
either the one or the other during the
two year period, but can alternate
between the two.
In taking this action, Stanford's
faculty follows the lead of a large
number of eastern universities.
Restrict Graduate Women.
Graduate women students, trans
ferring from other colleges and uni-
versities of recognized standing, will
be 011 the same basis as other women
entering Stanford for the first time,
hereafter. Up to this time graduate
women transfers have been placed
on the proferred list automatically.
According to ilie ruling passed by the
academic council today, only such
, women whose credentials evidence
ability and promise, and who expect
to become candidates for advanced de
grees or for the high school teachers'
certificate, or who purpose to pursue
regular advanced, professional, or re
search courses, are to be placed on
the preferred list. Other graduate
women transfers will have to wait
their turn on the general admission
list for new women students.
On recommendation of the commit
tee on graduate study and of the ex
ecutive committee, the academic coun
cil revised the requirements for ad
vanced degrees by approving a series
of checks to be on work of graduate
students in preparation for degrees.
This is part of the general tightening
up of University requirements in
scholarship.
