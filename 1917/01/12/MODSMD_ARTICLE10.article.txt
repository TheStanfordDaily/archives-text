# COMPULSORY DRILL OR GYM FOR STUDENTS
## TO START NEXT YEAR Academic Council Takes Action this Afternoonâ€”No Credit to Be Given 
### 
Compulsory physical or military
training without credit will be re
quired of all undergraduates during
their first two years in the Univer
sity, according to action taken by the
academic council of the faculty this af
ternoon at 4:30.
Following is the new faculty rule as
adopted by the academic council on
the recommendation of its executive
committee:
"All undergraduates shall be re
quired to devote three schedule
hours per week for the first four
semesters, or six quarters, as the case
may be, either to physical or military
training. Students must register in
regular classes for the above work,
and satisfactory attention to it will
be required. Students entering with
advanced standing may offer equiva
lent training in other colleges or uni
versities in whole or partial fulfillment
of this requirement."
Xo Credit for Drill.
This means that no credit will be
given in military after this semester.
Students will have their choice be
tween military and physical training,
and do not necessarily have to stick to
either the one or the other during the
two year period, but can alternate
between the two.
In taking this action, Stanford's
faculty follows the lead of a large
number of eastern universities.
