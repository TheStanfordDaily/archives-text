Stanford is off her marks for what
promises to be one of the most suc
cessful of spring athletic seasons.
Enough men signed up at last night's
rally to make competition for places
on the various teams extremely keen,
none of the four major sports being
slighted. With a full preliminary
schedule, ending in a struggle for
supremacy over the Blue and Gold
teams, Cardinal athletes will be kept
moving for the next few months.
They will work hard, putting their en
tire energy into the struggle for vic
tory, as all past Stanford teams have
done.
Every Stanford student should real
ize that he has a part to play—that
his indifference or his enthusiasm may
mean just the shade between defeat
and victory. This truism has been
harped on at intervals throughout the
ages, and would be threadbare long
ere this, were it not for the fact that
it has long periods of neglect in which
to recuperate. We are very apt to
forget how much loyal support from
the student body means. Encourage
ment—both material and spiritual—is
essential.
There are no differences, no mis
understandings. We are all of one
mind; we know what we want to do,
and we know how to do it if we will.
Let's go!
