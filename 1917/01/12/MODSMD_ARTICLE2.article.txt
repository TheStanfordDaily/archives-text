# Schedule Arranged for Indoor Soccer
## Allies and Barbarians to Meet in Opening Contest of Outdoor Series 
### 
Twelve teams of the San Francisco
Indoor Soccer league will journey to
Stanford during the coming season to
play the Stanford Indoor Soccer team,
according to H. W. Maloney, soccer
coach. Each team will make the trip
at least once, coming entirely at their
own expense.
Two Gnnios Per Nljrlit.
Two teams of five men each will
oppose the visitors from the city,
since the teams have arranged to
come down two at a time, necessitating
the playing of two games in an eve
ning. In order to accomplish this,
the halves of the two games will al
ternate. Mr. Maloney has issued an
appeal for more men to turn out for
practice, which is held on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays at 11:15.
The outdoor soccer men are prac
ticing on Tuesday and Thursday after
noons. Over two-thirds of this year's
varsity soccerites will not be back
next year, and as a result an unus
ually large number of men, particu
larly freshmen, arc needed to prepare
for the fall season.
"Barbs" First Opponents.

tain a part of the proceeds of all the
matches.

Saturday Afternoon Soccer league,
better known as the University and
Club league, to determine the lineup
of the Allies. The spring soccer sea
