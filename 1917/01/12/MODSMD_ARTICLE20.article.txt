# Military Camps Are Favored in Report
## 
### 
Presidents of a number of American
universities, including Yale, Harvard,
Princeton, Cornell and others, who
comprise the advisory committee of
University Presidents, strongly com
mend the Summer Military Instruction
camps for students which were held
last summer at Monterey, California,
and Plattsburg, New York,
j In their report the committee ex
presses the hope that in 1917 more
camps of a like nature will be estab
: lished by the government at points
| conveniently reached from different
sections of the country. In their opin
ion there "is no way in which a col
lege or university student can more
: wisely, healthfully, and profitably
pass his entire summer vacation than
| in one of these camps."
The large attendance of the mili
i tary camps last summer made possible
maneuvers on a much broader scale
than ever before. The students, ac
cording to the report of the univer
sity presidents, were trained in the
most efficient style and were given
careful oversight in respect to tent
: accommodation, food and medical care.
