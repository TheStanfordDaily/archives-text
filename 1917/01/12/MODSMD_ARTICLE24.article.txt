# Triangle League is Formed for Fencing
## 
### 
With the organization of a regular
fencing class under H. W. Maloney,
on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4
to 6, that minor sport has received a
decided boost for the coming semester.
Interclass fencing competition will
be started within a few weeks and
plans for freshmen as well as var
sity competition with California have
been made.
A new idea in the fencing line has
been conceived by Maloney. He has
arranged for a so-called triangle com
petition to take place in February,
California, the Olympic Club and
Stanford are the teams that form the
triangle.
Mr. Maloney urges that more men
come out for fencing, as it benefits
them both physically and mentally.
