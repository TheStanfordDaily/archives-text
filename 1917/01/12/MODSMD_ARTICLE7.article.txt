## Many Men Sign for Coming Spring Sports

night in one of the best rallies that
the students have staged in many
years. From the initial sons, "Come
Join the Band," to the time-honored

After the rally, the men signed up
for the activities that they wanted
to engage in, 123 signing up for track,
86 for baseball, 60 for crew, and 46
for basketball. This is not as large

not as many at the rally, and many
more will probably be out that did
not care to sign up last night.
