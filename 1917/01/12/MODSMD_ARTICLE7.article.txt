# ATHLETIC RALLY BIG SUCCESS
## Many Men Sign for Coming Spring Sports 
### 
Stanford spirit brooke loose last
night in one of the best rallies that
the students have staged in many
years. From the initial sons, "Come
Join the Band," to the time-honored
conclusion, "Hail, Stanford, Hail," the
spring sports noise-maker was a huge
success. Encina was crowded, and
while the number of men that signed
up lor major sports was not a record
breaker, they were all enthusiasts for
a clean sweep of victories for the
Cardinal this season.
After the rally, the men signed up
for the activities that they wanted
to engage in, 123 signing up for track,
86 for baseball, 60 for crew, and 46
for basketball. This is not as large
a number as last year, but there were
not as many at the rally, and many
more will probably be out that did
not care to sign up last night.
Wlieat-ly First Speaker.
Yell leader Gilroy gave tht opening
signal, and was greeted by prolonged
cheering. He introduced the speakers,
and led a number of yells during the
course of the rally. Captain Wheatly
ol' the basketball team was the first
to talk to the students. He told of
the new equipment that was at the
disposal of the basketball players,
and of the splendid opportunities that
the game now offered on account of
being granted major sport standing.
"Doc" Hayes Follows,
"Doc" Hayes, leader of the varsity
baseball team, was the next speaker.
He announced that official baseball
practice for varsity and freshmen
players would begin today. He also
told of the peanut league that was go
ing to be organized. It will be a four
team league, playing a schedule of
eleven weeks, three games a week.
The league will serve as a farm for
the varsity and freshmen players and
men will lie promoted when their
work shows that they are deserving of
a trial with the first team. The pea
nut league will start on Monday, the

schedule and list of players being!
posted on the training quarters and
announced in the Monday issue of The
Daily Palo Alto.
Ovation for Coach Wilson.
Russell T. Wilson, the new baseball
and basketball coach, received an ova
tion when he arose to speak. He ex-

pressed his joy at being one of the
Stanford men now, and praised the
Cardinal for the spirit demonstrated
kt Stanford.
Track captain Aupperle announced
that the track men would be expected
to report for work on "Monday. The
coach for the season will he an
nounced at that time, but for the first
few days, "Ilic" Templeton, Johnny
Norton and "Skin" Wilson will help
Aupperle in handling the men out for
cinder path work.
Crew Coach Speaks.
"Husky" Guerena, veteran coach of
the Stanford oarsmen, was enthusiast
ically received. His first words were,
"I'm glad to he back." He success
fully got his main point over, the fact
that in crew every man had practic
ally an even chance, as few have ever
had any experience before and the
sport is new to nearly all of the many
aspirants for positions. To put the

freshmen back in the winning column
; with the University of California, and
for the varsity to win the Pacific
j Coast championship, are "Husky's"
I two ambitions, and it is expected that
| the Stanford crews will be able to do
I this.
! Captain Maurer Concludes.
Crew captain Rix Maurer was the
last speaker of the evening. He told
the freshmen not to feel backward
about coming out if they had not been
out for fall practice, as this would
make no difference in the choice of
crew men now.
