## TRACK TEAM MAY COMPETE AGAIN IN EAST PRINCETON IS INVITER Tigers Offer Cinder Path and Training Quarters to Stanford Squad 
### 
Stanford track stars may again in
vade the east to compete with the best
cinder path men of the large univer
sities. According to Graduate Man
ager Behrens, the eastern colleges are
anxious to have the Cardinal repre
sented at the annual Eastern Inter
collegiate meet to be held this year
at the Stadium of the University of
Pennsylvania. The matter has not
been taken up with the local faculty
and as yet it is not known whether
the trip would be a financial success.
This morning, Graduate Manager
Behrens received a letter from Alvin
Behrer, manager of athletics at
Princeton University, asking that if
by any chance the Stanford men
should come east this season, that
they make Princeton their headquar
ters. The facilities at Princeton are
excellent for track training, and the
offer of the college, considered by
many to be the nearest like Stanford
of any other university, is a generous
one.
Behrer asks that a date be arranged
for a dual meet between Stanford and
Princeton, to be run off some time dur
ing the latter part of May, when the
Cardinal runners would be training
for the intercollegiate meet. Behrens
has answered the Princeton offer, and
if the local tracksters go east, they
will undoubtedly accept.
If enough dual meets can be ar
ranged, it would pay to send a fairly
full squad east, but if this is found to
be impossible or inexpedient, about
five of the locals' best point-winners
could be sent to compete in the inter
collegiate. "Jud" House is probably
the best low hurdler now eligible to
compete in college athletics. If the
Cardinal can produce some other men
of cortain point-winning ability, a
small team could make a wonderful
showing in the cinder path classic to
be staged at Pennsylvania next May.
A decision will be made when the
definite offer is received.
