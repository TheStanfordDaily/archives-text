# Credit in Military for Upper classmen
## Physical Training Department to Place Emphasis on Outdoor Sports 
### 
Although no credit will be given for
military drill or physical training in
a student's freshman and sophomore
years, according to action taken Fri
day afternoon by the academic coun
cil, it is assumed that in the Military
Science department credit will be
given on the present basis of one unit
per three hours of work for students
who continue the drill work in their
third and fourth years.
This is the gist of a statement today
by Major Jens Bugge, professor of
Military Science and Tactics, in re
gard to the effect of the new ruling
on the military training work. The
new rule does not go into effect until
next year.
A large number of the upperclass
men taking drill will act as officers,
and all upperclassmen will devote
more time to the study of military
tactics and less to the rudimentary
drilling, as they advance in the course.
Physical Training Plans.
More men than ever before are ex
pected to enroll in physical training
as a result of the new rule. Emphasis
will be placed on outdoor sports, and
the aim will be for every man to be
out for some branch of athletics. The
plan is to group the work into about
ten divisions, each centering about
some sport, such as rugby, crew, track,
soccer, basketball, swimming, cross
country, or tennis.
In this way the individual student
can pick the sport he wishes to spec
ialize in, and follow it exclusively,
if he wishes, during its season. Then
at the end of the season he can di
vide the required three hours a week
between minor sports or exercises.
Each individual student will have the
greatest freedom possible ic planning
his course.
Rule Includes Women.
Women as well as men are included
under the new rule, during their first
two years at Stanford, but in the ab
sence of anything to correspond to
military training, they are confined to
some branch of physical training.
