# RECORD MEMBERSHIP UNION CAMPAIGN AIM
## TO MAKE CLUB A SOCIAL CENTER Faculty and Students Join in Movement for Expansion 
### 
An all-University campaign for a
"bigger and better Stanford Union"
was launched this afternoon when
captains of membership teams met to
name their lieutenants and to discuss
plans for the coming week. The cam
| paign will be limited to a week, final
! results being compiled next Monday
afternoon at 1 o'clock.
"Every Man in the University a
Union Member" is the ideal of the
committee, and they hope to more
nearly approach it than ever before.
At present there are 218 members, but
this is only considered a start by the
Union boosters.
It is the aim of the management this
semester to make the Union not mere
ly a clubhouse, but a "Union" in the
true sense of the word.
SERIES OP SMOKERS
STARTS JANUARY 52
I In order that the Union may play
the important part it should as a
social center and meeting place of all
Stanford —students, alumni, and fac
ulty, a series of University smokers
will be held each semester in the
| Union. The first of these smokers
will be held a week from Thursday
evening, January 25, starting at 7:15.
At least three of these University
smokers will be held each semester,
and all men of the University, whether
undergraduates, graduates or faculty
members, are invited. These events
will be absolutely informal, and will
lie featured by talks, stunts, and free
smokes.
A series of dances have been plan
ned for the Union this semester, for
Union members only. • The first of
these, an informal, is set for Friday
evening, January 26. On the evening
of Friday, February 23, another in
formal will be given at the Union. A
formal dance has been dated for Fri
day evening, March 23.
It is the interest of the men of the
University and faculty moro than their
financial support that is needed. A
$45,000 building has been given to the
men of the University as a place for
them to meet and come to know each
other in an informal social way. It
was the hope of the alumni who large
ly paid fov it, that the Union would
become the very heart of Stanford
life and of Stanford spirit.
FACULTY MEN JOIN
IN CAMPAIGN
This is the only place where under
graduates, alumni, and faculty can
mingle on a basis of equality, just as
Stanford men, hence the campaign in
cludes professors as well as students.
Dues paid from semester to semes
ter can be applied on the purchase of
a life membership in the Union, by the
student, either now, or after gradua
tion. In this way a freshman enter
ing Stanford now could have $16 to his
credit when he wishes to take out a
life membership, the regular cost of
which is $50. A standing committee
011 life memberships has been ap
pointed by the Union board of gov
ernors.
Captains, with their lieutenants, are
named below. Additional leaders, to
gether with the various campus living
units apportioned each group, will be
announced later. The campaign will
not be competitive, and results will be
published each clay in The Daily Palo
Alto, as it progresses. Every man
named below has membership cards,
hence any student can pay his dues to
any captain or lieutenant, on the Quad.
