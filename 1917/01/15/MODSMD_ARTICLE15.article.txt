Necessity, in the future, will be the
mother of a redder-blooded Stanford.
The academic council, in passing a
rule compelling all undergraduates to
take either gymnasium work or mili
tary drill, has at last furnished an
adequate incentive to exercise regu
larly. This is something which every
one knows should be done, but which
a large majority of students neglect
because it requires some effort. Al
though we may start with the best of
intentions, if there is nothing to com
pel us, we soon drift into shiftless
ways.
This is so in many things, but par
ticularly where physical effort is in
volved. No better example could be
found than here in Encina gymnasium.
As long as credit was given for gym
work, the classes were of respectable
size. As soon as the incentive of one
hour a semester was removed, how
ever, we find that little interest is
taken. Instructors complain that it
has been almost impossible to get re
sults during the past semester. Some
thing had to be done, and the academic
council has hit upon the most effective
way of getting a student to care for
himself physically. Incentive in the
shape of credit fails to elicit response
in many cases, but necessity will bring
every one out.
Two years of exercise should en
gender such a liking for it that gym
nasium work, or something in the
way of athletics will become a habit,
following the student at least through
out his entire college career. What
may seem to some like a hardship to
begin with, will no doubt be looked
on as a blessing in years to come.
It seems to us, however, that some
small credit should be given for this
work. It may be said that reward for
doing what is beneficial to the student
is unnecessary, but if this principle
were applied, we would get little or
no credit in any department. There
is nothing incompatible between com
pelling a man to do a thing and giv
ing him credit at the same time. It
would create a feeling of greater
satisfaction, and would lead to a
greater interest in the work.
