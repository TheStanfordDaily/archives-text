# English Club Orders More Books of Verse
## 
### 
Due to the Christmas rush the first
edition of the "Stanford Book of
Verse," which was published by the
English Club and contains poems
from the pen 6f Stanford students,
has been exhausted within a month
after publication. Five hundred copies
of the book, which is attractively
bound, have been sold here and in San
Francisco, the sales at the Stanford
Bookstore being particularly heavy.
One hundred more copies will be is
sued at an early date by the commit
tee of the English Club.
Bulletin Boosts Verse Book.
The heavy sale is partly due to the
favorable reviews given the volume
by the San Francisco papers. Robert
L. Duffis, editor of "The Bulletin,"
says in the course of a full page re
view, that the volume proves that "the
spirit of poetry not only nourishes in
California, but can survive a college
curriculum. . . . The greater part
of the verse is conspicuous for its
orginality. Dare Stark's 'In March'
is reminiscent of nothing but the thrill
of early California spring. If there
is a school of California poetry this
youthful writer deserves a place in
it.""The Bulletin" singled out sev
eral other poems for special mention
and reprinted verses by Alice Rogers,
Jimmie Duff and Maxwell Anderson.
Chronicle Is Complimentary. *
Comparing the Stanford volume
with the one issued at Princeton un
der the editorship of Alfred Noyes,
the Chronicle reviewer writes: "In
two qualities it excel Is the Princeton
book â€”in originality arid in natural
ness. . . . The little western book
shows that Stanford is nearer the foot
hills than anything else." The re
viewer quotes from the work of Syd
nie Gardner and Maxwell Anderson,
and pronounces Dare Stark's "In
March" the "most perfect of all in
grace and exquisite poetic concep
tion."
