# Dr. Jordan to Leave on Long Peace Tour
## 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan, chancellor
emeritus of Stanford University, will
probably leave for Europe in March,
to engage in peace work on the war
torn continent. According to his pres
ent plans, he will remain in Europe
until fall, returning at that time to
Stanford. Dr. Jordan says that con
ditions are so unsettled that his plans
are subject to change at any moment.
I>r. Jordan To Lead.
Dr. Jordan will take a leading part
in the activities of the Central Organ
ization for a Durable Peace (Organ
isation centrale pour une paix dur
able). Previously it had been planned
to hold a peace congress in Switzer
land, but the belligerents have caused
this to be forbidden. As a result there
will* be no congress or convention of
any sort, but the Central Organization
will make its headquarters for actual
peace work at The Hague.
This peace work will have two
principal forms of expression at pres
ent, consisting in, first, the publication
of monographic treatises on various
phases of the conditions necessary for
peace, written by the leading pacif
ists of all the principal states of
Europe, with Dr. Chancellor Emeritus
Jordan as the representative of the
United States; and second, by the
publication of the sane things written
in each of the warring countries by
the scholars who desire peace and a
real understanding between the bellig
erents.
As editor-in-chief for the Central
Organization, Dr. Jordan will have a
tremendous influence on the peace
moves executed by these means. He
has already written the introductory
monograph, entitled "Annexation and
Conquest," in which he comments on
the first article ofctlie program of the
Central Organization, which is as fol
lows:
"No annexation or transfer of ter
ritory shall be made contrary to the
interests and wishes of the population
concerned. When possible, their
counsel shall be obtained by plebiscite
or otherwise."
