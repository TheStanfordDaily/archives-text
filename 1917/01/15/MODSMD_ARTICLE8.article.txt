# Oregon Aggies Will Meet Stanford in Rugby
## Northern Agricultural School to Offer Stiff Pigskin Contest 
### 
Proving that rugby is far from dead,
even outside of California, Oregon
Agricultural College is taking the
game up and will meet Stanford next
season. The game is expected to be
one of the banner contests of the year.
Oregon will engage in spring prac
tice so that their fifteen next football
season will be able to cope with the
more experienced squads that are now
playing the English style of pigskin
sport.
A letter received yesterdav by Grad
uate Manager Behrens from A. D.
Browne, head of athletics at the Cor
vallis college, told of the rapid strides
that rugby was making in the north.
W. D. Peaslee, '09, former varsity
track man and football player at Stan
ford, is a member of the faculty at
Oregon, and will have charge of the
spring training. It is expected that a
first class coach will be secured by
the time that the football season
conies around.
Oregon should have a strong fif
teen, as there are many excellent
ruggers from British Columbia reg
istered in the farm institution. Be
sides these men, several experienced
rugby players from southern Cali
fornia are now at Oregon. The date
of the Stanford-Oregon Aggie contest
has not been settled as yet, but Grad
uate Manager Behrens expects to be
able to announce when the game is
slated in a day or two.
