What kind of a cigarette
would YOU call sensible?
Check up and see how nearly this comes
to fitting in with your own ideas:—
A SENSIBLE cigarette must
taste good. It must be cool
and smooth to your throat and
tongue. It must be properly
mild — mild enough so that
you'll feel all right even though
you may smoke more than usual.
In short, it must be comfort
able. If it isn't, it can't be
sensible.
Fatimas are comfortable be
cause of the balance of their
Turkish blend. The milder to
baccos in this blend are in such
perfect balance with the richer,
fuller-flavored leaves as to en
tirely off-set that uncomfortable,
rr oily heaviness" found in so
many other cigarettes.
You'll notice the difference as
soon as you try Fatimas.
