The Carnot debate will be held the
night before the intercollegiate track

California has picked a team of vet
erans to represent the Blue and Gold

Proieboor d a. Huston, dean of the
Law school; Professor k. M. Cathcart,

Chances for a winning year in the
Carnot debate are very bright. The
men who are trying out are Driscoll,
McClintock, Miller, Williams and Hoi-
land. Driscoll and McClintock are
veterans and have shown that they are
capable of debating or the Carnot
type. The other men are all danger
ous men in a debate and undoubtedly
the men who are chosen for the filial
contest will put up a hard fight.
The Carnot was the first extemper
aneous intercollegiate debate in the
United States and remains today one
of the biggest individual contests in
any university of this country.
