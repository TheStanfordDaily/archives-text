# Stanford Songsters to Fill Vacancies Tonight
## 
### 
Stanford warblers are to try their
voices tonight, when the Glee Club
will hold tryouts for new men in the
regular rehearsal room, 81, on the
inner quad, at 7:30. The tryouts are
to be held to fill vacancies which have
occurred in all the parts, but second
tenors and second basses are in par
ticular demand.
Several concerts at Oakland and
elsewhere are planned for the pres
ent semester, and men making the
Glee Club tonight will have the op
portunity to make these trips, as well
as the big trip which the management
is endeavoring to arrange as the cli
max of the season.
New music is to be learned this
semester, so that candidates should
not consider themselves handicapped
by lack of previous experience. Men
who failed to make the Glee Club last
fall, according to the director, should
enter the present tryouts.
