# BASEBALL MAKES DEBUT SATURDAY
## 
### 
Baseball practice is being conducted
every afternoon, and the squad looms
up in much better shape than they did
a year ago at this time. Captain
"Doc" Hayes is directing the workouts
oi' the varsity squad this week while
coach Russell H. Wilson is handling
the freshmen.
The first practice game of the year
will be held Saturday, when the var
sity meets a team of players brought
down from San Francisco by "Wab
bles" Stafford. His team is made up
of former college ball players, some
of w liom are members of the fast
Olympic Club nine. Captain Hayes
expects the varsity to make a good
showing in their first appearance of
the 1917 season.
On the varsity, Gus Hoever, Bert
Mattel and Draper are working out as
hurlers. Captain Hayes is also trying
out his wing again this year, and ap
pears to be in good shape. Campbell,
Wilcox and Hayes are officiating be
hind the plate. E. Mitchell is in the
hospital at present but will be back
in harness soon ready to fight for a
berth as receiver.
Hayes Versatile.
Mitchell of last year's freshman
nine is trying out for first. Captain
Hayes is also working out for this
base. The versatility of "Doc" Hayes
is proving a revelation to Stanford
ans, who did not realize that Hayes
.vas a nifty receiver as well as a
liurler. The position behind the plate
looked to be one of the weak ones this
eason, so the captain tried his hand
it the work behind the log, and is dis
playing top-notch form there.
The keystone bag finds Joe Braden,
Charlie Cowan, and Tommy Thomp
son competing. "Mush" Stevens is
playing short. Mel Shriver and Bill
Reagon, both members of the nine-
teeners' team, are playing third
Lilly, Noonan, Bililman, Wilkins,
Ford and others are working out in
the outfield.
Name Freshmen Soon.
Coach Wilson expects to name the
freshmen squad this week and those
not named will work in the peanut
league. This league is to be used as
a farming ground for the varsity and
freshman teams, and when a man
shows promise there, he will he given
a tryout.
George Hensel of the varsity and
Guy Draper, freshmen hurler, both
started as peanutters last year, and
were taken up 011 the varsity squade.
