# MRS. KELLOGG WILL LECTURE THIS EVENING
## WAR RELIEF IS TOPIC Wife of Stanford Professor Will Give First Lecture in Series 
### 
Mrs. Vernon Lyman Kellogg will
deliver what promises to be the most
interesting lecture of the semester in
the Little Theater tonight. The talk
is the first Tuesday evening enter
tainment of the new term. Although
i Mrs. Kellogg has not announced her
j specific topic, she will speak on "Bel-
I gian Relief," and since several people
have asked that her account be per
sonal experiences, it is expected that
her lecture will be made up of actual
records of her work in Belgium.
Mrs. Kellogg, and her husband,
head of the Entomology department at
Stanford University, have spent the
last six months in Belgium, working
under H. C. Hoover, '95, head of the
Relief Commission in Europe. Mrs.
Kellogg worked with the "Commis
sion for the Relief in Belgium," com
posed of the women workers in the
organization that is feeding the Bel
gians. She was with the women,
talked to them and became close
friends all over Belgium with both
refugees and the wealthier classes.
When Mrs. Kellogg planned to re
turn to America, she and her husband
agreed not to speak of their work at
all, but through the efforts of Pro
fessor G. J. Peirce, chairman of the
Public Exercises committee, she has
agreed to address Stanford students.
This will be the only occasion when
the public will be able to hear her,
however, and since she is one of the
few women who can give a personal
account of one of the greatest trag
edies of modern warfare, a large
crowd is expected at the lecture.
Mrs. Kellogg will begin her talk
promptly at 7:30, in the Little The
ater, room 100.
