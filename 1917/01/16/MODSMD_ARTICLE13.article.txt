### 
Limitation of dances was the most
important problem decided at the
meeting of the Encina Club, last night.
It was decided to limit the number
in attendance to 115 couples. Grad
uates and upperclassmen are to get
the first chance to sign up for all the
Encinas, and at the first and third the
sophomores get second choice, while
the freshmen draw lots for the few
that remain. At the second Encina,
the freshmen get second choice, in
stead of the sophomores. The influx
of new men when the additions to the
hall were finished, raised the number
living there to 450, making some, ac
tion of this kind imperative.
Walt Gores, new president of the
club, has initiated several changes
which will add to the comfort and
looks of the hall. Among these addi
tions are new lights for the halls,
now tile showers, and curtains for
the club room. The rooms are also to
be re-numbered, using a system which
will make the easy location of all
rooms possible, without the confus
ion which now exists. A guest room
for the entertainment of friends and
relatives is also to be provided.
