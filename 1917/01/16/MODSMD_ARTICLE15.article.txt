# THINK TWICE
## 
### 
This week finds the Stanford Union
in the midst of a campaign for mem
bership—something which, if the
Union were all that it might be and
all that its builders intended it should
be, would never burden the annals of
Stanford history. Membership should
be voluntary, and not a matter of so
licitation. Why is the Union obliged
to campaign for its members? It is
because it has little to attract the
average student. The club has failed
as a social center. it must offer
something more, if it is to be a spon
taneous success.
A solution of the problem involved
is the aim of the management in the
present campaign. It is hoped that
a series of University smokers, the
first to be given January 25, will do a
great deal toward satisfying the de
mand for social activity. If they re
ceive the hearty co-operation of the
Stanford public, this is not too much
to expect. However, something of a
more substantial and less stereotyped
nature is necessary.
It was expected when the Union
was built that it would become a
mingling place for faculty and stu
dents. If this hope had been more
nearly realized, the club would in all
probability be on a firmer foundation
today, for there is no attraction like
that of worth-while companionship.
Largely due to the lack of interest
among the faculty, however, the Union
has failed to fulfill this expectation.
The members of the faculty who be
long to and frequent the club are
few. An effort is also being made
this week to stimulate interest in this
element of the University, and we
look to see an adequate response.
Meanwhile, let us do our part in
putting the Union on its feet. When
asked to join, think twice before re
fusing.
