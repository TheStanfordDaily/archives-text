## 
### 
Marathon swim will start next Mon
day, and swimming coach Brandsten
wants all men who are intending to
enter this race but have not been
timed to determine their handicap, to
report to him for a trial sometime
this week.
This race will be a workout for all
the-old swimmers and as it is a handi
cap affair and the poorest swimmer
has as much chance as the best to
win, a great number of men are ex
pected out. Brandsten has the time
of all the men who swim in the tank
very much, but new men, and men
who have not been swimming in the
pool much, are asked to report as
soon as possible so that coach Brand
sten can prepare the handicaps.
Each man entered in this race
swims three minutes every day for
ten days, and the first place goes to
the swimmer who has gone the greater
distance. A chart will be posted, and
men can swim the three minutes any
time during the day or even two
three minute periods a day, if the
contestant so desires. Brandsten is
around the pool all day, and all that
is necessary is to notify him when
ready to start so he can hold the
watch. Monday will be the first day
and the race will continue until ten
days have elapsed. Over twenty-five
men are expected to enter.
