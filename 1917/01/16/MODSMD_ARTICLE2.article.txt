# Peanut League Will Start Play Tonight
## Captain Hayes Annouces Teams and Schedule—Two Cups Go to Winners 
### 
Four teams comprising the year's
peanut league, will start tonight on a
schedule that will carry them through
the last week in March, according to
announcement of "Doc" Hayes, var
sity baseball captain, today.
The respective managers have lined
up teams that seem to be evenly bal
anced and some hot battles are to be
expected. The future Conny Macks
chosen by captain Hayes to lead the
teams are: Whites, E. N. Wright, *1G;
Reds, Q. Cass, '16; Blues, Z. K. Mel
con, '16; Blacks, A. M. Smith, '17.
There has been lively bidding among
them during the past week for the
services of known star ball players.
The proposed strike of the baseball
fraternity lias not as yet struck Stan
ford and there are no holdouts re
ported.
Captain Hayes announced that two
trophies will be put up for the pea
nut-leaguers, one to go to the team
winning the pennant, the other to be
presented to the leading batsman.
The managers have been holding
practice sessions for their hopefuls,
with the result that much inside base
ball can be expected when the sea
son gets under way. Although full
teams have been signed by each man
ager, the ranks of the league will be
considerably augmented, according to
captain Hayes, when c6ach Wilson
drops about fifteen men from the
freshman squad. All of these will go
to the "bushes."
A system of surveillance and es
pionage will be introduced by captain
Hayes at each game of the league
when he, coach Wilson or members of
the varsity squad will act as scouts
and report on players who show
enough class to warrant their being
transferred to the varsity or fresh
man squads.

teams are:
Whites—E. N. Wright, manager;
