# Dr. Rixford Speaks on Reserve Hospital
## Lane Hospital Professor Addresses Palo Alto Red Cross Chapter 
### 
"Reserve Hospitals for the Army
and Navy" was tlie subject of a lec
ture in the Little Theater last night
|by Dr. Emmet Rixford, member of
the faculty of Lane Hospital. Dr.
Rixford is in charge of the naval re
serve at Lane Hospital, one of the
four naval hospitals of the United
States. His purpose in delivering the
lecture here was to urge active sup
port of the Stanford unit by the local
Red Cross.
According to Dr. Rixford there are
twenty-five army and four naval re
serve hospitals located in the United
States. The University of California
maintains an army hospital in San
Francisco, while the naval unit is
maintained by Stanford. There are
three other hospitals for the navy in
the United States. These are at Los
Angeles, Brooklyn and Philadelphia.
I For the San Francisco unit it is neces
sary to raise $25,000. Most of this
has already been subscribed and the
work that is necessary at present is
to make bandages and supplies. It is
this work that the different chapters
of the Red Cross are accomplishing
at present, and which the Stanford
unit is to begin in the near future.
In case of war the whole organiza
tion of the hospital is put under the
control of the regular army or naval
officials and is conducted as a regu
lar base hospital.
