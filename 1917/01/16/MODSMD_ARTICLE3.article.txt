# Ford Replaces Hodcarriers on Campus

"Stone walls do not a prison
make,
Nor iron-bars a cage "
And neither do chains, though
they be a foot thick and weigh a
ton, and despite the fact that they
may be locked with the largest of
large padlocks, succeed in justi
fying their existence by keeping
automobiles off the quadrangle.
For an automobile, some people
who possess specimens of the
same brand persist in calling
them "automobiles," lias slipped
into the sacred confines of the
quad. Some people say it slipped
in through a break in one of the
links of the chains, and brays
along on its way every day, just
outside the rooms of the English
building. It might be mentioned
that the new rooms of the English
department furnished the reason
for the placing of the chains at
the borders of the quad. The
noise of this self-alleged auto
mobile can be clearly heard in
these rooms. Ask the professors
who are sentenced to serve time
in those rooms for verification of
this.
No longer is the stentorian cry
of the bricklayer, "Mort, mort,
more mort," answered by the
thick, brogue-tinged voice of some
read-headed son of Erin, "Oi, Oi,
sir." And 110 longer does this
same red-headed hod-carrier pain
fully climb a ladder with a heavy
load of brick or mortar on his
shoulder.
His place has been usurped by
this automobile, a Ford, whose
every move is a signal for creaks
and groans and much lamentation.
Tile Ford makes a trip, hack and
forth along its track every time
men working on the roof of the
new art museum have need of ma
terial, taking the place of a don
key-engine.
Despite President Wilbur's rul
ing against automobiles, despite
the protests of the students and
professors upon whose nerves the
noise is beginning to tell, the
Ford daily performs its task, its
noise increasing every day. But
then of course, to call a Ford an
automobile is splitting hairs very
finely.
