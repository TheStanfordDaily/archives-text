# Cardinal Quintet Meets Pacific Team Saturday
## 
### 
The first basketball game of the
season will be played with the College
of the Pacific, Saturday night, on the
latter's court. The game with the
College of the Pacific was originally
scheduled for March 10, but by open
ing the season a week earlier it will
leave a date for the third game with
the University of California, if one is
necessary. The date will otherwise
be left free for a game with some
other club.
