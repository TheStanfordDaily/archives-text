# TRACKSTERS HOLD INITIAL WORKOUT
## 
### 
Captain Aupperle conducted the
initial workout on the cinder path,
last night, and put the men through
a light practice. It is Aupperle's in
tention to hold light workouts daily
for the first two or three weeks, and
no meets, even of an informal nature,
will be held until after the first of
February. The cold weather makes
training rather difficult and necessary
to hold only light workouts.
The turn out last night was very
good and "Skin" Wilson and Johnny
Norton assisted Aupperle in instruct
ing the men. Selection of a coach for
the track team will probably be made
by the end of the week and along with
that work will begin in earnest.
