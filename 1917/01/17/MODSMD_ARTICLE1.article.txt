# FROSH NINE WILL PLAY ELEVEN GAMES
## ANNOUNCE SCHEDULE Two Contests Arranged With Californiaâ€”Series Starts March 24 
### 
Eleven games have been scheduled
for the Stanford freshmen baseball
team this season. Graduate manager
Behrens today announced the tenta
tive list of dates, and while there may
be some minor changes, the contests
will probably be staged in the order
scheduled. Some strong teams are
slated to meet the babes and it will
take a good nine to emerge victorious
in a majority of the games.
Last year was the first attempt at
freshmen baseball at Stanford since
1908. It was a success and the games
with the University of California were
well attended and hard fought. The
freshmen nine developed some of the
best ball tossers that the Cardinal
now has, and it is expected that the
first year team will receive the strong
support of the University this year.
The schedule as it now stands calls
for eight games preliminary to the
contests with California, and if it is
necessary to play more than two
games in the big series, a third will
be staged.
Palo Alto high school, San Jose
high school, and the High School of
Commerce of San Francisco have the
strongest nines of the preparatory
schools. San Jose high was defeated
last year by a 7 to (> score and the
visitors will have the same lineup this
season. College of the Pacific is oil
the date list and from all reports they
will have a good squad of tossers.
It is hard to judge the relative abil
ities of the rival freshmen teams this
early in the season, as the squads
have hardly been selected. Stanford
seems to have some excellent pros
pects. Pike, Galloway, Morris, Liefer
and Joerg have shown considerable
class on the diamond, and there are
undoubtedly others eligible for fresh
man competition who will make a
strong bid for berths on the 1920
delegation.
The complete schedule of the tenta
tive dates are as follows: January
20, Palo Alto high school; January 27,
Manzanita Hall; February 3, Oakland
high school; February 10, San Jose
high school; January 17, Palo Alto
high school; February 24, College of
the Pacific; March 3, High School of
Commerce of San Francisco; March
10, College of the Pacific; March 24,
University of California; March 31,
California, and March 3, California.
