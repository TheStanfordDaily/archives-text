# Date for Masquers Play Thrown Open
## Dramtaic Club Believes Time Allowed too Short for Usual Production 
### 
That Masquers will not give their
annual play this year was announced
today and as a result February 2, a
closed date for their show, has been
thrown open to all functions. Three
weeks after college opened this se
mester was too short a time to ar
range a play of the standard usually
presented by this society, and since an
inferior show would be presented
Masquers has decided to give up their
date.
It is impossible to secure any eve
ning for a closed date this semester,
so the show has been abandoned.
Some other activity will be presented
later in the semester to take the place
of the regular performance, however,
in order that the usual yearly func
tion may not be entirely abandoned.
