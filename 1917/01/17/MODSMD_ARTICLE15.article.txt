Five candidates seeking nomination
for editorship of the 1919 Quad, the
number which reported to Editor
Wohlford last night, is rather a
meager showing for a position of
such responsibility. One object of the
tryout system inaugurated last year
was to bring out a greater number of
able men. Under the old system only
those who had made good in some
other field of journalism were well
enough known to run for the position
of Quad editor. The tryout plan
makes additional material available,
for the sophomore class may be as
sured that any one nominated by the
committee will be capable.
The Quad presents a broader field
for literary and artistic endeavor than
is to be found in any other campus
publication. It is the most complete
chronicler of Stanford's history, and
the problem of choosing a Quad editor
demands careful consideration. The
best man of his class should be
chosen if the book is to realize its
ideal. In order that this may be ac
complished, it is essential that a
greater number try out. Surely there
are more than five men of ability in
the present sophomore class!
Another important consideration is
the staff which will help the future
editor in his work. Those why try
out for the position of editor will
form the nucleus for a far more ef
ficient working unit than would be
possible to secure with inexperienced
material.
There is room and work for more
candidates, and it is to be hoped that
Editor Wbhlford's squad will increase.
