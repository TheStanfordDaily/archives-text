# Little Support May Close Club House
## Membership Decreases to One-Third of What it Was One Year Ago 
### 
Unless more women join to sup
port the Women's Club House, it must
be closed. Only 73 members have
joined this semester, and the club
house must count on many more than
twice that number to meet merely its
current running expenses. Member
ship has greatly decreased during the
past year, there having been 206 mem
bers last spring.
Despite the fact that alumnae, fac
ulty women, and other clubhouse
friends are working faithfully to make
it a completed, attractive building,
Stanford women students are showing
slight interest in the enterprise.
The installation of steam heat has
made it possible for more meetings
to be held there, since both the sec
ond floor and club rooms may be used.
Thus it happens that more than ever
tho clubhouse is being utilized for
women's organization meetings, teas,
practicing and luncheons.
In order to retain the use of this
new but essential institution at Stan
ford, a plea is sent forth by those in
terested for more members. Dues are
$l.f>o per semester and may be paid
to Mrs. Ewell, the matron.
