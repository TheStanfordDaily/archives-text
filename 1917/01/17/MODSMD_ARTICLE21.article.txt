# California Athletes Start Spring Training
## 
### 
Spring athletics at California began
today with the first call for baseball,
crew and track candidates. Indica
tions point to strong teams in all ac
tivities. Baseball coach Carl Zamlock
has announced that seven veterans of
last year's varsity will report, and
with a wealth of material from last
year's freshman nine, the usual caliber
team will no doubt be turned out.
Sammy Adair, who was out of the
game last year through injuries, will
hold down his old berth in center,
and Dimmock, who won two games
last year, will be on the mound.
Other veterans are Rohwer, Works,
Sarbridge, C. Rohwer, and Smith.
Only two members of last year's
crew will return, but coach Wallis
expects to draw largely from last
year's victorious freshman boat. The
armada will be completely equipped
when the new shell, power launch,
and two sets of new oars which have
been ordered arrive.
