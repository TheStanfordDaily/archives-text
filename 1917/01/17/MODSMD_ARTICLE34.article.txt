# 255 Now Signed for Military Duty
## Major Bugge Outlines Military Policy of U.S. to Troops in Lecture 
### 
Two hundred arid fifty men are now
enrolled in military training, and ad
ditional registrations are being re
ceived every day. Of this number, al
most a hundred are new men. Fifty
of the men who took drill last year
have not yet re-registered nor turned
in their uniforms. These men should
report to the gym at once.
Lecture on >Yur Policy.
A lecture by Major Bugge replaced
the regular drill yesterday afternoon.
'"The Military Policy of the United
States" was his topic, but most of
the lecture was an exposition of the
jack of policy up to two or three
years ago.
Major Bugge outlined the main facts
concerning each war the United States
has engaged in, showing the policies,
or lack of policies, the results and the
expenses of each. Each war was
longer than it should have been, ac
cording to the major, who pointed out
the remedy in each instance.
Distinguishing between military re
sources and military strength, Major
Bugge said:
"We have lots of raw material but
no finished product to speak of.
"A man cannot be considered as
being a complete citizen," he con
tinued, "until he is in a position to
fulfill every obligation that his coun
try may require of him. The highest
duty of citizenship is to protect the
country in time of great need, and
without training one cannot do it.
"There is no credit in dying for
your country, unless you can do so
intelligently.
"As there seem to be some erron
eous impressions abroad in regard to
the recent resolutions passed by the
academic council in regard to phy
sical or military training for under
graduates, the following explanation
seems proper:
"Every undergraduate (man or
woman), beginning next academic
year, must take three hours per week
of physical or military training dur
ing the first two academic years un
less they receive credit for similar
work done at other colleges.
Must Make Up Failures.
"The work is a prerequisite to
graduation and each student must
register in the branch he chooses to
take up and he will not be allowed to
change during that academic year. A
failure must be made up by taking the
work over again without credit.
"The freshmen of this year must
take one or the other subject next
year without credit unless they have
taken military training for six hours
per week during both semesters this
academic year.
"After this semester the regular
course will be three hours per week.
The advanced course will consist of
five hours per week.
"Hereafter, anyone who desires to
take military training and who has
not had the equivalent or six hours
per week for two semesters must
take it without credit. Those who
are sufficiently advanced to take up
the advanced course may do so and
receive credit as heretofore.
"A certificate to the effect that the
student has completed the course at a
citizens' training camp wilt be con
sidered equivalent to one semester's
work."
