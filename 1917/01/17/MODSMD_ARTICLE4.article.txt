# MEMBERSHIP CAMPAIGN OF UNION NOW IN FULL SWAY
## 
### 
No real idea of the progress of the
Union membership campaign could be
obtained today, owing to the failure
of workers to report to the captains
of their respective teams, and of the
captains to report to headquarters.
But two of the dozen teams now at
work sent in reports, and even these
were but partial. These brought in
17 new cards, raising the total to 283.
Captains Must Report.
It is imperative that every captain
turn in some report by 1 o'clock to
morrow afternoon. Reports can be
left .at the' Union with D. B. Van
Every, '18, or with M. C. Hall, '18, at
The Daily Palo Alto office.

Gilvray, '17, are two new captains,

tee.
