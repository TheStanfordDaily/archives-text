# STANFORD LEADS IN BELGIAN WORK

### 
"If Belgian relief is the work of any
one group of people it is the work of
Stanford University," declared Mrs.
Vernon Lyman Kellogg, wife of Pro
fessor Kellogg, head of the Entomol
ogy department, in her lecture on
"Belgian Relief" in the Little Theater
last night. "There is the greatest
bond of sympathy between the work
ers in Belgium and tills University.
Mr. Hoover doesn't talk very often,
but when he does speak to his helpers
it is often of Stanford."
Was Impressed Witli Women.
Mrs. Kellogg, who worked with the
Belgium women during most of the
six months that she was in Europe,
was greatly impressed with the
mothers of this brave little country.
"Even after two years of war the
women of Belgium have not stopped
smiling. The men in charge of the
relief work are getting food into Bel
gium, but the women are distributing
it to the people," she said.
"Soap costs more over there than
butter," Mrs. Kellogg declared, "but
still the women keep themselves and
their families spotlessly clean. They
arc taking care of their children and

feeding Belgium at the same time." A
million and a half dishes of soup are
passed out by the women every day,
according to Mrs. Kellogg, and in ad
dition hundreds of women with money
conduct cafes and restaurants where
meals can be bought for ten cents or
less and others have fitted boarding
houses with small apartments for
hundreds of families.
People Are Changed.
"One of the worst things about the
war is the way people are changed by
its horrors," said Mrs. Kellogg.
"Even the children of Belgium are al
ways playing and thinking war." She
explained the case of one old man who
in speaking of a German airship said:
"Before the war I thought they were
things from heaven, but now they are
only something that must be crushed
to the earth and destroyed.'*
The women of Belgium have erected
houses where the lace workers who
have nothing to do may find a position,
"These bouses are the centers of hope
for Belgium," was Mrs. Kellogg's
statement. "The shops have saved the
women from the streets and the moral
effect of the work in them will be the
saving of the country."
