# Shots Make Lecture on Revolution Vivid to Class in History
## 
### 
Fired by the dramatic and interest
gripping details of the preliminaries
| to the American Revolution, a class in
American history this morning took
rapid notes on the professor's lecture.
Members of the class forgot them
selves, forgot they were in a class
room at Stanford, and for the moment
imagined they were on the battlefield
at Lexington.
j "There stood the sturdy minute
men, in serried ranks, watching with
bated breath the rapid approach of
the oncoming red-coats, the flower of
the armies of Europe," same from the
lips of the lecturer. "Then came the
famous shot "
"800m —boom—bang!" in quick suc
-1 cession sounded three cracks—to the
intent ears of the history class they
could be nothing less than shots. In
the class room, the famous pande
monium reigned. One poor freshman,
beset by the idea that the red-coats
were firing at him, attempted to hide,
like the ostrich, behind his note-book;
another, a member of the five hun
dred, picked up her skirts in dismay,
and started for an open window.
The lecturer, losing his poise in the
reality and vividness of the moment,
looked around in a dazed manner, re
gained his mental equilibrium and
then proceeded with his lecutre —
"No, not that shot; that's only the
blasted blasting that is going on down
at the old library site. During the re
mainder of this course on the Revolu
tion, my lectures will be accompanied
by these shots, I am told, that is until
they succeed in tearing down what
remains of the building. This will add
a touch of reality to the course."
