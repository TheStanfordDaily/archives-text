# WILL ASSIST BROWN WITH FOOTBALL
## Advisory Athletic Board Takes Action Approving Choice of Executive Committee 
### 
Rurie R. Templeton, '15, was rec
omraended by the executive committee
to fill the position of track coach at
Stanford and act as assistant football
coach, last night, at the first meeting
of the executive committee this se
mester. At the same meeting Floyd
Brown was again recommended as
head football coach. The Advisory
Hoard met this morning and con
firmed the recommendation of the
executive committee, so the only thing
remaining is for Templeton to accept
the offer, which he will probably do
tonight.
"Itic" Well Known.
"Ric" Templeton will undoubtedly
prove a success in the new position.
He has had a great deal of experi
ence, and is exceedingly well liked at
Stanford. He came to the University
from Palo Alto high school, where he
had made an enviable record in pre
paratory school athletics. He made
his freshman football team and was
twice chosen as varsity substitute. In
1916 he played one of the wing po
sitions against the University of Santa
Clara, and made a record of convert
ing all six of the scores made by
Stanford, one of which he had made
himself.
Former Track Captain.
In 1915 lie was a member of the
varsity track team, and was the chief
factor in the scant win over the Uni
versity of California. He won the
high jump, placed third in the high
hurdles, and after the Bears figured
that they had won the meet, he jumped
into third place in the broad jump,
and swung the score to the Cardinal's
favor. Templeton was selected by his
team-mates to captain the 191G squad,
but owing to trouble with his eyes
he had to drop out of athletics for
the year.
Templeton will take up his duties as
track coach this week. In conjunc
tion with captain Aupperle, "Skin"
Wilson and Johnny Norton, he should
be able to develop a wonderful team
of cinder path stars with the material
available.
