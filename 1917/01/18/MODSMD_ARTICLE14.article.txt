# Stafford Darlings in Opening Contest
## Cardinal Nine Not Yet Chosen to Meet College Stars Saturday 
### 
Stanford varsity baseball team will
meet strong opposition in the first
game of the season, to be pliayed next
Saturday on the local diamond. The
contest is slated with the team of
former college stars managed by
"Wabbles" Stafford, former second
baseman of the Cardinal nine. Staf
ford, in announcing his lineup to
graduate manager Behrens, calls his
ball tossers "My Darlings," so prob
ably tliis name will stick to the con
tingent.
Lineup Announced.
Stafford announces his lineup as
follows: "Dutch" Rock of Seattle, in
the Northwest league, and Buehn of
the Twilight league, as heavers;
Rattner of Lowell high school as
catcher; Harry Heilmann of Detroit,
in the American league, as first base
man; Stafford at second; George
Presley, former Stanford star and
varsity coach, at third, and Sammy
Bohen of the San Francisco Seals and
Tacoma, in the Northwestern league,
at shortstop. The outfield will be
made up of Dooling and Charlie Aus
tin, old Stanford players, and Meyer of
Spokane, in the Northwestern league.
Varsity in Fair Shape.
The Stanford squad has been work
ing out daily and will be in fairly
good condition for the initial game
Saturday. Captain "Doc" Hayes has
been handling the team during most of
the practices, as coach Wilson is at
tempting to pick out a freshman
squad. The varsity team will not be
named until tomorrow, but there will
probably be a number of bench warm
ers get into the contest before the
ninth inning is completed.
