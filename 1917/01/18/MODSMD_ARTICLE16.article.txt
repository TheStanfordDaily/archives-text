What retrograding influence is it
that has forced the Women's Club
House to add its plea for more mem
bers to that of the Union? It may be
a sympathetic illness which has
struck this institution of Stanford's
Five Hundred. Financial debility
seems to be contagious. Whatever
the tfoiible, it behooves the women of
the University to get behind the Club
House and make it a success. They
cannot afford to let it fail.
Perhaps the benefit of the club to
individuals as such is negligible but
to the women, taken as a body, it
means much. For this reason it must
be supported from a sense of loyalty,
with the good of women's activities
at heart. The club provides a center,
about which these activities revolve —
a place for meetings and various
functions which, without the Club
House, would be seriously handi
capped. The desire for individual
gain should be subordinated to that
fof thfe' Common welfare.
This Institution has grown to be
an essential factor in the life of Uni
versfty tvbmen. Its full worth might
faW toow be realized, but if it should
b6 clofeed, due to the inability to
ineet its'financial obligations, there is
no doubt hut that Its loss would be
greatly felt.' Tt is the duty of the
women to' join in the attempt to
rescue the club from impending
financial ruin.
