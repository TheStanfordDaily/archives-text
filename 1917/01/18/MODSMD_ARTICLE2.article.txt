# Freshmen May Box Against California
## Practically All of Last Year's Mitt Artists Are Back in College 
### 
California has requested freshmen
boxing matches to be. held the same
evening as the senior bouts, an
nounced 11. W. Maloney, today.
Whether or not this will be accepted
depends upon the number and class
of the freshmen in the boxing classes.
Boxing is now a minor sport and
a circle "S" goes to the winners in
the California meet. A great deal of
interest is being taken in tlie sport
and the classes Monday, Wednesday
and Friday, under Mr. Maloney, and
Tuesday and Thursday under Flint,
have increased.
Veterans Return.
A great many new men as well as
old men are out. T. S. Carey, 'IS,
who represented Stanford in the
heavyweight division, is back, and It.
S. Lytle, '17, the middleweight, is
back, but Mr. Maloney says that E.
L. Pedley, 'It), is showing form that
will make Lytic hustle to hold his
own. In the welterweights, O. M.
Sullivan, '19, and W. 11. Wass, 'IS,
the runnerup, are both on hand. 11.
It. Witherbee, '19, the featherweight,
and L. C. Bettanier, '18, the bantam,
are back, and two veterans, J. D.
Flint, gr., and P. TI. Jones, '18, arc
fighting it out in the lightweight di
vision.
It is not known how many fresh
men are in the classes but some at
tention is going to be paid to them
immediately to see if the class could
make a creditable appearance in case
freshman bouts with California are
staged.
