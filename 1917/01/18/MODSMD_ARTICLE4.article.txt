## 
### 
Following the regular workout of
the basketball squad last evening,
coacli Wilson named the squad from
which the first varsity will be chosen.
The squad includes the eight men,
Wheatly, Bonney, Roney, Righter,
Estes, Sullivan, Greve and Dolan, who
made the trip to southern California
during the Christmas holidays, and
In addition Pelouze, Schwarzenbek,
Wallace, Lytle, Jewett, Needham and
Coppes were added.
These men have all proven their
worth as varsity material on the Stan
ford courts before, and will give coach
Wilson considerable trouble in nam
ing his varsity five when the date of
the first California game comes
around. These men will doubtless all
have a chance to show in the prelim
inary games, the first of which will
be played at San Jose, Saturday night,
against the College of the Pacific
team.
The College of the Pacific has an
unusually strong team this year, hav
ing recently held the highly touted
Santa Clara varsity to a 30-2G score.
Coach Wilson will probably announce
the team which will start against
Pacific after tonight's practice.
