# SIXTEEN MEN ON FRESHMEN BALL SQUAD
## Coach Russel Wilson Selects Good Men for First 1920 Aggregation 
### 
Sixteen men were picked yesterday
by coach Wilson on the freshman
baseball squad. The men who were
not successful in getting on were sent
to the peanut league, where they will
be closely watched for signs of ability
enough to be on the 1920 aggregation.
The men who were selected last
night are Lifur, Pike, Wayland, Cass,
Knox, Lorison, Abrahms, Hunter,
Noyes, Tehan, Galloway, Joerg, Spar
ling, Morse, Howes and Laugenour.
Morse and Lifur are working out as
pitchers. Wayland, Cass, Knox,
Howes and Laugenour are outfield
ers. At first are Pike and Lorison.
Abrahms is trying for third and
Hunter for second. Galloway is
working at short, while Sparling and
Joerg are trying for catcher.
From early season form the fresh
men should turn out a strong com
bination this year. In Lifur and
Morse, the fast little Palo Alto boy,
coach Wilson has two strong heavers.
On the receiving end Joerg is show-
ing plenty of class. The hardest
fight for position at present is on
first, since Pike and Lorison have
had experience and are playing hard.
Both men will undoubtedly get on the
team, but it is impossible to pick the
winner between the two to hold down
the initial bag.
At short, Galloway will be one of
the strongest men on the squad, when
he has acquired a little more baseball
knowledge. Abrahms on third has
shown plenty of form for so early in
the season, and should be a good man.
It the outfield Cass and Wayland have
been hitting the ball at a clip that
gives hope for their playing later.
Freshmen who were sent to the
peanut league will De under a sys
tem of supervision by coach Wilson
and captain "Doc" Hayes or some
other member of the varsity, and will
be put on the 1920 squad whenever
they show enough ability to warrant
their selection. Last season several
men were sent from the "bushes" to
both the varsity and freshmen teams,
and as a result the present squad
will be considerably changed later.
