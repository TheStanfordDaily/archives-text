## Sequoia Appears on Campus Tomorrow Issue to Feature Illustrated Story of San Francisco Water Front 
### 
With innovations in the width of
columns, calculated to add fifteen per
cent of reading matter, Sequoia makes
its first J 917 appearance on the cam
pus tomorrow, filled with a variety
of literary productions which cover
the serious, the humorous, and the
poetic, and enriched by a greater
number of illustrations than have ap
peared in previous volumes of the
English Club publication.
San Francisco Subject of Article.
Occupying the feature space is an
impressionistic article from the pen
of G. Charles Hodges of the History
department, entitled "The Seven Seas
and the City," which is a most vivid
picturization of the cosmopolitan at
mosphere of San Francisco's water
front, where are gathered the sliTps
and produce of seven seas. Mr. |
Hodges is Far Eastern editor of "The I
World Court" magazine, and his
charming style makes his story of the
metropolis of the west a rare treat.
The story is illustrated by six photo
graphic reproductions, including a
full-page frontispiece.
One of the best stories that Sequoia
has secured for some time has been
written in two parts by Dale Van
Every, '18, entitled "A Comedy of
Wills," the first part of which appears
in the first issue. Another new
writer, W. W. Wellman, '20, contrib
utes "The Brother of a Fortune."
Ideal Newspaper Impossible.
In "A Diogenes of Journalism," H.
S. Marshutz, '17, tells in a compelling
and humorous style the disastrous ex- â– 
perience of a one-time San Francisco 1
newspaper editor, McEwen, who at
tempted to publish a weekly paper
built on principles of honesty, draw
ing as a conclusion the fact that hon
esty and newspaper success cannot go
hand In hand. "Medical Matrimony," |
by Lansing Warren, '17, strikes a
humorous vein. A war poem with a
somewhat new thought is the con
tribution of Geroid Robinson, '17,
"Before My Eyes." Contributors to
the Sketch Book and Broad Outlook
include Sherwood Chapman, '16, and
Jessie Wood, '20, who appears In Se
quoia for the first time.
R. A. Donaldson, '17, who takes
charge of Sequoia's editorial policy
with the coming issue, strikes a pert
inent chord In his leading editorial,
which he calls "The Turning Point,"
and in which he raises the question
as to whether or not the many changes
which have taken place at Stanford
in the last year or two are for the
best Interest of Stanford and Stan
ford Ideals.
