Putting It Over
BY EDWIN GORDON LAWRENCE
Not long ago I heard a young man of 20 years say, in response to
a kindly criticism from his father, "What does it matter, Dad, so long
as I put it over?"
This "putting it over" seems to have taken strong hold upon the
young men and women of today. They seem to consider it a com
mendable feat if they are able to "put one over" on parent, customer
or employer.
It is the act of a sneak to "put one over" on a parent in such a
manner as to hide the truth. It is the act of a thief to "put one over"
on a customer so us to swindle liim. It is the act of a liar to "put
one over" on an employer with the intention of deceiving him. But,
bad as is the "putting one over" on the parent, the customer or the
employer, far worse is the effect on the "smart" one himself.
Those who start out in life with the idea that all that is necessary
to success is to "put things over," are making a grievous mistake. By
merely squeezing through by hook or crook they not only fail to give
the best possible service, but they also destroy their capacity for good
work.
The energy employed to varnish over indifferent work would, if
applied toward increasing efficiency, bring a far greater recompense
than can ever be gained by the one whose only aim is to "put things
over."
Let the "smart" one mend his ways, let him aim to do things in
the best possible manner, let him use his energies for p'utting forth
good work and not to gloss over that which is poor, and he will find
that, ultimately, the best way is the easiest way.
