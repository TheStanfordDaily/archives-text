# LIMIT ACTIVITIES CONFERENCE SCHEME
## VOTE NEXT MEETING Point System Suggested Means to Restrict Holding of Offices 
### 
Men's Student Conference, meeting
last night for the first time this se
mester, received the report of J. K.
Norton, '16, chairman of the commit
tee which was appointed last semes
ter to devise a means of limiting the
number of offices which can be held
by one man during any one semester.
The recommendation as submitted by
the committee provides for the es
tablishment of a system of points for
all important offices of student ac
tivity.
Thirty-five points is the maximum
of points allowed a student for a se
mester, but at the conclusion of the
semester the slate is cleaned, and a
fresh start of points is made the en
suing term.
Action will be taken on the report
at the next meeting, two weeks from
last night.
The recommendation, as submitted
by chairman Norton, follows:
The Faculty Committee on Student
Affairs attended the meeting last night
at the invitation of the Conference,
as provided for by the Conference
constitution.
President of the Conference, J. W.
Templeton, '17, told the Conference
that strenuous effort must be made by
the heads of the various groups to pre
vent any infraction of the regulations
concerning intoxicants. Announce
ment was made that the Student
Council has prepared a letter to be
sent to all groups urging precautions
in this regard. He stated that the
Council will be forced to act uncom
promisingly on all cases brought to
its attention.
Appointment was made of a com
mittee of three to investigate the
question of either regulation or aboli
tion of the annual holdover party, ap
pointment of which was laid over
from last semester. President Tem
pleton will also appoint a committee
to investigate the feasibility of a
Plug-Ugly in some suitable form.
"A definite number or points is as
signed to each of the most important
and strenuous student offices or posi
tions. No student can during any one
semester, hold offices or positions
which total more than thirty-five
points.
"The offices and positions listed in
this regulation have been grouped
under headings such as 'Associated
Students,' 'Class Officers,' 'Athletics.'
In counting up a student's points,
only the office or position under a
heading which has the highest num
ber of points shall be counted. For
example, under the heading 'Associ
ated Students': If a student is presi
dent of the Associated Students, it
shall not be regarded in counting his
points, that he is also a member of
the Executive committee.
"It is specifically provided that the
editor of The Daily Palo Alto, who
is ex-officio a member of the execu
tive committee, shall not have points
countcd against him because of his
membership on the executive commit
tee.
"This regulation shall become com
pletely effective at the beginning of
the fall semester of 1917. It shall be
effective this semester with regard to
the acquisition of new positions, as
soon as adopted by the Men's Confer
ence and made public."
