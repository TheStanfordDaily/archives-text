Sloth and unbridled ambition have
ruined many a man's chance to
achieve notable success. A remedy
for the former is hard to find. The
victim goes to seed. Ambition, if al
lowed to run unchecked, overtaxes
the strength, and makes it impossible
for one to do justice to all he tries.
A remedy for this at Stanford has
been devised in the point sys
tem for University activities, the plan
for which was presented to the Stu
dent Conference last evening. This
plan has merit and should receive
favorable consideration from the Con
ference.
Although extreme cases are com
paratively rare, it is possible and
probable, as matters now stand, for
a man or woman to shoulder so much
work and responsibility that the in
evitable result is failure in studies
and, not unlikely, physical break
down. A good percentage of proba
tion is due to too much "college ac
tivity." An energetic student often
does not know when to stop—does not
realize until too late that he is over
taxing his strength, and overesti
mating his ability. The point system
will realize for him. It will stop him
up before he oversteps the bounds of
reason.
So much for the individual; but
what of the job? It, too, must be con
sidered, and is considered under the
proposed limitation. A student en
trusted with three or four important
positions is, of course, unable to do
justice to all or any of them. He is
expected to make good, however, and
when he does not do as well as he
might if his attention were not di
vided, the University suffers.
It may be said that this plan does
not provide for the exceptional stu
dent, —who can handle an unusual
amount of work and still do justice to
it and himself. This student, how
ever, is rare, and the process of find
ing him by experiment is a costly
one. It is far better to accept the av
erage standard. Few of us are ex
ceptional.
