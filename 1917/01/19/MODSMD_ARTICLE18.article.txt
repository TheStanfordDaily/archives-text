"Governor Stanford"
Locomotive in Museum.
"Governor Stanford," the first loco
motive operated on the Central Pacific
Railway, has recently been placed in
the Stanford museum. In order to
get the locomotive into the museum,
a hole big enough for its passage had
to be cut into the brick and cement
wall of the building.
Ever since 1893, when it was brought
on the S. P. tracks from the Mid
winter Fair at San Francisco, the old
engine has been hidden away in a
wooden shack to the rear of the
museum.
New Marine Laboratory
At Pacific (Slrove.
A new reinforced concrete marine
laboratory building will take the place
of the present wooden structure used
by Stanford summer biological classes
at Pacific Grove, as a result of an
appropriation by the University trus
tees. The new building will be lo
cated on a new site, at China Point,
a much better location than the pres
ent one, the University having effected
an exchange with the Pacific Improve
ment Company of its present acre plot
for ten acres on China Point.
C. H. Gilbert, professor of Zoology,
and F. M. McFarland, profesor of His
tology, are preparing plans for the ar
rangement of the new laboratory
structure.

Describes Bodily Effects
Of Alcohol.
"Bodily Effects of Alcohol" was the
subject of the lecture yesterday after
noon by Professor E. G. Martin of the
Physiology department, before the
class in Education B, "Social Aspects
of the Liquor Problem."
Professor Martin exploded many of
the theories now prevalent concerning
the effects of alcohol on the body,
among them the belief that alcohol
has any direct chemical action on the
digestive system or the heart.
