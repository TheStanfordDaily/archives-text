A dime fund has been started to pur
chase a carving table for the Union.
This table, similar to those on ex
hibition at Larkin's, will contain the
carved initials of Stanford genera
tions present and future. When one
is used up, it will be hung on the
Union walls, and another bought to
take its place.
