# Chappie Offers New Schedule of Courses
## Says Faculty Makes "Alluring Misrepresentations" to Mislead Student 
### 
Chappie is due! Early Monday he
stalks over the campus with a riotous
tread, his grin broader than ever be
fore. Cheerfully unconcerned over
frosty mornings, honor points and like
trifles, he is ready to dispense Chap
arralistic wit with characteristic
abandon.
Chappie Resolves.
With the new year Chappie feels
constrained to become the chaperone
for some resolutions which are drawn
from an abundance of experience of
life spent on the farm, and which are
safe and sane, and are guaranteed to
prevent Chappie the embarrassment of
backing down as the year wears
away.
"Catalogue of Courses."
Tender sympathies for the students,
so-called by courtesy of the faculty,
and firm convictions that flunks are
directly attributable to "alluring mis
representations" in the schedule of
courses as published by the Univer
sity, prompts Chappie to offer for ap
proval a "Catalogue of Courses,"
which he candidly admits is biased in
favor of the student. He also has
some tender words written "in memor
iam" to those no longer presentâ€”mis
guided victims of the faculty axe.
Two humorous soliloquies which
Monday's Chaparral will offer are the
respective diaries of "Hire A. Hall,"
and "Sam Pepys, Stanford '17." Other
delectable morsels of wit include a
bona fide version of Chappie's new
party song, concocted in an evil
moment by Sam Briggs. Still other
grin-provoking features are the full
page pictorial creations of Jimmie
Wallace and Ruth Taylor, not for
getting Dave Smith's "Woman In the
Case."
