## 
### 
Tryouts for the 1918 Junior Opera,
to be staged March 29, will be held in
ten days. Several manuscripts are
already being considered by the com
mittee, but if there are any unfinished
scores which have not been reported,
the committee must have them within
a few days or they cannot be consid
ered. Manuscripts without scores,
also will be received by the commit
tee.

operas, and was also one of the co
authors of last year's production.

shows. The operas of 1911 and 1912,
two llam's Head shows, and the 1913

him.
The committee for this year's show
is R. R. Coleman, '18, chairman; Miss
