# Low Scholarship Commented on by President Wilbur
## 
### 
Scholarship, student government,
| the undemocratic tendency at Stan
ford, fraternities, athletics, and the
junior college idea, are the most im
! portant subjects dealt with in the an
! nual report of President Ray Lyman
! Wilbur to the board of trustees of the
| University, which has just been is
sued from the press.
"Scholarship Falls Off."
"It is to be regretted that the gen
eral improvement in scholarship noted
in the last two President's reports
does not appear in the results of the
year 1915-16," says Dr. Wilbur in his
report. "On the contrary there has
been a distinct falling off in scholar
ship. For men, failures have in-
J creased from 13 per cent to 16 per
cent; for women, from .5 to 2.5 per
cent.
"Student self-government at Stan
ford has now completed its fourth
year and has in a sense passed the
experimental stage. It has not by any
means solved all the problems which
confront it, but there has been steady
progress toward effective control. The
faculty is disposed to give the time
necessary to develop the machinery
of self-government; the outcome rests
entirely with the students them
selves.
"Among the student body as a whole
there is apparent a tendency toward
undemocratic ideals, as shown by
waste of time and excessive expendi
tures in various ways. The Found
ers of Stanford University had very
definite and wholesome ideas on the
subject of democracy which should
not be lost sight of.
Fraternity Problem.
"Fraternities can be of great value
in the life of the Universitly, if con
trolled by men of high ideals and
broad democratic tendencies. The low
standard of fraternity scholarship dis
closed by the statistics suggests that
these organizations are not meeting
as they should their obligations to the
University community.
"One source of the undemocratic
tendencies of fraternities lies in the
fact that beginning students who take
up their residence in the chapter
house miss entirely that broader con
tact with the student body which life
in the dormitories would insure."
General participation ni athletics,
President Wilbur declares, has been
extended by the change in the recita
tion and hour schedule by which
classes begin at 8 and close at 4:05,
leaving free hours at the end of the
afternoon.
"It is largely because of this and
of the fine wholesome democracy of
the football field that Stanford Uni
versity has remained and will remain
loyal to the rugby game," he says.
President Wilbur devotes consider
able attention to the development of
junior colleges in California, which he
calls the most far-reaching change in
the educational system of the state, !
and which he prophesies will do much
toward lifting the status of California
in education, not only in secondary
education, but in the grade of univer- !
sity work.
Palo Alto's now union high school,'
according to the report, "will insure
to the University community the best
possible facilities for secondary edu
cation and the expected expansion of
the school into a six-year high school
or junior college will eventually assist
in affording relief to the over-crowded
elementary classes of the various de
partments of the University."

Palo Alto's now union high school,'
according to the report, "will insure
to the University community the best
possible facilities for secondary edu
cation and the expected expansion of
the school into a six-year high school
or junior college will eventually assist
in affording relief to the over-crowded
elementary classes of the various de
partments of the University."
Scholarship, student government,
| the undemocratic tendency at Stan
ford, fraternities, athletics, and the
junior college idea, are the most im
! portant subjects dealt with in the an
! nual report of President Ray Lyman
! Wilbur to the board of trustees of the
| University, which has just been is
sued from the press.
"Scholarship Falls Off."
"It is to be regretted that the gen
eral improvement in scholarship noted
in the last two President's reports
does not appear in the results of the
year 1915-16," says Dr. Wilbur in his
report. "On the contrary there has
been a distinct falling off in scholar
ship. For men, failures have in-
J creased from 13 per cent to 16 per
cent; for women, from .5 to 2.5 per
cent.
"Student self-government at Stan
ford has now completed its fourth
year and has in a sense passed the
experimental stage. It has not by any
means solved all the problems which
confront it, but there has been steady
progress toward effective control. The
faculty is disposed to give the time
necessary to develop the machinery
of self-government; the outcome rests
entirely with the students them
selves.
"Among the student body as a whole
there is apparent a tendency toward
undemocratic ideals, as shown by
waste of time and excessive expendi
tures in various ways. The Found
ers of Stanford University had very
definite and wholesome ideas on the
subject of democracy which should
not be lost sight of.
Fraternity Problem.
"Fraternities can be of great value
in the life of the Universitly, if con
trolled by men of high ideals and
broad democratic tendencies. The low
standard of fraternity scholarship dis
closed by the statistics suggests that
these organizations are not meeting
as they should their obligations to the
University community.
"One source of the undemocratic
tendencies of fraternities lies in the
fact that beginning students who take
up their residence in the chapter
house miss entirely that broader con
tact with the student body which life
in the dormitories would insure."
General participation ni athletics,
President Wilbur declares, has been
extended by the change in the recita
tion and hour schedule by which
classes begin at 8 and close at 4:05,
leaving free hours at the end of the
afternoon.
"It is largely because of this and
of the fine wholesome democracy of
the football field that Stanford Uni
versity has remained and will remain
loyal to the rugby game," he says.
President Wilbur devotes consider
able attention to the development of
junior colleges in California, which he
calls the most far-reaching change in
the educational system of the state, !
and which he prophesies will do much
toward lifting the status of California
in education, not only in secondary
education, but in the grade of univer- !
sity work.
