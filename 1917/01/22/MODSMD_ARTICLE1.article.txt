# INITIAL GAME CAPTURED BY BALL TOSSERS
## HOME RUN FEATURES Cardinal Nine Takes Fast 3 to 2 Struggle From Staffords College Stars 
### 
STANFORD varsity started tlie 1917
baseball season with Hying colors,
when they won a close and hard
fought game Saturday afternoon from
"Wabbles" Stafford's College All-
Stars. After nine innings of speedy
and excellent baseball, the final score
stood 3 to 2, with the Cardinal tossers
on the long end.
Good weather prevailed and a large
crowd turned out, considering that the
contest was the initial one of the sea
son. Much interest was manifested
in the lineup as many new faces
were on the diamond, at least for var
sity competition. The showing of the
new material was a revelation to the
fans, the nine displaying more pep
than Stanford teams have exhibited
for a number of years.
Stafford's Clul) Fairly Strong.
Stafford had a fairly good club to
oppose the locals. His battery was
weak, but he had several stars in his
aggregation, and showed the diamond
followers some clever baseball. Billy
Orr is always a favorite at Stanford,
and much interest was shown in the
work of "Swede" Risberg, who goes to
the Chicago White Sox next season to
try to displace Zeb Terry from the
Ilose lineup.
Ken Lilly was the star of the con
test, fielding his position well, and
scoring two runs, one of which was a
homer on one of the longest hits ever
seen 011 the Stanford diamond.
Sbriver hit and fielded in good form,
as did several other members of the
varsity. Maker and Risberg were the
best of the visitors.
Stanford Uses Three Pitchers.
Iloever, Mattel and Draper each
twirled three innings, and worked
equally well. The two runs of the
College All-Stars were the result of
flukes, more than anything else, and
the pitchers can be credited with a
six-hit game. An unusual feature for
so early in the season was the fact
that not a single batter was walked
by a Cardinal moundsman. Two
Stanford players received free trans
portation to the first sack, and seven
struck out.
Hayes Not in Lineup.
Captain "Doc" Hayes did not get
into the game, and -his place at first
base was filled by Mitchell. Hayes is
still a little shaky 011 his legs, and is
waiting for the warmer weather.
