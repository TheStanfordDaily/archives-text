# Pick Carnot Team to Meet California
## Driscoll, Holland, McClintock and Williams Selected to Represent Stanford 
### 
Tryouts for the Carnot debating
team, which will meet the University
of California on April 20, were held
last Friday afternoon in the Little
Theater, and resulted in J. U. Dris
coll, '18, and J. C. Holland, '17, and
M. C. McClintock, '18, being chosen
by the judges as the men to uphold
Stanford, with E. E. Williams, '17, as
alternate.
"Reconstruction in France After the
Present War," is the general subject
of the discussion, but as the Carnot is
an extemporaneous debate, the specific
subject for the tryouts was not given
out until two hours previous to the
contest.
Held the night before the intercol
legiate track meet with California, the
Carnot should draw a large crowd, to
witness the biggest of all forensic
battles with California.
