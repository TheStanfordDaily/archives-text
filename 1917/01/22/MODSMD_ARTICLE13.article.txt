Motion pictures of war scenes in
Belgium will accompany the lecture
to lie given tonight in the Little The
ater by Dr. A. Van Hecke of Louvain
at S o'clock. Dr. Van Hecke was pro
fessor of Engineering at the Univer
sity of Louvain and was in that city
at the time of its bombardment by the
German forces in 1911.
The housing of the Belgian refu
gees in Holland is the special work
of Dr. Van Hecke at this time, and it
is in the interest of this cause that he
is now touring this country. Dr.
Van Hecke is a speaker of great
vigor, and his lecture will bring out
some unusually intimate pictures of
the war in Belgium.
