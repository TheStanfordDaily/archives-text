# Make It Unanimous Cry of Campaigners
## Vote on $200,000 Union High School Building Bonds Next Saturday 
### 
"Make it Unanimous" is the cam
paign cry of the Palo Alto-Mayfield-
Stanford high school board in the
election, next Saturday, on the pro
posed $200,000 bond issue for a new
high school. Sentiment is so heartily
in favor of the new school, which will
serve the campus and Mayfield, that
it is not a question of winning but
of making it unaimous.
There are 400 votes registered on
the campus, everyone who registered
for the last presidential election being
eligible to vote on this question. The
poll will be in the now campus gram
mar school. S. It. Townley, associate
professor of Applied Mathematics at
Stanford, and member of the Palo
Alio high school board, wants the
campus to do its part in the cam
paign, which will mean in the next
few years a junior college in Palo
Alto, and better athletic facilities for
(ho Palo Alio boys.
The University has made an offer of
a !)!) year lease of HO acres at the nom
inal rental of $1 per acre per year,
on the tract just south of Embarca
dero road, between the highway and
the Southern Pacific tracks.
