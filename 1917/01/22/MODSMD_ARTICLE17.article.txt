# A 						PARADOX
## 
### 
Consistency Is a virtue almost, if
not quite, equal to patience. To per
sist in marking plus and minus in the
teeth of a scheme which depends on
a closer grading, is highly inconsist
ent and equally unvirtuous. The
honor point system is an incentive to
do high grade work, but where grades
are not given, that incentive is lack
ing, for an "A" student gets no more
credit in the registrar's office than
one who barely passes. True, he
probably absorbs more knowledge
and secures a greater benefit from
the work done, but if that were the
basis of credit, why should there be
an honor point system, or, indeed, any
comparative marking whatever?
We have often heard people say,
' There's a course I would like to
take, but I need honor points, and
the instructor marks plus and minus."
Our departmental requirements leave
little enough time for elective sub
jects without adding any further re
striction. Is it not unjust that a stu
dent should be obliged to pass up a
a good course for such a reason?
Realizing this to be true, the ad
ministration has recommended com
parative grading for all courses given
in the University. Although compli
ance may be a slight burden on some
instructors, it hardly seems that the
inconvenience would outweigh the
necessity. The recommendation is a
good one, and we hope it will be taken
to heart.
