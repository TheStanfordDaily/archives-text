day, and the handicaps were an
nounced by swimming coach Brand
sten this noon. The race is to swim
three minutes every day, with a daily
handicap of the difference between
their record and the record of the
fastest man.

man, having negotiated 224 yards in
a three minute trial. Freshmen are
coming strong and there are nine of
