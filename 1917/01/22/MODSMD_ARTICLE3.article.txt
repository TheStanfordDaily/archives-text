# Major Bugge .. .Causes Sorrow. ... in Sorority
## 
### 
A new test for "On-the-boat-edness"
has been devised by the sorority sis
ters. They try it on possible "rush
ees." Now the first question that is
popped at some unlucky "proj" is:
"How do you pronounce b-u-double
g-e-?" If the pronunciation is one
way, the "prep" is pledged, if she
makes a blunder, she is shown the
door. It all had its origin in an ar
gument the other night that waxed
hot and heavy long into the night
hours.
"I til you, you say it just like the
old horse and 'buggy.' That's the sen
sible way," begins one girl.
"Sensible nothing, that's the height
of nonsense. You pronounce it
'b—double o—g,' like that river over in
Europe, where they're always fight
ing."
13y actual count there were eleven
different ways advanced for the pro
nunciation of the name of the head of
the Stanford department of military
instruction.
The Daily Palo Alto's war corre
spondent claims the disputed name is
pronounced as if it were spelled
"b—double o-ga," with the accent on
the last syllable. And he speaks with
the weight of authority.
