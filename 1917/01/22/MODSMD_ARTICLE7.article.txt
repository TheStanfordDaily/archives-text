# STANFORD IS VICTOR OVER PACIFIC FIVE
## WINS BY 44-20 SCORE First League Game Shows Var sity to be in Good Shape for Season Schedule 
### 
VICTORY accompanied the Stanford
basketball team in its first league
game of the season, Saturday
night, against the strong College of
the Pacific team, on the latter's floor,
by a 44 to 20 score.
Eight men were taken to San Jose
and all got into the game before the
finish. Roney, by his sensational bas
ket shooting, was the star of the var
sity, being responsible for eighteen of
the Cardinal points. Roney was shoot
ing from all angles, anc l seemed un
able to miss the basket. Bonney was
second among Stanford scorers, an
nexing fourteen points. The team
as a whole showed up well, the work
of the guards proving particularly ef
fective in holding down the Pacific
five.
The Stanford team led throughout
the game, their lead never being in
danger throughout the game. The
score at the end of the first half was
26 to 4.
This game shows the varsity to be
in good shape for the heavy schedule
arranged this year. The first real
test will come next Saturday, when
Santa Clara is the opponent at Santa
Clara. While the College of the Pa
cific held Santa Clara to a close
score a week ago, Santa Clara did not
have its first players in the game,
and so a comparison can hardly be
drawn through these games.
The box score follows:
College of the Pacific. Goals. Fouls.
