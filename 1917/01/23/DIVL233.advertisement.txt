Balanced—tliat is what
makes Fatima's blend conu
112 jrtable, both while you're
smoking and afterward, too.
The milder tobaccos in
this Turkish blend are so
well balanced with the
richer, fuilcr-llavored leaves
as to entirely off-set all "oily
heaviness"—the cause of
discomfort in so many other
cigarettes.
And this very blending
which makes Fatimas so com
fortable (and therefore so
sensible) is also just what
imparts that unusually good
Fatima taste.
But even so, you alone can
decide whether or not you
like Fatimas. That's easy to
fictile — try them.
