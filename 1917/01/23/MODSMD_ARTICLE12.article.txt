# TENNIS PLAYERS START SPRING PRACTICE
## PLAY U. C. APRIL 20-21 National Stars Will Compete Here in Series of Exhibition Matches 
### 
TENNIS activities will begin this
week, when all candidates for
varsity and freshman teams sign
up with captain Allyn Barber, '18, at
the Zeta Psi house. Regular work
outs for the men will begin as soon
as enough racquet wielders have
handed in their names to start prac
tice.
California and Stanford meet in the
annual matches on April 20 and 21,
when games between both varsity and
fresbmen teams will be played. The
prospects for victories in these con
tests are good. Johns, Barber and
Wolford of the last year's teams, are
back, and out for work. Hahn, the
only winner in the intercollegiate
matches last year, is not eligible, and
his loss will be keenly felt, but sev
eral men from the eight-man team in
the Northern California Tennis league
last year, are registered, and should
show well for the big team.
Freshmen Look Good.
Some of the strongest players in
high school circles in the west are
out for the freshman team . Burrill,
a prep champion from the
Northwest, McCabe, from the south
ern part of the state, and Barry, high
school champion of Los Angeles, will
be the men around when the 1920 team
will be built. Several other good
players showed up in the novice tour
nament last fall and will put up a
hard fight for places on the squad.
Tnterclass and interfraternity games
will be run off under the supervision of
captain Barber in about a month. A
regular schedule for all the teams in
the series will be drawn up and all
the games completed before the inter
collegiate matches in April.
To (Site Exhibition.
In order to give candidates for the
teams a chance to get some pointers
on tennis, captain Barber has ar
ranged with some of the biggest play
ers of the country to give exhibition
matches at Stanford. Johnston, rank
ed second by the tennis commission,
and Strachan, a well-known coast
player, will both be brought down.
In addition to the teams to com
pete against California, an eight-man
team will be selected to play in the
Northern California Tennis league,
composed of representatives from the
bay district. Games are played every
Sunday, and all men have a chance to
show what they can do against some
good players.
Captain Barber is anxious that every
man who plans on trying for any
team report to him at once.
