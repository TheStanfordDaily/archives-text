# UNION HIGH SCHOOL
## 
### 
Registration of some four hundred
voters on the Stanford campus, the
greatest total in the history of the
University, makes the bond election
for a union high school, which is to
be held January 27, a matter of some
interest here, and gives us an oppor
tunity to help in a good cause. What
the voters of Stanford do may mean
success or failure for a worthy pro
jectâ€”for that this building is such
cannot be doubted.
Aside from all selfish motives,
Stanford people should gladly give
their support, for high school facili
ties in the district are sadly lacking,
and a new building will mean much
to the Mayfield and Palo Alto com
munities. However, we need not look
in vain for some benefit to us as a
University.
Plans for the new high school pro
vide for an athletic field and equip
ment complete in every detail. The
present poor facilities for training in
sports will give place to a modern
plant, which should do much toward
developing future Stanford athletes.
We have had and still have athletes
of no mean ability from Palo Alto
and Mayfield. If coming generations
are better and more universally
trained, may we not expect, still more
satisfying results?
It is also hoped that a junior col
lege may be added to the high school
in time. This will provide a place
for the overflow from the University,
and for those who are unable to en
ter here due to deficiency in scholar
ship. Those who make good there
will no doubt eventually find their
way to Stanford, which they probably
would not do if they went to another
University.
All those who voted in the presi
dential election last fall may vote
next Saturday on the campus. Let us
use our franchise to help in a good
cause.
