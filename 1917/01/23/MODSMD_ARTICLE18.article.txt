New players have made the Stan
ford varsity baseball team a formid
able looking aggregation this season.
The main reason for defeats in the
last few years and for a decided lack
of pep on the part of the varsity men,
has been the lack of competition for
positions. This year, matters are dif
ferent. There are at least two men
for every one of the nine berths, and
the coach is going to give every can
didate a fair chance. Prospects loom
bright for a winning baseball team.

Captain "Doc" Hayes looks better
every day. He is hardly as spry as
he was last season, but he will soon
be in excellent playing condition.
Mitchell will probably be sent to the
outfield, unless Hayes attempts some
other position.

With Lander and E. Mitchell both
out of varsity competition on account
of poor scholarship, the catching de
partment is very weak. Campbell
held down the job behind the log last
Saturday, and made a good showing.
He may be able to fill Dent's shoes,
but this is doubtful. Stevens or Hayes
may be forced to don the mask to
save the situation.

Rumor has it that Art Wilcox is a
catcher of considerable ability. If
this is the case, he can he easily used
on the Cardinal varsity.

The Peanut league is having hard
sailing this year. The men are not
turning out like they have in the past.
This is unfortunate, as coach Wilson
was planning 011 using this league as
a farming ground for varsity and
freshman aspirants. Last season, two
men who made their varsity letter,
were brought in from the Peanut
league. It is hoped that four full
teams and substitutes will he organ
ized in the outside squad. There are
cups up for hatting and fielding hon
ors, and the league schedule is al
ready under way.

Word comes from San Francisco
that Harry Wolverton of the San
Francisco Coast league baseball team
is going to give "Babe" Dent an op
portunity this coming season. Stan
ford fans would like to see the for
mer catcher and skipper of the var
sity make good with the Seals.

Hard practice is being engaged in
by both the varsity and freshmen
nines every night. This afternoon the
two teams will line up against each
other for a practice game. The fresh
men have a strong team, Morse and
Leifer doing the twirling, Joerg
catching, Pike holding down first
base, Hunter at second, Lorison at
third, Galloway at short, and Abrams,
Way land, Cass, Noyes and Howes in
the outfield. The freshmen play their
first game this week.
