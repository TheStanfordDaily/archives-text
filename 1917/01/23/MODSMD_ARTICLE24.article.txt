# Willie Ritchie Comes to Stanford Today
## 
### 
Willie Ritchie, lightweight champion
of America, and former champion of
the world, will be a visitor on the
campus today, and will perhaps give
an exhibition in the evening. He
comes as the guest of Bob Lytle, '17,
who met Ritchie in a boxing exhibition
at the Monterey training camp last
summer.
Moving pictures of the Ritchie-Lytle
bout were shown to a few friends and
onlookers last night. The reel also
shows the former lightweight cham
pion in characteristic poses and in
the horseplay about the camp. The
serious work of drilling and an aero
plane flight by Ritchie completed the
noteworthy features of the picture.
