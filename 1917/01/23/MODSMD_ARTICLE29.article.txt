Tryouts for the team to represent
Euphronia in the debate with Nestoria,

'19. The debate between Euphronia
and Nestoria is scheduled for early
next month, and the question will be:
"Resolved, That Stanford Should Abol

Euphronia has some very novel pro

next Monday evening, January 29, the
society will hold an open senate meet
ing. The Abolition of the Pork Bar
rel amendment, which proposes to
give the president veto power over
riders, will be discussed. Each mem
ber will act as a senator from some
state and a lively discussion is as
sured. The meeting is open to the
public, and all those interested are
cordially invited.
