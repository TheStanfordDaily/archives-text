# Sophomore Bill Journeys Four Thousand Miles
## 
### 
This is the tale of a wandering let
ter, or rather a plebian bill, which
started on November 27, from . the
grocery store of Fuller & Company,
in Palo Alto, and strolled into The
Daily Palo Alto office this morning,
after a trip of over 4000 miles, still
looking for Mr. C. E. Hobbs, '19, on
account of $2.G0 due the company by
the class of 1919.
.Mailed in November.
The strange wanderer first appeared
in the Stanford postoffice, late in No
vember, but the postmaster, evidently
thinking that Fuller & Company were
not getting their two cents worth of
travel, decided that it should go to
Chicago to visit Mr. Carl L. Hubbs, a
former member of the class of '19.
Sightseeing around the different Chi
cago postoffices occupied a good deal
of time, until Hubbs was finally dis
covered.
lliil>l>s Returns Bill.
Hubbs, with the characteristic Stan
ford horror of bills, sent the bill in a
fresh envelope to Mr. R. E. Widikind,
'19, at Encina. Someone kindly re
lieved Widikind of the bill, and after
a variety of experiences, it finally ar
rived at this office. It is suggested
that a delegation of sophomores call
and receive with due ceremony this
treasured bill, which traveled over
4000 miles and is now the same dis
tance from its destination as it was
six weeks ago.
