# Indoor Soccerites to Meet Barbarians
## 
### 
Stanford and the Barbarians of San
Francisco will play the first game of
the newly organized Indoor Soccer
league, Wednesday night in Encina
gymnasium, at 8:30. Twelve teams
will play here this spring in the
league, which means a game each
week for the Cardinal.
The Indoor Soccer league is an
outgrowth of the California Football
Soccer league, of which Stanford was
a member last fall. All the teams
that were entered then have organ
ized five man squads, and some strong
competition can be expected.
The Barbarians who will play here
tomorrow are Gore, Paice, Sharp,
Hudson and Robertson. Stanford will
be represented by Sherwin, Fabling,
Denny, Taylor and McClung.
The contest will be in two halves
of fifteen minutes each, with a ten
minute interval between.
