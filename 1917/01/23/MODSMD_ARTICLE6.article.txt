# VARSITY TO PLAY AGNEWS TEAM TOMORROW
## GAME AT STANFORD Hospital Nine Expected to Give Coach Wilson's Players Strong Competition 
### 
STANFORD meets the Agnews Hos
pital baseball team tomorrow af
ternoon in the first game of a
series of games. The contest will be
staged on the Cardinal diamond, um
pire Nealon calling the game at 4:15.
Seven innings only will be played, as
darkness sets in before nine frames
can be tucked away. Graduate man
ager 13ehrens announces that 25 cents
will be charged at the gate to all
those without season tickets.
Agnews will bring a strong club to
oppose the varsity. Every year the
hospital nine is one of the strongest
in semi-professional circles. Their
lineup includes Lamarra, Lackey, Mac-
Gregor, Esola, Bartlett, Koehner and
Lynn Several other men of ability
will play with the visitors, but the
above tossers were with the team
when in the games against Stanford
last year.
Wilson Commences Lineups.
Coach Wilson announces that the
Cardinals will take the diamond in the
same order that they did on Satur
day, with perhaps one or two excep
tions that he has not decided upon
as yet. At any rate, all of the sub
stitutes now on the varsity roster will
get into the contest.
The pitcher has not been selected,
but Draper will probably do the heav
ing. He worked well against the Ag
news nine last year, and stands an
excellent chance of tossing a win over
them tomorrow.
With Hoever, Mattei, Draper, Camp
bell, Wilcox, Hayes, Mitchell, Cowan,
Braden, Stevens, Shriver, Reagon,
Bihlman, Wilkins, Dickey, Lilly and
Noonan to choose a team from, coach
Wilson should not find it difficult to
to select a nine that will come out on
the long end of the score in the ma
jority of the practice games.
