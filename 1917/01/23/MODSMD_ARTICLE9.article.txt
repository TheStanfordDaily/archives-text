ized dress for the women who do not
wish to be bothered by the constantly
changing fashions of the day.

of design of the University of Mis
souri, addressed the club. She gave
a report on the dress convention
which met in Chicago, where she pre
sented the ideal dress now being u6ed
by some of the women of the Uni
versity of Missouri. The convention
was interested in her views and will
endeavor to perpetuate the hygienic,
loose lines of the styles now existant.
Miss Ronzone urged the women of
Stanford to try their dress, which is
made in the schools, and consists of
a rather short skirt and a belted

two perpetual styles, one for street
and one for evening wear.
