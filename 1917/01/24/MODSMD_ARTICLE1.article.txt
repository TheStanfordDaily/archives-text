## FINAL VOTE FRIDAY E.R. Ames and G.K. Howard Receive Highest Vote; Remain in Running

NO ELECTION was the result of the
contest for Senior class president
held on the quad today. E. R.
Ames and G. K. Howard received the
highest number of votes out of the
total and these two candidates will be
voted on Friday on the quad.
Contest Is Close.
The contest between all the candi
dates was close, and Ames and How
ard were the high men by only a small
majority. A total vote of 139 was
cast at the polls today and since no
candidate received a large number of
votes a record vote is expected for
the election Friday.

But one candidate was in the run
ning for each of the other class of
fices, resulting in the election of G.
H. Bihlman for the position of vice
president; Helen Greening, secretary,
and H. E. Waite, treasurer, on a
white ballot.
