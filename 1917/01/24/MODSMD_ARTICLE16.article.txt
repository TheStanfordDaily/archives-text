# HAMMER PLUS
## 
### 
Knocking is second nature with
most of us. We learn to knock as
naturally as we walk, and with less
effort; nor are we respecters of place
or person. The hammer is a good
weapon, too, as far as it goes, but it
should never be used alone. All of
which is apropos of the situation in
the Stanford Union.
Everyone feels that the Union has,
in a sense, failed to live up to the
expectations of those who worked
hard that it might become a reality.
If he hasn't felt it himself, he has
no doubt got the idea from some one
else. We have all talked it over,
some with a what's-it-to-me attitude,
and others with a sincere desire to
find a solution for the problem. De
structive criticism alone breeds only
dissatisfaction. It does no good to
tear down a structure unless we have
somthing better to put up in its place.
Tomorrow evening will be given at
the Union the first of a series of Uni
versity smokers, which, it is hoped,
will do something to make the club
more of a center of interest. On this
occasion, men who are not members
of the Union have been asked to at
tend, and, if possible, give some sug
gestions as to how the Union can be
improved. This call is issued in good
faith, and should be received in like
manner. There is a place for such
an institution on the Stanford cam
pus, and it is up to us to make it a
success.
