# Fifty Books a Week Received by Library
## 
### 
Every Monday finds approximately
fifty more books in Stanford's library.
Several old and rare books of value
have been added this week. Fore
most among these is "The Memoirs of
the Life and Character of the late
Rev. George Whitefleld," a gift of the
Stanford Estate. This is a biography,
compiled by the Rev. John Gillies and
published in Boston in 1813. Two
other old volumes of interest, "The
Biography of American Military and
Naval Heroes," by Thomas Wilson of
Philadelphia, claim attention because
of the early date of publication, 1817,
and because of the contemporaneous
side-lights they give the reader of
familiar American heroes. Another
gift of the Stanford Estate is a vol
ume entitled "East of the Jordan."
This bears on the fly leaf, written in
pencil, the name of Jane L. Stanford.
