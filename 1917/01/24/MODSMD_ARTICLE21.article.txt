E PLURIHUS FOXEM.
Scenery—A Class in Ancient Cul
ture of Deep-Sen Animals, including
Lobsters and Crubs. Very deep stuff.
Enter a Prof, with a peeve 011. lie
looks at his fifty victims.
Prof. —The registrar's office wants
absences reported daily. I don't know
what they want to do with them, but
we'll have to have some now and
then. I'll call the roll.
Picks up registration cards:
Prof. —Mr. Albatross.
Deep silence.
Prof. —Mr. Fish.
Fish —Here.
Prof. —Miss Trout.
M. T.—Here.
Prof —Mr. Bass.
Still deeper silence.
Prof. —Mr. Shark.
Not a ripple in the silence.
Prof. —I guess that's enough ab
sences for today. We'll go on with
the lecture.
As he puts the rest of the cards
away, the depths of thought are dis
turbed with deep laughter.
Moral —There is none—this is an
immoral sance box.
