# Peach Growers Need New Name for Fruit That Has Been Peeled
## 
### 
An opportunity to secure a prize of
$100 is offered by the California
Peach Growers Company, according
to announcement received, for the
best name submitted before February
1, for the new peeled peach which
they are putting 011 the market. The
term "peeled" is not a proper one, in
view of the fact that only 80 per cent
of the skin is removed in the mechan
ical peeling process. The new word
will become a trade name, and should
not only involve the peeled peach
idea, but should connect the article
with California, thus giving the com
pany the advertising value of Cali
fornia sunshine. All communications
should be addressed to the Contest
Department, California Peach Grow
ers, Fresno, Cal.
