# Stanford Five to Meet Santa Clara Quintet Saturday
## 
### 
Stanford's basketball team faces one
of its strongest opponents on this
year's schedule, Saturday night, when
it plays the formidable Santa Clara
team on the latter's court at Santa
Clara.
While coach Wilson has not definite
ly picked the team which will start
against Santa Clara, the lineup will
probably be much the same as that
which started against the College of
the Pacific latst Saturday night. The
varsity, with its excellent substitute
material, is rapidly rounding into
shape, and should give Santa Clara an
awful hunt in the first game of the
series between the two universites.
