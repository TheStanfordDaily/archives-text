## NINE APPEARS STRONG Coach Wilson Will Probably Give All Ball Tossers Chance to Show Ability 
### 
STANFORD freshmen ball players
will have their first opportunity to
display their national pastime
ability tomorrow afternoon, when they
hook up with the Palo Alto high
school aggregation. The game will
be played at 4:30, either on the var
sity of auxiliary diamond. As it is
the first appearance of the 1920 nine,
(he Cardinal fans are expected to turn
out in large numbers. Graduate man
ager Behrens announces that no ad
mission will be charged, even though
the contest be staged on the varsity
lot.
Lineup Xot Definite.
The freshmen were put through a
stiff practice last night by coach Rus
nel Wilson and captain "Doc" Hayes.
The squad has been selected, but no
definite lineup has been announced by
the coach. However, the following
men will undoubtedly get into the
game before the seven innings are
over. Joerg and Sparling behind the
log, Leifer and Morse in the box, Pike
on first, Hunter at second, Lorison
and Abrahms at tliird, and Galloway
completing the infield at shortstop.
The flychasers who will start the
game are probably Wayland, Cass and
Howes, with Noyes, Laugenour and
Knox ready to step in at the call of
the coach. This gives the freshmen a
strong delegation. Leifer has been
very successful in the south, while
Morse twirled good baseball for Palo
Alto high school. Joerg is a clever
catcher, and seems to be as good on
the ball diamond as he was 011 the
football lield. Pike and Galloway are
the best of the freslimen players.
They have both had a great deal of
expereience and are putting up an
excellent brand of the game in prac
tice. Wayland and Cass look excep
tionally good in the outfield.
Bua])]Â»y Glume Expected.
Palo Alto high school generally has
a good baseball team, and gave the
Stanford freshmen strong competition
last season. They have had little op
portunity to develop a classy squad
this year as the basketball season
has been in full swing, but it is ex
pected that they will give the fresh
men a hard game.
The local fans are anxious to see
the freshmen work out, as the games
with the University of California
freshmen attract much attention.
From now on the freshmen will play
one and sometimes two games a week
with outside teams.
