# German War Tactics Shown in New Light
## Sidney Coryn Says Paris Not Real Objective of the Kaiser 
### 
Putting an interpretation entirely
different from the one generally ac
cepted on the movements of the Ger
man armies during the first weeks of
the war in Europe, Sidney Coryn, as
sociate editor of the "San Francisco
Argonaut," told an audience in the
Little Theater last night that at no
time in the present war had Paris
been the objective of a German
! "drive." Mr. Coryn pointed out that
!
the so-called "drive" of the German
war machine upon the French capital
was nothing more than an orderly re
treat of the Allied armies, who had
by that time taken the initiative from
the invaders.
"The object of the Germans in in
vading Belgium," Mr. Coryn said,
"was not to prepare for this great
[dash upon Paris, for they could have
chosen a much easier and shorter
route. The German commanders
hoped to draw the French armies into
Belgium, and there tight the first and
last battle of the war. When Joffre
refused to step into the trap set for
him, the Germans had to carry the
war into France; but as soon as they
crossed the border from Belgium into
that country, they were irretrievably
and hopelessly beaten, and they
knew it."
