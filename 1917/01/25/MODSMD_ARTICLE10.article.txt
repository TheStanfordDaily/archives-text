game.
Saturday will be "Cliff Ireland
Day" at Stanford, according to plans
that Graduate Manager Behrens,
Coach Wilson, Manager Sheehan and
Baseball Captain "Doc" Hayes are
now working out. The Cardinal var
sity ball tossers will meet the Swain
& Sheehan's All-Star aggregation, and
Cliff Ireland is scheduled to appear
on the diamond as manager and chief
utility player.
In-lsiml's Twenty-fifth Year.
This will be Ireland's twenty-fifth
year before Stanford baseball fans.
Last season he was awarded a gold
medal by the Associated Students,
and sat on the bench during the in
tercollegiate games with the Univer
sity of California, giving the nine
many pointers. He has made a name
for himself in the athletic world as
manager of Ireland's Independents.
Because of sickness he had to give up
the active management of a team and
any thought of playing.
Last year, Swain and Sheehan, both
former Coast League ball players,
took over Ireland's Independents, and
have attempted to bring the same kind
of major leaguers to Stanford that
always cavorted under the colors of
Cliff Ireland.
Strong Lineup Opposing.
Saturday's lineup that will oppose
the varsity is exceedingly strong.
Mails of the Brooklyn National League
club, and "Dutch" Reuther, last sea
son in the Northwestern League and
now with Oakland in the Coast League
team, will be the moundsmen. Al
Walters, the young New York Amer
ican League catcher, will be on the
reciving end. Louis Guisto, the
Cleveland American League fence
Imster, will play first base; Sammy
Bohne, recently sold to St. Louis
Americans by Spokane, will cover
second; Egan of the Boston Nation
als, will hold down the short patch,
and Sheehan will cavort around third.
In the outfield, Billy Orr, former
Stanford coach, Philadelphia Amer
ican Leaguer, and now Salt Lake
player; Risberg, former Vernon star,
who goes to .the White Sox, and Jus
tin Fitzgerald of the San Francisco
Seals, will chase the fly balls.
Every baseball fan in Stanford, and
all those who have been interested in
the good influence that Cliff Ireland
has had over college baseball, are ex
pected to turn out for Saturday's
game.
