# ENGLISH CLUB AND MASQUERS WILL GIVE PLAY
## DATE SET IS MARCH 2 John Galsworthy's "Justice" Is Selected by Combined Dramatic Clubs 
### 
JOHN GOLDWORTHY'S "Justice,"
one of the most eminently suc
cessful of modern plays, will be
given a Stanford presentation in the
Assembly hall on March 2, when Eng
lish Club and Masquers combine in
what will undoubtedly be the biggest
production of the year. John Barry
more starred in this play for over a
year and a half in New York, where
it proved to be the greatest sensation
the dramatic world had had for many
years.
Follows English Club Standard.
This will without doubt rival last
year's production of William Vaughn
Moody's "Great Divide," one of the
most successful plays ever produced
on the Stanford stage. It is follow
ing the precedent of the high stand
ards set by the English Club last
year. Not only is it a play of high
literary merit, but it combines with it
a dramatic effectiveness, produced
partly by the elaborate staging which
the play necessitates.
IMg Chance for Acting.
"Justice" is a play which brings
out graphically the human note
which redeems apparent immorality.
It shows a man in the grasp of a
mechanical Justice bent on his de
struction. The whole production is
one in which there is a chance for
unparalleled acting.
