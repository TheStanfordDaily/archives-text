# Varsity Defeated by State Hospital Nine
## 6 to 2 Win for Agnews Result From Ragged Playing by Cardinal Tossers 
### 
Playing lagged baseball, the Stan
ford varsity went down to defeat
before the fast Agnews State Hos
pital nine yesterday afternoon on
j the varsity diamond. The score at the
! end of seven innings stood 6 'to 2 in
favor of the visitors. The Agnews
club was a speedy combination and
by all dope should win over the Card
inal varsity, hut yesterday's game was
a disappointment to the local follow
ers. Much is expected of the Stanford
i team this season, and the fans hope
for the elimination of the type of na
tional pastime displayed here for the
past few years.
First Three Scoreless.
With Mattei working in the box, the
| first three innings sailed by with both
teams playing scoreless baseball. In
the fourth frame, the procession
started. On two singles, a sacrifice
hit and two errors, the opposing squad
put over three tallies. Stanford came
back in their half of the spasm and
counted once on a double, a passed
ball and a wild pitch.
I'llggcri Hall Played.
In the fifth inning, Agnews gathered
three more on two singles, a long
I r
triple and a had error. Farrell was
pitching, having supplanted Mattei on
the mound. In the next two frames
he worked well, and looks like he will
he a valuable addition to the staff of
twirlors. Stanford again scored in
this inning, Bihlman making the cir
cuit on a single, two wild heaves and
an infield out.
In the visitors' lineup were enough
j diamond satellites to put an average
college team to rout. Bliss, who did
the pitching, was the moundsman of
i the University of Santa Clara last sea
| son, and is slated for a trial in fast
| company. Murray, Allen and Con
nelly are Northwestern league play
ers of note, Esola is a State league
star, Lamarra goes to Vernon this
season, and Downey is now the prop
erty of Salt Lake. Murray looked to
he the best of the opposing ball toss
ers. His work behind the bat was ex
cellent and he hit the ball hard.
There were few stars on the local
lineup. Joe Braden connected with
one for a long triple, and Lilly pulled
a nice catch in deep center field.
Campbell looked better behind the log
and bids fair to make an excellent
catcher before the season is over.
Bill Burns, who handled the indica
tor, says that Campbell has the ideal
build for a catcher and possessed an
excellent throwing arm. If he can
stick a little heavier he will be a val
uable man on the Cardinal contingent.
