There are some horses that cannot
be driven to water, all adages to the
contrary notwithstanding. In fact
Quad Editor Wohlford's watering
trough for tryoutees is conspicuous
for its vacancy, since some of those
whom he succeeded in driving have
refused to drink. A few days ago
there appeared in this column an ap
peal for more men to try out for the
1919 Quad editorship. Now there are
fewer candidates than there were
then. Still we feel constrained to
risk a further depletion of the ranks
by adding another word for a system
which we believe to be a good one.
Unless more men try out for this
position, it seems to us that the plan
fails to accomplish its chief purpose
â€”that is to bring out the best ma
terial in the class without regard to
previous literary achievement in the
University, and to prevent an incom
petent man from getting the job
through politics. The present candi
dates are 110 doubt capable enough,
but they are not really trying out, be
cause they lack competition. Some
nominations must be made, and where
there are so few to choose from, it
seems like a gift.
There is still plenty of time for new
men, and for the sake of the system,
it is to be hoped that the call is
heeded.
