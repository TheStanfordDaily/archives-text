# Double Plays

### 
Few people were on hand yesterday
for the first mid-week baseball game
of the season. The contest was rag
ged, but there were many features
that made it well worth while for
Stanford fans.

Agnews has an especially fast club
this year. The hospital team is al
ways good, but it has never had the
classy players that are now on the
roster.
*****
The Agnews team has registered
three straight wins over the Univer
sity of Santa Clara baseball team this
season. The Mission Town nine is
rated as the best one that the Catholic
college has turned out in years, so
the Stanford followers need not feel
downhearted at the result of yester
day's contest.

Melhof, star hurler of Santa Clara
last year, and who was one of the
best twirlers in the Northwestern
league last season, was to have work
ed against the varsity yesterday for
the Agnews team. He is now working
at the hospital, and in a conflict with
one of the inmates, he broke one of
the fingers of his throwing hand. The
accident happened yesterday morning,
so he was forced to give up any idea
of pitching against Stanford.
*****
Bill Burns, who umpired the game,
will be remembered as having coached
the University of Santa Clara base
ball team in 1909-10 and 11. It was
at this time that the Mission Town
college had one of the best nines on
the coast. He is now a state assem
blyman from San Francisco, and is a
scout for the San Francisco Seals.
*****
Some of Stanford's best bets did not
show up well yesterday. They must
have had an off day, but it worried
the bleacherites to see men of Shriv
er's ability missing the easy ones.
Shriver is one of the prettiest ball
players that ever wore a Stanford
uniform, and is figured on to star
against. California this season.
