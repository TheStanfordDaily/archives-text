# Meet U.C. in Ice Hockey February 9
## 
### 
Stanford's first ice hockey game
with California will take place on
February 9, and will be followed by a
return match on February 16, and a
third contest, the date of which has
not as yet been definitely decided
upon.
Practice will be started at once and
will be greatly facilitated through the
courtesy of Mr. John Tait, the owner
of the San Francisco skating rink, and
in his efforts to further the new sport
on the coast, Mr. Tait has agreed to
pay the transportation and equipment
expenses of Stanford men in their
practice and has offered the free use
of his rink to them. The arrange
ments include bi-weekly trips to the
rink, ten men taking part in each
practice, thus giving an equal oppor
tunity for all men to try out.
Ice hockey enthusiasts are urged to
be present at the meeting held this
evening at 7:40 in the Union, to learn
more of the plans for the coming
year.
