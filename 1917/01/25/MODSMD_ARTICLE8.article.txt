# DR. MILLIKAN OF CHICAGO TALKS ON ATOMS
## PHYSICS AUTHORITY Disproves Common Theory as to Earth's Smallest Particles 
### 
STATING in theory that atoms have
electrical charges as their con
stituents, and that they can be
split up into those constituents, Dr.
Robert Andrew Miilikan explained,
yesterday afternoon, to a large audi
ence in the Little Theater, experi
ments he had carried on, which prac
tically prove the existence of a sub
atomic world. Dr. Miilikan is pro
fessor of Physics at the University of
Chicago, and has done more research
along this line than any other man
in this country.
Discoveries of Last Two Decades.
"Twenty years ago," he said, "it was
the belief of physicists that all the
big discoveries in their science had
been made; but the last twenty years
have shown even more of the opening
uj) of great physical phenomena, then
undreamed of, than ever before.
"The (lav of the indivisible atom is
gone. Atoms split themselves up into
smaller atoms and electrical charges.
'Electron' is the name for this ele
mentary charge."
Explains New Periodic Table.
Dr. Miilikan also explained a new
periodic table based on the electron
theory which may supersede the Mcn
deljeff table, as it clears up some of
the uncertainties of the latter.
Stereopticon slides of the results of
some of his experiments accompanied
the lecture. Dr. Miilikan spoke under
the auspices of Sigma Xi.
