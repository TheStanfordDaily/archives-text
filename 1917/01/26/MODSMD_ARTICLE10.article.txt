# REVISE CONTROL OF ATHLETICS
## NEW BOARD TAKES CHARGE OF FUNDS AND EQUIPMENT 
### 
APPROVAL by the Board of Trustees was given this afternoon of
a new athletic arrangement by which control of athletic fields,
equipment, and gate receipts is placed in the hands of a new com
mittee to be known as the Board of Athletic Control. This board will
be composed of three faculty members, v three students, and three
alumni.
The Executive Committee ceases to be the organization in direct
control of athletics, except in so far as schedules are concerned. In

the past the Executive Committee
has been in control of Stanford's
athletic affairs, with the approval of
the Advisory Athletic Board and
the Faculty Athletic Committee.
Concentration of authority is the
â€¢
aim of the new plan, which was
worked out by President Wilbur, with
the approval of the alumni board, and
a number of students. Several minor
changes suggested by the alumni and
students have been included in the
new plan. According to President
Wilbur, a change in athletic control
is made necessary by the new system
of compulsory athletics or military
work for underclassmen.
STUDENT BODY LOSES
YET GAINS POWERS
Apparently, what the student body
loses in authority in one way, it gains
in another. The student body will
hereafter, through its three members
on the Board of Athletic Control,
have a one-third voice in the distri
bution of money accrued from gym
lees at registration. This amounts to
approximately $15,000 a year. It will
have a one-third voice in spending of
all gate receipts, and in the conduct
of grounds, bleachers and equipment.
Hereafter, coaches will be named by
the Board of Athletic Control, and
will serve the year around, as instruc
tors. The Executive Committee will
still exist, and will have at its dis
posal funds derived from student body
dues, and season tickets. These can
be spent as the committee sees fit. If
i additional coaches are needed, the
student body is free to engage them.
AM* ACTIONS SUBJECT TO
PRESIDENT'S A PPRO VAI,
All actions of the Board of Control
are subject to the approval of the
President of the University.
Faculty members of the Board of
Athletic Control will be named by the
faculty, and alumni members will be
named through the alumni organiza
tion. The student body may name its
members in any way it sees fit.
Women's athletics will be on the
same basis with a separate women's
board of control.
The graduate manager will have
charge of schedules, with the ap
proval of the Executive Committee,
and the Board of Athletic Control.
The Athletic Advisory Board ceases
to exist.
