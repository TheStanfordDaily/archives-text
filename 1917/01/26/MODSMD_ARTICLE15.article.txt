						GUIDING POWER
## 
### 
Concentration of power, though per
haps not in accord with our ideas of
true democracy, is beyond doubt the
ideal of governmental efficiency. It is
this fact which reconciles ua to the
loss of power which the Executive
Committee and students as a body
will suffer under the new plan for
athletic control. The system of di
vided authority and distributed re
sponsibility has not proved remark
ably efficient in the administration of
University affairs during the past.
In the newly created Board of Ath
letic Control, we find an institution
with sufficient power to pursue a fixed
and definite policyâ€”an institution
which, with the more perfect insight
it will have into athletic problems,
may act with greater intelligence in
matters of importance than is pos
sible under the present system. Mis
takes have been made by the injec
tion of too much sentiment into our
deliberations, and a lack of intelli
gence due to a misunderstanding of
the issues.
The Board of Athletic Control, in
which the students have an equal voice
with faculty and alumni, will be in
effect a perpetual institution. Changes
will be made, but at 110 one time will
there be an entirely new board ap
pointed. This is an immense improve
ment over the present more shifting
control, under which there might be
one policy now and another next
year.
We believe the plan to be a com
paratively liberal one, under which
Stanford's athletics will prosper, and
wish to heartily endorse it.
