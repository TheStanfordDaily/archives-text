# MARBLE STEPS IN MUSEUM ARE SAWED OUT AND REPLACED
## 
### 
Work in tearing down the marble
steps leading to the Art gallery in the
Stanford museum, was started yester
day. Benieri, the Italian contractor,
who placed most of the statuary in
old Memorial Church, and who did a
greater part of the marble work for
Mrs. Stanford, has the contract for
the work.
This work requires great skill, as
the old steps have to be sawed loose
from the marble wall. A delay in the
work has been caused by reason of
the necessity of sending to Alaska for
the marble. The marble of the old
steps came from Amador county, but
that supply having long since been
exhausted, Alaska was the nearest
place frdm which similar marble
could be obtained.
