# Varsity Quintet to Play Santa Clara
## Go to Mission Town Tomorrow Nightâ€”Freshmen Meet Oakland Tech Here 
### 
After a hard week of workouts the
varsity basketball team goes into the
game with Santa Clara, Saturday
night, in excellent shape. The lineup
at the start of the game will prob
ably be the same as that which faced
(he College of the Pacific last Satur
day, with Captain Wheatly at center,
Bouncy and Roney, forwards, and
Dolan and Greve, guards.
In addition to the men who will
start the game at Santa Clara, Estes
and Pelouze, forwards; Righter, cen
ter, and Sullivan and Lytic, guards,
will be taken along as substitutes.
The squad will leave the Union at 7
o'clock.
Sperry of the College of the Pacific
will referee.
Coach Otto Fritsch of the Mission
team has been driving his team hard
since arriving at Santa Clara and is
prepared to send his strongest quin
tet in against Stanford, Saturday
night, when the opening whistle
blows. While Stanford defeated the
College of the Pacific five by a larger
score than Santa Clara did, this fact
does not offer a fair basis of compar
ison, as the Santa Clara team did not
put its strongest lineup into the
game, so that predictions as to the
outcome of tomorrow night's strug
gle are pure guesswork.
Frosh vs. Oakland.
While the varsity is competing with
Santa Clara at Santa Clara, the fresh
men will meet the Oakland Tech high
school at the gymnasium at 7:30.
There is a wealth of material out for
the freshman team and they will get
their first chance to show tomorrow
night. The admission for this game
will be fifteen cents or a season
ticket.
