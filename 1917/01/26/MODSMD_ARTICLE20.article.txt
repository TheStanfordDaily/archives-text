D. C. Elliott, 'IS, is Stanford chess
champion, as a result of the tourna
ment to choose members for the team
to meet California in intercollegiate
chess, which ended last night. Other
men, in addition to Elliott, who made
places on the team, are R. L. Mott,
'17, R. F. Lyon, 'IS, R. K. Meyers, 'IS,
E. F. Lawrence, '18, P. L. Williams,

There is still one place on the team
to be filled, as one member of the cIUD

urged to try out for this position.
Instructor E. V. Cage has consented
to meet the team in a simultaneous
match, some time during next week.
