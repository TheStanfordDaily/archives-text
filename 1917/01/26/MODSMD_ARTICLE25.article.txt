# Bureau of Accuracy

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
For your "Bureau of Accuracy" I
should like to say that the origin of
the lire in my house, attributed in
your notice to over-heated stove, was
due to a crevice in the tile Hue which
permitted either a spark or flames to
reach the wood.
I wish to thank the students and the
University authorities for their prompt
and efficient work, which saved the
house and its contents from material
damage.
Respectfully yours,
(Signed) J. E. COOVER.
