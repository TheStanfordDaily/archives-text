# Wilbur Interview Features Review
## President Gives Views On Chinese Situation in Hall 
### 
Stanford Illustrated Review is to
make its first appearance of the year
on the campus Monday, with its col
umns presenting a goodly array of
pertinent and seasonable topics cov
ering many phases of collegiate life.
With the coming issue the Review
changes to a monthly magazine.
The question of excluding Chinese
students from Encina Hall, comes up
for review in a series of interviews
obtained by B. C. Wohlford, '18, and
E. D. Kneass, 'IS, which includes
statements from President Wilbur,
Professor Stillman, and W. W. Gores,
'17, president of Encina Club. Such
representative views on a question
of timely interest should be of wide
interest to the student body.
"Honor Point System."
"The Honor Point System" is the
subject of a critical analysis from the
pen of H. S. Marshutz, '17. An
anonymous contributor offers a strong
argument against co-education. Evi
dently feeling secure in his anony
mity, he advocates the elimination of
the "eternal feminine" from the Stan
ford quad.
An interview of Assistant Pro
fessor E. E. Robinson of the
History department, appears un
der the title "President Wil
son and Stanford University." Pro
fessor Robinson was recently officially
thanked by the Democratic campaign
headquarters for the part he played
in the election of President Wilson.
His work was the preparing of charts.
These are explained in detail in the
interview which offers a very inter
esting sidelight on the recent na
tional campaign.
"Pity the Poor Burnt-Out Stude"
forms the title of a humorous offering
by F. J. Taylor, '18. "Assaying Ignor
ance," by S. S. Schnetzler, '17, and
an article covering the subject of ad
vertising, by N. H. Allen, 'IS, will add
to the variety that the Review will
offer.
The coming issue, which, under the
new division of work, has been man
aged by W. J. Losh, '17, has several
distinctive features which will add to
the attractiveness of the. makeup.
The paper used, except for the illus
trated section, is of a different grade
than heretofore used, in order to
meet the paper crisis without cutting
down on the size of the publication.
