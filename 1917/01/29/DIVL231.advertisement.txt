Dear Dad: Congratulations ! Your letter S
quite stunned me at first, but I have dis- 51
covered how to save the difference and aid Dj
my health at the same time. I tried a meal S
at the Inn last night, and —again congratu- Sj
lations on the Loco! Buy a Zeppelin if you ffl
want to. It is certainly good eating at 3
the Inn, and the a la carte system is a 5
wonder for keeping cost below $20 per. Best S
regards to the family. Your son, JOHN. K
