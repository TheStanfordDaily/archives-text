# MISSION QUINTET BEATS VARSITY 41 TO 30
## PLAY AT SANTA CLARA Roney and Bonney are Stars in Fastest Game of Present Season 
### 
STANFORD'S basketball team went
down before the Santa Clara var
sity, Saturday night by a 41-30
score, in one of the hardest games
ever participated in by a Cardinal
quintet.
From the sound of the opening
whistle the play was fast and hard.
The Mission players had the advant
age in weight, but during the first
half were unable to make that ad
vantage felt, the half ending 15 to 14,
with Stanford on the long end. An
other advantage for Santa Clara was
playing on its home floor, which has
no outside bounds on the sides of the
court. Stanford showed much better
team-work during the first half than
did Santa Clara, despite the fact that
the sidewalls often interfered with
their accurate passing.
Stanford Leads *'ir*t Half.
With the opening of the second half,
Don, the husky rugby player, shot
goals almost at will. He was easily
the star of the Santa Clara team,
scoring 25 of their points. Bonney
Avas as effective as usual in shooting
fouls, making seven of them success
ful. Roney's long shots brought fre
quent applause from the galley, as
many of them were made from diffi
cult angles.
No changcs were made in the Stan
ford lineup until shortly after the
opening of the second half, when Sul
livan replaced Dolan, Righter re
placed Wheatly, and Pelouze went in
for Bonney.
