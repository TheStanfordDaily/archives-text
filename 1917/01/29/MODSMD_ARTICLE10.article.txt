# Copies of Illustrated Review Go Astray on Quad
## 
### 
By mistake, several Illustrated Re
views addressed to subscribers on the
campus were sold on the quad this
morning, and as a result, the editors
of the Review do not know to whom
papers were sent. If the people who
did not. receive their copy of the Re
view will drop a card to the manager
a copy will be sent them.
The supply of Reviews ran ont be
fore noon, owing to the brisk sale
today, and many people were unable
to get. copies. Another supply will
be ready for readers tomorrow, and
will be on sale at the Engineering
corner.
