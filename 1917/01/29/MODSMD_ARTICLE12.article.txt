### 
J. R. Brokenshire, '19, H. W. Cutler,
'IS, F. S. Field, '17, W. L. Miller, '17,
and A. G. Westwick, 'IS, were chosen
Friday, for the squad from which to
pick the Stanford teams to debate
against the University of Washington
and the University of Oregon.
Preliminary tryouts were held
Thursday, in which six candidates
were picked. These men and veter
ans of former Stanford teams were
in the finals Friday, from which the
five men were selected.
A strong combination should result
from the squad. Field was in the Tri-
State debate last year, and was a
member of the team that won from
University of Southern California last
fall. The other men are experienced
and when such debaters as G. J.
Knight, '19. and S. A. Evans, '19. were
beaten by them in the trials, hope for
wins in the Tri-State are good.
