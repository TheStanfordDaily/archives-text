# RISBERG HITS OUT HOMER TO WIN BALL GAME
## FINAL SCORE 1 TO 0 Ireland Day Proves Success Although Stanford Loses to Independents 
### 
SLAMMING one of the longest bits
ever obtained on the Stanford
diamond, a home run over center
field, "Swede" Risberg won the base
ball game from the Stanford varsity,
Saturday afternoon, dedicated to Cliff
Ireland. His marker was the only
score of the contest. It came in the
fourth inning, with one down, and
was secured off of one of (Jus
Hoever's benders. Swain and Shee
han had a good club to oppose the
Cardinals, and with Cliff Ireland on
second, keeping both teams on edge
throughout the game by his ready wit,
the full nine innings sped by in the
record time of one hour and#tliirty
minutes.
Hits Are Scarce.
James J. Nealon failed to putin an
appearance, and Captain "Doc" Hayes
handled the indicator. His work was
satisfactory throughout, although Cliff
Ireland told the fans that some of
his decisions were a little Haysey.
The contest would probably go on
record as an excellent exhibition of
the national pastime, but regardless of
the close score and few errors, it was
a tame affair. There was something
lacking, and the whole spectacle
took 011 too much of the "oue-two
three" aspect. It is hoped that some
scheme will be devised to liven up the
preliminary baseball tangles.
One lone bingle was the sum total
of the slugging efforts of the local
batsmen. "Spider" Baum of the San
Francisco Coasters, and Mails of the
Brooklyn National League champs,
were in good form, and showed the
bleacher warmers what real twirling
was. lloever and Draper also tossed
nice ball. Five hits were all that the
visitors secured, and considering the
reputation for getting base swats that
some of the Independents have, the
performance of the Stanford hurlers
was excellent.
Coach Wilson trotted out all of the
available substitutes, and before the
nine frames had been completed,
fifteen men had been given an oppor
tunity to demonstrate their ability.
There was little to choose between the
Stanford players. Lilly played a good
game in the outfield and banged out
the only hit, a long two-bagger.
Cowan and Stevens made classy in
field stops of hard balls.
