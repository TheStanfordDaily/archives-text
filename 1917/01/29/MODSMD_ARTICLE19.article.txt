# "WHAT OF THE WOMEN FOLKS?"
## 
### 
Under the title of "What of the
Women Folks?" the Stanford Illus
trated Review came out today against
co-educatiou for the University. The
Review points out that Stanford would
serve a wider field for the country if
the women of the University were
obliged to go elsewhere for an educa
tion, and that five hundred men who
might enter in their place would be
of more use than the "co-eds."
Naturally, the campus is not at all
unanimous in its sentiment on the co
educatiou idea, and many feel that in
losing its "five hundred" Stanford
would be losing one of the vital ele
ments in modern university life. The
Daily Palo Alto is gathering a con
sensus of opinion on the issue, to be
presented in the following issues.
Following are some extracts from
the Review's indictment against the
Stanford women:
"The question which most naturally
arises now is: Co-education —is it
consistent with this idealized policy
of the University?
"Generally speaking, co-education is
not consistent with the policy out
lined. The Five Hundred women are
not entitled—except by technical reg
ulation—to keep away from these
broadening facilities five hundred
men. The few exceptional women the
University turns out do not justify the
remaining four hundred and fifty or
seventy-five it retains."
* * *
"The largest number of those
women who embrace professions take
up the work of the 'schoolmarm.' But
practically all of them intend to marry
and settle down into home relations
that consist in making life interest
ing and enjoyable for a husband and
the inevitable youngsters."
♦ * *
"As the situation exists, they have
many other places to go, where they
will get every bit as good an educa
tion as they do at Stanford, where, in
fact, many will be able to achieve a
much better education."
* * *
"What they seek here they can get
equally well elsewhere; but what men
are seeking here, they will not be
able to get equally well elsewhere."
* * *
"If the University is to be consist
ent, if the University is to use its ap
propriations without perpetrating eco
nomic waste, women will bo barred
from Stanford University."

"What they seek here they can get
equally well elsewhere; but what men
are seeking here, they will not be
able to get equally well elsewhere."

"If the University is to be consist
