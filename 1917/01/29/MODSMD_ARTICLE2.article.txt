# Freshmen Take Ball Game by 5-0 Count
## Out-Play Manzanita for Win in Second Contest of Season 
### 
Stanford Freshmen outhit and out
ficlded Manzanita in their second base
ball game of the season, and as a re
sult were winners by a score of 5 to
0, on the faculty diamond, Saturday.
A lack of hitting ability and team
work was evident in the contest, but
an improvement that gives promise
for later season form was noticeable.
For the freshmen, Pike and Way
land played a good game. Morse, in
the box for the babes, pitched a strong
brand of ball, as did Lifur, who fol
lowed him. These two heavers are
both showing good form, and Coach
Wilson should be able to turn out a
strong hurling staff.
All the candidates were given a
chance to get in the game before the
seven innings were over. Since no
team has been chosen the men are
not playing together, but several
good players arc put and all the posi
tions are being fought for.
