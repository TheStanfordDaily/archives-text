Three (lays remain in which dime
contributions can be made for the
Blind Relief Fund, an appeal for
which has been made on the campus
during the past month. The campaign
will close on February 1, and no
contributions can be received after
that date, according to announcement
made today.
Fifty dime banks have been placed
on the campus, and can be found in
the bookstore, registrar's office, the
Union, the Women's Club House, and
all the dormitories, fraternities and
sororities. The appeal reached Stan
ford through the efforts of Mrs. David
Starr Jordan and President Wilbur.
Many thousands of dollars have
been collected by the Permanent Blind
Relief Fund Committee, under whose
auspices the campaign has been con
ducted since last April. The head
quarters of the work are in New
York, but the appeal has been made
and has met with generous response
all over the world. The purpose of
the fund is to build and operate work
shops in which occupations can be
taught to the thousands of soldiers
and sailors in the British, French and
Belgian forces who have been blinded
in the present war. There is a vast
number of men who have lost their
eyesight, whom the fund proposes to
aid, and many have been aided by en
abling them to help themselves in
this manner.
A ruling made by the Social Service
Committee provides that the cam
paign must close on February 1, so
that those in charge of the work on
the campus are making a special ap
peal to the students to make the last
three days count.
