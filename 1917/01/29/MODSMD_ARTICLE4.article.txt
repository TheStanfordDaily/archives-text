# D.C. Upp Chosen to Captain Stanford Ice Hockey Team

### 
Daniel C. Upp, .Jr., '18, was elected
captain of the Stanford ice hockey
team at the week-end practice at the
Winter Garden Palace in San Fran
cisco.
Upp hails from Dawson, Canada,
where ice skating is as common as
walking, so is well fitted for the po
sition given him. Due largely to
Upp's perseverance in the lace of dif
ficulties, ice hockey has started a suc
cessful career at Stanford.
Games with California have been
changed from the dates formerly an
nounced, to February 1G and March 2,
with March 9 for a third game if
it proves necessary. A silver cup has
been offered by Mr. John Tait as a
trophy for the winner of the series.
Week-end practice brought out
much new, promising material, eleven
men putting on skates at the Winter
(larden. Captain Upp requests that
any who intend coming out for the
sport will see him personally. Fol
lowing is the list of men who took
part in the last practice: W. W. Col
