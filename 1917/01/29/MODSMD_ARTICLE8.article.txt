# STANFORD TALENT TO TRYOUT FOR "JUSTICE"
## TO BEGIN TOMORROW Best of Campus Dramatic Ability Expected to Compete 
### 
COMPETITIVE tryouts for Gals
worthy's powerful drama, "Jus
tice," are to be held tomorrow
afternoon at 2 o'clock, in the Women's
Club House.
".Justice" will make heavy demands
upon campus talent. The cast of the
play is a fairly large one, affording a
range of parts from that of the silent
juryman to that of the eloquent at
torney, whose plea for defense is so
intensely dramatic and human that it
will, in spite of its length, hold an
audience spellbound in its grasp.
Galsworthy's character, Frome, in
his appeal for justice in the broader
sense of the term, must make one of
the longest speeches ever written for
a successful drama. Yet Frome's ap
peal strikes "home" so firmly that it
seems to flash in an instant.
"Justice" affords opportunity for
many important roles. The players
who win the parts of Falder, the vic
tim of justice; Cokeson, who sympa
thizes; Frome, the attorney for the
defense, and Ruth Honeywell, will
have lines that demand every bit of
the actor. There are other "big"
parts besides. "Justice" is so tre
mendous that every line is "big."
