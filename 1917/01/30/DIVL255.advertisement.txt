THOSE QUAD PICTURES
"Now / wouldn't mind this picture taking stunt
so much if it didn't have to be at such obnoxious
hours," said Co-Edna, posing for the Quad. "It
makes too much of a rush for meals."
Then Co-Edna got her inspiration.
"Iknow what I'll do," she said, "I'llhave a Wil
son Luncheon. The rest of the bunch will be tickled
at the idea, and we'll have a fine meal and a fine
time at the new Wilson store."
