# Euphronia Against Faculty Censorship of Publications
## 
### 
Euphronia went on record as un
animously opposed to censorship of
student publications and plays by a
faculty committee, last night, at (heir
regular meeting. They expressed the
opinion that if censorship was neces
sary, a student committee should be
appointed.
A large attendance, including sev
eral visitors, featured the snappy
meeting of the literary society, in
which the members set as a senate
and discussed Ihe "rider" amendment
to the constitution. Euphronia plans
to meet as a senate the remainder of
the semester.
Three men were elected to mem
bership. They are A. L. Crawford,
'20. E. It. Smurr, '20, and IT. E.
nianchi, '19.
