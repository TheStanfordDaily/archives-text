# "MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING"
## 
### 
Did you know that Stanford is on
the verge of an open rebellion against
the administration and its reforms?
Probably not. Neither did we, until
we heard about it in a metropolitan
newspaper yesterday. It sounded very
much as if someone was putting up a
game on us. This is not the first time
that Stanford has been represented to
the public as a hot-bed of contention,
and a place which scenario writers
might well afford to visit to secure a
hair-raising inspiration for a popular
movie. We are getting plenty of ad
vertising, but it is the wrong kind.
Distortion of perfectly calm and rea
sonable criticism into open revolt is
quite a stretch. The stretching may
be traced to two sources. Either cam
pus correspondents, in too eager de
sire to add a few cents to their pay
envelopes, have garbled reports, or
city newspapers with yellow tenden
cies have made "good reading" out of
what, if truthfully presented, would be
a matter of but passing interest. We
are inclined to place most of the
blame on the newspapers, although a
certain few of the correspondents are
probably not above reprofveh.
Whatever the cause, the cost is too
great. We cannot afford to have the
good name of Stanford besmirched.
It seems unreasonable to ask that we
give up our right to express inde
pendent thought, however. There is
no harm in a rational presentation of
the student's point of view, if set forth
with honest motive. It is only those
articles which are published to create
a sensation, and with a half-hope on
the part of the writer that he will be
martyrized, which are objectionable.
Surely it should be possible to retain
the privilege of sane criticism, and
still be able to pick up a metropolitan
newspaper without reading how Stan
ford has staged, or is about to stage,
some comic opera wrinkle.
If the fault is with the newspapers,
we can but appeal to their honor; if
with the correspondents, there is a
more practical remedy.
