Sir: This of the "Women Folks"
who "keep away from these broaden
ing facilities five hundred men." The
life of the average college man is
narrowing, even with the women on
the premises. Except for those so
cially elect, and financially anle men
who can derive their social amuse
ment from outside sources, the col
lege man must get his contact with
the eternal feminine through his ac
ademic work, and the college func
tions. Palo Alto is no New Y'ork, or
Chicago, to supply partners for
dances, and that is partcically the
only contact that a single gendered
Stanford could afford for her sons.
On the other hand what factor can be
more broadening than the wholesome
influence that one derives from the
contact in one's academic, college,
! and other work with the female of
; the species similarly occupied. Will
. not those "broadening influences" of
intensive study and nose-to-the-grind
stone efficiency be stultifying if we
do not indulge ourselves in the honest
pleasures, and truly broadening out
j side influences of which woman forms
jso very great a part?
And suppose we do not produce
I ninety-nine and ninety-eight hun
dredths per cent of "school marms"
to work out their full blossom with
drudg|ery, and suppose the aim of
most young women is to "settle down
into home relations that consist in
making life interesting and enjoyable
for a husband, and the inevitable
youngsters," is not the real aim of
life, or should it not be, true happi
ness, and is not a wife of the same
mental training as her husband more
able to help him toward this ideal
than one without those advantages,
and who better fitted than one of a
man's own alma mater's daughters.
No! let us not take barren success
as the ultimate goal. We are not the
Germans, or English, that we have to
worship a hard-hearted, steely-eyed
efficiency. Perhaps if the people of
the world do not come to their senses
before a hundred years or more we
may have to kneel at the base of this
brazen image, but at present our ef
ficiency can remain more kindly, more
true, more perfect. I am a firm be
liever in the utility of the bee-like
butterfly—that is, unless we seek to
abandon true hope and perfect con
tentment as our aims and let dull res
ignation take their place.
"There is no place like Stanford"
for the woman. Wellesley, that is
providing a prospective "school marm"
has sufficient money, will supply safety
of environment. California will sup
ply education, and co-education, but
Stanford affords all three. It is dif
ficult not to imagine that the author
of "What of the Women Polks" meant
the reverse when he said "What they
seek they can get elsewhere; but
what men are seeking here, they will
not be able to get equally well else
where."
"If the University is to be consist
ent, if the University is to use its ap
propriations without perpetrating eco
nomic waste," the University will
throw overboard the sand ballast be
fore it casts away the cargo of gold.
We must see less of this policy of
fences "a-putting of 'em up and then
a-taking of 'em down agin," more
economy along lines less vital before
we can consider the "perpetration" of
such a material and spiritual loss as
the abolishment of co-education at
Stanford. T. H. C.

No! let us not take barren success

may have to kneel at the base of this
brazen image, but at present our ef
ficiency can remain more kindly, more
true, more perfect. I am a firm be

abandon true hope and perfect con
tentment as our aims and let dull res
