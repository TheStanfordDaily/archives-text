Race prejudice by a tacit agree
ment won popular opinion. Now the
contractile mind of our Stanford
thinker decides that even part of his
immediate kind must be relegated
from the institution. In short, women
must go! Such expressions of excited
egos are to be enjoyed rather than
refuted.
This depreciation of femininity is
based probably on queening data,
Mere Man overlooking the fact that
girls queen even as the men, purely
for amusement and relaxation. Am
bitions in artistic, intellectual and
business phases of social activity are
more predominant than desires for
domestic felicity. Aside from the lazy
and ineffiecient, no woman anticipates
in marriage anything but one of many
interesting experiences.
But by far the most astonishing
thing about the article is the fact
that Mr. Griffin should have accepted
such an atrociously written article.
The literary tone of the Illustrated
should not be lowered by illiterate
contributors.
