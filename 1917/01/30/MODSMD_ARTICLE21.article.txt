On the accepted principle that
everyone has a right to his opinion,
"Mere Man" is entitled to his on
"Women Folks," being coocoos in the
Stanford nest —but my chapeau is
lifted to Socrates, who says, "There
is no sex in intellect. Women are
men's equal in every way save that
of physical strength."
(Ed. Note: —The Daily Palo Alto
will continue to print interviews on
both sides of this question during
succeeding issues. We hope that those
with convictions will have the courage
to express them, whether they favor
the women or not, as it is desirable
to secure a fair consensus of opin
ion.)
