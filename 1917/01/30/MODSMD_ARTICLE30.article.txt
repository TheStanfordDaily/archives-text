# O.K. Cushing Gives Address to Lawyers
## Describes Future Lawyer as One With Whom Moral Duty Will Come First 
### 
That lawyers have a great respon
sibility to the public in the adminis
tration of justice, was the statement
of O. K. Cushing of San Francisco,
member of the Stanford law faculty,
In bis address to the law students
yesterday.
Speaking further, Mr. Cushing said
that lawyers should not be hampered
by written codes made two or three
hundred years ago, but should be free
to administer justice by laws contain
ing the spirit of the times. If we
want to grow our laws must change
with that growth.
Tn the near future the successful
lawyer will be the man who does not
use his knowledge and talent to make
money at the cost of justice, but the
man who takes a case because his
client has a moral right to win.
Next Monday, at 2:10 p.m., in room
12, Mr. Cushing will give a second
address to the law students on the
"Relation of the Lawyer to His
Client."
