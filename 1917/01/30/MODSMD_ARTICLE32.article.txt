# "Shakespeare" Topic of Lecture by Dr. Wallace
## 
### 
Popular misconception of the pri
vate life of Shakespeare and the the
ater of his time were discussed in the
light of new discoveries relating to the
English poet, last night, by Dr. Charles
William Wallace in the Little Theater.
Dr. Wallace has spent seven years in
searching through old English docu
ments, and has discovered many new
facts about Shakespeare, among which
is a new autograph appearing on a
deposition of the poet.
Shakespeare's income, according to
Dr. Wallace, was from 200 to 240
pounds a year, the practical equiva
lent of $4000 to $4800 today. Dr. Wal
lace also proved that actors in Shake
speare's time were not a set of
"rogues and vagabonds," as some his
torians maintain.
