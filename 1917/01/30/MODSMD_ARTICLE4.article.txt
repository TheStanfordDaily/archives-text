## WOMEN OBJECT TO WORDS OF "MERE MAN" Doctor Jordan and Women Give Statements on Co-Education 
### 
"Mere Man" could not know the
sting of a woman's tongue nor the
heights to which her ire may rise
when he attempted to question in bold
type her appropriateness as a part of
the Stanford family, in an article that
appeared in the Stanford Illustrated
Review yesterday, under the title
"What About the Women Folks."
Conflagration Started.
No bomb ever started a bigger con
flagration, no hornets, rudely dis
turbed from a state of domestic bliss,
ever retaliated with a sharper sting
than did the "female of the species"
in this case. Before "Mere Man"
ventured his opinions the "eternal
feminine" was a peaceful, gentle crea
ture, concerning herself chiefly with
the petty problems of a college cur
riculum; now they are up in arms
and with the proverbial feminine
weapon they have opened fire. "Yes,
what of the women folks," they wildly
shriek, and in the ensuing din "Mere
Man" begins to wonder how it hap
pens that the picked five hundred tol
erated his own presence on the Stan-
I ford farm so long.
