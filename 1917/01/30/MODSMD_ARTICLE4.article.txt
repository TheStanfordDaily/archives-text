## WOMEN OBJECT TO WORDS OF "MERE MAN" Doctor Jordan and Women Give Statements on Co-Education 
### 
"Mere Man" could not know the
sting of a woman's tongue nor the
heights to which her ire may rise
when he attempted to question in bold
type her appropriateness as a part of
the Stanford family, in an article that
appeared in the Stanford Illustrated
Review yesterday, under the title
"What About the Women Folks."
Conflagration Started.
No bomb ever started a bigger con
flagration, no hornets, rudely dis
turbed from a state of domestic bliss,
ever retaliated with a sharper sting
than did the "female of the species"
in this case. Before "Mere Man"
ventured his opinions the "eternal
feminine" was a peaceful, gentle crea
ture, concerning herself chiefly with
the petty problems of a college cur
riculum; now they are up in arms
and with the proverbial feminine
weapon they have opened fire. "Yes,
what of the women folks," they wildly
shriek, and in the ensuing din "Mere
Man" begins to wonder how it hap
pens that the picked five hundred tol
erated his own presence on the Stan-
I ford farm so long.
I)r. Daviil Starr Jordan.
The matters in this article were all
fully gone over by Governor Stanford
and myself in 1891. The limtation of
the number of women rested primar
ily on the fact that few would be
candidates for the doctor's degree in
science or arts, and fewer in Engineer
ing, Mcdicine, or Law. But total ex
clusion is very different from limita
tion.
No school is as valuable to ad
vanced students if confined to one
sex or to one trade. The appreciation
of womanhood on the part of young
men is much higher when they are
brought in contact with the best rep
resentatives than when, in my college
days, we met none but town girls and
those at functions of no intellectual or
social values.
If the women are ever excluded
fro/u Stanford the University will not
be the same, nor in any social sense
as valuable as now. Those of us who,
as pioneers, helped to create its meth
ods and spirit will then turn over in
our graves and face toward Berkeley.
