Throughout t the smoke of conflict
the following verbal shots give prom
ise of being heard "'round the quad":
Anita .Marcus, '17.
The narrowness of the Stanford
man who said that women of Stan
ford can't be of honest and efficient
service to the community and to the
nation, and that women are unable to
help the University to approximate its
ideals, is appalling. May I ask "a
mere man," who takes a fling at the
"school marm," what factor is a
greater benefit to the nation than the
education of the race?
Anonymous.
I am strictly against co-education.
Women in an essentially man's school
of the Stanford type are out of their
place as much as a man would be in
a woman's university fashioned after
Vassar or Wellesley. All the great
, schools of the world have been built
on the basis of "Men Only." Harvard,
Yale, and all the universities of
Europe have developed without the
fair sex, and if Stanford is to be
come the ideal of the west she must
| exclude women from the "Farm."
