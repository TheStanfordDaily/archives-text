Anita .Marcus, '17.
The narrowness of the Stanford
man who said that women of Stan
ford can't be of honest and efficient
service to the community and to the
nation, and that women are unable to
help the University to approximate its
ideals, is appalling. May I ask "a
mere man," who takes a fling at the
"school marm," what factor is a
greater benefit to the nation than the
education of the race?
Anonymous.
I am strictly against co-education.
Women in an essentially man's school
of the Stanford type are out of their
place as much as a man would be in
a woman's university fashioned after
Vassar or Wellesley. All the great
, schools of the world have been built
on the basis of "Men Only." Harvard,
Yale, and all the universities of
Europe have developed without the
fair sex, and if Stanford is to be
come the ideal of the west she must
| exclude women from the "Farm."
Foremost among a host of cham
pions who have arisen to defend the
fair sex is Chancellor Jordan, who
indignantly exclaims that if women
are excluded from Stanford that
"those of us, who as pioneers helped
to create its methods and spirit will
turn over in our graves and face to
ward Berkeley."
The article which has made itself
the center of the storm presented an
entirely new phase of the old argu
ment "shall women he excluded from
Stanford." It assumes as a premise
a certain idealized policy of the Uni
versity, and then indicts the five hun
dred, en masse, on the charge that
"the few exceptional women the Uni
versity turns out do not justify the
remaining four hundred and fifty or
seventy-five it retains."
