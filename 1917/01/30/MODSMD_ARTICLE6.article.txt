J. W. Preston, United States district
attorney, of San Francisco, is inves
tigating the question of neutrality
violation regarding the departure of
eight Stanford students for France to
serve in the American Ambulance
Corps. Preston says recruiting from
this country for war service in France
is a breach of neutrality.
President Wilbur says:"I do not
see how this can be taken for recruit
ing. Other colleges have sent men
for ambulance service, and if war gets
to the place where we can't lie 1 p the
wounded it will be most unusual. But
I haven't heard anything as yet about

an investigation the United States at
torney proposes."
Stanford's student volunteers say
their services cannot be considered a
bearch of neutrality because they
swear allegiance to the United States
only and their purpose is entirely to
aid the wounded.

France, February 4, are: C. A. Ran
dau, '19, J. H. Eastman, 'IS, H. E.
