# STANFORD NINE WILL MEET DAVIS
## 
### 
Graduate Manager Behrens an
nounced this afternoon that the Stan
ford varsity baseball team has been
invited to compete with the Davis
Farm hall tossers at Davis Farm on
April 28th. This will be a big day
at (lie University of California agricul
tural school. It is called Picnic Day
and is an annual affair.
Governor Hiram Johnson will speak,
as will several other prominent men
of the state. Excursion trains will be
run from all nearby cities and from
San Francisco. The baseball game is
the athletic feature of the day's pro-

I gram, and as the University of Cali
fornia nine has always played in the
past, the Stanford players feel com
' plimented in being given the oppor
tunity of meeting the Davis Farm ag
i gregation at this time.
Last season, the Farm players put
out an excellent baseball team. Their
battery was especially good. Owen
and Harwood have both gone into
faster company and have made good.
It is understood that the team this
year is even hotter than the 1916
squad, and will give the varsity a hard
game.
