"Mere Man." was probably sincere
•when he advocated the elimination of
women from the University, and
doubtless had the best interests of
Stanford at heart. Looking at the ,
proposition from a purely impersonal j
standpoint, we are inclined to believe
that the ideal educational institution
may be more nearly realized by segre
gating the sexes—at least the schol
astic ideal. Still there is a beneficial
and broadening influence in co-edu
cation which is worth the partial sac
rifice of our ideal in the strictly in
tellectual sense. Since women are
destined to play a large part in the
lives of inen, it is a good thing to get
used to them early in the game. Co
education gives this opportunity and
from the more human standpoint is
desirable. We are for it.
Being relieved of this much, how
ever, we wish to take exception to the
system as it is at Stanford. We be
lieve that elimination is better than
limitation, particularly for the women.
The distribution of three to one is so
unequal as to make man a nuisance
and woman almost a curiosity, with
the result hat the latter is spoiled.
The unusual amount of attention ac
corded Stanford women poorly fits
them for the experience of after life,
when they are not placed at a prem
ium. There are not enough here to
go around, and we'have all observed
the result, which, though common, is
not universal we are glad to admit.
If women were allowed to come here
as freely as men, this defect in the
system would be remedied. Favoring
co-education, as we do, we would
like to see such a step taken.
