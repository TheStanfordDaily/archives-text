Coach Wilson says that the Stan
ford varsity looks better every clay.
Workouts are being held in the af
ternoons, and both the hitting and the
fielding of the men has improved
greatly. He gives as his chief reason
for the marked improvement, the fact
that there are at least two players of
ability out for every position.

Campbell is showing more behind
the plate. He is big and has an ex
cellent throwing arm. His hitting is
improving, and with the biggest part
of the season ahead, he will undoubt
edly be able to hold down the position
behind the log in good form when the
Big Series rolls around.

Word comes from the University
of California that seven veterans are
out in uniforms every night. Coach
Zamlock will have one of the best
nines that the Blue and Gold has
ever put on the diamond. Captain
Sammy Adair will be back in the game
and Thompson and James of the
freshmen team of last year will com
pete for varsity berths. Furlong and
Young are the only men missing from
the 1916 champions.

Santa Clara is developing a strong
aggregation under the guidance of
"Tub" Spencer. Their lineup now
stands as follows: Hickey and Leon
ard in the box, Pratt catching, Bens
berg on first, Rooney on second,
O'Neill at short, Mahar at third, and
Milburn, Desmond and Conners in the
outfield.
*****
It is understood that Mel half, the
crack Northwestern League twirler,
will pitch against the varsity this af
ternoon at Agnews. Mehalf has
beaten the Santa Clara delegation
twice this year.

Lilly is showing to better advantage
than any other Cardinal player in the
games played thus far. He covers a
worlt\ of territory in the outfield, and
leads the squad in hitting.
*****
Bill Pike, Galloway and Wayland
are displaying a nice brand of base
ball on the freshmen team. Lifur
seems to be the best of the 1920
pitchers.
*****
The Stanford varsity looks to have
the speediest infield that it has had
in some time. How would it look to
have Stevens on third. Cowan at short
and Shriver on third? All of these
players prefer the above positions.
