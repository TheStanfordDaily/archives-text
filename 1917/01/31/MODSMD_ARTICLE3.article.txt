# "500" Hurl . . . . . Sharp Darts . . . at Mere Man

### 
With crys of "Heaven Help Us," and
questions of pertinent and sarcastic
tone, that run the whole gamut of the
subject co-education, the "eternal
feminine" assumes the austere role
of an eternal questioner. She has
risen to beseige "Mere Man" behind
his stronghold of anonymity, with
fiery darts that are the telling results
of feminine ire aroused to the nth de
gree.
"Is 'What of the Women Folks?'
Ultra-Modern?", "Are the Dark Ages
With Us Again?", "Is Mere Man Try
ing to Start Something?"—these and
many others of a like nature are
questions that remain unanswered,
like thunder clouds ready at any mo
ment to deluge the tribe of "mere
men" should they come out from am
bush.
Hut the 500 are not alone in their
sharp criticism of the illustrated Re

the anonymous writer are fallacious.

Pru.ssia.nism
Is "What of the Women Folk" ultra
modern? Is its zest for national ef
ficiency post-Prussianism? Or is it
perhaps antideluvian ? Even in Bible
days the efficient feaster dropped a
few crumbs for the dogs, and the
most Israelitish harvester left some
straw for the gleaner. Either way it
is far enough from the simple women

Writer's Points
Fallacious
In my opinion, three fundamental
fallacies underlie the arguments of "A
iMere Man" against coeducation at
Stanford.
First —That the vocational or pro
fessional side of a Stanford education
is the main result aimed at, instead
of character building and citizen de
veloping, by far the most important
aim.
Second —That, particularly in the
latter respect , the University educa
tion of women is of less importance
than that of men.
Third —That women can do as well
anywhere else than at Stanford any
more than can the men.
Professor .1. M. Stillman.
Women Have Full
Citizenship
If Socrates should be.here to waste
his time reading the logical (?) dis
cussion in the "Review" concerning
the advisability of eliminating women
from Stanford, he would doubtless
follow his custom of asking for a
definition of terms. And one of those,
in the writer's opinion, would be ac
tive citizenship. Evidently the un
known author of the article failed to
appreciate that in California women
have approximately the same civil
duties as the men. If this were not
so, mere differences in activities
should not be construed as passivity.
If their duties were confined to
training future citizens either in the
school room or in the home, women
still would be in need of the knowl
edge of that idealized citizenship
which Stanford alone, according to
"Mere Man," can teach.
Mildred Hannn, '17.
Stanford Cannot
Banish 500
A certain "Mere Man" has shown
that he is not the intelligently far
sighted person that a Stanford man
should be. If Stanford's ideal is to
give "exceptional opportunities for in
tellectual development in order to
produce citizens of the highest order,"
it can not overlook one-hall' of the
citizens.
This "Merc Man" has ruined his
own argument by admitting that 90
per cent of the women students at
Stanford "will settle down to making
life pleasant and enjoyable for a hus
band and the inevitable youngsters."
It is the broad-minded, alert, capable
women, who have had training and
experience in a co-educational univer
sity such as Stanford, that become
the most useful and serviceable
women citizens, and the most capable
"Mothers of the Race."
1 commend to this aspiring young
author's attention Dr. Jordan's book,
"The Woman and the University," and
the old, but ever timely saying, "The
hand that rocks the cradle rules the
world."

Dark Ages are
Here Again
Heaven help us! Are the dark ages
with us again or is "Mere Man" just
trying to "start something?" Are
women once more to receive their
education "anywhere," so that man
may gain that national efficiency of
which he shouts? But just where is
this "anywhere" to be found in the
west, where the "500" can receive
their intellectual training "equally
well" as they do at Stanford.
There are many of us who would
gladly betake ourselves to an eastern
college, but the elusive dollar which
keeps many a mere man from Har
vard or Yale, keeps us likewise from
Wellesley, Vassar or Holyoke. But if
it ever comes to pass that our daugh
ter's daughters can not enter the
doors of Stanford, then may it come
to pass that the coming Stanford pro
vider of the family will have gained
by that time so great a degree of ef
ficiency that there may be nothing to
keep the daughters from going to
those institutions of the east which
DO give an education "equally well."

It appears to me that the article
concerning the elimination of women
from the University, as printed in the
Illustrated Review, is not to be taken
seriously either by members of the
"500" or others favoring co-education.
Tt believe it was designed not as a
practical policy, which the writer was
convinced should be enacted, but
rather as a drawing card for the Re
view. As such it has proved inter
estingly successful. The saner minded
of the Powers That Be and of the

student body realize, T believe, that,
the student of Stanford needs to ac
quire the art of meeting and dealing
with both men and women if he would
be successful after graduation. It
would be impractical to deprive the
average student of this advantage by
reorganizing the University for the
sake of the few Avho lack the judg
ment. and discretion necessary for the
proper equalization of time and
thought between friends and work.

Dark Ages are
Here Again
Heaven help us! Are the dark ages
with us again or is "Mere Man" just
trying to "start something?" Are
women once more to receive their
education "anywhere," so that man
may gain that national efficiency of
which he shouts? But just where is
this "anywhere" to be found in the
west, where the "500" can receive
their intellectual training "equally
well" as they do at Stanford.
There are many of us who would
gladly betake ourselves to an eastern
college, but the elusive dollar which
keeps many a mere man from Har
vard or Yale, keeps us likewise from
Wellesley, Vassar or Holyoke. But if
it ever comes to pass that our daugh
ter's daughters can not enter the
doors of Stanford, then may it come
to pass that the coming Stanford pro
vider of the family will have gained
by that time so great a degree of ef
ficiency that there may be nothing to
keep the daughters from going to
those institutions of the east which
DO give an education "equally well."

It appears to me that the article
concerning the elimination of women
from the University, as printed in the
Illustrated Review, is not to be taken
seriously either by members of the
"500" or others favoring co-education.
Tt believe it was designed not as a
practical policy, which the writer was
convinced should be enacted, but
rather as a drawing card for the Re
view. As such it has proved inter
estingly successful. The saner minded
of the Powers That Be and of the

student body realize, T believe, that,
the student of Stanford needs to ac
quire the art of meeting and dealing
with both men and women if he would
be successful after graduation. It
would be impractical to deprive the
average student of this advantage by
reorganizing the University for the
sake of the few Avho lack the judg
ment. and discretion necessary for the
proper equalization of time and

Writer's Points
Fallacious
In my opinion, three fundamental
fallacies underlie the arguments of "A
iMere Man" against coeducation at
Stanford.
First —That the vocational or pro
fessional side of a Stanford education
is the main result aimed at, instead
of character building and citizen de
veloping, by far the most important
aim.
Second —That, particularly in the
latter respect , the University educa
tion of women is of less importance
than that of men.
Third —That women can do as well
anywhere else than at Stanford any
more than can the men.

Women Have Full
Citizenship
If Socrates should be.here to waste
his time reading the logical (?) dis
cussion in the "Review" concerning
the advisability of eliminating women
from Stanford, he would doubtless
follow his custom of asking for a
definition of terms. And one of those,
in the writer's opinion, would be ac
tive citizenship. Evidently the un
known author of the article failed to
appreciate that in California women
have approximately the same civil
duties as the men. If this were not
so, mere differences in activities
should not be construed as passivity.
If their duties were confined to
training future citizens either in the
school room or in the home, women
still would be in need of the knowl
edge of that idealized citizenship
which Stanford alone, according to
"Mere Man," can teach.

Writer's Points
Fallacious
In my opinion, three fundamental
fallacies underlie the arguments of "A
iMere Man" against coeducation at
Stanford.
First —That the vocational or pro
fessional side of a Stanford education
is the main result aimed at, instead
of character building and citizen de
veloping, by far the most important
aim.
Second —That, particularly in the
latter respect , the University educa
tion of women is of less importance
than that of men.
Third —That women can do as well
anywhere else than at Stanford any
more than can the men.
Professor .1. M. Stillman.
Women Have Full
Citizenship
If Socrates should be.here to waste
his time reading the logical (?) dis
cussion in the "Review" concerning
the advisability of eliminating women
from Stanford, he would doubtless
follow his custom of asking for a
definition of terms. And one of those,
in the writer's opinion, would be ac
tive citizenship. Evidently the un
known author of the article failed to
appreciate that in California women
have approximately the same civil
duties as the men. If this were not
so, mere differences in activities
should not be construed as passivity.
If their duties were confined to
training future citizens either in the
school room or in the home, women
still would be in need of the knowl
edge of that idealized citizenship
which Stanford alone, according to
"Mere Man," can teach.

Stanford Cannot
Banish 500
A certain "Mere Man" has shown
that he is not the intelligently far
sighted person that a Stanford man
should be. If Stanford's ideal is to
give "exceptional opportunities for in
tellectual development in order to
produce citizens of the highest order,"
it can not overlook one-hall' of the
citizens.
This "Merc Man" has ruined his
own argument by admitting that 90
per cent of the women students at
Stanford "will settle down to making
life pleasant and enjoyable for a hus
band and the inevitable youngsters."
It is the broad-minded, alert, capable
women, who have had training and
experience in a co-educational univer
sity such as Stanford, that become
the most useful and serviceable
women citizens, and the most capable
"Mothers of the Race."

Dark Ages are
Here Again
Heaven help us! Are the dark ages
with us again or is "Mere Man" just
trying to "start something?" Are
women once more to receive their
education "anywhere," so that man
may gain that national efficiency of
which he shouts? But just where is
this "anywhere" to be found in the
west, where the "500" can receive
their intellectual training "equally
well" as they do at Stanford.
There are many of us who would
gladly betake ourselves to an eastern
college, but the elusive dollar which
keeps many a mere man from Har
vard or Yale, keeps us likewise from
Wellesley, Vassar or Holyoke. But if
it ever comes to pass that our daugh
ter's daughters can not enter the
doors of Stanford, then may it come
to pass that the coming Stanford pro
vider of the family will have gained
by that time so great a degree of ef
ficiency that there may be nothing to
keep the daughters from going to
those institutions of the east which
DO give an education "equally well."

It appears to me that the article
concerning the elimination of women
from the University, as printed in the
Illustrated Review, is not to be taken
seriously either by members of the
"500" or others favoring co-education.
Tt believe it was designed not as a
practical policy, which the writer was
convinced should be enacted, but
rather as a drawing card for the Re
view. As such it has proved inter
estingly successful. The saner minded
of the Powers That Be and of the

student body realize, T believe, that,
the student of Stanford needs to ac
quire the art of meeting and dealing
with both men and women if he would
be successful after graduation. It
would be impractical to deprive the
average student of this advantage by
reorganizing the University for the

It appears to me that the article
concerning the elimination of women
from the University, as printed in the
Illustrated Review, is not to be taken
seriously either by members of the
"500" or others favoring co-education.
Tt believe it was designed not as a
practical policy, which the writer was
convinced should be enacted, but
rather as a drawing card for the Re
view. As such it has proved inter
estingly successful. The saner minded
of the Powers That Be and of the

student body realize, T believe, that,
the student of Stanford needs to ac
quire the art of meeting and dealing
with both men and women if he would
be successful after graduation. It
would be impractical to deprive the
average student of this advantage by
reorganizing the University for the
sake of the few Avho lack the judg
ment. and discretion necessary for the
proper equalization of time and
thought between friends and work.
Hester Robinson, 'IS.
With crys of "Heaven Help Us," and
questions of pertinent and sarcastic
tone, that run the whole gamut of the
subject co-education, the "eternal
feminine" assumes the austere role
of an eternal questioner. She has
risen to beseige "Mere Man" behind
his stronghold of anonymity, with
fiery darts that are the telling results
of feminine ire aroused to the nth de
gree.
"Is 'What of the Women Folks?'
Ultra-Modern?", "Are the Dark Ages
With Us Again?", "Is Mere Man Try
ing to Start Something?"—these and
many others of a like nature are
questions that remain unanswered,
like thunder clouds ready at any mo
ment to deluge the tribe of "mere
men" should they come out from am
bush.
Hut the 500 are not alone in their
sharp criticism of the illustrated Re
vie warticle. Professor John Maxson
Stillman has added his opinion to that
of Dr. Jordan's of yesterday, declar
ing that the argument advanced by
the anonymous writer are fallacious.
Following are the communications
which have been received today:

Thank God, or Leonardo da Vinci,

Scholarship of
Women Leads
Neither scholarship nor conduct
records among the Stanford men show
such a profusion of good-citizen ma
terial as to warrant the exclusion —at
least for many years to come—of five
hundred women from advantages
which (I beg to differ from the "Mere
Man,") they can NOT obtain "any
where." * Doris Estconrt, '17.
Review Article
Pru.ssia.nism
Is "What of the Women Folk" ultra
modern? Is its zest for national ef
ficiency post-Prussianism? Or is it
perhaps antideluvian ? Even in Bible
days the efficient feaster dropped a
few crumbs for the dogs, and the
most Israelitish harvester left some
straw for the gleaner. Either way it
is far enough from the simple women
who said, "The children of California
shall be my children."
Dare Stark, '17.
Writer's Points
Fallacious
In my opinion, three fundamental
fallacies underlie the arguments of "A
iMere Man" against coeducation at
Stanford.
First —That the vocational or pro
fessional side of a Stanford education
is the main result aimed at, instead
of character building and citizen de
veloping, by far the most important
aim.
Second —That, particularly in the
latter respect , the University educa
tion of women is of less importance
than that of men.
Third —That women can do as well
anywhere else than at Stanford any
more than can the men.
Professor .1. M. Stillman.
Women Have Full
Citizenship
If Socrates should be.here to waste
his time reading the logical (?) dis
cussion in the "Review" concerning
the advisability of eliminating women
from Stanford, he would doubtless
follow his custom of asking for a
definition of terms. And one of those,
in the writer's opinion, would be ac
tive citizenship. Evidently the un
known author of the article failed to
appreciate that in California women
have approximately the same civil
duties as the men. If this were not
so, mere differences in activities
should not be construed as passivity.
If their duties were confined to
training future citizens either in the
school room or in the home, women
still would be in need of the knowl
edge of that idealized citizenship
which Stanford alone, according to
"Mere Man," can teach.
Mildred Hannn, '17.
Stanford Cannot
Banish 500
A certain "Mere Man" has shown
that he is not the intelligently far
sighted person that a Stanford man
should be. If Stanford's ideal is to
give "exceptional opportunities for in
tellectual development in order to
produce citizens of the highest order,"
it can not overlook one-hall' of the
citizens.
This "Merc Man" has ruined his
own argument by admitting that 90
per cent of the women students at
Stanford "will settle down to making
life pleasant and enjoyable for a hus
band and the inevitable youngsters."
It is the broad-minded, alert, capable
women, who have had training and
experience in a co-educational univer
sity such as Stanford, that become
the most useful and serviceable
women citizens, and the most capable
"Mothers of the Race."
1 commend to this aspiring young
author's attention Dr. Jordan's book,
"The Woman and the University," and
the old, but ever timely saying, "The
hand that rocks the cradle rules the
world."
Esther Liversedge, gr.
Dark Ages are
Here Again
Heaven help us! Are the dark ages
with us again or is "Mere Man" just
trying to "start something?" Are
women once more to receive their
education "anywhere," so that man
may gain that national efficiency of
which he shouts? But just where is
this "anywhere" to be found in the
west, where the "500" can receive
their intellectual training "equally
well" as they do at Stanford.
There are many of us who would
gladly betake ourselves to an eastern
college, but the elusive dollar which
keeps many a mere man from Har
vard or Yale, keeps us likewise from
Wellesley, Vassar or Holyoke. But if
it ever comes to pass that our daugh
ter's daughters can not enter the
doors of Stanford, then may it come
to pass that the coming Stanford pro
vider of the family will have gained
by that time so great a degree of ef
ficiency that there may be nothing to
keep the daughters from going to
those institutions of the east which
DO give an education "equally well."
