# "500" Hurl . . . . . Sharp Darts . . . at Mere Man
## 
### 
With crys of "Heaven Help Us," and
questions of pertinent and sarcastic
tone, that run the whole gamut of the
subject co-education, the "eternal
feminine" assumes the austere role
of an eternal questioner. She has
risen to beseige "Mere Man" behind
his stronghold of anonymity, with
fiery darts that are the telling results
of feminine ire aroused to the nth de
gree.
"Is 'What of the Women Folks?'
Ultra-Modern?", "Are the Dark Ages
With Us Again?", "Is Mere Man Try
ing to Start Something?"—these and
many others of a like nature are
questions that remain unanswered,
like thunder clouds ready at any mo
ment to deluge the tribe of "mere
men" should they come out from am
bush.
Hut the 500 are not alone in their
sharp criticism of the illustrated Re
vie warticle. Professor John Maxson
Stillman has added his opinion to that
of Dr. Jordan's of yesterday, declar
ing that the argument advanced by
the anonymous writer are fallacious.
Following are the communications
which have been received today:
Mona Z,isa Smile
For Article
Thank God, or Leonardo da Vinci,
for creating that Mona Liso smile, —
for without it how could the five hun
dred face such "cold, clear logic" as
postulated by "A Mere Man" in the
current lllusrated?
Mary E. Steviek, '1(5.
Scholarship of
Women Leads
Neither scholarship nor conduct
records among the Stanford men show
such a profusion of good-citizen ma
terial as to warrant the exclusion —at
least for many years to come—of five
hundred women from advantages
which (I beg to differ from the "Mere
Man,") they can NOT obtain "any
where." * Doris Estconrt, '17.
Review Article
Pru.ssia.nism
Is "What of the Women Folk" ultra
modern? Is its zest for national ef
ficiency post-Prussianism? Or is it
perhaps antideluvian ? Even in Bible
days the efficient feaster dropped a
few crumbs for the dogs, and the
most Israelitish harvester left some
straw for the gleaner. Either way it
is far enough from the simple women
who said, "The children of California
shall be my children."
Dare Stark, '17.
Writer's Points
Fallacious
In my opinion, three fundamental
fallacies underlie the arguments of "A
iMere Man" against coeducation at
Stanford.
First —That the vocational or pro
fessional side of a Stanford education
is the main result aimed at, instead
of character building and citizen de
veloping, by far the most important
aim.
Second —That, particularly in the
latter respect , the University educa
tion of women is of less importance
than that of men.
Third —That women can do as well
anywhere else than at Stanford any
more than can the men.

Women Have Full
Citizenship
If Socrates should be.here to waste
his time reading the logical (?) dis

the advisability of eliminating women
from Stanford, he would doubtless
