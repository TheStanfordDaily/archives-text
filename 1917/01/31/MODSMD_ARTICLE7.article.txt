## Edith Harvey Delights Hearers With Songs at Tuesday Musicale 
### 
Three sonys by Miss Edith Harvey,
'17, and a trio by Miss Ruth Van Pelt,
ex-'l7, Miss Mabel Shellbach, '16, and
I). E. Shepardson, '17, were the out
standing features of the chamber con
cert given by the Stanford Music
Club last night in the Little Theater.
Miss Harvey well merited the place of
honor on the program, her singing of
the equisite "Depuis le Jour," from
Charpentier's "Louise," being especi
ally delightful. Miss Harvey has a
voice of remarkable range and qual
ity.
The trio, consisting of Miss Van
Pelt and Mr. Shepardson, violins, and
Miss Shellbach, piano, played Mosz
kowski's Suite, Opus 71. The four
movements were admirably executed.
Miss Shellbach's work in this num
ber was a feature of the program.
Shepardson also gave two violin solos,
of which Chaminade's "Serenada
Espagnole" was especially notable.
Though his harmonics were somewhat
roughly bowed in places, Mr. Shepard
son showed himself the master of his
instrument.
A highly effective piano selection
was Chopins' "Rain Drop Prelude,"
played by Miss Katherine Huntington,
'19. Miss Huntington's treatment of
this technically simple piece though
colorless in parts, was on the whole
exceptionally pleasing. Noel H.
Stearn, 'IS, sang Gertrude Ross' in
teresting "Desert Cycle" very effect
ively. He was assisted by the able
accompaniment of Miss Thurlyne Buf
fum, '18.
