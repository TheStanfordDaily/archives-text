# SOUTHERNERS DEFEATED BY 34-10 SCORE
## GAME DRAWS CROWD Substitutes and Varsity Have Little Trouble With Visitors 
### 
BEFORE one of the largest crowds
ever seen at a basketball game
at Stanford, the University of
Southern California went down to de
feat before the Cardinal quintet last
night, 34-10.
The opening of the game saw the
Stanford substitutes in the lineup in
place of the first varsity, and they
outplayed the southerners at every
angle of the game. Estes and Sulli
van were particularly effective, the
former by his accurate shooting, both
from the field and from fouls, and
the latter in starting successful plays
and in breaking up the plays of the
opponents. The score at the end of
the first half was 16 to 3.
Varsity (iocs lit Second Half.
The second period saw all the var
sity, with the exception of Dolan, in
the game, Sullivan remaining at
guard. Soon after the half started
Dolan went in, and he and Greve held
the U. S. C. score down by their con
sistent guarding. Honney was the
highest scorer, rolling up eight points
during the second half.
The game was slow throughout, and
team work was lacking on both sides.
Captain Henderson of the southerners
was injured shortly after the opening
of the game and was considerably
slower as a result than in the game
played in Los Angeles.
