dowment of $20,864,835.18, has been
increased $2,312,000.92 under the man
agement of the Hoard of Trustees
during the quarter-century since the
Stanfords established the University
; with tlioir original $20,000,000 grant.

ments such as the half-million dollar

■ ton Stanford.

This increase is indicated in the
annual financial report of Vander
lynn Stow, treasurer of the Univer
sity, which has just been made public.
A deficit of $30,185.74 is indicated
by the report, but it is explained that
this is merely a matter of bookkeep
ing, as this amount is more than cov-
I ered by deferred payments due the
University. If the amount duo had
been paid in on time there would
j have been a surplus on hand, as at
I (he close of former years.
; Taxes Are lligli.

erty except its bonds, its building ac
tually employed for instruction pur
poses, and 100 acres of land, 90 on
the campus and 10 occupied by the
Medical School in San Francisco.
Over a million dollars in cash on
hand is credited the University by the
treasurer's report. Three-quarters of
a million dollars was received just at
the time the report was made out.
This has since been reinvested. A
considerable amount of ready money
has been needed on account of build
ing operations on the campus and on
the Lane Hospital in San Francisco.
Salaries of the teaching half of the
University amounted to $523,815.36
last year, while departmental equip
ment cost $34,937.28. From the Jewel
fund income $25,148.31 was spent on
library books. Value of the educa
tional plant is $4,151,079.08, accord
ing to the report.
