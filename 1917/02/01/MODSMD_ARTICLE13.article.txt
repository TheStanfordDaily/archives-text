# AN APPRECIATION
## 
### 
Time was when our Faculty Com
mittee on Public Exercises existed for
the most part in name only. It was
more a decoration than a useful unit
in our life here at Stanford, securing
but few attractions. A glance at the
weekly calendar of University events
now, however, precludes the possibil
ity of any such statement. That the
committee is a live one, and is doing
remarkable work along the lines of
both education and amusement for tne
community is apparent.
It is a question whether this work
is appreciated by many of those whom
it is primarily intended to benefit.
Almost any evening in the fore part
of the week, the Little Theater is the
scene of an instructive lecture or en
tertaining program well worth atten
tion. These are not arranged with
out a good deal of work and trouble
on the part of the committee, and
should not be passed over lightly.
