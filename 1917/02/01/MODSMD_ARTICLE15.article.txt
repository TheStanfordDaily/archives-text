Dear Sir: Great is the astonish
ment of a graduate—especially of a
recent one —to find true issues ap
pearing 011 the campus horizon. It is
good for a community to have much
about which it may talk and the more
the Stanford campus talks the more it
will accomplish.
However, when a man speaks
through the public press he must
know his subject or bring misunder
standing in the train of his written
word. In regard to the recent Encina
Hall episode, displeasing as it was to
old dormitory men, there is every
reason to believe that good will come
from the boiling, moiling conversa
tions and press statements.
Encina men of the present or past
do resent, though, public utterances
either from a faculty member or stu
dent whose interests ever have been
that of the fraternity. In this (Tues
day) morning's paper Stanford men
found a printed communication, evi
dently released from the campus, re
garding the unfortunate Lum case. It
sounds excellent and has a good tone,
but-
Why should that letter-excerpt have
been published? it appears as if
someone Avere looking for patting on
the back. That letter was from a fra
ternity man—an able teacher —an ex
cellent figure in Stanford life. But
he never has been an Encina man,
and therefore his act brings naught
but resentment from Encina men, old
and younger. Encina men of the past
few generations do not discuss pub
licly the good and otherwise points in
fraternity life. In fact, they're rather
delicate In the way they erase it from
conversation when a non-Encina man
is present.
A recent article in the "Review"
seems somewhat out of place also,
coming as it does from the typewriter
of a fraternity man. Not that the ar
ticle was faulty to the extreme —only
It would sound better from a non-
Row student.
Through talk comes action.
Through unfavorable talk —given to
the public—comes disapproval of Stan
ford, Encina, the Row, Pally and every
other side of the University quad
rangle. Perhaps, if Encina men begin
requesting fraternity men through the
press to widen their outlook and take
in any man who appears on the
threshhold demanding admission to
their secrets, the other side of the
shield will quickly be shown.
Very sincerely,
HAROLD M. LEVY, '16.
