The Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Sir: Permit me to call to your at
tion a fallacy, in the "Illustrated Re
view," which is equally as absurd and
mischievous as that on the question
of co-education.
The said magazine asserts that the
presence of Orientals in Encina Hall
"would bring a jarring note into the
harmony of the club," on the ground
that "there is between the Oriental
and Caucasian people a social differ
ence which demands that a line be
drawn somewhere."
May 1 ask in this connection if
the Review is aware any jarring note
felt in the men's dormitories in the
Universities of Washington and Ore
gon as well as in some of the eastern
colleges where there are Chinese stu
dents? Or is is just a sensitive feel
ing peculiar only to a few students on
the campus, who hug such a strange
illusion about people of another race
and do not realize it themselves? Re
member such sensitiveness about so
cial difference and the rest of the

humbugs toward foreign students are
nothing short of a provincial prejudice
or racial antipathy that is both ex
tremely capricious and extremely un
reasonable. It is likewise destructive
of sound judgment.
The "Review" may make earnest ef
fort to produce the best argument pos
sible to justify its attitude, but there
is no dodging the fact that a few of
the American students are trying to
set up a standard a priori for an Ori
ental student just as you have done
toward a working man from Asia.
Such attitude is no more fair than
for a Chinese or Japanese student of
Stanford to draw a hasty generaliza
tion that a riff-raff or a "hobo" in the
Hostel at Palo Alto is the representa
tive type of an educated American.
But that is precisely what both the
"Chaparral" and the "Illustrated Re
view" have been doing of late by rail
ing at the Chinese students with ex
travagant and absurd burlesque and
parody in words and pictures. There
are no caricatures too idle for you
to draw and no fun-making too
idiotic for you to hurl at the Chinese
students, who represent just Â«is much
the "picked half million," to use a
phrase of Dr. Jordan, as you are in
America. Do you feel it right and
proper to laugh and chaff the
strangers within your gate, who are
your intellectual equals in every sense
of the word?
For lack of space I shall have to
defer the pleasure of saying more
upon the subject for another occas
ion.
Yours very truly,
J. D. BUSH, '17.
