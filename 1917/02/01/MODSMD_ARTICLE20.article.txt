banquet halls, a small dance hall, a
little theater, an alumni hall, and a

California l'rotits
On Football Season.
According to the financial report of
Graduate Manager Stroud of Cali
fornia, football brought in $36,400 to
the Blue and Gold treasury, and took
out $34,300, leaving a profit of $2100.
In comparison with the corresponding
figures of 1915 the receipts of the foot
ball season just closed are greater to
the extent of $25,000, while the ex
penses are $10,000 in excess of the
previous year. The increase in ex
penditures is attributed to the en
largement of the playing schedule, the
maintenance of the training table, the
purchase of equipment, and increase
in the coaching staff.
