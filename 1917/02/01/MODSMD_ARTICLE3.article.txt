# Co-Eds Required Says PoetInspir'd
## 
### 
I The Muse of Poetry has been
i awakened by the article by "Mere
Man," which appeared in the last is
sue of the lllutrated Review. The
following poem has been received by
The Daily Palo Alto:
rr Co-eds from Stanford are banished,
And the Queens from the Row disap
pear,
While Madrono is deserted and silent
And Roble is minus its cheer.
Then the men will grow dirty and
careless,
"Pop" Harris will go out of biz,
And Sticky's will have to go bank
rupt
For the lack of a call for their lizz.
The cigar store will do a fine busi
ness,
But Myres will move out with his
tubs,
For who would not save from the
makin's
A haircut, shave or a rub.
The "cords" sometimes cleaned each
semester,
The shirts that are washed twice a
yearâ€”
Will descend to a freshman frat
brother,
And grow precious as year follows
year.
Men will never wear coats in the
classroom,
Nor neckties, except by rare chance,
For the Co-eds will all be trans
ported,
And men will fear not the fair glance.
The Dean will have various troubles
To shelter Mere Man from all harm,
And classes will run every Sunday,
To keep the men here on the Farm.
But the Co-eds will never be banished,
Till the Quad is pushed into the bay,
Or another Stanford is founded,
Or finally "Mere Man" has his way.
P. W. 8., '18.
