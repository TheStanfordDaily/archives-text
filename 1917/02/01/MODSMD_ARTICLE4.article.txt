# Elect Milton Samis 1920 Track Captain
## 
### 
M. F. Samis, winner of the intcrclass
cross-country run last semester, was
elected captain of the freshmen track
team by the first year men, at Encina
gymnasium, yesterday afternoon. Only
about half of the thirty-two freshmen
who signed u]> were on band. Coach
"Ric" Templeton and Captain Aup
perle also spoke to the freshmen on
track prospects and urged that more
men sign up. The hurdles, it seems,
are especially lacking material, only
three men having signed up for these
I events.
