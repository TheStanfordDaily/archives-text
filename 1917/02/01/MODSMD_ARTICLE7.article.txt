# Women to Stage Swimming Meet
## 
### 
Plans are now complete for the
first swimming meet among Stanford
women, in which every sorority,
Madrono, Roble and La Liana are to
enter teams of four women, and tAvo
substitutes. Class and varsity teams
will be composed of those women
making the best showing in this pre
liminary meet, which will be held in
the middle of March.
The events will be as follows: 25
yard dash, 50 yard dash, and 220 yard
dash, all free style; 25 yard back
stroke, 50 yard breaststroke, relay

race, plunge for distance, and diving
contests.
Regular practice will begin next
week, each woman being required to
come out twice a week until the meet
to qualify for entrance. Every woman
who can swim is eligible for the try
outs, and intermediate and elementary
swimmers especially are urged to
practice up. Arrangements have been
made with Miss Greta Johannson, the
swimming instructor, for two extra
hours, 4:35 and 9:05 daily, when ad-
vanced swimmers may have special
practice. Those whose regular class
comes at another hour may substi
tute either of these practice hours
for a regular class. For all girls
who can swim the double arm-over,
an extra practice hour at 4: OR has
been arranged.
With the water heated to 72 de
grees every day, the principal objec
tion to regular swimming—the cold—
disappears, and prospects are bright
for a long list of eligibles for a close
and interesting meet six weeks hence.
