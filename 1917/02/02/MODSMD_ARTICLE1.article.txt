### 
THItEE baseball games will feature
tomorrow afternoon's sport cal
endar on the Stanford campus.
The varsity crosses willows with the
fast Olympic Club team, the freshmen
take on Palo Alto high school, and a
combined team of peanut league play
ers will meet Manzanita school. Both
the freshmen and varsity contests
will be staged on the Cardinal dia
mond, the first one being scheduled
for 1:30 and the main event slated for
3 o'clock. The other battle will take
place at 1:30 on the auxiliary lot. No
admission will be charged at this af
fair, but the fans will be required to
pay twenty-five cents or season tick
ets for the other two games, the one
admission answering for both.
Winged "0" Fast.
As was the case last season, the
Winged "O" aggregation is a fast ball
club. They have played two games
with the University of Santa Clara,
winning one and losing one. Manager
Bart Burke has many players out for
practice on the Olympic diamond, and
has developed a speedy team. He will
bring twenty men with him, and an-
nounces his lineup as follows: Med
craft, Lindley, Lorigan, Morrissey and
Howedge, ])itchers; Graham, Black
and Harrington, catchers; Norton, lb;
Maloney, 2d; McGrath, 3d; Rippon,
ss.; Tramutola, Cullen, Hart, Swarton,
Larkin and Kennedy, outfielders.
Nealon Umpire.
James J. Nealon will again umpire.
He is an expert with the Indicator,
and will give satisfaction. With vet
teran Jim handling the game, the fans
can he assured of a fast contest.
Coach Wilson and Captain "Doc"
Hayes have announced a few changes
in the Cardinal varsity. Shriver has
been moved from third base to sec
ond, Cowan from second to shortstop,
and Stevens from shortstop to third
base. With Mitchell 011 first, this
gives Stanford a remarkably strong
and speedy infield. All of the above
players are experienced at their posi
tions and should show the fans some
excellent work. Hocver will pitch,
with Campbell on the receiving end.
Dickey will play left field in place
of I3ihlman, while Lilly and Noonan
will cavort in center and right field,
respectively. Several substitutes will
go into the game before the nine in
nings have been completed.

ets for the other two games, the one
admission answering for both.
Winged "0" Fast.
As was the case last season, the
Winged "O" aggregation is a fast ball
club. They have played two games
with the University of Santa Clara,
winning one and losing one. Manager
Bart Burke has many players out for
practice on the Olympic diamond, and
has developed a speedy team. He will
bring twenty men with him, and an-
nounces his lineup as follows: Med
craft, Lindley, Lorigan, Morrissey and
Howedge, ])itchers; Graham, Black
and Harrington, catchers; Norton, lb;
Maloney, 2d; McGrath, 3d; Rippon,
ss.; Tramutola, Cullen, Hart, Swarton,
Larkin and Kennedy, outfielders.
Nealon Umpire.
James J. Nealon will again umpire.
He is an expert with the Indicator,
and will give satisfaction. With vet
teran Jim handling the game, the fans
can he assured of a fast contest.
Coach Wilson and Captain "Doc"
Hayes have announced a few changes
in the Cardinal varsity. Shriver has
been moved from third base to sec
ond, Cowan from second to shortstop,
and Stevens from shortstop to third
base. With Mitchell 011 first, this
gives Stanford a remarkably strong
and speedy infield. All of the above
players are experienced at their posi
tions and should show the fans some
excellent work. Hocver will pitch,
with Campbell on the receiving end.
Dickey will play left field in place
of I3ihlman, while Lilly and Noonan
will cavort in center and right field,
respectively. Several substitutes will
go into the game before the nine in
nings have been completed.
THItEE baseball games will feature
tomorrow afternoon's sport cal
endar on the Stanford campus.
The varsity crosses willows with the
fast Olympic Club team, the freshmen
take on Palo Alto high school, and a
combined team of peanut league play
ers will meet Manzanita school. Both
the freshmen and varsity contests
will be staged on the Cardinal dia
mond, the first one being scheduled
for 1:30 and the main event slated for
3 o'clock. The other battle will take
place at 1:30 on the auxiliary lot. No
admission will be charged at this af
fair, but the fans will be required to
pay twenty-five cents or season tick
ets for the other two games, the one
admission answering for both.
