# Interstate Basket Contest on Monday
## Washington State Opponent in First League Game for Championship 
### 
Stanford's varsity basketball team
faces one of the hardest parts of its
schedule in the games arranged for
the coming week. Tomorrow night
they go to San Francisco to meet St.
Ignatius in their regular game in the
California-Nevada Basketball League.
On Monday and Tuesday nights they
meet the strong quintet from Wash
ington State College.
The Pullman team should afford the
best competition given the varsity this
year. They won the championship of
Washington by -defeating the Univer
sity of Washington in four straight
games and are now coming south to
meet Stanford and California in a
series to decide the Pacific Coast Con
ference championship. They meet
California tonight and tomorrow
night. That the northerners have a
strong combination is granted by those
Stanford fans who saw the Univer
sity of Washington in action here last
year as state champions, for it was
sufficient proof of the brand of bas
ketball played in the Northwest.
The turnout at the University of
Southern California game last Wed
nesday night shows that Stanford fans
like basketball, and with as strong a
competitor as Washington State sched
uled, it is expected that the entire
spectators' space at Encina gymnas
ium will be filled.
The Washington State lineup will
be: Captain Boliler, center; Price and
Moss, forwards, and Copeland and Sor
enson, guards.
