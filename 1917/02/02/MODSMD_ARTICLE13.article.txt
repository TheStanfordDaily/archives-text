TWENTY-ONE men, eighteen of

San Francisco, Sunday, for
France, for service in the American
Ambulance Corps, to begin what
promises to be one of the greatest
humanitarian movements ever under
taken by a group of people of the
United States. The "Friends of
France" society, in which some of
the richest men of the west and mid
dle west hold membership, is sending
these men to France and maintaining
and paying their expenses while there.

ities of northern France after hostil
ities have ceased.
The rebuilding of the wasted por
tion of Prance promises to be as big,
if not bigger, than the Belgian Relief

tion as soon as peace comes.

back of the ambulance drivers is in
dicated by the officers at the head of
it. These are William 13. Bourn, pres

bulance drivers will have a special
car on the Union Pacific and Southern
Pacific railroads and will be given
every accommodation on these roads.

the richest men of the west and mid
dle west hold membership, is sending
