If some Stanford men were as
jealous of their reputation for good
sportsmanship as they are of that for
democracy, there would be no need
to protest against such an unhospit
able demonstration as that made at
the basketball game in the gymnas
ium last Wednesday evening. We
have a fair name for clean play,
and we should wish to keep it before
fame for victory. In the game with
the University of Southern California
there was considerable hooting and
jeering, intended to rattle the oppos
ing foul thrower. This probably ad
ded nothing to our victory, but con
tinuance of such tactics will doubtless
do much to hurt our good name,
much to lose. This protest has been
made before by others. We hope
there will be no need for a repetition
in the future.
