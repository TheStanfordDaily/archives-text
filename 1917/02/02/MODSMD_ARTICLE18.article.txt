# GOODBYE, GOOD LUCK!

### 
It is with a feeling of regret, tinged
slightly with envy, that we see
eighteen Stanford men start on their
way to the battlefields of France —to
a great experience. They leave many
friends behind, who will eagerly watch
their progress, and wish for their safe
return.
We join in this wish. May Stan
ford's men do a good work, as well as
reap some benefit from such a re
markable opportunity. Goodbye, good
luck!
