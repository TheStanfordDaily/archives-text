## Will Play Chinese Squad from California Campus Next Sunday 
### 
For the first time in the history of
Stanford University, a Japanese rugby
football team has been organized, to
compete with Oriental teams from
other colleges and organizations.
A challenge sent to the Chinese
rugby squad at California for a game
has been accepted with much enthus
iasm.
Arrangements have been made to
hold this contest Sunday afternoon at
2:30, on the St. Ignatius field.
Practice has been carried on on the
varsity turf by the newly formed
team for over a week, and a good deal
of interest has been shown by the
Japanese students in turning out for
the sport, enough men to make two
teams being on hand at practice.
