Annie Laurie, of the San Francisco
Call, has distinct opinions of her own
about women. She does not think
much of our "Mere Man," as the fol
lowing article will testify:
"Aside from the lazy and inefficient,
110 woman anticipates in marriage
anything but one of many interesting
experiences," says Miss Nellita Choate
of Stanford University.
There —Brother Griffin, also of
Stanford —now will you be good?
1 Brother Griffin is the young man
who says that Stanford will never
amount to a thing—until the women
are out of it.
He said it once, he said it twice, he
said it three times o'er —like the man
in the poem, and then he went and
printed it in the Illustrated Review,
a large and enthusiastic campus
paper—and, strange to say, the sun
rose 011 the morning after it and the
stars shone that night—and the world,
cold, hard and cyncal thing that it is,
whirled about on its axis—just the
same.
It must have been disappointing—
youth is so full of such sweet and
tender amusements—how cruel it is
to see them nipped in the bud by a
cold and uninterested public.
But there's Miss Choate—and then
again, there's Miss Anita Marcus, both
of them members of the Women's
Conference down at Palo Alto —they
read what Mr. Griffin said and they
were very cross about it —so are many
of the women students, so, after all,
the Illustrated Review article was not
published in vain.
Poor young Mr. Griffin—if I could
help remembering that the University
of Stanford was founded by a woman,
and that Mrs. Stanford, when things
looked black for the University, of
fered to pawn her jewels and dismiss
her personal maid to keep the institu
tion going—I wouldnt' be cross with
Mr. Griffin at all —I'd be sorry for
him.
Poor fellow—it is a trying and a
dangerous thing to be born ahead of
your times, but it is an awesome and
a tragic tiling to be born behind them.
What a terrible thing it must be to
come out of a dream of being a Dan
iel come to judgment and find your
self looked upon as just a nice, wist
ful Little Boy Blue, who's fallen
asleep on the sunny side of the hay
stack and never noticed that the sheep
were in the pasture and the cows were
in the corn—till it was too late to
chase them out again.
Wake up—Little Boy Blue —wake up
—quick—you and the rest of your
friends who find the comfort of the
sunshiny nap so dangerously over
powering—wake up—you can't keep
the cows out of the corn now, no
matter what you can do, but you
might hurry up and plant a new field
and sow a new pasture so there'll be
enough corn and enough grass to go
around for your own particular flock.
Whisper—this isn't a joke—it's
deep, dark, serious, practical earnest.
This isn't the year 1849 or even the
year 1860 —honestly, it isn't—why,
you can tell that just by looking in
the family album at home—shawls
have gone out, and so have spring
trousers and quilted neckties —and
such a lot of old-fashioned things have
gone out with them —honestly, they
have.
There isn't any woman question any
more, you know, at all —there's a
woman answer —haven't you ever read
about it in the papers?
Perhaps you don't approve of jour
nals or journalists—bless your soul,
boy, all you have is to look around
you—open your eyes wide —dear me,
it's astonishing how many interesting
things you'll be able to see.
Do you object to the Woman with
a Job—or is it only the women with
the highly paid job who is anathema
to you?
Tut —tut —brother —this is a prac
tical world and women are the
strangest creatures you ever saw —one
of the strangest things about them is
that they have to eat, and it costs
money to buy their food, and a girl
with a college education can earn
more money than she could without
it—and —there you are.
And there you are—or there you
aren't, as the case maybbit all de
pends upon you, yourself, and whether
you like to look at life as it is—or
whether you prefer to dream of it as
you wish it ought to be.
Little Boy Blue —coinc blow your
horn —but, please, sir, don't you think
you'd better learn a new tune to play
;, pon it?—l'm afraid nobody will
listen very seriously to the old one.
