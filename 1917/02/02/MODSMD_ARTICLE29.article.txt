# Interclass Swim to be a Close Contest
## Meet Postponed to Tuesday, Will Probably be Won by One of Lower Classes 
### 
That the interclass swim, which was
postponed until next Tuesday, will be
a close race between the freshmen and
sophomores, is indicated by this
week's workouts. This will be the
first meet of the year, and it will start
promptly at 4:30. Women are in
vited, and although it is early in the
season, reasonably fast time is ex
pected.
The freshmen looked to have the
best prospects until the Marathon re
sults were reported, and now the
sophomores look like winners. Pen
niman, '19, and McGaffney, '19, should
pull down the 50 and 100 yard events
for the second-year men, from Stew
art, '20, Balbach, '20, and Green, '20.
In the 220 the results are in doubt,
the freshmen entering Green, the
sophomores McGaffney, Berendsen and
J. Brokenshire, the juniors Ford, Ire
dell and G. Brokenshire, and the sen
iors Davids.
Rouse, '19, the winner of the Mara
thon, ought to get the backstroke, and
the breaststroke will furnish some
nice competition between Coonse, '20,
I'edley, '19, Stewart, '20, Wright, '19,
Sparling, '20, Coleman, '17, and Ree
her, '18.
Ostrandcr, '18, the veteran, appears
a winner in the plunge. Balbach, '20,
Kahle, '18, Rakestraw, '15, and Mont
gomery, '19, will fight it out in the
diving events.
The relay teams are fairly even, the
men entered being as follows: Fresh
men, Balbach, Stewart, Green, Consi
dine; sophomores, Penniman, Pelouze,
McGaffney, Daniels; juniors, Lee,
Ford, Iredell, Schlesinger; seniors,
Davids, Goldsmith, Field, Coleman.
