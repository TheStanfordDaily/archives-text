# Olympic 145 Pound Five To Play Frosh
## 
### 
Olympic Club's 145-pound basket
ball team will be the attraction to
morrow night at Encina gymnasium,
against the freshmen quintet.
The Olympic Club team lias bad the
advantage of playing together longer
than the freshmen aggregation, but
with the stiff workouts the Stanford
team has been taking since their
game last Saturday night they should
make a good showing.
Season tickets or fifteen cents will
admit.
