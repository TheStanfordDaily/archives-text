# League of Debating Societies Proposed
## 
### 
Formation of an inter-society de
bating league at Stanford, between
Nestoria, Women's Debating Society,
and Euphronia, was proposed in a let
ter yesterday written by S. S. Schnezt
ler, president of Nestoria, to the heads
of the other societies.
The letter suggests that triangular
debates be held between the three so
cieties in order to "render order out
of the present conditions of partial
disorder," and to add strength to the
already growing interest in debate at
Stanford.
Schnetzler suggests that a commit
tee be appointed by each president
and that an effective plan be drawn
up to govern the inter-society league.
