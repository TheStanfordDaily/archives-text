# U.S. Can Make War World Good Says Krehbiel
## 
### 
What United States will do in the I
present crisis with Germany, and
what would be the ideal thing to do,
in case the country is involved in
war, was pointed out today by Pro
fessor E. B. Krehbiel of the History
department.
"President Wilson will have to base
his actions on previous notes," said
Professor Krehbiel, "which resulted
in a warning from United States
against German submarine warfare,
and the acceptance of our policy by
Germany, with the provision that she
could reject them in case of a change
of conditions.
Would It Menn War?
"Now, following up our policy, we
will probably have to call the Ameri
can ambassador to Germany home,
and give the German ambassador his
passports. The question then is, can
this be taken as a declaration of war?
"If the nation considers it a mat
ter of honor, yes, though it is not
necessary to consider it war. It is
generally understood that Germany
would consider it a state of war. A
state of war might not mean actual
war. It would mean only the sup
pression of pro-German movements,
loans, and business in this country,
and probably the seizure of German
shipping by United States.
"On the sea the Germans would be
sinking our ships. -It would aid the
Germans in their submarine warfare
if they did not have to discriminate
before they attacked ships. Their ob
ject may partly be to prevent trans
portation to the Mediterranean, where
we have reason to believe the wjly will
be concentrated.
Our Warships Useless.
"The assumption is safe that we will
be attacked. We may send our war-
ships out to convoy shipping, which
would be at a great risk. The fact
that sixteen German sailors could run
the Yarrowdale into Germany shows
that the English battle fleet is being
kept in safety and out of the North
Sea.
"Capturing of submarines is done
by trawlers and a mosquito fleet, evi
dently. Except for mosquitos, which
are inexpensive, our fleet could do
little good to the Allies, for England
seems able to control the seas. Con
voying, the only work we can do with
ships, is dangerous.
We Might Float Loans,
"If wo wanted to do more, we
might float loans officially and furnish
the money for others to do the fight
ing. Supposing we send men. Should
they be independent or fight with the
Allies? Should we fight on the east
front or on the west front? An agree
ment would be the breaking of our
entangling alliance policy and of the
Monroe Doctrine. If we send men to
fight, we can bet our last dollar,
Europe will send men to meddle in
American affairs.
Nothing to Gain.
"If we go to war, there would be
nothing to reimburse us except money.
There is no German territory we
want. If we're out merely for prin
ciple, we might get Germany's sig
nature that she is sorry and will
never do it again, but that would be
no good.
"The point is this, there is no com
pensation we can get except defeating
the Germans, and the Allies triumph.
We are in a difficult position, for
when the Allies won we might think j
the new balance of power they would j
impose would be unfair.
What Would U. S. Do?
"We confront two theories of war,
the utmost use of powers to preserve
the life of a nation, and a more civ
ilized principle which says there is a
higher standard ol' morality than the
nation, or humanity. The question is,
what would we do if United States |
faced, as Germany does, national de
mise through failure to use weapons
at hand?
"But we might stand for something'
higher, not believing in the balance ofj
power, nor the taking of territory,
even if it is offered on a silver plat
ter, nor the taking of any money. We
can tell all nations we will join the
Allies and tight for a League of
Peace, to prevent any future war.
That is Utopian, but we could put
the world millions of hours ahead if
we did that. We could get force be
hind the co-operative unit to enforce
peace on earth.
"We can either do that, or else fight,
for a new balance of power. The lat
ter will be but a new array of power.
We should contribute something new,
rather than join the old system of
things."

the Yarrowdale into Germany shows
that the English battle fleet is being
kept in safety and out of the North
Sea.
"Capturing of submarines is done
by trawlers and a mosquito fleet, evi
dently. Except for mosquitos, which
are inexpensive, our fleet could do
little good to the Allies, for England
seems able to control the seas. Con
voying, the only work we can do with
ships, is dangerous.
We Might Float Loans,
"If wo wanted to do more, we
might float loans officially and furnish
the money for others to do the fight
ing. Supposing we send men. Should
they be independent or fight with the
Allies? Should we fight on the east
front or on the west front? An agree
ment would be the breaking of our
entangling alliance policy and of the
Monroe Doctrine. If we send men to
fight, we can bet our last dollar,
Europe will send men to meddle in
American affairs.
Nothing to Gain.
"If we go to war, there would be
nothing to reimburse us except money.
There is no German territory we
want. If we're out merely for prin
ciple, we might get Germany's sig
nature that she is sorry and will
never do it again, but that would be
no good.
"The point is this, there is no com
pensation we can get except defeating
the Germans, and the Allies triumph.
We are in a difficult position, for
when the Allies won we might think j
the new balance of power they would j
impose would be unfair.
What Would U. S. Do?
"We confront two theories of war,
the utmost use of powers to preserve
the life of a nation, and a more civ
ilized principle which says there is a
higher standard ol' morality than the
nation, or humanity. The question is,
what would we do if United States |
faced, as Germany does, national de
mise through failure to use weapons
at hand?
"But we might stand for something'
higher, not believing in the balance ofj
power, nor the taking of territory,
even if it is offered on a silver plat
ter, nor the taking of any money. We
can tell all nations we will join the
Allies and tight for a League of
Peace, to prevent any future war.
That is Utopian, but we could put
the world millions of hours ahead if
we did that. We could get force be
hind the co-operative unit to enforce
peace on earth.
"We can either do that, or else fight,
for a new balance of power. The lat
ter will be but a new array of power.
We should contribute something new,
rather than join the old system of
things."
