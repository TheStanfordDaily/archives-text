# Power House Whistle Will be Blown Daily
## 
### 
Business Manager J. E. Hewston to
day announced that the power house
whistle will blow once every night at
i) o'clock. Heretofore this whistle has
just been blown at noon, Saturday, or
for fires. It was discovered recently,
when the slight flue fire occurred at
the home of Professor Coover, that the
whistle refused to blow because it
was not used often enough. Conse
quently the decision has been made
to blow it every night.
