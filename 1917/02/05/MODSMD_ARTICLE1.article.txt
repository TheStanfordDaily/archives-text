# NINE LOSES 7-4 GAME TO OLYMPIC CLUB
## CONTEST A SLOW ONE Cardinal Fans See Flashes of Brilliant Playing During Diamond Tangle 
### 
SHOWING flashes that gladdened
the hearts of Stanford baseball
fans, and then again at inoppor
tune times displaying some of the
poorest diamond work ever forced
upon the patient hleacherites, the
Cardinal team lost to the Olympic
Club, Saturday afternoon, by a 7 to 4
score. The contest ran the full nine
innings, and contrary to most of the
games this season, was very slow, the
hour-hand in the scorer's Ingersoll
making two and a half revolutions be
fore the last man was tossed out.
Three Runs in First.
With Morrissey, the "Winged O"
heaver, wild as a March hare, the
local nine started the game like a
winner. They chalked up three tallies
in the first round from two walks, a
three-bagger by Lilly, and a wild
pitch. One run had been scored in
the visitors' half of the first frame on
an error at second, a single, a stolen
base, and an error at the plate.
Both teams scored in the third in
ning. Two singles, an out, and an
error brought two across for the win
ners, while the Cardinal scored one
on an infield hit, an out, and an error.
This was the end of the Stanford run
making. The Olympic Club chalked up
one in the fourth, and three more in
the sixth. All but one were unearned
runs.
New I ntiel«l Combination.
Coach Wilson tried out a new com
bination in the infield, and without
doubt, it worked much better than
the old one. Shriver at second, Cowan
at short, and Stevens at third, make
an infield that is fast and works well
together. Cowan and Stevens' field
ing was easily the feature of the game,
although Lilly pulled a running catch
in the outfield, while he, Braden and
Dickey were the batting stars of the
day.
Hoever pitched well for six innings,
and Draper showed excellent form
during the last three cantos. Both
twirlers were given poor support in
the pinches, the infielders falling down
when men were on the paths. Seven
runs on eight hits, some of them
scratchy, is not good baseball.
Captain "Doc" Hayes made his first
appearance on the diamond this year,
when he batted for Draper in the
ninth inning, lie was given a great
ovation by the fans. Although his
drive was pulled down by Tramutola
in deep left field, the skipper demon
strated that he has not forgotten how
to land on the horsehide.

SHOWING flashes that gladdened
the hearts of Stanford baseball
fans, and then again at inoppor
tune times displaying some of the
poorest diamond work ever forced
upon the patient hleacherites, the
Cardinal team lost to the Olympic
Club, Saturday afternoon, by a 7 to 4
score. The contest ran the full nine
innings, and contrary to most of the
games this season, was very slow, the
hour-hand in the scorer's Ingersoll
making two and a half revolutions be
fore the last man was tossed out.
Three Runs in First.
With Morrissey, the "Winged O"
heaver, wild as a March hare, the
local nine started the game like a
winner. They chalked up three tallies
in the first round from two walks, a
three-bagger by Lilly, and a wild
pitch. One run had been scored in
the visitors' half of the first frame on
an error at second, a single, a stolen
base, and an error at the plate.
Both teams scored in the third in
ning. Two singles, an out, and an
error brought two across for the win
ners, while the Cardinal scored one
on an infield hit, an out, and an error.
This was the end of the Stanford run
making. The Olympic Club chalked up
one in the fourth, and three more in
the sixth. All but one were unearned
runs.
New I ntiel«l Combination.
Coach Wilson tried out a new com
bination in the infield, and without
doubt, it worked much better than
the old one. Shriver at second, Cowan
at short, and Stevens at third, make
an infield that is fast and works well
together. Cowan and Stevens' field
ing was easily the feature of the game,
although Lilly pulled a running catch
in the outfield, while he, Braden and
Dickey were the batting stars of the
day.
Hoever pitched well for six innings,
and Draper showed excellent form
during the last three cantos. Both
twirlers were given poor support in
the pinches, the infielders falling down
when men were on the paths. Seven
runs on eight hits, some of them
scratchy, is not good baseball.
Captain "Doc" Hayes made his first
appearance on the diamond this year,
when he batted for Draper in the
ninth inning, lie was given a great
ovation by the fans. Although his
drive was pulled down by Tramutola
in deep left field, the skipper demon
strated that he has not forgotten how
to land on the horsehide.

tune times displaying some of the
poorest diamond work ever forced
upon the patient hleacherites, the
Cardinal team lost to the Olympic
Club, Saturday afternoon, by a 7 to 4
score. The contest ran the full nine
innings, and contrary to most of the
games this season, was very slow, the
hour-hand in the scorer's Ingersoll
making two and a half revolutions be
fore the last man was tossed out.
Three Runs in First.
With Morrissey, the "Winged O"
heaver, wild as a March hare, the
local nine started the game like a
winner. They chalked up three tallies
in the first round from two walks, a
three-bagger by Lilly, and a wild
pitch. One run had been scored in
the visitors' half of the first frame on
an error at second, a single, a stolen
base, and an error at the plate.
Both teams scored in the third in
ning. Two singles, an out, and an
error brought two across for the win
ners, while the Cardinal scored one
on an infield hit, an out, and an error.
This was the end of the Stanford run
making. The Olympic Club chalked up
one in the fourth, and three more in
the sixth. All but one were unearned
runs.
New I ntiel«l Combination.
Coach Wilson tried out a new com
bination in the infield, and without
doubt, it worked much better than
the old one. Shriver at second, Cowan
at short, and Stevens at third, make
an infield that is fast and works well
together. Cowan and Stevens' field
ing was easily the feature of the game,
although Lilly pulled a running catch
in the outfield, while he, Braden and
Dickey were the batting stars of the
day.
Hoever pitched well for six innings,
and Draper showed excellent form
during the last three cantos. Both
twirlers were given poor support in
the pinches, the infielders falling down
when men were on the paths. Seven
runs on eight hits, some of them
scratchy, is not good baseball.
Captain "Doc" Hayes made his first
appearance on the diamond this year,
when he batted for Draper in the
ninth inning, lie was given a great
ovation by the fans. Although his
drive was pulled down by Tramutola
in deep left field, the skipper demon
strated that he has not forgotten how
to land on the horsehide.
