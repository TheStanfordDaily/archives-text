# GREEK OSTRICHES

### 
Way back in the now almost for
gotten days of last semester, there
was, it seems, talk of an interfratern
ity conference and of legislation de
signed to correct some of the objec
tionable features of the fraternity
system as it now exists at Stanford.
What has become of all the zeal dis
played at that time? The passing of
days breeds forgetfulness, and safety
a feeling of security. Perhaps that
is why the plans came to naught. But
it is high time that fraternities pull
their heads out of the sand and do a
little thinking that will get results.
Something more is expected of
them under the new administration.
This is apparent, in spite of the fact
that they have existed about as always
for the past few months. There will
doubtless be a University ruling on
the business of taking new men in the
near future. Why shouldn't the fra
ternities have a voice in making that
rule? Two heads are better than one,
and if the fraternities co-operate
with the administration, there is every
reason to expect that the result will
be more effective, as well as more
palatable. The Greek letter societies
will, or ought to admit their own de
ficiencies, while the administration is
willing to be shown and is not only
open to suggestion, but will appreciate
any help offered.
This work, though important, is not
by any means the only excuse for the
formation of an interfraternity con
ference. Whatever the rule on pledg
ing, and however it is formulated,
there jvill be need of a conference to
help enforce it. Such a body might
also help solve the financial problems
of the fraternity. Why should there
not be co-operative buying among the
various organizations on the campus?
Why not a uniform system of audit
ing? These and other benefits could
be secured through the medium of an
interfraternity conference.
Are the fraternities alive to their
opportunity?
