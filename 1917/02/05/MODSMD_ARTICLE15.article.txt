to 27. Although the 1920 men were
on the short end of the score, their
showing promises well for their
games later, for the "Winged O" was
represented by some of the fastest
players around the bay.
Moulton for the freshmen was eas
ily the star of the contest, scoring
fifteen points. Although a little
player, he showed that he has the
necessary fight and basket-shooting
ability to make him a real star.

showed a lack of team work, but
Saturday it was only this feature of
their game and their close guarding
that kept the score down. Noyes and
Debenham at guards and O'Toole at
