# Freshman Nine Victors in 2-0 Game Over Palo Alto
## 
### 
Freshmen made it three in a row
over the Palo Alto High School base
ball team on the faculty diamond Sat
urday when they won their game 2 to
0 in the best contest put up by the
1920 aggregation this year. Only two
hits were allowed by Morse and Lit'ur
in the box for the freshmen, and in
addition the babes put up a good game
in the field.
The feature of the game was a long
hit by Galloway and a sensational peg
by Herdman, the Palo Alto center
fielder, to cut off the runner at the
plate. Galloway played a stellar
game, hitting out a stinging single in
addition to his long hit.
Johnny Lander, a member of the
varsity last year, but ineligible this
season, has taken charge of the 1920
team and his coaching is beginning
to show in the playing of the Fresh
men. Only one error was made, and
the two runs came as the result of
good playing on the bases in the game
Saturday.
