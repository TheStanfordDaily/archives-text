# Holman Wins First Tennis Tournament
## Freshman Candidates Make Good Showing in Preliminary Matches 
### 
Ritter Holman, '18, won the first
novice tennis tournament on the En
cina courts, Sunday morning, by de
feating D. N, Barry, '20, by a score
of G-2 and 6-3. Some surprisingly
good tennis was displayed in all the
matches, promising well for both the
varsity and freshmen teams to com
pete against California. Holman
should be a likely candidate for a
place on the big squad.
The semi-finals in the tournament
were between Holman and 13. C. Mc-
Cabe, '20, the win going to Holman
only after a hard fight, in which Mc-
Cabe put up a strong game. In the
other sets Barry won from C. R.
Seely, '20, by a score of G-l and 9-7.
Barry was the high school champion
of Los Angeles, and will undoubtedly
make a strong bid for the freshmen
team, although he was forced to the
limit in the second set by Seely.
All the matches were run off under
the direction of Captain Barber and
were held Friday afternoon, Saturday
morning and the finals Sunday.
Another tournament of a similar na
ture will be held in two weeks. Al
though there was a large turn-out for
these matches, Captain Barber is anx
ious that all tennis candidates sign
up for the next series.
