A cast of twenty—nineteen men and
one woman —was announced by Coach
Frank Mathieu today to appear in the
English Club and Masquers produc
tion of "Justice," three weeks from
next Friday evening.
Simultaneously with the selection of
the complete cast, came an announce
ment of immediate rehearsals. Today,
at 1 o'clock, the initial reading of
Galsworthy's intensive first act took
place in Assembly Hall.
To Gordon Davis, '18, is awarded
the role of William Falder. Davis'
masterful interpretation of Lou Max,
the fiend, in "Seven Keys to Bald
pate," last October, was a forecast of
what he will be as Falder.

I Hul'ord Williams, '10, to appear as
Frome, attorney for the defense, will
have to commit to memory the most
human, most gripping, and incident
ally, the longest stage monologue of
the present day stage.
Opposite Williams, representing the
state, will be Goodwin Knight, '19,
| As Cleaver, Knight will portray a mer
siless prosecutor, whose motto —as his
name might imply—seems to he "Hew
to the line of the law, and let the chips
of justice fall where they will."
On the bench will be R. N. Wenzel,
'16, as Justice Floyd. Wenzel has ap
peared many times on the Stanford
stage during the past four years.
