# GUERENA PICKS FRESHMAN EIGHTS
## 
### 
Sixteen freshmen have been chosen
by Coach "Husky" Guerena and Cap
tain Rix Maurer on the freshmen .squad
that is to work out at Redwood. The
list includes Stamp, McGilvray, Fin
ley, Tilton, Davis, Coonse, Tauzer,
Anderson, Wickersliam, McCormack,
Monroe, McCartney, James, Phillips
and Glen.
Tide conditions at Redwood are very
bad and as a result the 1920 men
worked out on Lagunita today, but all
practice will be in the eight-oared
shells on the bay when conditions im
prove. The varsity went to Redwood
for the first time last week, and be
ginning today, trii>s will lie in order
every day. The men who are in the
j first varsity at present are Maurer,

McEuen, Rogers, Andrews, Swarts,
Keller, Steinbeck, and Coleman.
Montgomery is acting as coxswain.
In the second varsity boat at pres
ent are King, Watts, LaForge, Rus
sel, Crocker, Johnson, Iredell and
Jeffers. In the workouts today Kelby
was in the coxswain position. During
practice last week LaForge, William-;
son and Taylor were in the first boat
several times.
Both varsity and freshmen squads
should turn out a strong combination.
The varsity have plenty of experience
and with such men as Maurer, Mc-
Euen, Rogers and several other vet
erans, the result of the races should
be victory for Stanford. The fresh
men will have a heavy team and if the
right amount of form is drilled into
them will have a strong weight.
