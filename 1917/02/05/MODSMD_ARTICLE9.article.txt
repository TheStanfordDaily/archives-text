# Professor Krehbiel to Lecture on War
## 
### 
A series of talks will be given by
prominent faculty men in the Stan
ford Union, beginning Friday evening,
when Professor E. 13. Krehbiel of the
History department will lecture on the
present war situation, according to
Manager "Tal" Smith, '14, of the Stan
ford Union.
With the exception of the Krehbiel
address, all of these meetings will be
held on Snnday evening. It is planned
that they will not conflict with the
series of Y. M. C. A. talks given at
Encina Hall, Sunday evening, the
probable solution of conflicts being to
make the two series of lectures come
on alternate Sunday evenings.
