# W.S.C. WINS OPENER FROM VARSITY FIVE
## 36-18 THE FINAL SCORE Teams Will Play Second Contest Tonight at Encina Gym at Eight O'clock 
### 
TEAMWORK and accurate passing
of the Washington State basket
ball team last night caused the
defeat of the Stanford varsity in the
first game of the series by a 36-18
score. The game was one of the fast
est ever seen on the local floor and
kept the crowd of spectators interested
from start to finish. The teams will
meet again tonight at the gymnasium
in the last game of the series, and the
brand of basketball displayed last
night is expected to again fill the gym
nasium.
Stanford Leads at Start.
Stanford started off with a rush,
rolling up eight points to Washing
ton's one in the first few minutes ot
play. From then on, however, the
Washington combination started work
ing and ended up the half in the lead,
16 to 14. Despite their hard, close
games with California, the visitors
were in excellent shape, and wore the
varsity out with their dazzling play.
They showed a science and teamwork
seldom seen here, but missed many
free shots after carrying the ball to
within shooting distance of the basket.
Second Half to Washington.
Washington had things her own
way in the second half, scoring 20
points to Stanford's 4. The opposition
teamwork was even more effective in
the second half than in the first, and
the players more successful in lo
eating the basket. Shortly after the
opening of the second half, Sullivan,
who had been playing a sensational
game at running guard, gave way to
Dolan. Roney received a slight in
jury in the leg and was forced to
withdraw from the game. Estes re
placed him. Righter later went in for
Wheatly at center, and Pelouze for
Bonney. Greve, the only Stanford
man who played the whole game, was
a big factor in keeping the Washing
ton score down, his work at standing
guard frequently breaking up plays
which looked to be good for baskets.
Price was Washington's biggest
point winner, registering seven bas
kets during the game. Captain Boh
ler, the big center of the visiting team,
was responsible for starting the plays
in Washington's teamwork. He was
mixed up in all the plays and fre
quently brought applause from the
spectators. Despite the hard, fast
play and the number of personal fouls
called, the game was remarkably free
from rough work.
The teams will meet again tonight
at the gymnasium, at 8 o'clock. Boek
of Oakland high school will referee.
