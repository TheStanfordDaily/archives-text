# AN EYESORE
## 
### 
Is there a rule prohibiting our
freshmen from cleaning up the re
mains of the rally bonfire until Senior
Week? We never heard of one, but
since it is never done until the butter
cups are in bloom, there must be some
reason. Perhaps it is a tradition. If
so, may the gods forgive us for sug
gesting that it be abandoned! For
four years, now, we have lived, to see
a charred mass of barrel hoops lie
for months forgotten, detracting from
the natural beauty of the Stanford Inn.
Assuming that there is no rule â€”no
we have a nice, clean backyard, at
least for the second semester.
Due to the early spring, the frosh
have got under way a little earlier
than usual, having cleaned up the
mess this afternoon; but we can't al
ways count on the help of the seasons.
May next year's freshmen class find a
more permanent and reliable inspira
tion!
