This crushing indictment of "Mere
Man," though somewhat late, is printed
as an example of clear reasoning
seldom found. Its tardiness is no
doubt due to the extreme difficulty in
expressing such cold and penetrating
logic.
"0 tempora, O mores! In Hoc
Signo Vinces! Let there be light!"
What is this soporific, post-ultra,an
archistic discourse "Mere Man" is ad
vancing? Such an amorphous ampli
plificated confusion can never amelior
ate or accomplish an amnesty.
Do I not confute his concoction?
"Remember the Maine!" Â»
LOGICAL LIL, '15.
