# Double Plays
## 
### 
Saturday's game with the Olympic
Club gave the bleacher warmers
plenty to talk about for the next few
days. Some of the fielding was re
markable, and at times the Stanford
aggregation looked like sure champ
pions. Without any warning, they
would then blow up and give an exhi
bition of truly weird baseball.
* * * * *
Mitchell looked very poor in the
fourth inning. He dropped a throw to
catch a runner and then, to make mat
ters worse, he stood talking to him
self while a "Winged O" player went
from second to home on the error.

One of the features of the last game
was the hitting of Dickey and Braden.
Both players had poor averages last
year, but are now hitting at the top
of the list. Dickey got a long triple
and a single, while Braden secured
two fast one-base swats.
*****
Something ought to be done about
starting the games on time. Three
o'clock is late enough to schedule a
contest, but when the umpire does not
call "play ball" until 3:35, the fans
are already tired.
* * * * *
Errors are expected at this stage of
the season, but seven is entirely too
many. The error column of the Stan
ford box score looks like the number
of times at bat in an ordinary score.
Second base seems to be the hoodoo
position. Four miscues were marked
against the two guardians of this sta
tion.
*****
Every time Draper steps into the
box he looks better. He has a world
of speed and good control. He allowed
but two hits in three innings, Satur
day, and no scores were made while
he was on the mound.
