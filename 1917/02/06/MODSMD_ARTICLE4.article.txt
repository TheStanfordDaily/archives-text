# "Justice" Date is Changed to Night Of Founders' Day
## 
### 
March 9, Founders' Day, has been
set for the date of the production of
"Justice," by English Club and Mas
quers Society, instead of March 2, the
date made public in previous an
nouncements.
March 2 has been discarded at the
request of President Wilbur and the
Y. M. C. A., in order not to interfere
with the scheduled program of Ray
mond Robins, who will deliver three
lectures at Stanford during the week
end beginning March 2.
Inasmuch as the joint celebration of
Founders' Day and the Twenty-fifth
Anniversary of the University is to be
held on Saturday, March 10, it is be
lieved that the combination of this
festival and a supreme cast in Gals
worthy's greatest drama, will prove a
drawing card for alumni to return to
the campus.
