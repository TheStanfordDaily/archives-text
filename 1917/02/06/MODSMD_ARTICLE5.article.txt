# New Athletic Board Holds First Meeting
## 
### 
Organization was effected by the
new Athletic Board of Control at its
first meeting last night. Although
this board has no official powers until
next fall, it was felt that a great deal
could be done before that time .n the
way of preparation.
Dr. Thomas M. Williams, '97, of
Palo Alto, was elected president of
the board, and T. E. Swigart, '17, was
chosen secretary. All members were
present except Rix Maurer, '17.
Discussion of the powers of the
board and of the problems that con
fronted it occupied the greater part
of the meeting. A committee, con
sisting of E. C. Bahrens, '14, T. E.
Swigart, '17, and Dr. Frank Angell,
was appointed to carefully review all
the athletic relations of the Univer
sity with other institutions, in the
light of existing agreements. This
will furnish a working basis for the
actions of the board when they assume
an official status next October.
