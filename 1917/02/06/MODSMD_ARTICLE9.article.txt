# "Hop" Will Be Big Event For Soldiers
## Military Ball, February 17, Will Be One of Year's Biggest Social Affairs 
### 
War, and war only, will prevent
the Stanford Military Ball from being
the biggest social event of the year,
according to H. C. Parker, '17, chair
man of the committee in charge of
the affair.
However, there is one thing beside
war that "will gum the deal" consider
ably, according to local Military and
Social experts. It is a problem of
statistics, which the Military men
could work out exactly.
Soldiers Making Programs.
There are almost three hundred
men in the Stanford militaty forces,
and practically all of them are mak
ing out programs for the ball, but out
side of the guests, a large number of
whom have accepted invitations, the
committee in charge doesn't know
how many to count on for the ball.
So the military experts have ap
pealed to the Press. The Press sees
but one solution for Ihe problem, that
every military man see his first ser
geant, or call at Wideman's and get
his ticket for said Military Hall. Thus
the Press seeks to boost matters for
the Military Ball.
