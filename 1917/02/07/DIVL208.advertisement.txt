Hi costalivin. Ca 1., Feb. 4, 1917.
Dear Son: I have found it, necessary to raise
your mother's allowance on account of the
increased price of foodstuffs. Undoubtedly
you are experiencing the same at your res
taurant. Therefore. I hereby add $5 to your
monthly allowance. Your father,
JOHN NIP.
I Stanford, 2-7-17 Cj
Dear Father: Father was right, but this q]
. time he is wrong. Stanford Inn —that's S
where I eat —has not raised its prices. 5j
How they do it I cannot understand, but Cj
everything is as good as always. I guess m
that's why there are more people eating h
there than ever before. Your loving son, jj]
