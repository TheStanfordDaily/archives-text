# EXPLANATION BY E.B. KREHBIEL PUBLISHED
## SITUATION OUTLINED Stanford Professor States Reason for Mass Meeting Held in Union 
### 
PROFESSOR E. 15. KREHBIEL,
in this article, gives an explana
tion of principles underlying the
following resolutions, presented at the
mass meeting in the Union, Monday
evening. This resolution, which has
been signed by many students, is j
being circulated for further signa-1
tures. It reads:
"The present crisis has confronted
the United States with the opportunity
of performing a supreme service for
mankind. This it can do if—rejecting
all thought of territorial acquisition,
punitive indemnity or a mere read
justment of the balance of power in
which it will necessarily be involved
—it shall put its whole heart and
strength behind the principles enun
ciated in the President's message of;
January 22, 1917, to the Senate, de-.
daring for a concert of powers to.
seek and to enforce justice.
"The undersigned heartily endorse
the President's suggestion that the
balance of power be supplanted by
the concert of power, and urge that
this principle be made the basis of our
foreign policy in this crisis."
Kherbiel's explanation follows:
There are today forty odd nations |
each of which believes itself possessed
of some superior virtue. When dif-1
ferences arise between them each sin-!
cerely contends that its cause is right
eous, compels its citizens to adopt the j
same point of view, and—extending !
conscription to Heaven—proclaims
God to be on its side. Being riglit
euos, its point of view must, accord
ing to moral law, be maintained.
And as there is 110 machinery for
reconciling these divergent views of
righteousness, each falls back on
force, and relies on the monstrous doc
trine that force decides, that might
makes right. From which it follows
that the only sin a nation can com
mit is to be weak, and that so long
as righteousness remains something
national or territorial there will be
war, and there can be no such thing
as equal existence of small nations.
Under the current conception of
righteousness as something national
maintained by force, the only means
that the combined wisdom of men has
tried for keeping the peace is the bal
ance of power. "Preparedness is the
best insurance against war." Peace
results from an equilibrium of nations.
But, alas! while declaiming about the
equilibrium as the safeguard of peace,
each nation is in practice defeating
its effective operation by seeking to be
better armed than every other; is in
a word, seeking to tilt the balance in
its favor. Thus the equilibrium is un
stable, is no equilibrium at all. Every
increase of strength by one power must
be met by a counter-increase of every
other in order to maintain the bal
ance. Thus what promised to be a
solution becomes a burden, and a
menace, and eventually leads, as it
has always led, to war.
The balance of power is therefore
a fraud as a method of maintaining
peace. It rests on competing force,
and competing force knows of 110
method of solution except war.
Not so with the concert of power.
Denying at the outset that righteous
ness is national, and competitive, it
holds that righteousness is universal
and co-operative. And if this right
eousness is to be sustained force must
cease to be national and competitive
and become co-operative. Then there
will no longer be force versus force,
with the evil brood of consequences
such as "might makes right," or the
trampling on weak states, but instead
a united force put behind the common
ideal of justice.
Tn the present crisis we face a
choice between the two. What does
the balance of power offer us? Ger
many has no territory we want;
money, beyond reparation, we should
be ashamed to ask. In the event of
hostilities there is no satisfaction for
us, unless we count our victory or that
of Great Britain, France and Russia
as adequate compensation. The bal
ance of power, however, will still re
main, and we shall more than ever be
in its toils, inasmuch as actual inter
vention in Europe will end our notion
of avoiding .entangling alliances and
the effectiveness of the Monroe Doc
trine. Consequenty, whatever satisfac
tion we may get from victory, we
shall still be as far as ever from that
peace which all men —civilian and
military—declare they profundly de
sire. Is it worth while to do no more
than keep this treadmill going- Have
the wealth, the strength, the idealism
of America nothing better than that
to offer?
America was founded by states
which, wearying of living in competi
tion under the balance of power, form
ed a concert of states. This is one of
America's great contributions to jus
tice, order and good government. Why
not remain true to this successful and
practical policy, and throw our sup
port to a concert of nations, as Presi
dent Wilson proposed in his address
to the Senate, which is the worthiest
and most progressively patriotic utter
ance of the whole war? By doing that
we shall eliminate the clash of force
against force, and shall put the joint
force behind the common welfare of
man. Force will then lose its malevo
lent features, will indeed virtually be
come police force. This is something
worth doing, a policy that will prove
a blessing to posterity, that will ad
vance democracy, a contribution
worthy of the traditions and the des
tiny of the United States.
To many this will seem like Utopia.
But it is the balance of power and
hell, or co-operation among nations
and Utopia. For myself, T prefer to
work for Utopia.

America was founded by states
which, wearying of living in competi
tion under the balance of power, form
ed a concert of states. This is one of
America's great contributions to jus
tice, order and good government. Why
not remain true to this successful and
practical policy, and throw our sup
port to a concert of nations, as Presi
dent Wilson proposed in his address
to the Senate, which is the worthiest
and most progressively patriotic utter
ance of the whole war? By doing that
we shall eliminate the clash of force
against force, and shall put the joint
force behind the common welfare of
man. Force will then lose its malevo
lent features, will indeed virtually be
come police force. This is something
worth doing, a policy that will prove
a blessing to posterity, that will ad
vance democracy, a contribution
worthy of the traditions and the des
tiny of the United States.
To many this will seem like Utopia.
But it is the balance of power and
hell, or co-operation among nations
and Utopia. For myself, T prefer to
work for Utopia.
PROFESSOR E. 15. KREHBIEL,
in this article, gives an explana
tion of principles underlying the
following resolutions, presented at the
mass meeting in the Union, Monday
evening. This resolution, which has
been signed by many students, is j
being circulated for further signa-1
tures. It reads:
"The present crisis has confronted
the United States with the opportunity
of performing a supreme service for
mankind. This it can do if—rejecting
all thought of territorial acquisition,
punitive indemnity or a mere read
justment of the balance of power in
which it will necessarily be involved
—it shall put its whole heart and
strength behind the principles enun
ciated in the President's message of;
January 22, 1917, to the Senate, de-.
daring for a concert of powers to.
seek and to enforce justice.
"The undersigned heartily endorse
the President's suggestion that the
balance of power be supplanted by
the concert of power, and urge that
this principle be made the basis of our
foreign policy in this crisis."
Kherbiel's explanation follows:
There are today forty odd nations |
each of which believes itself possessed
of some superior virtue. When dif-1
ferences arise between them each sin-!
cerely contends that its cause is right
eous, compels its citizens to adopt the j
same point of view, and—extending !
conscription to Heaven—proclaims
God to be on its side. Being riglit
euos, its point of view must, accord
ing to moral law, be maintained.
And as there is 110 machinery for
reconciling these divergent views of
righteousness, each falls back on
force, and relies on the monstrous doc
trine that force decides, that might
makes right. From which it follows
that the only sin a nation can com
mit is to be weak, and that so long
as righteousness remains something
national or territorial there will be
war, and there can be no such thing
as equal existence of small nations.
Under the current conception of
righteousness as something national
maintained by force, the only means
that the combined wisdom of men has
tried for keeping the peace is the bal
ance of power. "Preparedness is the
best insurance against war." Peace
results from an equilibrium of nations.
But, alas! while declaiming about the
equilibrium as the safeguard of peace,
each nation is in practice defeating
its effective operation by seeking to be
better armed than every other; is in
a word, seeking to tilt the balance in
its favor. Thus the equilibrium is un
stable, is no equilibrium at all. Every
increase of strength by one power must
be met by a counter-increase of every
other in order to maintain the bal
ance. Thus what promised to be a
solution becomes a burden, and a
menace, and eventually leads, as it
has always led, to war.
The balance of power is therefore
a fraud as a method of maintaining
peace. It rests on competing force,
and competing force knows of 110
method of solution except war.
Not so with the concert of power.
Denying at the outset that righteous
ness is national, and competitive, it
holds that righteousness is universal
and co-operative. And if this right
eousness is to be sustained force must
cease to be national and competitive
and become co-operative. Then there
will no longer be force versus force,
with the evil brood of consequences
such as "might makes right," or the
trampling on weak states, but instead
a united force put behind the common
ideal of justice.
Tn the present crisis we face a
choice between the two. What does
the balance of power offer us? Ger
many has no territory we want;
money, beyond reparation, we should
be ashamed to ask. In the event of
hostilities there is no satisfaction for
us, unless we count our victory or that
of Great Britain, France and Russia
as adequate compensation. The bal
ance of power, however, will still re
main, and we shall more than ever be
in its toils, inasmuch as actual inter

a word, seeking to tilt the balance in
its favor. Thus the equilibrium is un
stable, is no equilibrium at all. Every
increase of strength by one power must
be met by a counter-increase of every
other in order to maintain the bal
ance. Thus what promised to be a
solution becomes a burden, and a
menace, and eventually leads, as it
has always led, to war.
The balance of power is therefore
a fraud as a method of maintaining
peace. It rests on competing force,
and competing force knows of 110
method of solution except war.
Not so with the concert of power.
Denying at the outset that righteous
ness is national, and competitive, it
holds that righteousness is universal
and co-operative. And if this right
eousness is to be sustained force must
cease to be national and competitive
and become co-operative. Then there
will no longer be force versus force,
with the evil brood of consequences
such as "might makes right," or the
trampling on weak states, but instead
a united force put behind the common
ideal of justice.
Tn the present crisis we face a
choice between the two. What does
the balance of power offer us? Ger
many has no territory we want;
money, beyond reparation, we should
be ashamed to ask. In the event of
hostilities there is no satisfaction for
us, unless we count our victory or that
of Great Britain, France and Russia
as adequate compensation. The bal
ance of power, however, will still re
main, and we shall more than ever be
in its toils, inasmuch as actual inter
vention in Europe will end our notion
of avoiding .entangling alliances and
the effectiveness of the Monroe Doc
trine. Consequenty, whatever satisfac
tion we may get from victory, we
shall still be as far as ever from that
peace which all men —civilian and
military—declare they profundly de
sire. Is it worth while to do no more
than keep this treadmill going- Have
the wealth, the strength, the idealism
of America nothing better than that
to offer?
America was founded by states
which, wearying of living in competi
tion under the balance of power, form
ed a concert of states. This is one of
America's great contributions to jus
tice, order and good government. Why
not remain true to this successful and
practical policy, and throw our sup
port to a concert of nations, as Presi
dent Wilson proposed in his address
to the Senate, which is the worthiest
and most progressively patriotic utter
ance of the whole war? By doing that
we shall eliminate the clash of force
against force, and shall put the joint
force behind the common welfare of
man. Force will then lose its malevo
lent features, will indeed virtually be
come police force. This is something
worth doing, a policy that will prove
a blessing to posterity, that will ad
vance democracy, a contribution
worthy of the traditions and the des
tiny of the United States.
To many this will seem like Utopia.
But it is the balance of power and
hell, or co-operation among nations
and Utopia. For myself, T prefer to
work for Utopia.
PROFESSOR E. 15. KREHBIEL,
in this article, gives an explana
tion of principles underlying the
following resolutions, presented at the
mass meeting in the Union, Monday
evening. This resolution, which has
been signed by many students, is j
being circulated for further signa-1
tures. It reads:
"The present crisis has confronted
the United States with the opportunity
of performing a supreme service for
mankind. This it can do if—rejecting
all thought of territorial acquisition,
punitive indemnity or a mere read
justment of the balance of power in
which it will necessarily be involved
—it shall put its whole heart and
strength behind the principles enun
ciated in the President's message of;
January 22, 1917, to the Senate, de-.
daring for a concert of powers to.
seek and to enforce justice.
"The undersigned heartily endorse
the President's suggestion that the
balance of power be supplanted by
the concert of power, and urge that
this principle be made the basis of our
foreign policy in this crisis."
Kherbiel's explanation follows:
There are today forty odd nations |
each of which believes itself possessed
of some superior virtue. When dif-1
ferences arise between them each sin-!
cerely contends that its cause is right
eous, compels its citizens to adopt the j
same point of view, and—extending !
conscription to Heaven—proclaims
God to be on its side. Being riglit
euos, its point of view must, accord
ing to moral law, be maintained.
And as there is 110 machinery for
reconciling these divergent views of
righteousness, each falls back on
force, and relies on the monstrous doc
trine that force decides, that might
makes right. From which it follows
that the only sin a nation can com
mit is to be weak, and that so long
as righteousness remains something
national or territorial there will be
war, and there can be no such thing
as equal existence of small nations.
Under the current conception of
righteousness as something national
maintained by force, the only means
that the combined wisdom of men has
tried for keeping the peace is the bal
ance of power. "Preparedness is the
best insurance against war." Peace
results from an equilibrium of nations.
But, alas! while declaiming about the
equilibrium as the safeguard of peace,
each nation is in practice defeating
its effective operation by seeking to be
better armed than every other; is in
a word, seeking to tilt the balance in
its favor. Thus the equilibrium is un
stable, is no equilibrium at all. Every
