# STANFORD AGAIN DEFEATED BY VISITORS
## LEADS IN FIRST HALF Washington State College Wins Fast Basketball Game by 23 to 15 Score. 
### 
WASHINGTON STATE won the
second game from the Stan-
I'ord varsity last night, at the
gymnasium, by a 23-15 score. Stan
ford showed to much better advant
age than in the first game and played
a more interesting contest from a
spectator's point of view. The Card
inal quintet led during the opening
period, the score standing 9 to 6 in
their favor at half-time.
First Half Stanford's.
As in Monday night's game, Stanford
did her best playing in the first half.
The n;cn opened up in their play and
the bunching up, which was so ap
parent in the first game, was largely
done away with. As a result they
showed much better teamwork. Greve
and Sullivan, at the guard positions,
both played excellent basketball, and
were largely responsible for keeping
down the Washington score. Time
after time these men broke through
the Washington combination and
started the ball down the floor for a
basket. Sullivan's long shot from the
center of the floor was one of the fea
tures of the same.
Holder Stsirs.
Captain Bohler of the northern team
was the star for the visitors in the
second half, scoring seven points, lie
was largely responsible for the ex
cellent teamwork of the visitors, as
the plays seemed to he built around
him. Washington retained the same
lineup throughout the game, while
three substitutes went in for Stan
ford, Sullivan and Greve playing the
whole game.
The Washington State squad, with
their coach, leave the campus today
for Oregon, where they will play three
more games in the Conference sched
ule. The Stanford quintet rests until
Saturday night, when it goes to Berke
ley for the opening game with Cali
fornia.
