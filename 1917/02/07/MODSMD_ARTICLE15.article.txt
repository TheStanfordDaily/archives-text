# STANFORD FIRST
## 
### 
Stanford has proven herself awake
to what is going 011 in the world, by
the endorsement of President Wilson's
policy in regard to the present war
crisis. So often a university merits
a reputation for provincialism, that
we are glad to see this University
alive to the vital issues of the day, in
stead of sitting smugly wrapped in a
blanket of ancient history, dreaming
of things past. It surely does no
harm to forget dead issues for a time
when we are making history about as
fast as it ever was made. Stanford
is fortunate in having faculty men
who are capable and eager to take
the initiative in such a matter as this,
and it is to be hoped that other uni
versities will respond to the call for
support.
This plan for a lasting world peace,
is no theoretical dream. It is based
on sound concepts. Militarists and
pacifists alike subscribe to it, a fact
which in itself proves that the idea
has merit. Students of Stanford
should be proud that this institution
has taken the lead in an effort to se
cure endorsement for the plan among
the universities and schools of the
country. First, then, let every Stan
ford man put his name to the resolu
tions adopted last Monday evening. If
110 one presents you with a copy, take
steps to find one for yourself.
