# Baskets

### 
One of the best features of the
Tuesday contest was the referee.
The game was kept on the move all
the time and there was almost no
"crabbing" at the decisions.
Either the Washington State players
are in better condition than the Stan
ford men or their coach is able to put
an extra amount of fight into them be
tween halves, for after the interval
in each game the northern players
came back and won in the second
period.
*****
"Red" Greve and Sullivan put up a
game at guard that, has not been
equaled this year. Time after time
plays that looked good for baskets
were broken up by one or both of
these men.
*****
A big disappointment in the series
was the failure of Bonney to convert
his foul tries in his usual manner.
* * * * Ik
Coach Bohler only brought six
men with him on the trip, and the
one substitute was putin only once
in the four games played. The five
men show the results of their men
tor's system, however, for they had
the teamwork game developed to the
highest point.
*****
The last game was played at a kill
ing pace all the time. It seemed im
possible at times to follow the ball,
the passing and shooting was so fast.
*****
Four games were played by Wash
ington State in five days, and yet they
seemed as fresh after the contest last
night as they did when they first took
the floor, Monday.
*****
The northern team looks good for
the Conference title, having won four
games and lost one at present. From
their playing here it is plain why they
were able to defeat the fast Univer
sity of Washington quintet in four
straight games.
