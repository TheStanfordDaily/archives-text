# Future of Poland is Big Problem of War
## History of Slavs Reviewed by Dr. George R. Noyes Last Night 
### 
"The question of Poland will be one
of the most pressing factors at the
conclusion of the present war in
Europe," Dr. George It. Noyfis, asso
ciate professor of Slavic Languages
at the University of California, told
an audience in the Little Theater last
night. "The Slavic Peoples and the
War" was the subject of Dr. Noyes'
lecture, and he outlined in brief the
history of the Slavic nations of the
Balkan Peninsula and t he north of
Europe, explaining their sympathies in
the present war.
"Poland has two enemies, Germany
and Russia," Dr. Noyes said. "The
Russian rule in Poland has been
marked by cruelty, brutality and
slaughter, but in spite of the Russians,
the little country has prospered. The
Poles desire an independent and free
country, but they prefer Russian dom
ination to German, as it is incompe
tent and bribable, and is not consist
ent and steady like the German."
Dr. Noyes said further that the
Russo-Turkish war of 1 <S77 would be
a convenient starting place for the
tracing of developments which have
led up to tiie present war. The Treaty
of San Sfephano brought the war to a
close in 1X7S, but was protested by
Orpnt Hritnin and another treaty sun-
erseded it in the same year. This
was the Treaty of Berlin, which, Dr.
Noyes said, "sowed the seeds of dis
cord in the Balkans that have broken
out in the present time. Tt is inter
esting to note," he continued, "that
the Treaty of Berlin was predomin
antly the work of England."
