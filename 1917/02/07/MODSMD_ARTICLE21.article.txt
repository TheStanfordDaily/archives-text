# Palo Alto High to Play Freshman Five
## 
### 
Palo Alto high school and the fresh
men will tangle in their first basket
ball game of the season, tomorrow
night, in Encina gymnasium. Grad
uate Manager Behrens announces that
either fifteen cents or season tickets
will be required for admission.
The freshmen will in all probability
line up as in the game against the
Olympic Club. Moulton and Hood at
forward, Toole at center, and Deben
ham and Nayes at guard, was the way
they took the floor, ana the combina
tion was very effective.
Palo Alto is an unknown quantity
this year but they always put up a
good fight for the 1920 team in all the
sports, and the game tomorrow should
be no exception.
