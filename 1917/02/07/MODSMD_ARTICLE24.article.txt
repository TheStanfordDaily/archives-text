## 
### 
Through the efforts of Coach H. W. J
Maloney, the first string players of j
the Stanford and California soccer
teams have joined forces and have en
tered the annual Cup Tie Series under
the name of the "Allies."
Twelve teams from San Francisco
and vicinity compete in this event,
which is held under the auspices of
the California Football Association.
To the winner of this series goes a
large silver trophy.
The "Allies" were lucky enough in
the drawing to escape the preliminary
round, and will meet the "Barbarians"
on February 20, in the first frame.
Each team entered in the competi
tion will receive an equal share of
the proceeds and Coach H. W. Maloney
! declares that Stanford's share will go
toward the furtherance of soccer at
Stanford.
Maloney is very active in soccer
circles, being chairman of the execu
tive committee of the California Foot
ball Association and president of the
University Soccer Club League.
