# Dancers Tire Gus Hoever's Pitching Arm
## 
### 
"Mere Man" was right, at least he
was to Gus Hoever's way of thinking.
Gus is against the presence of the
"500," against dances and all such af
fairs, for the combined force of these
is inducive to the weakening of his
pitching arm. It happened in this
wise.
Gus walked into the training house
with an expression symbolic of dire
pain on his face, the other day, sup
porting his armjn a sling. The pain
was so great he moaned.
"Why, what's the matter, Gus?
Been in an accident?" queried Fritz
Roth.
Hoover Is Worried.
"O my arm, my arm," moaned Gus,
on the verge of tears. "I'll never be
able to lift it again, much less pitch."
Fritz looked at the arm. To his sur
prise and dismay lie found nothing
wrong with it. Every time lie touched
the flesh, Gus twitched and moaned,
but Fritz found no ligaments out of
place, no tendons pulled, and no
muscles bound.
"What are you doing, kidding me?"
he asked truculently.
"No," answered Gus. "You see, we
had a dance last night, and I had to
support all those heavy girls on my
right arm all night long, and the
strain was too great."
Fritz inundated the arm with an
evil-smelling substance usually used to
clean floors, and (Jus left with a smile
on his face.
