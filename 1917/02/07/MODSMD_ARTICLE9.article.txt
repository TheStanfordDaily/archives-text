### 
Herbert C. Hoover, '95, chairman of
the American Commission for Relief
in Pelguim, gave his first public ad
dress in the United States since hos
tilities broke out in Europe, before
the State Chamber of Commerce in
New York, Monday. He urged the
American people to do their share in
providing $0,000,000 a month, which
will be used to aid the helpless Bel
gians, and to be ready to loan an ad
ded $10,000,000, which will, however,
be repaid.
"The justification of American
riches can only be her requital of the
obligation which comes with riches,
and this requital should not be alone
her duty but should be her crown."
