# VARSITY WINS FROM SWAIN & SHEEHANS
## FAST EIGHT INNINGS Matti and Draper Allow One Hit in 2 to 1 Victory Over Independents 
### 
STANFORD defeated Swain & Shee
han's Independents yesterday af
ternoon by a 2 to 1 score, in eight
innings of the speediest baseball dis
played this season. The win was a
lluke, and came in the last frame, after
the game was as much as lost. Cliff
Ireland came down with the visitors,
and played second base. He was bet
ter than ever, and had not only the
fans, but both teams on their toes
throughout the contest.
The game was a pitcher's battle, the
Independents securing but one hit off
of Mattei and Draper, while Stanford
obtained four bingles with "Dutch"
Reuther and Mails on the mound.
Two of these hits were of the scratchy
older.
Three Errors for Fifth.
Stanford played errorless ball in all
innings except the fifth, when a com
bination of three errors in succession
allowed Harry Krause to score the
visitors' only tally. In the eighth
frame, with one down and Braden and
Campbell on second and third, Wilk
ins was sent in to bat for Draper.
Mails is credited with having as much
speed as any pitcher heaving today.
He wound up and cut loose. Lassater
could not hold the fast balls, especi
ally as the big southpaw was wild.
Wilkins struck at a wide one, and
when Lassater let it get away from
him, both Campbell and Braden
scored, winning the game.
Mails fanned seven out of the nine
