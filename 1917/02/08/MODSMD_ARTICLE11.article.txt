# Informal Dance to Be Given by Union
## 
### 
An informal dance is in line for
the second "Dance De Luxe" to be
given by the Stanford Union on Fri
day, February 23. Several Union
members agitated the giving cf a for
mal dance on this date, but as not a
sufficient number signified their inten
tion of attending, the management de
cided that it should be informal.
Novel ideas in the way of decora
tions and entertainment are planned.
The University Quartette, consisting
of F. J. Galliano, '18, L. H. Davis, '18,
C. F. Joyce, '16, and E. M. Bernstein,
'20, has consented to give a number of
selections between dances. Tom Rey
nold's orchestra has been secured to
furnish the syncopated harmony for
the occasion. Sixteen dances and two
extras arc announced for the pro
gram. Union members who are plan
ning to attend should sign up for the
dance at the Union Cigar stand imme
diately, as the number is limited.
