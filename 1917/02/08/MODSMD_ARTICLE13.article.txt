# DEMOCRACY'S GREAT NEED IS LEADERS
## C.H. ROWELL SPEAKER Progressive Party Leader Tells of Great Deficiencies in Government 
### 
DECLARING that the "One su
preme need of democracy is
leadership," Chester H. Rowell,
editor, former professor, and one of
the leaders of the Progressive party,
addressed an interested audience in
Assembly Hall this morning on the
general subject of "Leadership in a
Democracy."
Mr. Howell, himself an example of
the present day constructive type of
leader, was introduced by President
Wilbur, who said that "one of the
things for Stanford to do is to pro
duce men like Rowell."
Need for Leadership.
In launching into his subject, in
which he reviewed the deficiencies in
the past and present organization of
state and local government, Mr. Row
ell took a rap at "the old-time, sheep
like partisanship of our fathers," and
indicated the need for an intelligent
leadership to lead governments out of
the rut of inefficiency into which they
have fallen. California, he indicated,
had passed one era in this type of
leadership, and the new era which is
opening will mean a general upheaval
in the machinery and organization of
government.
Present Government Weak.
His analysis of the present organ
ization of the state government show
ed his complete mastery of the sub
ject and ability to point out the weak
points. In speaking of this he com
pared the state to an automobile, with
all gears locked, and being dragged
by oxen.
In conclusion he spoke of the re
form in the business attitude toward
the public, which he characterized as
being at the present time "one of ser
vice." "Sane idealism in business is
as big a field of leadership as political
leadership,' was his challenge to col
lege men of the present generation.
Professor Willis Speaks.
Professor Railey Willis spoke brief
ly as the first speaker of the assem
bly, showing the immense reach of the
American Red Cross in its three fields
of providing supplies for the naval
base hospitals, nurses, and relief to
soldiers at the front. He appealed for
the interest of all the students in the
local Red Cross organization and an
evidence of that interest by member
ship. "A one hundred per cent mem
bership would put Stanford in the
forefront in this humane work," he
said. Memberships, he explained,
could be purchased at the Stanford
Bookstore for $1.00. The assembly
closed with "Hail, Stanford, Hail," led
by the Glee Club.

Professor Willis Speaks.
Professor Railey Willis spoke brief
ly as the first speaker of the assem
bly, showing the immense reach of the
American Red Cross in its three fields
of providing supplies for the naval
base hospitals, nurses, and relief to
soldiers at the front. He appealed for
the interest of all the students in the
local Red Cross organization and an
evidence of that interest by member
ship. "A one hundred per cent mem
bership would put Stanford in the
forefront in this humane work," he
said. Memberships, he explained,
could be purchased at the Stanford
Bookstore for $1.00. The assembly
closed with "Hail, Stanford, Hail," led
by the Glee Club.
DECLARING that the "One su
preme need of democracy is
leadership," Chester H. Rowell,
editor, former professor, and one of
the leaders of the Progressive party,
addressed an interested audience in
Assembly Hall this morning on the
general subject of "Leadership in a
Democracy."
Mr. Howell, himself an example of
the present day constructive type of
leader, was introduced by President
Wilbur, who said that "one of the
things for Stanford to do is to pro
duce men like Rowell."
Need for Leadership.
In launching into his subject, in
which he reviewed the deficiencies in
the past and present organization of
state and local government, Mr. Row
ell took a rap at "the old-time, sheep
like partisanship of our fathers," and
indicated the need for an intelligent
leadership to lead governments out of
the rut of inefficiency into which they
have fallen. California, he indicated,
had passed one era in this type of
leadership, and the new era which is
opening will mean a general upheaval
in the machinery and organization of
government.
Present Government Weak.
His analysis of the present organ
ization of the state government show
ed his complete mastery of the sub
ject and ability to point out the weak
points. In speaking of this he com
pared the state to an automobile, with
all gears locked, and being dragged
by oxen.
In conclusion he spoke of the re
form in the business attitude toward
the public, which he characterized as
being at the present time "one of ser
vice." "Sane idealism in business is
as big a field of leadership as political
leadership,' was his challenge to col
lege men of the present generation.
