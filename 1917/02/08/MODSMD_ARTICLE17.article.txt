# SENIOR WEEK
## 
### 
With the appointment of commit
tees by President Ames, the class of
'17 has made the last start of its un
dergraduate history. The goal is a
successful Senior Week. Whether
that goal will be reached depends on
several things, all within the control
of the individual members of the class.
It is in their power to make these final
festivities the best ever. We hope the
power will be exercised.
Perhaps the chief consideration is
the attitude which will be taken by
those who are on the committees, if
they sit back and let the chairmen
do all the worrying and all the work,
Senior Week will be a failure. These
are jobs, not merely honors, and
should be accepted as such.
The dollar is still another consider
ation, the importance of which cannot
be overemphasized. The Senior Class
has voted an assessment of three and
a half dollars for each member. In
these unsettled times, that is a large
sum to let go of all at once, but the
fate of Senior Week hangs on a thread
of gold. The money must be collected,
and that fact might as well be faced
squarely. The tax collector can't be
continually dodged, if Senior Week is
to be up to par.
Each member of the Senior Class
has a duty toward the class. May that
duty be fulfilled.
