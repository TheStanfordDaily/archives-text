# Peanut Leaguers Tie for Pennant
## 
### 
With two and a half weeks of the
Peanut league's schedule already
played off, three teams are fighting for
the leadership, two of them being tied
for first place, with the third aggre
gation just a fraction of a game be
hind. The fourth team seems hope
lessly out of it.
The Whites, led by "Copy" Wright,
and the Blues, managed by "Zip"
Melcon, are tied for the first position
with five games won and three lost
apiece. They have played a tie game.
"Stinch" Cass, with his Reds, is close
011 the heels of the two leaders with
six and four, while Andy Smith's
Blacks have a two-eight standing.
Games this year have seen some
exceptionally good playing and hot
rivalry. The end of this week, in
which the Whites and Blues are
scheduled for two more games, will
see one of them dropping below, per
haps to third place, unless they break
even. In that event the Reds, who
are playing two games against the
Blacks, will probably assume the lead
er's position.
The games are being played on the
faculty and auxiliary diamonds, the
White-Blue clash being scheduled for
the former and the Red-Black contests
for the latter.
