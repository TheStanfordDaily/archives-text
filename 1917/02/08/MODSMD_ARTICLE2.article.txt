## Outlines Training and Duties of Profession in Little Theatre 
### 
"There is no more interesting job
in the world than that of city man
ager," says Thomas H. Reed, city
manager of San .lose, who spoke in
the Little Theater last night under
the auspices of the vocational guid
ance committee. Mr. Reed's subject
was "Municipal Management as a
Profession," and was the first, of a
series of lectures to be given through
this committee.
"[ know of no better way of becom
ing a city manager than by taking a
good course in engineering, with mu
nicipal and corporation law, history,
economics, and sociology," Mr. Reed
said. "Rut there is no standard way
of preparing yomself. Any education
is good, and you can't get too much
of it.
"A city manager must have a fairly
thick skin, but not so thick that ho
can't sense in a general way what
the public thinks of him. lie must have
certain qualities of popular leader
ship. and a large element of tact.
Executive capacity and constructive
ability are essentials to a city mali
nger, and he must be a man of vision,
to bo able to see something beyond
the mechanics of his profession, lie
should also have a willingness to
grasj), retain, and use material which
conies before him. He must have
courage,â€”he's got to know how to fire
a man.
"Is city management here to stay?"
Mr. Reed himself answered the ques
tion. "I believe it is. There are go
ing to be more city managers. The
plan will work because it is practical
and reasonable. There is no profes
sion that ought to appeal more to the
zeal and enthusiasm of young men.
You can't expect to start at the top,
but there is a wide variety of muni
cipal positions for which we are now
coming to look to the universities to
fill with trained men."
