# Track Men to Stage Medley Relay Race
## 
### 
Stanford track men will hold the
first meet of any sort Saturday morn
ing, at 10 o'clock, when a medley
relay race is scheduled by Coach
Templeton and Captain Aupperle. All
men desiring to enter this race are
urged to show up at the track on Sat
urday morning.
Plans at present are for three relay
squads to be picked, but this will de
pend, of course, on the number of
men on hand to start. The relay
will start with 220 yard runners, in
all probability, then 352, then 440, and
so on, depending on whether a large
number of sprinters, quarter-milers or
distance men are on hand.
In accordance with the plan of hav
ing some speaker address the men
each week, President Wilbur will
speak tomorrow afternoon at 4:45, to
the squad, on "Athletics in American
Universities." Anyone is invited to
attend these track lecturcs, whether
a member of the track squad or not.
