# Stanford Soccerites Lose Two Contests
## 
### 
Last night's indoor soccer games re
sulted in two defeats for Stanford and
showed the teams their weak points.
The "Rangers" brought Team "B"
into camp by a score of 4 to 2. During
the first half the visitors chalked up
three goals and the Stanford men one,
while the second period resulted in a
goal apiece. 1.1. Taylor, '20, and W.
E. Spengeman, '19, were responsible
for Stanford's two goals.
Team "A" lined up against San
Francisco and the half ended with no
score on either side. Things took on
a little more speed during the second
term, Stanford kicing one goal to two
by their opponents. 10. D. Sherwin,
'17, made the only tally for Team "H."
