Lineup Aiiiiounceri.
Coach Wilson announced this after
noon that the team will probably line
up as follows: Uonney and Roney,
forwards; Wheatly, center; Sullivan
and fireve, guards, with Pelouze and
Estes, substitute forwards; Righter,
substitute center, and Dolan and Lytle
to send in for guards. Some changes
may be made in the first lineup at the
I last minute, depending on the way
| the California five starts.
Varsity Shows Improvement.
Stanford looked better, Tuesday
night, in their second game against
Washington State, than at any time
.since their return from southern Cali
fornia, and if that game is any cri
terion of their condition, should give
California a hunt for the series. Bon
ney has struck his stride and is meet
ing with better success in shooting
fouls than in the early season games.
Roney has not had much luck in shoot
ing baskets lately, but should come
around before Saturday night's game.
Captain Wheatly ran up against one
of the best centers on the coast, in
the Washington State series. He will
doubtless be able to make a better
showing against the Blue and Gold
quintet. In Greve, Sullivan and Dolan,
Stanford lias the strongest combina
tion of guards ever seen here.
California has a veteran team this
year, and has made a strong showing
this season. Stanford always plays
better against California than any
other team, and can be depended upon
to push California to the limit Satur
day night.
Fans have had little chance to see
the freshmen in action this year.
They are showing excellent team
work, and if they can follow it up
with baskets, should come out on the
long end of the score. They will play
at least two practice games before the
series starts to get in condition for
the big contests.
