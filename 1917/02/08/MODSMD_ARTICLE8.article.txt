j meet of the season. Graduate Man
ager Behrens announces that season

I required to secure admittance.
Coach Mraiidsten Pessimistic.
Swimming Coach Brandsten is
| rather pessimistic about the outcome
iof the meet, as the visitors include
I some of the best swimmers on the
I coast, but varsity men in the inter
class swim on Tuesday made good
| time and can make better if forced to
extend themselves. W. Grace, of the
Piedmont team, is one of the fastest
men in short distances on the coast,
and G. Sundman holds the Pacific
I Coast championship in the breast
: stroke. The visitors are also strong
in the backstroke, and in the dis
| tanc.es W. Spencer will probably give
the varsity men a fast race.
