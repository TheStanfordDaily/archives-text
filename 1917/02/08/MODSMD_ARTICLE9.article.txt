# Poughkeepsie Races Will Be Shortened
## Action of Board of Stewards for New Eligibility Rules to Be Enforced 
### 
Beginning with the intercollegiate
regatta at Poughkeepsie on June 21
of this year, the four-mile race which
has been rowed for several years, will
be abandoned in favor of the three
mile event, was the action of the
Hoard of Stewards of the race at their
meeting recently. In addition to
shortening the distance of the annual
event, eligibility rules have been
adopted by the men in charge of the
event, eliminating all rowers who
have competed on club eights from
the regatta until they have been in
the university a year.
The action of the stewards in re
ducing the distance of the race will
mean a large extension of invitations
to join the regatta. Princeton and the
Navy have always held out on ac
count of the long grind and now these
men will be able to compete with the
winner of the Pacific Coast champion
ship, Cornell, Columbia, Pennsylvania
and Syracuse.
In adopting the new eligibility rules,
the stewards have eliminated one of
the most objectionable features of the
meet, that of having club men in the
boats. Syracuse, especially, has used
club men, and the rule will be a hard
blow to her.
