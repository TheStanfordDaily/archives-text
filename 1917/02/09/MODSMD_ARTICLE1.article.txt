illustrate Professor Krehbiel's talk
this evening on the present situation
on all fronts'of the European war
and on the status of the United States
in regard to the war. Stereopticon

An intensely interesting lecturer, Dr.

the real war conditions and their sig

on this side of the continent.

Treat On Japanese Question.
Just as Professor Krehbiel has
specialized in the study of the Euro
pean war, so has Professor Treat
specialized in the study of the Jap

country, and especially in its relation
to the United States, the subject on
which he will speak at the Union,
Sunday evening, at 7:30. The Y. M.

Professor Treat's lecture at the
Union.
A number of other interesting talks
will be given at the Union later in
the semester.
