# ARRANGE SECOND TENNIS TOURNEY
## 
### 
Tennis activities will begin in earn
est at once, according to Captain
Aliyn Barber, '18. A second novice
tournament is scheduled for tbe next
week-end, while the interclass and
interfraternity matches will be run off
in the near future, with the result
that a good line on the men can be
gained for the varsity team to be
picked later.
In the novice tournament last week
some new players were uncovered who
will make a strong bid for places on

tbe varsity and freshmen teams. Cap
tain Harber believes that there are
other strong players who have not
shown up yet, and for this reason
wishes everyone who can handle a
racquet to enter the matches Friday
and Saturday.
The first round will be run off Fri
day afternoon and the remainder Sat
day afternoon and the remainder Sat
urday morning. Hitter Holrnan, win
ner last Saturday, will not be allowed
to participate Friday, giving everyone
an equal chance to lead the tourna
ment.
The interclass series will be run off
the last of this month, the exact date
to lie announced later. All the classes
have a strong lineup, and some close
matches are expected. The interfra
ternity and interclub tournament will
be run off two or three weeks after the
games between the classes.
Both varsity and freshmen candi
dates have taken advantage of the
good weather the last few days, and
some real workouts have been held
under Captain Barber's supervision.
The winners of last week's tourna
ment have shown up especially well.
