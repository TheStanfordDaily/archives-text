## "BABES" MEET S.J.H.S. Fast Double-header Scheduled For Cardinal Diamond. Single Admission 
### 
SOME of the best baseball of the
present season will be dished up
to the Cardinal fans tomorrow af
ternoon, when the varsity and fresh
men play in a double-header against
St. Mary's and San Jose high school.
Both games will be played in the af
ternoon on the Stanford diamond, the
freshmen contest starting at 1:30, and
the varsity game beginning at 3
o'clock. Twenty-five cents or season
tickets will admit to both games.
SI. Mary's Always Fast.
St. Mary's has always had one of
the fastest college baseball teams in
the country. Scarcely a season goes
by, but one or two of the Phoenix
tossers go to the major leagues. This
year, the Oakland nine is a fast aggre
gation, although minus the services
of Guisto, the fence-bnster, now with
Cleveland, and Maliar, now with the
University of Santa Clara. Other
wise, their team is the same as when
they faced Stanford last season. The
contest tomorrow is the first of a
series. Last year, Stanford nosed a
victory over St. Mary's in a hard
fought game, played in the rain.
Coach Wilson is hopeful of another
win when the two squads oppose each
other tomorrow.
Coach Wilson and Captain "Doc"
Hayes announce that the Cardinal
tossers will line up as they did in the
mid-week game, with the exceptions
that Shriver will be back at second,
and Lilly will be in center field.
Hoever will take the mound, and is
confident of sending the St. Mary's
players back to the bench in one-two
three order. Campbell will catch,
Mitchell will be at first, Shriver at
second, Stevens on third, and Cowan
at short. Dickey, Lilly and Noonan
will cover the outfield.
San Jose high school will bring a
strong team to oppose the freshmen.
Last year the freshmen defeated the
Garden City delegation by a 7 to 6
score, and the visitors will have prac
tically the same lineup against the
"babes" tomorrow that played on the
Cardinal lot last season. Paul, the
opposing pitcher, has made an envi
able reputation in the Mission League,
twirling for Monterey. The remainder
of the team include players of experi
ence, and should give the freshmen a
hard game.
Johnny Lander, who is coaching the
1920 squad, announces his lineup as
follows: Lifur in the box, Joerg be
hind the log, Loreson on first, in the
absence of Bill Pike; Hunter at sec
ond, Galloway at short, and Tehan
on third. Wayland, Howes and Cass
will chase the fly balls.

ond, Galloway at short, and Tehan
on third. Wayland, Howes and Cass
will chase the fly balls.
SOME of the best baseball of the
present season will be dished up
to the Cardinal fans tomorrow af
ternoon, when the varsity and fresh
men play in a double-header against
St. Mary's and San Jose high school.
Both games will be played in the af
ternoon on the Stanford diamond, the
freshmen contest starting at 1:30, and
the varsity game beginning at 3
o'clock. Twenty-five cents or season
tickets will admit to both games.
SI. Mary's Always Fast.
St. Mary's has always had one of
the fastest college baseball teams in
the country. Scarcely a season goes
by, but one or two of the Phoenix
tossers go to the major leagues. This
year, the Oakland nine is a fast aggre
gation, although minus the services
of Guisto, the fence-bnster, now with
Cleveland, and Maliar, now with the
University of Santa Clara. Other
wise, their team is the same as when
they faced Stanford last season. The
contest tomorrow is the first of a
series. Last year, Stanford nosed a
victory over St. Mary's in a hard
fought game, played in the rain.
Coach Wilson is hopeful of another
win when the two squads oppose each
other tomorrow.
Coach Wilson and Captain "Doc"
Hayes announce that the Cardinal
tossers will line up as they did in the
mid-week game, with the exceptions
that Shriver will be back at second,
and Lilly will be in center field.
Hoever will take the mound, and is
confident of sending the St. Mary's
players back to the bench in one-two
three order. Campbell will catch,
Mitchell will be at first, Shriver at
second, Stevens on third, and Cowan
at short. Dickey, Lilly and Noonan
will cover the outfield.
San Jose high school will bring a
strong team to oppose the freshmen.
Last year the freshmen defeated the
Garden City delegation by a 7 to 6
score, and the visitors will have prac
tically the same lineup against the
"babes" tomorrow that played on the
Cardinal lot last season. Paul, the
opposing pitcher, has made an envi
able reputation in the Mission League,
twirling for Monterey. The remainder
of the team include players of experi
ence, and should give the freshmen a
hard game.
Johnny Lander, who is coaching the
1920 squad, announces his lineup as
follows: Lifur in the box, Joerg be
hind the log, Loreson on first, in the
absence of Bill Pike; Hunter at sec
ond, Galloway at short, and Tehan
on third. Wayland, Howes and Cass
will chase the fly balls.
