# ST. MARY'S TO PLAY VARSITY ON SATURDAY
## "BABES" MEET S.J.H.S. Fast Double-header Scheduled For Cardinal Diamond. Single Admission 
### 
SOME of the best baseball of the
present season will be dished up
to the Cardinal fans tomorrow af
ternoon, when the varsity and fresh
men play in a double-header against
St. Mary's and San Jose high school.
Both games will be played in the af
ternoon on the Stanford diamond, the
freshmen contest starting at 1:30, and
the varsity game beginning at 3
o'clock. Twenty-five cents or season
tickets will admit to both games.
SI. Mary's Always Fast.
St. Mary's has always had one of
the fastest college baseball teams in
the country. Scarcely a season goes
by, but one or two of the Phoenix
tossers go to the major leagues. This
year, the Oakland nine is a fast aggre
gation, although minus the services
of Guisto, the fence-bnster, now with
Cleveland, and Maliar, now with the
University of Santa Clara. Other
wise, their team is the same as when
they faced Stanford last season. The
contest tomorrow is the first of a
series. Last year, Stanford nosed a
victory over St. Mary's in a hard
fought game, played in the rain.
