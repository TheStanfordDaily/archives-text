# Rowell Speaks to Campus Journalists
## Fresno Editor Talks at Banquet Held at Inn Under Press Club Auspices 
### 
."Sporting news is the final triumph
of the newspaper," Chester H. Row
ell, editor of the Fresno Republican,
told several members of the faculty
and representatives of campus publi
cations and others who gathered last
night around the banquet board to
hear one of the best known newspaper
men in the west. The talk was given
under the auspices of Press Club.
"In accuracy and thoroughness
there is 110 news in existence that
approaches the sporting news," he
continued, and added that "when the
people demand the same accuracy in
other news they will get it."
During the course of his talk, Mr.
Rowell recalled a number of inci
dents that happened during his long
career as newspaper editor. He told
of the difficulty encountered in hand
linn certain aspiring journalists, who
have as an only recommendation the
ability to write, but who fail to get
the impersonal news style. "Literary
gents," they were dubbed in the news
paper office, he said.
The effect of newspaper policy on
the success of the paper was very
strikingly explained by Mr. Rowell,
who related a number of examples of
which he was personally familiar.
Wrong policy, as expressed through
the editorial page, Mr. Rowell indi
cated, is more apt to lead to business
failure than anything else.
President Wilbur introduced the
speaker of the evening. Other mem
bers of the faculty present were Pro
fessors E. D. Adams, E. B. Krehbiel
of the History department, W. H. Car
ruth, Assistant Professor E. W. Smith
