In these days of the mid-semester
examination, and in the frenzy of
getting at least a feeble grasp on the
elusive honor point, we are apt to
have our fill of the prosaic things of
life by the time the week-end rolls
around. Lectures of any kind are us
ually placed in this category, and are
shunned without fair trial because they
are lectures. For this reason, a word
of warning in regard to the series of
talks to be given in the Union, may
not be amiss. We are convinced from
past experience that these will be well
worth attention from every man in
the University, from the viewpoint of
entertainment as well as education.
Tonight, Professor Krehbiel will
talk on a subject of interest to all—
the war situation. Sunday evening
Professor Treat will hold forth on
the Japanese question, another live
topic. • These are the first two of a
series which members of the Stanford
faculty have consented to give during
the next few weeks. It is a rare op
portunity to hear these men, authori
ties in their own fields, on present
day topics, and to forget for a time
that Alexander pined for more worlds
to conquer, or that Caesar crossed
the Rubicon.
