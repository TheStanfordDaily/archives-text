# Freshman Track Men Slow in Turning Out
## 
### 
Freshmen track men signed up fifty
strong, at the preliminary rally, but
Milton Samis, 1920 captain, complains
that only about one-third of that num
ber are practicing regularly on the
track.
Hurdlers, both high and low, broad
jumpers, pole vaulters, and weight
men, are urgently needed by the
freshmen. There is some promising
material out for the dashes and dis
tances and the high jump, and Coach
"Ric" Templeton is devoting his time
at this period of the season to helping
men on the rudiments of track
events, with a view of encouraging
and developing new material.
