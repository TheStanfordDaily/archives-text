# Swimmers to Meet Piedmont Tomorrow
## Crowd Expected to See Varsity Water Splashers Race Athletic Club 
### 
A large crowd is expected to be on
hand at the first big swimming meet of
the season, Saturday at 2 o'clock,
when the varsity meets the Piedmont
Athletic Club team. The admission is
a season ticket or twenty-five cents,
and the moveable bleachers used in
the gym at basketball games will be
placed about the pool to accommodate
the spectators. Coach Brandsten says
he is particularly anxious that the
five hundred turn out strong.
Piedmont Team Fast.
Piedmont Athletic Club is bringing
down an exceptionally last team of
swimmers, and will give the varsity a
hard race. The Cardinal men showed
good form for this time of the season
at the interclass, last Tuesday, but
the Piedmont swimmers have been
training all winter, and are in top
form.
Penniman, * Stanford's fast 50 and
100 yard man, is depended on to get
points in his events, but will have
to exceed his present record to beat
Grace, the Piedmont crack. The vis
itors ought to win the breaststroke, as
they have entered Sundman, the Pa-
cific Coast champion, in this event.
Kendricks of the 'Piedmont clan is
conceded the backstroke.
Balbach and Kahle ought to win in
the diving event. Captain Goldsmith
did 58 feet in the plunge last Tues
day, and can do hotter, if he has to, to
win. Coach Brandsten has entered
some fast men in the relay, and this,
the last race and usually the most ex
citing of all races, will probably be
the deciding race of the meet.
