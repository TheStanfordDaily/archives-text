Coach Wilson is putting his men
through light practice and workouts
to improve defects that were evident
in the Washington State series, today,
and the team should be in the best of
condition Saturday night.

Friday's contest will mark the first
time that varsities from the Univer
sity of California and Stanford have
met in an intercollegiate game this
year. The Berkeley men are con
fident of winning after the Washing
ton State series, but the hard-figliting
Cardinal players will make them go
to the very limit to roll up more
points than Stanford.

Captain Wheatly at center looks bet
ter in every game. He is a strong
man on defense and an accurate shot
on long baskets.
*****
With Roney and Bonney at forward
a good many points should be chalked
up for the Cardinal. Bonney is al
ways dependable, while Roney, if he
is going strong, will work havoc with
the California defense.
Stanford will depend on two of the
best guards around the bay to stop
up the Blue and Gold forwards.
Greve at the standing position is a
tower of strength, while Sullivan,
playing running guard, will undoubt
edly be good for several baskets, in
addition to breaking up many plays.
