# California to Organize American Ambulance Unit
## 
### 
University of California students,
not to lie outdone by Stanford, are
organizing an ambulance corps for
service in France, similar to the Stan
ford unit that recently left San Fran
cisco for Europe. Subscriptions from
students and organizations at Berke
ley are to send the men over and
maintain them while in the French
service.
