# Intercollegiate Agreement Board Meets Tonight
## 
### 
An intercollegiate agreement for
spring sports will be drawn up with
California, tonight, when the Stanford
intercollegiate agreement committee
will meet with a similar committee
from the University of California, in
San Francisco.
The agreement, which will probably
be signed, will be for one semester
only, and will include all the spring
sports, namely, baseball, crew, track,
tennis, basketball, boxing, and wrest
ling. When relations with California
were broken off in 1914, all intercol
legiate agreements were discarded,
and since then the committees have
met annually before spring sports
start, and signed an agreement for
one semester.
The Stanford agreement committee
consists of R. W. Barrett, '04, G. N.
Richardson, '09, and J. T. Nourse, '00.
E. C. Behrens, '14, graduate manager,
and President T. E. Swigart of the
Associated Students, will also attend
the meeting tonight, which will be
held in the Palace Hotel.
