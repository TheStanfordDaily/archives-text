# "Bawl-Out" Destroys Stanford Democracy
## 
### 
Stanford is losing its democracy;
the long cherished ideal of democracy
has passed, in its place has risen a
new aristocracy, a new nobility. If
you doubt it, glance at the long lines
of names in the "Bawl-Out," which
appeared today, and is now on sale at
the business office.
To start with, there are seven
Kings roaming around the campus,
unhonored and unsung; there is one
Earl, two Squires, and two unclassi
fied Nobles. These form the nucleus
of the aristocracy.
Then there are forty-one different
kinds of automobiles listed in the
IJirectory. The Whites lead with six;
I there are five Chandlers, five Mitch
ells, the seven Kings appear again,
four Ross cars, three Aliens, two
Franklins, and one each of the Ketch
am, Metz, Grant, Haynes, Fords, one
Stearns, Paige, and as a conclusive
proof of the rising aristocracy, against
this formidable array of expensive
cars, there is listed only a mere three
Fords and one Brush. There is also
one Rich man who adds his modicum
to the new stratum in Stanford so
ciety. But there is a shred of the
democracy left. Two Freemen are
listed.
„ The largest person in the Univer
sity is a girl—her name is Biggar.
Her influence is counteracted by one
Talboy. The miltarists are represent
ed by two Gunns and one Cannon.
Pike and Sturgeon appear in the ac
quarium and denizens of the air con
sist of Dickey birds, two Crowes and
two mere Byrds.
Professions are represented by two
Brewers, whose vocation is in disre
pute on the campus; three Bakers,
and two Porters. There is one Darling
—and she is a girl; one Sweet —also a
girl—one Flowers —another girl—and
one Lilly.
The honorable family of Smith, with
sixteen entries, leads in the race for
the largest number of persons en
rolled, with the Johnson dynasty a
close second, with fifteen. Clarks,
Davis's and Mill's are tied for third
position with thirteen each.
The registration in the University
for the year is 2180, against 2054 last
year. Of this number 322 are grad
uate students, 1805 undergraduates,
and 58 are specials. Faculty and of
ficers are numbered at 351, exclusive
of the fifteen trustees of the Univer
sity.
The largest number of students, by
major subject, prefer the Law depart
ment, there being 397 registered in
the Law School, with the Economics
department second with 244 students,
and the Mechanical Engineering de
partment third with 162.
