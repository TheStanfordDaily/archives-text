# VARSITY QUINTET INVADES BERKELEY
## Play California in Opening Contest Tomorrow Night 
### 
BASKETBALL fans who have seen
both the Stanford and California
varsities in action are divided as
to the outcome of the opening game
tomorrow night at Harmon gymnas
ium, Berkeley. A close game is looked
for, however, and judging from their
respective showings against Wash
ington State, both teams should put
up a hard fight.
Coach Wilson of the Stanford team
and Coach Cherrington of California
have been working this week on the
delects, which showed up in the
Washington games. The chief weak
ness of the Stanford team seems to
be in bunching up and in poor pass
ing. The California players are also
having trouble in locating their own
men.
That the Cardinal quintet was not
in the best of condition showed up in
the way Washington ran away from
them in the second halves of both
games.
Stanford will in all probability
start tomorrow night's game with the
same lineup that started Tuesday
night. Captain Wheatly at center, has
boon playing a hard game all sea

son. His condition has not been too
good and has shown up in the last
few games. Honey seems to have lost
his eye for the basket in the last few
games. On the southern trip Roney
was shooting at will and in all the
games was a feature. If he can raise
his shooting average in the California
series, it will go a long way toward
bringing a Cardinal victory.
Greve is playing a wonderful game
at standing guard this year. His
breaking up of the opponents' team
work has been a delight to fans in
every game. Sullivan, at running
guard, has also been playing a beau
tiful game. His work in the Wash
ington series was largely responsible
for keeping the latter's score down.
California will line up with Sharp
and Flodberg, forward; Hjelte, cen
ter; Embury and Foster, guards.
Ten men will make the trip, leaving
Palo Alto at 4:35. They will stop in
the city for dinner. The game will be
called at S o'clock. Book, of Oakland
high school, whose handling of the
Tuesday night's game was exception
ally able, will referee.
