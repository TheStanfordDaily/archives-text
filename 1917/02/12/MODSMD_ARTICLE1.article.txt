# PHOENIX NINE DEFEATED IN SPEEDY GAME
## STANFORD WINS 1-0 Best Game of Season Featured by Hard Hitting and Fast Fielding 
### 
Displaying the best baseball
seen on the Stanford diamond
this season, the Cardinal var
sity defeated St. Mary's tossers Satur
day by a 1 to 0 score. The freshmen
took the San Jose high school dele
gation into camp by the same count
in the first game of the double-header.
15oth contests will long be remem
bered as excellent exhibitions of the
national pastime, and will go down
in the record book as well-earned
Stanford victories.
Small Croud On Hand.
A small crowd turned out, consider
ing the importance of a game with
St. Mary's, one of the best college
teams in the state. There was more
enthusiasm shown, however, than at
any other game this year, and as the
innings were reeled off without scores
being chalked up on t.'ther the
fans rooted as they seldom do at pre
liminary contests.
Three long triples, one by Shriver,
one by Lilly, and one by Stevens, a
grandstand catch of a line drive by
Dickey, a fast double-play by Cowan,
Shriver and Mitchell, air-tight pitch
ing by Gus Hoever, and some phe
nomenal fielding by Brandon, the op
posing twirler, were the outstanding
features. These were off-set by some
of the worst base-running ever forced
upon the followers of the game. Be
fore the eighth frame, the inning that
Stanford made the winning tally, the
Cardinal players had thrown away
three sure chances of victory by poor
running 011 the paths. This can
hardly be held to the runners, as the
coaches on the lines are at least sup
posed to know that a baseball game
is in progress.
Fielding Saves Game.
Taking the game as a whole,
Hoever heaved wonderful ball. How
ever, in several innings he was in hot
water, and was only saved by fielding
that resembled that displayed in much
faster company.
In the eighth spasm, Campbell, the
first batter, got on base on a slow
infield single. He went to second on
a wild toss by Prentice, the visiting
third sacker. Hoever fanned, and
Campbell went to third on a passed
ball. Cowan walked, and the 'big
catcher scored on a sacrifice fly by
Stevens. Mitchell ended the inning,
being thrown out on a fast ground
ball to short.
In t-he first, second, sixth and eighth
innings, the Phoenix aggregation came
near scoring. They had two men on
in all of these innings, and twice with
but one man down, Brandon was the
distinct star of the opposing squad.
He seemed to be the only man who
could hit Hoever effectively, pitched
a good game, and proved himself to
be a splendid fielding twirler.
First Game of Series.
The game was the first of a series
to be played with the Catholic college
nine, and makes the second straight
win for Stanford over St. Mary's, the
contest last season going to the Card
inal by a 4 to 3 count. The visitors
were handicapped Saturday by the ab
sence of their coach, "Dutch" Leon
ard, who was called to Fresno by the
illness of his mother.
James J. Nealon failed to putin an
appearance, and Joe Braden and Col
lins, one of the St. Mary's pitchers, did
the umpiring. Their work was satis
factory throughout the game.
Freshmen Win.
San Jose high school gave the
freshmen an even contest. Their
pitcher, Bill Paull, had the first year
players swinging wildly during the
greater part of the game. In the
fourth inning, a single, an out, a steal,
and a long fly, that the opposing left
fielder could not get under, owing to
the trees on the faculty diamond,
scored Wayland. This was the only
marker of the game. Lifur pitched
good ball for the freshmen, and the
team gave him good support at all
times.

Displaying the best baseball
seen on the Stanford diamond
this season, the Cardinal var
sity defeated St. Mary's tossers Satur
day by a 1 to 0 score. The freshmen
took the San Jose high school dele
gation into camp by the same count
in the first game of the double-header.
15oth contests will long be remem
bered as excellent exhibitions of the
national pastime, and will go down
in the record book as well-earned
Stanford victories.
Small Croud On Hand.
A small crowd turned out, consider
ing the importance of a game with
St. Mary's, one of the best college
teams in the state. There was more
enthusiasm shown, however, than at
any other game this year, and as the
innings were reeled off without scores
being chalked up on t.'ther the
fans rooted as they seldom do at pre
liminary contests.
Three long triples, one by Shriver,
one by Lilly, and one by Stevens, a
grandstand catch of a line drive by
Dickey, a fast double-play by Cowan,
Shriver and Mitchell, air-tight pitch
ing by Gus Hoever, and some phe
nomenal fielding by Brandon, the op
posing twirler, were the outstanding
features. These were off-set by some
of the worst base-running ever forced
upon the followers of the game. Be
fore the eighth frame, the inning that
Stanford made the winning tally, the
Cardinal players had thrown away
three sure chances of victory by poor
running 011 the paths. This can
hardly be held to the runners, as the
coaches on the lines are at least sup
posed to know that a baseball game
is in progress.
Fielding Saves Game.
Taking the game as a whole,
Hoever heaved wonderful ball. How
ever, in several innings he was in hot
water, and was only saved by fielding
that resembled that displayed in much
faster company.
In the eighth spasm, Campbell, the
first batter, got on base on a slow
infield single. He went to second on
a wild toss by Prentice, the visiting
third sacker. Hoever fanned, and
Campbell went to third on a passed
ball. Cowan walked, and the 'big
catcher scored on a sacrifice fly by
Stevens. Mitchell ended the inning,
being thrown out on a fast ground
ball to short.
In t-he first, second, sixth and eighth
innings, the Phoenix aggregation came
near scoring. They had two men on
in all of these innings, and twice with
but one man down, Brandon was the
distinct star of the opposing squad.
He seemed to be the only man who
could hit Hoever effectively, pitched
a good game, and proved himself to
be a splendid fielding twirler.
First Game of Series.
The game was the first of a series
to be played with the Catholic college
nine, and makes the second straight
win for Stanford over St. Mary's, the
contest last season going to the Card
inal by a 4 to 3 count. The visitors
were handicapped Saturday by the ab
sence of their coach, "Dutch" Leon
ard, who was called to Fresno by the
illness of his mother.
James J. Nealon failed to putin an
appearance, and Joe Braden and Col
lins, one of the St. Mary's pitchers, did
the umpiring. Their work was satis
factory throughout the game.
Freshmen Win.
San Jose high school gave the
freshmen an even contest. Their
pitcher, Bill Paull, had the first year
players swinging wildly during the
greater part of the game. In the
fourth inning, a single, an out, a steal,
and a long fly, that the opposing left
fielder could not get under, owing to
the trees on the faculty diamond,
scored Wayland. This was the only
marker of the game. Lifur pitched
good ball for the freshmen, and the
team gave him good support at all
times.

Displaying the best baseball
seen on the Stanford diamond
this season, the Cardinal var
sity defeated St. Mary's tossers Satur
day by a 1 to 0 score. The freshmen
took the San Jose high school dele
gation into camp by the same count
in the first game of the double-header.
15oth contests will long be remem
bered as excellent exhibitions of the
national pastime, and will go down
in the record book as well-earned
Stanford victories.
Small Croud On Hand.
A small crowd turned out, consider
ing the importance of a game with
St. Mary's, one of the best college
teams in the state. There was more
enthusiasm shown, however, than at
any other game this year, and as the
innings were reeled off without scores
being chalked up on t.'ther the
fans rooted as they seldom do at pre
liminary contests.
Three long triples, one by Shriver,
one by Lilly, and one by Stevens, a
grandstand catch of a line drive by
Dickey, a fast double-play by Cowan,
Shriver and Mitchell, air-tight pitch
ing by Gus Hoever, and some phe
nomenal fielding by Brandon, the op
posing twirler, were the outstanding
features. These were off-set by some
of the worst base-running ever forced
upon the followers of the game. Be
fore the eighth frame, the inning that
Stanford made the winning tally, the
Cardinal players had thrown away
three sure chances of victory by poor
running 011 the paths. This can
hardly be held to the runners, as the
coaches on the lines are at least sup
posed to know that a baseball game
is in progress.
Fielding Saves Game.
Taking the game as a whole,
Hoever heaved wonderful ball. How
ever, in several innings he was in hot
water, and was only saved by fielding
that resembled that displayed in much
faster company.
In the eighth spasm, Campbell, the
first batter, got on base on a slow
infield single. He went to second on
a wild toss by Prentice, the visiting
third sacker. Hoever fanned, and
Campbell went to third on a passed
ball. Cowan walked, and the 'big
catcher scored on a sacrifice fly by
Stevens. Mitchell ended the inning,
being thrown out on a fast ground
ball to short.
In t-he first, second, sixth and eighth
innings, the Phoenix aggregation came
near scoring. They had two men on
in all of these innings, and twice with
but one man down, Brandon was the
distinct star of the opposing squad.
He seemed to be the only man who
could hit Hoever effectively, pitched
a good game, and proved himself to
be a splendid fielding twirler.
First Game of Series.
The game was the first of a series
to be played with the Catholic college
nine, and makes the second straight
win for Stanford over St. Mary's, the
contest last season going to the Card
inal by a 4 to 3 count. The visitors
were handicapped Saturday by the ab
sence of their coach, "Dutch" Leon
ard, who was called to Fresno by the
illness of his mother.
James J. Nealon failed to putin an
appearance, and Joe Braden and Col
lins, one of the St. Mary's pitchers, did
the umpiring. Their work was satis
factory throughout the game.
Freshmen Win.
San Jose high school gave the
freshmen an even contest. Their
pitcher, Bill Paull, had the first year
players swinging wildly during the
greater part of the game. In the
fourth inning, a single, an out, a steal,
and a long fly, that the opposing left
fielder could not get under, owing to
the trees on the faculty diamond,
scored Wayland. This was the only
marker of the game. Lifur pitched
good ball for the freshmen, and the
team gave him good support at all
times.

illness of his mother.
James J. Nealon failed to putin an
appearance, and Joe Braden and Col
lins, one of the St. Mary's pitchers, did
the umpiring. Their work was satis
factory throughout the game.
Freshmen Win.
San Jose high school gave the
freshmen an even contest. Their
pitcher, Bill Paull, had the first year
players swinging wildly during the
greater part of the game. In the
fourth inning, a single, an out, a steal,
and a long fly, that the opposing left
fielder could not get under, owing to
the trees on the faculty diamond,
scored Wayland. This was the only
marker of the game. Lifur pitched
good ball for the freshmen, and the
team gave him good support at all
times.
