# Speakers Ready for Bonnheim Contest
## 
### 
Winners in the Bonnheim disser
tations held last month, will engage in
the discussions in the Little Theater,
Wednesday night, at 8 o'clock, in a
formal debate, which is open to the
public. The men who will take part
in the discussions are It. C. Binkley,
'20, J. C. Holland, '17, Edward Gold
berg, '17, and J. E. Kimber, '17.
As a result of the death of Mr.
Bonnheim this winter no prize will
be given the man who takes first in
the debate Wednesday, since no pro
vision was made in his will for the
money necessary to carry on these
competitions. The winners decided to
hold the discussion without the prize.
"Ethics of the Indian Policy of the
United States Government" is the
question up for discussion Wednes
day.
