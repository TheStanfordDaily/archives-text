CALIFORNIA won the opening
game of the intercollegiate bas
ketball series Saturday night, at
Harmon gymnasium, Berkeley, by a
20-14 score. Uiiliculty to locate the
basket was responsible for the Card
inal defeat.
California led practically from the
start. During the lirst half both
teams seemed to be playing under a
strain and as a result the passing
was loose. The game was marked
throughout by exceptionally good
teamwork at times, while at other
times the playing of both teams
brought groans from the big crowd.
The score at half-time was 10 to 8 in
favor of the Blue and Gold.
Sullivan Stars.
Sullivan's playing throughout the
game was the feature. His work at
running guard in breaking up the op
ponent's plays brought applause from
California as well as Stanford sup
porters. Both teams fought hard all
the time and what they lacked in
team play they made up in this re
spect. Bonney played a good offen
sive game. He was fighting all the
time although he was weak on con
verting fouls, shooting only six out
of twelve chances. Estes never
showed better than in the few minutes
he was in the game. He shot two
beautiful baskets, in addition to ex
cellent work on the defensive. Greve
played his usual consistent game at
standing guard, preventing many bas
kets from under the goal.
Hjelte, the big center of the Cali
fornia team, did not start the game.
