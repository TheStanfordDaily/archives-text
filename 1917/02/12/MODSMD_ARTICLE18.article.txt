# SOME INCH!

### 
Stanford democracy has of late been
carried away by the impetus of its
own zeal, so that there is danger or
its soon becoming anarchy unless
steps are taken to dampen the enthus
iasm of some of our more ardent
spirits. But a few months ago, the
practice of roughing to dances came
before the University Conference for
trial. It was decided then that it
could remain with 11s only in a modi
fied form. In effect, it was put on
probation. That was some time ago,
however, and the inch allowed then
has since been stretched into a good
long mile.
We believe in the privilege of watch
ing dances, but hate to see that priv
ilege abused. There is no harm as
long as the great uninvited remain 011
the outside looking in, but stories
have come to our ears lately which
make it imperative that some remedial
action be taken. At a recent dance,
one man extended his personality onto
the dancing floor in the shape of an
egg, which barely missed one of the
dancers. On another occasion a lady
carried away the print of a dirty hand
011 her gown. The pernicious prac
tice of "swiping eats" has been re
vived on a large scale. Such acts as
these smack of barbarism, and can
not be tolerated in any civilized com
munity.
Regulation can only be made ef
fective with the co-operation of those
who watch the dances. Pinkerton tac
tics are impractical and undesired.
However, when this fails there is the
alternative of prohibition, -which would
not require such a discerning eye to
enforce. Regulation has been tried,
and thus far has failed, due to the
shortsightedness of those to be reg
ulated. The end of the trial period
is close at hand. When the experi
ment fails, it is for the Student Con
ference to call "time!"
