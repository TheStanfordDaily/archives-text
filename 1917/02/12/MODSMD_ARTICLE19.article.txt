# Professor Krehbiel Talks on War Zones
## 
### 
"But for some accident which we
cannot see now, the war will prob
ably last indefinitely. I cannot see the
end and no prognostication can be
made. The war is still not in hand,
the expediency rests 011 the question
of economic resources."
This was the most striking state
ment of a lecture 011 the present war,
which was given before a large audi
ence in the Union, Friday evening, by
Professor Edward B. Krehbiel of the
Department of History. Later he gave
it as his opinion that the United
States will undoubtedly become em
broiled into the conflict.
With the aid of maps and stereop
ticon slides, Professor Krehbiel as a
preliminary to his lecture, reviewed
the entire course of the twenty-eight
months of fighting. He showed that
as a result of the greatly-exploited
drives of the Allied forces, not more
than one and one-quarter per cent of
the entire allied ground in possession
of the Central Powers had been re
covered.
