# Professor Johnson Leaves University
## Member of Economics Faculty Accepts Position on New Republic Staff 
### 
Professor Alvin S. Johnson, who
came to Stanford at the beginning of
last semester for the second time in
six years as professor in the Depart
ment of Economics, loft the campus
at noon, Saturday, for New York,
where he will assume the direction of
a department in the New Republic
Magazine, of which he has been a
contributing editor for the past year.
Professor Johnson's three classes
will hereafter be given by Assistant
Professor Victor J. West of the Eco
nomics department, who will take
charge of the "Parliamentary Govern
ment" and the seminar in Political
Science, while Professor Edward El
liott, former dean of the College of
Economics of Princeton University,
now an attorney of international law
in San Francisco, will give the course
in "Government and Its Relation to
Industry." Professor Elliott lectured
on international law at the Univer
sity of California during the 11)13-
1011 semesters.
Professor Johnson's decision to
leave Stanford came quickly. The ed
itor of the New Republic had been
after his exclusive services for some
time, but his overtures until last week
had met with no success. Intimates of
Professor Johnson said lie was firmly
convinced that the entanglement ot
the United States in the world war
was inevitable and his desire to he in
the east, near the first scenes of ac
tion, influenced him in making his de
cision.
Professor Johnson's departure from
Stanford is taken on a leave of ab
sence from the University, which was
granted late last week, and extends
until next fall.
