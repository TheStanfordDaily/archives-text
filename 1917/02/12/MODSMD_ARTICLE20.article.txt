# CALIFORNIA MEDIATION ACT
## Safeguarding the Public Interests in Industrial Disputes Affecting Public Service 
### 
The California Mediation Act introduced at the present session of
the Legislature by Assemblyman Goetting, with the full support of the
San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, is a measure of State-wide in
terest and proposes to do for California what President Wilson believes
should be done for the nation with respect to mediation in strikes and
lockouts on interstate railroads.
The California Mediation Bill will affect strikes and lockouts in
connection with any State public utility such as railroad companies,
telegraph and telephone companies, and light, heat, water and power
companies.
Where a strike or lockout affects a public utility, like a railroad,
or a telegraph company, or a light or power company,, not only the
comfort but the material welfare of a great portion, and in some cases
of all, of the public will necessarily be directly affected by a strike.
The farmer who wants to ship his products to market, often products
of a perishable nature, feels the effect of a railroad strike.
The whole industrial activity of the State would be affected by a
strike on the telegraph or telephone companies. A power company
strike might affect interurban communications or tie up industrial
establishments dependent on the power generated and thus affect the
employment of their employees. Whole communities might go with
out light in the case of a strike on a lighting company. In all these
possible cases, the interest of the public is paramount to the interest
of any employer or any set of employees.
The California Mediation Act does not deny the right to strike; it
merely suspends that right during the time of a public investigation.
It does not affect strikes or lockouts, except those occurring on public
utilities.
The Mediation Act provides for a Board of Mediation to reconcile
differences arising between employer and employees connected with
State public utilities. In the event of the finding of the board not
being acceptable to either party, the right either to strike or lockout
still remains. The act suspends the right of strike or lockout during
this public investigation and report. The basic principle of the act is
that public opinion must prevail, but that it should be an intelligent
public opinion formed after a full knowledge of the facts.
The principles involved in this law have been tried successfully in
Canada under what is there known as tlie "Industrial Disputes Inves
tigation Act," which has been in force there since 1907. In a reccnt
official report showing the operation of the Canadian Act since its
adoption in March, 1907, it appears that as a result of this Act ninety
per cent of the threatened strikes and lockouts have been avoided in
those industries to which the Act applies. Taking one Canadian fiscal
year, as an example, the average time taken to investigate and report
upon a dispute referred under the Canadian Act was forty-nine days.
The American Federation of Labor, in its recent convention at
Baltimore, unanimously declared its opposition to the suggestions of
President Wilson with respect to compulsory mediation. It appears
likely, therefore, that the representatives of organized labor will op
pose the passage of the California Mediation Act at the present, session
of the California Legislature. The issue involved in this Mediation
Act is the simple issue: Shall the people rule? or, in matters in which
the public at large are vitally interested, shall the people be ruled by
a class?
Before the public is subjected to the discomfort, to the loss, to the
injury resulting from a strike or lockout on a public utility, they are
surely entitled to know what the dispute is about, to form their opin
ion concerning the merits of the dispute and to bring to bear upon the
settlement of that dispute the force of a carefully matured public
opinion .
This in substance is what the Mediation Act will accomplish; and
if the Mediation Act should fail of passage, the vital interests of the
public must continue to be made subordinate to the clash of personal
interests between employer and employee connected with the public
utility services of the State.
