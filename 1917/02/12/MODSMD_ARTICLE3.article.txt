# No Problem From Immigration of Japanese--Treat

"There is no Japanese Immigration
problem on this coast," declared Pro
fessor P. J. Treat in his lecture in the
Union Sunday night. "The whole prob
lem of a race immigration to this
country from Japan was settled in
1907, when President Roosevelt en
tered into a gentleman's agreement
with the Island Country, and even the
people who have been bitter against
the Japanese can't say that they have
not kept to that agreement."
"From ISIS to 1905 our relations
with Japan were more honorable than
with any other country. Then in 1905
at the end of the Russian-Japanese
war the agitators without foundation
declared that since Japan- had de
feated Russia shor would turn and at
tack the United States. Although
they gave absolutely no evidence to
prove their case certain people be
lieved them and this was the begin
ning of the Japanese suspicion."
(gentlemen's Agreement in 1907.
"Then in 1907 the Gentleman's
agreement with Japan was entered
into, keeping out all undesirable Jap
anese by the very stringent passport
law in Japan." Professor Treat de
clared that the whole problem of Jap
anese immigration was settled at this
time.
"Japan is playing a great game in
China. The cards are on the table.
We don't know how the game will
come out, but it would be suicidal for
Japan to get into a war with the
United States and the Japanese
statesmen know it. To my mind, there
doesn't seem to be the slightest
danger of war with Japan. If people
will only use their intelligence they
will see that this is true."
