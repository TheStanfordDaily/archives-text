# FIVE GAMES SLATED WITH "BRUIN" NINE
## ELIGIBILITY DISCUSSED Intercollegiate Agreement Committees Suggest Novel Changes 
### 
INTERCOLLEGIATE agreement com
mittees representing Stanford and
the University of California met in
San Francisco at the Palace Hotel,
Friday night, at 8 o'clock, and adopted
an agreement covering spring sports
for the present semester. R. W. Bar
rett, '04, G. N. Richardson, '09, and J.
T. Nourse, '00, represented Stanford,
with Graduate Manager Behrens and
President T. E. Swigart of the Asso
ciated Students, also in attendance.
The agreement adopted is practic
ally the same as that covering spring
sport competition last year, with the
exception of the clause in regard to
the eligibility of the contestants.
Since Stanford and California are both
members of the Paciiic Coast Confer
ence, it was decided to leave it up to
the graduate managers as to whether
or not the Conference ruling on the
eligibility question should be adopted.
Eligibility Rule I'nehanged.
The Conference eligibility rule is
practically the same as that hereto
fore used and in all probability Grad
uate Managers Behrens and Stroud
