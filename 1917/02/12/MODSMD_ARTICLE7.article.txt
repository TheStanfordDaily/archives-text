# FIVE GAMES SLATED WITH "BRUIN" NINE
## ELIGIBILITY DISCUSSED Intercollegiate Agreement Committees Suggest Novel Changes 
### 
INTERCOLLEGIATE agreement com
mittees representing Stanford and
the University of California met in
San Francisco at the Palace Hotel,
Friday night, at 8 o'clock, and adopted
an agreement covering spring sports
for the present semester. R. W. Bar
rett, '04, G. N. Richardson, '09, and J.
T. Nourse, '00, represented Stanford,
with Graduate Manager Behrens and
President T. E. Swigart of the Asso
ciated Students, also in attendance.
The agreement adopted is practic
ally the same as that covering spring
sport competition last year, with the
exception of the clause in regard to
the eligibility of the contestants.
Since Stanford and California are both
members of the Paciiic Coast Confer
ence, it was decided to leave it up to
the graduate managers as to whether
or not the Conference ruling on the
eligibility question should be adopted.
Eligibility Rule I'nehanged.
The Conference eligibility rule is
practically the same as that hereto
fore used and in all probability Grad
uate Managers Behrens and Stroud
will decide on acceptance of the Con
ference rule when they meet tomor
row. As far as known, it would have
no effect here at all.
Recommendation was made by the
agreement committee that a baseball
series of the best three out of five
games be held, rather than the best
two out of three. This may possibly
affect the series this year, and if it
does the first game will be held a
week earlier than now scheduled, or
on March 31. Stanford is agreeable
to the have game series and Behrens
and Stroud will also decide this ques
tion tomorrow.
In regard to track, the committee
recommended that the javelin and dis
cus events be placed 011 the program
this year as exhibition events, and
that some time in the future be made
regular events 011 the program.
Graduate Managers Behrens and
Stroud, in an effort to relieve the con
gestion of the spring sport calendar,
decided that intercollegiate swimming,
wrestling and fencing will be held in
the first semester in the future, in
stead of in the second, as they are
now.
