W taste, Fatimas would
not be a sensible smoke if
they weren't comfortable.
In other words, Fatimas
would not be sensible if
they ever bothered your
throat or tongue; or if they
didn't leave you feeling all
right even after smoking
more than usual.
Fatima Cigarettes never
disturb. They can't. The
milder tobaccos in their
Turkish blend are in such
perfect balance with the
richer, fuller-flavored leaves
as to off-set entirely all of
that uncomfortable "oily
heaviness" found in 80
many other cigarettes.
You'll realize this with
your first package of
Fatimas.
