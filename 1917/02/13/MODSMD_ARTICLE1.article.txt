# VARSITY FIVE MEETS BEARS ON THURSDAY
## VICTORY IS EXPECTED Second Game of Annual Series Should be Good Contest. Freshmen Play 
### 
IN PREPARATION for Thursday
night's game with the University
of California, the varsity basket
hall team held a hard workout in the
gymnasium yesterday afternoon.
Weaknesses which showed in the first
game were gone over and the men
look to be in excellent shape for the
second contest.
Cardinal Chances Fair.
Although the first game went to the
Blue and Gold team, Stanford fans
who saw the game last Saturday night
are unanimous in the belief that the
Cardinal quintet can come through
with a victory Thursday night. Their
teamwork was better as a whole than
shown at any time this season, and
with the men playing on their own
floor it is believed they will be more
successful with their baskets.
New Combination Good.
The combination which played the
last few minutes of the opening game
looked good. Honney at center, Estes
and Roney, forwards, and Sullivan
and Greve, guards. Estes is small,
but h'e played a fine game and did not
seem handicapped against the big
California team.
From the way they have been play
ing in preliminary games the fresh
men team looks good for victory when
they line up against the Bruin frosli
in the opener of Thursday night's
double-header. They have developed
excellent teamwork and are very suc
cessful both 011 long baskets and in
shooting from under the basket.
Moulton and Debenham are especially
good in converting fouls.
The freshmen game will start at
7:15, Thursday night, and the varsity
game will start immediately alter.
Admission will be fifty cents or twen
ty-five cents and season tickets.
The varsity basketball squad, con
sisting of Bonney, Pelouze, Estes,
Wheatly, Righter, Sullivan, Dolan,
Lytle, Greve and Roney, will hold its
final workout before the game with
California tomorrow afternoon, at 5
o'clock, according to an announce
ment of Coach Wilson today. The
freshmen squad, which will be an
nounced tomorrow, will also hold its
workout at the same time.
