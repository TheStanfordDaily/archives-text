# VARSITY FIVE MEETS BEARS ON THURSDAY
## VICTORY IS EXPECTED Second Game of Annual Series Should be Good Contest. Freshmen Play 
### 
IN PREPARATION for Thursday
night's game with the University
of California, the varsity basket
hall team held a hard workout in the
gymnasium yesterday afternoon.
Weaknesses which showed in the first
game were gone over and the men
look to be in excellent shape for the
second contest.
Cardinal Chances Fair.
Although the first game went to the
Blue and Gold team, Stanford fans
who saw the game last Saturday night
are unanimous in the belief that the
Cardinal quintet can come through
with a victory Thursday night. Their
teamwork was better as a whole than
shown at any time this season, and
with the men playing on their own
floor it is believed they will be more
successful with their baskets.
New Combination Good.
The combination which played the
last few minutes of the opening game
looked good. Honney at center, Estes
and Roney, forwards, and Sullivan
and Greve, guards. Estes is small,
but h'e played a fine game and did not
seem handicapped against the big
California team.
