# Stage Stretched to Accomodate Justice Players
## 
### 
Assembly Hall's stage is not elastic,
but the spectator in the Assembly
today was entirely justified in re
marking that rubber instead of wood
must have been used in the construc
! tion of the stage walls and floor.
SceHic artists and carpenters from
the Alcazar Theater have virtually
stretched the stage for the big court
room scene of "Justice," to be pre
sented by English Club and Masquers
on March 9.
Forty-one people, by actual count,
will be massed before the footlights
I during the second act of the Gals-
I worthy drama. To accommodate this
number, the floor space of the Assem
bly stage has been divided into six
levels, the first measuring 43 feet in
width. From the lowest level the
stage will rise through witness stand,
attorneys' bench, jury box, press
stand, etc., to the highest point—the
judge's bench, towering above the as
semblage.
Over a half-hundred incandescents
will augment the footlights in illum
inating this court of justice.
Mathieu is conducting rehearsals of
all acts at tri-weekly intervals. To
night, at 7:15, act two will be re
hearsed. Thursday, from 1 o'clock
until 4, act three will be covered. All
day Saturday will be devoted to acts
one, two and four, the latter in the
morning and the first named in the
afternoon.
