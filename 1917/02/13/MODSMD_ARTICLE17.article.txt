# A 						DISGRACE
## 
### 
Certain classes of thefts, we learn
from men of science, are the result
of a disease called kleptomania.
Others we know, have various causes
devoid of such high sounding and mit
igating names. These are just plain
stealing. The ultimate difference
seems to be that which exists between
the insane asylum and the peniten
tiary. We don't know which of these
applies to some Stanford people, but
that one or the other does apply is
evident from the number of com
plaints which have been heard during
the past few weeks. If the loss of
property is due to a disease, we should
have recourse of quarantine; if to the
meanness of a few individuals, we can
not be rid of them too soon.
That such a matter should have
been brought to the attention of the
community is deplorable. We might
expect conduct of this sort from
children, but in a University it is in
tolerable. In another column of this
issue, under the head of "Another
Viewpoint," is given an example of
the complaints received. The writer
is optimistic in hoping that thefts will
gradually diminish. We hope with
him, but feel that the only way this
hope will be fulfilled is for every
member of the community to be on his
guard. Petty thieves are usually cow
ards in addition, and will not take a
chance.
Too often a condition such as this
is hushed up, from a sense of shame
that it should exist at all. Let all be
warned, that we may put an end to
this disgrace!
