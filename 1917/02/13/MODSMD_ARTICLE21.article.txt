Dear Sir: A few weeks ago I read
in a notice that somebody on the cam
pus had lost a bicycle. I passed the
matter up as one, to be expected once
in a while in any community.
About a week later, my bicycle was
stolen, and in inquiring for it, I
learned that a bicycle was either "bor
rowed" for a week or so, and returned
in a demolished condition, or else
taken away entirely from the vicinity.
Recently, a friend of mine lost a
$45.00 bicycle that had been only
slightly used. Now the question that
I wish to ask is, whether the stealing
and borrowing of bicycles is a com
mon occurrence, and if some means
cannot be secured to have at least a
little respect for other people's prop
erty?
It is not only bicycles that are
stolen. In the gymnasium we have
notices of stolen tennis shoes, money,
etc. I know that stealing will never
be an unknown thing in any commun
ity, but I can say that I never heard
of more articles stolen from any one
place than since at Stanford. Maybe
thefts will gradually diminish, but I
hope that means other than hiring an
armed man to safeguard one's prop
erty, will gradually be instituted on
the campus.
