Lacing Up Repaired Shoes
Lacks joy of comfort unless the
shoes remain the shape of your
feet. Just cobbling will not do.

its white linen, its atmosphere of
reserve, and service that excels,
s a genuinely pleasant place to
eat. The tranquillity of the Inn is
no empty phrase,—even during the
noon rush.
