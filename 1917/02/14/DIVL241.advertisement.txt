ANTI-BOYCOTT LAW
Prohibits Sympathetic Strikes and
Secondary Boycotts
The anti-boycott bill introduced at the present session of the Cali
fornia legislature by Senator Ballard of Los Angeles, and supported
by the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, is designed to make the
sympathetic strike and the secondary boycott unlawful.
There is nothing in the bill affecting the right of employees to
strike or to maintain a primary boycott against their own employer,
for the purpose of enforcing their demands relative to their own em
ployment or to their own labor conditions. The secondary boycott and
the sympathetic strike do not come within this exception, and there
fore would be made unlawful by this act.
The Ballard Anti-Boycott bill is necessary if the State is to protect
its citizens from wanton injury inflicted upon them by those who may
be involved in an industrial dispute to which the citizens injured are
not parties. It is for this reason that the line of distinction has been
drawn between the direct strike and the sympathetic strike and the
primary and secondary boycotts.
The direct strike and the primary boycott affect only the employer
involved in the dispute. The secondary boycott and the sympathetic
strike on the contrary tend to injure those who are not directly in
volved in the dispute. The primary boycott has been defined by the
California Supreme Court as the right of employees to cease dealing
by concerted action, either socially or by way of business, with their
former employer.
The employees have the right by all legitimate means by fair pub
lication and fair oral or written persuasion, to induce others interested
in or sympathetic with their cause to withdraw their social intercourse
and business patronage from this employer. This right is not sought
to be interfered with.
But when the employees go further than this, and request of
another that he withdraw his patronage from the former employer,
and use the moral intimidation and coercion of threatening a like
boycott against him if he refuses so to do, it is a case of secondary
boycott. This secondary boycott has been declared illegal by the
English courts, the Federal courts and by the courts of most of the
States of America.
There is no justice in the use of the secondary boycott involving,
as it does, strangers to the dispute and inflicting injury not only upon
those against whom the secondary boycott is declared and maintained
but, through injury to them, often affecting the general interests of
the public and causing loss to them.
The industrial activities of a whole trade or of a whole commun
ity may be paralyzed through the use of the sympathetic strike or the
secondary boycott, and the law today affords no relief. If the law is
lo maintain its boast that for every wrong there is a remedy, Senator
Ballard's bill should be enacted into law.
