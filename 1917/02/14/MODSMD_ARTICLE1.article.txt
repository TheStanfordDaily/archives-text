# U.S. WORKERS IN BELGIUM FORCED OUT
## WILL CONTINUE WORK Spain and Holland to Take Supervision of Relief Says Mrs. Kellogg 
### 
/ / A LTHOUGH it will bo necessary
r% i'or the forty or fifty Ameri
cans, who have been super
vising the relief work in Belgium, to
give up their offices, the American
workers in this country will redouble
their efforts, for support is needed
more than ever now," is the opinion
of Mrs. V. L. Kellogg, who recently
returned from the Belgium field. "It
would appear that we had been help
ing the Belgians merely for the glory
it gave us, if we permitted the diplo
matic break with Germany, and the
inevitable request that our American j
commissioners withdraw from Bel
gium and Northern France, to put an
end to our efforts for relief."
Work By Triple Protectorate.
"Not every one understands that
this work has been carried on by a
triple protectorate of neutrals. Both
Holland and Spain have been in the
field with the United States. The
work, which is so well organized now,
will be carried on by these two coun
tries, probably with the aid of other
neutrals. Neither of these states are
as well able directly to supervise the
work as the Americans have been,
since both are in depleted conditions.
It will therefore be necessary for our
organizations here to unify and cen
tralize our efforts, as we are determ
ined to do."
Herbert C. Hoover, who originated
the relief work, and who is now chief
director, is in America at the present
time, endeavoring to secure greater
financial aid. In an address delivered
Monday niglit, after learning of Ger
many's request, he announced that he
intended to continue in his superviso
ory capacity as if nothing had hap
pened. Dr. Vernon L. Kellogg and
William Poland of New York, with
the aid of Ambassador Page, are in
charge of the diplomatic direction in
London of Hoover's work, while he is
absent.
