# FOR THE GOOD OF ALL
## 
### 
Fraternity representatives meet this
evening to consider a problem of vital
interest to every Greek letter society
on the campusâ€”that of the formation
of an interfraternity conference.
This proposition was discussed last
semester, without result. It is to be
hoped that fraternities will see it
through now, for a conference of this
sort has been needed for some time
at Stanford. Concerted action is es
sential to solve the problems which
face fraternities, and such action can
not be secured except through a body
representing each unit, and with suf
ficient power to make it worth while.
There is much to do, and the less time
wasted the better.
Whether or not fraternities can suc
ceed in getting together on some plan
depends a great deal on the attitude
which each unit takes toward the mat
ter. It will probably be impossible
to strike a scheme that entirely satis
fies every member of every fraternity.
This is not to be expected. Some
sacrifice will have to be made for
the good of the fraternity system as a
whole. If each group bears this in
mind, there should be 110 trouble about
Onpp that is
done, other problems can be worKea
out through it.
