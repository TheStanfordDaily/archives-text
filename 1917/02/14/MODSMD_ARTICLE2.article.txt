# Lane Hospital Unit Plans Are Outlined
## Faculty Member Tells of Work of Red Cross Workers in San Francisco 
### 
Dr. Emmet Rixford, professor of
surgery, who lias charge of the Stan- {
ford University Naval Base Hospital,
lias written the following explanation
of the work done by that institution.
It is this work in which the Red
Cross Society is interested on the
campus. The article follows:
"The Stanford University Naval
liase Hospital is one of four or five
that are needed by the navy, according
to the estimate of the surgeon gen
eral, and it is one of the two located
on the Pacific Coast. It may be said
that both of these are In a sense
Stanford institutions, since Dr. Rea
Smith, a Stanford graduate, is director
of the one which is being organized
in Los Angeles, while Dr. Stanley
Stillmau. professor of surgery of the
Lane Hospital, is in charge of the
one that is being organized in San
Francisco. It is the latter, however,
which bears the name of the Stanford
University Naval Base Hospital, and
which depends more directly upon
Stanford University for support.
"With only two base hospitals on
the Pacific Coast, the demand which
may be made upon either of them in
the event of an emergency will be
extremely urgent. The navy is the
first line of defense of this country,
and must be on a war footing 011 the
very outbreak of hostilities. The
equipment and supplies for the care
of the wounded in the event of a
fight must be prepared beforehand and
stored ready for immediate use.
"Base hospitals, both for the army
and navy, are being organized under
the auspices of the Red Cross, to be
turned over to the government in case
of war. Although it remains in a
sense outside the regular military es
tablishment, it is then commanded by
a regular officer of the army or navy,
while most of the professional work
is done by men drawn from civil life.
Thus it is that the staff of the Lane
Hospital will furnish the physicians
and surgeons to carry on the work of
the Stanford University Naval Base
Hospital.
"Under the regulations of the Red
Cross Society, the Naval Base Hos
pital shall contain 250 beds, and shall
be so organized in personnel and
equipment that it can readily be ex
panded to 300 or 400 beds.
"The equipment consists in part of
permanent outfit, such as beds and
bedding, hospital furniture, operating
room equipment, and so forth, and in
part of a large supply of material
which will be expended in use and
must consiaunj ,
splints, bandages, material for sur
gical dressing, etc. All of this ma
terial must be supplied by contribu
tions from those who are particularly
interested in Stanford work. If all
the students enroll as members of the
Red Cross their dues will furnish
about ten per cent of the total cost,
and each one will individually have
the satisfaction of knowing that he
or she lias contributed at least some
thing toward that preparedness for the
emergency of war, which is so ur
gent."

bedding, hospital furniture, operating
room equipment, and so forth, and in
part of a large supply of material
which will be expended in use and
must consiaunj ,
splints, bandages, material for sur
gical dressing, etc. All of this ma
terial must be supplied by contribu
tions from those who are particularly
interested in Stanford work. If all
the students enroll as members of the
Red Cross their dues will furnish
about ten per cent of the total cost,
and each one will individually have
the satisfaction of knowing that he
or she lias contributed at least some
thing toward that preparedness for the
emergency of war, which is so ur
gent."
Dr. Emmet Rixford, professor of
surgery, who lias charge of the Stan- {
ford University Naval Base Hospital,
lias written the following explanation
of the work done by that institution.
It is this work in which the Red
Cross Society is interested on the
campus. The article follows:
"The Stanford University Naval
liase Hospital is one of four or five
that are needed by the navy, according
to the estimate of the surgeon gen
eral, and it is one of the two located
on the Pacific Coast. It may be said
that both of these are In a sense
Stanford institutions, since Dr. Rea
Smith, a Stanford graduate, is director
of the one which is being organized
in Los Angeles, while Dr. Stanley
Stillmau. professor of surgery of the
Lane Hospital, is in charge of the
one that is being organized in San
Francisco. It is the latter, however,
which bears the name of the Stanford
University Naval Base Hospital, and
which depends more directly upon
Stanford University for support.
"With only two base hospitals on
the Pacific Coast, the demand which
may be made upon either of them in
the event of an emergency will be
extremely urgent. The navy is the
first line of defense of this country,
and must be on a war footing 011 the
very outbreak of hostilities. The
equipment and supplies for the care
of the wounded in the event of a
fight must be prepared beforehand and
stored ready for immediate use.
"Base hospitals, both for the army
and navy, are being organized under
the auspices of the Red Cross, to be
turned over to the government in case
of war. Although it remains in a
sense outside the regular military es
tablishment, it is then commanded by
a regular officer of the army or navy,
while most of the professional work
is done by men drawn from civil life.
Thus it is that the staff of the Lane
Hospital will furnish the physicians
and surgeons to carry on the work of
the Stanford University Naval Base
Hospital.
"Under the regulations of the Red
Cross Society, the Naval Base Hos
pital shall contain 250 beds, and shall
be so organized in personnel and
equipment that it can readily be ex
panded to 300 or 400 beds.
"The equipment consists in part of
permanent outfit, such as beds and
bedding, hospital furniture, operating
room equipment, and so forth, and in
part of a large supply of material
which will be expended in use and
must consiaunj ,
splints, bandages, material for sur
gical dressing, etc. All of this ma
