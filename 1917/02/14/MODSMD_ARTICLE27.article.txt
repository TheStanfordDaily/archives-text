Senior jolly-up committee as ap
pointed by E. R. Ames, president of
the class, is as follows: M. E. Ted
ford, chairman; F. L. Righter, C. L.
Hunter, Miss Helen Greening and Miss
Florence Knapp.
It is probable that the joint upper
class jolly-up will be held March S,
the evening before Founders' Day. In
that event dancing will be from 7 till
11, as the next day is not a full holi
day.
