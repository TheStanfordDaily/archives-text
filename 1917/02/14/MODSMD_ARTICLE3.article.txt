# Women's Musical Clubs Please in Joint Concert
## 
### 
Stanford Women's Mandolin Club,
led by Miss Liljj Sherwood, and the
Schubert Club, under the direction of
Louis H. Eaton, shared the honors In
the second musical program of the
year, held last night in the Little
Theater. The audience tilled the
theater to the doors. The program of
the Mandolin Club was well balanced,
containing some classical music as
well as a number of more or less pop
ular airs, and the entire Schubert
Club contribution of two numbers
was rendered very effectively by Miss
Edith IlarVey.
