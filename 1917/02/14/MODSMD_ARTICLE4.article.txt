# Intercollegiate Baseball Games Are Scheduled
## 
### 
Five intercollegiate baseball games
have been scheduled with the Uni
versity of California instead of three,
as has always been the case in pre
vious years. It was understood on
Monday that, this would be done, but
the information was not made of
ficial until Graduate Manager Beh
rens of Stanford, and Stroud, the
manager of Berkeley, agreed to the
proposal at a meeting of the Inter
collegiate Agreement Committee, held
in San Francisco last night.
The first game will be played on
Saturday, March 24, at Stanford.
The following contests will be staged
one week apart, on March 31, April 7,
April 14, and if the fifth game is neces
sary, on April 21. The second game
is scheduled for the Berkeley dia
mond, the third for Stanford, the
fourth at California, and if the last
one is played, it will lie held at Stan
ford. The game on April 14 is the
same clay that the varsity crew race
i will be rowed, while the intercol-
legiate freshmen track meet is on
April 7 at Stanford.
A change in the freshmen baseball
schedule was necessitated by the new
varsity plan. The first freshmen con
test will be played at Berkeley on Fri
day, March 23, while the second game
is scheduled for the Cardinal lot on
March 29. The third battle will be
fought during the spring vacation,
taking place at California on Thurs
day, April 5.
Graduate Manager Pehrens also
scheduled a game between the Stan
ford varsity and the University of
Southern California. This contest
will also be played during the spring
vacation, as it is dated for Wednes
day, April 4.
As the first three varsity intercol
legiate games will take place before
the major league umpires have to
leave the coast, Pchrens believes that
lie will be able to get Ilildebrand, the
famous American League indicator
man, to handle the first three con
tests.
