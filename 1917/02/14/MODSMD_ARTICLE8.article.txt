# SPEEDY GAME EXPECTED ON ENCINA COURT

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Feb. 13. —When California meets
Stanford on the hitter's court,
Thursday night, it is to be hoped that
the teams are in better condition
than they were in the first game here,
last Saturday, else Stanford fans
will suffer a disappointment eqilally
as great as that of California.
Basketball critics who saw the
game here have no hesitancy in say
ing that it was the worst court ex
hibition played this season by Cali
fornia, and probably the worst played
by Stanford, it is inconceivable that
the Cardinal played such a game
against Washington State, otherwise
the Red would have gone down to
ignoble defeat. That California won
the first game was due to two flashes,
in which the Hears returned to their
old form. In all other respects, the
Californians were the inferior of
Stanford, although the Cardinal's
superiority was by a very small mar
gin.
Coaches here claim that California
and Stanford had gone stale after the
tension of the Washington State ser
ies; that the two teams were afraid
of each other, and that they resorted
to purely a defensive game.
California displayed a wildness in
shooting baskets that was the worst
of all time. The Blue and Gold
reached the low mark of inefficiency,
and are now due to come back.
In an effort to get the men into a
mental and physical condition for the
game, Coach Cherrington gave them
light work, yesterday and today, with
a complete rest and a short trip
around the bay tomorrow.
Practice time has been used in de
veloping team formations, as Califor
nia displayed a woeful lack of this art
in the first game against Stanford.
Sandner and Sharp, forwards, are also
spending their idle moments shooting
foul baskets. Both men did remark
ably well in the first game, Sandner
getting four out of four and Sharp
two out of two.
Aside from Sharp and Sandner at
forwards, Coach Cherrington will
send Embury and Foster in at guards,
and Hjelte at center.
Sharp, Foster and Embury are the
veterans of last year, while Hjelte
and Sandner are new men on the
team. Hjelte made his reputation
with the Oakland "Golds," so this is
his first year in varsity basketball.
Sandner is a find. He has been in
college three years, but no one knew
that he could play basketball until
he was uncovered in an interclass
match last fall.
Captain Sharp has been on the team
for the past three seasons, always
nlaying his position at forward. Al
though srnaii, Diiai|i 10 *—<- —j
at getting the ball away. Foster is
playing a rear guard position, a new
one created for him, where his
strength and bulk are of no slight
value. Embury played alongside of
Foster last season.
Whether or not California will win
against Stanford depends on the con
dition of the team. If Stanford pulls
out of its slump, and California fails
to do so, then there is going to be a
disappointed bunch of spectators, al
though Stanford will win. If both
teams come back to form, the game
should be equal to any of the Pacific
Coast Conference so far this season.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Feb. 13. —When California meets
Stanford on the hitter's court,
Thursday night, it is to be hoped that
the teams are in better condition
than they were in the first game here,
last Saturday, else Stanford fans
will suffer a disappointment eqilally
as great as that of California.
Basketball critics who saw the
game here have no hesitancy in say
ing that it was the worst court ex
hibition played this season by Cali
fornia, and probably the worst played
by Stanford, it is inconceivable that
the Cardinal played such a game
against Washington State, otherwise
the Red would have gone down to
ignoble defeat. That California won
the first game was due to two flashes,
in which the Hears returned to their
old form. In all other respects, the
Californians were the inferior of
Stanford, although the Cardinal's
superiority was by a very small mar
gin.
Coaches here claim that California
and Stanford had gone stale after the
tension of the Washington State ser
ies; that the two teams were afraid
of each other, and that they resorted
to purely a defensive game.
California displayed a wildness in
shooting baskets that was the worst
of all time. The Blue and Gold
reached the low mark of inefficiency,
and are now due to come back.
In an effort to get the men into a
mental and physical condition for the
game, Coach Cherrington gave them
light work, yesterday and today, with
a complete rest and a short trip
around the bay tomorrow.
Practice time has been used in de
veloping team formations, as Califor
nia displayed a woeful lack of this art
in the first game against Stanford.
Sandner and Sharp, forwards, are also
spending their idle moments shooting
foul baskets. Both men did remark
ably well in the first game, Sandner
getting four out of four and Sharp
two out of two.
Aside from Sharp and Sandner at
forwards, Coach Cherrington will
send Embury and Foster in at guards,
and Hjelte at center.
Sharp, Foster and Embury are the
veterans of last year, while Hjelte
and Sandner are new men on the
team. Hjelte made his reputation
with the Oakland "Golds," so this is
his first year in varsity basketball.
Sandner is a find. He has been in
college three years, but no one knew
that he could play basketball until
he was uncovered in an interclass
match last fall.
Captain Sharp has been on the team
for the past three seasons, always
nlaying his position at forward. Al
though srnaii, Diiai|i 10 *—<- —j
at getting the ball away. Foster is
playing a rear guard position, a new
one created for him, where his
strength and bulk are of no slight
value. Embury played alongside of
Foster last season.
Whether or not California will win
against Stanford depends on the con
dition of the team. If Stanford pulls
out of its slump, and California fails
to do so, then there is going to be a
disappointed bunch of spectators, al
though Stanford will win. If both
teams come back to form, the game
should be equal to any of the Pacific
Coast Conference so far this season.
