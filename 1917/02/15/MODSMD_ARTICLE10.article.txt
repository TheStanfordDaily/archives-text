# "BACK TO THE FARM' SAYS MEAD--

"With the disappearance of free
land from this state and the raising of
prices of cultivated land the people of
California have reached a stage where
the young man instead of settling on
the farm has been going to the city,
with the result that the farms are be
coming depicted. The question before
the people of this state is, how can
the young man marry, buy and culti
vate a farm and make a profit on it
and so stay away from the city? It
is a problem that must be solved at
once."
With this statement, Dr. El wood
Mead, lecturer, engineer, professor,
and land expert, sounded a warning to
.the people of California in the Little
Theater, this morning. Dr. Mead
made it plain that the people of this

state must adopt a system by which
a man will own his own land.
"If only for the sake of democracy
we must adopt a system of helping
the young man own his own farm. In
Australia, the greatest democracy in
the world is being built up simply by
putting the people on the farms where
they are contented and where they
realize the government is doing some
thing to heli) them. This is respon
sible for the spirit. There is no ex
treme rich or poor class. It is dem
ocracy, and this is what we must have
in America."
Dr. Mead explained that a bill had
been introduced into the state legis
lature by the commission, of which he
is head, to remedy conditions in Cali
fornia.
