# BEARS WILL PLAY VARSITY FIVE TONIGHT
## FAST GAME EXPECTED Second Game of Annual Series Scheduled for Encina Gym at 8:00 
### 
Following last night's workout
at the gymnasium, Coach Wilson
announced the lineups of the
teams that will face California to
night. The game between the second
varsities will start promptly at 7:15,
and the varsity game will start im
mediately after.
The varsity lineup, as announced,
includes Honey and Hstes, forwards;
Wheatly, center; Sullivan and Greve,
guards. Donney will he ready to sub
stitute for either forwards or center,
while Pelouze will sub at forward,
Righter at center and Dolan and Lytle
at guards.
Jewett and Schwarzenbek will start
the game at forwards for the second
varsity Wallace will go in at center
and Needham and Coppes at guards.
This combination has been working
out with the varsity all season and
should be able to give the California
seconds a close contest.
Style of Play Improved.
1 iotli fives are expected to play a
better game tonisht than they did
last Saturday at Berkeley. Each team
is now familiar with the other's style
of play, while neither was playing its
best basketball in the first game. With
the additional practice on teamwork
and shooting baskets, the contest
should be much faster.
The Cardinal team works better to
gether with every game. Captain
Wheatly, at center, started a number of
plays from the jump, last Saturday
night, and was fighting hard all the
time. Bonney played better than at
any time since the Southern California
trip. Roney played a good defensive
game, but lias not been shooting so
well as in the earlier part of the sea
son. Estes has gotten into practically
all the games this season and, is an
excellent substitute forward. His work
in the first Blue and Gold encounter
was especially satisfactory to Stan
ford fans. Greve, at standing guard,
has covered his position as well as
anyone seen 011 the ,local lloor this
year, while Sullivan, at running guard,
is also playing a stellar game. Dolan
has played well at guard, and with
these three men to rely upon, Cali
fornia's score should be kept down.
California's Lineup.
California will in all probability
start the game with Sandner and
Spencer, forwards; Hjelte, center; Fos
ter and Embury, guards. This is the
same team which started the first
game, except Works, who started at
center. Sandner and Spencer are par
ticularly effective on converting fouls,
having a perfect average in the initial
contest. Sharp will not play owing to
a late injury.
Judging from preceding games, the
gymnasium will be taxed to capacity
and the best seats will probably be
taken before the whistle blows for
the start of the game.
Admission will be fifty cents, twen
ty-five cents and season tickets admit
ting student body members.
