# Stanford Loses to Fast Agnews Nine
## Varsity Shows Poor Form With Draper in Box and Drops 9-0 Contest 
### 
Hitting Draper hard at all stages of
the game, accompanied by three costly
errors, the Agnews State Hospital
team defeated the Stanrord varsity
baseball aggregation yesterday after
noon on the Cardinal diamond. After
all of the markers had tallied, the
score-board read 9 to 0.
The game was a listless affair, last
ing but seven innings. These were
enough for the average fan, however,
as the local favorites showed little of
the form displayed against St. Mary's
last Saturday. Their opponents rank
high among the semi-professional ball
teams of the state, and by all odds,
should be able to hang a defeat on
the Cardinals. Nevertheless, Stanford
is not the team to be defeated 9 to 0.
Tiny Seven Innings.
Bliss, the former University of
Santa Clara pitcher, had the varsity
tossers baffled at all times. But
three hits were gathered off his de
livery, one of these being of the
scratch variety. The visitors hit
Draper for ten bingles, one of them a
home run by Connelly, with two men
on ahead of him.
Shriver was out of the game, Braden
playing second. Several substitutes
were sent in during the latter part of
the game, but were unsuccessful in
solving the opposing left-hander's
curves. Phelan umpired his first
game at Stanford and created a fav
orable impression, the fans liking an
umpire that calls balls and strikes
from behind the plate.

Hitting Draper hard at all stages of
the game, accompanied by three costly
errors, the Agnews State Hospital
team defeated the Stanrord varsity
baseball aggregation yesterday after
noon on the Cardinal diamond. After
all of the markers had tallied, the
score-board read 9 to 0.
The game was a listless affair, last
ing but seven innings. These were
enough for the average fan, however,
as the local favorites showed little of
the form displayed against St. Mary's
last Saturday. Their opponents rank
high among the semi-professional ball
teams of the state, and by all odds,
should be able to hang a defeat on
the Cardinals. Nevertheless, Stanford
is not the team to be defeated 9 to 0.
Tiny Seven Innings.
Bliss, the former University of
Santa Clara pitcher, had the varsity
tossers baffled at all times. But
three hits were gathered off his de
livery, one of these being of the
scratch variety. The visitors hit
Draper for ten bingles, one of them a
home run by Connelly, with two men
on ahead of him.
Shriver was out of the game, Braden
playing second. Several substitutes
were sent in during the latter part of
the game, but were unsuccessful in
solving the opposing left-hander's
curves. Phelan umpired his first
game at Stanford and created a fav
orable impression, the fans liking an
umpire that calls balls and strikes
from behind the plate.
