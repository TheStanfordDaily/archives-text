# CHARITY ABROAD
## 
### 
Does charity, after all, begin at
home? This is a question which all
those who heard Mr. Tinker speak at
today's assembly must have asked, and
answered for themselves in a decided
negative. The picture of awful mis
ery in the prison camps of Europe,
painted so graphically, must surely
have struck a sympathetic chord in
the hearts of such an audience. It is
something we can't get away from
when we make any attempt whatever
to imagine ourselves in a similar posi
tion. If we have succeeded in realiz
ing a fraction of the torture and mis
ery suffered from merely hearing it
described, what must be the reality!
Enthusiasm for the ordinary charity
is wont to lag, particularly among
those who have all the comforts of
life, as we have here. It is not alto
gether selfishness which makes us
take this attitude, but to a great ex
tent indifference born of ignorance.
Oncc 011 the ground, however, where
sights such as Mr. Tinker described
could be seen and their significance
realized, we venture to say that most
of us would show as much zeal in the
effort to improve conditions as the
most ardent reformer. The informa
tion received this morning, though not
as convincing as-.actual experience,
can not have failed to make us feel
the need of doing something to help.
This is not an ordinary charity.
Stanford people have heard a lot of
charity, this not being the first cam
paign for a good cause. Many
grumble, but our experience is that
those who grumble most, give least.
It is often the case that the ones who
can little afford to help, give more
than others better aoie to contribute.
Actually, there are few of us who
have made any sacrifice whatever.
Can we afford to let this be said,
when, by denying ourselves a few lux
uries, we might save many lives of
those less fortunate?
