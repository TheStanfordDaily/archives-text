A surprising lack of interest in stu
dent body affairs was diclosed by the
meager audience which sprinkled As
sembly Hall this morning. To be
sure, the inconsiderate scheduling of
a rival attraction by the Economics de
partment was responsible to some ex
tent, but there were many who attend
ed neither. Every fourth assembly
hour is set aside for the students, and
it does not seem too much to expect
that the time should be theirs ex
clusively.
Not only were there few students
in attendance to discuss a matter of
some importance to the University, but
many who were there did not have
the courtesy to remain while the
hymn was sung. We continually hear
the sob that "the old order is chang
ing," and"the spirit is not what it
used to be." The blame for this is
usually placed on administrative
changes. Isn't it possible that some of
it may be charged to our own indif
ference? If so. we had better get
off our feet in a hurry.
