# R. C. Binkley, '20 Winner of Final Bonnheim Debate
## 
### 
Claiming that tlie Indian policy of
the United States government has
been segregation, and that it must be
changed to assimilation, R. C. Binkley,
'20, won the annual Bonnheim discus
sions last night in the Little Theater,
in a close race, from the winners of
the Bonnheim dissertations, held last
month.
Binkley pointed out conclusively
that the policy toward the original in
habitants must be assimilation. To
do this we must take the Red Man
off the reservation and away from
the Indian school. He must be edu
cated with the white man and must be
allowed to live among ourselves. This
is the only policy that will be success
ful and just.
Three Others Argue.
J. C. Holland, 'J7, Edward Goldberg,
'17, and J. E. Kimber, '17, were the
men who opposed Binkley in the con
test last night.
Assistant Professor E. E. Robinson
of the History department; Registrar
O. L. Eliot and Professor A. M. Cath
cart of the Law department, acted as
judges for the debate.
