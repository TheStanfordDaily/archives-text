### 
Two burglers entered the Alplia
Phi house at 2:45 this morning and
got away with money and jewelry.
They made their entrance by cutting
a hole in the screen of the hack porch,
and climbing through it. Two rooms
were raided before anyone became
aware of the fact, but when one of
the men entered the room of Mrs.
Woodward, the housemother, she
awoke and saw him crouching over
her. She screamed "Thief! thief!"
The man rushed for the door and
down-stairs. Mrs. Woodward followed
him, but was not able to catch more
than a glimpse of the man. Jewels
and money were taken from the first
two rooms entered, and it is supposed
that two men were engaged in the
burglary, although but one was seen.
