# DUAL ASSEMBLY HELD TODAY
## W. H. TINKER PLEADS FOR WAR PRISONERS More Money Needed to Give Relief 
### 
SPEAKING on "War Prison Camps
in Europe," W. H. Tinker pre
sented a graphic picture of condi
tions actually existing in the warring
countries, before the 11 o'clock Assem
bly Hall meeting. He ended his talk
with a plea for the thousands of suf
fering prisoners who are now con
fined in the great military camps that
are scattered throughout Europe.
Mental Anguish Intolerable.
"Now, after one and a half years in
many of these camps the men have to
live in the very clothes in which they
were captured," Mr. Tinker told his
audience, "The mental anguish is
well-nigh intolerable," he continued.
In illustrating the fearful conditions,
Mr. Tinker read some extracts of a
woman minister in a Siberian camp
who wrote of the living conditions
with "no mattresses, no straw, not
even papers. No pillows, no covers,
no coatsâ€”nothing but men."
American Supply Relief.
In Older to relieve these conditions
somewhat the World's Student Christ
ian Federation has organized a force
of Americans who are keeping touch
on conditions, providing necessities to
relieve the suffering, and providing
amusement for the men so that many
of them will be saved from the fate of
insanity, which has fallen to the lot
of thousands of others.
Mr. Tinker spoke before a group of
men representing the various living
groups and several members of the
faculty, at a luncheon held in the Inn
last Tuesday, and outlined the enor
mity of the work being accomplished
to relieve the suffering of war prison
ers. At the conclusion the thirty
men present voted unanimously to put
Stanford in line with the other large
universities of the country who have
generously contributed to keep the
work going. Flans will be formulated
by a committee headed by R. R. Tem
pleton, to organize this work at Stan
ford immediately.
Assistant Professor D. F. Grass will
take charge of the funds raised on the
campus, and, aside from money col
lected from the various groups, con
tributions may be made direct to him.
Women may also contribute to the
dean of women.
