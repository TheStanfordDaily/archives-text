# Discussion Held on Election Change
## 
### 
A new system of having the grad
uate manager named by the Executive
Committee instead of elected by the
student body as at present, was dis
cussed this morning at the initial Stu
dent Body assembly of the year.
The assembly was opened by T. E.
Swigart, '17, president of the Asso
ciated Students, who outlined the pro
posed'change. He showed the import
ance of an efficient manager, and the
large problems which affect the policy
of the University in its relation to
other universites.
Sentiment Divided.
Five men spoke from the lloor after
the question had been put, to open dis
cussion. Sentiment in general seemed
to be pretty evenly divided. K. E.
Leib, gr., mentioned the situation at
the time of the split with California,
and showed that the Stanford man
ager was handicapped in comparison
with the sytem used at California. In
closing, he said, "So long as we elect
him we will be handicapped."
Other men who spoke included T. L.
Smith, gr., H. A. Frye, '17, A. K. Grif
fin, gr., K. A. Donaldson, '17, and .). F.
Eldon, gr. Smith said that in his I
opinion the graduate manager was not
elected so much as a representative of
the students as lie was for.his busi
ness ability. "We've got to have a
system to make our money count," he
said.
Frye stated that he did not think
the system proposed was practical.
Griffin, in speaking of the policy of
the University, said that it was to be
determined by the Board of Control,
and that the graduate manager was to
act as the business representative to
carry out that policy. He should,
therefore, be named by the body de
termining the policy. Donaldson pro
tested against the proposed change,
saying that "it takes voting control
away from the students." According
to Eldon, who spoke last, the change
was not necessary unless the students
thought that they were not efficiently
represented. The question will prob
ably be voted on later in a general
quad election.
It was also proposed to elect the
manager of The Daily Palo Alto
through the Executive Committee, but
110 discussion was heard 011 this sub
ject.

through the Executive Committee, but
110 discussion was heard 011 this sub
ject.
A new system of having the grad
uate manager named by the Executive
Committee instead of elected by the
student body as at present, was dis
cussed this morning at the initial Stu
dent Body assembly of the year.
The assembly was opened by T. E.
Swigart, '17, president of the Asso
ciated Students, who outlined the pro
posed'change. He showed the import
ance of an efficient manager, and the
large problems which affect the policy
of the University in its relation to
other universites.
Sentiment Divided.
Five men spoke from the lloor after
the question had been put, to open dis
cussion. Sentiment in general seemed
to be pretty evenly divided. K. E.
Leib, gr., mentioned the situation at
the time of the split with California,
and showed that the Stanford man
ager was handicapped in comparison
with the sytem used at California. In
closing, he said, "So long as we elect
him we will be handicapped."
Other men who spoke included T. L.
Smith, gr., H. A. Frye, '17, A. K. Grif
fin, gr., K. A. Donaldson, '17, and .). F.
Eldon, gr. Smith said that in his I
opinion the graduate manager was not
elected so much as a representative of
the students as lie was for.his busi
ness ability. "We've got to have a
system to make our money count," he
said.
Frye stated that he did not think
the system proposed was practical.
Griffin, in speaking of the policy of
the University, said that it was to be
determined by the Board of Control,
and that the graduate manager was to
act as the business representative to
carry out that policy. He should,
therefore, be named by the body de
termining the policy. Donaldson pro
tested against the proposed change,
saying that "it takes voting control
away from the students." According
to Eldon, who spoke last, the change
was not necessary unless the students
thought that they were not efficiently
represented. The question will prob
ably be voted on later in a general
quad election.
It was also proposed to elect the
manager of The Daily Palo Alto
through the Executive Committee, but
110 discussion was heard 011 this sub
ject.
