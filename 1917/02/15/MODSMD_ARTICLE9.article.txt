### 
Dedicated to the bugaboo of Student
Control, Chaparral Hares forth in glad
array of blue and yellow tomorrow,
with a well balanced variety of the
salt and pepper of college life.
Chappie opens the doors to the fun
inside with an ambitious ditty, "If 1
Were President." With characteristic
solicitation lor (he welfare of the stu
dents in his large heart, Chappie of
fers a solution of the much agitated
queenigg question, and advocates what
he calls the "new point system." A
proof sheet from a "Bawl Out" of
about 1919, and Chappie's own inter

views on the co-educational question
(for Chappie cannot be outdone) are
offered. From the pictorial standpoint
is offered a double-page impression of
tiie "Future Stanford."
