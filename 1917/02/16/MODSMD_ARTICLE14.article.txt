# CALIFORNIA WINS SECOND GAME 29-20
## OUTCLASS CARDINALS Blue and Gold Second Quintet Victor in Preliminary Contest, 33-28 
### 
CALIFORNIA won the intercol
legiate basketball series last
night by defeating the Stanford
varsity in the second game of the
series by a 29-20 score. The Califor
nia second varsity defeated the Card
inal seconds in a close preliminary
33-28. The games were witnessed by
the biggest crowd ever seen in the
gymnasium at a basketball game.
California Takes Lead.
California took the lead almost
from the start and by their superior
play led at the end of the first half
by a 21-10 score. Hjelte, the Blue
and Gold center, was responsible for
10 of California's score in the first
half by shooting five field goals. The
big fellow was valuable in the team
work of the visitors and also in de
fensive play.
Sandner converted five fouls in the
first half, making him a perfect aver
age, as these were all the fouls called
on the Cardinal players during the
contest. Sullivan was Stanford's
heaviest point maker in the first half,
shooting three baskets from the mid
dle of the floor. Captain Wlieatly
was forced to withdraw from the game
during the first half, owiug to a
pulled muscle in his shoulder. Bon
ney replaced him at center, Roney
going in for Bonney at forward.
The Cardinal players showed mark
ed improvement during the second
half. Their teamwork was better and
they showed more fighting spirit than
in the opening period. Shortly after
the second half opened Pelouze went
in for Roney and Righter for Bonney,
and for a time it looked as though
this combination would be able to
overcome the lead which the Blue
and Gold quintet had rolled up.
Pelouze showed well while he was
in, scoring two field goals and two
fouls. Greve and Sullivan were again
the stars of the Cardinal lineup, hold
ing the California forwards to two
field goals between them.
The preliminary game showed lots
of fight and some material showed up
which looked to be of varsity caliber.
The work of Schwarzenbek was par
ticularly true in this respect. He
scored 13 of Stanford's points, and his
defensive play was largely responsible
for keeping the California score
clown. The game was in doubt every
minute, with Stanford leading all the
time, by a close margin, until the last
five minutes of play.
