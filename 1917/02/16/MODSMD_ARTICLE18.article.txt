# GRADUATE MANAGER
## 
### 
Election of the graduate manager by
the Executive Committee instead of
directly by the students, has been
proposed by those who desire a
greater efiiciency in the management
of Associated Student Body business.
It is purely a matter of expediency,
and not an attempt to "put something
over," as some seem to believe. What
could be better and more natural than
to have the choice of an official of
this kind in the hands of those best
qualified to judge his fitness? That
the Executive Committee, which keeps
in constant touch with the manager, is
in a better position to judge than the
students as a whole, few of whom ac
tually know just what the manager's
duties are, can not be doubted.
Do we usually trust our finances to
a man because he is a good fellow
and makes a good impression, regard
less of whether he knows anything
about business? Not if we expect
them to be handled in the most ef
ficient manner. However, under the
present system of electing our grad
uate manager, it is possible and not
unlikely that he might be chosen in
just this careless manner. It is not
likely that the Executive Committee
would pick an inefficient man, since
it must work with him.
At present, even after the manager
is elected, if he expects to run for a
second term, he must continue to be
a good fellow to stand a chance.
This often means the giving of favors
which would be better ungranted, and
the hampering of the manager in his
work. We believe the proposed change
would eliminate personality, and sub
stitute ability as the qualification for
election, and that it would be a wise
move.
