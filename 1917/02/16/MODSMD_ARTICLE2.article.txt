# 1920 Fives Clash at California Tonight
## Stanford and Berkeley Quintets to Meet in Annual Game in Harmon Gym 
### 
California and Stanford freshmen
will meet in their annual basketball
clash in Harmon gymnasium at Berk
eley tonight. Despite the slow games
the varsity teams nave put up, the
contest between the twp quintets to
night should be a fight from start to
finish, and should end in victory for
Stanford.
The freshmen will line up as they
have in preliminary games, with
Moulton and Hood at forwards, Toole
at center, and Debenham and Noyos at
guards. This combination will give
fans who see the contest tonight one
of the best exhibitions of team play
that has been seen in freshmen
games. Coach Wilson has drilled the
men in this feature until they are
more proficient than any of the other
Stanford teams.
From reports California has a good
team. They have been defeated by
several of the bay teams, but have
improved to such an extent that they
are a dangerous combination at pres
ent. Oakland high school, counted
one of the strongest teams who have
played the California team, were de
feated in their last game by a decis
ive score, although they had won sev
eral contests from the Bruin 1920
team before.
