# Allot Leading Roles in French Play
## 
### 
Some of the best talent on the cam
pus has been cliosen for the cast of
the two French plays to be given in
the Little Theater on March IG.
Thurlyne Buffum, '19, and J. C. Cross,
'17, are students who will have parts,
while Madame Petit-Didier, member
of the French colony in Palo Alto,
will take one of the leading roles.
J. A. Sellards, acting instructor in the
Romanic Languages department, is
also slated for a leading part.
Thurlyne Buffum has been prom
inent in campus dramatics, her last
appearance being in "Seven Keys to
Baldpate," last semester. J. C. Cross
has been in practically every produc
tion in the last three years. "The
Great Divide" and "Seven Keys to
Baldpate" are two of the plays in
which he has given a good representa
tion of real acting. Madame Petit-
Didier is a French woman who has
appeared in amateur productions sev-
eral times before. Her appearance in
the two plays will give an opportunity
of seeing experienced talent.
The two plays that arc to be pre
sented are for the benefit of the "Suf
fering Children of Northern France
Society," all funds collected from
tickets to be turned over for this
charity. French people of the penin
sula and San Francisco arc interested
and a good deal of interest is being
taken in the benefit.
