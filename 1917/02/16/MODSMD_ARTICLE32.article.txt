# Says Engineers Need More Than Technical Training
## 
### 
Strength of character, capacity for
| hard work, ability to use good Eng
lish, and an imagination, are quali
fications almost as essential to the
success of an engineer as his tech
nical training, according to W. I. Cat
tell, who lectured in the Little The
ater yesterday afternoon under the
auspices of the Vocational Guidance
committee.
Mr. Cattell said that the first four
! years of an engineering course should
be spent in getting a general train
ing, while preparations for a special
line of work should be carried on in
I a graduate course.
