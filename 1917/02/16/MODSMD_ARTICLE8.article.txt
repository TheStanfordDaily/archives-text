# Council's Stand on Journalists Issued
## Correspondent Forced to Sever Connection With Outside Publications 
### 
To hold student writers responsible
for their articles, was the action
taken by the Men's Student Council, at
their last meeting. The stand of the
Council toward student editors,
writers and illustrators was placed
on record so as to avoid any misun
derstanding. Students will be held
responsible for tlie truth either in fact
or in inference in articles which ap
pear in campus publications. This is
the same standard under which news
paper correspondents must now oper
ate. Students failing to meet this
standard will be liable to disciplinary
action by the Council.
The Council also recommended that
a student newspaper correspondent be
required to sever his relationship with
outside newspapers for the remainder
of the semester. This action was
made necessary by the student in
question sending stories that were
decidedly inaccurate and also misrep
resentative of the true facts of the
case.
The Council records follow:
