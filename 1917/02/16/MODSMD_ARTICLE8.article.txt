# Council's Stand on Journalists Issued
## Correspondent Forced to Sever Connection With Outside Publications 
### 
To hold student writers responsible
for their articles, was the action
taken by the Men's Student Council, at
their last meeting. The stand of the
Council toward student editors,
writers and illustrators was placed
on record so as to avoid any misun
derstanding. Students will be held
responsible for tlie truth either in fact
or in inference in articles which ap
pear in campus publications. This is
the same standard under which news
paper correspondents must now oper
ate. Students failing to meet this
standard will be liable to disciplinary
action by the Council.
The Council also recommended that
a student newspaper correspondent be
required to sever his relationship with
outside newspapers for the remainder
of the semester. This action was
made necessary by the student in
question sending stories that were
decidedly inaccurate and also misrep
resentative of the true facts of the
case.
The Council records follow:
The Men's Student Council recom
mends that a student newspaper cor
respondent be required to sever his
relationship with outside newspapers
during the remainder of this second
semester.
On several occasions the student in
question has sent reports from Stan
ford to various newspapers, which
were inaccurate and grossly misrepre
sentative of the true facts.
Py sending such reports from the
community, the student exposed him
self to discipline under the follow
ing provision of the Men's Student
Conference, which appears on page
18 of the Handbook of Student Con
trol :
"The Council shall have power to
discipline any student correspondent
of any publication who sends out any
untruthful report concerning the Uni
versity or its members. The word
'untruthful' shall be interpreted to
mean untruthful either in fact or in
ference."
As a matter of record, and in order
to avoid any misunderstanding, the
Men's Student Council wishes to make
known what its attitude will be to
ward student editors, writers and il
lustrators.
The Council is specifically author
ized to discipline "any student corre
spondent of any publication who sends
out any untruthful report concerning
the University or its members. The
word 'untruthful' shall be interpreted
to mean untruthful either in fact or
inference."
Students responsible for matter
which appears in campus publications
will in future be held to the same
standard of truthfulness both in fact
and inference. Any students who fail
to meet the standard will render
themselves liable to disciplinary ac
tion by the Council.
