JUST THINK
Mr. House Manager and student what a valuable asset eredit is!
Without eredit not one frat. liouse at Stanford could stay open. It
<&■ is your most valuable asset and yet every time you let a hill run your
eredit is being destroyed. **
This is national "Fay Up Week." We are going to pay our hills so **
you can pay yours. Are you going to pass the compliment along or
are jou going to iose your credit hy letting the hills slide?
Credit is easily lost. ARE YOU LOSING
