# VARSITY WINS SPEEDY GAME ON SATURDAY
## "DOC" HAYES PITCHES Stafford All Stars Defeated by 1 to 0 Count in Fast Contest 
### 
REELING off nine innings of as
speedy baseball as has been
witnessed on the Cardinal dia
mond this year, the Stanford varsity
took Saturday's contest from "Wob
bles" Stafford's aggregation of All-
Stars, 1 to 0. Spectacular fielding by
Cowan, Lilly, Stevens and Mitchell
featured the contest.
Captain "Doc" Hayes surprised the
fans by starting on the mound, and
was in top-notch form, lotting the vis
itors down with two bingles, one of
which was a dinky little pop over
third.
The game early developed into a
pitcher's battle between Buehn and
Hayes, with the odds in favor of the
Stanford skipper. Four hits were ob
tained off Buehn, Mitchell gathering
two of them. The visiting twirler
sent six back to the bench via the
strikeout route, and walked one, while
Hayes struck out-three, Centerfielder
Maneuck being the victim each time.
The lone tally of the contest came
in the Cardinal half in the ninth, just
as the fans were settling back in their
seats expecting the struggle to run
into extra innings. With one down,
Mitchell singled to right, promptly
stole second, and took third shortly
afterwards on a passed ball. Buehn
issued a pass to Lilly, and Dickey
lifted a high foul towards third,
Third Baseman Taaffe handled this,
and threw to first to catch Lilly, who
had taken a long lead and was madly
scampering back to first. The throw
was low and Rock was unable to
handle it, and Mitchell scored during
the melee.
