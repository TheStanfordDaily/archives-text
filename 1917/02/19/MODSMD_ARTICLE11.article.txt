# "Justice" Production Second in America
## First Run of Galsworthy's Play Phenomenally Succesful in New York 
### 
English Club and Masquers, in ven
turing to put Galsworthy's "Justice"
upon Assembly Hall stage, are giving
this play its second production in
America, and as far as can be ascer
tained, its lirst amateur production
anywhere.
"Justice" fooled New York's most
eminent dramatic authorities. Six
theatrical managers refused to book
this play, in spite of the fact that
Seribncrs had been forced to print
ten editions of "Justice" since its pub
lication in book form six years be
fore.
The first appearance of Galsworthy's
greatest drama on the American
stage was made possible by the sev
enth manager, who dared, last May, to
put "Justice" on the stage of the
Candler Theater, New York. There
followed a phenomenally successful
season's run —so successful, in fact,
that critics voiced the opinion that
".lustice" had upset all traditions of
the Metropolitan Theater.
The success that this drama at
tained is summed up in the May, J910,
number of Current Opinion:
" 'Justice' seems to have upset all
traditions of the New York stage. It
has aroused critics and playgoers to
an expression o. enthusiastic appre
ciation unequaled during the course
of the theatrical season—one might
say during several seasons, in New
York. 'Justice' is stripped of every
vestige of tlieatricalism, every sus
picion of comic relief, a depressing
structure of stark and naked real
ism."
