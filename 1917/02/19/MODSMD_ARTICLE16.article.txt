### 
Stanford's first track meet of the
1917 season, Saturday, proved a suc
cess in every way. Coach Templeton
started the meet right on time, the
events were run off with no delays,
and the time made was very good for
so early in the season, all of which was
a source of satisfaction to the bleach
erites. Distances in all events were
shortened.
The outstanding feature of the day
was the performance of Schnell, var
sity lialf-miler. who reeled off a 660-
yard sprint in 1:25 2-5, smashing the
existing coast record of 1:26. Fresh
man Wilke was not many feet be
hind Schnell in this event. McClung
