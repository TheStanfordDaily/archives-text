# Track Men Display Class in First Meet
## Schnell Smashes Pacific Coast Record in 660 Yard Dash Freshmen Surprise 
### 
Stanford's first track meet of the
1917 season, Saturday, proved a suc
cess in every way. Coach Templeton
started the meet right on time, the
events were run off with no delays,
and the time made was very good for
so early in the season, all of which was
a source of satisfaction to the bleach
erites. Distances in all events were
shortened.
The outstanding feature of the day
was the performance of Schnell, var
sity lialf-miler. who reeled off a 660-
yard sprint in 1:25 2-5, smashing the
existing coast record of 1:26. Fresh
man Wilke was not many feet be
hind Schnell in this event. McClung
took third and Scott fourth, finishing
almost abreast. Schnell will not be
given credit for an official record in
this, however, as records accepted
must be made in competition.
M. J. House skipped over the 75-
yard low hurdles in the rapid time of
:9 2-5, with Bob Williams placing sec
ond. In the 75-yard dash House won
the first heat in:8 flat, while Dinkel
spiel, a freshmen performer, won the
second heat in the same time.
The field events were closely con
tested but the work of "Dink" Tem
pleton and Dykes in the high jump,
tying for first place at G feet, was
perhaps the most satisfactory.
