# "FOREWARNED IS FOREARMED"
## 
### 
If there is any truth in the proverb,
"Forewarned is forearmed," Stanford
should in the future be freed from the
scourge of inaccurate and harmful
publicity. The Student Council has
rightly taken a Arm stand against the
misrepresentation of University af
fairs, both by those writing for out
side readers, and those who contribute
to campus journals, including illus
trators. The warning is plain and the
meaning unmistakable. That the
Council means business is evident
from the disciplinary action already
taken. We hope that recourse to such
action will not be necessary in the
future, and that one warning will be
sufficient.
It will be worth a good deal to cam
pus writers to have the assurance that
every word of criticism will not be
magnified into a mountain of insur
rection. All will admit that there are
two sides to most every question, and
it is desirable that the students be
able to present their views without
having them garbled. The Council's
action ought to assure 11s this immun
ity from misrepresentation.
