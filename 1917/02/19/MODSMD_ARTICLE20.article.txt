Those who have not heretofore been
given a chance to liquidate their lia
bilities will have an excellent oppor
tunity now. Officially, this is National
Pay-Up Week. That means that it is
all right to pay your debts during the
next seven days. Perhaps it would be
better to do it now, than to risk be
coming conspicuous by waiting until
the appointed time is past, although
such movements are not usually ex
pected to penetrate to college com
munities. We might wish the "powers
that be" had placed the time for
cleaning up a little nearer the first of
the month, out of consideration for us
here at Stanford. However, let us do
the best we can to remove the stigma
of debt this week.
