# Practice Regularly on Redwood Estuary
## Four Crews on Water Workout for Positsons in Boats For Regatta 
### 
With the crew season in full swing
four crews are now working out at
Redwood regularly, under the super
vision of Coacli "1 In sky" Guerena anil
Captain Rix Maurer. Two varsity and
two freshmen eights practice regul
larly, although changes are made in
the hoats every day and no definite
idea can be gained as to the men who
will be in the big regatta. From
showing so far, however, any com
bination that is picked will be a strong
one in the varsity shell. The fresh
men arc harder to dope out.
Over the week-end two of the best
workouts of the season were held.
The men were sent on long easy rows,
resulting in considerable improve
ment in form and wind. Since train
ing rules have been put into partial
effect practice can be harder and the
crews should soon be making good
time in their rows.
Due to the fact that it was tied
wrong the launch used by Coach
Guernena was swamped by a flood-tide
and was out of commission for part
of the week-end. It has been bailed
out now, however, and no apparent
damage was done.
