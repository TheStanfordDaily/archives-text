and a chorus of thirty-six. A com
plete list of all those who are able

ing corner.
"A Pirate for a Day" is a romance
of the South Seas, laid at Puerta
Limon, the plantation of an American
Fruit company. The Pan-American
atmosphere which runs through the
show calls for all the color and ro
mance of the tropics.
The lighting effects that are neces
sary in the production will out-do any
thing that has been attempted here
before. Dick Morgan, who has been
specializing along this line for the
past year, is going to put on the As
sembly Hall stage innovations which
will produce some novel effects.
B. W. Gillespie, '18, who has suc
ceeded R. 11. Coleman, 'IS, as chair
man, announces that a complete list
of the cast will be published Wed
nesday. The first rehearsals will be
held Saturday morning. Coleman was
forced to resign as chairman, due to
pressure of other work.
