# Varsity Hockey Men Defeated by U.C.
## Superior Teamwork of Berkeley Team Secures a 4 to 1 Victory on Ice 
### 
Superior teamwork, due to constant
practice, "was the chief factor which
enabled California to register a 4 to 1
victory over the Stanford ice hockey
tram in the first game of their annual
series, held last Friday at Tait's Win
ter Garden Ice Palace.
California's scoring took place dur
ing the first period, Stanford being
unable 1o stop the splendid teamwork
of the Berkeley men. During the last
two periods, however, the Cardinal
skaters more than held their own
against their opponents, Captain D. C.
Upp, '18, of Stanford, shooting a goal
in the second frame.
Thrills were frequent, the players
many times sliding twenty or thirty
feet on any portion of their body
handy, and the game was fast from
start to finish. Several times Referee
G. Trehearne sent men from both
teams to the sidelines for rough play
ing.
The rink was well filled with spec
tators. California's division was fea
tured by an organized rooting section,
which was sadly lacking beneath the
Stanford banner.
Every man on the Stanford team put
up a good fight, Captain Upp and W.
W. Collins, '19, showing up to ex
ceptionally good advantage. Some
very clever skating was brought out
during the contest, which brought
forth much applause from the spec
tators.
On March 2 the second game will
be played with California at the Win
ter Garden.
