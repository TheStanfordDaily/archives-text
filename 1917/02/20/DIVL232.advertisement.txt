Like George Washington—
We want to be honest —about the
shoe proposition. We'd rather not
sell the shoes than to have to sell
inferior ones at lower prices

prices—especially in stout liigh
shoes for raiiny weather.

A SUPER-CHOCOLATE
"This Chocolate can't be beat," said Co-Edna,
holding a huge Leland Stanford in her hand. ••It's
the best they make in the way of candy."
Quality's the reason.
"Leland Stan fords are made of the best mate
rials, including the highest priced chocolate to be pur
chased," she continued. "Leland Stan fords have been
improved since Christmas, When better candies
aremade, they'll be Wilson's."
