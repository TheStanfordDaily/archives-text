# Frosh Wails Wants to Go to Redwood
## 
### 
That athletic coaches earn all
their honorariums, and (hen some,
is evidenced by the following let
ter which found itself into
"Husky" Guerena's mail the other
day. Imagine a similar wail from
every man in the University who
thinks he can row, play football,
baseball, basketball, soccer, or
run on a track; imagine the utter
waste in postage stamps; and
then resolve not to be a coach.
Dear Husky:
My name hasn't been posted on
the list to go to Redwood for the
last five or six days. [ have only
been up once and Sunday morning
my name was posted but I didn't
know it.1 called up Schellen
bach at B:.'JO, but he said the list
wasn't up. Some of the other
coxswains have been up five or six
times while I have only been up
once. So 1 didn't know but what
I had been dropped. As I don't
seem to have been dropped I think
I ought to have a few chances to
show what i can do.
