# Soccer Team Not to Make Coalinga Trip
## 
### 
I Soccer team's trip to Coalinga on
I Washington's Birthday has- been post
poned indefinitely on account of the
condition of the weather. Arrange
ments had been nearly completed, but
this morning a telephone call was re
ceived by Graduate Manager liehrens
and the manager of the Coalinga soc
cer men said that as it was raining
there and the weather man gave out
that it, would probably continue for
several days, so the trip should be
postponed.
The soccer men have been working
hard and last Saturday the varsity
defeated the Olympic team by the
score of r>-l, and the freshmen played
a 1-1 tie with the Olympic Juniors.
11. W. Maloney, soccer coach, re
cently received a letter from E. M.
Peixotto, of the Recreation League of
San Francisco, again thanking the
Stanford men who went up to the city
every Friday of last semester to coach
soccer in the public schools.
