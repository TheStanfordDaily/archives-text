Kigliter Plays Stellar (inriie.
Captain Wheatly was not. in a suit
and Righter started at center. lie
put up one of the best games seen
tliis season, converting seven baskets
against the best player of the St.
Mary's team. In addition to his bas
ket shooting he covered the floor in
good shape and started many plays
from (lie center position.
Estes, at forward for the Cardinal,
made seven out of eight attempts for
goal baskets. In the California series
the failure of the Cardinal to convert
fouls was one of the greatest disap
pointments of the contests, and af
ter Estes' coirie-baek last night the
chances for wins in the Oregon Agri
cultural College games were raised
considerably. In addition to his foul
shots the little forward made two. field
baskets and played a good guarding
game.

the California-Nevada League, and
counts 011 the championship of that
league.
