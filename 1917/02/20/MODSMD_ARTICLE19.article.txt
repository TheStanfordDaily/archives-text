# TRADITIONS-GOOD AND BAD
## 
### 
Traditions, of late, seem to have
fallen sadly into disrepute, particular
ly those regarding our freshmen. At
least they are greatly in need of re
pair. Now there are traditions and
traditions, and we would not have all
of them observed forever by any
means. Those which ought to go, and
which usually do go, are the ones
which interfere with the development
of the community, or in which detri
ment outweighs the sentimental value
which is the only excuse for the ex
istence of most traditions. Allowing
freshmen to smoke nothing but cigar
ettes 011 the campus, was a good ex
ample of the detrimental tradition,
and it gave place to a more sensible
rule.
What we wish to complain of, how
ever, is the passing of those tradi
tions which possess a certain senti
mental worth, and which are in them
selves harmless. What, indeed,' is a
University without the cobwebs of
tradition? We see freshmen smoking
cigars and cigarettes indiscriminately.
The sancitity of the Senior Bench is
continually violated. If it be consid
ered that these sort of restrictions in
terfere with the development of in
dividuality, we feel sorry, but suggest
that the individuals develop along
other lines.
While on this subject of tradition,
and particularly freshman tradition,
may we remind the fraternity first
year men that Thursday is Washing
ton's Birthday? In past years the day
has apparently been forgotten, with
the result that the customary annual
parade has rather resembled a march
of the faithful proceeding to a student
body meeting. We hope to see you out
in force, frosh!
