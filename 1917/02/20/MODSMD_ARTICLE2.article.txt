Captain L. R. Skelton of C company
of the Military Training Corps, yes
terday voluntarily resigned his office
in favor of First Lieutenant G. C. Col
lins of the same company. This is a
similar action to the one taken by
Captain Harris of A company, when
he resigned in favor of Lieutenant F.
C. McColloch, last week, and Major
Bugge stated that the spirit of these
men in resigning when they thought
another man could better fill the posi
tions, was exceedingly good team
work, and promised well for the future
of the corps.
Company competition in marksman
ship will start tomorrow in the gallery
with Company A. Each man will lire
five shots at 50 feet. In the round at
25 feet, which has just been com
pleted, Company C showed the best
score, but Company I', was also good.
Drill competition next month will
not only consist of company drill as
heretofore, but there will be platoon
and squad competition, and also drills
of squads of 8 and 1G picked men from
each company.
