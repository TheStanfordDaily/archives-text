'Fore The Hand Out —Hill, a chronic
crab, and liis room-mate, Pete. Pete is
a rcu'iiliir gent. Pete peruses the col
umns of a last minute edition of The
Daily Palo Alto.
Pete —See liow I've been honored
again.
Hill —What'dju ever do to be hono
ored?
Pete—Haven't done it yet, but I'm
going to. I'm on the committee to
collect funds for war prisoners.
How much'll you give?
Hill —Gosh all fish-hooks. There it
goes again. A fellow's always dishin'
out his cash to some blankety-blank
charity around here. First it's Bel
gian Relief, then it's Pellissier, then
the Y. M. C. A. beans you,—you get
it in the neck from something every
doggone day. I can't even have any
peace in my own room. I ought to
fall heir to a fortune —if I did, though,
they'd beg it all from ine.
Pete —Aw, don't take it to heart,
Fete. How much have you given?
Bill—l'm always shelling out for
something.
Pete —How much did you give to
Helgian relief?
Hill —Nothin' exactly to that but
Pete —How much to the Y. M. C. A.?
Hill—l was broke when they hit
me, but
Pete —1 suppose you gave it all to
the Pellissier fund? h
Hill —1 wasn't in the room when
they came around but —but—but
Pete—Maybe you put your money in
the Sunday School box?
Hill (angrily) — I haven't been to
Sunday School.
Pete—Been busy giving your money
away, 1 suppose
Hill—l gotta have some money for
recreation. A fellow can't work all
the time. I only get sixty seeds a
month, anyway, and it doesn't go any
where, when I get off the campus.
Anyway, regulations are making this
college like a prison camp. They
ought to have some relief for im
prisoned college men.
Pete—Now you've said something.
This fund's for college men in prison.
I'll stick you down for five dollars.
Shell out, you old tightwad, before
wifie takes all your money away from
you.
Did Hill shell out? Of course lie
did, after which lie felt a whole heap
better, internally, externally, and
every other way.

Hill —Nothin' exactly to that but
Pete —How much to the Y. M. C. A.?
Hill—l was broke when they hit
me, but
Pete —1 suppose you gave it all to
the Pellissier fund? h
Hill —1 wasn't in the room when
they came around but —but—but
Pete—Maybe you put your money in
the Sunday School box?
Hill (angrily) — I haven't been to
Sunday School.
Pete—Been busy giving your money
away, 1 suppose
Hill—l gotta have some money for
recreation. A fellow can't work all
the time. I only get sixty seeds a
month, anyway, and it doesn't go any
where, when I get off the campus.
Anyway, regulations are making this
college like a prison camp. They
ought to have some relief for im
prisoned college men.
Pete—Now you've said something.
This fund's for college men in prison.
I'll stick you down for five dollars.
Shell out, you old tightwad, before
wifie takes all your money away from
you.
Did Hill shell out? Of course lie
did, after which lie felt a whole heap
better, internally, externally, and
every other way.
'Fore The Hand Out —Hill, a chronic
crab, and liis room-mate, Pete. Pete is
a rcu'iiliir gent. Pete peruses the col
umns of a last minute edition of The
Daily Palo Alto.
Pete —See liow I've been honored
again.
Hill —What'dju ever do to be hono
ored?
Pete—Haven't done it yet, but I'm
going to. I'm on the committee to
collect funds for war prisoners.
How much'll you give?
Hill —Gosh all fish-hooks. There it
goes again. A fellow's always dishin'
out his cash to some blankety-blank
charity around here. First it's Bel
gian Relief, then it's Pellissier, then
the Y. M. C. A. beans you,—you get
it in the neck from something every
doggone day. I can't even have any
peace in my own room. I ought to
fall heir to a fortune —if I did, though,
they'd beg it all from ine.
Pete —Aw, don't take it to heart,
Fete. How much have you given?
Bill—l'm always shelling out for
something.
Pete —How much did you give to
Helgian relief?
Hill —Nothin' exactly to that but
