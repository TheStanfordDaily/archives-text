Many vacancies in the grade of sec
ond lieutenant in the United States
Marine Corps are to be filled, accord
ing to a letter received from the head
quarters of the corps. University
graduates need little more than the
recommendation of the President of
the University to lie eligible for a
commission of second lieutenant in
the marine corps.
Service in the marines is very at
tractive in that it gives opportunity
for travel and experience on both land
and sea. The salary of those starting
in the service is $1700 a year. Full
particulars may be had from Major
Bugge.
