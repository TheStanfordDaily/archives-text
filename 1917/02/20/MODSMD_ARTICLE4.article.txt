Stanford has been asked to con
trilnite to a general fund which
: will partially relieve the intense
suffering of European war prison
ers. The following excerpts from
the experiences of a woman min
ister in Siberia show the condi
tions that actually exist:
Crowded into tumbledown, con
demned structures, all vermin-in
fested —with no light or air, and
sometimes no heat, in temperatures
i of 50 degrees below zero.
Forced to go unbathed for
1 months. Not even enough water is
provided for drinking.
Sick in hospitals are exposed to
every disease treated under the
same roof. Even foreign nurses
cannot escape infection.
As many as five prisoners are
forced to eat from the same dish,
many ravenously devouring food
with fingers.
Driven desperate beyond the
point of uttering a complaint, cap
tives stare in subdued silence or
wee]) like children at a spoken
word of kindness.
Those in transport must tip their
soldier guards or go cold in cattle
cars; none fed oftener than on al
ternate days.
