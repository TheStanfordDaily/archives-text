# Bad Tide Makes Crew Workout on Lagunita
## 
### 
Due to bad tide conditions on the
estuary, crew practice for the first
part of the week will be held on
Lagunita instead of at Redwood.
Coach Guerena hopes to have his men
out on the estuary by Thursday, how
ever.
Workouts on Lagunita will be in
the pair-oared and four-oared boats,
since all the eight-oared shells are
at Redwood.
Judging from reports from the
north and Berkeley, the Washington
and California crews arc working
overtime in order to defeat Stanford
in the big regatta. Over fifty fresh
men are out at California, and the
varsity boats seem to be in good
shape. The Blue and Gold coach is
determined to get the eights into his
style of rowing and as a result only
two of last year's veterans are getting
a place regularly in the varsity shell.
