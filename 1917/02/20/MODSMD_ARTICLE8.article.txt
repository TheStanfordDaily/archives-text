# FRESHMAN TRACK TEAM TO MEET SAN JOSE
## SLATED ON SATURDAY Captain Samis Believes "Babes" Will Have Strong Squad For Dual Meet 
### 
STANFORD freshmen's track squad
meet the San Jose high school
team on the Cardinal oval, Satur
day, in the first dual meet of the year.
Iti addition to this, Coach Templeton
and Captain Aupperle will in all prob
ability have competition arranged for
the varsity men in between events of
the freshmen meet.
1!>20 In Good Shape.
Captain Milt Sainis reports that his
men are working out in good shape
daily, and from all indications should
give a good account of themselves
Saturday. The babes' weakness seems
to be in the hurdles and weights.
However, W. I?. Wells, though always
sprinting heretofore, is now working
out in the hurdles, and judging from
his work in the preliminary meet last
week, is going to be heard from.
Hansen, a big, long-legged freshman
from Oakland, and Hartman, are now
out for the stick events, and Samis is
hopeful of them developing into point
winners.
In the 100-yard event, the freshmen
look to have excellent material, Dink-
I elspiel, Wells, Maynard and Miner ap
pearing to be tiie most promising of
the lot. Each of them looks to be
consistent :10 1-5 to 2-5 men. Other
freshmen out for the 100 are Davis,
Langford, Considine, and H. S. Wells.
This entire group are also out for
the 220-yard dash, with an addition of
Suttle and Howes. Frank Sloman may
enter this event, in which case more
points could be chalked up for the
freshmen.
Of the quarter-milers, Sloman and
Hudner appear sure point winners.
Sloman is present holder of the inter
scholastic record of :48, while Hudner
has done about :53, which is gener
ally fast enough to be assured of a
place in a freshmen meet. Crawford
is another fast man in the 440. Al
bouze, Heath, Hall and Mosiman are
also working out for this.
In the 880 is Colglazier, who is also
very good in the mile. Wilke, who
finished second to Schnell, Saturday,
is showing a world of class. Berry
and Moore are the other 1920 men
working out.
Captain Samis will run the mile, as
will Colglazier, Terman and Park.
Samis will enter the two-mile, with
Bedford and Carlyle as teammates.
Samis is now in splendid condition,
and holds an enviable record as a J
distance man, so the babes look to be
well fixed in all distance events.
In Don Weaver the 1920 boys have
a star high jumper, but Weaver will
be unable to compete Saturday on
account of a sprained ankle. Six feet
and better is Weaver's record. Heath
is showing up well.
As to broad jumpers, there seems to
be a shortage of material, as there is 1
in fact in all field events. Nagel ap- j
pears a point getter.
In the pole vault, Davis appears to j
be the best bet, and he ought to do i
11 feet at least. Baer and Dewing are !
practicing daily. Scott is working out
daily tossing the hammer and is show- j
ing immense improvement. He is
throwing it about 105 feet at present.!
From all indications, the freshmen
possess a strong team this year, with
the exception of the weak spots in
the hurdles and weight events, but
Coach "Ric" Tenipleton believes that
he can develop men for these places,
and bolster up the squad.
