Angeles College of Osteopathy will
also be present at the Robins lectures
at U. S. C.
From Aizona comes reports of 95
per cent of the student body turning
out to the talks by Robins. Equal en
thusiasm greeted Robins at the col
leges and universities of Oregon and
Washington. His last stop before
reaching Stanford will be at the Uni

All other attractions have been
sidetracked to give Raymond Robins
a clear field during his visit here.
The English Club play was postponed
to March 9, so that there would be
no conflict with his address Friday
evening, March 2. Robins will make
his first appearance on the Stanford
campus a week from Thursday, at the
11 o'clock assembly.
