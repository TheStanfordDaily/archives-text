# OUST ROUGHS FOR CONDUCT DURING DANCE
## SUSPEND INDEFINITELY Student Council Follows Warnings With Action over Two Upperclass Men 
### 
FOLLOWING frequent warnings,
Men's Student Council today an
nounced the suspension of a sen
ior student, and of a junior student,
both for indefinite periods, for objec
tionable conduct at campus dances
while under the influence of liquor.
These two actions were decided upon
at Council meetings Saturday and
Monday, but were officially ratified
late today by the Council president,
the chairman of the Faculty Commit
tee 011 Student Affairs, and the Presi
dent of the University.
Council lias Warned.
Repeated warnings have been given
by the Council that objectionable
roughing must stop, and that every
effort would be made to end it. These
actions are the first definite steps that
have been taken to do away with this
form of roughing, and indicate that
the Council is firm in its efforts to
eradicate this evil.
The Conference, at its meeting last
Thursday night, expressed itself as
being back of the Council in its at
tempt to abolish the objectionable
roughing, and a motion was passed
that Conference members would aid
the Council in every way possible to
put down all such roughing at campus
dances, especially all acts of vandal
ism, by securing evidence of offenses,
and reporting to the Council.
In taking this action, the Council is
not objecting to ordinary roughing as
practiced on the campus, but is ob
pecting to all acts of vandalism, in
truding in places where dances are
being conducted, and all such acts
which are characterized as objection
able roughing and of which there has
been frequent complaint of late.
