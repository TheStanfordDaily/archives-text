# AN AWAKENING
## 
### 
It seems that the stand taken, last
week by the Student Conference in re
gard to roughing at dances was not,
after all, hot air, as some evidently
believed. This fact has been forcibly
impressed by the recent action of the
Council in dealing out retribution for
acts of vandalism. It is gratifying to
find that it is no longer safe to com
mit offenses on the campus, which, if
perpetrated elsewhere, would probably
land the guilty parties behind the bars.
We are getting somewhere! In fact,
we hope we have arrived at a place
where no further action of the kind
will be necessary. One warning ought
to be sufficient.
Aside from the immediate benefit
derived, we see in this incident a good
omen for student government at Stan
ford. This proves that, when the Con
ference will, it can throw off the cloak
of apathy which seems to have shroud
ed it in the past, and proceed to ac
complish something really tangible.
With the birth of a conscience, the
Conference, in cooperation with the
Council, can successfully and effici
ently solve all problems of discipline.
We often hear it said that student
control is but a form, that the stu
dents really don't control anything,
and that the faculty dictate all actions
to our governmental bodies. These
are sweeping and exaggerated state
ments. There is a field for student
control, and a wide one, which is not
encroached upon, and will not be en
croached upon if we live up to our
end of the agreement. We are here
as students in the University for a
purpose. The President of the Uni
versity is also here for a purposeâ€”
he is responsible to the trustees for
what happens on the campus. Is it
reasonable to suppose that the fac
ulty will say: "Here are the reins
of government. Take them and do
what you will?" In the final analysis
are we not responsible to the faculty?
It seems to us we are.
Then why say we have no student
government? What we do, or should
do, is to remove the burden of keep
ing order among the students from
the shoulders of the faculty. That is
our province, and it was given us in
the hope that we could do it as well
and with less friction than the faculty.
They have the right to expect us to
live up to our part of the bargain.
If we don't, we can't expect them to
keep hands off.
