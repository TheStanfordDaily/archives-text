# Realism Is Keynote of "Justice" Acts
## Alcazar Artists Complete Work on Three Great Prison Scenes of Drama 
### 
"Justice" is but a trifle over two
weeks distant. With the completion
of the great conrt-roOm scene and the
dismal prison walls, the sound of the
hammer has died away in the Assem
bly Hall. The Alcazar Theater has
done its work well. When Sword and
Sandals raises the walls of the court
room and the prison into position,
there will stand many tributes to the
work of the scenic artist.
The gigantic splendor of the court
room with its half-hundred electirc
lights and six levels has already been
told. "Justice" has three prison pic
tures in its third act. One is the of
fice of the prison governor, who can
see from his window, the hapless con
victs exercising in the yard. Scene
two is the corridor lined with solitary
cells. Scene three is the interior
of the cell of Falder. Not a word is
spoken during this tremendously pow
erful episode. Hut Galsworthy tells in
vivid pantomime the mental and phy
sical torture that confinement brings
upon Falder.
Prison liars, dull grey stone floors,
unyielding walls, heavy doors and the
dull, metallic ring of prisoners beating
against them, combine to saturate the
third act of "Justice" with that at
mosphere of deep gloom which will
stamp the drama indelibly upon the
minds of its audience.
