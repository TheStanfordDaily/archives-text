# Three Days Remain to Help War Relief
## 
### 
Rut three days remain in which to
bring Stanford's share in the work of
relieving the European war prisoners
up to its proper size. Representatives
in the various living groups have met
with considerable response in many
cases and it is now expected that by
Saturday night, when the campaign
must be finished, that Stanford's of
fering will be worthy of taking its
place among the contributions given
by practically all eastern and middle
western colleges and universites.
From statistics compiled it lias boon
shown that despite the pride Stanford
people take in their relief work, but
very little has actually been given by
students alone. The money given one
year and a half ago for Belgium relief
from the men amounted to a little
over $300, from women less than $ 1 HO.
For the Pellissier Memorial but $:>OO
was raised from students —all told an
average of less than forty cents per
person has been given by students in
the last two years. With these figures
the committee of students which is
working to relieve the sufferings of
thousands of soldiers —many of them
college men —who are confined in ver
min-infested prison camps to rot away
for lack of proper care, is confident of
realizing a large sum.
