"Step right in," Co-Edna said, as her
mafi called at the snrority house. "I'll be
ready in just a minute. This is going to be
a keen treat."
The treat is a dinner at Wilson's.
First they had an evening di/tner in a Wil
son cozy booth, then they took in an evening
entertainment. Needless to say. it made a
hit. Such an evening would make a hit
with any girl.
