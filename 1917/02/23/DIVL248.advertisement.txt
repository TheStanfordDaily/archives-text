Direction of Frank L. Mathieu, staged by
Sword and Sandals, co-operating
with the Alcazar Theatre
"Justice" is a drama created out of new material by new
methods. Lt bears little or no relation to the average cut-and
dried play. Its striking keynote is stark and naked realism.
Friday Evening
March 9
Seats Tuesday, March (>, Stanford Bookstore,
Weingartner Drug Company, at 12:50 o'clock.
No raise in prices—one d011ar,75 and 50 cents.
You'll remember —
The dramatic story, the "chariot
wheels of justice."
The all-star cast of forty.
Six scenes of action.
Prison corridors that tell their
story without a spoken word.
WILLIAM FALDER.
