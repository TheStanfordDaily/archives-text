Scaf/ I'm saving this for VELVET!
MOTHER NATURE Protects Your Tobacco IF You Smoke VELVET
She sees to it that Velvets mellowness
and aroma arc not created by artificial
methods, but by her very own. That is—
A complete natural curing for two
year,: during which time the tobacco
remains, untouched, in its original
wool :n !v heads. At the end of
two ycr. • it i-; made into Velvet and is
as smooth as its name implies.

Men have tried—and will pry—to beat
this method by quick curing or arti
ficial processes, but Mother Nature's
way—the Velvet way—remains the
very best.
It costs us more money to prepare
Velvet in this way—it will cost you
only 10 cents to prove Velvet, at die
first store you come to!
