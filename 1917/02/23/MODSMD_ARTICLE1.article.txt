# BASKETBALL FIVE WINS ONE AND DROPS ONE
## TEAMWORK LACKING Varsity Conquers Nevada but Is Handed Defeat by O.A.C. 
### 
STANFORD won one game and lost
the other in the two basketball
contests played Wednesday and
Thursday in Encina gymnasium.
University of Nevada went down to
defeat before the varsity by the close
score of 33 to 30, but the team from
Oregon Agricultural College was too
much for the Cardinal, and the tally
at the end of forty minutes of fast
play was 23 to 17 in favor of the vis
itors.
"Varsity in Poor Form.
The varsity was in poor form for
both contests, the win in the Nevada
game resulting from a rally in which
some real basketball was played. In
the O. A. C. contest the Cardinal play
ers led by a score of 15 to 9 at the
end of the first half, but in the sec
ond period they lost all semblance of
teamwork, with the result that not
a basket was chalked up to Stanfonrd's
credit, while the Aggies made six.
The Cardinal started out like a real
winner in the O. A. C. contest, making
two baskets in quick succession, the
first by Bonney and the next by Roney
—both on difficult shots. The Aggies
came back and tied the score at seven
all. Sullivan quickly put the varsity
in the lead with one of his long shots
and Greve followed a moment after
with the most sensational shot ever
seen 011 the local floor, a basket from
oyer three-quai 'tei s down the court.
t Ray, the Aggies captain, after the
Stanford rally , ca me through with a
basket, but Si illiva 11 followed with an
other phenor jenal tally, and the half
ended with t he see re 15 to 9.
In the second t ialf all the Aggies
work depended on Sieberts, who made
four baskc ; ts and threw two fouls.
Stanford's two counters came as a re
sult of foals by Hon ney. Towards the
latter pa rt of this period Pelouze and
Rigliter were sent in to save the game,
but the lead was to o great, and the
final w rustle found th e score 23 to 17.
The Nevada contest, Wednesday,
was 1' eaturel by the playing of Estes,
who made eight field baskets and
three foul points. 1 lighter and Greve
put up a strong brand of ball also, but
the team as a whole showed a lack of
team-play, winning only by making
fifteen points after the Nevada team
bad the game apparently won.
