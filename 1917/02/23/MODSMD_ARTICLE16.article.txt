# Budget Approval Makes Four-Quarter Plan Sure
## NINE FACULTY MEN ARE PROMOTED Trustees Approve Closer Supervision of Graduate Student Work 
### 
WITH the appropriation of a
budget for the coming year
financing college work all the
year around, the new four-quarter
system became a certainty, according
to an announcement from the Presi
dent's office this afternoon. The bud
get was passed by the Board of Trus
tees at a meeting in San Francisco
this afternoon.
Plan Finances.
Financing the summer quarter was
the only thing holding back the assur
ance of the four-quarter system. The
new budget provides for salaries, de
partmental equipment, and other
necessaries for the fourth quarter.
The Law department was authorized
to hold a summer session of six weeks
beginning June 25 next. It will be
under the same regulations as the
summer school conducted last sum
mer.
A number of other business plans
were approved by the Board of Trus
tees at the annual budget session.
Among them are approval of plans
for the Monterey Marine Laboratory,
abandonment of the teaching of ele
mentary foreign languages, promotion
of a number of members of the teach
ing staff, and establishment of two
scholarships for graduates. Here
after, graduate work will be more
closely supervised.
Elementary foreign languages will
not be taught after two years. This
plan was adopted because high schools
teach elementary courses in modern
languages, enabling the University to
begin advanced work.
Professor E. C. Franklin was made
chairman of a new committee to sup
ervise work of graduate students.
This new committee will have general
supervision of graduate work.
He will be known as the Dean of
Graduate Study.
Two fellowships of $500 each were
placed at the disposal of Profesor
Franklin for graduate students. The
holders of these new scholarships will
be named from the graduates at large
and will be chosen for individual merit
and genuine ability. These two
changes affecting graduates were rec
ommended by the faculty some time
ago for establishment by the Board
of Trustees any time they could pro
vide the funds.
Nine members of the teaching staff
are affected by promotions. The fol
lowing promotions were authorized:
From the rank of associate profes
sor to that of professor: D. E. Folsom
of the Mining department, Karl G.
Rendtorff of the German department,
