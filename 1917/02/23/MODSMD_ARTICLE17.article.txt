## Series of Addresses Scheduled For First Five Days of March 
### 
Reality is the keynote of the mes
sage Raymond Robins, noted political,
labor and social leader, will bring to
Stanford when he arrives on the cam
pus next Thursday, to address the
students of the University in a series
of lectures, March 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
"Everything he teaches he either has
lived or is attempting to put into
practice today," said one noted na
tional leader, when speaking of Rob
ins' addresses to college audiences.
Ittihins' Life Story.
Robins knows life. He started out
as a poor boy in the south, working
in the mines until he saved enough
money to go to college. He finally se
cured a diploma from an eastern law
college, was admitted to the Cali
fornia bar at the age of thirty, and
soon established a legal reputation.
Then came the strike in
Alaska, and Robins forsook his prac
tice here and weiu jo Alaska, where
he made a "strike" which yielded him
a small fortune. He returned to the
states, and thereafter devoted his life
to the uplift of humanity, and devel
oped into one of the best speakers in
the United States.
A Social Worker.
For fifteen years he has worked in
the notorious Seventeeth Ward of
Chicago, helping to alleviate social
and labor conditions. This ward has
an area of one square mile and con
tains eighty thousand people of twen
ty different nationalities.
Robins has been a national political
leader for the last ten years. He was
chairman of the Progressive conven
tion of 1912, which nominated Theo
dore Roosevelt, and was temporary
chairman of the Progressive national
convention last year.
Theodore Roosevelt says, "There is
not a man in the country who can do
greater service to the college man
than Raymond Robins can by his lec
tures." He has also been heartily en
dorsed by such men as William J.
Bryan, Hiram Johnson, .T. R. Mott and
John G. Hibben.
