# THE 						STAFF

### 
We greatly regret that, on the day
of announcing the staff, there are also
several resignations to record. This
semester we have more than our
share, due to various causes.
Miss Olive Yoder, '16, last semes
ter's Woman's Editor, has found it
necessary to give up her work on The
Daily Palo Alto, due to pressure of
scholastic activities; the elusive
honor-point has also robbed us of H.
S. Marshutz, '17. J. M. Sawtelle, '18,
who has served as news editor for the
past year, is one of our greatest
losses, as is C. A. Randau, '19. Ran
dau, who left with others to drive an
ambulance on the French front, will
no doubt return to The Daily next se
mester.
In addition to these, Miss Katlierine
Sheldon, '17, Miss Fannie Knox, '18,
Miss Velona Pilcher, 'IS, and D. G.
Greist, '20, have been compelled to
drop the work.
It is more pleasant by far to wel
come back on the staff, W. D. Smalley,
'18, who takes the place of news edi
tor which he left by failure to return
to the University last semester, and to
announce the promotion of W. E.
Bruns, '19, and L. O. Weaver, '19, to
the rank of news editors. These men
thoroughly deserve this reward for
their faithful work on the paper.
Four new men have been added to
the staff as a result of this semester's
tryouts. They are L. W. Dinkelspiel,
'20, Ryder Patten, '20, E. 13. Chapman,
'20, and D. R. Lee, '20. Miss Olga
Narvestad, '18, and Miss Ruth Searcy,
'20, have been added to the women's
staff.
