Editor Daily Palo Alto:
A writer in the recent Illustrated
Review, praising the fairness of the
honor-point system, asked, "How then,
can it be fairly said that the honor
point system is intended Jo, or in
practice actually does, require an>
more of a student than a C average?"
Why, to be sure, by merely looking
the facts in the face, instead of bury
ing them in cold logic. As Mr. De
fender does, we take an A to equal 95
per cent, B 85, C 75, D G5, and a fail
ure 55 per cent. The result of aver
aging these figures is 75 per cent, the
C average. Let up apply these figures
to a possible 15-hour report card on
which the student earns of A, B, C, D,
and failure, each three hours. His
scholastic average is 75, or C, there
fore. But behold the honor-points.
From the three hours of A he will
earn 6 honor-points, from the three
hours of B, 4%, from the C, 3, from
the D hours, no honor points, and for
the three hours of failure he will lose
4% honor-points. Obviously, then,
the B's and the failures, bringing as
they do, positive and 4/ negative
points, offset each other. There re
main for the C average card hut 9
honor points!
On the other hand, the honor-point
system employed in two great middle
western universities and in our own
Economics department until the adop
tion of the University system, awarded
3 points for A, 2 for B, 1 for C, none
for D, and subtracted 1 for failure.
Such a system will average exactly C!
If Mr. Defender will but re-read
"Enter the Faculty Guillotine" in the
January Review, which article he as
sails, he will be startled to perceive
that article criticise only the honor
point system as adopted here, and es
pecially the negative feature of it.
"Would it be incorrect to look upon
the opposition to the system as a
struggle upon the part of the unfit to
keep from being eliminated?" Mr.
Defender has asked. No, Mr. De
fender, it would not. But why not
open your eyes to the significant fact
that the University prefers an honor
point system not to be a pereolater by
means of which to rid the institution
of students who caunot average C, but
rather to act as an incentive for bet
ter grades. And, Mr. Defender, re
member that the students who have
the time, the opportunity, and the
brains to earn A's and B's (like your
self, perhaps)—such students require
no honor-point system; it was never
intended for them, but was designed
for students whose lack of brain, time,
or of ambition, gave them C's, D's,
B's, and occasionally a failure. For
such students —for those who make
one misstep in their senior year, the
honor-point system as Stanford has
it, spells defeat.
Remember, too, brave Defender,
that when a student fails in say, three
hours, he not only loses i l / 2 honor
points, but the 3 units of credit. To
recuperate, he must first earn addi
tional credits; secondly, the honor
points that these additional credits
demand, and thirdly, enough honor
points to offset the loss of 4%. Why
speak of rewards without punish
ments?
Perhaps, Mr. Defender, not having
been to Rome, you know not of what
you speak when you praise the
Romans. H. S. M„ '17.

ter grades. And, Mr. Defender, re
member that the students who have
the time, the opportunity, and the
brains to earn A's and B's (like your
self, perhaps)—such students require
no honor-point system; it was never
intended for them, but was designed
for students whose lack of brain, time,
or of ambition, gave them C's, D's,
B's, and occasionally a failure. For
such students —for those who make
one misstep in their senior year, the
honor-point system as Stanford has
it, spells defeat.
Remember, too, brave Defender,
that when a student fails in say, three
hours, he not only loses i l / 2 honor
points, but the 3 units of credit. To
recuperate, he must first earn addi
tional credits; secondly, the honor
points that these additional credits
demand, and thirdly, enough honor
points to offset the loss of 4%. Why
speak of rewards without punish
ments?

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
A writer in the recent Illustrated
Review, praising the fairness of the
honor-point system, asked, "How then,
can it be fairly said that the honor
point system is intended Jo, or in
practice actually does, require an>
more of a student than a C average?"
Why, to be sure, by merely looking
the facts in the face, instead of bury
ing them in cold logic. As Mr. De
fender does, we take an A to equal 95
per cent, B 85, C 75, D G5, and a fail
ure 55 per cent. The result of aver
aging these figures is 75 per cent, the
C average. Let up apply these figures
to a possible 15-hour report card on
which the student earns of A, B, C, D,
and failure, each three hours. His
scholastic average is 75, or C, there
fore. But behold the honor-points.
From the three hours of A he will
earn 6 honor-points, from the three
hours of B, 4%, from the C, 3, from
the D hours, no honor points, and for
the three hours of failure he will lose
4% honor-points. Obviously, then,
the B's and the failures, bringing as
they do, positive and 4/ negative
points, offset each other. There re
main for the C average card hut 9
honor points!
On the other hand, the honor-point
system employed in two great middle
western universities and in our own
Economics department until the adop
tion of the University system, awarded
3 points for A, 2 for B, 1 for C, none
for D, and subtracted 1 for failure.
Such a system will average exactly C!
If Mr. Defender will but re-read
"Enter the Faculty Guillotine" in the
January Review, which article he as
sails, he will be startled to perceive
that article criticise only the honor
point system as adopted here, and es
pecially the negative feature of it.
"Would it be incorrect to look upon
the opposition to the system as a
struggle upon the part of the unfit to
keep from being eliminated?" Mr.
Defender has asked. No, Mr. De
fender, it would not. But why not
open your eyes to the significant fact
that the University prefers an honor
point system not to be a pereolater by
means of which to rid the institution
of students who caunot average C, but
rather to act as an incentive for bet
ter grades. And, Mr. Defender, re
