# Major Bugge to Hold Tests for Army Positions
## 
### 
Major Jens Bugge lias been ap
pointed examining officer for candi
dates for commissions in the Federal
Reserve Officers' Corps, and also for
men who wish to take examinations
for commissions in me regular army.
The recommendations of the head of
the Stanford Military Corps will go
through without any trouble, and as
several men have been considering
joining the National Reserves, they
will now have no trouble if their work
with the Stanford Corps has been
good.
Dozen Men Eligible.
The major says that there are
about a dozen men in the corps now
who will be worthy of recommenda
tions for commissions as lieutenants
in reserves, without examination, in
May, if they desire it. This one year
here counts as two years elsewhere
because the corps has already cov
ered more than the government re
quires.
After the advanced course for up
perclassmen lias been started, as it
probably will be next semester, a
graduate from the Stanford corps
will be able to pass the examination
for a commission in the regular army
without any trouble. Major Bugge
expects that some of the men will
want to do that because the pay is
nearly $2000 a year and the life very
interesting. The examination is in
four subjects, one of which is a choice
of about a dozen subjects.
Men who took military drill for two
semesters for six hours each, will be
exempt from the new University rul

ing that says either drill or athletics
must be taken by all underclassmen
starting next semester. This first
year will count as two, because the
time was double what it will be in
the future.
