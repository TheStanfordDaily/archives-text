three eights were on the water, but
for the first time Coach "Husky"
Gueroaa allowed them to speed up
their stroke and race over short dis
tances.
The varsity boat that, was at Pougli
keepsie has been at the Redwood boat
house for some time, but it was put
in use for the iirst time yesterday.
Seats from the sefcond freshmen boat
were putin the varsity shell and part
of the varsity candidates used it.
This boat has been at Poughkcepsie
since the race in 1915 and was brought
across the continent this winter, and
brought down to Redwood the first of
the crew season.

his men in the best of shape, in addi
tion to the partial . training rules
which were put into effect last week,
has ordered that every crew candi
date must run two miles every day.
