# Lowell Swimmers Versus Freshmen in Aquatic Meet
## 
### 
Lowell High swimmers will come
down to Stanford tomorrow to meet
the freshmen aggregation at 2 o'clock
in the Encina pool. The San Fran
cisco school did not send down their
list of entries, but as they have held
the swimming championship of the
city for eight consecutive years, their
team is sure to give the Cardinal
freshmen a close meet.
Coach Brandsten will enter the same
men who defeated Commerce High,
last week.
