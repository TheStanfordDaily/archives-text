# Visiting Soccer Men Capture Two Games
## 
### 
Stanford indoor soccer Teams A and
B were both defeated by San Fran
cisco aggregations, last Wednesday
night, before the largest crowd of the
season. Union Iron Works team
bested the A team by the score of 9-4,
and the Burns quintet took the large
score of a 9-3 game with Team B.
March 3d is the date of the next
outdoor soccer game, when the varsity
and freshmen will travel to San
Francisco to take on the Olympic
seniors and juniors respectively.
The freshmen tied the juniors last
Saturday but the varsity was defeated
when the Olympic teams were here,
and the games on the 3d are return
games.
