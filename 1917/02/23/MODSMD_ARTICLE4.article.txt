"Mere Man" was cast into chains by
"Mere Woman;" a squad of simulant
co-eds were garbed in rather uncon

bartenders dispersed drinks from
wicked looking bottles that contained
nothing but water; the "Stanford Pre
serves" were represented by a com
pany of anaemic militarists; the
Campus Detective maintained order
among the "queeners;" the efforts of
a pure white "Vice Crusade Crusader"
were balked by the actions of some
questionable characters; and there
were farcical travesties and laughable
burlesques on every event that has
happened of late on the campus.
