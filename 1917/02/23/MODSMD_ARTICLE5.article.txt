# Nationalism Result of War Says Miller
## 
### 
That the economic reconstruction of
Europe will be brought about through
nationalism rather than international
ism was the opinion expressed at the
third of the series of Union lectures,
by Assistant Professor S. I. Miller,
Jr., of the Economics department.
Seven-tenths of our activity is eco
nomic activity, and around this as a
center our nationalism grows, accord
ing to Professor Miller. The economic
outcome of the war means an inevit
able redistribution of wealth, of labor,
and of land —such redistributions must
act for the building up of each unit of
society, or the building up of all the
classes on a new economic basis.
This economic emancipation of all
the classes through nationalism will
make for permanent peace, for perm
anent peace cannot exist where there
are groups of people miserable be
cause of economic conditions.
These people, that they may main
tain their old standard of living as
existed before the war, will tend to
emigrate to those countries where the
rehabilitation of capital will not take
place. For this reason, all the Euro
pean countries will probably pass em
igration laws, Professor Miller be
lieves.
