# Ahoy! Do You Look Rather Serious?
## If So, Here's a Chance for You to Appear in Court-Room Scene of "Justice" 
### 
i Are you serious-minded in appear
! ance? Can you look twice your actual
age? There may be a pair of spec
tacles to aid you, or a wig, and cer
tainly a makeup, but Frank Mathieu
prefers you "an natural" 011 the stage
in the big court-room scene of "Jus
tice."
Forty people will fill the six levels
|of the stage as constructed for the
j second act of the Galsworthy work,
j In one tier will be jurymen, in an
j other reporters, and in a third a silent
! audience, barristers and witnesses
I connected with cases that are listed
on the court's calendar to follow that
English Club is now scouting on the
campus and in Palo Alto for experi
enced jurymen, or persons who can
act like experienced jurymen, and for
experienced reporters, or persons who
can mimic reporters.
If you can qualifyâ€”if you can look
serious, if you can appear to be twice
your actual age, Frank Mathieu may
care to see you as a candidate for a
seat in the court-room of "Justice."
Two weeks from tonight "Justice"
is to be presented in the Assembly
Hall. Seat-sales will be held as is
customary with Stanford productions,
one week from next Tuesday, at the
Stanford Bookstore, and at the Wein
gartner Drug Company, in Palo Alto.
The time for the drawing is set for
12:50.
