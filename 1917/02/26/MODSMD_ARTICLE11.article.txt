# Turn War Funds in to Professor Grass
## 
### 
Contributions for the Stanford War
Prisoners Relief Fund will be received
immediately by Assistant Professor
D. F. Grass, student accountant, in
his office in the Economics building
in the morning, or in the Union in the
afternoon. The collection of this fund
was ended on Saturday and all money
must be immediately turned over to
him. He will send it to the World's
Student Christian Federation in New
York, which has charge of the work
of relieving the thousands of prison
ers confined in the military prisons of
Europe.
