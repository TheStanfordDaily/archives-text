# Union Smoker Next Wednesday Evening
## Wrestling, Boxing, Music, and Recitations for Second Entertainment 
### 
Two wrestling bouts, a boxing
match, good music, and a recitation
by Professor L. E. Passett will be the
entertainment offered by the Union
Smoker committee Wednesday night
This smoker is the second of several
to be given this semester to boost the
Union. It is open to both members
and non-members.
Men who are to meet California in
the matches later, will stage two good
wrestling bouts, according to the com
mittee. The "fistic encounter" will
be fast and furious, with two of the
cleverest men in the University taking
part.
Professor Passett has entertained
Stanford audiences several times, and
promises to give as many encores as
bis voice will stand, with his recita
tions. The music for the smoker will
be furnished by the same men who
played at the last smoker and will
include a good variety of the latest
pieces.
