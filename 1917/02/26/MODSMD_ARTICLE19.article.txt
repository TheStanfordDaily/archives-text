# HAWKSHAW MYTHS
## 
### 
In spite of their evident absurdity,
Hawkshaw rumors concerning the ad
ministration still continue to float
on the campus breezes. False whisk
ers and rubber soles are attributed to
the President in his effort to get
"wood" on the University men. Stu
dents are presumably trailed on their
trips off the campus, and the knowl
edge thus acquired is used in dealing
swift retribution to all miscreants.
These are some of the stories which
seem to pass as absolute truths
among many of Stanford's Two
Thousand. How such rumors ever
started is a matter of conjecture, but
that they should be blindly accepted
for face value seems preposterous.
A man can't sit in the presidential
chair of a university as large as Stan
ford, ami spend much time in twirling
his thumbs. There are plenty of use
ful things to do. In fact, we venture
to suggest t-hat the President is kept
pretty much on the jump all the time.
It is unlikely that he would wish to
add any further burden in the way of
a detective agency . We merely sug
gest this as a physical handicap to a
spy system, assuming that it would be
otherwise desired by a man big
enough to be executive head of this
University. Such a desire, however, is
inconceivable.
We are convinced that sleuthing has
no place in the administration of
Stanford. It may be asked, "Well,
how about the case of John Doe? Is
this not positive proof that there is
something in the business?" If those
who have heard about this case will
take the trouble to investigate, they
will no doubt be convinced that it is
anything but proof. Information often
comes to the President's office through
the medium of outside complaints. If
Stanford men conduct themselves in
such a way as to attract unfavorable
notice from those outside of the Uni
versity, it is quite natural that the
fact will reach the ears of the Presi
dent without effort on his part.
Stories expand with every repetition,
so that the most innocent fact soons
grows into a fabrication of astound
ing proportions, which passes as gen-

uine. We should learn to discount
these hearsay tales, and to verify be
fore we repeat them as truths.
Better still, let's get to the bottom
of the matter, and prevent these rum
ors from ever getting started. We
can think of only two sources from
which the germs of such stories as
have been circulated about adminis
trative sleuthing could have issued.
Either they are born of carelessness
in the President's office, or from a
spirit of malicious mischief among
some students. We are loath to be
lieve the latter, but think the former
possible. If the students are at fault,
it behooves them to get busy and cor
rect the erroneous impression they
have created; if the President's office,
it would be well to guard with greater
care the information whicli comes
from that source. A conditional hint
is often enough to start a flurry on
the quad.
