# Palo Alto Boy Is Drowned in Creek
## 
### 
Harold Mogeson, 12-year-old son of
P. Mogeson, of the University Cream
ery of Palo Alto, was drowned in the
San Francisquito Creek, to the north
of Palo Alto, yesterday. Young
Mogeson was playing on the Middle
field Road bridge and fell in. His
companions were unable to do any
thing to save him, but turned in a fire
alarm for the Pope street bridge, sev
eral blocks below.
Several rescue parties were imme
diately organized, a wire net was
placed, with great difficulty, across
the creek just before it empties into
the bay, a boat was secured from
Lagunita and taken carefully down
stream from the scene where the boy
fell in, but all in vain. Up to a late
hour this afternoon the body was still
undiscovered. The probability is that
it is caught on a submerged snag and
will not be found until the flood
waters caused by the recent rains go
down.
