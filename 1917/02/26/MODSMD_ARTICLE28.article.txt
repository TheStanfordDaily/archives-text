VarSitV Tee teams of Stan
ford and California are scheduled to
clash at Tait's Winter Garden in San
Francisco, Friday evening, in the sec
ond big game of the year in this sport.
The first big game went to California
by a 4 to 1 victory.
The varsity's prospects have re
ceived a severe set-back owing to the
injury of D. F. Purdy, '18, in the initial
contest. Purdy is at present con
fined in the Peninsula Hospital, and
he will probably not be in the game
Friday.
