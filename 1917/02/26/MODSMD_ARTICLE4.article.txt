# Dr. Wilbur Is... Modest Man; ... So He Claims
## 
### 
President Wilbur says he is
being credited with being the most
imaginative man this side of the
Rockies. According to him, he
doesn't deserve credit for all the
plans that people thing he orig
inates. Here's the situation, as
the President describes it:
"Practically every day some
one calls me over the phone or
comes in to protest some new
fangled scheme I've been credited
with starting. First, it's a plan
for drying up the lake, then it's
painting the roof of the quad yel
low, or establishing Sunday
classes, or putting in a spy sys
tem to see how much soda water
Stanford people drink in San
Francisco, or of following people
in my machine, or of moving the
postofficfe down to Mayfleld."
President Wilbur is a modest
man, and he hates to take credit
for things he doesn't do, he says.
Furthermore, hie likes to have
people support him in his plans,
but he feels that admirers who
are continually starting the above
stories to his credit, are letting
their admiration overstep the
bounds of honesty.
"Anyway, I'm glad to have peo
ple come in and ask about such
stories," said President Wilbur.
"I'll tell them the truth about
anything that doesn't hurt some
one."
