# Spook Drops Down on Sorority Sisters
## 
### 
In a certain sorority house on
the campus, shortly after mid
night yesterday, all was quiet as
the grave "not a creature was
stirring, not even a mouse.' Up
stairs the sisters slept in sweet
oblivion.
Suddenly, from somewhere on
the first, floor, there came a great,
resounding crash, followed by sev
eral minor smashes, and the ap
parent sound of hurrying feet.
Almost simultaneously each door
on the second and third floors
was thrown open, and badly
frightened, half-awakened co-eds
tip-toed around the balls.
Thoughts of burglars—real ones,
not "reel" ones —entered their
minds and increased their discom
fiture. The house-mother, armed
with an antiquated revolver, began
to descend the stairs, followed by
some of the less timorous sisters.
At the landing the procession
halted.
"Who's there?" quavered the
house-mother. "Hands up— an
swer or I'll shoot." Of course
there was no answer,' In her
tremulous shivers one of the sis
ters brushed the electric light
button, the room was sudenly il
luminated, and they saw
No, not any bold, bad burglar,
but a heap of plaster on the floor
and a stream of water dripping
from a gaping hole in the ceiling.
The rain of last week had proven
too much for the plaster.
