accept the short end of a 19 to 18

was the second of the series of two
games played with the Aggies and
proved to be one of the best games
of the season, although there were no
sensational plays.

Stanford were tied, with an 8 to 8
count, each five with two baskets and
four fouls to its credit. With the
opening of the second half Bonney

ket, but after this the Aggies went
ahead and were never bested.

latter part of the basketball season
with a bad leg, played Friday. In
spite of his handicap he was the star
for the Cardinals.

unable to break up the fast team-work
of the Aggies. As in the first game,
the northerners improved with time,
while the Stanford men lost form and
fight.
The freshmen game proved to. be
fast and close from the first whistle.
