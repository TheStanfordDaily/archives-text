# ST. MARY'S TO PLAY VARSITY ON WEDNESDAY
## GAME CALLED AT 4:15 Second Baseball Contest of Series on Varsity Lot Tomorrow 
### 
STANFORD varsity meets St.
Mary's for the second game of the
annual series tomorrow afternoon
011 the Cardinal diamond. All three
contests will be played at Stanford.
The game will be called promptly at
4:15, and it is expected that seven in
nings will be all that can be played
before darkness. Phealon will umpire,
according to Graduate Manager Beh
rens. The admission price will be 25
cents to all those without season tick
ets.
Teams Are Strong.
Both teams will present their
strongest lineups. The contest is of
considerable importance, as there has
always been a great deal of rivalry
between the opposing tossers. Stan
ford won the first game in the best
exhibition of the year. The final score
was 1 to 0, the Cardinal winning in
the eighth frame.
Collins To Pitch.
It is not expected that Brandon will
again be sent against Stanford. He is
a good pitcher, and a heavy hitter, but
he was pounded hard in the first
game. He will undoubtedly play
somewhere in the lineup. The Phoe
nix aggregation will probably start
Collins on the hill, with Captain Moy
catching. ,
Captain "Doc" Hayes announces
that Hoever will pitch for the locals
if in condition. He has been confined
in the Peninsula Hospital with the
grippe for the past few days, but
may be able to work tomorrow.
Otherwise, Hayes will probably twirl
himself, although Draper may be sent
in. Campbell will catch, Mitchell,
Braden, Stevens and Cowan will play
the infield, and Dickey, Lilly and
Noonan will cavort in the outfield.
