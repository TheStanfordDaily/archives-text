# GRADUATION LOOMS BRIGHTER IN HONOR POINT SYSTEM REVISION
## "A" Standard Boosted and Negative Counts Abolished in New Grade Point Plan, Offering Three Options to Present Students 
### 
Three important changes have been effected in the Honor Point System
at Stanford. They were made by the Academic Council, at a meeting held
late tiiis afternoon, and were in accord with several recommendations re
ceived by the Council from the Faculty, Executive and Scholarship Com
mittees. The new system will be called the Grade Point System, instead of
the Honor Point System. A grade of "A" will be equal to three grade
points, a "B" will give two grade points, and as is now the case, a "C"
grade will entitle the student to one grade point. No grade points will be

given in eases where a "D" credit is
the mark, nor in cases of conditions
or failures; however, 110 minus points
will be applied, as has been the rule
under the Honor Point System.
Students Given Option.
Probably more important than the
above changes, was the decision of
the Council that it may be optional
with the students in attendance on
the University, during the year 1910-
17, to have the tirade Point System
put into effect from the date of ad
mission to the University, or from the
beginning of the first semester '.pf
1916-17, or from the beginning of the
present semester. This option gives
every student a fair chance under the
new system. The students do not
have to choose which time is the best
for them to have the grade system ap
plied to their own records. The Reg
istrar's office will figure out for each
individual student, the number of
grade points that would be allowed,
beginning with, first, the present se
mester, then the last semester, and if
neither one of these methods gives
the student the required number of
points, his records from the time of
his entrance to the University will be
added up and the Grade Point System
applied to them.
No Subtraction of Grades.
As stated above, conditions and fail
ures will not cause a subtraction of
grade points, but a grade point will be
required for each unit of registered
work, whatever the final mark at
tained. No grade points, however,
will be required for registered courses
which are dropped by permission of
the University.
When the Honor Point System was
put into effect at Stanford last se
mester, it was the result of much in
vestigation on the part of the Faculty
Scholarship committee, and the Aca
demic Council. Several systems were
suggested at that time, but the honor
point method seemed to be the most
feasible. The registrar's office imme
diately began checking over the effect
of the honor points on the records
of the students. It was seen that
some changes were necessary, and
this resulted in the action of the
Academic Council today, following the
reports of the Faculty Sfchollarship
and Executive Committees.

individual student, the number of
grade points that would be allowed,
beginning with, first, the present se
mester, then the last semester, and if
neither one of these methods gives
the student the required number of
points, his records from the time of
his entrance to the University will be
added up and the Grade Point System
applied to them.
No Subtraction of Grades.
As stated above, conditions and fail
ures will not cause a subtraction of
grade points, but a grade point will be
required for each unit of registered
work, whatever the final mark at
tained. No grade points, however,
will be required for registered courses
which are dropped by permission of
the University.
When the Honor Point System was
put into effect at Stanford last se
mester, it was the result of much in
vestigation on the part of the Faculty
Scholarship committee, and the Aca
demic Council. Several systems were
suggested at that time, but the honor
point method seemed to be the most
feasible. The registrar's office imme
diately began checking over the effect
of the honor points on the records
of the students. It was seen that
some changes were necessary, and
this resulted in the action of the
Academic Council today, following the
reports of the Faculty Sfchollarship
and Executive Committees.
Three important changes have been effected in the Honor Point System
at Stanford. They were made by the Academic Council, at a meeting held
late tiiis afternoon, and were in accord with several recommendations re
ceived by the Council from the Faculty, Executive and Scholarship Com
mittees. The new system will be called the Grade Point System, instead of
the Honor Point System. A grade of "A" will be equal to three grade
points, a "B" will give two grade points, and as is now the case, a "C"
grade will entitle the student to one grade point. No grade points will be

given in eases where a "D" credit is
the mark, nor in cases of conditions
or failures; however, 110 minus points
will be applied, as has been the rule
under the Honor Point System.
Students Given Option.
Probably more important than the
above changes, was the decision of
the Council that it may be optional
with the students in attendance on
the University, during the year 1910-
17, to have the tirade Point System
put into effect from the date of ad
mission to the University, or from the
beginning of the first semester '.pf
1916-17, or from the beginning of the
present semester. This option gives
every student a fair chance under the
new system. The students do not
have to choose which time is the best
for them to have the grade system ap
plied to their own records. The Reg
istrar's office will figure out for each
individual student, the number of
grade points that would be allowed,
beginning with, first, the present se
mester, then the last semester, and if
neither one of these methods gives
the student the required number of
points, his records from the time of
