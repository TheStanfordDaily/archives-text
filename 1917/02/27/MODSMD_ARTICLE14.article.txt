# CENTURY MAY SEE TRAIN OF WARS MEYER

"This war may not be the end but
only the beginning of a great series
of conflicts that may involve the
whole world," Professor Kuno Meyer,
of the University of Berlin, told a
large audience in the Little Theater
last night. Professor Meyer present
ed the German point of view in the
present world struggle under the sub
ject, "The Aims and Desires of the
German People as Related to the
Present Conflict in Europe."
War Not a Surpirse.
"Like all other great events this
war is the outcome of a condition of
things that have their roots far back
in history," he said, and showed how
the world conflicts "came as a terrible
shock but not as a surprise," to all
the nations involved, who clearly saw
that it was inevitable. Professor
Meyer showed himself a far-seeing
student of world politics by reading
an entry in his diary, written In 1909.
In it he considered it inevitable that
a war must come. He considered at
: that time that it would come in one
| or two years, judging from the prep
arations which he considered England
I had been making since the policy of
King Edward "to isolate and sur
round Germany with a ring of iron.'*
Because of this the war is popularly
known in Germany as King Edward's
War, he said. He supported his idea
that a series of wars may arise out
of the present struggle because of
the fact that while the fate of many
small nations is now being decided
there are still many questions affect
ing every country in the world which
will have to be settled.
Yellow Vs. White.
One of the most significant things
that Professor Meyer emphasized
last night was the possibility of the
present century seeing a conflict be
tween the yellow and white races for
the domination of the Pacific. Japan,
he said, would, at the end of the pres
ent war, be the only nation to come
out unscathed. Under the leadership
of the Japanese the entire east would
unite. Professor Meyer considers a
conflict in the Pacific between white
and yellow inevitable.
In conclusion, Professor Meyer out
lined the possibilities for interna
tional peace, and said that if it could
come through this war, then the mill
ions of lives given would not have
been given in vain. But he said peace
must be preserved not by the patch
work of princes and diplomats, but
must come through the demand of the
people. "If they had insisted on it
soon enough and hard enough," he
said, "the present war would have
been prevented."

conflict in the Pacific between white
and yellow inevitable.
In conclusion, Professor Meyer out
lined the possibilities for interna
tional peace, and said that if it could
come through this war, then the mill
ions of lives given would not have
been given in vain. But he said peace
must be preserved not by the patch
work of princes and diplomats, but
must come through the demand of the
people. "If they had insisted on it
soon enough and hard enough," he
said, "the present war would have
been prevented."
"This war may not be the end but
only the beginning of a great series
of conflicts that may involve the
whole world," Professor Kuno Meyer,
of the University of Berlin, told a
large audience in the Little Theater
last night. Professor Meyer present
ed the German point of view in the
present world struggle under the sub
ject, "The Aims and Desires of the
German People as Related to the
Present Conflict in Europe."
War Not a Surpirse.
"Like all other great events this
war is the outcome of a condition of
things that have their roots far back
in history," he said, and showed how
the world conflicts "came as a terrible
shock but not as a surprise," to all
the nations involved, who clearly saw
that it was inevitable. Professor
Meyer showed himself a far-seeing
student of world politics by reading
an entry in his diary, written In 1909.
In it he considered it inevitable that
a war must come. He considered at
: that time that it would come in one
| or two years, judging from the prep
arations which he considered England
I had been making since the policy of
King Edward "to isolate and sur
round Germany with a ring of iron.'*
Because of this the war is popularly
known in Germany as King Edward's
War, he said. He supported his idea
that a series of wars may arise out
of the present struggle because of
the fact that while the fate of many
small nations is now being decided
there are still many questions affect
ing every country in the world which
will have to be settled.
Yellow Vs. White.
One of the most significant things
that Professor Meyer emphasized
last night was the possibility of the
present century seeing a conflict be
tween the yellow and white races for
the domination of the Pacific. Japan,
he said, would, at the end of the pres
ent war, be the only nation to come
out unscathed. Under the leadership
of the Japanese the entire east would
unite. Professor Meyer considers a
