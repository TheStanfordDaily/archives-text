# THE 						GRADE POINT SYSTEM
## 
### 
Modifications and changes have today been made in the Honor, or Grade
Point System, which materially lessen its objectionable features, and miti
gates the injustice which we believe it would have worked had the first plan
been retained. We are glad to observe the liberal attitude assumed by the
Academic Council, and the willingness to alter a system which they realize
was not without its faults.
Outside of entirely exempting all students who registered before the
plan was adopted from the effect of its provisions, the changes made today
are as fair as could be asked. Those with good records in the past may
take advantage of their high marks to tide them over the latter period dur
ing which, perhaps, they have not fared so well, while those who wish to
forget the past may still do so. Some such arrangement was essential in
order to avoid a gross injustice, particularly to the seniors. Individual
students will not be put to the trouble of figuring out which alternative to
accept, since the registrar will do the experimenting.
Removal of minus points, and readjustment of the number given for
"A" and "B" will no doubt prove as satisfactory. The Grade Point System
Is not void of redeeming features, and when an equitable distribution of
points is secured, it will help to maintain a high standard of scholarship
without injustice. Whether the plan as changed should be final can not
be ascertained before trial. If it does not prove satisfactory, we hope and
believe that the Academic Council will maintain the broad attitude thus far
assumed—that it will not hesitate to alter obviously impractical provisions.
