# Visitors Can See Weird Sights on Postoffice Wall
## 
### 
A large flaring question mark
greets the visitor to the Stanford
postoffice these days. Pasted to the
interrogation point are two postal
cards, whose fronts resemble a to
pographical map of an irregular,
rocky country; what purports to
be the addresses might mean any
thing from "two and two makes
four" to "How are you, today?"
To call these inscriptions hiero
glyphics would be libeling -a hiero
glyph; they resemble a profile view
of the Sierra Nevada mountains or
might even be interpreted to rep
resent the latest style in women's
wearing apparel. In addition 'to
the indecipherable addresses, the
fronts of the cards are decorated
profusely in the same handwriting.
Undoubtedly the writer had good
intentions, but his execution and
technique lack greatly.
The presence and appearance of
these two cards have evidently af
fected the minds and eyes of Post
master Meekins and his assistants,
for in another place in the same
postoffice, on a list which contains
the names of persons whom the pos
tal authorities have been unable to
locate, appears the name of M. R.
Kirkwood. Should he inquire from
any law student, Postmaster Meek
ins would be told that Professor
Marion Rice Kirkwood, alias M. R.
Kirkwood, receives visitors and
scholars daily in the Law depart
ment.
Verily, the system and procedure
of the United States postoffice, as
evidenced by the Stanford Univer
sity station, are truly wonderful and
puzzling beyond all understanding.
