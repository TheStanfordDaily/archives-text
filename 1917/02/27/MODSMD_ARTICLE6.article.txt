## 
### 
Coach Dick Morgan sprung a sur
prise when he announced this morn
ing that "Wes" Wilson, '13, the writer
of the famous song, "Lotus Land,"
was the co-writer of T. J. Reynolds,
'18, of the musical numbers of "A
Pirate for a Day."
Wilson, who wrote two Junior
Operas, is the author of "That Salva
tion Army Rag" and"And I Got To
He Neutral for I Want to Love Them
All." One of the best numbers in the
1918 show will be his "Sapphires
Seas," a song with a marvelous mel
ody.
"I'll Build a Home at Port Limon"
is one of Reynolds' hits for this
year's production. Reynolds was the
writer of the 1917 opera music.
