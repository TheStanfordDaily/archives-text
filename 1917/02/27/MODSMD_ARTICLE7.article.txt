# Flood Waters Lowered in Search for Drowned Boy
## 
### 
Lagunita is being filled as rapidly
as possible as a result of action by
Farm Superintendent Hewston in an
attempt to lower the flood waters of
the San Francisquita Creek, caused
by recent rains, so as to help in the
recovery of the body of Harold Mog
ensen, 12-year-old son of Nels P.
Mogensen of Palo Alto, who was
drowned in the creek Sunday after
noon, having fallen in while at play.
A $200 reward has been offered by
the father of the boy for the recovery
of the body, and a number of search
parties are at work, but the body had
not been recovered from the creek up
to a late hour this afternoon.
