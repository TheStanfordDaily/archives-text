# Last Week of Work For "Justice" Cast
## Coach Mathieu Announces That Players Will Rehearse All Day Saturday 
### 
Father Time is tightening up his
belt and preparing to challenge the
east of "Justice." The English Club
and Masquers players, with the real
ization that March 9 is a bare ten
days distant, and that the day of the
sfat sale but a week away, have en
tered into the hardest week of them
all â€”that prior to the dress rehear
sals. Coach Mathieu is not wasting
a moment of time. He has announced
a rehearsal for practically every day
this week. On Saturday, the cast
will be in the Assembly Hall the en
tire day. A full performance will be
given to empty seats Saturday.
Two photographers have taken aim
at the "Justice" players, with the re
sult of a rare collection of character
portraits for Quad display. Many of
the players have been before the cam
era on three separate occasions.
Announcements of "Justice," due on
the evening prior to the big Found
ers' Day celebration, have been mailed
to alumni residing within a radius of
one hundred miles. A number of re
plies have already been received from
Peninsula people, indicating that
"Justice" will attract not only a cam
pus and Palo Alto audience, but play
goers from San Francisco, San Jose
and other centers.
