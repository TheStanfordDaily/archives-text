Five boats will be on the water at
Redwood after a few days. Only four
shells are practicing at present, but
the coach is anxious to give every man
a chance, so he is making provision
to take all the candidates to Redwood
in this way. There will be two var
sity and two freshmen boats, with tlie
other eight made up of both varsity
and freshmen candidates.
In order to get the boats and launch
in shape and keep them in use all the
time, Graduate Manager Behrens has
made arrangements with a boat
builder from San Francisco to be at
Redwood three days a week and work
on the boats. The launch is still in
bad shape, and some of the shells are
not in the best of condition, but the
present plan assures them all being
in the best of order.
Workouts are tightening up every
day, with short spurts, and the men
are beginning to show up well. Four
boats were on the water at Redwood
today for a hard practice.
