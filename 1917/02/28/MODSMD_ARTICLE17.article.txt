# RAYMOND ROBINS
## 
### 
Raymond Robins, who has made a singular impression among, univer
sity communities throughout the United States, arrives at Stanford tomor
row, and will make his first appearance before a campus audience at the
11 o'clock assembly hour. Opportunities to hear such a man are rare.
They don't knock 011 the door every day, and we can not overestimate the
value of getting the novel viewpoint which a leader of such stamp will
have to present.
Robins has been one of the foremost adherents to the National Pro
gressive Party since its birth; he is also a labor leader and social worker
of note. He has lived every minute of his life, and we expect that the mes
sage which he brings to Stanford will, in its realism, reflect this fact.
When such a man is talking, we can afford to drop some of our routine
labor for a time. We should be no more loath to remove our eyeshades
while Mr. Robins is with us, than we would be to forget the multiplica
tion table on our first trip to Europe. May we also suggest that the faculty
will be interested, and that they will have little free time to hear Mr.
Robins if their desks are strewn with examination blanks crying to be cor
rected ?
