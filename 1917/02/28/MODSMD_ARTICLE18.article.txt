# FAIR PLAY

Tomorrow will see the sophomores and freshmen mix it in the annual
baseball rush, and ostensibly in the first game of the interclass baseball
series. In the past, it has never been intended to allow the frosh to win
this contest, 011 the theory, no doubt, that a fat-head is worse than none at
all. We do not believe that the freshmen are any more liable to acquire
such an impediment than the sophomores, and think it about as obnoxious
in one case as it is in the other. The practice of stopping the game while
the second year men are ahead regardless of the inning being played, spoils
the series. What is the use of having a game at. all when it is doped out
beforehand? We might just as well eliminate the freshmen from competi
tion. As far as the rush is concerned, it would be just as satisfactory
without the preliminary farcical contest. Why not let the best team win?
