Stunts prepared by different houses
and clubs were given at the oft-post
poned Women's Conference party,
which at last occured yesterday in the
Women's Club House, at 6:30. The
cleverest of these was the silhouette ,
enactment of a negro folk-song, sung I
by Miss Esther Liversidge, '17, and
dramatized by Miss Elizabeth Judah, |
'17, the pickaninny, and Miss Gerald-'
ine Dewey, '18, the mammy.
