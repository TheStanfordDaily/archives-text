# U. S. Influenced by Dutch Institutions
## Dr. L. Van Noppen Shows Debt Americans Owe to Holland 
### 
Speaking in the Little Theater last
night, on the subject of the "Influence
of Holland on America," Professor C.
Leonard Van Noppen, Queen Wilhel
mina lecturer in Columbia University,
pointed out the remarkable number
of ways in which the civilization of
Holland was the direct forerunner of
much of the civilization of England
and America.
The effect of Holland's influence in
England was to introduce the manu
facture of steel, the weaving process,
new mothods of agriculture and stock
raising, and even such everyday ne
cessities as bath tubs, soap, and table
linens, Professor Van Noppen told his
audience. In the United States,
"whose government, political and edu
cational institutions were copied from
those of Holland," as the speaker said,
the influence of Holland, although a
little less obvious, was just as great.
The germ of the constitution of the
United States was shown to have come
from a Holland declaration which re
pudiated the authority of Philip of
Spain. Many of the phrases used by
the founders ol' the United States may
be traced back to a Dutch origin.
Dr. Van Noppen also showed the
influence of Holland law on the law
of this country. "The common law,"
he declared, "has in the main been
superseded by the Justinian code,
which for years has been the basis of
Holland law."
Professor Van Noppen lectured
again this afternoon in the Little The
ater, at 4:15, on "Vondel and Milton,"
in which she showed the influence of
the Dutch writers on the works of
Milton. Tomorrow at the same time
and place he will deliver his last lec
ture to Stanford audiences on the
topic of "Van Eeden, the Dutch Tol
stoi, and the Poets of Today."
