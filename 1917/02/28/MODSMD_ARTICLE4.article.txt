# Chappie's Private Muse Discovered on Library Shelf
## 
### 
Mere mortals who wander around
the Stanford campus in a brain-daze
have often wondered where the Chap
arral staff hides its fount of humor;
where in the world the brilliant gen
iuses who inhabit the pages of "Chap
pie" get their wonderful inspirations.
At last the secret's out, and the par
ticular Muse who smiles benignly up
on "Chappie" has been bearded in her
den.
The particular den happens to be in
the library; the Muse cowers in the
pages of a book entitled "Facts and
Fancies for the Curious," compiled by
C. C. Bombaugh, A. M. M. D. The
book was published in 1905, twelve
years ago. Its call number is 803-
8695, and the brain-dizzy, mere mor
tals may at their pleasure now inter
view the Muse without going through
the formality of purchasing a copy of
"Chappie."
In the last issue of "Chappie" there
appeared a humorous item dealing
with the troubles of an artist who
one day decorated the walls of a
church. It was very funny; the mere
mortals, it is hoped, derived many
laughs from it and marvelled at the
genius of "Chappie." But, O, what a
fall was that, my countrymen
The self-same article appeared on
page 221 of "Facts and Fancies for
the Curious." There are a few
changes; "Chappie's" artist charged
a bit more for cleaning one of the
prophet's ears, or washing Moses'
face; but that can be attributed to the
High Cost of Living.
The joke, if there be one to this
story, written by a mere mortal who
has never aspired to appear in "Chap
pie's" pages, is that even in the book
which was published twelve years ago,
the author apologizes for the antiquity
of the item. It is also rumored that
"Chappie's" editor knew of the age of
the item when he ran it.
