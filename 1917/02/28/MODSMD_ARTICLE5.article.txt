# Advance Dope Favors Bigger Founders' Day
## 
### 
Founders' Day is March 10, one
week from Saturday.
Founders' Day plans are progress
ing with the regular movement of
clock-work, and advance "dope"
promises a bigger than ever celebra
tion in honor of Senator and Mrs.
Stanford, on the anniversary of their
creation of Stanford.
Early orders for plates at the
Founders' Day Dinner in the evening,
at the Women's Club House, promises
a greater than ever crowd. The com
mittee in charge of the dinner is
planning for a capacity house in
which meals will be served at tables
both downstairs and upstairs.
The Ernest Wilson Company has
been engaged to prepare the dinner
under the direction of the dinner com
mittee. The Wilson force is preparing
to serve an all-star menu with the
usual snap and service. Last year
the Founders' Day Dinner waS attend
ed by three hundred Stanford stu
dents, alumni and faculty people.
Tickets for the dinner are in the
hands of E. R. Ames for the Hall, F.
J. Leard for the Row, Wideman's cam
pus store and the registrar's office for
general sale, and Miss Anita Marcus
for women students. Last year the
dinner committee was handicapped by
the late sale of many plates, and ef
forts will be bent to secure a capacity
house early in the week this year.
Plates at the dinner are $1.00.
Speakers are accepting their places
on the other parts of the Founders'
Day program, and plans for the rest
of the day's festivities are rapidly
becoming fixed. Following the dinner
in the evening, speeches will be in
order, with other features for enter
tainment.
Founders' Day Dinner has been in
the past the greatest congenial re
union of alumni, faculty and students
of the entire college year. It is the
grand mixer of the University, and
presents unusual opportunity for stu
dents to rub shoulders in friendly
fashion with faculty men. According
to one student who attended his first
Founders' Day Dinner last year, "It
gives a student a chance to see how
congenial and friendly the professors
and alumni really are."
