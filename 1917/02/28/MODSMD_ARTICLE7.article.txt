# UNDERCLASS RUSH TO BE STAGED TOMORROW
## SCRMABLE FOR BALL First Baseball Game of Interclass Series Slated for University Lot 
### 
INTERCLASS baseball will begin to
morrow aternoon, when the sopho
mores and freshmen meet on the
varsity diamond at 4:15. The second
game of the series will be staged be
tween the seniors and juniors on Fri
lay, at the same time and place. The
winners of both contests will play the
numeral game on Monday afternoon.
UnderclasM Rush.
The annual freshmen-sophomore
spring rush will take place after the
game tomorrow. Varsity Baseball
Captain "Doc" Hayes will throw a
marked baseball up, and the two un
derclasses will scramble for it. As
has been the case for the past few
years, the class returning the ball to
Hayes before 6 o'clock the next morn
ing, will be judged winner of the rush.
This is generally considered to be of
more importance than the winning of
the baseball game.
Last year, the game was stopped in
the early innings by Captain Dent, the
second year players being on the long
end of the score. The "babes" car
ried off the honors in the rush, how
ever, returning the baseball to the
skipper after a long night's vigil. The
sophomores and freshmen both have
strong teams this year. Five of the
wearers of the red hat are on the
Stanford varsity. Both teams will
elect captains today, and will choose
lineups for the game tomorrow.
There will be no admission to the
contest and rush, and it is expected
that the bleachers will be filled.
