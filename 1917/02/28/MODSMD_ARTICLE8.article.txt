# Irish Marathon Is Slated on Saturday
## Wright Lynn Journeying From Hollister to Aid Seniors Capture Event 
### 
With the annual Irish Marathon only
three days away, class committees are
busily engaged in picking tentative
teams for the competition Saturday
afternoon at 2 o'clock, on the varsity
track.
Among those who have tried out for
the 1917 team, which has won the
event for the past three years, are
Track Captain H. V. Aupperle, Scott,
J. W. Templeton, I-lalsted, West,
Flood, P. It. Wilson, Norton, Schnell,
Wright, Frye, Diovendorff, Single,
Mackel and Wilson. Wright Lynn,
varsity quarter-miler of last year's
track team, will make a special trip
from Hollister in order to compete in
the meet. With this array of talent,
in addition to former members of the
team who have not yet tried out, it
seems unlikely that any other class
can keep the seniors from making it
four straight victories.
Captain Milton F. Samis of the 1920
track squad, has furnished the follow
ing list of names from which the
freshmen team will be picked: Col
gjazier, Crawford, Considine, Davis,
Dewing, Dinkelspiel, Hall, Heath,
Howes, Miner, Albouze, Hudner, Han
son, Maynard, Nagel, Sheldon, Slo
man, Samis, Terman, W. 15. Weils, H.
