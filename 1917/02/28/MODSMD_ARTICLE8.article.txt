# Irish Marathon Is Slated on Saturday
## Wright Lynn Journeying From Hollister to Aid Seniors Capture Event 
### 
With the annual Irish Marathon only
three days away, class committees are
busily engaged in picking tentative
teams for the competition Saturday
afternoon at 2 o'clock, on the varsity
track.
Among those who have tried out for
the 1917 team, which has won the
event for the past three years, are
Track Captain H. V. Aupperle, Scott,
J. W. Templeton, I-lalsted, West,
Flood, P. It. Wilson, Norton, Schnell,
Wright, Frye, Diovendorff, Single,
Mackel and Wilson. Wright Lynn,
varsity quarter-miler of last year's
track team, will make a special trip
from Hollister in order to compete in
the meet. With this array of talent,
in addition to former members of the
team who have not yet tried out, it
seems unlikely that any other class
can keep the seniors from making it
four straight victories.
Captain Milton F. Samis of the 1920
track squad, has furnished the follow
ing list of names from which the
freshmen team will be picked: Col
gjazier, Crawford, Considine, Davis,
Dewing, Dinkelspiel, Hall, Heath,
Howes, Miner, Albouze, Hudner, Han
son, Maynard, Nagel, Sheldon, Slo
man, Samis, Terman, W. 15. Weils, H.
B. Wells, Wilke, Hartman and Park.
The sophomore and junior teams
have not been picked thus far. Ad
ditional tryouts for all classes were
held this afternoon and will also be
held tomorrow afternoon on the oval.
All men who have not as yet tried out
have been requested to report on the
track at any time.
Among' those who will take part in
the annual "Holdover Stunt" which
will take place during the meet, are
Pete Young, Wright, Hettinger, Wil
son, L. C. Stevens, Partridge, Hender
son, Noonan, Aten, Maltby, Tal Smith,
and others. All holdovers are re
quested to report to the committee
which has charge of the event.
