# PHOENIX NINE HANDS DEFEAT TO CARDINAL
## DRAPER HURLS WELL Stanford Loses to St. Mary's by 3 to 0 Count in Poor Exhibition 
### 
IN A RAGGED exhibition of the
National pastime, St. Mary's de
feated the Stanford varsity yester
day afternoon on the Cardinal dia
mond by a 3 to 0 score. This was the
second game of the series, and makes
the count one all in contests played.
The rubber will be played off on the
St. Mary's lot in Oakland next Sat
urday.
A large crowd turned out, consider
ing the fact that it was a midweek
contest, and that there was a counter
attraction on the faculty ball field,
where the sophomores were carting
away the freshmen baseball team.
Little excitement was furnished the
fans, however, the game being a dis
appointment after the thrilling 1 to 0
first battle between the two nines,
played here two weeks ago.
Draper Pitches Well.
Draper hurled an excellent game for
the Cardinal, the three runs scored
against him all being unearned and
coming in on bad errors by the Stan
ford infielders. It seems that the
locals cannot support the speedy
twirler. Braden and Cowan both
missed easy chances and threw the
ball away when boots counted for
tallies.
