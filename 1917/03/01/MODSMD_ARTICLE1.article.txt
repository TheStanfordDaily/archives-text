# PHOENIX NINE HANDS DEFEAT TO CARDINAL
## DRAPER HURLS WELL Stanford Loses to St. Mary's by 3 to 0 Count in Poor Exhibition 
### 
IN A RAGGED exhibition of the
National pastime, St. Mary's de
feated the Stanford varsity yester
day afternoon on the Cardinal dia
mond by a 3 to 0 score. This was the
second game of the series, and makes
the count one all in contests played.
The rubber will be played off on the
St. Mary's lot in Oakland next Sat
urday.
A large crowd turned out, consider
ing the fact that it was a midweek
contest, and that there was a counter
attraction on the faculty ball field,
where the sophomores were carting
away the freshmen baseball team.
Little excitement was furnished the
fans, however, the game being a dis
appointment after the thrilling 1 to 0
first battle between the two nines,
played here two weeks ago.
Draper Pitches Well.
Draper hurled an excellent game for
the Cardinal, the three runs scored
against him all being unearned and
coming in on bad errors by the Stan
ford infielders. It seems that the
locals cannot support the speedy
twirler. Braden and Cowan both
missed easy chances and threw the
ball away when boots counted for
tallies.
St. Mary's marked up two runs in
the first frame on a walk, three stolen
bases and two errors. They brought
atHbss their other tally in the fourth
inning, on a single, a stolen base and
two errors. Stanford came close to
scoring in the fourth .fifth, and sev
enth spasms. Mitchell featured the
game with a running catch in right
field, and batted out a single.. The
remainder of the local hits were garn
ered by Stevens, Reagon and Camp
bell. Lilly and Cowan hit the ball on
the nose, but were playing in bad
luck, their drives being swallowed up
by the Phoenix fielders.

IN A RAGGED exhibition of the
National pastime, St. Mary's de
feated the Stanford varsity yester
day afternoon on the Cardinal dia
mond by a 3 to 0 score. This was the
second game of the series, and makes
the count one all in contests played.
The rubber will be played off on the
St. Mary's lot in Oakland next Sat
urday.
A large crowd turned out, consider
ing the fact that it was a midweek
contest, and that there was a counter
attraction on the faculty ball field,
where the sophomores were carting
away the freshmen baseball team.
Little excitement was furnished the
fans, however, the game being a dis
appointment after the thrilling 1 to 0
first battle between the two nines,
played here two weeks ago.
Draper Pitches Well.
Draper hurled an excellent game for
the Cardinal, the three runs scored
against him all being unearned and
coming in on bad errors by the Stan
ford infielders. It seems that the
locals cannot support the speedy
twirler. Braden and Cowan both
missed easy chances and threw the
ball away when boots counted for
tallies.
St. Mary's marked up two runs in
the first frame on a walk, three stolen
bases and two errors. They brought
atHbss their other tally in the fourth
inning, on a single, a stolen base and
two errors. Stanford came close to
scoring in the fourth .fifth, and sev
enth spasms. Mitchell featured the
game with a running catch in right
field, and batted out a single.. The
remainder of the local hits were garn
ered by Stevens, Reagon and Camp
bell. Lilly and Cowan hit the ball on
the nose, but were playing in bad
luck, their drives being swallowed up
by the Phoenix fielders.

IN A RAGGED exhibition of the
National pastime, St. Mary's de
feated the Stanford varsity yester
day afternoon on the Cardinal dia
mond by a 3 to 0 score. This was the
second game of the series, and makes
the count one all in contests played.
The rubber will be played off on the
St. Mary's lot in Oakland next Sat
urday.
A large crowd turned out, consider
ing the fact that it was a midweek
contest, and that there was a counter
attraction on the faculty ball field,
where the sophomores were carting
away the freshmen baseball team.
Little excitement was furnished the
fans, however, the game being a dis
appointment after the thrilling 1 to 0
first battle between the two nines,
played here two weeks ago.
Draper Pitches Well.
Draper hurled an excellent game for
the Cardinal, the three runs scored
against him all being unearned and
coming in on bad errors by the Stan
ford infielders. It seems that the
locals cannot support the speedy
twirler. Braden and Cowan both
missed easy chances and threw the
ball away when boots counted for
tallies.
St. Mary's marked up two runs in
the first frame on a walk, three stolen
bases and two errors. They brought
atHbss their other tally in the fourth
inning, on a single, a stolen base and
two errors. Stanford came close to
scoring in the fourth .fifth, and sev
enth spasms. Mitchell featured the
game with a running catch in right
field, and batted out a single.. The
remainder of the local hits were garn
ered by Stevens, Reagon and Camp
bell. Lilly and Cowan hit the ball on
the nose, but were playing in bad
luck, their drives being swallowed up
by the Phoenix fielders.
