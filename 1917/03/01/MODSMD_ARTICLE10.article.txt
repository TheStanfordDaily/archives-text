# Grant Nine Varsity "S" Sweaters
## 
### 
Executive Committee at their reg
ular meeting last night changed the
rule for awarding block letters for
basketball from requiring a man to
compete in two of the California
games to awarding the letter for com
peting in one of the California games.
Following this action the committee
voted nine sweaters to the Cardinal
basketers of this year. Men awarded
the block "S" were Captain W. R.

'19. A German "S" sweater was
awarded to R. F. Lytle, '17, being the
only substitute.
Eight freshmen basket tossers were
also awarded their numerals for com
peting in the California games. They
were B. Joerg, E. Moulton, W. K.
Ilood, R. L. Carver, J. P. Toole, A. L.
