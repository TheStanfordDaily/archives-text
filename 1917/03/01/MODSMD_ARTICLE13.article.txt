44T 1 ' want justice, you must
I enforce it," President Wilbur
told a meeting of five hundred
men at the Union smoker last night,
with reference to the present German
crisis. President Wilbur advocated
actual participation on the part of the
United States with the Allies to
thwart Germany's aims.
President Wilbur believes that this
is America's opportunity to use her
forces on behalf of a world organiza
tion for democracy. Three things
have pleased him in a patriotic way,
he stated in his preliminary remarks,
Hoover's work in Belgium, military
training on the campus, and the spirit
of the boys in the American Am
bulance Corps in France.
"There never has been a real moral
issue where many people could not be
led off into by-paths by shibboleths
and catchwords, or attacks on the
character of past acts. University
men should be leaders; leaders must
think; think back in terms of history
"We have too long been inert to the
great struggle before us, our man-
hood has been sapped by listening
leadership, by waiting in anxious ex
pectation for the inevitable to happen
without the saving support and stimu
lation of hard work in preparation for
it. As a nation we must come to our
feet to meet the hour when the world's
problem of right and law and liberty,
to play the part of men, to safeguard
the future."
Professor E. B. Krehbiel spoke on
the "Armed Neutrality" situation,
citing the only two cases in history
when the situation had arisen, and
had not worked out satisfactorily.
Professor Krehbiel endorsed President
Wilbur's views on the present situa
tion, so long as they did not abolish
democracy.
Entertainment was furnished for the
Union meeting by "Doug" McLachlan,
"Dutch" Henry, "Dick" Coleman, and
the Stanford Glee Club. The meeting
was one of the most successful held
on the campus.
