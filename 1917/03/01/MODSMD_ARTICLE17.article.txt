# FOUNDERS' DAY
## 
### 
No better excuse for celebration could be found at Stanford than
that for the festivities to be staged a week from next Saturday. In
addition to the usual commemoration of Founders' Day, the twenty
fifth anniversary of Stanford will be celebrated on March 10. The
University is a quarter century old. Faculty and alumni are planning
great things for this day, in order that its double significance may not
be slighted. In order to secure the presence of as many alumni as
possible, festivities were postponed twenty-four hours, and it is ex
pected that the change will be well rewarded. However, the day will
not be a success in every sense of the word unless the triangle is com
plete—unless the students take interest enough to do their share. We
have no doubt but that this interest exists.
Founders' Day Dinner, which, with its program and dance ends
the festivities, will, from all indications, be one of the largest ever at
tempted. Alumni and faculty are planning to go in great numbers.
We believe that the students should be represented at this function
above all others of the day, it giving unparalleled opportunity for
present Stanford to get acvuainted with Stanford of the past. Each
living group should have a good representation. The number, however,
is limited and students are urged to let the committee know as soon as
possible whether or not they can attend.
Let us all co-operate in making this Founders' Day bigger and
better than ever before!
