# COMING THROUGH

### 
Several weeks ago, while the Stanford Union was campaigning
for new members, one of the chief arguments against joining it was
that it had nothing to offer to most menâ€”that it was a dead institu
tion. Right now we wish to say that the Union has made large strides
toward overcoming this deficiency since that time. Last evening's
smoker was probably the best of its kind ever given at Stanford. Such
affairs, together with the Sunday evening dinners, the occasional ad
dresses and the dances, show that the Union is more and more taking
the place meant for it on the campus. We wish to compliment the
manager and his committees on the good work they are doing.
