# Notice-Epicures Feast Your Eyes, Then Your Mouths
## 
### 
Lick your chops, say "Yum,
Yum," and let your mouth water—
you who like good eats. Blessed
are they that like good "eats," for
they shall have a Founders' Day
Dinner.
Look at, look at, look at —and get
a ticket to the dinner. The Ernest
Wilson Company has been named
to satisfy the palates, and here's
how they're going to do it. Here's
the contents of the box dinner:
Fried chicken, tender and juicy
as quail, and enough of it, too —
sandwiches, three kinds of them,
variety in taste über alles —crisp,
snappy potato chips, stuffed eggs,
with mayonnaise to flavor them —
pickles, olives and incidentals to fill
the corners of the box, and the deli
cate spots in your inner man or in
side woman. That's the beginning.
And the dessert —Oh my, O my,
O my—layer cake as light and
plump and thick and delicious —
Gee, which will I begin on, that or
the nougat sundae. And last, but
equally interesting, a cup of Mocha
—and then a general mixer. After
the mixer, music and the dance.
Let 'er go. Joy, Founders' Day
comes but once per year.
Got your ticket? Better get it —
some one has them in your group—
you'll not miss the dollar one-mill
ioneth as much as you'd miss this
feed, and get-together, and good
fellowship. So there!
