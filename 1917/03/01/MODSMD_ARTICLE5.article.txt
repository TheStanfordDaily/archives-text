# Indoor Track Meet Slated for March 8
## 
### 
The indoor track meet is scheduled
for March 8, under the auspices of
the Stanford Gym Club, which is
planning to put on an exhibition that
night. A paper has been posted in
the gymnasium for entries to sign, or
men desiring to enter can give their
names to N. W. Rakestraw, '16, presi
dent of the Gym Club; or E. R. Knol
lin, gr., gymnasium coach.
Knollin is planning to work with
any of the entries who desire coach
ing in their events, and although
comparatively few men have turned
out for gym work this year, he ex
pects quite a number of entries in
each event.
The Gym Club have been rather
slow to get started but are going to
have an exhibition performance ready
to be given a week from Friday.
