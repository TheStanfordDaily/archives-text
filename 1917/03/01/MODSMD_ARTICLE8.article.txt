# WORLD CHANGE INEVITABLE
## THIRTEEN HUNDRED THRILLED BY ROBINS "The Next Thirty Years Will Bring the Greatest Crisis in History," Says Publicist 
### 
OVER thirteen hundred students,
together with members of the
faculty, packed the Assembly
Hall to hear Raymond Robins, Pro
gressive leader and social reformer,
hurl out his "Challenge of the Chang
ing Social Order," this morning.
Robins' personality was the most
impressive feature of the assembly.

lie grasped the attention and sym
pathy of his audience from the start
and kept it. With humor, eloquence
and force, but most of all with reality,
he attacked present industrial and
social conditions, and pointed out the
part the young men and women of to
day must play in the great period of
change at hand.

"The next thirty years will be the
most demanding of a thousand years
in human history," said Ilohins, point
ing out three great changes, social,
economic and political, that bring up
vital problems to be solved in the
coming generation.
"The domestic economy of America
is in transformation. A new collec
tive social order is just being born.
You will have to work out some pretty
difficult problems. We have become
a great nation, bound together with
ribs of steel and nerves of copper
wire. We are great in extent and
diversity of opinions and needs, but
we are bound together in one unified
whole by race, by post, by telegraph,
by railroads. The time has come
when we must get away from the
older provincial concept of our pol
icies."
Flays Social Evils.
Robins flayed the social and eco
nomic evils that have made the tene
ments possible. He painted a vividly
realistic picture of the modern family
struggling against poverty, the child
ren having no place to play in except
the streets, and there, gaining the
morals of the street. These condi
tions cause the wrecks of life, he said,
and made necessary, jails, asylums,
hospitals and reformatories.
"Each of you has to be interested
in these things: you cannot escape It.
"Politics have changed. We need a
national mind to master the situation
today. At this hour politics means
more to every man and woman in my
hearing than anything else. If you
are not interested in politics, get in
terested, for politics is interested in
you. We are touched by public laws
from the cradle to the grave, and poli
tics means more than ever before in
the history of the world."
Tells of Ills Life.
Robins told of his life, his fight with
the wolf at the door in his early days,
his experiences in the Yukon, and
drew real and forceful conclusions
from these incidents.
"The things on the inside of a per
son are bigger than the things on the
outside. This old world rests back
on the common garden variety of folks.
. . . They are the masters of the
future by right divine. . . . It's
the last mile that counts, not the first.
It's the person that can stay through
the stretch of life, not the star that
makes a great start, who is worth
while.
"You get out of life just about what
you put into it. What you get out of
your time spent in the University
doesn't lie in the school or the faculty
or the equipment. You have to get in
and dig for the gold of education in
books just as we had to dig for gold
in the passes of the Klondike to get
it. You can't live on the lower levels
of purpose and find the heights of
human adventure and the ranges of
the human soul."
Robins eulogized Lincoln in a splen
did tribute, drawing many examples
from him.
"There are two great ideals in ffae,"
he said. "There is the ideal of sel
fishness, that of Caesar; and there is
the ideal of service, that of Christ.
Men and women of Stanford, your
homes, your University, your nation,
the world, all need you. What will

be your answer "
Robins addressed a faculty luncheon

Tomorrow evening he will be guest
of honor at a student banquet in the
Inn at 5:45. His next public address

"You get out of life just about what
you put into it. What you get out of
your time spent in the University
doesn't lie in the school or the faculty
or the equipment. You have to get in
and dig for the gold of education in
books just as we had to dig for gold

pathy of his audience from the start
and kept it. With humor, eloquence
and force, but most of all with reality,
he attacked present industrial and
social conditions, and pointed out the
part the young men and women of to
day must play in the great period of
change at hand.

"The next thirty years will be the
most demanding of a thousand years
in human history," said Ilohins, point
ing out three great changes, social,
economic and political, that bring up
vital problems to be solved in the
coming generation.
"The domestic economy of America
is in transformation. A new collec
tive social order is just being born.
You will have to work out some pretty
difficult problems. We have become
a great nation, bound together with
ribs of steel and nerves of copper
wire. We are great in extent and
diversity of opinions and needs, but
we are bound together in one unified
whole by race, by post, by telegraph,
by railroads. The time has come
when we must get away from the
older provincial concept of our pol
icies."

Robins flayed the social and eco
nomic evils that have made the tene

realistic picture of the modern family
struggling against poverty, the child

the streets, and there, gaining the
morals of the street. These condi
tions cause the wrecks of life, he said,

hospitals and reformatories.
"Each of you has to be interested
in these things: you cannot escape It.
"Politics have changed. We need a
national mind to master the situation

more to every man and woman in my

are not interested in politics, get in

you. We are touched by public laws
