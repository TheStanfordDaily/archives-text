where to carry an election."
"Tilings on the inside of a person
are bigger than on the outside."
"This old world rests back on the
common garden variety of folks."
"You get out of this old world
what you put into it."
"Get interested in politics, for
politics is interested in you."
"It's the last mile that counts;
not the first."
"It's the body that's sound, and
the brain that's on the square, that
wins."
