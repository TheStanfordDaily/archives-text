# COMPETITION TO BE CLOSE IN MARATHON
## 1920 APPEARS SPEEDY Seniors Will Make Unbeaten Record of Four Straight by Win Saturday 
### 
STANFORD'S annual six-mile inter
class Irish Marathon race will be
tested tomorrow afternoon on
the varsity track, starting at 3 o'clock,
under the auspices of the Quadrangle
Clnb.
Although the class of 1917, which
has won the event for the past three
years, ever since its first year in the
University, is counted upon as an
almost certainty to make it four
straight, the senior runners should be
hard pressed by the freshmen squad,
which includes some men who are
exceptionally good at the quarter
mile.
Hold-overs" Stunt Clever.
Besides the six-mile race, the hold
overs will stage their annual stunt,
burlesquing and travestying customs
and events that have happened on the
campus this year. Predictions have
been made to the effect that this
stunt Saturday will be the best ouc
that has been staged on the campus in
years.
Names of Runners.
The names of the runners who will
compete for the 1917 and 1920 classes
have already been made public. The
nucleus of the sophomore team is
composed of Winham, House, Pann,
Hobbs, Long, Price, Floete, Foster,
Gentry, McNally, Boulware, Glikbarg,
Hamlyn, Madden, Kellogg, Willis, C.
V. Smith, B. Rogers, F. Rogers, Need
ham, Knight, Sweeny, Jansen, Thayer,
Kocker, Wark and Philips.
The 1919 squad will be handicapped
by the absence of C. S. Teitswowrth,
who placed in the intercollegiate
cross-country run between Stanford
and California, last semester. Teits
worth is ill in Lane Hospital, San
Francisco, and as he is the chairman
of the sophomore committee, as well
as one of its strongest runners, his
absence will be felt greatly.
The junior team will be picked from
the following, who are to report at
the track at 2 p.m, If unable to run
notify R. Oaughey. The 1918 men
are McClosky, Art Wilson, Chapman,
Say, Rogers, Williams, McPherson,
Dykes, Johns, Cottrell. Aten, Coman,
Davis, Walker, Templeton, Nicklason,
Hertel, Hauser, Linn, Scliwarzenbek,
Hall, Smalley, Williamson, Berry,
Sherman, Levy, Thalheimer, Wohl
ford.
All freshmen who have tried out are
requested to report to M. F. Samis
on the track at 2 o'clock.
As 3 o'clock, the time for the start
of the meet, does not conflict with any
of the other events scheduled for to
morrow afternoon and as it is ex
pected to be over in a little less more
than half an hour, a large crowd will
undoubtedly witness the Marathon.
