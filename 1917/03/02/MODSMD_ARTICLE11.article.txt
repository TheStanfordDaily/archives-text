# Ruse Traps 1920 and Wins Rush For Sophomores
## 
### 
Sophomores won the annual inter
class baseball rush by returning the
marked ball to Captain "Doc" Hayes
about 10:30 last night.
As in previous years, three or four
balls were tossed up during the
scramble, yesterday, and relay teams
of both classes sprinted off the field
with them. The freshmen were suc
cessful in relaying the marked ball
off the field, but after carrying it
through several men, due to a case of
mistaken identity, the ball was passed
to a sophomore, and the second-year
men speedily relayed the sphere to a
waiting motorcyclist, who sped to San
Mateo with it, returning later.
As in the past, the sophomores
carried off the ball game of the day, S
to 2. Heavy hitting by the wearers
of the red hat featured, Boydston
gathering two triples and a single,
while Captain Reagon garnered a
double and a homer.
The game was allowed to go along
for three innings, but by that time
sophomores were seen to be easy vic
tors, and following the clamor of the
crowd, the marked ball was tossed
up. Captain Hayes acted as referee
of both contests.
