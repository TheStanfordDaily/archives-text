# "Justice" Cast Ready With Week to Spare
## 
### 
"Justice" is one week away.
Seats will be put on sale Tuesday
at Weingartner's drug store, Palo
Alto, and at the Stanford book
store, on the campus. The draw
ing for places in line will take
place at 12:50 o'clock.

An unprecedented feat for Stanford
dramatics will be undertaken tomor
row when Coach Mathieu will put his
".Justice" players through a full
scenic rehearsal in the Assembly Hall.
Mathieu is the latest convert to the
ranks of preparedness advocates, and
believes in being ready l'or the enemy
net only at the right time, but a
week in advance. In this instance,
the enemy is a critical audience.
"Justice" is ready for the stage a week
before it is due.
The English Club and Masquers
players are not only ready for the
curtain, but are enthusiastically con
fident. Every member of the cast lias
put his best into his role, and from
the lead down to the minor characters
who can boast one line as their
"part," is prepared to give an audi
ence genuine acting.
