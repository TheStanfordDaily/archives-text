# EVERYBODY IN THE UNIVERSITY IN THE QUAD IS 18 SLOGAN
## 
### 
That the 1918 Quad will be the most
representative year-book ever publish
ed at Stanford is indicated by the fact
that half a hundred more juniors will
have their pictures in the class sec
tion than in any previous Quad. Pour
hundred eighteeners, or 98 per cent
of the class, have paid their dues and
had their pictures taken.
Every woman in the junior class
will have her picture in the '18 book,
for tiie first, time in.the history of
Stanford, according to Manager F.
W. Weeks, '18, who succeeded in col
lecting the five dollar Quad assess
ment from every woman in'the class.
Not only will the 1918 Quad have
more junior photographs than any of
its predecessors, but it will contain
more pictures, snapshots included, of
seniors, sophomores and freshmen,
llian any previous vear-book.
