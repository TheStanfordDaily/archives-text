# RED CROSS
## 
### 
In these days of uncertainty, when the next sun may see the
United States actively embroiled in the greatest struggle of nations
the world has ever suffered, it is but natural that we should ask what
Stanford will do to help in the event of war. There are several
fields in which the University may lend its aid, and not the least of
these is the Red Cross. Stanford is already intimately connected with
Red Cross work through the Stanford University Naval Base Hos
pital in San Francisco, which is to a large extent, depending on peo
ple of this University for its support. We need not wait for war to
be declared to aid in this good work, which is a matter of prepared
ness.
Dr. Emmet Rixford, of the Stanford faculty, in explaining the
need for such an institution, has said, "The demand .which may be
made upon either of the two base hospitals on the coast in the event
of an emergency will be extremely urgent. The navy is the first line
of defense of this country, and must be on a war footing on the very
outbreak of hostilities. The equipment and supplies for the care of
the wounded in the event of a fight must be prepared beforehand
and stored ready for immediate use." It is this work which has
been given to Stanford to foster under the auspices of the Red Cross.
The hospital will be turned over to the government in case of war.
An attempt to raise funds is being made on the campus under the
direction of Professor Bailey Willis. Whatever the outcome of pres
ent conditions, the time and money put into this project will be well
spent.
It is worth our careful consideration and support, particuarlv at
this time.
