One day the Supreme Being took
it into his head to give a great ban
quet in his palace of azure.
All Stanford students were invited,
mere men as well as mere women.
They all come, the dainty society
girls, tlie highbrows and roughnecks.
The last were jollier than the high
brows, though evidently less at ease
in evening dress; but they all ap
peared in good humor and chatted
amiably together, as was only be
coming among fellow students.
The Civic Virtues were there.
Presently the Supreme Being noticed
a very handsome, fine looking youth,
who appeared to be an utter stranger
to the assembled company. Taking
him by the hand he led him forward.
"Stanford students," said he ad
dressing the company.
"Public Spirit," said he, pointing to
tho stranger.
The students gazed amazed. Some
of them had heard of him as a tradi
tion. They did not know that he
lived.
