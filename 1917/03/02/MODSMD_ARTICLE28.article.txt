# Wind Tunnel Tests Airship Propellors
## 
### 
A huge wind tunnel has been con
structed in the new aeronautic ex
perimental laboratory for the testing
of different styles of aeroplane pro
pellors, and fifty different types of
propeUors are now under construc
tion in the wood working shop.
Professor W. P. Durand, of the
Mechanical Engineering department,
who is head of the National Advisory
Hoard for aeronautics, and in charge
of the experimental work at Stanford,
has also designed and built an in
genious machine called a thrust dy
namometer for the measuring of the
power a propellor will exert.
The tunnel is shaped large at both
ends, and at the middle is a little
room into which the propellors will
be placed to be tested. At one end
of the tunnel is a large propellor
which will draw the air through the
tunnel at a rate up to sixty miles an
hour. The propellors to be tested
are put into the little room and start
ed in opposition to the sixty-mile gale,
and by means of the thrust dynamo
meter the power of the propellor is
measured.
The object of the experimenting is
not only to find the most efficacious
design of propellor, hut to determine
the constants or coefficients, and laws
that govern the power of a propellor
applies, so that propellors for differ
ent uses can be hereafter designed
successfully without elaborate experi
menting.
