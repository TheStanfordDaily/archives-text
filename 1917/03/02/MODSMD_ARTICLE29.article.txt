# Greek Letter Men Form Informal Conference
## 
### 
Representatives of men's fratern
ities on the campus last night voted
to form an informal lnterfraternity
conference for discussion of all mat
ters of interest to the Greek letter
organizations. This body will have
no actual power and will have no
written constitution.
At the meetings of the different
chapter last week a constitution for
an interfraternity conference was
proposed. Many organizations be
lieved such a conference is unneces
sary and voted to stay out of it should
it be formed. As a result of their ob
jections the conference was organ
ized on a purely informal basis.
