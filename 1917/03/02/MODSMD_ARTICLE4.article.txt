# Listen! Ye Runners, if Ye Want to Hear the Story of Two Speeding Gamboleers

### 
Look out, Ye Milers, both great
and small, here's a couple new
cracks that will clean ye all.
One's named "Doc" and the other's
"The Squire," and they've got all
the speed of a Chink under fire.
The argument started in a near
by town, when the "Squire" told
Ihe "Doc" he was too old a clown
to travel on the track a mile's
worth around. "I'll betcha five
hicks 1 can clean up you," and the
race was on between the two.
The Student Adviser was right on
the job, watching these old fogies
in their youthful hobnob. "Make
it three,"says he,"and we'll have
a pot." But the "Squire" and the
"Doc" says, "We'd rather not."
The race was slated for 12:30
a.m. —cameras clicked as the run
ning began. The "Squire" hung on
for three fast laps, but his shoe
came off, and he signalled for taps.
"Doc" kept sprinting on his soli
tary spree, and crossed the line at
15:33. The race isn't over, so the
runners say, for they're going to
sprint again on next Thursday.
