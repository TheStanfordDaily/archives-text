# 'JUSTICE' SEAT SALE TUESDAY
## HEAVY DEMAND FOR TICKETS IS EXPECTED 
### 
A MODEST prediction is that the
Beat sale for "Justice," which
opens tomorrow at 12:50 o'clock,
will be a heavy one, with the demand
for tickets in proportion to the mag
nitude of the drama. Pasteboards
may be purchased following the cus
tomary drawing, either at the campus
bookstore or at Weingartner's drug
store, University avenue, Palo Alto.
Prices range from 50 cents to $1.00.
It is forecasted that the demand
for tickets tomorrow and throughout
the week will be both intensive and
extensive. This estimate is based on
the knowledge that "Justice" is at the
same time the first play of 1917, and
the most daring and ambitious under
taking of Stanford dramatists. Be

cause this greatest of Galsworthy's
modern social dramas is every bit
drama, has not a trace of the "high
brow" and nothing in common with
the everyday play, its appeal is uni
versal.
The English Club and Masquers of
fering, coming on the eve of the big
Founders' Day celebration, is attract
ing alumni as no other Stanford play
has. Palo Alto folk, who know Gals
worthy, and those who know of him,
have exhibited thorough interest in
Friday's production.
Curiosity will perhaps attract many
to "Justice" because English Club
has dared to produce what other ama
teurs feared to undertake.
