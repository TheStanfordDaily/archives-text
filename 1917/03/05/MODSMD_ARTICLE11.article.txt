The Holdover show scheduled for
the day, as Announcer Ostrander put
it, "failed to show."
Seniors captured Saturday's Irish
Marathon, making the fourth consecu
tive victory for the seventeenere in
this annual event, while the juniors
were second, freshmen third, and
sophomores last.
Track Coach "Ric" Templeton lined
the men up and started them at 3:20,
with Davis starting for the babes,
House for the sophomores, McClung
for the Juniors, and Kegley for the
Seniors. Jud House captured the lead
at the outset and finished a few feet
in front of Kegley. The sophomores
maintained this lead for the first
eight laps, when the seventeeners, as
was expected, finally captured it.
Last Lap Thrills.
The last lap of the race, between
Freddy Rogers, running for the sopho
mores, and Sloman for the freshmen,
was the thriller of the day. Sloman
got off to a slight lead, with Rogers
right at his heels, and pressing him
closely the entire lap, but never being

able to pass him. These two nego
tiated the fastest lap of the day,
Rogers' time being :50 flat, while
Sloman is credited with :50 1-5.
Rogers wins the gold medal for the
fastest non-varsity lap, while Sloman
receives the silver one.

made the third best non-varsity rec
ord, reeling off his lap also in:52 3-5.
The seniors' average time for the
six-mile relay was:54 2-5.
