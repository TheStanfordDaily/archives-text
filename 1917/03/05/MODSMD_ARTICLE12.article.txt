## 
### 
An hitherto unpublished account of
the great city of Meroe, capital of the
ancient Ethiopian empire in central
Africa, was given by Dr. A. H. Sayce,
Friday night, to a group of faculty
members who met at the home of Pro
fessor H. R. Fairclough to hear the
distinguished visitor.
Professor Sayce, who was until re
cently professor of Assyriology in the
University of Oxford, England, has
an international reputation among
scholars as an explorer and archae
ologist, and is famous as an Oriental
ist.

I Before a faculty audience, as the
I guests of Professor Fairclough, Dr.
Sayce recounted a recent trip which
' he made into the interior of Africa,
to the south of the Soudan. Here he
discovered the site and ruins of
Meroe, the capital of the one time
important Ethiopian empire. Allus
ions to this city have been frequently
made by classical historians, but its
existence was never definitely known
and sometimes regarded as a myth.
The results of Dr. Sayce's exploration,
which have as yet not been published,
undoubtedly form a valuable acqui
sition to archaeological investigation.
