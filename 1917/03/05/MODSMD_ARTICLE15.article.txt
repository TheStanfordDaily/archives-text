# RAYMOND ROBINS OPENS BROAD OUTLOOK
## LAST TALK TONIGHT Progressive Leader Makes Deep Impression on Stanford Community 
### 
Raymond robins has gripped
Stanford. The series of ad
dresses the noted Progressive
leader and social reformer has made
on the campus this week-end has
made a deep and lasting impression
on the student body of the Univer
sity.
Friday, Saturday and Sunday eve-

Raymond ?° bin s delivers his
final address at eve_
ning in the Assembly Hall, at an
All-University mass meeting of
both men and women, beginning at
7:30 instead of 7:15, out of cour
tesy to regular Monday night fra
ternity and sorority meetings.

nings he spoke to the men of Stanford
on the topics, "The College Man and
Community Leadership," "Funda
mentals of the Industrial Conflict,"
and"Mastery and Power," respective
ly. The broad vision and keen in
sight of the speaker was evident as
much in his answers to questions
asked at the close of the addresses as
in the speeches themselves.
Makes Many Addresses.
In addition to the evening meet
ings, Robins spoke to a number of
smaller groups. Saturday morning
he talked to Engineering students in
the Little Theater. Sunday morning
he spoke to the Promotion force in
the vestry of the Memorial Church,
and in the afternoon addressed the
women of the University. This af
ternoon at 2:15 he gave a special talk
to the students of the Law department
in the Little Theater.
Speaking on the topic, "The Col
lege Man and Community Leader
ship," Friday evening, Robins graph
ically described his fight for social
and political independence in the
boss-ridden Seventeenth Ward of Chi
cago, and showed the opportunities
and requirements of leadership for
the college man of the present gen
eration.
"To oust a crooked boss, you must
prove that you wouldn't be more
crooked in his place.
' "Putting a man In a penitentiary
does not help things much, r never
expect to get all the crooks in the
penitentiary; it would make too much
difference with the general popula
tion. If you try to jail the crooks,
you usually get the little crooks, not
the big ones; and w"hen you do get
the crook in jail, another has been
putin his place, and you've just
swapped crooks. . . .
"Actions Louder Than Words."
"Actions not only speak louder
than words, but they also speak in
more languages. When I get so good
I can't go where the people are and
meet them as they are and keep my
flag flying, I'll quit the game.
"Getting licked isn't so serious if
you just start out to win the next
fight. I've got licked many times but]
I've kept on fighting. , . .
"The real centers of power are often
a long way from the big noise and
shouting. . . .
"Bosses are never wholly bad.
There are two kinds of bosses. There
is the boss in the office who shoves
out money, cold as steel and mean as
hell; and there's the boss who
mingles with his fellows, never wholly
bad, a good fellow gone bad, and he
holds his powers more because of his
good points than because of his bad
ones You've got to care
for folks on the square or the other
stuff to get votes doesn't get by. . .
"Men of Stanford, don't you go into
the game of community leadership
unless you go your limit. If you start
ready to go the limit, you bear the
stamp of victory. A crook doesn't
like to fight anyone who will go the
limit.
"The three keys of constructive
community leadership that signify
success are investigation, publicity
and co-operation."
Industrial Conflict Looms.
"Fundamentals of the Industrial
Conflict" was Robins' topic Saturday
evening. He was introduced by
Chancellor Emeritus David Starr Jor
dan.
Asserting that "the economic and
industrial conflict is the most impor
tant single-time problem of the
world," Robins pointed out the five
significant reasons underlying the
economic problems of the day, as fol
lows, in brief:
"First, for the first time in the his
tory of the world production is for
profit, not use. Second, corporate
form of control of capital is now the
rule. Third, women today are the
underbidders in the world labor mar
ket; they will work for less than
men. Fourth, there is no longer a
western frontier to relieve economic
pressure. Fifth, the democratic idea.
"The supreme reason for this
change in conditions is the emergence
in this world of the democratic idea.
The power of the Galilean is the
power back of this democratic idea.
"You're in the midst of a time when
there are two moralities at work in
the industrial field. There is the old
individualstic morality, paternalistic
and responsible; and there is the new
and irresponsible morality.
"Behind the trade labor union
movement, tyrannical and monopolis
tic as it is," he said, "there is the
germ of a great democratic fact."
Strongest Appeal Sunday.
' 1
Robins made his strongest appeal
to Stanford men in his Sunday night
address on "Mastery and Power." For
an hour and fifty minutes he held his
hearers as he dealt with the real es
sentials of life. His address, in part,
was as follows:
"This group of men will divide in
thirty years substantially on funda
mental questions into two groups:
those who have won; and those who
have failed. Some whom the world
will regard as having won will have
lost; and some whom the world will
think have failed will have won.
"Nobody can hitch you up to great
ness but yourself. Life is a bitter
struggle either way, up or down. No
man starts out beaten.
' The joy of excess is less than the
joy of mastery. Creative power lies
in restraint, and dies in excess.
"Men of Stanford, the supreme need
of life is moral courage, and the
supreme curse of life is moral cow
ardice. Every single vice rests on
moral cowardice. I wouldn't give a
snap of my finger for the man who
could be frightened into righteous
ness. I'd be afraid he would get over
being afraid. 1 want men to go into
righteousness because of the construc
tive power it will have on their own
manhood.
"The excuse for moral weakness,
'A man has to live,' isn't true. It's an
infernal lie. We don't have to live.
There are men along four flaming
lines of steel in Europe today who
believe it is better to die than be
cowards in a nation's need. You'll
find a good many dead men in the
world who are as dead as they ever
will be, but aren't buried owing to a
mere social custom. The day a man
sells his moral manhood, he's dead.
The tragedy of life is to have the
semblance of power and not the lib
erty of power."

"First, for the first time in the his
tory of the world production is for
profit, not use. Second, corporate
form of control of capital is now the
rule. Third, women today are the
underbidders in the world labor mar
ket; they will work for less than

"The supreme reason for this

The power of the Galilean is the

Strongest Appeal Sunday.
' 1
Robins made his strongest appeal
to Stanford men in his Sunday night
address on "Mastery and Power." For
an hour and fifty minutes he held his
hearers as he dealt with the real es
sentials of life. His address, in part,
was as follows:
"This group of men will divide in
thirty years substantially on funda
mental questions into two groups:
those who have won; and those who
have failed. Some whom the world
will regard as having won will have
lost; and some whom the world will
think have failed will have won.
"Nobody can hitch you up to great
ness but yourself. Life is a bitter
struggle either way, up or down. No
man starts out beaten.
' The joy of excess is less than the
joy of mastery. Creative power lies
in restraint, and dies in excess.
"Men of Stanford, the supreme need
of life is moral courage, and the
supreme curse of life is moral cow
ardice. Every single vice rests on
moral cowardice. I wouldn't give a
snap of my finger for the man who
could be frightened into righteous
ness. I'd be afraid he would get over
being afraid. 1 want men to go into
righteousness because of the construc
tive power it will have on their own
manhood.
"The excuse for moral weakness,
'A man has to live,' isn't true. It's an
infernal lie. We don't have to live.
There are men along four flaming
lines of steel in Europe today who
believe it is better to die than be
cowards in a nation's need. You'll
find a good many dead men in the
world who are as dead as they ever
will be, but aren't buried owing to a
mere social custom. The day a man
sells his moral manhood, he's dead.
The tragedy of life is to have the
semblance of power and not the lib
erty of power."
Raymond robins has gripped
Stanford. The series of ad
dresses the noted Progressive
leader and social reformer has made
on the campus this week-end has
made a deep and lasting impression
on the student body of the Univer
sity.
Friday, Saturday and Sunday eve-

Raymond ?° bin s delivers his
final address at eve_
ning in the Assembly Hall, at an
All-University mass meeting of
both men and women, beginning at
7:30 instead of 7:15, out of cour
tesy to regular Monday night fra
ternity and sorority meetings.

nings he spoke to the men of Stanford
on the topics, "The College Man and
Community Leadership," "Funda
mentals of the Industrial Conflict,"
and"Mastery and Power," respective
ly. The broad vision and keen in
sight of the speaker was evident as
much in his answers to questions
asked at the close of the addresses as
in the speeches themselves.
Makes Many Addresses.
In addition to the evening meet
ings, Robins spoke to a number of
smaller groups. Saturday morning
he talked to Engineering students in
the Little Theater. Sunday morning
he spoke to the Promotion force in
the vestry of the Memorial Church,
and in the afternoon addressed the
women of the University. This af
ternoon at 2:15 he gave a special talk
to the students of the Law department
in the Little Theater.
Speaking on the topic, "The Col
lege Man and Community Leader
ship," Friday evening, Robins graph
ically described his fight for social
and political independence in the
boss-ridden Seventeenth Ward of Chi
cago, and showed the opportunities
and requirements of leadership for
the college man of the present gen
eration.
"To oust a crooked boss, you must
prove that you wouldn't be more
crooked in his place.
' "Putting a man In a penitentiary
does not help things much, r never
expect to get all the crooks in the
penitentiary; it would make too much
difference with the general popula
tion. If you try to jail the crooks,
you usually get the little crooks, not
the big ones; and w"hen you do get
the crook in jail, another has been
putin his place, and you've just
swapped crooks. . . .
"Actions Louder Than Words."
"Actions not only speak louder
than words, but they also speak in
more languages. When I get so good
I can't go where the people are and
meet them as they are and keep my
flag flying, I'll quit the game.
"Getting licked isn't so serious if
you just start out to win the next
fight. I've got licked many times but]
I've kept on fighting. , . .
"The real centers of power are often
a long way from the big noise and
shouting. . . .
"Bosses are never wholly bad.
There are two kinds of bosses. There
is the boss in the office who shoves
out money, cold as steel and mean as
hell; and there's the boss who
mingles with his fellows, never wholly
bad, a good fellow gone bad, and he
holds his powers more because of his
good points than because of his bad
ones You've got to care
for folks on the square or the other
stuff to get votes doesn't get by. . .
"Men of Stanford, don't you go into
the game of community leadership
unless you go your limit. If you start
ready to go the limit, you bear the
stamp of victory. A crook doesn't
like to fight anyone who will go the
limit.
"The three keys of constructive
community leadership that signify
success are investigation, publicity
and co-operation."
Industrial Conflict Looms.
"Fundamentals of the Industrial
Conflict" was Robins' topic Saturday
evening. He was introduced by
Chancellor Emeritus David Starr Jor
dan.
Asserting that "the economic and
industrial conflict is the most impor
tant single-time problem of the
world," Robins pointed out the five
significant reasons underlying the
economic problems of the day, as fol
lows, in brief:
"First, for the first time in the his
tory of the world production is for
profit, not use. Second, corporate
form of control of capital is now the

ternoon at 2:15 he gave a special talk
to the students of the Law department
in the Little Theater.
Speaking on the topic, "The Col
lege Man and Community Leader
ship," Friday evening, Robins graph
ically described his fight for social
and political independence in the
boss-ridden Seventeenth Ward of Chi
cago, and showed the opportunities
and requirements of leadership for
the college man of the present gen
eration.
"To oust a crooked boss, you must
prove that you wouldn't be more
crooked in his place.
' "Putting a man In a penitentiary
does not help things much, r never
expect to get all the crooks in the
penitentiary; it would make too much
difference with the general popula
tion. If you try to jail the crooks,
you usually get the little crooks, not
the big ones; and w"hen you do get
the crook in jail, another has been
putin his place, and you've just
swapped crooks. . . .
"Actions Louder Than Words."
"Actions not only speak louder
than words, but they also speak in
more languages. When I get so good
I can't go where the people are and
meet them as they are and keep my
flag flying, I'll quit the game.
"Getting licked isn't so serious if
you just start out to win the next
fight. I've got licked many times but]
I've kept on fighting. , . .
"The real centers of power are often
a long way from the big noise and
shouting. . . .
"Bosses are never wholly bad.
There are two kinds of bosses. There
is the boss in the office who shoves
out money, cold as steel and mean as
hell; and there's the boss who
mingles with his fellows, never wholly
bad, a good fellow gone bad, and he
holds his powers more because of his
good points than because of his bad
ones You've got to care
for folks on the square or the other
stuff to get votes doesn't get by. . .
"Men of Stanford, don't you go into
the game of community leadership
unless you go your limit. If you start
ready to go the limit, you bear the
stamp of victory. A crook doesn't
like to fight anyone who will go the
limit.
"The three keys of constructive
community leadership that signify
success are investigation, publicity
and co-operation."
Industrial Conflict Looms.
"Fundamentals of the Industrial
Conflict" was Robins' topic Saturday
evening. He was introduced by
Chancellor Emeritus David Starr Jor
dan.
Asserting that "the economic and
industrial conflict is the most impor
tant single-time problem of the
world," Robins pointed out the five
significant reasons underlying the
economic problems of the day, as fol
lows, in brief:
"First, for the first time in the his
tory of the world production is for
profit, not use. Second, corporate
form of control of capital is now the
rule. Third, women today are the
underbidders in the world labor mar
ket; they will work for less than
men. Fourth, there is no longer a
western frontier to relieve economic
pressure. Fifth, the democratic idea.
"The supreme reason for this
change in conditions is the emergence
in this world of the democratic idea.
The power of the Galilean is the
power back of this democratic idea.
"You're in the midst of a time when
there are two moralities at work in
the industrial field. There is the old
individualstic morality, paternalistic
and responsible; and there is the new
and irresponsible morality.
"Behind the trade labor union
movement, tyrannical and monopolis
tic as it is," he said, "there is the
germ of a great democratic fact."
Strongest Appeal Sunday.
' 1
Robins made his strongest appeal
to Stanford men in his Sunday night
address on "Mastery and Power." For
an hour and fifty minutes he held his
hearers as he dealt with the real es
sentials of life. His address, in part,
was as follows:
"This group of men will divide in
thirty years substantially on funda
mental questions into two groups:
those who have won; and those who
have failed. Some whom the world
will regard as having won will have
lost; and some whom the world will
think have failed will have won.
"Nobody can hitch you up to great
ness but yourself. Life is a bitter
struggle either way, up or down. No
man starts out beaten.
' The joy of excess is less than the
joy of mastery. Creative power lies
in restraint, and dies in excess.
"Men of Stanford, the supreme need
of life is moral courage, and the
supreme curse of life is moral cow
ardice. Every single vice rests on
moral cowardice. I wouldn't give a
snap of my finger for the man who
could be frightened into righteous
ness. I'd be afraid he would get over
being afraid. 1 want men to go into
righteousness because of the construc
tive power it will have on their own
manhood.
"The excuse for moral weakness,
'A man has to live,' isn't true. It's an
infernal lie. We don't have to live.
There are men along four flaming
lines of steel in Europe today who
believe it is better to die than be
cowards in a nation's need. You'll
find a good many dead men in the
world who are as dead as they ever
will be, but aren't buried owing to a
mere social custom. The day a man
sells his moral manhood, he's dead.
The tragedy of life is to have the
semblance of power and not the lib
erty of power."
Raymond robins has gripped
Stanford. The series of ad
dresses the noted Progressive
leader and social reformer has made
on the campus this week-end has
made a deep and lasting impression
on the student body of the Univer
sity.

Raymond robins has gripped
Stanford. The series of ad
dresses the noted Progressive
leader and social reformer has made
on the campus this week-end has
made a deep and lasting impression
on the student body of the Univer
sity.
Friday, Saturday and Sunday eve-

Raymond ?° bin s delivers his
final address at eve_
ning in the Assembly Hall, at an
All-University mass meeting of
both men and women, beginning at
7:30 instead of 7:15, out of cour
tesy to regular Monday night fra
ternity and sorority meetings.

nings he spoke to the men of Stanford
on the topics, "The College Man and
Community Leadership," "Funda
mentals of the Industrial Conflict,"
and"Mastery and Power," respective
ly. The broad vision and keen in
sight of the speaker was evident as
much in his answers to questions
asked at the close of the addresses as
in the speeches themselves.
Makes Many Addresses.
In addition to the evening meet
ings, Robins spoke to a number of
smaller groups. Saturday morning
he talked to Engineering students in
the Little Theater. Sunday morning
he spoke to the Promotion force in
the vestry of the Memorial Church,
and in the afternoon addressed the
women of the University. This af
ternoon at 2:15 he gave a special talk
to the students of the Law department
in the Little Theater.
Speaking on the topic, "The Col
lege Man and Community Leader
ship," Friday evening, Robins graph
ically described his fight for social
and political independence in the
boss-ridden Seventeenth Ward of Chi
cago, and showed the opportunities
and requirements of leadership for
the college man of the present gen
eration.
"To oust a crooked boss, you must
prove that you wouldn't be more
crooked in his place.
' "Putting a man In a penitentiary
does not help things much, r never
expect to get all the crooks in the
penitentiary; it would make too much
difference with the general popula
tion. If you try to jail the crooks,
you usually get the little crooks, not
the big ones; and w"hen you do get
the crook in jail, another has been
putin his place, and you've just
swapped crooks. . . .
"Actions Louder Than Words."
"Actions not only speak louder
than words, but they also speak in
more languages. When I get so good
I can't go where the people are and
meet them as they are and keep my
flag flying, I'll quit the game.
"Getting licked isn't so serious if
you just start out to win the next
fight. I've got licked many times but]
I've kept on fighting. , . .
"The real centers of power are often
a long way from the big noise and
shouting. . . .
"Bosses are never wholly bad.
There are two kinds of bosses. There
is the boss in the office who shoves
out money, cold as steel and mean as
hell; and there's the boss who
mingles with his fellows, never wholly
bad, a good fellow gone bad, and he
holds his powers more because of his
good points than because of his bad
ones You've got to care
for folks on the square or the other
stuff to get votes doesn't get by. . .
"Men of Stanford, don't you go into
the game of community leadership
unless you go your limit. If you start
ready to go the limit, you bear the
stamp of victory. A crook doesn't
like to fight anyone who will go the
limit.
"The three keys of constructive
community leadership that signify
success are investigation, publicity
and co-operation."
Industrial Conflict Looms.
"Fundamentals of the Industrial
Conflict" was Robins' topic Saturday
evening. He was introduced by
Chancellor Emeritus David Starr Jor
dan.
Asserting that "the economic and
industrial conflict is the most impor
tant single-time problem of the
world," Robins pointed out the five
significant reasons underlying the
economic problems of the day, as fol
lows, in brief:
"First, for the first time in the his
tory of the world production is for
profit, not use. Second, corporate
form of control of capital is now the
rule. Third, women today are the
underbidders in the world labor mar
ket; they will work for less than
men. Fourth, there is no longer a
western frontier to relieve economic
pressure. Fifth, the democratic idea.
"The supreme reason for this
change in conditions is the emergence
in this world of the democratic idea.
The power of the Galilean is the
power back of this democratic idea.
"You're in the midst of a time when
there are two moralities at work in
the industrial field. There is the old
individualstic morality, paternalistic
and responsible; and there is the new
and irresponsible morality.
"Behind the trade labor union
movement, tyrannical and monopolis
tic as it is," he said, "there is the
germ of a great democratic fact."
Strongest Appeal Sunday.
' 1
Robins made his strongest appeal
to Stanford men in his Sunday night
address on "Mastery and Power." For
an hour and fifty minutes he held his
hearers as he dealt with the real es
sentials of life. His address, in part,
was as follows:
"This group of men will divide in
thirty years substantially on funda
mental questions into two groups:
those who have won; and those who
have failed. Some whom the world
will regard as having won will have
lost; and some whom the world will
think have failed will have won.
"Nobody can hitch you up to great
ness but yourself. Life is a bitter
struggle either way, up or down. No
man starts out beaten.
' The joy of excess is less than the
joy of mastery. Creative power lies
in restraint, and dies in excess.
"Men of Stanford, the supreme need
of life is moral courage, and the
supreme curse of life is moral cow
ardice. Every single vice rests on
moral cowardice. I wouldn't give a
snap of my finger for the man who
could be frightened into righteous
ness. I'd be afraid he would get over
being afraid. 1 want men to go into
righteousness because of the construc
tive power it will have on their own
manhood.
"The excuse for moral weakness,
'A man has to live,' isn't true. It's an
infernal lie. We don't have to live.
There are men along four flaming
lines of steel in Europe today who
believe it is better to die than be

find a good many dead men in the

will be, but aren't buried owing to a
