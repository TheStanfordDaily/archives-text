# AN ALLOYED BLESSING
## 
### 
Showers of blessing, it is said, seldom fall unalloyed with things
less blessed. Whether it is a law of nature, or merely a series of ac
cidents which led to this observation, we find that its truth can not be
denied in regard to the showers which we have in our Encina Gymnas
ium. That these showers are a blessing is undisputed; but the mud
1 j t % ' # , I
which comes with them during the rainy season must be classed with
the alloy. Not only is the shower water full of mud, but the swim
ming pool, filled by the same water, is also affected.
True it is, that this condition exists only during the rainy season,
but that season usually extends over most of the second semester.
Even if it were but a short time, however, it seems unnecessary to be
handicapped in this manner. We waited a good many years here at
Stanford for adecjUate gymnasium facilities, putting up with all man
ner of inconveniences and making the best of them. Now that we
have a first class building, modern in every respect, it is impractic
able to lessen its efficiency by such small economies as using Sears
ville water when a civilized supply is obtainable. It is neither pleas
ant nor sanitary to bathe in muddy water such as we are getting now
at the gymnasium.
By tapping the main at Encina Hall, we understand that clean
water may be secured. This would entail some expenditure, surely,
but the sacrifice would be small compared to the benefit to be en
joyed. If we,are going to have showers and a "swimming pool at all,
let's have them right. The Trustees, we feel sure, would see that
this change is made, once they realize the condition of things. In
order that they may realize, we ask them to investigate and see for
themselves. It is to them we must look for improvement.
