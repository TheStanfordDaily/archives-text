# Mud at Redwood Forces Crew to Practice on Lake
## 
### 
Due to bad conditions on the estuary
at Redwood, crew candidates will
practice at Lagunita the first three
days of the week. The mud is so
bad that the boats will not float, mak
ing it impossible to work out.
Coach "Husky" Guerena gave the
freshmen their first "slugging match"
Saturday. Two candidates were put
in the pair-oared shells and their
pulling ability tested. This is the
first time that a definite lineup has
been made of each man's strength.
