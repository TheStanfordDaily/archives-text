# Stanford Freshmen Win Soccer Contest
## Varsity and Indoor Teams Both Lose in Slowly Played Games 
### 
Cardinal soccer teams won one game
and dropped two in San Francisco,
'this week-end. The freshmen out
door team won the lone victory from
the Olympic Juniors, by the score of
1-0.
The varsity played a listless game
against the Olympic Seniors, and en
countered stronger opposition than
expected, the final score being 1-0
against them. Coach H. W. Maloney
stated that it seemed to be one of the
team's off days and they did not play
true to form.
The 1920 men showed up well in
their game with the Olympic Juniors,
and won by the score of 1-0. Their
teamwork was far superior to that or
the varsity, and they played a hard,
fast contest.
Indoor soccer men lost an excep
tionally hard game to the Barbs, at
Oakland, on Friday night, before a
crowd of 1500 people. The final score
was 2-1 against the Cardinal men, but
they fought hard every minute of play.
On March 17, the varsity soccer
men will journey to Saratoga to play
a star aggregation representing the
California Football Association, at the
annual blossom festival. The man
agement of the festival will pay the
expenses of the trip.
