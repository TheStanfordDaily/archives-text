# "A Story in Conquest" Is Dr. Jordan's Newest Book
## 
### 
"Alsace Lorraine, or a study in con
quest," is the name of the latest book
written by Chancellor Jordan. The
book has just come off the press, and
L)r. Jordan has placed a volume in
the library. The value of the book
lies in its being in a sense an his
torical document, a record of things
as they were before the great crash
came in Europe. It reveals that the
dread of war, its futility as well as
its terrors, formed a dominant note
in Alsace-Lorraine in 1913, and that
this province has been the core around
which the suicidal war preparedness
of Europe has crystallized.
