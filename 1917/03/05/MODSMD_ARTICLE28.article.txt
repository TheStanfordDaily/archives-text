# Women Regulate Moral Atmosphere Asserts Robins

"The moral, spiritual and social
temperament of the campus lies not
with the men of the University, nor
with the faculty. By divine and nat
ural right this temperament is in your
hands and in no others," said Ray
mond Robins in addressing the women
of the University in Memorial Church
yesterday afternoon. "If you give the
men a friendly, strong, fine fellow
ship, the value of this friendship will
follow them wherever they go after
graduation. Beware of cheap popular
ity which rests on cheap familiarity.
Most men despise those with whom
they trifle. The difference in the ef
fect of these two types of friendship
is the difference between the stars in
heaven and duck tracks in the mud."

Asserting that man-made barriers
between women and the great intel
lectual world are fast going down,
Robins prophesied that the next
thirty years will mark the greatest
woman age in the past 1000 years of
human history. By illustration, he
pointed out how much can be done for
the lowest classes of working women
by those who are willing to experi
ence their hardships in order to dis
cover the main causes and best rem
edies of deplorable conditions. He
cautioned his audience not to work
for spotlight praise, and not to forget
the oldest and most fundamentally im
portant tasks of common,
simple service of home and fireside,
wherein their influence can be made
most far-reaching and helpful. "The
ability to do the common things with
an uncommon spirit is the power that
saves the world," according to Rob
ins' belief.
"Dare to serve where struggle is.
You are living as much now as you
ever will and fidelity to the little
things will go with you to your re
motest hour. Success doesn't come in
a burst, but as a result of preparation
in unseen and unsuspected places.
The proudest of us all must make
surrender, sooner or later. The ques
tion with which we must concern our
selves is to what and whom do we
surrender. Is it worthy?
"There are two centers of life —
selfishness, what do I get out of this
for myself; and ideal service whose
path goes back through centuries to
Calvary. If I could leave you one
great gift I would leave you the power
to do that good you know, hold your
self to that high Power, onward and
upward to each level."

simple service of home and fireside,
wherein their influence can be made
most far-reaching and helpful. "The
ability to do the common things with
an uncommon spirit is the power that
saves the world," according to Rob
ins' belief.
"Dare to serve where struggle is.
You are living as much now as you
ever will and fidelity to the little
things will go with you to your re
motest hour. Success doesn't come in
a burst, but as a result of preparation
in unseen and unsuspected places.
The proudest of us all must make
surrender, sooner or later. The ques
tion with which we must concern our
selves is to what and whom do we
surrender. Is it worthy?
"There are two centers of life —
selfishness, what do I get out of this
for myself; and ideal service whose
path goes back through centuries to
Calvary. If I could leave you one
great gift I would leave you the power

self to that high Power, onward and
upward to each level."
"The moral, spiritual and social
temperament of the campus lies not
with the men of the University, nor
with the faculty. By divine and nat
ural right this temperament is in your
hands and in no others," said Ray
mond Robins in addressing the women
of the University in Memorial Church
yesterday afternoon. "If you give the
men a friendly, strong, fine fellow
ship, the value of this friendship will
follow them wherever they go after
graduation. Beware of cheap popular
ity which rests on cheap familiarity.
Most men despise those with whom
they trifle. The difference in the ef
fect of these two types of friendship
is the difference between the stars in
heaven and duck tracks in the mud."
Harriers Between Sexes Going.
Asserting that man-made barriers
between women and the great intel
lectual world are fast going down,
Robins prophesied that the next
thirty years will mark the greatest
woman age in the past 1000 years of
human history. By illustration, he
pointed out how much can be done for
the lowest classes of working women
by those who are willing to experi
ence their hardships in order to dis
cover the main causes and best rem
edies of deplorable conditions. He
cautioned his audience not to work
for spotlight praise, and not to forget
the oldest and most fundamentally im
portant tasks of common,
simple service of home and fireside,
wherein their influence can be made
most far-reaching and helpful. "The
ability to do the common things with
an uncommon spirit is the power that
saves the world," according to Rob
ins' belief.
