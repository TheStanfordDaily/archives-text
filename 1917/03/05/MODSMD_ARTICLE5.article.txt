# Mission Five Plays Cardinal on Tuesday
## 
### 
Santa Clara and the varsity will
play the last game of the basketball
season in Encina gymnasium tomor
row night. The contest counts for
the championship of the California- j
Nevada league.
The Mission Town team and the
Cardinal met early in the season, re
sulting in a win for Santa Clara by
a small margin. The game was one
of the fastest seen this season, and
since the two fives have not been in
a hard contest for some time, play to
morrow should be of a high order.
Davis Farm School went down to
defeat before the varsity at Davis, by
a score of 38 to 16. Although Coach
Wilson did not use his regular lineup,
the combination that took the floor
played rings around the farmers.
Wheatly made three field baskets
and counted one goal from foul out
of one trial, in addition to playing a
fine guarding game.
But one substitution was made by
Stanford, when Hood replaced Estes.
The freshman captain made one bas
ket while he was in and played a good
guarding game.
