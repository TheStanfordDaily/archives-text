## GAVE FAITH IS PLEA Alaska Experiences Graphically Pictured by Noted Orator In Closing Appeal 
### 
GRAPHICALLY describing experi
ences in Alaska, through which
he gained the inspiration of the
deeper things of life, Raymond Rob
ins made his last address at Stanford
and in the state of California, yester
day evening, in the Assembly Hall.
His topic was "Faith." He was in
troduced by President Wilbur.
Three Master Motives.
"I have had three master motives
in my life, and I've been loyal to each
one," said Robins. "I wanted money;
that was my first aim in life and I
followed it with some zeal. Then I
came to think making money was a
baby game, and I started to study law
and passed the examination to the
bar, by telling the judge who ques
tioned me that the first duty of a
lawyer was to get his fee. . . .
"Then I got another line. I got it
on the trail in the north. I got it
under the greatest strain in the world.
Some of the men on the trail had a
better temper and better grips than
others, and they laid it to Christian
ity."
