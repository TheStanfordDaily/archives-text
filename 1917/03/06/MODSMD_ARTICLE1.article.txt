# LARGE CROWD HEARS ROBINS' FINAL SPEECH
## GAVE FAITH IS PLEA Alaska Experiences Graphically Pictured by Noted Orator In Closing Appeal 
### 
GRAPHICALLY describing experi
ences in Alaska, through which
he gained the inspiration of the
deeper things of life, Raymond Rob
ins made his last address at Stanford
and in the state of California, yester
day evening, in the Assembly Hall.
His topic was "Faith." He was in
troduced by President Wilbur.
Three Master Motives.
"I have had three master motives
in my life, and I've been loyal to each
one," said Robins. "I wanted money;
that was my first aim in life and I
followed it with some zeal. Then I
came to think making money was a
baby game, and I started to study law
and passed the examination to the
bar, by telling the judge who ques
tioned me that the first duty of a
lawyer was to get his fee. . . .
"Then I got another line. I got it
on the trail in the north. I got it
under the greatest strain in the world.
Some of the men on the trail had a
better temper and better grips than
others, and they laid it to Christian
ity."
Robins told how he had been lost
in a storm in the Yukon country, and
came across a rude, snow-covered
cross in the wilderness. He got to
thinking over the realities of life and
gained the inspiration for Christian
service to which he attributes what
he has been able to do since that time.
Prayer, the Rible, and the fellow
ship of other Christians forms the
three principal foods for Christian
life. "Christianity is a social enter
prise or it's nothing. Isolated Christ
ianity I'm not sure of. The men and
women who believe in Christ, hold the
ridges of the world. ... I won't
live on the achievements of the past;
I'm helping to keep the fire burning
in my generation. Every one of us
has an influence and I'm not willing
to waste mine.
"I believe in going to church. If
the pastor can stand me, I can stand
him. Maybe there's some strain on
both. . . . Begin being a Christ
ian now or you'll never begin. . . .
Christianity being a living thing, is a
growing thing.
"God deliver us from the folly of
manifest destiny. God deliver us from
the belief that achievement, wealth or
family can take the place of the real
things. There were barrels and wag
onloads of manifest destiny around
Athens and Rome, but look where the
descendants of the ancient Athenians
and Romans are now: shining shoes
at five cents a shoe, or selling fruit
from a pushcart in the tenement dis
tricts.
"There's just as much manifest des
tiny in California as there are red
blooded young men and women with
clear minds and eyes to see the truth,
in the state.
"Men and women of the University,
students of Stanford, hail and fare
well! God be with you. May you
keep the faith!"
Raymond Robins went directly to
Sacramento today, following his de
parture from Stanford, and this eve
ning will address a banquet of the
members of both houses of the Cali
fornia legislature at the special invi
tation of Hiram Johnson.

that was my first aim in life and I
followed it with some zeal. Then I
came to think making money was a
baby game, and I started to study law
and passed the examination to the

lawyer was to get his fee. . . .
"Then I got another line. I got it
on the trail in the north. I got it
under the greatest strain in the world.
Some of the men on the trail had a
better temper and better grips than
others, and they laid it to Christian

Robins told how he had been lost
in a storm in the Yukon country, and
came across a rude, snow-covered
cross in the wilderness. He got to
thinking over the realities of life and
gained the inspiration for Christian

Prayer, the Rible, and the fellow
ship of other Christians forms the
three principal foods for Christian
life. "Christianity is a social enter
prise or it's nothing. Isolated Christ
ianity I'm not sure of. The men and
women who believe in Christ, hold the
ridges of the world. ... I won't
live on the achievements of the past;
I'm helping to keep the fire burning
in my generation. Every one of us
has an influence and I'm not willing
to waste mine.
"I believe in going to church. If
the pastor can stand me, I can stand
him. Maybe there's some strain on
both. . . . Begin being a Christ

Christianity being a living thing, is a
growing thing.
"God deliver us from the folly of
manifest destiny. God deliver us from
the belief that achievement, wealth or
family can take the place of the real

GRAPHICALLY describing experi

he gained the inspiration of the
deeper things of life, Raymond Rob

Three Master Motives.
"I have had three master motives
in my life, and I've been loyal to each
one," said Robins. "I wanted money;
