# S.C. Basketball Game Is Called Off by Behrens
## 
### 
Graduate Manager Behrens has
called off the Santa Clara basketball
game scheduled for tonight. This
game would not have settled the Cali
fornia-Nevada championship, so it
was decided to let it go. No more
basketball games will be held this
season.
