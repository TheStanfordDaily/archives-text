# FORT MILEY OPPONENTS ON DIAMOND
## STRONG AGGREGATION Lawson to Hurl Against Local Team, With Hayes Playing Same Lineup 
### 
FORT MI LEY will meet the Stan
lord varsity baseball squad for the
first time this season, tomorrow
afternoon, on the local diamond.
Graduate Manager L3ehrens had a con
test scheduled with the fast Agnews
team, but owing to the fact that the
professional baseball training season
is on, the opponents from the State
Hospital had to cancel the game. The
soldier nine was substituted, and will
appear on the Cardinal lot at 4:15.
The usual admission of 25 cents will
be charged those without season tick
ets.
Strong Opponents.
Stanford will encounter strong
opposition when they cross sticks with
the San Francisco delegation. Last
season some of the best contests were
staged with the soldiers. Lawson is
one of the best heavers in the semi
professional ranks, and has sent the
Cardinal batsmen back regularly.
Captain Hayes will use the same
lineup that has played in the last few
games, except that 'Wilkins and Rea
gon may be sent in for Dickey and
Braden. Phelan will umpire.
