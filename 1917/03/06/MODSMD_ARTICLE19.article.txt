# A 						CHANCE TO PREPARE
## 
### 
Stanford's latest move for preparedness seems thus far to have
met with little favor among the people of the University. The ad
ditional training facilities offered by the Department of Military Sci
ence were taken advantage of by only about ten students and two
faculty men yesterday afternoon, indicating that the "civilians" are
perhaps not as alert to the possibilities of this service as might be ex
pected. Most of the volunteeer officers, in the event of a war, will
doubtless be recruited from universities and colleges. Stanford has
already a lead over most of her sister institutions, through the ex
istence of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. Less than half of
the students are enrolled in this, however. The opportunity now of
fered extra men to at least learn the rudiments of the game, is
golden. It cuts down just so much, the additional training which
will be required of an officer in the regular army.
Surely, the most rabid and unreasonable pacifist would not con
demn this extra-warlike move at the present time. VVe want peace if
possible, and it is all right to talk peace under some circumstances.
When it comes, however, to a choice between turning the other cheek
and getting ready for war, we immediately develop a stiff neck.
When we see a blow descending, the natural thing is to prepare to
ward it off. We can not get around the fact that a blow is imminent.
When it comes, those who can take advantage of this opportunity for
drill now, will be better prepared than the average.
