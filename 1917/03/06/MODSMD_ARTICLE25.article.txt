Why should the students of Stan
ford University be forced to endure the
present postoffice service? Letters
have been mailed at the local office at
8 o'clock on a Monday morning, and
have not arrived at their destination
in San Jose until the following Wed
nesday. Packages have waited in the
Stanford office for two weeks without
a notice being sent out or putin the
addressee's box. To insure a parcel,
or to send off a money order means
the loss of fifteen minutes' time, wait
ing for the local postmaster or one of
his equally slow assistants to labor
iously carry out the few necessary
details. It has even been reported
that the Stanford office has not been
opened at the scheduled time in the
morning, while students, anxious to
get to classes, have waited on the out
side. Again I reiterate, why should
the Stanford students endure such a
miserable postoffice?
