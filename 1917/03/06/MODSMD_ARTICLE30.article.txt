# Every Organization to Be in 1918 Quad
## 
### 
Seventeen more organizations will
be represented in the 1918 Quad than
tin any previous Stanford year-book.
By these additions, every organization
in any way connected with the Uni
versity will have its photograph, list
of members or officers in the annual.
Phi Beta Kappa will have its pic
ture in the Quad for the first time.
This carries out the policy outlined
by the 1938 Quad management and
staff to make this year's product the
most completely representative Quad
ever published. It will be a "100%
Quad." Not only will every organiza
tion receive space, but every individ
ual student will be represented by
picture or other mention at least once.
Following are the organizations
which will appear in the Quad for the
first time this year, according to Man
ager F. W. Weeks, *18: Phi Beta
Kappa, Alvarado Club, El Camino
Club, The Illustrated Review, Rifle
Club, Chess Club, Order of the Coif,
Women's Gym Club, Women's Debat
ing Society, El Campo Club, El Toro
Club, Breakers Club, Alpha Chi Sigma,
Spanish Club, Advertising Club, Zool
ogy Club, Geology and Mining Society.
