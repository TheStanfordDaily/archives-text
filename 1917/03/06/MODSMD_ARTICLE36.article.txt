# Wilbur Addresses Women's Auxiliary
## Relation of Church to Society, Health, and Country Is Theme 
### 
"Do something unselfish," was the
keynote of President Wilbur's address
before the Channing Auxiliary meet
ing at the Palace Hotel yesterday, in
San Francisco. The President out
lined some of the duties of a woman's
auxiliary.
"Do something for the children,"
urged Dr. Wilbur. "As club women,
as church women, you are of no value
to society unless you turn your atten
tion to the welfare of children. The
game is over as far as you are con
cerned, unless you train the present
generation to the higher ideals of
life.
"If you think the streets of San
Francisco are a desirable place for the
development of children, your eye
sight is defective and you need the
aid of an oculist," added the college
president.
Dividing the subject o_£ his address
into three divisions, Dr. Wilbur re
ferred to the church in its relation to
social service, to the preservation of
health, and to the preservation of the
country. He said:
"Many look upon the church as a
sort of vehicle on which they can ride
to heaven. Apparently the idea held
by many is to die with their good
clothes on. We do not get down
enough to the level of the people. The
church is a militant organization.
Those connected with it should work
for the good of the country.
"Rut what have we done for our
country in the time of the present
crisis? Have we, as church people,
been of any service? The trouble is,
we use the church for our own pur
poses and not enough for the purposes
of the world. Do something unselfish.
Analyze the history of those who fail
and you will find that much has to do
with the fault of society as well as
to the weakness of the individual.
"Conserve life! Prevent disease!
Take care of humanity! This is of
universal interest and will build up
a deeper, finer and sounder civiliza
tion."
