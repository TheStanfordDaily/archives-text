# Interclass Tennis Play Starts Today
## 
### 
Interclass tennis play, which begins
this afternoon, will continue tomor
row and each consecutive day until
only the winners of the different
classes remain to fight for honors in
the final rounds.
Fortune seems to favor the juniors
when it comes to numbers and good
players, there being three varsity men
among the 1918 racquet wielders. The
shining light among the graduating
men is Herb Hahn, who has done
much in the past to raise the standard
of Stanford's tennis.
In the 1919 and 1920 classes indi
vidual stars do not joom up brightly
and only by the appearance of the
proverbial dark horse does it seem
possible for the underclassmen to
come out ahead.
