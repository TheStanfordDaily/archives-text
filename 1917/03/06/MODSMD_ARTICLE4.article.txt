An altruist appeared on the campus
today in a battered old overcoat, and
calmly started to weed the lawns on
the Row, piling the weeds in an old
sack he carried on his back. He was
bowed down with age. While stu
dents bantered him he calmly con
tinued his work.
A suspicious house-manager, who
saw a bill in the future —"to weeding
lawn" —came out of the house bel
ligerently.
"Hey, what's the big idea here, any
way? Who told you to weed this
lawn?" he asked. With a vacant gaze
the altruist looked up, and then,
while his face lighted with the smile
of his native Italy, he told the abashed
house-manager this story in broken
English.
He was Signor A. Silvestri, form
erly of Naples, now located in San
Francisco. For months he has suf
fered from stomach trouble; doctors
could neither cure nor help him.
Then lie remembered a treatment used
in the old country. It consisted of
frying fresh mustard plants in butter,
and today he was searching for health,
collecting green and yellow shoots of
mustard on the Stanford campus.
