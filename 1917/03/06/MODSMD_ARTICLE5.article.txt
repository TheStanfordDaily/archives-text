# 1917 Victorious in Inter class Baseball
## 
### 
Interclass baseball honors for the
1917 season were captured by the
seniors last night when they nosed out
the sophomores in the seventh inning
by a 7 to 6 score. Heavy hitting,
coupled with many bad boots, fea
tured the play of both nines.
"Shrimp" Wilkins was the star of
the day with the stick, securing four
safe hits out of five times up, and driv
ing in three of the scores made by
the seventeeners, besides scoring once
himself. Boydston and Mitchell
twirled for the sophomores, while
Dickey and Stevens worked for the
upperclass team.
"Skin" Wilson umpired the contest,
and managed to survive, although his
decisions were under fire throughout.
