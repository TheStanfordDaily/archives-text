# CHANCELLOR STILL LOOKS FOR NO WAR
## KEEP COOL, HE SAYS Country Not Obliged to Enter World War for National Honorâ€”Dr. Jordan 
### 
Chancellor emeritus david
STARR JORDAN does not look
for war with Germany, though
he says it is practically impossible to
predict the outcome of the present sit
uation, without more knowledge of
facts.
Wilson Knows Best.
"The best thing for the United
States to do is to put its feet in hot
water and its head in cold water,"
says Dr. Jordan. "President Wilson
knows better than the rest of us what
he has to deal with. Nothing has hap
pened to give us a fundamental rea
son for war. There isn't any prece
dent to follow. What may happen I
don't know, but if we go to war we
should think out the good results
which may happen and whether they
balance the humiliation, degredation
and loss which war always brings.
"Our national honor makes no re
quirement of us except to behave hon
orably toward others. So far as I
remember, no war ever had its ori-
gin in honor." Dr. Jordan refutes
the argument of President Wilbur
that other nations will despise the
United States in case the arms of this
country are not used against Ger
many, by saying, "No nation is in a
position to criticise except one, who
like ourselves, has stood for law and
order.
"I do not deny there are two sides
to the question. Our forces should
go where our sympathies are. On the
other hand the question of the good
we can do by keeping out of enmity
and being helpful friends to all the
people, a position lost once and for
all if we go to war, must be taken
into consideration. To men the bal
ance is wholly on the side of law and
order, unless our position is wholly
undermined.
"War merely for revenge or pun
ishment is about as low a motive as
is used. The people of this country,
outside of the New York financial sys
tem and the born militarists, do not
want war. The war group does not
number one in one hundred taking
the country through. Some of us
Kvho would like to help the Allies
would not like to see the north of
France and Belgium starved to death
in the process,"
