# First Book Published by Jordan Given to Library
## 
### 
The Stanford library was recently
made the recipient of the first hook
ever written by Chancellor Jordan.
In co-operation with Balfour H. Van
Vleck, he compiled a little book en
titled "A Popular Key to the Birds,
Reptiles, Batrachians and Fishes of
Northern United States East of the
Mississippi," meant primarily for be
ginners in science. It was published
in 1874.
The hook has been in the possession
of Dr. C. W. Gilbert, who presented it
to the library. So far as is known this
is the only copy in existence. Dr.
Jordan himself does not have a copy.
