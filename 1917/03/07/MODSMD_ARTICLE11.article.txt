A half-dozen cell locks, together with

The University players requested
the use of prison equipment to aid
them to secure every possible touch
of reality to their performance. They
have constructed cell doors that
weigh 100 pounds each for their cor

services of the Alcazar Theater to
build and finish the scenery for the
court-room and prison episodes.
