# Basketball Season Proves Successful
## Stanford Quintet Wins Ten Games and Loses Eight During Year 
### 
Ten victories an.d eight defeats were
the results of the basketball season
completed by the game with Davis
Farm quintet, last Friday. Stanford
met but five teams which were better
than the Cardinal since of the eight
loses, six of them were to three fives.
Captain Wheatly organized a var
sity squad, and the first contests for
the Cardinal came in the south, when
they electrified critics by taking four
out of five games. All the victories
were by large margins.
Stanford met her old rival, U. C.,
next, and was forced to accept defeat
in both games. The Blue and Gold
had a team of veterans and won both
contests by consistent team-play.
From the beginning of the season
the Cardinal has played in hard luck.
Bonney, counted one of the best for
wards on the coast, was put out of his
regular form early in the season by a
severe injury. Roney and Wheatly,
two star players, received bad hurts
and were not able to give their best.
The burden of playing was put on
Sullivan, Greve, Estes and Righter.
Credit for the success of the team in
the largest measure is due to Captain
Wheatly. He organized the five that
completely routed its southern oppon
ents, and when the coach took charge
of things he was always on hand to
help.
