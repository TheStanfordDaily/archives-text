# WHAT OF ROBINS?

### 
To accuse Raymond Robins of "combining serious drama with
cheap theatricalism," is to doubt his sincerity. We feel that The
Daily Californian, in making a statement of this nature, has taken too
narrow a view of the man. Admitting a certain feeling of disappoint
ment in that Robins confined himself so closely to the religious, to
the exclusion of some vital questions of the day, we still take off our
hat to him as a man immensely sincere in the work he is doing. As
to "Billy Sunday tactics," and "Worn-out tricks of the revivalist," we
think, that for a religious worker he contains himself well. True, he
appreciates the value of a dramatic presentation, but this was not so
offensive as to "insult our intelligence." However, California atmos
phere might have affected Robins differently from that of Stanford.
