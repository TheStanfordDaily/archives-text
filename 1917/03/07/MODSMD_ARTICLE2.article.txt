# Ten Eliminated in Interclass Tennis
## Holman's Defeat of Barber and Wolford's Victory Over Johns Feature 
### 
Several surprises and some ragged
tennis were brought out in the first
rounds of the interclass tournament
held yesterday, ten men being elim
inated. Due to the fact that it is still
early in the season, most of the play
ers were not in true rorm, and the
play lacked the usual zip.
Perhaps the greatest surprise of the
day came with the defeat of Captain
Allyn H. Barber, '18, by R. Holman,
'18, 6-3, 6-1. C. Wolford, '18, and H. V.
D. Johns, '18, engaged in two hard
fought matches, Wolford finally win
ning 6-4, 6-2.
In the senior frame H. L. Halm de
feated S. Chapman in a three-set
match, 6-1, 2-6, 6-3, while F. K. Mur
ray, '17, put 11. C. Fabling, '17, out of
the running.
