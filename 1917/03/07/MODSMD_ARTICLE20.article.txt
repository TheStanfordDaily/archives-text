# MISPLACED TRUST

There was a time at Stanford when we could point with pride to
the books and other personal property lying about on the quad win
dows, as a testimonial of the innate honesty of University students.
We had reason to be proud then, for it was safe to leave such articles
for any length of time. Now, however, if we lose sight of our books,
for a moment on the quad, we do so at the risk of having them spir
ited away. This is to say the least, annoying, particularly if one has
lecture notes in the book taken, and it is the day before examinations.
Several complaints of this sort have been heard lately. Besides books,
pictures advertising Assembly Hall productions have been taken.
These thefts seem trival in themselves, but it hurts to realize
that we can no longer trust each other in little things. There are prob
ably a very few people who are doing the thieving, but they impose
the stigma of mistrust upon the entire campus. Such despicable
knavery can not be too severely condemned. It would be well to keep
a watch for the perpetrators of some of these small thefts, so that an
example may be made of them. In this, members of the Student Con
ference could well co-operate.
