# Will Play Last Ice Hockey Game Friday
## 
### 
Ice hockey teams from Stanford and
California will meet in the third and
last game of their series Friday night
in Tait's Winter Garden, Sutter and
Pierce, San Francisco, at 8 o'clock.
Stanford lost both previous games
by scores of 4-1 and 3-0, but in both
of these contests the Cardinal was
weakened by the absence of several of
its best players. Friday night's game
is expected to be the closest and best
of the series, as Stanford will, for the
first time, have its full lineup on the
ice.
California will use the same men
who appeared in the previous games
while Stanford will line up with H. H.
Sa.vrc, goal; D. F. Purdy, center;
Ward Hateman, point; D. C. Upp,
rover; W. W. Collins, left wing; L.
.Jones, right wing; S. A. Saunders,
cover-point; L. Schlesinger, W. C.
Atwater, spares.
