### 
Stanford varsity and the freshmen
worked out on the local diamond yes
terday afternoon in a practice game.
Either the varsity was in the best of
form or the first-year aggregation was
absolutely devoid of class, for the
first string tossers ran away with the
contest. The 1920 squad made so
many errors that the scorer lost
count in the early innings.
* * * * *
Wayland and Pike seemed to have
the most diamond dope of any of the
freshmen players. Both were on the
bases and fielded their positions in
faultless form. For the varsity, Lilly
looked the best, getting a bingle and
covering his center garden well.
*****
Captain "Doc" Hayes played both
Wilkins and Reagon in the lineup yes-;
terday. They both looked good to !
the few fans on hand, and bid well for:
regular Cardinal berths. Draper j
pitched, but did not show up as well
as usual.
*****
In the final game of the interclass
series, Wilkins proved to be the star'
batsman, getting four hits out of four:
trips to the plate.
* * * * *
"Doc" Hayes is getting back the bat
ting eye that made him feared by the;
California delegation last season.
Yesterday, he hit the ball hard every
time up. He is also playing in ex- j
cellent form around first base.
*****
California will not have the services I
of Thompson, last year's freshman
captain, this years. The lanky first- j
baseman is working out with the Oak- i
land Coasters at their spring training |
camp, and bids fair to win a position ;
with some good club, if not with the
Oaks.
*****
The Blue and Gold skipper, Sammy
Adair, is playing one of the best
games of his career. His ankle, which
kept him out of the Big Games last
year, is almost entirely well, and the
star centerfielder is as good as ever.
*****
Carl Zamlock is still coaching the
Bruins, Oakland allowing him to re
main with California until March 10th.
*****
Zamlock is playing his men in the
following order this year: Dimmock,
McCabe, and Holmes on the mound,
Beckett behind the bat, Starbird on
first, McNally on second, Rohwer on
short, Smith on third, Veckie in left,
Adair in center, and Rohwer in right.

regular Cardinal berths. Draper j
pitched, but did not show up as well
as usual.

In the final game of the interclass
series, Wilkins proved to be the star'
batsman, getting four hits out of four:
trips to the plate.

"Doc" Hayes is getting back the bat
ting eye that made him feared by the;
California delegation last season.
Yesterday, he hit the ball hard every
time up. He is also playing in ex- j
cellent form around first base.

California will not have the services I
of Thompson, last year's freshman
captain, this years. The lanky first- j
baseman is working out with the Oak- i
land Coasters at their spring training |
camp, and bids fair to win a position ;
with some good club, if not with the
Oaks.

The Blue and Gold skipper, Sammy
Adair, is playing one of the best
games of his career. His ankle, which
kept him out of the Big Games last
year, is almost entirely well, and the
star centerfielder is as good as ever.
*****
Carl Zamlock is still coaching the
Bruins, Oakland allowing him to re
main with California until March 10th.
*****
Zamlock is playing his men in the
following order this year: Dimmock,
McCabe, and Holmes on the mound,
Beckett behind the bat, Starbird on
first, McNally on second, Rohwer on
short, Smith on third, Veckie in left,
Adair in center, and Rohwer in right.
Stanford varsity and the freshmen
worked out on the local diamond yes
terday afternoon in a practice game.
Either the varsity was in the best of
form or the first-year aggregation was
absolutely devoid of class, for the
first string tossers ran away with the
contest. The 1920 squad made so
many errors that the scorer lost
count in the early innings.

Wayland and Pike seemed to have
the most diamond dope of any of the
freshmen players. Both were on the
bases and fielded their positions in
faultless form. For the varsity, Lilly
looked the best, getting a bingle and
covering his center garden well.

Captain "Doc" Hayes played both
Wilkins and Reagon in the lineup yes-;
terday. They both looked good to !
