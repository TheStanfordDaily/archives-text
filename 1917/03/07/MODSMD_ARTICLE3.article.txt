Stanford alumni in Sacramento are
going to stage an alumni banquet
March 9, according to O. W. Newman,
'13, president of the Stanford Club of
Sacramento, in a letter received to
day.
The object of the banquet is to stir
up a little of the old-time spirit
among the alumni of Sacramento, and
they will feature particularly the class
of '95. Mr. Newman's idea is not only
to have copies of The Daily Palo Alto
on hand but also any old relics that
would bring back the good old days to
the assembled old-timers.
