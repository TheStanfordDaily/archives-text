Ever wonder what Founders' Day
was all about? Well, others have.
Under the title of "Spirit of Found
ers' Day,"the editor of the Alumnus
has explained it all. Here is what he
says:
March 9 is the anniversary of the
birth of Senator Stanford. It was
first observed in 1894, the senator
having died during the previous
summer vacation. The late Horace
Davis delivered an address in the
old Encina gymnasium on Senator
Stanford's life and character, and
the late Professor A. G. Newcomer
read his beautiful Memorial Ode.
On succeeding anniversaries ad
dresses were delivered sometimes
by members of the faculty and more
often by speakers from outside on
topics relating to the founder or
on educational subjects. One of the
early speakers was President Mar

California. After Mrs. Stanford's
death the designation of the day
was changed from Founder's Day
to Founders' Day. It was her wish
that the anniversary of Mr. Stan
ford's birth should be marked by
special exercises.
The day, being that of the birth
