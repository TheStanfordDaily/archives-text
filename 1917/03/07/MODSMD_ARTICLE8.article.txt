4 r WERE running this Univer-
I sity, I would put the study of
Shakespeare into a Department
of Physical Expression, make it a
part of every normal course of study,
and couple it not with literature, but
with athletics." So spoke H. Gran
ville Barker, Esq., the noted English
actor and producer of Shakespeare, in
his lecture, "The Statin"; oi Shake
speare," last night. Chancellor Jor
dan introduced the speaker as his
cousin, saying that they are both de
scendants from the Grarjville's of
Devonshire, England.
Must Act Shakespeare.
The only way to study Shakespeare
is by acting it, according to Mr. Bar
ker, who says: "More nonsense has
been written about Shakespeare than
any other man in any age." The great
fault with the modern interpretation
of Shakespeare is its realistic stage
: etting. which tends to distract atten
tion from the poetry itself, and by re
quiring elaborate scenery necessitates
the removal or withdrawal of some of
the most valuable parts of his plays,
the speaker told his audience. In
Shakespearian production, "We should
speak the text, the whole text, and
nothing but the text."
A return to the Elizabethan stage is
better than the modern realistic type, j
but better still is the use of the stage
which Shakespeare would have used, 1
had he the facilities. Along these!
lines, Mr. Barker has devised a stage,!
the simple settings of which make i
possible its use for any play of i
Shakespeare. In costuming also, the'
aim should be Shakespeare's idea
rather than historical accuracy. The
speaking of the verse, which is, Mr.
Barker says,"the crux of Shake
speare," should be free and natural,
and not hampered by the artificialities
.introduced in the 18th century.
America, thinks Mr. Barker, in the
coming century, will have to remould j
the English tongue. It would be a i
great benefit if we could infuse into it i
some of the spirit of Shakespeare,
who, he says, is unequaled as a maker
! of word-music.
