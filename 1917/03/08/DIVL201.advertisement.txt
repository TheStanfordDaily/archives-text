FOUNDERS' DAY
is of especial interest this year as it commemorates the twenty-fifth an.
niversary of the opening of the University.
Every Stanford man and woman ought to be familiar with the early
history of their Alma Mater. The souvenir book, "A Visit to Stanford
University," tells the story in a fascinating way, and there are many in.
teresting illustrations showing the old "Camp,"the big chimney, the
Memorial Church as it was before the earthquake, etc. This book may
be obtained at the bookstores, price 50 cents. It is a most welcome sou.
venir for visitors attending the Founders' Day exercises.
