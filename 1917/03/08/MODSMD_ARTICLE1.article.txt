# NEW SCHEDULE OF GYM WORK IS PLANNED
## SIXTEEN GROUPS MADE Choice Given Each Quarter With Aim of Variety in Sports 
### 
PHYSICAL DIRECTOR DR. HER
BERT R. STOLZ today announced
the plan under which the various
classes in Physical Training and
Athletics would be conducted at the
beginning of the fall quarter next
October. Under the recent ruling of
the Academic Council all underclass
men will be required to enter either
the Department of Military Training
or that of Physical Training and Ath
letics and to take work in one or the
other of these departments for three
times a week. When a choice is made
of Military or Physical Training,
three-quarters work 'is required in
that department.
According to the system worked out
by Dr. Stolz, work in his department
has been divided into sixteen groups,
a choice of which any man is priv
eleged to make. When he has made
his choice, however, he must remain
in that group for the balance of the
quarter. These groups contain one
or more forms of exercise, the first
form listed being the one which in
general more time will be devoted to,
and in which a man will receive ex
pert instruction. In the remaining
exercises in the group, though he will
be given some instruction, the idea in
general will be to allow freedom of
action in this, so that it will be more
or less a matter of recreation.
In the groups, emphasis is made on
