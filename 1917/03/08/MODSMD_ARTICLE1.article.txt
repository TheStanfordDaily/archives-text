# NEW SCHEDULE OF GYM WORK IS PLANNED
## SIXTEEN GROUPS MADE Choice Given Each Quarter With Aim of Variety in Sports 
### 
PHYSICAL DIRECTOR DR. HER
BERT R. STOLZ today announced
the plan under which the various
classes in Physical Training and
Athletics would be conducted at the
beginning of the fall quarter next
October. Under the recent ruling of
the Academic Council all underclass
men will be required to enter either
the Department of Military Training
or that of Physical Training and Ath
letics and to take work in one or the
other of these departments for three
times a week. When a choice is made
of Military or Physical Training,
three-quarters work 'is required in
that department.
According to the system worked out
by Dr. Stolz, work in his department
has been divided into sixteen groups,
a choice of which any man is priv
eleged to make. When he has made
his choice, however, he must remain
in that group for the balance of the
quarter. These groups contain one
or more forms of exercise, the first
form listed being the one which in
general more time will be devoted to,
and in which a man will receive ex
pert instruction. In the remaining
exercises in the group, though he will
be given some instruction, the idea in
general will be to allow freedom of
action in this, so that it will be more
or less a matter of recreation.
In the groups, emphasis is made on
both major and minor sports, so that
as many men as possible will be
brought out for these. Due to this,
the number of men in any one group
will vary with the season.
The department in arranging the
groups had four objects chiefly in
mind. In the first place, it is desired
to teach every man at least one game,
so that he will learn the benefit de
rived from team work and co-opera
tion. It is desired in the second place
to teach all men some sport that they
can use after leaving the University,
and perhaps that will be useful all |
through life. That every man should
learn to swim is the third idea. In
the last place, it is desired to give a
man all the benefit possible in the
matter of posture. Though this is
accomplished in many places by com
pelling men to take a year's work in
the gymnasium in setting up exercises
and the like, before allowing him to
go out for sports, Dr. Stolz is not a
believer in this method. It is his idea
to allow men to engage in the sport
at once, but to improve his bearing,
the work of all classes will be pre
faced by a five-minute snappy setting
up drill.
The'periods of required work in the
Physical Training department are
comparatively short. Half-hour peri- i
ods will be employed, as, for instance,
afternoon classes will meet from 4:30
to 5:00 and from 5:10 to 5:40.1
Though the class continues, a man is
only required to take the half-hour.
Arranging of the schedule of the
classes of the underclassmen has
been made so as to allow the use of
the gymnasium to upperclassmen the
largest amount of time possible, and
investigation shows that they will still
have plenty of opportunity to use any
department of it.
In co-operation with the Depart
ment of Education, a Teachers' Phy
sical Training course has been sched
uled for next year. This course will
prepare men for obtaining positions as
physical and athletic instructors in
the schools throughout the state.
This will be the only course in the
Physical Training and Athletics de
partment in which credit will be
given. The credit given here will be
given on the same basis as laboratory
credit is now given, that is, one unit
for three hours' work.
The following is the schedule ar
ranged for the various groups for the
first quarter:
Group I—Track, swimming, appar
atus, MWF 10 to 11 or 11 to 12.
