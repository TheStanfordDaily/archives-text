# Apartment House to Be Built on Campus
## Mrs. Burt Estes Howard Will Construct a Dwelling to Accomodate Students 
### 
A three-story apartment house will
be constructed on the campus by Mrs.
Burt Estes Howard, according to an
announcement made today. The loca
tion of the house is on the new road
being built from the postoffice to
Lagunita.
Plans include twenty-six apart
ments, with outdoor sleeping accom
modations for sixteen of them. Kraft
& Son, well known architects of San
Francisco, drew up the plans.
In order to make provision for any
one who may wish to live in the
house, apartments are to be provided j
for cither one person or for a family, j
Each will contain all modern con- I
veniences. Hot water, heat, disap-1
pearing beds, dumb waiters, dressing
rooms, large closets and a storage
room for trunks in the basement, will
make the house a rival of the best
places on the coast.
One of the best features of the
apartment will be a large living room
down stairs to serve in the capacity
of a social center for people in the
house.
The site for the place, which will be
completed in time for the opening of
the University for the fall term, is In
the oaks to the right of the Lagunita
road.
