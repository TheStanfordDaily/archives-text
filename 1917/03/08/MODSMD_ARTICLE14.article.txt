# NATION'S LACK OF CONSCIOUSNESS SCORED GERMANY IS EXAMPLE
## Columbia ProfessoT Bases Progress on American Institutions

AMERICAN youth "will never be
prepared to defend its country
until it has a country to de
fend," Frederick J. E. Woodbridge,
Johnsonian Professor of Philosophy
at Columbia University and Dean of
the Faculties of Political Science,
Philosophy, Pure Science and Fine
Arts, told an audience in Assembly
Hall this morning, during the course
of a thoughtful lecture on "National
Self-Consciousness."
No Self-Consciousness.
America, Professor Woodbridge
thinks, has as yet no national self
consciousness, there being still a
sense of independence among states.
He took as illustrations nations with
a distinct self-consciousness, as
especially France and Germany. Ger
many, he said, "has achieved na
tional self-consciousness —for which 1
can find no parallel in history." In
France, as in Germany, Professor
Woodbridge said, the people had a
common view as to what their nation
really was.
Bringing the question home to this
country, the visitor asked, "Can we
say anything similar of America? I
think not. America has not yet at
tained national self-consciousness and
does not know yet what she is. We
have opened our doors to the whole
world," the speaker continued. "As
soon as the foreigner becomes eco
nomically independent he tends to look
back to the spiritual ideals, to the
literature; to the customs of that
particular country from which he
came."
In bringing about a national self
consciousness, Professor Woodbridge
believes that Americans must forget
the old European idea of sovereignity
—of the conquest of man by man, and
must think in terms of the conquest
of man over nature as a basis for
American self-consciousness.
