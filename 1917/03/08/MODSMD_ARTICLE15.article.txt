# Constitution Plans Discussed by Women
## Living Group Representation Is Favored by "500" in Mass Meeting 
### 
Women's mass meeting, held last
night in the Little Theater, was the
scene of a lively discussion carried
on by about one-fourth of Stanford's
"500." Three plans for a new consti
tution were offered. The Women's
Debating Club, for whom Miss Mar
garet Shedd, 'I'o, was speaker, pre
sented a plan in which all legislation
would be carried on directly in mass
meetings of the University women,
and the executive power would be
vested in a hoard of five members
elected by the women at large. The
Constitution committee, appointed by
Women's Council, offered, through
Miss Vaal Stark, '17, a plan in which
representation to Conference would
be from each living group of the Uni
versity. The commission form of gov
ernment, by which many cities are
managed, was also proposed, but with
drawn later. A straw vote was taken
on the first two plans, resulting 6S to
17 in favor of the proposal of the
Constitution committee.
Women's Conference will consider
the suggestions made last night as
a basis for the formation of a new
constitution, to be presented to Stan
ford women for ratification.
