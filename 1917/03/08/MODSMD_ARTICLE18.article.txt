# THE 						GOVERNMENT OF THE FIVE HUNDRED
## 
### 
It is with no little trepidation that we are about to offer our
opinion on the subject of the proposed new constitution for women's
self-government, since recent experience has shown a tendency among
the Five Hundred to violently resent comment coming from the male
contingent of Stanford. Having decided convictions in regard to the
matter, however, we are taking the risk of being "called" for inter
fering in a discussion which perhaps concerns the women only.
The two plans which received the most attention at last night's
mass meeting were to either have a Conference composed of repre
sentatives from the living groups, or to constitute the entire body of
women a conference, with a council merely initiating legislation to
be passed on by this large group. The former seems to us to be by
far the better, and the only one which would give satisfaction. The
latter would either be unwieldy or inadequate, depending on the
amount of interest shown by the women.
More likely it would be inadequate, for it is too much to expect
that the Five Hundred would be universally interested. Women in
certain groups would take a greater part in the government than
others, resulting in some portions of the campus being inadequately
represented or not represented at all. It might] be answered that
those who have no interest are just as well not represented, but the
fact remains that if the government is to be a success, all the groups
on the campus should take part in it, since it is in the living groups
that we find the greatest opportunity for supervision. Even granting
that universal interest were shown, we believe it impossible for five
hundred women to accomplish anything in the way of legislation.
The well known weakness of the fair sex would necessitate an ex
tension of the ten-thirty rule, all to no purpose. It might be very
good practice for the women, but not for self-government.
Representative government through the living groups has proved
a big improvement for the men of the University. Although condi
tions among the women are somewhat different, there is every rea
son to believe the same system would apply to them. We believe a
new plan is needed for the Five Hundred, and hope they will hesi
tate a long time before rejecting the representative scheme.
