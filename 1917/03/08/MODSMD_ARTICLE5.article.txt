"Justice," in the Assembly Hall to
morrow evening, will be "covered" by
San Francisco newspaper writers.
The daring of the college players in
undertaking the presentation of the
Galsworthy drama has attracted the
attention of dramatic critics, and will
draw them from their typewriters to
the campus.

ing production to H. W. Maloney, and
requested that tickets be sent him in
order that he might review "Justice"
for the "Bulletin." Baily further re
