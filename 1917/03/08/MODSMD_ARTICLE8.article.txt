# FIRST TRACK MEET ON CARD FOR SATURDAY
## GOOD TIME EXPECTED Varsity Will Oppose Combination of Freshman and Palo Alto All-Stars 
### 
STANFORD track fans will have
their first opportunity to witness
the local squad run full distance
events Saturday afternoon at 2:30,
when, according to the plans of Coach
Templeton and Captain Aupperle, a
squad composed of Palo Alto men and
the freshmen meet the remaining var
sity men. E. A. Schnell, '16, Varsity
lialf-miler, has been chosen to lead
the Palo Alto-Freshmen combination,
while Captain Aupperle will of course
licad the varsity squad.
i'silo Alto Team Strong.
The Palo Alto contingent will in
clude not only men living in Palo
Alto now who are out for track, but
will take in all men who used to at
tend Palo Alto High, or who have
lived there for some time. Coupled
with the freshmen, Schnell's team
should make a strong bid for the hon
ors Saturday and as the teams are
very near evenly matched, excellent
competition promises to appear.
In the distance events, Chapman
and Wilson w'll appear in the two
mile for the campus men, while
Loucks and Samis will offer good com
petition on the part of the "Pally"
men. The mile will find Aupperle,and
probably Wilson, with Samis appear
ing to be the best bet for the fresh
men division.
The Palo Alto combination appears
to have all the odds in the half, with
Schnell and Freshman Wilke, though
Scott and Mackel will make them
travel to win.
The quarter promises to be a thril
ler, with Dievendorff, West, and B.
Rogers lining up against Sloman,
Hudner and P. Rogers. Hurdle events
will find House and Williams and Hal
sted on the side of the varsity men,
while Johnny Norton is going to ap
pear tomorrow to aid the Palo Alto
men, and in company with "Dink"
Templeton and probably a freshmen
entry, should provide a close race.
In the field events, the campus var
sity men appear to have the lead on
the Palo Alto-Freshmen combination,
while the latter look to have a major
ity of point winners in the sprints.
Graduate Manager Behrens an
nounces that season tickets or 25
cents will be for admittance.
