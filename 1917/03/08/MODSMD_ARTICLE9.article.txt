### 
With Mattei and iloever pitching
winning baseball, the Stanford var
. ity defeated the Fort Miley team yes
trilay afternoon on the home pasture.
The final score was 4 to 2, the contest
acting but seven innings. Taken as
a whole, the game was slow, listless,
and devoid of interest, except for two
frames that gave the fans all the
thrill; 3 and uncertainties that make
baseball what it is.
In the first inning, the locals, crip
pled by the absence of some of the
best payers, went, to pieces before
b > soldier aggregation. Two runs
.or.' scored on two infield singles,
two plays of the "fielders' choice"
variety, and two errors. The Stan
ford infield looked bad during this
initial spasm.

run. Hayes sent Campbell across on
a sacrifice fly, and Lilly was safe on
an error. Wilkins ended the inning,
being llagged out sliding to third.
