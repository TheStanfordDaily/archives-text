I The curtain will rise on this
most daring of all dramas at
tempted at Stanford, at 8:15 tonight.
A record-breaking audience, attracted
from every part of the Peninsula by
this magnet, will expect much from
the English and Masquers players
who are to appear in a drama that
other amateur organizations feared to
undertake.
Jio Disappointments.
There will be no disappointments
tonight. Galsworthy's masterpiece
will impress and convince at Stanford
as it did in London and New York.
From the first lines of Act I until
the final word, Galsworthy strikes a
note of human sympathy. When in
the opening scene, Ruth Honeywill
(Nellita C'hoate) comes to the man she
loves, tiie youth fated to destruction
under the chariot wheels of justice,
and the following dialogue ensues,
there is opened up a seldoip-seen
vista of the background of human
life.
Ruth (in a low, hurried voice) —
lie's on the drink again, Will. He
tried to cut my throat, last night. 1
came out with the children before he
was awake. I went 'round to you
Falder (Gordon Davis) — I've
changed my digs.
Ruth —Is it all ready for tonight?
Falder —I've got the tickets. Meet
me at 11:45 at the booking office.
For God's sake, don't forget we're
man and wife!
Ruth —You're not afraid of going,
are you? . . . You've just to say. It's
not too late.
Falder —It IS too late. Here's seven
pounds. Booking office, —11:45 to
night. If you weren't what you are to
me, Ruth !
Ruth —Kiss me! (they cling to
gether passionately, then fly apart
just, as Cokeson re-enters the room).
