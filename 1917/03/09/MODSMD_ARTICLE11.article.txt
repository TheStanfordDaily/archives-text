# Strength of Oarsmen Tested by Coach Guerena
## 
### 
Coach "Husky" Guerena put six
varsity crew candidates through
"slugging matches" on Lagunita yes
terday. The men who worked out
were Steinbeck, Russell, Coleman, La
Forge, Watts, and Keller.
Two men were sent out in the pair
oared shells and their relative
strength was tested by finding which
man could pull the other around.
Last night was the first time actual
strength tests have been made on the
varsity oarsmen.
