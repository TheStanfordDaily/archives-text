## 
### 
Pine Cottage, the historic relic of
the old days of the Stanford ranch,
has practically disappeared to make
way for the new library. Pine Cottage
was one of the earliest buildings on
the estate, being erected as the
Frenchman's Kennels. Later, when
the present quadrangle was under
construction, Pine Cottage was the
architect's headquarters.
