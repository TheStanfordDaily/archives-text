# THE 						FRATERNITY PROBLEM
## 
### 
Fraternity representatives last week voted to drop the idea of
forming an adequate interfraternity conference, deciding that infor
mal gatherings" would fill any need that the societies may have for
co-operation. It is interesting to note that, although this decision
seemed to be pretty unanimous, three-fourths of the delegates were
authorized to favor the adoption of some constitution. At the first
meeting held, there was but one vote cast against the formation of a
conference. What has become of all the interest? Is it a little work
we are afraid of? Or have the wet blankets cast by two or three
groups served to cool the ardor of those who believe the scheme to be a
good and essential one? It seems incredible that thinking men could
be swept off their feet in this manner.
What possible progress can come through the "informal gather
ings" recommended last week ? When questions arise we want action,
and not discussion only. In order to get action, there must be a cen
tral representative body with some power. We can talk our heads off
without accomplishing anything. An interfraternity conference can
not possibly do the fraternities any harm, and we are of the opinion
that it would do an immense amount ot good*
One fraternity representative made the statement that there are
no problems before the Greek societies here now. If being on trial for
existence affords no problem he is probably right. The President is
not antagonistic toward fraternities as such, but has said that he ex
pects them to justify their existence. This means that there must be
an improvement in scholarship, in finances and in moral conduct. Each
fraternity can do a great deal to better its own condition, but there are
some things which can be accomplished only by ;co,-operation.
The panacea for most of the evils is a wiser method of choosing
new men. This can be secured ,by second semester or sophomore
pledging. The fraternities should have a voice in deciding which is
best for them, and this is one of the first problems for a conference.
With the one-year dormitory rule, some pledging rule will no doubt be
essential. Should fraternities sit idly by and have a rule imposed
which might not be the right one, when, by co-operating with the ad
ministration the problem could be better and more satisfactorily solved?
This is perhaps the most pressing question at present, but finances
could surely stand a little attention from the fraternities as a body.
There are plenty of problems and there is need for a conference.
If we are right in the assumption that a good majority of fratern
ities still favor the adoption of an effective conference, we would like
to see another attempt made to organize under a new constitution.
Why allow a few to dictate to the majority?

There are plenty of problems and there is need for a conference.
If we are right in the assumption that a good majority of fratern
ities still favor the adoption of an effective conference, we would like
to see another attempt made to organize under a new constitution.
Why allow a few to dictate to the majority?
Fraternity representatives last week voted to drop the idea of
forming an adequate interfraternity conference, deciding that infor
mal gatherings" would fill any need that the societies may have for
co-operation. It is interesting to note that, although this decision
seemed to be pretty unanimous, three-fourths of the delegates were
authorized to favor the adoption of some constitution. At the first
meeting held, there was but one vote cast against the formation of a
conference. What has become of all the interest? Is it a little work
we are afraid of? Or have the wet blankets cast by two or three
groups served to cool the ardor of those who believe the scheme to be a
good and essential one? It seems incredible that thinking men could
be swept off their feet in this manner.
What possible progress can come through the "informal gather
ings" recommended last week ? When questions arise we want action,
and not discussion only. In order to get action, there must be a cen
tral representative body with some power. We can talk our heads off
without accomplishing anything. An interfraternity conference can
not possibly do the fraternities any harm, and we are of the opinion
that it would do an immense amount ot good*
One fraternity representative made the statement that there are
no problems before the Greek societies here now. If being on trial for
existence affords no problem he is probably right. The President is
not antagonistic toward fraternities as such, but has said that he ex
pects them to justify their existence. This means that there must be
an improvement in scholarship, in finances and in moral conduct. Each
fraternity can do a great deal to better its own condition, but there are
some things which can be accomplished only by ;co,-operation.
The panacea for most of the evils is a wiser method of choosing
new men. This can be secured ,by second semester or sophomore
pledging. The fraternities should have a voice in deciding which is
best for them, and this is one of the first problems for a conference.
With the one-year dormitory rule, some pledging rule will no doubt be
essential. Should fraternities sit idly by and have a rule imposed
which might not be the right one, when, by co-operating with the ad
ministration the problem could be better and more satisfactorily solved?
This is perhaps the most pressing question at present, but finances
could surely stand a little attention from the fraternities as a body.
