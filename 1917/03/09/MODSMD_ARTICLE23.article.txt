SUNKISTS AMI WALL-FLOWEHS.
Epitaph—Here lie tlie good inten
tions of "Speed" Metre, track captain,
social idol, a prince among men, and
the most popular fellow in college.
"Speed" went to a class jolly-up. All
the peaches were tickled to step with
him. During a tag dance he spotted
a wall-ilower. "Speed" went over to
do his best for the cause. The follow
iug ensueth:
Speed (making a gallant bow) —
Would you like to dance?
Belinda Soursoul —Aw, the music
might stop.
Speed (sitting down by Belinda, to
avoid being razzed by the roughs
above) —Well, it's going now.
B. —Aw, it'll stop about the time we
get started.
S. M. —Pleasant evening.
B. S. —Wonder if they'll have an en
core? It'll just last a minute or two,
though.
S. M. (to himself: "Thank God for
small favors") —Here they go; want
to dances.
B. S. —It'll just stop; but we might
as well.
S. M. (trying to dance) —This is a
fine jolly-up.
B. S. —I don't approve of them very
much. The men and women get ac
quainted too easily. I live in Palo
Alto, where I can study. I don't want
to know very many people. I don't
want to know them —I'm particular
who I get acquainted with, believe
i
me.
S. M.—Sorry I haven't my credent
ials.
Belinda —Well, I don't know who
you are, but this party is well chap
eroned. Look at that girl's dancing—
they ought to enforce the eleven-inch
between-partners rule at dances.
So on ad intermission for poor
"Speed."
Moral —"You can always tell a wall
ilower, but you can't tell it much."
