# "JUSTICE" HITS NEW MARK IN LOCAL DRAMA
## BUFFUM IS THE STAR Davis Interpretation of Falder Consistent—"Three Line" Actors Do Well 
### Frank J. Taylor 
Another weak superstition exploded
with a bang, Friday night, when the
curtain fell upon the last act ot' "Jus
tice," John Galsworthy's stern play,
A lot or people have been yelping
about Stanford audiences not appre
ciating high class drama —they'll no
longer speak above a whisper. The
bang aforementioned was the success
of "Justice."
if anyone did not appreciate this
enterprise of English Club and Mas
quers, it was because he didn't go to
see "Justice." It is enconraging to
note that "Justice" broke the seat
sale record for plays by more than
one hundred dollars —simply a ma
terial evidence of Stanford and Palo
Alto support.
As the Audience Saw It,.
Now for a layman's comment on
the presentation of the play. Tech
nically little is to be said, for lack
of knowledge of technicalities. An
average audience doesn't know
whether a couple of lawyers ought
to talk to the audience or to the jury
on the stage. It does know that when
they go at it as the whole "Justice"
cast went at things Friday night, it's
mighty convincing. The average
audience might have figured out, at
the end of the second act, had it
thought, what the conclusion of "Jus
tice" was to be. Furthermore, it
might then have realized that only
the finishing touches and the natural
ness which Frank Mathieu put on the
"Justice" cast could have carried
keen interest through without a lag.
This is a compliment.
Why Harmony Tumbled.
Now harmony took a tumble, all be
cause Harry Buffum was too good.
He usually is. It's a fact that the
audience was watching Buffum, to the
detriment of the leading characters,
for the congenial smile and sincere
simplicity with which he endowed
the character of Robert Cokeson.
An actor's life is a tough one. If
he's poor, he gets raked over the
coals for holding the play back, and
if he's real good, he's criticized for
raising acting to too high a standard.
However, it was the audience's priv
ilege to concentrate glory on Buffum
if it couldn't help itself.
The foregoing paragraph explains
what was the matter with Gordon
Davis as "William Falder," the junior
clerk and victim of justice. There
wasn't any trouble, at all. Davis
masterfully pictured a consistent
character. Unfortunately, it was a
weak one, with which ordinary people
don't readily fall in sympathy.
Hence, until the cell scene, it was
impossible for Davis to bring this
abject picture of dejection which we
saw in the prisoner's box, into its
rightful position.
The Three-Line Actors.
Right here it's only fitting and
proper to say a word for three three
line actors, the prisoners in the cells,
portrayed by James Quinby, Forrest
Betts and Clifton Cottrell. Good
things often come in minute quanti
ties. Certainly, these bits of acting
were highwater marks in "Justice."
As Ruth Honeywill, Miss Nellita
Choate had the most difficult role in
"Justice." But Miss Choate's pre
sentation of this character did not
strike a responsive cord with her
audience. »She made Ruth Honeywill
too passionate, too vindictive, and too
worldly to be consistent with the de
votion she showered on William
Falder. Miss Choate's portrayal lost
sympathy for Falder in his loyalty to
Ruth Honeywill. Far be it from Gals
worthy's purpose to make Falder a
weak fool, if he were also to be the
victim of justice.
The two advocates, portrayed by
Buford Williams and Goodwin Knight,
were well played. Williams' eloquent
plea for justice provoked many a
tear, while Knight excelled in char
acter acting.
Par Excellence Thus Far.
Thus far were the characters of
"Justice" befitting their parts with
merit par excellence. The rest of the
cast did well, but it required exer
cise of the imagination to disassociate
them from their usual habits and
haunts of the campus and place them
in "Justice."
William Kellogg covered his own
personality well in that of Captain
Danson, the prison governor, giving
the captain certainly a human and
sympathetic air. James Boyle was
made for the part of Walter How, the
young partner of his father, James
How, handled well by Frank McCol
loch. The only adverse criticism to
be meted out to these actors is that
they did not fit as spontaneously into
"Justice" parts as did the headliners.
Tho Lesser Lights.

Coach Mathieu did not show the
skill in picking the minor characters
that he displayed in choosing his
leads. Russell Johnston made a good
office boy without training but needed
finishing touches to be a prison chap
lain. Credit goes to Benjamin Harris,
Ray Farrell, Crozier Culp, Niel Allen,
Lester Levy, Daniel Evans, Robert
Wenzel, and Edwin Harper, as well as
the court affiliations, for their assist
ance in making "Justice" a success.
More time might have given them the
strength of the convicts in the prison
scene.
Sword and society handled
the staging of "Justice" remarkably
well. All departments of dramatic
production combined to make "Jus
tice" the best play of years.

longer speak above a whisper. The
bang aforementioned was the success
of "Justice."
if anyone did not appreciate this
enterprise of English Club and Mas
quers, it was because he didn't go to
see "Justice." It is enconraging to
note that "Justice" broke the seat
sale record for plays by more than
one hundred dollars —simply a ma
terial evidence of Stanford and Palo
Alto support.
As the Audience Saw It,.
Now for a layman's comment on
the presentation of the play. Tech
nically little is to be said, for lack
of knowledge of technicalities. An
average audience doesn't know
whether a couple of lawyers ought
to talk to the audience or to the jury
on the stage. It does know that when
they go at it as the whole "Justice"
cast went at things Friday night, it's
mighty convincing. The average
audience might have figured out, at
the end of the second act, had it
thought, what the conclusion of "Jus
tice" was to be. Furthermore, it
might then have realized that only
the finishing touches and the natural
ness which Frank Mathieu put on the
"Justice" cast could have carried
keen interest through without a lag.
This is a compliment.
Why Harmony Tumbled.
Now harmony took a tumble, all be
cause Harry Buffum was too good.
He usually is. It's a fact that the
audience was watching Buffum, to the
detriment of the leading characters,
for the congenial smile and sincere
simplicity with which he endowed
the character of Robert Cokeson.
An actor's life is a tough one. If
he's poor, he gets raked over the
coals for holding the play back, and
if he's real good, he's criticized for
raising acting to too high a standard.
However, it was the audience's priv
ilege to concentrate glory on Buffum
if it couldn't help itself.
The foregoing paragraph explains
what was the matter with Gordon
Davis as "William Falder," the junior
clerk and victim of justice. There
wasn't any trouble, at all. Davis
masterfully pictured a consistent
character. Unfortunately, it was a
weak one, with which ordinary people
don't readily fall in sympathy.
Hence, until the cell scene, it was
impossible for Davis to bring this
abject picture of dejection which we
saw in the prisoner's box, into its
rightful position.
The Three-Line Actors.
Right here it's only fitting and
proper to say a word for three three
line actors, the prisoners in the cells,
portrayed by James Quinby, Forrest
Betts and Clifton Cottrell. Good
things often come in minute quanti
ties. Certainly, these bits of acting
were highwater marks in "Justice."
As Ruth Honeywill, Miss Nellita
Choate had the most difficult role in
"Justice." But Miss Choate's pre
sentation of this character did not
strike a responsive cord with her
audience. »She made Ruth Honeywill
too passionate, too vindictive, and too
worldly to be consistent with the de
votion she showered on William
Falder. Miss Choate's portrayal lost
sympathy for Falder in his loyalty to
Ruth Honeywill. Far be it from Gals
worthy's purpose to make Falder a
weak fool, if he were also to be the
victim of justice.
The two advocates, portrayed by
Buford Williams and Goodwin Knight,
were well played. Williams' eloquent
plea for justice provoked many a
tear, while Knight excelled in char
acter acting.
Par Excellence Thus Far.
Thus far were the characters of
"Justice" befitting their parts with
merit par excellence. The rest of the
cast did well, but it required exer
cise of the imagination to disassociate
them from their usual habits and
haunts of the campus and place them
in "Justice."
William Kellogg covered his own
personality well in that of Captain
Danson, the prison governor, giving
the captain certainly a human and
sympathetic air. James Boyle was
made for the part of Walter How, the
young partner of his father, James
How, handled well by Frank McCol
loch. The only adverse criticism to
be meted out to these actors is that
they did not fit as spontaneously into
"Justice" parts as did the headliners.
Tho Lesser Lights.

Coach Mathieu did not show the
skill in picking the minor characters
that he displayed in choosing his
leads. Russell Johnston made a good
office boy without training but needed
finishing touches to be a prison chap
lain. Credit goes to Benjamin Harris,
Ray Farrell, Crozier Culp, Niel Allen,
Lester Levy, Daniel Evans, Robert
Wenzel, and Edwin Harper, as well as
the court affiliations, for their assist
ance in making "Justice" a success.
More time might have given them the
strength of the convicts in the prison
scene.
Sword and society handled
the staging of "Justice" remarkably
well. All departments of dramatic
production combined to make "Jus
tice" the best play of years.
Another weak superstition exploded
with a bang, Friday night, when the
curtain fell upon the last act ot' "Jus
tice," John Galsworthy's stern play,
A lot or people have been yelping
about Stanford audiences not appre
ciating high class drama —they'll no

Alto support.
As the Audience Saw It,.
Now for a layman's comment on
the presentation of the play. Tech
nically little is to be said, for lack
of knowledge of technicalities. An
average audience doesn't know
whether a couple of lawyers ought
to talk to the audience or to the jury
on the stage. It does know that when
they go at it as the whole "Justice"
cast went at things Friday night, it's
mighty convincing. The average
audience might have figured out, at
the end of the second act, had it
thought, what the conclusion of "Jus
tice" was to be. Furthermore, it
might then have realized that only
the finishing touches and the natural
ness which Frank Mathieu put on the
"Justice" cast could have carried
keen interest through without a lag.
This is a compliment.
Why Harmony Tumbled.
Now harmony took a tumble, all be
cause Harry Buffum was too good.
He usually is. It's a fact that the
audience was watching Buffum, to the
detriment of the leading characters,
for the congenial smile and sincere
simplicity with which he endowed
the character of Robert Cokeson.
An actor's life is a tough one. If
he's poor, he gets raked over the
coals for holding the play back, and
if he's real good, he's criticized for
raising acting to too high a standard.
However, it was the audience's priv
ilege to concentrate glory on Buffum
if it couldn't help itself.
The foregoing paragraph explains
what was the matter with Gordon
Davis as "William Falder," the junior
clerk and victim of justice. There
wasn't any trouble, at all. Davis
masterfully pictured a consistent
character. Unfortunately, it was a
weak one, with which ordinary people
don't readily fall in sympathy.
Hence, until the cell scene, it was
impossible for Davis to bring this
abject picture of dejection which we
saw in the prisoner's box, into its
rightful position.
The Three-Line Actors.
Right here it's only fitting and
proper to say a word for three three
line actors, the prisoners in the cells,
portrayed by James Quinby, Forrest
Betts and Clifton Cottrell. Good
things often come in minute quanti
ties. Certainly, these bits of acting
were highwater marks in "Justice."
As Ruth Honeywill, Miss Nellita
Choate had the most difficult role in
"Justice." But Miss Choate's pre
sentation of this character did not
strike a responsive cord with her
audience. »She made Ruth Honeywill
too passionate, too vindictive, and too
worldly to be consistent with the de
votion she showered on William
Falder. Miss Choate's portrayal lost
sympathy for Falder in his loyalty to
Ruth Honeywill. Far be it from Gals
worthy's purpose to make Falder a
weak fool, if he were also to be the
victim of justice.
The two advocates, portrayed by
Buford Williams and Goodwin Knight,
were well played. Williams' eloquent
plea for justice provoked many a
tear, while Knight excelled in char
acter acting.
Par Excellence Thus Far.
Thus far were the characters of
"Justice" befitting their parts with
merit par excellence. The rest of the
cast did well, but it required exer
cise of the imagination to disassociate
them from their usual habits and
haunts of the campus and place them
in "Justice."
William Kellogg covered his own
personality well in that of Captain
Danson, the prison governor, giving
the captain certainly a human and
sympathetic air. James Boyle was
made for the part of Walter How, the
young partner of his father, James
How, handled well by Frank McCol
loch. The only adverse criticism to
be meted out to these actors is that
they did not fit as spontaneously into
"Justice" parts as did the headliners.
Tho Lesser Lights.

Coach Mathieu did not show the
skill in picking the minor characters
that he displayed in choosing his
leads. Russell Johnston made a good
office boy without training but needed
finishing touches to be a prison chap
lain. Credit goes to Benjamin Harris,
Ray Farrell, Crozier Culp, Niel Allen,
Lester Levy, Daniel Evans, Robert
Wenzel, and Edwin Harper, as well as
the court affiliations, for their assist
ance in making "Justice" a success.
More time might have given them the
strength of the convicts in the prison
scene.
Sword and society handled
the staging of "Justice" remarkably
well. All departments of dramatic
production combined to make "Jus
tice" the best play of years.
Another weak superstition exploded
with a bang, Friday night, when the
curtain fell upon the last act ot' "Jus
tice," John Galsworthy's stern play,
A lot or people have been yelping
about Stanford audiences not appre
ciating high class drama —they'll no
longer speak above a whisper. The
bang aforementioned was the success
of "Justice."
if anyone did not appreciate this
enterprise of English Club and Mas
quers, it was because he didn't go to
see "Justice." It is enconraging to
note that "Justice" broke the seat
sale record for plays by more than
one hundred dollars —simply a ma
terial evidence of Stanford and Palo
Alto support.
