# TWENTY-FIFTH MILESTONE
## 
### 
Another Founders' Day has been justly celebrated, and the pass
ing of an important milestone commemorated. Stanford University
has seen a quarter-centnry of service, and looks toward a future full of
promise. In the passing - of this milestone, however, one of the great
est pleasures is to glance back over the experience of the years, bring
ing to mind the bright spots of old days and recalling memories of a
younger University. Founders' Day Dinner affords an unequalled op
portunity for alumni and faculty to indulge themselves in reminiscen
ces, while to the students merely listening gives a broader perspective
and a fuller understanding. We live for the present, but it is well to
recall the pleasant past occasionally.
The dinner Saturday evening was the largest and probably the
most successful ever held tc end a Founders' Day celebration on the
campus. We are glad to see the increasing interest shown on this
occasion, and hope the dinner will never lose place in the day's events.
An occasional bouquet never does any harm, and right here we
wish to throw one in the path of Charles K. Field. In a very large
measure, Saturday evening's success was due to him as toastmaster.
We hope he will continue to make his "perennial" appearance on the
Farm.
