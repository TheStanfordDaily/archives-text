### 
Honor, loyalty and patriotism were
| the keynotes of Rev. D. Charles Gard
! tier's address at the dedication of the
new banner of the Reserve Officers'
Corps in Memorial Church. Rev. Gard
ner said:
"This flag is the symbol of Ameri
can citizenship, the emblem of peace
' and good will to all mankind. It is
righteousness which exalteth a nation.
If ever the consciousness of this coun
try ceases to be sensitive to that Great
Principle, and its citizens refuse to
make the necessary sacrifices in its
defense —even the cross of suffering
and sorrow —in that day the United
States will lose her position of moral
elevation among the nations. She will
have lost her soul.
The Flag Away From Home.
"Fo,r most of you the flag has been
part of the color of the landscape of
your life. Wait! Some day you will
fare forth into the larger world. You
will see other lands and foreign faces.
Then you will turn homeward. After
days at sea, you will sight a friendly
ship. For the first time for many
moons you will see, floating proudly at
the mast, the Stars and Stripes. Your
heart will thrill at the sight. Why?
That flag does not speak of battle. It
speaks of national security. It speaks
of the unquenchable idealism which
makes this country the supreme ex
periment in democracy. It tells of the
privileges of free education. It is
the glorious sign of liberty. Out there
u lion the waste of waters it speaks to
you of home! And as your love-lit
eyes look upon that lovely symbol,
your heart will melt, and the meaning
of the flag illumine your very soul.
What Your Duty Is.
"True to the spirit of the Founders
of the University, you were taught that
it is your bounden duty to do your
part to build broad and firm the new
foundations of Western civilization —
with the knowledge of modern science
to wage unending warfare against dis
ease and poverty—to fight against
wrong in political life —to apply your
educated brains to the problems of in
justice and social evils —to have cour
age to uphold the great ideals of
American government—to lead a tame
and self-complacent democracy into
the paths of moral progress—to disci
pline yourselves, body, soul and spirit,
so that when your country calls you
may be able to say: 'Here am I! Send
me!' "
