# ADDRESS OF BRANNER ON MRS. STANFORD
## 
### 
President Emeritus John Casper
Branner told of personal experiences
with .Mrs. Stanford and of her loy
alty to the University. In his address
President Branner told for the first
time of some ideals of Mrs. Stanford
which he wrote down on one occasion
after a conversation with her.
Dr. Branner .said:
"She had a delightful sympathy with
the students; she greatly enjoyed
their freshness and breeziness; and
she liked to think up ways of contrib
uting to their legitimate pleasures.
When driving about the University
grounds it gave her genuine delight to
see the students and to be recognized
and spoken to by them.
Mrs. Stanford Charitable.
"Some one complained to her on a
certain occasion about the fraternity
men playing ball in their front yards
on Sunday. She stoutly defended the
ball players, with whom she was en
tirely in sympathy, and their Sunday
amusements were never interfered
with. But she had no sympathy what
ever with anything irregular or im
proper in their lives or conduct.
"But she was no general fault
finder, and in spite of the annoyances,
she took a philosophical view of the
matter. Speaking of this subject one
day, she said: 'Mr. Branner, if you
ever undertake to do a kindness to
anyone, do it because you think it is
the right thing to do, and don't ex
pect gratitude. For if you do, you
are likely to be disappointed.'
The Vilest Thing.
" 'And if there is in this world any
thing more vile and despicable than a
man of education, and a professor in
a university, who is put there to help,
to teach, to inspire, and to strengthen
young men and young women, but
who betrays his. trust and seeks to be
smirch, outrage, betray and destroy
what he is expected to protect, to help,
and to save, I should not know where

to look for it outside of the jungles of
Africa. That, Mr. Branner, is why I
am so much more interested in the
church on the campus than I am in
your precious rocks.
" 'For no amount of learning can
take the place of decency, and no
amount of science can take the place
of moral backbone. And as the moral
and spiritual life is more important
than the life of our bodies, so moral
and spiritual instruction is more im
portant to young people than instruc
tion of any other kind.
" 'Take away the moral and spiritual
from higher education and I want
nothing to do with this or with any
other university. I don't mean that
students require instruction in doc
trines; that is just what I do not
mean; and it was for that very reason
that I wanted the church to be and to
remain non-sectarian. There is more
in Christianity than doctrine.
"'A man with an education and
without morals is liable to become —
indeed he is almost sure to become —
simply an abler, shrewder criminal
whose ability to prey upon society has
been increased by his education. Like
any other force, education needs intel
ligent guidance if it is to serve any
good purpose. And where shall we
look for such guidance if we look not
to the sound and unselfish principles
taught by Christianity?' "
