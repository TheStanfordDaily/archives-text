"Dr. Jordan was very much in
terested in a cache of liquor that
some of the fellows were supposed
to have hidden," said Mr. Field.
"He could never find it.
"I promised to tell him, some
time, where we used to keep it, and
I'll keep that promise tonight. In
what is now the fifth floor of Encina
Hall, but what used to be an unin
habited attic, there was a little
space in the wall. In that space
there were numerous bottles. The
fellows would carry an empty bot
tle along the ledge to this space
and return with a full one. That
is why there were never any empty
bottles around the campus."
