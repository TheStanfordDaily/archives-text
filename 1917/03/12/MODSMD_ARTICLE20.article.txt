# Poems Commemorate Day
## 
### 
Founders' Day proved the inspira
tion fro two poems from the pens of
seniors. Gerold Robinson wrote the
poem for dedication of the class tree,
while Miss Doris Estcourt is author
of the Founders' Day Anthem. The
verse follows:
Dedication Stanzas.
By Geroid Robinson.
Old Men build all their monuments of
stone
And w r eight the earth with great
memorialsâ€”
With ponderous statues facing down
the past
And stately columns marking each the
end
Of some long road of life. The sturdy
rock
Is polished to a cold perfection. Then
The workers go their way, and leave
The lifeless stuff to melt to earth
again.
Rut Youth remembers life with other
life:
Today this University and we
Are young together, children of the
past,
The great Earth-Mother of us all.
Rut we
Would build no monuments to what
has been.
