# Dr. Jordan Gives Views on United States Entry in the War
## 
### 
"I am not yet convinced that it
would do any good for us to enter the
war," was but one of the many per
sonal expressions of opinion with
which Chancellor Emeritus David
Starr Jordan held the large audience
which had gathered Saturday night
att the seventh annual Founders'
Day Dinner to meet and hear once
again the story of those early days
when Stanford was new, and more
espcially to hear and honor the vet
eran who has grown in the eyes of
the world through the last twenty
five years as Stanford has grown.
Dr. Jordan spoke at length on var
ious phases of the military question.
"I realize," he said, "that armies and
navies cannot be put aside at the
present time, but no country can sur
vive which makes its army and navy
the dominating thing." Speaking of
the "greedy aristocrats" of Germany,
Dr. Jordan said: "Victory of those in
control of the German government
would be a calamity." He hastened
to add, however, that he had no par
ticular grudge against Germany
alone. "England has the same kind
of men, but they haven't taken life in
the same way."
Dr. Jordan believes that "if we en
ter the war for any cause it would
set this nation back for fifty years,"
because people of all nations have
come here looking on America as a
place to escape the hates and jealous
ies of the old world. The money
power, which in some ways, was like
the greedy aristocratic military class
of Gemany, was, Dr. Jordan said, "the
greatest danger the country has," In
trying to lead America into war.
With regard to Japan, Dr. Jordan
gave it as his opinion that there is
"no reason under the heavens that
there should be war between the
United States and Japan.
