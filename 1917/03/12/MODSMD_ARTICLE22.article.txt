# In Memoriam—Founders' Day.

### Doris Estcourt 
The wind blows free on western hills,
The light is clear in western skies,
Where Stanford's sons and daughters
hail
A memory that never dies.
From far and near we come again
To scenes of youth and golden days,
And swell the echoing refrain,
Our Alma Mater's praise.
We turn again in gratitude
To those who in the years gone by
From out their sorrow wove a dream,
And sealed it with a purpose high.
To us who hold their dream in
trust
There falls a sacred duty—we
From day to day are building here
Their dream's reality.
