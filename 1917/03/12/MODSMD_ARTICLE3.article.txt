ceived wherever they have given con
certs, and a good program is prom
ised for tomorrow night's offering. J.

Campus Runners Lose
Freshmen tracksters and former
and present Palo Alto track men
proved too strong a combination for
the campus varsity men on the Stan
ford oval, Saturday, capturing the
event by a 66 to 56 score. Time in
all events, though not record break
ing, was very good, considering the
fact that a cold wind was sweeping
the field and also that the track was
somewhat heavy, due to recent rains.
Dorothy Le Seur Is Bride
Miss Dorothy Le Seur, '18, was
married at noon today to William R.
Longmire, '14. The marriage comes
as a complete surprise to all her
friends. Miss Lo Seur announced her
engagement on Friday evening at the
Alpha Phi house, but it was expected
that the wedding would occur some
time during the summer. The bride
and groom have left for Monterey,
whore they will spend their honey
moon. Longmire belongs to Sigma
Nu.
