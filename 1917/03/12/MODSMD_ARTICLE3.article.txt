Campus Runners Lose
Freshmen tracksters and former
and present Palo Alto track men
proved too strong a combination for
the campus varsity men on the Stan
ford oval, Saturday, capturing the
event by a 66 to 56 score. Time in
all events, though not record break
ing, was very good, considering the
fact that a cold wind was sweeping
the field and also that the track was
somewhat heavy, due to recent rains.
Dorothy Le Seur Is Bride
Miss Dorothy Le Seur, '18, was
married at noon today to William R.
Longmire, '14. The marriage comes
as a complete surprise to all her
friends. Miss Lo Seur announced her
engagement on Friday evening at the
Alpha Phi house, but it was expected
that the wedding would occur some
time during the summer. The bride
and groom have left for Monterey,
whore they will spend their honey
moon. Longmire belongs to Sigma
Nu.
Hawaiians Swim for Exhibit
Swimming fans were treated to an
exceptionally fine exhibition of swim
ming, last Saturday, by Kelei and
Lane, two Hawaiians; Schrooth, win
ner of the 500 yard event at the P. A.
A. championships, and Norman Ross,
ex-'2O. Although no very exception
ally fast times were recorded, the
spectators were delighted at the ease
and speed with which the visitors
plowed through the water.
Motorcyclists Badly Hurt
H. P. Miller, '16, and Victor Hyatt,
'15, were severely injured in a motor
cycle accident, Saturday, on the En
cina path. The driver did not notice
the wire which stretches between two
of the posts on the walk and ran into
it. Both men were thrown from the
machine and bruised up considerably.
They are out of the hospital at pres
ent. s
Ice Hockey Teams Tie
In the hardest fought ice hockey
game of the season, Stanford and
California played three perfect per
iods to a 1 to 1 tie, last Friday eve
ning, at Tait's San Francisco ice rink.
W. W. Collins, '19, and H. H. Sayre,
'19, played exceptionally well for
Stanford, playing a heady, aggressive
game throughout.
Friday's contest marks the last
hockey game of the first season of the
sport at Stanford. Hockey has proved
itself to be a valuable asset in Stan
ford sport circles and is here to stay.
A great deal of its success is due to
the efforts of Mr. John Tait of San
Francisco.
Huston Next Union Speaker
Dean Huston of the Law School
will give an address, in the Union,
Wednesday at 7:30, on "Our Nearest
Neighbor During and After the War."
The talk will be, principally, upon
the importance of maintaining friend
ly relations with Canada and the ser
ious strain under which these rela
tions exist at the present time.
Anita Allen Returns Home
Anita Allen, ex-'l7, returned to her
home in Palo Alto yesterday after
noon from Columbia University, in

Francisco defeated the freshmen base
ball team on the varsity diamond Sat
urday by a score of 7 to C. Lifur,

the freshmen secured nine safeties.
