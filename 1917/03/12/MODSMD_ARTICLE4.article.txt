# PASS TWENTY-FIFTH MILESTONE
## Stanford Pauses to Honor Founders and to Look Confidently to Second Lap in History 
### Walter E. Bruns 
Stanford's twenty-fifth Founders' Day celebration could well be entitled
"A Look Backward and A Look Forward." The central feature of the back
ward look would be Chancellor Emeritus David Starr Jordan and his ideas of
liberty and freedom of study. The forward look would center around Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur arid his theories of training for citizemfliip.
Stanford spirit of service and good fellowship predominated in the exer
cises of the day, from the first impressive event of the morning, to the final
affair of jollity and kindly humor that ended the day.
At 9:30 a.m., the usual Saturday stillness of the inner quad was broken

by the rhythmic bent of marching men.

The Reserve Officers' Training Corps,
giving evidence of perfect training,
sent a thrill of patriotic enthusiasm
through every one in the crowd that
had gathered to witness the "Escort
of the Colors" and the dedication of
the flag, when they entered the inner
quad through Memorial Court, headed
by their major, R. A. Griffin, '17.
Flags Are Dedicated
After circuiting the inner quad the
three companies were brought to at
tention before Memorial Church,
while Company 15 advanced to act as
the formal "Escort of the Colors."
Carried by L. C. Stearns, '17, and T. II.
Clausen, '17, the Stars and Stripes
and the blue flag of the corps were
escorted to Memorial Church for the
ceremonies of dedication. Rarely have
ceremonies been more spontaneously
expressive of the spirit of the occas
ion, and of the spirit embodied in the
motto, "Honor, Loyalty, Patriotism,"
inscribed on the blue field of the flag
of the corps. Following the address
of the chaplain of the corps, Rev. D.
Charles Gardner, on the "Meaning of
the Flags," the flags were dedicated.
"The Star-Spangled Banner" was sung
by Miss Edith Harvey, and with the
benediction the participation of the
military in Founders' Day observances
was ended.
Journey to Mausoleum
At 10:45 the seniors gathered at the
southwestern part of the Union
grounds to go through the ceremony
of tree planting which previous classes
have done during Senior Week.
Following the tree-planting cere
monies, the seniors gathered at the
Women's Club House, the women in
cap and gown, for the annual pilgrim
age to the mausoleum. As they left
Memorial Court, led by the Flower
committee, on the journey, two large
Stanford banners, making a beautiful
contrast to the background of blue
sky and white clouds, waved majest
ically from two flagpoles, heralding as
it were the second lap in Stanford's
proud history. At the mausoleum
Class President Ames spoke of the
Stanford spirit as "that unnameable
something that characterizes Stanford
men and Stanford women.' - White
carnations were then placed on the
mausoleum by the Senior Flower com
mittee, Miss Anita Marcus and J. W.
Templeton, while a moving picture
machine made a lasting record of the
ceremony.
Band Renders Concert
At noon the visiting Hoard of Trus
tees, Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the
University of California, and mem
bers of the faculty met at the business
office for lunch. The ceremonies of
the afternoon were started at 1:30
with a concert of five numbers rend
ered by the Stanford Band in Assem
bly Hall. The band, led by Professor
E. W. Martin, played from behind an
array of ferns.
Preceding the speeches of the day
the Stanford Glee Club sang "In
Memoriam," to the air of "The Prin
cess Steps Song." It was composed
