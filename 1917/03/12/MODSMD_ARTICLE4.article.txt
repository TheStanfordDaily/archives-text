# PASS TWENTY-FIFTH MILESTONE
## Stanford Pauses to Honor Founders and to Look Confidently to Second Lap in History 
### Walter E. Bruns 
Stanford's twenty-fifth Founders' Day celebration could well be entitled
"A Look Backward and A Look Forward." The central feature of the back
ward look would be Chancellor Emeritus David Starr Jordan and his ideas of
liberty and freedom of study. The forward look would center around Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur arid his theories of training for citizemfliip.
Stanford spirit of service and good fellowship predominated in the exer
cises of the day, from the first impressive event of the morning, to the final
affair of jollity and kindly humor that ended the day.
At 9:30 a.m., the usual Saturday stillness of the inner quad was broken

by the rhythmic bent of marching men.

The Reserve Officers' Training Corps,
giving evidence of perfect training,
sent a thrill of patriotic enthusiasm
through every one in the crowd that
had gathered to witness the "Escort
of the Colors" and the dedication of
the flag, when they entered the inner
quad through Memorial Court, headed
by their major, R. A. Griffin, '17.
Flags Are Dedicated
After circuiting the inner quad the
three companies were brought to at
tention before Memorial Church,
while Company 15 advanced to act as
the formal "Escort of the Colors."
Carried by L. C. Stearns, '17, and T. II.
Clausen, '17, the Stars and Stripes
and the blue flag of the corps were
escorted to Memorial Church for the
ceremonies of dedication. Rarely have
ceremonies been more spontaneously
expressive of the spirit of the occas
ion, and of the spirit embodied in the
motto, "Honor, Loyalty, Patriotism,"
inscribed on the blue field of the flag
of the corps. Following the address
of the chaplain of the corps, Rev. D.
Charles Gardner, on the "Meaning of
the Flags," the flags were dedicated.
"The Star-Spangled Banner" was sung
by Miss Edith Harvey, and with the
benediction the participation of the
military in Founders' Day observances
was ended.
Journey to Mausoleum
At 10:45 the seniors gathered at the
southwestern part of the Union
grounds to go through the ceremony
of tree planting which previous classes
have done during Senior Week.
Following the tree-planting cere
monies, the seniors gathered at the
Women's Club House, the women in
cap and gown, for the annual pilgrim
age to the mausoleum. As they left
Memorial Court, led by the Flower
committee, on the journey, two large
Stanford banners, making a beautiful
contrast to the background of blue
sky and white clouds, waved majest
ically from two flagpoles, heralding as
it were the second lap in Stanford's
proud history. At the mausoleum
Class President Ames spoke of the
Stanford spirit as "that unnameable
something that characterizes Stanford
men and Stanford women.' - White
carnations were then placed on the
mausoleum by the Senior Flower com
mittee, Miss Anita Marcus and J. W.
Templeton, while a moving picture
machine made a lasting record of the
ceremony.
Band Renders Concert
At noon the visiting Hoard of Trus
tees, Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the
University of California, and mem
bers of the faculty met at the business
office for lunch. The ceremonies of
the afternoon were started at 1:30
with a concert of five numbers rend
ered by the Stanford Band in Assem
bly Hall. The band, led by Professor
E. W. Martin, played from behind an
array of ferns.
Preceding the speeches of the day
the Stanford Glee Club sang "In
Memoriam," to the air of "The Prin
cess Steps Song." It was composed
especially for the occasion by Miss
Doris Estcourt, '17.
Seated in the place of honor, David
Starr Jordan was surrounded on the
platform by President Wilbur, Presi
dent Emeritus John Casper Branner,
j Timothy Hopkins, William Mayo New
hall, Leon Sloss, Percy T. Morgan,
Vanderlynn Stow, F. P. Deering—
Board of Trustees, President Benjamin
Ide Wheeler of the University of Cali
fornia, and Scott Calhoun. The key
j note of Dr. WUbur's opening talk was
j service. Dr. Pranner quoted from a
talk he had many years ago with Mrs.
Stanford, in which he emphasized the
necessity of moral training in college.
Seott Calhoun, a graduate of the class
of '95, devoted his talk almost entirely
to reminiscences of the early days.
Dr. Jordan Principal Speaker.
David Starr Jordan, the principal
speaker of the day, opened his address
I with the remark that he was not
speaking for publication, but intended
j to wander about to his heart's content,
rt was a gala day for one who has lived
through the ups and downs of Stanford
University history, and the Chancellor
dwelled fondly on the events of the
early days. He also took occasion to
speak quite freely on his own views re
garding education and compulsion.
The last speaker of the day was
William Mayo Newhall, president of
the Hoard of Trustees, who took oc
casion to thank President Wilbur and
the faculty for their co-operation with
: the Board of Trustees.
David Starr Jordan Hall.
President Wilbur concluded the,
I speeches of the day with the an- j
nouncement that the Zoology build
| ing would be made the David Starr j
Jordan Hall. The announcement was j
'enthusiastically received by the audi-I
ence. The lettering, Zoology Hall, j
1 will be removed and the new name
; substituted.
i The seventh annual Founders' Day
i Dinner at the Women's Club House
; was a typical gathering of Stanford
: people, 375 strong. The Stanford
I spirit filled the air, as old-timers jol- J
| lied-up with the present generation.
Show Early Stanford Scenes.
The assemblage, after being served
with the most tasty of individual
lunches, was put in the best of humor
for the lantern slides that were to
follow. The scenes included photo
graphs of Mr. and Mrs. Stanford and
Leland Stanford, Junior, early scenes
taken on the grounds and in Palo
Alto, which again and again brought
applause from the grads of '95 and '96.
Charles K. Field, '95, established for
himself a place in the heart of every
one present as a genial toastmaster.
Opening with a poem which he mod
estly confessed to be responsible for,
Charley Field, as one and all referred
to him, seemed to have at his disposal
a never-ending amount of the humor
ous.
Stockton Sends Telegram.
President Wilbur told the visiting 1
alumni of some of the tribulations of
a president. Before introducing Dr.
Stillman, a telegram was read from
the Stanford Club of Stockton, which
had also celebrated Founders' Day.
This was followed by music by Pro
fessor T. A. Larremore on the French
horn, accompanied by Miss Kimball
on the piano,
Dr. Jordan's introduction was hailed
with prolonged applause by the audi
ence. Several of the alumni present
were called on.
Speeches over, what still remained
of Founders' Day was devoted to in
formal dancing. The dinner, the
largest in the history of Stanford
dinners of the sort, made 375 boosters
for next year. Its success, as Mr.
Field said, was due to the power be-1
behind the throne —J. E. McDowell.

Band Renders Concert
At noon the visiting Hoard of Trus
tees, Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the
University of California, and mem
bers of the faculty met at the business
office for lunch. The ceremonies of
the afternoon were started at 1:30
with a concert of five numbers rend
ered by the Stanford Band in Assem
bly Hall. The band, led by Professor
E. W. Martin, played from behind an

dent Emeritus John Casper Branner,
j Timothy Hopkins, William Mayo New
hall, Leon Sloss, Percy T. Morgan,
Vanderlynn Stow, F. P. Deering—
Board of Trustees, President Benjamin
Ide Wheeler of the University of Cali
fornia, and Scott Calhoun. The key
j note of Dr. WUbur's opening talk was
j service. Dr. Pranner quoted from a
talk he had many years ago with Mrs.
Stanford, in which he emphasized the
necessity of moral training in college.
Seott Calhoun, a graduate of the class
of '95, devoted his talk almost entirely
to reminiscences of the early days.
Dr. Jordan Principal Speaker.
David Starr Jordan, the principal
speaker of the day, opened his address
I with the remark that he was not
speaking for publication, but intended
j to wander about to his heart's content,
rt was a gala day for one who has lived
through the ups and downs of Stanford
University history, and the Chancellor
dwelled fondly on the events of the
early days. He also took occasion to
speak quite freely on his own views re
garding education and compulsion.
The last speaker of the day was
William Mayo Newhall, president of
the Hoard of Trustees, who took oc
casion to thank President Wilbur and
the faculty for their co-operation with
: the Board of Trustees.
David Starr Jordan Hall.
President Wilbur concluded the,
I speeches of the day with the an- j
nouncement that the Zoology build
| ing would be made the David Starr j
Jordan Hall. The announcement was j
'enthusiastically received by the audi-I
ence. The lettering, Zoology Hall, j
1 will be removed and the new name
; substituted.
i The seventh annual Founders' Day
i Dinner at the Women's Club House
; was a typical gathering of Stanford
: people, 375 strong. The Stanford
I spirit filled the air, as old-timers jol- J
| lied-up with the present generation.
Show Early Stanford Scenes.
The assemblage, after being served
with the most tasty of individual
lunches, was put in the best of humor
for the lantern slides that were to
follow. The scenes included photo
graphs of Mr. and Mrs. Stanford and
Leland Stanford, Junior, early scenes
taken on the grounds and in Palo
Alto, which again and again brought
applause from the grads of '95 and '96.
Charles K. Field, '95, established for
himself a place in the heart of every
one present as a genial toastmaster.
Opening with a poem which he mod
estly confessed to be responsible for,
Charley Field, as one and all referred
to him, seemed to have at his disposal
a never-ending amount of the humor
ous.
Stockton Sends Telegram.
President Wilbur told the visiting 1
alumni of some of the tribulations of
a president. Before introducing Dr.
Stillman, a telegram was read from
the Stanford Club of Stockton, which
had also celebrated Founders' Day.
This was followed by music by Pro
fessor T. A. Larremore on the French
horn, accompanied by Miss Kimball
on the piano,
Dr. Jordan's introduction was hailed
with prolonged applause by the audi
ence. Several of the alumni present
were called on.
Speeches over, what still remained
of Founders' Day was devoted to in
formal dancing. The dinner, the
largest in the history of Stanford
dinners of the sort, made 375 boosters
for next year. Its success, as Mr.
Field said, was due to the power be-1
behind the throne —J. E. McDowell.
Stanford's twenty-fifth Founders' Day celebration could well be entitled
"A Look Backward and A Look Forward." The central feature of the back
ward look would be Chancellor Emeritus David Starr Jordan and his ideas of
liberty and freedom of study. The forward look would center around Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur arid his theories of training for citizemfliip.
Stanford spirit of service and good fellowship predominated in the exer
cises of the day, from the first impressive event of the morning, to the final
affair of jollity and kindly humor that ended the day.
At 9:30 a.m., the usual Saturday stillness of the inner quad was broken

by the rhythmic bent of marching men.

The Reserve Officers' Training Corps,
giving evidence of perfect training,
sent a thrill of patriotic enthusiasm
through every one in the crowd that
had gathered to witness the "Escort
of the Colors" and the dedication of
the flag, when they entered the inner
quad through Memorial Court, headed
by their major, R. A. Griffin, '17.
Flags Are Dedicated
After circuiting the inner quad the
three companies were brought to at
tention before Memorial Church,
while Company 15 advanced to act as
the formal "Escort of the Colors."
Carried by L. C. Stearns, '17, and T. II.
Clausen, '17, the Stars and Stripes
and the blue flag of the corps were
escorted to Memorial Church for the
ceremonies of dedication. Rarely have
ceremonies been more spontaneously
expressive of the spirit of the occas
ion, and of the spirit embodied in the
motto, "Honor, Loyalty, Patriotism,"
inscribed on the blue field of the flag
of the corps. Following the address
of the chaplain of the corps, Rev. D.
Charles Gardner, on the "Meaning of
the Flags," the flags were dedicated.
"The Star-Spangled Banner" was sung
by Miss Edith Harvey, and with the
benediction the participation of the
military in Founders' Day observances
was ended.
Journey to Mausoleum
At 10:45 the seniors gathered at the
southwestern part of the Union
grounds to go through the ceremony
of tree planting which previous classes
have done during Senior Week.
Following the tree-planting cere
monies, the seniors gathered at the
Women's Club House, the women in
cap and gown, for the annual pilgrim
age to the mausoleum. As they left
Memorial Court, led by the Flower
committee, on the journey, two large
Stanford banners, making a beautiful
contrast to the background of blue
sky and white clouds, waved majest
ically from two flagpoles, heralding as
it were the second lap in Stanford's
proud history. At the mausoleum
Class President Ames spoke of the
Stanford spirit as "that unnameable
something that characterizes Stanford
men and Stanford women.' - White

Show Early Stanford Scenes.
The assemblage, after being served
with the most tasty of individual
lunches, was put in the best of humor
for the lantern slides that were to
follow. The scenes included photo
graphs of Mr. and Mrs. Stanford and
Leland Stanford, Junior, early scenes
taken on the grounds and in Palo
Alto, which again and again brought
applause from the grads of '95 and '96.
Charles K. Field, '95, established for
himself a place in the heart of every
one present as a genial toastmaster.

Stockton Sends Telegram.
President Wilbur told the visiting 1
alumni of some of the tribulations of
a president. Before introducing Dr.
Stillman, a telegram was read from
the Stanford Club of Stockton, which
had also celebrated Founders' Day.
This was followed by music by Pro
fessor T. A. Larremore on the French
horn, accompanied by Miss Kimball
on the piano,
Dr. Jordan's introduction was hailed
with prolonged applause by the audi
ence. Several of the alumni present
were called on.
Speeches over, what still remained
of Founders' Day was devoted to in
formal dancing. The dinner, the
largest in the history of Stanford
dinners of the sort, made 375 boosters
for next year. Its success, as Mr.
Field said, was due to the power be-1
behind the throne —J. E. McDowell.
Stanford's twenty-fifth Founders' Day celebration could well be entitled
"A Look Backward and A Look Forward." The central feature of the back
ward look would be Chancellor Emeritus David Starr Jordan and his ideas of
liberty and freedom of study. The forward look would center around Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur arid his theories of training for citizemfliip.
Stanford spirit of service and good fellowship predominated in the exer
cises of the day, from the first impressive event of the morning, to the final
affair of jollity and kindly humor that ended the day.
At 9:30 a.m., the usual Saturday stillness of the inner quad was broken

by the rhythmic bent of marching men.

The Reserve Officers' Training Corps,
giving evidence of perfect training,
sent a thrill of patriotic enthusiasm
through every one in the crowd that
had gathered to witness the "Escort
of the Colors" and the dedication of
the flag, when they entered the inner
quad through Memorial Court, headed
by their major, R. A. Griffin, '17.
Flags Are Dedicated
After circuiting the inner quad the
three companies were brought to at
tention before Memorial Church,
while Company 15 advanced to act as
the formal "Escort of the Colors."
Carried by L. C. Stearns, '17, and T. II.
Clausen, '17, the Stars and Stripes
and the blue flag of the corps were
escorted to Memorial Church for the
ceremonies of dedication. Rarely have
ceremonies been more spontaneously
expressive of the spirit of the occas
ion, and of the spirit embodied in the
motto, "Honor, Loyalty, Patriotism,"
inscribed on the blue field of the flag
of the corps. Following the address
of the chaplain of the corps, Rev. D.
Charles Gardner, on the "Meaning of
the Flags," the flags were dedicated.
"The Star-Spangled Banner" was sung
by Miss Edith Harvey, and with the
benediction the participation of the
military in Founders' Day observances
was ended.
Journey to Mausoleum
At 10:45 the seniors gathered at the
southwestern part of the Union
grounds to go through the ceremony
of tree planting which previous classes
have done during Senior Week.
Following the tree-planting cere
monies, the seniors gathered at the
Women's Club House, the women in
cap and gown, for the annual pilgrim
age to the mausoleum. As they left
Memorial Court, led by the Flower
committee, on the journey, two large
Stanford banners, making a beautiful
contrast to the background of blue
sky and white clouds, waved majest
ically from two flagpoles, heralding as
it were the second lap in Stanford's
proud history. At the mausoleum
Class President Ames spoke of the
Stanford spirit as "that unnameable
something that characterizes Stanford
men and Stanford women.' - White
carnations were then placed on the
mausoleum by the Senior Flower com
mittee, Miss Anita Marcus and J. W.
Templeton, while a moving picture
machine made a lasting record of the
ceremony.
Band Renders Concert
At noon the visiting Hoard of Trus
tees, Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the
University of California, and mem
bers of the faculty met at the business
office for lunch. The ceremonies of
the afternoon were started at 1:30

ered by the Stanford Band in Assem
bly Hall. The band, led by Professor
E. W. Martin, played from behind an
array of ferns.
Preceding the speeches of the day
the Stanford Glee Club sang "In
Memoriam," to the air of "The Prin
cess Steps Song." It was composed
especially for the occasion by Miss
Doris Estcourt, '17.
Seated in the place of honor, David
Starr Jordan was surrounded on the
platform by President Wilbur, Presi
dent Emeritus John Casper Branner,
j Timothy Hopkins, William Mayo New
hall, Leon Sloss, Percy T. Morgan,
Vanderlynn Stow, F. P. Deering—
Board of Trustees, President Benjamin
Ide Wheeler of the University of Cali
fornia, and Scott Calhoun. The key
j note of Dr. WUbur's opening talk was
j service. Dr. Pranner quoted from a
talk he had many years ago with Mrs.
Stanford, in which he emphasized the
necessity of moral training in college.
Seott Calhoun, a graduate of the class
of '95, devoted his talk almost entirely
to reminiscences of the early days.
Dr. Jordan Principal Speaker.
David Starr Jordan, the principal
speaker of the day, opened his address
I with the remark that he was not
speaking for publication, but intended
j to wander about to his heart's content,
rt was a gala day for one who has lived
through the ups and downs of Stanford
University history, and the Chancellor
dwelled fondly on the events of the
early days. He also took occasion to
speak quite freely on his own views re
garding education and compulsion.
The last speaker of the day was
William Mayo Newhall, president of
the Hoard of Trustees, who took oc
casion to thank President Wilbur and
the faculty for their co-operation with
: the Board of Trustees.

while Company 15 advanced to act as
the formal "Escort of the Colors."
Carried by L. C. Stearns, '17, and T. II.
Clausen, '17, the Stars and Stripes
and the blue flag of the corps were
escorted to Memorial Church for the
ceremonies of dedication. Rarely have
ceremonies been more spontaneously
expressive of the spirit of the occas
ion, and of the spirit embodied in the
motto, "Honor, Loyalty, Patriotism,"
inscribed on the blue field of the flag
of the corps. Following the address
of the chaplain of the corps, Rev. D.
Charles Gardner, on the "Meaning of
the Flags," the flags were dedicated.
"The Star-Spangled Banner" was sung
by Miss Edith Harvey, and with the
benediction the participation of the
military in Founders' Day observances
was ended.
Journey to Mausoleum
At 10:45 the seniors gathered at the
southwestern part of the Union
grounds to go through the ceremony
of tree planting which previous classes
have done during Senior Week.
Following the tree-planting cere
monies, the seniors gathered at the
Women's Club House, the women in
cap and gown, for the annual pilgrim
age to the mausoleum. As they left
Memorial Court, led by the Flower
committee, on the journey, two large
Stanford banners, making a beautiful
contrast to the background of blue
sky and white clouds, waved majest
ically from two flagpoles, heralding as
it were the second lap in Stanford's
proud history. At the mausoleum
Class President Ames spoke of the
Stanford spirit as "that unnameable
something that characterizes Stanford
men and Stanford women.' - White
carnations were then placed on the
mausoleum by the Senior Flower com
mittee, Miss Anita Marcus and J. W.
Templeton, while a moving picture
machine made a lasting record of the
ceremony.
Band Renders Concert
At noon the visiting Hoard of Trus
tees, Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the
University of California, and mem
bers of the faculty met at the business
office for lunch. The ceremonies of
the afternoon were started at 1:30
with a concert of five numbers rend
ered by the Stanford Band in Assem
bly Hall. The band, led by Professor
E. W. Martin, played from behind an
array of ferns.
Preceding the speeches of the day
the Stanford Glee Club sang "In
Memoriam," to the air of "The Prin
cess Steps Song." It was composed
especially for the occasion by Miss
Doris Estcourt, '17.

j Timothy Hopkins, William Mayo New
hall, Leon Sloss, Percy T. Morgan,
Vanderlynn Stow, F. P. Deering—
Board of Trustees, President Benjamin
Ide Wheeler of the University of Cali
fornia, and Scott Calhoun. The key
j note of Dr. WUbur's opening talk was
j service. Dr. Pranner quoted from a
talk he had many years ago with Mrs.
Stanford, in which he emphasized the
necessity of moral training in college.
Seott Calhoun, a graduate of the class
of '95, devoted his talk almost entirely
to reminiscences of the early days.
Dr. Jordan Principal Speaker.
David Starr Jordan, the principal
speaker of the day, opened his address
I with the remark that he was not
speaking for publication, but intended
j to wander about to his heart's content,
rt was a gala day for one who has lived
through the ups and downs of Stanford
University history, and the Chancellor
dwelled fondly on the events of the
early days. He also took occasion to
speak quite freely on his own views re
garding education and compulsion.
The last speaker of the day was
William Mayo Newhall, president of
the Hoard of Trustees, who took oc
casion to thank President Wilbur and
the faculty for their co-operation with
: the Board of Trustees.
David Starr Jordan Hall.
President Wilbur concluded the,
I speeches of the day with the an- j
nouncement that the Zoology build
| ing would be made the David Starr j
Jordan Hall. The announcement was j
'enthusiastically received by the audi-I
ence. The lettering, Zoology Hall, j
1 will be removed and the new name
; substituted.
i The seventh annual Founders' Day
i Dinner at the Women's Club House
; was a typical gathering of Stanford
: people, 375 strong. The Stanford
I spirit filled the air, as old-timers jol- J
| lied-up with the present generation.
Show Early Stanford Scenes.
The assemblage, after being served
with the most tasty of individual
lunches, was put in the best of humor
for the lantern slides that were to
follow. The scenes included photo
graphs of Mr. and Mrs. Stanford and
Leland Stanford, Junior, early scenes
taken on the grounds and in Palo
Alto, which again and again brought
applause from the grads of '95 and '96.
Charles K. Field, '95, established for
himself a place in the heart of every
one present as a genial toastmaster.
Opening with a poem which he mod
estly confessed to be responsible for,
Charley Field, as one and all referred
to him, seemed to have at his disposal
a never-ending amount of the humor
ous.
Stockton Sends Telegram.
President Wilbur told the visiting 1
alumni of some of the tribulations of
a president. Before introducing Dr.
Stillman, a telegram was read from
the Stanford Club of Stockton, which
had also celebrated Founders' Day.
This was followed by music by Pro
fessor T. A. Larremore on the French
horn, accompanied by Miss Kimball
on the piano,
Dr. Jordan's introduction was hailed
with prolonged applause by the audi
ence. Several of the alumni present
were called on.
Speeches over, what still remained
of Founders' Day was devoted to in
formal dancing. The dinner, the
largest in the history of Stanford
dinners of the sort, made 375 boosters
for next year. Its success, as Mr.
Field said, was due to the power be-1
behind the throne —J. E. McDowell.
Stanford's twenty-fifth Founders' Day celebration could well be entitled
"A Look Backward and A Look Forward." The central feature of the back
ward look would be Chancellor Emeritus David Starr Jordan and his ideas of
liberty and freedom of study. The forward look would center around Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur arid his theories of training for citizemfliip.
Stanford spirit of service and good fellowship predominated in the exer
cises of the day, from the first impressive event of the morning, to the final
affair of jollity and kindly humor that ended the day.
At 9:30 a.m., the usual Saturday stillness of the inner quad was broken

by the rhythmic bent of marching men.

The Reserve Officers' Training Corps,
giving evidence of perfect training,
sent a thrill of patriotic enthusiasm
through every one in the crowd that
had gathered to witness the "Escort
of the Colors" and the dedication of
the flag, when they entered the inner
quad through Memorial Court, headed
by their major, R. A. Griffin, '17.
Flags Are Dedicated
After circuiting the inner quad the
three companies were brought to at
tention before Memorial Church,
while Company 15 advanced to act as
the formal "Escort of the Colors."
Carried by L. C. Stearns, '17, and T. II.
