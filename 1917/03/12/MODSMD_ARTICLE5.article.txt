## 
### 
Stanford's duty is to turn out citi
zens trained to serve the country and
the community, according to President
Ray Lyman Wilbur, in his opening
Founders' Day talk. The President
told his audience the University must
not fear criticism.
Speaking of the faculty members, he
outlined their dutios at Stanford as
follows:
"Just as we contributed fundamen
tally to the physical union of our state
with those east of us, so must we,
guardians of the minds of two thous
and young, vigorous, noble-minded
Americans, see that they ripen into
contributing citizens, deeply loyal to
our country and ready to serve it.
Must Dare to Chance.
"Not to dare to make intellectual
ventures is to feel the blight of de
feat before the battle begins. Tradi
tion that is not support for progress
and action becomes an obstacle and
a clog. No sound tradition need fear
the challenge Is this the best we can
do?' A university should not have to
scrape off annoying relies and attach
ments of the past the way a whale
does the barnacles from its irritated
body.
"A university should be as up to
date each year as the last dreadnought,
firm of fiber and sure of line, with the
useless and the faulty rejected, but
with all the gains of the past welded
into its being. The university is a
great instrument of society for the
sharpening of the intellects of the most
hopeful*youth of the land. Upon the
human intellect, the brain in the body,
rests every possibility for progress,
and even for the retention of the in
tellectual stores already gathered.
Our Aim sit Stanford.
"Our aim at Stanford is to turn out
trained men and women with service
able healthy brains and bodies, ready
to use them in the service of the
world. We limit our efforts to certain
chosen groups. We have no time to
waste upon those who lack the vision,
those who are mere self-seekers. The
Stanford plan is to prepare men and
women for a participating part in the
development of our great democracy
in which we see the hope of the ages."
