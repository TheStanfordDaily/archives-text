# Wilson Greatest Peace Man
## 
### 
"President Wilson is the world's
greatest champion of peace today,"
said Chancellor Emeritus David Starr
Jordan, last night, speaking on "The
Present Crisis" at Encina Hall. "In
my opinion, every move that the presi
dent has made during the present war
has been the wisest possible. The er
rors that he has made in his Mexi
can policy he has freely admitted. It
takes a big man to do this."
