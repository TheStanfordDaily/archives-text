# CHANCELLOR MAKES PLEA FOR FREEDOM
## 
### 
Freedom of study and liberty of
thought was the plea of Chancellor
Emeritus David Starr Jordan in his

Founders' Day
speech. Dr. Jor
dan was the
principal speak
er of the after
noon program.
lie retraced
the early devel
opment of Stan
ford University,
and told how
t. li e Faunders
sought above all

ternoon program.
He retraced the early developments
>112 Stanford University, and told how
he Founders sought above all to have
is few restrictions as possible, and
o imported traditions to hamper
scholastic development.
Dr. Jordan said, in part:
"In the first place, a university con
ists in personal contact, the contact
of younger scholars with older schol
ars, with investigators, who go a little
arther, a little deeper, into every
thing. A great teacher always makes
a mark on anyone with whom he gets
into contact.
Suit Work to Student.
"I do not believe in requiring any
two students to take up the same work.
That was the idea in dividing the Uni
versity up into major departments.
There is a tendency of the faculty to
make up the courses first and make
the students fit them. If that is kept
ap I shall turn over in my grave, but
wait until I get there first. Peda
gogical laziness of the professor is the
;'ause of a ready-made course.
"The course should fit the actual
needs of the individual student. The
najor professor system is primarily
to bring students in line with the pro
fessor who has made a success in that
department, because advanced knowl
edge means thorough knowledge.
There is not much value in elementary
knowledge. Humboldt made a spec
:alty of knowing the relations of every
thing to everything else. His scholar
ship led toward a large ambition.
i'raiiii To Create.
"We did not believe in those days in
drilling students so that they would
av things to get their words all
straight, but to create things. Col
leges can serve lis when their pur
>ose is not to drill, but to create.
"1 don't believe in the value of dis
cipline enforced from the outside, so
hat students will obey outside orders.
It is from within that orders ought to
come. Unless a student develops in
such a way it is of no use."
