# LARGE CROWD SEES BOXING TOURNAMENT
## FOUR NEW CHAMPIONS Wheatley, Pedley, Murphy, Flint, and Marston Win Final Bouts in Gym 
### 
FOUR new boxing champions were
crowned last night, at the annual
University championship tourna
ment, Flint, the lightweight, being
the only man to retain his. title.
Wheatly won in the heavy weight class,
Pedley is the new middleweight
champion and Murphy and Marston
now hold the welterweight and feath
erweight titles respectively.
Large Crowd Out.
A large crowd was out and good
sportsmanship was exhibited through
out the evening by both the fighters
and spectators. H. W. Maloney ref
ereed and judged the bouts and his
decisions, with few exceptions, were
well taken.
The best bout of the evening was
that between Murphy and Wass, the
welterweights. Both of these men
were very fast and experienced boxers
and the result was an extremely good
go. Murphy had a little the edge and
was given the decision. Later in the
evening, Murphy won a close decis
ion over Stewart and clinched the di
vision championship, as Sullivan, for-
mer champion, could not the
weight.
Pedley and Bacon, middleweights,
had to fight an extra round before a
decision could be made, which when
made was in favor of Pedley. The
winner was very aggressive and both
men took a lot of punishment. Ped
ley later had little trouble disposing
of Vietor and capturing the middle
weight title, as Lytle, the former
champion, was not out to defend it.
In the heavyweight class, Wheatlv
and Bowling were well matched.
Wheatly's long reach allowed him to
slip in many points, but Bowling had
his opponent staggering and clinch
ing the last two rounds. A howl of
protest went up when Mr. Maloney
awarded the match to Wheatly.
Emery stepped into one of Mc-
Nulty's gloves, headed in his direc
tion, in the second round, and al
though game to continue the bout
after an application of water, the
referee gave the match to McNulty.
Wheatly and McNulty had a good
fight in the finals for the heavy
weight honors, but Wheatly won on
points, despite the fact that he was
damaged somewhat by bis opponent's
rushes.
In the featherweight divisions,
Witherbee took a questionable decis
j ion from Aguirre, while Marston put
i Britt into such a condition that he
was awarded the bout in the middle
of the third round. Then Witherbee
and Marston got together, and the lat
ter won without very much trouble.
Flint won a poor match from Smith,
the only other lightweight aspirant,
1 and retained his title in that class.
According to Mr. Maloney, this
morning, the tournament last night
was the best exhibition of clean, sci
entific boxing ever seen at Stanford.
IHe is confident that a victory over
the men from California will be the
result of the intercollegiate meet
March 26, at Berkeley.
The men who will box against Cali
fornia were picked from the showings
made last night. Britt, the bantam,
who fought in the featherweight class
for experience, last night, will fight
the California bantam. Marston will
be the featherweight in the ring, and
Flint will represent Stanford in the
lightweight class. There is a choice
of Wass, Stewart and Sullivan in the
welterweight division, as Murphy, the
University champion, is a freshman.
Pedley is the middleweight selected,
Wheatly will fight in the light-heavy
class if there is one, and in such a
case McNulty will box the heavy
weight from California; otherwise
Wheatly will box in the heavyweight
class. Maloney will spend all /his
time with these men between now and
the California meet.
