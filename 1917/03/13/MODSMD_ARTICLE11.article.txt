# First Letters From France Received
## Stanford Ambulance Men Tell of Dangers Encountered on Ocean Voyage 
### 
First letters from the men in the
Stanford Unit of the American Am
bulance Corps in France reached the
campus last night. The French ship
"Espagne" arrived at its destination
last month, when a cablegram was
sent to America. According to the
messages the "jitney drivers" were
prepared at all times to "take to the
life boats" in case of submarine at
tack.
Sailing of the ship from New York
was postponed four days because of
the refusal of the coal loaders to work
in the extreme cold. When they
finally did depart, the results of four
•'last nights" in the big city were too
much for the men, and according to
the letters received, they were glad to
' leave. . i
Following are extracts from some
of the letters received:
"En Route to Paris, on Board S. S.
Espagne, February 16, 1917.
"Dear Fellows: We went to a per
formance of the Century Girl in New
j York. • After the show we went up-
I stairs to the Cocoanut Grove, where
j Gertie Hoffman is putting on a show,
and being from the country we en
joyed every minute of it.
"We were the guests of the Harvard
Club, and some of the fellows, on
making a feeble stab at paying for
the drinks they ordered, were told
that their money couldn't be accepted
—that orders had been given to let j
them have unlimited credit.
"After many postponements of sail
ing dates, we finally did pull out of
New York, and at that time were
pretty well convinced that war would
be declared before we reached Bor
deaux. However, if one mentions
submarines, they just laugh and
whistle. . . .
"But yesterday we had a snappy
lifeboat drill. The bell rings, the pas
sengers banister downstairs for their
life-preservers; then up to their as
signed lifeboat, full of excitement and
puffed out with canvas and cork.
"This is no boast, but of the twenty
one members of the unit, only four
were up for luncheon today, and at
the close of the meal I was surprised
to find myself the sole remaining jit
ney driver. . . .
"It is barely possible that we will
drive our ambulances from Bordeaux
to Paris. It would be mighty fine
practice for most of us. .. . While
in Paris, we will stop at the Rue Ray
nouard, at No. 21—and if at any time
letters are sent there they will reach
us."
"S. S. Espagne, 450 miles off Bor
deaux :
"Dear —.
"None of the crew or officers speak
much English, and we had a hard time
at first—used the sign language prin
cipally.
"Walt and I nearly got putin irons
yesterday because we took a picture
of the gunners loading up the four
inch gun on back. They cussed us
freely, but it's a horse on 'em, be
cause we didn't understand a word.
"We are now pretty well into the
danger zone, and everyone is pretty
nervous, for we are the first ship to
go through since the Kaiser sent out
his new warning.
"We had several lifeboat drills and
all yesterday and last night the life
boats were swung out over the water
and rope ladders were let down all
around the ship. Most of our cabins
are right on the water-line, where
the torpedoes bump—so last night,
Bill Losh, Walt Snook, and I slept on
our life belts on the top deck, just
in reach of our boat, and every time
somebody slammed a window, down
stairs, we were right on our toes."
After arriving in Paris the men
spend one month assembling and
learning the different parts of their
ambulances, before going to the front.
