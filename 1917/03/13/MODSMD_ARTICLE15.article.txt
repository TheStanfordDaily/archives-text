### 
STANFORD varsity will meet the
St. Ignatius baseball tossers to
morrow afternoon on the local
diamond. The game is scheduled for
4:15, season tickets of twenty-five
cents admitting spectators. Captain
"Doc" Hayes expects the contest to be
a close one, as the Catholic college
nine has a good record this season.
Draper May Pitch.
The varsity will take the diamond
in the same order that they played
against Santa Clara on Saturday, ex
cept that Wilcox may catch, Camp
bell's finger not. being entirely well
as yet. Either Hoever or Draper will
pitch, the choice probably falling on
the latter, as lioever is expected to
hurl against Santa Clara next Satur
day.
St. Ignatius has practically the
same team as the nine that opposed
Stanford last season and will give the
Cardinal a hard battle. The game
will last but seven innings.
