# A
						QUESTION OF TEMPO
## 
### 
Our execution of "Hail, Stanford, Hail," has, from time to
time, met with considerable criticism â€”mostly adverse. It seems im
possible to please everybody, since everybody is not pleased even
yet. It has also proved difficult to hit upon a universal tempo. The
Glee Club sings the hymn much faster than does the student body,
and with more spirit. Perhaps it is a matter of taste, after all, but
we are inclined to think that the club has made the better judgment.
A stranger, listening to the rendition of "Ilail, Stanford, Hail,"
after an assembly, might be justified in mistaking it for a funeral
dirge, so slowly and mournfully is it sung. The psychological effect
of slow music is exceedingly dampening, and we have fooled ourselves
into thinking that the hymn was meant to be sung that way. Not
a bit of it! A faster, more swinging tempo would be twice as effec
tive, and not at all less appropriate. Why not try this one more
change, and see if the happy medium will not be struck at, last?
