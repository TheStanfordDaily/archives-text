# Dramatic Novelty in French Plays
## Gordon Davis to Have Only English Partâ€”All the Rest in French 
### 
An absolute novelty in campus dra
matics in the present college genera
tion will be offered in the Little The
ater, Friday evening, when Le Cercle
Francais will present two one-act
plays entirely in French. A number
of years ago a play in French was
produced in the Assembly Hall and
proved a decided success, and judging
from the sale of the tickets, limited
to three hundred in number, the Little
Theater production will also prove
successful.
The statement that these plays are
entirely in French should be modi
fied. There is one English part in
them. Gordon Davis, '18, who inter
preted Falder in "Justice," last Fri
day night, will take the part of Hog
son, the typical Englishman, travel
ing in France, in "L'Anglais tel Qu-on
le parle," by Tristan Bernard. Other
principal male parts in this farce will
be handled by Instructor Gabriel
Henri Grojean, and Assistant Profes
sor S. A. Smith of the French depart-
went Miss Tliurlyne Buffum, '18, will
impersonate Betty, the young lady
from England.
J. A. Sellards of the French depart
ment faculty, J. C. Cross, '17, and
Miss Germaine Levy, '17, have prin
cipal parts in the other one-act play,
"Le Frere Aine," by Alphonse Daudet.
Rehearsals for both plays are pro
gressing rapidly.
Less than a dozen tickets remain
on sale at the Bookstore and at Wein
gartner's, in Palo Alto.
