# Physiological Club Will Entertain at Jolly-Up
## 
### 
Physiological Club will entertain
the department at a jolly-up, on Fri
day evening next, March 16, at the
Women's Club House. That the club
is planning to make this event the
livest jolly-up the department has
had, is the announcement of the com
mittee in charge. Snappy music is
scheduled for the dancing, and stunts
are being arranged, the crowning one
of which will be some real "Great
Alexander" mystery stuff. L. A. Jaco
by, '20, will be bound, and locked up
in a trunk, and he agrees to be out
in thirty seconds. The majors of the
department, Pre-Medical and Medical
students are invited.
