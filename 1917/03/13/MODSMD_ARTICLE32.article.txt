# Petition Legislature to Continue Bird Protection
## 
### 
More than one hundred signatures
have been secured on the petition to
be sent to the state legislature oppos
ing a bill which will take the restric
tions from killing certain kinds of
birds of California. At present laws
prevent killing of birds which de
stroy insects, but a new bill is now
up in the assembly to repeal these
laws on the grounds that the birds
eat crops.
The local petition originated in the
Zoology department, and has been
signed by practically all members of
the faculty there and students, as well
as many others. A similar petition is
now being circulated in Palo Alto.
