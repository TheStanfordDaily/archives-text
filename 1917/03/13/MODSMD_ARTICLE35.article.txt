# Double Plays
## 
### 
For the first time since the initial
contest with St. Mary's, the Stanford
varsity baseball squad is showing real
form on the diamond. The game with
the University of Santa Clara last
Saturday was a good exhibition, and
demonstrated that Stanford is the
equal of the strong Catholic college
nine. The contest lasted fourteen in
nings, and the Cardinal were the ag
gressors throughout, although in
many tight places.

Mattei pitched a wonderful game
against the Mission Town team. He
grew stronger as the game progressed
and proved that he is capable of hurl
ing winning baseball in an intercol
legiate contest. It looks now as
though Hoover, Mattei and Draper
will all be used against California in
the Big Games.

Every man in the infield pulled sen
sational plays against the Santa Clara
aggregation. Stevens saved the game
twice with feature stops on third, and
Cowan, Braden and Hayes all fielded
in ex6*pllent form, although errors
were chalked up against them.

Lilly and Dickey played good bail
in the outfield, both making running
catches.

The second game between Stanford
and Santa Clara, next Saturday, on
the Cardinal lot, should bring out the
record crowd of the season. Both
teams are now playing mid-season ball
and are evenly matched, as shown Py
the contest last Saturday.
