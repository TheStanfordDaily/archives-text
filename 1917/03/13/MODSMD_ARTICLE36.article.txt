## 
### 
Only one Cardinal soccer team will
make the trip to Saratoga to play at
the annual Blossom Festival there,
next Saturday, instead of two, as had

meet here, Saturday, not all the men
could go, so he has arranged for a
team to go down to Saratoga from
San Francisco to furnish competition
for one Stanford team. The team to
make the trip will be picked at prac
tice Thursday afternoon.
