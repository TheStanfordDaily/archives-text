# 1917 CLASS TO PRESENT GOOD COMEDY
## PICKS "A FULL HOUSE" Fred Jackson's Greatest Drama Secured for Production on May 16 
### 
A FULL HOUSE," a laugh-in-
A% spiring comedy 111 three acts,
by Fred Jackson, the noted
novelist and playwright, has been se
lected for the annual Senior Farce,
which is to be given May l(i. This
selection was made by the committee
after it had investigated thoroughly
every drama at the disposal of the
American Play Company and Sanger
& Jordan, for amateur theatricals.
S«tii(» in Apartment.
The scene of the play, which met
immediate success at its first night
011 May 10, 1915, at the Longacre The
ater, New York City, is laid in a lux
uriously furnished apartment of a
wealthy New York family. Complica
tions arising between the man and his
ife follow each other in swift suc-
cession until the denouement. The
lines of the various characters sparkle
with wit, and in conjunction with the
comedy situation in which the char
acters are placed, form a farce that
delighted the blase tired-out business
men of the metropolis for a long run.
May Vokes, the celebrated comedi
enne, and Herbert Corthell, who re
cently appeared in the San Francisco
production of "Canary Cottage," orig
inally played the two leading roles
in the play.
The committee in charge of the
Senior Farce arrangements is com
posed of F. K. Murray, chairman;
J. C. Cross, J. D. McLachlan, F. R.
Johnston, Nellita Choate, Edith Har
vey, Mary Flowers. This committee
has announced that tryouts will take
place as soon as the manuscript of
the play arrives at Stanford. This is
expected to be within two weeks.
Frank L. Mathieu, who has coached
many Stanford productions on the
past, will again serve in that capacity.
The play provides roles for seven
men and five women, each of whom
has some good lines.
"A Full House," coming as a com
edy antidote to the serious production
of "Justice," will undoubtedly pro
vide amusement for a large audience,
as this will be the first time the drama
has ever been produced as far west
as Stanford.
