A PREPAREDNESS survey, which
will bring to light just what re
sources Stanford can offer to the
government in ease of war or other
national emergency, is to be made
immediately, according to an an
nouncement made by President Wil
bur today. Ten thousand letters, ac
companied by cards to be filled in and
returned, are to be sent out, each stu
dent, alumni, and member of the fac
ulty receiving one. This work is to
be done under the supervision of
Alumni Secretary J. E. McDowell, as
sistant registrar.

Complete information as to the abil
ities of each Stanford man and woman
for service in time of war, whether
along military or along scientific, pro
fessional, technical, trade, business or
other lines, will be gained by this
survey. Cards will ask specifically,
"Will you accept enrollment for duty
in emergency?" but all cards must be
returned filled out, whether the recip
ient wishes to volunteer or not.

general questions to be filled out by
alumni, outlining their activities since
graduation, and furnishing additional

placed on file at the registrar's office.
The cards and the information they
contain are exclusively for the use
