# Interclass Track Meet Saturday
## 
### 
Seniors are doped to win the inter
class track meet, scheduled for Satur
day, but freshmen tracksters are
showing up exceptionally well, and the
sophomores, with House, Rogers,
Floete and Wilcox, look well enough
to give the seniors real competition.
Last Saturday was the first meet in
which times could be secured for the
full distances, and predictions must
be based on this one meet.
The 880 yard and mile events, with
Schnell and Aupperle, respectively,
ought to fall in the senior column.
Chapman is expected to win the two
mile for the juniors. Samis and Col
glazier of the freshmen will make a
strong bid for the mile, and Wilke is
counted on to make Schnell go his
best in the half.
The seniors are very strong in the
field events, with Gillespie and Murray

in the hammer throw, Lachmund and
Wheatly in the jumps, and "Mutt"
Templeton in the pole vault. Caughey
will take five points for the juniors in
the shot put.
Weaver, of the first year men, is ex
pected to place in the high jump, and
might win it for his class, as he tied
Templeton and Lynn for first at G feet,
last Saturday. Wilcox, the sophomore
pole vaulter, has been making 11' 6",
and with Greve will fight it out for
this event.
In the short distances the freshmen
have a promising bunch of entries, but
House can be depended on to win the
100 yard dash for the sophomores,
despite the way Wells, Dinkelspiel,
Davis and Needham have been burning
up the track this season. House
should take the hurdles for the nine
