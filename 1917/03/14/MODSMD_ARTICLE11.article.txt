# ORCHESTRA PLEASES IN CONCERT
## 
### 
Palo Alto Symphony Orchestra gave
the second concert of their third sea
son in the Assembly Hall last night,
under the direction of J. E. Kimber,
'17. Five well selected numbers of
the more popular type of classical
music made up the program. Consid
ering the fact that the members of the
orchestra are all amateur musicians,
and that their membership is some
what shifting, the concert last night
was very much to the credit of the
conductor and his musicians.
Mozart's "Don Juan" overture and

the Beethoven Adagio, the first two
numbers of the program, were the
least effective, the playing lacking
unanimity and force. With the third
number, the orchestra seemed to gain
confidence, and their playing of the
"Peer Gynt" Suite No. 1, was the best
received number of the program.
Kimber's orchestration of "Greeting to
Gade," by Schumann, was also well
rendered.
The concert was closed by the "Star
Spangled Banner," in which the or
chestra was assisted by the Stanford
Band.
