# Freshmen to Play San Jose High Nine
## Will Meet on Varsity Diamond Tomorrow Afternoon at Four-Fifteen 
### 
Stanford freshmen and the San Jose
high school baseball team will meet
tomorrow afternoon on the varsity
diamond, if fair weather prevails.
The game may be shifted to the fac
ulty lot, but it is expected that the
varsity will take their practice earlier
than usual and give the main diamond
to the freshmen. If this is the case,
season tickets or twenty-five cents
will be required for admission.
San Jose High and the 1920 aggre
gation have played two games this
season. The freshmen won the first
contest at Stanford by a 1 to 0 score,
only to lose by the same count on the
Garden City pasture. The Prune
Pickers have had the best high school
baseball team in the northern part of
the state for the past three years, and
promise to give the babes a battle
tomorrow in the rubber game.
Bill Paul will pitch his last game for
San Jose against the freshmen. He
has been signed up by Harry Wolver
ton of the San Francisco Seals, and
will report this week. He is an ex
cellent pitcher, and a heavy hitter.
There are several other crack ball
tossers 011 the opposing nine.
Coach Lander will place the fresh
men in about the same order they
have taken for the past few games.
Lifur or Morse will pitch, Joerg will
catch, Pike will be stationed at first,
Abrahms on second, Elliott at third,
and Galloway on short. Wayland,
Cass, Howes, Noyes and Knox will
play in the outfield. Hunter, who has
been out with a bad finger, may get
in at second.
