# BENEFITS AND BURDENS
## 
### 
During the present semester, a great many men have had the
benefit of entertainments given by the Union—many more than have
helped to support the institution. These functions have been given in
an effort to make the Union more a center of University life, and
they have to a great extent succeeded in accomplishing this. It
seems essential, however, that the burden of making the club a suc
cess should be more equitably distributed. This distribution cannot
be effected by leaving the men to their own devices. There are always
the same few who will pay membership dues.
The Union, it can not be doubted, has or should have an estab
lished position on the campus. True, it has more value to certain
men than to others, but for those who get little benefit from it now
it could be made to mean more with greater resources. If we were
all members, the increased resources would be secured. Aside from
running expenses, a sinking fund must be gathered to replace furni
ture and repair the building. At present it is impossible to lay
aside anything for this fund, —which means that sooner or later the
Union must either be abandoned, or some radical change made in its
administration. The latter is the more pleasant to contemplate.
As to that change, we believe the only adequate arrangement
would be to collect through the business office, a small membership
fee from all men. Although the idea of compulsion was foreign to
those instrumental in establishing the Union, it seems to us the best
solution, believing as we do that membership in the club can be
made worth while for all. At present the fee is two dollars, and
with the enrollment, for the semester the income is less than half what
it would be for fifteen hundred men at one dollar. Fifteen hundred
dollars a semester would put the Union on its feet financially, and
universal membership would insure its social success. Insofar as
this change might detract from the spontaneous character of the club,
it would, of course, be unfortunate, but that is an intanglible con
sideration, while the existence or non-existence of the Union is a
problem of pressing importance, and must be considered first. This
we believe to be the only effective means of solution.
