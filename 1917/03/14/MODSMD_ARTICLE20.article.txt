Landscape—Two frosli, standing
near llie Inn, looking thoughtfully to
ward May field and at the little con
struction shack where the new Jewell
Library will go. In reality they are
not thinking at all; they just think

One Frosh—'Lo, Frosh.
Tother Frosh —'Lo, yourself. Wliat

O. F. —Nothing, as usual.
T. O. —Say, what's that dinky build

O. F. —Boob! That's the new Jewell
Library.
T. O. —What do they call it after him
for; he's not dead yet, is he?
O. F.—Naw, and he's only a ser
geant, at that.
T. 0. —Isn't even almost dead, is he?
O. F. —Can't never sometimes tell.
We might go to war tomorrow.
T. O. —Well, say, that's insubordina

it after the major—Bugge-house, or
something like that?
O. F. —Sure! Anything but Jewell
Library. He's too good a gent to be
stuck with anything like that. Let's

library will be called Jewel Library

out your thinking—it's out of place
around here.
