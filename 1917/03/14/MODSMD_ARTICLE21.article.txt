Stanford varsity looks better every
day. The main reason for the im
provement in the showing of the squad
is the competition for positions on the
team. Lilly is probably the only
player, besides Skipper Hayes, that
has his position cinched, and even the
stocky centerfielder cannot afford to
loaf on the job.
* * * * *
Hoever, Mattei and Draper are hav
ing a nice fight for the pitching hon
ors. Right now it would be hard to
guess which heaver will start against
California. Campbell has been having
it all his own way behind the plate,
but Wilcox made a remarkable show
ing at Santa Clara. Stevens, Reagon,
Cowan, Braden and Shriver are all
excellent ball players, and it is hard
to determine just who will make the
final infield. Dickey, Wilkins, Noonan,
Bihlman and Mitchell are all making
a fight for two outfield berths.
Shriver is fast getting back into
condition. He will probably be ready
to play in a few days, but it is doubt
ful if he will be on hand to start
against the Blue and Gold.

Campbell's injured finger is better
now, and the big catcher is ready for
work again.
