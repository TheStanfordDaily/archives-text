# May 1 Last Day to Obtain Profit Slips
## 
### 
Several profit sharing certificates
have been turned in with slips from
the registrar at the Stanford Book
store, according to G. C. Miller, man
ager. These certificates are to be
held to identify the purchaser, and
since they have been handed in it has
been impossible to pay dividends to
these people. The manager is anxious
that all these certificates be held and
only the slips be dropped in the box.
All cards must be in the box in the
Bookstore before the first of May to
receive any of the dividends. The
manager is especially anxious that all
the slips be handed in when they are
received, since it is necessary to keep
several extra bookkeepers busy the
latter part of the year when all the
cards come in at once.
Of the $45,000 business last year
profit sharing certificates were taken
out on $28,000. The authorities at
the Bookstore are anxious that a much
larger percentage of slips be handed
in this year in order to have everyone
share in the profits.
