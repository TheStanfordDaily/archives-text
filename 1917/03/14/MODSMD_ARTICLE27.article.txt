# Changes to Be Made in German Faculty
## 
### 
With the coming college year sev
eral changes will take place in the
German department. Professor James
O. Griffin, who has been connected
with the department since the open
ing of the University, having reached
the age of sixty-five, retires automat
ically. Professor George Hempl, who
for the past ten years has been at the
head of the department, has asked to
be relieved of his executive duties, and
will thus be able to devote himself
more fully to the philological re
searches that he has had in hand for
several years past. He will continue
to hold the professorship of Germanic
Philology. Associate Professor Karl
G. Rendtorff and William A. Cooper,
who have been connected with the de
partment for many years, have been
promoted to full professorships. Pro
fessor Cooper, having been for some
time the secretary of the department,
has, during Professor Hempl's illness,
performed in large measure the duties
of the executive, and now becomes the
executive head of the department.
In consequence of the new policy
of the University to resign to the high
schools the elementary instruction in
modern languages, certain readjust
ments of courses will be made, which
will render it unnecessary to appoint
a successor to Professor Griffin. The
other members of the teaching staff
are Assistant Professors Bruno Boez
inger and Charlotte A. Knoch, and
Dr. Charles Reining.
