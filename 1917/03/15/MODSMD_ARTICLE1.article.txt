# ST. IGNATIUS DEFEATED IN 4-0 CONTEST
## VARSITY LOOKS GOOD Draper Holds Visitors to Four Hits. Cowan's Flay Is Featue of Game 
### 
WITH a small crowd shivering
in the bleachers, the Stanford
varsity baseball team defeated
the St. Ignatius tossers yesterday af
ternoon by a 4 to 0 score. The game
was played on the local diamond, the
lot being fairly dry, and in playing
condition, despite the recent rain.
There was nothing sensational about
the contest, but errors were few, and
taken as a whole, the battle was a
good exhibition of the national pas
time.
Draper Pitches Well.
Draper pitched well throughout,
fanning ten of the opposing stickers.
Wilcox received his fast ones in good
style. Bihlman and Wilkins played,
showing up well. Cowan was the star
of the day. He accepted nine hard
chances without a boot, batted in a
run, scored one himself, and boosted
his total of bingles by two timely
singles.
E. Mitchell, the catcher of the 1919
freshmen team, caught for the Cath
olic college aggregation. He had the
same old pepper and livened up the
otherwise slow eight innings.

varsity baseball team defeated
the St. Ignatius tossers yesterday af
ternoon by a 4 to 0 score. The game
was played on the local diamond, the
lot being fairly dry, and in playing
condition, despite the recent rain.
There was nothing sensational about
the contest, but errors were few, and
taken as a whole, the battle was a
good exhibition of the national pas
time.
Draper Pitches Well.
Draper pitched well throughout,
fanning ten of the opposing stickers.
Wilcox received his fast ones in good
style. Bihlman and Wilkins played,
showing up well. Cowan was the star
of the day. He accepted nine hard
chances without a boot, batted in a
run, scored one himself, and boosted
his total of bingles by two timely
singles.
E. Mitchell, the catcher of the 1919
freshmen team, caught for the Cath
olic college aggregation. He had the
same old pepper and livened up the
otherwise slow eight innings.
