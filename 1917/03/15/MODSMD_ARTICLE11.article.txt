# Judges Scarce for Tri-State Debate
## 
### 
Of the six men who were acceptable
jto Stanford for tho Washington de
-1 bate, none are willing to serve. In
! order to get the judges selected be
fore the contest on the 22d it has
been necessary to appoint Scott Cal
houn, '95, to act for Stanford in se
curing suitable men.
J. F. Elden, '16, is having trouble
! getting men at Stanford who are ac
ceptable to Oregon for their debate
!on March 23. C. C. Baker, a graduate
of University of Oregon, and a J. D.
man from Stanford, is acting for the
northern school in the selection of
the judges. A list of prominent men
has been submitted to him for his ap-
Ijroval, but no letter has been received
from him.
Coach Leib is putting the finishing
touches on his men in preparation for
both debates. F. S. Field, '18, and W.
L. Miller, '17, will leave for Seattle
next Monday. As a result extra work
is being put on their case. The Stan
ford debaters who will argue here are
preparing a new line of attack for the
question and should be in fine shape
by a week from Friday.
The question for discussion is, "Re
solved, That industrial disputes affect
ing one hundred or more men should
be subject to compulsory arbitration
with a compulsory award."
