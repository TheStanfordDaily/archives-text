## Al Earl Selected to Handle the Indicator in Contest on Local Diamond 
### 
Baseball fans wi be given the
prize opportunity of thr season, Sat
urday afternoon, when the Stanford
and University of Santa Clara teams
take the varsity diamond for the sec
ond clash. The game will undoubt
edly be the best contest of the season
with the possible exception of the
California struggles.
S. ('. Wins in Fourteenth.
Last Saturday, it took fourteen in
nings for the Missionites to conquer
the local tossers. The final score was
1 to 3, and there is serious doubt in
the minds of the spectators whether
or not Stanford should have been
awarded the decision in the ninth
frame. A play at home was close and
the calling of the umpire was ques
tioned by even the unprejudiced.
The largest crowd of the year will
probably turn out for the game Sat
urday. There is great competition
between the opposing squads, and as
the delegations arc so evenly matched,
excellent baseball is bound to be
served up before the bleacherites.
