# TIME SENSE

### 
There are many things learned at college which won't help buy
potatoes and onions when we get out into the whirl of tlie world.
Some of them are merely negative, like a course in Ancient Pots and
Pans, or the like. While such a thing can't be styled productive, ex
cept perhaps of small talk, it doesn't do us any real harm. Others,
however, are not only no help, but are also a decided drawback.
The particular impediment we have now in .mind is that of procras
tination, an art which is probably acquired more readily at college
than any place else. We are apt to value our own and other peo
ple's time cheaply while acquiring an education, for the reason that
it can not as a rule be measured in dollars and cents.
Time is wasted by those who have' not yet learned that it is
seven until it's eight with most of us, in waiting for meetings to be
called, games to begin and people to show up. Hence, those who
start out with good intentions soon perceive the folly of their ways,
and begin to discount a bit The result is chronic pro
crastination, an especially serious disease when time means money.
How much better it would be if we could all get the habit of
starting on time â€”of being punctual, or at least enough of us so that
we could afford to leave the others behind. Some of our athletic
contests are started so late that it doesn't seem possible to find an
adequate justification. Others prove that it is not necessary to
warm up the bleachers before beginning the show. Conspicuous
among these is track, which, although there are more men competing
in it than any other sport, has been run off in fine shape so far.
There may possibly be mitigating circumstances in the case of ath
letics, but we can see no reason why meetings should not start punc
tually. We would not only be saving a lot of time, but would be
breaking ourselves of a bad habit.
