# Huston Lecture Is Well Received
## Good Crowd Turns Out to Hear Dean Speak on Canadian Relationship

"Canada, although geographically
contiguous with Mexico in proximity
to the United States, is our nearest
neighbor, because of our common
problems and sympathies," said Dean
C. A. Huston of the Law School, in
an address at the Union last night
upon the subject of "Our Nearest
Neighbor During and After the War."
Mr. Huston explained the economic re
lationship between the United States
and Canada and the importance and
magnitude of the Canadian trade with
us. "But," he said, "our economic re
lations are less significant than our
blood ties with our northern neigh
bors; many men and women prom
inent in American affairs are Can
adians by birth, and likewise many
Americans are prominent in Canadian
affairs."
Institutions Much Alike.
"The institutions of the two coun
tries are very much alike," Mr. Hus
ton remarked. "In fact Canada and
the United States are the hope of
democracy." However, a growing
estrangement is coming between the
two countries; this estrangement, as
the speaker said, has its origin in
history and is only augmented by the
problems of the war. The unsettled
question of reciprocity likewise has
been a matter of dispute. However,
as Mr. Huston explained, "the key to
the concert of nations lies on the
American continent and exists In the
friendly relations between the United
States and Canada."
