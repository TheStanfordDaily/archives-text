# U.C. To Have Officers' Corps.
## 
### 
Following the example of Yale and
other eastern colleges, the University
of California will organize on Oflicers'
Reserve Corps to be placed at the
disposal of the federal government in
event of a national crisis. This was
decided yesterday at a meeting of the
trustees of the university.
