<â€¢>lll Club Holds Annual
Indoor Truck Meet Tonight.
Several indoor track records will be
threatened tonight when gymnaslsts
hold their annual competition, under
the auspices of the Stanford Gym
Club. Only one record was broken
last year, and most of the records
hung in the gym are credited to old
timers, but some may go by the
boards, tonight.
A new event has been added, that
of a 40 yard dash, and the winner of
that event tonight, will hold that rec
ord for a year at least. A number of
new men have entered the competi
tion, and may spring some surprises.
The meet will start at 7:45.
