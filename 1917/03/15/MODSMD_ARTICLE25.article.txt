# Le
						Circle Francais Brings Paris Here
## 
### 
In their final rehearsal this after
noon, the casts of the two French
plays to be staged in the Little The
ater tomorrow evening by Le Cercle
Francais, showed themselves letter
perfect in their difficult French parts.
As nearly as possible in every respect
the evening will resemble one in a
Parisian theater.
