| dents received "smoke ups" in two or
more subjects.
Final dismissals from the Univer
sity came only in cases where work
jof the student had previously been so
bad that it was evident that he could
j not "make the grade" this year. Most
failures were in cases where the stu
dent had been on probation this se
mester or had a first failure, and the
second failure meant dismissal.
The fatality list for dismissals this
semester was much higher than last.
Only two or three students were
forced to leave by the faculty axe be
fore, and the action of the committee
this time marks a new attitude on
mid-semester work.
