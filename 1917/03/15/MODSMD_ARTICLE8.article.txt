# Strict Training in Effect for Boxers
## Mitt Artists Chosen to Meet Rears Put in Hard Licks for Annual Bouts 
### 
Training rules for the boxers picked
to fight against California, March 26,
went into effect yesterday. H. W.
Maloney, boxing instructor, states
that the men can make their weights,
but need training endurance.
The regular boxing classes will be
under the care of J. D. Flint, gr.,
assistant instructor, and Maloney will
devote Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
and Friday afternoons to the instruc
tion of the varsity men until after the j
California matches.
The training rules are: (1) In bed j
at 11. (2) No smoking. (3) No danc-j
ing. (4) Run every day. (5) No rich
foods or pastry. (6) Box four days a
week. The men that this will affect
nro as follows: Britt, Marston, Flint, j
Wass, Sullivan, Stewart, Pedley,
Wheatlv.
The California bouts will be fought
at Berkeley, and will be in a roped
ring. The Cardinal men have never
' fought within ropes, and will be at a
' disadvantage. However, Mr. Maloney
|is enthusiastic about the cleverness J
and science the men are showing, and
is very optimistic about the prospects
of bringing home several intercollegi
ate championships, a week from next
I Monday. I
