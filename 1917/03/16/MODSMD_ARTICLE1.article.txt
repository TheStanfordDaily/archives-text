Underclassmen Sprint.
House, Floete, Wells, Dinkelspiel,
Davis and Needham appear to have
the 100 and 220 yard dash events
clinched for either the sophomores or
freshmen. In the hurdle events, first
place must be conceded to the sec
ond-year men, as House looks good
for victory in both. If Norton com
petes for the seniors, he should be
good for second place at least, in
both events, judging from his per
formance last week. With Norton out

iors, should obtain second in the
high sticks.
In the low hurdles, Wells, Halsted
and R. L. Templeton will fight it out
for the remaining places.
Seniors look to have a sure grip on
the half with Schnell and Scott as
their representatives. Freshman
Wilke is expected to come in third.
Aupperle should capture the mile for
the fourth-year men, while the juniors
look to have first and third in the
two-mile with Chapman and Wilson,
respectively, with Loucks capturing
second for the fourth-year men. Samis
may prove a contender, however.
Miller looks good to add five points
to the senior score in the hammer,
with Gillespie, Murray and Scott
fighting it out for the other places,
representing the juniors, seniors and
freshmen. Caughey is good for first
in the shot put for the juniors. Rone.v
