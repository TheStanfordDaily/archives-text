# Krehbiel Believes Revolt in Russia Splendid Victory
## 
### 
Russia's revolt is a blow at autoc
racy, says Professor Edward B.
Krehbiel, of the Modern History
courses. The rise of the Duma and
the abdication of the Czar is a sign
of victory over the pro-German party,
thinks Professor Krehbiel, who looks
for a constitutional monarchy in Rus
sia.
Explaining the internal conditions
of Russia today, Professor Krehbiel
said: "In Europe governments start
ed as representatives of aristocracy,
admitted the capitalists, and then to
the business and upper middle
classes in most instances. The ques
tion of the age is to enlarge the gen
demanding more share in the govern
ment.
"The present uprising in Russia is
not surprising. What has broken out
did not come up over night—it has
been growing for years. Viewed from
it broadest light, it is the same move
ment seen in 1830 and 1848 in other
European countries. The people are
demanding more in the government.
"The Russian progressives began to
lose faith in the church, which stood
behind the Czar, and made him be
lieve he ruled by divine right through
a covenant with God to do His busi
ness.
"In Russia it is principally a ques
tion of the men around the Czar. He
is weak. There have been liberal
Czars. The present Czar is controlled
by the reactionaries.
"The Russo-Japanese War, unpopu
lar with the Russians, resulted in a
period of revolution.
"The first Duma was established in
1906 as the result of a revolution.
The demand now is to free the Duma
to do as it wishes, discuss what it
wants, and to have a ministry from
the dominant party.
"As things went it has been discov
ered right along that certain ministers
prevented effective prosecution of the
war. But the people want the pres
ent war. It is a popular war. The
church is in favor of the war. The
business class wants the war because
a Russian-German treaty has flooded
Russia with German goods. The
army wants war, only the no
bility is against it. The nobility
realizes that if this is a war for
democracy they are done for. Thus
they have seen to it through the min
istry that the war is not prosecuted
hard.
"Apparently what has happened is
this. The army and the people have
discoverer! that the bureaucracy is not
pressing the war as vigorously as it
should. Accordingly they haVe re
volted, the Czar has abdicated and the
constitutional liberals are in power.
This means a more vigorous prosecu
tion of the war by Russia, unless the
present steps lead to such internal
dissentions as to prevent effective ac
tion. This will depend largely on the
attitude of the peasantry, which has
generally been attach ad to the Czar,
as to 'The Little Father.'
"The events in Russia are in accord
ance with the trend of history to sub
stitute greater democracy for the older
forms of government."

realizes that if this is a war for
democracy they are done for. Thus
they have seen to it through the min
istry that the war is not prosecuted
hard.
"Apparently what has happened is
this. The army and the people have
discoverer! that the bureaucracy is not
pressing the war as vigorously as it
should. Accordingly they haVe re
volted, the Czar has abdicated and the
constitutional liberals are in power.
This means a more vigorous prosecu
tion of the war by Russia, unless the
present steps lead to such internal
dissentions as to prevent effective ac
tion. This will depend largely on the
attitude of the peasantry, which has
generally been attach ad to the Czar,
as to 'The Little Father.'
"The events in Russia are in accord
ance with the trend of history to sub
stitute greater democracy for the older
forms of government."
Russia's revolt is a blow at autoc
racy, says Professor Edward B.
Krehbiel, of the Modern History
courses. The rise of the Duma and
the abdication of the Czar is a sign
of victory over the pro-German party,
thinks Professor Krehbiel, who looks
for a constitutional monarchy in Rus
sia.
Explaining the internal conditions
of Russia today, Professor Krehbiel
said: "In Europe governments start
ed as representatives of aristocracy,
admitted the capitalists, and then to
the business and upper middle
classes in most instances. The ques
tion of the age is to enlarge the gen
demanding more share in the govern
ment.
"The present uprising in Russia is
not surprising. What has broken out
did not come up over night—it has
been growing for years. Viewed from
it broadest light, it is the same move
ment seen in 1830 and 1848 in other
European countries. The people are
demanding more in the government.
"The Russian progressives began to
lose faith in the church, which stood
behind the Czar, and made him be
lieve he ruled by divine right through
a covenant with God to do His busi
ness.
"In Russia it is principally a ques
tion of the men around the Czar. He
is weak. There have been liberal
Czars. The present Czar is controlled
by the reactionaries.
"The Russo-Japanese War, unpopu
lar with the Russians, resulted in a
period of revolution.
"The first Duma was established in
1906 as the result of a revolution.
The demand now is to free the Duma
to do as it wishes, discuss what it
wants, and to have a ministry from
the dominant party.
"As things went it has been discov
ered right along that certain ministers
prevented effective prosecution of the
war. But the people want the pres
ent war. It is a popular war. The
church is in favor of the war. The
business class wants the war because
a Russian-German treaty has flooded
Russia with German goods. The
army wants war, only the no
bility is against it. The nobility
realizes that if this is a war for
democracy they are done for. Thus
they have seen to it through the min
istry that the war is not prosecuted
