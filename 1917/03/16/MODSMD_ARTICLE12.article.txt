San Jose high school and the fresh
men played a G to fi game on the var
sity diamond last night in the third
game of their series. Paul, the San
Jose heaver, held the babes safely
under his control until the last two
innings, when several long hits were
too much for him, resulting in six
tallies. The contest went, only seven
frames.
Hunter, Howes, Galloway and Pike,
for the freshmen, were in rare bat
ting form. Hunter secured a single
and a double. Howes hit out a left
field triple and fattened his average
further with a single. Galloway beat
out an infield hit and made a single,
while Pike came through with a triple
over the left fielder's head. In addi
tion to these hits Lifur cracked out a
single, making eight, hits for the
babes.
In the fifth inning Pike hit out a
triple with none down, but Wayland,
Cass and Moore could not bring him
in. The next frame began the fire
works. Lifur and Sparling were easy
outs, but with two down, Hunter,
Howes, Galloway and Pike got on, re
sulting in three runs. Not to be out
done, 111 the next spasm three safe
lies and hit batsman resulted in three
