### 
STANFORD varsity and the Univer

Graduate Manager Behrens is prepar-

ing to handle
the banner
crowd of the
season. The
two nines are
evenly matched
and the prize
contest of the
year is assured.
It is expected
that the fans
will fill the lo
clared at Santa
Clara, and the
school is com
ing to the game
cal bleachers.
A half-holiday
has been de-

in force. Father Sullivan wants* to
bring the Mission Town Band, and
combined with the Stanford Band, the
day will be livened up with music.
Twenty-five cents or season tickets
will admit the bleacher warmers to
the struggle.
