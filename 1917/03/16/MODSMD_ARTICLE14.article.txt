# SANTA CLARA NINE TO MEET VARSITY SATURDAY
## DIAMOND CLASSIC ON STANFORD LOT Banner Baseball Game to Start at Three-Earl Umpire 
### 
STANFORD varsity and the Univer
sity of Santa Clara baseball team
cross bats tomorrow afternoon at
3 o'clock on the Cardinal diamond.
Graduate Manager Behrens is prepar-

ing to handle
the banner
crowd of the
season. The
two nines are
evenly matched
and the prize
contest of the
year is assured.
It is expected
that the fans
will fill the lo
clared at Santa
Clara, and the
school is com
ing to the game
cal bleachers.
A half-holiday
has been de-

in force. Father Sullivan wants* to
bring the Mission Town Band, and
combined with the Stanford Band, the
day will be livened up with music.
Twenty-five cents or season tickets
will admit the bleacher warmers to
the struggle.


ll urler hoover.
There will no repetition of the poor
indicator work of last Saturday in the
fourteen inning affair, as A1 Earl has
been secured to umpire the contest.
Earl has had a great deal of experi
ence and besides giving both nines
a square deal, lie will keep the play
ers hustling and speed up the game.
The Lineup.
Captain "Doc" Hayes announces the
batting order for the game as fol
lows: Cowan, ss; Mitchell, rf;
Hayes, 11); Lilly, cf; Dickey, If; Stev
ens, 3b; Braden, 2b; Campbell, c, and
Hoever, p. Hoever has been resting
his arm for over a week and is in the
best of condition. With any kind of
support, he figures on sending the
Santa Clara sluggers back to the
bcnch in regular order.
The team has improved greatly in
hitting during the past week. Cowan
has found his batting eye, and Braden,
Mitchell and Stevens are hitting the
ball hard. Lilly has not been stick
ing like a cleanup man should, but
will probably find himself against the
Red and White aggregation.
"Tub" Spencer has left for the De
troit training camp, and Leonard is
handling the coaching reins at Santa
Clara. When consulted last night, he
would not give out the definite lineup.
He said that either he or Hickey
would start on the mound, with Pratt
catching. The remainder of the dele
gation will probably take their posi
tions as follows: Bensberg on Ist
base, Desmond at 2d, Malier at 3d. and
O'Neil at short. Milburn, Desmond,
Liberveau and Conners will compose
the outfield guardians.
