# Professor Wildman Speaks at Smoker
## Outlines Departmental Changes to Come With Four Quarter System 
### 
"The work of the manager of busi
ness is a profession," declared John
M. Hager. a graduate of the Stanford
Economics department in 1915, and a
recent graduate of the Harvard Grad
uate School of Business Administra
tion, at the Economics smoker in the
Union, last evening. "The former
opinion that the proper way for a man
to learn business is to grow up in
business no longer prevails. Men are
now beginning to realize that we need
trained men, men who know the prin
ciples of business before they enter
business."
Professor M. S. Wildman, head of
the Economics department, explained
the effect that the four-quarter sys
tem would have on the department.
Economics 1 will be cut to a five-hour
course, to he repeated every quarter,
he announced. Accounting will be
given three times a year. Political
Science will be given twice each year, j
A course in Principles of Economics
will be added for new majors, and
together with Economics 1, will cover
about the same ground as the ele-1
nicntary course has covered hereto-j
fore.
"The Student's Viewpoint" was the j
subject of a short talk by H. V. Aup-!
perle, '17, assistant in the Economics
department. He pointed out that the
Economics department showed the,
highest number of fatalities of any de- I
partment in the University, 16 per |
cent of the enrollment having either
gone on probation or "flunked out" j
last semester.
Professor S. I. Miller, in a short i
address, sounded an appeal "for j
breadlh of education, for ideals of ed
ucation, in order that we can have
efficiency in its broader sense."
"Cold-blooded efficiency is scarcely ef
ficiency at all," he said.
