# PREPAREDNESS SURVEY
## 
### 
A survey of what Stanford trained men and women will have to
offer in case of war strikes a thoroughly practical note, and one
which can be highly commended. We are glad to see something of
this nature being done, strengthening as it does the somewhat super
ficial impression created by our petitions assuring the President of
our support. Protestations of loyalty are good as far as they go, but
it is well to know, if possible, approximately what there is to back
them up, whether it is much or little that is discovered. What forces
will he available from the ranks of past and present Stanford? How
can those forces best be utilized? These and others are questions
which will be answered by the survey.
Universities should prove a useful medium for the placing of
men where they are most needed. Trained men in many sciences and
professions will be required, as well as soldiers. It is well to know
where to lay hands on them in a hurry. If the country's resources
are catalogued, even partially, it won't take quite so long to get
started in case of war.
