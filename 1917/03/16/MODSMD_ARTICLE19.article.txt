# Danny Carroll Assists in Spring Football Practice
## 
### 
Danny Carroll's services have been
secured by Captain O. G. Lachmund to
coach the spring rugby squad. The
veteran Australian rugger is the most
experienced and best qualified of any
player on the campus. Last night
Carroll handled the forwards and the
backs were put through their paces
by Lachmund.
