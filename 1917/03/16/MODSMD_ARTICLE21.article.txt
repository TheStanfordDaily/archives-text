"MILITARY TRAINING ECONOMY."
In yesterday's issue of The Illus
trated Review a short article entitled
"Military Training Economy," points
out as the "grossest extravagance,"
the Military Ball.
The article was evidently written
by an outsider, one who was in en
tire ignorance of the facts of the case.
For the edification of such as he
let it be known that the Corps have
paid all bills incurred for the Military
Ball.
These totaled $106.95.
Concerning statistics, by actual
count there were 141 members of the
Corps present at the hop. Invitations
were sent to 85 friends of the Corps
so that a fair estimate of the number
of participants when placed at 200
couples is not far wrong.
This means that the hop cost the
Corps $ 0.835 a couple, which when
compared with $2.50 for the Sopho
more Cotillion, $5.00 for the Junior
Prom, and $7.00 for the Senior Ball,
will show our misinformed friend
that the Military Ball is not the
"grossest extravagance" or any where
near it.
Tt may be true that there was a
"lack of foresight," as it was esti
mated that at least 175 men out of
2G5 in the Corps would attend the
ball. The natural desire was to make
this the biggest and the best affair
that has been given at Stanford Uni
versity.
The sum of $1.00 was levied on
those members of the Corps who were
to attend. This, as theoretically
figured, would meet all the expenses
and leave a slight surplus.
Unfortunately, the receipts on the
night of the hop only amounted to
$141.00. An additional tax amounting
to 18.4 cents per man attending the
hop was levied and all the bills were
paid.
If it were not for this misguided in
dividual, who does not belong to our
Corps, and can not even get the facts
straight and who, desiring to break
out in print, writes such a misrep
resenting article, we would not be
forced to give a long-winded explana
tion of something that is undoubtedly
our own personal business as mem
bers of the Corps.
Let us hope that this particular
"Editor" will keep his head up in the
future, so that we patriots.may con
tinue on our modest way and escape
unjust criticism.

"MILITARY TRAINING ECONOMY."
In yesterday's issue of The Illus
trated Review a short article entitled
"Military Training Economy," points
out as the "grossest extravagance,"
the Military Ball.
The article was evidently written
by an outsider, one who was in en
tire ignorance of the facts of the case.
For the edification of such as he
let it be known that the Corps have
paid all bills incurred for the Military
Ball.
These totaled $106.95.
Concerning statistics, by actual
count there were 141 members of the
Corps present at the hop. Invitations
were sent to 85 friends of the Corps
so that a fair estimate of the number
of participants when placed at 200
couples is not far wrong.
This means that the hop cost the
Corps $ 0.835 a couple, which when
compared with $2.50 for the Sopho
more Cotillion, $5.00 for the Junior
Prom, and $7.00 for the Senior Ball,
will show our misinformed friend
that the Military Ball is not the
"grossest extravagance" or any where
near it.
Tt may be true that there was a
"lack of foresight," as it was esti
mated that at least 175 men out of
2G5 in the Corps would attend the
ball. The natural desire was to make
this the biggest and the best affair
that has been given at Stanford Uni
versity.
The sum of $1.00 was levied on
those members of the Corps who were
to attend. This, as theoretically
figured, would meet all the expenses
and leave a slight surplus.
Unfortunately, the receipts on the
night of the hop only amounted to
$141.00. An additional tax amounting
to 18.4 cents per man attending the
hop was levied and all the bills were
paid.
If it were not for this misguided in
dividual, who does not belong to our
Corps, and can not even get the facts
straight and who, desiring to break
out in print, writes such a misrep
resenting article, we would not be
forced to give a long-winded explana
tion of something that is undoubtedly
our own personal business as mem
bers of the Corps.
Let us hope that this particular
"Editor" will keep his head up in the
future, so that we patriots.may con
tinue on our modest way and escape
unjust criticism.
