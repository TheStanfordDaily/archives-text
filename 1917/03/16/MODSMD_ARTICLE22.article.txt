# Bears Score Track Victory at Pomona
## 
### 
University of California track team
defeated Pomona College yesterday on
their tour of the south by a score of
80V& to 50 V&. California is as usual
weak in the track events, and Pomona
captured all three places in the 100
and mile, and more than their share
of the other track points. However,
California retaliated by monopolizing
the field events.
