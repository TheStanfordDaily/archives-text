# Crew Men Being Put Through Hard Work
## 
### 
Coach "Husky" Guerena is putting
crew candidates through hard work
outs this week in preparation to pick
ing the men who will be put on the
training table in the near future. All
the varsity men are being rowed in
the first boat. As a result a good line
can be gained on their ability.
Conditions at RedAvood are good
again, and four crews, two varsity
and two freshmen, are working out
every night. California eights are on
a training table at present and their
coach has practically chosen the men
who will row in the big regatta. The
eights of University of Washington,
under the direction of Coach Cona
bear, are determined to go to Pough
keepsie by winning the Pacific Coast
title, and are goins at top speed.
