# Tri-State Debaters Go North Monday
## 
### 
Stanford's team to debate against
the University of Washington will
leave the campus next Monday for
Seattle. The contest will be argued
next Thursday, the 22d. The men who
are taking the trip are F. S. Field,
'18, and W. L. Miller, '17.
This week Coach Karl Leib, '15, has
been putting the finishing touches on
the arguments of these two men, so
they will be in shape to put up a win
ning debate next Thursday.
