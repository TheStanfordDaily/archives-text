# GUILD SCOPE ENLARGED BY BROAD PLANS
## ADDITIONAL BENEFITS Board Names Two Guild Physicians to Diagnose Student Cases S. J. High and 1920 Tie in Third Game 
### 
BENEFITS from the Students'
Guild will be increased as the
result of a new plan for service
adopted at the meeting of the board
yesterday afternoon. The plan makes
arrangements for the coming semes
ter.
New Constitution.
At the same time a new constitution
was brought up before the board, but
is held over, pending consideration,
rt will enlarge the powers of the
Guild Hoard, and make the Guild a
full-fledged corporation. A Guild seal
will be adopted to this latter purpose.
Week's Free Treatment.
Guild members will get free medical
attention by Guild doctors for one
week of residence at the hospital.
The cost of this attendance is not to
exceed fifteen dollars.
Dr. Clelia Mosher is named by the
Guild to act as Guild physician for
women, and Dr. Herbert R. Stolz for
! the men. They will receive no addi- !
| tional salaries other than that pro-1
! vided by the University. In the past, i
they have not been expected to give j
medical attention to students, being j
merely physical instructors.
In brief, it is the plan to have Dr. I
Stolz and Dr. Mosher take up cases,;
and if they are serious, outside phy- j
sicians will be called in for further
advice and attention. With the ap- j
proval of the Guild physicians, fur
ther medical advice will be paid from
the Guild treasury, up to the amount
of fifteen dollars.
However, the Guild will not pay the
cost of extra consultation, unless the
Guild physicians agree that it is neces
sary. Vaccinations will not be in- j
eluded in the further benefits, the
board having ruled that such matters
should be attended to before students
enter college.
To cover the additional cost of this
service, the board adopted a two-dol
lars per quarter fee for Guild mem
bers. This will be subject to either
increase or decrease after the new
plan has been tried out.
A sum of $600, $100 for the men and
$200 for the women, has been author
ized for office assistants and supplies.
All details of the new arrangement j
are not entirely settled, but will pend
for some time, as arrangements are
made to meet the new conditions
brought about by the change to the
four-quarter system.
