# SANTA CLARA NINE WALLOPS STANFORD 6 2
## VARSITY BOOTS BALL Lilly's Homer Scoring Hayes Tallies Only Runs Made by Cardinal 
### Niel H. Petree 
DASHING the basball hopes of the
Cardinal fans, the Stanford var
sity booted, boneheaded and
tossed away the second contest with
the University of Santa Clara team
Saturday afternoon on the local dia
mond. The bleachers were filled with
followers of the game, anxious to see
a struggle of the same type that was
presented to the Santa Clara bleacher
ites the week before, when the same
two nines fought for fourteen innings.
Instead, they were treated to the poor
est exhibition that the limited time
would allow. The final score was 6
to 2, but this is not indicative of the
relative merits of the opposing squads
last Saturday.
Some Thrills In (»snue.
The game was not without its
thrills, despite the "nobody home" dis
plays. Lilly smashed out a long home
run in the sixth inning, sending in
Captain Hayes ahead of him with the
only Stanford scores. The local team
batted well, knocking Leonard out of
the box in the sixth frame, and finding
Fitzpatrick several times. There
were eleven hits gathered by the
Stanford batsmen and eleven by the
Catholic college sluggers.
Cowan, although making two errors,
one or which counted for a Santa Clara
tally, played a wonderful game. Ilis
work around the short patch was a
revelation compared to some of the
other fielding. He also secured three
hits. Mattei pitched well, and estab
lished himself as the best of the Card
inal heavers. Hayes played an ex
cellent game at lirst, although man
aging to get into the error column.
Hoover l'ilclips Poorly.
Hoever has just cause to complain
of the support accorded him while he
was on the mound. However, the big
fellow did not have anything on the
ball. Every time he tossed the sphere
toward the plate, he would look around
to see how far it had been hit. Trainer
Roth said that Hoever had a bad stitch
in his right side, and this probably
accounted for his poor work.
Santa Clara, scored her six runs in
the first four innings, getting two in
the first, two in the third, and another
brace of markers in the fourth. Mil
burn tallied twice and O'Neil, Des
mond, Maher and Rooney each came
across once. Three of these runs were
! earned, the rest being made on errors.
Both of the Stanford scores were earn
ed runs.

DASHING the basball hopes of the
Cardinal fans, the Stanford var
sity booted, boneheaded and
tossed away the second contest with
the University of Santa Clara team
Saturday afternoon on the local dia
mond. The bleachers were filled with
followers of the game, anxious to see
a struggle of the same type that was
presented to the Santa Clara bleacher
ites the week before, when the same
two nines fought for fourteen innings.
Instead, they were treated to the poor
est exhibition that the limited time
would allow. The final score was 6
to 2, but this is not indicative of the
relative merits of the opposing squads
last Saturday.
Some Thrills In (»snue.
The game was not without its
thrills, despite the "nobody home" dis
plays. Lilly smashed out a long home
run in the sixth inning, sending in
Captain Hayes ahead of him with the
only Stanford scores. The local team
batted well, knocking Leonard out of
the box in the sixth frame, and finding
Fitzpatrick several times. There
were eleven hits gathered by the
Stanford batsmen and eleven by the
Catholic college sluggers.
Cowan, although making two errors,
one or which counted for a Santa Clara
tally, played a wonderful game. Ilis
work around the short patch was a
revelation compared to some of the
other fielding. He also secured three
hits. Mattei pitched well, and estab
lished himself as the best of the Card
inal heavers. Hayes played an ex
cellent game at lirst, although man
aging to get into the error column.
Hoover l'ilclips Poorly.
Hoever has just cause to complain
of the support accorded him while he
was on the mound. However, the big
fellow did not have anything on the
ball. Every time he tossed the sphere
toward the plate, he would look around
to see how far it had been hit. Trainer
Roth said that Hoever had a bad stitch
in his right side, and this probably
accounted for his poor work.

DASHING the basball hopes of the
Cardinal fans, the Stanford var
sity booted, boneheaded and
tossed away the second contest with
the University of Santa Clara team
Saturday afternoon on the local dia
mond. The bleachers were filled with
followers of the game, anxious to see
a struggle of the same type that was
presented to the Santa Clara bleacher
ites the week before, when the same
two nines fought for fourteen innings.
Instead, they were treated to the poor
est exhibition that the limited time
would allow. The final score was 6
to 2, but this is not indicative of the
relative merits of the opposing squads
last Saturday.
Some Thrills In (»snue.
The game was not without its
thrills, despite the "nobody home" dis
plays. Lilly smashed out a long home
run in the sixth inning, sending in
Captain Hayes ahead of him with the
only Stanford scores. The local team
batted well, knocking Leonard out of
the box in the sixth frame, and finding
Fitzpatrick several times. There
were eleven hits gathered by the
Stanford batsmen and eleven by the
Catholic college sluggers.
Cowan, although making two errors,
one or which counted for a Santa Clara
tally, played a wonderful game. Ilis
work around the short patch was a
revelation compared to some of the
other fielding. He also secured three
hits. Mattei pitched well, and estab
lished himself as the best of the Card
inal heavers. Hayes played an ex
cellent game at lirst, although man
aging to get into the error column.
Hoover l'ilclips Poorly.
Hoever has just cause to complain
of the support accorded him while he
was on the mound. However, the big
fellow did not have anything on the
ball. Every time he tossed the sphere
toward the plate, he would look around
to see how far it had been hit. Trainer
Roth said that Hoever had a bad stitch
in his right side, and this probably
accounted for his poor work.
Santa Clara, scored her six runs in
the first four innings, getting two in
the first, two in the third, and another
brace of markers in the fourth. Mil
burn tallied twice and O'Neil, Des
mond, Maher and Rooney each came
across once. Three of these runs were
! earned, the rest being made on errors.
Both of the Stanford scores were earn
