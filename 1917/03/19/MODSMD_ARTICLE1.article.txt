### Niel H. Petree 
DASHING the basball hopes of the
Cardinal fans, the Stanford var
sity booted, boneheaded and
tossed away the second contest with
the University of Santa Clara team
Saturday afternoon on the local dia
mond. The bleachers were filled with
followers of the game, anxious to see
a struggle of the same type that was
presented to the Santa Clara bleacher
ites the week before, when the same
two nines fought for fourteen innings.
Instead, they were treated to the poor
est exhibition that the limited time
would allow. The final score was 6
to 2, but this is not indicative of the
relative merits of the opposing squads
last Saturday.
Some Thrills In (Â»snue.
The game was not without its
thrills, despite the "nobody home" dis
plays. Lilly smashed out a long home
run in the sixth inning, sending in
Captain Hayes ahead of him with the
only Stanford scores. The local team
batted well, knocking Leonard out of
the box in the sixth frame, and finding
Fitzpatrick several times. There
were eleven hits gathered by the
Stanford batsmen and eleven by the
Catholic college sluggers.
