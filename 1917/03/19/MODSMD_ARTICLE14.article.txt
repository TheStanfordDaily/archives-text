Final arrangements for judges and
the chairman for the Oregon debate
will be made tomorrow, according to
J. F. Elden, '16. A tentative list of
judges has been accepted by C. C.
Baker, acting for Oregon, but some
difficulty has been experienced in se
curing the men to act.
The men will be allowed a twenty
minute main speech, with a five minute
rebuttal each.
Since no admission is to be charged
Coach Leib is expecting the largest
crowd that has ever been at a debate
to turn out. Relations between capi
tal and labor and the possibilities of
settlement of troubles will be pre
sented from all sides. The public will
be able to form an opinion after the
arguments Friday on the question, can
a body of workmen tie up a country's
business with a strike, since this is
the real issue on which the debate will
hinge. The Russian revolution and
the strikes in England, which were so
serious in hampering the British in
the war, will all be dealt with in the
presentation of the Stanford case.
