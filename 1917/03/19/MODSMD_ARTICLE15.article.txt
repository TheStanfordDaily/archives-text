Provisions of Kill.
The Prendergast bill, which is being
vigorously opposed by petition and
other methods at the present time,
provides that medical schools and sci
entific research institutions of the
state may buy dogs, which have been
impounded, to use them for purposes
of experimentation.
In defending this bill, as "an honest
attempt to meet on honest need in an
honest way," President Wilbur says,
in part:
"We of the universities know the re
sults of animal experimentation, aud
that mankind has moved forward fur
ther in these last fifty years in the
control of conditions having to do
with health than in the five hundred
years preceding; and we know that
the greater portion of this progress
has depended upon animal experi
ments. Do those opposed know the
facts? Have they ever taken part in
research work? Can they be the
judges? Must the public not rely upon
its universities in these matters?
. . . The Prendergast bill will help
us."
