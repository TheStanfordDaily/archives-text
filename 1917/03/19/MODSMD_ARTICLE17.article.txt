# A 						MISUNDERSTANDING

### 
Through some misunderstanding of University action in regard
to grading classes, there exists an impression among a good many
students that fifteen per cent of each group is required to be flunked.
In the past, the idea has not been foreign to a few members of the
faculty, incredible as it may seem. No doubt instructors have got the
matter straight by this time. If there are any who have not, we sin
cerely hope they will do so before final examinations roll around.
Students can suffer only through a misunderstanding, since there is
nothing of the kind in the regulation. It reads as follows: "In
grading classes 'A' shall be considered as normally applicable to not
more than 15 per cent, 'B' and 'C' to 35 per cent each, and 'D' to 15
per cent of the students of passing grade. This valuation of grades
is advisory, but its use generally by members of the instructing staff
is urged. It is understood to admit of a certain degree of flexibility
in the handling of small or advanced classes.''
Under this scheme, those who are not of passing grade are first
cut off, there plainly being nothing which requires any certain num
ber to be flunked. Instructors in large classes have said that, irre
spective of any rule, it has been their experience that marks are dis
tributed approximately in accordance with this outline. This is prob
ably true with large classes, but seems impossible where the class is
small. In such cases all the students could conceivably be of "A"
and "B" caliber. We hope instructors of small classes will take ad
vantage of the flexibility clause in the above regulation.
