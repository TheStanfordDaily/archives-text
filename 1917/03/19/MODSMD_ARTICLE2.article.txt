# "Art Advisor" to Be Chappie's New Role
## Rumors Abroad That Knights of Hammer Will "Comeback" at D.P.A. 
### 
With a spirit of co-operation and in
struction, Chappie has now taken unto
himself the difficult task of art adviser
for Stanford University. In "Art for
the Gallery," which is to appear as
a double-page pictorial feature in to
morrow's Chaparral, Chappie's artist
has succeeded in reaching hitherto un
attained heights in the characteriza
tion of the ideal in art, which he gen
erously offers as suggestions for the
stocking of the new art gallery, soon
to be completed.
Radiant, Gaudy <>arh.
In garb, tomorrow's issue of Chap
arral appears as radiant and gaudy as
a flowered hillside in spring. With
three colors, evidently chosen at ran
dom on the quad, Chappie means to
cut quite a dash himself as he struts
tomorrow in honor of "Junior Week,"
to which the issue is dedicated.
"Seven Days," a poem by B. C.
Wohlford, '18, forms the prelude to
Chappie's twn introduction to the
queener's week of bliss. But even
while in such a joyous frame of mind
Chappie cannot forget his little
grudge against The Daily Palo Alto,
for he remembers that the daily, with
Journalistic sternness, unearthed one
of Chappie's hitherto undetected foun
tains of wit. And it is darkly rum
ored among the knowing knights of
the hammer that Chappie "will come
back" in double measure when the
coming isßue appears.
