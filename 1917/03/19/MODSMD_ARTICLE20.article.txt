## 
### 
Despite the fact that all of the aud
ience could not understand all of the
words, the French plays in the Little
Theater, Friday evening, were a de
cided success, both as an entertain
ment and as a charitable enterprise, a
large sum of money being cleared for
the relief of the fatherless children
of northern France.
Of the two one-act plays, the second,
"L'Anglais Tel Qu'on le Parle," was
the most enjoyable. This was not due
to any shortcoming on the part of the
actors in the first drama, "Le Frere
Aine," but was the natural result of
the exceptional length of the speeches
and of the lack of possible action in
the latter.
J. A. Sellards, as Dominique, "le
frere aine"; J. C. Cross. '17, as the
younger brother; Miss Germaine Levy,
'17, as Claire, and H. S. Weller, '18,
as Mascaret, the stupid domestic, were
partially successful in overcoming the
deficiencies of this play, each consist
ently interpreting his or her part.
Miss Thurlyne Buffum. '19, and G. A.
Davis, '18, did the best acting in the
second play. Davis' part was in Eng
lish, while that of Miss Buffum, who
represented his daughter, a young
English lady who has eloped to
France, was part French and part
English.
Instructor Gabriel Henri Grojean as
the interpreter who could not inter
pret, gave point, as well as a real
"esprit Francais" to the comedy. As
sistant Professor S. A. Smith of the
Romanic Languages department, gave
an excellent impersonation of the
young Frenchman eloping with the
rich young English girl.
Singing of French songs, including
"La Marseillaise," by Miss Edith Har
vey, '17, was one of the most pleasing
features of the evening's program.
