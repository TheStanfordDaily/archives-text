# Triangular Fencing Event Is Postponed
## 
### 
Failure of Olympic Club fencers to
make an appearance last Saturday eve
ning at the Olympic Club, caused the
scheduled triangle fencing tourney be
tween California, the Olympic Club
and Stanford to be indefinitely post
poned. Two weeks from last Satur
day, however, is the probable date for
the event.
Informal bouts were staged by the
representatives of California and Stan
ford, which resulted in a Berkeley vic
tory. No referee officiated and the
contests were merely for practice,
only.
