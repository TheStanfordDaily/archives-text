# Twenty-Seven Princeton Men Are Unkissed
## 
### 
Twenty-seven—count them, each
and every one—paragons of virtue
masquerading as seniors at Prince
ton, have confessed thut the joy of
their first kiss still awaits them.
They are in the great minority, for
one hundred and eighty-seven class
mates confessed otherwise.
Why the twenty-seven Sir Gala
hads? They offer various reasons;
in the first plac*>, Princeton is not a
co-educational institution; the high
cost of loving; increased cost of
clean, stiff collars, sanitation, hy
gienic scruples, "watchful waiting,"
and most of all, the lack of oppor
tunity. One man even went so far
as to say that lie had never found a
fair one worthy of his First kiss.
Not one had the courage to confess
that he lacked the nerve; that would
he unmanly.
Leading question is—"How many
Stanford seniors have ever enjoyed
their first osculation?" Stanford is
a co-educational institution; there
is no lack of opportunity.
