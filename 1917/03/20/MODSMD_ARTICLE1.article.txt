# VARSITY TO MEET ST. IGNATIUS BALL TEAM
## LAST PRACTICE GAME Captain Hayes Will Experiment With Possible Big Series Combinations 
### 
IN THE last game before the Cali
fornia series, the Stanford baseball
team lines up against St. Ignatius
tomorrow afternoon on the varsity
diamond. This is the second game
between these two teams, the Card
inal winning the initial contest by a
4 to 0 score. Season tickets or twen
ey-five cents will admit the fans.
Captain "Doc" Hayes will play most
of the members of the varsity squad
in an effort to determine the best men
for the first game against the Berke
ley aggregation. Draper will prob
ably pitch, as there is little chance of
him starting against the Blue and
Gold, Saturday. Wilcox will catch,
Hayes will cover first, Braden will
play second, and if Shriver is in con
dition he will go in. Reagon may
also play in the infield. Cowan will
play short and Stevens third. Dickey,
Wilkins, Lilly, Bihlman, Mitchell and
Noonan will all work in the outfield.
Captain Burns of the St. Ignatius
tossers expects to give the Cardinal
a hard game. Morrissey will start in
the box, although Dewey may pitch
part of the game. Mitchell, of the
1919 freshmen team, will again catch
for the Catholic college. Phelan will
umpire the game.
