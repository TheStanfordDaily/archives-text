# Discovery of Old Firearm Recalls Ancient Romance
## 
### 
Romance is not dead yet—not even
on the Stanford Farm. The old stories
of secret caves, hidden treasure, and
bandits of old, is rivalled today by the
story brought to light on Sunday, by
R. K. Hevier, Stanford sophomore.
Hearing of the stories told about the
Frenchman's Tunnel —of the romantic
career of the old Frenchman and his
hoard of gold, which was later found
by Senator Stanford —Bevier started
out Sunday on a little investigation of
his own.
His reward is an old Hint-lock fire
arm, embellished with brass trim
mings and showing all the ear-marks
of a century-old vintage. It measures
about sixteen inches in length, and
has a bore of fully an inch. It shows
the effect of long years of disuse.
Hevier will present the relic to the
Stanford museum.
