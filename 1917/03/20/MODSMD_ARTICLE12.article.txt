# 1920 Ball Tossers to Meet Pally High
## 
### 
Palo Alto high school and the fresh
men will tangle on the auxiliary dia
mond in the third game of their base
ball series tomorrow at 4:15. Lifur
will probably take the mound for the
first-year men, with Joerg behind the
bat, Pike on first, Hunter on second,
Elliott on third, and Galloway at
short. Howes, Wayland and Cass will
complete the team in the outfield.
The freshmen have won both their
contests from the Palo Alto team.
Both battles were by two run mar
gins, however, and tomorrow's game
should be a good battle.
