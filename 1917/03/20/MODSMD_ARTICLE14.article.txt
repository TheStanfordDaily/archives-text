# DORMITORIES FOR WOMEN READY IN FALL
## FIGURE COST $281,000 Hope to Complete Buildings Northwest of Lake by October 
### 
GENERAL plans for the new
women's dormitories have been
completed, orders for steel have
been placed and Business Manager
\ anderlynn Stow announced today
that the University hoped to have the
new buildings finished and ready for
occupation by the opening of the com
ing academic year, October 1.
Will Hold L»00.
I his means that all women students
will be able to live on the campus
hereafter. The new dormitories will
accommodate about two hundred
women, and will house all women now
living at Roble, Madrono, and cam
pus rooming houses, and in Palo Alto.
All that remains to be done before
actual construction work is started is
the completion of actual working plans
by Architect George W. Kelham of
San Francisco.
Steel orders for the dormitories
were placed yesterday by Manager
Stow at a figure that will save the
University a thousand dollars over
what he would have had to agree to
pay if he had ordered today. Orders
for the steel for the new Library
were also placed yesterday and con
struction will begin as soon as a few
minor details of the architect's plans
are finished up.
Total cost of the women's dormi
tories will be $281,000, according to
Manager Stow. They will be located
in the field northwest of Lagunita and
will face in the general direction of
the quad.
A separate sleeping room is pro
vided for each women, and the build
ings are so constructed that lots of
air and sunshine will reach each
room. Plans are somewhat different
than the tentative ones outlined ear
lier in the year. The main building
will be in the shape of an "H," with
an adjoining "I" that can be later
added to and made into another "H."
Both buildings will be three stories
in height.
The new dormitories will follow
the Italian Renaissance style of ar
chitecture. They will have red tiles
and brown walls of reinforced con
crete, and will correspond with the
general architectural and color scheme
of the University. P. J. Walker &
Co. are the contractors for the dorm
itories as well as for the new Library.
