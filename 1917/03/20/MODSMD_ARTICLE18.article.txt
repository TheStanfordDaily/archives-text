Money and energy are, through ignorance, being wasted in an at
tempt to stop the vivisection of a few dogs in the state of California.
It is surely a misplaced humanitarianism which prompts this move
ment to defeat the Prenderjyist bill in the legislature—a bill which
provides for the purchase of impounded dogs for experimental pur
poses, with a provision that anaesthetics will be used to render oper
ations painless. Aside from the fact that such experiments have and
will do great things for the human race, the element of cruelty in
vivisection is negligible. There is no pain, and at present these im
pounded dogs are killed and used as fertilizer, a service they can very
well render after first having served to increase our knowledge of
medical science. Further, that science depends on such experiment
for its development, and humanity depends on that development for
its deliverance from suffering and disease. Shall we sacrifice human
for dumb animals?
The great majority of Stanford people no doubt believe in and
favor vivisection. This is not an attempt to educate anyone. That is
probably unnecessary. Our opportunities of influencing the decision
are comparatively limited here, but each one of us can, to some ex
tent, help mould a public opinion against such misplaced efforts as
those being made to block the progress of medical science in Cali
fornia.
