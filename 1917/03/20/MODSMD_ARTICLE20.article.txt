## 
### 
Captain O. G. Lachmund and Grad
uate Manager Behrens have received
a flock of challenges and requests for
games with the rugby squad, which
began spring practice last week. The
College of the Pacific, which is also
holding spring training, is the latest
to ask for a match. Inasmuch as the
Pacific have no track or baseball
teams, and all their efforts will be
concentrated in developing a fast
squad, the Tigers will probably be the
strongest opponent this spring.
The challenge of the baseball squad
for a game at the conclusion of the
ball tossers' season is taken seriously
by the ruggers. Braden, Wilcox, Bihl
man, Wayland, Cass, Morse, .Toerg,
Mattel and Hoever are a few of the
experienced players who will line up
against the rugby squad.
Others who have asked for games
are Lowell and Oakland high schools
and a team picked from Palo Alto
high school and town.
