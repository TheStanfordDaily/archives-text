# VALE UNIVERSITY ASKS ALUMNI'S FINANCIAL HELP
## 
### 
Yale University has called upon its
alumni to stand behind the institution
in the crisis that is overtaking it.
Through expenditures incurred in
building new laboratories and financ
ing an Officers' Reserve Corps and
other military enterprises, the Uni
versity has run badly into debt, and
has asked the alumni to aid their
Alma Mater financially.
