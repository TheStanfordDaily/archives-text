and there was cake, and there was
negns, and there was a great piece
of cold roast, and there was a great

"Great stuff." said a holdover. "I
thought that bandstand was a frost
until now. Just hear that line:
"Plenty of beer."
A Daily reporter listened, and
his amazement turned to delight.
He took up the cue. "Where's the
beer?" he asked.
"Aw, there ain't none at all," re
plied the Demosthenes of the band
stand. "I'm just spieling out here
for grade points in vocal expres
sion."
