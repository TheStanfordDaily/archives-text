# Double Plays
## 
### 
Many surmises are being made by
the fans as to the team that will face
California next Saturday in the first
baseball same. A week ago, it would
have been far easier to guess the final
nine than it is now. There are at
least four doubtful places on the var
sity. Wilcox and Campbell are fight
ing it out for the position behind the
plate, Braden and Reagon are com
peting for second base, Wilkins, Bihl
man and Dickey are battling for left
field, and Noonan and Mitchell are
both trying for the right field berth.

Hayes, Cowan, Stevens and Lilly
are the men sure of their positions.
They will play first, short, third and
center respectively. It is not certain
which one of the varsity pitchers will
start against the Blue and Gold.
Those who have kept close tab on the
heavers, are positive that Bert Mattei
will face the Berkeley team next Sat
urday. There is no doubt but that
the speed ball pitcher has displayed
the best form recently.

Shriver is fast getting into shape,
but he will not be able to start against
California. His ankle is still weak,
and he cannot run fast. He will prob
ably be ablo to play in the last game
of the series.
*****
Joe Braden has an average of two
errors a game recorded against him.
Few of these are on fielding. Joe
generally fields cleanly all all balls
hit his direction, but his throwing to
the bases is very poor. It is his side
arm throw that makes his tosses un
reliable.
