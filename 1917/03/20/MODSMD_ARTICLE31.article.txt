# Underclassmen to Argue Industrial Arbitration
## 
### 
Postponement of the annual Fresh
men-Sophomore debate to tomorrow
at 3 o'clock, was made necessary
last Friday afternoon by the inability
of two of the members of the sopho
more team to be present at the time
planned. The debate will be held on
Wednesday next in room 12 of the Law
building. The question to be argued
is: "Resolved, That industrial dis
putes arising in industries employing
more than one hundred men should
be subjected to compulsory investiga
tion with a compulsory award."
The sophomore taem, composed of
G. J. Knight, C. V. Smith and M. Gold
stein, will uphold the question, while
the negative cause will be espoused
by the 1920 squad, consisting of A. R.
J. Albouze, H. A. Davis and J. T. Mc-
Menamin. The freshmen class has
awarded pins to the members of their
team, and the sophomore class also
offers pins to their representatives
in the event that they win in the com
| ing contets.
