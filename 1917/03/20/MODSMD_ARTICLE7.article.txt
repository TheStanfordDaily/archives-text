JUNIOR WEEK starts just a week
from tomorrow evening, and from
the way plans of the various com
mittees have been progressing, 1918 is
going to stage a program of events
that will equal if it does not eclipse
the records made by previous classes.
Concert, fireworks, opera, lake sports,
athletic contests and prom will fill
the 191S Junior Week full to the brim
with real, bona-fide entertainment for
queeners and roughs.
Kevins Wednesday.
Wednesday evening, March 25, at 7
o'clock, Lagunita will he the scene of
many and varied fireworks, which
promise to excel any that have ever
been seen at Stanford. The Glee
Club, the Band and Mandolin Club
will each do their share toward en
tertaining the throng with good music.
Junior Opera Thursday.
Thursday evening the Junior Opera
will hold the boards of the Assembly
Hall and local talent in composing,
acting and directing will prove its
ability. .T. R. Morgan, cx-'17, who is
in charge of the opera, is very en
thusiastic about the outcome.
March 30, Junior Day, has been de
clared a holiday, and will be well
filled with exciting events. At 10 a.m.
sports on the lake will start, and ad
ded interest will be aroused in the an
nouncement that the girls are to par
ticipate in the contests as well as the
men. There will be canoe tilting and
racing contests and swimming races,
for which the winning women will
probably be rewarded with a box of
chocolates.
The same contests will be given
for the men, with the addition of the
interclass crew race. Prizes for the
winners of the contests will be pro
vided by the merchants of Palo Alto.
Friday afternoon the University of
Southern California and the Los An
geles Athletic Club will unite against
the varsity track team.
The climax of social affairs of the
week will come with the Junior Prom
on Friday night, in the gymnasium.
The programs will be something new
and will have a decidedly local touch
to them. Dancing will, in all prob
abilities, extend beyond 1 o'clock.
Only 125 tickets will be sold for the
Prom so it behooves all who wish to
go to secure their tickets early .
