# Publishing as a Profession Told of by Ellsworth
## 
### 
"Publishing as a profession is a fit
occupation for a man wlio wants to
keep himself a gentleman," is the be
lief of William Webster Ellsworth,
president of the Century Company,
who spoke on "Publishing and Litera
ture" in the Little Theater last night.
Mr. Ellsworth has been engaged in
this kind of work for forty years, and
has made the acquaintance of many of
the most prominent writers in Amer
ica and England during that time.
The publicist spent most of his
time last evening in giving little char
acter sketches of such men as Grant,
Sherman, Mark Twain, Bret Harte,
"Bayard Taylor, Rudyard Kipling, Walt
Whitman, Robert Louis Stevenson,
and present day writers of less im
portance, with whom he was person
ally acquainted. He showed by com
parison that the age in which Dickens
and his contemporaries wrote brought
forth many more valuable and long
lived books than any period since. He
also pointed out the fact that from
$250 to $500 was considered a good
price for a book a half-century ago,
while not long ago Bret Harte was
paid $10,000 for"The Luck of Roaring
Camp," which was only a short story.
Ellsworth gave a detailed account of
the expenses connected with the pub
lication of a $1.35 book, showing that
the publishers made ony ten per cent
profit on a book that sells fairly well.
"Young journalists have asked me
if writing for college publications
will help them in their profession,"
said Ellsworth, in concluding. "If
you will look up the records of such
men as Emerson you will find that
many prominent writers gained their
interest for writing in such work, and
got their start in this way. But you
must remember that re-writing is one
of the essentials for success. Kipling
does this more than any other author
I know of; but all great geniuses fill
the waste baskets many times over
with material that they are re
writing."
