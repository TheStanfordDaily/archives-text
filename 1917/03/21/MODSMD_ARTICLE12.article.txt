"Struggle de Dansant" is what the

Saturday night. The dance will be
in the nature of a jolly-up, and will
probably be held in the Women's Club
House. The admission will be fifty
cents per couple. According to ad
vance information there will be plenty
of eats and good music.
President D. M. Smith will an
nounce the dance committee at a meet
