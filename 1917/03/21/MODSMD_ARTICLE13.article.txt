Gin, Chinese cook at the Phi Delta
Theta house, received a message at
about 3 o'clock this afternoon that
the Sooy-Yin tong had put a price on
his head, and that he had better leave
the campus immediately. Gin is a
member of the Hop-Sing tong, which
has only two members on the campus,
while the Sooy-Yin has approximately
five hundred members in Mayfield,
Palo Alto and the campus.
Gin, very luckily, had a good friend
in the Sooy-Yin tong, and this after
noon received a message from that
friend that a price had been placed
on his head and that the Sooy-Yins
were out to get him.
In order to avoid actual shooting on
the premises, the Phi 'Delta Theta
men have arranged a job for Gin, out
of this vicinity, and are sending him
away immediately. The other Hop-
Sing man on the campus is unknown,
and practically all the other servants
on the campus are members of Sooy-
Yin Tong.
