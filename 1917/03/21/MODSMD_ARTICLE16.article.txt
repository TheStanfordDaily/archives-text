# Name Chairman for Debate With Oregon
## S.I. Miller to Preside at Discussion in Little Theatre Friday 
### 
Professor Stephen Ivan Miller of
the Economics department has been
selected to act as chairman of the
Stanford-University of Oregon debate.
The selection came as a result of con
ferences between the Oregon repre
sentative, C. C. Baker, and J. F. Elden,
chairman of the debating committee.
Final preparation for the two men
who will debate against the Univer
sity of Oregon will be made tomorrow
when Coach Karl Leib, '15, and A. J.
Hettinger, 'lfi, take the negative of the
arbitration question against the Stan
ford team, and point out in their argu
ments the weaknesses of the Cardinal
debaters. The afllrmative representa
tives are J. R. Brokenshire, '19, and
A. G. Westwick, '18.
Coach Leib has announced that no
admission is to be charged for the
forensic contest, and for this reason
expects a record turn-out at the Little
Theater. This debate is scheduled to
start at 7:30, although it may be
changed to 8 o'clock.
Labor leaders of San Francisco are
very much interested in a presenta
tion of the capital and labor ques
tion in this debate, and several of
them are coming down Friday, accord
ing to letters received by Coach Leib.
This contest has unusually long
speeches and the whole case for and
against compulsory arbitration will be
presented in full.
The specific question for argument
is, "Resolved, That industrial disputes
affecting one hundred or more men
should be subject to compulsory arbi
tration with a compulsory award."
