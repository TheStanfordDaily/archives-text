# AN ASSEMBLY REVIVER
## 
### 
Attendance at the weekly assemblies so far this year has not jus
tified setting aside a free hour each Thursday morning. Although,
with a few exceptions, the talks scheduled have been well worth hear
ing, the talkers have addressed a goodly number of empty seats. On
only two or three occasions has there been anything like a crowd at
these meetings. We believe there is enough value in gathering to
hear good speakers on various subjects of interest, to warrant the
holding of assemblies each week, but it hardly worth while unless
more interest is shown among the students.
It seems to us that most of the vacant chairs are due to the hour
at which assemblies are held. When J. 1 o'clock comes, and there is
nothing imperative to hold students on the quad, it is natural that
mapy should follow the line of least resistance and go home, unless
there is something exceptionally promising scheduled for the hour.
We may realize that it would be better for us to go to the assembly,
but we don't often do the thing that is best for us when it is not also
the easiest. Should assemblies be held at 10 o'clock instead of 11,
with classes following, there would not be such a temptation to go
home. If, as we think, there is enough good in such meetings to
warrant an attempt to stimulate interest in them, this change would
undoubtedly help. It is probably impossible to shift the hour this
semester, but it might be considered in making out the schedule for
next fall.
