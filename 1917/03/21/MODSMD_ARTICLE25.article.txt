Seventeen new baseball suits ar
rived on the campus yesterday for the
Cardinal tossers. The uniforms are
somewhat the same pattern as the
1!)16 suits, and are made of better
material. The caps will look neater
than last season's headgear, as they
arc of a slightly different style. The
suits have been given out to Captain
Hayes, Hoever, Mattei, Draper, Camp
bell, Wilcox, Braden, Shriver, Cowan,
Stevens, Reagon, Dickey, Wilkins,
Bililman, Lilly, Noonan and Mitchell.

The University of California varsity
baseball squad will work out on the
Stanford diamond tomorrow afternoon
at 2:30. The whole squad will make
the trip to the campus, as Coach Zain
lock wants the team to become famil
iar with the local lot.

Zanilock has announced the team
that will face the Cardinal next Sat
urday. Dimock will start on the
mound, with Gimbal receiving. Star
bird will play first, Davidson will
cover second, Claude Itohwer will hold
down short, Smith will handle third,
Ray Rohwer will be stationed in left.
Captain Adair in center, and Works
in right field. This is a strong lineup,
i and a hard hitting aggregation. Mc-
I Cabe, Hill and Hall are named as the
! substitute pitchers, while Vecki may
I be sent in as a pinch hitter if needed.

The afternoon's game with St. Ig
j natius will be the last tryout for the
Cardinal players. Hayes will experi

Draper and Hoever are both in good
| condition now and will probably work
:in the second and third games with
: California. If Mattei wins his initial
j contest, he will undoubtedly start the
! third -game. Reports from Berkeley
j indicate that they expect Dimock to
; pitch three games, and if live are
: necessary, McCabe and Hill will
handle the other two.
