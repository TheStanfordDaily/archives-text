# Will Not Decrease Size of 1918 Quad
## 
### 
In spite of the fact that there will
be no advertisements in the 1918
Quad there will be no reduction in the
number of pages of reading matter,
despite vague rumors to the contrary,
according to a statement issued today
by Manager F. W. Weeks, '18. The
number of pages devoted to the vari
ous departments of the year-book will
at least equal if they do not excel
that of last year's Quad, which was
the largest published.
Not only will the '18 book surpass
previous Quads in size but a higher
standard of quality will prevail in
every department. Nine four-color
half-tone plates will form one of the
exclusive features of this year's an
nual. There will be more and better
engravings, which will boost the cost
materially, and there will be special
mounts and fly-leaves for all color
work.
This superiority of quality, coupled
with the increased cost of publication
and with the loss of revenue result
ing from the elimination of advertis
ing, completely justifies the raise in
price from $2.50 to $3.50, authorized
by the Executive Committee, the Quad
management believes.
At California, the Blue and Gold
has announced a tentative raise from
$3 to $3.50 a copy.
