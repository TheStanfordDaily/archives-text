# Reward of $100 Comes as Result of Fall in City
## 
### 
Philosophers have said that "Pride
goeth before a fall," but have ne
glected to relate what happened after
a fall. It remained for Warham Met
calf Noble, '19, to discover for him
self what really occurs, and as a re
sult of his discovery he is richer by
exactly $85, after deducting all his
expenses for a week-end jaunt to
Francisco. it is admitted that the
city is an awful place in which to
fall; but not when it means $85 in
your pocket.
Noble was skipping along the street
where Third touches Market, when
his foot came in contact with a raised
paving stone, and he precipitated him
self at full length along the street.
Regaining his breath and enough en
ergy to look around he saw a spark
ling object near his hand. He found
it was a monster stick-pin, the dia
mond of which weighed one and one
quarter carats.
In the "Lost and Found" column of
a paper and saw a reward of $100 was
offered for the pin's return. He broke
all speed records in finding the owner,
took a death-grip on the $100, and
then celebrated. Counting up after he
reached the campus he found his ex
penses totaled exactly $15, leaving him
a credit balance of $85.
