# Opera Features the Spanish Fandango
## South Sea Gives Atmosphere to "A Pirate for a Day" Coming March 29 
### 
Only nine days remain before the
footlights flash and the curtain rises
at the Assembly Hall stage, ready for
the opening chorus of "A Pirate For
A Day." The opening includes three
of the best songs of the show and it
is at that time that the pony and
middle choruses show off to the best
advantage.
South Seas Atmosphere.
"The Serenade" is one in which the
modern conception of a Spanish fan
dango is included, which gives all the
atmosphere needed for a play of the
South Seas. The effective costumes
worn by the Senorltas are Spanish,
but futuristic in style. Another fam
ous-to-be melody will be "Palm Trees
Sway in the Breeze," in which the
same choruses participate.
Specialty In Second Act.
At the entrance of June Adair, the
role taken by Miss Isabelle Young, the
beauty chorus enters. Their specialty
skit, however, conies in the second act
with Dick Maddeck, who as the young
American supposedly traveling for his
health, shows no serious symptoms
when the beauties are about.
The principals and the chorus will
rehearse together tonight for the first
time. Both have rehearsed separately
until now, but owing to the perfection
which has been reached, the combina
tion can be accomplished earlier than
usual. Previously, it has been only
during the last five days that the en
tire cast has rehearsed.
The pictures of the cast are being
taken this afternoon at Assembly Hall
with the scenic background which
will be used in the show March 29.
These will be on display in a few
days. Tickets for the production will
go on sale at the Bookstore and Wein
gartner's, on Monday, March 26.
