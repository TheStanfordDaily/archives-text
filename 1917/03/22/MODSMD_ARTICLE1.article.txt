## PRESIDENT APPROVES Upperclassmen and Faculty Are Unanimous in Adoption of Self Regulation

the proposed honor system for the
Chemistry department, which had pre
viously been unanimously adopted by
the fifty-three uppperclass students of
the department and by the department
faculty.
To Prevent Cheating.
The object of the organization,
which will be effected by the election
of officers within a few days, is, as
the constitution provides, "To elim

department, to the end that the ex
isting confidence between the Chem
istry faculty and students may be pre

from Stanford may never lose its
value as a true recommendation."
To Sign Allegiance Card.
In order to carry out its stated ob
ject the constitution further pro
vides for an organization of all the
upperclass students in the depart
ment, although later on, if deemed
feasible, underclassmen will likewise
be admitted. To announce allegiance
to the system students will be asked
to sign a printed blank declaring their
acceptance of the principles and
method proposed. This will be bind
ing on the signer during the entire
period of his college course, unless by
writing he expressly renounces his
allegiance.
To carry out the objects of the or
ganization a Standing Administration
committee composed of three senior
or graduate students and two junior
students, will be elected by the mem
bers of the organization.
The standing committee will be em
powered to receive all information re
garding dishonorable practices and to
investigate each case reported. Its
powers of discipline will be fourfold.
It may reprimand and give advice,
request cancellation of registration in
the department in serious cases, lay
the case before a mass meeting of
students enrolled under the honor
system, report its findings and recom
mend action to the Student Council
of the University, the department fac
ulty, or the President of the Univer
sity.
Last semester a committee of three
students of the Chemistry department
were appointed at a mass meeting to
draw up a constitution. This com
mittee was composed of R. N. Wenzel,
'16, L. D. Gardner, '17, and K. M.
Henry, '18. The result is the pro
posed honor system which has now
been adopted and sanctioned.
The Student. Council will consider
the means of assisting the committee
of the Chemistry department in carry
ing out the provisions of the honor
system.

The object of the organization,
which will be effected by the election
of officers within a few days, is, as
the constitution provides, "To elim

department, to the end that the ex
isting confidence between the Chem
istry faculty and students may be pre
served and that the Chemistry degree
from Stanford may never lose its
value as a true recommendation."
