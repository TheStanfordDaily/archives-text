# Pan-Hellenic Given More Rushing Time
## 
### 
Women's Conference granted two j
days, Wednesday and Thursday, oi l
Conference Week, which is the closed I
week at the beginning of the fall se-I
mester, to Pan-Hellenic, at the meet-'
ing held last night. There-is to be no
rushing on Matriculation Day as this
is to be under the control of the Spon
ser system as in the previous years.
Pan-Hellenic asked for the two
days in order that all formal rushing
would lie over by the time actual Uni
versity work started. Although Pan-
Hellenic has not denitely stated, it is
probable that "Bidding Day" will be
Friday of the first week. The "Law
yer System," which was used last
year, will be in effect this fall.
