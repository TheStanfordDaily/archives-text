# TELLS OF GREAT OPPORTUNITIES IN CHINA
## J.H. ARNOLD SPEAKER Commercial Attache of American Legation Tells of China's Awakening 
### 
day is not far distant when
the great commercial arena
will have shifted from the
Atlantic Coast to the Pacific Coats,"
.lulean H. Arnold stated this morning
in an address before a University as
sembly in Assembly Hall, during the
course of his lecture on "American
Opportunities in China."
Cliina Wants to Develop.
Mr. Arnold, who is Commercial At
tache of the American Legation in
Pekin, declared that China will be
probably the largest factor in the
shifting of the commerce which is
bound to come. "The China of today,"
he said, "is receptive; it wants to de
velop its great store of mineral
wealth. China is today where Eng
land was one hundred and fifty years
ago; it is at the beginning of the
factory age. The machine is a new
thing in China. We cannot conceive
what the next thirty years will byng
in China."
Speaking of the great opportunities
that await Americans who "have taken
a renewed interest in the develop-
ment of China," Mr. Arnold declared
that Americans have peculiar advant-
ages in China which is our greatest
commercial asset. "There are no peo-
pie on the face of the earth who are
so favorably looked on in China as
Americans," he said. "The idea of
American friendliness has permeated
the whole mass of Chinese."
In appealing to Americans and fcs
pecially to Californians, to recognize .
and share in the great development
that is the result of an awakened
China, the speaker declared that "if
I we want our share in the develop
ment of China we must advance cap
ital, material and skill." He further
declared that "our greatest future lies
across the Pacific and not in South
America."
