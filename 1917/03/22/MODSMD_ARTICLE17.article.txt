# PROCESS OF EDUCATION
## 
### 
Stanford is gradually educating itself up to the honor system,
and will some day wake up to the fact that it is applied to the en
tire University, and this without the shock of suddenly declaring it
to be in force without due preparation. The action of the Chemistry
department is a step toward that education. We could not today, by
votiug to have the honor system, make it exist in fact. It takes time
to accomplish such things, and Stanford is not yet ready. Several
departments have now adopted the system, however, and that seems
to point toward a solution of the question. We must first work it out
in smaller groups, and as more of these join in the movement, we
will in time have all of Stanford under the system.

Stanford debaters hold forth in the Little Theater tomorrow eve
ning against the University of Oregon on a subject of great interest
and importance to the economic and industrial world. In the general
rush of more popular pastimes, attendance at a forensic contest is too
apt to be meager. We tend to underrate a war of words. Tomorrow
night's debate will not perhaps be Ihe headline!*, considering the fact
that the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra is giving a concert in
Assembly Hall. The Tri-State contest is, however, one of the biggest
deflates of the year and will undoubtedly prove interesting and well
worth while. Furthermore, there is no charge for admission, which
has been known to make a difference with some of us.
