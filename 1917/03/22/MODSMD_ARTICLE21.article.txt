TWO MINITES OF DRAMA.
Characters—Noah Nix, campus cor
respondent, sitting in the Dink Dink
house, <iiml some fraternity brothers.
Acting begins.
Noah Nix—Prithee, thee, Jones,
these be hard times. Nothing diddest
at all to make news therefrom. 1
fear 1 may have to borrow from thee
each enough for substance whereon
to feed.
One Brother —Get thee tuhell, thou
bum. Thou art too lazy to work.
Noah N —Naw, there doest nothing.
A correspondent is outa luck. (He
falls to sleep.)
Action prolonged—While lie sleeps,
Hum Lung, the Chink, speeds through
(lie room, with forty-nine other Chink
cooks speeding after him, shooting and
brandishing knives.
Bum Lung—Golly Mose, Golly Mose.
Helpee, helpee poor Chinee boy cook.
Other Chinks—Shootem, killem, cut
'em. Velly bad Chinaman.
(Noah still sleeps. Two D. P. A.
reporters rush in, and wake Noah.)
Reporters—Hie thee, sleeper; what's
the dope on this tong war? Give us
the dope, quick!
Noah —Nothing up here. All's quiet.
No news at all. Tuff luck for the cor
respondent. Quiet as a graveyard.
Wish something would happen.
Reporters—Aw, you correspondents
wouldn't know if the quad burned
down. We'll find the dope from some
one else.
Noah —Well, it's about time you D.
P. A. guys were stirring up something
that the city papers can use.
(Thus Endeth the Drama.)
Conclusion — Noah (reading The
Daily next morning)— Well I'll he
darned. Who'd have tliunk there was
a story so near.
