# Declare U.C. Ball Player Ineligible
## 
### 
University of California's varsity
baseball team was seriously crippled
yesterday for the intercollegiate ser
ies with Stanford when R. C. Davison,
second sacker, was declared ineligible
for the series on account of a schol
astic ruling. Claude Rohwer will
probably shift over to cover Davison's
position at second, while Hudson or
Morse will attempt to fill Rohwer's
shoes at short.
