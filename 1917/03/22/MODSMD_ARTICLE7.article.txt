WITH two exceptions .California
sends a veteran nine against
I Stanford in the opening con
test of a five-game series, on the
Cardinal diamond next Saturday. A
month ago, Coach Zaraloch decided
011 his lineup, and since that time no
shift has been made or will be made
during the series, unless an accident
causes a substitution.
Dimock (hi Mound.
The team that meets Stanford fol
lows: Gimbal, catcher; Dimock,
pitcher; Starbird, first base; Davison,
second base; Claude Rohwer, short;
Smith, third base; R. Rohwer, left
field; Adair, center field; Worlds, right
field.
Lose Practice Games.
California has been slow in round
ing into condition and as a result has
lost a majority of its practice games.
The Blue and Gold has won one and
lost one from the Olympic Club, and
to date has won one from St. Mary's.
Both of these teams played Stanford.
Three games were lost to the Oakland
Coast League and several to various
"bush" organizations about the bay.
When the season opened seven
j members of last year's victorious
J combination reported. They are
Dimock, Starbird, C. Kohwer, Smith,
It. Rohwer, Adair, and Works. To til 1
the position behind the bat, made
vacant by the graduation of Catcher
Furlong, Ray Gimbal, a second string
man, was selected. Edwards, another
second string man, is acting as under
study to Gimbal.
Shift Kohwer to Short,
Coach Zamloch's difficult task was
finding a man to play short stop.
Claude Rohwer was finally shifted to
this position from second, and Dav
ison, a recruit, sent in at second. So
far, Davison has played his position
satisfactorily and was therefore se
lected for the big series.
Vecki, outfielder last year, is play
ing the bench this season, by reason
of the return to the game of Captain
Adair. During practice last year,
Adair sustained a fractured ankle and
was therefore out of the game. Early
this season it was feared that he
would be unable to play, owing to the
ankle.
Dimock, the southpaw, who pitched
California to victory in two out of
three games last year, is again on the
hurling hill for California. Dimock
I pitched the entire series of three
games last year and it is probable
that he will do the majority of the
heavy work again this season. Mc-
Cabe, a second stringer last season;
Hall, a transfer from Occidental Col
lege, and Hill, last year's freshman,
are held in reserve in case of emer
gency.
California is depending on Ray Roh
wer for the hits that mean runs.
Rohwer is batting "clean up," and has
been regularly clouting the ball for
extra bases during practice games.
The Blue and Gold team leaves for
Stanford, Thursday noon, to hold a
workout on the Cardinal diamond.
