# Sophomores Defeat Freshmen Debaters
## Sophomores Win Strike Argument From Freshmen by 2-1 Decision 
### 
Contending that strikes are an eco
nomic waste, causing needless de
struction of life and property, the
sophomoer out-argued the freshmen
debaters in the annual underclass do
bate, yesterday afternoon, Dy a two to
one decision. The debate was hotly
contested throughout, and it was
| largely Knight's rebuttal thai saved
! the day for the 1!)1!Â» team.
The question was, "Resolved, That
industrial disputes arising in indus
tries employing more than one hun
dred men should be subjected to cora
-1 pulsory investigation with a compul
| sory award."
The sophomore team .consisting of
jG. Knight, C. V. Smith and M. Gold
! stein, pointed out that there is need
' of a change from the present waste
ful system, which permits of indus
trial strikes in which men are killed
and property is destroyed. They ad
vocated a plan which, they claimed,
would give justice to all, by establish
ing a board of arbitration which
could give a compulsory award, ac
cording to the principle involved in
tli e New Zealand and Denmark sys
tems. This would bring the people,
capital, and labor together, with equal
representation for each party.
To remove the fundamental causes
of strikes, by a program of social leg
islation, was the plan advocated by
the freshmen team, consisting of A. 11.
.1. Albouze, 11. A. Davis and.1. T. Mc-
Menamin.
