What is recreation for the tired
business man may also be a life-saver
for the notoriously over-worked col
lege student who has survived a week
of examinations. That is the propo
sition which the seniors have under
taken to establish on May 16, the last
day of ex-week, when they present
Fred Jackson's three-act, rapid-fire
farce, "A Full House." Tryouts will
be held in the Women's Club House,
Monday, from 3 to 6, before Frank L.
Mathieu..

The production is a fun-provoking
farce, pure and simple, without any
higher purpose than that of bringing
a laugh. Its action is of the "fast-as
lightning" variety, allowing each of
(he fourteen parts a full opportunity
to aid in the gaiety of the occasion.
Coach Mathieu will be the sole judge
in Monday's tryouts, which are open
to aspirants of all classes. He will
select the parts as soon as possible
so that rehearsals may be gotten un
der way before vacation.
