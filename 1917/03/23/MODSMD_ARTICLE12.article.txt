# STANFORD DOWNS WASHINGTON ORATORS
## OREGON MEN ARRIVE Economics Head Requests Students to Hear Labor Argument This Evening 
### 
STANFORD won the first of the
Tri-State debates from the Uni
versity of Washington last night
by a two to one decision. The sec
ond forensic contest will come tonight
when representatives of the Univer
sity of Oregon argue the Cardinal
team in the Little Theater.
F. S. Field, '18, and W. L. Miller,
'17, were the two men who were suc
cessful at Seattle. According to re
ports from the northern university,
the debate was very close and hinged
on the refutation and experience of
the Stanford men.
Shortall Third Judge.
Edwin T. Shortall, member of the
superior court of San Francisco, has
been selected as the third man to act
as judge in the debate tonight. The
other two judges are Judge Sturte
vant, also of the superior court, and
Judge Parker, member of the bar in
Mono county, and at present holding
extra session of court in San Fran
cisco.
Stephen Ivan Miller, assistant pro
fessor in the Economics department,
will preside in the debate with Ore
gon.
The Stanford team is in the best of
shape for the arguments in their con
test. A. J. Hettinger, '16, forensic
veteran, and Coach Leib, put the men
through a final workout last night in
a practice debate. Although arguing
against experienced men, A. G. West
wick, '18, and J. R. Rrokenshire, '19,
showed that they had a complete
grasp of the question by successfully
meeting all the arguments put up to
them.
Believing that the debate will be of
great value to students in his depart
ment, Professor M. S. Wildman, head
of the Economics school, issued a
statement today, requesting everyone
in Economic classes to attend the con
test tonight if possible.
The specific question for argument
is, "Resolved, That industrial dis
putes affecting one hundred or more
men should be subject to compulsory
arbitration with a compulsory award."
