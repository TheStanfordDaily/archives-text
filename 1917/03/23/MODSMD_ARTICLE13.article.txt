# French Club Adopts Baby Boy and Girl
## Money Realized Last Week From Plays Will Support Two Children 
### 
Stanford's French Club is a fond
parent. The French Club now has a
family. Two little children, a boy and
a girl, were adopted yesterday by John
A. Sellards of the French department
faculty, on behalf of the local organ
ization, of which he is president.
The French Club's little kidlots are
Daniel Ramecourt, age 4, of Lapug
non, and little Miss Raymonde Reant,
age G years, of Allonagne, both of
these towns being in the French prov
ince of Pas de Calais.
Daddies Killed in War.
The little youngsters both lost their
fathers in the war, along with thous
ands of others. The French Club
realized eighty dollars from its play
last week, enough to keep Daniel and
Raymonde in clothes and food for a
year.
In all probability neither Daniel nor
Raymonde know they have been
adopted yet. The world still looks
pretty dark to them, without the
"daddies" they know. They were
picked from a long list of pages and
pages of names of fatherless French
children, all of them named very
much the same.
Tt was just luck that Daniel and
petite little Miss Raymonde will be
children of the Stanford French Club.
That is part of the fortune of war.
But the little boy and little girl will
soon know where their bread and but
ter comes from, for the French Club
is to correspond with their guardians
in France directly.
