# To Revive Roughs' Day on Thursday of Junior Week
## 
### 
Thursday of Junior Week lias been
proclaimed "Roughs' Day,"and as in
the "gold old days of yore" all the
men will dig up the oldest clothes
they possess and do all they can to
present just as disreputable an ap
pearance as possible. This custom
was followed out every year for a
long time, but has almost passed into
the shades of oblivion, and this is an
attempt to revive it.
