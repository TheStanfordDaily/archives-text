There are many things about this old farm which are character
istic of Stanfordâ€”some of them more so than others. One of the
more-so is the sight of any number of men of foreign extraction
standing about on the estate with hoes in their hands. If you hap
pen to be going by on one of the Peninsula Railway Company's
swift cars that is all you will see. If walking, you may possibly be
surprised to observe a slight movement in the hoeing end of the hoe,
for these men are chopping weed. By actual count, it has been
proved that they chop at least once an hour. They are satisfied with
that.
Now, as we say, this is one of the characteristic things about
Stanford, and we would all, no doubt, miss the sight. There are good
characteristics, however, and there are bad ones, and we can see no
reason why these odd jobs about the estate should not be given to
students. It seems altogether probable to us that students who need
the jobs could be found, particularly during these hard times, and
that they might possibly through the motions of hoeing once every
half-hour, at least. It is unreasonable, of course, to expect the Uni
versity to hire students for steady jobs, but surely they could be
utilized for some of the short season work. We would like to see it
tried.
