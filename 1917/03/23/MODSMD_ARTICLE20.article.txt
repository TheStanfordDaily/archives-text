Dramatic and other organizations
posting placards around the campus
as a means of advertising, will be
compelled from now on to take down
their placards when useless. This
follows as the result of action taken
last night by the Men's Conference,
when H. H. Hastings, '15, was ap
pointed chairman of a committee to
see that this rule is enforced. Any
infractions of this rule will cause the
offender to be liable to discipline.
Conference acted unfavorably on a
plan submitted to begin classes next
semester at 8 o'clock, which would
allow a twenty-five minute interval
between the 8 and 9 o'clock classes.
This period would be open to meet
ings of any sort that might arise.
The sentiment of the body was that
this period would probably prove in
sufficient time for the transaction of
business.
Unfavorable action was also taken
in a Communication received from
the Women's Conference for the for
mation of a joint committee to censor
Quad jokes. It was felt that this was
useless, and the sense of the Confer
ence was that the editors of the Quad
should be held to the degree of ac
curacy required of other campus pub
lications.
A communication was received from
Dr. H. it. Stolz, physical director,
stating that some of the people who
were swimming Sunday mornings
were not observing the sanitary regu
lations in regard to taking of show
ers. Dr. Stolz added that hot water
for the showers would be available on
Sunday mornings from now on. Con
ference decided that people ought to
be warned about observing the san
itary regulations, which were for the
good of all. It.was felt that the hot.
water from now on would also prob
ably result in the regulations being
strictly obeyed.
