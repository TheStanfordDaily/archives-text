There lias been much criticism
during the last few years of the man
ner in which "Hail, Stanford, Hail"
has been sung. A stirring hymn has
degenerated into a mournful wail.
But that is nothing new. We all
know it and realize the fact, and
would like to hear the song sung as
it should be sung. But it is obvious
that a large group cannot leave the
old way for the new without leader
ship. Would it not be a wise move to
have the proper leadership?
Every time the Glee Club has sung
"Hail, Stanford, Hail," we have been
thrilled, and when they have led in
the singing the rest of the audience
followed them. Would it not be a
good idea to have the Glee Club, or
part of it, present at all the Thursday
assemblies, rallies, games, and other
occasions where "Hail, Stanford,
Hail," is to be sung? They could
then lead in the singing of our hymn
and by the end of the semester we
would all have forgotten the funeral
dirge version, and will have learned
how to sing the song as it should be
sung.
It would not be asking too much to
have the Glee Club on hand, or at
least part of it, on the occasions when
our hymn is to be sung, and the pres
ence of our trained songsters in the
front seats at the assemblies will
have a tendency to coax the rest of
us a bit forward.
