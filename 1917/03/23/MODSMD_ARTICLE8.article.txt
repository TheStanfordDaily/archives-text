# DIAMOND BATTLE TOMORROW
## Stanford and California to Meet on Cardinal Lot in First Intercollegiate Ball Game 
### 
STANFORD and the University of
California baseball teams take the
Cardinal diamond tomorrow after
noon at 3 o'clock for the first game
of the annual intercollegiate series.

Both nines
have been
named, a r -
rang ements
have been
made to handle
a record
crowd, and the
only thing Re
maining to be
is for the
umpire to give
the "play ball"
signal.
Captain 'Doc'
Hayes today
announced the
Stanford team
that will op-

pose the Blve and Gold. Bert Mattel
will pitch, with Campbell receiving
him. Hayes will play first, Braden
second, Stevens third, and Cowan will
complete the infield at short. Dickey,
Lilly and Mitchell will cover the out
field. Hoever and Draper have been
named as substitute pitchers. Wilcox
will be on the bench to take Camp
bell's place if called. Shriver and
Reagon are listed as substitute in
fielders, while Noonan, Wilkins and
Bililman will be on the sidelines,
ready to go into the outfield if
needed.
California Lineup.
California will take the diamond in
the following order: Dimock on the

i mound, Gimbal catching, Starbird on
! lir.st, Morse at second, Smith on third,
1 and C. Rohwer at short. Works, R.
Itohwer and Captain Sammy Adair
will handle the fly-balls in the outer
gardens. Ball, McCabe and Hill are
slated to handle the relief pitching,
while Edwards will be on hand to fill
in behind the plate if Gimbal is taken
out. With Davison declared ineli
gible, the Blue and Gold have but two
dependable utility men. These are
Vicki and Parrish, who played against
Stanford last season.
Hililebrand to Indicate,
Graduate Managers Behrens and
Stroud have obtained the services of
George Hildebrand the famous major
league umpire, to handle the indi
cator in the Big Series. No better
man could have been selected than
Hildebrand, and the rival teams are
now sure of all decisions being called
in the best possible way.
Both the Stanford and California
bands will be on hand to liven up the

game. The Blue and
iGold rooters are com
jing to the campus in
[force, and according
jto the early informa
tion, seats will be at
a premium in the
| bleachers tomorrow.
The Berkeley delega
tion will occupy the
west side of the
bleachers, immediate
ly behind the pit that
their team will use.

Stanford followers will take the east
side of the bleacher section.


Captain Hayes.


Kay Roliwer.
Admission to the game will be fifty
cents. Series tickets are being sold
for one dollar. Season tickets will
not admit. As there are no other
counter attractions, the track meet
being finished at 3 o'clock, the man
agers expect the bleachers to be filled.
It' the seating space in the bleachers
is not sufficient to handle the crowd,
some of the ground in right field will
be turned over to the fans. This was
the case last year, and ground rules
were in force during the contest.
There seems to be a feeling among
campus athletic followers unfamiliar
with baseball, that there is little
chance of the Stanford aggregation
winning from the speedy Bruins. It
is true that all of the early dope
points to a Blue and Gold victory,
but there are no cinches in baseball.
Critics who have watched both teams
in action have agreed that Stanford
has an excellent chance of copping
the 1917 title, and that with any
breaks, should carry off the long end
of the count in the initial contest.
Mattel has been twirling wonderful
baseball of late, and is confident of
being able to hold the hard-hitting
opponents. Dimock, on the contrary,
is about due for a lacing. The vet
erans on the local nine have been
sleeping with their bats, and have
placed the California southpaw on
their list of doomed tossers.
"Batter â€”up!"
