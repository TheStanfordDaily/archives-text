fhe southerners promise to furnish
the varsity with good competition, as
the combined teams of the University
and Athletic Club bring together some
good performers. Fred Kelly, the
champion hurdler, is scheduled to
compete under the colors of the Ath
letic Club. Little is known of the
caliber of the U. S. C. team except
that California defeated them easily
last week. However, they appeared to
have some good men on the track,
though they were weak in the field
events, a fact which enabled the Blue
and Gold in a large measure to ac
complish the feat. Beebe, the well
known half-miler, should make
Schnell and Scott extend themselves
to win. He will also probably com
pete in the quarter.
Stanford fans will watch with in
terest the result of the meet, for it is
the first outside competition that the
varsity has run up against this sea
son. The southern team is scheduled
to run a return meet with the Card
inal runners on the Stanford oval,
Junior Day.
