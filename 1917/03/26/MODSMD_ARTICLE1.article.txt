# DIMOCK DIMS CARD HOPES ON DIAMOND
## WIN FIRST GAME 5-2 Ray Rohwer Breaks Up Tie in Tenth Inning With His Usual Wallop By Neil H. Petree. 
### 
CALIFORNIA won the first game
of the 1917 baseball series from
Stanford last Saturday, on the
Cardinal diamond, by a 5 to 2 score.
The contest ran into extra innings,
the Blue and Gold only winning after
ten thrilling frames. Considered
purely from a baseball standpoint, the
struggle was high class, no glaring
errors being recorded, good hitting
livening up the ten spasms, and won
derful pitching featuring the play of
both squads.
Dimock Dimmed Cardinals.
As was the case last year, "Dimmy"
Dimock dimmed the hopes of the
Cardinal followers. He twirled an ex
cellent game, fanning eleven Stanford
batters, and turning back the hitters
when in dangerous holes. His work
was no better, however, than was that
of Bert Mattei, the local heaver. Mat
tei did not send a single batter back
to the bench via the strikeout route,
and walked four men, but he chucked
a game that will long be remembered.
Until the ninth inning he had things
his own way, and was probably pitch
ing better than his Berkeley rival. He
allowed but four hits during the whole
contest.
Ray Rohwer was the big hero for
the victors. He evened up the count
in the ninth inning with a long triple
over Mitchell's head, and in the tenth
frame he sent in two more tallies with
a single to center. Hudson, at second
base, was distinctly a star. He played
in the place vacated by Davidson, and
pulled some of the day's best play
ing.
Campbell Slams Homer.
Campbell was the find on the Card
inal delegation. The big catcher
handled Mattei's shoots in an experi
enced manner, and drove out two hits,
One a sharp single, and the other a
long home run in deep left field,
bringing in Stevens of him for
the only Stanford markers.
Every man on the local nine played
a brand of baseball that brought
cheers from the most pessimistic of
the generally unappreciative Stanford
fans. Cowan is charged with errors
at short, but he played a fine game.
He lost a throw from Braden, when
♦he fast sinking sun made it impos
sible for him to see the ball, and he
booted a grounder that was very close
to being an infield hit. The only
other errors were made by Captain
'Hayes, who seemed to have an off
day. "Doc" secured a nice single,
however.
No other runs were made until the
fifth frame, when California scored
6ne tally on a two-bagger by Star
bird, an out by Gimbal, and a walk
by Hudson, and a single by Dimock.
Stanford scored next in the seventh,
when with one down, Stevens doubled
and Campbell slammed out a homer.
California tied the count in the ninth
on a triple by R. Rohwer, and a
clever manipulation of the squeeze
play with Starbird at the plate.
Tenth liming All Kohwer's.
The tenth canto marked defeat for
the locals. Hudson walked, and went
to second on Cowan's muff of Braden's
throw, after the latter had cleanly
fielded Dimock's ground ball. Both
runners advanced on Morse's sacri
fice hit. Hudson scored on Adair's
bunt, all hands being safe. C. Roh
wer flew out to Campbell, but R.
Rohwer sent in two on a long single
to center. Works ended the inning by
flying out to Lilly.

CALIFORNIA won the first game
of the 1917 baseball series from
Stanford last Saturday, on the
Cardinal diamond, by a 5 to 2 score.
The contest ran into extra innings,
the Blue and Gold only winning after
ten thrilling frames. Considered
purely from a baseball standpoint, the
struggle was high class, no glaring
errors being recorded, good hitting
livening up the ten spasms, and won
derful pitching featuring the play of
both squads.
Dimock Dimmed Cardinals.
As was the case last year, "Dimmy"
Dimock dimmed the hopes of the
Cardinal followers. He twirled an ex
cellent game, fanning eleven Stanford
batters, and turning back the hitters
when in dangerous holes. His work
was no better, however, than was that
of Bert Mattei, the local heaver. Mat
tei did not send a single batter back
to the bench via the strikeout route,
and walked four men, but he chucked
a game that will long be remembered.
Until the ninth inning he had things
his own way, and was probably pitch
ing better than his Berkeley rival. He
allowed but four hits during the whole
contest.
Ray Rohwer was the big hero for
the victors. He evened up the count
in the ninth inning with a long triple
over Mitchell's head, and in the tenth
frame he sent in two more tallies with
a single to center. Hudson, at second
base, was distinctly a star. He played
in the place vacated by Davidson, and
pulled some of the day's best play
ing.
Campbell Slams Homer.
Campbell was the find on the Card
inal delegation. The big catcher
handled Mattei's shoots in an experi
enced manner, and drove out two hits,
One a sharp single, and the other a
long home run in deep left field,
bringing in Stevens of him for
the only Stanford markers.
Every man on the local nine played
a brand of baseball that brought
cheers from the most pessimistic of
the generally unappreciative Stanford
fans. Cowan is charged with errors
at short, but he played a fine game.
He lost a throw from Braden, when
♦he fast sinking sun made it impos
sible for him to see the ball, and he
booted a grounder that was very close
to being an infield hit. The only
other errors were made by Captain
'Hayes, who seemed to have an off
day. "Doc" secured a nice single,
however.
No other runs were made until the
fifth frame, when California scored
6ne tally on a two-bagger by Star
bird, an out by Gimbal, and a walk
by Hudson, and a single by Dimock.
Stanford scored next in the seventh,
when with one down, Stevens doubled
and Campbell slammed out a homer.
California tied the count in the ninth
on a triple by R. Rohwer, and a
clever manipulation of the squeeze
play with Starbird at the plate.
Tenth liming All Kohwer's.
The tenth canto marked defeat for
the locals. Hudson walked, and went
to second on Cowan's muff of Braden's
throw, after the latter had cleanly
fielded Dimock's ground ball. Both
runners advanced on Morse's sacri
fice hit. Hudson scored on Adair's
bunt, all hands being safe. C. Roh
wer flew out to Campbell, but R.
Rohwer sent in two on a long single
to center. Works ended the inning by
flying out to Lilly.

CALIFORNIA won the first game
of the 1917 baseball series from
Stanford last Saturday, on the
Cardinal diamond, by a 5 to 2 score.
The contest ran into extra innings,
the Blue and Gold only winning after
ten thrilling frames. Considered
purely from a baseball standpoint, the
struggle was high class, no glaring
errors being recorded, good hitting
livening up the ten spasms, and won
derful pitching featuring the play of
both squads.
Dimock Dimmed Cardinals.
As was the case last year, "Dimmy"
Dimock dimmed the hopes of the
Cardinal followers. He twirled an ex
cellent game, fanning eleven Stanford
batters, and turning back the hitters
when in dangerous holes. His work
was no better, however, than was that
of Bert Mattei, the local heaver. Mat
tei did not send a single batter back
to the bench via the strikeout route,
and walked four men, but he chucked
a game that will long be remembered.
Until the ninth inning he had things
his own way, and was probably pitch
ing better than his Berkeley rival. He
allowed but four hits during the whole
contest.
Ray Rohwer was the big hero for
the victors. He evened up the count
in the ninth inning with a long triple
over Mitchell's head, and in the tenth
frame he sent in two more tallies with
a single to center. Hudson, at second
base, was distinctly a star. He played
in the place vacated by Davidson, and
pulled some of the day's best play
ing.
Campbell Slams Homer.
Campbell was the find on the Card
inal delegation. The big catcher
handled Mattei's shoots in an experi
enced manner, and drove out two hits,
One a sharp single, and the other a
long home run in deep left field,
bringing in Stevens of him for
the only Stanford markers.
Every man on the local nine played
a brand of baseball that brought
cheers from the most pessimistic of
the generally unappreciative Stanford
fans. Cowan is charged with errors
at short, but he played a fine game.
He lost a throw from Braden, when
♦he fast sinking sun made it impos
sible for him to see the ball, and he
booted a grounder that was very close
to being an infield hit. The only
other errors were made by Captain
'Hayes, who seemed to have an off
day. "Doc" secured a nice single,
however.
No other runs were made until the
fifth frame, when California scored
6ne tally on a two-bagger by Star
bird, an out by Gimbal, and a walk
by Hudson, and a single by Dimock.
Stanford scored next in the seventh,
when with one down, Stevens doubled
and Campbell slammed out a homer.
California tied the count in the ninth
on a triple by R. Rohwer, and a
clever manipulation of the squeeze
play with Starbird at the plate.
Tenth liming All Kohwer's.
The tenth canto marked defeat for
the locals. Hudson walked, and went
to second on Cowan's muff of Braden's
throw, after the latter had cleanly
fielded Dimock's ground ball. Both
runners advanced on Morse's sacri
fice hit. Hudson scored on Adair's
bunt, all hands being safe. C. Roh
wer flew out to Campbell, but R.
Rohwer sent in two on a long single
to center. Works ended the inning by
flying out to Lilly.

to second on Cowan's muff of Braden's
throw, after the latter had cleanly
fielded Dimock's ground ball. Both
runners advanced on Morse's sacri
fice hit. Hudson scored on Adair's
bunt, all hands being safe. C. Roh
wer flew out to Campbell, but R.
Rohwer sent in two on a long single
to center. Works ended the inning by
flying out to Lilly.
