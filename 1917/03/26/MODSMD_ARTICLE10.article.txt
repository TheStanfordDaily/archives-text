Contending that Compulsory Arbi
tration of labor disputes would bring
injustice and contempt to the govern
ment, the University of Oregon was
victorious in the second Tri-State de
bate, Friday night. A combination of
lack of experience and poor refutation
was too much for the Cardinal. Their
more experienced opponents were
able, although not presenting the
mass of material, to put their points
over in fine shape, resulting in the
victory.
The Stanford representatives were
A. G. Westwick, '18, and J. R. Broken
shire, '19. The question for argument
was "Resolved, That labor disputes
affecting one hundred or more men
should be subject to compulsory arbi
tration with a compulsory award."
University of Washington won from
University of Oregon at Eugene. As
a result of this victory the three uni
versities are tied. A curious feature
of the series is that each visiting
team won on the negative side of the
question.
