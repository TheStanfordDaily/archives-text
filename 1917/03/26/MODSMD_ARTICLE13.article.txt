# ONE IS FOR WAR-OTHER WANTS PEACE
## WILBUR PLEADS DUTY Dr. Jordan's Fight for Peace in New York Smacks of Violence 
### 
LEADERSHIP in opinion on inter
national questions is not lacking
for followers of Stanford ideal
ists, as is evidenced by press reports
of speeches from the east and from
the west.
While Chancellor Emeritus David
Starr Jordan was warring for peace in
Madison Square, New York, and hav
ing his remarks objected to by vio
lence, President Wilbur waß pleading
for war at the Blossom Festival at
Saratoga.
A Change In Rostrum*.
Regret has been expressed that the
two men could not have exchanged
rostrums for their talks, in the inter
ests of artistic harmony, and prob
ably both wished the same wish, too.
Dr. Wilbur again sounded a warn
ing for preparedness for the coming
conflict he predicts with the Central
Powers. "Gradually we have come to
meet facts face to face," he said.
"The stark, turgid truth of Belgium
and Armenia, of the Lusitania and
the Laconia, and the 'presentation
note' to Mexico have sunk deeper and
deeper into our minds, have seared
our consciences for our past neglect,
have aroused us to action.
"Our neutrality became painful.
Our forbearance has been thought
weakness, our reluctance fear, our
hopeful hesitation rank cowardice.
We must defeat the things Germany
and Turkey are upholding for their
sakes as well as our own, for liberty's
sake and for the future's sake.
"Late comers to the combat we must
work as we never have before. We
must clinch the victory of democracy
over divine right and might, so that
the rule by the people, for the people !
and of the people will be the supreme
ideal in every land.
"No nobler fight than ours will be J
or has been known to mau. We strive
not for land, not for power, nor for
mastery, nor in passion, but coolly
and calmly we go into the world's
arena, the champions of international
law and justice."
IVuce Treated Harshly.
And while Dr. Wilbur's stern words ;
were hurled forth unhindered ex
cept by the springtime fragrance of
the Blossom Festival, Chancellor Jor
dan's pleas tor peace were meeting
harsh treatment in New York City.
Dr. Jordan made some remarks about
Colonel Roosevelt, to which an ad
mirer objected. Pacifists at the meet
ing forgot their creed in dealing with
him.
Dr. Jordan and the peace board he
is meeting with advanced resolutions
to Congress asking for a vote of the
people before this nation declare war,
and asking that settlement of Ameri
can claims be set aside until the end
of the European war.
A resolution adopted says, in part:
"This mass meeting protests against
the proclamation by the metropolitan
press that a state of war exists be
tween the United States and Ger
many; protests against the campaign
of misrepresentation prompted by
those who would profit by plunging
this country into the abyss of war;
protests against the systematic in
flammation of the public mind by hys
terical preparations for war."
The resolution twangs strongly of
the tone of Dr. Jordan, and it is prob
able that he had much to do with
framing it.

the Blossom Festival, Chancellor Jor

harsh treatment in New York City.
Dr. Jordan made some remarks about
Colonel Roosevelt, to which an ad

Dr. Jordan and the peace board he
is meeting with advanced resolutions
to Congress asking for a vote of the
people before this nation declare war,
and asking that settlement of Ameri
can claims be set aside until the end
of the European war.
A resolution adopted says, in part:
"This mass meeting protests against
the proclamation by the metropolitan
press that a state of war exists be
tween the United States and Ger
many; protests against the campaign
of misrepresentation prompted by
those who would profit by plunging
this country into the abyss of war;
protests against the systematic in
flammation of the public mind by hys
terical preparations for war."
The resolution twangs strongly of
the tone of Dr. Jordan, and it is prob
able that he had much to do with
framing it.
LEADERSHIP in opinion on inter
national questions is not lacking
for followers of Stanford ideal
ists, as is evidenced by press reports
of speeches from the east and from
the west.

Regret has been expressed that the

Dr. Wilbur again sounded a warn

conflict he predicts with the Central
Powers. "Gradually we have come to
meet facts face to face," he said.
