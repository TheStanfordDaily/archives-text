# Varsity Track Men Win Southern Meet
## Combined U.S.C. and Athletic Club Teams Downed by Cardinal 
### 
Stanford's varsity track team were
victors, Saturday, in Los Angeles,
over the combined teams of the Uni
versity of Southern California and the
Los Angeles Athletic Club, by a score
of 64 1-3 to f>7 1-3. Twenty-one of the
southerners' points must be credited
to the Athletic Club team, and to Fred
Kelly ten of these for capturing
first in the 120 yard hurdles and the
220 yard dash.
Varsity men were handicapped
somewhat by being unfamiliar with
the Bovard Field track, which has
five and three-quarter laps to the mile,
and in addition is in rather poor
shape. House captured the low
hurdles, but failed to place in the
high hurdles, having an off day.
