# A 						HEALTHY SUBJUNCTIVE
## 
### 
Saturday's diamond contest with California was an exhibition of
good clean sportsmanship such as we all like to witness. Further
more, it was a basebal game, and not a series of kicks and crabs at
the umpire, which is more than we can say for some of our past in
tercollegiate struggles. It is better to lose a good game than to mar
it by useless bickering. California has drawn first blood, but it was
by no means a slaughter, nor is it conclusive indication of the out
come of the series. There is still plenty of chance for ultimate vic
tory, but victory, though desirable, is not essential. Stanford can,
and will take defeat with good grace, if defeat be her portion. The
subjunctive is still a good healthy one in this case, however, and will
be until the last strike is called with the Cardinal on the short end of
the score.

The scene of defeat may not be a pleasant place to linger, but we
ought to be able to stand it long enough to exchange intercollegiate
courtesies. Tt was a rather deserted row of seats which caught the
echoes of the University hymns after the game Saturday.
