# Militiamen Are Called Out for Federal Service
## 
### 
Company L, Palo Alto company of
the California National Guard, has
been called into the Federal service.
An order was received from the com
mander of the Western Department
this morning, ordering them to re
cruit their organization to full war
strength, and be ready for active ser
vice at any moment.
R. W. Sherman, '19, and G. L. I3oul
ware, '19, were called out of class
this morning and ordered to report to
the Armory in Palo Alto. Several for
mer Stanford men are enrolled in
Company L. George Risling, special
student at Stanford in 1913, is a lieu
tenant. Other men from here are en
listed, but have not taken the Fed
eral oath, and for this reason are not
called out under the present act.
According to present reports the
militiamen will stay in Palo Alto until
Congress convenes, when they will in
all probability report to the Presidio
for full equipment.
The officers of Company L are anx
ious to fill their company up and are
campaigning vigorously to secure
men.
