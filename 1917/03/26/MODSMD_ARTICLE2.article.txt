# Preparedness Cards Mailed to Students
## McDowell Heads Committee to Work Under National Organization 
### 
Preparedness questionnaires have
been mailed to all students registered
in the University and all members of
the faculty. Within the next few days
they will be mailed to all alumni.
Cards have not been mailed former
students who did not graduate as ad
dresses of these men and women are
not on file. Any former student who
wishes a blank should write the regis
trar's office for one.
Not Compulsory.
Filling out of the blanks is not com
pulsory but all Stanford men and
women are urged to do so, regard
less of whether they signify willing
ness to volunteer for service in case
of emergency.
This preparedness action at Stan
ford is a part of a nation-wide move
ment by all the principal universities
and colleges of the United States.
Stanford is working under tlie gen
eral supervision of the Intercollegiate
Intelligence Bureau, recently organ
ized voluntarily by the heads of the
large universities of the country.
J. E. McDowell, assistant registrar,
has been appointed adjutant of the
work of this bureau at Stanford. A
committee, to be known as the Na
tional intelligence Committee, was ap
pointed today by President Wilbur to
take entire charge of this prepared
ness work. It consists of Associate
Professor H. C. Brown of the Philos
ophy department and Assistant Pro
fessor D. F. Grass of the Economics
department, representing the faculty;
Dr. H. R. Stolz, director of Physical
Training, Associate Professor J. P.
Mitchell of the Chemistry department,
and Associate Professor M. R. Kirk
wood of the Law School, representing
the'alumni, and F. C. McColloch, '17,
representing the students.
This committee will need volunteer
help during the Easter vacation to tab
ulate the mass of statistical informa
tion that will be gained from the re
turned cards. All who wish to help
in doing this are asked to see J. E.
McDowell.
