# Figures Showing Low Marital Rate of Stanford Women Are Inadequate, Says Dr. Wilbur
## 
### 
In commenting on the article which
appeared in the April number of the
' Journal of Heredity," to the effect that
only 48.5 per cent of Stanford women
graduates marry as against a much
higher number in all other universi
ties, President Wilbur said that the
figures used by the "Journal of Hered
ity" were very evidently without log
ical force.
Dr. Wilbur objected to the state
ment of a San Francisco newspaper
reviewing the article, that "a survey
of t||b marital record of women grad
uates from* Stanford during the per
iod from graduation of the first class
in 1892 to 1899 showed that out of
330 women considered, 1 f»0 or 48.5 per
cent married."
As he pointed out, between the years
chosen a great many more women
have been graduated than are ac
counted for in the article, and that
the article gives no indication as to
how the particular 330 considered
were chosen.
The article in question compared
the Stanford figures with those of the
University of California, where be
tween the years 1895 and 1899, 65.7
per cent of California women grad
uates married. The "Journal of Her
edity" stated that Stanford's marriage
rate among women is lower than that
of any co-educational university or
■which the journal iiad record. It
compares favorably, however, with the
highest of strictly women's colleges.
The marriage rate of Stanford men.
the journal showed, was very close to
that of Yale and Harvard.
