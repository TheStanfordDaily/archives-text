# AMERICANS STILL RELIEF EXECUTIVES
## MRS. HOOVER RETURNS Responsibility for Feeding Belgium Depends on U.S. Workers 
### 
Mils. HERBERT C. HOOVER,
who is on the campus at pres
ent, as the guest of Professor
and Mrs. A. B. Clark, stated that the
relief work in Belgium will go on
despite the withdrawal of American
agents, but said she did not know just
what arrangements would be made
from time to time.
Mrs. Hoover said further that Her
bert C. Hoover went to Europe, after
doing what was necessary in this
country, to "act in an advisory capac
ity with reference to the actual dis
tribution of food in Belguimâ€”be a
consulting engineer as it were."
Work of Americans.
The work of Americans from now
on "will very likely be restricted to
the purchase and transportation of the
food, and its trans-shipment at Rotter
dam, Mrs. Hoover believes.
In speaking of the sinkiug of some
of the relie* ships, Mrs. Hoover said:
"The fact that some of the ships of
the Belgian Relief Commission have
been sunk while they were taking
food across the Atlantic to the Bel
gians must not cause a cessation of
the efforts to send food. During the
two and a half years of the commis
sion's work, fifteen ships have gone
down out of live hundred trips.
"The fact that three boats have
gone down out of QVery hundred does
not make the need of the other ninety
seven any less. And it should always
be remembered in speaking of lost
boats that boat and cargo are always
fully insured. There is no money loss
when a Belgian relief ship is lost.
The insurance money can be used to
load another vessel with food."
Mrs. Hoover will make her home
here at Stanford with her son, Her
bert C. Hoover, Jr., who is a student
in the Palo Alto high school.
