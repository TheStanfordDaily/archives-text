# March 29 Will Be Reserved as Day for Roughs Only
## 
### 
An old-time Stanford custom will
be revived next Thursday when upper
classmen cast aside for the nonce the
dignified costume that distinguishes
the tribe from the rest of the breed,
and appear on the campus in the cast
off garments of a former forgotten
age. "Roughs' Day," which is the
technical appellation bestowed upon
the day when old clothes will be the
reigning fashion, is for upperclassmen
only. It.was dropped from the calen
dar of Junior Week events last year.
Other events that will add to the
joyousness of Junior Week activities,
are reaching the pinnacle of prepared
ness with each suceeding day. While,
the choruses are being drilled for the
opera, "A Pirate For a Day," a line
extending entirely around the block
at the Bookstore, gives evidence of the
largest seat sale of the year. Only a
few seats are left at the Bookstore
and at Weingartner's, in Palo Alto.
As an opener that is calculated to
eclipse all previous attempts, the fes
tivities scheduled for Lagunita next I
Wednesday night are being carefully !
