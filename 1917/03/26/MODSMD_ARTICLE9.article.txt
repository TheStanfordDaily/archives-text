# H.R. Fairclough to Give Latin Lecture
## "City Planning in Ancient Rome" to Be Subject of Talk Tomorrow Night 
### 
Professor H. R. Fairclough of the
Latin department will deliver his lec
ture on "City Planning in Ancient
Rome," tomorrow night, in the Little
Theater. The lecture will be illus
trated with slides.
Professor Fairclough, who is at the
present time an associate secretary of
the Archaeological Institute of Amer
ica, has made an intense study of his
subject and has frequently been in
vited to lecture before various so
cieties. In the lecture the speaker
will show how the greatness of Rome
was due to a definite plan which was
worked out in the course of a century
as the result of the policy first put
into effect by Julius Caesar, and car
ried out by the later emperors.
The essentials of the old Roman
city plan have been largely repro
duced in this country, according to
Professor Fairclough. He will show
their application in California and es
pecially at the San Francisco exposi
tion by means of about fifty slides
taken in Rome and San Francisco.
