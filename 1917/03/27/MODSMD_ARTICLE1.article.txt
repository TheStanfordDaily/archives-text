by default, one by a knockout and
two decision matches. Sullivan,
Flint and Wheatly were the Cardinal
men to win their bouts. Pedley, the
Stanford middleweight, went down
for the count after ten seconds in the

Large Croud oil Hand.
A large crowd was out to witness
the matches, and a number of women
were in tlie audience. The sports
manship displayed was good, accord
ing to 11. W. Maloney, boxing coach.
Califoriiians Hit Hard.
The California men showed that
they had been selected for their abil
ity to hit hard, rather than for their
knowledge of the science of boxing.
The judges remarked on the fact that
the Stanford men showed far more
knowledge of the sport than the Berk
eley men, with the exception of Shep
ardson, the Blue and Gold feather
weight, who won a clean-cnt victory
over Marston.
Sullivan's win over Maguire, the
Californian, who has held the welter
weight and featherweight champion
ships of his University for two years,
was the best match of the evening.
It was a wonderful piece of work, the
Cardinal man reaching in his left
for points, time after time. The
match resembled a boxing teacher
giving a pupil a lesson, and Sullivan
j was never troubled by the Berkeley
man.
Flint used his left counter contin
ually against .Spunn, the California
lightweight, and won a clean victory.
The Cardinal man never was in bet
ter form, and was never hard put, al
though Spunn showed flashes of good
boxing.
Pedley was knocked cold and it was
thought seriously injured by a fall
to the floor ten seconds after his
bout started. However, he opened his
eyes in fifteen minutes, and except
for a slight cut on the back of his
head is all right.
Pedley and Doolittle stepped up
and shook hands. The Cardinal man
feinted with his left and started a
right cross. IJoolittle shot in a left
to the jaw which caught Pedley off
balance, and following with a right
sent the Stanford middleweight
down. Pedley fell, his head hitting
the floor lirst. He was not injured
by the blows, the last one just touch
ing him, and was not unconscious
when he fell, but the knock of the
back of his head on the floor was
nearly serious. The bout was given
to Doolittle.
Whatly boxed all around Miller in
the light-heavy class, and although
his opponent was aggressive, clearly
demonstrated his superiority. There
was no doubt about, the decision.
Madden, the bantam, who had to
take off eleven pounds and get in
condition in three days, to take
Jimmy Britt's place, was weakened,
and not in shape for a hard bout. If
lie had finished as he started, he
would have won the bout, is the opin
ion of the referee, but he weakened
after the first round, and Holzer, the
Californian, was awarded the bout.
Marston ran up against Shepard
son, the best boxer on the California
team, and lost in one of the most
scientific and hard-fought matches of
the evening. Marston was at a de
cided disadvantage 011 account of his
short reach, and was also a little
weak from making the weight.

for the count after ten seconds in the
ring, while Madden ana Marston lost

Large Croud oil Hand.
A large crowd was out to witness
the matches, and a number of women
were in tlie audience. The sports
manship displayed was good, accord
ing to 11. W. Maloney, boxing coach.
Califoriiians Hit Hard.
The California men showed that
they had been selected for their abil
ity to hit hard, rather than for their
knowledge of the science of boxing.
The judges remarked on the fact that
the Stanford men showed far more
knowledge of the sport than the Berk
eley men, with the exception of Shep
ardson, the Blue and Gold feather
weight, who won a clean-cnt victory
over Marston.
Sullivan's win over Maguire, the
Californian, who has held the welter
weight and featherweight champion
ships of his University for two years,
was the best match of the evening.
It was a wonderful piece of work, the
Cardinal man reaching in his left
for points, time after time. The
match resembled a boxing teacher
giving a pupil a lesson, and Sullivan
j was never troubled by the Berkeley
man.
Flint used his left counter contin
ually against .Spunn, the California
lightweight, and won a clean victory.
The Cardinal man never was in bet
ter form, and was never hard put, al
though Spunn showed flashes of good
boxing.
Pedley was knocked cold and it was
thought seriously injured by a fall
to the floor ten seconds after his
bout started. However, he opened his
eyes in fifteen minutes, and except
for a slight cut on the back of his
head is all right.
Pedley and Doolittle stepped up
and shook hands. The Cardinal man
feinted with his left and started a
right cross. IJoolittle shot in a left
to the jaw which caught Pedley off
balance, and following with a right
sent the Stanford middleweight
down. Pedley fell, his head hitting
the floor lirst. He was not injured
by the blows, the last one just touch
ing him, and was not unconscious
when he fell, but the knock of the
back of his head on the floor was
nearly serious. The bout was given
to Doolittle.
Whatly boxed all around Miller in
the light-heavy class, and although
his opponent was aggressive, clearly
demonstrated his superiority. There
was no doubt about, the decision.
Madden, the bantam, who had to
take off eleven pounds and get in
condition in three days, to take
Jimmy Britt's place, was weakened,
and not in shape for a hard bout. If
lie had finished as he started, he
would have won the bout, is the opin
ion of the referee, but he weakened
after the first round, and Holzer, the
Californian, was awarded the bout.
Marston ran up against Shepard
son, the best boxer on the California
team, and lost in one of the most
scientific and hard-fought matches of
the evening. Marston was at a de
cided disadvantage 011 account of his
short reach, and was also a little
weak from making the weight.
