Lineup I mleclried.
Captain Hayes lias not decided upon
his lineup. Draper will pitch, and
either Wilcox or Campbell will re

berths will be filled by Stevens and
Cowan. Dickey will play left, Lilly

The St. Ignatius team will take the
diamond in the same order that they
faced the Cardinal two weeks ago,
except that Morrissey will pitch in
place of Dewey. E. Mitchell, last
year's freshman catcher, will work be
