## MAY CHANGE LINEUP Stanford Tossers Practicing on Berkeley Diamond This Afternoon 
### 
ST. IGNATIUS will cross bats with
the Stanford varsity baseball team
tomorrow afternoon at 4: in, on
the local diamond. This is the second
game between these two nines this
season. The Cardinal won the first
contest, although the Catholic college
organization put up a hard battle.
The usual twenty-five cents or season,
tickets will be charged for admission.
Lineup I mleclried.
Captain Hayes lias not decided upon
his lineup. Draper will pitch, and
either Wilcox or Campbell will re
ceive him. Hayes will play first, al
though Mitchell may go in. Braden
and Reagon will both work out at
second, while the other two infield
berths will be filled by Stevens and
Cowan. Dickey will play left, Lilly
will cover center and VVilkins will
hold down right.
The St. Ignatius team will take the
diamond in the same order that they
faced the Cardinal two weeks ago,
except that Morrissey will pitch in
place of Dewey. E. Mitchell, last
year's freshman catcher, will work be
hind the log for the San Francisco
tossers.
Stanford players are practicing on
the California diamond at Berkeley to
day. Sixteen men made the trip and
will return tonight. Hayes figured
that with Shriver back in the lineup,
the Cardinals will be aide to beat the
Blue and Gold delegation next Satur
day. Ball will probably hurl for the
opposing squad.
