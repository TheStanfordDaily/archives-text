# Guild Doctors Will Not Attend Students
## 
### 
Changes in the help the Students'
Guild will offer to sick people will
not mean that "Guild doctors" will at
tend students in the hospital, contrary
to the general opinion of some stu
dents.
The "Guild doctors" are Dr. Clelia
Mosher for the women, and Dr. Her
bert R. Stolz for the men. They are
engaged by the Guild to attend to
cases on the campus in their offices.
When the Guild doctors advise it,
patients will be sent to the hospital
ward, and outside physicians will at
tend them, with expenses up to fifteen
dollars paid by the Guild. The Guild
board wants this point clear, so that
no misunderstanding will follow.
