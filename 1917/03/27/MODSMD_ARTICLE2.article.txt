## Intercollegiate Game Fart of Junior Week Activities. Crowd Expected 
### 
Jimmy Byrnes has been secured by
Graduate Manager Behrens for umpire
in the freshmen baseball game against
California, on the varsity lot Thursday.
Byrnes is a former big league catcher
and a well known man in baseball
circles on the coast.
Suits Given Out.
The babes were handed out their
suits last night and were put through
a stiff practice by Captain "Doc"
Hayes. Lifur, the heaver who will in
all probability start in the first game,
is in the best of shape, and all the
other players are going strong. Cap
tain Pike, Galloway, Wayland, Cass,
Howes and Hunter are all stepping
into the ball at a lively rate, and will
account for many safeties against the
Blue and Gold heavers.
According to the dope sheet the
babes will take the field Thursday in
the following order: Lifur in the box,
Joerg behind the bat, Pike on first,
Hunter on second, Elliott on third,
and Galloway completing the infield
at short. Wayland in center, Howes
in left and Cass in right looks to be
the way the outfield will line up.
