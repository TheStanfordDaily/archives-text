I am pleading with the local critic
for justice in the matter of criticism
of campus dramatic productions. In
the past few years there undoubtedly
have been many poor criticisms of
some of our best amateur theatricals.
The result of such injustice is dis
couragement on the part of our play
ers.
The endeavor has been to criticise
professionally amateur performances,
the critic for the most part being in
competent to differentiate between
amateur and professional work. In
the future may the written criticism
be fair, and not the personal impres
sions of a pessimist. Criticism should
be constructive, not destructive, be
cause we are not professionals as yet.
The endeavor should be to uplift dra
matics. This is best done by cre
ating interest and making the play
ers glad to work. There is a certain
satisfaction in doing a thing well,
which is changed to disheartenment
by a pessimistic critic.
The players know, and the audi
ence knows, when a production goes
well, and it does no good and gen
erally does harm to criticize abusively
after the performance. As Professor
Woodward once remarked, "There
should be an attitude of friendliness
and helpfulenss toward all earnest
efforts."
The eye of the critic should turn
at times to the settings, for these are
often real works of art. His ear
should waken to the strains of the
orchestra, and he should forget for
the time his wrongs, and think only
of beautiful things.
Since destructive criticism does real
harm and is often unjust, and con
structive criticism really does good,
may I urge that the Stanford critic
will boost the coming Opera, for it
will surely be a success.
If it is not. let him keep it to him
self; it will do no good to knock.
