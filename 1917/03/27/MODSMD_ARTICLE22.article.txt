McGill Daily, the student paper of
McGill University in Montreal, Can
ada, mails hundreds of its copies daily
to Canadian men on the firing lines
in France and to those in the train
ing camps in England. McGill men
are everywhere in the war zone, and
the paper brings back to them the
other life whicli they once knew.
