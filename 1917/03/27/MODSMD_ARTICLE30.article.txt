# H. W. Maloney Applies for Reserve Commission
## 
### 
H. V\ r . Maloney, Stanford's gymnas
ium instructor, is the only member
of the faculty, so far, who has the
experience and ability, and in addi
tion, the desire to serve his country
as an officer in case war should be
declared. Mr. Maloney, last Friday,
made application for a commission
as captain in the Reserve Officers'
Corps, and presented references, in
cluding one from Dr. Wilbur.
There is no doubt that Maloney will
get his captaincy of cavalry, on ac
count of his previous experience. He t
Avas for seven yaers in the cavalry
of the English army and served for
two years and three months as scoul
in the Hoer war. He was a sergeant
of gymnastics and physical training.
It is interesting to note that at this I
time he was the boxing champion of
the English army.
Mr. Maloney has served with the
militia of Palo Alto as lieutenant
since coming to Stanford, and is as
physically fit for a gruelling cam
paign as any man could possibly be.
He has a family in Palo Alto, but he]
states that in his opinion war will j
come some time in the near future, i
and lie wants to be ready with his
commission to avoid delay when he
"is needed.
