Conches Optimistic.
Coach Cromwell of the southern
athletes believes that his men will
be able to show their heels to the
Cardinal men, while on the other
hand, Coach "Ric" Templeton seems
to have a little the best of it when he

their home track, will come out on the
long end of a larger score than 4G 1-3
to f)7 2-3, which was the score, last

Fred Kelly, noted hurdler and
sprinter, will be seen in action here
with the club men. lie captured the
high hurdles and the 220 yard dash
in the south, and figures on repeating.
Mouse will oppose him in the hurdle
events and looks to be able to give
him a tight run.
Beebe, former crack half-miler of
the University of California, though
running the quarter in the south, and
placing second to Rogers, will prob
ably attempt to win his old event Fri
day. With Schnell opposing him, the
going in the 880 promises to be ex
tremely fast.
Coach Cromwell's squad appears to
have two good sprinters in H. Lam
port, former Manual Arts star, and
K. Johnson. Lachmund and C. John
son should, however, appear to ad
vantage for Stanford.
Captain Aupperle will find a good
rival in Miller of U. S. C., who pressed
him closely in the race in the south
ern metropolis.
Stanford field men seem to have all
the odds with the exception of the
pole vault, where Bean of the L. A.
A. C. seems to have a little the best
of it.
