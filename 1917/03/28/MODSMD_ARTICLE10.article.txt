By means of about fifty stereopticon
slides, Professor H. R. Fairclough
showed in a very convincing way, in
a Little Thoatpr lecture last night,
that the architectural beauty and the
general plan of the recent San Fran
cisco exposition was in a large meas
ure due to the principles of city plan
ning which were worked out in con
nection with the ancient Roman
forum under the master hand of Julius
Caesar.
"The grandeur of Rome was due to
a definite plan of city improvement,
devised by the master mind of Julius
Caesar," Professor Fairclough told
bis audience, in beginning his lec
ture. The speaker read a letter
which had been found, written by
Cicero, telling of the plans of Caesar
with regard to the city improvements
of Rome. It has been estimated that
at least three million dollars were
needed to carry out the plans for im
provement.
In Caesar's time a system of public
parks was first carried out, Professor
Fairclough said. In increasing the
size of the forum, which was the
Roman civic center, five hundred dol
lars a square yard was paid for the
land.
Slides of Rome showed in detail the
plans and the actual city improve
ments which were carried out. Fol
lowing those the speaker showed pic
tures of Stanford and the San Fran
cisco exposition, where the Roman
plans are more nearly adhered to.
The Machinery Palace of the expo
sition, Professor Fairclough told his
audience, is practically an exact re
production of the Roman buildings,

effects.
