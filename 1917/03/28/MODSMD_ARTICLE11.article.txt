# Freshman Swimmers Win Over San Jose
## 
### 
By taking four firsts and the relay
the freshmen swimmers took the long
end of a 39 to 20 score against the
swimming team from San Jose high
school, yesterday. Only a small crowd
witnessed the contest, which did not
provide many thrills and only slow
time was made.
The freshmen are in good shape
and are nearly ready for the Califor
nia meet, which is scheduled for
April 13, in the Cardinal tank. Cap
tain Greene is confident that the
Stanford first-year men will win at
that meet.
The summary follows:
2. r » Yards —Won by Briscoe (S.I);
Considine (S). second; Balbach (S),
third. Time, :13.1.
