men should be strong. Pike, Callo
way, Hunter, Wayland, Howes and
Cass have been hitting the sphere at
a lively clip and should account for
many safeties.
Graduate Manager Behrens has an
nounced that fifty cents or season
tickets and twenty-five cents will be

will occupy the same pits as the var
sities did Saturday with the Cardinal
rooters on the end of the bleachers

men will start play tomorrow at
4:15 in the first contest of a three
game series between the two teams.
Coach Fred Cozens of the Blue and
Gold nine announced the men today
who will take the diamond for the
California aggregation, and Varsity
Captain ''Doc" Hayes and "Bill" Pike,
the freshmen skipper, this afternoon
gave out the names of the candidates
who will start for the Cardinal.
Announce Lineups.
Lifur, the man who has been a con
sistent winner all season, will be in
the box. Behind the bat will be
Joerg. Pike on first, Hunter on sec
ond, Elliott on third, and Galloway on
short, will compose the infield. In the
outer gardens will be Howes, Way
land and Cass.
California will take the diamond in
the following order: McC'lain, pitcher;
Toomey, catcher; Stevens, first base;
Welsh, second base; Luddy, third
base; Davidson, short stop; Dexter,
left field; Hyman, center field, and
either Crystal of Orchison, right
field. The addition of Davidson at
short to the freshmen team has been
a great help. The speedy fielder was
declared ineligible for the varsity the
day before the first Stanford-Cali
fornia contest, and was immediately
put on the 1920 nine. Left Fielder
Dexter is captain.
Cardinal Strong.
The selection of the Cardinal team
gives the greatets hopes of a win to
morrow. Lifur is a heady, cool
heaver, with worlds of speed and con
trol, in addition to a well balanced
assortment of curves. .Joerg has re
ceived practically all the games and
has proven himself a strong player.
The infield is air-tight, while the
three outfielders are experienced
men. In the hitting line the fresh
men should be strong. Pike, Callo
way, Hunter, Wayland, Howes and
Cass have been hitting the sphere at
a lively clip and should account for
many safeties.
