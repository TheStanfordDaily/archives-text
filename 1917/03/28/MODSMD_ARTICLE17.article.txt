# SOFT SOAP VS. MUSTARD

### 
In yesterday's issue of The Daily Palo Alto an article appeared
under the head of "Another Viewpoint," which expressed the opin
ion tTiat "criticisms" of campus dramatics should not be criticisisms
at all â€”that they should he expositions of unalloyed praise irrespec
tive of the merits of productions. It seems to us that this stand is not
well taken, and that a review which skives nothing but praise to the
good and |>oor alike loses half its value. True, college players
should not be held to professional standards, but it is a mistake to
say that this has been done in the past. If it had, the number of in
jured feelings would have been considerably augmented. To say
that a plav is a complete success if it proves to be quite the con
trary is absurd.
The writer says "There is a certain satisfaction in doing a thing
well which is changed to disheartenment by a pessimistic critic." If
a part is done well, we believe there is no critic who is so pessimistic
as not to acknowledge the fact. If poorly played, he has a right to
be pessimistic. How can a critic "think only of beautiful things" in
the face of elements which are anything but that? Fraise would mean
nothing to those who receive it, if it were made a mere matter of
course. There is a happy medium, but too muh soft soap is worse
than nothing at all. A little mustard, well deserved, does no harm.
An amateur reviewer should not take pains to find things to criticise,
perhaps; but if he can't help but see them, they are not to be ignored
merely because it is a college production.

Juniors assume the role of hosts tonight, when Lagunita becomes
the scene of the first Junior \V r cek festivities. All members of the
class should consider it their duty to share in the work of entertain
ment, as well as the pleasure. Too often in the past, the former has
been left to a few faithful souls, commonly known as "goats." A
call has been issued by the Junior Prom committee for men to help
decorate tomorrow and Friday, ft behooves every Junior who pos
sibly can, to be on deck.
