# Last Rehearsal of "Pirate for a Day"
## Leads and Choruses Are Prime for Splendid Production Thursday 
### 
Final rehearsal of "A Pirate For A
Day,"the 1918 opera, will he held to
night to add the finishing touches to
the production. Tomorrow night the
curtain rises showing the headquar
ters of the American Fruit "Company
at Port Limon. With the bright-col
ored awnings and the plantations in
the background, the whole setting de
picts one of the natural scenes of
the semi-tropics.
Lend lias Good Voice.
Miss Isabelle Young, who takes the
part of June Adair, finds it a hard
task which to aid, a pirate or a real
American, the part taken by Dick
Maddox, in the role of Douglas Chaee.
Miss Young has a beautiful voice of
exceptional range and quality. Dick
Maddox and his friend, Mr. J. Morti
mer Stagg, the role taken by Dave
Smith, have all sorts of schemes with
which to win respecting their lady
loves, along with a whole chest of
gold. It takes some time to do it, but
it is finally acomplished in the last
act, when Dick Maddox attempts to
blow up the palace with a non-ex
plosive.
Miss Angie Cross again will make
her appearance in the role of a sou
brette. Unlike last year, however, she
will take the role of a pirate's
daughter, and not only ranis the pal
ace and the pirate isle of her father,
but also runs the fickle man from
the states, Mr. J. Mortimer Stagg.
The fox-trot number in which Smith
and Miss Cross feature will be onr of
the hits of the show.
One of the new stars of this year's
musical production will be Miss Betty
Barroll, who plays the part of the in
genue with a quaintness and charm.
She plays opposite R. G. Whealton,
who, as Charles Fitzherbert Ameri
can. heir to the American Fruit Com
pany, becomes quite brave until the
pirates take the occasion to change
his view.
The villain in the show is E. J.
Galliano, who takes the part of Pedro
Diablo. He not only can smoke the
big black cigar to perfection, but he
lias one of the best tenor voices in the
cast. His part is exceptionally well
handled.
Admiral Don Panatelo Optimo is
played by .1. C. Cross. With the pirate
isle at his disposal he trys hard to
live up to the reputation of his fore
father, Captain Kidd. His "better
half," Senora Dorolez Optimo, as por
trayed by Miss Gladys Lane, is a
splendid character role.
