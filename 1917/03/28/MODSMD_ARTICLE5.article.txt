# Conference Games to Be Affected By War
## 
### 
Sanction of the Executive Commit
tee was placed last night on Grad
uate Manager Behren's action in tele
graphing to the authorities ot' the Uni
versity of Washington, recommending
that, in the event the United States
declares war upon any foreign power
or issues a general mobilization order,
members of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence should cancel all intercollegiate
activities and all athletic contracts
with distant colleges.
This telegram was sent in response
to a query by Dean Arthur Priest of
the University of Washington. The
purpose of the move is to prevent
members of the Conference contract
ing for meets and games with distant
colleges and then failing to fulfill
their obligations. Compliance with
Manager Behren's recommendation
would result in the cancelling of the
triangular regattas between Stanford,
California and Washington; would
prevent any Stanford or California
track or baseball squads taking trips
to the north and would prevent Wash
ington from competing against Stan
ford or California down here. It
would also cause the cancelling of
baseball games which Manager Beh
rens has arranged for the eastern trip
of the baseball squad and would also
prevent the crew from competing in
the Poughkeepsie regatta.
This move would not in any way
affect athletic competition or rela
tions between Stanford and Califor
nia, as this competition is not con
sidered as being "between distant col
leges." The Executive Committee of
the Associated Students of California
will take action upon the recommend
ation tonight at its weekly meeting.
It is expected that it will approve of
the move.
