### 
Graduate managers beh
rens and Stroud of Stanford and
the University of California, ac
companied by the Cardinal track
coach, "Ric" Templeton, and the Blue
and Gold trainer, Walter Christie, last
night agreed upon a complete list of
the officials for the track meet to be
held on April 21.
Will Run Heats.
It was also decided at the meeting
last night that heats will have to be
run in all dashes and the hurdles.
Stanford is put at a disadvantage by
this agreement, but the rules that the
two universities compete under, pre
cisely state that heats shall be run,
and the Berkeley representatives are
justified in taking their stand. This
will mean that House will have to
enter just twice as many races as
had been planned.

also made rut, and the choice for tho
r
position in each race. They are as
