# OLD MAN JINX AGAIN HITS VARSITY EIGHT
## Captain Rix Maurer May Not Be in Boat Against California 
### 
Can the Cardinal take the intercol
legiate regatta from the University
of California and the University of
Washington on April 14? The an
swer is: if "Old Man Jinx" can be
put away. From the first of the year
he lias been hanging around the Red
wood boathouse and Lagunita, and
the big problem facing Coach "Husky"
Guerena and Captain Rix Maurer is
to get rid of him.
Miiurer May Not Hon.
The news that puts the worst light
on the crew situation is the fact that
Maurer may not be back at his old
position at stroke. He has been sick
for several days and has had a hard
time getting into condition. Only two
and a hall' weeks remain before the
big race, and unless the long work
outs put the captain in his old form,
it is probable that either Steinbeck
or King will be at stroke in the var
sity shell. Roth these men were
strokes on their freshmen eights and
will be able to make a strong show
ing.
Places Indefinite.
The other places are still indefinite,
although the following men will in
all probability have a place in the
boat: Russel, at bow the last few
days, has shown up well, and will
make a strong oarsman. Rogers, at
his old position, No. fi, seems to be
a sure varsity rower. Watts, a mem
ber of last year's freshmen crew, is
the best bet for No. 7, from present
indications. LaForge, another sopho-
more, is a world of strength at No.
4. McEuen will probably be found at
No. 3. McEuen has had a hard time
getting into the new form developed
since he was a member of the varsity,
but his ability will give him a place.
Keller will, according to the dope,
bold down the No. 5 position.
Coleman, Swarts and Andrews are
fighting bard for the other places, but
the selection of any of these men is
not sure.

During spring vacation, Coach
Guerena is counting on getting his
men into top shape. Morning rows
and good weather will count in put
ting the oarsmen hack to form.
The 1920 crew is one of the best
ever developed at Stanford. Stamp at
stroke and the first five men in the
boat are all heavy and all show excep
tional form. The three bow positions
are still open ,with Glen and Phillips
fighting with the regular candidates
lor places and the final selection wil
not be made until shortly before tin
race.

a sure varsity rower. Watts, a mem
ber of last year's freshmen crew, is
the best bet for No. 7, from present
indications. LaForge, another sopho-
more, is a world of strength at No.
4. McEuen will probably be found at
No. 3. McEuen has had a hard time
getting into the new form developed
since he was a member of the varsity,
but his ability will give him a place.
Keller will, according to the dope,
bold down the No. 5 position.
Coleman, Swarts and Andrews are
fighting bard for the other places, but
the selection of any of these men is
not sure.

During spring vacation, Coach
Guerena is counting on getting his
men into top shape. Morning rows
and good weather will count in put
ting the oarsmen hack to form.
The 1920 crew is one of the best
ever developed at Stanford. Stamp at
stroke and the first five men in the
boat are all heavy and all show excep
tional form. The three bow positions
are still open ,with Glen and Phillips
fighting with the regular candidates
lor places and the final selection wil
not be made until shortly before tin
race.
Can the Cardinal take the intercol
legiate regatta from the University
of California and the University of
Washington on April 14? The an
swer is: if "Old Man Jinx" can be
put away. From the first of the year
he lias been hanging around the Red
wood boathouse and Lagunita, and
the big problem facing Coach "Husky"
Guerena and Captain Rix Maurer is
to get rid of him.
Miiurer May Not Hon.
The news that puts the worst light
on the crew situation is the fact that
Maurer may not be back at his old
position at stroke. He has been sick
for several days and has had a hard
time getting into condition. Only two
and a hall' weeks remain before the
big race, and unless the long work
outs put the captain in his old form,
it is probable that either Steinbeck
or King will be at stroke in the var
sity shell. Roth these men were
strokes on their freshmen eights and
will be able to make a strong show
ing.
Places Indefinite.
The other places are still indefinite,
although the following men will in
all probability have a place in the
boat: Russel, at bow the last few
days, has shown up well, and will
make a strong oarsman. Rogers, at
his old position, No. fi, seems to be
a sure varsity rower. Watts, a mem
ber of last year's freshmen crew, is
the best bet for No. 7, from present
indications. LaForge, another sopho-
more, is a world of strength at No.
