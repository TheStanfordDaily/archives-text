## Greek Letter Pin Looks Suspicious to French Police 
### 
There's no war on between the
Greeks and the French that anyone
knows of, but the French (govern
ment doesn't want any Greek letters
flaunted around Paris, according to
reports from the boys at the front.
They look spsuicious.
"Fellows have been pinched for
wearing suspicious looking fraternity
pins over here," is the message on a
card to the members of the Sigma
Chi fraternity from J. H. Eastman.
Eastman had to address his card to
"Mr. S. C. House, 10 Latfuen," to
avoid suspicion of censors.
"We are now energetically seeing
Paris," writes Eastman. "Have all
bought wrist watches, and become
fiends for 5 o'clock teas and pastries.
Except for a few more soldiers than
usual, and many women in mourning,
Paris shows no signs of war. The
food restrictions, however, limit, the
number of courses to be gulped at
cafes, and one can't buy any sweet
meats or pastries either Tuesday or
Wednesdayâ€”otherwise we suffer very
little."
