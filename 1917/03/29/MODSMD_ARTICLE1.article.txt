# JUNIOR OPERA CAST ALL SET FOR "CURTAIN"
## JOURNEY TO PANAMA "A Pirate for a Day" Is One of the Cleverest Productions Given on Campus 
### Margaret Evans, '17 
AT THE rise of the curtain on
tonight's production of "A
Pirate For A Day,"the 1918
class will be handed the laurels for
having staged one of the cleverest and
most spectacular musical shows given
on the campus. The entire show has
been produced by Dick Morgan, and
it is to him that the credit for the
scenic effects, and the costumes, as
well as the actual work-out, is due.
Panama Scene Opens.
The opening scene, with the bright
costumes of the Senoritas, the sailor
costumes of the men, and the garbs
of the peons, transports one to the
picturesque town of Port Limon, Pan
ama. The awning bedecked headquar
ters of the American Fruit Company,
around whose business the plot of
the comedy turns, is typical for its
tropical air. In the background is
seen the blue Pacific dotted with
islands covered with palms.
Galliano Is Villain.
Pedro Diablo (Frank Galliano), a
devil of a fellow and foreman of the
American Fruit Company's planta
tions, makes bis entrance during the
opening chorus of "Pan-America."
