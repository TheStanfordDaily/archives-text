# JUNIOR OPERA CAST ALL SET FOR "CURTAIN"
## JOURNEY TO PANAMA "A Pirate for a Day" Is One of the Cleverest Productions Given on Campus 
### Margaret Evans, '17 
AT THE rise of the curtain on
tonight's production of "A
Pirate For A Day,"the 1918
class will be handed the laurels for
having staged one of the cleverest and
most spectacular musical shows given
on the campus. The entire show has
been produced by Dick Morgan, and
it is to him that the credit for the
scenic effects, and the costumes, as
well as the actual work-out, is due.
Panama Scene Opens.
The opening scene, with the bright
costumes of the Senoritas, the sailor
costumes of the men, and the garbs
of the peons, transports one to the
picturesque town of Port Limon, Pan
ama. The awning bedecked headquar
ters of the American Fruit Company,
around whose business the plot of
the comedy turns, is typical for its
tropical air. In the background is
seen the blue Pacific dotted with
islands covered with palms.
Galliano Is Villain.
Pedro Diablo (Frank Galliano), a
devil of a fellow and foreman of the
American Fruit Company's planta
tions, makes bis entrance during the
opening chorus of "Pan-America."
Diablo's entrance song, "Serenade," is
well fitted to his exceptionally fine
tenor, voice. "Witch of My Heart" is
another one of Diablo's features.
The manager of the plantation,
Henry C. Gray, the role taken by Fred
Williamson, is awaiting the steamer
from the states which is bringing the
money to pay off the debt on the
company's possessions. Instead of
the money arriving, his niece, June
Adair (Miss Isabelle Young), makes
her appearance. The money has been
taken by the bo Id, bad pirates, led
by Admiral Don Panatelo Optimo (J.
C. Cross), who hid the chest on his
Pirate Isle, and lias given the chart
of the island and the code to his
daughter, Carlotta. Miss Angie Cross,
as Carlotta, hides the code book in
a barrel of dynamite. "I Want to Be
a Pirate, Too," is sung by the Ad
miral, Carlotta, and Diablo.
"I'll Build A Home in Port Limon"
is the feature of Jerry Chace (Miss
Betty Barroll) and Charles Fitzher
bert. American (R. G. Whealton).
Douglas Chace (Dick Maddox), who,
unknown to Charles, is traveling in
the employ of the company in order
to see that the heir-apparent doesn't
do anything to disgrace the name of
America. In order to get away with
his little scheme it is necessary to
use the excuse of "Mentally deficient."
The second act has one of the most
spectacular sets that has ever been
seen on the Assembly Hall stage. The
scheme is used in the palace of the
descendant of Captain Kidd, with the
"Sapphire Seas," a hit of Smith and
Miss Cross, in the background. It is
here that the admiral entertains at a
little midnight party, all of the maids
from the states being guests of honor.
This is all unknown to his doting
wife, Dolorez (Miss Gladys Lane),
who for some reason, doesn't trust
him too far.
