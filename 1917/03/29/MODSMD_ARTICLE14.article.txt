Proposed changes in the constitu
tion of the Associated Students affect
ing officers of the students' associa
tion, committees, student publications,
and class financial accountings, were
presented for discussion this morning
at a student assembly in Assembly
Hall. Student Body President. T. E.
Swigart presided.
Veiled Censorship Charged.
An amendment, which immediately
became the butt of attack, was Section
11 of Article IV, providing for the
regulation of "any publication which
now exists or may in the future ex
ist, in name or in spirit a University
publication." The section further pro
vides that the editor of a publication
shall be subject to discipline by the
Students' Council, and the manage
ment subject to reorganization upon
"any act that will reflect unfavorably
upon the good name of the Univer
sity, or at such time that the publica
tion-operates at a loss."
Attack on the section was opened
by Geroid Robinson, '17, former edi
tor of "Sequoia," and was followed
by R. A. Donaldson, '17, present edi
tor of "Sequoia." W. P. Staniford,
