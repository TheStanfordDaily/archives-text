## 
### 
Proposed changes in the constitu
tion of the Associated Students affect
ing officers of the students' associa
tion, committees, student publications,
and class financial accountings, were
presented for discussion this morning
at a student assembly in Assembly
Hall. Student Body President. T. E.
Swigart presided.
Veiled Censorship Charged.
An amendment, which immediately
became the butt of attack, was Section
11 of Article IV, providing for the
regulation of "any publication which
now exists or may in the future ex
ist, in name or in spirit a University
publication." The section further pro
vides that the editor of a publication
shall be subject to discipline by the
Students' Council, and the manage
ment subject to reorganization upon
"any act that will reflect unfavorably
upon the good name of the Univer
sity, or at such time that the publica
tion-operates at a loss."
Attack on the section was opened
by Geroid Robinson, '17, former edi
tor of "Sequoia," and was followed
by R. A. Donaldson, '17, present edi
tor of "Sequoia." W. P. Staniford,
'16, student adviser and former Daily
Palo Alto editor, said that the "value
of placing student publications in
direct relation to the student body is
evident. We can't afford to have free
lance publications."
Donaldson, in presenting the other
side of the case, protested against what
he called "censorship by implication."
1-Fe branded the proposed change as
being either "unfair or useless." He
said further, "Free-lance publications
have never hurt, the University."
Foster Weeks, 'IS, manager of the
Quad and Sequoia, vigorously opposed
the clause giving (lie Executive Com
mittee power to reorganize a publica
tion which operates at a ioss. He
said, in part: "The society which
fosters the publication should have
control." The change lie character
ized as being "an injustice and a dras
tic measure."
President Swigart. read a letter

from an alumnus, David H. Walker,
'09, formerly editor of The Daily Palo
Alto, favoring the changes embodied
in the amendments to the constitution.
F. J. Ta.vl&r, 'IS. present managing
editor of The Daily Palo Alto, also op
posed the changes proposed, saying
that it was "virtual censorship of all
publications." He stated that by the
change "any group of men on the
Executive Committee could control the
comment of student publications."
President Swigart explained the
changes, saying that the spirit, of the
proposed amendments were not to
have a censorship over the publica
tions. lie said that the amendments
would probably be redrafted in (lie
light of the discussion and would be
presented for further discussion at an
assemby two weeks from today.
