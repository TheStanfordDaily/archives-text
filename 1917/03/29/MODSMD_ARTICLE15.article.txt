# 1920 Speedsters Meet S. C. on Track
## "Ric" Templeton Has One Week to Choose Men Who Will Start Against U. C. 
### 
Approximately one week remains
for Coach "Ric" Templeton to work
the kinks out of his freshmen track
squad and to make selection of the
team that will meet the California
"Babes" here on April 7. Outlook for
success appears very good, though a
prophesy of any sort is difficult to
make, since the two squads have
competed with few outside teams this
season, and in no case with the same
team.
Meet S. Saturday.
Freshmen will get their last pre
liminary competition this Saturday
afternoon at 2 o'clock, when they
meet the team of Santa Clara College.
The collegians are reputed to have
some very good sprinters and quarter
mile men and they are also known to
liave an excellent distance man in
Art Forward. Coach Otto Fritsch of
the Mission lads believes that his
runners will be able to make the 1920
lads travel in all events.
Forty-five men were named on the
list ol' freshmen eligible for the Cali
fornia meet, and Coach Templeton
figures on using most of these men
Saturday, so that he will be able to
get a better idea of the men to
choose to represent the Cardinal when
they meet the Hlue and Cold,
Season tickets or twenty-five cents
lias been set as the admission price
for the Santa Clara event Saturday.
The regular officials will handle this
meet.
