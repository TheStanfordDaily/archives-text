# STANFORD "OPINION"
## 
### 
The San Francisco Chronicle yesterday published an article con
cerning; the ire of Stanford alumni, which has been aroused by recent
speeches of Dr. David Starr Jordan in the east. An unnamed alum
nus is quoted as saying "We strongly resent the pronounced opposi
tion to the policy of President Wilson. Under the circumstances we
would like very much to see it made perfectly clear that in his oppo
sition in this great crisis he utters purely personal views. We do not
deny his perfect right to do this, but we want the people of the United
States to know that the University as an institution, its faculty, stu
dents and graduates, are back of the President to the man." The
alumni, it was said, might be compelled by pressure of its members
to issue to the public a letter explaining Dr. Jordan's non-association
with the University in any official capacity.
We do not see how any person can express the opinion of Stan
ford University. Of course, long years of service for the Univer
sity make it impossible to disassociate Chancellor-Emeritus Jordan
from this institution and it is the privilege of the alumni to correct
an impression, if there be one, that he is representing Stanford as a
University. However, it is just as impossible for the alumni to say
what is the policy of the University, as it is for Dr. Jordan. Of
ficial connection does not even give this power. President Wilbur
has some very decided ideas on the war question. Although many
agree with him, he is not expressing what Stanford, a Univer
sity, thinks. He is speaking for himself. It is impossible for the
University to think with one mind, and 110 one person or group of per
sons can speak officially for Stanford on such a proposition as this.
Tt also seems improbable that the alumni viewpoint could be
faithfully expressed without considerable investigation, and even
more improbable that it would be unanimous when discovered. At
any rate, whether we agree or not with the views expressed in the
Chronicle, they can do no more than reflect alnmnys opinion, and can
not be considered as a representation of Stanford thought as a Uni
versity.
