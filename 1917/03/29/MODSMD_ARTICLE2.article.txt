# Varsity Overwhelms St. Ignatius Squad
## Hoever and Draper Pitch and Hit While Stanford Wins by 7-1 Score 
### 
When Guy Draper and Gus Hoever,
whose collective batting average totals
about .02:], both garner safe hits for
themselves in one afternoon off the
same pitcher, it is very apparent that
that pitcher has nothing more than the
proverbial glove and a prayer.
Hurler Morrissey had little more
than those two articles yesterday af
ternoon, and as Guy and Gus pitched
as well as they batted, Stanford had
no difficulty in downing St. Ignatius,
7-1, in seven innings of rather weird
baseball on the varsity diamond.
Show Up Well.
The showing of the varsity should
warm the cockles of its supporters'
hearts. Thirteen hits, including two
safeties by Guy and Gus, the twirling
twins, were straightened out off the
crooked-arm shoots of Morrissey.
This array of hits included a home
run, a triple, a double and ten
singles. During the four innings he
was on the mound, Draper allowed
but two singles and struck out two
men, while during Hoever's regime
on the mound St. Ignatius gathered
three hits, one of doubtful quality. In
these three innings Gus also struck
out six men, fanning two men in each
inning.
Score In Third.
With the score tied at one-all when
the varsity came to bat in the third,
Captain Hayes led off with a single.
Lilly then straightened one out to
deep left and walked home before the
ball was back in the infield. Braden
singled, but was forced by Dickey,
who stole second. Wilkins tripled to
right and came home on Campbell's
double. Draper then secured his hit,
the first one of the season, which
scored "Canary." Two more tallies
were gathered in the fifth on four
hits.
St. Ignatius' only run was a gift.
In the third, Draper walked Boyle,
who went to second on Morrissey's
sacrifice, and advanced to third on
an infield out, scoring when Braden
threw Rouleau's grounder wild to
first.
Ken Lilly was the individual bat
ting star, getting a home run and two
singles in four trips to the plate.
Wilkins got a triple and a single in
three trips while "Doc" Hayes and
Campbell each poled two hits, one
of Campbell's being a double.

When Guy Draper and Gus Hoever,
whose collective batting average totals
about .02:], both garner safe hits for
themselves in one afternoon off the
same pitcher, it is very apparent that
that pitcher has nothing more than the
proverbial glove and a prayer.
Hurler Morrissey had little more
than those two articles yesterday af
ternoon, and as Guy and Gus pitched
as well as they batted, Stanford had
no difficulty in downing St. Ignatius,
7-1, in seven innings of rather weird
baseball on the varsity diamond.
Show Up Well.
The showing of the varsity should
warm the cockles of its supporters'
hearts. Thirteen hits, including two
safeties by Guy and Gus, the twirling
twins, were straightened out off the
crooked-arm shoots of Morrissey.
This array of hits included a home
run, a triple, a double and ten
singles. During the four innings he
was on the mound, Draper allowed
but two singles and struck out two
men, while during Hoever's regime
on the mound St. Ignatius gathered
three hits, one of doubtful quality. In
these three innings Gus also struck
out six men, fanning two men in each
inning.
Score In Third.
With the score tied at one-all when
the varsity came to bat in the third,
Captain Hayes led off with a single.
Lilly then straightened one out to
deep left and walked home before the
ball was back in the infield. Braden
singled, but was forced by Dickey,
who stole second. Wilkins tripled to
right and came home on Campbell's
double. Draper then secured his hit,
the first one of the season, which
scored "Canary." Two more tallies
were gathered in the fifth on four
hits.
St. Ignatius' only run was a gift.
In the third, Draper walked Boyle,
who went to second on Morrissey's
sacrifice, and advanced to third on
an infield out, scoring when Braden
threw Rouleau's grounder wild to
first.
Ken Lilly was the individual bat
ting star, getting a home run and two
singles in four trips to the plate.

rissey 3, off Draper 2. Struck Out —

Hoever f>. Passed Ball —O'Neill. Hit
by Pitcher —by Morrissey, Stevens,
Cowan. Thirteen at bat, one run, two
hits, off Draper in four innings. Um
pire—Phelon. Scorer —J. Snell.
When Guy Draper and Gus Hoever,
whose collective batting average totals
about .02:], both garner safe hits for
themselves in one afternoon off the
same pitcher, it is very apparent that
that pitcher has nothing more than the
proverbial glove and a prayer.
Hurler Morrissey had little more
than those two articles yesterday af
ternoon, and as Guy and Gus pitched
as well as they batted, Stanford had
no difficulty in downing St. Ignatius,
7-1, in seven innings of rather weird
baseball on the varsity diamond.
Show Up Well.
The showing of the varsity should
warm the cockles of its supporters'
hearts. Thirteen hits, including two
safeties by Guy and Gus, the twirling
twins, were straightened out off the
crooked-arm shoots of Morrissey.
This array of hits included a home
run, a triple, a double and ten
singles. During the four innings he
was on the mound, Draper allowed
but two singles and struck out two
men, while during Hoever's regime
on the mound St. Ignatius gathered
three hits, one of doubtful quality. In
these three innings Gus also struck
out six men, fanning two men in each
inning.
Score In Third.
With the score tied at one-all when
the varsity came to bat in the third,
Captain Hayes led off with a single.
Lilly then straightened one out to
deep left and walked home before the
ball was back in the infield. Braden
singled, but was forced by Dickey,
who stole second. Wilkins tripled to
right and came home on Campbell's
double. Draper then secured his hit,
the first one of the season, which
scored "Canary." Two more tallies
were gathered in the fifth on four
hits.
St. Ignatius' only run was a gift.
In the third, Draper walked Boyle,
who went to second on Morrissey's
sacrifice, and advanced to third on
an infield out, scoring when Braden
threw Rouleau's grounder wild to
first.
Ken Lilly was the individual bat
ting star, getting a home run and two
singles in four trips to the plate.
Wilkins got a triple and a single in
three trips while "Doc" Hayes and
Campbell each poled two hits, one
of Campbell's being a double.
