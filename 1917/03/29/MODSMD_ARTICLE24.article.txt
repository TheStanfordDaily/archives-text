# Stanford Nine Plays Trojans Wednesday
## Southern Ball Tossers Appear to Have Stronger Club Than Last Year 
### 
Competition between the Stanford
nine and the University of Southern
California will be offered the base
bull fans next Wednesday at 2:30.
The southerners have been offering a
high grade game of baseball in all
their preliminary contests in the south
and from all indications have a much
stronger team than they did a year
ago.
Captain Hayes will probably play
the same lineup that meets California
Saturday, though he may take ad
vantage of the game to give the sub
stitutes a chance. Season tickets or
twenty-five cents will be required for
admission to the game.
