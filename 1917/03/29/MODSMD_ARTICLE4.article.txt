# Flowers and Taxis Are Taboo at Prom
## 
### 
Any misguided person who should
wander aimlessly into Encina gymnas
ium tonight would take one look
around, stare at his surroundings and
then wonder where he was. He would
fail to recognize the gym, for in place
of the plain, gaunt furnishings and
the rafter ceiling, there is nothing but
one mass of green decorations that
seem to be sprouting from the ceiling,
walls and everywhere.
This transformation took place to
day, when countless juniors, under
the direction of F. F. Walker, toiled
all day long in preparation for the
Junior Prom tomorrow night.
Figuring that the presence of all
this greenery will make the presence
of further flowers unnecessary, the
committee has asked all who will be
present at the Prom to follow the an
cient custom of doing away with all
modern contrivances such as bouquets
and taxicabs.
The committee announced today
that the grand march will start
promptly at 8:15, and that all per
sons who have obtained tickets must
present them at the door, as no cash
admittances will be permitted. Pro
grams may be obtained at Wideman's
campus store tomorrow.
