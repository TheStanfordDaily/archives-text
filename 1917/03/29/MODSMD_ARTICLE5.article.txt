# Gunners Are But Fraction of War's Need Says Hoover
## 
### 
H. C. Hoover's idea of what should
be done to enable the United States to
prosecute a war in case of hostilities,
is expressed in an interview written
by Will Irwin in last week's Saturday
Evening Post. Irwin's interview is
with a "Mr. Jones," but it is generally
understood on the campus that Jones
is none other than Hoover, who is
probably better fitted than any other
man living today to get the country
ready for war.
Jones says "Modern warfare is
about one part army, one part navy,
two parts economics, one or two parts
moral forces, and one part finance."
This opinion, from an authoritative
source, gives additional point to the
Preparedness Survey questions, which
concern other than purely military
training. "A man with a university
education ought to be of greater ser
vice through his specialized training
than through carrying a gun," said
President Wilbur in commenting on
this."He ought to multiply himself
a hundred times by teaching others."
