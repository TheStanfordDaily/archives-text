# LAKE SPORTS BRING FORTH ALL QUEENERS
## ROUGHS ALSO THERE Canoe and Tilting Contests to Feature Sports Tomorrow at Lagunita 
### Olga Narvestad, '18 
NATURE could not have provided
a more perfect evening for the
opening events of Junior Week
than last night. Small wonder that
the number of queeners greatly ex
ceeded that of previous years. The
boathouse, outlined in .Japanese lan
terns, and the many canoes with
lanterns at the bow, drifting idly over
the smooth water, combined with the
splendid weather to make the scene
one not to be forgotten.
Not every one was queening, but
judging from the lusty cheering that
greeted each passing couple as the
searchlight marked them out, one
would be justified in believing that
almost everyone was there. This time
the roughs did not have to depend
on their own searchlights. They were
assisted in spotting the queeners by
a huge searchlight from the boat
house, which cast a rude glare on all
who chanced to pass within its radius.
The hand opened the program with
some good selections and the fire
works followed very soon. They
shot off from the side of the lake op
posite the boathouse, and some splen
did new works delighted the specta
tors, though it cannot be said that
they represented the amount of money
that was expended for them. The
natural stars were almost eclipsed by
some of the stars which shot forth
from the rockets and clung tenaciously
to their existence in the air.
Following the fireworks, a huge
"18" flamed up across the lake, and
loud cheers from the throngv pro
claimed the presence of many loyal
juniors.
Promises of selections by the Glee
Club and Mandolin Club had been
made, and it was with a keen sense
of disappointment that everyone
| finally turned to go, after waiting ex-
I pectantly for their appearance. No
singing voices drifted over the water,
and no ukuleles or banjos were
strummed softly with their faint
sounds carrying to the shores. These
things that are so essential to an
ideal evening on the lake, were ab
sent, and one and all felt that some
thing had been lacking. The band
came to the rescue, and its varied
program was well appreciated.
Interclass soccer and freshmen
baseball with California are sched
uled for this afternoon, and in the
evening the mysteries of a pirate isle
will be revealed to a packed house in
the Assembly Hall, where the Junior
Opera will be staged.
Junior Day, Friday, will start events
at 10 a.m., on the lake, when the men
will engage in canoe tilting contests
! and swimming races, and also the in
i terclass crew races. Something un
usual had been promised in the con
tests by the women, but unforseen
obstacles have forced them to be
called off, so it will be up to the men
to furnish the amusement alone.
The track meet between Stanford
and 11. S. C. and L, A. A. C. combined
teams will start promptly at 2:30, at
the track field. Here is a chance to
get a lineup on the material that will
be put up to meet California on
April 21.
At 8:15, Friday evening, the Jun
ior Prom in Encina gymnasium will
wind up the activities of the week,
and Saturday morning will be open
to those who plan to leave for vaca
tion.
