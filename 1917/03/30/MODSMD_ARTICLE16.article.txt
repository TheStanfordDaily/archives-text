# "THE GLORIOUS CLASS"
## 
### 
We are presenting yon today, the Freshman edition of The Daily
Palo Alto, undoubtedly the best paper that has ever been published at
Stanford University. Students who will, it the faculty axe is avoid
ed, graduate in 1920, have been accused on various occasions of lack
ing "jazz." We sincerely hope and believe that the"green sheet
will forever dispel this illusion, for we have in the edition endeavored
to be "different." Of course the glorious class could have edited a
mechanically perfect paper, but such action would put the regular
staff in disrepute. As a result, the Freshman edition will set a prece
dent in Daily Palo Alto journalism.
For the first time in the history of the"green sheet," the Fresh
man staff has a Women's Editor, in the person of Miss Ruth Searcv.
And we would call your attention to the fact that if articles in the
paper are criticised, it is possible that such criticism will be directed
against a member of the "500."
