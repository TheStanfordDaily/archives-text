# "THE SOPHOMORE CAPS"
## 
### 
This week has marked one of the greatest changes that has ever
taken place in the University, namely, the abolition of the spohomore
hat and the substitution by the "Glorious Class" of a sophomore cap.
We feel this will bring the greatest benefits to the 1920 men, for they
will not be forced to humiliate themselves by wearing a hat that has
been used by the class of 1919. The sophomore hat has been a source
of amusement rather than identification for the second-year men.
The new cap should be worn much as the Freshman cap is, with the
dignity befitting personages of such importance.
