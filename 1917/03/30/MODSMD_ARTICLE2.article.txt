# MATTEI WILL PITCH AGAIN AT BERKELEY
## 
### 
On account of the excellent showing
lie made in the box against the Uni
versity of California batsmen, Bert
Alattei will again be on the mound
when the varsity stacks up against
the Hold and Glue team tomorrow af
ternoon on the California diamond.
The team which will start the game
tomorrow will be substantially the
same that opposed California last
FUKSiniAN EDITION 1920
week, but Captain "Doc" Hayes is con
templating several changes. "Shrimp"
Wilkins may occupy the right field
berth as a result of his playing Wed
nesday against St. Ignatius, but this
change is not certain. If his injured
ankle, which has improved greatly
during the past week, permits, Mel
Shriver will undoubtedly break into
the infield .probably at second base.
Captain Hayes is confident that the
game tomorrow, the second in the
series of five, will only be won after
a hard fight. It is expected that Stan
ford, because of the better form the
team always shows when it gets
away from the home diamond, will
come out on the long end of the score.
The team is confident that it has
gained speaking acquaintance with
some of Mr. Dimock's prize crooked
arm offerings and expects to drive the
said Mr. Dimock to the shower under
a shower of resounding hits.
