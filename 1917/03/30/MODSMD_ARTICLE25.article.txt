"AND THEY SHOT LINCOLN "
Scene—Hani in Isolation Hospital—
;"A full house" is present, eleven un
fortunate individuals—so-called —are
esconsced in as many beds, lament
ing the fact Hint they must miss
classes and forgo the broad outlook
which comes from association with
their dear professors. From the ward
above come the bitter-sweet sounds of
an ukulele, accompanied by some ear
splitting notes in high \ that have
roused the chickens in the neighbor
hood from their slumber.
Patient No. I—There goes that fool
dame again. (Louder) Hay, you up
there, what do you think this is? the
Junior Opera? Be (possessed of a
heart and lay off.
Patient No. 1V 2 —Junior Opera—O,
blankety-blank the blank-blank luck.
Junior Opera Do you know where
the queen is? Right next to that
blankety-blank cuss of a Mucky-Nut
(turns his head under the pillows and
sobs).
Voice from Up-stairs—Sometimes
it's sweet and then again it's not—
Say, you guys down there, shut up.
I guess us four girls can play a little
bit if we want to. We paid for this
room and we're going to use it, and
no gang of guys is going to stop us;
isn't that right, girls? (Chorus of
feminine wails).
Patient No. o—Hey,0—Hey, there, No. 1,
lay off; that's my girl, and I won't
have her insulted. Samantha, dear,
please play that tune again; it's so
soft and love-like.
No. IV2 —Lay off there, No. 6, or
I'll bust you in the dome. I want to
get to sleep and forget. Anybody got
any "hooch?" ((Jobs of silence.)
No. (I—Listen here, you; I'm going
to queen here, even if I have got
measles. Had enough to miss Junior
Week, but thank heaven, my girl is
up-stairs, and no gent is swiping her
(goes to window and leans out). O,
Samantha, darling, come to the win
dow; here I am. Look out
No. I—Come back here, you Nut,
and shut that window. Tt's cold.
No. 6 —Chase yourself! Guess r can
get some fresh air, if 1 want to.
Concerted assault by ten occupants
is made upon him. Under the shower
of blows lie goes to the floor and
moans. Regains consciousness and
goes to the window again—a modern
miracle —opens window, leans out and
turns head up to second story.
No. G —O Samantha, honey; look
out the window (sound of window
above opening—comes a noise of fall
ing water). No. 6 —a sorry sight—
falls inside the window and gulps.
He is greeted by tumultuous laughter
FRESHMAN EDITION H>2o
on part of his fellow-sufferers. Comes
the sound of tumult from upstairs—
the wily and wild Samantha has made
assault upon her three roommates
who wielded the pitcher. She is sub
dued).
Chorus of ten measle-bitten elders
—Ha; ha! ha!
Chorus of three measle-stricken co
eds—Ho! ho! ho!
Peace enfolds the Isolation Hos
pital; shades of night fall fast; and
feminine snores are mingled with
heavier snores of males.
Moral—"lise! I to be a queener in
Junior Week; to have the measles;
to be in tlie hospital—This might go
on forever, but we've tilled the re
quired space; so saloon, and many
thanks—'tisell to be a Queener any
time a nil any place, any how and any
! way.
