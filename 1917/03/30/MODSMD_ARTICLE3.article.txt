# 1920 LOSES TO HITTING OF U.C. BABES DRIZZ DAMPENS GAME
## McClain's Stellar Twirling and Heavy Hitting Nets California Four Runs—Cards Scoreless 
### 
Stanford Freshmen lost the first of
a three-game series to the University
of California first-year men yesterday,
on the varsity lot. by a score of 4 to
0. The pitching of McClain and the
ability of the Berkeley "babes" to hit
in pinches were too much for the
Cardinals. But one hit was garnered
off the Blue and Gold heaver, while
Lifur was touched up for seven
bingles, one of them a home run.
Lifur was constantly in difficulty,
since he passed seven men. He
proved to be effective several times
with men on third, but a home run
in the fourth and a double in the
ninth proved to He his undoing.
Cardinal chances looked good in the
fir.-1 inning when Galloway singled.
Pike went out on a fly to center that
looked good for a hit, however, and
this was the only time the Cardinals
threatened.
The Blue and Gold men counted
three times in the fourth inning. Hy
man led off with a single. Dexter was
safe on second and Hyman went to
third when Lifur's throw at first hit
the runner and passed Pike. Hyman
then scored and Dexter was safe at
third on a wild pitch. Wayland cut
off Dexter at the plate on Toomey's
long fly. Davison was given a base

on balls and Stephens homed over
Howes' head, bringing Davison in
ahead of him.
Lifur was steady until the ninth,
when with one down Luddy singled.
McClain hit a homer, but forgot to
touch third, and was out. Luddy
scored on the play, however.
Rain threatened throughout the con
test, and a drizzle fell at times. As
a result the pitchers did not put up
their best brand of ball.
In the eighth and ninth frames,
Knox, Morse and Sparling were sent
in, but they could not stop the Blue
and Gold "babes."
