# 1920 LOSES TO HITTING OF U.C. BABES DRIZZ DAMPENS GAME
## McClain's Stellar Twirling and Heavy Hitting Nets California Four Runsâ€”Cards Scoreless 
### 
Stanford Freshmen lost the first of
a three-game series to the University
of California first-year men yesterday,
on the varsity lot. by a score of 4 to
0. The pitching of McClain and the
ability of the Berkeley "babes" to hit
in pinches were too much for the
Cardinals. But one hit was garnered
off the Blue and Gold heaver, while
Lifur was touched up for seven
bingles, one of them a home run.
Lifur was constantly in difficulty,
since he passed seven men. He
proved to be effective several times
with men on third, but a home run
in the fourth and a double in the
ninth proved to He his undoing.
Cardinal chances looked good in the
fir.-1 inning when Galloway singled.
Pike went out on a fly to center that
looked good for a hit, however, and
this was the only time the Cardinals
threatened.
The Blue and Gold men counted
