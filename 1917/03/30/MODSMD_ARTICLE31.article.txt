## Members of Cast Take Parts in Matchless Style; Perfect Performance 
### 
ASSEMBLY HALL, March 30 (5:59
p.m.)—After much hard toil, The
Daily Palo Alto Special War Corre
spondent lias verified the rumor that
the 1918 Junior Opera was presented
here last night. After cogitating for
fourteen minutes and thirteen seconds
lie happened to think that he wit
nessed the opera. It was called "A
Pirate For A Day," not "A Pilot In
the Hay," as was erroneously stated
on the first page of this issue.
Each actor in the cast—and eacn
actress, too —took his or her part in
matchless style. The songs were per
fect; the scores will long be remem
bered, and will go down in history as
representative of the - best music that
has ever been produced on the cam
pus.
Dark circles under the eyes of each
member of the cast, as well as around
those of Dick Morgan, coach extra
ordinaire, gave mute testimony as tt>
the hours and hours of practice that
FRESHMAN EDITION 1920
the cast had been put through during
the past week in order to reach thb
acme, the high pinnacle, the supreme
I heighths to which the characters at
tained in some of the gripping scenes
j that kept the audience on the qui
i vive several times during the per
| formance.

Jof 1920, who did not wish to offend
j the sensitive feelings of any member
