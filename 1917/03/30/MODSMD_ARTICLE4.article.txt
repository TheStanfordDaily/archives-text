# FROSH TRACK MEN DUE TO DEFEAT YOU SEE
## 
### 
When the 1920 track team of Stan
ford University meets its rivals from
across the bay, a week from tomor
row, on the local cinder path, it will
endeavor not only to win, but to set
a new precedent. Never in the ath
letic history of the two colleges has
a Stanford freshmen track team whip
ped the Blue and Gold. This un
broken string of victories the class
of 1920 will endeavor to smash next
week.
The writer who tries to predict
the outcome of a freshmen contest is
always up against the proposition of
dealing with largely unknown quanti
ties, and it is with this fact in view
that we venture a few opinions.
Upon the showing the two teams
have made this season, the Cardinal
should win with several points to
spare. Although California lias a re
markably well-balanced squad, Stan
ford appears to have the edge.
The Cardinal is well represented in
the sprints and should take at least
half of the points in the 100 and 220,
with Wells, Dinkelspiel, Needham,
Cattern, Minor and Howes running.
There is a possibility that Slonian
will run the 220, in which case we
can figure on several more points.
The best race of the day will un
questionably be the quarter, with
three men of out-of-the-ordinary abil
ity entered. Over at Berkeley they
are figuring on five points in this
event from Captain Carl Goeppert.
Well, Stanford fans all known Frank j
Sloman's ability, and they are just j
beginning to realize that lie lias a
running mate in Merlin Maynard who
is going to make both of the big stars
"shake a leg" to win.
Johnny Wilke of Pasadena is Stan
ford's best bet in the half-mile, lie
should be doing close to two minutes
by next Saturday, which should give
Mr. Goeppert cause for worry if he
goes into this event, as now appears
likely. Westwick, Carlyle, Esgen and
Albouze are Stanford's other en
trants.
The Cardinal should have things her
way in the mile and two-mile. Cali
fornia appears to be weak in both
events. "Flave" Colglazier has al
ready proved liis ability, while Ter
man, Davis, Sturgeon and Belfonl all
stand good chances of placing.
When the season opened it looked
as though we would be weak in the
hurdles, but Wells and Davis have
both developed into good stick climb
ers.
Stanford looks to be equally strong
in the field events, and stands a good
chance of taking three out of the five
first places, together with a good
share of the seconds and thirds.
Davis has been pole vaulting over 11
feet, and judging from the height
which the California vaulters have
been getting, this should be sood for
a first. Dooing was going well in the
event until he hurt his ankle last
week, but he siill has a chance to get
into the meet. Sheldon and Baer have
been clearing 10 feet.
Stanford has a trio of star high
junipers in Weaver, Heath and Shel
don. The first two have been hovering
around the six foot mark all season.
Lyon looks like Stanford's best bet
in the broad jump, and should be
good for about 21 feet in the meet.
Otto Nagel lias been forced to quit
track.
The weights are very uncertain, but
Stanford has several husky entrants.
Scott has been tossing the hammer
around 120 feet, while Findley and
Coonse have been throwing it around
100 feet. Scott, Wyckoff, Cowin and
Duncan are Stanford's shot putters.
If the meet depends upon the relay,
Coach Templeton is more than con
fident of the result. Who wouldn't be
I with a string of quarter-milers like
; Slonian, Maynard, Wells, Davis, Need
ham and Cattern to pick from?
Editor's Note —The writer of this
article, Milton Francis Samis, is cap
tain of the glorious and honorable
Freshman track team. Although he
is modest, even to the point of al
ways blushing, and lias not men
tioned his name in this story, the
Freshman staff of The Daily Palo
Alto has collected $4.96 and twenty
three beer checks of doubtful value,
with which to back Milton Francis
against any California man in the
one and two-mile events.

The Cardinal is well represented in
the sprints and should take at least
half of the points in the 100 and 220,
with Wells, Dinkelspiel, Needham,
Cattern, Minor and Howes running.
There is a possibility that Slonian
will run the 220, in which case we
can figure on several more points.
The best race of the day will un
questionably be the quarter, with
three men of out-of-the-ordinary abil
ity entered. Over at Berkeley they
are figuring on five points in this
event from Captain Carl Goeppert.
Well, Stanford fans all known Frank j
Sloman's ability, and they are just j
beginning to realize that lie lias a
running mate in Merlin Maynard who
is going to make both of the big stars
"shake a leg" to win.
Johnny Wilke of Pasadena is Stan
ford's best bet in the half-mile, lie
should be doing close to two minutes
by next Saturday, which should give
Mr. Goeppert cause for worry if he
goes into this event, as now appears
likely. Westwick, Carlyle, Esgen and
Albouze are Stanford's other en
trants.
The Cardinal should have things her
way in the mile and two-mile. Cali
fornia appears to be weak in both
events. "Flave" Colglazier has al
ready proved liis ability, while Ter
man, Davis, Sturgeon and Belfonl all
stand good chances of placing.
When the season opened it looked
as though we would be weak in the
hurdles, but Wells and Davis have
both developed into good stick climb
ers.
Stanford looks to be equally strong
in the field events, and stands a good
chance of taking three out of the five
first places, together with a good
share of the seconds and thirds.
Davis has been pole vaulting over 11
feet, and judging from the height
which the California vaulters have
been getting, this should be sood for
a first. Dooing was going well in the
event until he hurt his ankle last
week, but he siill has a chance to get
into the meet. Sheldon and Baer have
been clearing 10 feet.
Stanford has a trio of star high
junipers in Weaver, Heath and Shel
don. The first two have been hovering
around the six foot mark all season.
Lyon looks like Stanford's best bet
in the broad jump, and should be
good for about 21 feet in the meet.
Otto Nagel lias been forced to quit
track.
The weights are very uncertain, but
Stanford has several husky entrants.
Scott has been tossing the hammer
around 120 feet, while Findley and
Coonse have been throwing it around
100 feet. Scott, Wyckoff, Cowin and
Duncan are Stanford's shot putters.
If the meet depends upon the relay,
Coach Templeton is more than con
fident of the result. Who wouldn't be
I with a string of quarter-milers like
; Slonian, Maynard, Wells, Davis, Need
ham and Cattern to pick from?

ford's best bet in the half-mile, lie
should be doing close to two minutes
by next Saturday, which should give
Mr. Goeppert cause for worry if he
goes into this event, as now appears
likely. Westwick, Carlyle, Esgen and
Albouze are Stanford's other en
trants.
The Cardinal should have things her
way in the mile and two-mile. Cali
fornia appears to be weak in both
events. "Flave" Colglazier has al
ready proved liis ability, while Ter
man, Davis, Sturgeon and Belfonl all
stand good chances of placing.
When the season opened it looked
as though we would be weak in the
hurdles, but Wells and Davis have
both developed into good stick climb
ers.
Stanford looks to be equally strong
in the field events, and stands a good
chance of taking three out of the five
first places, together with a good
share of the seconds and thirds.
Davis has been pole vaulting over 11
feet, and judging from the height
which the California vaulters have
been getting, this should be sood for
a first. Dooing was going well in the
event until he hurt his ankle last
week, but he siill has a chance to get
into the meet. Sheldon and Baer have
been clearing 10 feet.
Stanford has a trio of star high
junipers in Weaver, Heath and Shel
don. The first two have been hovering
around the six foot mark all season.
Lyon looks like Stanford's best bet
in the broad jump, and should be
good for about 21 feet in the meet.
Otto Nagel lias been forced to quit
track.
The weights are very uncertain, but
Stanford has several husky entrants.
Scott has been tossing the hammer
around 120 feet, while Findley and
Coonse have been throwing it around
100 feet. Scott, Wyckoff, Cowin and
Duncan are Stanford's shot putters.
If the meet depends upon the relay,
Coach Templeton is more than con
fident of the result. Who wouldn't be
I with a string of quarter-milers like
; Slonian, Maynard, Wells, Davis, Need
ham and Cattern to pick from?

tain of the glorious and honorable
Freshman track team. Although he
is modest, even to the point of al
ways blushing, and lias not men
tioned his name in this story, the
Freshman staff of The Daily Palo
Alto has collected $4.96 and twenty
three beer checks of doubtful value,
with which to back Milton Francis
against any California man in the
one and two-mile events.
