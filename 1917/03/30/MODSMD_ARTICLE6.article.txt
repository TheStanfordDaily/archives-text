# "Flower of Society" to Dance To-Night
## 
### 
Junior Prom —the Queeners' Para
dise and the last stand in Junior
Week —will be given tonight in the
transformed Encina gymnasium. The
so-called "Flower of Stanford's so
city" will line 11 p for the kick-off at
S: 1 r>; and the struggle will continue
until 1:30, providing any of the con
testants remain standing at that time.
The referee has not. as yet been
named, bur the chaperones will act as
time-keepers and umpires. The Prom
will be a "real rough affair," as no
taxicabs and no flowers will be per
mitted. The rules also specify clean
breaks and no hitting in the clinches.
Good eats are promised, so that a
full representation of roughs is de
sired.
