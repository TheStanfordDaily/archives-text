# BE READY WHEN TIME COMES PRESIDENT WILBUR AND WAR CHIEFS URGE
## STUDENT COUNCIL AIMS BLOW AT CHAPARRAL EDITOR IS DEPOSED Chappie Man Denies Right of Council to Control the Editorial Policy 
### 
Because of "incompetent judgment
which has on several occasions tended
to injure the University and the stu
dent body," the Men's Student Coun
cil has recommended that Lansing
Warren, '17, editor of Chaparral, be
removed from his official position and
be required to sever all connection
with the management of the publica
tion.
The action, which is the most dras
tic ever taken by the Men's Council,
has been signed by President Wilbur,
Associate Professor E. P. Lesley,
chairman of the Faculty Committee
on Student Affairs, and J. W. Temple
ton, '17, president of the Council.
The removal is the result of the edi
torial policy of Chaparral which, on
several occasions it is declared was
of distinct injury to the best inter
ests of the student body. Arrange
ments for the future editorial manage
ment of Chaparral have not yet been
made. A meeting of Hammer and
Coffin Society will be held very short
ly to take up action on the Council
ruling.
