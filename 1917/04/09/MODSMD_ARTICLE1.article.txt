# BE READY WHEN TIME COMES PRESIDENT WILBUR AND WAR CHIEFS URGE
## STUDENT COUNCIL AIMS BLOW AT CHAPARRAL EDITOR IS DEPOSED Chappie Man Denies Right of Council to Control the Editorial Policy 
### 
Because of "incompetent judgment
which has on several occasions tended
to injure the University and the stu
dent body," the Men's Student Coun
cil has recommended that Lansing
Warren, '17, editor of Chaparral, be
removed from his official position and
be required to sever all connection
with the management of the publica
tion.
The action, which is the most dras
tic ever taken by the Men's Council,
has been signed by President Wilbur,
Associate Professor E. P. Lesley,
chairman of the Faculty Committee
on Student Affairs, and J. W. Temple
ton, '17, president of the Council.
The removal is the result of the edi
torial policy of Chaparral which, on
several occasions it is declared was
of distinct injury to the best inter
ests of the student body. Arrange
ments for the future editorial manage
ment of Chaparral have not yet been
made. A meeting of Hammer and
Coffin Society will be held very short
ly to take up action on the Council
ruling.
Warren arrived on the campus late
this afternoon, and after a confer
ence with President Wilbur declined
to accept the ruling of the Student
Council deposing him from the office,
on the grounds that he had been given
no previous hearing, that he had an
swered all charges made against him,
and that the constitution of the Stu
dent Body gave the Council no author
ity to remove a Chaparral editor, who
is named by the Hammer and Coffin
Society, an independent organization.
"I do not consider that the Men's
Student Council is empowered to re
move the editor of Chaparral," said
Warren. "There is nothing in the
constitution of the Student Body to
justify the action. Hammer and Coffin
is, and always has been, an organiza
tion independent of the Student Body,
and Student Body officers have never
had any power in election or control
of its officers." Warren delivered his
ultimatum in a letter to the Council
today.
.The Council ruling follows:
The Men's Student Council recom
mends that the editor of a student
publication be removed from his ed
itorial position because of incom
petent judgment which has on sev
eral occasions tended to injure the
University and the Student Body.
By virtue of this action, the stu
dent indicated must actually sever
all connection, both official and un
official, with the editorial manage
ment of the magazine.

swered all charges made against him,
and that the constitution of the Stu
dent Body gave the Council no author
ity to remove a Chaparral editor, who
is named by the Hammer and Coffin
Society, an independent organization.
"I do not consider that the Men's
Student Council is empowered to re
move the editor of Chaparral," said
Warren. "There is nothing in the
constitution of the Student Body to
justify the action. Hammer and Coffin
is, and always has been, an organiza
tion independent of the Student Body,
and Student Body officers have never
had any power in election or control
of its officers." Warren delivered his
ultimatum in a letter to the Council
today.
.The Council ruling follows:
The Men's Student Council recom
mends that the editor of a student
publication be removed from his ed
itorial position because of incom
petent judgment which has on sev
eral occasions tended to injure the
University and the Student Body.
By virtue of this action, the stu
dent indicated must actually sever
all connection, both official and un
official, with the editorial manage
ment of the magazine.
Because of "incompetent judgment
which has on several occasions tended
to injure the University and the stu
dent body," the Men's Student Coun
cil has recommended that Lansing
Warren, '17, editor of Chaparral, be
removed from his official position and
be required to sever all connection
with the management of the publica
tion.
The action, which is the most dras
tic ever taken by the Men's Council,
has been signed by President Wilbur,
Associate Professor E. P. Lesley,
chairman of the Faculty Committee
on Student Affairs, and J. W. Temple
ton, '17, president of the Council.
The removal is the result of the edi
torial policy of Chaparral which, on
several occasions it is declared was
of distinct injury to the best inter
ests of the student body. Arrange
ments for the future editorial manage
ment of Chaparral have not yet been
made. A meeting of Hammer and
Coffin Society will be held very short
ly to take up action on the Council
ruling.
Warren arrived on the campus late
this afternoon, and after a confer
ence with President Wilbur declined
to accept the ruling of the Student
Council deposing him from the office,
on the grounds that he had been given
no previous hearing, that he had an
swered all charges made against him,
and that the constitution of the Stu
dent Body gave the Council no author
ity to remove a Chaparral editor, who
is named by the Hammer and Coffin
Society, an independent organization.
"I do not consider that the Men's
Student Council is empowered to re
