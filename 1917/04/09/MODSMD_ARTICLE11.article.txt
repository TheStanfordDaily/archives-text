# Military Camping Trip Is a Whizz
## Would-be Officers Spend Week Eujoying Country Life and Andy's Cooking 
### 
Sixty Stanford embryo officers suc
cessfully withstood tne attacks or
wood-ticks, poison oak, lizards, thirst,
and overwork, last week, at a mili
tary camp at the Hermit's. They re
turned to the campus Saturday look
ing much the worse for a long walk
with twenty-pound packs and eleven
pound rifles, led by their tireless ser
geant, Jewell (without pack or rifle).
Everybody Works.
From"I can't get 'em up" at 6 In
the morning, to taps, at 9:30 p.m.,
everybody was busy. Military tactics
and practice was all that they had
time to think about. Major Bugge
was out at camp daily and lectures
in the morning and field work in the
afternoon were in order. The sub
jects covered were patrols, outposts,
advance guard, attack and defense,
interior guarding duty, to say nothing
of complete and exhaustive illustrated
lessons on how to dig holes in the
ground, and the duty of a kitchen
flunky.
Sergeants Jewell and Hates were in
direction of the camp, which was
voted unanimously a great success.
Sergeant Bartels, quartermaster, and
Andy, the king of the kitchen, won
the undying gratitude of the pros
pective generals by providing chick
ens, steaks, soup, beans and dessert
in quantities enough for an ordinary
regiment.
Private Martin, associate professor
of Greek, had a twelve-piece band on
band, and the soldiers dug trenches
to sweet music. Private Brown, as
sistant professor of Philosophy,
starred on the bass drum. L. P. do
Vries, instructor in Romanic Langu
ages. and P. 0. Foster, associate pro
fessor of Latin, were the otber mem
bers of the faculty to sleep on straw,
run a mile before breakfast, and carry
tobacco in their cartridge belts.
