# ALL COLLEGE MEN NOT NEEDED IN ARMY
## KEEP COOL-WILBUR Bigger Demand for Training in Other Branches Later Says President 
### 
"College men need not rush blindly
to enlist, unless they prefer the army
to other forms of war service," stated
President Wilbur today, speaking of
the duty of Stanford men in the pres
ent war crisis. "Brains will be need
ed in a few months more than now.
"England is an example of what we
must avoid doing with our college
trained men. There she had to call
many of them back from the army to
handle other problems and in many
cases it was too late. Many of her
best trained men had been killed.
Advisory Hoards At Work.
"In this country advisory boards
are now considering the problems of
chemistry, bacteriology, health con
servation, food supplies, military
roads, Red Cross work, manufactur
ing, and many other phases of war
fare. When organization is effected
through these commissions it will be
the college men we have to call on
to do this work.
"College men should hold them
selves in readiness to undertake work
when called upon. We will have
many calls in time. Of course, a man
who prefers army service should ap
ply for a commission and enlist, but
there will be a bigger demand for
men with training when the nation is
fully organized on a war basis."
President Wilbur's views are heart
ily endorsed by others in the faculty
who have been in close touch with
the progress of the war, and who have
followed the problems in foreign
countries.
Views Are Endorsed.
In a telegram to Benjamin Ide
Wheeler, president of the University
of California, Major General J. Frank
lin Bell, commander of the Western
Department, made the following state
ment:
"I am informed that a number of
students of the University of Cali
fornia have enlisted. Of course,
everyone appreciates highly the mo
tives leading these young men to this
action, but it is very desirable that
this impulse on the part of the stu
dent body should be restrained at this
time for a few days at least. I think
it highly important, that your portion
of your student body available for
military duty should be held as nearly
intact as possible until the plans of
the War Department, now in process
of formulation, are completed and
published. Tentative plans known at
these headquarters will permit of all
of the senior class in your military
department entering three months'
training course preparatory to com
missions as officers.
"T believe it is highly probable that
such modification of the tentative reg
ulations will be made as will permit
juniors also to enter this training
course. The use to which other
classes can be put is yet to be de
termined. but T think for the present
they can render the government the
best service bv continuing in their
regular course of instruction at the
university. With your permission T
shall give this telegram to the press
for the benefit of other institutions in
this department to which similar ad
vice may apply."
