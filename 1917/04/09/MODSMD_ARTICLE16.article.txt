# TO GIVE OUR BEST
## 
### 
Universities of the United States, and among them Stanford, are in this
time of national crisis, confronted with the problem of how best they may
be of service to the country. Many of us who have been given the priv
ilege of a college training have that to offer which is of greater value
in fields other than purely military. The army and navy are not alone to
be considered. Will Irwin published an interview with a "Mr. Jones" sev
eral days ago, in which "Mr. Jones" said, "Modern warfare is about one
part army, one part navy, two parts economics, one or two parts moral
forces, and one part finance." "Jones" is understood to be H. C. Hoover,
the man who, of all others, is perhaps the most capable of putting the
United States in the way of carrying on a war, and the man who will
probably do it. There are others of us, it is true, who have no special
qualification, and for whom the army and navy are the fields in which we
can best serve, but we should not make the mistake of rushing in "where
the bullets are the thickest," without first considering if that is the place
where we are most needed.
With this thought in mind, we wish again to urge that the prepared
ness survey blanks sent out by the University be returned with all speed.
Thus far about half remain unanswered, rendering the statistics quite in
adequate. If this information is to be of any use to the government, it
must be secured at once. That it will be useful in guiding the adminis
tration toward a proper distribution of its resources can hardly be
doubted.
Contrary to a widespread opinion, this is not a purely local affair.
Universities throughout the country are engaged in collecting just such in
formation as is asked for on the blanks sent out here. An article in this
issue of The Daily Palo Alto tells something of the nature and scope of the
movement.
It is extremely important that some answer be given, so that the de
pendable resources of the University may be measured. It is not neces
sary, however, to answer plainly "yes" or "no." Opinions may differ on
what an emergency is, and it is permissable to express any such qualifica
tions of the questions asked on the blank. Also, though we would natur
ally wish to back our answer by action when required, there is nothing
in signing the blank which compels ohc to serve.
While this is a voluntary matter, it seems to us that we owe an an
swer of some kind, if for no other reason, to prove that we are alive and
thinking—not mere negative and careless individuals.

We are glad to see the University take the only right and reasonable
step in allowing full credit to those who go into service with passing
grades. With the possibility of losing credit for almost an entire semes
ter's work eliminated, each student feels freer and more willing to serve
if called upon. It only remains to decide where we can do the most good.

Contrary to a widespread opinion, this is not a purely local affair.
Universities throughout the country are engaged in collecting just such in
formation as is asked for on the blanks sent out here. An article in this
issue of The Daily Palo Alto tells something of the nature and scope of the
movement.
It is extremely important that some answer be given, so that the de
pendable resources of the University may be measured. It is not neces
sary, however, to answer plainly "yes" or "no." Opinions may differ on
what an emergency is, and it is permissable to express any such qualifica
tions of the questions asked on the blank. Also, though we would natur
ally wish to back our answer by action when required, there is nothing
in signing the blank which compels ohc to serve.
While this is a voluntary matter, it seems to us that we owe an an
swer of some kind, if for no other reason, to prove that we are alive and
thinking—not mere negative and careless individuals.

We are glad to see the University take the only right and reasonable
step in allowing full credit to those who go into service with passing
grades. With the possibility of losing credit for almost an entire semes
ter's work eliminated, each student feels freer and more willing to serve
if called upon. It only remains to decide where we can do the most good.
Universities of the United States, and among them Stanford, are in this
time of national crisis, confronted with the problem of how best they may
be of service to the country. Many of us who have been given the priv
ilege of a college training have that to offer which is of greater value
in fields other than purely military. The army and navy are not alone to
be considered. Will Irwin published an interview with a "Mr. Jones" sev
eral days ago, in which "Mr. Jones" said, "Modern warfare is about one
part army, one part navy, two parts economics, one or two parts moral
forces, and one part finance." "Jones" is understood to be H. C. Hoover,
the man who, of all others, is perhaps the most capable of putting the
United States in the way of carrying on a war, and the man who will
probably do it. There are others of us, it is true, who have no special
qualification, and for whom the army and navy are the fields in which we
can best serve, but we should not make the mistake of rushing in "where
the bullets are the thickest," without first considering if that is the place
where we are most needed.
With this thought in mind, we wish again to urge that the prepared
ness survey blanks sent out by the University be returned with all speed.
Thus far about half remain unanswered, rendering the statistics quite in
adequate. If this information is to be of any use to the government, it
must be secured at once. That it will be useful in guiding the adminis
tration toward a proper distribution of its resources can hardly be
doubted.
