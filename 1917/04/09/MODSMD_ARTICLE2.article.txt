# Local Nine Defeats Bears in Fast Game
## Victory Gives Cardinals Fighting Chance to Win Championship In Last Contest 
### 
Four games at least will be neces
sary to decide the 1917 baseball cham
pionship between Stanford and the
University of California. One week
ago the followers of the Cardinal ball
tossers were in the depths of despair,
for, as the sad story goes, the Bruins
had walloped the cohorts of Coach
Wilson by a 16 to 2 count. There
are not enough words in the ordinary
diamond vernacular to accurately de
scribe the terrible slaughter on the
Blue and Gold field. Last Saturday
saw a remarkable change in form,
and playing as they did in the initial
contest of the series, the local nine
defeated the Bears by a 3 to 1 score.
The games now stand two to one in
favor of the opponents.
Big (Jiis Chucks Fill.
Big Gus Hoever came into his own
on the Stanford ball lot, and twirled
as he has seldom done since first ap
pearing in a Cardinal uniform four
years ago. He held the hard-hitting
Californians to three bingles, no two
coming in the same inning. He had
his game well in hand at all times,
and even sent the renowned slugger,
Ray Rohvver, back to the bench de
cidedly hit less. In fact, Hoever fan
ned out the home-run king in a bad
pinch.
Mel Shriver was the second hero of
the victory. After warming the play
ers' seat in the dugout practically all
season on account of a serious in
jury, he stepped into his regular sec
ond base position Saturday, and fea
tured the contest by his brilliant
fielding and heavy batting. Shriver is
the best natural ball player that has
cavorted in a Stanford suit since the
time of Zeb Terry.
Second Game Was Poor.
In the second game of the series,
both Mattei and Draper were hit hard.
To make matters worse, the team
played miserable baseball, and con
tributed eight errors to the tragedy.
No accurate box score has been pub
lished because the scorers got writer's
cramp and were unable to give a com
plete account of the errors.
