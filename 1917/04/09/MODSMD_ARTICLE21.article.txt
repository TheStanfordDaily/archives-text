The Intercollegiate Intelligence Bu
reau was formed in Washington, D.
C., on February 10 of this year as a
result of a conference of delegates
representing some twenty-five or
thirty American colleges and univer
sities. Before the organization of the
Bureau, Secretary of War Baker and
Secretary of the Navy Daniels were
consulted and heartily approved its
purpose and object, which are stated
in the Constitution to be "to prepare
for the government of the United
States, at its request, the names of
American college students and alumni
having the characteristics and train
ing specified in the request, and who
would be willing to enter the service
of the government in time of ex
pected or actual war; and further, to
do such things as its organization
may permit, when called upon by tne
national government."
The Bureau was organized by the
election of the following officers:
Director, Dr. William McClellan, Dean
of the Wharton School of Finance,
University of Pennsylvania; treasurer,
Charles E. Howe; members of the
executive committee, Surgeon-General
William C. Gorgas, David Jayne Hill,
and W. S. Gifford, Director of the
Council of National Defense.
In order to obtain the information
desired, local committees are being
appointed in each college and univer
sity, over fifty being now in active op
eration. The Stanford committee, as
appointed by President Wilbur, con
sists of Mr. John E. McDowell, the
adjutant of this University, as chair
man; Dr. H. R. Stolz, Professor J. P.
Mitchell and Professor M. R. Kirk
wood, representing the alumni; Pro
fessor H. C. Brown and Professor D.
F. Grass, representing the faculty,
and Mr. Frank C. McColloch, repre
senting the student body. This com
mittee has sent out to the faculty and
students of the University, and will
shortly send to th alumni, a blank
requesting information as to the pres
ent characteristics and training along
all lines which may be of value to the
country in time of war. As rapidly as
the blanks are returned the commit
tee's organizing and classifying the
information received.
Tt is obvious that such material to
be of use to the national government
in this time of emergency must be
collected immediately. For this rea
son the committee urges all those
who have received the blanks to fill
them out and return them at the very
earliest possible moment. Unwill
ingness to accept enrollment for duty
in emergency should not deter any
one from returning the blank. Also
it is perfectly proper to attach any
qualification or condition to an affirm
ative answer to this question that
may be desired.
The important thing is that the
blank be filled out in some form and
returned immediately. While this is
a purely voluntary matter it is hoped
that Stanford men and women will
show their loyalty and patriotism by
their unanimity of action in furnish
ing the information desired. Any who
have lost or mislaid their blanks may
obtain additional ones from Mr. Mc-
Dowell at the Registrar's Office.

sity, over fifty being now in active op
eration. The Stanford committee, as
appointed by President Wilbur, con

adjutant of this University, as chair
man; Dr. H. R. Stolz, Professor J. P.

wood, representing the alumni; Pro
fessor H. C. Brown and Professor D.
F. Grass, representing the faculty,
and Mr. Frank C. McColloch, repre
senting the student body. This com
mittee has sent out to the faculty and
students of the University, and will
shortly send to th alumni, a blank
requesting information as to the pres
ent characteristics and training along
all lines which may be of value to the
country in time of war. As rapidly as
the blanks are returned the commit
tee's organizing and classifying the
information received.
Tt is obvious that such material to
be of use to the national government
in this time of emergency must be
collected immediately. For this rea
son the committee urges all those
who have received the blanks to fill
them out and return them at the very
earliest possible moment. Unwill
ingness to accept enrollment for duty
in emergency should not deter any
one from returning the blank. Also
it is perfectly proper to attach any
qualification or condition to an affirm
ative answer to this question that
may be desired.
The important thing is that the
blank be filled out in some form and
returned immediately. While this is
a purely voluntary matter it is hoped
that Stanford men and women will
show their loyalty and patriotism by
their unanimity of action in furnish
ing the information desired. Any who
have lost or mislaid their blanks may
obtain additional ones from Mr. Mc-
Dowell at the Registrar's Office.

The Intercollegiate Intelligence Bu
reau was formed in Washington, D.
C., on February 10 of this year as a
result of a conference of delegates
representing some twenty-five or
thirty American colleges and univer
sities. Before the organization of the
Bureau, Secretary of War Baker and
Secretary of the Navy Daniels were
consulted and heartily approved its
purpose and object, which are stated
in the Constitution to be "to prepare
for the government of the United
States, at its request, the names of
American college students and alumni
having the characteristics and train
ing specified in the request, and who
would be willing to enter the service
of the government in time of ex
pected or actual war; and further, to
do such things as its organization
may permit, when called upon by tne
national government."
The Bureau was organized by the
election of the following officers:
Director, Dr. William McClellan, Dean
of the Wharton School of Finance,
University of Pennsylvania; treasurer,
Charles E. Howe; members of the
executive committee, Surgeon-General
William C. Gorgas, David Jayne Hill,
and W. S. Gifford, Director of the
Council of National Defense.
In order to obtain the information
desired, local committees are being
appointed in each college and univer
sity, over fifty being now in active op
eration. The Stanford committee, as
appointed by President Wilbur, con
