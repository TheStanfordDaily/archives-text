# Auto Bus Will Run on Row Every Hour
## 
### 
Students living on Lasuen will no
longer have to expend their precious
breath in vain attempts to escape a
cut. by arriving at class on time here
after. They will lie enabled to sleep
fifteen minutes longer in the morn
ing, go back and forth from the anat
omy building to the extreme end of
the row for lunch, and return Tor an
afternoon class with time to spare, by
reason of an auto-bus service started
today by the Peninsula Railway Com
pany. The big red bus, which seats
twenty-four persons, will run on a
regular schedule, starting from in
front of the Phi Gamma Delta house
on the hour, reaching the quadrangle
in three minutes and the anatomy
building in seven minutes. The re
turn trip will start at. ten minutes
after the hour.
The fare is five cents a ride, but as
soon as it is feasible books will be
sold with rides at two and one-half
cents. Transfers are given from the
bus to the Palo Alto line with no ex
tra charge.
