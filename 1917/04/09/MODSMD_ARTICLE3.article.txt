Stanford's swimming team, return
ing to the campus from southern Cali
fornia on the steamship "Yale,"
ceased being "gentlemen of leisure"
when that vessel sailed from San
Pedro, Saturday afternoon, and be
came ordinary waiters, stewards,
cooks, and bottle washers.
When the"Yale" docked yesterday
the "scabs" pro tem sneaked down
the gangplank, fearing the eagle eye
of the Union. For they had broken a
protest strike launched by the steam
er's culinary crew as the ship was
about to cast off. The methods used
came from the fertile brain of a mem
ber of the Cardinal swimming team.
"We'll break that strike for you,"
said the water duck to the skipper.
"Some of us have had several years'
course in 'hashin'! Let those cooks
and waiters stay where they are. No,
I'm not joking. This is straight. Arc
you on?"
The captain was very much on.
The students set to their task with a
will. Three professional cooks were
impressed into service and the under
graduates became waiters, bus boys,
dishwashers, driers and niaitres
d'hotel. As a result, the passengers
on the"Yale" missed no meals, and
the Stanford strike-breakers, in addi
tion to many tips, received ten dollars
each from the steamship company.
