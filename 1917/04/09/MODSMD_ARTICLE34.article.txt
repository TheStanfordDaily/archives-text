# Washington Oarsmen Arrive From North
## 
### 
University of Washington's varsity
and freshmen crews arrived in Berk
eley the first of the week and have
been working out under Coach Conne
bear on the estuary. Both the boats
average high and the northern sup
porters are expecting a victory.
California's eights are fast round
ing into shape. The varsity shell
contains several of last year's fresh
men and has been showing good form.
The freshmen and second varsity
boats are still unsettled, but the
"dope" seems to favor strong com
binations.
Coach "Husky" Guerena has been
experimenting with different men and
no definite arrangement of either var
sity or 1920 crews has been made. At
present Captain Rix Maurer has been
shifted from his old position at stroke
and King, freshman stroke last year,
has been put into his place. Maurer
has been rowing at No. 2. All the
other candidates have been in the
first boat.
