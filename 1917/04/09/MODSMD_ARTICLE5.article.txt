# Recital Wednesday by Fritz Kreisler
## 
### 
Fritz Kreisler, the greatest violinist
of the present generation, will be
heard in a violin recital in Assembly
Hall, Wednesday evening, at 8:30. He
is giving a series of recitals in San
Francisco and Oakland. Kreisler, an
Austrian, enlisted in the army soon
after the beginning of war in Europe.
Since then he has been attempting by
means of the common appeal of music
to all people to lessen the antagon
