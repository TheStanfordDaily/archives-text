# T.E. Swigart Calls Student Assembly
## 
### 
President T. B. Swigart, '17, has
called a meeting of the student body
for Thursday morning at 11 o'clock,
in the Assembly Hall, to further dis
cuss the changes proposed for the
constitution of the Associated Student
Body, affecting officers of the asso
ciation, committees, student publica
tions, and class financial accountings.
Because of the opposition to the
control by the Executive Committee
and Council of editorial policies a
committee headed by K. E. Leib was
appointed to rewrite such portions of
the revised constitution as they
thought necessary.
