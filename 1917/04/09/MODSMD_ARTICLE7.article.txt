# War May Stop Plans for Senior Events
## 
### 
War in all probability will seriously
interfere with Senior Week activi
ties, according to E. It. Ames, presi
dent of the Senior Class, who has
called a meeting for tomorrow at 1
p.m., in room 214, at which time the
advisability of cancelling Senior Week
will be discussed.
The events affected include the
Senior Farce, the carnival, the out
door prom, and the senior ball. Re
hearsals for the farce have already
been abandoned and are not likely to
be resumed. Whether or not the
class carries out its Senior Week
schedule depends on action taken to
morrow at the class meeting.
