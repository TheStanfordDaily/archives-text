# INTENSIVE DRILL TO START AT ONCE
## MEN WILL GET HOURS Training Not Limited to Members of Reserve Officers' Training Corps 
### 
Intensive military training will be
established at Stanford immediately to
prepare all men who volunteer for
commissions in the army. Men who
take the training instead of continu
ing college work can get all their
hours for the present semester, but
in order to take it they must be in
good standing in all their studies,
must attend the military work regu
larly and must make a satisfactory
showing in the training.
Military training will be absolutely
voluntary, and is open not only to
members of the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps, but to any man who
wishes to apply for a commission in
the Officers' Reserve Corps, and who
shows sufficient promise of
cepted.

In addition to training hundreds of
men for active service as officers in
the army, Stanford has placed its en
tire equipment in the hands of the
State Council of Defense, of which
President Wilbur is a member, in case
they can use it or any part of it. The
preparedness survey answers are
coming in rapidly and these will be
classified as quickly as possible so as
to be of service to the government.
Much of the details of the part
Stanford will play in helping the
United States in the present war will
be determined by the actions taken
by Congress during the present spec
ial session, but President Wilbur
states that the University will be in a
position to render service in the most
Intelligent way when called upon.
Going into the intensive training is
not equivalent to enlisting, according
to Major Bugge, and men who take it
will not be compelled to go into the
war any more than those who do not.
