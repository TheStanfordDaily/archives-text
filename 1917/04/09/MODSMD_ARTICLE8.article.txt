# INTENSIVE DRILL TO START AT ONCE
## MEN WILL GET HOURS Training Not Limited to Members of Reserve Officers' Training Corps 
### 
Intensive military training will be
established at Stanford immediately to
prepare all men who volunteer for
commissions in the army. Men who
take the training instead of continu
ing college work can get all their
hours for the present semester, but
in order to take it they must be in
good standing in all their studies,
must attend the military work regu
larly and must make a satisfactory
showing in the training.
Military training will be absolutely
voluntary, and is open not only to
members of the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps, but to any man who
wishes to apply for a commission in
the Officers' Reserve Corps, and who
shows sufficient promise of
cepted.

In addition to training hundreds of
men for active service as officers in
the army, Stanford has placed its en
tire equipment in the hands of the
State Council of Defense, of which
President Wilbur is a member, in case
they can use it or any part of it. The
preparedness survey answers are
coming in rapidly and these will be
classified as quickly as possible so as
to be of service to the government.
Much of the details of the part
Stanford will play in helping the
United States in the present war will
be determined by the actions taken
by Congress during the present spec
ial session, but President Wilbur
states that the University will be in a
position to render service in the most
Intelligent way when called upon.
Going into the intensive training is
not equivalent to enlisting, according
to Major Bugge, and men who take it
will not be compelled to go into the
war any more than those who do not.
However, in case men are drafted the
men who have taken training and who
can qualify for commissions will go
in as officers instead of as privates.
Men under 21 can take the training
so as to be ready to apply for commis
sions when they come of age. In
case men are drafted at 20 or 19, it
is probable that men of these ages
that have trained can go in as of
ficers also.
In order to get their hours men
that take the intensive drill must con
tinue training until the close of the
college year. Work will probably be
trom 8 to 12 and from 1 to 4 every
day.
Stanford students leaving for the
army and navy war service before the
end of the term will be credited with
the hours they are carrying provided
they are up in their studies, as the
result of a ruling passed by the Aca
demic Council last Friday.
According to President Wilbur, this
same rule will apply to men who quit
their studies to go into intensive
training for the army on the campus.
Degrees will be granted to seniors
u I) in their work who leave for gov
ernment service. Practically evtery
large university in the country has
made a similar arrangement. All
rumors that Stanford will close her
doors this week are without founda
tion. The Acadmic Council ruling fol
lows:
"Any student producing satisfac
tory evidence that he is withdraw
ing for service of the government or
other service in connection with the
present crisis, is permitted to with
draw with full credit for the term's
work upon the approval of his sev
eral instructors in the various sub
jects taken upon certification of the
several instructors that his work was
at the time of the withdrawal of pass
ing grade.
"In cases of doubtful scholarship
instructors may at their discretion
hold special examinations for the pur
pose of determining whether students
have passed or not passed. Student
candidates for graduation in May
withdrawing under these circum
stances receiving departmental ap
proval will be recommnded for grad
uation.
