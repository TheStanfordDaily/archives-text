# Fritz Kreisler to Be Heard Tomorrow
## 
### 
Fritz Kreisler, the Austrian master
violinist, will be heard in a recital of
four numbers in Assembly Hall to
morrow at 8:30 p.m.
Kreisler is one of the most fascin
ating figures in the world of music
today. Few artists of any time have
so held the admiring affection of the
public. He represents the highest
type of present day musician, being
a well-balanced, well-rounded man of
the world, of wide intellectual inter
ests and culture.
Kreisler served with the Austrian
army on the front immediately after
the European struggle started. He
has often expressed himself against
war, and it is a pet topic of his that
men of all nations may be some day
brought nearer together by means of
the universal appeal of music. Tick
