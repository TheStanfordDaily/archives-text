### 
Stanford men to the number of 418
enrolled for intensive war training up
to 2 o'clock this afternoon, when the
recruits were divided into squads and
companies and went through the first
military formations.
Men Show Eagerness.
The morning was devoted to regis
tration, and the securing of instruc
tors' /signatures by applicants who
wish to take the drill Instead of con
tinuing college work. The men
showed an eagerness to begin the
training that augurs well for the suc
cess of the intensive instruction.
Alajor Bugge declared himself more
than pleased with the large number
of men out for "the-drill training.
Athletes Can Wait.
All men who will participate in the
crew, track and baseball intercol
legiate competitions can wait until
after these events to go out for the
intensive drill, or can start now, just
as they wish. They must continue
college work until they do take up
the war training. Men who must take
make-up examinations to be recom
mended as in good standing by their
professors can come out after they
have passed these requirements.
For the benefit of men who cannot
take the intensive drill a regular 4 to
6 o'clock drill will be held as pre
viously, Major Bugge announced to
day.
Hard work, 8 to 12 and 1 to 4, five
days of the week, and 8 to 12 Satur
day morning, will be the program of
the intensive military training till the
close of college, May 16, according to
Major Bugge, who urged that no one
go out for selfish motives, or without
the best interests of the country at
heart.
A large crowd of men filled the As
sembly Hall, yesterday afternoon, with
the members of the Corps sitting In
the balcony, to hear President Wil
bur and Major Bugge explain the in
tensive training system.
President Wilbur denied the rumor
that the University was to close.
"We may have to curtail work in some
departments, but there is no thought
of closing," he l £aid. Athletic sched
ules will probably remain intact, he
announced.
Urging the filling out and return of
the preparedness survey blanks at
once, President Wilbur emphasized
the need of college men for other
forms of service to the government as
soldier in the trench," he said. "This
well as in the army.
"It takes eight men to back up each
is a battle of intelligence; the United
States is on its mettle." He pointed !
out the error of England in putting J
all her men at the front at the start j
r»f the war, later having to recall
many on whom much time had been
spent to the industrial service.
"Stanford is rapidly getting on the
military ma'p of the United States,
largely due to the co-operation of the'
officials of the University.'"according
to Major Rugge's statement at the as
sembly yesterday afternoon.
Tomorrow's Program.
> Tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock, ac
tive training starts with a full-day
schedule, from 8 to 12, and from 1 to
