# Guerena to Choose Crews Wednesday
## Pat O'Dea Thinks Finish Will Be Close, With Cardinal Prospects Good 
### 
Coach "Husky" Guerena will an
nounce the men, Wednesday, who are
to uphold the Cardinal against the
Washington and California crews on
the Oakland estuary in the annual
regatta. Following the workout
Wednesday, the eights will leave for
Oakland, where they will practice
Thursday and Friday in preparation
for the race Saturday.
"Pat" O'Dea, former Stanford men
tor, and well known crew
gave the eights the "once over" on
the Redwood estuary yesterday. He
has watched both Washington and
California workout and declares "that
the northern oarsmen and the Card
inal will fight it out for first, with
the Blue and Gold combination a
bang-up third."
According to O'Dea, California has
the best crew she has ever turned
out. The Berkeley eight has a won
derful stroke but lacks the drive of
the Stanford men. Washington, as
usual, is going strong. With several
veterans and one of the best coaches
on the coast the northerners are
strong contenders.
No one of the eights, according to
present dope, will have an easy time.
