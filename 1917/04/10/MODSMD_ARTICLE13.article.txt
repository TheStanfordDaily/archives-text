# Guerena to Choose Crews Wednesday
## Pat O'Dea Thinks Finish Will Be Close, With Cardinal Prospects Good 
### 
Coach "Husky" Guerena will an
nounce the men, Wednesday, who are
to uphold the Cardinal against the
Washington and California crews on
the Oakland estuary in the annual
regatta. Following the workout
Wednesday, the eights will leave for
Oakland, where they will practice
Thursday and Friday in preparation
for the race Saturday.
"Pat" O'Dea, former Stanford men
tor, and well known crew
gave the eights the "once over" on
the Redwood estuary yesterday. He
has watched both Washington and
California workout and declares "that
the northern oarsmen and the Card
inal will fight it out for first, with
the Blue and Gold combination a
bang-up third."
According to O'Dea, California has
the best crew she has ever turned
out. The Berkeley eight has a won
derful stroke but lacks the drive of
the Stanford men. Washington, as
usual, is going strong. With several
veterans and one of the best coaches
on the coast the northerners are
strong contenders.
No one of the eights, according to
present dope, will have an easy time.
In all probability fans may look for
the closest finish of recent years. < Al
though the Cardinal were going
slowly for a while they have devel
oped into a dangerous crew in the
workouts of the last two weeks.
Coach Guerena planned to get time
trials on the shells yesterday but the

water was so rough little information
could be gained. In the trials before
the crew has been hitting up a lively
clip.
According to present dope the eight
will take the water in about the fol
lowing order: The veteran, Lyons,
coxswain; Taylor, bow; Maurer, No.
2; Russell, No. 3; La Forge, No. 4;
McEuen, No. 5; Rogers, No. 6;, Watts,
No. r7, and King, stroke. Several
changes may be made at any time,
however.
The 1920 boat appears to be weak
at present. Although .the, first-year
men are heavy they lack the finish
and drive that makes a good crew.
The experts see little chance for Cali
fornia to turn out an equal of last
year's "babe" eight. As a result the
Cardinal may win over their old riv
als. The Washington freshmen are
showing worlds of form from their
appearance on the Oakland estuary
and seem to be the favorites for the
1920 race.
Keller, one of the best bets for the
varsity, has been forced to stop crew
because of sickness. A combination
of measles and tonsilitis forced him
to spend several days at the hospital.
Keller has been showing good form
all through the season and his loss
will be felt in the big race.
