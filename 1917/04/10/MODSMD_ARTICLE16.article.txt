It is one thing to hold ourselves ready against the hour when we will
be called into service by our country, and quite another to mark time
while doing so. Stanford, in giving her students an opportunity to drop
pursuits which in quieter times mean so much, but at present have dwin
dled in importance, and allowing a substitution of training which will
prove invaluable in this crisis, has Insured herself against a possibility of
marking time. Intensive training, as provided for here, can be used in
almost any branch of set-vice as a fundamental basis. It will not prevent
students choosing that service in which they can be the most useful,
and has n6t-'element of panicky rushing into the first thing that presents
itself.
For those who taking work in the University which will fit
them for special service, this is an excellent opportunity to get something
that will help prepare for the work they can do. While most English and
Pre-Legal majors, for example, are useful only in some branch of the
fighting service, Medif- 1 be used in their particular
