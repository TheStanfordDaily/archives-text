To the Students of Stanford Univer
sity:
Stanford has a splendid opportunity
to render service to her country. Ef
fective action must be instantaneous.
. *
Let us put aside our studies and serve
our country.
Reorganize the University into the
West Point of the West; more than
this, organize a Red Cross College of
nursing, and an aviation corps.
Let Major Bugge plan the work for
the men; let our faculty work with
him. Military drill and tactics,
French and German; the essential en
gineering, and hygiene must
be taught. The officers trained by
Stanford must be the best.
Red Cross courses are being given
an the campusâ€”expand these and draw
on our medical faculty for instruc
tors.
Organize an Aviation School. Our
open campus and equitable climate is
ideal. Turn our shops into an aero
plane factory.
Let our Engineering and Chemistry
departments train munitions men.
Analysts, foremen, and engineers will
be needed. Research can be done by
those best fitted, but remember that
the shots fired by research men may
strike two years hence.
The time for action is today, the
time for your decision is now.
Make, your plans tonight 1 and com
mence work in the morning.
Stanford will do its duty.. Let us
all work together for our University
and our Country.
FREDERICK P. VICKERY.
April, 1917. *
