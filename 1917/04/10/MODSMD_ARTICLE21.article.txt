The game next Saturday on
Berkeley diamond should end in Stan-{
ford's favor. It has definitely beenj
announced that Ball and not Dimock
will twirl against the locals, and the

hitting aggregation. Lilly, Hayes,
Shriver and Mitchell are probably the
strongest batters on the squad.

The lineup that will take the dia
