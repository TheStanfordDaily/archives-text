# Chaparral Behind Warren's Challenge
## Deposed Editor to Fight for His Job, With Hammer and Coffin Backing 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Owing to my absence in the south
during spring vacation, T did not re
ceive notice of my "removal" from
editorship until Monday afternoon, af
ter Dr. Wilbur had signed the action
of the Council. I now take the ear
liest opportunity to announce that I
do not accept the ruling of the Coun
cil, and that, with the backing of
Hammer and Coffin Society, by whose
sole sanction the editor holds and
keeps his office, I propose to continue
to discharge the duties of editor-in
chief of Chaparral until my office ex
pires at the end of this semester.
Upon the advice of President Wil
bur, I ask the Men's Student Council
li
to reconsider the action they have
taken, upon the following grounds:
(1) That I was given no hearing
nor any previous intimation that the
Council intended or even considered
itself empowered to take such action.
Dr. Wilbur expressed himself as under
the impression that a hearing had
been granted.
(2> That the charges made against
me were indenite in character. I
feel that I should be permitted to
hear £hp accusation of the Council in
detail, and that I should be given a
chance to reply to it.
(3) That the ruling of the Council
is unjust. The Council does not ac
cuse me of an ethical violation, but
bases its charge upon a difference of
opinion and a matter of policy, over
which the Council has no jurisdiction.
Up to the time of the present ruling,
i have appeared before the Council
and received apparent acquittal for
all of my acts of which the Council
has disapproved. As to the present
instance, the Council must recognize
the undesirability of bringing to light
the facts, both from their point of
view and that of the University. I
feel that I took every measure in my
po-vyer to undo any. damage it might
have done-r-more than which no edi
tor, regardless of "irresponsibility,"
<yO«14,have. done... And in the light of
fair play I cannot ..accept any such
drastic and autocratic ruling as that
which has been made.
And (4) I do not consider that the
Council is empowered to remove the
editor of the Chaparral. They have
authority over his conduct as over
that of any individual student in the
University, but there is nothing in the
constitution of the Student Body to
justify the Council in changing a stu
dent's standing in the group to which
he belongs. Hammer and Coffin is,
and always has been, an organization
independent of the Student Body, and
the Student Body has never had any
power in the election or control of its
officers. The present unpassed cen
sorship measures are ex post facto,

attempting to justify just such rulings
as the one in my case.
The Chaparral, and I, as its editor,
are anxious to stand for the best in
terests of the University, but it re
serves the right to determine how it
shall perform this duty, and denies
the right of the Men's Student Council
to interfere in regard to expression
of opinion or guidance of policy.

pose of discussing the recent ruling
of the Men's Student Council, requir

from the -office of -editor-in-chief -of

of the society, was as follows:
The society believes that Warren
..was..right in- refusing to abide. by_ the
decision of the Council, because he
was given no hearing, because the
charges against him were indefinite,
and because the society believes that
Warren has acted conscientiously in
the discharge of his duties, and that
whatever indiscretions he may have
committed in the eyes of the Council,
these were not done with intentional
harm to the University and were not
deserving of the extreme action of the
Council.

best interests of the University, and
in this capacity it asks the Men's
Student Council to reconsider the ac
tion it has taken, and declines to re
move Warren from office.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Owing to my absence in the south
during spring vacation, T did not re
ceive notice of my "removal" from
editorship until Monday afternoon, af
ter Dr. Wilbur had signed the action
of the Council. I now take the ear
liest opportunity to announce that I
do not accept the ruling of the Coun
cil, and that, with the backing of
Hammer and Coffin Society, by whose
sole sanction the editor holds and
keeps his office, I propose to continue
to discharge the duties of editor-in
chief of Chaparral until my office ex
pires at the end of this semester.
Upon the advice of President Wil
bur, I ask the Men's Student Council
li
to reconsider the action they have
taken, upon the following grounds:
(1) That I was given no hearing
nor any previous intimation that the
Council intended or even considered
itself empowered to take such action.
Dr. Wilbur expressed himself as under
the impression that a hearing had
been granted.
(2> That the charges made against
me were indenite in character. I
feel that I should be permitted to
hear £hp accusation of the Council in
detail, and that I should be given a
chance to reply to it.
(3) That the ruling of the Council
is unjust. The Council does not ac
cuse me of an ethical violation, but
bases its charge upon a difference of
opinion and a matter of policy, over
which the Council has no jurisdiction.
Up to the time of the present ruling,
i have appeared before the Council
and received apparent acquittal for
all of my acts of which the Council
has disapproved. As to the present
instance, the Council must recognize
the undesirability of bringing to light
the facts, both from their point of
view and that of the University. I
feel that I took every measure in my
po-vyer to undo any. damage it might
have done-r-more than which no edi
tor, regardless of "irresponsibility,"
<yO«14,have. done... And in the light of
fair play I cannot ..accept any such
drastic and autocratic ruling as that
which has been made.
And (4) I do not consider that the
Council is empowered to remove the
editor of the Chaparral. They have
authority over his conduct as over
that of any individual student in the
University, but there is nothing in the
constitution of the Student Body to
justify the Council in changing a stu
dent's standing in the group to which
