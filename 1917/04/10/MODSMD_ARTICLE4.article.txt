# TRACK MEET DATE SHIFTED TO APRIL 14 BY MANAGERS
## War Preparations Compel Stanford and California to Have Crew, Baseball, and Track Competition on the Same Day 
### 
Because of the war preparations on
both the Stanford and the University
of California campuses, the annual
varsity track and field meet scheduled
for April 21, has been shifted to next
Saturday, April 14. This action was
determined upon today by Graduate
Managers Behrens and Stroud, and
was deferred until absolutely neces
sary. A great percentage of the track
men who will wear the Cardinal in
the big meet, have already signed up
for the intensive training. Major
Bugge has agreed to allow them to
drill but half time until alter next
Saturday, but from then on they will
be under the same strict military dis
cipline that the remainder of the men
out for drill are under.
Track Meet at 2 O'clock.
As a result of the shifting of the
meet, next Saturday will bp the big
gest day in intercollegiate athletics
that Stanford and California have
ever attempted to stage. The crew
races will start at about 9:30 in the
morning, the track meet will begin
promptly at 2 o'clock, and the base
ball game will follow at 4 o'clock.
The tennis matches will have been
completed on Friday if the present
plans are carried out.
Graduate Manager Behrena an
nounces that no applications for tick-

I ets will be received after noon to-
I morrow. After this time, the tickets
I will be sold direct, and consequently
without reduction. All students pos
sessing season tickets may secure
two rooters' seats on each ticket for
one dollar each. This offer is open
to women as well as men. The reg
ular admission price will be $1.50.
Those who have made applications for
tickets will naturally be given the
preference for seats. The sale is ex
pected to far surpass any previous
one, not only on account of the big
athletic day, but because of the close
ness of the meet.
Track Coach "Ric" Templeton is
enthusiastic over the prospects of
bringing home a victory. The mov
ing ahead of the meet does not in any
way handicap the Cardinal team, as
the men are already in perfect con
dition. The running of heats is hard
on the Stanford hopes, as the team is
strongest in the events that trials are
required.
Tonight, Graduate Managers Beh
rens and Stroud, and Crew Coaches
Guerena, VVallis, and Connibar, will
meet at the Hotel Carlton in Berk
eley to decide on the officials for the
crew races and to draw for lanes in
the estuary. The course will be
policed by the government, and no
boats will be allowed to follow the
crews.
