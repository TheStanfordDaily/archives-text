# Bags Must Not Pop for "Movie" Kisses
## 
### 
D. Mackusick Smith, '19, will not
have to appear before Police Judge
Edgerton Lakin to tell why lie popped
paper bags in a Palo Alto movie
house when movie stars kissed. The
Student Council interfered, and Mac
kusick was released today.
However, Mackusick will not be able
to pop paper bags in the Marquee
Theater any more when the figures
on the screen participate in lip oscu
lations. Henceforth Mackusick will
have to understand that the orchestra
is the only accompaniment needed
when movie stars get affectionate.
If Mackusick doesn't understand
this, the Council will get him. The
Council got him released from the
strong arm of the law only when it
assured the movie man that it would
give the Stanford sopoliomore a course
in "silence under strains of emotion."
The unofficial statement of the
Council to Mackusick is, "Dave
Smith thou art a free man. Rut for
the love of Mike, key down, when
Marquee film stars osculate."
