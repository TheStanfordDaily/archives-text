# ONLY WAY OUT IS FORWARD SAYS JORDAN
## CRISIS ENDS WORK Chancellor Emeritus Advocates Promotion of European Democracy 
### 
"Our country is at war now â€”and
the only way out is forward."
Those were the first words of Chan
cellor Emeritus David Starr Jordan
to a group of students and faculty
men who met him at the train last
night in Palo Alto, as he alighted af
ter his return from the peace trip
east.
Dr. Jordan went east at the call of
the officers of a league composed of
the combined peace associations of the
country. His lectures were received
witli various sentiments in the east,
and Stanford's great peace man felt
his work ended when war was de
clared. lie left immediately for home.
Dr. Jordan's only statement to the
press is:
Issnes Now Changed.
"By declaration of Congress, ap
proved by the President, out country
is now in actual war. The only way
out is forward, and our duty is to do
all that may be possible for the safe
guarding and strengthening of democ
racy in Europe. I would not change
one word I have spoken against war,
but the issues are now changed. At
home and abroad, the first question
is now the world-wide defense of gov
ernment by the people and for the
people."
Dr. Jordan's plans for the immediate
future are not made. He expects to
stay on the campus, and will probably
spend his time writing. In his own
words. Dr. Jordan "has become quite
a journalist" in recent years, and he
will take advantage of his time finish
ing some of his works.
