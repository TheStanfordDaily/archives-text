Tomorrow at 11 o'clock, President Swigart will call to order an assem
bly of the student body to consider changes in the constitution of the As
sociated Students, most of which are made necessary by the four-quarter
system to be put into effect next fall. It will no doubt require a great
exertion of will power to bring ourselves down to the point of putting
any thought on such a commonplace subject in these stirring times, but
the effort will do us good. Although it may seem of no account what hap
pens to the constitution of the Stanford student body just at present, such
is not the case. We can not sail off on the crest of this military wave
without regard to our moorings. The machinery of government must be
adjusted, and all those who are free to do so, should make it a point to
attend this assembly tomorrow.
Article IV, on publications, was about the only part of the proposed
changes which met with criticism. Some of the criticism was well aimed
and to the point, with the result that this section will be revised, and will
no doubt be more palatable to all concerned. Anything in the way of
censorship of publications is emphatically not desired, but in view of the
fact that the nature of our publications, whether official or otherwise, af
fects the entire University for good or bad, we believe some control to be
a good thing. The Daily Palo Alto has never in our experience felt cen
sored, although it is, in a way, under the supervision of the Executive Com
mittee.
By all means, the managers of publications should be made to work
under the graduate manager and to be directly responsible to him.
Most of the other changes are mere matters of form. Among these,
the provision for three editors of The Daily Palo Alto a year seems to be
the simplest solution of the new problem.

In view of the active part which Stanford is taking in preparing to
meet the national crisis, the decision of the Senior Class to concentrate
its closing festivities, and that of the athletic managers to hurry up the
track meet, are extremely wise. No one wants to wade through a pro
longed social siege in such times as these, while the track meet would
surely suffer by delay.
