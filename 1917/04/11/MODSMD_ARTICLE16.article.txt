# W. A. A. Rules on Awarding of "S"
## Women Will Receive Emblems in All Sports Regardless of Varsity Contests 
### 
The adoption of new rules govern
ing the awarding of "S's" to women
for participation in varsity contests
at a meeting of W. A. A. last evening,
marks a radical change in the athletic
policy of Stanford women. Hence
forth a picked team in every major
•sport will be selected and awarded
the "S" regardless of whether they
have met outside varsity competition
or not. This gives women proficient
in every sport the opportunity to win
an emblem while heretofore only bas
ketball players, fencers and tennis
players had a chance, since these
were the only sports in which the
women were ahle to secure outside
games.
The plan as adopted is as follows:
1. A team in each major sport
(basketball, baseball, tennis, swim
ming, fencing, and crew) shall be
picked from the squad by a commit
tee of three persons: the captain of
the squad, the coach and one mem
ber of the squad, selected by them
through secret ballot.
2. The following considerations
shall govern the selection of any
woman for said teams: (1) Skill in
the sport. (2) Regularity of practice.
(3) Amount of practice. (4) Good
sportsmanship on the fields. (5) Strict
observance of training rules.
3. In case there is little choice be
tween several contestants for a posi
tion on a team, a maximum of three
substiutes may be picked who shall
likewise be entitled to an "S."
By the adoption of this method of
awarding emblems, it is felt that there
will be a fairer distribution of honors
among the womeu most worthy in all
sports.
