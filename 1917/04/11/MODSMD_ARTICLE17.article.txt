Some of the ringside spectators at
the censorship assembly of a week
'ago doubtless had the feeling that the
whole thing was little more than a
tempest in a tea-pot. A little quiet
consideration of the matter in hand
will certainly bring the doubters
around to "another viewpoint."
The new proposal to make the ed
itors and managers of all campus
publications "subject to the approval
of the Executive Committee through
out the year," is dangerous, whatever
be the interpretation of the clause.
The editors and managers are already
responsible to the student judiciary—
the Council. This is well and good.
Hut to place the publications in any
way under the control of the student
executive is to establish at least the
foundation of a censorship. And this
is an abomination.
The whole business is based on a
fundamental fallacy,—that the opin
ion of the Stanford Student Hod.v is
ONE opinion—perhaps that of the
majority—certainly that of the Ex
ecutive Committee. Rut when an is
sue of importance arises, there is
sure to be a party of opposition some
where —witness the football question.
Are we to suppose that the opinion of
the party out of power is not Stan
ford opinion—that it originates some
where outside the Student. Body?
The fact, of the matter is that, all
ideas originate with minorities, and
perhaps spread to the majority,—and,
in time, to the Executive Committee.
For an executive to put any sort, of
check upon minority opinion is to kill
all new ideas before they have had a
chance to prove their worth.
When student opinion becomes all
of one sort, there will be no need of
a committee to keep the writers in
line. Until that time, no committee
can claim the wisdom necessary to
the task.
Every censorship is either a joke or
a menace. Are we to believe that the
Executive Committee has descended
to comedy?
