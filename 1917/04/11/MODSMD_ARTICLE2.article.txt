# Leaders Needed in Present Crisis
## Eberhart Urges International Council to Prevent or Lessen Wars 
### 
"Universities must send out leaders
to take their parts in the problems
which will result from the present
war crisis. I do not believe it is de
sirable, and hope it will not be neces
sary, to send these men abroad. But
two things are certain: we must pre
pare ourselves for emergency, and we
must aid the Allies financially," is
the opinion of A. O. Eberhart, ex-
Governor of Minnesota, who addressed
an audience in the Little Theater yes
terday afternoon on "The War, the
Problems Arising Out of the War, and
America's Relation to Them."
Not, A Pacifist.
"1 do not represent the pacifist
group of thinkers," he asserted. "The
league which I represent recognizes
the practical side of human nature,
admits that nations must be restrain
ed from doing wrong. We plan to put
teeth in Bryan's policy. Our aim is
to enforce peace.
"No one can fail to admit that Wil
son has been patient. He has tried
to avert this war. But it has been
impossible to avoid complications.
Now that we are in, we must fight as
hard as we can. We must strengthen
the President's hand, and bring about
a speedy conclusion of the war. We
will prove that we have not estab
lished this government in vain, and
wo will be fighting for the same
principles which we have fought for
formerly."
The ex-governor of Minnesota be
lieves that the United States can
make herself one of the strongest
leaders in reconstruction, and in the
establishment of a council of the civ
ilized nations whose mission will be
to prevent or at least minimize wars
by submission of the disputed national
difficulties to this council, which will
investigate the trouble carefully, giv
ing the disagreeing nations time to
deliberate before resorting to drastic
measures. The council will guarantee
the integrity of small nations like
Belgium, and will use economic pres
sure first in dealing with aggressive
nations like Germany. This is an
enlargement of Wilson's plan, and
has been endorsed by the Allies, Rus
sia, and many leading statesmen.
"It. seems that the universities of
the country, together with their pro
fessors, should be with us in this
plan," concluded the speaker. "We
wish to reach university students who
are capable of assuming leadership in
this movement; non-partisan men
who desire to mould public opinion
along the right lines, and who are
willing to prepare themselves to as
sume control in the work of recon
struction and the building of machin
ery which will prevent such wars as
this in the future."

"No one can fail to admit that Wil
son has been patient. He has tried
to avert this war. But it has been
impossible to avoid complications.
Now that we are in, we must fight as
hard as we can. We must strengthen
the President's hand, and bring about
a speedy conclusion of the war. We
will prove that we have not estab
lished this government in vain, and
wo will be fighting for the same
principles which we have fought for
formerly."
The ex-governor of Minnesota be
lieves that the United States can
make herself one of the strongest
leaders in reconstruction, and in the
establishment of a council of the civ
ilized nations whose mission will be
to prevent or at least minimize wars
by submission of the disputed national
difficulties to this council, which will
investigate the trouble carefully, giv
ing the disagreeing nations time to
deliberate before resorting to drastic
measures. The council will guarantee
the integrity of small nations like
Belgium, and will use economic pres
sure first in dealing with aggressive
nations like Germany. This is an
enlargement of Wilson's plan, and
has been endorsed by the Allies, Rus
sia, and many leading statesmen.
"It. seems that the universities of
the country, together with their pro
fessors, should be with us in this
plan," concluded the speaker. "We
wish to reach university students who
are capable of assuming leadership in
this movement; non-partisan men
who desire to mould public opinion
along the right lines, and who are
willing to prepare themselves to as
sume control in the work of recon
struction and the building of machin
ery which will prevent such wars as
this in the future."
"Universities must send out leaders
to take their parts in the problems
which will result from the present
war crisis. I do not believe it is de
sirable, and hope it will not be neces
sary, to send these men abroad. But
two things are certain: we must pre
pare ourselves for emergency, and we
must aid the Allies financially," is
the opinion of A. O. Eberhart, ex-
Governor of Minnesota, who addressed
an audience in the Little Theater yes
terday afternoon on "The War, the
Problems Arising Out of the War, and
America's Relation to Them."
Not, A Pacifist.
"1 do not represent the pacifist
group of thinkers," he asserted. "The
league which I represent recognizes
the practical side of human nature,
admits that nations must be restrain
ed from doing wrong. We plan to put
teeth in Bryan's policy. Our aim is
to enforce peace.
