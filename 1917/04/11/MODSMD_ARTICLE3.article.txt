Sixty-three men added their names
to the list of those out for the inten
sive military training in the last
twenty-four hours, bringing the total
up to 481. At least between one and
two hundred additional men are ex
pected to have signed up by Monday,
when track, crew and baseball men '
can take up the drill, and when a |
considerable number of men will have
adjusted scholastic difficulties that j
prevent them getting petitions signed j
up for their hours.
In spite of threatened showers, the
men drilled with a will today, going
through all the preliminary formations
and less complicated movements.
They were divided into three provis
ional battalions, two composed of raw
recruits and one of members of the
R. O. T. C. unit, who are not officer
ing the other battalions, and of men
who have had previous experience.
New men will start rifle drill to
morrow. Lectures on camp sanita
tion and personal hygiene and on the
care and use of the rifle are included j
on tomorrow's intensive program.
