That, the Josh section of the 1918
Quad will be the most humorous of
any yet published is the unanimous
opinion of the few privileged souls
who have peeked over Editor B. C.
Wohlford's shoulder at the advance
proofs. These are being kept under
lock and key by Wohlford, in order
to prevent the dissemination of cam
pus scandals before the book conies
out May 1, so that if necessary the
editor can escape the wrath of ex
posed queeners by sudden flight.
In its Josh section, as in the other
departments of the book, the '18 an
nual will live up to its motto of
"everybody represented."
