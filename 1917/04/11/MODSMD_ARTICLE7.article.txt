Four veterans, four last year's
freshmen and a member of the sec
ond varsity have been named by
Coach "Husky" Guerena for the
Cardinal varsity crew, after a pre
liminary training season marked by
some of the greatest shake-ups seen
in recent years. Coaches of the Uni
versity of Washington and University
of California have also given out the
men who will row in the big regatta
on the Oakland estuary next Satur
day.
Rix iMaiirer, AAI-American stroke,
and one of the best known crew men
in the country, will captain the var
sity at a new position, No. 2. King,
last year's freshmen stroke, will set
the pace for the Cardinal in the place
of Maurer. The other positions as an
nounced are not extreme shifts from
the positions of the last few weeks.
The lineups given out by Coach Ben
Wallis at California include but two
Veterans. The other men are inex
perienced in big races, although five
of them had a seat in the 1919 boat,
which defeated the Stanford first-year
men in the 191G regatta.
Coach Hyrum B. Conibear of the
University of Washington in placing
his men, is counting on the strength
of weight and experience. Several of
the men have rowed in big races and
the northern oarsmen seem to be a
powerful combination.
The races on the Oakland estuary
will begin Saturday morning at 9:30
o'clock, with the varsiites rowing
first. Following this contest, the
freshmen will take the water.
To have his men fully acquainted
with the course, Coach Guerena will
take his crew to Berekeley at noon,
Thursday. They will remain at Berk
eley until the race, and will take reg
ular workouts on the estuary.
Officials for the annual regatta
were chosen last night by graduate
managers and coaches of the three
universities, who met at the Hotel
Carlton -in Berkeley. Dean Witter
was chosen to he starter and referee.
Henry Petersen of San Francisco,
William Donald of the University of
California and Mr. Marx of the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania were named
as judges of the finish.

Four veterans, four last year's
freshmen and a member of the sec
ond varsity have been named by
Coach "Husky" Guerena for the
Cardinal varsity crew, after a pre
liminary training season marked by
some of the greatest shake-ups seen
in recent years. Coaches of the Uni
versity of Washington and University
of California have also given out the
men who will row in the big regatta
on the Oakland estuary next Satur
day.
Rix iMaiirer, AAI-American stroke,
and one of the best known crew men
in the country, will captain the var
sity at a new position, No. 2. King,
last year's freshmen stroke, will set
the pace for the Cardinal in the place
of Maurer. The other positions as an
nounced are not extreme shifts from
the positions of the last few weeks.
The lineups given out by Coach Ben
Wallis at California include but two
Veterans. The other men are inex
perienced in big races, although five
of them had a seat in the 1919 boat,
which defeated the Stanford first-year
men in the 191G regatta.
Coach Hyrum B. Conibear of the
University of Washington in placing
his men, is counting on the strength
of weight and experience. Several of
the men have rowed in big races and
the northern oarsmen seem to be a
powerful combination.
The races on the Oakland estuary
will begin Saturday morning at 9:30
o'clock, with the varsiites rowing
first. Following this contest, the
freshmen will take the water.
To have his men fully acquainted
with the course, Coach Guerena will
take his crew to Berekeley at noon,
Thursday. They will remain at Berk
eley until the race, and will take reg
ular workouts on the estuary.
Officials for the annual regatta
were chosen last night by graduate
managers and coaches of the three
universities, who met at the Hotel
Carlton -in Berkeley. Dean Witter
was chosen to he starter and referee.
Henry Petersen of San Francisco,
William Donald of the University of
California and Mr. Marx of the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania were named
as judges of the finish.

Four veterans, four last year's
freshmen and a member of the sec
ond varsity have been named by
Coach "Husky" Guerena for the
Cardinal varsity crew, after a pre
liminary training season marked by
some of the greatest shake-ups seen
in recent years. Coaches of the Uni
versity of Washington and University
of California have also given out the
men who will row in the big regatta
on the Oakland estuary next Satur
day.
Rix iMaiirer, AAI-American stroke,
and one of the best known crew men
in the country, will captain the var
sity at a new position, No. 2. King,
last year's freshmen stroke, will set
the pace for the Cardinal in the place
of Maurer. The other positions as an
nounced are not extreme shifts from
the positions of the last few weeks.
The lineups given out by Coach Ben
Wallis at California include but two
Veterans. The other men are inex
perienced in big races, although five
of them had a seat in the 1919 boat,
which defeated the Stanford first-year
men in the 191G regatta.
Coach Hyrum B. Conibear of the
University of Washington in placing
his men, is counting on the strength
of weight and experience. Several of
the men have rowed in big races and
the northern oarsmen seem to be a
powerful combination.
The races on the Oakland estuary
will begin Saturday morning at 9:30
o'clock, with the varsiites rowing
first. Following this contest, the
freshmen will take the water.
To have his men fully acquainted
with the course, Coach Guerena will
take his crew to Berekeley at noon,
Thursday. They will remain at Berk
eley until the race, and will take reg
ular workouts on the estuary.
Officials for the annual regatta
were chosen last night by graduate
managers and coaches of the three
universities, who met at the Hotel
Carlton -in Berkeley. Dean Witter
was chosen to he starter and referee.
Henry Petersen of San Francisco,
William Donald of the University of
California and Mr. Marx of the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania were named
as judges of the finish.
