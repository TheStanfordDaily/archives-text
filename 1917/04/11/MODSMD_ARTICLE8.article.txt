# Track Teams Ready for Meet Saturday
## Odds Seem Slightly in Favor of Cardinal Over Rival Blue and Gold Men 
### L. O. Weaver, '19 
With the scheduling of the Stan
ford-California intercollegiate track
meet next Saturday instead of the fol
lowing Saturday, Coaches "Ric" Tem
i pleton and Walter Christie are busy
! putting the finishing touches on the
work of their athletes. Stanford fans
are endeavoring to figure whether the
Cardinal can add another successive
victory to their string of four, while
Californians believe that the Bruins
are going to break the Stanford chain,
i Stanford should win, though the relay
| will be needed to decide the fray.
Dope .Material Scarce.
Preliminary meets, as a rule, are
poor enough material upon which to
dope a meet, and preliminaries this
year are probably less reliable than
ever. The IJ. S. C.-U A. A. C. com
bination is the only team which both
Stanford and California have met,
and little dope material can be ob
tained from this.
I llouse Century Winner.
In the 100 yard dash, House looks
to be a winner. Pernoll has been
appearing to be California's best bet,
but will have to step to beat Lach
mund for second place. -Either
"Clem" Johnson, Floete, Davis or
Levi may surprise and come through.
At the same time, we must not for
get that Wadsworth of California
may appear, and if he does Cardinal
runners will have to watch him. He
has not competed in the preliminary
meets this season, but if we remem
ber rightly, neither did he last year,
and yet was only beaten by inches by
Murray in the century.
The fight in the furlong appears to
be between Lachmund and Pernoll for
first. If House runs in this, he is apt
to score, though it must be remem
bered that "Jud" will be some busy,
as heats are to be run in both sprints
and both hurdles.
Low Hurdles Stanford's.
Five points can be chalked up for
House in the low hurdles, whose time
of :23 4-5 looks good for an easy first.
Carroll Grunsky will probably cap
ture second place, with Halsted,
Williams and Templeton scrapping
for the other points.
High hurdles look to be California's,
as Grunsky is a nifty hurdler, and
his time of : 151-5 should win.
House has navigated the high sticks
in this time, but again these heats
are apt to bother him. Halsted, Will
iams, Templeton, or Kiessig should
take the third place.
Cailfornians are jubilant in the 440
and are proclaiming a victory for the
speedy Moody. However, their hopes
are probably due to be shattered, be
cause F. Rogers should win this
event. Dievendorff will give Moody
a scrap for second place. B. Rogers,
Hertel, Kegley, Pitts, or Kerr are
not slow, and will force the winners
to step a fast race.
Schnell and Blanchard promise to |
offer a race in the half-mile, and
Cardinal fans can expect Schnell to
score a victory. Captain Aupperle.
may enter this run and in that case
the fight for first will be thrilling.
Scott will make a strong bid for a
place.
The mile looks all Stanford, with
Chapman and Aupperle contesting for
first. A. Wilson, Flood, or Frye, if his
leg is in shape, ought to capture the
third place. Sullivan is California's
best bet, but the Cardinal should suc
ceed in overcoming him. The two
mile also looks to be a Stanford win
with Chapman crossing the line
ahead. Loucks, McPherson, A. Wil
son and Lloyd will fight it out for the
other places, with the odds favoring
Lloyd for second.
Field events appear to be in Cali
fornia's favor, as usual, though Stan
ford should capture sufficient points
in this department, added to their
track points, to win the meet by a
point or two.
The shot put is anybody's event,
with Liversidge, Bihlman and Caugliey
tossing the weight. Bihlman should
win, with the chances favoring Liver
sedge for second, though Caughey is
a great come-through man in an in
tercollegiate meet.
The hammer is the Blue and Gold's
event, as Gildersleeve, Richardson,
and Monlux appear to have the odds
on Miller, Gillespie, Murray, Caughey
and Bihlman.
Captain Lute Nichols probably will
take the pole vault. Wilcox, Greve,
and Hutchinson ought to be the con
tenders for second and third.
Nichols is also the favorite in the
high jump and his teammate, Jack
son, is a jumper of known repute.
Templeton, Dykes and Wheatly are
going to make the Bruins extend
themselves, and Templeton may jump
into second place.
The broad jump is a rather un
known event. Nichols, Jackson and
Schlapp are all good for about twen
ty-three feet. Lachmund, Templeton,
and House will jump for Stanford,
and may come through.
My the time of the relay, the five
points will probably be necessary to
decide the winner, in which case
Stanford should win.

"Clem" Johnson, Floete, Davis or
Levi may surprise and come through.
At the same time, we must not for
get that Wadsworth of California
may appear, and if he does Cardinal
runners will have to watch him. He
has not competed in the preliminary
meets this season, but if we remem
ber rightly, neither did he last year,
and yet was only beaten by inches by
Murray in the century.
The fight in the furlong appears to
be between Lachmund and Pernoll for
first. If House runs in this, he is apt
to score, though it must be remem
bered that "Jud" will be some busy,
as heats are to be run in both sprints
and both hurdles.
Low Hurdles Stanford's.
Five points can be chalked up for
House in the low hurdles, whose time
of :23 4-5 looks good for an easy first.
Carroll Grunsky will probably cap
ture second place, with Halsted,
Williams and Templeton scrapping
for the other points.
High hurdles look to be California's,
as Grunsky is a nifty hurdler, and
his time of : 151-5 should win.
House has navigated the high sticks
in this time, but again these heats
are apt to bother him. Halsted, Will
iams, Templeton, or Kiessig should
take the third place.
Cailfornians are jubilant in the 440
and are proclaiming a victory for the
speedy Moody. However, their hopes
are probably due to be shattered, be
cause F. Rogers should win this
event. Dievendorff will give Moody
a scrap for second place. B. Rogers,
Hertel, Kegley, Pitts, or Kerr are
not slow, and will force the winners
to step a fast race.
Schnell and Blanchard promise to |
offer a race in the half-mile, and
Cardinal fans can expect Schnell to
score a victory. Captain Aupperle.
may enter this run and in that case
the fight for first will be thrilling.
Scott will make a strong bid for a
place.
The mile looks all Stanford, with
Chapman and Aupperle contesting for
first. A. Wilson, Flood, or Frye, if his
leg is in shape, ought to capture the
third place. Sullivan is California's
best bet, but the Cardinal should suc
ceed in overcoming him. The two
mile also looks to be a Stanford win
with Chapman crossing the line
ahead. Loucks, McPherson, A. Wil
son and Lloyd will fight it out for the
other places, with the odds favoring
Lloyd for second.
Field events appear to be in Cali
fornia's favor, as usual, though Stan
ford should capture sufficient points
in this department, added to their
track points, to win the meet by a
point or two.
The shot put is anybody's event,
with Liversidge, Bihlman and Caugliey
tossing the weight. Bihlman should
win, with the chances favoring Liver
sedge for second, though Caughey is
a great come-through man in an in
tercollegiate meet.
The hammer is the Blue and Gold's
event, as Gildersleeve, Richardson,
and Monlux appear to have the odds
on Miller, Gillespie, Murray, Caughey
and Bihlman.
Captain Lute Nichols probably will
take the pole vault. Wilcox, Greve,
and Hutchinson ought to be the con
tenders for second and third.
Nichols is also the favorite in the
high jump and his teammate, Jack
son, is a jumper of known repute.
Templeton, Dykes and Wheatly are
going to make the Bruins extend
themselves, and Templeton may jump
into second place.
The broad jump is a rather un
known event. Nichols, Jackson and
Schlapp are all good for about twen
ty-three feet. Lachmund, Templeton,
and House will jump for Stanford,
and may come through.
My the time of the relay, the five
points will probably be necessary to
decide the winner, in which case
Stanford should win.
With the scheduling of the Stan
ford-California intercollegiate track
meet next Saturday instead of the fol
lowing Saturday, Coaches "Ric" Tem
i pleton and Walter Christie are busy
! putting the finishing touches on the
work of their athletes. Stanford fans
are endeavoring to figure whether the
Cardinal can add another successive
victory to their string of four, while
Californians believe that the Bruins
are going to break the Stanford chain,
i Stanford should win, though the relay
| will be needed to decide the fray.
Dope .Material Scarce.
Preliminary meets, as a rule, are
poor enough material upon which to
dope a meet, and preliminaries this
year are probably less reliable than
ever. The IJ. S. C.-U A. A. C. com
bination is the only team which both
Stanford and California have met,
and little dope material can be ob

are apt to bother him. Halsted, Will
iams, Templeton, or Kiessig should
take the third place.
Cailfornians are jubilant in the 440
and are proclaiming a victory for the
speedy Moody. However, their hopes
are probably due to be shattered, be
cause F. Rogers should win this
event. Dievendorff will give Moody
a scrap for second place. B. Rogers,
Hertel, Kegley, Pitts, or Kerr are
not slow, and will force the winners
to step a fast race.
Schnell and Blanchard promise to |
offer a race in the half-mile, and
Cardinal fans can expect Schnell to
score a victory. Captain Aupperle.
may enter this run and in that case
the fight for first will be thrilling.
Scott will make a strong bid for a
place.
The mile looks all Stanford, with
Chapman and Aupperle contesting for
first. A. Wilson, Flood, or Frye, if his
leg is in shape, ought to capture the
third place. Sullivan is California's
best bet, but the Cardinal should suc
ceed in overcoming him. The two
mile also looks to be a Stanford win
with Chapman crossing the line
ahead. Loucks, McPherson, A. Wil
son and Lloyd will fight it out for the
other places, with the odds favoring
Lloyd for second.
Field events appear to be in Cali
fornia's favor, as usual, though Stan
ford should capture sufficient points
in this department, added to their
track points, to win the meet by a
point or two.
The shot put is anybody's event,
with Liversidge, Bihlman and Caugliey
tossing the weight. Bihlman should
win, with the chances favoring Liver
sedge for second, though Caughey is
a great come-through man in an in
tercollegiate meet.
The hammer is the Blue and Gold's
event, as Gildersleeve, Richardson,
and Monlux appear to have the odds
on Miller, Gillespie, Murray, Caughey
and Bihlman.
Captain Lute Nichols probably will
take the pole vault. Wilcox, Greve,
and Hutchinson ought to be the con
tenders for second and third.
Nichols is also the favorite in the
high jump and his teammate, Jack
son, is a jumper of known repute.
Templeton, Dykes and Wheatly are
going to make the Bruins extend
themselves, and Templeton may jump
into second place.
The broad jump is a rather un
known event. Nichols, Jackson and
Schlapp are all good for about twen
ty-three feet. Lachmund, Templeton,
and House will jump for Stanford,
and may come through.
My the time of the relay, the five
points will probably be necessary to
decide the winner, in which case
Stanford should win.
With the scheduling of the Stan
ford-California intercollegiate track
meet next Saturday instead of the fol
lowing Saturday, Coaches "Ric" Tem
i pleton and Walter Christie are busy
! putting the finishing touches on the
work of their athletes. Stanford fans
are endeavoring to figure whether the
Cardinal can add another successive
victory to their string of four, while
Californians believe that the Bruins
are going to break the Stanford chain,
i Stanford should win, though the relay
| will be needed to decide the fray.
Dope .Material Scarce.
Preliminary meets, as a rule, are
poor enough material upon which to
dope a meet, and preliminaries this
year are probably less reliable than
ever. The IJ. S. C.-U A. A. C. com
bination is the only team which both
Stanford and California have met,
and little dope material can be ob
tained from this.
I llouse Century Winner.
In the 100 yard dash, House looks
to be a winner. Pernoll has been
appearing to be California's best bet,
but will have to step to beat Lach
mund for second place. -Either
"Clem" Johnson, Floete, Davis or
Levi may surprise and come through.
At the same time, we must not for
get that Wadsworth of California
may appear, and if he does Cardinal
runners will have to watch him. He
has not competed in the preliminary
meets this season, but if we remem
ber rightly, neither did he last year,
and yet was only beaten by inches by
Murray in the century.
The fight in the furlong appears to
be between Lachmund and Pernoll for
first. If House runs in this, he is apt
to score, though it must be remem
bered that "Jud" will be some busy,
as heats are to be run in both sprints
and both hurdles.
Low Hurdles Stanford's.
Five points can be chalked up for
House in the low hurdles, whose time
of :23 4-5 looks good for an easy first.
Carroll Grunsky will probably cap
ture second place, with Halsted,
Williams and Templeton scrapping
for the other points.
High hurdles look to be California's,
as Grunsky is a nifty hurdler, and
his time of : 151-5 should win.
