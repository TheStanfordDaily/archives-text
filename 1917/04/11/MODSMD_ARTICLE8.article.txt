# Track Teams Ready for Meet Saturday
## Odds Seem Slightly in Favor of Cardinal Over Rival Blue and Gold Men 
### L. O. Weaver, '19 
With the scheduling of the Stan
ford-California intercollegiate track
meet next Saturday instead of the fol
lowing Saturday, Coaches "Ric" Tem
i pleton and Walter Christie are busy
! putting the finishing touches on the
work of their athletes. Stanford fans
are endeavoring to figure whether the
Cardinal can add another successive
victory to their string of four, while
Californians believe that the Bruins
are going to break the Stanford chain,
i Stanford should win, though the relay
| will be needed to decide the fray.
Dope .Material Scarce.
Preliminary meets, as a rule, are
poor enough material upon which to
dope a meet, and preliminaries this
year are probably less reliable than
ever. The IJ. S. C.-U A. A. C. com
bination is the only team which both
Stanford and California have met,
and little dope material can be ob
tained from this.
I llouse Century Winner.
In the 100 yard dash, House looks
to be a winner. Pernoll has been
appearing to be California's best bet,
but will have to step to beat Lach
mund for second place. -Either
"Clem" Johnson, Floete, Davis or
Levi may surprise and come through.
At the same time, we must not for
get that Wadsworth of California
may appear, and if he does Cardinal
runners will have to watch him. He
has not competed in the preliminary
meets this season, but if we remem
ber rightly, neither did he last year,
