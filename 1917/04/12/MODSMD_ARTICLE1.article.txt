# NO INTENSIVE TRAINING FOR LOCAL WOMEN
## DEVELOP INTELLECTS Doctor Wilbur Gives Advice at Assembly of Stanford Women Yesterday 
### 
It is probable that no intensive
training for women will go into ef
fect this semester. "Now is the time
for the women to use their intellects
and not their emotions," was the ad
vice of Dr. Wilbur in addressing the
women at the assembly held yester
day afternoon. He expressed his ap
preciation in the poise and the attitude
that the women had so far shown in
the present crisis.
Present Training: Not Necessary.
Government officials do not feel
that it is necessary at this time to
begin the immediate training of the
women. The food supply was the
most important item which now had to
be faced and every woman should
think seriously on this subject, Dr.
Wilbur advised.
Finish Work, Advice.
Miss Bradford, in her talk, empha
sized the fact that it was more neces
sary for the women to finish the
work in hand and in that way make
themselves more fit to pursue other
courses later. It would be unwise to
consider not finishing the semester's!
work, as the naval and army officials
feel that work in training camps for
women will not be started until June.
If there is a sufficient demand for
courses arrangements will probably
be made, but they will have to be
taken in addition to the regular work.
Miss Edith Harvey, '17, as chairman
of the Vocational committee, asked
that all women plan for some work
in which they would be fitted to take
a useful place in society. Although
the surveys which were sent out by
Dr. Wilbur were Inadequate for the
women, it is asked that they be sent
to J. E. McDowell, assistant registrar,
las soon as possible. In addition to
this, another survey is to be filled out
by the women which will contain
some of the following: Farming,
cooking, sewing stenographic work,
buying, selling, teaching and nursing.
Several of the women spoke on the
different aspects of the work which
the "500" might do. Miss Margaret
Evans, '17, representing the Red
Cross, said that there were very few
women who would be fitted to go to
the front if they were called on even
though they had taken up Red Cross
work. It was a time to specialize and
devote their time to filling a place in
society which would be just as use
ful. They should not be carried away
by the glamour of the white cap and
*
the red cross on the sleeve.
"To call a man a coward when he
has not signed up for intensive train
ing was a thing that was hardly
worthy of college women" were the
words of Miss Ruth Bacon, '17. She
felt keenly that the attitude that the
women held toward those who had
not signed up should be the same as
for those that had, for they would do
equally as much for their country by
carrying on the work which they had
chosen.
As a graduate nurse from Lane
Hospital, Miss Mary Post, '17, told of
the life of the nurses aide at the front,
the position given to one who has a
Red Cross certificate. It is a menial
position, and unless that is the only
work one feels that she could do, it is
far better to plan for other work.
