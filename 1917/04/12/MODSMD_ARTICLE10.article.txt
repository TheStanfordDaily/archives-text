# Varsity Infielders Workout at Berkeley
## 
### 
Eight Stanford infielders journeyed
to the University of California dia
mond today to work out on the Berk
eley field. Coach Wilson accompanied I
the men. The pitchers and outfielders
j will practice at home today with some I
iof the second string players. Hoever, i
Mattel, and Draper are all heaving in :
the best form they have shown this
year.
If the Hlne and Gold team takes the
; diamond in the crippled shape that
| advance notices have prophesied,
; Stanford should have no trouble in '
twinning the fourth game and evening!
jup the series. Even though Dimock
and not Ball or McCabe is sent in to
hurl, the absence of Captain Sammy
Adair, Claude Rohwer and Hudson
from the lineup will seriously handi
cap the Bruins.
Captain Hayes will undoubtedly
start Iloever in the box for Stanford.
The rest of the team is certain, with
the exception of two outfield berths.
