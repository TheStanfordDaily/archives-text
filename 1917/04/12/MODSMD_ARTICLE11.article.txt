# Crew Men Practice on Oakland Estuary
## Leave Campus Today for Final Workouts Before Big Race Slated for Saturday 
### 
Stanford's varsity and freshmen
eights left the campus at noon to
day for Berkeley, where they will
work out until.the big triangular re
gatta. Saturday. Coach "Husky"
Guerena is taking his men up early in
order that they may be fully acquaint
ed with the Oakland estuary condi
tions.
Finishing touches are being put on
the eights by the Washington and
California mentors. With the an
nouncement. of race officials, crews,
and rules all is in readiness lor the
start.
First Ifnct* 9:40.
The varsity three-mile race has been
scheduled to start from the Webster
street bridge sharply at 9:40, Satur
day morning. The Washington crew
will row on the Oakland side of the
estuary, Stanford will be in the mid
dle, while the Blue and Cold oarsmen
will row on the Alameda side.
The second race will start promptly
at 10:15, over the two-mile stretch.
The Cardinal boat will take the Oak
land side, with California in the mid
dle, and the northern crew on the Ala
meda side. The injunction against
boats following the varsity crews will
be strictly enforced, so that the sec-
ond race will not be interfered with.
The train which will follow the race
along the estuary will leave 14th and
Webster streets at 9:05. Tickets will
be sold at seventy-five cents.
Varsities Fqu.il In Weight.
The announcement of the lineups
gives a chance for speculation on the
Cardinal chances. The three varsity
eights are practically equal in weight.
Washington has the edge on Stanford
by one-fourth of a pound to the man,
while California's average is one
pound less than that of Stanford.
Washington lias Fiige.
According to the dope, the Cardinal
and the northern crew will fight it
out for first, with California close he
hind. If an edge were allotted to any
combination it would go to Washing
ton.
In experience the three shells stand
about the same. Stanford has three
old men, with Washington and Cali
fornia two each. All eights for this
reason are largely unknown quanti
ties.
Freshmen Are Fqual.
There seems to be little difference
between tho freshmen crews. Cali
fornia has the advantage of four
pounds over Stanford and five over
Washington in weight. Otherwise the
"babes" are equal. The northern
first-year men are a little smoother
and would hold the advantage if any
were given.
