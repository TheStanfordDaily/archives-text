# Civil Engineers to Form Training Corps

### 
Civil engineers who are out for an
tensive training withdrew from the
lines this afternoon in order to form
a Civil Engineering Corps, which
will start training Monday. About a
hundred men will make lip the corps,
which will be under the direction of
Professor C. H. Wing. The engineers
will devote one-half of their time to
regular military drill, and the re
mainder of the time will be spent in
training for army surveying. The
corps has applied for permission to
use a plot of 40ft acres beyond French
man's Lake, for their work. A mili
tary camp for the Stanford division
is to he plotted out. and the work of
planning the site, the arrangement,
the facilities for light and water sup
ply, and the sanitary conditions, as
well as making estimates of the var
ious needs and expenses involved,
will be undertaken.
