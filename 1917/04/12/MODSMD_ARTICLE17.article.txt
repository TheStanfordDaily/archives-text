# THE 						REAL ISSUE
## 
### 
A large part of this morning's assembly was occupied by speeches
which served very well to cloud the issues at stake and lead the unsuspect
ing public to imagine that it was attending some sort of a rally instead
of a meeting to sanely discuss the proposed changes in the Associated
Student Body constitution. Half of those present probably didn't care
what happened, and at some ringing denouncement woke up only long
enough to applaud vociferously during the pauses allowed for such dem
onstration. We suspect one or two speakers of taking advantage of the
opportunity to practice a little extemporaneous debating.
The objection to placing the finances of a losing publication in the
hands of the Executive Committee until it is put back on its feet, was made
on the ground that it would mean a control of editorial policy. We believe
this would not be the case. The only effect it would have on the edi
torial side of the publication is a limitation as to size, grade of paper,
number of cuts, and such matters. As long as any space remained unoccu
pied with advertisements, the editor would be at liberty to say whatever
he pleased, and would be answerable only to the Student Council, as at
present. A paper entirely composed of ads would, of course, be no paper
at all. It would be to the best interests of all concerned to be reasonable
in the matter of such curtailment.
This is the only way financial control would affect the editor, and it
is to be hoped that it is no more than the manager would do without
outside control. It is natural, of course, that the editor should ask for
as much money as possible to improve his columns, but it is only reason
able to call a halt when the credit of the publication, and with it that of
the University, is impaired. If managers will not do this of their own free
will, some steps must be taken to protect the good name of Stanford.
This is the real issue. We believe the proposed change will do the work.

We hope Major Bugge was right when he said he was speaking to a
very small minority this morning concerning the attitude which had been
expressed in regard to military drill. Judging from experience thus far,
we would say most emphatically that to take intensive training is not an
easy way of getting credit for the semester's work. Even if it were, how
ever, it is unworthy to go into the business from any such motive. Also
taking advantage of the unusual situation to stir up trouble in neighboring
communities can not be countenanced.

easy way of getting credit for the semester's work. Even if it were, how
ever, it is unworthy to go into the business from any such motive. Also
taking advantage of the unusual situation to stir up trouble in neighboring
communities can not be countenanced.
A large part of this morning's assembly was occupied by speeches
which served very well to cloud the issues at stake and lead the unsuspect
ing public to imagine that it was attending some sort of a rally instead
of a meeting to sanely discuss the proposed changes in the Associated
Student Body constitution. Half of those present probably didn't care
what happened, and at some ringing denouncement woke up only long
enough to applaud vociferously during the pauses allowed for such dem
onstration. We suspect one or two speakers of taking advantage of the
opportunity to practice a little extemporaneous debating.
The objection to placing the finances of a losing publication in the
hands of the Executive Committee until it is put back on its feet, was made
on the ground that it would mean a control of editorial policy. We believe
this would not be the case. The only effect it would have on the edi
torial side of the publication is a limitation as to size, grade of paper,
number of cuts, and such matters. As long as any space remained unoccu
pied with advertisements, the editor would be at liberty to say whatever
he pleased, and would be answerable only to the Student Council, as at
present. A paper entirely composed of ads would, of course, be no paper
at all. It would be to the best interests of all concerned to be reasonable
in the matter of such curtailment.
This is the only way financial control would affect the editor, and it
is to be hoped that it is no more than the manager would do without
outside control. It is natural, of course, that the editor should ask for
as much money as possible to improve his columns, but it is only reason
able to call a halt when the credit of the publication, and with it that of
the University, is impaired. If managers will not do this of their own free
will, some steps must be taken to protect the good name of Stanford.
This is the real issue. We believe the proposed change will do the work.

We hope Major Bugge was right when he said he was speaking to a
very small minority this morning concerning the attitude which had been
expressed in regard to military drill. Judging from experience thus far,
we would say most emphatically that to take intensive training is not an
easy way of getting credit for the semester's work. Even if it were, how
ever, it is unworthy to go into the business from any such motive. Also
taking advantage of the unusual situation to stir up trouble in neighboring
communities can not be countenanced.
