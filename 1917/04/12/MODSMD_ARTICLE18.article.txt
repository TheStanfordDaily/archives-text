Editor Daily Palo Alto:
This morning, during the assembly,
I attributed a statement to "a faculty
member of the Student Council,"
which of course could mean no one
other than Mr. Staniford. I had meant
to say "a member of the Student Af
fairs Committee," and am extremely
sorry for the way in which I con
fused titles. In my own mind I had
no reference to Mr. Staniford, as none
was merited, and wish to take this op
portunity to make the apology and
correction just as publicly as the orig
inal statement.
