Mon dieu! At last those Vapid
Virgins down at Stanford have been
conquered. Nice Girls having War
Assembles! Tut, tut! What man is
going to marry them after they have
so cheapened themselves? Anyway, I
am glad it all turned out so well.
Just think, several hundred of the
BEST DRESSED GIRLS on the cam
pus went —so it is said. And full of
ridiculous notions about helping their
country. Just because the men have
to be drilled in order to be shot cor- j
rectly is no reason we need training
in order to run banks and things.
Why do young girls want to coarsen
themselves so? But they were disil
lusioned, Dearie. Some poor girl that
has had experience in nursing told
them there wasn't a thing romantic
about it and that it was actually hard
work.
Not that the University isn't trying
to stimulate their ambitions but along
the right lines, ALONG THE RIGHT
LINES, Dearie! The Ywcas—those
sweet spiritual young girls, you
know, Dearie—only dear me, I—But
as I was saying, they have prepared
a splendid list of things to do: mil
linery, domestic work, designing for
military balls, and all those things we
are going to have to do when we take
the men's places. And only think of
it, all these girls can hand in their
names, if they want to, and have them
gone over and ARRANGED ALPHA
BETICALLY! I guess you get the
idea, Dearie, even if you are so fem
ininely unpractical.
Of course the meeting didn't last
very long, because the Yap and Yawn
Society was having a TEA and just
think, Dearie, every one of those girls
was invited.
And do you know, Dearie, that I
have another recipe for the duckiest
TRENCH TART!
