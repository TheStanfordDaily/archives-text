# Stanford Mat Men Meet to Contest Class Titles
## 
### 
Unsettled conditions on the campus
have dampened the outlook for a big
entry list in the annual interclass
wrestling tournament tomorrow after
noon at 4:30 p.m., on the Encina
gymnasium mats. In spite of the mili
tary agitation, however, several con
testants have announced their inten
tion of appearing to defend or try for
titles. The tournament will be open
to all, according to Coach D. C. Wise,
'18, and it is not too late to sign up.
