# Naval Reserve Open to University Men
## 
### 
University students enrolled in the
Engineering department can apply
for commissions in the Naval Reserve
Corps, according to pamphlets re
ceived by Professor W. R. Eckart of
the Mechanical Engineering depart
ment. However there is only one
branch of the naval reserve that is
open to college students without pre
ious experience in the navy. This is
listed as Class 4, of the Naval Coast
Defense Reserve. To receive a com
mission in this branch of the service,
it is necessary, for general service
afloat, to have a master's or engineer's
license: however, for general service,
without previous experience, a com
i mission will be given if the college
' student or other applicant shows him
self especially qualified. No higher
commissions will be given to these ap
plicants than the rank of ensign.
Stanford men who contemplate en
rolling in the Naval Coast Defense
Reserve are advised to communicate
with Lieutenant-Commander C. F.
j Crocker, in the H. S. Crocker build-
I ing, San Francisco. Men interested in
the other branches of the naval re
serve can communicate with Lieuten
ant F. W. Milner in the Sheldon build
ing. Professor Eckart has charge of
the information pertaining to the re
serve and will receive the names of
those who intend entering this branch
of the service.
Continue Class Work, Advice.
In the meantime, those who enlist
in the naval reserve and are subject
to call at any time, are urged to con
tinue their work in the class room,
or at least to continue their engineer
ing work along with the intensive
training. No provision has been
made as yet for the granting of credit
to those who leave college, after en
listing and without being called by
the government.
Probably some time early next week
an officer of the Naval Reserve Corps
will address the students contem
plating enlisting in the naval reserve.
