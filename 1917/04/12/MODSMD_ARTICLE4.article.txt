# Audience Won by Entertainment of Fritz Kreisler
## 
### 
It takes more magic than is the lot
of the small man to make a scatter
ingly-fllled house forget Itself, and
that is what Fritz Kreisler did last
evening, when he made his hearers
forget the glaring rows of empty seats
and demand more with the enthusiasm
usually only found in a large crowd.
Calling whole orchestras of sound
out of his instrument, Kreisler gave
the two exacting Bach numbers in a
I fashion which roused even the Vic
j trola-educated group of his audience
| who were waiting for the more fam
jiliar groups of numbers at the end of
j the program. It was in the seldom
! played Vieuxtemps concerto that Mr.
; Lamson had the opportunity to show
| that the audience need not regret the
absence of orchestra background with
him at the piano.
For those who missed some of their
favorite selection on the program, the
violinist proved himself generous in
the matter of encores. He repeated
two numbers and among the extra
ones played a Beethoven Rondino, a
Spanish Serenade, and finally his own
always-loved Caprice Viennois.
Besides her revolution, we have an
other reason to look kindly on Russia.
Her soldiers did not kill Fritz Kreis
ler. Another man might try to play
his Liebesfreud or draw the woodland
magic from the haunting Indian
Lament, but there is only one Kreis
ler. And as long as we have him we
are unwilling to believe that any other
could cast the spell that can follow
the arching of that strong white wrist
