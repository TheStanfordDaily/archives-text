## FORENSIC HEADLINER McClintock, Driscoll, Holland and Williams to Uphold the Cardinal 
### 
Having an a general subject the
question of "Reconstruction of France
After the War," California and Stan
ford forensic battlers will take part
in the twenty-third annual Carnot
Debate tomorrow evening at 8 o'clock
in the Stanford Assembly HalL
M. L. McClintock,' '18, J.
col 1, Jr., 'IS, and J. C. Holland, '17,
with E. E. Williams, '17, alternate,
have been selected as the three Stan
ford representatives after a hard ser
ies of trvouts and eliminations.
These men form one of the strongest
teams ever turned out at Stanford
and are expected to deliver excep
tional addresses.
All the men chosen have been ac
tively engaged in debating lines at
Stanford, both McClintock and Dris
coll having taken part in Tri-State
debates, Holland having won honors
in dissertation contests, and Williams
having been a member of last year's
Carnot team.
Individualism shines at its brightest
in the Carnot, as each man must
choose for himself which side of the
question he desires, after having
heard the specific topic, which is an
nounced only two hours previous to
the debate itself. One limitation
placed upon choice of sides is that
one man from each team must be on
the opposite side from his fellow
teammates.
To the man who delivers the best
address from all points of view will
be given a Carnot medal.
There will be no charge to persons
desiring to attend the affair.
