Stanford and California mix it tomorrow in the greatest carnival of
athletics ever staged between the rival universities. The Cardinal and
Blue and Gold will fly in competition almost continuously throughout the
day, and with Washington entered in the crew races, sport lovers will be
given a treat unequalled in the annals of Pacific Coast athletics.
Supremacy in track and crew will be decided, with a possibility—
which we hope is slight—that the baseball championship will go to Cali
fornia. Stanford has good chances in all. We hope for and expect our
share of victories. Here's for a Stanford day!

Beginning Monday, The Daily Palo Alto will be issued in the morning,
in order to meet the changed conditions due to intensive training classes.
