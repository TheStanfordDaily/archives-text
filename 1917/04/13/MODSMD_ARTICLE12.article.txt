Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I have sent notice to the Student
Council that I must again decline to
accept their ruling. The charges of
the Council were made in the same
indefinite terms as those in the notice
above. When asked to give proof of
actual harm done to the University
by me, the Council refused to go into
the matter.
This matter is one in which the
Council has exceeded its constitu
tional powers, and I appeal its decis
ion to a vote of the student body. And
I hereby present the following meas
ure to the students for the vote next
Wednesday:
"The Men's Student Council shall

have no power to remove the editors
of student publications from office
without the approval of the student
body, and the expression of opinion
in campus publications shall be un
restricted."
If this measure is placed before the
students and defeated, I shall be more
than willing to comply with the ac
tion of the Council, and withdraw
from the editorship of Chaparral.
(Signed) LANSTNG WARREN,
Editor Chaparral.
