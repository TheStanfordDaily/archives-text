On March 27, the Men's Student
Council recommended to the proper
University authorities that Mr. Lan
sing Warren be required to withdraw
from the editorship of the "Chap
arral." The basis for that action was
a series of editorial errors dating
from the early part of last semester,
which tended to serious damage to
the University and the student body.
The recommendation of the Council
has been approved by the proper Uni
versity authorities, who are namely
the Student Affairs Committee and
the President. Following a review of
the case this evening upon the re
quest of Mr. Warren, the Council sus
tained its original decision.
Prior to March 27, when it was
recommended that he be removed from
office on account of incompetent judg
ment, Mr. Warren had appeared twice
before the Council. In each instance
he declared his regret that certain ob
jectionable statements had appeared
in the "Chaparral."
Mr. Warren was instructed fully
and at length by the Council that
he must use greater care in the super
vision of material published in the
"Chaparral," and that he must exer
cise better judgment in selecting ma
terial to be published.
After he had received definite warn
ing from the Council, both verbal and
written, Mr. Warren was considered
to be virtually on probation. It was
impressed upon him that lie had been
remiss in descharging his obligations
to the community. He was informed
that better judgment and perspective
were expected from him.
However, his work continued to
show irresponsibility, and to jeopard
ize the welfare of the University.
Consequently it became necessary
that disciplinary action should be
taken. The action of the Council has
already been noted.
