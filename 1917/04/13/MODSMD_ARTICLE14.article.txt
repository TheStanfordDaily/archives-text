# Men Are Eager for Ambulance Service
## 
### 
Preliminary work in raising a sec
! ond unit of ambulance drivers in
| France from Stanford was begun to
| day at a meeting at the Sigma Chi
1 house. Enough men have already an
nounced their intention of going to
: make up a second corps.
Conditions under which the Stan
! ford men will go will be practically
i the same as those arranged for the
i first unit. Each man will contribute
something to his own expenses, and
! the balance of the money will be
| raised under the auspices of the
i Friends of France. Men to go in the
I second corps will be chosen from the
group which signed up today, and
those who sign up later on. Appica
tions for membership in the corps
should be made at once to C. J. Ran
dau or F. J. Taylor at the Sigma Chi
house, or to A. C. Kimber in Palo
Alto.
Among the men who desire to enter
the French ambulance service in the
second unit are J. F. Elden, B. C.
