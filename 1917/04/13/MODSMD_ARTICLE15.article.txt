# Petitioners Would Amend Constitution
## 
### 
Believing that student government
needs strengthening by means of
more direct participation in it by the
students generally, the initiative, ref
erendum and recall have been pro
posed as amendments to the constitu
tion of the student body, and a re
quest made that they be voted upon at
next Wednesday's election.
The initiative measure presented in
the petition makes any proposed leg
islation which is accompanied by the
signatures of fifty students subject to
a ballot vote of the student body with
in fourteen days. The referendum has
the same qualifications as to signa
tures, and calls in such case, for a
vote upon any legislation passed by
the Council, Conference or Executive
Committee." The recall provides for
a recall vote of any officer of student
government upon the presentation of
a petition signed by fifty students.
The petition proposing these meas
ures was signed by R. A. Donaldson,
'17, Geroid Robinson, '17, B. C. Wohl
ford, '18, H. S. Marshutz, '] 7, F. W.
Weeks, '18, W. M. Roberts, '18, Niel
Allen, '18, E. R. Martin, '18, W. J.
Gores, '17, and N. H. Petree, '19.
