# Debaters to Battle for Carnot Award
## Blue and Gold to Clash With Cardinal for Forensic Honors 
### 
With but two hours' notice of the
question to be discussed, Stanford and
California debaters will take their
stand in the twenty-third annual Car
not debate tonight at 8 o'clock in the
Stanford Assembly Hall. The general
subject has been announced as the
"Reconstruction of France After the
War," but the specific question will
not be announced until this evening.
A severe series of tryouts and elim
inations have resulted in the selection
of one of the strongest forensic ag
gregations that has ever entered the
Carnot debate from Stanford. M. L.
McClintock, '18, J. G. Drlscoll, Jr., '18,
and J. C. Holland, '17, with E. E. Will
iams, '17, as alternate, will represent
the Cardinal. McClintock and Dris
coll have taken part in Tri-State de
bates, Holland has won honors in dis
sertation contests and Williams is a
last year's Carnot medal winner.
Each man will choose for himself
the side of the question he is to argue.
