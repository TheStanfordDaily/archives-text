Reports from the Stanford ambu
lance men already in France show
that they have entered upon their
work with great enthusiasm. Presi
dent Wilbur as well as members of
the Friends of France Society are
keen to have another Stanford corps
enter the field. According to Presi
dent Wilbur, the Stanford corps can
be switched into American service as
soon as American troops are sent to
the French front.
