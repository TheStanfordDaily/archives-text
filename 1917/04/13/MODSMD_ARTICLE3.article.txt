# Trio of Veterans Will Pull on Oars in Stanford Shell
## 
### 
With five new men in the varsity
boat the "dope sheet" for the big re
gatta from the Stanford point of view
is hard to make out. Individually,
however, the Cardinal oarsmen are a

Three Vetornns In Itnce.

the varsity boat for the first time.
His great reach gives him a big ad
vantage in pulling his oar at No. 3.
The other four- oarsmen, La Forge,
Taylor, Watts, and King, had seats in
the 1919 shell. They have been
