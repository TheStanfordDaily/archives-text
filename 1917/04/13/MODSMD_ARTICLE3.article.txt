# Trio of Veterans Will Pull on Oars in Stanford Shell
## 
### 
With five new men in the varsity
boat the "dope sheet" for the big re
gatta from the Stanford point of view
is hard to make out. Individually,
however, the Cardinal oarsmen are a
match for the representatives of Cali
fornia or the University of Washing
ton.
Three Vetornns In Itnce.
The men on whom the Cardinal
fans are counting for the greatest
strength in the varsity are Captain
Maurer, McEuen, and Rogers. All are
seniors and veterans of many races.
Captain Maurer has been moved
from his old position of stroke to Xo.
2 for the big contest. His place will
will be taken by last year's freshman
stroke, King. The captain is one of
the well known oarsmen of the coun
try. He was stroke of the eight that
electrified the crew world at Pough
keepsie in 1915, by finishing a spec
tacular second to Cornell. Maurer
weighs 174 pounds, and is an ideal
oarsman from every point of view.
.UcEueu Kig Factor.
McEuen, another veteran of Pough
keepsie, returns to crew after an ab
sence of one season. He is the sec
ond largest man and in many ways
the most powerful. McEuen can be
counted on to be the big factor Sat
urday.
The third veteran, Rogers, is, in
addition to being the big man on the
varsity, a tower of strength in form
and pull. At his position. No. 6, he
will in all probability be the strong
est oar in the shell.
Itiissell A New Man.
Russell, a member of the second
varsity last year, will have a seat in
the varsity boat for the first time.
His great reach gives him a big ad
vantage in pulling his oar at No. 3.
The other four- oarsmen, La Forge,
Taylor, Watts, and King, had seats in
the 1919 shell. They have been
:~1 1 nAC-iUnno nnh'
successfully competing against some
of the best crew material in the Uni
versity, and can be counted on to
come through in their first big race.
King will set the pace for the var
sity at stroke, Saturday. One of the
hardest workers in the water sport
lie may be counted on to show the
best form of any man in the varsity.
La Forge, at 4, holds with McEuen
the responsibility for the middle of
the boat. He was a power in the
freshman race last year and will un
doubtedly pull one of the powerful
oars against Stanford's rivals.
Watts, at one of the hardest posi
tions in the boat, No. 7, is a real oars
man. He has the necessary form and
power to change the stroke with King
at will and keep the varsity at top
speed.
Bow will claim the fourth sopho
more in Taylor. Although he rowed
Nf). 3 in the 1919 boat, Taylor has
shown worlds of form at his new po
sition.
The man who will perhaps be of
the greatest assitance in winning is
the veteran, Lyons, at coxswain. The
little junior held the same position in
his freshmen crew and the last year's
varsity.
With Steinbeck and Andrews as sub
stitutes the Cardinal varsity should
put up a winning fight. There is the
necessary i>ower and experience to
uphold the standard of rowing set by
former eights by returning victor over
Ihe Washington and California com
binations.

Maurer, McEuen, and Rogers. All are
seniors and veterans of many races.
Captain Maurer has been moved
from his old position of stroke to Xo.
2 for the big contest. His place will
will be taken by last year's freshman
stroke, King. The captain is one of
the well known oarsmen of the coun
try. He was stroke of the eight that
electrified the crew world at Pough
keepsie in 1915, by finishing a spec
tacular second to Cornell. Maurer
weighs 174 pounds, and is an ideal
oarsman from every point of view.
.UcEueu Kig Factor.
McEuen, another veteran of Pough
keepsie, returns to crew after an ab
sence of one season. He is the sec
ond largest man and in many ways
the most powerful. McEuen can be
counted on to be the big factor Sat
urday.
The third veteran, Rogers, is, in
addition to being the big man on the
varsity, a tower of strength in form
and pull. At his position. No. 6, he
will in all probability be the strong
est oar in the shell.
Itiissell A New Man.
Russell, a member of the second
varsity last year, will have a seat in
the varsity boat for the first time.
His great reach gives him a big ad
vantage in pulling his oar at No. 3.
The other four- oarsmen, La Forge,
Taylor, Watts, and King, had seats in
the 1919 shell. They have been
:~1 1 nAC-iUnno nnh'
successfully competing against some
of the best crew material in the Uni
versity, and can be counted on to
come through in their first big race.
King will set the pace for the var
sity at stroke, Saturday. One of the
hardest workers in the water sport
lie may be counted on to show the
best form of any man in the varsity.
La Forge, at 4, holds with McEuen
the responsibility for the middle of
the boat. He was a power in the
freshman race last year and will un
doubtedly pull one of the powerful
oars against Stanford's rivals.
Watts, at one of the hardest posi
tions in the boat, No. 7, is a real oars
man. He has the necessary form and
power to change the stroke with King
at will and keep the varsity at top
speed.
Bow will claim the fourth sopho
more in Taylor. Although he rowed
Nf). 3 in the 1919 boat, Taylor has
shown worlds of form at his new po
sition.
The man who will perhaps be of
the greatest assitance in winning is
the veteran, Lyons, at coxswain. The
little junior held the same position in
his freshmen crew and the last year's
varsity.
With Steinbeck and Andrews as sub
stitutes the Cardinal varsity should
put up a winning fight. There is the
necessary i>ower and experience to
uphold the standard of rowing set by
former eights by returning victor over
Ihe Washington and California com
binations.
With five new men in the varsity
boat the "dope sheet" for the big re
gatta from the Stanford point of view
is hard to make out. Individually,
however, the Cardinal oarsmen are a
match for the representatives of Cali
fornia or the University of Washing
