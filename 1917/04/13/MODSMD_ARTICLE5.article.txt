# CRIPPLED BRUINS OPPOSE LOCAL TOSSERS
## STANFORD CONFIDENT Fourth Baseball Game Should Go to Cardinals With Hoever Pitching 
### 
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia baseball teams cross sticks to
morrow afternoon in the fourth game
of the 1917 series. With the Blue and
Gold one contest to the good, the
Cardinal aggregation may make their
last stand. Following the intercol
legiate track meet, the game will
start at 4 o'clock, on the Berkeley
diamond. For those who have not
purchased the series tickets, the ad
mission will be fifty cents, the tickets
being sold at the gate.
Breaks Will Decide.
After being nosed out in the open
ing battle, and completely forgetting
ail they ever knew about the national
nastime in the second game, the locals
staged a real comeback last Saturday,
and forced the series to go four
games. Close followers of the rival
teams say that only the breaks will
determine whether the series will run
the full five games or be cut off with
out the rubber encounter.
Captain "Doc" Hayes is very opti
mistic over the prospects of a victory
tomorrow. Regardless of the injuries
at the state institution, he believes
that Stanford is now able to hold her
own against the best the Bruins have
to offer. With Captain Sammy Adair,
Claude Roliwer, and Hudson out of
the contest, he thinks that there can
be little doubt as to the final result.
It:ill May Pitch.
The pitching selection at California
has not been made by Coach Zamloch
as yet. One would naturally expect
the mighty Dimock to hurl them over,
but reports have been circulated to
the effect that Ball, a transfer from
Occidental College, will chuck them
to the Cardinal batters.
Hoever will undoubtedly start on
the mound for Stanford, with Camp
bell on the receiving end. Hoever
practically held the opponents liitless
last Saturday, and if he twirls in the
same form, Stanford is a sure winner.
Hayes will play lirst, with Shriver at
second, Stevens on third, and Cowan
completing the infield at short. The
only doubtful positions are in the out
field. Lilly will of course cover cen
ter, and the left and right Held berths
will be selected from VVilkins, Mit
chell, Noonan, Dickey, and Bihlman.
Braden, Reagon, and Wilcox may get
into the contest before the conclusion
of the last frame.
in the first three games of the inter
collegiate series, the men have batted
as follows: Campbell, .429; Hayes,
.333; Shriver, .333; Mitchell, .250;
Mattei, .250; Stevens, .180; Lilly, .IG6;
Dickey, .166; Cowan, .076; Reagan,
Braden, Wilcox, Draper, and Hoever
have failed to connect for safe ones.
California will play their usual line
up, except that Vechi will be in Adair's
place, Morse will play second in Hud
son's place, and Masters will fill Roh
wer's position at shortstop. Either
Dimock. Ball, or McCabe will pitch.
