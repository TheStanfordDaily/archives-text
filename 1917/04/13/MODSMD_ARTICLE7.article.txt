# ALL INDICATIONS POINT TO CLOSE DECISION ON TRACK
## Coaches and Captains Hesitate to Name Victors 
### 
Coaches and captains for both teams
agree that the meet will he the closest
in \cars, both sides being hopeful of
the final outcome. Captain Aupperle
expresses himself us expecting a
Cardinal victory, though admitting
that the naming of heats weakens
Stanford's chances.
Coach Christie of the Hears' squad
Fays that the meet will be so close

that it will take the relav to decide
the wimit r. The Daily Californian's
expert, C. M. Chaplin, feels that the
one place in any one event may result
in victory or defeat.
After perusing the opinions, one is ,
forced to the conclusion that all dope:
points to the closest score in years, j
Statements from authorities on the j
meet follow:
Coach Tenipleton Looks
For Stanford >Viki.
"The running of heats in the dashes j
and hurdles will undoubtedly work aj
hardship upon our team and for this j
reason any forecast may go astray.
However, 1 anticipate another Stan
ford win."

Kelav To Decide.
"Prognostication, guessers, lore
tellers, alias dopesters, are as busy
as can be, making charts, making ath
letes run to a certain second, jump to
a certain fraction of an inch in the
Big Meet, April 14. I honestly lose

"The Big Meet is only another one
of many of the best and closest dual
meets held in all the world. No col
leges in this world have the dual
meet class, year in and year out, as
have Stanford and California.
"The elements of chance must
necessarily enter in a close meet, — j
it's the breaks both colleges are Innk-


Coilcli "Rip" Templeton
ing for. Guess the breaks and you
have the winner. California has a
fine team, and so has Stanford. Being
as partisan as I can be, and being as
neutral as I can be, my opinion is
that Mr. Relay will about mean who
wins. A good crowd, a good day, and
we shall see a meet worth while to
all concerned."
Captain Aupperle Thinks
Cardinal Will Win.
"Saturday's track meet should end
in a victory for the Cardinal; but
win or lose, each member of the team
will do his best. The meet will be
won only after a hard fight, in fact it
looks as if the meet will develop into
the closest in years.
"As usual, California is exception
ally strong in field events, while Stan
ford seems to have the edge in the
track events, but California has some
men who may surprise us in the short
distances.
"The decision to run heats in both
hurdle and sprint races will weaken
Stanford's chances."

Says -Meet Close.
"California is on the defensive in
I track, especially with reference to
i Stanford, as the Blue and Gold en
thusiast has nothing to review except
I defeats. The meet should be close, —
so close in fact that one place in any
one event may turn the scale to vic
tory or defeat. California is superior
on the field, with Stanford this year,
as always, superior on the track.
Grun. ky and House are looked to for
the banner event of the meet —
! hurdles, as records may fall in either
race. Moody in the quarter, and
Blanchard in the half look like mid
dle-distance winners for California."

fine team, and so has Stanford. Being
as partisan as I can be, and being as
neutral as I can be, my opinion is

Captain Aupperle Thinks
Cardinal Will Win.
"Saturday's track meet should end
in a victory for the Cardinal; but
win or lose, each member of the team
will do his best. The meet will be
won only after a hard fight, in fact it
looks as if the meet will develop into
the closest in years.
"As usual, California is exception
ally strong in field events, while Stan
ford seems to have the edge in the
track events, but California has some
men who may surprise us in the short
distances.

hurdle and sprint races will weaken
Stanford's chances."

"California is on the defensive in
I track, especially with reference to
i Stanford, as the Blue and Gold en
thusiast has nothing to review except
I defeats. The meet should be close, —
so close in fact that one place in any
one event may turn the scale to vic
tory or defeat. California is superior
on the field, with Stanford this year,
as always, superior on the track.
Grun. ky and House are looked to for
the banner event of the meet —
! hurdles, as records may fall in either
race. Moody in the quarter, and
Blanchard in the half look like mid
dle-distance winners for California."
Coaches and captains for both teams
agree that the meet will he the closest
in \cars, both sides being hopeful of
the final outcome. Captain Aupperle
expresses himself us expecting a
Cardinal victory, though admitting
that the naming of heats weakens
Stanford's chances.
