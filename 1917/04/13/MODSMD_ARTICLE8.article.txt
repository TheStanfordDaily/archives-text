# Unexpected Break May Upset Dope on Big Meet
## 
### 
Varsity track men in both the
Cardinal and Blue and Gold camp are
all in readiness lor Starter Ollie
Snedigar's order to take their marks,
and all available dope material points
to one of the closest meets in years.

in any one event is liable to upset

The team will be taken to the

Hehrens. Hammer throwers
make the trip on the 9:13. The
meet will start promptly at 2

the field events and Stanford
looks to have the odds on the
track. However, contrary to the
usual run, there are several
unknown quantities wearing the
Cardinal on the field, and some
surprises may be sprung on the
Bruins.
Fans expect the hurdle races
to feature the meet. "Jud"
House and Carroll Grunsky
have both been clearing the
sticks in great form and some
record time may be expected.
House is the favorite in the low
hurdles while the California
hurdler looks to be the winner
in the high.
The half-mile run, with Blan
chard and Schnell probably
leading the field, is also eagerly
awaited. Schnell, though not in

been rounding into shape during the
last few days, and should m.anage to
dispose of the speedy Blanchard.

meet, the quarter-mile also offers sev
