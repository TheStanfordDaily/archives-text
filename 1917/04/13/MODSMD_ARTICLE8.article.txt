# Unexpected Break May Upset Dope on Big Meet
## 
### 
Varsity track men in both the
Cardinal and Blue and Gold camp are
all in readiness lor Starter Ollie
Snedigar's order to take their marks,
and all available dope material points
to one of the closest meets in years.
Coaches "Hie" Templeton and Walter
Christie are both optimistic, but at
the same time admit that the break
in any one event is liable to upset

prophecy and result in victory
or defeat.
The team will be taken to the
University of California campus
tomorrow morning on the 11:35
train, by Graduate Manager
Hehrens. Hammer throwers
make the trip on the 9:13. The
meet will start promptly at 2
o'clock.
The Californians appear, as
usual, to be slightly stronger in
the field events and Stanford
looks to have the odds on the
track. However, contrary to the
usual run, there are several
unknown quantities wearing the
Cardinal on the field, and some
surprises may be sprung on the
Bruins.
Fans expect the hurdle races
to feature the meet. "Jud"
House and Carroll Grunsky
have both been clearing the
sticks in great form and some
record time may be expected.
House is the favorite in the low
hurdles while the California
hurdler looks to be the winner
in the high.
The half-mile run, with Blan
chard and Schnell probably
leading the field, is also eagerly
awaited. Schnell, though not in

Ilie best of form for some time, has
been rounding into shape during the
last few days, and should m.anage to
dispose of the speedy Blanchard.
As was the case in the freshmen
meet, the quarter-mile also offers sev

Rogers, Dievendorff, and Moody look
to be the pick of the field and Cali
fornians are pinning great faith in
Moody. But from the present out
look Rogers will break the tape and
Dievendorff has a great way of finish
ing in an intercollegiate race that
may result badly for the Californian.
The contest on the field promises
to be that of the shot put, when Bihl
man, Caughey and Liversidge stack
hp. All three have enviable records
and at present Cardinal supporters
look to "Here" Bihlman to gather five
points. Liversidge has been tossing
the shot a greater distance than
"Reg" Caughey, but in competition
Caughey has always seemed to have
a little the best of it. At any rate,
the fight for points in this event
should be worth going some distance
to witness.
Most of the critics seem agreed
that the relay will be the dicisive
factor of the meet. With F. Rogers,
'Dievendorff, Lachmund, Schnell, Her
tel, McCloskey, Kegley, and B. Rog
ers to select from, Stanford fans may
feel that Cardinal hopes are bright.
It will take a speedy quartet to de
feat them.

ers to select from, Stanford fans may
feel that Cardinal hopes are bright.
It will take a speedy quartet to de
feat them.
Varsity track men in both the
Cardinal and Blue and Gold camp are
all in readiness lor Starter Ollie
Snedigar's order to take their marks,
and all available dope material points
to one of the closest meets in years.
Coaches "Hie" Templeton and Walter
Christie are both optimistic, but at
the same time admit that the break
in any one event is liable to upset

prophecy and result in victory
or defeat.
The team will be taken to the
University of California campus
tomorrow morning on the 11:35
train, by Graduate Manager
Hehrens. Hammer throwers
make the trip on the 9:13. The
meet will start promptly at 2
o'clock.
The Californians appear, as
usual, to be slightly stronger in
the field events and Stanford
looks to have the odds on the
track. However, contrary to the
usual run, there are several
unknown quantities wearing the
Cardinal on the field, and some
surprises may be sprung on the
Bruins.
Fans expect the hurdle races
to feature the meet. "Jud"
House and Carroll Grunsky
have both been clearing the
sticks in great form and some
record time may be expected.
House is the favorite in the low
hurdles while the California
hurdler looks to be the winner
in the high.
The half-mile run, with Blan
chard and Schnell probably
leading the field, is also eagerly
awaited. Schnell, though not in

Ilie best of form for some time, has
been rounding into shape during the
last few days, and should m.anage to
dispose of the speedy Blanchard.
As was the case in the freshmen
meet, the quarter-mile also offers sev

Rogers, Dievendorff, and Moody look
to be the pick of the field and Cali
fornians are pinning great faith in
Moody. But from the present out
look Rogers will break the tape and
Dievendorff has a great way of finish
ing in an intercollegiate race that
may result badly for the Californian.
The contest on the field promises
to be that of the shot put, when Bihl
man, Caughey and Liversidge stack
hp. All three have enviable records
and at present Cardinal supporters
look to "Here" Bihlman to gather five
points. Liversidge has been tossing
the shot a greater distance than
"Reg" Caughey, but in competition
Caughey has always seemed to have
a little the best of it. At any rate,
the fight for points in this event
should be worth going some distance
to witness.
Most of the critics seem agreed
that the relay will be the dicisive
factor of the meet. With F. Rogers,
