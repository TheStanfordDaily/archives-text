# CARDINAL VICTORS OVER BLUE AND GOLD IN TRACK MEET AND CREW RACE
## VARSITY CREW SECOND IN THREE-CORNERED REGATTA 
### H.G. Swendsen 
Ten years ago the University of California coaches tinned out a crew
that defeated Stanford in the annual regatta between the two Universities.
From the showing of the varsities Saturday on the Oakland estuary, how
ever, it will be ten years more before this feat is duplicated. For the Car
dinal triumphed over the best Blue and Gold eight of years for the ninth
consecutive time and shattered again the hopes of the Berkeley rooters.
The regatta was a tri-cornered affair between the University of Wash
ington, California and Stanford. The northerners, pulling a long, steady
stroke, crossed the line first. Stanford was second, by about three lengths,
with the Blue and Gold shell two lengths to the rear. Seldom has a better
exhibition of the water sport been given than that by Washington.

Coach Conibear's men showed form
and power that never left the result
of the three mile grind in doubt after
they got under way.

. Dean Witter started the
eights off perfectly at 9:4.1.
Both California and Stan
ford hit up a forty stroke
with Washington rowing
thirty-eight. After about
forty yards, however,
Washington slowed down
to thirty-two, with the
Cardinal and Blue and
Gold rowing four faster.
California held the lead
with her stroke for the
first mile, but on the turn
into the two-mile stretch

to the final the Berkeley boat was left
in the rear with Washington in the
lead.
Long Pull Tells.
The long pull of the northerners in
the rough water began to tell in the ;
second mile and they gained a lead
that could not be beaten. They were
holding a stroke of thirty-two. Stan
ford was second with a stroke of thir
ty-four and California fighting hard
in third place at thirty-six.
With the turn into the last mile
! Washington dropped to twenty-eight.
The water was rougher than in the
upper part of the course and the Car
dinal boat could not gain on the
steady northern oarsmen, although
they made a hard try. All the crews
slowed their stroke in the final grind,
and California and Stanford began the
fight for second place.

When the final flag was reached
Washington, holding its same steady
pull, was first with all the men in the
best of condition. Stanford crossed
the line three lengths behind with a
faster stroke that was ineffective in
the rough water, and California
brought up the rear with a still faster
pull than the Cardinal.
Course Is Rough.
Undoubtedly the condition of the
course had much to do with the Wash
ington victory, but it is extremely un
likely that Stanford would have fin
ished first had the water been smooth.
The Purple and Gold time of 1G min
utes 32 seconds is five seconds faster
than the Stanford time of last year
under good conditions and points to a
victory under any circumstances. The
Cardinal time was 16 minutes 57 sec- i
onds and California's 17 minutes 14
seconds.
When the time for the start of the
freshman race came around the wind
which had been strong all morning in
creased, and when rain began to fall
the coaches and starters after a con
sultation decided to change the course
of the race upstream. Accordingly J
the crews started at the Webster j
street bridge and finished at the Park
street bridge.
Washington and California led from
the first. Stanford's babes never were j
even in the race. At the mile the |
northerners and the Blue and Gold
were neck and neck, with the Cardin
als three lengths behind. Here Wash
ington settled down to the steady
stroke that won the varsity race and
gradually pulled away from the Cali
fornia shell. At the finish they had !
increased their lead to three lengths, j
with Stanford four lengths behind.
Although outweighed five pounds to
the man by California and a pound by
the Cardinal men the Washington
freshmen pulled a race that broughtl
admiration from every spectator. |
Their stroke was much the same as
that of their varsity and spoke well
for the coaching of "Hy" Conibear.
Berkeley Disappointed.
California with all their weight
could not hold the lead in the final
grind. Their showing was a disap
pointment to the Berkeley supporters,
since the dope sheet gave a victory to
the Blue and Gold "babes."
In the 1920 race Stanford could not
hold its own. The superior form of
the Washington combination and
weight of the Californians proved too
much for the freshmen. Although
they fought gamely to the finish the
spectators saw no chance of their
winning.
Before the race L. R. Tilton, row
ing at number 5, was elected captain
of the "babes." Tilton is the biggest
man in the shell and by his work all
season has well earned the honor.
