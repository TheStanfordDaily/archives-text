# CARDINAL VICTORS OVER BLUE AND GOLD IN TRACK MEET AND CREW RACE
## VARSITY CREW SECOND IN THREE-CORNERED REGATTA 
### H.G. Swendsen 
Ten years ago the University of California coaches tinned out a crew
that defeated Stanford in the annual regatta between the two Universities.
From the showing of the varsities Saturday on the Oakland estuary, how
ever, it will be ten years more before this feat is duplicated. For the Car
dinal triumphed over the best Blue and Gold eight of years for the ninth
consecutive time and shattered again the hopes of the Berkeley rooters.
The regatta was a tri-cornered affair between the University of Wash
ington, California and Stanford. The northerners, pulling a long, steady
stroke, crossed the line first. Stanford was second, by about three lengths,
with the Blue and Gold shell two lengths to the rear. Seldom has a better
exhibition of the water sport been given than that by Washington.

Coach Conibear's men showed form
and power that never left the result
of the three mile grind in doubt after
they got under way.

. Dean Witter started the
eights off perfectly at 9:4.1.
Both California and Stan
ford hit up a forty stroke
with Washington rowing
thirty-eight. After about
forty yards, however,
Washington slowed down
to thirty-two, with the
Cardinal and Blue and
Gold rowing four faster.
California held the lead
with her stroke for the
first mile, but on the turn
into the two-mile stretch

to the final the Berkeley boat was left
in the rear with Washington in the
lead.
Long Pull Tells.
The long pull of the northerners in
the rough water began to tell in the ;
second mile and they gained a lead
that could not be beaten. They were
holding a stroke of thirty-two. Stan
ford was second with a stroke of thir
ty-four and California fighting hard
in third place at thirty-six.
With the turn into the last mile
! Washington dropped to twenty-eight.
The water was rougher than in the
upper part of the course and the Car
dinal boat could not gain on the
steady northern oarsmen, although
they made a hard try. All the crews
slowed their stroke in the final grind,
and California and Stanford began the
fight for second place.
