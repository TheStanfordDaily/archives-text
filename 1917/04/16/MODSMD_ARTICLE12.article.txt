Stanford boosters had little to grumble about last Saturday, with the
big sports wind-up taking on a decided Cardinal tinge. What were con
ceded to be but doubtful chances were stretched into decisive victories by
the fighting spirit of our men on the track and in the field, and to a high
ly satisfactory win over the Blue and Gold on the water. The old habit of
coming through has not deserted the Farm products by any means, with
the result that Stanford again takes her fair share of spring victories.
Particular credit is due Coach "Husky" Guerena, Captain Rix Maurer
and his men for their fine showing after a season which was fraught with
difficulties and mishaps. No sport at Stanford is under such handicaps as
crew, and we venture to say that no crew in the country would come
through so consistently under like conditions. It is a hard sport which
gets a minimum of encouragement from an unseeing student body. To
these men, and to Coach Templeton and Captain Aupperle we offer hearti
est congratulations. Cardinal fencers deserve credit for a well-earned
victory.
One of the most pleasing features of the day was the fine sportsman
like attitude of all contestants. Doth sides took victory without too much
exultation and defeat without ill feeling. We may well be proud of our
rival of the Blue and Gold.

Now that athletics are well over, we may all turn our undivided atten
tion to our work for the remainder of the semester. It is to be hoped
that those taking intensive training will not be so carried away by their
zeal as to render the campus unbearable for those who are continuing
their studying. If we must practice the manual of arms at home to keep
out. of the awkward squad, let's do it in reasonable hours.
