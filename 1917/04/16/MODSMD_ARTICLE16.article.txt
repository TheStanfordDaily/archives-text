The Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
1 am writing this letter to make
known that I am accepting the ruling
of Men's Student Council and that I
am withdrawing from the office of
editor-in-chief and from editorial in
fluence on the Chaparral. My com
munication in the Daily Palo Alto last
evening, which was limited in space,
by reason of a change in the word
ing, and because of a general misin
terpretation has misquoted my posi
tion, creating a wrong impression of
my stand. I had no idea of conveying
the inference that 112 wished to fight for
continuance in office, but 112 was high
ly desirous of separating the personal
element from the principle involved
in the case. This you can verify by
my notice to the Student Council at
the time.
The principle of editorial censorship
is now pending vote of the student
body, and my purpose In making the
motion that appeared in the Daily
was to insure the future editors of
campus publications from the possibil
ity of their removal from office upon
the indefinite grounds of "incompetent
judgment"—for which my case would
set a precedent.
I do not wish to deny to the Coun
cil the right to hold the same pow
ers over the editors of publications
that they do over any student, nor
the right to take them to account for
immoral matter which they might pub
lish. But you can see that my case
extends their powers considerably—to
the point of endangering the free ex
pression of student opinion. For that
reason I believe that the Student
Council should not have the power to
remove an editor from office without
the approval of the student body.
This principle will be placed before
the student body on Wednesday as an
amendment to the constitution of the
Associated Students, and if it is
passed it will satisfy all claims that
I have in the matter. If it is not
passed I shall be content to accept its
defeat. For this reason 1 am with
drawing from office to make clear that
there is no personal insubordination
whatever.
Very truly yours,
LANSING WARREN.
