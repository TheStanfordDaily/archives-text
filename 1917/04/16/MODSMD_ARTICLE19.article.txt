# 1920 Swimmers to Meet Berkeley Babes Tomorrow
## 
### 
Freshmen swimmers are scheduled to
meet the University of California first
year men in the Cardinal tank Tues
day at 4:30. Captain Greene of the
freshmen is confident that his team is
superior to any that the Blue and
Gold can ship down here, and looks
forward to a victory.
Stewart is on probation and will not
swim, but with Balback, Considine,
â€¢Doe, Sparling and Greene, the fresh
men have a combination that can not
easily be defeated.
