# ROSENBLATT WINS CARNOT DEBATE FOR CALIFORNIA
## 
### 
California defeated Stanford in the
twenty-third annual Carnot debate
Friday evening, when M. S. Rosen
blatt, '18, senior at the State Univer
sity, won the medal, though closely
contested by M. L. McClintock, 'IS,
of Stanford, who in some ways proved
his superior in argument.
Ai'iiiic Government Ownership.
At six o'clock, two hours before the
debate, the specific question, "Re
solved, That the policy of national
ownership of industries in France
should be extended after the war,"
was announced, and the orators chose
their sides, according to their individ
ual preferences. The general topic,
made public several months ago, was
"Reconstruction in France after the
War."
J. G. Driscoll, Jr., '18, of Stanford
opened the debate for the affirmative,
dealing with the economic benefits
that would result from government
ownership of industries. "The neces
sities that will arise at the end of the
war are greater than the individual
system of ownership can provide for,"
he said.

| H. A. Hyde, '17, of California, first
I negative speaker, pled for individual
j ism in the French industrial system
;on more or less metaphysical ami
J spiritual grounds. His ideal was "a
| France which does not exist to make
a living, but to make a light." "If
democracy is worth fighting for, it is
worth working for; if democracy ts
worth dying for it is worth living for,"
he said.
"It is not a revolution but an evo
lution that is demanded by the indus
trial situation in France after the
war," argued .1. C. Holland, '17, of
Stanford, pointing out that France is
ready for government ownership in a
financial way.
MH lintock's Speech Strong.
McClintock, second negative, showed
the advantages of private ownership
under government supervision as op
posed to public ownership of indus
tries. France already has an over
whelming war debt, and this will be
increased at the end of the present
war by thousands upon thousands of
pensions, McClintock showed, going
on to give an idea of the immensity
of such an undertaking as the as
sumption of ownership of all the in
dustries of France by the government.
Rosenblatt's winning speech, in the
affirmative, was an eloquent plea for
the continuation of war-time govern
ment ownership in France in times of
peace.
"In 'no man's land,' 'somewhere in
France,' " he said, "men are fighting
for France, but, God willing, they
will come back some day to again
face the problems of labor. These
problems are to lie solved by govern
ment ownership. The principles of
liberty, equality and fraternity for
which France stands can only be car
ried to the ends of the nation by a
strong government in accord with the
extension of national ownership.

France must solve the problems of
reconstruction after the war as she
has solved those of the war, by gov
ernment ownership."
S. Barke, '17, last California orator,
on the negative, attacked government
j ownership as socialistic, economical-
I ly and politically unwise, and as op
[ posed to the fundamental French
characteristics of individualism and
liberty.
"it is not impossible to get good
labor conditions with private owner
ship under government control," he
pointed out.
Supervisor Murdock of San Fran
cisco, Professor Scholz of the Uni
versity of California English depart
ment, and Assistant Professor E. E.
Robinson of tlie Stanford History de
partment, acted as judges. Dean C. A.
Huston of the Stanford Law School
presided.
