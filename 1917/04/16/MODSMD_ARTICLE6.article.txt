# BRUINS TAKE 1917 SERIES FROM LOCALS
## 
### Neil H. Petree 
Weird, uncertain baseball was
dished up to some five thousand
Cardinal and lilue and Gold rooters
yesterday afternoon in the concluding
event of the days list of heats. With
both teams doing their best to present
the fourth game of the 1917 series to
their opponents via the error column,
Dimock stoutly opposed the policy
and sent the Stanford batters back in
regular order. The final score was
4 to 0, the nearest thing to any kind
of a marker recorded on the official
score book, being the local's one and
only hit, a single by "Busher" Cow
an. California is the 1917 champion
on the diamond.
Hoover Reserves Credit.
Rig Gus Hoever deserves all the
| credit possible for the fans to bestow

upon a hard
working and
unappreciated
heaver. Me
twirled a mas
terly game of
ball and chased
all wild throws
that the other
members of
the slumbering
nine forgot to
run after. It
was his chuck
ing that saved
a count similar
to the 16 to 2
score of the
farcical second

game of the intercollegiate series.
California tallied three runs in the
second inning. Ray Rohwer led off
with a two-base swat to deep right
field. Works smashed one at Cowan


"Doc" Hayes
who tossed to Stevens to catch the
speeding Rohwer. The veteran third
baseman dropped the ball and all
were safe, Works having taken sec
ond on the misplay. Gimbal struck
out, but Vechi scored Rohwer and
Works with a scratchy two-bagger to
left. Cowan let Smith's easy roller
go through his legs, and Vechi came
across. Dimock ended the inning by
whiffing.
Delayed Steal Effective.
The fourth run was scored in the
sixth frame. C. Rohwer singled and
stole second, while Campbell was de
bating with himself in regard to the
prospects of war with Germany. R.
Rohwer got a life on Campbell's wild
toss to first, his brother taking third.
Here came the merry-go-round. With
Zamlock holding his sides on the
Berkeley bench, and both the rooting
sections howling with laughter, the
California baserunners pulled the time
worn delayed steal, while the Stan
ford infielders were playing catch
over the head of the Mr. R. Rohwer.
flis brother scampered home during
the melee. Works laid down an in
field single, and the stunt was tried
again. This time it failed with Shriv
er pegging home perfectly. Hoever
struck out the next two batters.
Stanford came close to scoring in
both the third and sixth innings. With
Hoever on third base and Cowan on
the keystone station, Dimock fanned
three men in the third canto, and in
the sixth with Mitchell on third and
Cowan on first all went for naught,
Shriver and Hayes going out before
airtight fielding.
Censure Berkeley Rooters.
Severe censure should fall upon
the Blue and Gold rooters for their
"hip-hip-whoa" directed upon Gus
Hoever, the Stanford pitcher. This
type of baseball enthusiasm is gener
ally found in the bleachers of the
hoodlum fandom supporting some
class D organization of the national
pastime. Stanford is forced to cheer
for a poor ball team, but the mem
bers of the Cardinal delegation are
gentlemen even in the face of defeat.
The box score follows.
