# BRUINS TAKE 1917 SERIES FROM LOCALS
## 
### Neil H. Petree 
Weird, uncertain baseball was
dished up to some five thousand
Cardinal and lilue and Gold rooters
yesterday afternoon in the concluding
event of the days list of heats. With
both teams doing their best to present
the fourth game of the 1917 series to
their opponents via the error column,
Dimock stoutly opposed the policy
and sent the Stanford batters back in
regular order. The final score was
4 to 0, the nearest thing to any kind
of a marker recorded on the official
score book, being the local's one and
only hit, a single by "Busher" Cow
an. California is the 1917 champion
on the diamond.
Hoover Reserves Credit.
Rig Gus Hoever deserves all the
| credit possible for the fans to bestow

upon a hard
working and
unappreciated
heaver. Me
twirled a mas
terly game of
ball and chased
all wild throws
that the other
members of
the slumbering
nine forgot to
run after. It
was his chuck
ing that saved
a count similar
to the 16 to 2
score of the
farcical second

game of the intercollegiate series.
California tallied three runs in the
second inning. Ray Rohwer led off
with a two-base swat to deep right
field. Works smashed one at Cowan
