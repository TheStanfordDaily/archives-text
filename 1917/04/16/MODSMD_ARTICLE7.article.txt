# STANFORD TEAM COMES THROUGH
## California Humbled by 67 to 55 Score--Dope Is Upset University Honors Coach Templeton and Captain Aupperle for Well Balanced Squad That Took Measure of Mighty Bears 
### Landis O. Weaver 
All hail Coach Templeton, Captain
Aupperle and the Stanford varsity
track team. This combination hnng
up another victory over the Califor
nia track team, making the fifth con-

secutive year
that the Cardin
al has waved
triumphant over
the Blue and
Gold in the an
nual track and
field meet. Six
ty-seven to fifty
five was the
final score.
Stanford ath
letes came thru
in wonderful
style, and even
in the field
events where
the Cardinal was
supposed to he
weakest, several
surprises were

sprung. Millor proVided the first bit
of enthusiasm to thr Ft frvd bleach
ers by taking third in the hammer,
thus upsetting the dope that the
Bear's huskies would take nine points
in this event.
Credit Due Aupperle.
Great credit is due Captain Aupper
le for his showing, as the little cap
tain ran just hard enough in the mile
to finish second to .Chapman, saving
himself for the half mile, where he
again captured three more points for
the Cardinal, beating out the speedy
Blanchard and finishing second to
Schnell. This was the best race of
the day.
Quarter a Wonder.
The quarter was one of the feature
events of the day, and the only disap
pointment was that Rogers was forced
to take second to Moody. It appeared
to many that if positions had been
reversed and Rogers had been given
the pole in place of Moody, the result

would have been the opposite. The
relay would seem to bear this out,
as Rogers stepped out in the relay
with a twelve-yard lead, Moody not
gaining an inch on him.
"Jud" House did what was expected
of him by winning the century dash
and the low hurdles, incidentally ty
ing Norton's Stanford-California in
tercollegiate record for the low sticks
of :24 1-5.
"Here" Bihlman broke the existing
Stanford-California record in the shot
put with his last heave, a mighty one
that went for 47 feet 8 3-4 inches.
This betters the record of Rice of
California of 46 feet 7 3-4 inches.
Reg Caughey came second and up to
the final toss of Bihlman was in the
lead with Bihlman second. The much
touted Liversidge was forced to con
tent himself with a third place.
Stanford Fails in Broad.
The broad jump was the only event
of the day in which Stanford failed to
score. Jackson, the Blue and Gold
skipper-elect for next year, set a new
record in this event with a jump of
23 feet 8 5-8 inches.
The relay was thought to decide the
meet, though Greve afterwards jumped
into second place in the pole vault,
giving the three points needed to en
able Stanford to win the meet without
the relay. A better relay eould not
iiave been imagined. Hertel ran the
first lap for Stanford and Jackson for
the Bears. Hertel had the pole, but
Jackson cut in and nearly threw the
| Card on the first run. He came back
and ran neck and neck the entire lap.
Kegley and Kerr had the next lap
and also finished abreast. In the
third round the relay was practically
won. Dievendorff and Pitts were the
two runners, and the way Dievendorff
tore around the oval was a revelation.
Pitts had no chance with the little
Cardinal runner, as Dievendorff was
out to win and so gave Rogers a good
twelve yard lead over Moody. Not to


Itililmau
be outdone, Rogers gave Moody no
chance to gain an inch and finished
the lap as though Moody were run
ning at his shoulder. When this was
over the meet was Stanford's and the
serpentine was started by the yell
leaders. According to announcement
of the serpentine leaders the victori
ous march was run in heats.
Mile Him.
This was the first track event of
the day in which points were scored,
though heats in the hundred were run
first. Chapman stepped out and set
the pace from the outset, finishing an
easy first. Skipper Aupperle was con
tent to fall back and run just fast
enough to finish second, which he did
easily. Sullivan of California finished
third. The time was 4:33 2-5.
100-Yard Dash.
House took first, with Lachmund
second and Purnoll of California,
third. Stanford and California both
qualified three men in this event. Both
heats were run in:10 2-5 while the
final was run off in:10 1-5.
220-Yard Dash.
Purnoll of California was just able
to beat "Pretty" Lachmund by a hair
breadth finish. The time in the final
was just the same as both heats,
:23 1-5, Wadsworth winning the first
heat and Lachmund the second one.
440-Yard Dash.
Moody had the pole in this race,
with Rogers in the second lane, Pitts
in the third one, and Dievendorff in
the fourth one. Moody held with the
pole and Rogers was never able to
take the lead. The Californian fin
ished about five feet in front of Rog
ers in:50 3-5. Dievendorff placed
third.
880-Yard Run.
Californians expected Rlanchard to
take the half mile, and he did lead
for the first quarter. Schnell was
running his own race and immediate
ly after negotiating the first turn in
the second quarter ran into the lead,
which he increased from then on to
the tape, finishing about ten yards in
front of the field. Aupperle came
from behind on the home stretch and
cut down what seemed an impossible
lead until he nosed Rlanchard out of
second.
Two Mile Run.
Chapman appeared fo lie lost at the
outset and fell back to the rear. Art
Wilson took the lead in the third lap
after one of the Blue and Gold run
ners had tried for three laps to draw
the Cardinal runners out. Wilson
held this lead for the next three laps,
but Lloyd of California took it and
held it until the finish. Chapman
seemed to revive after running for five
laps, and showed signs of life, cutting
down on the field until he was in
third place. He finally finished a
few feet in front of Wilson, who
placed third.
120-Yard High Hurdles.
As was expected, Grunsky of Cali
fornia took first here with Kiessig

second, and Halsted third. House did
not enter the event. In the heats, the
chief matter of interest was the per
formance of Christie's hurdlers, two
of whom were not even able to high
jumi) the hurdles, and fell down,
broke hurdles and injured themselves.
One man even ran out of the course
! after taking one hurdle, showing that
the entries were there to force House
to run heats.
220 Low Hurdles.
House captured five points here,
with Grunsky second, and Halsted
third. House's time equals the Stan
ford-California record of :24 1-5 held
by Norton. In this event the Cali
fornia hurdlers were able to clear
the sticks in the heats.
Shot L'ut.
Bihlman and Caughey exceeded
Cardinal rooter's expectations in the
shot, and had no trouble in beating
Liversidge, the California man who
holds the American intercollegiate
championship for the event. Caughey
was going better than his teammate
until the last putin the linals when
big "Here" stepped into the circle and
with a mighty heave shoved the
weight 47 feet 8 3-4 inches, establish
ing a new Stanford-California record.
Hammer Throw.
For the first time in four years
Stanford was credited with a point in
the hammer throw, when Miller, the
Cardinal man, succeeded in placing
third against stiff competition. Rich
ardson of California won this event
with a throw of 1(J1 feet 9 inches, his
teammate Gildersleeve capturing sec
ond.
Pole Vault.
"Art" Wilcox came through in fine
shape in the pole vault and took five
points with the bar set at twelve feet.
Greve, the other Cardinal vaulter, tied
with Captain Nichols for second place
and in vaulting off the tie Greve also
made three feet, and took three points
for the locals.
High .lump.
Nichols of California made 6 feet
1 7-8 inches in the high jump, in
jumping off a tie with "Dink" Tem
plcton for first place. Templeton
held him to an even break for trial
after trial, but finally the Blue and
Gold captain went over the bar after
"Dink" had failed. They both had
tied at 6 feet 2 inches. Jackson of
California took third place.
Hroiiri Jump.
California took all the points in the
broad jump and Jackson of the Blue
and Gold team took the record, for
mally held by Dawson of Stanford,
with a jump of 23 feet 8 5-8 inches.
Stirling and Nichols took second and
third, and made it the only event to
go nine points to either team.
Javelin and Discus.
In the exhibition events, California
took both the discus and the javelin.
In the discus Monlux of the Blue and
Gold team took first with a toss of 124
feet. Gillespie and Johnson of the
Cardinal took second and third re
spectively.
All hail Coach Templeton, Captain
Aupperle and the Stanford varsity

two runners, and the way Dievendorff
tore around the oval was a revelation.
Pitts had no chance with the little
Cardinal runner, as Dievendorff was
out to win and so gave Rogers a good
twelve yard lead over Moody. Not to


Itililmau
be outdone, Rogers gave Moody no
chance to gain an inch and finished
the lap as though Moody were run
ning at his shoulder. When this was
over the meet was Stanford's and the
serpentine was started by the yell
leaders. According to announcement
of the serpentine leaders the victori
ous march was run in heats.
Mile Him.
This was the first track event of
the day in which points were scored,
though heats in the hundred were run
first. Chapman stepped out and set
the pace from the outset, finishing an
easy first. Skipper Aupperle was con
tent to fall back and run just fast
enough to finish second, which he did
easily. Sullivan of California finished
third. The time was 4:33 2-5.
100-Yard Dash.
House took first, with Lachmund
second and Purnoll of California,
third. Stanford and California both
qualified three men in this event. Both
heats were run in:10 2-5 while the
final was run off in:10 1-5.
220-Yard Dash.
Purnoll of California was just able
to beat "Pretty" Lachmund by a hair
breadth finish. The time in the final
was just the same as both heats,
:23 1-5, Wadsworth winning the first
heat and Lachmund the second one.
440-Yard Dash.
Moody had the pole in this race,
with Rogers in the second lane, Pitts
in the third one, and Dievendorff in
the fourth one. Moody held with the
pole and Rogers was never able to
take the lead. The Californian fin
ished about five feet in front of Rog
ers in:50 3-5. Dievendorff placed
third.
880-Yard Run.
Californians expected Rlanchard to
take the half mile, and he did lead
for the first quarter. Schnell was
running his own race and immediate
ly after negotiating the first turn in
the second quarter ran into the lead,
which he increased from then on to
the tape, finishing about ten yards in
front of the field. Aupperle came
from behind on the home stretch and
cut down what seemed an impossible
lead until he nosed Rlanchard out of
second.
Two Mile Run.
Chapman appeared fo lie lost at the
outset and fell back to the rear. Art
Wilson took the lead in the third lap
after one of the Blue and Gold run
ners had tried for three laps to draw
the Cardinal runners out. Wilson
held this lead for the next three laps,
but Lloyd of California took it and
held it until the finish. Chapman
seemed to revive after running for five
laps, and showed signs of life, cutting
down on the field until he was in
third place. He finally finished a
few feet in front of Wilson, who
placed third.
120-Yard High Hurdles.
As was expected, Grunsky of Cali
fornia took first here with Kiessig

second, and Halsted third. House did
not enter the event. In the heats, the
chief matter of interest was the per
formance of Christie's hurdlers, two
of whom were not even able to high
jumi) the hurdles, and fell down,
broke hurdles and injured themselves.
One man even ran out of the course
! after taking one hurdle, showing that
the entries were there to force House
to run heats.
220 Low Hurdles.
House captured five points here,
with Grunsky second, and Halsted
third. House's time equals the Stan
ford-California record of :24 1-5 held
by Norton. In this event the Cali
fornia hurdlers were able to clear
the sticks in the heats.
Shot L'ut.
Bihlman and Caughey exceeded
Cardinal rooter's expectations in the
shot, and had no trouble in beating
Liversidge, the California man who
holds the American intercollegiate
championship for the event. Caughey
was going better than his teammate
until the last putin the linals when
big "Here" stepped into the circle and
with a mighty heave shoved the
weight 47 feet 8 3-4 inches, establish
ing a new Stanford-California record.
Hammer Throw.
For the first time in four years
Stanford was credited with a point in
the hammer throw, when Miller, the
Cardinal man, succeeded in placing
third against stiff competition. Rich
ardson of California won this event
with a throw of 1(J1 feet 9 inches, his
teammate Gildersleeve capturing sec
ond.
Pole Vault.
"Art" Wilcox came through in fine
shape in the pole vault and took five
points with the bar set at twelve feet.
Greve, the other Cardinal vaulter, tied
with Captain Nichols for second place
and in vaulting off the tie Greve also
made three feet, and took three points
for the locals.
High .lump.
Nichols of California made 6 feet
1 7-8 inches in the high jump, in
jumping off a tie with "Dink" Tem
plcton for first place. Templeton
held him to an even break for trial
after trial, but finally the Blue and
Gold captain went over the bar after
"Dink" had failed. They both had
tied at 6 feet 2 inches. Jackson of
California took third place.
Hroiiri Jump.
California took all the points in the
broad jump and Jackson of the Blue
and Gold team took the record, for
mally held by Dawson of Stanford,
with a jump of 23 feet 8 5-8 inches.
Stirling and Nichols took second and
third, and made it the only event to
go nine points to either team.
Javelin and Discus.
In the exhibition events, California
took both the discus and the javelin.
In the discus Monlux of the Blue and
Gold team took first with a toss of 124
feet. Gillespie and Johnson of the
Cardinal took second and third re
spectively.
All hail Coach Templeton, Captain
Aupperle and the Stanford varsity
track team. This combination hnng
up another victory over the Califor
nia track team, making the fifth con-

secutive year
that the Cardin
al has waved
triumphant over
the Blue and
Gold in the an
nual track and
field meet. Six
ty-seven to fifty
five was the
final score.
Stanford ath
letes came thru
in wonderful
style, and even
in the field
events where
the Cardinal was
supposed to he
weakest, several
surprises were

sprung. Millor proVided the first bit
of enthusiasm to thr Ft frvd bleach
ers by taking third in the hammer,
thus upsetting the dope that the
Bear's huskies would take nine points
in this event.
Credit Due Aupperle.
Great credit is due Captain Aupper
le for his showing, as the little cap
tain ran just hard enough in the mile
to finish second to .Chapman, saving
himself for the half mile, where he
again captured three more points for
the Cardinal, beating out the speedy
Blanchard and finishing second to
Schnell. This was the best race of
the day.
Quarter a Wonder.
The quarter was one of the feature
events of the day, and the only disap
pointment was that Rogers was forced
to take second to Moody. It appeared
to many that if positions had been
reversed and Rogers had been given
the pole in place of Moody, the result

would have been the opposite. The
relay would seem to bear this out,
as Rogers stepped out in the relay
with a twelve-yard lead, Moody not
gaining an inch on him.
"Jud" House did what was expected
of him by winning the century dash
and the low hurdles, incidentally ty
ing Norton's Stanford-California in
tercollegiate record for the low sticks
of :24 1-5.
"Here" Bihlman broke the existing
Stanford-California record in the shot
put with his last heave, a mighty one
that went for 47 feet 8 3-4 inches.
This betters the record of Rice of
California of 46 feet 7 3-4 inches.
Reg Caughey came second and up to
the final toss of Bihlman was in the
lead with Bihlman second. The much
touted Liversidge was forced to con
tent himself with a third place.
Stanford Fails in Broad.
The broad jump was the only event
of the day in which Stanford failed to
score. Jackson, the Blue and Gold
skipper-elect for next year, set a new
record in this event with a jump of
23 feet 8 5-8 inches.
The relay was thought to decide the
meet, though Greve afterwards jumped
into second place in the pole vault,
giving the three points needed to en
able Stanford to win the meet without
the relay. A better relay eould not
iiave been imagined. Hertel ran the
first lap for Stanford and Jackson for
the Bears. Hertel had the pole, but
Jackson cut in and nearly threw the
| Card on the first run. He came back
and ran neck and neck the entire lap.
Kegley and Kerr had the next lap
and also finished abreast. In the
third round the relay was practically
won. Dievendorff and Pitts were the
two runners, and the way Dievendorff
tore around the oval was a revelation.

jumi) the hurdles, and fell down,
broke hurdles and injured themselves.
One man even ran out of the course
! after taking one hurdle, showing that
the entries were there to force House
to run heats.
220 Low Hurdles.
House captured five points here,
with Grunsky second, and Halsted
third. House's time equals the Stan
ford-California record of :24 1-5 held
by Norton. In this event the Cali
fornia hurdlers were able to clear
the sticks in the heats.
Shot L'ut.
Bihlman and Caughey exceeded
Cardinal rooter's expectations in the
shot, and had no trouble in beating
Liversidge, the California man who
holds the American intercollegiate
championship for the event. Caughey
was going better than his teammate
until the last putin the linals when
big "Here" stepped into the circle and
with a mighty heave shoved the
weight 47 feet 8 3-4 inches, establish
ing a new Stanford-California record.
Hammer Throw.
For the first time in four years
Stanford was credited with a point in
the hammer throw, when Miller, the
Cardinal man, succeeded in placing
third against stiff competition. Rich
ardson of California won this event
with a throw of 1(J1 feet 9 inches, his
teammate Gildersleeve capturing sec
ond.
Pole Vault.
"Art" Wilcox came through in fine
shape in the pole vault and took five
points with the bar set at twelve feet.
Greve, the other Cardinal vaulter, tied
with Captain Nichols for second place
and in vaulting off the tie Greve also
made three feet, and took three points
for the locals.
High .lump.
Nichols of California made 6 feet
1 7-8 inches in the high jump, in
jumping off a tie with "Dink" Tem
plcton for first place. Templeton
held him to an even break for trial
after trial, but finally the Blue and
Gold captain went over the bar after
"Dink" had failed. They both had
tied at 6 feet 2 inches. Jackson of
California took third place.
Hroiiri Jump.
California took all the points in the
broad jump and Jackson of the Blue
and Gold team took the record, for
mally held by Dawson of Stanford,
with a jump of 23 feet 8 5-8 inches.
Stirling and Nichols took second and
third, and made it the only event to
go nine points to either team.
Javelin and Discus.
In the exhibition events, California
took both the discus and the javelin.
In the discus Monlux of the Blue and
Gold team took first with a toss of 124
feet. Gillespie and Johnson of the
Cardinal took second and third re
spectively.
All hail Coach Templeton, Captain
Aupperle and the Stanford varsity
track team. This combination hnng
up another victory over the Califor
nia track team, making the fifth con-

secutive year
that the Cardin
al has waved
triumphant over
the Blue and
Gold in the an
nual track and
field meet. Six
ty-seven to fifty
five was the
final score.
Stanford ath
letes came thru
in wonderful
style, and even
in the field
events where
the Cardinal was
supposed to he
weakest, several
surprises were

sprung. Millor proVided the first bit
of enthusiasm to thr Ft frvd bleach
ers by taking third in the hammer,
thus upsetting the dope that the
Bear's huskies would take nine points
in this event.
Credit Due Aupperle.
Great credit is due Captain Aupper
le for his showing, as the little cap
tain ran just hard enough in the mile
to finish second to .Chapman, saving
himself for the half mile, where he
again captured three more points for
the Cardinal, beating out the speedy
Blanchard and finishing second to
Schnell. This was the best race of
the day.
Quarter a Wonder.
The quarter was one of the feature
events of the day, and the only disap
pointment was that Rogers was forced
to take second to Moody. It appeared
to many that if positions had been
reversed and Rogers had been given
the pole in place of Moody, the result

would have been the opposite. The
relay would seem to bear this out,
as Rogers stepped out in the relay
with a twelve-yard lead, Moody not
gaining an inch on him.
"Jud" House did what was expected
of him by winning the century dash
and the low hurdles, incidentally ty
ing Norton's Stanford-California in
tercollegiate record for the low sticks
of :24 1-5.
"Here" Bihlman broke the existing
Stanford-California record in the shot
put with his last heave, a mighty one
that went for 47 feet 8 3-4 inches.
This betters the record of Rice of
California of 46 feet 7 3-4 inches.
Reg Caughey came second and up to
the final toss of Bihlman was in the
lead with Bihlman second. The much
touted Liversidge was forced to con
tent himself with a third place.
Stanford Fails in Broad.
The broad jump was the only event
of the day in which Stanford failed to
score. Jackson, the Blue and Gold
skipper-elect for next year, set a new
record in this event with a jump of
23 feet 8 5-8 inches.
The relay was thought to decide the
meet, though Greve afterwards jumped
into second place in the pole vault,
giving the three points needed to en
able Stanford to win the meet without
the relay. A better relay eould not
iiave been imagined. Hertel ran the
first lap for Stanford and Jackson for
the Bears. Hertel had the pole, but
Jackson cut in and nearly threw the
| Card on the first run. He came back
and ran neck and neck the entire lap.
Kegley and Kerr had the next lap
and also finished abreast. In the
third round the relay was practically
won. Dievendorff and Pitts were the
two runners, and the way Dievendorff
tore around the oval was a revelation.
Pitts had no chance with the little
Cardinal runner, as Dievendorff was
out to win and so gave Rogers a good
twelve yard lead over Moody. Not to


Itililmau
be outdone, Rogers gave Moody no
chance to gain an inch and finished
the lap as though Moody were run
ning at his shoulder. When this was
over the meet was Stanford's and the
serpentine was started by the yell
leaders. According to announcement
of the serpentine leaders the victori
ous march was run in heats.
Mile Him.
This was the first track event of
the day in which points were scored,
though heats in the hundred were run
first. Chapman stepped out and set
the pace from the outset, finishing an
easy first. Skipper Aupperle was con
tent to fall back and run just fast
enough to finish second, which he did
easily. Sullivan of California finished
third. The time was 4:33 2-5.
100-Yard Dash.
House took first, with Lachmund
second and Purnoll of California,
third. Stanford and California both
qualified three men in this event. Both
heats were run in:10 2-5 while the
final was run off in:10 1-5.
220-Yard Dash.
Purnoll of California was just able
to beat "Pretty" Lachmund by a hair
breadth finish. The time in the final
was just the same as both heats,
:23 1-5, Wadsworth winning the first
heat and Lachmund the second one.
440-Yard Dash.
Moody had the pole in this race,
with Rogers in the second lane, Pitts
in the third one, and Dievendorff in
the fourth one. Moody held with the
pole and Rogers was never able to
take the lead. The Californian fin
ished about five feet in front of Rog
ers in:50 3-5. Dievendorff placed
third.
880-Yard Run.
Californians expected Rlanchard to
take the half mile, and he did lead
for the first quarter. Schnell was
running his own race and immediate
ly after negotiating the first turn in
the second quarter ran into the lead,
which he increased from then on to
the tape, finishing about ten yards in
front of the field. Aupperle came
from behind on the home stretch and
cut down what seemed an impossible
lead until he nosed Rlanchard out of
second.
Two Mile Run.
Chapman appeared fo lie lost at the
outset and fell back to the rear. Art
Wilson took the lead in the third lap
after one of the Blue and Gold run
ners had tried for three laps to draw
the Cardinal runners out. Wilson
held this lead for the next three laps,
but Lloyd of California took it and
held it until the finish. Chapman
seemed to revive after running for five
laps, and showed signs of life, cutting
down on the field until he was in
third place. He finally finished a
few feet in front of Wilson, who
placed third.
120-Yard High Hurdles.
As was expected, Grunsky of Cali
fornia took first here with Kiessig

second, and Halsted third. House did
not enter the event. In the heats, the
chief matter of interest was the per
formance of Christie's hurdlers, two
of whom were not even able to high

of enthusiasm to thr Ft frvd bleach
ers by taking third in the hammer,
thus upsetting the dope that the
Bear's huskies would take nine points
in this event.
Credit Due Aupperle.
Great credit is due Captain Aupper
le for his showing, as the little cap
tain ran just hard enough in the mile
to finish second to .Chapman, saving
himself for the half mile, where he
again captured three more points for
the Cardinal, beating out the speedy
Blanchard and finishing second to
Schnell. This was the best race of
the day.
Quarter a Wonder.
The quarter was one of the feature
events of the day, and the only disap
pointment was that Rogers was forced
to take second to Moody. It appeared
to many that if positions had been
reversed and Rogers had been given
the pole in place of Moody, the result

would have been the opposite. The
relay would seem to bear this out,
as Rogers stepped out in the relay
with a twelve-yard lead, Moody not
gaining an inch on him.
"Jud" House did what was expected
of him by winning the century dash
and the low hurdles, incidentally ty
ing Norton's Stanford-California in
tercollegiate record for the low sticks
of :24 1-5.
"Here" Bihlman broke the existing
Stanford-California record in the shot
put with his last heave, a mighty one
that went for 47 feet 8 3-4 inches.
This betters the record of Rice of
California of 46 feet 7 3-4 inches.
Reg Caughey came second and up to
the final toss of Bihlman was in the
lead with Bihlman second. The much
touted Liversidge was forced to con
tent himself with a third place.
Stanford Fails in Broad.
The broad jump was the only event
of the day in which Stanford failed to
score. Jackson, the Blue and Gold
skipper-elect for next year, set a new
record in this event with a jump of
23 feet 8 5-8 inches.
The relay was thought to decide the
meet, though Greve afterwards jumped
into second place in the pole vault,
giving the three points needed to en
able Stanford to win the meet without
the relay. A better relay eould not
iiave been imagined. Hertel ran the
first lap for Stanford and Jackson for
the Bears. Hertel had the pole, but
Jackson cut in and nearly threw the
| Card on the first run. He came back
and ran neck and neck the entire lap.
Kegley and Kerr had the next lap
and also finished abreast. In the
third round the relay was practically
won. Dievendorff and Pitts were the
two runners, and the way Dievendorff
tore around the oval was a revelation.
Pitts had no chance with the little
Cardinal runner, as Dievendorff was
out to win and so gave Rogers a good
twelve yard lead over Moody. Not to


Itililmau
be outdone, Rogers gave Moody no
chance to gain an inch and finished
the lap as though Moody were run
ning at his shoulder. When this was
over the meet was Stanford's and the
serpentine was started by the yell
leaders. According to announcement
of the serpentine leaders the victori
ous march was run in heats.
Mile Him.
This was the first track event of
the day in which points were scored,
though heats in the hundred were run
first. Chapman stepped out and set
the pace from the outset, finishing an
easy first. Skipper Aupperle was con
tent to fall back and run just fast
enough to finish second, which he did
easily. Sullivan of California finished
third. The time was 4:33 2-5.
100-Yard Dash.
House took first, with Lachmund
second and Purnoll of California,
third. Stanford and California both
qualified three men in this event. Both
heats were run in:10 2-5 while the
final was run off in:10 1-5.
220-Yard Dash.
Purnoll of California was just able
to beat "Pretty" Lachmund by a hair
breadth finish. The time in the final
was just the same as both heats,
:23 1-5, Wadsworth winning the first
heat and Lachmund the second one.
440-Yard Dash.
Moody had the pole in this race,
with Rogers in the second lane, Pitts
in the third one, and Dievendorff in
the fourth one. Moody held with the
pole and Rogers was never able to
take the lead. The Californian fin
ished about five feet in front of Rog
ers in:50 3-5. Dievendorff placed
third.
880-Yard Run.
Californians expected Rlanchard to
take the half mile, and he did lead
for the first quarter. Schnell was
running his own race and immediate
ly after negotiating the first turn in
the second quarter ran into the lead,
which he increased from then on to
the tape, finishing about ten yards in
front of the field. Aupperle came
from behind on the home stretch and
cut down what seemed an impossible
lead until he nosed Rlanchard out of
second.
Two Mile Run.
Chapman appeared fo lie lost at the
outset and fell back to the rear. Art
Wilson took the lead in the third lap
after one of the Blue and Gold run
ners had tried for three laps to draw
the Cardinal runners out. Wilson
held this lead for the next three laps,
but Lloyd of California took it and
held it until the finish. Chapman
seemed to revive after running for five
laps, and showed signs of life, cutting
down on the field until he was in
third place. He finally finished a
few feet in front of Wilson, who
placed third.
120-Yard High Hurdles.
As was expected, Grunsky of Cali
fornia took first here with Kiessig

second, and Halsted third. House did
not enter the event. In the heats, the
chief matter of interest was the per
formance of Christie's hurdlers, two
of whom were not even able to high
jumi) the hurdles, and fell down,
broke hurdles and injured themselves.
One man even ran out of the course
! after taking one hurdle, showing that
the entries were there to force House
to run heats.
220 Low Hurdles.
House captured five points here,
with Grunsky second, and Halsted
third. House's time equals the Stan
ford-California record of :24 1-5 held
by Norton. In this event the Cali
fornia hurdlers were able to clear
the sticks in the heats.
Shot L'ut.
Bihlman and Caughey exceeded
Cardinal rooter's expectations in the
shot, and had no trouble in beating
Liversidge, the California man who
holds the American intercollegiate
championship for the event. Caughey
was going better than his teammate
until the last putin the linals when
big "Here" stepped into the circle and
with a mighty heave shoved the
weight 47 feet 8 3-4 inches, establish
ing a new Stanford-California record.
Hammer Throw.
For the first time in four years
Stanford was credited with a point in
the hammer throw, when Miller, the
Cardinal man, succeeded in placing
third against stiff competition. Rich
ardson of California won this event
with a throw of 1(J1 feet 9 inches, his
teammate Gildersleeve capturing sec
ond.
Pole Vault.
"Art" Wilcox came through in fine
shape in the pole vault and took five
points with the bar set at twelve feet.
Greve, the other Cardinal vaulter, tied
with Captain Nichols for second place
and in vaulting off the tie Greve also
made three feet, and took three points
for the locals.
High .lump.
Nichols of California made 6 feet
1 7-8 inches in the high jump, in
jumping off a tie with "Dink" Tem
plcton for first place. Templeton
held him to an even break for trial
after trial, but finally the Blue and
Gold captain went over the bar after
"Dink" had failed. They both had
tied at 6 feet 2 inches. Jackson of
California took third place.
Hroiiri Jump.
California took all the points in the
broad jump and Jackson of the Blue
and Gold team took the record, for
mally held by Dawson of Stanford,
with a jump of 23 feet 8 5-8 inches.
Stirling and Nichols took second and
third, and made it the only event to
go nine points to either team.
Javelin and Discus.
In the exhibition events, California
took both the discus and the javelin.
In the discus Monlux of the Blue and
Gold team took first with a toss of 124
feet. Gillespie and Johnson of the
Cardinal took second and third re
spectively.
All hail Coach Templeton, Captain
Aupperle and the Stanford varsity
track team. This combination hnng
up another victory over the Califor
nia track team, making the fifth con-

secutive year
that the Cardin
al has waved
triumphant over
the Blue and
Gold in the an
nual track and
field meet. Six
ty-seven to fifty
five was the
final score.
Stanford ath
letes came thru
in wonderful
style, and even
in the field
events where
the Cardinal was
supposed to he
weakest, several
surprises were

sprung. Millor proVided the first bit

easy first. Skipper Aupperle was con
tent to fall back and run just fast
enough to finish second, which he did
easily. Sullivan of California finished
third. The time was 4:33 2-5.
100-Yard Dash.
House took first, with Lachmund
second and Purnoll of California,
third. Stanford and California both
qualified three men in this event. Both
heats were run in:10 2-5 while the
final was run off in:10 1-5.
220-Yard Dash.
Purnoll of California was just able
to beat "Pretty" Lachmund by a hair
breadth finish. The time in the final
was just the same as both heats,
:23 1-5, Wadsworth winning the first
heat and Lachmund the second one.
440-Yard Dash.
Moody had the pole in this race,
with Rogers in the second lane, Pitts
in the third one, and Dievendorff in
the fourth one. Moody held with the
pole and Rogers was never able to
take the lead. The Californian fin
ished about five feet in front of Rog
ers in:50 3-5. Dievendorff placed
third.
880-Yard Run.
Californians expected Rlanchard to
take the half mile, and he did lead
for the first quarter. Schnell was
running his own race and immediate
ly after negotiating the first turn in
the second quarter ran into the lead,
which he increased from then on to
the tape, finishing about ten yards in
front of the field. Aupperle came
from behind on the home stretch and
cut down what seemed an impossible
lead until he nosed Rlanchard out of
second.
Two Mile Run.
Chapman appeared fo lie lost at the
outset and fell back to the rear. Art
Wilson took the lead in the third lap
after one of the Blue and Gold run
ners had tried for three laps to draw
the Cardinal runners out. Wilson
held this lead for the next three laps,
but Lloyd of California took it and
held it until the finish. Chapman
seemed to revive after running for five
laps, and showed signs of life, cutting
down on the field until he was in
third place. He finally finished a
few feet in front of Wilson, who
placed third.
120-Yard High Hurdles.
As was expected, Grunsky of Cali
fornia took first here with Kiessig

second, and Halsted third. House did
not enter the event. In the heats, the
chief matter of interest was the per
formance of Christie's hurdlers, two
of whom were not even able to high
jumi) the hurdles, and fell down,
broke hurdles and injured themselves.
One man even ran out of the course
! after taking one hurdle, showing that
the entries were there to force House
to run heats.
220 Low Hurdles.
House captured five points here,
with Grunsky second, and Halsted
third. House's time equals the Stan
ford-California record of :24 1-5 held
by Norton. In this event the Cali
fornia hurdlers were able to clear
the sticks in the heats.
Shot L'ut.
Bihlman and Caughey exceeded
Cardinal rooter's expectations in the
shot, and had no trouble in beating
Liversidge, the California man who
holds the American intercollegiate
championship for the event. Caughey
was going better than his teammate
until the last putin the linals when
big "Here" stepped into the circle and
with a mighty heave shoved the
weight 47 feet 8 3-4 inches, establish
ing a new Stanford-California record.
Hammer Throw.
For the first time in four years
Stanford was credited with a point in
the hammer throw, when Miller, the
Cardinal man, succeeded in placing
third against stiff competition. Rich
ardson of California won this event
with a throw of 1(J1 feet 9 inches, his
teammate Gildersleeve capturing sec
ond.
Pole Vault.
"Art" Wilcox came through in fine
shape in the pole vault and took five
points with the bar set at twelve feet.
Greve, the other Cardinal vaulter, tied
with Captain Nichols for second place
and in vaulting off the tie Greve also
made three feet, and took three points
for the locals.
High .lump.
Nichols of California made 6 feet
1 7-8 inches in the high jump, in
jumping off a tie with "Dink" Tem
plcton for first place. Templeton
held him to an even break for trial
after trial, but finally the Blue and
Gold captain went over the bar after
"Dink" had failed. They both had
tied at 6 feet 2 inches. Jackson of
California took third place.
Hroiiri Jump.
California took all the points in the
broad jump and Jackson of the Blue
and Gold team took the record, for
mally held by Dawson of Stanford,
with a jump of 23 feet 8 5-8 inches.
Stirling and Nichols took second and
third, and made it the only event to
go nine points to either team.
Javelin and Discus.
In the exhibition events, California
took both the discus and the javelin.
In the discus Monlux of the Blue and
Gold team took first with a toss of 124
feet. Gillespie and Johnson of the
Cardinal took second and third re
spectively.
All hail Coach Templeton, Captain
Aupperle and the Stanford varsity
track team. This combination hnng
up another victory over the Califor
nia track team, making the fifth con-

secutive year
that the Cardin
al has waved
triumphant over
the Blue and
Gold in the an
nual track and
field meet. Six
ty-seven to fifty
five was the
final score.
Stanford ath
letes came thru
in wonderful
style, and even
in the field
events where
the Cardinal was
supposed to he
weakest, several
surprises were

sprung. Millor proVided the first bit
of enthusiasm to thr Ft frvd bleach
ers by taking third in the hammer,
thus upsetting the dope that the
Bear's huskies would take nine points
in this event.
Credit Due Aupperle.
Great credit is due Captain Aupper
le for his showing, as the little cap
tain ran just hard enough in the mile
to finish second to .Chapman, saving
himself for the half mile, where he
again captured three more points for
the Cardinal, beating out the speedy
Blanchard and finishing second to
Schnell. This was the best race of
the day.
Quarter a Wonder.
The quarter was one of the feature
events of the day, and the only disap
pointment was that Rogers was forced
to take second to Moody. It appeared
to many that if positions had been
reversed and Rogers had been given
the pole in place of Moody, the result

would have been the opposite. The
relay would seem to bear this out,
as Rogers stepped out in the relay
with a twelve-yard lead, Moody not
gaining an inch on him.
"Jud" House did what was expected
of him by winning the century dash
and the low hurdles, incidentally ty
ing Norton's Stanford-California in
tercollegiate record for the low sticks
of :24 1-5.
"Here" Bihlman broke the existing
Stanford-California record in the shot
put with his last heave, a mighty one
that went for 47 feet 8 3-4 inches.
This betters the record of Rice of
California of 46 feet 7 3-4 inches.
Reg Caughey came second and up to
the final toss of Bihlman was in the
lead with Bihlman second. The much
touted Liversidge was forced to con
tent himself with a third place.
Stanford Fails in Broad.
The broad jump was the only event
of the day in which Stanford failed to
score. Jackson, the Blue and Gold
skipper-elect for next year, set a new
record in this event with a jump of
23 feet 8 5-8 inches.
The relay was thought to decide the
meet, though Greve afterwards jumped
into second place in the pole vault,
giving the three points needed to en
able Stanford to win the meet without
the relay. A better relay eould not
iiave been imagined. Hertel ran the
first lap for Stanford and Jackson for
the Bears. Hertel had the pole, but
Jackson cut in and nearly threw the
| Card on the first run. He came back
and ran neck and neck the entire lap.
Kegley and Kerr had the next lap
and also finished abreast. In the
third round the relay was practically
won. Dievendorff and Pitts were the
two runners, and the way Dievendorff
tore around the oval was a revelation.
Pitts had no chance with the little
Cardinal runner, as Dievendorff was
out to win and so gave Rogers a good
twelve yard lead over Moody. Not to


Itililmau
be outdone, Rogers gave Moody no
chance to gain an inch and finished
the lap as though Moody were run
ning at his shoulder. When this was
over the meet was Stanford's and the
serpentine was started by the yell
leaders. According to announcement
of the serpentine leaders the victori
ous march was run in heats.
Mile Him.
This was the first track event of
the day in which points were scored,
though heats in the hundred were run
first. Chapman stepped out and set
the pace from the outset, finishing an
easy first. Skipper Aupperle was con
tent to fall back and run just fast
enough to finish second, which he did
easily. Sullivan of California finished
third. The time was 4:33 2-5.
100-Yard Dash.
House took first, with Lachmund
second and Purnoll of California,
third. Stanford and California both
qualified three men in this event. Both
heats were run in:10 2-5 while the
final was run off in:10 1-5.
220-Yard Dash.
Purnoll of California was just able
to beat "Pretty" Lachmund by a hair

was just the same as both heats,

heat and Lachmund the second one.
440-Yard Dash.
Moody had the pole in this race,
with Rogers in the second lane, Pitts
