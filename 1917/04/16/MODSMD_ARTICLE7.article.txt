# STANFORD TEAM COMES THROUGH
## California Humbled by 67 to 55 Score--Dope Is Upset University Honors Coach Templeton and Captain Aupperle for Well Balanced Squad That Took Measure of Mighty Bears 
### Landis O. Weaver 
All hail Coach Templeton, Captain
Aupperle and the Stanford varsity
track team. This combination hnng
up another victory over the Califor
nia track team, making the fifth con-

secutive year
that the Cardin
al has waved
triumphant over
the Blue and
Gold in the an
nual track and
field meet. Six
ty-seven to fifty
five was the
final score.
Stanford ath
letes came thru
in wonderful
style, and even
in the field
events where
the Cardinal was
supposed to he
weakest, several
surprises were

sprung. Millor proVided the first bit
of enthusiasm to thr Ft frvd bleach
ers by taking third in the hammer,
thus upsetting the dope that the
Bear's huskies would take nine points
in this event.
Credit Due Aupperle.
Great credit is due Captain Aupper
le for his showing, as the little cap
tain ran just hard enough in the mile
to finish second to .Chapman, saving
himself for the half mile, where he
again captured three more points for
the Cardinal, beating out the speedy
Blanchard and finishing second to
Schnell. This was the best race of
the day.
Quarter a Wonder.
The quarter was one of the feature
events of the day, and the only disap
pointment was that Rogers was forced
to take second to Moody. It appeared
to many that if positions had been
reversed and Rogers had been given
the pole in place of Moody, the result

would have been the opposite. The
relay would seem to bear this out,
as Rogers stepped out in the relay
with a twelve-yard lead, Moody not
gaining an inch on him.
"Jud" House did what was expected
of him by winning the century dash
and the low hurdles, incidentally ty
ing Norton's Stanford-California in
tercollegiate record for the low sticks
of :24 1-5.
"Here" Bihlman broke the existing
Stanford-California record in the shot
put with his last heave, a mighty one
that went for 47 feet 8 3-4 inches.
This betters the record of Rice of
California of 46 feet 7 3-4 inches.
Reg Caughey came second and up to
the final toss of Bihlman was in the
lead with Bihlman second. The much
touted Liversidge was forced to con
tent himself with a third place.
Stanford Fails in Broad.
The broad jump was the only event
of the day in which Stanford failed to
score. Jackson, the Blue and Gold
skipper-elect for next year, set a new
record in this event with a jump of
23 feet 8 5-8 inches.
The relay was thought to decide the
meet, though Greve afterwards jumped
into second place in the pole vault,
giving the three points needed to en
able Stanford to win the meet without
the relay. A better relay eould not
iiave been imagined. Hertel ran the
first lap for Stanford and Jackson for
the Bears. Hertel had the pole, but
Jackson cut in and nearly threw the
| Card on the first run. He came back
and ran neck and neck the entire lap.
Kegley and Kerr had the next lap
and also finished abreast. In the
third round the relay was practically
won. Dievendorff and Pitts were the
two runners, and the way Dievendorff
tore around the oval was a revelation.
Pitts had no chance with the little
Cardinal runner, as Dievendorff was
out to win and so gave Rogers a good
twelve yard lead over Moody. Not to
