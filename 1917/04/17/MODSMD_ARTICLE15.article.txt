## Will Be First Expression of Student Writers Since the Declaration 
### 
First among Stanford periodicals
to make its appearance after the re
cent "making over" of the University
to fit new conditions is the Illustrat
ed Review, the snappy April number
of which is to come off the presses
tonight.
With the martial fever in the air
the Review has made its issue timely.
Two important articles deal directly
with some phase of the all-vital ques
tion. "Fitting Yourself into the
War," by F. J. Taylor, 'IS, and "Up
in the Air with Unclc Sam," by R. S.
Lytic, '17. speak for themselves both
in title and in subject matter.
To Paris and tlie Front.
Two articles of a rare type tonch
indirectly upon the subject of war.
"England's Pinch Hitter," by Harry
W. Frantz, 'IS, is the story of Lloyd
George, the man of the hour in Brit
ain today.
"To Paris and the Front" is by far
the most, interesting account relating
the experience of the Stanford Am
bulance Corps that, has reached the
campus. Carl A. Randan. ex-'l9, re
lates the story of three weeks in Par
is and the start for the line of battle.
A photograph of the Stanford corps
with the Pellissier Memorial Ambu
lance was rushed to the Review for
the April number.
"Are You a Prude?" is the title
chosen by H. S. Marshutz, '17, for a
feature that seems to answer the
question for Stanford in the affirma
tive. There is stuff under the title
that will open many eyes.
C. J. Ranrlau, '18, president of the
Stanford Economics Club, has writ
ten an article that will arouse needed
interest in the question of bridging
the gap between an A.B. degree and
8 to 5 office hours—the gap that Ran
dau makes clear is caused by an im
practical department of Economics.
