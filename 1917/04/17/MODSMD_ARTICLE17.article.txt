# "BOOTS"
## 
### 
An alumnus, returning for a visit to Stanford, would indeed have a
hard time recognizing his alma mater under present conditions. In place
01 classes —for most of us—, in place of preparations for Senior Week fes
tivities, in place of all that is usual for a Stanford spring, we have drill,
and some more drill, and talk of drill. If a man talks in his sleep, he is
sure to be putting some one through the manual of arms. In his waking
hours, it is difficult to get him to discuss anything but "army." Surely
most of us by this time have a fuller appreciation of Kipling for having
written "Boots."
We believe the impression that students were taking this training as a
short cut to secure their hours must surely be dispelled by this time. It
is not likely that the business would be taken so seriously nor that so
much progress would be made by men who regarded it as the lesser of two
evils. It seems to us that the recruits are actuated by a sincere interest
and a desire to learn as much as possible in case they are called by their
country.
Whatever comes of it all, the spring of 1917 will long be remembered
as one unique in the history of Stanford University.
