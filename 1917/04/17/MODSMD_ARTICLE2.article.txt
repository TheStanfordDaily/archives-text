# No Red Cross Class for Stanford "500"
## Dean Makes Report After an Inquiry Into "Co-Ed" Preparedness Possibilities 
### 
Extra classes in Red Cross work
for women who signed up during the
last week will not be held. There is
not sufficient time to complete a
course during the time remaining he
fore finals. The scarcity in instruc
tors is also another reason for no
classes. There are already enough
persons ih the vicinity signed up to
fill three classes. There arc no peo
ple who can take charge. There is a
demand for instructors all over the
country.
Miss Harriet Bradford, dean of
women has visited the Marconi wire
less school in San Francisco to find
out whether it would be advisable to
start classes at Stanford. According
to the instructors there, the main
work is in learning the code. This
can easily be obtained from the
school in San Francisco by persons
interested. The Marconi people will
help in purchasing instruments if de
sired. But like the Red Cross work,
there is hardly time to accomplish
much during the remainder of the
year.
As to the automobile mechanics,
another phase of work which the
women wished to take up, there is
absolutely no chance for any instruc
tion. Whether there will be classes
next semester along this line has not
been decided.
