# Colleges Hysterical Charges Naval Head
## Naval Academy Commander Lauds Action of Pennsylvania to Continue Sports 
### 
Declaring that the present agitation
of a number of colleges in canceling
all athletic activities is well-meant
but misdirected enthusiasm, was the
gist of a letter addressed to Major
Maylin J. Pickering, graduate man
ager of athletics at the University of
Pennsylvania, from Lieutenant Com
mander P. V. McNear of Annapolis
Naval Academy. The object of the
letter was to commend the action
taken by the graduate manager in de
nouncing the policy of those univer-
I sities which abolished athletics for
the remainder of the semester.
The letter continues to show how
the official military and naval acad
emies of the country, West Point and
; Annapolis, supposedly the first affect
jed by a war danger, are continuing
j their athletic activities, despite the
loss of the senior classes and the ath
i letic managers. The athletic sched
j tile in these institutions will be con
tinued unless orders are received
from Washington, ordering their
abatement. Athletic training is of
i military value, it is urged, as is
evinced by the activity of the British
soldiers behind the line in Flanders,
in playing football.
Interesting along this line is the
i opinion of Major General Leonard
Wood, in regard to the value of ath
letics as an aid to national prepared
ness. The general is a firm believer
in athletics and criticises the system
only in that athletics in the univer
sities do not go far enough, nor do
they embrace enough participants.
"Athletic training," said General
Wood, "is naturally a part of mili
tary training, and they go hand in
hand."
The Pennsylvania Relay Carnival is
the one big athletic event of the east
which is not to be abandoned, and
will be held, as per schedule, on
April 27 and 29 at Philadelphia. Alon
zo Stagg, coach of the University of
Chicago track team, stated in a letter
to the management of the relay car
nival that he could not understand
the attitude of the big eastern uni
versities in cancelling their athletic
schedules, when athletics have prov
en to be of such value as an aid to
military training. He characterized
the action of these universities as be
ing prompted by a kind of hysteria.
