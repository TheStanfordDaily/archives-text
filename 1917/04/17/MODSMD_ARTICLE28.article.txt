# Stanford Band Gives Way to Intensive Militarism
## 
### 
Stanford University Military Hand
has ceased to exist under the old re
gime, due to the fact that intensive
military training has engaged most of
its members. Members voted to dis
continue at a recent meeting. A new
regimental band has been organized
to cooperate with the Reserve Offi
cers Training Corps. Twenty-nine
men have joined the new band to
date, and more are expected later.
Professor E. W. Martin, who was di
rector of the old band, will conduct
the new organization, which will
hold special practise as well as en
gaging in company drill with the
other "rookies." The new band will
continue operations until May 10,
when it will lie disbanded, and a com
plete reorganization will take place
next quarter.
Dismissal of the Stanford Band has
necessitated the cancellation of the
trip to Southern California, which
was scheduled for the week following
the close of the semester. War con
ditions have also wrecked the hopes
for a summer's trip to Japan.
Manager F. M. Croneriwett, '17, of
the band, will be in the old band
room on Tuesdays and Thursdays
from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. to receive all
instruments, coats, caps and other
hand properties from band members,
lie urges that these be turned in im
mediately.
