Maidens of Stanford will not re
gret the callouses . and blisters
acquired in learning to sweep,
cook, sew, and other menial la
bors they* perform, when the gov
ernment calls upon them as their
mothers did of old.
To ascertain the accomplish
ments in all branches of work,
the women of Stanford were giv
en questionnaires, upon which
each transcribed her own talents
and made her suggestions, at
house meetings last night.
The campaign is being man
aged by Miss Edith Harvey, '17.
Representatives have been ap
pointed from all the living groups
of women, to take active charge
in individual groups.
The questionnaires are as fol
lows :
State any occupation or branch
of service in which you have had
training or experience.
In view of the present crisis,
for what vocation do you prefer
to fit yourself? State how the
University could ielp prepare you
for your vocation.
How can you yourself
to the problem of increasing the
nation's food supply?
