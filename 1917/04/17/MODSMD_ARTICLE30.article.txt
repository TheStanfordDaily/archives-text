## 
### 
Just one month ago yesterday the
Pellissier Memorial Ambulance and
Stanford Corps of the American Am
bulance in France left Paris for the
front after a three-week sojourn. A
letter from A. Piatt Andrews, Chief
Inspector of the American Ambu
lance, to Professor O. M. Johnston,
of the department of Romantic Lan
guages tolls of the departure. The
letter follows:
"Dear Mr. Johnston â€”It will prob
ably interest you to know that the car
number 478 which the members and
friends of Stanford University have
so generously made possible for our
Field Service, left today for the front
with a new section, number 14, com
posed of the men from Leland Stan
ford University in California.
"Sincerely yours,
"A. PIATT ANDREWS."
.1. H. Eastman, '18, is driving the
Pellissier Ambulance.
