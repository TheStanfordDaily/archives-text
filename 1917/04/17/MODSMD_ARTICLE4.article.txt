## 
### 
Mrs. H. C. Hoover, '98, will speak
011 the "Condition of England /and
Belgium due to the War" at the
Thursday Assembly at 11 o'clock.
Mrs. Hoover, who has recently re
turned from London, has been active
in raising funds in the east for Bel
gian Relief.
She has been as ardent a worker in
Belgium as she has been in collect
ing money for the destitute Belgians.
There is perhaps no one as capable
to present the subject as she, for the
last two years and a half she has de
voted her entire time in aiding her
husband in the Belgian relief work
of which he was head. *
Mr. Hoover has since the war ac
cepted the chairmanship of the new
Food Board of the United States. He
is expected to return from London
shortly to take over his duties. He
predicts that the war will last a year
longer.
