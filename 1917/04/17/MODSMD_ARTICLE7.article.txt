## WILL LEAVE IN MAY Second Stanford Ambulance Unit Will Be Organized for Immediate Service 
### 
Thirty men are now signed up for i
the second Stanford unit in the Araer- i
ican Ambulance service in France, j
It is the plan to send the second unit
across the Atlantic about the end of
May.
All other men who wish to enter
the ambulance service are to report
to C. J. Randau at once and arrange \
for references and funds. Each man l
entering the service pays a part of !
liia transportation expenses to France, i
though by far the larger amount of
the money needed to send the men to
Paris is furnished through the aus
pices of the Friends of France Society
in San Francisco.
Letter From Front.
Letters received today from France
give accounts of the twenty Stanford |
men already in the service who were j
initiated into the thrills of battle be- j
hind the French lines. They serve
from the back of the lines where the
first aid stations are located to the
base hospitals still further to the rear.
The Stanford men are enthusiastic
regarding their work.
Enlistment in the service is for six
months, after which the majority of
the Americans re-enlist for three
month periods of service. Over forty
thousand wounded have been carried
by the American Ambulance men
since the war began, according to
statistics.
Arrangements have been made with j
a large San Francisco concern to j
train men in the use of Fords and '
in repairing them, before they em
bark for the French front. This will
enable many men not familiar with
machines to prepare for ambulance
driving.
Secretary of War Newton D. Baker
has officially given his approval to
the American Ambulance Service in
the following telegram to Henry
Sleeper, who is in charge of the ser
vice in the east:
"Confirming our conversation of
this morning I beg leave to say to
you as the representative of the
American Ambulance Field Service
that the war department looks with
appreciation and approval upon the
splendid service being rendered by
American citizcns in France. These
young men are serving their own
country in the highest way by their
courageous contribution to the efli
| eiency of the armies of those asso
ciated with us in this war.
"I perhaps have no right to urge
they remain in France now that the
United States has entered upon active
military preparation in the conflict;
i but at least for the present a sub
stantial number of these young men
will not be needed here, and the train-
I ing they receive while a mere inci
dent to the service they are rendering
will qualify them to be of especial
value in the American army at a later
time."

months, after which the majority of
the Americans re-enlist for three
month periods of service. Over forty
thousand wounded have been carried
by the American Ambulance men
since the war began, according to
statistics.
Arrangements have been made with j
a large San Francisco concern to j
train men in the use of Fords and '
in repairing them, before they em
bark for the French front. This will
enable many men not familiar with
machines to prepare for ambulance
driving.
Secretary of War Newton D. Baker
has officially given his approval to
the American Ambulance Service in
the following telegram to Henry
Sleeper, who is in charge of the ser
vice in the east:
"Confirming our conversation of
this morning I beg leave to say to
you as the representative of the
American Ambulance Field Service
that the war department looks with
appreciation and approval upon the
splendid service being rendered by
American citizcns in France. These
young men are serving their own
country in the highest way by their
courageous contribution to the efli
| eiency of the armies of those asso
ciated with us in this war.
"I perhaps have no right to urge
they remain in France now that the
United States has entered upon active
military preparation in the conflict;
i but at least for the present a sub
stantial number of these young men
will not be needed here, and the train-
I ing they receive while a mere inci
dent to the service they are rendering
will qualify them to be of especial
value in the American army at a later
time."
Thirty men are now signed up for i
the second Stanford unit in the Araer- i
ican Ambulance service in France, j
It is the plan to send the second unit
across the Atlantic about the end of
May.
All other men who wish to enter
the ambulance service are to report
to C. J. Randau at once and arrange \
for references and funds. Each man l
entering the service pays a part of !
liia transportation expenses to France, i
though by far the larger amount of
the money needed to send the men to
Paris is furnished through the aus
pices of the Friends of France Society
in San Francisco.
Letter From Front.
Letters received today from France
give accounts of the twenty Stanford |
men already in the service who were j
initiated into the thrills of battle be- j
hind the French lines. They serve
from the back of the lines where the
first aid stations are located to the
base hospitals still further to the rear.
The Stanford men are enthusiastic
regarding their work.
Enlistment in the service is for six
months, after which the majority of
the Americans re-enlist for three
month periods of service. Over forty
thousand wounded have been carried
by the American Ambulance men
