### 
Actual war conditions will be given
the students in the intensive training
course today when the first "hike"
into the hills will be taken to drill
on the conditions of field service.
The men will leave the campus at
eight o'clock this morning and will
not return until four-thirty. Lunches
will be taken.
List of Work Issued.
Major Bugge last night gave out
the list of new work that will be tak
en up on the march today. This in
cludes the principles of the outpost
and the patrol, the service of security
including rear guard, advance guard,
the point and all points connected
with these. The place for the drill
will be near Frenchman's Lake.
In order to complete the course for
the men originally enlisted in the Re
serve Officers' Training Corps the old
companies A, B, C and D will be or
ganized into a battalion under their
original officers. The new companies
will be in charge of officers selected
from the men who have shown the
most promise so far.
Old Men Drill Together.
The old companies will be given
the work for the day and will then
be in shape to drill the new men. Ma
jor Bugge announced last night that
all the old men should report to their
old companies instead of to their new
organizations.
Moving pictures were taken last
night of the companies in the second
battalion of the regiment commanded
by Major R. A. Griffin, '17. The or
ganizations which had rifles were put
through the manual of arms, and then
the battalion marched before the
camera to demonstrate its perfect
ness after hut five days of drill. Tn
addition several pictures were taken
of prominent athletes of the Univer
sity who are signed up for the inten
sive training.
Target Practise Held.
Two companies of the first battal
ion commanded by Sergeant Bates,
U. S. A., were given target practice
on the range yesterday afternoon.
This battalion which is composed of
men who have been in training before
has advanced so far that Major
Bugge allowed them to vary the or
der of drill. The two organizations
under Captain Lytle and Captain
Skelton were the only two who were
able to shoot yesterday, however.
Captain Woods' company will go on
the range to shoot in the near future.
Since the outdoor range is not
ready for use the target practice yes
terday was in the indoor range under
the anatomy building.
Field work will be continued
Thursday on a second hike. On Fri
day, however, after several hours of
battalion and close order company
drill tiie first inspection and review
will be held.
The first lecture of the course will
be given tonight. Another talk will
be given Thursday. Attendance at
these lectures is compulsory.
