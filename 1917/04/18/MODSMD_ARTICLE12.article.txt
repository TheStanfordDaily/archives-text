# AFTER THE LION'S ROAR
## 
### 
There's no good reason why every punch of the editorial typewriter
should mean that somebody has to squirm. It's all right to let the lions
roar, part of the time, but here's where the pussy purrs. Things are get
ting more satisfying.
Thus we begin to dabble in the war situation —it's popular business
now. There was a time a week or so ago when nobody loved a student.
A lot of good men entered intensive training not because they loved their
training less but because they loved their hours more. Which is all right,
after all.
Then came a time when the soldier boys with their hours secure
looked down on the "student" body, and "razzed" heartily the brave men
who strode down the Quad with the women, the professors, and sight
seers. It looked as though the malestudent would become an extinct bi
ped on the Stanford farm. Those were the days of intolerance.
Times are changing, though. Hard work, lots of walking, in the dust
and in the rain, makes us see that there is more than one way of pre
paring to help the old ship of state in time of war. One way may be
through sticking by the classes, be they ever so humble.
The country needs more than warriors—it's not ours to criticise those
who unearth some professional way of boosting the country's stock of
preparedness. Thus it's with much glee we hail the disappearance of
sheer sentiment and noise, and welcome the advent of a sound sense and
charity brand of patriotism. —Contributed.
