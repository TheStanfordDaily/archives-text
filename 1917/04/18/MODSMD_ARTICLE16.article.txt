Rhymes of u Rookie.
Fiends of promptness, aren't they?
Those men who lead the march;
Heartless drivers, aren't they?
Those men who lead the march!
They stand around a-loalin',
Not knowin' what it is
To march like all of fury
And Satan's own Gee Whizz!
They stand around like statues
A-smokin' as they choose
While rookies in the columns
Would give two dollars for a snooze.
And after miles of walkin'—
It seems like all up hill—
They holler out a recess
So they can roll a pill
And think up new fandangoes
For the rookies in the lines,
Who have a mornin'-after feelin'
All up and down their spines.
Eagle-eyed and hawk-eyed—
Those men who lead the march—
With a callin' down all ready
When your neck runs out of starch;
And a corp'ral there to wop you
And to whip you into shape
If you lose out on the runnin' form
Before you cross the tape.
SHRAPNEL.
The rookie who argued that the in

What's an epaulet?" he asked.
"It's something a soldier carries on

I "It's nothing like an epithet—"
"Which is something," she inter

j your tongue."
No man in the ranks should have

All up and down their spines.
Eagle-eyed and hawk-eyed—
Those men who lead the march—
With a callin' down all ready
When your neck runs out of starch;
And a corp'ral there to wop you
And to whip you into shape
If you lose out on the runnin' form
Before you cross the tape.
SHRAPNEL.
The rookie who argued that the in
tensive training grounds was not a
concentration camp found himself
sadly off. He found that "concentra
tion" is on the first line of the first
page of the first primer for recruits.
He didn't concentrate and conse-
I quently was nominated, elected and
re-elected —all unanimously—to the
super-extra-awkward squad.
ADVANCE HIM, MAJOR!
There is at least one man in line
for promotion. He painted his shoes
green so he wouldn't be spotted if he
jumped the gun.
HE SWORE OFF!

Rhymes of u Rookie.
Fiends of promptness, aren't they?
Those men who lead the march;
Heartless drivers, aren't they?
Those men who lead the march!
They stand around a-loalin',
Not knowin' what it is
To march like all of fury
And Satan's own Gee Whizz!
They stand around like statues
A-smokin' as they choose
While rookies in the columns
Would give two dollars for a snooze.
And after miles of walkin'—
It seems like all up hill—
They holler out a recess
So they can roll a pill
And think up new fandangoes
For the rookies in the lines,
Who have a mornin'-after feelin'
All up and down their spines.
Eagle-eyed and hawk-eyed—
Those men who lead the march—
With a callin' down all ready
When your neck runs out of starch;
And a corp'ral there to wop you
And to whip you into shape
If you lose out on the runnin' form
Before you cross the tape.
