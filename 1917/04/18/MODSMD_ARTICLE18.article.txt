# COLUMBIA TRYING TO REMOVE PACIFIST STIGMA
## 
### 
Columbia has been trying hard to
remove the stigma that was cast on
the university by a few rabid pacifists
among the faculty. A certain efficient
group of these individuals have been
severely criticised by the press
throughout the country for teaching
anti-patriotic doctrines. Now another
group of professors has taken up the
cudgels against their associates and
by telegrams have formed enthusias
tic delegations who have journeyed
to Washington to boost preparedness.
Also, Columbia's student body have
taken up military training with a
vengeance to show their patriotism,
about which many Eastern papers
have been quizzical.
