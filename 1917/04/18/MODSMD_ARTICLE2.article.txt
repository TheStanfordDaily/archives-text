## 
### 
In one sense of the word today's
jaunt for members of the intensive
training corps will be a picnic. Tn
another sense it will be miles from it.
Picnics are usually marked by a long
journey thither, a scramble for a lo
cation, and several hours' work get
ting up an appetite, a bite of lunch
and some blissful moments of rest,
with good reading matter to aid. In
this respect will today's exodus re
semble a picnic.
But because the manual labor and
the rests will come not at the will of
the parties of the first part, the mili
tary trek will be something more
than an excursion.
Today's novelty will be the reading
matter during the noon recess. The
April Illustrated Review is to be on
sale at the gym this morning and in
time for every private, corporal, ser
geant, lieutenant, captain and even
the "higher-ups" to tuck a copy in
their pocket, ready for the opportu
nity to look at the pictures and read
timely articles. Admission will be 15
cents, according to the Review man
agement.
