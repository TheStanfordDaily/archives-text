# Palo Alto Club to Plant Vacant Lots
## University Town to Help in Production of Nation's Food Supply 
### 
As the result of a movement started
recently in Palo Alto to farm vacant
lots in the city because of the food
shortage, a definite organization has
been formed. The new organization
will be known as the Palo Alto Gar
den Club.
This is one step in the general pre
paredness movement that is going on
over the United States and has the
cooperation of many national organi
zations. In Palo Alto the Garden
Club already has the cooperation of
the Palo Alto Civic League, the Par
ent-Tcachers Association, besides the
endorsement of the Chamber of Com
merce and the city officials.
The two most important questions
in lot farming are the supply of water
and the cultivation of the soil. City
Engineer J. F. Byxbee has stated that
he believes the local board of works
will grant a flat rate for water from
the hydrants to get the soil in shape.
This rate would be about half the
usual cost of the water.
The matter of plowing and cultivat
ing has been satisfactorily solved. It
will cost but $ 1.â€¢">0 to put a lot 50 x 100
feet into shape for planting. Larger
plots of land will be proportionately
less. The services of this man may
be secured through the secretary of
the club, who will make his head
quarters in the Palo Alto Times
building.
Beans have been selected as the big
crop for the city lots, because of their
adaptability to the soil, their food
value, and the fact that they need but
little care and not much water. It is
hoped that every lot used will have
some truck gardening.
The officers of the club are M. L.
deHoog, president; Jerome B. Thom
as, vice-president; William L. Fisch
er, secretary and treasurer.
