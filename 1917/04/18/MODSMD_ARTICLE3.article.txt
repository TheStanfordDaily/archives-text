# Wohlford Selected to Head Chaparral
## 
### 
B. C. Wohlford, '18, was elected to
the editorship of Chaparral for the
coming year in a close election held
today by Hammer and Coffin society.
At the same time R. A. Donaldson,
'17, was named to manage the last
edition of Chaparral, which is to ap
pear on the campus about May 5, due
to the resignation of Lansing Warren,
'17, after the recent action taken by
Men's Student Council.
W. E. Antrim, '19, was elected art
editor for the coming year unani
mously. New members taken into
Hammer and Coffin society were also
elected. They are M. C. Hall, '18, L.
H. Davis, '18, and Goodwin Knight,
'19, all of whom have been contribu
tors to Chaparral in the past.
The April issue of Chaparral has
been edited by the Chaparral wits
convened in extraordinary session.
Each contributed an editorial on the
spot, since the edition has no editor
in-chief.
