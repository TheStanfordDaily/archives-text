# Local Tank Men Will Meet Bears in Pool Saturday
## 
### 
Two intercollegiate swimming meets,
varsity and freshman, Saturday will
complete the list of athletic events
for the year. The varsity swimmers
look to be better than their Califor
nia opponents and Coach Urandsten
looks for them to win their half of
the doubleheader. The freshmen have
been going good all year and have
not yet been defeated.
The California teams are not par
ticularly strong, but according to the
Cardinal coach the Stanford teams
will have to do their best to win. The
Stanford swimmers have not had
much opportunity to practice lately
on account of the intensive training,
but showed form earlier in the season
that looks bad for the visitors. All
the Cardinal entries have been ex
cused from military drill Saturday
morning.

following varsity team: Captain A.
A. Goldsmith, '16, A. Pennaman, '19,
