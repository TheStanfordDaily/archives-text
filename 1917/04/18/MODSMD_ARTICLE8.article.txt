# STANFORD'S OFFICIAL WAR POLICY OUTLINED BY BOARD OF TRUSTEES
## UNIVERSITY RESOURCES OFFERED GOVERNMENT 
### 
Stanford's war policy is strictly patriotic, and must not be misunder
stood, according to a statement agreed upon by the Board of Trustees and
issued officially through the President's Office yesterday.
The Trustees and the President have deemed it fit to declare Stanford's
war policy in view of certain opinions prevalent, particularly in the east,
which hold this University as anti-patriotic and opposed to the present war
movements of the government.
Stanford is strictly behind the government, and will spend her resources
and men in its support, the Trustees want it understood. The official Stan-

ford war policy statement follows:
Trustees Attitude.
Many inquiries have been received
by authorities of Stanford University
concerning its attitude toward the
present war and national prepara
tion, and the Board of Trustees as a
general answer to such
calls attention to the following facts:
Ist: Throughout the entire war
Stanford's active interest in Belgian
relief has been shown by many Stan
ford men and women who have given
their time and thought to that ser
vice, and whose names will be always
associated with it by the world;
Stanford Unit in France.
2nd: A Stanford unit of the Ameri
can Ambulance Field Service made up
of twenty undergraduate students, is
now in active service at the front in
France, and a second unit is being
organized and will soon be sent for
ward ;
3rd: A Reserve Officers' Training
Corps has been organized at Stanford,
in which three hundred students are
enrolled;
Intensive Training.
4th: Since the President's war
message an intensive military train
ing course has been established at
the University, under the direction of
Major Bugge, U. S. A. (retired), pro
fessor of military training and tactics.
Students taking this course or enter
ing the service of the Government
will receive academic credit for their
semester. More than one-half of the
men at the University are thus pre
paring themselves for possible future
service by this course.
sth: By resolution of the Board of
Trustees, the president may grant
leaves of absence to all members of
the instructing staff for active Gov
ernment service, the University guar
anteeing to them the amount of (heir
present salaries and keeping their po
sitions open until their return.
Offer Laboratories.
6th: Use of the University labora
tories and the services of the hosrpital
staff have been freely offered to the
Government.
7th: The inspiring public utter
ances and services of President Wil
bur at all times have been prompted
not only by his own patriotism but
by the general sentiment of the Uni
versity community for which lie has
been spokesman. Every element of
Stanford —faculty, alumni, undergrad
uates and trustees —is united in sup
port of the president of the nation in
(he active prosecution of the war.
