# MRS. HOOVER TO SPEAK ON WAR RESULTS
## 
### 
Mrs. Herbert C. Hoover, the Stan
ford woman who has done so much in
aiding the stricken Belgians, will
speak at the Assembly tomorrow at
11 o'clock. Mrs. Hoover, who has
been on the campus but a short time,
is awaiting Mr. Hoover's return from
London. Since the declaration of
war by the United States he has giv
en up the head ol" the Belgium Relief
to accept the chairmanship of the
newly organized Food Board of the
United States. The topic for tomor
row will be "The Condition of Eng
land and Belgium Due to the War."
Mrs. Hoover spoke before the
Faculty Women's Club recently on
the food supply of the coun
tries participating in the war.
Germany, because of the intensive
farming which has been carried on
in that country, will never be starved
into making peace as the food supply
already assured will last until 1918,
according to Mrs. Hoover.
One of the big items to be met in
the United States, she says, will be
the elimination of the waste of food
stuffs in everyday life. Intensive
home farming will be one of the fac
tors in helping to do away with the
household extravagances. Mr. Hoov
er is now investigating the conditions
of the food supply in the European
countries to determine the possibility
of profiting by their mistakes.
