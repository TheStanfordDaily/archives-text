# RIGOROUS DRILL GIVEN WEARY SOLDIERS
## MARCH IN FOOTHILLS Major Bugge Lectures to Men in Morning and Field Work in Afternoon 
### 
Faltering feet and drooping heads
testified to the rigor of the first field
work of the intensive training class
yesterday. The men were marched,
sometimes in double time, all over
the roads and hills around French
man's lake and the Mayfield country.
One company even went so far as to
patrol the state highway in their
work.
Today's schedule of training will be
much the same as yesterday's, ac
cording to Major Bugge. All the men
will take lunches and will be given
lectures and practical problems by
their officers. This work will prac
tically complete the first field train
ing. As was the case before, the old
members of the Stanford Reserve Of
ficers' Training Corps are to organize
as a battalion, with the new men
forming separate companies under
their special officers. '
Major liugge Lectures.
Yesterday morning after organiza
tion of the regiment the companies
were marched up above Frenchman's
lake. Major Bugge lectured the first
two hours on the principles of the pa
trol and the outpost. Following the
talk the old companies organized as
an advance guard to explain the
points in the lecture.
Principles Carried Out.
In the afternoon the Reserve Offi
cers Training Corps were put under
tlie command of their company com
manders and Major Griffin. The prin
ciples which had been explained in
the morning w'ere put into effect. All
the roads near Mayfield were guarded,
one company going so far as to stop
three automobiles and several pedes
trians in their zeal. One man ex
plained his presence by stating that
"he didn't know he was intruding but
just wanted to get his tools." One
automobile full of women was stopped
and allowed to go on when it was
found they "were going to Lagunita
on a picnic."
During the .afternoon pictures were
taken of one of the companies charg
ing up and down the hills, for the
San Francisco Chronicle.
While the "regulars" were drilling
the new men under Major Bugge,
Sergeant Bates and Sergeant Jewell
were put through training. Although
not so for advanced as for the old
hands this work was enough to give
that "tired feeling" to all the would
be soldiers. They organized as com
panies, battalions and regiments in
carrying outpost .duty, patrolling and
advance guard duty into effect.

on a picnic."
During the .afternoon pictures were
taken of one of the companies charg
ing up and down the hills, for the
San Francisco Chronicle.
While the "regulars" were drilling
the new men under Major Bugge,
Sergeant Bates and Sergeant Jewell
were put through training. Although
not so for advanced as for the old
hands this work was enough to give
that "tired feeling" to all the would
be soldiers. They organized as com
panies, battalions and regiments in
carrying outpost .duty, patrolling and
advance guard duty into effect.
Faltering feet and drooping heads
testified to the rigor of the first field
work of the intensive training class
yesterday. The men were marched,
sometimes in double time, all over
the roads and hills around French
man's lake and the Mayfield country.
One company even went so far as to
patrol the state highway in their
work.
Today's schedule of training will be
much the same as yesterday's, ac
cording to Major Bugge. All the men
will take lunches and will be given
lectures and practical problems by
their officers. This work will prac
tically complete the first field train
ing. As was the case before, the old
members of the Stanford Reserve Of
ficers' Training Corps are to organize
as a battalion, with the new men
forming separate companies under
their special officers. '
Major liugge Lectures.
Yesterday morning after organiza
tion of the regiment the companies
were marched up above Frenchman's
lake. Major Bugge lectured the first
two hours on the principles of the pa
trol and the outpost. Following the
talk the old companies organized as
an advance guard to explain the
points in the lecture.
Principles Carried Out.
In the afternoon the Reserve Offi
cers Training Corps were put under
tlie command of their company com
manders and Major Griffin. The prin
ciples which had been explained in
the morning w'ere put into effect. All
the roads near Mayfield were guarded,
one company going so far as to stop
three automobiles and several pedes
trians in their zeal. One man ex
plained his presence by stating that
"he didn't know he was intruding but
just wanted to get his tools." One
automobile full of women was stopped
and allowed to go on when it was
found they "were going to Lagunita
on a picnic."
