# TEACH THE SUNNY SIDE OF WAR
## 
### 
It's an ill wind that doesn't keep somebody cool. So this little gust is
dedicated to the proposition that we ought tofind out what it's all about.
We heard wawr to the left of us, to the right of us, and in front of us.
Now and then somebody says something about common sense and patriot
ism.
Now that the first sweet prospects of forgetting (classes have been
quieted by the sober tramp-tramp ofintensive drill, we've had the time to
think whether or not we wish to enter the army of Uncle Sam. Some of
us don't want to, though we will if it's best.
All the time men higher up have been telling us that those who don't
enter the army are just as important as the ones who do —all of which
we've swallowed quite gullibly. We've believed them. Comes a time
though when we all register from Missouri, and want to ask a lot of
questions about the practical side of being patriotic outside the army.
Take the case of the women. They're like the flowers that bloom in
the spring—pretty but not very useful, under the circumstances. But
give a person something to do, and apprehension and restlessness rolls
away. It's a fine thing to fit yourself into the war. if you know how, but
if you don't know, you're a kite with a broken string.
It happens now that the military phase of war is the only one being
taught or mentioned in these parts right now. Time's coming when the
government will need such as you and me, and about all we'll know about
is the army. Which will be sad.
All this because the University forgot to present the other side of the
war case. Now is the time for Stanford to come to the aid of the coun
try, in other things besides military work. It's the time to teach the ef
ficiency side of war, to teach conservation, and internal preparedness.
The knowledge we want is in the brains of the faculty and of other
authorities available. Minds are open now to get the lessons that Ameri
cans ordinarily do not appreciate. A series of preparedness lectures would
meet the situation wonderfully well. Men who know how other countries
went about it to meet the problems of war. Why not tell Stanford men
and women ahead of time.
Certain members of the faculty know Avhat some parts of the war are
about. Why not have it out? Let thp common students think by giving
them something to think about. Let both men and women fit themselves
into the war by telling them the places wherein they have to fit. This is
peace time as well as war time strength. Let's mold while th iron's hot.

war case. Now is the time for Stanford to come to the aid of the coun
try, in other things besides military work. It's the time to teach the ef
ficiency side of war, to teach conservation, and internal preparedness.
The knowledge we want is in the brains of the faculty and of other
authorities available. Minds are open now to get the lessons that Ameri
cans ordinarily do not appreciate. A series of preparedness lectures would
meet the situation wonderfully well. Men who know how other countries
went about it to meet the problems of war. Why not tell Stanford men
and women ahead of time.
Certain members of the faculty know Avhat some parts of the war are
about. Why not have it out? Let thp common students think by giving
them something to think about. Let both men and women fit themselves
into the war by telling them the places wherein they have to fit. This is
peace time as well as war time strength. Let's mold while th iron's hot.

It's an ill wind that doesn't keep somebody cool. So this little gust is
dedicated to the proposition that we ought tofind out what it's all about.
We heard wawr to the left of us, to the right of us, and in front of us.
Now and then somebody says something about common sense and patriot
ism.
Now that the first sweet prospects of forgetting (classes have been
quieted by the sober tramp-tramp ofintensive drill, we've had the time to
think whether or not we wish to enter the army of Uncle Sam. Some of
us don't want to, though we will if it's best.
All the time men higher up have been telling us that those who don't
enter the army are just as important as the ones who do —all of which
we've swallowed quite gullibly. We've believed them. Comes a time
though when we all register from Missouri, and want to ask a lot of
questions about the practical side of being patriotic outside the army.
Take the case of the women. They're like the flowers that bloom in
the spring—pretty but not very useful, under the circumstances. But
give a person something to do, and apprehension and restlessness rolls
away. It's a fine thing to fit yourself into the war. if you know how, but
if you don't know, you're a kite with a broken string.
It happens now that the military phase of war is the only one being
taught or mentioned in these parts right now. Time's coming when the
government will need such as you and me, and about all we'll know about
is the army. Which will be sad.
All this because the University forgot to present the other side of the
war case. Now is the time for Stanford to come to the aid of the coun
try, in other things besides military work. It's the time to teach the ef
ficiency side of war, to teach conservation, and internal preparedness.
