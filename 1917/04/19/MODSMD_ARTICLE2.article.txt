desirous of supporting that feature of
the day's program, these events will
not be held.
April 28 will be a full day, with the
program commencing at 8:30 and
ending with a basket supper at r>.
During the supper "S's" will be
granted those women who have par
ticipated in intercollegiate games and
class numerals will also be awarded

Owing to the fact that Mills Col

down, the game with the college
women has been called off, but base
ball will be played, and arrangements
for competition are being made.
In addition to the sports, there will
be dancing" in the gymnasium. A
meeting of the Field Day Committee
and class captains will be held in the
