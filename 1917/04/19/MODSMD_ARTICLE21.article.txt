SHRAPNEL.
"Join the army and see the world!"
say the bill-posters and correctly.
Yesterday's expedition into the wilds
opened the eyes of many an under
classman to the beauties of the sur
rounding country. Some of the most
beautiful beauties were leaning out of
sorority windows, posing as Barbara
Fritchie in the famous legend and
poem by that name.
Advance information as to the big
trek was misleading. Instead of a
great journey into the wilds, the col
umns found themselves at noon on
the Sigma Nu front lawn. The after
noon was spent for the most part in
preventing the lonesomeness of young
cows and in blocking the sun on its
way to the ground. Many faces
beamed last night, and burned, as if
with maiden blushes.
Information for Clumsy Corporals.
To tell right from left, take out a
pocket scissors and proceed to trim
nails. To tell up from down, stand
on the head. If the blood rushes to
the brain, the direction taken by the
fluid is down.
Information for Green Privates.
To tell a captain from a corporal,
merely yell, "HEY THERE!" If the
man is a corporal, he will report you
to the captain. If the man is a cap
tain you will be reported to the cor
poral.
"Follow me. Skoimlsh foimntiou!"
yells the sweet corporal who lisps
lightly.
WRITE ABOUT!
Stanford, April 17, 1917.
Dearest Mother and Fatherâ€”Can't
write much these days. Military is
taking up my time. Seven hours in
the day time and lectures at night is
enough to make me want to hit the
mat immediately at the stroke of 10.
Your loving dutiful son, JAKE.
