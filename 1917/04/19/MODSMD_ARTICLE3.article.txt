# Philosopher . . . . Calls Co-Eds . . . "Hifalutin"

"Did you ever notice the evolu
tion of the co-ed?" said Hugh Mc-
Ivor Porter, the Daily's type-jerk
ing philosopher, as he threw in a
few incorrect headlines into the
make-up of today's Daily. "They
come around here as freshmen
wearing ordinary clothes, not
Hossie at all, and carryin' their
lunch in one o' these Union Lead
er cans. Then they begin to
write communications about wim
min to The Daily, and get into
one of these here fraternities,
and then Gosh how they do throw
on the glad rags, and get high
falutin',"
Hugh stopped to throw a few last
mistakes into the forthcoming
Sequoia, and pulled down his
derby over his ear. There's a
co-ed comes around here, and
when she was a sophomore she
had no more style than a egg,
and used to be some high moke
in the Y. M. C. A. And now she
blows in here like a million, no
more Y. M. C. A. about her than
nothin', and about half these
Daily guys following her and
askin' if they can't take a proof
or somethin'. Then after they get
dolled up some strong, brutal guy
comes along, and the call o' the
wild gets them. Wouldn't it beat
you—this evolution of the co-ed?"
Which, after all, is the truth —
even if Hugh does say so.
