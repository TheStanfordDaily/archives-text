## 
### 
Every man now signed for inten
sive drill who lias not already handed
in his petition to the registrar's of
fice should do so immediately. Only
565 men of the total number of 800
soldiers have attended to their peti
tions. according to Assistant Regis
trar J. E. McDowell. It is highly im
portant that all such communications
ho turned in, so that the office can
check up and send the lists of men
taking drill to the instructors of the
various departments.
