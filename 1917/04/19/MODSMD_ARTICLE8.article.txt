## 
### 
"The past three years have entirely
revolutionized all departments of war
fare, and 110 phase more than the
sanitarian's, which is of the utmost
importance, as in all past wars more
men have been killed by disease than
by the enemy's bullets." So said As
sociate Professor R. W. Doane of
the Stanford Entomology department,
in his lecture to the men enrolled in
intensive training in Assembly Hall,
last night.
In the problem of war sanitation,
insects play a most important part,
according to Professor Doane. The
noxious insects may be divided into
three classes, those whose chief men
ace consists in their direct bite or
attack, those who carry disease me
chanically, and those who act as hosts
for disease.
Illustrations were given of the par
ticular menace of the insects of each
class, and the proper methods of com
batting them. House flies, mosquitos,
ticks, and body lice were singled out
for particular denouncement, and
means for their eradication discussed.
