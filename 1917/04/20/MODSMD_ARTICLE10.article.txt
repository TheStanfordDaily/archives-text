# ARM TO FIGHT FOR PEACE IS PLEA OF MRS. HOOVER IN ASSEMBLY TALK
## IMPRESSIONS VIVIDLY PICTURED Tells of Belgium's Suffering and Uncertainty in Gloom of War 
### 
A plea, for preparedness that the
I United States might array itself on
| the side of the Allies and fight for
' |)cace was the keynote of Mrs. Her
' bert C. Hoover's address before Stan
ford University today on conditions in
Belgium.
Vividly Mrs. Hoover pictured the
i impressions that the world's greatest
| i>eace organization, the Belgian Re
lief Commission lias reached as the
result of living "within the lines" of
1 Germany. I'ntil the United States de
; clared war, Mrs. Hoover was not at
liberty to tell what she lias seen.
: Sights Fit for Kpics.
I"I have been seeing things which,
while they are fit to have epics writ
ten about them, are simple and prac
tical. We hope that we will never
have to face such a crisis as the Bel
gians have faced. We hope you will
never have the uncertainty as to what
will happen to wives and children
(hat the Belgians have faced in the
last two and a half years.
"I hope you will never have to won
der whether your man is still fight
ing and working, or whether he is a
human wreck in some hospital wait
ing for you to come to him, or
whether lie has been peacefully sleep
ing in some unknown grave. These
things the Belgian women have had
to face. H we ever have such a crisis
to face, I hope we can show half the
fortitude of the Belgians.
"Every one of the men and women
there have felt the gloomy something
that never leaves Belgium. Bel
gium's fate signifies what we might
have been but for a few chance
throws of the dice of fate," Mrs. Hoo
ver emphasized, showing the analo
gous situations in which United States
and Belgium stand, both unprepared.
"She was as unprepared as we to
meet her rivals.
"Our first line of defense is our
navy—the very finest, but so small it
couldn't stand the attacks of a strong
force. Belgium's first line of defense
was a few finely equipped forts, not
enough to withstand a larger force
with more superior arms, Verdun
has not stayed in the hands of the
French because of forts, but because
of the French army behind, which is
superior in strategy, fortitude, and
skill to that of the Germans.
Itclgium Stood in the Way.
"Belgium herself was not a lure for
her assailants. Like ourselves she
stood in the way, just as we stand in
the way of "nations wanting to get to
South America. We of the Commis
sion for Relief of Belgium want war
because of what we have seen," Mrs.
Hoover emphasized, reading a tele
gram from her husband.
"He saw there is one thing infinite
ly more terrible than war—that is
racial slavery. Belgium has been un
! dor the net for two and one-half years
| but we who know realize that she
I will never be enslaved alive." Mrs.
! Hoover contrasted the case of Bel
gium with that of Luxemburg, which
assented to German enslavement.
"Luxemburg's fetters may be a lit
tle more ornate than Belgium's, but
j for practical purposes they work the
j .same way. Bodily punishment helps
i to fortify Belgium spiritually, mental
| ly, morally."
I Pric<- of Unprepared ness.
"Thus we see the position we would
| be in if we awoke some morning and
j found a great big bully asking pas
! sage through our country, if we are
1 unprepared. We must also keep from
| becoming a bully. We must keep
I our strength subject to ideals. If we
keep our ideals in control of our
strength we will not go around trying
to conquer the world."
Mrs. Hoover toll of the sordidness
lof war,, and the disgust war has
| brought to the relief workers. "Please
j remember, when I talk of war it is
| war for a special purpose and not for
: war's sake," she said. "We who are
j for war now are for war that there
| may be pcace afterward, when we
have stopped this thing we have seen
over there that is worse than war.
"We are glad that men and women
i here are learning there's more than
! one kind of service in the war. Men
| who serve in shops on the ranks are
, just as loyal and may be making
more of a sacrifice than the men in
the trenches. We are glad you rea
lize we must give equal honor and
I love to the soldiers in blue jeans and
I to the men with brass buttons."

I"I have been seeing things which,
while they are fit to have epics writ
ten about them, are simple and prac
tical. We hope that we will never
have to face such a crisis as the Bel
gians have faced. We hope you will
never have the uncertainty as to what
will happen to wives and children
(hat the Belgians have faced in the
last two and a half years.
"I hope you will never have to won
der whether your man is still fight
ing and working, or whether he is a
human wreck in some hospital wait
ing for you to come to him, or
whether lie has been peacefully sleep
ing in some unknown grave. These
things the Belgian women have had
to face. H we ever have such a crisis
to face, I hope we can show half the
fortitude of the Belgians.
"Every one of the men and women
there have felt the gloomy something
that never leaves Belgium. Bel
gium's fate signifies what we might
have been but for a few chance
throws of the dice of fate," Mrs. Hoo
ver emphasized, showing the analo
gous situations in which United States
and Belgium stand, both unprepared.
"She was as unprepared as we to
meet her rivals.
"Our first line of defense is our
navy—the very finest, but so small it
couldn't stand the attacks of a strong
force. Belgium's first line of defense
was a few finely equipped forts, not
enough to withstand a larger force
with more superior arms, Verdun
has not stayed in the hands of the
French because of forts, but because
of the French army behind, which is
superior in strategy, fortitude, and
skill to that of the Germans.
Itclgium Stood in the Way.
"Belgium herself was not a lure for
her assailants. Like ourselves she
stood in the way, just as we stand in
the way of "nations wanting to get to
South America. We of the Commis
sion for Relief of Belgium want war
because of what we have seen," Mrs.
Hoover emphasized, reading a tele
gram from her husband.
"He saw there is one thing infinite
ly more terrible than war—that is
racial slavery. Belgium has been un
! dor the net for two and one-half years
| but we who know realize that she
I will never be enslaved alive." Mrs.
! Hoover contrasted the case of Bel
gium with that of Luxemburg, which
assented to German enslavement.
"Luxemburg's fetters may be a lit
tle more ornate than Belgium's, but
j for practical purposes they work the
j .same way. Bodily punishment helps
i to fortify Belgium spiritually, mental

I our strength subject to ideals. If we
keep our ideals in control of our
strength we will not go around trying
to conquer the world."
Mrs. Hoover toll of the sordidness

I to the men with brass buttons."
A plea, for preparedness that the
I United States might array itself on
| the side of the Allies and fight for
' |)cace was the keynote of Mrs. Her
' bert C. Hoover's address before Stan
ford University today on conditions in
Belgium.
Vividly Mrs. Hoover pictured the
i impressions that the world's greatest
| i>eace organization, the Belgian Re
lief Commission lias reached as the
result of living "within the lines" of
1 Germany. I'ntil the United States de
; clared war, Mrs. Hoover was not at
liberty to tell what she lias seen.
: Sights Fit for Kpics.
I"I have been seeing things which,
while they are fit to have epics writ
ten about them, are simple and prac
tical. We hope that we will never
have to face such a crisis as the Bel
gians have faced. We hope you will
never have the uncertainty as to what
will happen to wives and children
(hat the Belgians have faced in the
last two and a half years.
"I hope you will never have to won
der whether your man is still fight
ing and working, or whether he is a
human wreck in some hospital wait
ing for you to come to him, or
whether lie has been peacefully sleep
ing in some unknown grave. These
things the Belgian women have had
to face. H we ever have such a crisis
to face, I hope we can show half the
fortitude of the Belgians.
"Every one of the men and women
there have felt the gloomy something
that never leaves Belgium. Bel
gium's fate signifies what we might
have been but for a few chance
throws of the dice of fate," Mrs. Hoo
ver emphasized, showing the analo
gous situations in which United States
and Belgium stand, both unprepared.
"She was as unprepared as we to
meet her rivals.
"Our first line of defense is our
navy—the very finest, but so small it
couldn't stand the attacks of a strong
force. Belgium's first line of defense
was a few finely equipped forts, not
enough to withstand a larger force
with more superior arms, Verdun
has not stayed in the hands of the
French because of forts, but because
of the French army behind, which is
superior in strategy, fortitude, and
skill to that of the Germans.
Itclgium Stood in the Way.
"Belgium herself was not a lure for
her assailants. Like ourselves she
stood in the way, just as we stand in
the way of "nations wanting to get to
South America. We of the Commis
sion for Relief of Belgium want war
because of what we have seen," Mrs.
Hoover emphasized, reading a tele
gram from her husband.
"He saw there is one thing infinite
ly more terrible than war—that is
racial slavery. Belgium has been un
! dor the net for two and one-half years
| but we who know realize that she
I will never be enslaved alive." Mrs.
! Hoover contrasted the case of Bel
gium with that of Luxemburg, which
assented to German enslavement.
"Luxemburg's fetters may be a lit
tle more ornate than Belgium's, but
j for practical purposes they work the
j .same way. Bodily punishment helps
i to fortify Belgium spiritually, mental
| ly, morally."
I Pric<- of Unprepared ness.
"Thus we see the position we would
| be in if we awoke some morning and
j found a great big bully asking pas
! sage through our country, if we are
1 unprepared. We must also keep from
| becoming a bully. We must keep
I our strength subject to ideals. If we
keep our ideals in control of our
strength we will not go around trying
to conquer the world."
Mrs. Hoover toll of the sordidness
lof war,, and the disgust war has
| brought to the relief workers. "Please
j remember, when I talk of war it is
| war for a special purpose and not for
: war's sake," she said. "We who are
j for war now are for war that there
| may be pcace afterward, when we
have stopped this thing we have seen
over there that is worse than war.
"We are glad that men and women
i here are learning there's more than
! one kind of service in the war. Men
| who serve in shops on the ranks are
, just as loyal and may be making
more of a sacrifice than the men in
the trenches. We are glad you rea
lize we must give equal honor and
I love to the soldiers in blue jeans and
I to the men with brass buttons."
