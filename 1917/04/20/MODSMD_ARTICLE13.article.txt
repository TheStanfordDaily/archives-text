# INTENSIFYING INSENSITY
## 
### 
Intensive training is a good thing, and we are for it. In fact, it is a
poor goal which is not worth an intensive striving to reach. We may,
however, overdo the businessâ€”get too intensive. Anything that is "too" is
not perfect. Stanford's training got too intensive today when it deliberate
ly passed up a chance to hear Mrs. H. C. Hoover in Assembly Hall.
Our army should by all means have been allowed to hear Mrs. Hoover
on "Preparedness" this morning. Her message was very much worth
hearing for itself, but doubly so coming from the woman who has done so
much to relieve the sufferings of Europe, and who speaks from such a fund
of experience-acquired knowledge. One less hour of marching would have
been a small sacrifice. If we were training a bunch of privates, the
marching might have done them more good, but theoretically at least,
Stanford men are training to be officers. Anything which will give those
who are to lead a broader conception of our needs and a fuller realization
of the principles for which we are to fight, should not be overlooked. Mrs.
Hoover's talk would have done that Ibis morning.
