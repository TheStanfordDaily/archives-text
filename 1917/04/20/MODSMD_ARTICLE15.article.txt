# Funds Will Provide Home for Children
## 
### 
Funds are being raised to maintain
a convalcscent home for children in
the Stanford Guild Hospital during
two summer months. Already $952
lias been subscribed and the commit
tee in charge, of which Miss Sarah
Ilarker is president and Miss Beth
Thompson is secretary, hopes to in
crease this amount to $1000 within a
few days.
According to present plans, chil
dren from the clinic of the Stanford
Medical School will be brought to this
vicinity for a period of two weeks
each, before being sent home from
the San Francisco clinic. Dr. Fader,
who is in charge of the work at Lane
Hospital, has heartily endorsed tho
plan of the Palo Alto workers.
A competent physician, a graduate
nurse and some assistants will take
charge in the summer. It is planned
to house children from six to fourteen
years of age. Subscriptions to the
fund already started are being so
licited. A larger fund means the
maintenance of a greater number of
convalescents.
