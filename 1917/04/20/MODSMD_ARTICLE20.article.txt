# Tennis Team Meets Sacramento Sunday
## 
### 
Tennis Captain A. H. Barber, 'IS,
announces matches for the varsity
squad Sunday morning at 10 o'clock
with the Sacramento Tennis Club.
Sunday's contests will constitute
league matches, and as the Sacra
mento Club has several excellent
players in their midst, the tennis will
undoubtedly be of the first class. Six
singles matches and three doubles
contests will be played.
Last Sunday the Stanford varsity
went down lo defeat, before, the Golden
Gate tennis club in league play, win
ning but four matches to their oppo
nents' five. Stanford's tennis team
ranks low in the percentage columns
of the league, and only by winning
practically every contest from now
until the end of the season could the
Cardinals hope to come out near the
top of the last.
Tennis captain for the 1918 season
will be chosen early next week.
