### 
President Wilbur has received cop
ies of a number of letters received by
the Friends of France, telling of the
activities of the Stanford Unit of the
American Ambulance Field Service
since it. reached France.
Dr. A. Piatt Andrew, head of the
Field Service, writes of the Stanford
men: "I do not know how to express
the appreciation we feel for your in
terest and cooperation and above all,
for the great care which you exer
cise in selecting these men. We have
never had a finer group in the history
of the service. They have, from their
arrival here, shown an eagerness to
help in every possible way. lam con
fident that they will give a good re
port of themselves in the serious
work which lies ahead- of them.
Expect IT.l T . C. Section.
"They have left for a point in the
Verdun Section. We are looking for
ward to a section from the Univer
sity of California."
In another letter Mr. Andrew says:
"The men you have sent over are of
; kind we like to have in our s<
vice and are also animated by the
right sort of ideals, it is gratifying
to learn, too, that the interest aroused
in Stanford has stimulated a healthy
sense of rivalry in the University of
California, and that we may expect a
contingent from the latter Univer
sity."
J. H. Eastman, the Stanford man
who was largely responsible for the
organization of the Stanford Unit,
writing soon after the corps left for
the front, says that their actual work
ii]) to that time had consisted in being
on duty, four ambulances at a time,
at a point about five miles from the
first line trenches, and that he him
self is driving the ambulance that was
donated by students and friends of
Stanford as a memorial to Professor j
Pellissier."
Itaiiquefs to Overalls.
Dr. Andrew introduced Eastman as |
"the young Californian who was more
instrumental than any one else in or
ganizing this group," and jokingly re
ferred to the number of banquets that
had been tendered the section. East
man said:
"Dr. Andrew spoke very truly when
lie said we had been banqueted for
some time. So far it has been a very
enjoyable party. We sta'rted out very
gorgeously at. San Francisco over a
month ago, and we haven't stopped,
and we are going strong now.
"However, we have had in mind
all the time the day when we are go
ing to have to put on overalls, go to
the front, and do what the rest of
them are doing. Here in Paris we
have come nearer to the idea which
we have started towards, than we had
been able to do up to this time."
