"If America will only eliminate
waste and extravagance in food it
will go far to help the whole prob
lem," was the declaration of Herbert
Hoover in a statment to the Associat
ed Press. Eighty-five per cent of the
foodstuffs used in this country is con
sumed in the households. The woman
of America thus really controls
America's food consumption. The Al
lies of course should have first
call on our surplus, and we should
not allow any products of our labor
to go to any country which either di
rectly or indirectly helps Germany.
"The war will probably last another
year and we shall have all we can do
by the utmost elimination of waste
and stimulation of production to
carry our allies through with their
full fighting stamina.
This conclusion was reached by
Mr. Hoover only after making an in
quiry including examinations of com
ing harvests and methods of control
now in operation in the allied coun
tries. lie is expected to return from
Europe in a short time to assume his
duties as chairman of the American
recently appointed.
