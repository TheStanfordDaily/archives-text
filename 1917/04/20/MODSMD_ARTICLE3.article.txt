# "Dust Lies too Still" Complains Janitor
## 
### 
It's a sad sad life 011 the Quad these
days. Only the blackbirds and co-eds
(sonic of them" birds) and the pro
fessors (species "rare bird") are to
be seen about the sandstone arches
and red tiles. The whole center of
the University has moved over to the ;
Gymnasium, where the khaki and
corduroy "intensives" are marching
and hanging their rifles in an ominous
fashion.
It's so deserted on the Quad that
even the janitors are beginning to
get melancholy. An ordinary stude
who is still among those present in
the classes passed the colored janitor
in the English building the other
day. He was dusting off a handrail
on the stairs.
"It's pretty quiet, around here now,
isn't it?" remarked the stude. The
janitor shook his head sadly and gave
another slap to the rail.
"Yessuh," he said, "I nevah done
see de like. Dey don't seem to be no
body 'round heah no mo'. He gave
another dust. "No sah," he continued
sadly, "Dey don't seem to be 'nuf
doin' even to keep de dust movin'."
Yes, it's a sad and lonely life on
the Quad nowadays.
