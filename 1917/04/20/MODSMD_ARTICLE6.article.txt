## U. C. MEETS CARDINAL Varsity and Freshman Teams to Fight Aquatic Duel in Local Tank 
### 
Stanford and California oppose each
contests of the year when both fresh
man and varsity swimmers of the
I'.lne and Gold and Cardinal will cn
gage in a double-headed swimming
meet. According to advance dope this
will probably be the biggest aquatic
contest ever staged by the two uni
versities. The first meet, the varsity
event, is scheduled to start promptly
at 2 o'clock in the Stanford tank,
with the freshman meet following
shortly afterward.
Varsity Meet Close.
According to Swimming Coach Er
nie Urandsten, Stanford stands an ex
cellent chance of emerging 011 the
long end of the score from both meets.
However, the varsity contest is likely
to be exceedingly close with the relay
probably deciding in Stanford's favor.
In the 30 yards Captain A. A. Gold
smith. '16, and A. W. Penniman, '19,
are the Cardinal entries. They are
opposed by Lindsay and either Lyon
or Smith. Doping the fifty is uncer
tain, but Penniman seems to have at
least an even break for first. Penni
man is the only Stanford entry in the
i 100 and will have strong competition
from Lindsay, Smith or Kidder.
H. H. Iredell, 'IS, will swim the 220
for Stanford and will be opposed by
two of the trio of California men en
tered in the 100. In the 100 yards
breast stroke race A. H. Coleman, '17,
and E. A. Wright, '19, are opposed by
only one California entry, Campbell.
E. S. Winbam, '19, and Iredell are en
tered in the 100 yards back stroke
and should give Kidder, the Califor
nia man, a close race. In the diving
event N. Rakestraw, '16, and A. Wil
cox, '19, oppose Hammer of Califor
nia. F. Qstrander, '19, and Goldsmith
should score close on to eight points
for the Cardinal in the plunge for dis
tance. Lyon and Mays are plunging
for the Bears. Penniman, Goldsmith,
E. R. Caughey, 'IS, H. S. McGaffey,
'19, or Lee Sclilesinger, 'IS, comprise
the Stanford relay team, and ought to
defeat Lindsay, Kidder, Smith and
Lyon.
The 1920 team seems almost certain
of victory, providing the dope is not
too much upset. L..1. Balbach and.1.
\V. Considine in the 50, Captain C. 13.
Greene and Balbach in the 100. Greene
and H. W. Wyckoff in the 220, G. K.
Coonse and E. J. Sparling in the back
and breast stroke races. Considine
and L. Sloss, Jr., in the plunge for
distance, and Greene and Balbach in
the diving event are the Cardinal en
tries. The California babes do not ap
pear to have a strong enough combin
ation to defeat this team.
