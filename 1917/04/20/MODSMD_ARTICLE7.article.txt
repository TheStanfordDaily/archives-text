### 
"A Full Mouse," the Senior Farce,
will be staged as a benefit show on
; tho evening of May 16, the date which
was originally set for the production.
This decision was made at a meeting
of the chairmen of the Senior Week
committees and the Farce committee,
land after consulting with Dr. Wilbur.
The show is being produced for the
benefit of the second Stanford am
bulance unit, which leaves for the
front some time the latter part of
May. The cast is willing to devote
all the time possible to bringing the
show up to the usual standard even
I though there is only a short time left
1 for rehearsals.
Itenetit Uevived Farce.
It was decided at the last senior
meeting that all Senior Week activi
ties would be eliminated but the lay-
J ins of the class plate, the class exer
-1 cises and the ball. However, the sug
| gestion for having the farce a benefit
j has mot the approval of the majority
iof the class. President Ames will be
unable to call a class meeting as al
most all the men are in military
: training.
The men who are in the cast and
i who are taking military training have
been granted special leaves from the
evening lectures in order that rehear
sals may go on as usual. The first
rehearsal since the plan to drop the
farce last week was held yesterday
afternoon under the direction of
Coach Mathieu, who is to devote his
time almost entirely to rehearsals
during the few weeks remaining he
fore the production.
