# Chappie to Appear: Big Chief Is Silent
## 
### 
When the brave wits who compose
Chaparral's fountain of mirth discov
i ered suddenly that the editorial pen—
: or rather hammer —had been suddenly
! grasped from the hands of the chief
j Chappie they assembled in convcn
-1 tion extraordinary to take official cog
nizance of the situation.
All of which explains why the April
number of Chappie, which appears to
day on the Quad, has a varied list of
contributors on its editorial page.
Today's issue of Chaparral is dedi
cated to tlie great cinder path* sport—
which is very appropriate since track
is all over now and the Cardinal was
successful. The cover, drawn by G.
W. Hall, '19, portrays accurately what
the Stanford track artists did to the
Berkeley Campanile. Stanford mili
tary preparedness is a popular theme
for Chappie artists and dope men
alike. The frontispiece is entitled
"Educated, By Ileck," while the open
ing illustration is i»y ,J. M. Wallace,
'17. W. I']. Antrim, '19, is responsible
for a double page drawing entitled
"Types Seen on the Track." What be
came of Lansing Warren, ex-editor,
.nil also be reveaied.
The opening poem is very appro
priate in light of what happened last
Saturday on the Berkeley oval. A
comeback to the po< m in the last is
sue by S. E. Briggs, '19, entitled
"Which," is one of the features of the
issue. Another is on the Junior Op
era. Some cuts from the josh sec
tion of this year's Quad will also be
included in today's issue. It will be
sold at the gymnasium to accommo
date the men who are drilling.
