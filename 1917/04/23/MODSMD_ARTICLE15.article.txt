Stanford is fortunate not to have been caught napping in this time of
national crisis—not to have found herself without machinery to take an
active part in the work of preparedness. Thus far we think the Univer
sity has made the best of her resources, and has successfully discredited
the oft-repeated statement that all colleges are self-centered and provincial.
Now comes an opportunity for Stanford to enter into the spirit as well as
the work of preparedness—an opportunity to see beyond the borders of the
Farm and to catch something of the enthusiasm of others. No Stanford
man or woman can make a mistake by attending the preparedness parade
and rally in San Francisco Tuesday afternoon. The University will be
well represented in the parade by the Reserve Officers Training Corps,
but we can not have too large a delegation at the rally in the Civic Audi
torium.
California will also be there in force, and with the two large Univer
sities cooperating, it is possible that the civilian population of San Fran
cisco will discover some good in college yells and undergraduate enthu
siasm.

In these times of intensive training, when resting during spare hours
is much more popular than getting out a college daily, we are greatly in
debted to those who have supplemented the regular staff of The Daily
Palo Alto in the work of editing the paper. Anita Allen, '17, Anita Mar
cus, '17, Olive Yoder, '16, H. S. Marshutz, '17, R. A. Donaldson, '17, M. F.
Samis, '20, and H. W. Frantz, '18, have been of invaluable assistance.
