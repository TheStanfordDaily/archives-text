# Seventeen Hopes For Lucky Draw to "A Full House"
## 
### 
Last year's senior class held "A
Pair of Sixes" and, when they played
it. found they had a winning hand.
If you can do that with a pair of
sixes, what can't you do with "A Full
House," said the 1917 farce commit
tee, and so they decided to gamble
on it. Rut that is as far as the gam
bling goes, for there is no mention
of it after the curtain goes up on
this year's senior offering.
There is a stolen necklace, a mix-up
in bags in a railroad wreck, and a
lively chase in trying to get the guilty
man. Moreover we will have an op
portunity to see Mary Flowers in a
part of glittering possibilities when
she faces the footlights as Susie, the
half-witted maid with an unquenched
yearning to return to her beloved
Sioux City, lowa. Esther Liversidge
will shatter tradition by appearing as
an elderly aunt instead of a chic
heroine, and .Tack Russell will adorn
the Assembly Hall stage with his six
feet four, making the most of a re
splendent policeman's uniform.
The profits of this year's farce will
go to the fund to help send the sec
ond division of Stanford ambulance
men to the French front.
