# Cardinal Loses to Bruin Mat Artists
## 
### 
University of California took a toe
j hold on grappling honors when it de
! feated Stanford's wrestlers three
! wins to two at the Encina Gymnasium
I Friday night. The most interesting
! bout from the spectator's point of
j view was between P. H. Jones, '17,
Stanford, against Smith of IT. C. The
j judges, after calling for two extra
| four-minute bouts, rendered a draw
! decision. Jones seemed to have a
shade in this bout, due to his aggres
siveness, but it was so slight that the
decision was the only one possible.
R. Crawford, '20, middleweight, and
! IT. Egami in the featherweight divi
sion were the Cardinal winners.
Pierce of California won from C. G.
Gonzalez, '18, through aggressiveness.
K. Nazarian, lightweight, lost in his
bout. ITis opponent, however, was un
doubtedly the cleverest on the floor.
Stanford forfeited in the heavy divi
sion.
The judges for the contests were
Andrews, instructor at U. C.; D. C.
Wise. '18, coach, and R. E. Daniels
acted as referee.
