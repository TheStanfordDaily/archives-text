# Rams Head Elects Five to Give Musical Comedy
## 
### 
Five new members were elected to
Ram's Head, the men's dramatic or
ganization at a meeting held during
the week-end. Bogart Rogers, '19, H.
L. Davis, '17, Dickson Maddox, '16, J.
E. Montgomery, '19, and S. E. Briggs,
'19, were the five men chosen for
membership.
With the help of Dick Morgan and
West Wilson, the members of Ram's
Head are writing a musical comedy to
be presented before the Stanford stu
dents early next semester. Contrary
to plays given by Ram's Head in the
past, it is expected that women as
well as men will take part in the mu
sical production.
