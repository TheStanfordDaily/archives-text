# Beans to Right Beans to Left Of Palo Altans
## 
### 
Hats are off to the lowly bean
In Palo Alto. That humble es
sence of life, so important in the
army and in Boston, is to come
into its own in the west.
There will be beans to the right,
beans to the left, and beans in
front of everybody in Palo Alto.
They will be in abundance every
where.
At the first meeting of the Palo
Alto Garden Club it was officially
decided that the organization
would further the production of
the bean plant, to the exclusion of
all others. The bean was adopt
ed and will be raised on all va
cant lots.
Though the bean be homely, it
is a beautiful plant, especially in
time of war, believes the Garden
Club. It can be grown in flower
pots, in hedges, along the curbs,
in the front yard, in fact any
where except in lawns. All of
these places will be accepted by
Palo Alto society as strictly prop
er places to grow beans as long
as the war lasts.
Hurrah for the bean! May
Palo Alto become the Boston of
the west!
