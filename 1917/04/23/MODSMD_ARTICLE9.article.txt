Members of the Reserve Officers
Training Corps will be put through
their first annual inspection today
and tomorrow. Major W. D. Davis
of the regular army from San Fran
cisco will be the judging officer of
the excellence of the different com
panies. All men who are out for in
tensive training are not included in
this event. The old companies, A, B,
C and D, will be the only organiza
tions to be inspected.
The principal event of the inspec
tion will be a parade and review of
the battalion under Major R. A. Grif
lin, '17. This will include marches
at both quick time and double time
and will be the best test of the effi
ciency of the training at Stanford
that will be given.
In addition to the review each man
of the corps will be inspected on his
personal equipment. The old com
panies were dismissed an hour early
Friday to clean their guns. All the
uniforms, bayonets, cartridge boxes
and shoes must be cleaned and shined

The inspection will be held at nine
o'clock on the faculty clubhouse field.
