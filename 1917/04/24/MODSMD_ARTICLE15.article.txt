Interest in student affairs is necessarily slack at this time, but there
is no excuse for utter disregard of things which were formerly so impor
tant. Today's student body meeting, at which officers were nominated for
next semehter, unearthed a lack of enthusiasm out of all proportion to
the circumstances. There may be considerable college here next year, in
spite of indications to the contrary at present, and there is no use in giv
ing atfay some of the most important student body offices on the calendar.
As matters stand now, an election will be unnecessary for any of the of
fices. While the candidates now in the field are undoubtedly capable,
these offices are important enough to admit of a little competition. There
is still time to nominate through the columns of The Daily Palo Alto.

The senior class has realized that there is nothing to be gained by a
concentration of its final festivities, with the result that the more essen
tial functions will be given as usual. Two weeks ago such a decision
would undoubtedly have met with disapproval from a majority of the mem
bers of the class. Upon saner consideration, with conditions more nor
mal than was expected, no really good reason can be given why the class
of 1917 should not make the customary bow before passing out of Stan
ford life. Commencement can not be moved up, and the interval between
it and the end of final examinations would lie dull without some sort of
celebration.

A possible misinterpretation of an editorial in the current number of
Sequoia should lie forestalled. The writer says,"The Executive Commit
tee has been attempting all semester to gain control of the policy of the
Chaparral through a loan to the maKazino—" it might v»c tiiuuynt rrom
this that the committee has been seeking to make this loan. As a matter
of fact it was considered upon application from Chaparral, and the Exec
utive Committee merely demanded enough control to assure the student
body from possible loss, should the loan be made.
