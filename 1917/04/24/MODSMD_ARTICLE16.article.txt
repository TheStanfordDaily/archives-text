# UNION WAGES GRANTED OREGON UNIVERSITY WOMEN
## 
### 
Union wages are to be granted to
women students of the University of
Oregon who are working their way
through college, as the result of an
agreement between the dean of the
university and Eugene housewives. A
sliding scale was established with a
minimum wage of ten cents per hour.
This is believed to be the first union
wase scale ever adopted for college
women.
