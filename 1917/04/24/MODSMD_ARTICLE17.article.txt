# Josh Section of 1918 Quad to Be Record Breaker
## 
### 
j Secrets that were let out to the
| Daily Palo Alto last night give prom
ise of a Josh section in the 1918 Quad
that will be unique and original in
the extreme. Most of the campus hu
morists and artists that are well
known to Stanford readers have con
tributed to make this section a rec
ord-breaker in the history of Quads.
New features included in the year
book are many. The fraternity sec
tion will contain secrets and raspber
ries of an extraordinary nature, and
will feature several of Monk An
trim's drawings, in his usual clever
style. A five page sorority section,
different from any that has yet been
published, guarantees laughs to the
sorority sisters. A galley of "Stan
lord Types," drawn by Jim Wallace,
is also included, as well as a con
siderable amount of campus gossip
j illustrated by Ruth Taylor. The
Quad editors do not wish to show any
favoritism, so the faculty will also
get due attention in the josh section.
Clever snapshots will enliven the
pages, as special Quad photographers
covered Junior Week, and have some
startling pictures to offer.
