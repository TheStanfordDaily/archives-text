baster princess" would really be a
pretty white person. But if you
listen to Miss Finch tell about her
alabaster princess you learn that she

Africa. As a teller of stories she was
without peer, and she kept the chil
dren regaled with weird and enchant

of the folk who lived In the Bible.

the details of the story of creation
and how "de Lord loped lown de
