Dear Son: 1 have a great faith in
your judgment and give you free rein.
But we don't want you to join the
ambulance corps. We don't want you
to take intensive training. We don't
want you to attend the Presidio camp.
We don't want you to get engaged
Willie rit pollogfp Wo don't want yon
to get out of your final exes. We
don't want you to transfer from Stan
ford to Newman's College Tuesday.
We don't want you to apply for a
commission. You can get a bigger
commission in your own home town â€”
maybe 30 per cent. We don't want,
you to grow a mustache. We don't
want you to be a captain, or a cor
poral, or a sergeant. As T have said
above, T have great faith in your
judgment.
Your Father,
RYAN ROCK.
H. S. M.
