## Inter-Class Sport Supremacy for Trophy to Be Hotly Contested Affairs 
### 
Women's Field Day draws near and |
all those who expect to take part are j
out every day working hard to get
in prime condition. Class competi
tion promises to be keener than ever
before.
One of the prominent features next
Saturday will be the solo dancing by
Mrs. Eileen Mulock, Miss Doris Est
court, and Miss Irma Rayburn. Mrs.
Mulock did a special dance in the
Junior Opera and scored a decided
hit, and before that she had done
professional work. Miss Rayburn
will be remembered as one of the
stars of the opera two years ago.
Miss Estcourt has been in the operas
also.
Juniors seem to have the lead in
basket-ball, being the only ones who
defeated the University of California
basket throwers in the class games
ill) there last week. Swimming prom
ises to be interesting with Miss Hel
en Westerman and Miss Estelle Nis
son, heavy point winners in the in
ter-sorority meet, in the run, as
standbys for their classes.
At 5 o'clock in the Women's Club
House the girls will have a basket
lunch, and at this time the trophy
will be awarded to the winning class,
and also the winner of class numer
als and "S's" will receive their re
ward. No trophy has ever been
granted before so it will undoubtedly
be a large incentive to the classes to
put forth their best efforts to carry
off the meet.
