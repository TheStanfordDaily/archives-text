# All Star Cast for 1917 Senior Farce
## With "A Full House" on Behind Footlights, Full House Is Expected in Front 
### 
Even if Buford Williams, who lias
lioon a sort of burglar-on-reserve for
harrassed committees picking casts
of Stanford plays has been kept out
of "A Full House" by the stern hand
of .Justice," we have a burglar in it
all tho same. And in Dick John
stons lively hands that burglar won't
be any sleeper either, even if he does
spend some of his time under the
piano.
The seniors wanted to do their
best in helping send twenty men to
Hie French front, and so as a starter
they made sure of having "A Full
House" on the bright side of the foot
lights. With a show like that to be
gin with, all that, is left is to dupli
cate the order by putting another full
house where it can watch the back of
the man leading the orchestra.
And when fourteen people under
take to make it as easy for their fel
low men to laugh as the cast of the
senior farce are preparing to ,do
there is nothing for the rest of us to
do but to go—and laugh. Mary Flow
ers in pitching around the room gay
ly with a ruby necklace in her stock
ing steps on Dick Johnson's hand
with her temporarily assumed number
eight, and he can't even holler. He
just looks pleasant. Doors, closets,
telephone, all take on new and ter
rible aspects in "A Full House." All
that is left for the audience to do is
to laugh. What more could we ask?
