"Forestry is making (he best perm
anent use of forests in supplying food
wood and in protecting the country
from wind and water erosion," was
the definition offered last night, by
Professor Walter Mulford in his illus
trated lecture 011 "California's Need
of Forestry," at the Little Theater.
California's forests have been cut
down with no regard for the coming
crop. The European method of for
est harvesting and husbandry was pic
tured to show in contrast to our
sate's and as an example for us to
follow. Switzerland as an example
cuts only strips of trees allowing the
remainder to seed the bare ground,
thus assuring a supply for future use.
The contention that less wood is
being used than heretofore was dis
proved. by showing that decreases in
tlx- materials used for structural pur
poses is balanced by the increase in
wood used in paper boxes and barrels
and such new uses as in pavements.
Newspapers have at various times
said that forests should be cleared
away for agriculture. Foresters ad
vocate this also but protest against
wanton stripping of land useless for
farming.
The California District of National
Forest Service was established to sup
erintend the proper harvesting of lum
ber, the care of young forests and to
protect them from fire. To carry out.
the last, provision lookouts are sta
tioned on high promontories where
fires can be detected as early as pos
sible and assistance brought to the
endangered locality.
