of tlie vast assemblage. The expres
sion of opinion will be sent to Presi
dent Wilson in the form of a tele
gram.

At the mention of the first Stanford
; unit, who were the first westerners

Four American liags were dedicated

of France by the Stanford and Cali
fornia volunteers. The following ex
cerpts from the speeches of the day
are expressive:
"We must join intimately and defi
nitely with France and England in
ihis war. We must fight on the bat
'tlefields of France in order to keep
from fighting upon the soil of the
United States." President Wilbur
made a great plea for universal and
intelligent service of every person in
the United States at the present time.
He states that we must send armed
men to follow the ambulance drivers.
''The future of California is in this
room," said the president in his in
troduction. "What are we going to
do with it? In the present war we
must expend our youth, but we must
expend it in the best way."
"My task is to speak of the men
who will follow you and protect you,"
said General Woodruff in speaking on
"The First Ten Thousand." He con
tinued with the statement that "this
is no time for hair-splitting over vol
unteer or universal service. In fact,
universal service is the only system
that will make our armies safe." He
spoke of the ten thousand officers
who are to be trained, 2500 of them
at the Presidio in San Francisco.
'"This is the finest method of raising
ofiicers that has ever been devised."
"I come to welcome these young
men on behalf of the workers in
France and Belgium. To us this is a
great mission of humanity." In in
troducing Mrs. Hoover Dean Barrows
paid a great tribute to Herbert Hoov
er and the men and women who have
been in charge of relief in Belgium.
As the French consul-general in
San Francisco, the official representa
tive of France in the West, Neltner
thanked the future ambulance drivers.
"These men are going to support
democracy against autocracy, civiliza
tion against Kultur." With your help
the struggle will be successful," was
his concluding statement.
"These men go to follow in the foot
steps of Washington and Lafayette.
Our hearts go out with gratitude to
them for their mission. They go for
the cause of humanity. In fact the
whole nation is fighting to add the
star of humanity to our flag."
Due to the absence of the governor,
Arlett was the state representative at
the meeting. In well chosen words
he paid a great tribute to the men
who are going to France. "This is a
high and holy hour. Today we are
one with the champions of democ
racy, Cromwell and Lafayette. We
are fighting for and are dedicated to
democracy at this hour."
"The soul of America is trium
phant," said William Bourne, presi
dent of the Friends of France soci
ety. "The flags of the Allies cannot
be furled until freedom is assured
in the world."
As the leaders of the California unit
of the American Ambulance Corps,
Brown and Krusi explained their pur
pose in going to France. Krusi stat
ed that "we go to assure France that
America is once again the comrade
in arms."
According to Mr. Bourne, Bruce
Porter is the real leader of the
Friends of France in his position as
vice-president. In his speech Porter
assured the units that the society was
behind them in every way.

of France by the Stanford and Cali
fornia volunteers. The following ex
cerpts from the speeches of the day
are expressive:
"We must join intimately and defi
nitely with France and England in
ihis war. We must fight on the bat
'tlefields of France in order to keep
from fighting upon the soil of the
United States." President Wilbur
made a great plea for universal and
intelligent service of every person in
the United States at the present time.
He states that we must send armed
men to follow the ambulance drivers.
''The future of California is in this
room," said the president in his in
troduction. "What are we going to
do with it? In the present war we
must expend our youth, but we must
expend it in the best way."
"My task is to speak of the men
who will follow you and protect you,"
said General Woodruff in speaking on
"The First Ten Thousand." He con
tinued with the statement that "this
is no time for hair-splitting over vol
unteer or universal service. In fact,
universal service is the only system
that will make our armies safe." He
spoke of the ten thousand officers
who are to be trained, 2500 of them
at the Presidio in San Francisco.
'"This is the finest method of raising
ofiicers that has ever been devised."
"I come to welcome these young
men on behalf of the workers in
France and Belgium. To us this is a
great mission of humanity." In in
troducing Mrs. Hoover Dean Barrows

er and the men and women who have
been in charge of relief in Belgium.
As the French consul-general in
San Francisco, the official representa
tive of France in the West, Neltner

"These men are going to support
democracy against autocracy, civiliza
tion against Kultur." With your help
the struggle will be successful," was
his concluding statement.
"These men go to follow in the foot
steps of Washington and Lafayette.
Our hearts go out with gratitude to
them for their mission. They go for
the cause of humanity. In fact the
whole nation is fighting to add the
star of humanity to our flag."
Due to the absence of the governor,
Arlett was the state representative at
the meeting. In well chosen words
he paid a great tribute to the men
who are going to France. "This is a
high and holy hour. Today we are
one with the champions of democ
racy, Cromwell and Lafayette. We
are fighting for and are dedicated to
democracy at this hour."
"The soul of America is trium
phant," said William Bourne, presi
dent of the Friends of France soci
ety. "The flags of the Allies cannot
be furled until freedom is assured
in the world."
As the leaders of the California unit
of the American Ambulance Corps,

pose in going to France. Krusi stat
ed that "we go to assure France that
America is once again the comrade
in arms."
According to Mr. Bourne, Bruce

behind them in every way.
Fifteen thousand people, completely filling the immense Civic Auditor

one Stanford men who leave next month for work in France with the
American Ambulance Field Service.

At the mention of the first Stanford
; unit, who were the first westerners
; to go to France to serve in the Ameri
' can Ambulance, wild enthusiasm was
I shown. Telegrams were read from
Henry D. Sleeper, in charge of the
service in New York and from New
ton I). Baker, secretary of war, as
well as others.
Following the speeches the twenty
one Stanford men who leave next
month for France were presented
with brassards on behalf of the
Friends of France society. They
were pinned on the left arm of each
man by Mrs. Hoover, Mrs. Bourne,
Mrs. C. M. Gayley, and Mrs. Beverley
MacMonagle.
Four American liags were dedicated
and will be carried to the battlefields
of France by the Stanford and Cali
fornia volunteers. The following ex
cerpts from the speeches of the day
are expressive:
"We must join intimately and defi
nitely with France and England in
ihis war. We must fight on the bat
'tlefields of France in order to keep
from fighting upon the soil of the
United States." President Wilbur
made a great plea for universal and
intelligent service of every person in
the United States at the present time.
He states that we must send armed
men to follow the ambulance drivers.
''The future of California is in this
room," said the president in his in
troduction. "What are we going to
do with it? In the present war we
must expend our youth, but we must
expend it in the best way."
"My task is to speak of the men
who will follow you and protect you,"
said General Woodruff in speaking on
"The First Ten Thousand." He con
tinued with the statement that "this
is no time for hair-splitting over vol
unteer or universal service. In fact,
universal service is the only system
that will make our armies safe." He
spoke of the ten thousand officers
who are to be trained, 2500 of them
at the Presidio in San Francisco.
'"This is the finest method of raising
ofiicers that has ever been devised."
"I come to welcome these young
men on behalf of the workers in
France and Belgium. To us this is a
great mission of humanity." In in
troducing Mrs. Hoover Dean Barrows
paid a great tribute to Herbert Hoov
er and the men and women who have
been in charge of relief in Belgium.
As the French consul-general in
San Francisco, the official representa
tive of France in the West, Neltner
thanked the future ambulance drivers.
"These men are going to support
democracy against autocracy, civiliza
tion against Kultur." With your help
the struggle will be successful," was
his concluding statement.
"These men go to follow in the foot
steps of Washington and Lafayette.
Our hearts go out with gratitude to
them for their mission. They go for
the cause of humanity. In fact the
whole nation is fighting to add the
star of humanity to our flag."
Due to the absence of the governor,
Arlett was the state representative at
the meeting. In well chosen words
he paid a great tribute to the men
who are going to France. "This is a
high and holy hour. Today we are
one with the champions of democ
racy, Cromwell and Lafayette. We
are fighting for and are dedicated to
democracy at this hour."
"The soul of America is trium
phant," said William Bourne, presi
dent of the Friends of France soci
ety. "The flags of the Allies cannot
be furled until freedom is assured
in the world."
As the leaders of the California unit
of the American Ambulance Corps,
Brown and Krusi explained their pur
pose in going to France. Krusi stat
ed that "we go to assure France that
America is once again the comrade
in arms."
According to Mr. Bourne, Bruce
Porter is the real leader of the
Friends of France in his position as
vice-president. In his speech Porter
assured the units that the society was
behind them in every way.
