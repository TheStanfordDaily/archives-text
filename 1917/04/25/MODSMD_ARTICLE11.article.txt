# FIFTEEN THOUSAND RALLY TO BID GODSPEED TO AMBULANCE UNITS
## Sixty-Three Stanford and U.C. Volunteers Accepted for Ambulance Service 
### 
Fifteen thousand people, completely filling the immense Civic Auditor
ium in San Francisco yesterday afternoon bid an enthusiastic farewell to
the forty-two California students who leave in a few days and the twenty
one Stanford men who leave next month for work in France with the
American Ambulance Field Service.
Speakers Express Loyalty.
The mass meeting of Californians was a whole-hearted expression of
loyalty to the nation in the hour of need, and this loyalty was amply re
flected in the speeches given by men prominent in public life. Both Presi-

dent Wilbur and Brigadier General
C. A. Woodruff, U. S. A., took the op
portunity to make a vigorous and
clear-cut appeal for the principle of
universal military service. A petition
expressing this idea was read near
the close of the assembly and was
unanimously adopted by a rising vote
of tlie vast assemblage. The expres
sion of opinion will be sent to Presi
dent Wilson in the form of a tele
gram.
Parade Precedes Ceremonies.
Preceding the ceremonies in the
auditorium Stanford and California
took part in one of the largest pa
rades that San Francisco has wit
nessed in many a day. Heading the
parade was a battalion of United
States infantry, followed by an equal
number of marines. Leading the fif
teen hundred cadets of the Univer
sity of California was the cadet band.
KMX) Stanford Men March.
One thousand Stanford men includ
ing practically every one out for in
tensive drill made the march up Mar
ket street from Spear to the Civic
Center. They were preceded by the
Stanford band.
The entire lower floor of the audi
! torium was reserved for the twenty
live hundred Stanford and California
i soldiers and friends of the two insti-
I tutions. The absence of Stanford
! women and faculty was amply made
up by a large number from the Ber
keley institution. The galleries were
j thrown open to the throng of citizens
who came to take part in the leave
; taking which had been arranged by
i the American League of California
and The Friends of France, who are
] sending over the two California units
| and the second Stanford unit to enter
! the American Ambulance service on
| the front.
