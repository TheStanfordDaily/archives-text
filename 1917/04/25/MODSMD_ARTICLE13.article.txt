# STANFORD'S SHARE
## 
### 
No Stanford man or woman who attended the preparedness parade and
rally in San Francisco yesterday could help but feeling just a tinge of
pride for the part played by the University. It is justifiable pride, too,
for though we would have it no other way, Stanford has already contrib
uted much to the common cause, and still has more to offer.
For the second time, the Friends of France bade farewell to a Stan
ford ambulance corps. The men who have gone into this service are sac
rificing much to do a worthy work. The craving for excitement and the
desire for excitement may be incidental factors, but these alone are not
sufficient incentives to persuade most men to take up a labor out of which
they get nothing but the joy of being identified with the great struggle for
liberty on the French front. We are glad that Stanford has had and will
have a hand in carrying the first American flags to France—the flags
which, in the words of Charles Mills Gayley, "go to save life and not to
take it."
Mrs. Hoover received an ovation which gives us another excuse to be
proud, if one were needed. The name of Hoover, linked with the name of
Stanford first put the University on the war map. Mrs. Hoover has shared
nobly the sacrifices of her husband.
Last and perhaps least, we may be proud of the showing made by the
Reserve Corps and the provisional companies. They will represented Stan
ford in the rank and file.

With Monday's issue of The Daily Palo Alto, Volume Fifty, will be
closed, except for the Commencement issue, which will be pub
lished May 21. A combination of both editorial and managerial cir
cumstances makes it necessary to omit the three papers which would or
dinarily have been published in May.
