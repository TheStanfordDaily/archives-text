A miracle has miracked, or what
ever such tilings do when they be
come active and throw off sparks.
And if you think the day of miracles
is past, listen. A play has been dis
covered in which there is a butler
and a maid and they don't get mar
ried at the end —they don't even make
love just after the headliners have
taken the nearest door to the garden
in the moonlight. Art Meinhard just
buttles in British fashion and Mary
Flowers overtaxes the brain under
her maid's cap doing arithmetic on the
amount it costs to go to Sioux City.
Undaunted by the domestic troubles
of the man who advertised in the clas
sified column but died before help
reached him, the Senior Farce Com
mittee began looking for the ideal
servants to employ in "A Full
House." And the result is joyful.
"Butch" Meinhard is such a perfect
specimen of British butlerhood that
you are not even troubled with the
idea that he would do anything so un
interesting as to turn out to be a
duke in the third act. Such perfect
butlerishness might, well be a model
for detectives who are not satisfied
with anything short of the flawless in
their disguises. ( Police Gazette please
