The Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
Relative to tlie editorial which ap
peared yesterday morning in tlie
Daily concerning the statement made
in the Sequoia about the Chaparral
loan, the intention of the Sequoia was
not to convey the idea that the Exec
utive Committee was seeking to make
such a loan, although this might have
Seemed to be the case last fall, it
was asked for by the Chaparral with
sanction of Dr. Wilbur. The Chap
arral offered and this fact was more
than emphasized in case the loan was
made to grant complete financial su
pervision to the Executive Committee
during the period of the loan. The
Executive Committee, however, ex
pressed itself willing to loan the
money only in case it could have
some control over the editorial pol
icy. This is no attempt to criticise
the Executve Committee for doing
this. That was their own business.
However, it can readily be seen that
such an arrangement was impossible
from the standpoint of the indepen
dence of the magazine, and free press.
The reference in the Sequoia to this
loan was meant in regard to editorial
and not financial control.
I thirfk that the editor, as a mem
ber of the Executive Committee, will
agree that this is a fair statement of
the case. I wish to thank the Daily
for calling attention to the matter,
as I should not have wanted the state
ment, to be misinterpreted.
