now awaiting daily the arrival of his

application for a commission has been
in for some time, and he is preparing
his business affairs for a departure at
a moment's notice.
Mr. Maloney served for seven years

oney's experience as a horseman and
a soldier will make him a valuable
man for the United States army.
