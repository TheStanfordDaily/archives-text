# Senior Ball to Be Held on Class Day
## Senior Week Dates Arranged Differently This Year to Avoid Rush 
### 
Friday, the ISth of May, is the one
big day that members of the Nineteen
Seventeen Class will dream of from
now until the end of the semester.
For the first time in the history of
Stanford Senior Weeks, the ball will
be held on Class Day, giving those
who follow the one-step through the
night, time to sleep on Saturday
morning way past the hour when pre
vious sleepy ball goers have found it
necessary to prop open their eyes and
pack their trunks. Such last-minute
rushing has always left a bad taste
in the mouths of those who returned
from senior ball and rushed for the
fust train home, and the Ninteen
Seventeen Class promises, above
everything else, that this ball will
not leave a bad taste with any one.
Another point in favor of this date
for the ball was found in the fact
that many would-be queeners are de
nied this privilege because of having
to leave the campus before the Mon
day of Commencement. This year
dates will be made for the first three
days, enabling those who must leave
early to take in the first three days, -
to enjoy the farce, the prom and ihe
ball.
The last days of the week will be
calm and sedate, befitting a senior who
is about to leave for the last time.
Baccalaureate and Commencement
will close festivities on Sunday and
Monday, services in the Memorial
Church to be in charge of the Rev.
Harry Emerson Fosdick of New Jer
sey.
