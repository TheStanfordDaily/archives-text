The following is a clipping from
the Scientific Journal:
"Recently a Japanese engineer
called upon us and discussed mining
matters. We suggested that among
other places of interest he should
visit the University of California. He
said: 'At Stanford.' We said em
phatically: 'No, the State University
is at Berkeley.' Oh,' he replied, 'I
thought the great University of Cali
fornia was at Stanford: is not that
the university from which Hoover
came?' We conceded the point with
mixed sentiments. Our visitor was a
man omnsight; the great university
is the one that produces great men.
He was right. To that we add that
a great university is one that makes
public opinion, that has no liking for
'listening leadership,' that is to the
front in national and epochal affairs.
Stanford has done that too.
