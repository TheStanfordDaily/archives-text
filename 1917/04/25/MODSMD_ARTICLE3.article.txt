# Army Hound Thrives on Buck Shot
## 
### 
The Waffle Hound, alias Aimless,
alias Amus, alias Jake, Piano Legs,
Underslung, Submarine, Dynamite,
and a hundred other things printable
and not, is still with us despite rum
ors to the effect that he was to be
thrown in the guard house for killing
University sheep. Buckshot has evi
dently no terrors for such a comfort
ably built dog. Bill, the shepherd,
gave Waffles a hint with his' twelve
gauge to hit the trail for some other
stamping grounds, but he seemed to
thrive on the treatment. Then some
one found the rightful heir to this
sprightly canine, and negotiated for
his withdrawal from the ranks of the
Stanford army. So far, however, he
has eluded all attempts to deprive him
of liberty.
Graduate Manager Behrens is still
plotting for his removal for fear he
will materially curtail his revenue
from farm products. Waffles, it
seems, is perfectly willing to spend
all his daylight hours, like a Southern
darky, following the music, but at
night he can't be trusted. If he turns
ui> missing some day, we'll know who
to blame.
The worst part of the whole affair
is that the dog's bona-flde, orthodox
name is just plain "Tige!"
