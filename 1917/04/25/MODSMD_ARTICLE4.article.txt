# How to See Show When Cash Is Low
## 
### 
Of course the movies are the most
economical thing to queen to. A
regular show means two dollar seats
and tickets to the city; that makes
six-fiftyâ€”well, it's pretty hard to
count so high. But suppose that you
could ask her to a regular show right
on the campus, at fifty cents per.
That saves carfare and a round at
Sticky's in one of these expensive
booths. And when you count up it
only cots two more dimes to take the
lady to hear Lucine Finch at the Little
Theater Thursday night than it would
to take her downtown the way any
body else can do.
Now, Lucine Finch is bound to
make you laugh, so if you want to
grit your teeth over the machinations
of the villain in the checked suit you
had better stay away. She tells you
frankly that in "dem days in the
Bible folks wore raiments, an' once
when de Lord called his cherriot wif
eteedses breathin* fiah and smoke, he
had to pull his clo'es up tight aroun'
him to keep from gettin' burned to a
fcindah in his own house." And
there's a heap more that the lady tells
us about "de Lord" and an attractive
miscellany of archangels and poten
tates and inhabitants of Eden. We
have a good deal to thank her negro
mammy for. Stories like that arc the
kind of thing that send sparkles and
Chuckles into a world that is wont to
look serious in these days. The only
sad thing about Thursday night is the
fact of that fifty cents. But there is
the Club House you know, and be
sides the thing you're getting is the
real article.
