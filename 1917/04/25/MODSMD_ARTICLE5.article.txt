tlio members of the varsity fencing
team to captain that organization (lur
ing the 1918 season. Kahle comes
front San Diego and is a member of
Encina Club. Due to his clever work
throughout the season, and his re
markable showing in the tournament
against California, in which he and
.1. D. Flint, gr., tied for first place
with the most bouts won by any man
of the Stanford team, Kahle has been
chosen to this position.
U it. Skelton, '17, is the outgoing
captain and it is largely due to bis
efforts that. Stanford has turned out
a winning team in 1917. Three of this
year's varsity men are nearly certain
to be on hand next semester to help
Captain Kahle form another victor
ious squad. They are R. O. Bullis,
