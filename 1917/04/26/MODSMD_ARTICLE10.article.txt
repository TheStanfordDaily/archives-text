# Women Discuss New Constitution Today
## 
### 
Stanford women will gather, this
morning, in a mass meeting at the
Little Theater at 11 o'clock, to discuss
the new constitution drawn up by a
committee of undergraduate women
for the Associated Women Students.
The committee is composed of Vaal
Stark, '17, chairman; Mary Post, '17,
Alice Williams, '18, Josephine Welch,
'IS, and Fanny Knox, '17.
At a previous mass meeting there
was much opposition by the members
of the "500" to the present system of
representation by houses, and the pro
visions to be submitted this morning
are expected to solve the difficulties.
