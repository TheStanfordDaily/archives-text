Few Have Applied.
Other than men who have already
made application for commissions in
the Reserve Officers' Corps, only
about ten men have signed up with
Major Bugge for training at the
camp. Since it is desirable to com
plete enrollment this week all can
didates who plan to enter the camp
should sign up immediately.
The old Reserve Officers' training
will be broken up for this semester
this morning. All the men will be
assigned to companies permanently
and a new assignment will be made
of all the battalions. In order to
even all the organizations up there
will be three battalions with four
companies to each making a full regi
ment.
If possible the new men will be
assigned to the sand tables and shoot
ing gallery under the Anatomy build
ing this afternoon and tomorrow
morning. All the companies have
been out through sighting exercises
and this is the next step in training.
During the morning, aside from re
organization, the companies will be
given review work under the new
conditions.
