Champion to I'lay.
According to Captain Allan Barber
there is to be a great aggregation of
class in the Olympic squad which will
come to the campus this Sunday, and
perhaps the most noted of which will
lie Strachan, former holder of the
Western clay court championship.
Strachan is almost in the same class
with McLaughlin. Johnston and Wil
liams. and is one of the young Cali
fornians who a few years ago opened
the eyes of the Easterners by their
speedy tennis. The others arc Clyde
Curley, the Oregon state champion,
Elmer Griflin, brother of one of the
present holders of the National dou
bles title, and William Marcus, a
prominent player of the bay region.
Straclian and H. L. Hahn, '16, will
furnish the feature match of the day,
and it has the prospects of being very
fast, as Hahn, always a dependable
player, has been going well lately.
The Cardinal will be represented in
the other matches by Captain Bar
ber, '18, V. D. Johns, '18, R. Holeman,
'18, C. Wolford, '18, and S. Chapman,
'16.
