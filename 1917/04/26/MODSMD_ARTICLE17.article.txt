# Lieutenant Explains Coast Boat Patrols
## 
### 
Lieut. C. W. Evans, recruiting offi
cer of the United States Federal Re
serve explained in detail last evening
before an audience in the Little The
ater all matters connected with the
coast motor boat patrol service
which is now being organized, by the
government.
In order to patrol the San Fran
cisco harbor alone 2500 men are need
ed, it being necessary to have at least
160 crews of fourteen men each, de
clared Lieutenant Evans.
Two classes of crews are being
formed, namely those to man the
small boats composed of a minimum
of seven men and those to take care
of the larger craft which shall be
composed of a minimum crew of 14
men.
Efforts will be made to keep men
who desire to enlist in the same crew
together, and every encouragement is
given to men to form their own
crews whenever possible*.
Enlistment means service for four
years in time of war but no service
in time of peace and when such a
state exists a man shall be honor
ably discharged upon his request.
To patrol the California coast only,
for submarines, to sweep waters for
mines, to lay mines and to patrol har
bors are a few of the duties outlined
by Lieutenant Evans which the motor
boats will perform.
Eighteen years is the minimum age
limit. With practically no experience
a man can qualify as a second sea
man.
Pay of the second seaman shall be
$20.60 a month in time of war and
$12 retainer in time of peace. Money
for uniforms amounting to $60 will
also be supplied in time of war.
As fast as a man shows he deserves
it he will be advanced until all the
higher positions are filled.
Those desiring further information
can obtain same from the coast pa
trol recruiting headquarters at 565
Market street, San Francisco.
