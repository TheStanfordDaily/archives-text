# Baseball Prospects Look Good for 1918
## Captain-Elect Stevens Thinks Stanford Will Have Strong Nine Next Season 
### 
After a careful examination of the
roster of the ball players who will he
on hand for the 1918 team, baseball
captain-elect Stevens issues the state
ment that next season's varsity will
be the best nine that has represented
Stanford in a number of years. As is
the case with everything else, it is
very hard to dope out what will hap
pen six months or a year from now.
In figuring baseball prospects, it will
have to be presumed that conditions
will be as they are now, when the
next year's diamond call conies.
Jloever Not ElitriliIc.
Big Gus Hoever will not be seen
on the firing line. He has pitched
the last game for the Cardinal, but
Hert Mattei is planning on returning
to college, and Draper and Lifur will
he on hand to till up the list of Stan
ford heavers. It is expected that
Lander will again be eligible for var
sity competition, and he will un
doubtedly play in Campbell's place
behind the plate. Wilcox will also
be available for catching duty.
Captain Doc Hayes will not return
to the University, and first, base will
probably be taken care of by Mitch
ell. Pike, the freshman captain, will
give him a hard battle for the berth.
Shriver, Cowan, Reagan and Stevens
will all be on hand to cover the in
field, with Galloway standing a
strong chance of nosing into a po
sition.
Few Outfielders.
In the outfield, Wilkins and Lilly
are scheduled for another season in
varsity suits. Of the freshmen, Way
land looks to be the best contender
lor a first team position.
Nothing has been determined as to
the coach for next year. Wilson will
undoubtedly handle the men during
the fall practice, but it is not known
whether lie will again lie signed up
to handle the ball tossers.
Graduate Manager Behrens is go
ing to make out a regular schedule
of games, and if the war does not
upset all intercollegiate sports the
1918 baseball season should be a suc
cessful one for the Cardinals.
