# Goodyear Co. Offers Jobs to "Farm" Men
## 
### 
That there are countless opportuni
ties for Stanford men during the sum
mer months, has again been demon
strated by the receipt of a letter by
President Wilbur from the Goodyear
Rubber Company, offering an unlim
ited number of positions to Stanford
men this summer.
According to the letter it must be
understood before hand that men who
apply will have no choice as to what
work they will do, and that this work
inay be anything from the construc
tion of a tire to the production of
mechanical goods.
New men will start at 32 1-2 cents
an hour and will work eight hours a
day, but when they become proficient
they will be put on piece work where
they may earn anywhere from three
to five dollars a day.
