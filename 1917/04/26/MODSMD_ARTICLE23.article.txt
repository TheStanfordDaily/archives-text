The Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
May I appeal to your readers to
help in a concerted effort to prevent
waste of food. The U. S. Department
of Agriculture reports that $700,000,-
000 worth of food is wasted in the
United States every year. The food
consumption in the entire city of New
York is about $500,000,000 worth each
year. This gives us some idea of the
relative amount which goes to waste.
While the men are doing their part
in drilling, woman can do an equally
patriotic work by eliminating any
waste for which she may be respon
sible.
When we can no longer boast that
"there is more where that came
from" we will have to learn how to
use cheaper foods, give up the frills,
clean our plates, and not send out a
slice of broad and butter to help All
the garbage can.
This is the great work for Stanford
women to do, and I know they will do
it well.
