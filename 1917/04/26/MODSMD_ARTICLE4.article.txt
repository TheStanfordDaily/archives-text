# Speakers Chosen for Oratorical Contest
## 
### 
ft. C. Binkley, '20, winner of the
Stanford Prohibition Oratorical Con
test, and W. E. Brenneman, '19, who
took the second prize, are the debat
ers chosen to represent Stanford in
the State Intercollegiate Prohibition
Oratorical Contest, which is to be
held in the Little Theater Friday
night. This will be the last debate
of the year scheduled to take place
at Stanford. However, providing one
of the Stanford orators wins first
place in next Friday's contest, he will
be entered in the Western Inter
state Prohibition Contest, which is to
be held in Los Angeles some time
during May.
Two men each from the University
of California and the San Francisco
Theological Seminary will oppose the
Stanford debators, so the contest
promises to hold many thrills, as far
as thrills go in debating. A prize of
fifteen dollars is fo be awarded the
winner, with ten dollars offered as a
bonus for second position. The first
speaker will go on the stand at eight
o'clock; everybody is welcome, no ad
mission fee being charged.
