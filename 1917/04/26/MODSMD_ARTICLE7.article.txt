## J. H. MEYER IS DONOR Twenty-One Men in Stanford Ambulance Corps Complete Organization 
### 
The second Stanford unit of the
American Ambulance Field Service,
which is to leave here for France
about May 25, is to have its own am
bulance in France, as the first unit
has.
Meyer Is Honor.
J. Henry Meyer, who has shown his
interest in Stanford many times, told
President Wilbur yesterday afternoon
just before Dr. Wilbur left San Fran
cisco, on his trip to Chicago, that he
would donate the $ 1 GOO needed to pur
chase an ambulance and maintain it
for a year of service, in honor of the
twenty-one Stanford men who re
ceived their brassards from the
Friends of France Tuesday in San
Francisco.

The ambulance will be presented to
the American Ambulance Field Ser
vice by Mr. Meyer, as that in honor
of Professor Pellissier was donated
by members and friends of the Uni
versity. This ambulance was put in
to service on March IG, and is being
driven by J. H. Eastman, leader of
the first unit. The new ambulance
will probably be named for Mr.
Meyer.
Mr. Meyer is a San Francisco bank
er who lives in Menlo Park, and has
been a frequent benefactor of the
University. He has shown his inter
est particularly in connection with
the Lane Library of the medical
school.
In October of this college year he
established the "J. Henry Meyer En
dowment Fund in Memory of Antoine
Borel," a foundation of something
more than $6000, the income of which
is to be used by the University for
the purchase, collection and publica
tion of original sources of Califor
nia history. This fund is in honor
of Mr. Meyer's friend and business
partner, who died two .vears ago, and ,
represents the fee Mr. Meyer re- |
ceived for acting as executor of the
will of Mr. Borel.
Stanford's first representatives in
the American Ambulance Service in
France are at Verdun according to
advices received yesterday. A post
card from .J. H. Eastman, '18, leader
of the unit, states that the men were |
in sight of the objective of the Ger- i
man Crown Prince for the last two I
years. This would indicate the Ver-1
dun sector.
Several letters have been sent by |
the ambulance drivers from the front j
but due to the censorship established I
over all messages from the battle |
lines no indication has been given of I
the location of "Unit 14."
Mail received lately indicates that
the men have seen real fighting al
ready. One letter speaks of the aero
plane duels. "We were astounded at
the exhibition of daring at the Expo
sition in San Francisco but were
treated to duels of flyer against flyer
with anti-aircraft guns shooting at
both every few hours here."
Ambulance men of the University of
California will be lodged in historic
quarters when they arrive in Paris,
according to the latest reports. It is
a famous old house donated to the
French government by a countess,
and was once the property of Benja
min Delessert, the noted philosopher
whom Napoleon decorated with the
Legion of Honor. From its porch
Franklin Hew his famous kite, and
Bartholdi, the sculptor of the Statue
of Liberty, once made it his home.
Permanent officers for the second j
unit were named last night at a meet- j
ing of the ambulance drivers. Clem
ens J. Randau was unanimously j
chosen leader, and Frank J. Taylor
will be secretary-treasurer. Articles j
of organization for the unit were I
drawn up and unanimously adopted.
The squad will have a picture taken
at "Pop" Franklin's Friday at one
o'clock.

Ambulance men of the University of

according to the latest reports. It is
a famous old house donated to the
French government by a countess,
and was once the property of Benja

whom Napoleon decorated with the

Franklin Hew his famous kite, and
Bartholdi, the sculptor of the Statue

Permanent officers for the second j

Meyer Is Honor.
J. Henry Meyer, who has shown his
interest in Stanford many times, told
President Wilbur yesterday afternoon
just before Dr. Wilbur left San Fran
cisco, on his trip to Chicago, that he
would donate the $ 1 GOO needed to pur
chase an ambulance and maintain it
for a year of service, in honor of the
twenty-one Stanford men who re
ceived their brassards from the
Friends of France Tuesday in San
Francisco.

The ambulance will be presented to
the American Ambulance Field Ser
vice by Mr. Meyer, as that in honor
of Professor Pellissier was donated
by members and friends of the Uni
versity. This ambulance was put in
to service on March IG, and is being
driven by J. H. Eastman, leader of
the first unit. The new ambulance
will probably be named for Mr.
Meyer.
Mr. Meyer is a San Francisco bank
er who lives in Menlo Park, and has
been a frequent benefactor of the
University. He has shown his inter
est particularly in connection with
the Lane Library of the medical
school.
In October of this college year he
established the "J. Henry Meyer En
dowment Fund in Memory of Antoine
Borel," a foundation of something
more than $6000, the income of which
is to be used by the University for
the purchase, collection and publica
tion of original sources of Califor
nia history. This fund is in honor
of Mr. Meyer's friend and business
partner, who died two .vears ago, and ,
represents the fee Mr. Meyer re- |
ceived for acting as executor of the
will of Mr. Borel.
Stanford's first representatives in
the American Ambulance Service in
France are at Verdun according to
advices received yesterday. A post
card from .J. H. Eastman, '18, leader
of the unit, states that the men were |
in sight of the objective of the Ger- i
man Crown Prince for the last two I
years. This would indicate the Ver-1
dun sector.
Several letters have been sent by |
the ambulance drivers from the front j
but due to the censorship established I
over all messages from the battle |
lines no indication has been given of I
the location of "Unit 14."
Mail received lately indicates that
the men have seen real fighting al
ready. One letter speaks of the aero
