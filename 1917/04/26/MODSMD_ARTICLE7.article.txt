Meyer Is Honor.
J. Henry Meyer, who has shown his
interest in Stanford many times, told
President Wilbur yesterday afternoon
just before Dr. Wilbur left San Fran
cisco, on his trip to Chicago, that he
would donate the $ 1 GOO needed to pur
chase an ambulance and maintain it
for a year of service, in honor of the
twenty-one Stanford men who re
ceived their brassards from the
Friends of France Tuesday in San
Francisco.

The ambulance will be presented to
the American Ambulance Field Ser
vice by Mr. Meyer, as that in honor
of Professor Pellissier was donated
by members and friends of the Uni
versity. This ambulance was put in
to service on March IG, and is being
driven by J. H. Eastman, leader of
the first unit. The new ambulance
will probably be named for Mr.
Meyer.
Mr. Meyer is a San Francisco bank
