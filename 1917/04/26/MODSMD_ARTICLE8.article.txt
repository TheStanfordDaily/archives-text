# Creation Story to Be Told in Dialect
## Lucine Finch Will Describe All the Folks "Menchified" in the Bible 
### 
| When people begin passing a story
1 on by word of mouth it is hound to
| grow alarmingly, so that the original
perpetrator would hardly recognize
it. And when Lucine Finch's negro
mammy began embroidering details
on to the Bible stories she made a
thorough job of it. From the simple
| straightforward narrative of how "de
Lo'd made outer some clay de sem
bla'ge of a man wif de legs 'tach on
to it" to the highly colored accounts
iof the grandeur of Pharaoh in "his
| raimen's trimmed wi' vermin" we are
treated the most frilly version of the
i oldest stories that most of us have
I ever met with.
, Entertains in Little Theater.
This evening will find her in the
! Little Theatre sitting in a big chair
jon the stage taking us into her con-
I fidence in the most winning fashion
i while she winds tales about all the
folks "menchified in de Uible." And
her songs—they are by turns weird
and rollicking. She sings them with
out accompaniment in her clear, true
voice. She is dramatic without be
ing actressy.
And then there remains the inevita
ble "menchiflcation" of the necessary
fifty cents. That is all that must be
remembered, except that the story
teller will be in her seat before the
velvet curtain of the Little Theater
at eiubt o'clock.
