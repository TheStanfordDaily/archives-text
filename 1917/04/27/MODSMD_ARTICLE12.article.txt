# Have You Ever
## 
### 
Have you ever noticed that half the
men in the world are youngsters at
heart? They are happiest when
eating, and .want to be noticed,
petted and humored.
Have you ever noticed that the men
who admire you most are the ones
whom you encourage to talk about
themselves, with your approving
and believing all they say?
Have you ever noticed that clothes do
make the man—in his own eyes, at
least? Those who wear the mili
tary trappings from the most ob
scure Senior to the lowliest Frosh,
now stride about with the studied
grace of the man who is being con
stantly observed by the public eye,
and each feels himself of the ut
most importance to Woodrow Wil
son and the U. S. A.
Have you ever noticed that you lose
a friend when you congratulate an
"Intensive" because he has escaped
the dread finals? "Would that 1
had more exes to give up for my
country! Sic semper the Kaiser!!"
he replies with choler.
Have you ever noticed that all the
big. "authoritative" men who ac
cuse most of the "500" of trans
planting their brains to their pedal
extremities, encourage this very
transposition by queening these
characters while the /Phi Betsies
and the near Phi Betsies remain at
home, "unwept, unhonored and un
sung"?
Have you ever noticed that the most
"democratic" of men will invaria
bly choose a dry Row Peach to a
fresh Roble Prune? "The rank is
but the guinea's stamp." But—"a
man's a Man for a' that."
