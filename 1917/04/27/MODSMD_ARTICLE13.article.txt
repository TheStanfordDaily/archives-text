othy Metz, '17.
The constitution provides lor rep
resentation from the living groups,
one representative from each duly or
ganized fraternity or house club, four
representatives from Roble, two from
Madrono, and provides further for
representatives from the unorganized
students. It states that the confer

their number from whom shall be
elected by the women-at-large, the
president of the conference, who shall
also be president of the council, vice
president of the conference, ex-officio

It was voted to do away with this
plan and as a substitute to provide
for ten nominations by the confer
ence, nominees to be not necessarily
taken from among the members of
conference, but that the newly elect
ed council members shall automati
cally become members of conference.
An additional proposition was sub
mitted providing for, in addition to
the ton nominees named by the con
ference, nominees not exceeding five
to be made by any woman in the Uni
versity.
These two schemes will be put be
fore the women students for a vote
on the quad the early part of next

tirety will be submitted at a later
