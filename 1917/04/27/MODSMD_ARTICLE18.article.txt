Today's issue is not intended to be a regular newspaper, but a cam
pus dope sheet. We do not mean to beat the Quad to it, but we feel that
enough military drill and seriousness has been given to the campus public
of late to insure a change of diet for at least one day. The women of the
Daily Palo Alto staff hereunto set their hand and seal that they are alone
responsible for this edition.

This will be the only opportunity for the members of the "500" to wish
the men of the Second Ambulance Unit a bon voyage and Godspeed. It

June 6 when they sail from New York.
"To us this is a great mission of humanity," are the words of Mrs.
Hoover. We are proud of every man and, must we say it, a bit envious of
their opportunity. We wish that we could be at the dock to grasp the
hand of each and everyone and to wish them the best of luck.
