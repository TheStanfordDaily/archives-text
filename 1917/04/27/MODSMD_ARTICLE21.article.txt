Intensified soldiering was resumed
at 8 o'clock yesterday morning with
all present and accounted for after
a vacation—or "furlough," in military
parlance—of one and one-half days.
The Wednesday evening lecture,
called off because of the indisposi
tion of Major Bugge, was a source of
great disappointment to a large num
ber of the men who returned, from
San Francisco especially for the lec
ture.
Nevertheless the majority brought
back from the great city, besides
other things, slightly darker blotches
upon the upper lips. More joyous
spirits also accompanied the major
ity. For that day and one-half, men
took back what they said the week
before, "Give me back my hard law
courses; this intensive stuff is worse
than war, and you know what war
is."
Reorganization of the entire com
mand yesterday necessitated again
the now accustomed slippin' into the
time-worn cords, the blue, grey, or
khaki shirts. And nature helped a
bit, by tinting the faces a more bril
liant hue. And so it was that the
men wearing the best clothes, having
been confined to the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps before, were disband
ed and put at the head of the other
companies.
Major Bugge, now being satisfied
that the new men know which end
of the gun shoots, will now teach the
men just where that end shoots in
the new rifle range under the Anat
omy building. The attempts to se
cure targets from the government
have so far been unsuccessful, but the
Major still hopes to receive them so
that the practice may be held in out
door ranges under natural conditions.
