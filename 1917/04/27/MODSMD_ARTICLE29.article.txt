# Hichborn Lectures on Liquor Problem
## NOTED ALUMNUS WHO STARTED AS NEWSPAPER REPORTER IS NOW AUTHORITY 
### 
Franklin Hichborn, ex-'{)s, ad
dressed the class in "Social Aspects
of the Modern Liquor Problem." He
is a Stanford man of the early days
of the University who started his
career as a newspaper reporter and is
now considered to be California's best
versed man on politics. Mr. Hich
born had much to do with lighting up
the graft situation in San Francisco
several years ago. He is. the author
of "The System" and also of the
Legislative Reports which have kept
the people of California well informed
on the actions taken by the State leg
islature since 1909.
Mr. Hichborn says that, the legisla
ture has no method of going at the
liquor problem. Separate acts dating
from 1855 to the present make up the
history of liquor legislation in Cali
fornia. The first acts provided for
one and two mile dry zones around
State prisons, reformatories, Sailors'
and Soldiers' Homes, the University
of California and Stanford Univer
sity. In 1909 a local option bill was
introduced, but the right of consider
ation of the liquor question was given
to the supervisorial districts rather
than to the township. From then un
til the present the saloon interests
and wine interests have been fighting
various acts which have been intro
duced. Under present consideration
are the Ashley bill and the Rominger
bill.
