# FRANKIE
## 
### 
Formerly in times of peace
Round the office was a man,
And his coat had not a crease, ..
Neat his boots were, spick and span.
Kinda changed since war began.
Little cares he now for trifles
Even for a spotless shoe.
All he shines today are rifles,
Ragged sweaters now will do
Drilling, and for Daily, too.
Still to show our recognition
We dedicate to Frankie our edition.
