interest will be that of Miss Edith 1
Harvey, '17, and W. G. Paul, *15. Al- j
though the couple daily receive the
congratulations of their friends, no j
formal announcement will be made |

ble Paul is having in getting posses- |
sion of some love letters written some ;
time ago to a chorus girl. He has a j
lawyer on the track of the strategic
documents and hopes to get out of j
the difficulty without being black- j
mailed.

take place on May 16. Among those
who will be present at the party will

guests there ought to be "A Full j
House" on May 16. (You knew we
were talking about that all along?
Well, why did you read clear down to
here, then?)
