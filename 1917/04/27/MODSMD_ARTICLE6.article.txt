# To Train or to Measle That Is the Question
## 
### 
There is more than one way of
evading the hard labors of intensive
training, the only difficulty being the
expense, according to a certain house
on the campus. A fortunate brother
was removed to the isolation hospital
with measles, leaving many envious
brothers behind him. Rut little did
he dream as he tossed to and fro on
his hard cot at the hospital that his
downy bed at home was being auc
tioned off to the highest bidderâ€”or
rather that the privilege of sleeping
in his bed was being sold. That night
with his pocket $8 lighter a brother
cuddled in the deserted bed and hope
fully inhaled measle germs, dropping
off to dreamland with rosy dreams of
seven days of freedom.
