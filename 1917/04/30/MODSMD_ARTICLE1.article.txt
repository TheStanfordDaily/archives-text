the first month. For the last two
months the recruits will be divided

The plans, as a result, will provide a
set of officers in a regiment who are
acquainted with each other.

the Reserve Officers Training Corps

made application for training at the
camp. This number will probably in

most difficult yet attempted, and as a

to advices sent out by the House
Military Committee yesterday. Con
gressman Kahn, from San Francisco,
a member of this committee, made
this announcement following the pas
sage of the Selective Conscription

May S proved too soon to complete
arrangements for the camp, and the
date for the beginning of training has
been changed to May 15 by authori
ties of the war department. As a re
sult of this change enrollments for
the camp will be made up to and in
cluding May 1. Some four thousand
names have already been handed in,
however, and further applications
should be made to Major Bugge and
physical examinations taken at once.
Men who have already made appli
cation for commissions in the Re
serve Officers Training Corps at
sidio, according to announcements
sent out by the war department. One
of the men who sent in his application
some two months ago received a
notice Saturday to supersede all other
notices to this effect. The statement
said that "you will receive your com
mission as soon as possible" and
further that "you may not have to
attend the camp at the Presidio." This
means that several men who have
made arrangements to attend the
camp will be given their commission
before the camp begins.
Present plans for training at the
Presidio camp call for general drill
the first month. For the last two
months the recruits will be divided
into infantry, cavalry, and artillery
branches. Companies will be as
signed and when the final officers are
selected the officers for one regiment
will be selected from a company.
The plans, as a result, will provide a
set of officers in a regiment who are
acquainted with each other.
Some hundred and fifty men from
the Reserve Officers Training Corps
and the intensive training corps have
made application for training at the
camp. This number will probably in
crease considerably with the an
nouncement of pay for college men
at the camp, and the changing of the
date to May 15th.
Intensive training with the passage
of the selective conscription bill by
Congress has assumed increased im
portance, and Major Bugge is plan
ning to increase the pace during the
last weeks. Saturday's work was the
most difficult yet attempted, and as a
result several men fainted at the con
clusion of the morning.
Students attending the Officers' Re
