The contest was all Stanford from
the outset. Gus Hoever started on
the mound and heaved excellent ball.
The only runs gathered by the fann
ers were in the first inning, when
Mitchell and Stevens dropped pop
flies. Draper relieved Hoever in the
fifth and hurled the rest of the game.
Campbell was behind the plate, but
was forced to retire when a wild
throw split his hand. Captain "Doc"
Hayes was forced to fill in as
catcher, Joe Rraden taking the skip
per's place on first.
Shriver at second, Cowan on short,
and Stevens at third completed the
infield. Wilkins, Lilly and Mitchell
occupied the gardens.
Three hits by Campbell and Hoever
featured the contest. One of Camp

other for two and the third for one.
Hoever's bingles were all singles.
