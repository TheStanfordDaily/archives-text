# INTO LIFE'S SCHOOL

### 
Stanford's year is fast drawing to an end—an end which differs so
from the ordinary as to make us doubt whether this is really Stanford
after all. Perhaps nowhere so much as about universities do traditions —
good and bad —grow up; nowhere are they held more sacred. It is this
which gives war the semblance of a heavier hand when laid on a campus.
Sudden changes create a greater shock in communities which ordinarily
change least. The outside world must, in many of its phases, remain the
world it was before the declaration of war. With us it is different, since
we are but preparing for the greater struggle and have little which can
not, if necessary, adjust itself to meet the present crisis. Still the change
is none the less hard to realize.
The class of 1917 entered Stanford while the world was yet sane. It
now goes out to face a world mad with war—to face conditions new to a
graduating class of this institution. Not a very happy time to begin a life
work! Many of us go without making the formal bow of farewell which
seemed so essential when we were freshmen. This is unfortunate, but
after all it has not the significance we expected.
Even should it be a matter of considerable disappointment to some of
us if we can not formally "commence," there is compensation in the
knowledge that such a ceremony adds nothing to the value of service which
we may offer the nation. We are fortunate to be graduating at this time
if, as is expected, our training here has developed us into men and women
from whom leaders may be chosen. The talents are ours. We can do with
them what we will!
