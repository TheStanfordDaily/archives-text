## 
### 
Stanford will usher the first official
ly designated Stars and Stripes to the
front in France through the efforts
6f Arthur C. Kimber, '18, who left for
New York Friday evening. Kimber
is a member of the second Stanford
unit, but is going to Paris early. He
carries with him the flag dedicated
for the first unit's use last Tuesday.
Originally it was planned to send
the flag over with the two California
units. However, Kimber's trip will
mean that the flag can reach Verdun
before the rivals from across the bay
are in the field at all, thus bringing
to Stanford the singular honor of fly
ing the first Old Glory over her unit
hi the Great War.
