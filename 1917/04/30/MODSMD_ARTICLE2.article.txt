By overwhelmingly defeating the
Stanford tennis team yesterday, the
Olympic Club racqueters annexed
first place in their division of the
league and will play the winner of
the other league section, which will
probably be the Oakland Tennis Club,
in the near future. Stanford will in
all probability rank third in the
league.
Nine straight wins out of nine
matches was the bloody toll exacted
by the Olympians in the last play of
the season, not a single contest being
won by the Stanford men.

Strachan and the present state doub
