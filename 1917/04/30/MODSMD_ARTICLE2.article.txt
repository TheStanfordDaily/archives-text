## Olympic Racqueters Overwhelm Varsity Nine Straight Wins Give Club Men First in Division of Tennis League

Stanford tennis team yesterday, the
Olympic Club racqueters annexed
first place in their division of the

won by the Stanford men.
This year's Olympic tennis team

gether on the Pacific Coast, the pres
ent state singles champion, Johnnie
Strachan and the present state doub
les champions, Strachan and W. Mar
