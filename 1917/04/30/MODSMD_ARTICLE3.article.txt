## Professor Tests Muscles of Stanford Intensives 
### 
University military men now have a
chance to discover how their muscles
stand the strain of seven hours of
hard labor. Professor E. G. Martin
of the Physiology Department is con
ducting a number of tests on the sol
diers to discover how much they are
fatigued after the all-day drill. So
far each intensive has only been
tested for one day, once before drill
and once after, but next week Dr.
Martin will put half a dozen men
through the tests for a number of
days.
