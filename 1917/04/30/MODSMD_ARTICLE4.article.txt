# 1918 Quad Best Stanford Annual Ever Published
## 
### Anita Allen 
A diagnosis of this year's Quad
shows undeniable symptoms of the
use of two elements in its making—
brain and heart. It takes brain to
get harmony and organization into a
conglomerate mass of facts, and there
is a big dose of heart in any book
that shows the signs of care in little
things, the absence of indiscriminate
"filler," and the rare taste in the
color work.
Cuts Best Ever.
Good cuts and intelligent combina
tions of the alphabet between cuts
make the 1918 Quad a real book. The
college year section treats of every
thing from the football vote to the
Alpha Phi fire, and it proves more
than an occasional photographic oasis
in a desert of printed inanity. It is
actually fun to read.
Publications are given good treat
ment, although the unsigned sum
maries of the work and policies of
our four periodicals bore the unmis
takable signature of the partisan. Is
it quite fair to the classes to come,
who really won't know, to make them
think that Chappie decisively eclipses
the Illustrated Review in sanity and
honesty of editorial policy?
All the activities of the Quad-world
have received the touch that makes
them kin. The debating write-ups are
actually interesting reading to others
than debaters; minor sports are treat
ed with something more than a per
functory "Oh. these things have to go
in." The military divisions is some
thing that any editor might well be
proud of. Major sports are intelli
gently handled, and the cuts that the
juniors have hunted down do more
than fill their conventional places.
They invite you to pause over them
again and yet again. They are clear,
full of action, and supplied with cap
tains that provoke more than one ap
preciative grin.
This year's joshes show more than
an elementary conception of humor.
Their test is that they bear rereading.
The department is not one blaze of
perfection by any means, but the ver
dict can well afford to be, "Good
stuff." Dramatics suffer from the
amateurish in reviewing. The write
ups offer a hoary array of adjectives
and are afflicted with particularly bad
attacks of "delicate," "artistic," "im
posing," "elaborate," "charming" and
their ilk.
Color plates in this book are the
finest ever. They are worthy of
framing and a glance at any one of
them in someone's else possession
should be enough to make any of us
break the tenth commandment on the
spot. To sum up, five words will
cover the whole thing. This year's
Quad shows itself possessed of—good
sense and good taste.
The Quad will be ready for delivery
Thursday.
