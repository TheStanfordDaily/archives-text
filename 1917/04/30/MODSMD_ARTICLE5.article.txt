# Order Commencement D.P.A. NOW.
## Holds A Full House-Will Draw May 9 
### 
Since the advent of military, poker
seems to be a lost art. Now, if you
had a full house, you'd just shut up
and say you weren't thinking of draw
ing just now, wouldn't you? The
seniors are working on other prin
ciples. They have "A Full House"
that ought to prove a winner, one that
is mostly queens. But instead of
staying pat they are going to scatter
pasteboards to all parts of Hall and
Row and land a big draw to their full
house. They're going to make it two
of a kindâ€”the tirst time in the his
tory of the university that there have
been two full houses under the As
sembly Hall roof.
So if you want to see Dick John
ston stand up and inquire in a yell of
Mary Flowers, "Which is your good
ear, anyway?" you want to be with
all the regular folks at the usual time
and place a week from Wednesday
when the drawing for seats will take
place at the Bookstore and Weingart
ner's.
