## Ambulance Drivers Prepare for France Take Up Courses in Intensive French and Ford Driving 
### 
Stanford's second unit of ambulance
drivers for the French front is busy
in preparation for service. The men,
who leave here about the end of May,
are taking up an intensive study of
French and Fords, in special classes,
to be as fit as possible to meet de
mands in France.
The special French class has been
started to train the men in everyday
speaking. Practice on Fords has been
possible through the efforts of the
Spring Valley Water Works of San
Francisco. John A. Sellards has
charge of the French classes.
Third Unit Organizing.
A third unit of ambulance drivers,
to leave during the summer for
France, is being organized. Already
many men have signed up with the
President's secretary for this unit,
and prospects are that competition
for membership in it will be as keen
as for the second unit. This unit will
also be backed by the Friends of
France Society. Further applicants
should turn in their names at once
at the President's office.
Personal equipment for the men in
the second unit will lie secured at
wholesale cost, through the generos
ity of Wideman & Son of Palo Alto
and Stanford, and the C. A. Malm &
Company of San Francisco. Wide
man's will furnish clothes, while the
Malm company has offered leather
goods and trunks.
Arrangements are being made for
stopovers in the east and along the
coast for the boys who leave for
France. This gives an opportunity
for many of them to have time at
home before leaving the country.
