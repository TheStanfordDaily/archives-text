The University Platoon
is beinj; raised by the
University of British Columbia
to reinforce the 196 th WESTERN UNIVERSITIES BAT
TALION of Canada, whose members have proved their heroism
on the Somme, at Vimy Ridge and at Fresnoy. The ranks of
Canadian students are now almost depleted of their fighting' men.
AMERICANS joining Canadian units enjoy exactly the
same rights as Canadians in the matter of pay, pensions, separa
tion allowances, promotions and honors. Men of the universi
ties, schools and colleges, who have no assurance of getting to
the front with their own regiments in time to strike their blow
for democracy and freedom, would be welcomed into the Uni
versity Platoon. They would enjoy the congenial companion
ship of educated men, who are willing to make sacrifices and
fight for principles.
No commissions are granted now in the Canadian army ex
cept to men who have made good on the field of battle. But
members of the platoon will attend officers' training schools or
follow other specialized courses at the battalion base at Bram
shott, England. Thus they will be qualified for such appoint
ments as their conduct under fire shall merit.
The University Platoon should appeal especially to Brit
ishers and Canadians now resident in the United States.
As these reinforcements are preparing to go overseas about
THE END OF THIS MONTH OF MAY, application should
be made immediately by mail or in person to The Officer Com
manding, 196 TH Reinforcements, University of British
Columbia, Vancouver.
