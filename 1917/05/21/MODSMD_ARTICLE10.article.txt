# SENIOR FARCE IS LAST LAUGH OF YEAR
## A
						FULL HOUSE SCORES Mary Flowers and R.L. Johnston Share Headline Honors Wednesday Night 
### 
To be called everything from a
Hungarian goulash to a walking
crime, to look as ugly as possible,
and to act like an imbecile, is a good
deal to ask of a pretty girl. But
Mary Flowers did it in "A Full
House." And any recording angel
that may live in the echoes of the As
sembly Hall will put Susie on the
side of the book saved to record Act
ingâ€”with a capital A. We don't very
often find that sort of thing in a sen
ior farce.
Hut the bouquets won't miss fire if
they hit others than Susie. There
was Dick Johnston in a part that
gave him a chance at last. He made
Nicholas King the kind of crook that
it is a joy to know, the kind that it
would he a sacrilege to let mere po
liceman catch, a most winning, but
undeniably crooked cook. The mere
policeman, however, in the hands of
Jack Russell, B. B. Robinson and Red
Houser stamped and roared a good
many laughs into the evening.
As Ned Pembroke, with aunt and
sweetheart and chorus lady fairly
tumbling over each other to add to
his troubles, Blondv Paul was a joy.
The only thing that was more pleas
ing than his bubbling fun was his re
current state of distress. And then
there was Parks, the precise, the per
fect, played most capably by Art
Meinhard. It must have taken a
course of the most intensive British
ing to turn out such a product. Bay
Murray as George Howell gave that
harassed and misunderstood individ
ual a character that makes you doubt
if all the awful things said about the
race of lawyers are really true after
Tears were rather the order of the
day for all the ladies in "A Full
House." But they gave Florence
Mason the chance to show that she
could cry and look pretty at the same
time. Her part did not give her much
to thank the author of the play for,
but she made the most of its teari
ness. Fdith Harvey, besides weeping,
was allowed some fun in luring the
unwary Ned into the net of impend
ing matrimonv and she filled her in
genue requirements well.
As the aunt. Esther Liversidge
showed that she can lo other things
well besides the role of chic heroine.
Margaret Evans, Thurlyne Buffum
and Elizabeth Kelly helped in the
last, act to make the house fuller than
ever and contributed very successful
ly their respective quotas of flippan
cy, stridency and Lady-Bountifulness.
