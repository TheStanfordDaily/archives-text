# Challenge of Today Is Topic of Sermon
## Dr. Foscick Urges Self-Sacrifice in Meeting Present Crisis 
### 
"The Challenge of the Present
Crisis" was the subject of the Bacca
laureate sermon delivered yesterday
in the Memorial Church uy Dr. Harry
Emerson Fosdick of New York. He
defined this challenge as calling for
social faith, religious vision, and per
sonal self-sacrifice, and said, in part:
"The first question for any individ
ual and any social group to .answer
when faced by a perilous and dillicult
situation is whether that situation is
going to be regarded as a challenge
to strength or as a cause of despair.
"There are solid reasons why a
man may accept the present crisis as
a challenge. For one thing, the fac
tors which make this war the most
terrible one in history are the new
family relations of the races, bound
together by telegraph, telephone,
steamship lines, railroads, wireless,
until when war was declared in
Europe, food prices in Siam went up
100 per cent. A family fight is al
ways the worst, and the last genera
tion has made the world a family in
fact, though not in spirit. Hut who
even for the horror of this war would
give up the factors which make its
widespread horror possible? They
are the very factors on which all our
hopes of racial solidarity and interna
tional unity depend. We are fighting
this war on the way up, not on the
way down. Give us time and we
shall use the new interdependence of
the world for fraternity and not for
war."
