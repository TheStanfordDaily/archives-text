# ILLUSTRATED AND ALUMNUS JOIN FORCES
## WILL BROADEN SCOPE Board of Students and Alumni to Control the New Publication 
### 
Plans for amalgamation of the
Stanford Illustrated Review and the
Alumnus have been practically com
pleted, and the two publications will
be made into one next semester. The
name of the new publication is not
decided, but a committee from both
the Review and the Alumnus are
working out details on the editorial
side.
The combined Review-Alumnus pub
lication will be a magazine of discus
sion much after the Review type, with
more attention to broad and ad
vanced articles. It will be run by
an editorial board of three students
and three alumni, and will have a
staff separate from this.
In general make-up the magazine
will probably follow the Review's
style more than that of the Alumnus.
Much of the alumni news will here
after be printed in the Stanford Palo
Alto News, which will become more
of a weekly college paper, summariz
ing the news.
The amalgamation of the Review
and the Alumnus is looked upon with
much favor by men and women in
Stanford journalistic circles, as the
possibilities of the publication are
great. Men on the staffs of both pub
lications look forward to seeing it
the greatest college publication in the
west. Combination will be a mater
ial relief to the advertising situation
for Stanford publications.
The board in charge of final plans
for the amalgamation is E. W. Smith,
Alumnus editor; J. E. McDowell,
manager; F. J. Taylor, '18, H. W.
Frantz, '18, and P. C. Wohlford. '18.
