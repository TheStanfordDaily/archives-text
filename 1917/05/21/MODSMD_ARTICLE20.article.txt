# UNCLE SAM CALLS STUDENTS TO PRESIDIO
## Stanford Represented in Many Branches of Army and Navy 
### 
Senior week activities assumed a
war tinge from the first. The train
ing camp at the presidio, the Ameri
can ambulance service and various
other lines of activity have claimed
many men and have brought to the
campus the fact that the 1917 com
mencement may be the last gathering
for many Stanford students.
The largest delegation of men from
the University is found at the Pre
sidio training camp in San Francisco
where some fifty students are prepar
ing to officer the troops who will first
see service in France.
At the Presidio are E. R. Ames,
'18, senior class president; N. R. Al
len, '18, F. C. McColloch, '17, G. C.
Collins, '17, T, L. Dyer, '17, R. A. Grif
fin, '17. W. F. Horner, *17, G. K. How
ard, '17, F. J. Leard, '17, L. C. Ste
vens, '15, D. K. Ferguson, '18 J. M.
Coman, 'IS, .T. H. Stearn, '18, W. G.
Hall, '19.
Through President Wilbur two men
of the graduating class have received
permanent appointments in the Ma
rine Corps. The two inon who were
chosen are R. S. Lytle, '17, and J. C.
Wood, '10. These appointments are
not for Reserve Officers commissions
but for the regulars.
The aviation corps has claimed the
interest of several men. A regular
class has been conducted at the
school in Redwood and in addition
H. R. Kelley, '15, has received ap
pointment as first lieutenant in the
Reserve Officer's Section.
Several students have enlisted in
the coast patrol service both of the
Pacific and Atlantic coasts. Two men
from the University are with Com
pany L of the* California National
Guard from Palo Alto while others
are enrolled in the ranks of the mi
litia from other states.
The Marine Corps Reserve and
special commissions in the Marine
Corps of the Navy are claiming many
other men. Examinations in both
these branches are to be given this
summer and several students will en
deavor through these to get into the
service.
