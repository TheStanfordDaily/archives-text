# War Time Puts Its Stamp on Senior Doings
## 
### 
Three flays of senior week, lik?
everything else, have shown their
mark of the war time. A large audi
ence at the farce turned its money
into the ambulance fund. The Prom
on Thursday evening was not very
well attended. Hut though the
weather did its best to keep folk
away, the Prom committee made
things near the ground attractive
enough to make one forget to look at
the sky. Lanterns and music and a
Kreat lighted 1917 at the end of the
court set the stage. Eats and some
dancing on the pavement did the rest.
It was a goo.d Prom.
Scattering attendance at the plate
laying and transferance of Memorial
duty is qutie according to precedent.
Put the faithful few were there to
see the whole thing through. Friday
night found fewer than usual at the
Vendonie at a remarkably well-staged
senior ball.
At the other end of the line from
the 1917 plate is another new shiny
one, put there by that first of all
classes, '92. Those who laid it were
on hand with the rest of the alumni
and near-alumni for the luncheon on
the Quad Saturday noon. Saturday
evening one more excuse for dancing
was found in the Senior-Alumni recep
tion in the Union. Another event of
the afternoon was an open meeting
of the Phi Beta Kappa in the Little
Theater, addressed by Dr. G. J. Peirce.
