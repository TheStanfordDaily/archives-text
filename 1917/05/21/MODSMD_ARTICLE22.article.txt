# Oratorio St. Paul Is Great Success
## 
### 
Another oratorio has gone to take
its place among those things which
go to make up the Stanford year.
Tliis time it was Mendelssohn's "St.
Paul," and it makes the third of those
memories of the blending of music
and the color and light of the Mem
orial Church. The"St. Paul" as a
whole was satisfying. rt was re
markable for a consistency of ex
cellence rather than for any outstand
ing single feature.
Of the soloists, Miss Esther Liver
sidge, '17, did most justice to what
she sang. Her part in this year's ora
torio was not heavy, but it was admir
ably done. Miss Edith Harvey, '17,
Mr. Harald Pracht and Mr. R. M. Bat
tison contributed well-sung solos. Al- i
though the choruses were stronger in
the soprano and alto than in the men's
divisions, Mr. Eaton's direction served
to make this less noticeable and to
produce an admirable ensemble.
