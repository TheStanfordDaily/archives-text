# 1917 BEQUEATHS UNDERGRADUATE GLORIES TO CLASSES OF FUTURE
## 
### A.H. Emery, '17 
We, the members of the class of
1917, being about to step out into the
war-torn world and take up the many
duties and obligations there awaiting
us, and being sane and of sound mind,
subscribe to this, our last will and
testament:
To all the generations of Stanford
students who are to come, we leave
the example of service to the nation
in time of need, which has been estab
lished by our class and the other
classes now in the university. The
memory of the immediate response to
the government's call which was made
by a good many of our classmates,
should be a precious heritage. It is
an evidence of the value of that stir
ring indefinable thing which we call
Stanford Spirit. This volunteering is
a proof that the years of effort and
the large sums of money expended on
us have not been in vain; that the
university has succeeded in its task
of producing good and useful citizens.
The many '17 men now serving in the
various branches of the army and
navy, the marine corps, the officers
reserve corps, and the American Am
bulance have indeed done their duty
by their university and their country,
and we hope that the example they
have set shall not soon be forgotten
down on the Stanford farm.
Then, too, we have one more thing
which we feel that it is our right to
bequeath. That is the institution of
Stanford military training. This was
adopted partly through the efforts of
two of our classmates, R. A. Griffin
and F. C. McCulloch; it was started
on its way by a good many more of
the '17 men, who have served during
the year as officers and privates in
the corps, and so we feel that some
share of its success is due to us. The
service which those who have been
so trained will be able to render is a
readily seen proof of its value. The
democracy, manliness, physical well
being and other beneficial qualities
which this training produces are
equally apparent. We leave this in
stitution for the benefit of those who
are to follow. We hope and indeed
know that they will take full advan
tage of its benefits and that they will
be better Stanford men and better
citizens therefor.
We sadly doff the sombrero and
pass it on to the class of 1918. May
you enjoy a happy year under its
broad brim and one shorn of all the
unrest which we have experienced.
To the class of 1919 we bequeath
the traditional right to wear the
cords, that thereby you may proudly
step forward into the ranks of Stan
ford upperclassmen.
And to the class of 1920 we give

the privilege of introducing a new
Sophomore headgear. We hope that
every one of you will wear it and
that it will not be permitted to fall
into such sad disuse as did the old
Red Hat. Also we give to you the
task of caring for the new freshmen,
asking you to give them good efficient
training but reminding you that you
are only one year removed from their
station.
To Otto Lachmund we leave the
charge of the 1917 football team. We
are confident that he will make the
season a success and wipe out the
memory of last fall's defeat by a win
over the Santa Clara team.
To Reg Caughey we bequeath the
track squad. We know that he will
put all he has into his new task and
that is a sufficient augury of success.
To "Mush" Stevens we consign the
baseball squad with best wishes for
a championship nine.
To Les Rogers we hand over the
duties of crew captain, together with
our wish that the same oar which has
flashed for four years ahead of the
California crews will again cross the
finish line in the lead.
To Frank Greve we leave the han
dling of Stanford's newest major
sport, confident that, under his leader
ship, the basketball five will enjoy a
banner year.
We bestow the student body presi
nencv upon Frank Walker. May he 1
have a successful term of office.
To Frank Taylor we assign the po- j
sition of Daily Palo Alto editor. May
his mortality lists of Stanford men
in the present war be short.
To "Wully" Wohlford we express
the fervent hope that the Chaparral
shall pass through a peaceful year,
dispensing humor in right good
measure but avoiding all conflicts
with the Student Council.
We wish to state our desire that
the Sequoia shall continue in its rap
id growth in public favor.
To the editors of the Illustrated Re
view we give our congratulations up
on their successful completion of their
first year, which gives such a bright
promise for the future.
To all others of the faculty, the stu
dent body and to the Trustees, we ex
press our sincere thanks for the bene
fits we have enjoyed in our four years
under the red-tiled roofs, and hope
that in later years we shall prove our
selves worthy of the privileges that
have been conferred upon us. To all
those upon whose shoulders will fall
the heavy burden of keeping the af
fairs of the university running during
the stress of war time, we convey
our heartfelt, best wishes.
In testimony whereof we have set
our signatures this eighteenth day of j
May. 1917
