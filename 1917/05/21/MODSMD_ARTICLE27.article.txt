# MILLER URGES SERVICE OF NATION TODAY
## "The College Man and the War" Is Subject of 1917 Class Oration on Friday 
### W. Leslie Miller 
The twenty-sixth commencement of
this University happens at an aus
picious time. After two and one-half
years of patient waiting, of patient
acceptance of insults heaped upon
our national honor, we find ourselves
today an active party in the great
World War. And altho our entrance
into the war may have been immedi
ately caused by the sinking of certain
ships, by the taking of certain lives,
by a submarine blockade thought
unjust and intolerable, there is after
all, something deeper, something
more fundamental, for which we as a
people find ourselves called upon to
.sacrifice time, resources, and even
our lives, to perpetuate,—the very
existence of our ideals of democracy.
Out of this great war must come a
greater political freedom for op
pressed people—a greater, more pro
found realization of the right of small
countries to exist, and the right of
their people to freedom of life, liber
ty, and especially the pursuit of a
national happiness. Ifwhen the war
is over, and the millions of life have
been sacrificed, and the billions of
wealth have been expended, with
nothing to show for the sacrifice but
waste, and desolation, and war
scarred countries, —if then we look

around us and find the same political
conditions that existed before the
war started, then all the effort of
those who sacrificed their lives for
the realization of profound ideals
will have been in vain; but if, when
the last battle of the war has been
fought, we can look about us and see
the dawning of a greater understand
ing of the principles and ideals of
democracy, we can raise our eyes,
speak to the spirit of those who are
gone, and ask them if after all some
thing of value has not flowed from
the enormous sacrifice.
At this time when we are about to
launch all our vast resources into the
speedy conclusion of what is at best
a sad job;—when we but realize that
before the end has come untold num
bers will probably perish, and our
tremendous treasure chest will be
strained to its limit, —we must look
ourselves squarely in the eye, and be
sure with our national conscience
that we are in this conflict with a
definite and laudable purpose. Hav
ing realized that, it is the unescap
able duty of every one of us to pre
pare to do his bit in the accomplish
ment of the end we seek, regardless
of the sacrifice it entails. Cheers
and flag waving won't silence a sin

'■Ue enemy gun. The patriotism en
gendered by the floating of flags, the
patriotism which goes this far and
stops, is not patriotism, hut is a false
sentimentalism which if strongly re
lied upon would prove to he at best
but an inefficient ally in the time of
stress. If we can look ourselves
squarely in the eye, and realize that
we are in this struggle for a purpose,
a laudable purpose, and that we are
in it as a nation determined to jus
tify our ideals of liberty and democ
racy, that alone should stir within us
to the last man and woman, that vital
patriotism which needs no flags,
which needs no martial music, to
send us through the greatest sacri
fices that a struggle such as this may
entail.
We are gathered together here to
day at a very auspicious time. How
many of us will ever look again upon
the red-tiled roofs we have learned
to love in these past few years of
close association; how many of us
will after a few short months be left
to gather together at the next occa
sion similar to this; how many of ug
will shortly be left to ever look upon
the faces of friends and associates
grown dear to us through the years
of close companionship spent here, is
beyond conjecture. Already we have
placed men in service in France, al
ready our men have gone to camps to
prepare themselves for the grim bat
tles that will shortly be upon us, bat
tles which will test the strength of
our convictions of civilization, free
dom, and democracy.
In this great struggle there is a
place for each of us. In the next few
months the United States must raise
many armies, and it is essential that
in one of these armies, at least, each
one of us should take his place; and
in the scheme of tin . uia college
man has his place, not unlike all
others.
The stage is cleared in the United
States right now for the entrance of
new leaders. It was generally con
ceded before the war began that the
field for leadership was greater than
ever before in this country; and with
the declaration of war the field is
enormously increased. Out of great
national crises, such as the one with
which we are now confronted, have
always come our leaders. Washing
ton sprang from one; Lincoln sprang
from civil life to be one of the great
est leaders that we have ever had, at
a time when military leadership was
preeminent; Grant sprang from the
same crisis. Roosevelt is still able to
stir up a certain amount of enthusi
asm among many, and it was from
the battlefields that he first caught a
glimpse of the White House. Now we
are entering a new epoch, at a time
when our national leaders are con
ceded to be few, at a time when the
stage is cleared for the entrance of
new and capable leaders, and it is but
natural that those leaders should
come from the ranks of the college
men.
This is an age when training counts
as it has never counted before. It is
an age of efficiency, when education
places a man in a position of marvel
lous advantage, and now is the time
when the world must see justified the
expenditure of the amount of money
that is expended for the education
and training of our people. Now is
the time when the college man must
justify his existence before a critical
world, must demonstrate that the
time he spent supposedly training
himself to be able to handle emergen
cies such as the one with which we
are now confronted, has not been
spent in vain. Out of the ranks of
the college men should come the lead
ers who will carry us through the
greatest national crisis we have ever
known. It is hard for many of us to
determine what our part may he; it
is possible that that part has not yet
made itself manifest; but the thing
of greatest importance is this, —that
when the thing for which we are
called does appear, be it great or
small, it is essential that we perform
