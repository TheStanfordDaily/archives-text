# ANNALS OF WAR CLASS TOLD BY HISTORIAN
## Herb Marshutz Pictures Seventeen's Doings of "Four Great Golden Years" 
### Herbert Stanton Marshutz 
It was the dawn of September of
1913 that the population of Stanford
was increased and bettered by the ap
pearance of some three hundred mem
bers of the class of 1917. They were
p Un y—those shrinking freshmen who
ran around on the Quadrangle won
dering what to do next. But by pay
ing their fifteen and their two and
their five and their one seventy-five
and the other subscription and mem
bership taxes, they were initiated
into the order of Stanford Men.
Since that eventful and expensive
lay, 1917 has permitted eight semes
ters to slip by. The flight has been
a rapid one. But from Time has 1917
taken a very great deal, and now
stands on the proverbial threshold of
the big world without. Innumerable
Senior classes have stood on that
threshold, but the welcome sign on
the door-mat is there still, waiting
for 1917.
This is the story of the class that
for eight semesters has made Stan
ford its home. The men and women
who came in 1913 have lived through
what can be truly termed the most
eventful period of recent times —of
the world and of this University.
Ninety-five, the Pioneer Class, were
trail-blazers) for Stanford's history.
Again, not so very long ago, when a
revolution on the campus ended with
the overthrow of booze and the later
establishment of student government,
there was a full time. At intervals,
the world has been up and doing.
But 1917, we believe, found both
world history and Stanford history to
occupy its time and mind.
Stanford, twenty-five years after its
birth, attained its majority, shook it
self from an almost lethargy, and pro
ceeded to make people sit up and
take notice. A new administration
with new ideals and the force to put
them into practice aroused the stu
dent body to a series of shudders and
convulsions. The world perhaps might
have focused its eyes upon Stanford
had not the world itself been in the
throes of a revolutionary age. Stan
ford and the world have both been
doing things. For a time this com
bination was too much for our minds,
and we shriveled helplessly in the
ranks, unable to keep step with the
march of events, and later unable to
keep up with the leaders of the col
umn. Stanford now has coupled its
energy to that of the world at large.
Nineteen Seventeen will continue to
do its share.
It is perhaps painful to think back
when there is so much looking ahead
to be done. The mental strength of
a Hercules is required to remember
with vividness all of the big things
that have come during 1917's stay. It
was this class that saw the opening
of the Palm Drive to automobiles, the
abolishment of the cigarette for
freshmen, the coming of the chimes,
the opening of the Women's Club
House and the Men's Union. It was
1917 that presented the last freshman
vaudeville, and saw the final Plug
Ugly show. It was the vote of 1917
that banished the upperclass rush for
ever. It was this class that was
present during the administration of
three big Stanford men: David Starr
Jordan, John Casper Branner, and
Bay Lyman Wilbur. During 1917's
first year David Starr Jordan, after a
quarter century of service to the Uni
versity, became Chancellor. Two
years later Dr. Branner —a veteran of
the Stanford service—retired and a
younger man came to preside. At the
same time, Dr. Jordan became Chan
cellor Emeritus.
It was 1917 that saw the breaking
of athletic relations with the Univer
sity of California, the first meetings
of the new intercollegiate agreement
committees, the abolishment of fresh
men on intercollegiate teams, the re
sumption of first-year athletic compe
tition with California, the pre-rally
burning of the big-game bonfire, the
first defeat of a Cardinal rugby team
by Santa Clara, the coming of basket
ball as a minor and later as a major
sport, and the adoption of intercol

legiate boxing, swimming and other
lesser activities.
Nineteen Seventeen was on hand
when a Cardinal crew and track
team, as well as tennis players, won
high honors in the East and Middle
West, and when baseball men and
glee club artists invaded the Orient
and the Mid-Pacific. Then, too, 1917
saw a restriction of freshmen women
in dramatics, the adoption of an hon
or-point and later of a grade-point
system to raise scholarship standards,
saw compulsory attendance classes,
saw the coming of eight o'clock and
Saturday morning lectures, saw a
chain-bound Quadrangle with motor
cars sent on a detour, saw vital fra
ternity reforms, saw the adoption of
a four-quarter system, of a new dor
mitory for women, of new standards
of admittance for the Five Hundred,
the granting of Boble Hall to the
men, and the growth of Encina Hall
into one of the largest dormitories in
the college world.
Those of 1917 who listened heard
the announcement of the future Stan
ford—fan-sliaped (like a rugby fan,
no doubt)—with a great commons
without meal-tickets, with fraterni
ties and sororities blocks apart, with
more than a social chasm and a draft
of western air between them. They
heard the splash of mermaids and
mermen in new swimming pools,
heard the organ in a completely re
stored Memorial Church, heard a tor
rent of discussion that came with a
new form of athletic control, heard,
saw and felt the coming of military
training, intensive and extensive. And
there was a Little Theatre, an art mu
seum, a beautified Quadrangle, and
now, in its infancy, a new library.
Again in athletics, referring to a
Stanford triumph, five years of track
supremacy over the University of
California.
In all of these affairs—as far as
possible—did 1917 play its share. Of
more interesting events, too minor,
many of them, to be mentioned today,
there were scores. An Alpha Phi as
well as two Pi Phi sorority fires are
entered upon the log-book. It is cer
tain that 1917 was present at the
thrilling climaxes. There were quar
rels and scraps: you will remember
the removal of the Founders' Statue
from the Memorial Court; the
Thumbs-Up Plug Ugly affair, the
American-Rugby squabble, the Mere-
Man tea-party, the first campaign for
the Belgians, and other campaigns
which have been forgotten or which
should not be exhumed.
Surely Time has stretched itself to
the limit since we first met Jack Mc-
Dowell across the great counter. In
strict accord with the great variety of
events of 1917's life, is the final end
ing to it all —one of the strangest
months in the history of any college.
The country at war! The drill field
outshadowed the class-room for 800
men. The beat of marching feet be
came common on the Quadrangle.
There were tired bodies instead of
tired brains when night came. Com
mencement for many came with ser
vice to the United States.
For a bit of history, scratch your
heads and think of September 2, 1913,
and the eventful month that followed.
There was a defeat in the formal
rush; ninety-five of 1917 signed up
for rugby, and later defeated 1916
with a 5 to 3 score. Si Davidson,
Katherine Sheldon and Jim Mackel
were the class officers during that
debut semester. Numerals in rugby
were granted to Scovel, Smitherum,
Halsted, Pettingil, Hammon, Nagel,
Swigart, Harris, Scott, Townsend,
Austin, Carroll, Dickey, Lachmund,
Huttman, Crary, Davidson, Mayberry.
In the big game with California (won
by Stanford, 13 to 8) were Davidson,
Lachmund and Austin, with Patter
son and Pettingil on the sidelines.
A committee composed of Les Mil
ler, Templeton, West, Lynn, Hutchin
son and McComb supervised the
building of the bonfire.
Nineteen Seventeen elected is fresh
men officers for the second semester

with West in the chair, Lachmund as
financier, Anita Allen as secretary.
True to Stanford tradition there were
no nominations for the vice-presiden
cy! At this baby meeting, Fry and
Loucks were granted numerals for
good work in the interclass distance
run. And the class went or record
as refusing to pay the bill submitted
by a haughy Cap and Gown society
for the alleged loss of song books at
a freshman song rally. At later
meetings, Mott, Miller and Williams
received debating pins. Dwiglit
Shepardson put over a sensational
freshman vaudeville which raised the
wrath and shocked the modesty of the
Dean of Women. There were no more
vaudeville shows!
In drama, Joe Cross, Jack Russel
and Nellita Choate made their ap
pearance that second semester. Es
ther Liversidge and Herb Stanley ap
peared in the Junior Opera. Aupperle
was chosen to the executive commit
tee. Maurer, McEuen, Skinner, An
drews and Kester rowed in the inter
class regatta for 1917. On the fresh
man crew that sprinkled estuary
dust in California eyes were Maurer,
McEuen, Andrews, Rogers, Russel,
Pettingil, McNulty, Day and Waller,
with Kester and Scovil subbing. That
season was developed the nucleus of
the famous Marathon team which for
four years showed a clean pair of
heels to all comers. On that team
were Aupperle, Scott, von Christier
son (he turned from track to make
Phi Beta Kappa), Wilkins, Halsted,
A. D. Griffin, Templeton, Frye, Adams,
Jones, Nagel, Freed, Chapman, Pat
terson, Mackel, Swigart, Flood, Lach
mund, Cary, Wise, West, Dievendorff
and Lynn.
The interclass track meet went to
1917, and it was the performance of
the 1917 track men that enabled Stan
ford to win over California in 1914,
'15, '16, and again in '17. What no
other class accomplished is now cred
ited to 1917 —four consecutive Irish
Marathon victories, two interclass
rugby and three interclass track suc
cesses. The following list is evidence
of class prominence in athletics.
Among the wearers of the Block "S"
you will find Lachmund, Halsted,
Swigart, Murray, Kester, Wilkins,
Single, Marriot, Bihlman, Pettingil,
all for rugby; Dievendorff, Aupperle,
Halsted, Lachmund, Bihlman, Scott,
Loucks, Wheatly, Miller and Kegley
for track; Wallace, Boney and
Wheatly for basketball; Rogers, Mau
rer, McEuen and Russel for crew;
Stevens, Bihlman, Lander, Hoover,
Mattei and Dickey for baseball.
While athletics were in progress
some Seventeeners stayed by the fire
side. Today they are listed as the
members of Phi Beta Kappa. Behold
W. F. Pritchard, R. D. Lillie, J. C.
Cross, Sid Adams, H. E. Crowe, E. S.
Dysinger, M. L. Holmes, W. E. Lock
wood, E. L. Roll, Doris Estcourt, Nel
lita Choate, Harriet McCausland,
Dare Stark, M. L. Johnson, E. B. Lor
mer, Gretchen Uhl, F. K. Murray, G.
H. Anderson, E. S. Maynard, Faye
Wright, M. M. Hanna, W. T. Evenson,
L. A. Hall, Esther Liversidge, Gladys
Taylor, Helen Peterson, Fred Supple,
Frank Johnston and Sigurd von
Christierson.
In other branches of endeavor, such
as student government, Nineteen Sev
enteen had Templeton, Kester, Curler,
Davidson, Gardner, Gores, Harris,
Horner, Johnson, Joyce, Koerner,
Lachmund, McGilvray, McNulty, Mil
ler, Murray, Oberg, Swigart, Wilkins
and Zacharias on the Conference, and
Templeton, Murray, Sample and
Wheatley on the Council. Anspach,
Engles and Cronenwett were the men
who ran the Band. On the Executive
Committee Wednesday evenings (that
is, some Wednesday evenings) were
Swigart, Maurer, Howard, Leard,
Wheatley, Scovel and Bihlman. In
military, Griffin, McColloch, Parker,
Sprague, Horner, Lytle, Skelton, Col
lins and Thrapp came furthest to the
front as officers.
Turn to dramatics and you find that
the following did much to advance
the standard set during recent years:
Nellita Choate, Esther Liversidge,
Edith Harvey, Frank Johnston, Dick
Johnston, Frank McColloch, Murray,
Russel, Cross and others. In journal
ism 1917 had Griffin, Howard, War
ren, Donaldson, Robinson, Leard,
Marshutz and the Misses Allen,
Choate, Marcus and Stark. Of Griffin
it may be said that he edited the
1917 Quad, with Hayden Hews as
manager, and founded and edited the
Illustrated Review for its first year.
Of Miss Ailen it may be said that she
reached a mark not heretofore at
tained by a woman in Stanford jour
nalism. We are indebted to Miss Al
len for her Class Book, kept from
1913 to last September, and which af
forded valuable information to be
used in this record.
Class executives during the years
were Si Davidson, to begin with; Bert
West following; Franklin Rose and
Frank McColloch during the Sopho
more year; Harold Dievendorff and
Ed Beal as Juniors; Otto Lachmund
and Robert Ames as Seniors. In de
bating circles, Miller and Holland of
1917 were to the fore.
Among the Five Hundred there
were some who distinctly challenged
"Mere-Man," threatening his own so
called supremacy of accomplishment.
Cap and Gown in its annual honoring
party, has seen fit to honor the
Misses Bacon, Choate, Estcourt,
Jameson, Liversidge, Marcus, May
nard, Allen, Metz, Dare and Vaal
Stark, Westerman, Greening, Post
and Evans.
In these closing lines, a confession.
This is not a complete history of the
class of 1917. It cannot be. If it
were but possible, it would be our de
sire to build upon these chapters of
history a new and final chapter—of
what is to come after we separate,
as we shall before many days have
rolled over the hills to the West.
Nineteen Seventeen, in its compara
tively brief visit, lived a vigorous,
worthy existence, doing and doing
well during a momentous age of Stan
ford and world history. It was a per
iod that began with a new adminis
tration —with the retirement of David
Starr Jordan—a period that had its
eyes opened at the coming of Ray
Lyman Wilbur, and a period that
closed for 1917 with a great national
crisis, the culmination of a gigantic
world struggle.
During this age now history, the
class here assembled did much. By
its activities and its associations the
youthful youths and modest maidens
of 1913 were moulded into the men
and women of 1917. It is when we
consider these young people that we
hope a final chapter may some day
be written. For the men going out
into the big puddle were made men
while at Stanford. No matter what
they accomplished while living here,
they are ready to do bigger things in
the world that is waiting across the
boundary line. There are dozens al
ready in the service of the country.
There are scores ready to go when
needed. At the Presidio in San Fran
cisco, half of the Stanford men are of
1917. They are G. C. Collins, W. K.
Eyer, R. A. Griffin, E. R. Ames, Mil
ton Gunn, E. W. Horner, G. K. How
ard, E. C. Kester, F. J. Leard. F. C.
McColloch, J. S. Marriott, S. von
Christierson, Z. B. West, P. L. Wil
liams, and L. E. Cole and J. S. Higley,
former members of this class.
W. J. Losh, who would have grad
uated with us, is today in France,
serving in the American Ambulance.
A. C. Kimber is en route. G. C. Rai
ney, Ben Curler. Lee Skelton, P. H.
Davis, R. A. Donaldson, M. E. Ted
ford, Lansing Warren, W. J. Gores,
H. V. Aupperle and E. B. Wilkins
are soon to go in the second and third
Stanford units.
Nineteen Seventeen is as proud of
these men as she is hopeful of the
success of all. It is of the success of
those who go out to do things that the
final chapter to this history would
tell. The Senior of today is the Man
of Affairs of tomorrow.
