# "SEEK IDEALISM"--—DR. STILLMAN
## Dr. Wilbur Introduces Retiring Vice-President 
### 
Dr. John Maxson Stillnian appeared
before the students this morning for
the last time as Vice-President of the
University. He retires this year from
active service. He took as the sub
ject of his address to the graduating
class "Idealism and National Policy,"
advocating a philosophy of hope, not
of despair. In introducing Dr. Still
man, President Wilbur said:
Civilization stands at the cross
ways. Unless the unrestricted use of
the submarine in warfare fails and
fails utterly, no one of us here can
hope to see the day when man can
rest, secure in his institutions built
up so laboriously by all of the best
in the years that lie behind. Not only
must the submarine be met in a ma
terial way and defeated, but the spirit
back of such use of a tool devised by
the human mind must not only be
checked and destroyed but superseded
by new conceptions of man's relation
ship to man. Should the submarine
succeed, not only would it mean our
defeat now in the greatest task we
have ever assumed, but it would mean
that any nation could suddenly make
civilization its prey. To a world torn
by such terrors, aghast at the possi
bilities, ready to fight to the death,
do we send forth this band of young
people with the stamp of our approv
al and of our authority upon them.
We pray that we have helped them
here, that the Stanford brand upon
them will lead them to the full con
secration of their enhanced powers to
usefulness and to country.
No group of Stanford men and
women ever faced on their gradua
tion day the responsibilities that are
before you,—a world in arms, a great
democracy just stirring with the new
ly kindled impulses that once gave it
birth, the youth of our country called
in to solve with their lives, if need
be, problems we thought settled, but
which need a new baptizement in
blood to make them permanent and
universal.
Abraham Lincoln saw through the
whole of our great internal struggle
the fundamental issue of popular gov
ernment. Greater than the abolition
of slavery was the need of holding in
tact the first great effort of man to
govern himself. Now the world faces
our problem of the sixties. As Abra
ham Lincoln saw it nationally, we
must see it internationally and not
rest content until the speech at Get
tysburg and the war speeech of Presi
dent Wilson are made representative
of the practice of all nations. How
great the opportunity, how great the
pobility of soul required so that no
element of life that has been added
by your University years may fail
your country's service, your country's
need!
You cannot escape if you would,
and I know that you would not, the
responsibility that your training here
has placed upon you. You have been
set aside here for several years to ac
quire added ability to meet the
world's needs. The range is so wide
that there is ample scope for any
power you may possess. Study your
self and decide where you can do the
most in the way of service. Ameri
ca's ideals must win in a blood
soaked world and upon America
comes much of the burden of replac
ing in the line those who die in bat
tle and also of replacing them in the
future after the war is over. Pre
pare for the University man's or a

University woman's part. Remember
you are now full-fledged sons and
daughters of Stanford. We look with
confidence to you to show that to you
has come some part of that great I
spiritual background dear to the j
Founders of this University and to us I
all. We ask in leaving us that you j
will, no matter where you go or what j
you do, save some small part of your
energy to help us to make this, our
University, a greater force for the up
building of man and of nation.
Dr. Stillman's address follows:
Four hundred years ago, Sir Thom
as More gave a new word to our vo
cabulary—"Utopia." In this celebrat
ed book, first published in 151(!, this
eminent scholar and statesman, one
time Speaker of the House of Com
mons and Chancellor of England un
der Henry the Eighth, pictured his
dream of a better social and political
state than was to be found in the
world he knew. For in the time in
which he lived, as for centuries be
fore, England has been the scene of
almost uninterrupted savage wars, of
unscrupulous diplomatic intrigue, of
bitter religious intolerance, of oppres
sion of the poor by the rich, of the
weak by the strong.
Yet Thomas More was an idealist
and with far-seeing prophetic vision
he dared to look forward to a future
when equity, justice, and friendly
sentiment should sometime dominate
the greed for wealth and the lust for
power. And this vision he pictures in
this fancied principality in the island
of Utopia or "Nowhere." "In Utopia
the aim of legislation is to secure the
welfare, social, industrial, intellectual,
religious of the community at large."
In an age of the most intense relig
ious intolerance, More pictures in
Utopia a condition well exemplified
in a decree—"that it should be lawful
for every man to favor and follow
what religion he would, and that he
might do the best he could to bring
others to his opinion so that he did
it peaceably, gently, quietly and sob
erly, without hasty and contentious
rebuking and inveighing against
others."
In Utopia every man and every
woman must learn a craft or trade,
and must work at it, though none
shall be required to work more than
nine hours per day, that all may have
leisure for self-improvement and for
recreation, and that they shall not be
wearied by continual work like toil
ing beasts, "which nevertheless," says
More, "is almost everywhere the life
of workmen and artificers, save in
Utopia." Even the divine right of
kings, so strongly intrenched at that
time was challenged by the provision
in Utopia that the royal ruler was
"removeable on suspicion of design
to enslave the people." Such a con
summation was possible in Utopia,
because all citizens were trained to
arms, but no standing army of mer
cenaries was maintained.
Four hundred years ago, while
Thomas More was thinking his Uto
pia in England, there lived and
wrought in the Republic of Florence
a man whose writings have also left
a permanent impression on the minds
of men. His writings also have been
published like More's Utopia in count
less editions in all languages. This
was Nicolo Machlavelli. Machiavelli j
was a trusted diplomat and secretary
to the Florentine Republic, serving j
on many foreign embassies and in- j
trusted with many responsibilities. I

And he also had a vision, the vision
of a powerful and united Italy. Yet
the Italy he knew and described was
in his time the very vortex of the
most devastating storms of domestic
war and of foreign invasions.
The philosophy of Machiavelli is
displayed in his principal works, "The
Prince," "The Discourses" and the
"History of Florence." He says:
"Nations, as a rule, when making a
change in their systems of govern
ment pass from order to disorder, and
afterwards from disorder to order, he
cause Nature permits no stability in
human affairs. When nations reach
their final perfection and can mount
no higher they commence to descend;
and equally when they have descend
ed and reached a depth when they
can fall no lower, necessity compels
them to rise again. Thus States will
always be falling from prosperity to
adversity, and from adversity they
will ascend again to prosperity. Re
cause valor brings peace, peace idle
ness, idleness disorder, and disorder
ruin; once more from ruin rises good
order, from order valor, and from
valor success and glory."
These two contemporary literary
monuments, More's Utopia and Machi
avelli's Prince, have for four cen
turies almost equally shared in the
profound interest they have excited
in the minds of men. T have chosen
them because they represent typical
points of view, which are represented
in all ages and all nations. Yes, in
every little community we may find
their prototypes.
There are always those who must
find relief and inspirations in look
ing away from the imperfect condi
tion of society and in fixing their
vision upon a future condition which
shall more nearly satisfy our ideals
of the perfect state. Prophets or
poets, enthusiasts or visionaries,
sometimes indeed unpractical, it is yet
their high mission to keep alive
among men the hope of a better fu
ture for humanity upon this earth, —
to bring nearer to their mental vision
a golden age to come.
But many also are those who are
disciples of the philosophy of Machia
velli. With them human nature never
changes, selfishness is and ever will
be the dominant and militant trait of
human nature. Nations rise and fall
as inevitably as the ocean tides, and
must ever so rise and fall. No at
tempt at radical reform is worth
while,—it is but a word written in the
sand.
Nations have always striven to gain
wealth and power at the expense of
their neighbors, and because they al
ways have they will forever so strive.
War is a normal conlition of the peo
ples. like spring medicine, necessary
for their political health. Dreams of
Utopias may serve to amuse children,
they have no place in the philosophy
of red-blooded men.
Verily this is indeed the Philosophy
of Despair. However greatly this
Machiavellian opportunism has ap
pealed to the ambitions of rulers,
their ministers and lieutenants, it is
certain that it has become increasing
ly repugnant to the great heart of hu
manity. Looking backward over the
centuries that separate us from the
days of More and Machiavelli, it
seems clear that the dream of Utopia
has become in many respects more
nearly realized and less visionary,
while the graphic analysis of the
