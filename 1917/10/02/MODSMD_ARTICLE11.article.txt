### 
Military Training preparations at
Stanford during the coming quarter
are right in accord with national
spirit. Major Jens Bugge says mili
tary affairs at Stanford are due to
take a spurt that will far surpass all
previous records. What with compul
sory military or physical training for
freshmen and sopohomorcs, and the
war time enthusiasm that pervades,
between 500 and 600 students are ex
pected to enroll in the military
courses.
There is a possibility for a choice
between two courses, an elementary
and an advanced. The elementary
course is primarily for first and sec
and year students, and for those who
have not had any military training
whatsoever; training in this course
comes three times a week; however,
no units are granted for the work.
This will consist mainly in drill in
the basic principles of military train
ing. The more advanced course, open
to those who have had a certain
amount of military training, including
those who had the six weeks intensive
training at the end of last semester,
will deal with the more technical
side of trench and other methods of
warfare. The general aim of this
couise will be to train the men as
prospective ofTicers.
Tlie optional government has made
provision to grant commissions to the
ten seniors who prove themselves the
most competent in the advanced
course. They will probably then be
come members of the federal reserve
corps, called into active service in
times of war. A similar provision
has been made for those in the future
who take four years' military train
ing, permitting them to become o
ficers in the federal reserve.
Uniforms and guns are to be pro
vided by the government, which takes
charge of all the expenses. There is
a shortage of rifles at present, so that
the students will probably have to
drill with guns in relays. However,
Major Bugge has announced that the
300 rifles now on hand will be aug
mented in the near future.
Major Bugge is to be assisted in his
work by retired sergeants from the
regular army. Sergeant Bartley is
on the campus already; ex-Sergeant
Jewell is now a captain in the regu
lars, so will not assist in the training
hero this year. However, H. W.
Maloney, instructor of Physical Train
ing, will aid in the military instruc
tion. Maloney is a veteran of the
British army. Further assistance in
the matter of instructors is expected
from the federal government.

freshmen and sopohomorcs, and the
war time enthusiasm that pervades,
between 500 and 600 students are ex
pected to enroll in the military
courses.
There is a possibility for a choice
between two courses, an elementary
and an advanced. The elementary
course is primarily for first and sec
and year students, and for those who
have not had any military training
whatsoever; training in this course
comes three times a week; however,
no units are granted for the work.
This will consist mainly in drill in
the basic principles of military train
ing. The more advanced course, open
to those who have had a certain
amount of military training, including
those who had the six weeks intensive
training at the end of last semester,
will deal with the more technical
side of trench and other methods of
warfare. The general aim of this
couise will be to train the men as
prospective ofTicers.
Tlie optional government has made
provision to grant commissions to the
ten seniors who prove themselves the
most competent in the advanced
course. They will probably then be
come members of the federal reserve
corps, called into active service in
times of war. A similar provision
has been made for those in the future
who take four years' military train
ing, permitting them to become o
ficers in the federal reserve.
Uniforms and guns are to be pro
vided by the government, which takes
charge of all the expenses. There is
a shortage of rifles at present, so that
the students will probably have to
drill with guns in relays. However,
Major Bugge has announced that the
300 rifles now on hand will be aug
mented in the near future.
Major Bugge is to be assisted in his
work by retired sergeants from the
regular army. Sergeant Bartley is
on the campus already; ex-Sergeant
Jewell is now a captain in the regu
lars, so will not assist in the training
hero this year. However, H. W.
Maloney, instructor of Physical Train
ing, will aid in the military instruc
tion. Maloney is a veteran of the
British army. Further assistance in
the matter of instructors is expected
from the federal government.
Military Training preparations at
Stanford during the coming quarter
are right in accord with national
spirit. Major Jens Bugge says mili
tary affairs at Stanford are due to
take a spurt that will far surpass all
previous records. What with compul
sory military or physical training for
freshmen and sopohomorcs, and the
war time enthusiasm that pervades,
between 500 and 600 students are ex
