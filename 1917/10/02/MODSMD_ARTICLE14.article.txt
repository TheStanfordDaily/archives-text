# TIMES HAVE CHANGED

Times have changed. The old familiar greeting "Glad to see you
back," has added to it, "What is your draft number?" Stanford men are
bearing their share of the burden of the great war and those of us who are
back extend to them our heartiest congratulations. Names once familiar
around the campus are found in every branch of Federal service from Her
bert Hoover's Food Commission to the high privates in the rear rank. The
loss of many of these men has been not merely sentimental. The organiza
tion of the faculty and student body alike has been compelled to furnish
its quota in the great fight for democracy and while it has suffered in so
doing, not a word of complaint has been heard. President Wilson has
urged from the declaration of war that the greatest service the colleges and
universities of the country can render is a continuation of activites as near
ly as possible along the lines followed before the war. To that end Stan
ford is planning for the year's work, with the same idea of turning out
men and women who can best serve humanity, either in civil or military
life, and believing that that can best be accomplished by a continuance of
the policy in force in former years. Because of the handicap placed on
such a course by the loss of men, it behooves everyone connected with the
University to put forth the greatest spirit of cooperation and neither the
University nor the country will suffer thereby.
