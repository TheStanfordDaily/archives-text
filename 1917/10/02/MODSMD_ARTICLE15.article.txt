# DAILY TRYOUTS
## 
### 
Today's issue of The Daily Palo Alto marks the opening of Volume 51.
Following the unsettled summer, during which both the editor and man
ager enlisted, the first issue has been delayed. The staff is unusually small
and therefore we make our semi-annual appeal for tryoutees stronger than
usual. There has never been such an opportunity for members of the soph
omore and junior classes to take responsible positions on the staff. The
lack of experienced men makes necessary a larger turnout of freshmen than
former years.
