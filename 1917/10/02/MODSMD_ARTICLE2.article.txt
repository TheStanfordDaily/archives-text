The Thomas Weltou Stanford Art

and accepted by the University Trus

in the Art Gallery. This building is
the first to be erecetd in the new quad

library. Its foundation has already
been laid and the steel construction
will soon begin. The books from the
present library will be removed to
this building after its completion and
it will be known as the Main Libary
The new Roble dormitory is well
under construction; the framework is
up, and the roof on, and the concrete
poured for the walls. The approxi
mate date for ihe completion of the
building April Ist; if it is finished
at that time, the women now occupy
ing Roble Hall, Madrono Hall, and
those living in Palo Alto, will take n]
their residence in the new hall during
spring vacation.
The University printing shop, lo
cated near Roble gymnasium, is al
most completed. Within three or four
weeks The Daily Palo Alto will have
offices on the ground floor of this
building. ft is very probable that
other campus publications will occupy
