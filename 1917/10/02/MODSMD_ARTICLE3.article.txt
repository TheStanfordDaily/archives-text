# Rally Scheduled for Thursday Evening
## Rugby Drive Against Santa Clara to Start With Speeches 
### 
Stanford will fire her first gun in
the fall football drive against Santa
Clara, Thursday night, in the annual
sign-up rally in Encina Hall.
Speeches, yells, songs, and a long
list of grid-iron hopefuls will feature
the initial move, for war or no war, if
early indications are to be regarded
trustworthy, the Cardinal fans and
players are out to win. So encour
aging are the prospects to Big Jim
Wylie, coach, that he confidently gives
assurance of not less than 100 rug
gers in the squad which will com
mence the training schedule Friday
afternoon.
Although the war, along with which
is to be mentioned the attractions of
the draft army, the regular army, the
navy, the ambulance corps and all the
other inveigling offers of the too-ac
commodating Mars, Stanford will
have four mainstays from last year's
team, several dependable men from
last year's frosh team, a sprinkling
of second team men and a few husky
recruits, that altogether promise ill
fortune for the saintly crew from
down the peninsula. In fact a glance
over the names of the Big Four from
last year, who, by the way, will ex
ercise their vocal proclivities in a
few memorized speeches at the rally,
Will convince anyone that Stanford's
nucleus is sure a hummer. Here they
are:
"Dink" Templeton, "Swede" Pettin
gil, Bill Winham and Les Wark.
Of course all these lads will begin
with—"Fellows, I haven't much to
say, but" —nevertheless a few recruits
from the ex-frosli aggregation will
pull the genuine Desmothenes stuff; so
give them the once over, boys; their
speech-making may lack the punch of
the old Greek, but nevertheless they're
going to be some players—so once
again, give them the once over.
No dinner would be complete with
out dessert; likewise, no show, no
game, no rally or no—anything would
be complete on the Stanford campus
without Graduate Manager, Boscoe,
Eat-'em-alive, Red Hauser. Thusly,
Red Hauser will furnish the dessert
of the rally, lie's some relishing dish,
too. Anyway, Red will hand out the
P's and Q's of football. So, alto
gether. 'twill be some show at which
none of the regular fellows will fail
to b* on deck.

players are out to win. So encour
aging are the prospects to Big Jim
Wylie, coach, that he confidently gives
assurance of not less than 100 rug
gers in the squad which will com
mence the training schedule Friday
afternoon.
Although the war, along with which
is to be mentioned the attractions of
the draft army, the regular army, the
navy, the ambulance corps and all the
other inveigling offers of the too-ac
commodating Mars, Stanford will
have four mainstays from last year's
team, several dependable men from
last year's frosh team, a sprinkling
of second team men and a few husky
recruits, that altogether promise ill
fortune for the saintly crew from
down the peninsula. In fact a glance
over the names of the Big Four from
last year, who, by the way, will ex
ercise their vocal proclivities in a
few memorized speeches at the rally,
Will convince anyone that Stanford's
nucleus is sure a hummer. Here they
are:
"Dink" Templeton, "Swede" Pettin
gil, Bill Winham and Les Wark.
Of course all these lads will begin
with—"Fellows, I haven't much to
say, but" —nevertheless a few recruits
from the ex-frosli aggregation will
pull the genuine Desmothenes stuff; so
give them the once over, boys; their
speech-making may lack the punch of
the old Greek, but nevertheless they're
going to be some players—so once
again, give them the once over.
No dinner would be complete with
out dessert; likewise, no show, no
game, no rally or no—anything would
be complete on the Stanford campus
without Graduate Manager, Boscoe,
Eat-'em-alive, Red Hauser. Thusly,
Red Hauser will furnish the dessert
of the rally, lie's some relishing dish,
too. Anyway, Red will hand out the
P's and Q's of football. So, alto
gether. 'twill be some show at which
none of the regular fellows will fail
to b* on deck.
Stanford will fire her first gun in
the fall football drive against Santa
Clara, Thursday night, in the annual
sign-up rally in Encina Hall.
Speeches, yells, songs, and a long
list of grid-iron hopefuls will feature
the initial move, for war or no war, if
early indications are to be regarded
trustworthy, the Cardinal fans and
players are out to win. So encour
