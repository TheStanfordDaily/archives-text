# Pre-Legal Department Is to Be Discontinued
## 
### 
Abolition of the Pre-Legal depart
ment. sent a large number of 1921 's
forces to other major departments in
yesterday's registration. History and
Economics are the two departments
which probably were swelled to the
greatest extent by the ruling to the
effect that the Law School will no
longer accept incoming freshmen as
Pre-Legal majors.
Dean C. A. Huston of the Law
School advises freshmen to select
major subjects in accordance with
their major interests other than Law,
and to obtain a bachelor's degree
from that department. But of their
electives, a sufficient number must be
devoted to professional Law studies
to total 11 units by the time the A. R.
is granted.
As no courses in Law, under the
old sytem, were open to students of
less than substantially junior stand
ing, it was deemed advisable by the
Law School to allow Law aspirants
to register in the departments in
which they were actually taking
work. During yesterday's registra
tion, Dean C. A. Huston endeavored
to find out, in interviews with pros
pective Law majors, who sought his
advice, what were the Individual
tastes of the students, and recom
mended departments in keeping with
those tastes, although no particular
departments are recommended in gen
eral.
The Pre-Legal department, how
ever, is to continue its existence for
those already registered in it, and
sophomores and juniors can be grad
uated in that department as usual.
