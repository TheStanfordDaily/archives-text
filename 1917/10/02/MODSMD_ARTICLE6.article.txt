# WILBUR PRAISES STANFORD WAR WORK
## MEN ARE DOING MUCH Students Can Serve Country Best by Earnest Work in Studies 
### 
Stanford can well be proud of the
place the University has taken and
will continue increasingly to take in
war-time service for the nation, ac
cording to President Ray Lyman Wil
bur. Stanford men of the faculty, the
alumni, and the student body are ac
complishing big things in all branches
of the war work.
Stanford Serves Nation.
That Stanford can best of all serve
the country at this hour by remaining
open and keeping up the regular work
of instruction is Dr. Wilbur's opinion.
"The most important thing when a
great nation like this goes to war is
to get the right people in the right
places for service," he said when in
terviewed. "Hence it is necessary for
the university to remain open to keep
up its work of training for future cit
izenship the young men and women
who come to it.
"Stanford this year anticipates earn
est and thorough work on the part of
all of its students. Tn no other way
will they be satisfied to remain at
their studies with the world going
through the most critical period in all
history."
There will be no decrease in the
ranks of the professors and instruc
tors except that occasioned by the ab
sence of faculty men in the service of
the government.
President Wilbur himself has just
returned within the last few days
from Washington, I). C., where he
was one of the chief aides of Her
bert C. Hoover, Stanford '95, as di
rector of the National Food Conserva
tion Bureau.
During Dr. Wilbur's absence the af
fairs of the university were handled,
first by Dr. J. M. Stillman, and after
his retirement from office on August
1, Professor Charles D. Marx served as
acting president. Contrary to exist
ing rumors, President Wilbur will re
main on the campus during the com
ing year.
In addition to Hoover and Dr. Wil
bur, other Stanford men in the food
conservation work included Ben S.
Allen, '07, director; Assistant Pro
fessor E. W. Smith, Stanford '99, ed
itorial writer; Professor Vernon Ly
man Kellogg, and for a short time, E.
C. Behrens, '14.
Professor William F. Durand of the
(Mechanical Engineering department
is chairman of the United States
aeronautics advisory board; Dr. W.
F. Snow and Professor Zinsser of the
Medical School are majors in the sur
geon-general's office, in charge of that
branch of the service in the canton
ments. Several professors and de
partment heads arc engaged in gov
ernment missions, the nature of
which cannot be made public at this
time, owing to war conditions.
Major Jens Bugge, U. S. A., retired,
professor of military science and tac
tics, worked in the adjutant-general's
office at Washington, D. C., during the
summer, but is again in charge of the
war training at Stanford.
As a result of the intensive military
drill of the spring Stanford was
awarded the honor of being one of
the five universities to be named in
the "distinguished" class by the War
Department. Ten men of the grad
uating class can be named every year
as second lieutenants without further
examination as a result of this rating.
War Department officials after an
investigation of Stanford's plan of
universal participation in athletics
and of its results have recommended
the adoption of this idea by all Amer
ican universities. Wherever this is
followed it is found that a greater per
centage of the men of auniversity pass
the physical examination for the
army, navy and training camps.
Instruction is being furnished the
naval base hospital unit at the Stan
ford Mcdical school in San Fran
cisco.
