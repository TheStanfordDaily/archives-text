# WILBUR PRAISES STANFORD WAR WORK
## MEN ARE DOING MUCH Students Can Serve Country Best by Earnest Work in Studies 
### 
Stanford can well be proud of the
place the University has taken and
will continue increasingly to take in
war-time service for the nation, ac
cording to President Ray Lyman Wil
bur. Stanford men of the faculty, the
alumni, and the student body are ac
complishing big things in all branches
of the war work.
Stanford Serves Nation.
That Stanford can best of all serve
the country at this hour by remaining
open and keeping up the regular work
of instruction is Dr. Wilbur's opinion.
"The most important thing when a
great nation like this goes to war is
to get the right people in the right
places for service," he said when in
terviewed. "Hence it is necessary for
the university to remain open to keep
up its work of training for future cit
izenship the young men and women
who come to it.
"Stanford this year anticipates earn
est and thorough work on the part of
all of its students. Tn no other way
will they be satisfied to remain at
their studies with the world going
through the most critical period in all
history."
There will be no decrease in the
ranks of the professors and instruc
tors except that occasioned by the ab
sence of faculty men in the service of
the government.
President Wilbur himself has just
returned within the last few days
from Washington, I). C., where he
was one of the chief aides of Her
bert C. Hoover, Stanford '95, as di
rector of the National Food Conserva
tion Bureau.
