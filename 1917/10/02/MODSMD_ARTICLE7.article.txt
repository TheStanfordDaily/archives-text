# Registration Shows 470 Less Students
## Ranks of Men Students Fall off One-Third. Registration Totals 1422. 
### 
Registration figures compiled last
night by Assistant Registrar J. E. Mc-
Dowell. show a falling off of four
hundred and seventy as compared
with the same day of registration last
year. Total enrollment for this year
was 1422, as added up yesterday eve
ning, while last year's total was 1892.
Most of the difference is a result of
the failure of old men to return to
college. There are 37G loss old men
back than last year, the figures read
ing 5(54 for the autumn of 1917, and
940 for 1916. Fifty-eight fewer fresh
men are signed up for universitj work
than last fall, there being 394 now as
compared to 452 then.
Altogether there are 434 less men
here this year than a year ago, a fall
ing off of one-third.
Then* are only 1(51 women regist
ered up to last ovoning but them will
be the full five hundred before regis
tration is completed, and letters havo
been sent to those next in line on the
waiting list.
McDowell predicts that when the
final report is made there will be
close to one thousand men, making
total registration about 1500.
