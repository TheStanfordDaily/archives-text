### 
Four units of Stanford men, organ
ized as divisions in the American
Field Ambulance Service, are now in
active service or in training for ac
tive service in Europe. The first and
second units joined forces in Paris
under the leadrsliip of C. A. Randau,
ex-'li), and are now in the Balkans,
fifteen miles from the first line of
Austrian trenches. The third and
fourth units are still in training at
Allentown, Pa.
Many changes have been made In
the personnel of the units. C. J.
Randau, former leader of the second
group, dropped out in New York, and
entered the New York School of Aero
nautics, from which he has since been
sent to France. In Paris, Carl Floete,
John Sellards, Bob Pelouze and Gar
net Rainey left the same unit. While
still in France, a number of the vet
eran drivers from the first group
joined the second on its way to Salon
ica.
The journey through Italy to Greece
was a revelation to the Stanford men,
who are making the most of their op
portunity to study the peoples of the
country where history was made.
Many of them are journalistically in
clined and are devoting their spare
time to th" study of the French lan- 1
guage, in order that they may make
the most of their many interesting
experiences.
