# Annual Rush Will Be Held Thursday
## 
### 
Sophomores will endeavor to make
Stanford men of the 1921 class Wed
nesday night and Thursday afternoon,
according to plans issued from the
Student Adviser's office. As usual,
hostilities will be confined to the
Poster fight and the tie-up rush.
In the absence of action by the
Student Council this year the same
regulations for the two rushes as were
adopted last year will be in force.
These regulations as issued by the
Student Adviser are as follows:
Following are the formal regula
tions adopted by the Conference for
dealing with the fall underclass con
flicts:
1. Hostilities shall be confined
Wednesday (October 3d), and Thurs
day (October 4th).
2. Wednesday night shall be poster
laying night. There shall be no inter
class hostility before 4:30 Wednesday
afternoon, or after 4:30 Thursday
morning, until the annual rush on the
football field is started on Thursday
afternoon.
3. Ther eshall be no choking, slug
ging or stripping of clothes at any
time.
4. Infractions of any of these regu
lations by any student or students,
and failure of any student or student
officer to do his utmost to regulate the.
conflicts properly, will merit discip-
linary action by the Men's Student
Council.
Moth classes have organized for the
rushes and are prepared to assert
their mastery with ropes and "Sears
ville's best."
