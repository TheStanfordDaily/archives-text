# PROSPECTIVE DEBATERS TO TRY OUT SOON
## SIX VETERANS BACK Two Teams Will Be Picked on Week From Wednesday in Little Theatre 
### 
With the California debate sched
uled for November 23, prospective de
baters are preparing for the tryouts,
which will probably be held in the
Little Theater, a week from next
Wednesday evening. The question
announced by Debate Coach Carl Leib
is the same as the one to be debated
in the intercollegiate contest: "Re
solved: That in war times the federal
government should employ conscrip
tion of labor to insure sufficient out
put of war materials.'
Prospects for a victory in the Cali
fornia debate loom exceedingly bright
with six veterans of last year's teams
back this semester. M. L. McClintock,
'18, J. G. Driscoll, '18, W. I. Ames, '19,
A. G. Westwick, '19, G. J. Knight, '19,
and Margaret Shedd, '20, ought to form
the nucleus of a winning combination.
A squad of eight men is to be
chosen at the tryouts, enough for two
teams of three men each, and an al
ternate for each team. A big squad
is needed this year, since there is
possibility of a debate with the Uni
versity of Southern California, to be
held the same time as the contest with
California.
Coach Leib further announced that
the system of no-decision debates,
tried out last year, had been found in
adequate, and the old system, of decis-
ion by judges for every aeuate, will
be reinstated this semester.
Neither of the two societies has met
this quarter, but Euphronia has ar
ranged a program for tomorrow eve
ning. An open discussion on the ques
tion: "Resolved, That the student
body should be given greater latitude
in student self-government," is sched
uled. All interested are urged to at
tend the meeting, which is to take
place in room 12 at 7:30.
