Speed, class, and thrills will be
staged in the annual swimming tour
ney on Wednesday afternoon at 4
o'clock in the Encina pool. Keen in
terest has been taken in acquatics this
year and from the dope sheet rare
competition between the classes is as
sured. The freshmen have turned out
better than the older men and from
present indications they are the fav
orites. The sophomores, however,
with Considine, Coonse, Wickersliam,
Schlaudeman and some new material,
should put up a good ba'tle.
Darling and Greene for the fresh
men will undoubtedly be large point
winners and against Considine and
Coonse should furnish some real
races.
