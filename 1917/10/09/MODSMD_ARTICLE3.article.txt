# STUDENT BODY ELECTION IS CALLED FOR FRIDAY
## 
### 
Election of six men to fill offices of
the Associated Students will take
place Friday, on the Quad, following
the opening of nominations by Stu
dent Adviser W. L. Miller, '17, at the
first assembly of the student body last
night.
This initiative was assumed, ex
plained Mr. Miller, merely to rescue
the situation from the standsill caused
by the fact that most of the executive
officers of the student body have not
returned to college, being in the ser
vice of the government. The remain
ing members do not constitute a work
ing quorum.
L. R. Chandler, '18, was nominated
lor the office of president of the Asso
ciated Students, and further nomina
tions for the office, as well as for the
offices of vice-president and secretary
of the student body are open through
The Daily Palo Alto.
For the Executive Committee, the
seniors have two vacancies to be filled
and the juniors one vacancy. Nom
inations for all these offices may be
continued in The Daily Palo Alto.
In pursuance of the tentative se
lection by the Men's Conference last

week of men to fill vacancies in the
Student's Council, the assembly voted
verbally to ratify that choice. The
Student Council will now proceed un
der the organization announced last
week.
Temporary appointment of W. G.
Gilroy, '17, and F. W. Weeks, '18, to
meet with the Board of Athletic Con
trol at the Stanford Inn this evening,
in absence of two of the three regular
student members of the board, was
also made by Mr. Miller, owing to the
impossibility of an election before to
day's meeting. These men, with 11. P.
Hauser, '18, a regular member, will
render a report of the proceedings of
the board at the next meeting of the
student body.
The importance of the Board of Ath
letic Control to undergraduate affairs
was emphasized, in connection with
development of Stanford's athletic
policy and the financial situation.
To the new men in the University,
the Student Adviser especially urged
the need of efficiency in the conduct of
student government. The faculty, ac
cording to Mr. Miller, is for student
government, but demands satisfactory
administration.
