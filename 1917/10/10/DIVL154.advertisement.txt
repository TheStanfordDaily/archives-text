The attractive figure
of the well dressed
woman is not the result
of chance corsetting.
It is the result of a
careful selection of a
ccrset thas is scientific
ally correct in design,
and made of selected
fabrics and "stays."
Back Lace IrontLace
represent the best in
corsetry. They are
high class in every de
tail, and there is really
no more economical
purchase for the girl or
woman who is inter
ested in her appearance
and wishes to preserve
her good figure lines
for the years to come.
Be fitted to a Ked
fern, and learn for
yourself how admirable
they are.
