# ATHLETIC BOARD LIMITS RUGBY EXPENSES
## $2,000 FOR BUDGET Graduate Manager Must Bring Season's Outlay Within Amount Fixed 
### 
At a meeting of the Board of Ath
letic Control, held yesterday evening
at the Stanford Inn, the budget for
the coming Rugby season was drawn
ui» and accepted. A sum of $2,000,
necessarily the smallest amount grant
ed for football expenses in many
years, was given Graduate Manager
H. P. Hauser to meet the expenses
of the season; this amount is $4,000
behind the appropriation for last year
and will therefore necessitate greater
economy and cooperation.
The amount granted the Graduate
Manager must cover all the office ex
penses, the expenses of holding the
Santa Clara game at Stanford, and
the cost of importing opponents for
lioth the varsity and freshman teams.
One ray of hope is seen in the fact
that there being so many sport-loving
soldiers quartered near the campus
it is estimated that the attendance at
games ought to increase this year for
that if for no other reason. Privil
eges are to be extended to them, as to
the members of the A. S. S. U. by
lowering the prices.
Ordinary prices for Wednesday
games are to be 25 cents, for students
and soldiers 10 cents; charges for
Saturday games are to be 50 cents,
with students and soldiers admitted
for 25 cents.
If proper support is received by
the administration, in attendance to
games, and complaints about lack of
uniforms and equipment repressed, it
is hoped that the University can pull
through the Rugby season without
being plunged further into debt.
