# FOOTBALL BUDGET
## 
### 
A budget of two thousand dollars has been granted to the Graduate
Manager for the football season and the upkeep of the Graduate Manager's
office until January Ist. This sum includes the purchase of footballs,
putting the field in shape, hiring rubbers, purchasing uniforms for the
final team and all the other incidentals of the football season. This gives
to th eGraduate Manager a problem in economy but few of us would care
to tackle.
It is a problem he cannot solve unless he has the cooperation of the
entire student body. If men out for football need new shoes, unless they
get them just prior to the Santa Clara contest they will have to furnish
them themselves. If many things ordinarily granted to the students are
not given them they can best help the Graduate Manager by refraining
from crabbing. This is a bad year in Stanford athletics from many points
of view and the best thing the students can do is to make the best of a
bad situation.
That budget will undoubtedly be held to strictly but if conditions are
to be bettered in the future both as regards football and the spring sports
the students will have to show that they want it by putting their finacial
support to the wheel through the medium of buying student body tickets
and attending the games.
