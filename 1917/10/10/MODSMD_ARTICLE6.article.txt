# DR. FLEXNER WILL SPEAK BEFORE ASSEMBLY
## IS WORLD AUTHORITY Director of Eastern Institute to Give Medical Aspects of World War 
### 
Dr. Simon Flexner, Director of the.
Rockefeller Institute for Medical Re
search, will speak at the regular Uni
versity Assembly tomorrow morning
at 11 o'clock, on the topic, "Some of
the Medical Aspects of the War."
Dr. Flexner arrived only Sunday
from New York to deliver a series of
medical lectures at Lane Medical
Hall, Stanford Medical School, in San
Francisco. It is through the influence
of President Wilbur that Dr. Flexner
was obtained for this Assembly, and
faculty members who have known
him and his work especially urge that
the talk is worth the while of all stu
dents.
It is seldom that one so famed in
his profession can get the opportun
ity under war conditions to speak be
fore a layman audience. Dr. Flexner
was educated in the most famous of
European universities, and has been
a professor at Johns Hopkins, Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, and holds many
honors conferred by American and
European universities.
