# Conserve Food Is Wilbur's Message
## 
### 
"You've got to decide whether you
are going to play Germany's game or
America's," Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur
said last night, in his address on "The
Present Food Administration, and its
Significance to our Future," in the
Assembly Hall. A large number of
campus and Palo Alto people heard
Dr. Wilbur in the first of the regular
Tuesday evening lectures, bring home
the importance of the food problem
and the part each person can play
in it.
"If we do not get a sufficient sup
ply of food into England, France and
Italy, how are those countries to
maintain themselves in this war?" he
asked. "Can the American people live
in plenty and practice careless waste
while others are starving? If you
waste you are thereby taking food
out of the mouths of some who need
it."
Dr. Wilbur is an authority on the
subject of the food administration,
having served for the past four months
on the Food Commission Hoard at
Washington with Hoover. He graph
ically outlined the work of this board
during its early existence, and told
of the obstacles it has had to over
come. The board has achieved re
markable results from appeals made
to the schools, the churches and the
women of the country. The pledge
campaign among the women of the
United States has brought in about
two milloin members to the Food Ad
ministration. Home gardens alone,
lie stated, have this year added be
tween $435,000,000 and $450,000,000
worth of food to the nation's supply.
The program which Dr. Wilbur out
lined for the people of Palo Alto and
the campus to practice is a simple
one. It consists of four rules: (1)
eat less wheat, —use substitutes, such
as barley, corn and rye; (2) save
meat, —especially pork products; (.1)
use less fats, and (4) save sugar; —
we now eat 90 pounds of sugar per
year per person and this is about
three times too much.
