# New Musicians Out for Stanford Band
## Louis H. Eaton, in Direction, Says Opportunity Exists for New Members 
### 
Stanford Military Band held its
first rehearsal yesterday afternoon,
and though the meeting was poorly
attended, some excellent material was
brought to light. A second rehearsal,
held today, brought out many new
candidates and prospects for a first
class band are bright.
Thirty-two men have reported to
date and many of the old members
have yet to sign up. These veteran
band men, especially the bass and
clarinet men, are requested to see
Manager F. W. Bergstrom in the next
few days. The band is poorly bal
anced at present, at least a dozen new
musicians being needed to complete
the organization.
A number of instruments at the dis
posal of those who are not provided,
and uniforms, will be given out in a
few weeks.
Band men will receive one hour of
University credit.
Rehearsals, conducted by Organist
Louis H. Eaton, are to be held in room
287, Wednesday afternoons at 4
o'clock, until further notice.
