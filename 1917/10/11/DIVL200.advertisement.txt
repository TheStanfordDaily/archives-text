The success that has followed the introduction of the Soft RAIN
IER has been remarkable. From all quarters—from "wet" as well as
"dry" territory—we are daily receiving orders for car loads of this
most delicious, nourishing and healthful liquid food product. Phy
sicians are unstinted in their praise of its wholesomeness and super
ior quality.
WHAT IS SOFT RAIMKK?
THE ANSWER
Soft RAINIER differs entirely from all other "soft" drinks because
it is a thoroughly fermented beverage, with the alcoholic content
completely removed thereafter by a developed and patented process.
It is absolutely non-intoxicating—without a trace of alcohol. Its in
vigorating and refreshing quality comes from its food value.
Drink Soft. RAINIER freely—the more you drink of this delicious
food beverage the greater the good. You can get it at restaurants,
cafes, clubs, soda fountains or wherever soft drinks are dispensed.
Order it by the case for the home from your grocer or dealer. If not
obtainable through your dealer, call, write fir telephone us.
