# LECTURER TELLS NEW MEDICAL DEVICES
## NEW SURGERY NEEDS Dr. Flexner Describes Methods Which Lessen Mortality at Front 
### 
Dr. Simon Flexner gave one more
illustration of how co-operation and
preparedness behind the lines is so
essential to success at the front, this
morning, in his talk in the Assembly
Hall on "Some Medical Aspects of the
War."
"Through the cooperation of sur
gery and science," the noted physician
said, "the Carell-Dakin method of deal
ing with wounds infected from the soil
was discovered. Mortality at the
front from infected wounds is prodig
ious, and for the last dozen years
medical students have been taught
aseptic methods of surgery rather
than antiseptic. Now antiseptic sur
gery os demanded."
Dr. Flexner described the process
by which wounds may be prepared so
that bacteria from the soil in the
trenches might be rendered harmless.
The work of Drs. Carell and Dakin
was described by the lecturer as being
of incalculable value to humanity, for
in addition to the great increase in
the number who will survive, it will
lie invaluable in the case of industrial
accidents.
"Japan has contributed much to re
cent, meical discoveries," the lecturer
told his audience. The problem of
infectious jaundice was solved there.
Japanese scientists found that the dis
ease was spread through the agency
of wild rats and the soil.
"We have the same problem to
meet," continued Dr. Flexner. "We
are at war and must send our troops
to thetrenches. They, too, will have
infectious jaundice, and we must do
our part to prevent the wild rats in
our country from proving a detriment
to our success in the world war.''
