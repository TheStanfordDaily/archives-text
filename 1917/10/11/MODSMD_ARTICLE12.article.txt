# PREPAREDNESS

### 
Stanford is still busy preparing herself for the future calls of the
country in the great war. The world's series, athletics, student body elec
tions and studies are claiming their just and usual share of interest, but
a glance around the gymnasium these days shows an activity unusual to
a marked degree. Men are coming to Major Bugge for advice as to what
course they should pursue. Many of these men are now awaiting orders
to appear for their draft examinations. Some who have registered for the
quarter have already been forced to give up their University work. Others
are not within the draft age or are still far down the list and even these
men are facing this problem in a serious manner as the most important
they have ever been called upon todecide.
The real activity, however, is among those who are continuing their
work in addition are taking military drill. These men are busy now being
fitted out with uniforms and shoes and Major Bugge and his assistants are
busy from morning till night. The work is new to a great majority of the
men while to many it is a rehearsal of former experiences, but to all it
means the same thing, an extremely valuable course from which a great
deal can be gained not only by the individuals themselves but for the
nation as well.
