# Soccer Men Will Play Picked S. F. Teams Saturdays
## 
### 
In the fact that more than twenty
men turned out for the first soccer
practice, that from thirty to thirty
five are expected out today, and that
many of these men have had experi
ence on last year's first and second
varsity, R. E. McClung, '18, who is as
sisting Harry Maloey in coaching,
sees an exceptionally bright year for
soccer. McClung believes that there
is a wealth of material among the
new men for varsity and freshman
teams, and hopes to form a second
varsity also. As a nuceleus, three of
the old men are back. They are Mc-
Clung, '18, D. R. Drury, '17, and P. R.
Yewell, '17.
Harry Maloney has arranged for
picked city teams to be sent down on
alternate Saturdays for practice
games, and plans to send the varsity
to San Francisco when no games are
scheduled on the campus. Games are
expected with teams from Camp Fre
mont, composed of regular army men
and National Guards. The interclass
will be held during Junior Week in the
spring quarter. Practice games will
take place between the home squads
this Saturday, and a regular practice
game with a city team is scheduled
for a week later.
Soccer men are fortunate in being
coached by Baldwin and Pike, two of
the city's best players, now living in
Palo Alto, who have agreed to assist
in the coaching of the varsity and
freshman teams.
Men taking soccer for gym work
may be allowed to show up on Tues
days, Wednesdays and Thursdays, in
stead of the first schedule of Tues
days, Thursday and Saturdays.
The return of Captain-elect Roney,
'17, is uncertain, for although drafted,
the former soccer player has a good
chance lor exemption.
