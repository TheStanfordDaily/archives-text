## 
### 
Miss Harriet Bradford, Dean of
Women, announced at the women's
meeting Monday night that the Uni
versity is working on the war emer
gency classes for women. It is now
certain that courses in dietetics and
wireless telegraphy will be given and
probably in machine work on auto
mobiles. Instructors in Red Cross
work are extremely hard to obtain at
the present time, but if possible this
course will he given. If the course
in machine work is given, it will be
open only to women who are experi
enced chauffeurs.
Miss Bradford also announced that
a vocational department under the
Dean of Women will be started this
year. In the near future every Uni
versity woman will be summoned to
meet the Dean and to talk over her
chosen vocation, or if she has none,
to choose one.
"At Homes" will be held one day
a week in the Women's Club House,
at which all Stanford women are in
vited to have an informal chat with
the Dean of Women.
