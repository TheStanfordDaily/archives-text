### 
"1422 or bust!" has announced
Graduate Manager H. P. Hauser in
referring to the number of members
of tli estudent body that he hoped to
have by the time that the great drive
for A. S. S. U. members closes. The
campaign opens tonight and from the
present appearances of organization,
enthusiasm and good management the
Graduate Manager's predictions ought
to be fulfilled.
A thorough canvass of the campus
is to be made through the medium of
the living groups. A member from
every fraternity, sorority, eating club
and hall, has been appointed to swell
the ranks of the members of the stu
dent body, by adding the names of
those in his or her living group to
the list of student body ticket hold
ers. Two handsome pennants are in
ers. Two handsome banners are to be
awarded to winners respectively of
the men's and women's divisions.
Winners will be chosen by calculating
which house or group has nearest a
student body membership of 100 per
cent.
