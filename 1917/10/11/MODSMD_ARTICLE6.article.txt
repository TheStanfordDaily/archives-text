# COACH WYLIE TO WRITE SERIES ON RUGBY
## TEACHES FINE POINTS Backfield Will Be Subject of New Zealander's Initial Article 
### 
Coach Jim Wylie will commence to
day a series of articles dealing with
the fine points in the Rugby game
for the benefit of men who are not
acquainted with this style of piay.
Coach VVylie's first contribution deals
with the work of the backfleld men
but he will cover all branches in the
several articles he turns out.
Men who are not acquainted with
the game as "she are played*' will find
an opportunity here to become pro
ficient through the knowledge of one
of the greatest players that ever don
ned a suit.
By Jim Wylie.
My object in writing a few ar
ticles each week in The Daily Palo
Alto is to help those players who
have never played Rugby or have
only a slight knowledge of the
game. I am not going to atempt to
cover every branch of the sport in
these columns because I think it
unnecessary and better results can
be obtained by dealing with gen
eral principles of our fall sport and
how they should be applied.
In these articles I shall set forth
what I consider to be some of the
general and ncccssary qualifica
tions of players in the different po
sitions.
Beginning with the backs. There
is little occasion to distinguish be
tween their different varieties, for
I believe in every man being suited
for his position and though special
izing in his particular post should
make himself proficient in the par
ticular methods of men occupying
other positions on the field.
In order to become a first class
back, much steady patience, grit,
and unlimited practice are abso
lutely necessary. He should be
able to kick with both feet, to toss
either side, and take a ball when
fronting it as it is coming toward
him. He must have lots of speed,
be a sound tackier, and a reliable
punt-kicker.
