# KELLOGG BACK TO STANFORD FOR DUTIES
## VISIT MAY BE SHORT Belgian Relief Work Not Abandoned; Hoover Still Head, Says Professor 
### 
Professor Vernon L. Kellogg, on
the campus for the first time since
May 1915, today discussed with a
Daily Palo Alto reporter various
I phases of (he Food Administration's
I work, together with some of there
, cent developments in regard to the
l Commission for Relief in Belgium.
Professor Kellogg prefaced his re
marks by announcing that he had re
turned to continue his work at Stan
ford for an uncertain period. He
then took special pains to point out
that, contrary to popular belief, the
Commission for Relief in Belgium has
not abandoned its work, and that Mr.
j Herbert C. Hoover, national food ad
| ministrator, was still the head of the
j commission. However, the professor
asserted that all the work has to be
done through neutral channels and
I that practically the only offices main
taining their original personnel were
i those at New York, London and Rot
etrdam.
Mr. Hoover has thoroughly organ
ized the Food Administration and by
this time, Professo rKellogg said, na
tional conservation campaigns are
well started. Probably the greatest
nation-wide propaganda yet under
taken will be Food Conservation
Week, October 21 to 28, during which
period strenuous ecorts will be made
to have, householders pledge them
selves to stand back of the govern
ment in its ecorts for the prevention
o fwaste; to do this they will be
asked to pledge themselves to observe
the directions or objections of the
Food Administration. Those who
pledge themselves to this purpose will
be given personal cards of enrollment
as members of the Food Administra
tion, and window cards, showing that
; they have done their bit to help their
uountry.
