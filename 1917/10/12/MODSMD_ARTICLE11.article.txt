# Professor S.S. Seward to Receive Commission
## 
### 
I-"or some days past the rumor lias
been going the rounds of the Quad
j that Professor S. S. Seward, formerly
of the English department and now
with the National Army in the Am
bulance Corps at Allentown, has re
ceived a commission of first lieutenant
in that branch of the service.
Although no definite confirmation of
this report has yet been received by
Professor Seward's friends on the fac
ulty, it is expected at any moment, as
it is already definitely known that
Professor Seward has been recom
mended by the commanding officer for
his commission, the rest being merely
red tape and formality.
