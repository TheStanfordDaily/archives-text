What the freshmen will do in their
first contest is an uncertain question.
From early dope the Twenty-one fif
teen will Ijo the fastest first-year team
of reccnt years. The dope may go
wrong, however, and a losing team
result. Coach Wylie put the babes
through a hard practice game last
night and while they showed to good
advantage at times there is a lack
of finish which will take much coach
ing to bring about. The backfield
will lie strong but the forwards are
as yet inexperienced and their style
of play tomorrow is hard to foretell.
The second varsity should have no
difficulty with the fifteen from Lowell
High School in San Francisco. Sev
eral of the forwards showed up well
against the varsity while the backs !
are fairly well organized.
Coach Wylie has picked his fresh- j
men from results in practice and plans j
putting in several substitutes before i
the game to get a line on all the pros- j
pective players. Marx and Henry !
will hold down the front rank posi
tion with Dickey, Campbell and Pat
rick, side rankers. Wallace and
.Wright complete the scrum at rear
rank. This line-up while not so
strong as the backfield, wll put up a
good battle. The hookers work to
gether to such an extent that they are
assured the ball most of the time.
The rest of the forwards have not
been together consistently in prelim
inary contests so it is impossible to
judge how they will go.
Hansen, wing forward; Doe, half;
Nagel, first five; Sheldon, second five;
Morris, Austin, wings; Templeton,
center three, and W. Kinney at full
will show the bleachers some fast
passing rushes.
