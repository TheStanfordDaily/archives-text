# RUGBY OPENS WITH THREE GOOD CONTESTS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Nineteen-Seventeen Rugby will open with a three-game drive tomorrow
when tho varsity takes on the Palo Alto Atliletic Club, the freshmen meet
Polytechnic High School of San Francisco, and tlie All-lUacks play the
Lowell High fifteen. The first contests will come at 1:30 on tho varsity

field when the freshmen play. The
varsity game will conic immediately
after, followed by the sccond varsity
scramble.
(J. E. Luhrs, '18, yell leader, and
"Dutch" Hergstrom, '18, leader of the
band, announce that they will be out
in force to liven the occasion with
music and yells. In addition, Coach
Wylie announces his intention of giv
ing every man a chance to get: a shot
at the ball and the bleacher warmers
will have an opportunity for the first
time of seeing their favorites in ac
tion.
"With only four former players in
the list the varsity strength is hard
to dope out. From preliminary play
the scrum is much more powerful
than the backfield. In Swarts, Win
ham, Pettingill, and Schwarzenbek,
two varsity men and two varsity sub
stitutes, a nucleus is formed around
which ( oaeli Wylie can develop some
good men. The backfield is new, how
ever. With the exception of Wark
and Templeton none of the men have
had experience to any extent.
Picks Fifteen.
or the Palo Alto Club game Coach
Wylie has chosen men who showed up
well in the interfraternity series and
in the practice game last night.
Haines and Curtice, both new men, are
slated for the front rank. These two
hookers work well together but their
strength in a game is unknown. The
middle rank looks to be the best part
of the forward pack. In Swarts, lock,
with Winham and Flood, side rankers,
Coach Wylie has picked three varsity
men. The rear rank .also, with Cap
tain Pettingill and Schwarzonbek,
! looks .good to the dopesters.
The backfleld is the uncertain
; quantity. Chandler at wing forward
is an experienced and fast man,
| while Ilauser at half will go good.
'The rest of the bucks with the ex
ception of Wark at Jirstffire,v r e, are new.
At present D. Levy is slated for sec
ond five, Lilly for center three and
i Weeks and Gibbs for wings. Temple
j ton at full is, of course, known to be
the best man on the coast in his posi
tion.
