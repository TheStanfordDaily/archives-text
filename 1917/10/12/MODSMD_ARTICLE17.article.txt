# FIGHT 'EM UP, VARSITY!
## 
### 
The opening gun of the Rugby season will be tired tomorrow afternoon
when three games will be played on the varsity field. Although Coach
Wylie has had a very short time in which to pick the men who will form
the lineups for these games, individually the men have been showing up
in line shape and it remains to be seen what sort of showing they will
make when combined. As well as giving the fans an opportunity to get a
line on the new material, tomorrow afternoon's contests will also mark the
first appearance of the candidates for yen leader.
The fact that these men are getting into the opening games does not
mean that it is too late for new men to come out lor football. No one so
far has any hold on any position on the team and if a new man comes out
who can win a place it is open for him. So far there has not been the
turnout a university the size of Stanford can expect. According to Mr.
Maloney, of the Physical Training department, there are a great many men
in the two lower classes who so far have not signed up for either physical
training or military drill. A careful check is being made on these men
and if it is found that anyone is trying to get away from it will be dealt
with accordingly. The military and physical training departments have
given every possible aid to football this year and there is no reason why
every man physically able should not be out for football.
Student body ticket holders will reap the first benefits tomorrow in the
nature of reduced admissions, being admitted at half price.
