## 
### 
Manager "Dutch" Bergstrom, '18, of
the Stanford Band announces that
enough men have turned out to form
the usual two bands, bleacher and
concert, and expects to have the
bleacher band in shape for the first
Saturday games. Thirty men are out
this fall in comparison with forty
last year, but if tlieSe men show up
consistently the iilck of additional
members will not be felt so seriously.
Organist Eaton v ill be assisted in
directing the baniÂ» by P. H. Carter,
'IS, the new student leader.
Stanford Hand will meet for the
third time next Wednesday afternoon
at 4 and will rehearse every Sat
urday before games at 1:30. Mem
bers are asked to show up regularly
and promptly to get into shape for
the first game, expected a week from
Saturday.
The Hand dance is to be held on
November 17th, either at Encina gym
nasium or the Armory. Manager
Bergstrom is trying to arrange for
the Gymnasium, where such a success
ful danco was staged last year, but
nothing definite has been decided. A
lively "jazz" band is assured, and a
large crowd is planned for.
