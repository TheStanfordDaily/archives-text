# VARSITY WALLOPS ATHLETIC CLUBMEN IN 1917 OPENER
## 
### 
Two wins and one loss was the re
sult of Saturday's opening football
carnival. The varsity trounced the
Palo Alto Athletic Club in the feature
by the score of 26 to 11, the fresh
men were victors over Polytechnic, 19
to 0, while the All-Blacks were beaten
by the fast Lowell High School
fifteen, 16 to 3.
In a contest featured by loose play
ing at times, and to offset this some
fast Rugby, the varsity were winners
over their old rivals from Palo Alto.
Winham at side rank and later at
wing-forward, was the individual star
for the varsity, scoring consistently
and breaking up many plays. Swarts
at lock was not far behind in his ag
gressive playing. For the Athletic
Club, Esola, Card and Angell counted
in every score, and in addition played
strong defensive.
The first score came for the varsity
when Curtice went over from the
scrum. Templeton converted a dif
ficult goal. Palo Alto drew next
blood when Angell scored on a pass
from Card. Kirksey converted. The
varsity counted twice again this half,
the first a goal from a free kick by
Templeton, and the second a try by
Swarts from the scrum. Templeton
failed a difficult conversion. Score, 11
to 5.
At the beginning of the second per
iod Winham went over from the scrum
and Templeton converted. This was
followed by a pretty passing rush by
'lie Athletic Club for a try, Risling to
Pratt to Ilisling to Loder to Esola.
Conversion failed. Winham then
counted again and the try was con
verted. Not to be outdone Esola
counted on a rush. The varsity in
the last few minutes went over when
Lilly picked the hall in the open.
Templeton converted. Final score, 26
to S.
On the whale the varsity played

better than expected. The bet'ore-the
game dope proved to be true, however,
since the scoring came from the scrum
and not from passing rushes. The
forwards all worked well together but
the backfleld, with the exception of
Wai'k, could not get started.
