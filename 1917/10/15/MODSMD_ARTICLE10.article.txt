# Change Weight of Dollar, Says Fisher
## Yale Professor Favors Varying Silver Content to Remedy Price Change 
### 
That the only means by which price
movements can be remedied is to
change the weight of the dollar and
thus keep the purchasing power of
the dollar uniform was the policy ad
vocated by Irving Fisher, professor of
Political Economy at Yale, at a lec
ture on "Price Movements" in the Lit
tle Theater, Saturday evening. The
weight of the dollar can be fixed by
means of index numbers, said Pro
lessor Fisher, thus standardizing the
coin as well as the commodities which
it purchases.
The proper remedy for the high cost
of living should be applied to the
money and not the thing, he said. We
live in a money atmosphere and there
fore do not realize its variation. Few
evils of society are equal to the fluc
tuating price of the dollar, so it is
evident that it is the purchasing price
â– that needs regulation.
Professor Fisher was introduced by
I M. S. Wildman, head of th;< Economics
! department ;it Stanford, who paid a
high tribute to Professor Fisher's rep
utation.
In opening Professor Fisher said he
was glad to be at Stanford because
he was reminded of the Yale spirit,
which seems to prevail here. Contin
uing. he said Stanford had good cause
to lie proud of Herbert Hoover, but
it must not expect that Mr. Hoover
is going to affect the general price,
level. That is a job which is too big
for one man, and cannot be accom
plislied. However, it is one of Mr.
Hoover's objects to keep some prices
up in order to maintain the general
prosperity.
By means of diagrams drawn by
himself and others, Professor Fisher
illustrated by the index system the
comparative rise and decline of prices
in different countries according to the
money standard in vogue. In nearly
all cases, it is found that there is a
similarity in price movements wher
ever the standards are the same.
Wherever they differ, the prices vary.
Some people claim that speculators
have to do with price movements, but
Professor Fisher stated that the part
the food speculator plays is a minor
one.
Index numbers are a recognized
success by this time, and there is 110
doubt as to their practical use.
