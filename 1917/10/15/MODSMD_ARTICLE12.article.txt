# DYING?
## 
### 
Pep was sadly lacking at the opening games of the Rugby season last
Saturday. Jt is true that organized rooting was impossible due lo the lack
of yell leaders, but there is no excuse for such a situation as arose Satur
day when scarcely a word of encouragement was given 011 the scoring of
the initial try of the season. It does not take the leadership of a yell
leader to show our appreciation of the team's work when they carry the
ball over the line for the first time, and if it does things are in a deplorable
condition. The coach and team are up against the toughest proposition in
the history of Stanford athletics and they are now facing it with the true
Stanford spirit. If these men, who are doing the real work for ultimate vic
tory, can show the fight of former Stanford varsities, the least we can do is
to back them in it.
According to the schedule, but three weeks remain until the freshmen
play Santa Clara freshmen, and dining those three weeke there will be
games every Wednesday and Saturday. Yell leaders will be 011 hand be
fore the end of this week, and 110 excuse will remain for a repetition of Sat
urday's performance. Such support as was given Saturday is enough to
take the fight out of any team. Let us realize our responsibility before it
is too late and put the Cardinal on the map for another Big Game victory.
A cry of lack of enthusiasm also conies from the women's gymnasium
because of the small turnout of women for athletics. California women
are sending down challenges for competition in various lines of sport. To
turn them down is admitting defeat without a contest, and that has never
been the nature of Stanford's relations with California. The Women's
Athletic Association deserves the support of its members as much as the
Associated Students deserve the support of their members. We must all
of us show more support to all activities or forfeit the right to claim a
Stanford spirit equivalent to that of former years.
