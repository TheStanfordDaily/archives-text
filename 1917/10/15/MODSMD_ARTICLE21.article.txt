Y. M. C. A. Cabinet laid out a big
program for the coming year when it
met in the Union Wednesday evening.
Secretaries Worthy md Weideman
addressed a well represented Cabinet
and outlined extensive plans which
will call for the establishment of at
least twenty Bible-study classes on the
campus and half as many more in
Palo Alto. The plans also call for
the assuming of a large sum in the big
thirty-five million dollar drive for
funds which the national organization
will undertake in the near future.
The entire Cabinet are optimistically
inclined to believe that the coming
year will be one of the most success
ful in the history of Y. M. C. A. work
at Stanford.
