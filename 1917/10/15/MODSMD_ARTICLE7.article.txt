# U.C. Women Ask Hockey Contest
## 
### 
California women have issued a
challenge to Stanford members of the
"500" to play hockey. If such a con
test is played it will he the first time
Stanford women have met a team
from Berkeley. Those interested in
tiie sport may sign up at Roble gym
nasium and an endeavor will he made
to organize for a match.
Itoble gymnasium has been in full
swing for the past week, though many
women have signed for training who
have not been reporting. Aside from
the fact that gymnasium is a require
ment of the University for underclass
men and cuts must be made up, the
absences are proving serious since Cal
ifornia women have a two months'
start and if Stanford is to succeed in
sports between the two universities it
must get into training at once.
