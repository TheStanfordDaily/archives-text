# WAR RELIEF TO COMMENCE FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
## 
### 
"War Enlistment Day for Women"
will be Friday, October 19, when all
members ot' the "500" will be given an
opportunity to enlist in the particular
type of work which appeals to them.
To insur esuccess in this movement,
one of the most vital to Stanford, an
assembly will be held Thursday at
which Dr. Frank Angell will explain
the need of such work as well as its
relation to war service organized all
over the United States and Europe.
The sign-up day conies as a result of
a realization on the part of the women
that their share in the work of war
service has been so far a minus quan
tity.
Stanford women as a whole have
been slow to respond to the demand
lor service which college women are
capable of rendering and have been
doing in other sections of the coun
try, and the need for organized work
011 this campus has been keenly felt.
A wide variety of opportunities have
been opened to the women already in
the plans as discussed so far by the
committee in charge.
All details ar enot yet arranged, but
in general the offers will include sup
port of French Reconstruction Work
(California as a state has pledged to
reclaim the Peromie district in north
ern France); support of work in
prison camps where American sol
diers will soon be found, under the
auspices of the Y. W.-Y. M. C. A.; Red
Cross support—both time and money
for the purchase of materials and
knitting of garments as well as roll
ing of bandages; and finally attend
ance at war emergency classes which
will probably be arranged, provided
enough women are interested. Al
ready a class in dictetics has been or
ganized to meet 011 Tuesday, Thurs
day and Saturday, with a prospect of
work in wireless, nursing and auto
mobile mechanics, yet to be arranged.
All branches of work in this move
ment are to be organized and accom
plished by Stanford women them
selves, —they will make it a success or
a failure. Further details will be an
nounced at a later date. The follow
ing women are acting chairmen of the
various committees and may be ap
proached for information:
French Reconstruction, Dorothy
Driscoll, Kappa Kappa Gamma;
prison work, Josephine Welch, Pi Beta
Phi; Red Cross work, Emily Loomis,
Kappa Alpha Theta; Red Cross sub
scriptions, Shea Noack, Alpha Phi;
War Emergency classes, Lois Eld
ridge. Itoble.

That Stanford will be asked to raise
several thousands of dollars for the
use of the Y. M. C. A. in war relief is
the result of a conference of dele
sates from the Western States held in'
San Francisco last Friday. The dona
tion from this University will come as
a part of a $50,000 fund alloted to
colleges in California and included in
$85,000,000 to he collected from the
entire United States.
The campaign by the Y. M. C. A.
conies as a result of a decision by
the War Council which recently con
vened at Niagara Falls, to raise funds
for use in Europe, The money will
be used, through invitation of the
Allies, in Italy, France, Russia, and
I Servia, in addition to the work in the
I armies of the United States.
| As an opening for the Stanford
| campaign a meeting was held in the
i Union, Sunday, attended by both the
Y. AT. C. A. and Y. W. C. A., and mem-
I bers of the faculty. Reports were
i heard from several men who have
I been active in Russia and Germany,
and the necessity for such work was
emphasized strongly. In addition pre
liminary plans were discussed for the
conduct of the campaign here. Com
plete plans will be out in a few days.
Saturday occurred the State Stu
dent Conference to raise the $50,000
alloted to the universites. It was de
cided to raise $25,000 at the Univer
sity of California and the remainder
jat other institutions. Stanford's
share, while not definitely decided on,
[Will be several thousands. The fol-
S lowing men and women were present
at the conference: Henrietta Dickey,
'20, Aida Gilchriste, '19, Miss Harriet
Bradford, Professor R. L. Green, A. E.
Worthy. '15, C. C. Wiedeman, '17, and
G. I. Lynn. '18.
