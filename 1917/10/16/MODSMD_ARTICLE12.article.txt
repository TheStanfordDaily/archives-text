# DEBATERS TRYOUT ON WEDNESDAY EVENING
## MEET BERKELEY SOON Several Contests Arranged for Fall and Winter Terms by Coach Leib 
### 
With the California debate only a
little over a month away the local
aspirants for positions on the team
are setting down to brass tacks, and
are hard at work preparing for the
tryouts which will be held in the Lit
tle Theater Wednesday evening. Six
veterans are back at the game, and
it looks as though California would
have to face stiff competition when
they come up against the Cardinal
speakers on November 23. In spite of
the fact that there are several old
men back all new men are urged to
try out for one of the positions on
the squad. Coach Karl Leib recently
said, when emphasizing the point,
"Every position is vacant on the teams
tliat are being chosen and every
man, new or old, will have an equal
chance to make the squad."
The debating calendar outlined for
1917-1S is perhaps the most extensive
in the history of debating at Stan
ford. Every possible effort is being
made to secure a contest with the
University of Southern California on
the same night as the one with Cali
fornia. Following these events there
will be intersociety debates in which
the winner of the Euphronia-Nestoria
debate will, with all probability, meet
the Women's Debating Club. Coach
Leib optimistically prophesies that the
winners of the men's societies will
meet some undefeatable competition
when they face the co-ed orators. The
Freshman-Sophomore debate, coming
early in the winter quarter, promises
to bring out new material from the
ranks of the lower classes, and the
intercollegtate-intersociety debate will
udoubtedly be the feature of the sea
son. In this manner the best de
bating society of Stanford and Cali
fornia will be selected.
The feature of the spring months
will be the Carnot Medal contests
and several experienced Cardinal men
i will make a strong bid for the honors.
There is a possibility that the Carnot
Medal contest will be preceded by a
tri-state debate with the universities
of Washington and Oregon.
As the first varsity debaters cannot
possibly take part in all the contests
there will be a splendid opportunity
for new men to make a showing. All
those making practice squads for de
bating will be given college credit for
some of the time put into the work.
rntercollegiate tryouts begin tomor
row at 2:30 p.m. All who have not
previously represented the University
on debating teams will report at
room 214 at that. time. All new men
will be heard in the afternoon and in
the evening, beginning at 7:30, the ex
perienced debaters who have been on
former teams will try out. A squad of
ten will be picked by the coach at the
close of the evening tryouts. Ques
tion: "Resolved, That in war time the
I Federal government should employ
conscription of labor to insure the
I necessary output of war materials.''
