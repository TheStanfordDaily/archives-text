# WOMEN AND OTHER THINGS
## 
### 
We would like a little further explanation of the recent rulings made
for women of the University. We have heard considerable comment in re
gard to them and in these comments the same questions have risen to such
an extent that we believe further explanation would be appreciated by
everyone and perhaps save trouble rising later from a misunderstanding
rather than from any wilful infringement of their conditions.
As we understand it, these rulings are to be held to rigidly. We inter
pret that to mean technically also. For example, if a girl arrived on a
late train or was through no fault of her own detained from keeping the
ten-thirty rule, she cannot take a taxi even though she is out after ten
thirty, and could by taking a taxi protect herself vastly better than if forced
to take the car. Or, on the other hand, if a woman left her machine in
front of a sorority house before dinner, is she forced to leave it in front
of the house all night rather than take it to the garage where she ord
inariluy keeps it, for fear she will be caught in a machine after dark? Are
the women of the University to be forced to go back and forth to dances in
light dancing slippers on rainy nights simply because a ruling says they
must suffer wet feet or other greater or less consequences, when a very
nominal sum of money could prevent this by a perfectly proper means of
transportation? We have cited here only a very few of the questions we
have heard in regard to the question.
We ask these questions purely out of curiosity and because we of the
male portion of the student body suffer as well as those of the five hun
dred for whom the rules were made. We have no doubt but that they
were drawn up only after earnest consideration and with the belief that
there was a real necessity for them. As they stand now they sound to us
more like boarding-school regulations than rules .of conduct for University
women. From what we know of the present five hundred and those who
who have preceded them in the past few years, we give them credit for
sufficient discretion to render such a set of rules unnecessary. May we be
enlightened on this question as a matter of self-protection and* out of jus
tice to those who drew up the rules?
