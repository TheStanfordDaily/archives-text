Major Jens Hugge, U. S. A., retired,
| has received a copy of a message that
| Major General Pershing sent to the
War Department, regarding the train
ing ot' soldiers. Major Hugge sug
gests that the idea relating to salutes
be carried out on himself and In
structor H. W. Maloney, and so in
future all military students are asked
to salute these two officers and re
jmain in position until the salute is
answered. By these means Major
; Hugge hopes to rectify the faults men
tioned in the message.
Tiie note follows: "1 can not too
strongly impress upon War Depart
ment the absolute necessity of rigid
insistence that all men be thoroughly
grounded in schools of soldiers.
Salutes should be rendered by both
officers and men in most military
manner with special emphasis on
rigid position of soldiers in saluting
and when at. attention. A prompt mil
itary salute is often misunderstood
by our people, but it simply empha
sizes an aggressive attitude of mind
and body that marks the true soldier.
The loyalty, readiness and alertness
indicated by strictest adherence to
this principle will immensely increase
the pride and fighting spirit of our
troops. The slovenly, unmilitary,
careless habits that have grown up in
peace times in our army are seriously
detrimental to the aggressive attitude
that must prevail from highest to low
est in our forces. Strict methods
used at West Point, N. Y., in training
new cadets in these elementary prin
ciples have given the Academy its
superior excellence. Those methods
should be applied rigorously and com
pletely in the forces we are now or
ganizing. (Signed) Pershing."
