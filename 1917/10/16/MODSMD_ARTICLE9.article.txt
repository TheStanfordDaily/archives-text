# Wylie Tells How to Play at Half
## 
### Jim Wylie 
In my last article I dealt briefly
with some of the necessary quali
fications of a backfleld player. With
the observations and such insistence
on the elements of versatility one
may glance briefly at the indispen
sable qualifications for individual po
sitions.
Tiie halfback is the man behind the
gun, so to speak. He is the man who
in his time lias to do a little of every
thing, and do it well. We look to
him to do the hard routine work of
watching the scrum and doing the
proper thing when the ball comes out
on his side and also expect him to
show flashes of individuality on bis
own account when anything like an
opening is presented.
In my opinion the place for the half
is from one to two yards behind the
scrum and when the ball is heeled to
him by his forwards it is his duty to '
initiate an attack with all possible
speed, at the same time keeping an
eagle eye on the movements ol' the
opposition half, who will direct his
attention to him the moment liis side
lias lost possession of the ball.
Everything depends on his promptness
and skill in opening up an attack. He
must start the ball out to his first
five-eighths like a shot from a gun.
The slightest hesitation and the great
opportunity is lost. Everything de
pends on the rapidity with which the
movement is executed. On some oc
casions, however, the half may get
right up to his opponents' wing three
quarter line before it is necessary to
part with the ball. Of course, lie
should bp harked up all the time by
his five-eighths, waiting for him to
get into trouble and about to be
tackled. These occasions, however, ]
are few and far between in a Rugby
game, and a halfback should not be.
blinded by his success in one of these
movements. He is the man above all
others who is called upon to use a
little cunning and strategy in circum
stances of this kind and to spring the
unexpected.
In a few words, the chief qualifica
tion of a halfback are already indi
cated. He must be quick in getting
the ball away from the scrum, thereby
setting his backs in motion without
delay. He should be both quick and
a good punter, and particularly, an
adept punter, so that he can punt over
his head to touch without turn
ing around, as on many occasions he
is forced to do from his position at
the time, especially when his oppon
ents are on him. Moreover, he must
be good at starting the rush, as he
may have the whole pack of opposing
forwards coming down on him, and
speed and skill in such an emergency
count for everything, if he is to ex
tricate his side from danger. A good
halfback is a great player, he is the
key of the attack, and one of the most
indispensable men on the team.

opening is presented.
In my opinion the place for the half
is from one to two yards behind the
scrum and when the ball is heeled to
him by his forwards it is his duty to '
initiate an attack with all possible
speed, at the same time keeping an
eagle eye on the movements ol' the
opposition half, who will direct his
attention to him the moment liis side
lias lost possession of the ball.
Everything depends on his promptness
and skill in opening up an attack. He
must start the ball out to his first
five-eighths like a shot from a gun.
The slightest hesitation and the great
opportunity is lost. Everything de
pends on the rapidity with which the
movement is executed. On some oc
casions, however, the half may get
right up to his opponents' wing three
quarter line before it is necessary to
part with the ball. Of course, lie
should bp harked up all the time by
his five-eighths, waiting for him to

game, and a halfback should not be.

movements. He is the man above all
others who is called upon to use a
little cunning and strategy in circum

unexpected.
In a few words, the chief qualifica
tion of a halfback are already indi
cated. He must be quick in getting
the ball away from the scrum, thereby
setting his backs in motion without
delay. He should be both quick and
a good punter, and particularly, an
adept punter, so that he can punt over
his head to touch without turn
ing around, as on many occasions he
is forced to do from his position at
the time, especially when his oppon
ents are on him. Moreover, he must
be good at starting the rush, as he
may have the whole pack of opposing
forwards coming down on him, and
speed and skill in such an emergency
count for everything, if he is to ex
tricate his side from danger. A good
halfback is a great player, he is the
key of the attack, and one of the most
indispensable men on the team.
In my last article I dealt briefly
with some of the necessary quali

the observations and such insistence

Tiie halfback is the man behind the
gun, so to speak. He is the man who
in his time lias to do a little of every
thing, and do it well. We look to
him to do the hard routine work of
watching the scrum and doing the
proper thing when the ball comes out
on his side and also expect him to
show flashes of individuality on bis
own account when anything like an
