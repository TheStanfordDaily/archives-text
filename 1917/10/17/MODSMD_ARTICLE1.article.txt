### 
Dr. Angell of the Psychology de
partment will deliver an address at
tomorrow's assembly on the student
end of war relief. Especial emphasis
will he laid on the need of response
from Stanford men and women to the
really grave situation confronting
them. Students are to be urged to aid
in the campaign for the Belgian and
French relief.
This address will be of especial
value to Stanford women because it
will give them ideas on which to base
their choice of war work on Friday,
War Enlistment Day for women.
Every woman will be expected to sign
up for some type of work with the
War Emergency committee, which of
fers the following:
(1) Support of French Reconstruc-1
tion AVork by money and support of
all efforts to raise money. Recon
stuction of a certain village in north
ern France has been pledged by Cali
fornia. This village was completely
destroyed by the Germans and the
economy of building up this district
in order that the peasants may return
and again raise crops and graze cattle
is obvious. Stanford alumni have al
ready taken a large share in this
work. Dr. Angell. Mr. Iloover, and
Mr. and Mrs. Kellogg have shown par-,
ticular interest. So far the students
have done nothing, but it is now up
to them to take a hand In this work.
(2) Support of Prison Camp Work
by money and time and energy in the
November campaign. This work is
under the Y. M. C. A. and the Y. W.
C. A.

carrying on of lied Cross work on the
campus. This money will be used for
the purchase of materials, gauze, knit
ting wool, etc.

Cross work at the Women's Club
House. This auxiliary will be strictly
for students and is apart from any
previously organized auxiliaries.
