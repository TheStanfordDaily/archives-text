# News From Front! By Ambulance Man

George Hall, ex-'l9, who is now in
the third unit of the Stanford Am
bulance Corps, has written a letter
from Paris to an Alpha Delta Phi
brother here and tells of the ex
periences lie and his group have been
through since the unit was ordered to
the actual firing line. He says, in
part:
"Our unit has been attached for
some time to what is generally con
sidered the best attacking division in
the French army. It is used only for
hard offensive work and so is 'en
repos' a great deal of the time in pro
portion to the time they are in the
trenches. They are nearly all young
men—the best that are left —and the
division has more citations and decor
ations than any other in France. The
ambulance section which was with
them before was composed of French
drivers and in their two years of
service six out of twenty were killed
and fourteen got the 'Croix de Guerre.'
The section also received the 'Croix
de Guerre' citation as a unit and had
their cars decorated. We hope that
our unit in replacing theirs will get
along without the C. de G..'s if neces

the same French lieutenant that they
had. He was asked to continue in our
section because he did so well with
the other. He's a peach of a fellow
although he can't speak a word of
English Under him, Walt. Gores has
been elected as sergeaut, chief de
Buzz-wagon, so to speak ,of the auto
mobiles.
"Two French chefs give us excellent
food. A number of them have the
'Croix de Guerre,' and two of the ser
geants and one of the corporals come
from the best and oldest of French
families. The corporal is a baron.
You may smile at all of this, but it is
quite true, and it is all needed and
they fit into the unit excellently.
"I believe I told you that we have
twenty Flat ambulances and a big
Camion motor truck to carry supplies.
Our Fiats are proving very satisfac
tory, very comfortable, and have
plenty of power and speed and they
are not. difficult to keep up. I thank
my stars a dozen times that we were
not in a Ford.
