# News From Front! By Ambulance Man

### 
George Hall, ex-'l9, who is now in
the third unit of the Stanford Am
bulance Corps, has written a letter
from Paris to an Alpha Delta Phi
brother here and tells of the ex
periences lie and his group have been
through since the unit was ordered to
the actual firing line. He says, in
part:
"Our unit has been attached for
some time to what is generally con
sidered the best attacking division in
the French army. It is used only for
hard offensive work and so is 'en
repos' a great deal of the time in pro
portion to the time they are in the
trenches. They are nearly all young
men—the best that are left —and the
division has more citations and decor
ations than any other in France. The
ambulance section which was with
them before was composed of French
drivers and in their two years of
service six out of twenty were killed
and fourteen got the 'Croix de Guerre.'
The section also received the 'Croix
de Guerre' citation as a unit and had
their cars decorated. We hope that
our unit in replacing theirs will get
along without the C. de G..'s if neces
sary to avoid the fatalities. We have
the same French lieutenant that they
had. He was asked to continue in our
section because he did so well with
the other. He's a peach of a fellow
although he can't speak a word of
English Under him, Walt. Gores has
been elected as sergeaut, chief de
Buzz-wagon, so to speak ,of the auto
mobiles.
"Two French chefs give us excellent
food. A number of them have the
'Croix de Guerre,' and two of the ser
geants and one of the corporals come
from the best and oldest of French
families. The corporal is a baron.
You may smile at all of this, but it is
quite true, and it is all needed and
they fit into the unit excellently.
"I believe I told you that we have
twenty Flat ambulances and a big
Camion motor truck to carry supplies.
Our Fiats are proving very satisfac
tory, very comfortable, and have
plenty of power and speed and they
are not. difficult to keep up. I thank
my stars a dozen times that we were
not in a Ford.
"Walt Gores has designed a coat-of
arms for the unit which has been
painted on the cars, it includes the
American flag, French lias:, lied
Cross, and Section number on a shield
with the American buffalo above the
shield.
"A few weeks after we joined the
division we moved uj) to the spot
where we are now camped. It is
about ten kilometers from the trench,
well in the midst of the big batteries,
but far enough back to be comfort
able. From here, when we are on
duty, we go up to the Poste de Serc
ours and are at duty at these twenty
four hours at a time, changing around
from one to the other as we are
needed and evacuating the wounded
to a big hopital live or six miles back.
The posts are close up to the line, the
nearest being a few hundred yards
from the German first lines, and, of
course, close to the French lines.
"A lot of the boys have been taken
up to the front line and even out to
the 'petite fastes,' so near the
'Bosches' that they weren't allowed to
talk above a whisper.
"Of course at night there is a line
of trattic moving steadily both ways
and although ambulances have the
right of way over everything except
staff cars, there is no such thing as
hurry. Every now and then we
scrape paint off a horse or two, At
all the posts the barrage from French
batteries goes over our heads and it
took some time to get used to it. The
shells leave the gun with a twang like
a banjo string and you can hear them
.sometimes for four or live seconds
whistling like a lariat through the
air. Every now and then the French
battery near the road will let go and
we will jump a foot or two off the
seat.
"Hoi) Donaldson and another fellow I
were at duty at one of the posts, the
other night, when the Germans start
ed a gas shell attack. The posts were
profusely bombarded and they got in
side the 'cave abri.' Big shells lit all
over the courtyard where the cars
were parked and smashed up things
in general. A French ambulance was
blown to pieces more or less, and.
Bob's car was put out of commission,
a gas shell going through the roof
over the seat, smashing the steering
wheel to pieces. A 155 mm. H. E.
shell penetrated the roof of the 'cave
abri' that Bob and the others were
in, and hit the floor near them with
out exploding—probably a defective
shell —which was more or less for
tunate for Bob."
