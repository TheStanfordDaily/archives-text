# VARSITY AND SOLDIERS TO MEET ON TURF
## PLAY AT FORT MASON Game Will Be Event of Field Day for Liberty Loan Campaign 
### 
Fort Mason and the varsity fifteens
will lock liorns at Fort Mason, Thurs
day afternoon, in one of the best
events of the season. The game will
be called at 3 o'clock, and will be the
feature of a field day to be held for
the benefit of the second Liberty Loan
drive.
Graduate Manager Hauser, in ar
ranging this tangle, is confident that
the varsity will have some stiff com
petition and may come out on the
short end of the score. Many inter
national ruggers are playing on and
coaching the Fort Mason team, and
they will be able to give a good ac
count of themselves. Unless the var
sity can get into better shape than
preliminary games have indicated they
will be at a loss.
Coach Wylie will probably use the
same scrum but the backfield is un
certain. VVark at first five and Tem
pleton at full were the only consist
ent players last Saturday. Lilly,
while gaining ground in fair shape,
seemed to be lost on fine points of
the game, while D. Levy, at center
three, did not show up to varsity
form. On the wings there is not so
much uncertainty. None of the men
are going extra well but Weeks is
assured of a position.
The teams will line up as follows:
Varsity—l3etts, Curtice, (Meese,
Righter), front rank; Schwarzenbek,
Flood, (Prior), side rank; Pettingill,
Kegley, Vear rank; Winham, (Chand
ler), wing-forward; Swarts, lock;
Hauser, halfback; Wark, (Beck
strom), first five-eighths; I). Levy,
second five-eighths; Lilly, (Davis),
center three-quarters; Gibbs, Weeks,
wings; Templeton, full.
