# HAIL, STANFORD, HAIL!
## 
### 
One by one traditions of the University seem to be passing by the way
side. Some of them we have commented on already. One, however, which
has been a subject for comment, editorially and otherwise, in the past ten
years, is the question of attendance at University assemblies and the sing
ing of "Hail, Stanford, Hail!" at these gatherings. At the assemblies held
so far this year, speakers have been forced to raise their voices over sev
eral rows of vacant seats before they bring themselves within range of
their hearers. The front rows have always been the seats of honor for the
senior class and the intrusion of the lower classes into this sacred section
has always been frowned upon by those who believe this to be their special
stamping ground. One of two things should be done. Either the seniors
should revive the custom of taking the front seats or they should be thrown
open to the student body at large. It is a distinct discourtesy to the speak
ers who are brought here from the outside to greet them with empty front
rows. „
When freshmen attend the opening assemblies of the year and find
that a great majority of the students either do not know the University
hymn or do not have interest enough to sing it, there is not much incentive
for them to learn it. At last Thursday's assembly a few women's voices
formed the chorus. Again we say, "Let us do it right or not at all."
