# Miss Peck Tells of South America Trip
## Famous Woman Mountain Climber Graphically Describes Ascent of Huscaran 
### 
Mountain climbing appeared in an
unusual light to the audience which
heard Miss Annie S. Peck at the Little
Theater last night. Instead of the un
interesting atmosphere that such i
things often have for us, last night's
lecture took on a character of in
tense interest and enthusiasm.
To Dr. Jordan is due the incentive
which first started Miss Peck on a
career of mountain climbing, when he
suggested the ascent of the Matterhorn
in Switzerland. From climbing Mount
Sifasta in this state, Miss Peck went
to Mexico, and from there to Uolivia.
where Mount Sorata was climbed.
Mount Huascaran, in Peru, was next
called to her attention, and after four
unsuccessful attempts on her first trip
and two on the second, with the as
sistance of two Swiss guides, Miss
Peck finally attained the summit, and
by so doing won the distinction of
having reached the highest point on
the American continent ever achieved
by an American. In honor of the
achievement Miss Peck was presented
witli a gold medal by the Peruvian'
government. The elevation was 21,8112
feet, and attained after ten years of
effort.
The lecture was illustrated by views
taken at all the interesting points at
which Miss Peck has stopped, includ
ing many views of the mountains
which she climbed. The difficulties
and the dangers which were overcome
were remarkable, and can be but
vaguely realized even by those who
heard the lecture
