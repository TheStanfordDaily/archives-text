Mr. Bartholomew, together with Dr.
Palmer, will deliver a series of ad
dresses on that date, in which lie will
graphically picture the work of the Y.

plain what America's part should be
in forwarding this relief. He has
spent an active two years on the east
ern front, and was in Petrograd at
the time of the Russian revolution,
and his description of the work will
be real and vivid in the extreme.
Mr. Bartholomew represents the In
ternational Committee of the Y. M. C.
A., and has been sent out by the gen
eral secretary in the interests of the

various groups, including the "500,"
the faculty, the Encina men, and the
Row men.

raise $35,000,000 for Y. M. C. A. relief
