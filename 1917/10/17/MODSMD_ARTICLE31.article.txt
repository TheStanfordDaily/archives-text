The backfield of the varsity looks to
l)e the weakest part of the team.
First five is fairly well taken care of
by Wark, but the only strong man
compared with Santa Clara is Tem
pleton. Coach Wylie's big job will be
to turn out some real backs. D. Levy,
Lilly, Weeks, and Davis do not seem
varsity material, although hard work
and constant coaching may develop
them into stars.
$*** $ * *
Winham at wing-forward seems to
be a fixture. He is a scoring machine
in himself and a tower of strength on
the defensive. His one weakness
seems to be a tendency not to swerve
in running.
*******
City sport writers who were at tbe
Saturday game with Palo Alto Ath
letic Club were surprised at the lack
of pep siiov, 11 by the bleachers. Santa
Clara seems confident of victory they
say and Stanford is not showing the
spirit which will prove this dope
wrong.
**** * * *
From present indications the fresh
men will have the best team of years.
Doe, Sheldon and Morse are fixtures
that would look good on the present,
varsity. They have a knowledge and
style of Rugby that speaks will for
their high school coachine:.
****** *
Norman Ross, ex-'2O, world's cham
pion swimmer, was in the lineup for
one of the interclub series last night,
at wing. Ross, with a little football
knowledge, would look good on any
team. He is to be drafted however,
and was only on the campus for a
short visit.
*******
Templeton will have to look to his
laurels in the kicking line. Lilly, in
last night's interfraternity game, con
verted two clean goals from difficult
angles, in addition to several kicks to
touch.
