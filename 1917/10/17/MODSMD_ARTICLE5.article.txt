# Glee Club to Hold Second Big Tryout
## 
### 
Thirty candidates for the Stanford
Glee Club were given a thorough try
out last night, and a second division
will be heard this evening at 7:30 in
room 84 of the Inner Quad. Manager
Roxy Davis was well pleased with the
first showing and expects a larger
group to appear at the final tryout
tonight.
So far there has been a noticeable
lack of men who sing second liass and
first tenor and a strong appeal has
been made for students to fill these
parts. A list of the successful candi
dates will be announced Monday.
