# Women to Fill Vacancy in Conference Tomorrow
## 
### 
Women living on the campus but
not affiliated with any organized liv
ing group, will choose a member to
Women's Conference at an election to
be bold tomorrow in the Women's
Host Room. The election is to fill a
vacancy caused by the failure of Miss
Dorothy Mctz, '17, to return to the
campus this year.
