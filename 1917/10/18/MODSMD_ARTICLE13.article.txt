Tomorrow is War Registration Day for the women of the University.
There is a large field open for women in the present war and their work in
Red Cross and other branches of service cannot be too strongly brought
out. There are thousands of American women today in Europe rendering
just such service as will be outlined to the women tomorrow. From the
way the men and alumni of the University have rallied to the call of the
country it is indeed gratifying to see that the women are showing the
same interest in the Great War. We strongly commend them for it.
Last year, when war was declared and the men of the University gave
up their courses for intensive military training, the women endeavored to
find for themselves a place where they could expend their energies in a
similar effort but at the time nothing could be done to satisfy them. We
hope that the attendant disappointment and the long summer vacation
have not so cooled their ardor that they will not respond to this opportun
ity. The need for this sort of work is as pressing now as it was six
months ago. This year, when so many of the men have been called into
service, the f women have met their responsibilities with the spirit of for
mer years, and we are convinced that in this time of their enlistment they
will come through in the same manner.
