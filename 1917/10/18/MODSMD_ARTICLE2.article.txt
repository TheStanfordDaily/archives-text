## Conscription of Labor Used in Making of War Goods Is Debate Topic 
### 
That the Cardinal debaters would
not be short of good talent and speak
ers when they take issue with the Cali
fornia team on November 23, was pre
dicted by the lively interest shown
last night in the tryouts for positions
on the intercollegiate team.
The question for debate in the try
outs was the same as the one for the
big debate: "Resolved, That in War
time. the federal government should
employ Conscription of labor to insure
the necessary output of war materi
als."
At the close of the debate Coach
Karl Leib announced that the squad
from which the final team will be
chosen to be: W. I. Ames, J. G. Dris
coll, A. (J. Westwick, Miss Margaret
Shedd, H. H. Hoss, C. E. Simpson, G.
P. Wood, J. M. Cuddy.
Twelve speakers took part in the
tryouts. The affirmative, in general,
advocated conscription of labor as the
only practicable scheme of supply
ing the shortage of war materials and
argued that the situation could best
be met by the transfer of labor from
the lesser to the more important war
time industries.
The plan of labor conscription, as
outlined, was opposed by the negative
on the ground that there was no great
labor shortage at this time and that
the present methods of the Federal
government could successfully cope
with any possible shortage in the
future.
