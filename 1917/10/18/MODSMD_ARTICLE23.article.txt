The freshmen looked like an all
star team last night, with the stars
so bright they couldn't see the ball.
Doe, Falk and Wallace were the only
men who followed the ball consist
ently, although Reynolds and Parker
were in the game at times. Palo
Alto's scrum pushed the first-year
men about at will and managed to se
cure the ball seven-eighths of the
time. There will be considerable
team play necessary before a victory
over Santa Clara is in sight.

Winham looks better at wing-for
ward every time he gets on the field.
The former breakaway is a master at
dribbling and in addition is fast on
his feet. The varsity scrum with
Winham to back them up will be able
to handle themselves in fine shape.
Swarts is going at top speed while
Captain Pettingill, Schwarzenbek, and
Chandler are always more than de
pendable. The weak place of the var
sity will be in the backfield.

Doe, at half for the freshmen, last
night converted every try made by the
babes and in addition used his feet
to good advantage in kicking to touch.
The little fellow is assured of a place
on the first-year team if he goes at
the speed he is now.
Templeton's foot is better than ever
this season. He is good at kicks to
touch, conversions, and better at field
goals, than any man on the coast.
