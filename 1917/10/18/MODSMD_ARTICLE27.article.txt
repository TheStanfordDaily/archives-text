detailed discussion of the system.
At the meeting last night, it was
explained that this is a year which
will undoubtedly try the best of the
'fraternities, and so strict economy is
necessary. The plan calls for one
man to direct the buying for all of
the houses, thus securing reductions
on large quantities of goods. A sys
tematic method of keeping books for
all of the houses will be adopted and
placed in the hands of one man.
After the system has been in opera
tion for some time, the employes of'
the house will be brought under the
survey of the management.
