# HAUSER BOOSTS A. S. S. U. SALE
## 
### 
Advantages to be derived from Student Body membership were pointed
out by Graduate Manager Hauser at tliis morning's assembly. So far ho
lias been somewhat disappoined in the sale and believes that lho fact that
many have not purchased cards yet is due to the fact that they do not un
derstand what Student Body membership means. The Associated Students
of Stanford University is an organization including all student activities ex
cept those fostered by individual societies, and even in many of these cases
the A. S. S. U. fathers their activities. Athletics, debating, publications and
band are only a few of the activities which are a part of the A. S. S. 11. or
supported by it. Some such organization is absolutely necessary for the
continuation of activities in their various forms. The organization cannot
be maintained without financial support and as these activities are cin
ducted for the students and by the students it is up to them to pay for it.
Aside from being the duty of every student to purchase a two dollar
blue card it is a good investment. It includes a subscription to The Daily
Palo Alto, subscription to which is a dollar and twenty-five cents a quar
ter. It also includes half-price admission to all football games. If a stu
dent attended only live games during the season the saving would be ap
proximately one dollar. Use of the swimming pool, which formerly cost
fifty cents, is now free and limited lo Student Body members. Here is
shown by a conservative estimate a saving of two dollars and seventy-live
cents.
A voice in the conduct of the affairs of the organization which makes
this saving possible is gained by holding a blue card through a vote at stu
dent body elections, the right to participate in athletics, and the right to
hold offices in the A. S. S. U.
By purchasing a Student Body ticket, then, a student fulfills his patri
otic duty, saves at least two dollars and seventy-five cents, and gains his
right to participate in Student Body affairs. If there is a student in the
University who desires to see all activities go out of existence, he can
best realize his desire by failing to purchase his two dollar A. S. S. IT.
ticket from the many solicitors or at the Graduate Manager's office in the
Union.
