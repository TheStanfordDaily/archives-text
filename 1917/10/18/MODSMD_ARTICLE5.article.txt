# BALKAN PEOPLE ARE "FUNNY ONES"
## Taylor and Wohlford Tell of War in Slavic Europe 
### 
From somewhere out in the Balkans
news of the Second Unit of Stanford
Ambulance men came to Stanford
through letters from F. .1. Taylor, '18
and B. C. Wohlford, '18.
"We are having it. a little easier
now," Taylor writes, "the French hav
ing decided that we worked too hard
altogether and having brought an
other section in to do the heavier
work. Henceforth we'll have more
work out toward the front and less of
the grind backwards. All of which
doesn't make us mad at all, for wo
seldom have heavy loads at the front,
and outside of bouncing over rough
roads, enjoy the work a lot more. It
brings us more in touch with the
Frenchmen who are doing the work."
Taylor has been driving a car for
one of the staff officers, but he says:
"During the last week I have been
hauled out for considerable ambulance

work, taking the places of a couple of,
the hoys who were temporarily sick.
It made variety. On duty out towards
the front wasn't bad at all, though 1
had to go over some mountain roads
where Fords were never intended to
navigate. One night they sent me on ;
a trip so bad that the buss wouldn't
pull itself up the hill I had to make.
However, I solved the difficulty by
making the four sick men I was carry
ing get out and push, which didn't
bother them. They weren't very sick.
They were tickled at a chance to get
a little vacation in the hospital.
Everyone here is pretty sick of fight
ing."
Excitement is not lacking in the
Balkans. Taylor describes the feelings
of the Stanford men when the Bosche
avion dropped a bomb over their head
quarters. The aim was poor, however,
and no damage was done outside of
shattering a few windows, and send
ing the terrified natives running into
shelter.
Wohlford views the situation in his
usual satiric way. "We have been
here exactly two weeks," he says,
"which is another way of saying that
we have had squash and beans four
teen times."
"The people here are a bunch of
funny ones whose dress is so ragged
and peculiar that any one of them
would make an instant hit in Ameri
can vaudeville. The garments con
sist of an indefinite number of rags
sewn or tied together and either hung
from the shoulder and belt or wrap
ped around. The legs are wrapped
also with layers of cloth so that I do
not see how them possibly bathe or
struggle out o fthem at night. My
private hunch is that they don't."
Wohlford established a record when
he drove for forty-two consecutive
hours over mountain roads without a
light.
"The supreme test for character,"
says Wohlford, "is to come in after
twenty-four hours of hard work and
come to lunch, only to see some bench
warmer complacently help himself to
all the jam. If you can control your
self then, well—even Kipling couldn't
have a comeback."

ing the terrified natives running into
shelter.
Wohlford views the situation in his
usual satiric way. "We have been
here exactly two weeks," he says,
"which is another way of saying that
we have had squash and beans four
teen times."
"The people here are a bunch of
funny ones whose dress is so ragged
and peculiar that any one of them
would make an instant hit in Ameri
can vaudeville. The garments con
sist of an indefinite number of rags
sewn or tied together and either hung
from the shoulder and belt or wrap
ped around. The legs are wrapped
also with layers of cloth so that I do
not see how them possibly bathe or
struggle out o fthem at night. My
private hunch is that they don't."
Wohlford established a record when
he drove for forty-two consecutive
hours over mountain roads without a
light.
"The supreme test for character,"
says Wohlford, "is to come in after
twenty-four hours of hard work and
come to lunch, only to see some bench
warmer complacently help himself to
all the jam. If you can control your
self then, well—even Kipling couldn't
have a comeback."
From somewhere out in the Balkans
news of the Second Unit of Stanford
Ambulance men came to Stanford
through letters from F. .1. Taylor, '18
and B. C. Wohlford, '18.
"We are having it. a little easier
now," Taylor writes, "the French hav
ing decided that we worked too hard
altogether and having brought an
other section in to do the heavier
work. Henceforth we'll have more
work out toward the front and less of
the grind backwards. All of which
doesn't make us mad at all, for wo
seldom have heavy loads at the front,
and outside of bouncing over rough
roads, enjoy the work a lot more. It
brings us more in touch with the
Frenchmen who are doing the work."
Taylor has been driving a car for
one of the staff officers, but he says:
"During the last week I have been
hauled out for considerable ambulance

work, taking the places of a couple of,
the hoys who were temporarily sick.
It made variety. On duty out towards
the front wasn't bad at all, though 1
had to go over some mountain roads
where Fords were never intended to
navigate. One night they sent me on ;
a trip so bad that the buss wouldn't
pull itself up the hill I had to make.
However, I solved the difficulty by
making the four sick men I was carry
ing get out and push, which didn't
bother them. They weren't very sick.
They were tickled at a chance to get
a little vacation in the hospital.
Everyone here is pretty sick of fight
ing."
Excitement is not lacking in the
Balkans. Taylor describes the feelings
of the Stanford men when the Bosche
avion dropped a bomb over their head
quarters. The aim was poor, however,
and no damage was done outside of
shattering a few windows, and send
ing the terrified natives running into
shelter.
