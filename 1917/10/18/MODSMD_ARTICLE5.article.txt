# BALKAN PEOPLE ARE "FUNNY ONES"
## Taylor and Wohlford Tell of War in Slavic Europe

From somewhere out in the Balkans
news of the Second Unit of Stanford
Ambulance men came to Stanford
through letters from F. .1. Taylor, '18
and B. C. Wohlford, '18.
"We are having it. a little easier
now," Taylor writes, "the French hav
ing decided that we worked too hard
altogether and having brought an
other section in to do the heavier
work. Henceforth we'll have more
work out toward the front and less of
the grind backwards. All of which
doesn't make us mad at all, for wo
seldom have heavy loads at the front,
and outside of bouncing over rough
roads, enjoy the work a lot more. It
brings us more in touch with the
Frenchmen who are doing the work."
Taylor has been driving a car for
one of the staff officers, but he says:
"During the last week I have been
hauled out for considerable ambulance

work, taking the places of a couple of,
the hoys who were temporarily sick.
It made variety. On duty out towards
the front wasn't bad at all, though 1
had to go over some mountain roads
where Fords were never intended to
navigate. One night they sent me on ;
a trip so bad that the buss wouldn't
pull itself up the hill I had to make.
However, I solved the difficulty by
making the four sick men I was carry
ing get out and push, which didn't
bother them. They weren't very sick.
They were tickled at a chance to get
a little vacation in the hospital.
Everyone here is pretty sick of fight
ing."
Excitement is not lacking in the
Balkans. Taylor describes the feelings
of the Stanford men when the Bosche
avion dropped a bomb over their head
quarters. The aim was poor, however,
