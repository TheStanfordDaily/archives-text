# Palo Alto High Is Loser to Freshmen
## 
### 
In a game featured by "Gaston and
Alphonse" tactics, the freshmen were
victors over Palo Alto High School
last night by the score of IS to 3. on
the varsity lot. The first-year men
handled the pigskin like it was a piece
of hot iron. Against a.team which is
noted for its weakness they were un
able to get together at all. The final
count came only after playing that
will put heart into the Santa Clara
ruggers.
Palo Alto scored on a thirty-five
yard run by Klein through the whole
freshman backfield. Conversion
failed. The first-year men counted
next after fifteen minutes ol' ragged
play, Doe to Morse to Falk to Wallace.
Doe converted. Next, Reynolds went
over, after a rush from Doe to Tem
pleton. Doe again converted. Count
at the end of first half, 10 to 3.
In the second half eight more points
were rolled up by the freshmen on
passing rushes. The final score was
18 to 3.
