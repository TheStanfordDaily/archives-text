## 
### 
To Stanford will belong the distinc
tion of being the first university of
the country to institute an organized
campaign for subscriptions to the
Second Liberty Loan, according to
plans of Student Body President I. C.
Heron, '18, who is acting on the sug
gestion of Mr. Burrell G. White of the
Liberty Loan Committee in San Fran
cisco. Mr. White was on the campus
recently and suggested that Stanford
take the initiative in this campaign
among universities of the country.
It will also be the privilege of Stan
ford to communicate this action to all
other universities of the country, and
it is hoped that a widespread Liberty
Loan movement will the result.
To cooperate with Mr. White in or
ganizing this movement, Heron has
appointed W. H. Haines, 'IS, to act as
chairman of a committee to take
charge of the local campaign. Others
named. by Heron on the committee

Nisson, '18, Miss Ellen Calhoun, '20.
Miss Margaret Shedd, '20, and Miss

This committee will meet with Mr.
White tomorrow evening to plan the
details of the campaign. Only a short
time remains in which the bonds may
be subscribed to, but those in charge
of the campaign intend to make a
thorough canvass of the campus.
It is hoped that by organized effort
every student in the University will
be reached in the campaign, and that
a large subscription will be the re
sult. It is also a part of the program
to extend the campaign through the
students to those who are associated
with them in the localities from which
