# Men in Service Will Attend Campus Dance
## 
### 
Stanford's Second Campus Dance, to
be held Saturday evening in the
Women's Club House, promises to be
almost a reception to Stanford men
in service from the large number who
have signified their intention of being
present.
Stanford men who are in the ser
vice of the government in San Fran
cisco will be here in force for the
event. The crowd promises to be
even larger than that which was in
attendance at the first of this series
of dances. These campus informals
have taken a distinct place in the
campus social calendar, having won
favor because of their informality.
