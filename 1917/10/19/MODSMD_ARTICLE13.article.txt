# OLYMPIC CLUB IS VARSITY FOE TOMORROW
## CARROLL WILL PLAY All-Blacks to Contest Oakland High; Babes Have Strong Opposition 
### 
Saturday's afternoon of Rushy will
include the Olympic Club against the
varsity, Alameda High School for the
freshmen and Oakland High School
with the All-Blacks, according to
Graduate Manager Hauser. Twenty
live cents and a student body ticket
or fifty cents for non-student body
members, will admit. Soldiers in uni
form may pass the gate for twenty
live cents. The carnival will com
mence at 1:30, with the freshmen.
The varsity will take the field imme
diately after, followed by the second
varsity.
Club Strong.
From the line-up of the Olympics
tomorrow's varsity game will be the
best yet. Danny Carroll at first five
Hud Larkin at half, Curtin in the front
rank, Fitzpatrick at second five, and
Smith at full, are cracks at the game
and will give thevarsity the hardest
rub they have seen. Incidentally, the
game will give the first opportunity of
seeing Danny Carroll in action on
the Stanford turf since his injury last
year.
After their showing against the fast
Fort Mason fifteen, the varsity will
probably be in shape to defeat the
San Francisco ruggers. The contest
will lie the best outside the big game,
however.
