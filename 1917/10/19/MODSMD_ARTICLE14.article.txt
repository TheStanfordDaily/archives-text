"Art for America'' is the subject
which William Ordway Partridge,
noted sculptor and author, will treat
before his Stanford audience at the
regular Tuesday evening lecture, next
week, in the Little Theater. Mr. Part

busts, reliefs, and decorative and ideal
works have been contributed by Tues
day's speaker. Among these are the
well-known equestian statue of Gen

statue of Shakespeare in Lincoln

St. Peter and Paul- Cathedral at
Washington, 1). C., and the national
Horace Greely statue at Chappaque,
New York. Mr. Partridge studied art
and sculpture at Columbia University,
