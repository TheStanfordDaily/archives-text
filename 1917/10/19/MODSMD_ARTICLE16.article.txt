Another opportunity is open to Stanford men for ambulance service.
The next unit will be composed of both Stanford and California men. The
last corps which was organized at Stanford was sent east during the sum
mer and have since been stationed at Allentown, Pa. As soon as that unit,
which is now composed of ninety men, can be increased to one hundred
and eighty men, it will be sent abroad. That means that about thirty or
forty Stanford men will have the chance to get into this organization, with
the possibility of service in Europe before the first of the year. At all
events, they will very likely be sent east as soon as the unit is mustered
up to its full strength.
Besides this opening the Registrar's office is now handling applications
for enlistment in the aeronautical observation service. Twenty-five men
are wanted from Stanford for this service.
Both these branches seem very popular among Stanford students, and
those in chage of enlistment in these branches believe they will be fillled
up in a very short time. Now that registered students are well started in
the quarter's work we do not believe it proper to urge them to drop every
thing for enlistment, but those who feel it their duty to answer these var
ious calls will receive the God-speed wishes of the entire student body.
The letters received from men already in Europe have been welcomed by
us who are still inactive and we cannot too strongly urge that messages
from home be sent to those abroad at the earliest opportunity. Their fight
is our fight and moral support goes a long way when a fellow is thous
ands of miles from home.
