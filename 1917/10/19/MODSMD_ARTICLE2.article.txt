# Soccer Team Plays Olympics Saturday
## Four Veteraus to Form Nucleus of Eleven in Initial Contest 
### 
In their opening game of tlie sea
sun, Stanford varsity soccer men are
slated to run up against the strong
aggregation of the San Francisco
Olympic Club, at 2 o'clock tomorrow
afternoon. The game will he played
on the local baseball diamond.
With Yewell at center half, Drury
at outside right, and Captain McClung
at left half, as the nucleus of veter
ans, an entirely new team will be
built from the material which has
shown up well in the last two weeks'
practice. It is probable that Coach
Maloney will run in several substi
tutes during the course of the game,
in order to get a line on their ability.
Say, Wing, and Wedell are men of
second varsity experience, while Brill,
Bates, Stamp, and Pillsbury played
with last year's freshman squad, and
will probably be used in the game.
The Olympics are sending down a
strong aggregation, and are fortunate
in securing Connelley, a soccer star
with a reputation, from Camp Fre
mont, to hold down a place in their
team. Tomorrow's game should not
be lacking in thrills for soccer en
thusiasts.
Coach Maloney will announce the
varsity lineup before the game. Sev
eral changes during the contest are
probable.
