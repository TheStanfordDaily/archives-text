Word has also been received that
Tom Hickey, last year's Santa Clara
varsity star, received his sergeant's
stripes recently. Hickey, besides be
ing a speedy Rugby player, also stands
high in the baseball world, having re
ceived several offers to join Connie
Mack's pitching squad. His twirling
ability will be of value in throwing
hand grenades when he gets in on
"big game" next year "somewhere in
France."
