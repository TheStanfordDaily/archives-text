# Cosmopolitan Club Meets Again Monday
## 
### 
Cosmopolitan Club met for the first
time this year, last night, in room 219,
Encina Mall. It was found that only
six members have returned this quar
ter, and that the club is in bad need
of new members. Another meeting
next Monday night is planned for, to
lie held in the Club Room of Encina,
at 8 o'clock, at which Professor Treat
is to speak. The club is for the pur
pose of bringing together foreign stu
dents, making its members familiar
with outside customs, and in general
helping to spread the cosmopolitan
spirit. All those interested in the
movement are invited to attend Mon
day night, and if enough interest, is
shown, the club will be re-organized
and continued through the quarter.
At this meeting officers will be elected
to fill the vacancies of last year.
