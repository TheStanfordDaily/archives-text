# Free Kicks

Danny Carroll will endeavor to show
up the proteges of his old side-kick
in the game, Saturday, when the var
sity and Olympic Club play. Jim
VVylie and Carroll are probably the
greatest exponents of the game in this
country.
Taken as a whole the soldiers were
a fast combination, however. They
fought hard but showed a lack of
practice. A return game on the Stan
ford turf with them would be one to
warm the hearts of the bleacher
warmers.
The Fort Mason forwards were
much faster than their backs. In the
first half they dribbled through the
Cardinal pack for long gains, but were
unable to hold their form in the sec
ond period so well.
