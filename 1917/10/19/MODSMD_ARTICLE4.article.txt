Dear Editor:
We have noticed a great innovation j
in Ihe advertising policy of The Daily !
Palo Alto this quarter, and should
like to call attention to this fact. Re
cent numbers have contained adver
tising matter of a character not conn- j
tenanced by respectable publications I
of other co-educational institutions.
Advertisements of women's under ap
parel have been placed right next to
those for men's drinks, the latter con-1
taining suggestions which should be I
confined strictly to a mother's maga- i
zinc.
We suggest that a new policy be
adopted.
INDIGNANT CO-EDS.
Editor's Note —We do not under
stand why "Indignant Co-Eds" pick on
the editorial department of The Daily
Palo Alto for the conduct of the busi-!
ncss management, but we thank them
for it. It is seldom that, in the ser-!
ious world of journalism, our sensi-1
tive funny bone is so touched as by j
this letter, and when such occasions I
do arise we cannot resist the tempta- j
tion to let the whole campus in on it.!
We believe the viewpoint to be de-!
cidedly ovedrawn and for that rea- i
son we treat it in this light and airy |
manner.
Our communicants take occasion to j
slander us in comparison with other i
similar publications. We would call i
their attention to the fact that other j
magazines and newspapers covering
a far greater field carry this same ad
vertising and guarantee the authen
ticity of its advertisements.
We do not feel absolutely sure from
the text of the letter whether the
complaint is directed against the char
acter of the individual advertisement |
or whether it was their proximity in j
the makeup of the paper that caused ;
the complaint, but whatever the mo- i
tive, we assure "Indignant Co-Eds"
that Ihe only answer we can give them j
is, "If you don't like our ads, don't;
read them. These are Avar times and 1
we need the money."
