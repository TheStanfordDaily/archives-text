# AMBULANCE UNIT ASKS MEN FOR SERVICE
## CHANCE TO SIGN UP Want Thirty Men From Stanford to Enlarge Division to Be Sent Over 
### 
Stanford once again is to have a
chance to respond to the government's
call, and Stanford students who are
not yet in any branch of the service
and who wish to enter it are to be
given another chance to actively par
ticipate in the war. and without the
delay that enlistment and training
camps incur. Word lias been received
by Assistant Registrar .1. E. McDowell
that one of the University of Cali
fornia Ambulance Units, sent from the.
State institution last May and detained
in training at Aleentown, Pa., is in
need of recruits. The unit, which
originally consisted of about ninety
men, must be brought up to a full war
strength of about one hundred and
eighty, so a call has been sent out to
the two California universities to make
up the deficiency.
Thirty or Forty from Stanford.
Thirty or forty men are to be taken
from Stanford, as this institution's
allotment; these will be selected in
the order of their application at the
Registrar's office; all that is required
of them is that they pass the physical
tests for ambulance work, and are
ready to depart immediately; they are
to be sent on to Pennsylvania without
delay, providing the physical tests do
not prove too much for them. No
special unit is to lie formed here, as
the men must be hurried to Allenttown
so as to get a little of the training for
ambulance work before departing for
the war zone. They probably will see
active service before the new year,
and will no doubt be transported to
France within a month or so. All
who wish to take advantage of this
opportunity for getting into tlie world
war are asked to apply at the Regis
trar's office immediately.
Four ambulance units have already
been sent out from Stanford, the first
leaving about a year ago; that the ex
perience of active service is some
thing one will never regret is evinced
by the enthusiasm displayed by all the
Stanford men now in France; every
letter from the war zone describes en
thusiastically the work that the fel
lows do; furthermore, the first unit,
which enlisted for only six months,
has remained, with but one exception,
in the service way past their alloted
time.
As an opportunity for active ser
vice, with the splendid experience it
entails, as well as a chance for active
work under fire in a volunteer organ
ization, enlistment in the ambulance
unit offers exceptional advantages. It
is estimated that, judging by the past
response of Stanford men, the re
quired number will respond before
many days are past, with men on the
waiting list.

to be sent on to Pennsylvania without
delay, providing the physical tests do
not prove too much for them. No
special unit is to lie formed here, as
the men must be hurried to Allenttown
so as to get a little of the training for
ambulance work before departing for
the war zone. They probably will see
active service before the new year,
and will no doubt be transported to
France within a month or so. All
who wish to take advantage of this
opportunity for getting into tlie world
war are asked to apply at the Regis
trar's office immediately.
Four ambulance units have already
been sent out from Stanford, the first
leaving about a year ago; that the ex
perience of active service is some
thing one will never regret is evinced
by the enthusiasm displayed by all the
Stanford men now in France; every
letter from the war zone describes en
thusiastically the work that the fel
lows do; furthermore, the first unit,
which enlisted for only six months,
has remained, with but one exception,
in the service way past their alloted
time.
As an opportunity for active ser
vice, with the splendid experience it
entails, as well as a chance for active
work under fire in a volunteer organ
ization, enlistment in the ambulance
unit offers exceptional advantages. It
is estimated that, judging by the past
response of Stanford men, the re
quired number will respond before
many days are past, with men on the
waiting list.
Stanford once again is to have a
chance to respond to the government's
call, and Stanford students who are
not yet in any branch of the service
and who wish to enter it are to be
given another chance to actively par
ticipate in the war. and without the
delay that enlistment and training
camps incur. Word lias been received
by Assistant Registrar .1. E. McDowell
that one of the University of Cali
fornia Ambulance Units, sent from the.
State institution last May and detained
in training at Aleentown, Pa., is in
need of recruits. The unit, which
originally consisted of about ninety
men, must be brought up to a full war
strength of about one hundred and
eighty, so a call has been sent out to
the two California universities to make
up the deficiency.
Thirty or Forty from Stanford.
Thirty or forty men are to be taken
from Stanford, as this institution's
allotment; these will be selected in
the order of their application at the
Registrar's office; all that is required
of them is that they pass the physical
tests for ambulance work, and are
ready to depart immediately; they are
to be sent on to Pennsylvania without
delay, providing the physical tests do
not prove too much for them. No
