# Fort Mason Ruggers Defeated by Varsity
## Soldiers With Strong Forward Pack Hold Varsity in Check Throughout 
### 
Fort Mason fell before the varsity
in San Francisco yesterday by a score
of 3 to 0 in a very poor exhibition of
Rugby. Constant fumbling by the
backs and a tendency to stand around
and watch the play caused the varsity
low count. A general lack of "jazz"
on the part of the Cardinal ruggers
was noticeable in the contests, which
will prove disastrous unless over
come.
Refereje Faukner, Stanford '10, for
mer varsity man, handled the whistle,
and started things going promptly at
3:30. During the first half the ball
was constantly in the forward pack,
the backs getting the ball only on
kicks. The dribbling rushes of the
soldiers were many and the Stanford
backs were unable to fall on the ball.
On a free kick from the fifty-yard
line Templeton starred by pracing the
ball squarely between the goal posts.
Wark, who was playing a speedy game
at first five, was forced to retire on
account of a badly wrenched arm;
Seely going in at this point. During
the remainder of the first half the ball
was constantly in the soldiers' terri
tory, but the backs were unable to
score, always fumbling the ball. At
the end of the first half, the varsity
led, 3 to 0.
During the second half the ball was
in the forward pack, very seldom get
ting to the backs. Corrilla, the fast
I forward of the soldier pack, received
ja broken wrist and was taken out of
i the game. Templeton saved several
i times with long kicks during this
| period.
