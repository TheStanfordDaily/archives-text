# VARSITY BEATS OLYMPICS IN FAST RUGBY CARNIVAL
## 
### 
Olympic Club fell before the varsity
12 to 3 in the most sensational game
seen this season, Saturday. The Card
inals showed real big game play and
ran the fast San Francisco team off
their feet on the offense and were a
stone wall on the defense when their
goal was threatened. In a prelim
inary contest the freshmen and Oak
land High School tied at 0 to 0 in a
rather slow contest, while the second
varsity was returned victor over Lick
High School, 8 to 0.
The Olympic Club team was one of
the fastest seen here. Carroll, Fitz
patrick, Maloy, Larkiu, Swigart, and
other stars were able to give the var
sity a real battle to test their strength.
The game in the first hall' was fav
orable to neither side in ground gain
ing, but the varsity counted on a sen
sational play when Templeton drop
ped it over from the forty-yard line
with his left foot. The half ended
with neither team scoring again.
With the beginning of the second
period the bleachers began calling for
scores and the varsity returned the
compliment by a try from a long pass
ing rush, Ilauser to Ileron to Lilly,
who went over. Templeton failed to
convert and the score was 7 to 0.
After see-saw play with the ball in
Olympic territory, Barneson picked
the ball out of the ruck and went
through the Olympic backfield for a

score, and Templeton converted, in
the last five minutes of play the
Winged "O" came back strong and
took the ball into varsity territory for
for a try by Maloy from the scrum.
Conversion failed. Score 12 to 3.
Hauser and Templeton starred re
peatedly in the first half. Templeton
saved a score for the San Francisco
team when he stopped two men alone,
tripping one and tackling the other.
Hauser was not far behind with his
short kicks to touch near the goal
line. Taken as a whole the varsity
showed football of the best order and
brought a broad smile on the face of
Coach Jim Wylie.
Oakland High School was too strong
on the defensive for the freshmen in
the opener and while the first-year
menmen threatened often they lacked
the punch to put it over. Play was
in Oakland territory most of the time.
The second varsity were in good
form against Lick and had no trouble
in an 8 to 0 win.
Alameda High School failed to ap
pear and Lick was late, necessitating
the playing of Oakland against the
freshmen. The games did not got
under way until 3 o'clock.

Olympic Club fell before the varsity
12 to 3 in the most sensational game
seen this season, Saturday. The Card
inals showed real big game play and
ran the fast San Francisco team off
their feet on the offense and were a
stone wall on the defense when their
goal was threatened. In a prelim
inary contest the freshmen and Oak
land High School tied at 0 to 0 in a
rather slow contest, while the second
varsity was returned victor over Lick
High School, 8 to 0.
The Olympic Club team was one of
the fastest seen here. Carroll, Fitz
patrick, Maloy, Larkiu, Swigart, and
other stars were able to give the var
sity a real battle to test their strength.
The game in the first hall' was fav
orable to neither side in ground gain
ing, but the varsity counted on a sen
sational play when Templeton drop
ped it over from the forty-yard line
with his left foot. The half ended
with neither team scoring again.
With the beginning of the second
period the bleachers began calling for
scores and the varsity returned the
compliment by a try from a long pass
ing rush, Ilauser to Ileron to Lilly,
who went over. Templeton failed to
convert and the score was 7 to 0.
After see-saw play with the ball in
Olympic territory, Barneson picked
the ball out of the ruck and went
through the Olympic backfield for a

score, and Templeton converted, in
the last five minutes of play the
Winged "O" came back strong and
took the ball into varsity territory for
for a try by Maloy from the scrum.
Conversion failed. Score 12 to 3.
Hauser and Templeton starred re
peatedly in the first half. Templeton
saved a score for the San Francisco
team when he stopped two men alone,
tripping one and tackling the other.
Hauser was not far behind with his
short kicks to touch near the goal
line. Taken as a whole the varsity
showed football of the best order and
brought a broad smile on the face of
Coach Jim Wylie.
Oakland High School was too strong
on the defensive for the freshmen in
the opener and while the first-year
menmen threatened often they lacked
the punch to put it over. Play was
in Oakland territory most of the time.
The second varsity were in good
form against Lick and had no trouble
in an 8 to 0 win.
Alameda High School failed to ap
pear and Lick was late, necessitating
the playing of Oakland against the
freshmen. The games did not got
under way until 3 o'clock.

Hauser and Templeton starred re
peatedly in the first half. Templeton
saved a score for the San Francisco
team when he stopped two men alone,
tripping one and tackling the other.
Hauser was not far behind with his
short kicks to touch near the goal
line. Taken as a whole the varsity
showed football of the best order and
brought a broad smile on the face of
Coach Jim Wylie.
Oakland High School was too strong
on the defensive for the freshmen in
the opener and while the first-year

in Oakland territory most of the time.
The second varsity were in good
form against Lick and had no trouble
in an 8 to 0 win.
Alameda High School failed to ap
pear and Lick was late, necessitating
the playing of Oakland against the
freshmen. The games did not got

Olympic Club fell before the varsity
12 to 3 in the most sensational game
seen this season, Saturday. The Card
inals showed real big game play and
ran the fast San Francisco team off
their feet on the offense and were a
stone wall on the defense when their
goal was threatened. In a prelim
inary contest the freshmen and Oak
land High School tied at 0 to 0 in a
rather slow contest, while the second
varsity was returned victor over Lick
High School, 8 to 0.
The Olympic Club team was one of
the fastest seen here. Carroll, Fitz
patrick, Maloy, Larkiu, Swigart, and
other stars were able to give the var
sity a real battle to test their strength.
The game in the first hall' was fav
orable to neither side in ground gain
ing, but the varsity counted on a sen
sational play when Templeton drop
ped it over from the forty-yard line
with his left foot. The half ended
with neither team scoring again.
With the beginning of the second
period the bleachers began calling for
scores and the varsity returned the
compliment by a try from a long pass
ing rush, Ilauser to Ileron to Lilly,
who went over. Templeton failed to
convert and the score was 7 to 0.
After see-saw play with the ball in
Olympic territory, Barneson picked
the ball out of the ruck and went
through the Olympic backfield for a

score, and Templeton converted, in
the last five minutes of play the
Winged "O" came back strong and
took the ball into varsity territory for
for a try by Maloy from the scrum.
