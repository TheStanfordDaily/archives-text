# Cross Country Race Is On November 10
## 
### 
On November 10 the annual cross
country run between Stanford and
California will be staged in the hills
back of Berkeley. Stanford, under
Captain J. D. McPherson, will enter
about six men in the contest, and from
present indications the Cardinal will
line up with a better team than last
year. Sixteen men are reporting for
practice regularly.
Captain McPherson will go to Berk
eley a week before the race to help
determine the course of the run. Ac
cording to advance reports the race
will be about four and a half miles in
length.
The five men who will undoubtedly
make the trip are Captain McPherson,
'18, C. S. Teitsworth, '19, A. G. West
wick. '19, F Colglazier, '20, and M. F.
Samis, '20. Another man will be
chosen for the sixth member of the
team.
An interclass cross-country run will
be held on November 3. All men who
have not won their numerals in cross
country will be given handicaps in
order to make the competition even.
