# MORE OF RUGBY
## 
### 
The four hundred fans who witnessed the three games last Saturday
were treated to one of the finest bits of Rugby seen on the Stanford field in
early season games in a good many years, considering that these are wm
times. It may not have been the most scientific exhibition possible, but
when teams put up the fight shown Saturday we hand it to them.
Of the four hundred present but little more than half were students.
That means that about one-seventh of the student body were at the games.
The teams deserve better support than that. The attendance is picking
up steadily but there is still room for a lot of improvement.
The financial questions is one of the biggest phases of the Rugby sea
son. Arrangements are practically cenue from Friday night's dance will be
which will be held on Friday night. If we are to go through the season and
put a team on the field on November 24 we must see to it that they are
outfitted in the proper manner. Reveue from Friday night's dance will be
used for this purpose. The team needs the support of the entire student
body both at games and at benefits. ,
