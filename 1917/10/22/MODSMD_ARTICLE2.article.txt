# Frosh Defeat Lick in Water Carnival
## 1921 Shows Speed in Initial Appearance; Relay Event a Thriller 
### 
Keen competition and unexpected
results marked the Freshman-Lick
swimming tourney, held Saturday
morning in Encina tank, in which the
babes, with 36 points, were victors by
a margin of four over their old rivals.
Darling and Dickey starred for the.
1921 aggregation, while Tait and Mit
chell carried off honors for the op
ponents. Each event was fought to a
finish, the outcome of the meet being
always in doubt. So close was the
relay, the deciding event, that the
winner was uncertain to the judges,
and consequently another trial was
necessary. The second trial was
speedier than the first but the winner
was evident, for Darling was nearly
half a length ahead at the finish.
Stanford was minus the services of
Piatt and Holt, whose presence in the
next tournament ought to benefit the
team greatly.
Coach Brandsten wants more ma
terial for the freshman team because
he is taxing the present team too
hard, due to the lack of men.
