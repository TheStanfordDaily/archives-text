# Music Club Expects Talent at Tryout
## 
### 
Much new talent is expected to be
uncovered at the tryouts of the Stan
ford Music Club, Wednesday night, to
be held in Mr. Eaton's office, Room
84, at 7:30 o'clock. All those inter
ested are asked to be present, for,
with but eight of its old members
back, the club is in need of singers,
pianists, cellists, and violinists, espec
ially. President 1). E. Shepardson
hopes that as many will try out as
possible at this time. Last year the
club had fifteen members, but is now
cut down to half that number. Those
who are back are Shepardson, '17,
president; T. Buffum, '18, vice-presi
dent: David Elliott, '18, secretary;
Roy Gangestad, '18, treasurer; Noel
Stearn, '18, Isabel Young, '18, C. Mc-
Cormack, '18, and Katherine Hunting
ton, '10. The club membership is lim
ited to twenty, and it is hoped to bring
it as near that figure as possible at
the tryouts Wednesday night.
Concerts will be given every two
weeks, and a public recital each se
mester.
