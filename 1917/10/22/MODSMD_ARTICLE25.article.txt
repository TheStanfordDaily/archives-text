Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The Stanford men who have left
the Quad for the service have shown
that they know the country is at war.
But the Stanford that is left hasn't
showed signs of anything of the kind.
Now there is the bonfire. This year
we haven't the right to burn good fuel
just for the sake of keeping up ap
pearances for the benefit of the Santa
Clara student body. And that is what
we will be doing if we have the bon
fire. There was a shortage of wood
last winter and there will be again
this year. It isn't going to help the
name of Stanford if we show that we
either don't know that or don't care.
For some time the bonfire has been
no more than a form. Why should we
go on and have ,a poor bonfire, a poor
rally, and a poor showing on the
bleachers on the 24th of November'!
By cutting out the bonfire (which last
year cost the freshmen $125), the first
year men could turn the same organ
ization into doing the work on the
j bleacher stunts which are usually
turned over to a committee of "repre
sentative'' (and therefore overworked)
upperclassmen. We could judge the
[ quality of the class of 1921 by their
j showing in working up bleacher
stunts instead of their ability to beg,
| borrow, or otherwise acquire wood. It
] would leave them with some energy
on the night of the rally that they
| wouldn't have after guarding the bon
! fire all night in the late-November
I rain, and it is the freshmen who will
[make this year's rally alive or dead.
| And it wouldn't be a bad plan for
| them to spend the afternoons that
J they would be hunting wood for the
j fire to turn out lor football practice
and learn a thing or two about the
I team. Some good backing from the
bleachers every night for two weeks
| before the game will put more heart
(into the team than the sight of
j straggling serpentine around a fire
that everyone is principally interested
lin to compare it with former effects.
If we have a lire this year it will be
showing that we <are more for what
Santa Clara undergraduates think
I about our "pep" than for showing av
| erage intelligence in regard to the
| fact that tiie United States is involved
' in a war in which waste is as much
an enemy as the Prussian.
