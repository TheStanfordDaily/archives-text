## Robinson and West Write on President Wilson's Foreign Policy 
### 
"The Foreign Policy of Woodrow
Wilson, 1913-1917," is the title of a
book written by two members of the
Stanford faculty, which will no doubt
attract much attention because of its
timeliness, among other things. It is
by Edgar E. Robinson, assistant pro
fessor of American History, and Vic
tor J. West, assistant professor of
Political Science.
The book is expected to come from
the press of MacMillan within the next
two weeks.
By narration and exposition the
authors have set forth the gradual
development of the policy of the
American administration from the re
! t'usal of President Wilson to recog
nize Victoriuno Huerta as president
of Mexico to bis refusal to enter into
negotiations with the present German
imperial government.
The book includes a carefully se
lected chronology of important events
in American foreign relations during
the period covered, and extracts from
many of the important utterances of
the president and his secretaries in
carrying forward the policy of the
administration.
Professors Robinson and West have
written with the thought in mind that
| a more precise knowledge of princi
"ples underlying the policy of Wilson
and of the nature of his activities in
establishing new standards of inter
national conduct will furnish a sound
basis for understanding the war aims
ol' the United States as enunciated by
the present leader of the American
people.
