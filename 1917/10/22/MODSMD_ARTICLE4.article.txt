"Varsity Girls and Varsity Dancers"
mysteriously hint members of the com
mittees that are making arrangements
for the annual Football Dance to be
held this Friday night, in answer to
demands for "dope." What this
means, attendance at the Alpha Tau ;
Omega bouse, Friday evening, alone!
can tell. Rumor has it that the old !
days of the Senior carnival, when un- j
escorted varsity girls attended dances j
for the benefit of partnerless men, are j
to be revived.
Aside from this, members of the
committee promise other big doings.
A fee of five cents per dance is to be
charged, and so the more terpsichor
ean artists there are, the more will
the football fund swell. .Jack Keg
ley's Jazz orchestra is to dispense the j
harmony. However, there will be i
others present to take turns in hand- I
ling the instruments. A large attend-j
ance is vitally necessary to insure the
success of the dance.
A woman's committee has been ap
pointed to assist the men in handling
the dance and to aid in the develop
ment of ideas. The two committees
follow:
Women's Committee —Dob Shelton,
'18, Geraldine Cluff, '18, Doris Sey
mour. MS, and Constance Chandler,
'18.
Men's Committee —C. R. Swarts, '18,
H. P. Mauser, '18, O. M. Sullivan, '19,
and W. D. Smalley, '18.
