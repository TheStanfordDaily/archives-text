### 
A minimum of $6000 was the goal set
by the executive committee of the
local Y. M. C. A. as Stanford's part
in the nation-wide campaign for war
relief. Those in charge of the work
here are confident that this goal will
be readied without difficulty.
The colleges of the state of Cali
fornia have been apportioned $.">0,000
as their share of the $35,000,000 which
will be raised in the United States
for the purpose of carrying on the Y.
M. C. A.'s work of mercy. The money
is to be used in the prison camps of
the Allies, in Italy, France, and Rus
sia. as well as in the armies of the
United States. Reports from several
men active in the work at the sceno
of battle, show that the money is
badly needed, and President Wilbur
has strongly endorsed the national
campaign.
Organization in the local associa
tions is well under way. An execu
tive committee composed of officers of
the Young Men's and Young Women's
Christian Associations, and a Faculty
Committee with Professor R E. Swain
of the Chemistry department in
charge, arc already actively at work.
In addition, a general committee of
some 100 men and nearly as many
women will be organized. November
