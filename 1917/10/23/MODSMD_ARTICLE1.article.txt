# MORE ACTIVITIES ADVOCATED BY DR. WILBUR
## "HOOVERIZE" TIME Says University Academic Life Will Not Alone Develop "Stanford Man" 
### 
Get into enough college activity to
keep you busy every day of the week
except Sunday, and then "Hooverize"
your time, is the advice that President
Wilbur would have every man and
woman in college, and especially new
students, take very deeply to heart.
There is an ideal of citizenship in
university life that is every bit as
important and no less rich in oppor
tunity than the full citizenship in life
alter college, according to views ex
pressed by Dr. Wilbur, yesterday, af
ter returning from a week-end of talks
given in the bay region, in connection
with his position as chairman of the
Food Conservation Committee, under
Food Administrator H. C. Hoover.
The academic side of university life
is not at all calculated to occupy the
full amount of a man's ability, or at
least is not designed to over-load the
capacity of what has come to be
known in the nation as the "Stanforl
type of man."
"There truly has come to be a
'Stanford type of man,'" says Dr.
Wilbur. "Hoover, as an example, is
a man whose time is worth a fortune
to himself, financially considered, and
yet for his ideals he has unselfishly
given til) fill idea of gain. First in
Belgium, and now in America, he ex-
emplifies what may be done with time,
if it is properly conserved and di
rected. People throughout the nation
know that such qualities of action as
these which are seen in Hoover and
other Stanford men who are giving
their best to the country, are only in
stilled by the sort of training received
before; that their life today is a con
tinuation of life as they learned it to
be most effective in results, while
preparing themselves for work after
college."
"Today we have a situation in the
University wherein a great many of
the older students who had grasped
this bigger idea have gone into the ser
vice of the nation. On the other hand,
there is a larger proportionate num
ber of new people, including both
freshmen and transfers from other in
stitutions. These new people do not
easily take up a co-ordination of
scholastic work and outside activity
which, though it may push them for
time keeps them busy in a healthy
way.
"There are many men in everyday
life who spent all their time and abil
ity in feeding themselves and their
families. Then there are others who
not only care for these duties, but
also find the time, through concentra
tion and application, to realize a
broad conception of citizenship, in
public service. It is through the lat
ter type of man that we have been
known in the past, and that is the type
which we must now make even greater
efforts to develop. The freshman
should be encouraged to take a broad
view of life in college, and through its
opportunities develop that initiative,
that sense of responsibility, and that
ability to step into places bigger than
they thought they could fill, which
are marks of the Stanford men serv
ing best today.
"A good hard-working mixture of
college work and college activity is
the best combination to build up the
type of men that we will be proud to
claim as the 'Stanford type of man,'
for he can be counted on to be a good
citizen in the fullest sense of that
word, after he leaves the University."
"We don't want to keep the type of
man who can only 'feed his family';
who has time only for a narrow aca
demic existence," concluded Dr. Wil
bur. as he emphasized the fact that
Stanford students are to be held more
rigidly than ever to the ideal of the
type the nation expects from this in
stitution.
Along with this, the President urged
the great value of physical betterment
through participation in sports, quot
ing the proportion of men physically
unfit for army service in some east
ern universities as between sixty and
seventy per cent of enrollment. Facts
like this are distasteful to Americans,
and yet true.
Dr. Wilbur urges as a matter of
efficiency, based on experience, that
students cultivate the attitude of
throwing their entire might into work
when it is being done, finish it with
no waste of time, and reserve Sunday
of each week as a day to be free from
all worries of academic or outside ac
tivity. Dr. Wilbur used such a system
throughout his own college life here
at Stanford, and in a large measure in
his greater duties since, and ascribes
his success to that fact. He points
to President Wilson as an example
of such application. President Wil
son insists upon his Sundays, except
in matters of grave national import,
atid has gained in health during the
past few years.
This pace that is expected from the
new classes is fast. They are ex
pected to aid in the college activities
which are now handicapped through
losses of old men, and yet maintain
the high standard required in aca
demic work. It is their duty, and if
they are potential "Stanfodr men" it is
the natural thing for them to do, and
do well. If they cannot stand the
pace, they are not encouraged to re
main. President Wilbur is a man of
high ideals, and also of practical ap
plication, and he is watching the cal
iber of the new men coming into the
University with a jealous eye to the
Stanford reputation.
