# THE
						BONFIRE?
## 
### 
We published in our last issue a communication relative to the fresh
man bonfire. It is a question which certainly deserves serious considera
tion, Many families in this community as well as living groups are find
ing that the question of fuel is already one of importance for the coming
winter. They hate to see the amount of material used in former freshman
bonfires sent up in smoke. For this position they can hardly be blamed.
On the other hand, we must consider the proposition that it is not an easy
matter for us to give up, without a struggle, the football rally before the
Santa Clara contest, an important feature of which has always been the
bonfire.
If the bonfire is to be given up wwant to see some other rally feature
adopted which will keep up the enthusiasm in the Big Game. To allow
the bonfire to pass out of existence now, leaving the rally flat so far as
one big feature is concerned, is to take a step which will be disadvantage
ous not merely to this year's game but will be hard to revive in the future.
Whatever action is taken on this matter should be taken quickly but de
liberately.
We suggest that if action favorable to a continuation of the bonfire is
taken, a limit be placed on the financial expenditure and a time limit be
placed on it so that the freshmen will not give up so much time on it as
to cause any of them to drop by the wayside scholaistically. If the action
taken is unfavorable we urge that at the same time some fitting substitute
to which no objection can be raised, be adopted.
