# Freshmen Jolly-Up Slated November 9
## 
### 
Freshman Jolly-up will be held at
Encina, Friday, November the ninth,
at 8 o'clock. General admission will
be fifty cents.
The Frosh committee has boasted
that this year's jolly-up will outclass
all former "get acquainted" parties,
and to carry out their boasts have se
cured the best musical talent on the
campus for dancing, novel eats, and a
high class program of stunts.
In conformance with Stanford cus
tom the affair will be informal, any
thing from semester shirts to mili
tary brogans being acceptable. A
platoon of the babes will be dele
gated by the committee to smear any
sophomores or upperclassmen who at
tempt to intrude.
