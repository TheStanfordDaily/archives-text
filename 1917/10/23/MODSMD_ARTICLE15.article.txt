# Ram's Head to Start Year With Banquet
## 
### 
Ram's Head will hold their initial
meeting of the year Wednesday eve
ning and celebrate the occasion by a
banquet at the Union. Five members
of the Campus Musical and Dramatic
Society have returned to college and
all amusement followers will be keen
ly interested in the new plays which
will be brought up after the "big
feed" and the usual business meeting.
The five older members who have re
turned and put some of the "old
punch" into the society are C. S. Keg
ley, '18, L. H. Davis, '18, W. E. Antrim,
'If), R. G. Wheal ton, '19, and S. E.
Briggs, '19. With such clever and tal
ented men behind Ram's Head the
year should be a success.
