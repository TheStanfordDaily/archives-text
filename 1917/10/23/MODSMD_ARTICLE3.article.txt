# Two Graves But One Coffin in Bawl-Out
## Occupations, Democracy, Auto Run Mad Riot In New Year Book 
### 
I With the proofs of the "Bawl Out"
! flaunted to the world from in front
of the Registrar's oHice, Stanford can
no longer hide the facts of the great
conglomeration of names and titles
attached to its seekers after knowl
edge. Occupations, machines, ani
mals, plants, countries and a heter
ogeneous collection of inanimate ob
jects greet each other on the Quad
and think nothing of it. However, the
! "Bawl Out" today made public the I
facts as they are; most striking among!
these is tbe democratic representation |
of occupations. There are two Cooks, j
two Gardners, seven Wrights, four
Taylors, three Weavers, twelve Mill
ers, one Piper, one Plummer, one Sea- |
man, one Draper, one Abbott, onej
J Mason, but only one Brewer, due prob
ably to the prohibition scare.
Democracy isn't alone in its repre
sentation, for there are five Kings,
two of the Gentry and one Noble.
Most strange of all, probably, is the
finding of two Graves but only one
Coffin; one of the Parsons might be
| Able to explain this. Tbere is but one
Byrd, and only one Wing, although,
strange to say, of many species, for
there are four Crows, #two Dickeys,
one Crane, one Parrott, one Peacock,
one Reed, two Robbins and a Henn.
They had best be wary for there are
three Hunters en the campus. Presi
dent Wilbur's disapproval seems to
have restricted automobiles, as there
are but five Chandlers, four Whites,
two Haines, two Stevens (one a
Duryea"), one Page, one Franklin, one
Pierce, and one lonely Ford. There
is a Cloud which precedes a Hayes,
and hangs over the Ground to the Lee
(Of Heath, Dale and Hill. A stranger
must imagine Stanford students to be
[a queer race, for there is only one
Hand and one Hart in the list.
The race of mailies finds the Millers
most numerous with twelve represent
atives; the Davis clan is second, with
eleven. Encina is popular for there
are nine Halls listed; Browns, Jones,
j Smiths, and other strong contenders
,in past years have been badly out-
I classed this year in the number of
their representatives.
Among unclassified objects one finds
two Cards, a Hell a Buckle, a Comb,
j three Bills, a Cross, a Park, a Peck :
j and even a Gillet. There is one Mail, [
la Noyes, and a Single Shedd. A Sam-1
pie Sale is listed, at three different j
j Prices. Redwine is the only Joy on I
j the campus, despite the fact, that there j
are three Wells. There are four
Lyons, one Small and two Young, and |
one Younger.
