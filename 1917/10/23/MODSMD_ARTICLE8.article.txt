# UNION SMOKER TO BE PEP FESTIVAL
## 
### 
Somebody is going to step on the
pepper box tomorrow night and nn
spill its contents. That is the very
least of the promises made by those
in charge of the Union smoker. How
ever. there will be other things in
store for the large crowd that is
expected at the Union aside from the
merely Incidental overturning of the
jazz container. Professor "Daldy"
Marx is "not to talk." as he says, hut
to "deliver a few remarks," and
everybody knows how welcome the
professor's remarks always are. Of
more serious interest will be Profes
sor K. C. Franklin's liquid air demon
strations. This is one of the Chem
istry professor's specialties, and, as
such, promises much.
Little need be said about Jack Keg
ley, '18, Roxy Davis, '18, and Joe
Sylva, '18, as dispensers of music, ex
cept for the bare statement that they
will bo there to vie with each other.
Boxing and wrestling matches are be
ing arranged for, and an excellent
pugilistic card will probably be billed.
