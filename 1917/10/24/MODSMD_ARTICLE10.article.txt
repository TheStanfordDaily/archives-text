# 1920 to Reconsider Taboo on Full Dress
## 
### 
Due to the general dissatisfaction
around the campus of having the
Sophomore Cotillion an informal affair
instead of the customary formal, a
special meeting of the 1920 class has
been called by President C. R. Tauzer
for 1 p.m. tomorrow, to reconsider the
question. At the last meeting of the
class, it was decided to have the
Cotillion informal, but since that
time members of the class and others
around the campus have experienced
a decided reversal of opinion.
When the matter conies up for dis
cussion tomorrow advocates of both
types of dance warn their opponents
that the matter will have to be thor
oughly threshed out in the open class
meeting. For this purpose Tauzer
urges all to attend the meeting and
express their opinions.
ports from the various commit
tees are expected tomorrow. The an
nouncement from the Jolly-up com
mittee will be to the effect that, the
Jolly-up is to be held in the Encina
Club Room the evening of November
2. All the women on the campus are
invited, but only the Sojdiomore men
will be fdmitted. The customary fee
of fifty cents is to he charged. Mc-
Namee's jazz orchestra will supply the
music.
