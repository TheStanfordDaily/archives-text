Music, speeches, a liquid.-air demon
stration, boxing, wrestling, smokes
and eats summarize what is to take
place at the Union tonight. The
Union Smoker, which is fast becoming
one of the big events of each term,
promises to live up to the reputation
gained last semester and possibly will
surpass the former event. Remarks
by Professor "Daddy" Marx, the fam
ous liquid-air demonstration by Pro
fessor E. C. Franklin, music by Joe
Sylva, Jack Keglcy, and Roxy Davis,
boxing and wrestling, are the main
features. A large crowd is expected
to be on hand to enjoy the program,
smokes, and food.
