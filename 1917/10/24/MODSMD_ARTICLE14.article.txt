# Captain Roney Back to Lead Soccer Men
## Varsity to Clash With Olympic Club Team Afternoon 
### 
With Captain Itboney back on the
job, varsity soccer men will mix in
their first game of the season with the
speedy Olympic Club aggregation next
Saturday. Rooney's return to the
campus brightens the outlook of the
soccerites materially, increasing the
number of veterans in the field to
four.
Under the leadership of temporary
captain McClung, the squad has gotten
well under way, and regular practices
have been held for nearly three
weeks. Saturday's contest will be the
first opportunity for campus soccer
enthusiasts to view their hopefuls in
action, and although the Winged O is
sending down a strong team, the game
will not be without thrills.
An appeal is made by Captain
Rooney for freshman soccer candi
dates. A game with the California
freshmen is in line, but enough 1921
material has not yet signed up to
make a full team. Regular practices
are held on the varsity baseball lot
on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thurs
days, at 5 o'clock, and all freshmen
desiring to try out for the yearling
aggregation are urged to report.
