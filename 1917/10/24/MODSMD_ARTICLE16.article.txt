# DRESS SUITS OR NOTHING
## 
### 
Announcement has been made that the Sophomore Cotillion will be an
informal dance this year. This is a sad blow to many of the campus
queeners who have looked forward eagerly to this event as one of the
supreme opportunities of the year to pull out the dress suit and get
dressed for a change.
Looking at it purely as a social function, we believe it is a big mis
take. The Sophomore Cotillion is one of the big dances of the year at
Stanford. It holds its place with the Junior Prom and the Senior Ball as
one of the three most important dances on the social calendar. The campus
is not lacking in campus dances, jolly-ups and private dances by individual
organizations. We do not discredit these functions in the slightest, but be
lieve there are enough of them. To bring the Sopohomore Cotillion down
on a common plane with other "campus dances" is to destroy its signif
icance. Making it an informal dance cannot fail to bring about that effect.
We believe in Ilooverizing and all that, but it strikes us that this is
going a bit too far. .Just how economy is to be effected by wearing the
best suit instead of full dress to a dance, substantially the same in other
respects, we do not foresee. Of course some unfortunates are forced to rent
dress suits, but we venture to say that not a man who goes to the Sopho
more Cotillion as a formal affair will spend more money for outfitting him
self than he will before he arrays himself in silk shirt, new tie, and other
essential ingredients for the informal dance. How about it, Sophomores?
Your partners will be there in the best they can afford. Why don't you
reciprocate and give them a time?
