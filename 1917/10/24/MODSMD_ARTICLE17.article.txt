# Great Demand for Athletic Directors
## 
### 
Demand for teachers of physical
training this year is so great that
many schools have not been able to
get the help wanted, according to in
formation obtained at the office of
Mrs. E. B. Snell, Stanford appoint
ment, secretary. Especially insistent
has been the call for men to teach
athletics, military drill and manual
training.
The unusual situation is the result,
in part, of the enactment of a law by
the last legislature of California re
quiring physical training in the high
schools. It appears also that the war
has increased the interest in military
drill and athletics. In many cases
the persons recommended were not
the best fitted for such work, but they
were the only ones available. Partic
ularly strong was the demand for men
who could assist in coaching athletic
teams.
In some instances when men con Id
not be obtained, the schools took
women.
A large number of men who have
been available have entered the army.
Only recently six Stanford men equip- j
ped for work as physical directors i
went into government service shortly i
after being recommended.
Calls have come to Mrs. Snell from
cities in all parts of this state, in- j
eluding San Jose, Merced, and Stock
ton, and letters were received also
from Tacoma, Wash., and as far east
as Miles City, Mont.» The salaries of
fered range from $1000 to $1800 a
year.
All Stanford graduates who were
recommended have not notified Mrs.
Snell whether they got positions or
not, but among those placed lasi May
are:
Harry Ashford, '17, Lemoore Union
High School, Lemoore, Cal.; Fred
Ellsaesscr, '12, Angels Camp, Cal.; J.
H. Ogle, '14, Lodi Union High School,
Lodi, Cal.; Miss Mary Card, '15, Sal
inas Union High School; Miss Etta
Paris, physical training, Fresno;
Miss irma Rayburn, '16, physical
