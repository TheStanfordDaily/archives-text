# Present Day Marks Great Epoch in Art
## Character Portrayal Will Be American Mission Says Partridge 
### 
"I believe that the world today
stands on the threshold of the great
est epoch in art ever known to man,
and in this epoch America should
take the leading part. We are the
heirs of all the ages." In these words
William Ordway Partridge, noted
sculptor and writer on tlie subject of
sculpture, expressed his view of the
present art situation, in his lecture,
"Art for America,"delivered at the
Little Theater last night.
Art, thinks Mr. Partridge, cannot
flourish in any nation which does not
provide the proper conditions for its
development. These include tranquil
ity, happiness, emotional and intellec
tual activity ,and a certain degree of
prosperity. Nations which do not pos
sess complete freedom of expression
are not able to attain the highest
artistic development.
The speaker accepted Hacon's defini
tion of art as "Man added to nature."
Imitative realism always means the
decadence of true artistic sense. "If
realism was art, the maker of plaster
casts would be the greatest artist."
The Assyrians, the Persians and the
Egyptians were not able to produce
great works of art because they were
fettered by their autocratic priesthood
and rulers. The Greeks, on the other
hand, achieved perfection because
they attained complete freedom. Art
declined during the Romani period and
the middle ages, only to be resurrect
ed by the Rennaissance. After an
other decline, the modern school of
art, in which France has taken the
leading part, came into existence.
America has, so far, produced an ex
cellent school of painting, but has
done little in sculpture. When we
realize that it is good political econ
omy to foster art, says Mr. Partridge,
the government will control it, as the
French government now does.
The chief mission of American art
will be to portray character, and de
lineate life as shown in the human
form. Perfection in technique lias al
ready been reached. The universities
are the natural fostering-places of all
arts, and Mr. Partridge expressed the
hope that Stanford would lie among
the first to provide complete equip
ment for this noble work.
