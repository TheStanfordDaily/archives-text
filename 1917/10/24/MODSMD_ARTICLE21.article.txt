Editor Daily Palo Alto:
It is now more or less generally
recognized that in onr first fervor of
enthusiasm and patriotism we have
not always kept our sense of balance
in regard to what was a real aid to
the prosecution of the war and what
•was not.
As we look back to those days last
spring when the whole University was
seeking for a chance to do something,
anything, to express the wish to
serve, and think of those rumors
about some of the sororities growing
beans on vacant ground in order to
bring down the high cost of living,
and as we look at some of the sad
remnants of potato patches which are
the result of the efforts of various
well-meaning members of the com
munity, we wonder if after all, a few
intelligent Portuguese or Italians who
know something about gardening,
would not produce about the same net
result as even the most enthusiastic
of the co-eds could accomplish in
much greater numbers and at the cost
of many blistered hands.
Is not all this outcry ii) regard to
the lamentable waste of the freshman
bonfire another example of misdirect
ed energy? The accusations seem to
amount to this: That the expense has
been too heavy, that there has been a
waste of fuel, that the bonfire is
nothing more than a hollow mockery
as far as real spirit is concerned, and
that the freshmen should not be de
prived of their sleep. As to the ex
pense, if the bonfire is abandoned will
there be any useful direction of the
same amount of money?
The substitute selected is a bleacher
stunt. Just how this would prove our
patriotism and noble disregard of pos
sible misunderstanding on the part of
Santa Clara of our high-minded atti
! tude seems somewhat difficult to dis-
J cover. But by all means let us cut
down the expense as much as possible
or perhaps even abandon the bonfire
if the freshmen will donate the same
amount of money to relief work of
some sort. The total sum represents
about the equivalent of a trip to
j Sticky's for each member of the class,
! and it seems only too possible that
the aforesaid trip might be the net re
sult of abandoning the bonfire.
As to the A\aste of fuel, if all the
Palo Alto boxes are needed for Palo
Alto fireplaces there is still material
which the military authorities in their
blindness and lack of foresight are
daily destroying which they will
doubtless be glad to turn over to the
freshmen. It is hard to agree that
the bonfire is only a mockery in spirit.
It is the one outburst of enthusiasm
for the team and in view of the show
ing made last Saturday it would seem
rather early in the game to start
hanging crepe on our chance against
Santa Clara.
While realizing that girlish en
thusiasm must find an outlet even if
only in knitting various articles on
whose utility we confess to lingering
doubts and which are certainly being
produced in a very wasteful manner,
it seems only fair to ask if even the
"average intelligence" of those Stan
ford men who have remained on the
campus in lamentable ignorance of
the fact, that the country is at war,
daily being called and many of the
others are paying for anxious tele
grams to the chairmen of \their local
boards in an effort to ascertain when
their turn is coming,—if even that
"average intelligence" may not be
trusted to provide a bonfire this year
which will serve its purpose without
being unnecessarily expensive, waste
ful or even fatally disastrous to the
slumbers of the freshmen?
