Two new volumes by Professor
Raymond M. Alden of the English de
partment have just come from the
press. They are "Tennyson, How to
Know Him," and "Readings in English
Prose of the Nineteenth Century, Part
One."
Of especial interest to the student
is the Tennyson volume, for in con
nection with the important briefer
poems of the Victorian poet, Dr.
Alden has supplied much preliminary
information and criticism.
The volume of poems appears as a
continuation of Dr. Alden's collection
of eighteenth century writings, and
undertakes to give a sufficient body
of readings for those engaged in the
general study of English literature of
the period covered. The second part
of the "Readings" will appear in the
winter.
