# Ambulance Unit Is Still Incomplete
## Students Irresponsive to Cal Last Chance to Enter This Week 
### 
With reports drifting in from the
University of California that the
quota for the Ambulance Unit, which
is being recruited at both California
and Stanford, is almost filled, and that
they expect the number to be com
pleted by the end of this week, comes
the feeling that Stanford men are not
responding to the call to fill this unit
as they did in sending out the last
four ambulance corps. This fear may
be groundless, but has its foundation
in the fact that, although at least
thirty men are wanted from Stanford
only about twenty-five have Inquired
at the Registrar's office about the
unit, and of these only about eight
have reported, after taking the phy
sical examination in San Francisco.
These facts are astonishing in the
light of past responses to similar
calls, and the exceptional opportuni
ties for a quick entrance into the ac
tive service of the government that
the ambulance division offers. Stan
ford must supply its quota within a
short time or there is possibility of
this branch being closed to Stanford
students, and recruited from other
places. Thirty or forty men have
been asked for, to fill the vacancies in
the University of California Unit sent
to Allentown, Pa., last May, and this
unit has since been enlarged from
ninety to one hundred and eighty
men.
