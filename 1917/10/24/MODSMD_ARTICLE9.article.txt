An Amazing Robbery has been
Perpetrated on the Campus. This
was brought to the Eager Ears of the
Over-worked Ex Committee while
they were waiting i'or Something to
Do.
Even Dr. Wilbur would not have be
lieved such Baseness on the part of
Stanford Studes. The Scholarship
Committee has One More Thing to Cry
about. The Faculty Committee On
Student Body Affairs lost one more
Night's Sleep. The Indefatigable
Student Advisor was roused from his
Slumbers, While even the Dean of
Women gasped.
Six Guesses! What is It? No, not
the Stanford Jewel, nor Frank Taga
wa's Bread Knife.
Varsity Sweaters! Ignominously
torn from the Backs of the Famous
Varsily "S" Men and what for?
Simply for the Use of the Varsity
Girls for the Football Benefit Dance
Friday Night at the Alpha Tau Omega
House. 'Nuf Sed.
