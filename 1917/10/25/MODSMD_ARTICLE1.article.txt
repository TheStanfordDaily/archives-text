kick from the toe of Templeton. The
army ruggers put up such a fast
brand of ball, however, that the Card
inals were not able to cross the goal
line at all. In addition the soldiers
threatened several times. From this
dope both teams will in fighting trim
on Saturday.

cisive defeat of the Second Varsity
on the Stanford turf, are confident
they can maul the first-year men.
With Doe, Morse, Templeton, Sheldon,
Wallace, Marx, Falk, Reynolds, and

ever. At the very least fans can be
prepared for football of a near "big
game" order.
Barbarian Club will make its first
appearance here when they line up
against the All-151acks. From re
ports the San Francisco team has
been strengthened over last year,
and may smear paint all over the
Cardinals. A defeat will come only
after a fast game, however.
