Arrangements are all completed for
the football dance to be given at the
Alpha Tan Omega house tomorrow
night. The committee has worked out
the final details of the dance and the
parade which will take place tomor
row noon. Indications point to the
largest attendance at any campus
dance given in recent years.
Yell Leaders Gilroy and Luhrs will
lead the parade, which moves down
the Row at about 12 o'clock, accom
panied by "Monk" Antrim and his
bass drum. "Varsity Girls," Coach
Wylie and Captain Pettingill, and the
members of the committee, will follow
in order. The campus will be given
this opportunity to see personally
those who comprise the list of "Var
sity Girls" and can then judge for
themselves what they can expect at
the dance.
Stanford and football will be de
cidedly in evidence in the decorations
at the house. The spirit and purpose
of the dance will be apparent in
every detail of the arrangements.
Every service rendered is voluntary
and the entire proceeds of the dance
above very slight expense will be
turned over to the use of the football
team.
No changes have been made in the 1
personnel of the "Varsity Girls."
