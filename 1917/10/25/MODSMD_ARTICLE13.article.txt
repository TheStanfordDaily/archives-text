# Boxing Bout Is Big Smoker Attraction
## "Shorty" Amaya Shows Real Class in 3 Rounds of Thrills and Class 
### 
A full house and general satisfac
tion with the evening's entertainment
marked last night's Union smoker,
which began sharply at 8 with a short
talk by "Daddy" Marx, who empha
sized the aims of the Union under
(he new scheme of universal member
ship, and cordially welcomed new
students to its advantages.
Professor Franklin gave extremely
I interesting experiments with liquid
air, freezing flowers, alcohol, and
forming a hammer of mercury. Fresh
! fruit was also in order, but unfor
i
itunately became too brittle to con
j sume.
Excitement prevailed when Tom
Amaya, a special student, offered to
go three rounds with any man pres
ent. A. Jones, 'IS, came forward after
j persuasion was exerted, and the
I crowd spread out to form the squared
ring. Amaya weighed in at 122
pounds, ringside, and Jones at con
siderably over. "Shorty" Amaya
showed ui) in clever fashion, giving a
good account of himself, but Jones, an
[adept, of the boxing game, was a bit
I too heavy for him, getting in some
especially stiff wallops toward the
last.
Rats were on hand in the form of
apples and "hot dogs," which disap
peared all too quickly. Jack Kegley
obliged with music, and everything
went to make it one of the best
smokers the Union has seen.
