# LET 'ER BURN

A more careful consideration of the bonfire question has led us to a
firm belief that the institution should be continued. That the bonflre ac
complishes its purpose, namely, to arouse the proper enthusiasm for the
Big Game, is proven by the statements of various football men, who be
lieve thoroughly that it is a genuine help to the team.
The chief objection to the bonfire seems to be based on the cost and
material used. The Executive Committee in going on record in favor of
the bonfire made the stipulation that they favored it "at a minimum cost."
We believe this statemenl expressed a condition which would be favor
able to everybody.
As to the question of material used, as we look back over past bon
fires and unless our memory serves us wrongly, the majority of the ma
terial used is not the kind which would be otherwise used for fuel. The
bonfire has been and rightly, made up of wood, brush, and weeds, which
otherwise would be allowed to not in the sun and wind. We admit that to
use wood which is available for fire stuff should be discouraged, but we
believe a bonfire can be built of other materials which will serve its pur
pose, and give the student body an opportunity to show the team that it is
behind them.
Substitutes have been suggested to take the place of the bonfire, but
we doubt the advisability of turning our hand to some other untried stunt.
The superiority of the bonfire as a rally feature is unquestioned, and if the
proper action is taken for its continuance we feel sure the benefits derived
for the Big Game will more than offset any disadvantages now apparent.
