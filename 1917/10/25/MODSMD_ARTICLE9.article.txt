# Wylie Tells of Five-Eighths in Rugby Football

### Jim Wylie 
In my last article I discussed the
qualifications of the half-back. Next
in order we come to consider the five
eighths. As we have already seen,
we have two of them, the inside and
the outside. And like the seven back
scrum this innovation comes from the
land of the moa—New Zealand. The
Australians and English still stick to
the old style of the two half-backs, —
the scrum half and stand off, or flying
half.
In the latter system the ball comes
away from the scrum half to a three
quarter, and away it travels across
the field. It is a slow business, giv
ing opponents much time to make
preparation for what is coming. But
in the New Zealand style the five
eighths when in an attacking move
ment takes the ball from the half,
and the operation is much more
speedy; and there is also a greater
range of variety in operating it. In
defending, the five-eighths may stop
an attack by opponents before it has
become threatening. From every point
of view these two mid-way men are
quite invaluable.
The five-eighth is in the happiest
of positions. He has the ball given
him by the scrum worker; he hap
three speedy men behind him, and a
partner as tricky and determined as
himself. He can bluff to his heart's
content, and use his partner and
three-quarters as a blind to his own
design on the goal line. No one on
the other side is quite sure whether
he is going to pass or not, with the
result that by the time they have
made up their minds lie is running
behind their goal posts. And he has,
so to speak, such qualifications as
"passing the buck" at his command,
