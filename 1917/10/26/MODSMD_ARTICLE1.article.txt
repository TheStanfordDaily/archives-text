# "SPAN'' SUSPENDS PUBLICATION FOR YEAR
## IS TEMPORARY PLAN Stanford Palo Alto News Will Not Publish Until Return of E.W. Smith 
### 
With today's issue of the Stanford-
Palo Alto News, publication of that
organ will be suspended for the time
being, and the journalistic efforts
hitherto supporting it will be com
bined with The Daily Palo Alto.
By this arrangement, work being
done for credit in the Journalism de
partment will continue as before, the
only change being in the medium of
publication.
The change announced was deemed
desirable in view of the state of af
fairs in the University this year, in
which it is not found possible to pro
ceed with the extensive plans which
the Journalism department had out
lined. In the meantime, the present
aims of that department will be
worked out through the cooperation
with the editorial staff of The Daily
Palo Alto.
By the agreement, The Daily Palo
Alto parts with no vestige of its own
initiative or individuality in any
sense, there being no cor/ection with
the Journalism department in regard
to policy or methods employed. How
ever, the plan is, that in order So
profit by the experience of U. N. Hoff
man, who is directing the work in
journalism, members of The Daily
Palo Alto staff will be given an op
portunity to take a course in editorial
management in which work done from
day to day on the college daily will
be criticised and corrected, with a
view to raising the standard of the
paper.
This new plan is not in any sense
permanent, but Is a temporary ar
rangement, deemed of mutual advant
age under existing circumstances. It
is expected, as conditions are read
justed, that the Stanford-Palo Alto
News will resume publication, and the
greater plans held for the Department
of Journalism will be realized.
