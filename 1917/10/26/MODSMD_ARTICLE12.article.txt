# SOLDIERS TO FEATURE IN SATURDAY RUGBY CONTEST
## FIRST YEAR MEN MEET LOWELL FIFTEEN VOTE ON ARM WAVERS Fort Mason Promises Cardinal One of Best Battles of Rugby Season 
### 
Stanford's Varsity fifteen will be up
against the proposition of defeating
the only team which has held it from
dossing the line this year, when the
Cardinal goes against the Second In
fantry Rugby squad tomorrow after
noon on the Varsity field. In addition
to the main contest the Freshman
scramble with Lowell High School,
and the All-Blacks are slated for the
Barbarian Club.
Fifty cents admission will be re
quired for entrance to the football
carnival, although those with student
body cards can pass for twenty-five
cents. Soldiers will also be admitted
lor a quarter. The Freshman contest
will commence promtly at 1:30, fol
lowed by the Varsity game at 3 and


"Dink" Templeton,
whose boots are featuring the foot
ball season.
the Second Varsity struggle at 4:30.
Tomorrow's games will give the
fans a final opportunity to select as
sistants for Yell Leader G. H. Luhrs,
*18. Voting will be done in the
bleachers immediately after the Var
sity contests for student body mem
bers. Ratification of the fans' choice
by the Executive Committee will take
place next week.
Yell Leader Luhrs has announced
that he will put his hopefuls through
antics singly, doubly, and every way,
so the fans will be sure of their se
lection. As an added attraction the
Stanford Band will be out on the
bleachers to entertain.
Fort Mason will have practically the
same team as played in the first game,
at San Francisco. Corrilla, the star
forward of the soldiers, will be the
only man out, due to a broken wrist.
C. Mallon at center three, Carcilla at
second five, and several others, will
combine to cause trouble for the Card
inals. Coacli Wylie will send his usual
team against the San Francisco rug
gers and after their showing in the
two last contests they will be able to
put up a hard battle against the in
fantry men.
Lowell defeated the Second Varsity
decisively through the work of the
backfield, mainly, and when they run
up against tiie Freshmen the fans
will see some Rugby. The first-year
men are as fast and heavy, however,
as the city team and are now playing
together, so a real fight should be ex
pected. At any rate, Lowell is one of
if not the fastest high school team in
the state this year.
Barbarian Club should put up a good
battle against the All-Black, although
Coach Wylie has been getting the sec
ond string men together in better
shape the last few days.

Tomorrow's games will give the
fans a final opportunity to select as
sistants for Yell Leader G. H. Luhrs,
*18. Voting will be done in the
bleachers immediately after the Var
sity contests for student body mem
bers. Ratification of the fans' choice
by the Executive Committee will take
place next week.
Yell Leader Luhrs has announced
that he will put his hopefuls through
antics singly, doubly, and every way,
so the fans will be sure of their se
lection. As an added attraction the
Stanford Band will be out on the
bleachers to entertain.
Fort Mason will have practically the
same team as played in the first game,
at San Francisco. Corrilla, the star
forward of the soldiers, will be the
only man out, due to a broken wrist.
C. Mallon at center three, Carcilla at
second five, and several others, will
combine to cause trouble for the Card
inals. Coacli Wylie will send his usual
team against the San Francisco rug
gers and after their showing in the
two last contests they will be able to
put up a hard battle against the in
fantry men.
Lowell defeated the Second Varsity
decisively through the work of the
backfield, mainly, and when they run
up against tiie Freshmen the fans
will see some Rugby. The first-year
men are as fast and heavy, however,
as the city team and are now playing
together, so a real fight should be ex
pected. At any rate, Lowell is one of
if not the fastest high school team in
the state this year.
Barbarian Club should put up a good
battle against the All-Black, although
Coach Wylie has been getting the sec
ond string men together in better
shape the last few days.

same team as played in the first game,
at San Francisco. Corrilla, the star
forward of the soldiers, will be the
only man out, due to a broken wrist.
C. Mallon at center three, Carcilla at
second five, and several others, will
combine to cause trouble for the Card
inals. Coacli Wylie will send his usual
team against the San Francisco rug
gers and after their showing in the
two last contests they will be able to
put up a hard battle against the in
fantry men.
Lowell defeated the Second Varsity
decisively through the work of the
backfield, mainly, and when they run
up against tiie Freshmen the fans
will see some Rugby. The first-year
men are as fast and heavy, however,
as the city team and are now playing
together, so a real fight should be ex
pected. At any rate, Lowell is one of
if not the fastest high school team in
the state this year.
Barbarian Club should put up a good
battle against the All-Black, although
Coach Wylie has been getting the sec
ond string men together in better
shape the last few days.

Fort Mason —Traynhan, March.
